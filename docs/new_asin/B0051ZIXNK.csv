4526510,5,B0051ZIXNK,"In 1989, a young boy is kidnapped by a local madman and raised to be a soulless killer. When Allison makes the mistake of trying to save him, she becomes trapped in the pair's murderous game! Director Stevan Mena returns with a bloody tale of nature versus nurture that takes us back to the slaughterhouse in BEREAVEMENT, the highly-anticipated prequel to 2004's hit MALEVOLENCE. Anyone who may have written MALEVOLENCE off as being cheap imitation will have much to consider now. Mena demonstrates all of the same skill and control as he had shown previously, but this time without the obvious references to HALLOWEEN or TEXAS CHAIN SAW that may have lessened the impact for some viewers.

BEREAVEMENT is a much different film than before, focusing far more on the personalities of the characters and the psychosis of the killer. This, again, is no FRIDAY THE 13TH. The people presented on screen are smart, realistic, and rounded individuals. We care for them, and as a result, the tension and suspense soar because we do not want to see them get hurt. Their deaths have meaning. Mena has put together a much stronger cast, with exceptional performances by Michael Biehn, John Savage, and Alexandra Daddario. The biggest praise goes to Spencer List in the role of Martin, however, whose emotionless performance and unflinching expressions capture the essence of the character perfectly. List is never assumed to be evil, he is just blank. The success of BEREAVEMENT lies solely on the believability of this performance, and List excels in the role.

With key cinematography by Marco Cappetta, another thrilling score, and a more intelligent script overall, BEREAVEMENT shows an advancement in style and form for the now-established director. The Masters of Horror will need to scoot over to make room for Stevan Mena at the dinner table.

With so much weirdness, a Pandora's box could have opened to fill the gaps and give some dark backstory. Instead,  senselessness remains throughout the film - the plot, dialog, action. Bereavement would be better if a little light was shone on the levels of bereavement in the film. More information could've given this film a cerebral darkness.

4526519,3,B0051ZIXNK,"Although, admittedly, there are some creepy and disturbing moments that underscore the movie's theme, good gravy is it all delivered in a mostly cliche way. And what's with the ""weak female characters making terrible choices"" thing? It's *so* overdone. Ultimately, the premise is an interesting one, but it's done *infinitely* better in the movies ""Chained"" and ""Frailty"".  Seriously. Infinitely better.

By the way, if you're in the mood for something that breaks with convention (i.e. not all of the female victims spend their energy crying and screaming and flailing about rather than trying to put all that flailing to good use by damaging the assailant in some way, and running on flat land [in underwear o' course] yet somehow tripping over their manicured toes), check out ""You're Next.""",1398556800,,794,5.1953125
4526520,2,B0051ZIXNK,"The movie had some potential but ultimately seemed like an over the top slasher film.  Because of this, the film was not very frightening or realistic to me.  This story starts out with the abduction of a small boy by the serial killer and throughout the film, the boy witnesses various killings/torture performed by the serial killer who is directed by voices in his head.  I mainly wrote this review to mention 2 films that I felt explored a similar subject matter but were exceptional to this film.  The first is 'Frailty' which was the most realistic (and best) film I've seen of a serial killer who receives messages in his head (from God in this case).  The second film is 'Chained'  in which a 9 year old boy is abducted and kept for years by a serial killer.  Both of those films, because of their realism, made me feel a lot more frightened and uncomfortable than Bereavement.",1397779200,,885,4.563291139240507

4526524,2,B0051ZIXNK,"Bereavement (Stevan Mena, 2010)

Bereavement is a prequel to Mena's 2004 Malevolence. In my review of that one, which I saw about four years ago, I hypothesized that it was the middle film in a projected trilogy, though I no longer remember what led me to that belief. I also, despite the film's many shortcomings (upon reflection, the two stars I gave it seem overly generous), posited that maybe it would make more sense once Bereavement came out. I have now seen Bereavementvery unusually for me, I am typing these opening sentences while the end credits of the movie are rolling, rather than letting it sit for a few days to see if my feelings about it changeand I can confidently say that the answer to the question I posted four years ago is no. While it is obvious that Mena learned from a number of the mistakes made with Malevolence, he's still got a long, long way to go.

Plot: five years before the main action of the film, Martin Bristol (Bringing Up Bobby's Spencer List) is kidnapped from his backyard while his mother is interviewing a new nanny. Seems the boy has some attachment problems, as well as some physical anomalies that render him unable to feel pain the way normal people do. Fast-forward five years. Allison (Hall Pass' Alexandria Daddario) has just moved into town after the untimely passing of her parents; she's come to live with her aunt (You've Got Mail's Kathryn Meisle) and uncle (The Terminator's Michael Biehn), along with her young cousin Wendy (27 Dresses' Payton List, Spencer's sister). She's not thrilled with small-town life, but things pick up once she meets William (X2's Nolan Gerard Funk) and discovers a mysterythere seems to be a young boy lurking around a long-abandoned meatpacking plant. Unfortunately, her uncle isn't thrilled with Graham, whose father (Inside Moves' John Savage) is, as Uncle quaintly puts it, trailer trash, and no one believes her about the boy. What does an enterprising young high school girl do? Investigate!

The higher caliber of actor in this movie certainly helps it, when you compare it to Malevolence; there are a number of decent, if not stellar, actors to be found here (Savage, of course, is the best of the bunch, but don't let his name being close to the top of the marquee fool you; you can count the number of scenes in which he appears on one hand). The real surprise is Alexandria Daddario, who holds her own with the marquee names in the cast just fine; hopefully we'll be hearing more from her, and in better movies.

However, better actors can't solve all of Mena's problems. He also edited the film, and that was a mistake; a more professional editor might have been able to whip the film's horrid pacing into shape. The easiest example of this to point out is the end of the film. Or is it the end? Maybe that's the end. Or... you get the idea; this movie goes on about half an hour too long. Every time you think you've seen the closing scene, Mena tacks on yet another epilogue. (Including one after the end creditsI no longer remember, but I assume it is a recreation of the opening scene of Malevolence.)

Since I seem to have gotten myself into a good-bad-good-bad format here, I do have to give Mena credit for one very important thing here; it's obvious that he has put a great amount of thought into the building of this world, much more than one would expect given when is almost certain to be a trilogy of DTV movies rather than, for example, Star Wars. You've gotta give the man points for treating his source material as if it were Star Wars; the attention to detail comes out in a lot of ways, most of them good. He's also put a better structure in place with this movie; the romantic subplot between Allison and William never really gets off the ground (perhaps going to a little more detail there might have offset some of the movie's pacing problems?), but it still works, and what little we get of it feels real.

The romance, however, is not the main point of the film; would that it were. Bereavement is still a slasher movie, and it is that regard where it is most obvious that Mena hasn't progressed in the most meaningful ways he needs to in order to pull these movies above mediocre. The slasher plot in Bereavement is much less used than the one in Malevolence, and it draws less obviously from its primary source material, but this isn't anything you haven't seen before, from the psychological problems of the serial killer to the setting to the methods of apprehension and torture to...the works.

Once again I find myself saying that Mena put a number of pieces into place for a really bang-up movie, just as I did four years ago reviewing Malevolence. And once again I find myself saying that despite same, Mena didn't deliver the goods. There are some things worth watching here; both Savage and Biehn have been unjustly neglected actors for a couple of decades, and both have started turning in pretty darn good performances in the movies I've caught them in recently; this is no exception, though it may be in part the actors shining despite, rather than in tandem with, their surroundings, and Daddario does the best she can with the material she's given. When she's talking instead of screaming (and the amount of screaming in this movie is tiresome indeed), she gives a mighty fine performance as well. Unfortunately, however, you have to sit through Bereavement to see any of it. * ",1391126400,,5415,4.650992685475444

4526526,2,B0051ZIXNK,"I was really looking forward to this prequel to 2004's Malevolent, but was sadly disappointed. The premise of the movie is great and right up my alley. A twisted gore fest about a serial killer who abducts a child, in the hope of making him his predecessor. Sounds good, but in actuality, it was very slow and extremely predictable. I kept hearing about how scary and messed up this film was, did they watch what I just watched? There are a few bright spots here, mainly the cast, which was terrific, and the end of the film, which while predictable, was still really cool to see. Spencer List stars as Martin, the serial killer in waiting. At the ripe old age of 13, this kid has become a B-Horror star! He's this cute, quiet, innocent looking kid, and before you know it he's killed you. He has this way about him, in these types of movies that make it seem real, and he is truly scary. The cast was great, the last twenty minutes was cool to watch, but really there's not much else here.",1361577600,,990,4.356756756756757

4526528,3,B0051ZIXNK,"First off, I don't see this as a slasher film.  I found it to be more of a psychological/horror movie about the beginnings of a serial killer.  I may add that the director was successful or I just got hooked in with the characters that towards the end, I did feel distressed and disturbed of the outcome of the characters, even the drunken invalid father calling out for his son and waiting by his front door unbeknownst that his (heroic)son will never come home and the survival of the little girl's dog spared by both the horrific demise of its owners and the flame furied fall of its home.  I loved seeing Michael Biehn as a family man and John Savage as the invalid father.  I find it hard, but surprised, to see child actors perform and be in a movie with a very violent subject matter.",1359417600,,791,4.360544217687075

4526532,4,B0051ZIXNK,As a prequel it surpasses its predecessor in many ways and builds upon a well-conceived idea from a director who shows much promise in the horror genre. You can see his biggest influences and that is by no means a bad thing! This movie is this generations 'Halloween'!,1346889600,,268,4.604166666666667
4526533,4,B0051ZIXNK,"You come to care for Allison and her family because so much time is spent showing their lives and the way they relate to each other, so what happens leaves you hoping for a happy ending for them.  Well, I'm not going to go into all that, so I'll tell you other reasons to see this movie.

Yes, the cinemetography is very good, but what is really the compelling thing about this film is the psycholgical gameplay that goes on between the killer and his young, unwilling appretice, Martin, whom he has snatched from his home.  Whoever said we don't know anything about the killer's background is wrong.  He doesn't enjoy the killing, which is obvious by his frenzied ravings to the bull's head that is obviously a stand-in for his father.  We can deduct that his father had conditioned him until he cracked and now he's carrying on in his place.  Since he is a loner, he has snatched the boy after studying him and discovering he cannot physically feel, speak, and maybe not even feel internally.  But he must, because he tries to help a few girls escape and he is fearful of his mentor/tormentor.  The dynamic between the two of them is compelling.

I liked the character Allison, especially when she takes compassion on Martin a few times and tries to help him.  You can't help feeling sorry for him, especially since his mentor is trying to break him down like his own father apparently did.  The process with which things take a turn for the worse is compelling to see, and a must if you like movies that involve that mindset.

True, this movie is disturbing and gory, so I must agree with another reviewer here by asking what sort of parents would let their children be involved in a movie like this?  I wouldn't, but it's not my call.  Other than that, Bereavement is a very well-done movie, and a must-see if you like pictures that also make you feel for the good guys as well as the predators.  Warning, though; much like Eden Lake, it will haunt you for quite a while.",1344038400,2,1975,4.477653631284916
4526534,3,B0051ZIXNK,"Bereavement is a modern horror movie, but tries to be more. It's about a psychotic man that abducts a child, Martin. Martin then begins to experience this man's terrifying crimes. Overall, it's too much of a typical slasher to really excel in the genre.

What did I like? The overall theme of abduction and nature vs nurture in this situation is creepy. It's got some beautiful shots and great music. Also, there were some moments (the hook to the leg!) that actually made me flinch, which doesn't happen often. The ending was also decent and slightly different from a typical horror ending.

What did I dislike? The constant loud and often unnecessary screaming got annoying after a while. There is a scene where she ends up in a freezer and when she turns on  the light, she starts screaming ferociously. But there really isn't anything to scream about since the room is basically empty and everything is covered in rags. Also, the second half of the film quickly turns into a typical slasher. You've probably seen some of the scenes before in another movie. The acting was very mixed; some did well and others did poorly.

Overall, if you're in the mood for a slasher and you've seen the rest, I recommend checking out Bereavement. If you have Netflix Streaming, it is available as of 6/29/12 if you want to save your money.

There is brief nudity, and excessive violence and gore.",1340928000,,1384,4.702479338842975

This film is a prequel to Stevan Mena's first film, Malevolence, another not that great movie, both are about psycho killers, typical slasher movie stuff. The concept itself is interesting - a character study on how a psychopathic killer is crafted under the tutelage of another psychopathic character, but I'm always leery of movies that are directed, produced, written, and even scored by one person - if there's no one around to tell y ou ""No"" - how do you know you're not making crap?",1340236800,,543,4.726315789473684

This is like ever other torture movie ever made: no one survives except the simple minded killer (okay, in this case the killers trainee).

4526539,5,B0051ZIXNK,"I had fairly low expectations for Bereavement. The horror genre has produced a few good movies over the past decade, but it's also shown us quite a few duds that I would prefer to forget. Thankfully, Bereavement is worth watching.

The concept of Bereavement is fairly simple. A young boy is kidnapped by a deranged killer with the intent of training him in the trade of ritual murder. The young boy, played by Spencer List, makes the role film. I haven't seen a young boy more convincing in a horror role since Haley Joel Osment in The Sixth Sense. He really is quite fantastic in his reserved role that must have been very difficult to play.

Bereavement isn't completely different from other horror movies, but it treats the process much differently. It goes for fear more from realism than plain shock novelty. If anything else, I respect Bereavement for treating it's audience as intellectuals rather than idiots looking for a cheap thrill.

I'd recommend Bereavement if you enjoy horror movies. I'm getting pretty sick of the genre and it's slow progression, but I really enjoyed this film. You better watch it quick before five other movies come to rip off it's concept.",1331251200,,1177,4.816831683168317

The lead characters, especially the one played by Alexandra Daddario, make some curiously poor decisions, but if you can look past that (like you must with most horror movies), you'll find the acting and cinematography to be top notch.  I couldn't get my mind around the killer's motives but that may be because I haven't seen the first movie.  This is a high quality blu-ray transfer.  The excellent video quality makes watching the beautiful Daddario quite a treat.

4526543,3,B0051ZIXNK,"Bereavement seems to start off as two different movies in one.  On one hand, you have the crazy serial killer who talks to the skull of an animal who kidnaps and kills teenage girl by stabbing them repeatedly in their stomachs.  He has also kidnapped an ""apprentice"" a young boy who does feel pain.  Across the town there is a coming of age story of a teenager (Alexandra Daddario, Percy Jackson) who moves in with her uncle after her parents die in a car accident.

She has to adjust from growing up in the big city of Chicago to small town Pennsylvania and naturally this involves a boy from the wrong side of the tracks.  About an hour into the movie the two genres finally collide when Daddario sees the small boy in the window of an abandoned meat packing plant and goes in to investigate.  Naturally a bad idea.

Bereavement attempts to be a thinking man's horror movie and almost achieves it.  It is a nice diversion from the genre than your run of the mill slasher flick without a discernable plot.  But if you do like horror films where the kills get bigger and more elaborate, this is not for you.",1325030400,,1107,4.413793103448276

{The state of being deprived of something or someone :  the loss of a loved one by death.} That good people is a quick definition of the word that lays claim to the title of this film. Makes sense since this is a prequel to a film called ""Malevolence"", both by writer/director Steven Mena. Check out the definition of that word and it all makes sense, would be interesting to see what a third film in this series would be called. Of course the first film was an indie success for the filmmaker that garnered awards and such leading to an easy decision I am sure to do this film.

Graham Sutter is a sick man who preys upon women and savagely murders them, but the man is looking for a little help. In 1986 he goes on the hunt but this time it is not for women, it is for a little boy. Someone he can mentor and teach, someone who can help him with his own personal demons, he finds such a boy. Six year old Martin Bristol is the unlucky boy who just happens to be in the right place and time for the killer. It also just so happens that he suffers from a disease that allows him to feel no pain. Upon discovering this after the boy is lured into his truck while the boy's mother is inside with a potential sitter the man thinks it is a sign.

From this point on the boy is subject to all kinds of mental torture as he is forced to watch and sometimes help in the murder and disposal of this man's victims. Enter a young women named Allison who has moved to the town to live with her Uncle, Aunt, and cousin. Being a city girl things are not going exactly as she had hopped but finds comfort in meeting a boy her age. They begin to hang out to the Uncles non liking of course, in his mind the boy is no good. But that is the least of his worries as Allison is growing more and more interested in a young boy she sees in an abandoned farmhouse. As her curiosity grows so does the chances of her being the next victim for the local killer.

I have to say that this is a much better film then it seems to be getting credit for amongst other reviews. That's cool every one has their own preferences for what movies they like and such. Although I will say this film seems so much better if you have seen the first movie. ""Malevolence"" was a pretty good slasher/horror film that worked because it knew exactly what it was. This film is very different from the first one but works even more in my opinion because it does the exact same thing and still sets up what is to come in ""Malevolence"".

Where ""Malevolence"" was a straight slasher film and had the look and fell of that kind of film this one is more a psychological horror flick. A good horror/drama in many ways with both elements bending into the other in a somewhat natural way. An example would be ""The Silence of the Lambs"" of the type of style and feel I am talking about. Now of course this film is not the classic that ""Silence"" is but it is in that same vein of filmmaking. In fact this one seems even more realistic with the way it is written, shot, and presented. Of course that could also be the killers lack of charisma when compared to those of ""Silence"" but still it makes for a good movie.

Writer/director  Steven Mena knew what he wanted to do with this film and it shows as he has taken what he learned the first time around and added to it. The story while from a new viewer may come of as just another serial killer flick really does help explain the mystery of the first film. Like who is this guy and why is he doing what he is doing to these people. While this film certainly can be an entertaining ride for any one who hasn't seen the first flick I will say it does help to see them both. In fact watching them in the order they were released is the best way to go. The first film is helped by the fact that you really don't know why this killer is doing this and the second is helped because it explains it, does that make sense to any one other than me?

I have to say that this film was really well done especially from how it was shot. There are some masterful shots in this film with brilliant and beautiful cinematography. The opening of the film in particular is just so well done and magnificent. From the wide shot for the title card to the truck passing right into frame driving away from the camera, and even into the journey from start to finish looking for a kid it all looks good. I would be honestly surprised if some one disagreed with me here. You can not like the film, acting, or what ever but i bet we would all agree on how it was shot.

Speaking of acting our lead actress Alexandra Daddario did a good job as newbie in town Allison. She comes off very believable as the city girl hating her new life, teenagers. She has a good look and quality about her that lends to the role. Spencer List plays the young boy who is kidnapped by the killer and comes off well in the film, especially for a child actor who has some pretty rough scenes to go through. Every one else in the film is really good especially Michael Biehn as the girl's Uncle. But it is Brett Rickaby who is the show stealer here playing the psycho of the town. He comes off very well in every scene even in ones where he is afraid of a deer skull he thinks orders him to kill. Now that could have came off very silly for lack of a better word in another actors hands if portrayed wrong. It is a low budget film but that does not mean it has to be a B film.

The DVD copy that i got a hold of comes with some excellent special features on it which is always a plus for me. There is a great behind the scenes feature that takes you into the everything you would want to see. From set ups to performances it can all be found here. Then of course the making of which  goes into not only thins film but the previous one and how they both came about. But among even more special features we get an excellent audio commentary from the writer/director himself. This of course is my favourite thing about the bonus stuff as it goes deeper into the making of this film and even more facts about the previous one.

Now this is not a perfect film and might not make every ones personal favourites list but it is a good flick. I can see how some would not like it as much and how others could love it. It could be another low budget classic that picks up viewers the longer it is out. I personally think it is a really good movie especially if you have seen the first one. I feel like i am repeating that to much but it does need to be said, I recommend both to any horror fan. At the very least it good make for a good rental for and movie night one may have. In fact i may even say that I like this film more so than the previous one, but while very much connected they are very much two different beasts. Check them out if you get the chance, you just may find yourself enjoying some low budget entrainment. {something that entertains; interesting, diverting, or amusing thing; esp., a show or performance}, definition of that last word [from yourdictionary.com]",1323043200,,7025,4.156617647058823

Tried like heck to find out which actor appeared in the great movie, The Crazies...finally pieced together that Mr Sutter was the farmer character that burned down his own farmhouse with his family occupying the home....just slightly larger than a bit part.
Mr. Biehn must be experiencing hard times to allow himself to appear in this vehicle. His presence was only interesting inasmuch as it allowed me the depressing visage of his very appareent aging. Hardly recognizable as the citizen sent back to protect the young John Connor in the first Terminator movie....looks more and more like my late Grandmother every time I happen to stumble across a role of his in one ""B"" movie or the other.....like a slightly older, pale Lou Diamond Phillips.

The newer movies that prefer to skip right to violence or aim for the squeamish unnerving of their viewers - they're not really my thing.  I found that this movie was a double edged sword.  Not only was there a lot of seemingly unnecessary violence (toward characters that we were unable to find a connection to) but the story seemed a little convoluted as well.

After reading a little about this movie online, I found that this is a prequel to the director's 2004 movie Malevolence.  Maybe I needed to see that movie to appreciate this film more, but I didn't see any mention of the connection at all in the movie description.  I feel like the movie was maybe trying really hard to explain the situation in the first film, but without Malevolence's storyline put into the context - this film just seemed like a meandering concept.

Either way, I'd say if these types of horror films are your style, then watch both movies then maybe you could get more out of this than I did.  I just think this goes off target in too many aspects for my taste.",1321920000,,1159,4.433962264150943

4526550,4,B0051ZIXNK,"If I could sum up this movie in one word, it would be ""wow"". I just finished watching ""Bereavement"" and I will rate this amongst my top horror movies of all time. From a filming aspect, I have to also agree with other reviewers that the cinematography is fantastic. I was impressed with that right from the start of the film. In terms of horror movies, this is a gem to the genre. I didn't see ""Malevolence"" so I didn't know what to expect in this prequel. Will there be any survivors? You'll have to watch to find out. The mark of a good horror film is to make the audience care about the characters so that you feel terror if their safety is threatened. This film succeeds with that. This film isn't just about blood and guts all over the floor so if you're getting this because you want some sadistic torture copycat like the ""Saw"" franchise, you'll be disappointed. Another reviewer wrote that they felt there wasn't enough background story to the serial killer. I disagree with that. The actor portraying the serial killer actually made me feel a little sorry for the character. He was clearly psychotic and out of his mind. He didn't seem to take joy from killing people. It was something he felt he ""had"" to do. We the audience don't learn about this man's own childhood or how he ended up committing these horrible murders. Its a mystery but that adds to the allure of the film. Another complaint someone had is why did this new girl Allison all of a sudden was the only person in town who found the missing boy in the abandoned rundown shack after 5 years? Thats not so far fetched. If you think about your own town, how many times do you drive past an old house or building and never even give it a second look? Allison was brand new and had a fresh pair of eyes as she looked around her new surroundings. Thats why she was able to pay attention to what others ignored over the years. I will say that I agree that it seemed odd that the killer was killing locals and yet no one seemed to notice or maybe the sheriff's office is just that inadequate. That was really the only flaw of the story. Otherwise, this movie is definitely 4 out of 5 stars. Great job to all that created this film!",1321142400,11,2198,4.337378640776699

4526553,1,B0051ZIXNK,"""Bereavement"" is supposedly the chilling prequel to ""Malevolence,"" another supposedly chilling film.  However, after watching this dud, I have no plans on giving ""Malevolence"" a look.

""Bereavement"" tells two stories at once.  Firstly, it gives us a look at the horrific childhood of Martin Bristol (Spencer List), who suffers from a condition that prevents him from feeling heat, cold, pain, etc.  He is kidnapped as a toddler by Graham Sutter (Brett Rickaby), a serial killer who has the same condition.  Sutter forces little Martin to witness and sometimes participate in the brutal murder of innocent and seemingly random women as Sutter tries to understand their pain.

The second story in this film is that of Allison Miller (Alexandra Daddario).  She moves from busy Chicago to the rural home of her uncle, Jonathan (Michael Biehn), and his family after her parents pass away.  As is always the case in movies, she is having a bit of trouble adjusting to her new home, but finds solace in her daily runs that pass in front of an abandoned slaughterhouse that is conveniently the home of Graham and Martin and their growing body count of dead girls.

The two stories come together when Allison notices Martin looking out of a window at the slaughterhouse and she decides to find out what is going on with the mysterious little boy.  Blood, guts, and gore ensue.

The film is nothing more than an excuse for the FX guys to chunk fake blood at the screen and the actors, for the director to attempt to gross you out with said fake blood, and for the actors to scream their heads off (every female in the movie) or passively go through the motions (Biehn).

I enjoy Biehn's work usually (especially in ""Tombstone""), but he looked as if he didn't even want to be on set for the duration of the film.  Spencer List did little more than have a questioning look on his face the entire time.  Rickaby pulled off psycho fairly good, but wasn't enough to save the film.  Allison's love interest, William (Nolan Gerard Funk), did a decent job as well.  The victims over-acted as much as possible to sell how terrible their situation was.

Daddario gave a very thin performance, and in true virginal beauty Hollywood  fashion, wore a shirt that was just as thin.  While she was quite nice to look at, her performance was nothing to brag about.

Overall, ""Bereavement"" will most likely appeal to fans of hack trash like ""Saw"" and ""Hostel,"" but it will never add much to an already bloated genre of weak films.

Not recommended.",1319846400,2,2520,4.73394495412844
4526554,1,B0051ZIXNK,"Don't listen to the people who go on and on about how sick and violent this movie is- if you pick it up on that basis, you're going to be disappointed. There's no actual torture here and no real gore. Just a bunch of standard stabbings and shootings with some blood splatter. The deaths are quick- this is NOT a torture movie. The kills are uncreative- just plain old stabbings mostly. You won't actually see much of the violence, either- the camera usually either cuts away and shows us blood splatter, or you just see darkened figures with no detail when the murders go down.

Low gore and uncreative kills can be saved by compelling characters or an interesting plot, but this movie has neither of those things. The plot is muddled and confusing. You think this movie will explain the fascinating psychology of a killer, but for the most part, it doesn't. The movie drags on and on, dull minute after dull minute, rarely revealing any new insights into the killers.

*SPOILERS*

The main killer is a crazy guy who thinks that steer heads and/or the body of his dead father and/or some scarecrow-like thing are ordering him to kill. He spends a lot of time screaming incoherent nonsense at these objects, which gets old fast. The source of his psychosis never becomes completely clear, but near the very end of the movie, the guy explains that he's killing humans to redeem himself for the fact that his father (who was a butcher) forced him to slaughter animals that trusted him. Um, OK? That still doesn't make a lot of sense.

The motives of the kidnapped boy, Martin, are even less clear. After living with the killer for 5 years, Martin still seems disturbed by the killings and even releases one girl at her request. Yet only days later, he's willingly leading a girl to her death and ignoring her cries for help. By the next day, he's already decided to start his own killing spree, despite the fact that he's been rescued from the kidnapper by that point. This sudden change in behavior is never explained at all. At one point, there's a classroom scene about ""nature vs nurture"" where a teacher says that a child raised in a hateful environment will become a carbon copy of the parents. So basically the explanation is just that this kid grew up with a killer and therefore became a killer himself? If the explanation is that simplistic, I can't fathom why we needed a 90 minute movie to explain it. And it still doesn't explain the kid's sudden change in attitude.

Martin could have been an interesting character. He has a disorder that causes him to be unable to feel physical pain. I thought maybe the killer would kidnap him, unaware of his disorder, and then torture him in a bunch of crazy ways, which Martin would be unaffected by due to his disorder, and which would either fascinate or frustrate the killer. But this most definitely does NOT happen. The killer is apparently somehow already aware of Martin's disorder, and he has no real interest in torturing him- he cuts him a couple times, but for the most part he hugs him and treats him as a son and an apprentice. So much less interesting than it could have been.

None of the other characters are particularly interesting or well-developed and they all just end up as victim fodder anyways. Also, it was hard to believe that this guy could kill so many local girls in a small town without arousing suspicions at all.

If you watch this because you want some creative kills, torture, and extreme gore, you'll be disappointed. If you watch it because you want a psychological thriller with an interesting storyline and characters and insights into the mind of a killer, you'll also be disappointed. There's really nothing here for anyone.",1319673600,,3714,4.652439024390244
4526555,4,B0051ZIXNK,"This is a prequel to writer/director Stevan Mena's earlier slasher film ""Malevolence."" Here Mena attempts to go behind the urge to kill in order to explain how a maniac's psychology is forged. This maniac follows in the tradition of Michael Myers, Jason, and other serialized killers, in most respects, especially in the sense that he is ""pure evil.""

I'm not sure the psychological explanation is convincing. We get something of a muddle of motive. However the main point, that by living in an atmosphere of unremitting violence, one will become imbued with it and inured to committing it - might have some validity. Attempts at analysis aside though, this is an effective thriller, largely because of its skillful photography.

Here the killer resides in an eerie, closed abattoir that itself becomes a main character in the movie. The place is replete with suspension hooks, conveyors, and an incinerator once used to process pigs and cattle. The place continues to loom over the agricultural Pennsylvania landscape where the action is set.

The rusty truck that the killer drives out in when he hunts for human prey is another prime character in the movie. It glides over a rise in the road behind the next likely victim, like Jaws cruising the waters.

The film also has an unusual arc. It doesn't necessarily proceed according to slasher film formulas when it comes to who falls prey.

There is a fair amount of blood splatter here, but Mena toned down the gore in favor of more indirect chills in a number of scenes.

Flash forward some time, and the boy's kidnapper is, in fact, a serial killer, preying on women and making the boy watch or even participate in the killings.

Meanwhile, a young woman has moved in with relatives in the same region where the killer is at work. She, of course, notices strange happenings and begins to investigate while also leading a semi-normal rebellious life that upsets her fairly conservative guardians.

The film attempts to make a statement about the influence of nature vs. nurture, but misfires completely. I don't want to say anything about what goes on in the movie, so I will make this veiled.

We don't know anything about the little boy who is taken, other than that he can't feel pain. We don't know if he had a super nice life or, really, anything about him or his home, as the film glosses over this very quickly. He could have had a horrible home or a great home; we don't know. The ending is not something that you wouldn't see coming and it doesn't say anything about the apparent subject of the movie in any real way, as we don't have any background on the little boy.

On top of this, we never really understand the killer's motivation. He seems to be super sorry for working at the slaughterhouse or some such nonsense, but this isn't explained and is left for the viewer to decide if his insanity is simply run-of-the-mill insanity, or some sort of ideological madness. At any rate, the killer's motivation is not explored and renders his acts meaningless; blood for shock.

If I had to really say other things that are wrong with this movie, I would say that everything is simply perfunctory. Everything in the movie just is and there is no reason for it. People do dumb things as in all horror movies and the outcome is the same.

4526562,2,B0051ZIXNK,"A young boy, denied an education and forced to work in the family's animal processing plant while being repressed and abused by his father, grows up to be the creepy guy who lives alone at the now closed dilapidated plant in the middle of nowehere. He drives the beater looking van from the business and spends his time punching young women and dragging them back to his lair. Just for kicks, he picks up a young, seemingly mute boy and brings him back to learn the new family business.

Pan ahead 5 years, and we see voluptious, orphaned Allison arriving from Chicago to move in with her aunt and uncle in this boring small farm town; I mean, really, it's so small that the local high school doesn't have ""much call for girls' sports"" (and this is the 90s). Mix in a bit of teenage rebellion, the local bad boy with a drunken, wheelchair-bound father, a motorbike and a penchant for auto mechanics, and a daily running regimen that takes young Allison right by the old Sutter place, and you have a recipe for what is unfortunately an all too familiar slasher flick.

Pros: The scenery is fantastic. The camera slowly pans through a bleak and desolate area in rural Pennsylvania that looks like its better days are far behind it. The characters are isolated and this is brought home by the camera work. Brett Rickaby is pretty darn good as Graham Sutter. I could buy his insanity and religious compulsions. Graham has some of the best lines in the movie, and I liked his scenes the most, especially when he was conversing or arguing with the unseen tormentor who commands him to kill. Spencer List as Martin Bristol does a decent job as the dirty-faced little mute apprentice whose CIPA fascinates and frightens Graham, his captor/mentor/patriarch. Bereavement was made with a relatively low budget and it makes the most of its resources. The ""making of"" featurette in the Special Features is quite interesting.

Cons: Did Michael Biehn (long live Kyle Reese!) actually show up for taping? I like him and I usually enjoy his performances, but his delivery of Allison's uncle is just ho-hum. Overall the dialogue is forced and wooden and the plot is unsurprisingly thin. The murder scenes are either going to be too horrific for some viewers or not bloody enough, depending on which side of the slasher fan fence you fall on. There are plenty of scenes of bound women crying and pleading for their lives and there is plenty of blood but very little violence is actually shown (with the exception of one scene that I have to admit made me cringe). Most of it involves widened eyes, more screaming, and camera cuts to blood spraying against the walls.

No one picks up a film with a description that includes ""serial killer with a tendency for butchering teenage girls"" without expecting gore, misogyny, and horrific acts committed against the characters. The outcome of such films is usually already assumed. I won't even rail against any of that because a) it is just part of the genre, and b) I like slasher films and anticipate them as mindless fun. Unfortunately it is more and more difficult to create a slasher film now that is unique or delivers any surprises. Bereavement is nothing new. This is a plot we've seen over and over in countless slasher films.

I admit that I was intrigued by the blurb on the cover of the DVD that proclaims Bereavement to be ""The Indie Horror Shocker of the Year!"" But the delivery falls quite short of that. There are elements here that have potential (Graham, introducing a child apprentice in a world of torture and killing, etc.), but the story goes nowhere, and Steven Mena left out one crucial element of a successful slasher film: give us a character to root for. None of these characters is developed to the point of being sympathetic, and I ended up hoping that the inevitable ending would arrive quickly.",1316908800,2,3851,4.699259259259259

4526564,2,B0051ZIXNK,"Understanding that this is a prequel to the movie Malevolence, this movie may, in fact, be more meaningful than it came off as a standalone, since I cannot attest to how much it ties into the first movie. I understand that these movies are supposed to be a trilogy ultimately with Bereavement as the first installment, Malevolence as the middle, and one more to come after the sequence of both these movies. In general, I haven't seen out of sequence movies work particularly well.  I mean it didn't even work for Star Wars since you know what's going to happen, it's simply an element that's been taken away from the enjoyment. The primary message of this story focuses on the never ending debate of nature vs. nurture.  Can you take a young innocent sweet child and turn them into a psychopath?  To me, this movie was more about natural selection, because the characters in this movie were simply TSTL, too stupid to live.

A young six year old boy, Martin, with a very rare medical condition that enables him to feel no pain, is kidnapped in the beginning of the film by a crazy psychopathic killer.  It's unclear to me if Martin was actually targeted by the killer since he seems to know right away that Martin can feel no pain, but the circumstances of the man's living conditions and the way he's trolling for victims makes it appear more random.  Regardless, we flash forward five years and Martin is still living with the killer and has witnessed five years of stabbing and mutiliation of female after female and the victims are plentiful indeed.  Close by, a teenage Allison comes to live with her uncle and his family after the death of her parents in a car crash.  Allison is withdrawn and rebellious and takes out her pain and frustration by jogging which leads her past the killer's ramshackle home.  When Allison sees Martin in the window time after time, she grows curious and eventually decides to inspect the home where she finds unspeakable horror.

With the synopsis over, let's move on to the TSTL moments.  The movie contains a limitless amount of kidnapped women in what appears to be a very small community where neighbors are miles and miles from one another.  The killer obviously leaves his neighborhood to find his victims, but after so many, you'd think that police/FBI and surrounding area citizens would be leary and on the lookout.  The movie actually takes place from 1989 to the mid 90's and the psychopath grabs his victims in public and broad daylight half the time with a very conspicuous vehicle that apparently no one ever notices.  Not likely.  The victims who are kidnapped apparently only know how to scream in this film and there is absolutely no sense of self preservation.  Apparently when you know your life is on the line, punching, kicking, and arming yourself with the plethora of knives sitting in front of you doesn't occur to anyone.  Just meeting total strangers does not prevent you from accepting a ride with them.  Whatever happened to don't talk to strangers?  During escape attempts, you should simply scream so the killer knows where you are.  And never ever should you call for backup or try to get the police.  It was simply obnoxious and you pretty much want the killing scenes to end because they're all about the gore factor.  This movie is incomplete and disconnected with the timeframe which it takes place. You know every minute with every scream what is going to happen, not only because the first movie pretty much tells you, but the creators of this movie didn't even try to throw a surprise at us.  There's no mystery, police procedure, red herrings or anything else.  It's simply a timeline of how an evangelical madman can raise someone in his image with the help of the incompetent citizens living around him.",1316822400,,3782,4.7214611872146115
4526565,1,B0051ZIXNK,"This movie is on the same sick level as the ""Saw"" movie series.... bloody, cold, violent and sick.  I actually had a hard time watching it but wanted to see it through to the end so I could properly review it.  I know there are those who enjoy watching this kind of movie, but it just isn't something I can recommend.  This movie shows the brutal killing of numerous innocent victims over many years.  The torture and fear the victims endured were equally sickening.  I would urge everyone to avoid this senseless, sick movie.  Whereas it may depict some degenerate part of our society I don't think we need to memorialize it on DVD.",1316736000,2,633,4.508771929824562
4526566,3,B0051ZIXNK,"It's my own fault that I expected more from this movie. I chose it in a rush and based on only one review that said Bereavement is a psychological thriller. Had I researched even a little more I would have quickly learned that Bereavement is a slasher flick.

The movie has a scene in which a teacher very briefly touches on the age old nature versus nurture debate. That is about as psychological as the movie gets.

In the opening scene we meet Martin, a little boy abducted from his home at six years old. Flash forward five years and Martin is living with and witnessing the violent acts of a stab happy maniac. Oooohhhhh... Will Martin end up being a product of his genes (nature) or a product of his experiences (nurture)... The fact that this movie is a prequel is a huge clue.

Character development and plot are lacking, but hey, they really are not that important anyway to this movie. We learn enough about the individual characters to establish the reasons for their decisions (many, many stupid decisions). I was very grateful to not see any scenes in which women wearing high heels run from imminent homicide.

However, adolescent boys will be most grateful for the very generous helping of scenes featuring Alexandra Daddario as the beautiful, tight-tank-top wearing, young, busty heroine. Ms. Daddario was every bit as talented in this movie as she was in ""Percy Jackson & The Olympians."" (For what that's worth.) The other members of the cast were not as easily recognizable to me but performed every bit as well as Ms. Daddario. (Again, for what that's worth.)

If you are a big ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" fan, this movie has many of the same endearing qualities and much higher production values. Personally, I like a lot less blood and gore and more story, but I get that this is a horror film and know that it is right up the alleys of many members of a much younger demographic.

All in all, I didn't hate it.",1316649600,,1930,4.612244897959184
4526567,3,B0051ZIXNK,"As more time goes by, I personally believe it becomes more challenging maybe even difficult to make a horror movie truly scary, fresh and original.  This is mainly due to the plethora of remakes, stale ideas and clichs that submerge the horror genre of film.  As for this independent horror movie named ""Bereavement"", it is able to succeed in some areas and fail miserably in others.

The movie has an interesting plot, rather two plots that end up blending into one.  I actually really like this formula, it was vey engaging.  Story plot one, in 1989 a young boy named Martin who has a rare medical condition that allows him to not feel physical pain is kidnapped.  He is kidnapped by a man who is a psychopath/serial killer named Sutter.  Sutter finds young women, kidnaps them and takes them back to his condemned slaughterhouse and uh...slaughters them.  Now since Martin can't feel pain and he is already a bit touch, Sutter believes Martin is an omen to continue his good work and follow his path of restitution.

Story plot two, fast forward five years later, a 17 year old girl named Allison (played by the attractive Alexandra Daddario) comes to live with her aunt and uncle and 10 year old cousin after her parents die in a car accident.  Allison's uncle is played by Michel Biehn and I have to say I really enjoyed seeing him in a staring role again.  Biehn has a really subtle presence that is so believable.  Well needless to say Allison is ambivalent about staying with her extended family and moving from Chicago to a more rural town.  This promotes some conflict and interesting character development.

Now that Martin has spent five years under Sutters' ""guidance"" it leaves much to interpretation of how watching a man torture and slaughter women can influence one's development. It isn't long before Allison and her family cross paths with Sutter and Martin, which results in some interesting and gory outcomes; it is a horror movie after all.

I have to say that I truly have some mixed feelings about this movie. I found the set up and the pace to be perfect.  The acting was impeccable, for this type of film; there really wasn't a bad performance.  The boy who played Martin did a wonderful job. The unfortunate part was the movie, at least for me, fell apart in the last half hour or so.  The once smooth pace became befuddled, redundant, over the top and suffered so many horror film stereotypes.  I found these pigeonhole movie ruses disenchanting since this movie was doing such a good job of breaking the ""norm"".  Once the film was over, I felt a bit let down.

I didn't realize until after I watched this movie that it is a prequel to ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Malevolence/dp/B0007LPSM2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Malevolence</a>"". I have never seen ""Malevolence"" and am not sure if my viewing of it would really alter my opinion of its predecessor or not.  I do believe that horror fans will enjoy this movie and might like it even more if they have seen ""Malevolence"".  I for one have seen horror movies that are more scary, fresh and original than this one.",1316649600,3,3134,4.816822429906542
4526568,5,B0051ZIXNK,"Been a fan of Malevolence since when it first came out and this entry 'Bereavement' doesn't disappoint at all. A good atmosphere, interesting story and characters, and much more violent than the other. I recommend this to any slasher fan!",1316476800,,238,4.975
4526569,3,B0051ZIXNK,"BEREAVEMENT (2010) is a ghastly exercise in psychopathic misogyny, crimes perpetrated by a violent maniac who adds outrage to the mortal woundings he inflicts in a dungeon-like abbatoir by forcing a six-year-old boy he'd previously kidnapped to watch the slaughtering of bound and sometimes impaled young women. Graham Sutter's murder spree is in response to orders he receives from the skull of a dead bull, which is mounted on a wall in a place of honor. He often has one-sided arguments with this... thing.

Martin's got a condition that doesn't allow him to feel physical injury, so when Sutter slices open his cheek or pins his hand to a wooden table by ramming a carving knife through it, the boy has no reaction. Viewing Sutter's murders does cause young Martin to flee...at first, and try to help some of these condemned girls to escape. It's easy to anticipate what this poor kid will do later in the story.

The first stomach-turning killings are of nameless females. Soon though, we meet a teen named Allison, the uncle and family who adopted her after her folks were killed in a car wreck, also Allison's boyfriend William and his dad, which is essentially a cameo by John Savage. Like his character in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/THE-DEER-HUNTER/dp/0783225997/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">THE DEER HUNTER</a>&nbsp;(1978), here he's confined to a wheelchair, this time because of a construction site accident. An unwashed, unshaven, dissolute alcoholic, Savage makes life miserable for his fledgling auto mechanic son. This part of the story is never really developed, nor is William's relationship with Allison, beyond some late-night necking at a closed drive in theater.

After seeing the drunken father's rantings and having her aunt tells Allison that William's mom committed suicide by hanging, she wanders off to be alone with her thoughts, and ends up at reclusive Sutter's wreck of a slaughterhouse. Unlike the other girls who were dragged there, Allison enters the place on her own, trying to catch six-year-old Martin, whom she noticed was watching her from the other side of a broken window. Sutter soon has his next terrified prisoner.

As they all live near to Sutter's property, Allison's uncle comes looking for her when she stays out all night, and by chance, William spots the uncle's pickup at Sutter's while riding by on his motorcycle and he also comes looking. This  last half-hour of the movie is more demented than anything the Marquis de Sade ever imagined. Outrageous events escalate until at the end we're nauseated by the gore and depravity.

I suppose BEREAVEMENT is a good movie if you like this sort of thing. I came away from it feeling bloodstained and emotionally abused, more so because I hung in to the end, so any sustained ""injury"" was self-inflicted.",1316476800,,2846,5.203056768558952
4526570,1,B0051ZIXNK,"Look, I say this a lot when I give something a one star review- I don't just give out this rating. To get one star, a movie has to legitimately make me mad, and Bereavement did just that in a number of ways. This feels like a Sci-Fi channel original movie that got a slightly better than average budget, and some good looking ladies. Apart from that, there's NOTHING positive I can say about Bereavement. Sure, it breaks a few rules of horror movies here and there, and how everything comes to a close towards the end isn't how most would expect, but that doesn't make it good by any means. Apparently this is a prequel to Malevolence, a movie that rarely got checked out when I worked at a movie store, and I'm definitely not in any hurry to see that one now.

The movie starts out with a young boy named Martin being abducted from his own backyard by a plain looking man, as his [easy on the eyes] mom interviews a potential nanny. He's taken to a slaughter house where the man takes young girls and kills them. Cut to a few years later and we meet the main character, Allison, who has moved from Chicago to the country with her uncle, aunt and niece because her parents died. She's still affected by the loss, and doesn't say much...until she meets a young man that tends to her wounds when she trips during jogging. Her uncle doesn't care for this kid and wants Allison to stay away from him. At the same time, girls are being taken away and brought to the slaughter house where the killer shows Martin his ways so he can follow in his footsteps. Martin hasn't broken free because he has a condition that makes him neutral to everything, and he doesn't feel physical pain either. One day, Allison sees Martin in the abandoned slaughter house as she passes by, and decides to see what's going on. I'm sure you know how that'll turn out.

I don't even know where to begin with my problems, so let me get the good things out of the way first. Yes I'm going to sound like a typical guy here, but good god were the two main actresses hot. Kathryn Meisle as Allison's aunt looked great in every scene she was in. And it was obvious that the director knew what he was doing during Alexandra Daddario's exercise scenes if you know what I mean. She was literally the one thing that held my interest during the movie. Other than that, the movie definitely had more of a budget than it deserved, so a lot of wounds looked fairly decent.

From what the plot summaries on various sites have said, I was expecting this to be a difficult to watch movie, but for different reasons than I ended up with. The cover alone showing a stranger with a young boy is always uncomfortable, and parents will always react stronger to situations like that. The movie starts out with the abduction, and was done well, but then it turns into a basic slasher movie that follows a pattern to the point where I was saying to myself 'here comes the next torture bit' and was right every time. It's hard to get why the antagonist is doing what he's doing too, but it ends up being comical at one point. Either he's crazy, possessed or trying to make up for something that happened a long time ago, or maybe it's all of the above. Who knows? It's never explained. The guy talks to steer skulls he has propped up on walls and other monuments around his home, and there's something covered up in a bed that he talks to. I was hoping that he'd pull the sheets back and reveal an animatronic cow talking to him. That would've made the movie a little more interesting. All of the characters are bland too, and are just there to get the job done in one way or another. I didn't care about any of them aside from Allison and her aunt for the reasons stated above. Characters die in the standard horror movie ways- gunshots, being hit over the head over and over, knives, axes, you name it. And yet you don't get to see a whole lot of it. The gore freaks out there will be disappointed knowing that even something like Children of the Corn showed more than this. Another point to bring up is how the killer is getting away with this for so long when it takes place in such a small town. He keeps a scrapbook of articles and notes about his victims, and it's clear he's been doing this for a long time, so how has no one caught him yet? There's a lot more to talk about but I don't want to ruin the 'shocking ending' for anyone. Let's just put it this way- it's certainly a 'wait...what??' moment, but more in the sense that you don't get why it happened. If you want an ending that really will shock you, watch Oldboy or I Saw the Devil. Bereavement's ending didn't do anything but have me asking 'seriously, you guys went that route?'.

The picture and audio quality were better than the movie itself, and I was grateful for that during key scenes involving Allison. Have I made it clear how much easier she made watching this movie? I didn't see any grain or other problems with the picture, and there were times when I was turning the sound down because the screams got so loud. All in all, no complaints here. Special features include a commentary track and deleted scenes...but they didn't work for me! When I'd select them, nothing happened. This is probably just an error with my disc, but it was good to see that they put something on here. If I had been able to see anything, I probably would've given the dvd a 2 out of 5 instead.

This is the kind of movie that makes me shake my head in shame at what's considered 'horror' these days, and then again at how many people praise something like this. Is it a generation thing? I'm just 26, and not one of those people that says all old horror movies are better than modern ones, but Bereavement isn't helping fight that argument in modern horror's favor. Maybe kids in their mid-teens will get more out of this one, or just people who like anything with blood. I almost want to boost the rating to 2 stars because of the leading ladies and the fact that they did at least put some special features on here, but that's no better than people praising this movie for it's obscenely lame ending and giving it 5 stars because of that.",1316390400,5,6146,4.345517841601392
4526571,1,B0051ZIXNK,"Bereavement is the prequel to Mena's 2007 Malevolence. This movie shows the kidnapping of Martin Bristol, a six year old who cannot feel pain. A demented serial killer with the same condition takes him to make him an apprentice to his butchery of women. The movie progresses showing the child over the next few years as he witnesses and helps clean up after the slaughter of women in a former slaughterhouse. Allison, who loses her parents, comes to live with her uncle who is played by Michael Biehn and is soon drawn into the twisted world of the killer.

That is what the plot is supposed to be. What the movie is happens to be a mess of creative leaps with more holes than the most perforated swiss cheese.

SPOILERS BELOW!!! WARNING!

For example, the killer kidnaps Martin because Martin has the same disease. How does the killer know? Also, this takes place in a very small town. VERY SMALL. Yet, this killer has attacked and butchered dozens of women over the years, including two from this tiny town just in the few months of this movie. I have lived in a town this small. People would know. I promise. Also, the town creep in a small town is the first person a sheriff would shake down should something weird happen. A man takes a shotgun blast from a long distance and is dead instantly. The chances of this happening are very, very small. At every turn, Writer/Director Mena asks you to suspend belief, but you can only suspend yourself for so long before you fall.

Not even Michael Biehn can save this movie. His character is wooden and not very likeable, as his former Kyle Reese or Cpl. Hicks. In this, he mainly complains about the `no good' kid his niece wants to date. I hate seeing him relegated to the roll of grumpy old man.

If you like torture porn just for the torture, I guess there are a few scenes in here for you. But if you want a few incidentals like story, plot, and likeable characters, then get far, far away from this film.",1316304000,3,1958,4.4581005586592175

It has a good cast, that includes Michael Biehn (Aliens, The Terminator), some decent gore, and an interesting storyline. What it lacks is the fun slasher vibe of Malevolence. Malevolence paid homage to some of the slasher greats, such as Halloween and Friday the 13th Part 2, while Bereavement seems to be riding on the Torture Porn wave. There are numerous scenes of women chained up and screaming, and that really didn't sit well with me. The movie redeems itself later on, though, with some cool slice and dice moments. The body count really improves in the second half. And since this a slasher movie, that means the movie really improves in the second half, leading to a satisfactory conclusion that is creepy, if not surprising.",1316217600,,910,4.877419354838709

I could see everything in this story happening in real life. I thought that the plot of the movie was interesting and they really gave you the look inside the mind of a madman. Abducting a child that has no sense of feeling went well with the movie because the killer kept the child around because he could no feel anything and the killer had no feelings. The end of the movie was a little predictable to me but a good ending overall. The blood and gore was pretty good in the film and typical of a slasher/torture flick. If you are into horror movies I would give this a watch because you will more than likely end up enjoying it,but somehow didn't hold your attention much like it should. B",1316131200,,831,4.2
4526575,4,B0051ZIXNK,"There is a refreshing and quite capable hand at work behind the story and camera in Bereavement, the follow up prequel to the surprisingly effective Malevolence.  The period that is evoked of the late 80s is done so without an ounce of music or forced nostalgia just an eye for detail and set direction.  The story that is told is effective and grounded thanks to a lack of unnecessary plot twists and crisp editing and acting.  It had been awhile since I had watched Malevolence but in a way this is more of a remake with better production values than a straight up prequel as the first movie touches on the same story arc in many places.  I am going to assume this was made on a fairly small budget by up and coming Mena and credit goes to his crew and cast for turning in a chilling and engrossing take on a not entirely fresh story.  The soundtrack and cinematography lend this film a mildly surreal air that I would have liked to have stretched further, however if you like an engrossing and harrowing film with believable characters and a little gore then look no further.",1316044800,,1078,4.451776649746193

Eventually the two plot lines converge, but by the time this happened I was to bored to care.

4526577,4,B0051ZIXNK,"Bereavement is a prequel to the painfully average slasher flick Malevolence that improves immeasurably on that predictable and formulaic film and instead follows in the footsteps of the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre while adding in deeper character work and psychological themes to create one of the better modern serial killer films.  Horror fans will not want to miss this one as it is indeed a truly nasty piece of work.  That said, there are plenty of more unrelentingly brutal, gory, and disturbing underground horror flicks out there, but this is one that takes the time to work on a storytelling and character level in addition to making you squirm and question the existence of a loving God.

Bereavement opens up with a nightmare right off the top.  A young boy with a condition that makes him unable to feel pain is abducted by a man driving a vehicle so creepy it should have ""rape-mobile"" painted on the side in blood.  The man is a deranged serial killer working out of his family's abandoned slaughterhouse and seems to take the child's immunity to pain as a sign of divine purity and begins raising him as his successor.  So right away, you can see this won't be a film you'll want to watch on family night.  From there, the narrative splits into sections, expertly following the stories of a young waitress about to have a bad week, the boy and his new surrogate parent, and a city girl moving out to the country to live with her aunt and uncle following the death of her parents.  The stories will converge and you ask yourself once again: who will survive and what will be left of them?

Now, at this point I'd like to point out that for a horror flick, the cast of this film is very strong.  Leading lady Alexandra Daddario...just wow.  Like Megan Fox and  Jessica Biel had an impossible love child destined to be hotter than either of them.  I don't often carry on too much about how gorgeous an actress is in a film review, but I'll make an exception this time.  I really hope to see this girl break out into bigger roles.  Fraternal twins Spencer and Peyton List steal the show performance-wise as the film's two child roles.  Spencer brings the tortured creepiness and Peyton pours on the charm.  Very talented young actors.  Brett Rickaby also plays one hell of a psychopath.  I also seldom praise horror film casts, so consider this a good reason to see the film even if the likes of Leatherface and Jason do little for you.  This is closer in tone to Henry: Portrait of  a Serial Killer meets Wolf Creek in spite of it`s surface resemblance to TCM.  This has none of that film's black comedy.

Okay, bloody death.  It's not an ever-present barrage, but when it happens you feel it like a meat hook through your leg.  Lots of disturbing images to make you gasp and cringe, and rest assured that nobody if off limits to kill or be killed, regardless of age or innocence.  Bereavement forgoes the typical lascivious exploitation present in most slasher films (aside from having the lead actress spend plenty of time in a tank top) in favor of exploring some interesting psychological and social themes as well as explicitly portraying the madness of the film's killer as he continually tries to justify his deeds with contradictory mantras and conversations with imaginary demons.  Disturbing stuff, and very effective in elevating the material a notch above typical slasher/serial killer fare.

Bereavement is a solid horror flick that manages to take the high road in terms of storytelling while still delivering the gore and nastiness we've come to expect from underground horror.  It's not exactly a masterpiece, but it's arguably best TCM-style film since the original classic, so that's something to get excited about.  Seeing Malevolence is not a precursor to enjoying or understanding this film so don't let that stop you. In fact, I recommend skipping Malevolence altogether unless you're on a mission to see every slasher film ever made.  The DVD comes with deleted scenes -some of which were wisely cut and others were actually quite good and creepy in their own right-, but hearing that a lot of the more brutal scenes were cut from the film and not seeing them there was kind of a bummer.  There's also a run-of-the-mill ""making-of"" and a few other knick-knacks, but none of it really essential.  Do stay after the film credits for a parting bit of creepiness, though.  If you're looking for a decent horror flick to make you cringe and think about the nature/nurture debate at the same time, Bereavement may be your stop.  I find most slasher flicks to be little more than a few formulaic cheap thrills and jump scares worthy of three stars at best, but this is one that may be worth your attention.",1315958400,2,4739,4.7168894289185905
4526578,4,B0051ZIXNK,"17 year old Allison comes to live with her uncle in rural Pennsylvania after the deaths of her parents. She finds that her world has been turned upside down in a blink of an eye by some stranger who stole everything from her and now she is forced to give up everything that she has known and come to a new place and become a part of a new family. As she jogs around her new home she meets William, the good-looking but troubled youth who lives down the road, and sees a strange boy in the windows of the old closed down slaughter house. Unknown to her at this time, this story started long before Allison came to Pennsylvania.

The other story and main character within this movie is Graham, a loner in this small town who has some dark secrets.  A huge factor within this movie is the physiological state of Graham's mind and what he sees in the world around him. You can take it many different ways, as in multiple personalities because of the shadows that only he can see and the way his mood changes, or if in fact he really is taking to his dead father or a demon. Graham's story hints around that his own father abused him and taught him everything that he needed to know about slaughtering animals in their family slaughter house. Graham takes his knowledge and his own need on young women who he finds and then murders in his old family business. When the work is too much for him, or maybe he really just wanted someone to clean up after himself Graham abducts a small boy from another town in hopes of making him just like him. The only difference is that the boy, Martin, has a medical disease that he can't feel any type of pain which might be looked as a blessing to this serial killer.

As these two different stories combine into each other, Allison is left fighting not only for her own life but for the lives of her new family. As we travel deeper into the sick mind of a killer many secrets are reveled about the nature of why the killings take place. Graham's haunting words of ""If they have no feelings, they have no fear; but if they have no fear, why do they run?"" are repeated many times but it not until the end when his words finally make sense to himself.  But will Allison be able to save herself and her family? Will Martin ever escape from Graham?

Not to spoil the ending, and for those who have not seen Malevolence, I will leave it up to you to see Bereavement yourselves. The actors did a wonderful job and I have to give applause to Spencer List, who plays Martin, for his outstanding and haunting performance that gave me chills that lasted long after the movie was over. Bereavement is a slasher movie at its best, not for the weak stomach, but doesn't contain an over amount of gore (just what you would expect when slashing someone up) but just enough for this horror movie loving girl to get her fix.",1315785600,,2839,4.318949343339587

I thought I had the movie figured out, but the ending came off as a surprise. The movie sets up for a sequel. Not the worst horror film out there, it just lacks character.

4526580,3,B0051ZIXNK,"Bereavement

This movie started out pretty good. But as it progressed, it became predictable. That isn't to say that it wasn't good, just not as much to scare or thrill you with. The gore factor isn't so bad because the scenes are really dark. I normally watch these kinds of movies so it doesn't bother me as much as it might for someone who doesn't normally view horror movies.

Martin Bristol is kidnapped from his backyard swing set, he is just six years old. He is kidnapped by a serial killer. Because of Martin's disorder, CIPA , the serial killer takes Martin's silence for no fear and finds this an acceptable trait to keep him around to help him clean up his messes. Martin spends years with this serial killer watching him kill.

The characters in Bereavement aren't particularly endearing. What kept my interest mostly was trying to figure out the little boy Martin. The movie touches on the theory of what makes a serial killer- things like environment or what's ingrained in the person that makes them want to kill.

As someone mentioned, this is a prequel to Malevolence. In Malevolence, the little boy, Martin Bristol, from Bereavement is now several years older and is involved with the killings in Malevolence. Bereavement certainly piques my curiosity to see Malevolence again. Malevolence has less substance in the way of background of the killer and after seeing Bereavement it makes it more interesting.
Overall, I think Bereavement is a good flick to rent but I don't think I would spend the money to buy it.",1315699200,,1531,4.787878787878788
4526581,3,B0051ZIXNK,"Okay, I may have misinterpreted other reviews, but one shadow stabbing another shadow is not gorey, is it?  It seems almost censored.  This is NOT FRIGHTENING.  It is suspenseful.  If that's what you like, you'd probably prefer a better plot, or better acting on the part of the serial killer, one of the main roles.  What irritates me most about this movies though is what bothers me for all generic horror movies.  That is... the women screaming, they all seem like the same person with differnt faces.  Their whining and wailing after beening tied up for days seems very implausible.  What would be plausible, go into shock I'd think.  What he does is not much different from crucifixion without the nails, thus shock.  But not so shocking.  Their justification for him killing women is so absurd, it's hysterical.  You can't take this movie seriously on many levels.  Highly overrated",1315612800,,888,4.879194630872483

4526583,2,B0051ZIXNK,"I got this thinking it was a horror movie, and not knowing that it is a prequel to Malevolence, which I had not heard of. I had never seen a slasher movie, and did not know this was one of those.

It turns out there is a big difference between horror and slasher genres. Whereas a horror movie (Hitchcock's Psycho, The Exorcist, The Omen) builds suspense, fear, tension, or mystery, this movie did not waste time on these. The bad guy easily captures his prey, then keeps them around until he decides to kill them. For each of the 12 or so killings, it goes pretty much the same way. With a few (e.g. the rescuers) he kills them right away.

I guess the slasher genre is a bit like pornography - it's about the action; you don't want a plot to get in the way. Like porn, the action here does involve tools plunged repeatedly into young women's torsos, but the tools in this case are long and narrow knives used to stab their bellies. Where porn is judged mainly by quality and quantity of the action; this slasher movie scores high on quantity but low on quality of the gorey action.

The movie does not focus on realism. Each young woman starts screaming hysterically at the beginning of her scene, before anyone is threatening them or even nearby. They scream without interruption, and it actually grows in intensity as they are being stabbed. In real life, surgical modifications from the knife would cause their screams to change into other utterances, or stop as their diaphragm is unable to push air to their vocal cords. But like pornography, this is not real life, and such details are not important.

The bad guy is being harrassed by his dead father (a shadow, or a shrowuded figure on a bed), or by one of the horned steer skulls inside or around his dad's ruined meat packing factory. He talks about how they don't have feelings so they don't have fear, perhaps referring to the animals processed there; this is as much insight as we get into his background. Early on he kidnaps a six-year-old boy who has a disease that prevents him from feeling pain, and the implication is that he has no psychological feeling either. How these story elements fit together, or what relationship they have to the title, remains unclear to me.

A second plot line starts when a young lady with large breasts arrives in the same town to live with her aunt and uncle. How will this second plot line intersect with the first? Oh, the drama!

The movie is predictable. I guessed the plot resolution during the first five minutes. In most cases, I knew what was going to happen next. The plot surprised me a little when each of the two would-be rescuers went down so easily, as I thought they might build tension by having the victim have a chance of being saved.

Steven Mena is the creative force behind this movie: he is the screenwriter, director, producer, editor, sound effects person, and he wrote the sound track. In fact, he is not without talent: the movie has reasonable production values, and the cinematography is at times rather good. I think in the future efforts he should find someone else to write the script.

I discovered that among the extras is an audio commentary by Mena. I'm tempted to listen to it to see what Mena has to say for himself. I wish the extras included bloopers - where something goes impossibly wrong in the slashing and both characters start laughing at unexpected results.

If you watch this movie, be sure to keep watching at the end, because the final scene is shown after the end credits run. It forms the segue-way to Malevolence.

Two stars. I don't think the violence would be very satisfying to those craving that, because it is of low quality and usually about the same. The story is uninteresting. One extra star for the decent production values.",1315440000,,3788,4.573746312684365
4526584,4,B0051ZIXNK,"Six-year-old Martin Bristol is the victim of a random kidnapping.  Held prisoner in an abandoned, isolated slaughterhouse, he is forced to watch the psychopathic Graham Sutter (Brett Rickaby of ""The Crazies"") butcher innocent women as though they were cattle.  Five years later, an orphaned teenager, Allison (Alexandra Daddario of ""Percy Jackson & The Olympians""), comes to live with her uncle, Jonathan Miller (Michael Biehn of ""The Terminator"").  Jogging by the Sutter slaughterhouse, she glimpses Martin peering out of a window.  One day, while investigating the slaughterhouse, she is captured by Graham Sutter and a horrendous nightmare of events soon follows.

  Stevan Mena's ""Bereavement"" is a prequel to the slasher film ""Malevolence,"" which was released in 2004 and has obtained a cult following.  Also written, produced and directed by Mena,  ""Malevolence"" is a low budget film that chronicles what happens to a group of bank robbers who encounter a malevolent, Jason Voorhees-like serial killer, Martin Bristol.  Anyone who enters his domain dies.  Cursed with a rare neurological disorder that prevents him from feeling pain, he is a super serial killer.  Unfortunately, ""Malevolence"" has the look and feel of a homemade film.  The acting is amateurish, the plot is predictable and the scares few.  It is mediocre slasher fare that had a lot of potential but the proper funding was not there.

  The potential became reality with ""Bereavement"" thanks to a higher budget, professional acting and innumerable shocks and twists that made the film extremely suspenseful, especially during the last fifteen minutes.  As with many horror films, the audio commentary and ""making of"" featurettes for ""Bereavement"" are not only interesting and enjoyable, but educational.  All the extra features are essential viewing.  I was better able to understand the extent of Graham Sutter's psychosis.  When he was a child, he was abused by his father, which resulted in him becoming a serial killer.  Every man desires to pass his ""special talents"" on to his son.  Thus we have the kidnapping of Martin.  Whereas ""Malevolence"" was strictly slasher horror, ""Bereavement,"" as explained by Stevan Mena, is psychological horror.  He desired to emphasis the affects of a murder/death on an entire family.  Indeed, every character in the cast had experienced the death of a family member.

  Interestingly enough, Mena tells his viewers that he actually lived near an infamous serial killer on Long Island.  This greatly influenced ""Malevolence.""  The genuine horror is when the viewer learns that the events in ""Bereavement"" are quite plausible.  Thousands of children, and adults, disappear every year.  What happens to these people?  Also, while traveling from my hometown of Knoxville, Tennessee to Chesapeake, Virginia, I encounter a lot of rural countryside where I see many dilapidated, decaying structures similar to the Sutter slaughterhouse.  Who is living in them and what are they doing?  Conceivably, a serial killer could be living next door to you without your knowledge.

  ""Bereavement"" reminded me of such ground-breaking classics as ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre,"" ""Deranged"" and ""Three on a Meathook,"" which are all based on the infamous, true-life serial killer Ed Gein.  The parental abuse of Graham Sutter, and the subsequent hallucinations which he experiences, is supposedly influenced by the character of Norman Bates in ""Psycho.""  Due to its graphic, gory, tortuous content, ""Bereavement"" is not intended for the timid and faint of heart.  However, I highly recommend it for fans of slasher films, especially the aforementioned classics.

  If you've already seen ""Malevolence,"" then you can easily ascertain how ""Bereavement"" will end.  However, if you haven't, you are destined for a genuine treat. I recommend watching ""Bereavement"" first and then renting or buying an inexpensive copy of ""Malevolence,"" which is exactly what I did.  (Many of the same on-location sets were used in both films and the continuity is good considering the films were released at least six years apart.)  According to Stevan Mena, there are plans for a third installment depicting the final outcome of the grown Martin Bristol. I will definitely be adding that one to my slasher flick collection.

Having loved MALEVOLENCE, a straight-forward, fantastically bleak shocker, I looked forward to this prequel. BEREAVEMENT is even better than MALEVOLENCE, in that it has a far more fleshed-out story, more character depth, and is even more wicked in its delivery! Writer / Producer / Director, Stevan Mena, like Ti West, is well-versed in retro-horror, and is great at taking ordinary situations and plunging them into madness. The juxtaposition of rural family life and abduction / sadism is jarring as we watch normality switched back and forth w/ murderous insanity. Two very different types of ""child-rearing"" are presented, and they collide in the catastrophic finale. BEREAVEMENT can be watched either before or after seeing MALEVOLENCE.

I have been waiting a long time for this to come out and wasn't disappointed.
It was beautifully shot and the lighting was great. The acting was above par ,Alexandra Daddario is not only beautiful but an amazing actress and Michael Biehn has long been a favorite actor of mine since his debut in the 1981 slasher film ""The Fan"".

It wasn't over the top gory but it was quite bloody and there were a couple of scenes that will leave a gore hound like myself satisfied.
If you saw Malevolence you will know exactly whats going on and even if you didn't see it, it won't take long to figure it out. It has a rich look to it not that cheap or low budget feel .

There were many scenes that might have gone somewhat unnoticed or the importance overlooked that dealt with loss,loss being a huge part of the story in all area's. The last scene with John Savage was a very powerful scene and an important one as well. It's rare that a film is heart tugging yet filled with such real horror as well.
