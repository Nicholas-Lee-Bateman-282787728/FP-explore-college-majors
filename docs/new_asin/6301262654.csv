7811129,5,6301262654,"This is a fantastic music video for toddlers. My two year old son would watch it all day if he could. The songs are so much fun, and not at all annoying for his mums! I wish this would be re-issued on DVD.",1178841600,,205,3.7906976744186047
7811130,5,6301262654,"I also bought this video on Ebay and enjoy it very much. It is an hour of concert clips from Sharon, Lois & Bram's Elephant Show (Series 1) and of Eric Nagler. It is a little dated, but the music is still great. Full of all the Sharon, Lois & Bram classic songs such as ""Tingalayo"" and others. Your child may or may not listen through the whole tape, but if you are a Sharon, Lois & Bram fan, this is a definite keeper. However, this is still a great video.",1159488000,,457,4.032967032967033
7811131,5,6301262654,"I remember watching this back when I was younger.  I'm 19 now and I still love watching it.  Compared to shows today, this is the bomb.  Its light hearted.  I still own this video.  When I have kids they will know the Elephant Show.",1145664000,,232,4.181818181818182
7811132,5,6301262654,"There were, I think, 65 episodes of the original ""Elephant Show."" Anyone who cares about children's television should become familiar with them. The fact that they are out of print is criminal. And the fact that you can't see them on American television is also criminal.
This particular episode, Soap Box Derby, features the sidekick, Eric Nagler, driving a soapbox derby car down a street and singing as it falls apart, piece by piece, with his brilliant commentary (jokes that is).
As with all SLB/Elephant show episodes, this is filled with great songs and silly patter, appealing to not just kids but adults too. My one year old daughter loves these shows, and my fifteen year-old will still watch and talk about how great they are. I hear that Lois has quit performing, which is truly a shame, because ""you are terrific!"" has long been part of my daily song to my baby. Fifteen years now. Thanks you guys. I love you more than you can know.",1086912000,,946,4.6706586826347305
7811133,5,6301262654,"Sharon, Lois and Bram's The Elephant Show is possibly one of the best ever childrens' series. It's imaginative, funny, entertaining, addictive, and educational. It's especially fun if you're from Toronto ( like I am ) and can actually see the areas of the city where Sharon, Lois and Bram romped around in. I saw this series through reruns on the Canadian channel TVO ( for the first two years they were new episodes, I think ). It's been a major influence to me. I love the show. The songs are amazing
( and from literally everywhere. From folk tunes and show tunes to a Monty Python tune (!) ) and the episodes are endlessly brilliant. They're even inventive in form and style, never stooping too low as to think that kids might be too young to appreciate it. Some of the episodes are in skit form, and some have Sharon, Lois and Bram acting as different characters throughout the entire episode ( like the witty Three Little Pigs episode with Eric Nagler as the Big Bad Wolf ). Also alongside the three main stars were a host of kids ( some of whom we get to see grow up on the show, which is a real treat as you rewatch them from year to year ) and the mute Elephant. The Elephant conveys all of his ( or her, depending on the season ) emotions, thoughts and feelings through physical comedy. And the show itself pages through bizarre and even occasionally surreal episodes. Like the one where, because of a broken down tour bus, Sharon, Lois and Bram, not to mention their back-up band, has to drive for miles and miles and miles by wagons, tricycles, or bikes. During the show there were episodes where Bram walked on the ceiling, where a mysterious rope once pulled deposited piles and piles of shelled peanuts, and where we continually got to see really strange stuff through fantasies ( the broken down tour bus episode turns out to be but * spoiler alert * a dream ). And then there's the episode ( you see it all the time in reruns ) where Elephant ends up high in a tree and is scared to come down ( how did it happen ? Don't ask. )
It's a surprisingly sophisticated childrens' show. Are small kids too young to appreciate such things ? I doubt it. I think it takes the kids' show to a higher level. It did for Canadian childrens' T.V. what M*A*S*H did for sitcoms.
Watch it. Both you and your kids will enjoy it for years to come.",1027987200,,2343,4.363844393592677
