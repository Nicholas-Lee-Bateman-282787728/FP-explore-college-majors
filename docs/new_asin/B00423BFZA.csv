8600076,4,B00423BFZA,"In November 2010 RaiTrade finally released this title on 3 DVD's in PAL format. This is the first time the film is being released commercially. An edited 135 minutes version has been produced for cinema (presented at the Venice Film Festival in 1986), but that version has never been released on VHS or DVD.

Outstanding cast (Claudia Cardinale at her best), great cinematography by Luigi Comencini, deeply touching story based on a novel by Italian writer Elsa Morante, and presented in its full length (240 minutes)! The film was initially produced for TV in 1986, and divided into 3 episodes. Every DVD contains an episode. The outer box and the separate booklet is carefully conceived, but there's no interesting additional content on the DVD's. I think the picture quality could have been much better. I see no digital restoration whatsoever. And unfortunately the sound track is mono, just like the original TV-film. Maybe because the initial production was mainly focused on TV, the sound track was not recorded in stereo. At that time Italian TV wasn't (technically) ready to air TV-programmes with stereo sound for many years to come!

Furthermore there's another problem: the target of this release is mainly focused on Italy. So there are no subtitles in other languages. Strangely enough not even Italian subtitles are added, so impaired hearing Italians are neglected as well, quite bizar. Conclusion: if you don't speak or at least understand some Italian, you'd better skip this version, unfortunately. The Amazon description gives wrong information here. Let's hope distributors outside Italy buy the rights for this great film real soon and release it with proper digital restoration and subtitles in a few main languages.

Despite the problems with this Italian release, I still give it 4 stars, because I am so thrilled that 'La Storia' is finally available on DVD.",1322697600,7,1884,5.130293159609121
