1181354,5,B000003NDA,"Farewell My Lovely, isn't currently unavailable on DVD...and that is why I wanted to purchase this particular VHS. I am very pleased with its quality, and highly recommend this film to any and all who love Mitchum! He is PERFECT in this role, as the aging [Raymond Chandler's], ""Marlowe"" -- ferreting out criminals amongst a host of ""down and dirty"" elements -- between swank and sleaze -- in a 40's Noir thriller that demands and rivits your attention, throughout.

But I will forever remember this movie as a young teen, sitting in the theatre, when it first came out in the 1970's. I sat and watched it over and over and over again! I've always loved Robert Mitchum, always loved Film Noir and this Movie has it all. Mitchum was a great actor and this is by far his greatest role, his greatest acting in his long career. The acting, the cinematography, the music, all great! Yes, lots of previous versions from the 30's, etc which were also good, but this one is NOT good, it is GREAT! This could have been and has the exact great look of a 30's, 40's, 50's noir. I cant say enough about this flick, so I'll stop now! If you like film noir, Robert mitchum, mysteries, an excellent movie, then you've got to see this one. Not only see it, but experience it!",1200960000,2,987,4.119170984455959

1181371,3,B000003NDA,"Better of the Two. This, the second adaptation of Raymond Chandler's novel, is much closer to the source text than the original - Murder, My Sweet (1944), which tended to avoid some of the sleazier parts of the plot - but still concerns private eye Philip Marlowe's attempts to locate Velma, a former dancer at a seedy nightclub and the girlfriend of Moose Malloy,

More Like a Movie of the Week.  Grizzled American private detective in England investigates a complicated case of blackmail turned murder involving a rich but honest elderly general, his two loose socialite daughters, a pornographer and a gangster.",1519603200,,614,5.009803921568627
1181372,5,B000003NDA,"I enjoyed reading Raymond Chandler's Philip Marlowe novels while in college and I saw Farewell, My Lovely when it originally played in the movies.  I loved it and Robert Mitchum immediately became my favorite Marlowe, with his trench coat and fedora and world-weary dialogue and demeanor.  He is absolutely perfect in the role.  The supporting cast is excellent featuring a gorgeous Charlotte Rampling, John Ireland, Anthony Zerbe, Sylvia Miles, Harry Dean Stanton and a young Sylvester Stallone.  The sets are perfect, the dialog hard-boiled , this is a great nourish type detective film and Mitchum makes one forget Bogart in The Big Sleep.
This film is accompanied by Mitchum's other Marlowe film, The Big Sleep.  Unlike Farewell, My Lovely this film is an aberration taking place not in the 1940s but the 1970s and moving the locale from the seedy Los Angeles of the Marlowe novels to London.  Marlowe is still world-weary but now well-dressed with a nice clean office unlike the dump he worked out of in the previous film.  This film does also have a terrific supporting cast including Sarah Miles, Oliver Reed, Candy Clark, Sir John Mills, Richard Boone and the great James Stewart.  This film absolutely bombed in the theaters and, to be truthful, moving Marlowe to present time and changing the locale was a dreadful idea.
The picture quality on The Big Sleep is superior to Farewell, My Lovely which is kind of grainy.  The Big Sleep features a few special features including a current interview with Sarah Miles who indicates that she only did the film because Mitchum asked her to and really did not care much for it.  There is also an interview with the director, Michael Winner.
You might enjoy this version of The Big Sleep to some extent but the Blu-ray is certainly worth getting for Farewell, My Lovely, an absolutely terrific film.  I highly recommend it.",1519603200,3,1873,4.8955696202531644
1181373,5,B000003NDA,"Okay, let's get some things straight for the armchair experts who ""review"" films as if they know what they're talking about.  There is NO aspect ratio controversy for either of these films - they were shot and framed for projection in 1.85 and never intended to be seen with the entire frame exposed.  There is no discussion about this, period.  Next, if the Blu-ray is indeed 1.78 who cares - that is a sliver of information and given the variables of actual theater projection, meaningless.  There is no discussion about this, period.  Now that we're past that - the films and their transfers.  DVD Beaver likes but doesn't love the transfers, feeling Big Sleep has some waxiness.  So, let's get that out of the way: He's an idiot and doesn't know what he's talking about, as there's not an iota of waxiness anywhere.  He thinks Farewell, My Lovely isn't quite good enough.  So, here's the thing: Both transfers are just fine and certainly look better than the actual release prints, as they're clearer, but these transfers resemble a new release print - it's what these two movies looked like.  Anyone who doesn't understand that simply knows nothing about film, film stock, or what things looked like when.

Farewell, My Lovely is obviously the better film.  Wonderful period sets, great score by David Shire, good direction by Dick Richards, and the cast is terrific straight down the line.  The Big Sleep is certainly interesting and has good actors, but the switch to England and making it current to the time in which it was made was a huge mistake and it never recovers from it.  Michael Winner's direction is uninspired, there's a good score by Jerry Fielding but it also exacerbates the ""modern"" feeling of what is not a modern tale, and the photography is certainly decent.  It's lovely to have them both on one Blu-ray and if you're a fan of Mitchum or Chandler I can't imagine anyone being disappointed in this release.  I find Farewell, My Lovely much preferable to Murder, My Sweet, but I'm probably in the minority on that.

So, bottom line - ignore the dopes who are talking about the aspect ratio because they are just parroting incorrect information they read somewhere.  And ignore any comments that these transfers aren't up to snuff because they most assuredly are.",1519516800,7,2288,4.793367346938775
1181374,5,B000003NDA,"""Farewell, My Lovely"" is a tremendous motion picture.  Charlotte Rampling is hot!  Robert Mitchum (Phillip Marlowe) is cool!  This is another in that rare genre of ""they don't make 'em like that anymore.  Read the novel first and then watch this excellent DVD-Blu Ray.

The movie differs a little from what I recall reading in the novel, but all movies from books usually do.  It does not suffer by this comparison.

This will have me looking for more Rampling films and more Mitchum Films on Amazon.

I will screen ""The Big Sleep"" on another night.",1519344000,,549,4.705263157894737
1181375,4,B000003NDA,"One good and one bad. I enjoyed Farewell, my lovely. Very rare movie. Robert Mitchum is great. Cameos by Sylvester Stallone. This one is a mixed bag. Keeps you interested from beginning to end.

The second movie I found uninteresting. Totally opposite. I find the Humphrey Bogart version of The Big sleep to be more interesting and superior. Felt like I was watching nothing but Mercedes cars for an hour and a half. Mitchum trying to act like Bogart. The scene in the book store inferior to the Bogart version. And then you have Candy American Graffiti Clark topless and acting all goofy.

Blu Ray : picture is 5/5. Audio 5/5.
Farewell my lovely 5/5
The big sleep 78 3/5
Worth it for Farewell my lovely.
Big sleep : Bogart is better. Some may disagree and those are free to do so.",1519257600,,781,4.492957746478873
1181376,3,B000003NDA,"Fans of film Noir probably agree that Robert Mitchum is either the best or the next best thing to a Noir 'hero'. He has the world-weary attitude, the 'white knight' complex, but he can kill you if you force him to. Here he takes on two Raymond Chandler best sellers. Films of these books have been done by others, notably Bogart and Bacall in Big Sleep. However, I was glad I watched these blu releases because these stories played out a little more logically this time, or maybe I've seen them so many times that I'm beginning to get it. The 1944 'Big Sleep' is especially confusing, and you probably know that Chandler himself, when asked, said something to the effect that he didn't know what it was about either. This time around I understood who killed who - lots of murders, murderers, and motives in both these movies. The blu ray upgrades these movies nicely but not perfectly. They are newer (1978) and originally done in color to begin with which helps. The wailing jazz in 'Farewell' sets this movie up well. It's like meeting old friends to see Sylvester Stallone in a bit part in 'Farewell', or an an aging Jimmy Stewart and even a deteriorating Richard Boone in 'Sleep'..Why the three stars? While I love murder mysteries, these are too depressing for me. I would love to see Philip Marlowe happy for once, but that is not to be. Setting 'Sleep' in London makes for interesting backgrounds (Thanks to director Michael Winner for insisting on shoot in real places) but the British take is distracting - Oliver Reed as Eddie Mars could do menacing phones it in, Joan Collins - also meh. Edward Fox, as Joe in the film, has had a lively career in England, as his family is as prolific in producing actors as the Barrymores. He actually acts in the scenes he is in. Sarah MIles is no Bacall and the girl who plays her crazy sister is so psychotic you wonder why they hadn't locked her up years ago. John MIlls is stoic as a Scotland Yard inspector. John Ireland's 'McNulty' in 'Farewell' is much better as a Noir 'cop' who is just as world-weary as Marlowe. I'm talking myself into  thinking I should give 'Farewell' a four star rating. 'nuff said'.",1519257600,,2159,4.5501285347043705
1181377,5,B000003NDA,"Remarkable bargain:
Shout Factory issued these films on two DVDs in 2015:
Three years later, they are coupled on a single Blu-Ray at half the price.
Same transfer, but both films look sharper and clearer on Blu-Ray.

All bonus features from 2015 are carried over to the Blu-Ray:
-- English SDH subtitles for both films
-- original theatrical trailer for both films
-- Maxim Jakubowski, proprietor of London's Murder One Bookshop, discusses Raymond Chandler's detective Philip Marlowe (7 minutes)
-- The Big Sleep on Location: featurette comparing London film locations in 1978 and 2015, plus interview with director Michael Winner (14 minutes)
-- Making of The Big Sleep: vintage featurette from 1978 (6 minutes)
+ One newly filmed interview:
-- Actress and Big Sleep co-star Sarah Miles reminisces about Robert Mitchum, filmed in 2017 (7 minutes)

Three years ago, there was some controversy about the aspect ratio on the DVDs.
IMDB (Internet Movie Data Base) confirms that both films were released to theaters in 1:85 to 1 aspect ratio (the industry standard in the 1970s).
Modern TVs are 1:78 to 1, which is the aspect ratio listed on the box.
If a 1:85 to 1 picture is formatted to 1:78 to 1, you will lose a small amount at the sides.
Surprisingly, the aspect of this Blu-Ray is variable, depending on whether the picture size setting of my Sony blu-ray player is set to ""normal"" or ""wide"".
Counter-intuitively, the ""normal"" setting results in a wider picture.
You can make the ""normal"" vs. ""wide"" comparison using your blu-ray player (press the pause button to freeze the frame).
The actual picture quality is impressive.

Robert Mitchum (1917-1997) was the perfect film noir actor and would have been the perfect Philip Marlowe.
Unfortunately Mitchum's big Hollywood breakthrough didn't come until 1947 (Crossfire and Out of the Past):
Too late for the first wave of Marlowe films.
By the time Mitchum finally got around to playing Marlowe in 1975, he was 58 years old and looked every bit of it (despite the hair coloring).
Even so, 'Farewell My Lovely' is a great Philip Marlowe film (and a great film).
Three years later, at age 61, he repeated the role in a remake of The Big Sleep.
Both remakes are extremely faithful to Chandler,
except that instead of 1940s Los Angeles, this Big Sleep was set in 1970s London.
A horrible, terrible, awful idea.
A redeeming feature is actor Richard Boone in one of his final roles as evil henchman Lash Canino.

FIRST WAVE 1942-47:
Raymond Chandler's first four novels featuring private eye Philip Marlowe were published between 1939 and 1943:
""The Big Sleep"", ""Farewell My Lovely"", ""The High Window"", and ""Lady in the Lake"".
Raymond Chandler was a hot Hollywood property: All four novels were bought to the screen in six black & white films with six different actors.
(see end of this review for Amazon links)
The first two were B-movies, and Marlowe's name was changed for the screen:
--- 1942: Lloyd Nolan in 'Time to Kill' (based on ""The High Window"").
This was the seventh and last time Lloyd Nolan played wise-cracking detective Michael Shayne (Lloyd Nolan would have made an excellent Philip Marlowe).
--- 1943: George Sanders in 'The Falcon Takes Over' (based on ""Farewell My Lovely"", with Ward Bond as Moose Malloy).
This was the third of four films starring George Sanders as Gay Laurence, the British gentleman detective known as ""the Falcon"".
I loved George Sanders as the Falcon (and the Saint), but he was never a hard-boiled private eye.
--- 1944: Dick Powell in 'Murder My Sweet' (based on ""Farewell My Lovely"") and
--- 1946: Humphrey Bogart in 'The Big Sleep' : Two Cinema Classics.
--- 1947: You and Robert Montgomery in 'Lady in the Lake'.
Not a cinema classic, but it is a lot of fun: Filmed using the first-person camera technique, an early form of ""virtual reality"".
On the plus side, you get to make out with a lot of beautiful dames.
On the negative side you get punched in the face a lot.
--- 1947: George Montgomery in 'The Brasher Doubloon' (based on ""The High Window"")
Just OK.

SECOND WAVE 1969-78
Three additional novels were published before Chandler's death in 1959.
In film, there was a 22 year break following The Brasher Doubloon until the first modern Philip Marlowe film:
1969s Marlowe starring James Garner (sort of a prequel to ""The Rockford Files"").
It made the mistake of pitting Marlowe against a bunch of hippies in 1969 Los Angeles.
In 1973 Elliot Gould starred in The Long Goodbye: A great film, but a Robert Altman film, not a Philip Marlowe film.
The two Robert Mitchum films from 1975 and 1978 were the last in this second wave of Marlowe films.

POSTSCRIPT: POODLE SPRINGS
On his death in 1959, Raymond Chandler left behind an unfinished manuscript, ""The Poodle Springs Story"".
Chandler finished the first four chapters, which were published in 1962 in the anthology ""Raymond Chandler Speaking"".
In 1988, detective writer Robert Parker (Spenser) finished the novel, contributing an additional 37 chapters
(9% Chandler, 91% Parker).
Published as ""Poodle Springs"", it depicts an older, married Philip Marlowe.

In 1998 HBO commissioned a film, starring James Caan as Marlowe.
Screenplay by Tom Stoppard (who won the Academy Award for ""Shakespeare in Love"" that same year).
Never issued on DVD or download in the U.S. or the U.K:
It is available on Region 2 DVDs from Germany and Spain.
You can order it from Amazon UK or Amazon Deutschland, but you will need a region-free DVD player (or it can be viewed on most computers).
I saw it on HBO twenty years ago.

1181391,5,B000003NDA,"Movie 7 of 1975 and 28 overall in my journey through films of my lifetime.

I was only going to give a movie five stars if it met an important criterion: it must have re-watchability and I could recommend it with the confidence that I would with all of my absolute favorites. If a movie met this standard my mission to find a gem from the past would be complete (although that's not the singular goal of my journey). While ""Farewell My Lovely"" didn't actually meet either of my criteria I do believe I have a found a first gem in my journey. I love PI movies/stories. A friend of mine pointed out that all of my stories that I have written have a place for a PI in almost all of them. I hated to admit it but he was right. I'm fascinated by this kind of character and can't turn away.
A major assumption that was possessing me as I watched this was that this was a homage to classic noir films of the past. Mitchum was in many of these movies as a younger actor and this type of film was trending at this time as I was understand. So I think my assumption was safe. If that is what was intended in this film I must say that I have nothing but supreme appreciation for the project. In later times these films have been parodied like ""The Adventures of Ford Fairlane"" or twisted in creative ways like ""Angel Heart."" As a Gen Xer I have to say that they didn't sour my taste for this in the least. I was smiling from ear to ear with great pleasure at every bit of dialog and action scene and betrayal, yes delicious BETRAYAL! Today it should come off campy but in truth I think it was meant to come off as a tip of the hat to an era gone by and camp was just fine if that's what needed to happen to make it authentic. Robert Mitchum's performance was just perfect. He didn't deserve any awards or anything his personality and presence was an advantage. The noir elements were fantastic and actually not heavy handed. There were scenes I think David Lynch would have LOVED from a repetitive, lonely dog barking in the background to a brothel and a drug induced abstraction that comes out of nowhere and could not have been more welcome. This movie hit all the right notes. The music was outstanding and proves, to me anyway, that 70's films could have had more appropriate music that actually sounded good, set the mood, or reflected it.
Pros
-noir perfection visually and not too much of it
-hard boiled PI to a T
-gritty story with the scenery to boot
-pitch perfect music
Cons
-some elements will seem campy to modern viewers (bad ADR, off sound effects, etc.)",1512864000,2,2559,4.298136645962733

Mitchum brings a great weariness and street smart to the role that other actors like Bogart and Dick Powell didn;t provide.

Its a noble effort, but even with the cars, the clothes, and the color photography, the L.A. in the film, and everyone in it somehow seem to feel more like the Hollywood of the seventies -- trying to look like the L.A. of the '40s.  An original plot device or two is left in from the novel, and couple are changed.

The film is worth it if you're a real fan of Raymond Chandler and Marlowe (and I am), but in comparison to 1944's changed-title version ""Murder, My Sweet,"" even with Mitchum as Marlowe, its lacking..",1470700800,8,716,4.804878048780488

1181429,3,B000003NDA,"Great movie. . . Lousy transfer.

First off, aspect ratio. Farewell, My Lovely was not shot in a wide screen aspect. It was shot (and composed) in 1.37 to 1. I own both the Shout! Release AND the Pioneer 1999 release. The opening scene shows the problem. In the 4X3 OAR, you hear Robert Mitchum's voice over while slowly panning up the hotel window, starting with the full sign at the bottom, ending in a nicely framed shot of Mitchum's head, with the framing top of the window. In the Shout! vertical crop, the pan is hurried, and you never see the full sign at the bottom, OR Mitchum's complete head. Both have been cropped off, and the PACING of the pan no longer match the pacing of Mitchum's words.

Second, the color pallete. Yes, this is a color movie. However, the colors are dull and dingy, <by design!>. This is a modern Film Noir, and dull and dingy are part of the storytelling. The Shout! transfer genned up the colors, to the point of blowout, on several scenes. This movie is not supposed to be bright and showy, just the opposite.

The movie is still a great movie. I would love to see a 4X3 blu ray of it. . .",1461110400,13,1126,4.30188679245283

1181431,5,B000003NDA,"Perfect-pitch adaptation of the Raymond Chandler novel, from sets, music, props, storytelling, and cast. Robert Mitchum gives Bogart a run for his money as THE ultimate Philip Marlowe, and ravishing Charlotte Rampling gives her Bacallesque best as the sultry dame involved. Though most of the cast is British (John Ireland, Jack O'Halloran, Anthony Zerbe, Rampling herself, etc. watch out for a young Sylvester Stallone as one of the usual goons.

Along with ""Chinatown"", a ""new-noir"" that takes from the classics to improve on them. Not an easy task; compare it with the abominable ""Long Goodbye"" made by Robert Altman, or the abysmal ""Marlowe"" played by James Garner. Unfortunately, Mitchum's Marlowe follow up, a remake of ""The Big Sleep"", made the same mistake as the aforementioned fiascos, setting the story in 1970's London, proving once again you don't mess with success.",1456012800,,879,5.2785714285714285

1181440,4,B000003NDA,"This is one of my all time favorite movies.  I can't say for sure if the 40s were really like this- I am a wee bit too young for that, but it sure feels like this movie takes the viewer back to that time-  the atmosphere seems perfect, as are the performances of all in the movie.  I have read all the Phillip Marlowe novels- for the most part the world weary narration in them sounds suspiciously like Robert Mitchum.  For detective movies, for any kind of movie, this one is very special to me.

I waited a long time for a DVD of this movie.  Unfortunately there is good news and bad news.  The good news is that the picture is clear and the sound is good.  The bad news is that this movie is formatted to the HD TV aspect ratio to fill the whole screen.  There is a copy of this movie on YouTube, and that picture is defiantly wider.  In the dance hall the woman Marlowe eventually dances with sits fully in frame at one end of the picture, and Marlowe stands at the other.  In the DVD version Marlowe steps into the frame, but the woman is half cut off.  This is not a deal breaker- the DVD picture is OK the way it is, but if you want to see the whole frame as shot, the sides are missing and it seems the movie is a little cut off vertically as well.

Special features are 2 trailers and optional english subtitles.

It's worth it to have a good copy of this movie, but a bit disappointing that the original aspect ratio has not been preserved.  I will not be returning this copy- I waited too long for that.  But if the correct aspect ratio version ever comes out, I will buy this movie again.",1447977600,20,1600,4.112903225806452

1181447,5,B000003NDA,"Fans of film noir movies should see this. Robert Mitchum is the king of the film noir genre, and while it is easy enough to buy some of his classics, such as ""Out of the Past"" and ""The Night of the Hunter"", this film is rare and expensive, particularly if you want it as a region one DVD.

Mitchum made this film in 1975 some 20 years after the height of his career as a leading man in this kind of film, but he is still a powerful figure as Raymond Chandler's tough-guy detective Philip Marlowe. World-weary and tired, Mitchum is still a charismatic figure in the film.

 This movie is said to be a closer adaptation of Raymond Chandler's ""Farewell My Lovely,"" than the earlier adaptation, ""Murder My Sweet"" (1944). Of the two films, I certainly like the newer, 1975 film better than the 1944 adaptation.

It is a typically gritty story of heartbreak and murder set in old Los Angeles. The convoluted plot riddled with dead-ends is also typical of Chandler. This is a very well done film noir detective story.",1359244800,,1010,4.502732240437158
