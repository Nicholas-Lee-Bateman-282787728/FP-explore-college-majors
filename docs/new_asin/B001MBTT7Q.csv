The Cavah seemed to want to sit around and have deep mushroom-fueled meaning of life conversations, but Will Oldham seemed like he just wanted to enjoy life.  That is all I have to say about that.",1389744000,,318,4.448275862068965
8547713,3,B001MBTT7Q,"I appreciate Will's music. Been a fan since the mid 90's. This film was ok. I prefer to not shatter the illusions which some artists provide. This film won't do that. I've watched it once and likely will not watch it again. Honestly, my own experiences would be more exciting to watch but I'm not Will Oldham.",1322352000,,309,4.43859649122807
