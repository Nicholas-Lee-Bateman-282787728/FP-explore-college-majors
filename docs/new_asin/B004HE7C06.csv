8446516,1,B004HE7C06,"I ordered this because it is advertised as having the original Fubar included on it (Fubar I and II.) The product actually only has Fubar II on it. So the description is misleading. You can actually find a much cheaper version of Fubar II on Bluray on Amazon, Target or Walmart so don't buy this version",1414022400,,303,4.428571428571429
