I love this type of animation, no two ways about it.  If you are reading this you know what I am talking about.  GO Macross!!!!!!",1421884800,,282,3.8947368421052633
630379,5,6303365655,"I rented this movie on VHS when it came out here in America in the 90's, and it literally was one of the movies that changed my life. I'm not saying everyone is going to have the same life-changing experience I did; I deeply connected to the story, and was blown away by the incredible animation.

The plot is fairly straight forward: Years ago three friends on planet Eden were as close as can be, but had a titanic falling out with each other. Now, in the present, the military is testing jets to decide on a new fighter jet to replace their old ones. Two of those childhood friends are now in test pilots and in an ironic twist of fate are competing against each other. Things get personal very quickly, especially when the their former love interest gets thrown back into the mix as well, sparking all the old feelings and rivalries.

For someone with no background knowledge of this film, let me say that this movie is a must-see. Like all the best movies, each character walks around with a secret, a flaw, and a redeeming character trait. The magic of the movie is that the timing on which of each between the three main characters gets revealed makes for a deep and moving story about friendship and love. The back drop of the story is a contest to find the next fighter jet for the military, (think piloted transformers on acid, these jets are amazing) but the heart and soul of the story is the friendship, rivalry, and reconciliation of the three leads.

There's some great twists and turns along the way, and you'll definitely want to watch it more than once after your first viewing to pick up on all the nuances you missed once you know all the characters' secrets. If you're on the fence, let me assure you; spend a few bucks and get this film. It's worth it!",1417046400,,1774,4.435582822085889

630454,4,6303365655,"If you've ever watched the original Robotech or Macross: DYRM then you already know that the stories have a twist in them somewhere.  Like all of the Macross series the story centers around music, and are all phenomenal for their time.  This one did not disappoint.
The basis of the story is a love triangle, and they writers could have written about the anger between 2 pilots due to the love they felt for a woman and the story still would have been great.  But, they didn't stop with just a love triangle instead they throw in an AI that is based built from the thoughts, memories, and emotions of the woman they both love.  This causes additional turmoil towards the end, but (in true anime fashion) brings the truth to the front.
The character development was great for such a short series.  You see a gambit of emotions, view how each character relates, and even see a good background of how they got to where they are.
And Macross Plus is a stepping stone between the original Macross story and the later Macross 7 and Macross Frontier and shows a transition of the fighters from the original story to the later arcs.  I'm hoping that they get the licenses to have these come to the States so that I can buy them up (and any others that I don't know about).",1390780800,,1264,4.426724137931035
630455,5,6303365655,"Being a Robotech fan is hard going back to the roots of were Robotech originated from the Macross series is a gem and sometimes is hard to with some of their more punk musical orientated fighting series like Macross7 or their last series Macross Frontier but I couldn't save with honesty that this Plus series in the Macross zero series has a more straightforward less silly juvenile musical orientated fighting battles and it. There is at least three different versions of the series I know if not more that means all the same material but edited at least three different ways and also dubbed or with subtitles changing the story a little bit here and a little bit there I've gotten one version that I could not find recorded on late-night TV and the two other versions I've bought here on Amazon the TV series and the movie addition.

My disappointment now is that they have come out with a Blu-ray version of some of the Macross story lines but they're all imports in all extremely expensive",1386633600,,994,4.6158192090395485
630456,4,6303365655,"I was disappointed that i did not pick the English version but none the less I still enjoyed the film, however it is not set in the same universe as the original Robotech series.",1384041600,,178,4.264705882352941
630457,5,6303365655,"It had been years since I had seen the series, and enjoyed the movie version just as much if not better. It is not as deep or as involved as the other Macross chapters, but is entertaining and exciting nonetheless. It also lacks the ""heaviness"" of other installments, and that is not necessarily a bad thing. The animation is incredible, the mecha is awesome, and the sound quality is good. The slightly annoying Japanese Idol music is still there, though in a human influenced psychotic artificial intelligence kinda way.",1380672000,,522,4.876404494382022

This story follows a real life history when the Air Force was decommissioning the F-15 Strike Eagle and looking for a new replacement. Lookheed and McDougnal corpartation was battling for the next contract and the new strike jet fighter. Watching this reminds me of that story. In the Macross universe, this takes place but the pilots battle more for their honor and the love of young woman they have known all their lives. Between the story and the music, this anime deserves big screen honors. You will enjoy this one. By the way, the soundtrack, if you can get it, was excellent!",1379548800,,655,4.7043478260869565
630459,2,6303365655,"Macross, for the uninitiated, is an '80s era mecha anime about an intergalactic war between humans and an alien race called the Zendredi during the year 2009.  Though the space opera setup was by-the-numbers, what made Macross stand out were three things: the eyeball-dancing aerial dogfights, those same jets transforming into giant robots called Veritechs, and most importantly, its deconstructive approach to the mecha-war genre.  The conflict didn't end in total annihilation for either side, because each race eventually discovered that their cultures weren't so different and they both deserved to live.  While that realization sounds simplistic today, it was in stark contrast with many war-based anime years prior, including Gundam.  Macross also gained a cult following in America (known as Robotech) for different reasons. Anime in the '80s was scarcer in the U.S., and its portrayal of war was far less sanitized. Unlike G.I. Joe's neutered, fatality-less shootouts, Macross had no qualms with knocking off its main cast, or destroying entire populations. Again, it's not so controversial nowadays, but virtually unheard of during the '80s.

Macross Plus hardly relies on this background narrative, and instead, only retains the surface traits of a Macross series: flashy air-to-air battles, protagonists with militaristic/musical aspirations, and a love triangle. As a result, Macross Plus's plot stands alone with its Top Gun-esque premise. Isamu and Guld, two fighter pilots who double as uneasy childhood friends, are responsible for militaristic weapons testing on planet Eden. To their surprise, Myung, their old friend, came to visit the region to test an AI prototype named Sharon, an artificial singer who emits a hypnotic warmness to her audience during concerts. Myung's unexpected arrival shocks both Isamu and Guld, and the older tensions they suppressed for years began to surface and jeopardize the safety of Eden's military operation. Meanwhile, Myung's boss plans a more sinister use for Sharon on Earth during the 25th anniversary of the human-Zendredi crisis.

For years, fans hyped up Plus as Macross at its best, so my hopes of Plus were pretty lofty; after viewing the trailer, even more so. Unfortunately, the movie didn't satisfy even my lowest expectations, and I mostly blame that on the love triangle. Unlike the original Macross and even Macross 7, none of Plus's protagonists are remotely sympathetic. Isamu is a jerk who treats his girlfriends like garbage, even when he pined for Myung for years, Guld comes off more as obsessive creep instead of knight in shining armor when protecting Myung from Isamu's jerkass tendencies. And then there's Myung.

Oh...god...Myung. Her endless angst makes one wonder how she got had any friends in the first place.  Granted, Myung's friends remember her as a cheerier girl who dreamt of being a singer, but it's hard to believe that she was previously optimistic when she sulks endlessly about how her life derailed over the years. As much as I loathe Isamu and Guld, I'm wondering why two capable pilots are fighting for such a whiny, passive woman.  Myung's perpetually stuck in Lifetime-movie-of-the-week mode, struggling at any given moment and hoping someone would save her. I'm not exaggerating any of this. To be fair, other Macross fans admitted to disliking the love story too, though they were able to overlook it, but I couldn't.  When the first thing that comes to mind with the squabbling threesome is Twilight, that's a very bad sign. Myung is Bella reincarnate. Let that awfulness settle for a second.

But what about the rest of the movie? It's average at best.  The entire subplot about Sharon isn't interesting in the least. A computer program going insane doesn't have the oomph it used to have, and without a decent background story, it's not intriguing anymore. Even worse, the venomous love triangle made the sideplot even worse. Because Sharon's a manifestation of Myung's personal feelings, it only reinforced the extent of Myung's self-loathing. Myung helped construct Sharon to project her singing spirits into an AI, because she was so insecure, she was 100% sure that listeners wouldn't love her own singing. Yes, that's Sharon's reason for existing, all the while, Myung's complaining about life's harsh realities and growing up. Myung couldn't be more emo if she tried.

Within Plus's last half-hour, Isamu, Guld, Myung and Sharon collide in a conflict that could shake Earth's future. Overall, this part of Plus soars, because the aerial/Veritech battles that made Macross famous finally comes into play. It also helps that Plus's best music gets played here. For a while, it's easy to forget the incomprehensible bile that preceded it, though the nagging memory of Earth's frighteningly effective military in the original series - at least effective enough to detect a rogue AI program from compromising the planet - forced me to suspended disbelief. But that relief vanished once the annoying love triangle comes barging through again. Isamu and Guld even fight over petty grudges that include, of all things, missing lunch money! At least the plot finally reveals why Isamu, Guld, and Myung's friendship to split, but the explanation is as risible as everything else in Macross Plus. By the movie's end, it became impossible to care for any of them. Well, maybe for the character who made a sacrifice to save the other two friends and Earth's populous (hint: it ain't Myung).

What a shame that a movie with such awesome potential turned so utterly awful. And seeing that the original Macross team worked on this makes the disappointment even harder. Trust me, this Macross affectionate wanted to love this movie, but I'd be lying if I said otherwise. Catchy music and nifty visuals aside (despite the sub-VHS quality transfer), it's not worth seeing. At this point, it's getting increasingly apparent that no other Macross series will reach the original's brilliance. If not trying again means not producing anything like Plus again, that's a fate I'll accept with bittersweet abandon.",1301097600,,6099,5.216547497446374
630460,1,6303365655,"I originally purchased this movie for my boyfriend because he loves Macross and Robotech, and because I have never seen either anime series. Well, my boyfriend and I popped this in and sat stunned the whole way through because this movie was terrible! I know that some people have given this movie a low rating because the picture quality was terrible, but honestly, I did not even notice the picture quality because I was too busy wondering, ""What the heck is this drivel, and why do people like this?"" If were not for the fact that I have seen many other anime films/series, I would not be interested in seeing anything related to anime after viewing this movie.

This movie reminds me of Twilight and every other story about a nonsensical love triangle that could easily be figured out over a cup of hot tea (Actually, I'm pretty sure I'm doing a disservice to Twilight). Do not get me wrong, I do not mind love-triangles within a plot. The problem with this movie is that the movie is so focused on the love-triangle that I am left wondering why this is even within the Macross universe? Another reason it reminded me of Twilight is the fact that the girl that is being fought over, Lucy, has no agency, no backbone, and absolutely no purpose other than to act as a foil for Isamu and Guld. The viewer learns the back-stories on Lucy, Isamu, and Guld, and it is interesting, but one is still left with the nagging question of why Lucy and Isamu did not just have a talk with Guld? Instead, there is tension between Isamu and Guld, and unrequited love between all three characters.

It is painfully obvious to the viewer who is in love with whom. It also appears that the characters themselves know about each person's feelings, but no one says anything. And, it is not like the issues they have with one another are small, petty, or meaningless; the issues they have are pertinent to other person within the group, and they know it, but no one says a word which leads to a bunch of avoidable craziness. My boyfriend hated this as well, yet stated that he found the last 5-10 minutes somewhat redeeming. I, on the other hand, did not even care about the last few minutes because I spent an hour being bored, frustrated, and face-palming.

That being said, do not buy this movie if you have not seen Macross the series or Robotech. Actually, regardless of whether you have watched the the two series or not, do not waste money on this movie.",1300579200,,2443,4.52262443438914
630541,5,6303365655,This movie brings back alot of memories of the early 90's although it lacked alot of action [Space Battles perse'] the animation was incredibly superior to anything manga has released.,1281830400,,184,5.166666666666667

630543,4,6303365655,"Being a Macross fan, this is one of the series that I would never get bored no matter how many times I watch. Keep in mind that this movie edition came after the 4 OVAS. So some of the scenes are removed to accommodate movie time. Actually I like the new cut, because it makes the story move faster and there are couple of new scenes (in my opinon) makes the story more smoother and dramatic. So get this DVD before it goes out of print. This is more than 10 years old!",1241222400,,469,4.053763440860215
630544,5,6303365655,"Macross Plus really is one of the best installments in the Macross franchise. Coming from someone who has seen mostly everything of Macross (yes, including Macross 7) I can easily say this is one of the best purchases I have ever made.

As has been said this is the movie version of the original 4 part OVA that was edited, cut, and tied together into a 2 hour presentation. This movie is Japanese with English subtitles as the movie version was never dubbed into English like the OVA but don't let that sour you on this buy. Sometimes the best way to see anime is in its original format.

This movie has it all, a great story, high flying mecha action, and of course the trademark of Macross: music plays an important role. Whether you are a long time Macross fan or just like mecha anime in general you can enjoy this movie. Highly Recommended.",1227830400,,846,4.451612903225806
630545,2,6303365655,"Story - Its been 30 years since the story told in the original Macross.  There is no Zentradi fleet, there are no Robotech masters, there is no Rick Hunter, Lynn Minmey or Lisa Hayes.

There is no war, no conflict, frankly nothing of import.

This is a story about 2 test pilots competing for a defense contract and the love of a childhood girlfriend.  There is no good reason to put the name Macross on this, except for a concert that takes place at the remains of the SDF-1.

The mech designs are standard veritechs, the battles are ho hum boring.  The graphics are nice, music nice, some of the sci fi scenes are mildly interesting.

If you are looking for a continuation of the Macross story, a sweeping, galactic drama involving fleets of ships and mecha with multiple stories and find out what happened to your favorite characters from Macross, you will be sorely disappointed.

If you want to see 2 guys fight over a childhood sweetheart, in one on one veritech battles, this is the story for you.",1226275200,,1004,4.538888888888889
630546,5,6303365655,"Macross Plus--the OVA -- is still one of my favorite anime titles. If you haven't seen it, I envy you. Buy it today. Everything about Macross Plus shouts QUALITY. Shoji Kawamori (Escaflowne and Macross Zero) and Shinichiro Watanabe (Cowboy Bebop and Samurai Champloo) co-directed Macross Plus. Yoko Kanno (Escaflowne, Cowboy Bebop, Macross Zero) along with the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra scored the movie. So how can you lose? You have a collaboration of two of the best anime directors. Plus, you have Yoko Kanno, the hottest composer in anime.

The premise of Macross Plus is straight out of Top Gun.  On a planet called Eden, at the New Edwards Air Base, The Ministry of Defense is testing two prototype-transforming jets to determine which jet will replace the Department's main fighter jet, the VF-Thunderbolt. Maverick and hot-head Isamu Dyson pilots the YF-19 manufactured by Industry; Isamu's Rival, Guld Goa Bowman, pilots the YF-21 manufactured by General Galaxy. Their jets are distinctive. Isamu's YF-19 is light and athletic, and its wings sweep forward like those of NASA's X-29. Guld's YF-21 is broad and stealthy with muscular diamond-shaped wings reminiscent of the U.S. Air Force's YF-23. Both pilots fight for more than air supremacy; they fight for the affections of beautiful Myung Fang Lone, the producer and puppeteer of virtual singing Idol Sharon Apple. Isamu and Guld clash in a series of exciting aerial brawls. Wings morph themselves into hands, tail flaps morph themselves into legs and feet, and canopies morph themselves into faces. They kick the living crap out of each other until the appearance of the Ghost X-9--the prototype unmanned fighter--threatens to knock them both out of the competition. I like the way the movie shows the succession of technology through the YF-19, the YF-21, and the Ghost-X9: the YF-19 jet is manually operated by Isamu; the YF-21jet  is operated by the brain waves of Guld Goa Bowman; and the Ghost X-9 jet is completely autonomous.

I've seen this OVA many times, and I never tire of seeing it. Supposedly, Macross Plus was the most expensive anime of its era and paved the way for the integration of traditional cell animation and computer animation. The colors are saturated and the lines are razor-sharp. The frame rate is epileptic and the background elements are flat; however, the gung-ho mecha sequences and Yoko Kanno's rousing musical score make up for these shortcomings. Today's animation may be more sophisticated, but you won't find too many action animes that are better than Macross Plus.

The movie edition is worth it if for nothing more then the final battle (longer and better then the OVA).

When Macross Plus arrived I was an adult and I was so impressed by the animation and the sound track is awsome still!! Most of all, the plot was finally a mature one!

I have both the OVA series and the Movie Version.  I felt to get all aspects of the story line I had to watch both versions.  Both are great as stand alone howerver.  I appriciated the Movie version since there was some nudity and the death of Gould was more intense. I didn't like that the Movie left out some plot development though. I truely felt,at the time of release, this movie was the most superior film out there. (In my opinion.)

Now, I must tell you that I have not viewed the DVD version of this release.  So I appriciate reading the reviews here.  I just rewatched the VHS version a couple of nights ago. And the story still grabs my heart.  But the quality of tape compared to watching DVD's is so grainy.  I am shocked and dissappointed to hear that the DVD release is a copy of the VHS! I have been considering buying the DVD of Macross Plus, but I'm glad to know ahead of time it isn't worth it. I thought there was an English dubbed version of the Movie version.

The first pressing had audio problems such as what was listed as a 5.1 mix was actually a 4.0 mix since the center channel wasn't used. Not to mention that the Japanese audio wasn't a heavy as the English version. Most of that has been improved and it now sounds excellent and up to par with the wonderful animation.(which by the way does not look like it came out in 1994). BUY THIS DISC!!",1081728000,3,875,4.27710843373494

Anyone who can say that this series is ""retarded, a Top-Gun rippoff"", AND said the animation was ""sub-par"", has NO taste in anime! The storyline is believable; with strong, flawed, funny, and vulnerable characters, emotions are portrayed effectively. The dialogue is precise, with excellent dubbing, sound is top notch in full surround, and the animation is colorfull, crisp, and shows amazing depth.
  There are many equally fine anime titles: Akira, Patlabor, Blue Gender, Grave of The Fireflies, etc. But it doesn't and can't get much better than Macross Plus!",1064016000,4,671,5.203703703703703
630637,1,6303365655,"Get serious, of all the stories to write about surrouding the Macross world, the producers went and write a story about a love triangle. Thank God that it's only a 4 part series.
You have Isamu Dayson, Guld Bowman and Myung, childhood friends and basically Myung undecided about these 2 guys and while they ended up hating each other's guts fighting for her. But both vowing to protect Myung, regardless. Get it now - IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH MACROSS!!!
Then... oh what a coincidence, Isamu gets to be a test pilot for the VF-19 fighter while Guld is the test pilot for VF-21 and both of them are vying for the same government project. yeah, yeah some fight scenes... so what. And oh wait... what about Myung, she quits singing after an 'incident' involving the 3 of them. But lends her talent as the supplier of 'emotions' to this AI holographic rock star, whilst disguising herself to the public as the producer to this so called AI rock star. The public is duped into thinking that it's total AI but little do they know that Myung is the puppet mistress behind it.
Anyway, to tie it all together, the AI went nuts coz the scientist behind it removed some safeguard on the program. And of all the things - guess what. It went nuts becoz the AI also fell in love with these 2 jokers (emotions were supplied by Myung - pft... pft... yucks...).
Ok, so what does a love sick AI program do - hijack SDF-1 and kidnaps Myung, and to tie it all together, Isamu and Guld puts their differences behind to save her... some more fight scenes after what seems like hours of corny dialog.

Anime only seemed cool and futuristic in the early 90's / 5. The only good Anime is still AKIRA / 6.

630695,2,6303365655,"I've heard good things about the movie edition for Macross Plus for a while. How it's better then the 4 part OVA. I've never gotten to see it until now, and IMO it isn't better. It feels a little choppy in the pacing department. The new music for the montages wasn't as good as the music they had in the OVA. I don't like that the battle scene with the VF-11B Thunderbolt and the board meeting talking about the YF-19 and YF-21 tests were cut but I like what they did with the rest. The ending is worth (at the very least renting) the Movie Edition of Macross Plus.
My biggest problem is with the picture. The video for the DVD releases for the OVA looks great. But for the movie it looks like a VHS tape. It's not like another company released the movie edition. I know it was put out for the Macross fans but it doesn't mean the video has to look as bad is it does, esp. when the OVA looked so good. I don't think it can be blamed on source material. What is up with the video quality? No one is going to be using this as a demo disc.
My next problem is with the Subtitles. From what I've read there never was an English dub recorded for the Movie Edition and of course to do it for the dvd would cost more money (and I have a feeling it wouldn't be that inspired anyway). I'm fine with it only being in Japanese. What I do hate is burnt in subtitles. Why oh why? It looks tacky and makes the video quality look a little worst. Again, they were going for the VHS look I guess. The audio does sound good though.
The extras are a laugh. The character bio's would have been better if a fan of the the series wrote them, the photo gallery isn't that great and the rest of the extras are just commericals for Manga. But I guess that's what is to be expected as they are pretty much the same (if not the same, but I don't feel like checking) extras for the OVA dvds. Still, Macross is pretty big and it would have been nice to see at least an interview with the director.
Overall I can't recommend this disc. There is no excuse for the bad video and the burnt in subtitles. They must have ported the movie from a VHS tape and re-mixed the sound. If you like Macross I'd recommend picking up the OVA. If you are a Macross region 1 dvd completist then you'll pick this up no matter what, just like me.",1025395200,29,2295,4.090909090909091
630696,4,6303365655,"I gave it 4 stars, because I have seen the cable version and enjoyed it.  Unfortunately, this DVD IS NOT dubbed in English.  The hardcore anime fan usually prefers the Japanese with English subtitles version.  Well that's not me.  I admit the English voice actors usually sound overly hormonal, but I tend to watch these movies at night, while I am lying in bed and particularly during the second, third, and so on viewing, the last thing I want to do have to concentrate and read subtitles.  So I made it 1 minute in the movie, then re-boxed it and returned it to Amazon.  It's a shame, because I looked forward to it.",1025049600,8,619,4.433628318584071
630697,5,6303365655,"I just bought this anime movie,I'd been waiting for the Movie Edition on DVD to come out a long time ago and I'm proud to say it was worth it. The movie is a delight of beautiful animation and music. The story is smooth and the DVD very easy to navigate.
 About the animation used in this anime movie it's something that I haven't seen in any other movie. If I could relate it to another anime it would be ""AKIRA"" or ""COWBOY BEBOP"" because everything was meant to be perfect in this film. The music composed by Yoko Kanno is the second most notable thing from this anime. It's a mix of popular and traditional music with a little bit of everything.
 The story,that for me was quite well written and intelligent,would caught you attention from its beginning to the very end. If you like anime with a touch of everything,romance,action,mecha,music....Macross Plus has it all. This is the perfect sequel for the original  Macross(Robotech) serie that to the date had remaind one of the top favorites of the fans.",1022976000,9,1009,4.594444444444444
630698,5,6303365655,"Although my title is a little extreme, it is just about true.  You should buy this tape or any of the other Macross Plus products.  Trust me on this, you will not be dissapointed.
Macross made its start way back in Japan.  I don't know exactly how it happened but the gyst of the story is this.  Someone decided that a Anime that combined Mecha(transforming jetfighters in this case) a love story, and intergral music would appeal to a world market.  They were proved right.  Macross became a cult classic immediatly.  people loved the jets, loved the charactors, and loved the setting it was placed in.  This humble beggining spawned several more outgrowths, like Robotech and Macros 2 and 7.  But the simplistic and wonderful idea of the origional Macross was being dilluted by the new material.  A return was needed.  And Macross Plus is that.
Enter Eden, a place where test pilots and new test planes spar to become the new Space Superiority Veritech of the defense forces.  At the head of this conflict is Guld and Isamu, two childhood friends with some past experience forcing them apart.  Also on Eden is Myung, the thrid friend and mutual intrest to both.  Thats the love story.
Now salivate over the amazing graphics that will give you a hernia from the action.  And bow down before the technical might of the YF-19 and YF-21, two of the most incredible combat fighters ever to grace an Anime.  Be amazed as the perfectly coreographed action sequences have you drooling upon yourself in shocked stuppor.  This is the Mecha.
And never return to normal music again as you listen to the heartwrenchingly beautiful and sultry music of Sharon Apple, a singer like no other.  You WILL be amazed by how good this music sounds.  I myself have bought the many CD's that go with this and I am very happy I have done so.  I expect that you too, having watched this movie, will have much the same desire.
Macross 4, the one I am writing about, is one of either 4 videos or 2 DVD's.  Also in the Macross line is a Macross Plus Movie, a combination of the entire series.  I suggest buying either Macross Plus Part 1 or the movie.  If either immpresses you, buy the rest.  The movie is significantly different from the 4 part series and although some of it crosses over, having both is not a waste.  In the end...This is one of the greatest Anime to ever be created.  Treat yourself to it.",1020729600,,2383,4.535211267605634
630699,5,6303365655,Well when I first watched this movie to my disapointment it was subtitles but it didn't take away the quality that this movie delivered. I loved the dog fights that took place in the jets. It took the movie to a realistic level. It's been awhile since i've seen animation drawen this well. I enjoyed the plot and it kept me on my seat. The characters were well done. The plot is off beat so some people might not like it but if you are a true anime fan i'm sure you'll be buying this one.,1017619200,4,488,4.09375
630700,5,6303365655,"An original OVA release, Macross Plus was the first Macross project to make heavy use of computer graphics, blended perfectly with a great storyline and a remarkable musical score by Yoko Kanno. Produced by Shigeru Watanabe and directed by legendary director and mechanical designer Shoji Kawamori, responsible for the original Valkyrie design back in 1982, it was a instant classic when released, both on US and Japan.
But there was something missing, and sometimes, there was too much going on, many would complain on how Isamu didn't died on so many accidents or the martial court that had nothing to do with anything (of course there was a reason for it, but in the end, it just ended up serving as a filler rather than useful, as nothing got changed after it).
Then came one of those Macross special events, where they released both a Macross 7 movie and a movie version of the OVA series that everybody loved. What everybody wasn't ready is that the movie version would be much better thant the original release.
Now the question: why? First, running on 4 episodes of 45 minutes, you got about 3 hours of story, and the movie runs for almost 2 hours, so you know that they cut a lot of fat on this one (and three end-credits of time). Also, they went all the trouble to make new scenes for this release, scenes that surely add more depth to the story, most specifically at two points at the ending (one of them is the ending itself, that's really quick on the OVA release).
If you are a serious Macross fan, you deserve yourself a copy of this DVD, even if you already have the OVA release. If you are being cautious on your budget, then you can get only one disc with the whole Macross Plus experience. Anyway, you're going to be pleased with this disc.",1017187200,41,1760,4.537735849056604
630701,5,6303365655,"Macross Plus is the first Macross project that came from it's original creators after the Macross movie back in 1984.  It is a side story to the Macross universe which pits two former friends as test pilots against each other in a heated variable fighter competition where the winning design becomes the next UN Spacy transforming fighter.
  Thus is the backdrop for the ensuing Macross story which delves deeper than just two pilots trying to out-perform each other both in the air, and on the ground trying to obtain the affections of their former friend, Myung, who is now the producer for a virtual music idol.  Macross Plus has often been compared to ""Top Gun"" as it does in fact share some similarities, namely the hot shot pilots.
  Most people have seen the Macross Plus OVA.  The movie edition simply edits out parts from it and has a slightly different ending along with scenes that did not appear in the 4 part OVA.  Thus, many will ask, why get this when I have already seen the OVA?
  The reason is that the movie edition has a different feeling than the OVA.  Particularly the ending, which felt a little rushed in the original 4 part series.  You still have the great music by Yoko Kanno and great mecha design by Kawamori (The YF-19 and YF-21 competing almost echoes the real life F-22/F-23 fighter trials).  The trademark Macross love triangle is here, and music indeed plays a major role in the storyline.
  If you enjoyed the Macross Plus story as much as I have,  getting this disc will make you a happy fan indeed.",1015632000,26,1535,4.588235294117647
630702,3,6303365655,"For those who aren't in the know, Macross Plus was ""distributed"" 2 ways; the entire movie here and 4 seperate video tapes. I bought Part 4 first, then only got the Subtitled Movie later on.
To be honest, both tapes average a neutral in my mind; while Part 4 has abit more ""Footage"" and some different sequences (I have no idea why) plus had ""Pulse"" and a somewhat longer version of ""Information High"" (And it seemed to match flawlessly with the film in Part 4; in the Movie, it was clunky, didn't seem to mathc the film, and was shorter).
The Movie looked like classic anime; it looked old, played out very well, and offered a better cut than the Part 4 I have. Plus, the sequence on the Movie with ""Information High"" looked abit more spectatular with it's difference sequence that followed the begining of the concert scence on Earth.
But then again, I grew-up watching Part 4, so, I dunno; they both pretty much are both okay by each other.
Cost wise?? Perhaps I should buy parts 1 to 3 and see the differences!!",1013817600,,1014,4.456989247311828

Macross Plus would have to be one of the best produced anime EVER! Visually, Sound, and Story wise, it is very appealling. DVD doesn't offer too much extra, but it does let you compare dialogue between English and Japanese.
The First volume starts it off by introducing the three central characters, Test pilots Isamu and Guld, and Music Producer Myung. All of them linked by a past event that shattered their friendship, and the story brings them all back together to confront each other.
The drama in this series is done great, as well as the mecha battle sequences and the music. G-R-E-A-T",1010361600,2,719,4.714285714285714

630765,5,6303365655,"First off I have to mention that Macross Plus is my favorite anime. Animation is top-notch, characters are well-developed, but most importantly, the story is mature, deep, and moving. And unlike most other anime movies and series (at least the relatively few that I've seen), the ending doesn't totally ruin an otherwise satisfying viewing experience. In fact, I would have to say that the ending is the best part of Macross Plus the Movie.
There are essentially two different versions of this anime. There's the original OVA version consisting of four parts. Then there's the ""movie"" version which came out afterwards.
My advice is, watch the four part verison but OWN the movie version. The former goes to great length to be detailed and logical but the latter has a much better feel to it. In general, it flows more smoothly as a result of having been edited: ""unimportant"" scenes were cut and some new ones were added, especially in the ending. The result? A much tighter storyline (albeit, a less logical one), and a more satisfying ending.
The DVD is supposed to come out Spring 2002, so hold off buying this VHS. The wait is almost over!",1009670400,,1144,4.782828282828283

However, everyone's entitled to their own opinion, and I happen to have a different one.  The animation in this was beautiful--unbelievably fluid and detailed, quite breathtaking.  The music was, unsurprisingly, similarly inspiring.  However, I just didn't find myself in the slightest bit interested in what was happening to these characters.  Of the two main competing pilots, neither one had me rooting for them.  Oh, they both liked the same girl and now they've met again.  That's nice.  That's about how involved I got.
As for the convenience of the plot, that annoyed me too.  Oh, so Dyson gets reassigned to this faraway place, and it just *happens* to be where his rival is stationed and his rival just *happens* to be working on this competing fighter and their long-lost love just *happens* to be in town because she's a concert producer for Sharon Apple (okay, I recognize the joke there, but still--Sharon *APPLE*? lame).  One too many coincedences for my tastes.
Normally, in this genre of film, you root for the ""good guy"" to beat the ""bad guy.""  I'm assuming that Dyson is our ""hero.""  I liked him at first, but finally found him to be an irritatingly cocky jerk who looks at women as pieces of meat.  I know I'm being harsh here, but I was extremely disappointed in what I was hoping would be a much more entertaining experience.  In the end, despite the amazing animation and score, I found myself checking my watch and wondering when it would be over.

What I found to be the low point of the anime (and I'll bet this disagrees with the diehard Macross fans) was the unnecessarily long Sharon Apple concert scene in the first hour of the movie. It was just a collage of imagery and crappy music that gave me a headache. But for the next hour, the story did get much better and more engaging.

630832,5,6303365655,"Let me start by saying that I wasn't disappointed one bit by the first two OAVs. This series is as good as advertised. The animation is great, not perfect, but still great. The dialouge is excellent and the dubbing (an option) didn't hurt the overall experience either. The music, which plays a great deal in the story, is very well presented and pleasing. Moreover, I think that the depth of the story and the interaction of the characters brings forth an enjoyable viewing that leads one to conclude that Macross Plus is an extra ordinary anime. Sure there maybe more better anime out there, but if you're looking for action, comedy, and human drama then this DVD is more than worth a look- IT'S a MUST BUY if you're a real anime fan. The only possible gripe is that if you didn't buy the 3rd and 4th part (Vol. 2) along with the first volume it'll leave you gripping with anxiety to see the how the story is resolved. It's a good buy (with lots of extra features like previews of other anime)and having it in a DVD format makes it perfect for a collection. Overall, I'll say it again- for it's price it's a great deal, a great anime to watch, and it's something you'd want to keep.",982540800,3,1184,4.410958904109589

In Macross Plus, there is the YF-19 and the new YF-20. The show focuses on Isamu, a rookie pilot who is sent to be testing out against the YF-20. The new YF-20 is a new model which lets the pilot use his mind as a control rather controls. Isamu is the one who gets dragged into this as the short end. Another person to add into the story is Sharron Apple. Sharron Apple is a living computer that makes her own music and is very mysterious. Sharron's instructor is also the girlfriend of the pilot of the YF-20. There is a love scene which goes on, but the real thrill is seeing the test sequence. After seeing the new YF-20 leave Isamu's YF-19 in the dust, Isamu tries to one-up the YF-20 anyway he can.

I am 14 and an anime fan, however not a ""deep"" or ""avid"" fan.  I only consider myself a fan.  I hate how some people say ""I am the  biggest anime fan in the world!  I will rate this movie and you will  believe everything I say!""  All I am saying is that most people will  like this movie, whether an anime fan or not.  Now to the plot....
It is  basically Top Gun, meets Robotech, meets the visual splendor of Ghost in  the Shell, meets some of the best animation and artists int he world.  Throw in some dramatic conflict, tons of action, and some slapstick humor  and you've got one of the greatest films ever made, in my humble  opinion....
Guld Bowman and Isamu Dyson are the worst of enemies, yet the  best of friends, as the conflict between them clashes throughout the movie.  They are both test pilots on the planet Eden flying two very different  jets, trying to win the governments funding to replace the currently used  fighter.  Isamu flys the YF-19, a manually controlled jet with a lot of  agility and a great amount of speed.  Guld, on the other hand, flys the  YF-21, a jet controlled by the mind, giving it an incredible amount of  agility, very quick linear thinking, and stealth capabilities.  The old  friends are now constanly at eachothers throats, always making you wonder  who the real enemy is. The other conflict involves Myung, a singer, now  gone producer, with a strange past.  She is the producer for the virtual  pop diva, Sharon Apple.  Macross Plus has a story that slowly and  mysteriously unravles, leaving you curious and confused until the  end.
The music in the story is some of the best to hit movies, beating  the pants off anything else, with all original songs performed by Yokko  Kanno, and almost all os the songs are dubbed to english.  The dubbing is  great too, and facial expressions are edited to match the voices in the  english version. The ending of the movie is superb, leaving you wanting to  watch it again and again, and  do watch it at least twice, because the more  you see it the better it gets. Lastly the animation is simply put: Amazing.  You look at each individual frame on the DVD and think, ""WOW.  What  group of people could take the time to draw over 240,480 frames of  animation so damn perfect.""
The DVD is one of the best I've seen,  featuring full 5.1 Dolby Digital audio on the english version, and Dolby  Surround on the Japanese version.  It has both Japanese and English dubbing  and subtitles, so you can enjoy it in both it's original form and the  english version.  It has 4 theatrical trailers, and selectable previews for  upcoming Manga Video films, that aren't manditory to watch.  It also has a  fully animated interactive menu with music, and a great intro to the  movie.
It is by far one of my favorite movies ever, and even both my  younger sister and my father (who isn't big fan of animated movies) enjoyed  it thoroughly.  Buy it on VHS or DVD, get the cut movie or the 4 individual  parts, or at the very least rent it, because I promise you, that you won't  regret.  If you dislike it, come over sometime and give me a swirly or  something, because I know that you will like it as much or more than I did.",963878400,18,3317,4.426666666666667

Isamu is too reckless for combat, so he is  transfered to a place where recklessness is an asset.  New Edwards test  facility on planet Eden.

Now, the movie has been released.  The extra  scenes that were added give the story more depth and increase the impact of  key moments, (Guld's demise is posible the most powerful and depressing  deaths in any film, and it was underplayed in the OVA.)

630929,5,6303365655,"Too few movies are crafted as this one is; Macross Plus has interesting characters, intricately beautiful scenes, a wonderful score, and a new fan in me.
The film's plot doesn't sound very unique: Two rival test pilots  fight over their planes and a shared love interest. However, as their  backstories unfold, the material is lifted beyond its rote orgins. The  creative juices that generate the futuristic world of Macross Plus don't  limit themselves to flashy fighter jets duking it out; they give equal time  to explore character's emotional issues. Since I've seen very little anime,  I'm only guessing when I say that this balance is rare. Beyond anime,  however, there are few conventional action films that are anchored by a  legitimate character story. So imagine if Top Gun's aerial scenes were  combined with a Casablanca-type plot. Now THAT would be a heck of a movie  and not coincidentally, so is Macross Plus.
The drawback to the DVD  version is that the film isn't continuous and requires some disc changing  during viewing. I think the climax is also a little difficult to understand  too, but not so much that it would detract from the film.
This is a great  film for any action film fan, anime or not. Surprisingly, it's based on the  mid-80's cartoon Robotech, but any comparison between the two can hardly be  qualified. This gets an enthusiastic recommendation from me.",962064000,6,1392,4.935344827586207

Also, the valkyries looked weak in comparison to the VF-1S and  the VF-2SS.  I feel that the producers should have followed the Macross II  storyline instead of making Macross Plus.

The story will remind most of you of Top Gun but I  don't hold that against it, also, as we have seen in Anime such as Battle  Angel Alita, Blade Runner is all over this picture like a rash. Have fun  trying to spot all its influences throughout the film. Criticising this  film is difficult, but I felt that the music stuck out like a sore thumb in  places where there should have been no music at all. Also, you could say  that the film is overly sentimental in places, especially in Volume 2.  Those who find soppy scenes difficult will be squirming in their seats, but  hang in there as there are plenty of fantastically executed action  sequences to turn the tide.

630986,5,6303365655,"Excellent manga movie, one of my all time favorites.  The plot was a little simple, but still interesting.  The animation was superb and blended well with the soundtrack.  You should also get the second vol. to complete  this masterpiece.  This is anime at its finest.
I also recommend the  soundtrack.  Its a rich mix of techno, jazz, and japanese pop.",950745600,,353,4.783333333333333
630987,5,6303365655,"I have to tell you that I bought this title without knowing wirtually anything about it. All the past experiences I relied on were some distant childhood memories of some Robotech episodes I saw on Sky Channel. All in  all this was one of the best anime buys of mine so far. The story is quite  but not too complex, the characters are well worked out, but I advise you  to use a good amplifier with huge speakers or a sophisticated dolby digital  system, because the soundtrack is spectacular and is very important for the  proper effect.",948585600,3,538,4.505154639175258

This is the 4 part movie isn't it? Where sharon apple infects  the macross? and takes control of the ghost fighter? and where Maune sings  ""voices"" isn't it?

630990,3,6303365655,"Macross Plus the movie is EDITED.  Much of the action (almost the entire Part 3 from the series) has been cut out for time consideration.  While still a very good story, and still a very good movie, the series is much  better.  The story has been slightly changed, as well, and while it retains  its cohesion, you really miss a lot after seeing the 4 part series.  The  movie is 115 minutes (less than 2 hours), and I believe that the series  runs about 3 hours.  I would give the series 5 stars, but the movie is a  bit of a dissapointment (though it is cheaper).",945043200,5,564,4.235849056603773

630992,5,6303365655,Like other reviews I consider this film to be the best film ever produced by Manga. The story centres on the rivalry and love between three friends. Two are at a flight testing centre while the other is the producer  of a famous singer. This may not sound riviting but given a chance this will  make a splendid purchase. The video works much better with subtitles and the  music is truly masterfull. Thus this anime comes with the highest  recommendation,944611200,2,454,4.6375
630993,5,6303365655,"This, IIRC, was one of the most expensive Anime ever done, and it shows.  The animation itself is simply beautiful, I have yet to see anything anime that is done with such attention to detail, the music is great, it really  sets the mood of the whole series(This review also applies to the next 2  parts :) I would recommend this to anyone wanting to get into anime/into  anime, and make sure to show this to all my friends locally, I have yet to  find someone that after watching this, didn't think it was simply amazing.",940723200,2,522,4.395833333333333
631035,5,6303365655,"Macross Plus is an outstanding piece of animation, with visuals that can rival the legendary Akira.  But what makes this so special is the storyline that has you hooked on from the first episode to the last.  A love triangle  between three high school friends , Isamu , Gold , Mieux is the main plot  line. They have all split up and are leading their own lives after an  incident.....watch the film. Fate brings them all together in the same city  where old memories start to come back and trouble
has started to brew.  You get so involved with the charcters that at times you forget that it is  just an animation, that's how good this gets.  Not to mention the music,  which helps to move the story along,with a fantastic opening score that  stays in your memories for months after watching the final part. Action,  Romance , Adventure, this is the new way for animations a top notch  movie  in its own way.....",939081600,7,913,4.487804878048781
631036,5,6303365655,"I consider Macross Plus as one of the premier Animes, because of its quality in areas that count the most; graphics, story, and music.
The graphics is truly amazing and beautiful, some being integrated with computer generated images. Story is very deep and thoughtful, quite engaging even for older audience because of its mature theme. The soundtrack to this anime consists of techno style to classical style music, and does exceptional job setting the mood.
The Macross Plus originally came out as 4 part series, and later as this version, Macross Plus: The Movie. Macross Plus: The Movie is definitely worth watching, even for those who have seen the 4 Part series, because this version is differently edited and has a different flow to it.  It was a pleasant surprise to see this version, because I was expecting a mere shortened version of the longer 4 part series, which runs about 160 minutes overall.
It really felt like watching a new movie, not only because of the different editing, but also due to the extra footages that were not included in earlier 4 Part series. Those extra footage alone, is a real treat because they are not minor stuff that you might or might not notice. They are substantial addition to the story line and has dramatic influence on the whole movie.
Macross Plus is a very special anime and I recommend it to anyone who appreciates great anime experience.",935366400,6,1390,4.791666666666667
631037,5,6303365655,"This and Macross plus part 1 are one of my 3 anime video collections and I hope to complete my macross plus collection soon; because once I saw the Macross plus part 1 I was pissed off about the buying of the collection but  the story is deep(some drama, romance and adult realism), along with the  action (especially the mechas). But I have to tell you this movie is one of  the best anime or in other words japanimation to see anime fan beginners  and people who think cartoons are just for kids like me (13 and younger)  and people who like (good) movies. This movie is very realistic and not  cute and funny the way a Disney movie is,that is why many people and I love  anime.",934416000,,680,4.265625
631038,5,6303365655,"If you have seen the Macross Plus series, you are sure to love the movie.  In actuality, the movie, is all four of the tapes piled into one film.  however, different scenes were added and removed, which gives the viewer a  better understanding of the basic storyline.
Some things were a little  confusing in the series, such as Isamu, Guld, and Myung's childhood  affairs, but the movie explains a little more to you.  Also, for fans of  Sharon Apple, the 4th tape concert scene is almost totaly diferent from the  series, but it adds a new dimention to the awesome computer graphics used  in the Macross videos.  Trust me, you will love it.",923184000,,641,4.592920353982301
