8653619,1,B00JRSK772,"We got this at our library and seeing the princess in the title I pulled it out to see what it was about. The animals on the cover, the swirls of glittery wisps, and the tag line ""Enchantment is a carriage ride away"" all pointed to a fantasy princessy type move. I did read the back and was shocked to see ""based on Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet."" My coworkers and I joked, surely they have changed the ending, after all, how does Juliet get the princess title? Magic must be involved and even some talking animals, we thought. I took it home to see how they changed it...only to find that they did not. Let me first say that I am not for dumbing down literature and making stories have happy ending just so children can ""enjoy"" it. I am, however, strongly against retitling a classic story and marketing it in such a way that little girls would be drawn to it only to find out that the two main characters commit suicide. Not so sure about anyone else, but I'd hate for a 4 or 5 year old girl to see princess in the title pick up the movie and then be horrified by the content. It comes down to a huge case of false advertising in really the worst way. If they had just kept the title Romeo & Juliet, I wouldn't have nearly as many issues; only the ones of some pretty bad animation which makes it look like a bad video game most of the time. It just totally missed the mark.",1410566400,5,1377,4.180451127819549
