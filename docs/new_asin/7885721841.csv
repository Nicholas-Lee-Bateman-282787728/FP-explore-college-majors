8324580,5,7885721841,"This movie is a semi-fictionalised expos of the workings of the Qing court in its dying days. It was made in HongKong while mainland China was still at war, more than sixty years after the supposed events depicted. There are other prints of this movie available but this one has suffered no better or worse for wear. What is interesting for a HongKong production is the crisp clear Mandarin speech, and this version (unlike some cheaper ones) also has Chinese subtitles. Recommended for students of Chinese language and culture.",1367020800,,528,4.943820224719101
