8145895,5,B000IJ7A5G,"This is an early incarnation of the Jazz Messengers with Lee Morgan, Wayne Shorter, Walter Davis, Jr, and Jymie Meritt, recorded at Salle Playel in 1959. All editions of the Messengers served as a training ground for new talent, and this one was no exception. Morgan was a direct descendent of Clifford Brown (and studied with him), Shorter went on to do a lot to co-lead the influential band Weather Report, and Davis was widely admired among musicians. All three are well regarded as composers. As always, Art kicks the band well, and everyone is playing very well, especially Morgan and Shorter. The result is a very exciting 51 minutes of what came to be called ""hard bop.""

Originally shot on film, the camera work is good and makes sense in the context of the music, but the transfer from film to video is not very good. The result is fuzzy wide shots but close-ups look fine. Sound is excellent, well recorded, and well balanced musically. The only flaw sonically occurs when Morgan crowds the mic, it overloads.",1324166400,,1019,4.724719101123595
