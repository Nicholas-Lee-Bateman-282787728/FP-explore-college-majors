8579168,4,B00CAEKR7A,Hard to find gem of a film.  Godfather of backwoods slasher flicks.,1411430400,,67,4.583333333333333
8579169,5,B00CAEKR7A,"In RITUALS (aka: THE CREEPER) a group of five vacationing doctor friends hikes deep into the wilderness. Led by Mitzi (Lawrence Dane- THE CLOWN MURDERS, SCANNERS) and Harry (Hal Holbrook- THE FOG, CREEPSHOW), at first, all is fun and games around the campfire. That is, until everyone's boots disappear, and the dread begins to build. The doctors write it off as a joke, but soon, a bloody ""gift"" / warning is placed in the camp, and they find themselves caught in a fight for their lives. A fight that includes a series of nasty, deadly ""tricks"". Who is stalking and tormenting them, and why? RITUALS is a survival / horror film. It benefits from a strong, DELIVERANCE vibe. There's also some nice character development, intelligent dialogue, and superior acting. Deserves to be far better known...",1408147200,,799,4.925925925925926
8579170,5,B00CAEKR7A,"This is one of the most underrated and little known films . Hal Holbrook plays his part well as does the rest of the cast. It is creepy, scary and mysterious all at the same time. This one is a keeper!",1403568000,,201,3.926829268292683
8579171,3,B00CAEKR7A,"I've loved Rituals for a very long time.  I'm still waiting for this movie to get a decent release with a remastered transfer.  I only bought this version because it featured a ""VHS Retro STYLE"" that claimed it had VHS packaging of some type.  However all that arrived was a DVD in a normal DVD case.  Nothing about it looked like a VHS tape.  So if you're buying it for that reason, just save your money.",1389052800,,405,4.276315789473684
