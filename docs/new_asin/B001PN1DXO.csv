8333856,5,B001PN1DXO,"Very Educational, My 2 year old owns 16 Word World DVD's plus the demo! Uses colorful characters, helps children solve problems and spell words! Everything in the show is spelled out...(ex. the body of DOG spells ""D-O-G"")!

Also, the Word World Mega Block sets (Barn & House) are awesome!!!! Great learning toys!

and the Mega Block set of DUCK, BIRD, & OWL are an awesome addition to the Mega Block BARN & HOUSE!

My son also has every WORD WORLD book, they ALL are a must get item!",1288915200,,483,4.465909090909091
8333857,1,B001PN1DXO,"Let me first say boooooo to the Word World people for putting out a greatest hits and try to pawn it off as new stuff.  Bad business, first bad move that I have seen from what, in an era of really poor offerings, is real quality educational programing that kids like.

Also, One Star to the reviewers.  You need to pay more attention to what and how you buy on the Internet.
Take 5 minutes and read the description or look it up in the Interwebs on The Google.  It is a series of tubes that leads you to the knowledge that you seek!",1251763200,4,532,4.086538461538462
8333858,1,B001PN1DXO,My kids and I LOVED all the Word World dvds.  So I pre-ordered this dvd as soon as it was available.  What a disappointment!  Only one new episode!!  This dvd was a waste of money.  Save your money and don't order this dvd if you already have other Word World dvds.,1246665600,12,265,4.117647058823529
8333859,1,B001PN1DXO,all but one episode is new. so i just spent my money on the same stuff i already have. i thought it woulg of been different episodes. my son loves word worlds but he got mad when it was the same episodes.,1244764800,14,204,3.880952380952381
8333860,1,B001PN1DXO,"This wordworld video was a disappointment.  we own most of the other ones, and this has 2 rerun episodes and only 1 new episode.  maybe i missed that in the item description, but I generally wouldn't expect them to have re-runs and sell them as new videos.  my little 3 year old looked forward to this for a few months before it came, and was disappointed when we got it and she watched it.  hope the next ones this summer that are coming out aren't such a waste.

Wordworld is GREAT, this one was a disappointment.",1241913600,21,515,4.322916666666667
