8234570,5,B000Z243HE,"David Rohl is a source of interesting knowledge of some of the history of the ancient world and the Biblical connections with traditions and myths.
I first got hooked by purchasing ""Pharaohs and Kings; A Biblical Quest"" twenty years ago and more recently the David Rohl  four lecture DVD of the material contained in his book.",1452124800,,326,4.821428571428571
8234571,5,B000Z243HE,"Wow!  I love this. Thank you, David Rohl.
Eden still exists.  It is there, you can walk around. It has changed in 7,000 years, people live there.",1423872000,,145,4.333333333333333
8234572,5,B000Z243HE,"Wow! In the typical English educator's style of presenting the evidence and allowing the viewer to judge. we find a breathtaking story and the answer to a biblical mystery, by my mind. We also discover the development of ideas like paradise and Eden-based architecture millenia old. This is one of my most treasured videos.",1389225600,,323,5.0
8234573,5,B000Z243HE,"In this DVD, Egyptologist David Rohl goes in search of the Garden of Eden, using the Bible, Sumerian and Babylonion records and his own investigation of the region to determine where the Garden of Eden was.

Let me explain from the beginning that David Rohl is not a Christian trying to prove the literal words of the Bible. If you are looking for that, you won't find this DVD enjoyable. Instead, Mr. Rohl believes that, behind many of the earliest legends, there is a measure of truth and, like Heinrich Schliemann searching for Troy with a copy of the Iliad in hand, Rohl looks at the evidence and concludes that a tribe of early farmer-pastoralists in the late Neolithic did indeed ""leave Eden"".

Rohl takes us on a guided tour of the regions of importance to his search. We not only go through modern-day Iraq and Iran but also Turkey in our search for the Garden. I thought the production quality was very good with good cinematography, direction and even score.

Rohl is able to use his considerable knowledge of ancient languages (giving credit to those who went before him) to test his theory of the origins of civilization. He uses early Sumerian writings such as ""Enmerkar and the Lord of Arrata"" as well as the Gilgamesh epic. Chronicles of war records by Sargon also lend help in directions.

I think the average viewer/reader of ancient history will be interested in David Rohl's work and recognize his fresh and independent thinking on the early history of civilization. I did enjoy it and consider it well worth the money. I recommend this DVD with five stars.",1386633600,3,1576,4.72
8234574,4,B000Z243HE,"This is a programme that I never saw in the UK, although I have been to David Rohl's amazing lectures on this theory.  Seems sad that I can only buy this DVD from USA when he's British.  Only four stars because wonderful as this programme is it's not quite as good as seeing him deliver it in person even with the stunning backdrops.",1378944000,,333,4.26984126984127
8234575,5,B000Z243HE,"although this edition a little dated its content is incredible.  definitely for those interested in thinking beyond religious dogma and tyrannical religion.

davids views are not 'you will believe' but things may have been wrongly calculated, described and accepted.

maybe biased as i do like the guy.

8234576,3,B000Z243HE,"The premise is very speculative and not historically accurate.  He claims that the Sumarians are the oldest civilization, which is't true.",1350086400,,138,5.571428571428571
8234577,5,B000Z243HE,"Fascinating DVD!  Think of it, a secular production verifies God's Word.  I love it.  And it is well done.  It holds your attention.  Amazon is such a great place to save money.",1319500800,,177,4.40625
8234578,5,B000Z243HE,"David Rohl is one of the most interesting, though controversial, renaissance men of our time.  He has looked at diverse historical data, including the Bible, Egyptian texts, ancient Persian writings, to name a few, and come to some interesting conclusions.  He is not a religous man, so he is not the typical religous scholar - instead, he uses the Bible as a valid historical document and matches it with other historical documents from various cultures and periods and makes startling ideas completely plausible.

After seeing this program on television some years ago, I bought Rohl's books - all 4 of them - and have become a convert to his theories.  At the worst, it is a fresh look at old evidence - at best, possibly an answer to the age old question, where did ""we"" (modern man) come from.",1273795200,8,798,4.719424460431655
