8104879,5,B000E3729U,"THIS A&E BIOGRAPHY ON OZZIE AND HARRIET NELSON IS A  MUST IF YOUR A FAN OF THIER TV SHOW. ITS GOT INTERESTING FACTS ON THE FAMILY, AND IT REALLY FOCUSES ON RICKY NELSON ESPECIALLY. THE ONLY COMPLAINT I HAVE ABOUT THIS DOCUMENTARY ON THE NELSON FAMILY, IT  DOESNT HAVE MUCH ON DAVID NELSON OR HIS FIRST WIFE JUNE AND THEIR CHILDREN TOGETHER, ACTUALLY THIER ARE NO REAL SNAPSHOTS OF DAVID'S CHILDREN ,OR WHEN THEY DIVORCED. OTHERWISE A VERY FACINATING DOCUMENTARY ,WORTH GETTING IT. AND ITS ALL REGIONS.",1205020800,,501,4.747126436781609

I watched their television series as a child and grew up with a tremendous crush on Ricky.  This ""Biography"" DVD was factual and well-done, and it kept my interest until the very end.  It contained some information that was new to me, also.",1142380800,4,374,4.23943661971831
