8353071,5,B0026LYMI2,Comic Value for the Money I was pleased with the laughter and seeing the comedians in their early years of performance. I know from watching this that Tim Conway improved as he went on with his career. The others all were amazing from the very beginning and I have shared viewing the disks with others that also laughed as I did.,1427673600,,329,4.409836065573771

8353074,5,B0026LYMI2,"What a cast of comics from long forgotten shows. Tim Conway is a scream. Wide range of comedy in this set with classic jokes from their acts. Redd Foxx is funny with a range of material from being poor,slavery,women,dwarves while making ice cream floats. Nice package & price was right. Seller was prompt with delivery.
