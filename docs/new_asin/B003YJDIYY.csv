8409421,5,B003YJDIYY,"This DVD is a great watch for people who love movies about important popular figures not only on the history of Brazil, but history in general. What is great about this film is that there are many important people who are depicted in this film, such as Olga Benrio, Luis Carlos Prestes, and then-Brazilian President Getlio Vargas. Personally, I am a fan of such films, and I would encourage people to watch this film when they get the chance.",1346976000,3,442,4.6075949367088604
