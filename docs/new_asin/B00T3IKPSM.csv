6999790,5,B00T3IKPSM,"Season 22 was excellent, even though it was cut short.  This DVD release includes the infamous two-part Patagonia Special as well as the ""final"" episode (basically two films edited together with James & Richard's connecting segments - and an elephant in the room).  Other high points of this season include home-made ambulances, a hilarious look at Peugot, and Richard Hammond awaiting rescue by his colleagues in the snowy wilderness.  Unfortunately, there are no extras.  It would be great to see the BBC release the earlier Top Gear seasons (1-9) so fans can have a complete set.  I certainly hope Amazon releases Clarkson, Hammond, & May's new car show (coming to Amazon Prime in autumn 2016) on DVD as well.",1438387200,9,712,4.949579831932773

6999795,5,B00T3IKPSM,"I loved the British show Top Gear with these three guys - Jeremy Clarkson, etc.  New 2016 version of the show is nothing like the older version.  Soooooo sad.  The original version made me laugh out loud. I wish they would sell more seasons of the show.  Update - There are many more seasons for sale at Amazon now!!  When I bought mine there were only 3 or 4 seasons available.",1486339200,,378,4.267605633802817

6999800,3,B00T3IKPSM,"I love Top Gear and have purchased three of the sets.  Then I got Top Gear 18 and was really surprised to discover that the harsh language wasn't bleeped out.  I ended up selling that set as a result.  Now, a few years later, I ended up buying this set because it was deeply discounted at a store that was going out of business.  Although the other content is hilarious and enjoyable, once again F-bombs and ""s***"" haven't been bleeped out.  It's really disappointing as my young kids have always like watching this show with me, but I'm not okay with that kind of language in my home.  I may have to sell this set as well, but does anyone know if a censored / bleeped version of season 22 was even released?",1478390400,2,708,4.285714285714286
6999801,5,B00T3IKPSM,"Loved it . The writing done by James May, Jeremy Clarkson, and Andy Wilman make this last series a keeper.",1478217600,,106,4.35
6999802,5,B00T3IKPSM,"The greatest TV show in history, but you already know that. The boys are at Top Form for Top Gear's final season. Sadly the final episode is not provided in this package. BBC feeling a little bitter maybe? Well they gave us fans the finger by omitting it so if you didn't see it broadcast then you are out of luck as reruns are no longer on BBC America. How's that new version working out BBC??? ...Dummies!! If I didn't already have Prime I would get it just for the new Grand Tour starring the boys on Amazon this November.",1477699200,2,525,4.26
6999803,5,B00T3IKPSM,"This was a very good season (that sadly is the last), with James taking on somewhat of a new persona with the Lotus on the Patagonia road-trip.

6999816,5,B00T3IKPSM,"Well, this is the last time you'll see the lads on this show.  And make no mistake, after twenty plus years, that is a void that is not easily filled.

I'll have to be blunt - the trio made the show.  It's odd to me that the BBC, who frankly made a fair amount of coin off the non-PC exploits of Clarkson, would suddenly find conscience.  True, the physical confrontation bit is a bad thing, but then on the other hand that shouldn't have merited more than a suspension if Clarkson's other antics/comments hadn't been held against him.  In other words, I think the BBC is trying to have it both ways.

Fortunately, there is Amazon and the upcoming show The Grand Tour featuring Our Heroes.  If you like the lads, there is light at the end of the tunnel.

But what about the season?  Well, like other seasons it has its highs and lows, from the riotously funny to the painfully awkward.  Seeing a Porsche 944 made into an ambulance is funny.  Watching Captain Slow with Tanner Foust, in what I think is a clumsy attempt to give Top Gear USA some cred, is awkward.  But then we get nice moments, like Hammond waxing poetic about the Land Rover Defender, which show that these fellows are real gearheads and not just playing a part.

The only problem with having this set is you become sad that there are no further episodes to be watched.  The lightning in a bottle has been released.  The magic is gone.  Which is a darned shame.  But fortunately, they live on in these DVDs, and that's something I suppose.  A good set.",1465171200,,1519,4.402877697841727

6999823,5,B00T3IKPSM,"If I could choose only one television show to watch for the rest of my life it would be Top Gear. Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond and James May always deliver a great show.

6999824,5,B00T3IKPSM,Absolutely Brilliant!!!!!  I waited for this season to get it on DVD for the Patagonia special. I am not disappointed. I also like the fact that most of the episodes were uncensored. the manufacturers of the TOP Gear discs need to make them for USA format. I would love to buy 1-21 if that happens!!,1461888000,2,299,4.4363636363636365

Only taking away 1 star because this is titled ""The COMPLETE Season 22"" but it does not include the final episode. That is false advertising. Still recommend the purchase but be warned you will have to find the final episode elsewhere. Thanks BBC.",1461456000,,371,4.723076923076923

6999828,2,B00T3IKPSM,"NOTE: I gave a low rating because there's NO Digital HD included!

I love Top Gear UK with Jeremy, James, and Richard as the hosts!  I agree with other posts that Season 22 was one of the best seasons with Jeremy, James, and Richard--despite being cut short.

I greatly dislike, however, that the BBC fails to include the Digital HD with the disc release!  Why hasn't the BBC joined the trend of other companies, like Warner Bros and HBO, and include the Digital HD with the discs?!?",1457395200,,483,4.517241379310345

6999832,5,B00T3IKPSM,"I have always enjoyed the show and the combination of Clarkson, May, and Hammond is by far the best that the show enjoyed. It is a real shame that the BBC refuses to release this final season with those presenters. In my humble opinion, why would the BBC spend the money to produce a show, promise a release date, and then not release it? It makes no sense, even with the debacle over Clarkson's actions. Someone needs to inform the BBC that although Clarkson's actions may have been wrong, it is still wrong for them to not let the fans of the show enjoy it.",1441670400,4,559,4.333333333333333
6999833,5,B00T3IKPSM,"I have to clarify.  I'm not sure I have seen this or not.  On BBC America they show episodes of Top Gear not previously aired on earlier seasons, (I have season 21 and earlier).  So I will have to wait for 22 to arrive.  All I know is that is a real shame that this hit series was pulled by the BBC.  I think they will rue their decision when the guys start their new show and blow the new Top Gear out of the water!",1440460800,,416,3.7906976744186047
