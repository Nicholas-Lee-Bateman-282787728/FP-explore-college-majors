7992385,1,B00009PJTC,"This has dvd was a big disappointment to me.  What I was expecting was something similar to what GLOW was like back in the late 80s and early 90s  My first problem with this dvd set is the actual physical appearance of the picture.  It looks like it was originally shot on videotape and the transferred to dvd.  The sound is also a problem, the announcers are loud enough but not the audio in the ring, there are times when the in-ring audio is so low that the announcers are actually drowning out what the wrestlers and managers are saying into the microphone while in the ring.  Also, instead of coming up with original characters there are a lot of blatant WWE rip-offs and they start from almost the first minute.  There's a male character called ""Smoke"" and he is supposed to be the villainous Commissioner of the WEW.  Smoke is doing everything he can to copy Dewayne ""The Rock"" Johnson from is appearance to his sound, I will give Smoke this, at a distance he does look like The Rock but not when the camera's up close.  There is also another character talking about what ""his father meant to this business"".  He identifies himself as ""Paul E. Dangersly"", for those of you who may not know, early in his managerial career, Paul Heyman was know by the name Paul E. Dangersly and this character is desperately trying to make people believe, I guess, that he's Paul Heyman's son.  Also there's another character trying to be like Stone Cold Steve Austin.

Now that I've covered all the rip-offs, I'll cover the real reason you're reading this review, pretty girls beating each other up.  On the cover, this product comes with a parental advisory warning, which I'm guessing, is because of drug use and language and fake blood.  If you're hoping for nudity, you'll be sadly disappointed (especially when you consider two of the performers are porn stars).  At one point, early on in the first disc the blond bimbo character, I think it's Barroom Barbie, has a wardrobe malfunction and her breasts are exposed, instead of letting the audience see her big breasts there' s a cgi ""oops"" over her breasts until she can put her wardrobe back together.  There are several ""lesbian moments"" where the girls smash their backsides into each others faces, but not nearly enough to my liking.  There is one ""faction"" in WEW that are evil hillbillies, 2 men and 2 women.  This faction has bodies that are absolutely disgusting to look at, one of the two women has to weigh at least 250 pounds, while one of the two men weighs 400 lbs if he weighs an ounce.  If you watched the WWF back in the 80s and 90s, then the 400 lbs hillbilly will remind you of Uncle Elmer.  The 400 lbs man has absolutely no place being on this dvd, he doesn't wear a t-shirt under his overalls, when he unhooks his overalls, there is a disgusting growth in the middle of his back that is about the size of a mouse that has to be some kind of tumor.  This 400 lbs monster splashes (aka lands on) the little girls and also grinds his backside, while exposing his tighty whiteys, into their face when the girls on in the corner.  There is nothing about the above that I found entertaining, it just looked like a giant man bullying and abusing poor little 105 lbs girls.

As I stated earlier, when I bought this dvd I thought I was getting something similar to GLOW that would be alpha females battling each other for dominance.  This dvd seems like it's women's wrestling for and by crack heads.  I say this because I don't understand the logic.  They're perfectly fine showing drug use and people fighting over ""stolen stash"", people swearing like sailors and men treating women like garbage but they find something wrong with showing a woman's beautifully naked breasts? I don't get the logic.",1426723200,2,3759,4.566318926974665

7992389,4,B00009PJTC,"The action are not as good as the Japanese women. It was probably never intended to be. In terms of techniques, the Japanese women wrestling is the best. The WEW and WWE divas have equally below average wrestling talents. They do get bloody though, FYI. However, the entertainment aspect is great. I totally enjoy it. The girls are good looking. They also try very hard to perform well. I really appreciate the effort. I prefer more wrestling moves like joint holds and submissions without hardcore stuff like chairs and blood etc. Unfortunately a few scenes (topless) are edited out. Overall I am satisfied.",1140048000,8,608,4.912621359223301
