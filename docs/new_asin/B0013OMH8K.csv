8252476,5,B0013OMH8K,"Laserdisc may not be preferred right now but this is the best copy available. The digital sound tracks are way better than DVD and have to be heard to be believed. Also the video is Criterion quality and is extremely sharp and colorful. If you still have a Laserdisc player, you should own this movie. Well worth it.",1300492800,,316,4.4655172413793105
