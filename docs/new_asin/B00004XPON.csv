1368507,5,B00004XPON,"It is really remarkable this historic film has made it on to DVD, and equally remarkable how small our concept of what a movie has become.  It seems that ever since Star Wars, you just can't make a movie outside the box anymore without getting completely shunned by the community, but not Billy Jack.  This and the first Billy Jack are probably two of the most successful independent films ever, but while 'original' Billy Jack introduces most of Laughlin's favorite themes, he mostly sticks to the straight course.  With Trial, all precautions are thrown to the wind, and the final result is something you just need to take in its entirity.  Like other films from this period, their is a strong dose of symbolism and attempts to even give the film a cyclical nature (the film is actually framed where the first 15 minutes or so of the film actually occur chronologically right before the end.)  To make an analogy to music, the early 70's was the period of progressive rock, free jazz and concept albums--but also too in film.  Tom and Deloris continue to experiment with improvisation in this film, their are folk musical numbers, and the presentation does manage to flow more like a psychedelic piece than a normal film (see Boorman's Zardoz for example.)  It is hard to say if everything done here is completely intentional, and there are a few points that are certainly hillarious without meaning to be so.  Still, I find myself enjoying the many messages here, including the fact that Billy Jack actually fails and really isn't the hero of the film.  The philosophies toward education are actually inspiring, and I think Deloris's acting here really shines throughout the entire film--and in the end it is hard not to belive she is the character she is portraying.
Well, in any event, this is a 3 hour THING and it isn't a perfect film and suffers at time from simple lack of budget, etc...but this also gives it a certain charm a lot of other films don't have.  Even if you don't care for the Billy Jack films, you have to give them credit for sticking with their dreams and fighting for it to the end.
If you enjoy independent, unique films with a strong vision, this is one worth seeing, and unfortunatley will almost necessitate purchase since it is not to be found in video stores.",977270400,4,2292,4.66501240694789
1368508,2,B00004XPON,"I really enjoy the BILLY JACK movies and my review would carry a much higher rating if this Panavision film was properly letterboxed!  TRIAL OF BJ and IN WASHINGTON were both shot in Panavision....IN WASHINGTON is letterboxed appropriately at 2.35:1, but TRIAL is pan & scan(full screen)--the viewer is missing a significant amount of the filmed frame!!
This is just a warning to folks such as myself who like to see movies the way they were meant to be seen, with the compositions unspoiled!  This is the only DVD in the set that opens with the Warner Brothers logo, so it is possible that this old Warner transfer is the only thing they had available for the production of this title--but it's too bad that the opportunity was missed to see this classic the way it was originally filmed!",976752000,3,789,4.669064748201439

1368532,1,B00004XPON,"At the end of ""Billy Jack"", the title character is arrested and faces trial...which lasts five minutes.  He gets a manslaughter conviction and spends four years in prison.  When he comes out, the Freedom School has prospered to the point where it even has its own television station, and it exposes corruption in the local town.  (The old bad guys are gone, but new ones have replaced them.)  The new local rednecks come and make trouble for the hippies, even burning down the television station.  Billy Jack uses his martial arts skills to fight them, but the rednecks make more trouble, then Billy Jack fights them off, then the rednecks try again, and Billy Jack...

You get the idea.  The whole thing repeats itself over and over with no real point.  Finally we get to the over-the-top ending, where the National Guard are called in, and they start shooting up the Freedom School, until the local Indians arrive, and their chief gives a solemn speech, after which the National Guardsmen stop shooting everyone and walk off.  Amazingly, only a few members of the Freedom School are harmed.

""Billy Jack"" had a meager charm, but this movie is just plain overdone and stupid.  It just repeats itself tediously and its message is so overblown it winds up ridiculous rather than educational.  Up there with ""Plan 9 From Outer Space""?  It easily surpasses it!",1403913600,4,1357,4.797413793103448

1368536,2,B00004XPON,"Oh what this movie could have been. The movie is nearly three hours, which is way too long, because an hour and a half of it is narration of liberal activism, philosophy, and Native American religion and mysticism. All very preachy. If you were to take all that out, it would have had half a chance as being a decent entertaining film. The conflict between the locals, the school and character Carl Posner could have been done much better. This movie was made during the time of Watergate, the sexual revolution, and at the end of the Vietnam War. If Laughlin had just stayed with the basic morality play, the peace and love philosophy (with a little karate butt kicking) theme would have played better. I especially thought the ending was a little over the top. It is too bad. If Laughlin had focused on the hero Billy Jack as a one man army kicking butt and setting things right, he may of had a string of Billy Jack movies, but let his ego and his activisim got in the way of his judgement. ""The Born Losers"" and ""Billy Jack"" were okay at least. I liked those two.",1387238400,,1067,4.393939393939394

We all have the same brain with the same goods and bads, the same responses...
All the reviews point out inaccuracies and lies.
They think the scenery is pretty and how fun it is to poke fun of somebody who was trying to make sense of a ridiculous time in American history. Maybe it wasn't right, maybe it wasn't wrong...
But now we never talk about it. We forget any atrocity that occurs and think that anybody that talks about anything is too political and wasting your time. Or we get all flag happy and stomp out dialog.
How weak.
Finding movies that are accurate is not the point...talking about what's going on and listening to different voices to make sense of it is important. Is vital in democracy.
Don't pan something bc you don't have to be bothered by the atrocities others have dealt with.
It takes more than three hrs to try to make sense of these things. I'm pretty sure it ears later nobody has fully examined it. We've all been shushed into fear. We've all been lulled by our better crafted entertainment. Kind of sad.",1374969600,4,1043,4.494736842105263
1368540,1,B00004XPON,"Billy Jack was pretty bad, but it was also enjoyable in a camp sort of way. The Trial of Billy Jack, with all of its lies, distortions, and over-the-top, cartoonishly evil characters, is just despicable. In one scene, a National Guard officer holds a pistol to another Guardsman's head and orders him to shoot and kill a peaceful, one-handed 13-year old boy (he lost his other hand when his father hacked it off in a fit of rage) who just wants to learn to play the guitar. It is way too long, and the acting (and singing) is really bad. It may be the worst movie I have ever seen; I would give it zero stars if I could.",1373500800,3,620,4.218487394957983
1368551,4,B00004XPON,"The movie ""Billy Jack"" and the ""Trial of Billy Jack"" brought back to me the history, and learning that took place in the 1970's. Decision making skills on both sides , the public and the law, needed great amount of improvement, and I feel that these two movies were instrumental in bringing about change in how unrests around the United States is handled today.

1368552,1,B00004XPON,"Simply put, it mega sucks, and here's why:

1. No coherent plot line, leftist drivel throughout, it's kinda like a serious, yet very disjointed ""Rowan and Martin's Laugh In"" type series of sketches.

2. The acting in this is horrible. Tom Laughlin is passable, at best, as an actor. His wife, Delores Taylor, to be charitable, has neither passable acting skills nor a charismatic appearance. You'll note that she hasn't starred in a lot of movies sans the Billy Jack series.

3. There's a young blond haired woman who can't really sing but who sings throughout this nonetheless, a balding doctor character who's passable from an acting standpoint, and some good scenic shots. In fact, the best thing about this entire movie is the scenery. And little else.

In closing, if someone calls you and offers you a chance to see ""The Trial of Billy Jack"" free of charge, ask them what you did to offend them. Then find something else to watch.",1345334400,8,936,4.723926380368098

1368554,1,B00004XPON,"This movie is a nearly 3-hour mess of badly written, badly acted, non-edited, and badly filmed New Left propaganda. As others have said, comparing the real-life school shootings to the Freedom School ""massacre"" is reprehensible. Watch the movie without being high (a novel concept to the original target audience) and see that the groovy, peace-loving Freedom School kids (actually, a lot of them look college-age at least) start the violence at the school before the the shooting starts. If anyone would be to blame for what happened, it would be them. And the unit commander ordering the reluctant soldier to fire at the kids - by putting a pistol to his head? Please. And then the reluctant soldier shoots little one-armed Danny in the back....and he himself has a son about the same age or so named Danny? Ridiculous.

This movie, incredibly enough, made some $31,000,000 - in 1975 dollars. That is some SERIOUS coin. Pot was definitely cheaper and more readily available, which explains two things - 1. Since it was so cheap, hippies, commies, and New Leftists had some money to spare to see this movie. 2. Someone would have HAD to been high to sit through this dreck.

Oh yeah - all that money the Laughlins made off of this film? A lot of it was blown making the next Billy Jack movie - the hysterically bad ""Billy Jack Goes to Washington"". A film so bad it never really was released! Want to have some fun? Either rent or buy this or ""Billy Jack Goes to Washington"". Invite people over. Strap everyone into chairs. Wait and see who is rendered completely insane from the drivel first! A fun party game!

1368555,4,B00004XPON,"I will give a more positive review than others have. ""The Trial of Billy Jack"" is the first Billy Jack movie I saw and it made me a fan. It tapped into many things which were important to me such as the Viet Nam war and a massacre similar to Mi Lai, the plight of the Native Americans and other forms of racism, martial arts, romance, etc. As Tom Laughlin freely admits now, they very much overdid it and threw in everything but the kitchen think. They felt that this would likely be the last Billy Jack movie and wanted to say everything they could think of. So, it is rather muddled. However, it has great cinematography by Jack Marta of Monument Valley, a wonderful score by the late, great Elmer Bernstein, an epic martial arts fight including the great Bong Soo Han as Billy Jack's ally, and very contemporary political issues. The reviewer above accurately points out that it was unfair to Kit Carson and his proposal about what should have been said was good. It was overly ambitious and much too long but, in my mind, still a very nice film.",1298246400,,1049,4.4404145077720205

entertaining at times, but disappointing, just too ""heavy"" on politics and paranoia. At that time, all I wanted was more action, more of ""Billy"", and the martial arts...If I didn't like the character, ""Billy Jack"" so much...I'd have probably not given the film much thought.
Over 30 years later I still like the character, and now have a more sentimental attachment to the films.
  I don't think I ever considered the ""historic accuracy""...I never took the movies as seriously as people seem to do today. To me, I was watching another Billy Jack movie. I liked the series of Billy Jack films in all their schlockiness and don't care much about ""historic accuracy"" or
over analyzing....There are just some films out there you can't take seriously, I know Tom Laughlin did then and does, but I don't care.

1368581,5,B00004XPON,"First, I wish to respond to the many negative reviews regarding this movie.  Evidently the people in this country do not learn their lessons, or they live with their heads in the sand.

The MAIN problem with ALL the negative reviews about this movie were the complaints of Tom Laughlin's self importance and battering of the system.  IF any of those who wrote negatively here, actually watched the movies, they would know that it states UNEQUIVICALLY, that these movies are fictional reenactments of specific events, that have been enhanced and expanded for the benefit of the movies.

I am sure the same fools that have written their drivel here, see nothing wrong with the enhancements, outright lies, and totally unrealistic events of many of the movies produced today (nearly 40 years after the Billy Jack series).

In the second of the series, the beginning of the movies lists many of the events of that time, where violance was used by OUR government against students who refused to allow the system to have so much control over a country that was supposed to be FREE!!!

Perhaps some of you should rewatch this movie, and look at the government you are living under today.  We are on the edge of a recession, the wealthy are getting wealthier while driving more middle class into financial ruin, child abuse is on the front page more and more, health care for the normal family is so insanely expensive that either other necessities are done without, or there is no medical coverage at all.  But the very acts that were occurring at the time of these movies are still occurring today, and in many instances more so.

Corporations and crooked politicians are robbing the people at an alarming rate, we are being TOLD that spying is NEEDED to protect our nation, even though that spying can and is invading areas that our government has no right to insinuate themselves.  The BIA has so mismanaged Indian funds that the government has managed to ""lose"" billions of Indian dollars, then simply state there is no way for them to accurately determine what has been STOLEN from them.

The idiot that made the comments about the incident in Vietnam should get familiar with the attrocities that occurred during that war, and many others.  There have been very few times throughout history, where the actual person or persons responsible for calling the shots, has EVER been prosecuted.  It is the policy of our government and our military to blame and punish a few lower level scapegoats, in order to pacify the ""ignorant"" public, then proceed with business as normal.  Look at what has happened during this war.  The men and women in our military are trained to blindly follow orders.  When they do and it becomes public knowledge and the public is angered by it, they punish those very same people for carrying out the ORDERS they were trained to follow.  Their CO's are not punished, just those that were expected to carry out the orders.

The entire Billy Jack series are great and if watched with an open mind and not just a thirst for action and violence, are quite thought provoking.  It is obvious by the state of our nation right now, that people are so complacent that they have learned NOTHING from the past.  The complacency of our people, and corrupt politicians are TOTALLY responsible for 9-11, and still they have learned NOTHING!  This is evident by the very candidates that are currently running for office.  Not a ONE of them has the best interest of this country, the middle class, or the poor at heart.  Freedom is what this nation was built on, and that was what this series tried to teach.  When crooked law enforcement and politicians can so easily sweep away that freedom, we are no longer in control of our own lives, and we have no say in what happens to us.

How much Freedom do you have now, and how much control over your future?  I'd say Washington, the oil companies, and corporate America have the control.

Tom Laughlin attempted to stir people up, in a way that would get people to watch, but obviously the message was lost to those who care more about action in the movies, than action in the control of their lives.",1201996800,15,4153,4.692413793103448
1368582,2,B00004XPON,"BILLY JACK closed with Billy being arrested for manslaughter. This film opens with an extremely long sequence featuring the director of the school Billy was protecting in the last installment, recounting a long list of grievances to a reporter. In this sequence, virtually every hippie stereotype and left wing cause is aired. Intermingled with this retrospective diatribe are flashbacks of Billy Jack's legal trial and prison sentence.

The ""trial"" referred to in the title does not seem to be the legal one mentioned above. After being released from prison, Billy undergoes a personal trial, replete with Indian mysticism. He is seeking to become a less violent person. This is the backdrop for the real point of the film.

All events lead up to staging a massacre at the school similar in nature to the historic one at Kent State University. The movie is virtually a tribute to those who lost their lives. Little else is accomplished in terms of story or drama.

The movie makes some valid and even good points about the politics of the day and indicts justs about everything associated with ""The Establishment"". It also back a few losing points of view. Whether these points of view are agreed with or not, however, the film could have been much stronger and made its point better.

This is a very long film. That made it proportionally more difficult to sit through. It is propaganda of its time. It has germs of truth within but those germs are lost with the sledgehammer method of delivering the message.",1186876800,4,1511,4.844961240310077

1368584,5,B00004XPON,"Despite what other people have said or have written I think the Billy jack series was great and this picture was no different.

When you last saw Billy Jack he was being taken to jail for involuntary manslaughter.

After Billy Jack undergoes a vision quest, the governor and the police plot to permanently put an end to their liberal shenanigans, leaving it up to Billy Jack to save the day.

1368585,3,B00004XPON,"You of course have to watch the first Billy Jack movie to really understand this one. In the first movie, Billy Jack stands up for the downtrodden free-spirited kids in a quiet western town - and gets into a fight that results in a few deaths. He wants to just make a stand and die, but Miss Jean Roberts, his girlfriend convinces him to turn himself in. That's where the story ends.

These movies were made during the times of rioting and political unrest, and it's important to keep that context in mind. Kent State is explicitly mentioned several times in the opening scenes, with Jean lamenting, ""students are slaughtered by trigger-happy police types and nothing is ever done about it.""

The movie is in essence a long flashback sequence. It starts where movie #1 ended, with Billy Jack being tried. Roberts is accused of lying about her rape. Billy explains how the US government killed innocent women and children in Vietnam - soldiers were told to ""waste them"". Billy refused to participate in that dastardly killing. My Lai is of course brought up here. At the end of the trial, Billy was tossed into jail, while the students work on growing the school.

We head into the school's world of biofeedback, meditation, yoga football, belly dancing and singing. The self-governing students work on child abuse and orphanages, and move on to exposing government corruption and consumer issues. They laugh about how corrupted Nixon was. Soon they have a TV station and broadcast news about abuses in the area. In retaliation, the students' phones are bugged and the FBI begins investigating the school.

Jean talks about loving child abusers instead of punishing them - that if child abuse organizations ""love"" bad parents, they will all start being nice to their kids.

Skip to scenes of blatant police brutality and also police feeling up women during searches. Typical quote - ""Police - they're so damned corrupt."" Oddly, for a movie which claims to champion the rights of women, there is a *lot* of gratuitous breast jiggling shots in this film.

I won't give away the ending, but I think you see the pattern here. This movie is *very* black and white. The kids are always good, noble, kind, and super-wise, super-intelligent (and sexy). The police, government and businessmen are always evil, corrupted and power-hungry (and ugly). Many of the statistics they quote to back their statements up are completely wrong. It's one thing to make a point, but it's quite another to lie in order to make your points. My boyfriend and I laughed out loud several times because the movie tipped so heavily into its over-the-top dialogue.

That being said, I can certainly understand how parts of this movie might appeal to viewers who had never heard of some of these concepts before. It's like people watching the Matrix and being wowed at the philosophies explained there, because they'd never learned them in high school. The Trial of Billy Jack covers many important basic ideas. The idea that people of honor should stand up for what's right even if it's difficult. The idea that you should focus, every day, on what is really important - not on blown-up but fleeting emergencies. The idea that even if people are violent or angry with you, that you should have the self-possession and maturity to stay calm and peaceful yourself in response. The idea that you should seek to find balance in your life.

These are certainly all very important philosophies, but there are many other movies which make these points without having to resort to exaggeration, untruths and stereotypes. I really like the message - but I don't like being led by the nose with wild inaccuracies to try to drive the message home. In many ways it makes the message far less palatable. In one scene you watch an entire roomful of ""regular people"" stand around while they torture a fellow human being. This isn't storytelling ... it's preaching, and I would hope that most audiences were able to handle issues in a more mature, realistic manner.",1166054400,14,4017,4.845481049562682
1368586,2,B00004XPON,"I was really intrigued by this film at first.  I'm a sucker for a long running time (this is the uncut version, running 174 minutes), so I decided to check it out.  It was actually one of the first films I ever rented from Netflix.  Having seen the whole thing, I can safely say that I've seen it once, and once was enough.  While there are some good scenes (some fight sequences are really good), the whole film is pedantic and preachy.  The sequence where Billy Jack goes into the mountain, hallucinates and sees green men is unintentionally hilarious.  The ending is also so ridiculously over melodramatic.  Everyone gathers to sing ""Give Peace a Chance"", which is a great song.  Unfortunately, here it ends up making you laugh more than anything else, which is a shame, as this scene comes right after a scene where national guardsmen shoot several students from Billy Jack's school.  So, instead of feeling sympathy with Billy Jack, his students, and the faculty of the school, you end up laughing.  That's not how you're supposed to feel.  The Trial of Billy Jack is an extraordinarily preachy film, with political correctness coming out of every frame (before the words political correctness became famous).  Even if you agree with some of the ideas (governments lie about war atrocities, the news media protects the government, etc., etc.), it hammers every point home so blatantly you end up just saying enough already.

Laughlin and his wife seem like nice people, on the surface anyway, but, unfortunately, they have a really twisted view of the world.  This movie criticized both Jesus Christ and Saint Augustine.  That's scary.  It mentioned ""befriending"" demons in the part where Billy Jack prepares to descend into the cave to seek the vision.

But the spiritual stuff (though it is false) is my favorite part of the movie.  The worst part of the original film, to me, was all the obnoxious young people vocalizing their uninformed opinions.  The Laughlin's daughter was not as obnoxious.  But most of them made Billy Jack look like George Bush in comparison.  And this type of stuff was most intense in this (very long) film.

And you know there is something wrong when the so-called ""good"" guys get killed, and you are glad.  Personally, I couldn't side with either group in this film.

1368590,2,B00004XPON,"Tom Laughlin returns as ""Billy Jack"" for the third time (Born Losers [1967], Billy Jack [1971]). Also returning is Laughlin's real-life wife, Delores Taylor as ""Jean"", Victor Izay as ""Doc"", Lynn Baker as ""Lynn"" and Susan Sosa as ""Sunshine"", Teresa Kelly, William Wellman Jr.
  We are first reminded of the shooting at Kent State in 1970 and other school massacres.  We then see Jean talking to reporters from the hospital bed. Billy Jack has been shot too.  They don't know if he will make it. Jean proceeds to tell about the horrible massacre that occurred on the reservation.
  On trial, Billy Jack could be arrested.  He just wanted to protect the Indians and thus he filed charges against the officers.  Jean's rape in 1971 is also discussed, but the lawyer does not believe she was actually raped.
  I was really disappointed in this third ""Billy Jack"" film.  The second film, BILLY JACK (1971), actually made you feel sorry for the Indians.  This third film is poorly-acted and over-acted.  It tries to be over-emotional.  It tries to stir up alot of issues.  They start with making statements about child abuse and later instead of making you feel something for the Indians, they actually are the trouble-makers in this film.  It is the Indians verses the police.
  The only scenes I found of interest were the Indian ceremony scenes when Billy Jack was hallucinating and being visited by spirits.
  John Navlin was the consultant for the filming of the Indian ceremonies.
  Note: Sacheen Littlefeather plays an attorney.  You may recall Miss Littlefeather on the 45th Academy Awards, March 27, 1973, when she walked onstage for Marlon Brando who just won the Best Actor Academy Award for The Godfather (1972).  He was ""refusing"" the award.  Littlefeather spoke on his behalf and said in part, ""Marlon Brando very regretfully cannot accept this very generous Award"".

1368601,1,B00004XPON,"""The Trial of Billy Jack"" was one of the bigger box-office hits of the 1970's.  Yet today it is almost utterly forgotten except by nostalgic, aging hippies and bad movie buffs.

The third of the four Billy Jack movies, and the second film in the series which expounded the far left political beliefs of its star/writer/director/producer Tom Laughlin, ""The Trial of Billy Jack"" is a nearly three hour exercise of sanctimonious self-aggrandizement and leftist political diatribes presented in the most juvenile manner possible.  It was also massive ego-trip on the behalf of Laughlin.

It may be understandable that Laughlin's ego was running on overdrive when he made this piece of dreck.  Afterall he had just scored a massive hit with 1971's ""Billy Jack.""  Written, directed, and starring Laughlin in the title role, ""Billy Jack"" was an updated version of ""Shane"" brilliantly marketed to flower children.  Basically, it was a violent action movie with a protagonist that punched, kicked, and shot his way through waves of rednecks in order to make the world safe for flower power.  ""Billy Jack"" is now laughably dated, but how it was marketed set the standard for today's blockbusters and it influenced Stallone's ""First Blood"" and several Steven Seagal movies.  However, Laughlin failed to see that the success of ""Billy Jack"" had mainly derived from its being a shrewd action flick with a counter-culture bent, and instead misinterpretated that it was the film's leftist politics that had been the driving force behind its success.

The result of that misreading was ""The Trial of Billy Jack"" which contains hours of rambling discourse on Indian rights and political corruption and tons of faux American Indian spirituality, but not enough of the kung fu for peace violence that had made ""Billy Jack"" such a hit with drug-addled, hypocritical hippies.  In other words- it's BORING!  Oh, it does contain scenes of Billy Jack punching faces, breaking bones, and crushing throats in the name of peace and love, but those scenes are few in comparison to the non-stop sanctimonious preaching on the part of Laughlin and his homely, untalented wife and co-star, Delores Taylor, who plays ""Jean"" the director of the absurd Freedom School and Billy's main squeeze.

The actual trial in ""The Trial of Billy Jack"" is just a small part of the film.  Billy is convicted and receives a light jail sentence for killing at least two people during the events of ""Billy Jack.""  (It's hard to take seriously the film's constant attacks on the oppressive ""system"" when that system sends a murderer to jail for just a few brief years.)  Meanwhile Jean's Freedom School becomes a force of political agitation through ""scorching exposes"" of politicians and capitalists by founding a television station and inventing a machine that can tell when a person on TV or radio is lying.  Of course, ""the Man,"" who is the victim of these ""scorching exposes,"" is determined to shut down Jean and her Freedom School by any means possible.

Billy is released from prison and reunited with the love of his life, his hat.  Tensions rise between the Freedom School hippies and the powers-that-be and their redneck goons with Billy saving hippie butt from redneck beatdowns.  Tears flow constantly from Jean.  And it goes on and on.  By the end, when the National Guard storms the school and starts blasting hippies, you'll be cheering: ""Get them!""

""The Trial of Billy Jack"" was Laughlin's last hurrah.  To his credit, he had made this movie with his own money so his vision would be uncomprimised.  When critics justifiably savaged the movie, Laughlin retorted through full page ads in major newspapers.  The end result was that Laughlin lost most of his fortune.  He also lost his audience.  The kids may have shown up for opening weekend in droves with visions of the violent ""Billy Jack"" in their memories, but they never came back after the borefest that is this film.  The last ""Billy Jack"" movie, ""Billy Jack Goes to Washington"" was barely released and Laughlin quietly disappeared from the film scene.",1127606400,3,4075,4.995555555555556
1368602,1,B00004XPON,"I saw this movie in late 1974 when it first came out. I noted the references to historical incidents such as the Kent State shooting, My Lai Massacre and Watergate among others. I did a lot of research on the claims made by Laughlin's movie and was appalled at the inaccuracies and down right lies.
  I sent a long letter to Tom Laughlin's business Billy Jack Enterprises. He never answered me. That was 30 years ago. Now he has a website. I sent him an email version and he didn't answer that either.

 In the beginning Jean (Delores Taylor) is being interviewed. She refers to Kent State (the May 4, 1970 shooting of 13 students at that university) and claims Attorney John Mitchell said there was no need to investigate the incident because he knew in advance the Guardsmen couldn't be responsible for the shooting. This is absolutely wrong. Mitchell never made that statement and the FBI was out at the campus the next day investigating.
  Jean also said that even after fault was found on the part of he Guard ""as usual Washington did nothing about it."" Unbelievable, considering that when this movie was being made (in 1974) federal prosecutors indicted four guardsman!

 In another part of the film, Billy Jack is referring to My Lai and all the ""colonels and generals and White House aides who ordered the whole affair."" White House aides? This is preposterous. (But it sounded sexy and intriguing during the Watergate era.) For the record, one lieutenant colonel ordered the offensive into the area and Lt. Calley himself ordered the massacre.

  Moving on, Jean says about another situation, ""I remember because [President] Ford had just shocked the nation by pardoning Nixon and agreeing to let him destroy the tapes.""  The second part is another untruth. Ford actually just gave Nixon partial control over access to the tapes, which were put in the custody of the General Services Administration in San Clemente. Nixon was given no authorization to destroy the tapes.
  And then there is the issue of the ""International Seminar on Child Abuse"" which contains more nonsense.  The movie makes Jean and the Freedom School look like they are the great enlightened champions of humane treatment of abusers and portrays the world of  professional  therapists as being in the Dark Ages.
  A doctor says: ""So in summary, you're saying that to love these people that we find dispicable, that we hate. And I can really hate these people that cut off the fingers of their children and beat their children. And that somehow in the experience of loving them, they're going to change before our eyes and stop beating their children?""
  She isn't even sounding like a doctor, she's sounding like a cynical police officer. This is one of the more egregious misrepresentations in the film. In reality, the Freedom School's methods of treatment were the contemporary standards among mental health professionals at that time! (and still are)

  In another part, an Indian spiritual guide told Billy that Kit Carson had 400 Navajo men, women and children rounded up and massacred in a cave. This is another fabrication. There is no record of Carson doing such a thing. What the scriptwriters could have mentioned is that some Spaniards committed such an atrocity. They rounded up some Indians in a section of Canyon de Chelley in northwestern Arizona and killed them in a cave in 1804. The cave is called ""Massacre Cave"" not  ""Cave of the Dead"" (the movie phrase).
  Also, the writers could have mentioned a factual outrage by Kit Carson, his ""Trail of Tears"" death marches of Indians in 1864 to Bosque Redondo in New Mexico.

  There is more I could mention. Laughlin, as the main producer, was incredibly irresponsible with the script. No one should take the claims made in this movie seriously.",1123459200,41,3789,4.865834633385336
1368603,4,B00004XPON,"This is a very good follow up to the excellent second BJ film, Billy Jack. Born Losers was actually the first BJ film. Laughlin is brilliant as Billy once more here and his real life wife, Delores, excellent as Jean again. As for some of the rest of the cast well their daughter Theresa is back as student Carol, now more of a young lady than little girl as in the previous film, and she's appealing in her many scenes. The actors playing bad guys this time around are talented-enough actors but their characters are not particularly distinct as the bad guys in films one and two were. The action scenes are done well enough but there's no equal to that park brawl, in film 2, anywhere in this picture. But on the big plus side we learn lots more about BillyJack and his past in Vietnam. Missing now but whom were in film 2 are cutiepie Julie Webb as Barbara, whom Jean obtained legal custody of at the end of film 2. I think we are supposed to believe Barbara is somewhere in that melange of students we now see but her presence is something we sourly miss. Also, Clark Howat as the Sheriff, the one here in this film is not anywhere near as interesting a fellow. Plus, Bert Freed as rich bigot Stewart Posner.

The movie starts out long by tracking the trial of Billy Jack (hence the name)that does not resemble much of a real trial at all.  It is only a format for Tom Laughlin to spot many of his esoteric views.
The next chapter of the film is notoriously long as the character Jean (Taylor) continnues to recounts events from a hospital bed about the kids at the ""school"" and the local evil rich people.  This movie is just too preachy and it never bothers to examine some of their (school) prejudges and uncivil behavior.
The only redeeming value is that Tom Laughlin still brings out a ""Billy Jack"" persona.  Tom is Billy jack, and is convincing in the role he was made for.  The fght scenes, with Hapikido Master Bong Soo Han are, for its time, very good and still worth watching.",1006128000,11,930,4.544910179640719

It starts with a scene of the southwest and lists some of the conflicts in the early 1970s. People were shot and wounded at the Freedom School. Will this shut it down? A reporter questions a woman in a hospital bed. [A pretty large room?] Then they show the Trial of Billy Jack years earlier. Billy explains his personal philosophy. Miss Roberts testifies. Billy tells about a massacre of civilians in Vietnam. Waste them! is the order from Saigon. Lock and load. Soldiers are trained to kill on orders. Was Calley a hero? Billy recalls past events. [Is that an example of brain-washing by the corporate media?] Billy is found guilty. Officials talk about the future. Billy goes to prison.

The Freedom School was closed, but they found an abandoned military base as a replacement. They start a local TV station to present their views and news. One new invention (a Voice Stress Analyzer) can tell if a person is lying. [But not what he or she is lying about. There seems to be too much padding in this movie. The references to current events (Nixon) are old history today.] The FBI questions the parent of a student. Miss Roberts is interviewed. Child abuse or battering is a big problem. [Caused by a poor economy?] A guard strikes Billy in jail; will he react? Miss Roberts explains child abuse. [Is it really an epidemic?] They show a big crowd. Will Billy cooperate with the warden as he leaves prison? He returns to the school. A teenage girl sings. There is an exhibition of fighting. Later they show a skiing accident. Will the hospital treat an Indian? Hunting deer out of season?

Police search students (do they have a warrant?). The police chase and beat a teenager. The crowd is told to disperse. Only one man remains. Native Americans complain about their treatment. Can they take a case to the World Court? Indians are not allowed to hunt on their lands. They visit the hunters camp. Is it sport? [Yes.] There is an exchange of opinions. The men are shot - with a camera (they don't like that). More strange scenes follow. Billy Jack undergoes a ceremony. Officials want to claim a child. Their telephone is being tapped; they can listen in even when the receiver is on the hook! [Thank you, Bell Labs.] Do marches and demonstrations do any good? [It depends.] A man descends a sheer cliff. [The long shots suggest a body double.] A cobra in this country?

Billy Jack finds more snakes in the cave but walks among them. [Another double with steel under those long pants?] Squeals from bats. He meets his inner self. Go to the desert. Men watch TV in the desert. There is another test. What can the students do in protest? Billy eschews violence. There is a parade, like an old-time circus, in town. Men show up to attack the students and burn their bus! Billy shows up to converse with these men. A mans car goes into the river! Does a local bank control the local politicians and the local economy? [There is too much padding and repetition here.] The crowd of people just stand and watch. Has Billy slowed down? Will Posner escalate the violence? Yes, a man is shot dead. Grandfather is arrested. Blue Elk is kidnapped and beaten. Billy Jack arrives, men arrive to threaten him. There is a fight (for action). One mans knife fails him. Posner fires his pistol! Billy Jack stops Posner.

The ambulance removes the victims. Police arrive, a police car is overturned. Get Billy Jack says the governor. The military arrive at the Freedom School to arrest Billy Jack, he surrenders to the police. There is a stop on the highway. Billy Jack escapes to drive away in a police car. Should they resort to violence? Federal troops surround the Freedom School. Students burn down an old shack. Soldiers shoot at the students! Young Danny is shot in the back! Some soldiers drop their rifles. [This recreates the Kent State massacre of May 1970.] They must keep fighting for their beliefs. There is a song by a young woman.

This movie is not as violent as the real events it was based on. Can we make this a better world by opposing the corporate interests who only seek to oppress the common people? I think this movie runs on too long and is too diffuse in trying to cover too many topics. Billy Jack Goes to Washington is the best and last of the series (it is based on that 1939 movie). Four decades have passed, will there ever be another movie that supports populist politics?",1431561600,,4424,4.593670886075949

Since them I have been working at purchasing my old favorites from my VHS storehouse in the DVD format so I can still watch them. And Billy Jack and The Trial of Billy Jack were two of the first ones I purchaced. From some of the reviews I understand that there are many who do not like the Billy Jack movies, and I can understand that. But I happen to have grown up during the time that the movies take place in and even though it was a difficult time as shown in this series of movies, I find the movies meaningful and well-done. Both Billy Jack and The Trial of Billy Jack are also very long movies which is another reason some do not like them. But for me that is the beauty of them being on a DVD. I don't have to watch the entire movie at one sitting. I can stop it whenever I want and come back and watch the rest at a later time or a later day. I have several movies that are very long (i.e. Exodus, Shindler's List, etc) and the length does not stop me from watching them. So I like both Billy Jack and The Trial of Billy Jack very much. I believe it has something important to say, and I enjoy movies that have something to say to us, something that makes a difference. I also enjoy other types of movies as well, those that make me laugh as well as cry and even some fluff stuff.
