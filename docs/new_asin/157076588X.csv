7797198,5,157076588X,We have several horse trainers to help us but received too many different opinions on the same subject so decided to ask the Pro Buck Brannaman whom we respect for his firm but gentle ways.  Have had trainers that were too soft because they didn't know what to do or others that were just always heavy handed not that way with Buck Brannaman while not cheap to buy worth more than the price.,1426982400,,391,4.3561643835616435
7797199,5,157076588X,Buck Brannamans' 7 Clinics is worth all the time it takes to institute these practices. I've experienced immediate and positive results within my herd of 3 horses. I highly recommend Buck beyond any other clinician.,1425513600,,215,5.171428571428572

7797202,5,157076588X,"The ""7 Clinics"" Series of DVDs is a great tool for anyone wanting to improve their relationship with their horse. I have applied what I learned from Buck and I have a much better understanding of my horse. Isn't that what we want? I have series 1-2, and 3-4. I will soon be purchasing 5-6. My riding has improved as well.",1382918400,2,321,4.278688524590164
7797203,5,157076588X,All I can say is I loved them all!! I just wish there were more of them  and possibly a study guide to go with them.,1368144000,,116,3.4615384615384617
7797204,3,157076588X,"I have only watched about half of this so far, but from what I've seen so far, three stars. Buck has a lot to teach about horses, but these videos do not capture it. There are clips from various clinics, showing riders doing/attempting what Buck has told them to do. We come in during the ""practice"" part of the lesson and miss the instruction. We also see the riders attempts, but are rarely told who is doing it right or what needs to be changed.

So you see a dozen people doing ""stuff"" with horses while Buck sits on his horse and talks. If you're already familiar with Buck's teaching, you don't learn anything new. You don't get to see Buck ride much, either.",1356566400,9,665,4.362903225806452
7797205,5,157076588X,"I am pretty sure my partner will love this dvd, as much as the rest of them that were purchased for him about Buck and his clinics.",1356220800,,131,3.888888888888889
7797206,5,157076588X,"I purchased ""Buck"" from Amazon after viewing a friends and watching it all over and over. Yes i did not want it to end and was disappointed it was only 88 minutes but there was also fasinating extras. I have watched my own ""BUCK"" many times also. I love horses, they are the most MAJESTIC animal God created. I am saddened to know many may be abused by their owners. As with all animals ( Say Dog) when they have behavioural problems it is not the animal but the human who must treated how to communicate and teach the animal what is appropriate. As for Buck Brannaman, the man, i just love him and want to hug and care for him. He is such a kind, caring and intelligent human being. Most people would just repeat what their father had done round and round. It is a credit to him he had the intelligence to say to himself. ""This stops here, i will not inflict such cruelty on my family, friends and animal family. His older retired horses are in Horse heaven at his Ranch. His interaction with his wife, his daughter and other humans including horses is a delight to see. There he can glimpse what his personality may have been like before his FATHER NULLIFIED and tried to break his character until others intervened. Please if you have over 300 minutes of footage surely you could put together another ""BUCK 2"". It would sell like hot cakes. I 100% recommend this dvd to all lovers of animals and of decent loving humans. A real feel good story. There is always some things we regret as we age we did not not pursue, hobbies and loves we did not do. For me it is learning to be a competent horse rider adn the second is not further pursuing learning to ride a motorcycle. My brother ended my ambitions after seeing me do a wheel stand consequently i came off the back. He understands my love of motorbikes he has two huge motor bikes a Triumph 900 and a limited edition Italian motorbike 1000 which is new and i can not remember the name. All i know is it is in Italian colours and is beautiful just like all the horses around the world.",1354665600,,2039,4.3125
