8092435,5,B000BTH4KY,We are planning on giving Kidsloveanimals.com's African Safari as a holiday gift to friends with children this year.  This DVD of a safari in Kenya and footage from a safari park is unusual in its close focus on a wide variety of African animals. The viewer feels as if they are actually there.  My husband and I have been on an African safari together in Kenya and this DVD really made us feel we were on safari again.  We loved this DVD and think you will too.,1165276800,,462,4.287356321839081
8092436,5,B000BTH4KY,"I may never be able to take my whole family to Africa for an animal safari but this DVD was a very affordable alternative.

This DVD is different from others in that is does not have a long spoken narrative.  The various game parks in Kenya are introduced by kids who tell you what animals to look out for and other interesting facts.  After the kids' introductions, each park features great footage of the animals & their habitat with the narration provided by an inspiring soundtrack perfectly choreographed to the personality of each animal.

The DVD appeals to many ages.  My three year old nephew watches the DVD with rapt attention.  My daughter's first grade class protested when the teacher stopped the DVD before it was done.  My third grade son loves it.  Adults will enjoy the journey, the beauty of the animals, the music, and the opportunity to share an entertaining & educational experience with their family.  Highly recommended.  It is nice to have something to watch that the whole family can enjoy!

This is what my seven year old daughter has to say about the DVD (in her own words):  I like to stop the DVD and draw the animals.  I like to see the animals in their natural habitat.  I like the pretty colors of the Bee-eater.  I like to see how their personalities are different.  I like to see how it is to spend time with African animals.  I like to get a globe out and find the places they go.  I like the music.  I like how it makes you feel like you are in Africa.  I like to see how the flamingos walk.",1164326400,6,1528,4.408602150537634
8092437,5,B000BTH4KY,"We just watched this video and all loved it. It is appropriate for kids of all ages (I'm 44!)  It was fast enough to keep my kids interested, but still focuses on animals long enough to really get a good look at them. You get a sense of what it is like on a real photo safari in Africa. My kindergarten aged son was fascinated by the hot air balloon ride and we all laughed at the antics of baboons and mongooses. While there are slight hints at the predatory side of the ""big cats,"" there is nothing too graphic for littler kids to see.  The background music is delightful and captures the spirit of the animals on the screen. Don't miss the bonus features. Overall, really delightful.",1131321600,6,686,4.3515625
