8695358,4,B00RI4V1IQ,"I only purchased this DVD because Lina Leandersson was in it and overall it's not a bad film. I liked it but it won't be a classic anytime soon. It only runs 75 minutes and I'm sure this film would be much more appreciated in Sweden than the USA. After seeing Lina Leandersson's role as Eli in the great film Let the Right One In, I'm always interested in any other films that she appears in. Her screen time is not very lengthy but she is very good in her small role.  I won't go into detail on the storyline as it is can be found elsewhere. Some will like it, some won't. It is only available in the non USA format so a multi-region Blu-Ray/DVD player is required to view it.",1435622400,2,677,4.128787878787879
