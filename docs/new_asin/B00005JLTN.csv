1462066,5,B00005JLTN,"For the simple reason that so many people who even don't like it not that much don't realise when writing the movie that this is a movie split into 2, unlike LOTR which is also split but those split like in the book where they were meant to be split, Reloaded is split right in the middle of Matrix 2 cut into half into reloaded and revolutions, Matrix Reloaded is what Matrix originals first half was like, story development and little action, while matrix revolutions is like the second half of the matrix original with most of it action x 100, you cannot get a full review of reloaded without seeing matrix revolutions, there will always be doubters but they will mostly change thier minds after looking at the epicness of Revolutions which will make the matrix original look like a cartoon. Matrix Reloaded is a perfect set up to the final movie. Per say Revolutions won't have a bigger opening as Reloaded at the Box Office but it will have much stronger legs than Reloaded because most epic trilogies last movie always do just like Return of the King is expected to do and just like Indiana Jones ATLC did. I feel sorry for the people who say this movie is the worst they have ever seen. I hope these people don't like movies like Kangaroo Jack or Ballistics: Ecks vs Sever or rather Charlies Angels 2. If you want to say its the worst movie then you should wait until you see Matrix Revolutions and Reloaded together. 5.5 hours. im sure you won't sit in the theatre that long, thus the split in between. my 2 cents",1059350400,,1521,4.455197132616488
1462067,1,B00005JLTN,"I don't understand why some people think this film is good because it is not.
Don't waste your time in this ""movie"".
I say it cause I lost 2 hours of my lime watching this stupid film.
Do yourself a favor and get ""The lord of rings: Fellowship of the ring and Da two towers "" because these movies are excellent, classics.
MATRIX RELOADED HAS TO WIN THE AWARD FOR THE WORST FILM OF THE YEAR !!!!!",1059264000,,395,4.142857142857143
1462068,5,B00005JLTN,"Words cannot describe the greatness of this sequal. It was not dumbed down to an unintelligent audience - but instead raises the bar in how engaging and entertaining a movie can be. And, if you do not have the brains to follow the plot, or amazing philisophical speeches, than be awed by the amazing effects. Great job Wachowski's, this is one heck of a movie!!!",1059177600,9,362,4.584615384615384
1462069,5,B00005JLTN,"Whoa. An unbelievable mindjob brought to you by the Wachowski brothers. ""Reloaded"" is a fast-paced movie; if you're not careful, you might get whiplashed. For starters, the special effects featured in this film far surpasses the previous ""Matrix"" installment. Consider bullet time the appetizer. ""Reloaded"" gives you the full meal. Neo's ""burly brawl"" with the Agents include a blistering 360 degree camera swing while he spins furiously around a metal post. Real? Like the Matrix itself, no. That scene was all done completely by CGI. The freeway chase is no picnic, either. $2.2 million worth of cars alone were trashed just for those 14 minutes- in addiiton, millions were poured into the making the freeway itself. Trinity is an angel without wings here, as she rips up the road on her Ducati motorcycle, with agents in tow. This chase alone is worth the $8. Other visual goodies include battle scenes that resemble lethal ballets- the martial arts performed by Neo, Trinity, Morpheus and company are heavier, more intense. So intense, I forgot to breathe at some points.
Many have complained about the plotline of ""Reloaded"", critics included. No movie is perfect, but frankly, you cannot compare ""Reloaded"" with the first ""Matrix"". Why? For one, the purpose of the first ""Matrix"" was to build the background of Neo, his journey into the unknown, his initiaion if you will, into hero-dom. While the first ""Matrix"" focused only on a few characters, ""Reloaded"" expands on the character cache, which can be a bit confusing at times, but will undoubtedly be effective in one way or another in ""Matrix: Revolutions."" Also, in ""Reloaded"", we see more of Zion, something that is different from the first. It is here in Zion that we see Trinity and Neo consumate their love for each other. A bit random, I have to say, and although seemingly pornographic at times, [ mild techno pounds in the background ] I throughougly enjoyed the fact that Trinity and Neo share that love between them- their relationship is more developed, emotional- Trinity is seen as leather-clad, but more feminine and sexier. Neo has taken a more Christ-like role this time around. Although still doubtful of himself at times, he is almost god-like, endowed with a multitude of new powers, like flying. The recurring dilliema through ""Reloaded"" seems to be choice, free will, and fate. Neo is to choose between saving humanity or saving Trinity; will love prevail, or will duty? Is the prophecy indeed true, or merely a hoax, a lie to disguise the truth? What was perceived to be real, is fake, and what is fake, is in actuality, real. Confused? Mindjob, I kid you not. Don't blink, and please, use the restroom before the movie. I took what possibly was the quickest piss in history. Not fun. Humor is also a subtle, yet effective play in ""Reloaded""- dry humor, but humor nevertheless.
If you're not familiar with the philosophy that serves as the frame of the movie, you probably won't experience the maximum effect of the film. Following the writings of Plato, the Wachowski brothers shape Neo as Socrates, who is told that his mind will inevitably set the people free. Very spiffy. Eerily enough, Socrates is put on trial and sentenced to death, which brings to mind another question: does Neo die? Religious allusions are abundant as well. The Christian references are in no way hindering- all in all, the mythology, religion, and philosophy that the Wachowski brothers bring in, accentuate the film's main purpose.
Neo is shown to have powers outside of the Matrix- what does it all mean? And if things in the Matrix can alter the real world, is ""the real world"" another Matrix? ""Revolutions"" holds the answers to these questions, and holds the final chapter in the battle for Zion. It hits theaters November 5th of this year. For now, satisfy your cravings with a healthy dose of ""Reloaded"", and do watch the first one again.",1059177600,,3904,4.907715582450832
1462070,4,B00005JLTN,"It never ceases to amaze me how some people think that they are demonstrating their incisive, critical capabilities when they try to inform us other poor incapable viewers about supposed plot shortcomings or other similar failings.  Do they really think that I will or will not purchase the DVD based on their evaluations?? When it really comes down to it, film enjoyment is a matter of personal taste, notwithstanding what I am told is a weakness.  One person's downside is another's up.  So, it doesn't matter to me if one of your reviewers said that the movie should not have tried to be ""Philosophy 101"" (it wasn't), or that the ""orgy scene"" was hokey (it was), or that Keanu Reeves' acting was ""wooden"" (maybe).  When the rubber hits the road, the movie was ""kick-[butt]"" in terms of CG and great fight scenes, and being pleasing to the eye.  It continued the story, entertained, had a great score, and had a real cliffhanger of an ending.  At the film's conclusion, I was left saying to myself that I can't wait for ""Revolutions.""

1462071,4,B00005JLTN,"This was a great movie.  A worthy sequal, It was what i was expecting out of the sequal. If you do not pay attention then you will get lost very fast. It has a lot of action yes, but then again it is an scifi action movie.  After all people seem to forget that the matrix is not a real world, but one where  anything is possibile. The plot makes you think, just like the first one, and for some people it may require a litlle to much thinking. If you liked the first one for more reasons then just the bullet time then you will like this one as well.  The DVD gets only 4 starts because it looks to lack deleted scenes and such just like the 1st one.",1059177600,,650,3.9389312977099236
1462072,5,B00005JLTN,"I've found a disturbing trend in those who didn't like this movie: they did not understand it.  The simpletons will certainly love the none stop, new-level action this movie has to offer.  And that's fine.  But some of us actually listened to the dialouge.  To explain the plot of this movie would consume pages and hours, I suggest a truly intrested person read the explanations that CorporateMofo.com has to offer.  Or just pick up an encyclopedia and look up Gnostic Philosophy.  A few of the simpler implications are as follows;  Neo is the sixth to make this journy.  He had five predecessors, comprable to the Five Books of Moses- Neo, or ""New"", is The New Testament-  Neo is Jesus.  It is my prediction that he will be Crucified in the third, final film.  Another miniscule tidbit I found interesting was the love scene between Neo and Trinity-  below an arch-  a reference to emaculate conception.  This suggests that trinity is pregnant, possibly even with the Anti-Neo.  And one more - Neo stops the Sentinels with his hands in Zion, he shouldn't be able to.  This suggests that Zion is yet another program in the matrix, indicitive of mactrices upon matrices.  There are many more intruiging aspects of this movie, too many to list.
This movie doesn't ""rip off"" any other movie, it uses influences from many different religions, as well as making those references double entendres with computing terms.  It's clever as heck.
I happen to think this film most enjoyable when understood.  But that's just my opinion.",1057795200,3,1524,4.837209302325581
1462073,4,B00005JLTN,"Twice have I seen this movie in the theaters now, and twice I came out feeling fullfilled, as well as full of anticipation for the third installment.
Let's get one thing straight: this movie should not be watched as a sequel to 'the Matrix'...in fact it is primarily a set up for what I would expect to be an explosive finale to an excellent mini series...it builds on concepts set forth in the first movie, expands on them but leaves enough for the viewer to guess about the nature of the Matrix, the future of all the characters and the war itself.
The movie starts slow...until the now infamous 'rave scene' (ridiculed and bashed by countless, but considering that the humans are gearing up for a final battle I actually believe that it is a very appropriate scene) it takes a while for the movie to get started. But once you get past that the movie takes off in a fierce rollercoaster ride that will last over an hour...once it gets going the movie is over before you know it, leaving you wanting more.
Some scenes are indeed redundant, like the fight between Neo and the Oracle's bodyguard. That fight, though a delight in choreography, felt a little out of place in the grand scheme of the entire movie.
Overall it's very enjoyable, thrilling, and I would recommend it to anyone who asks.",1054080000,2,1294,4.55793991416309

1462252,5,B00005JLTN,"There is a bit of a bad aura around this film (and particularly part 3) since they do not live up to the first Matrix. While that is true, this movie is really impressive. The pacing is a little clunky and the Zion scenes are not very good, but it has some of the best action I've ever seen. It has probably the best, and certainly the most exciting car chase I've ever seen. The CG fights are amazing, particularly considering how long ago they were made.

1462467,4,B00005JLTN,"""Matrix Reloaded"" picks up where ""The Matrix"" left off, where Neo is trying to adjust to his god-like powers and what he's meant to do. He's haunted by visions of Trinity's death, which he fears he will cause. He's given a mission by the Oracle to head to the source of the Matrix, which requires a complex path involving a ruthless kingpin known as the Merovingian and a rogue program called the Keymaker. At the same time, Agent Smith returns with the power to turn others into copies of himself, threatening to stop Neo for good.

One thing that this movie showed is how dedicated the Wachowskis are to pushing the boundaries of moviemaking and special effects. They just come up with an idea for a sequence and leave it to others to figure out how to do it.

The fight in the playground (known as the Bully Brawl) is a perfect example, where Neo has to fight hundreds of Agent Smiths at once. The sequence involved casting dozens of stuntmen who all were tweaked to look like Hugo Weaving, and heavy use of CGI. While the CGI sequence doesn't hold up too well, it's still an amazing fight.

Another epic sequence involves an explosive chase along a freeway. The Wachowskis didn't overdo the CGI for this one, but had the production build a full-scale length of freeway and drive real cars along it at sixty miles an hour to shoot it. In one moment, Trinity drives a motorcycle the wrong way down the road, and Morpheus fights an agent on the top of a moving semi trailer.

""Reloaded"" continues the topic of philosophy and religion from the first movie. There's a lot of conversation about free will and destiny, where some question Morpheus' commitment to the prophecy. Neo also finds a shocking truth that undermines his belief in the system and his role in it.

Unfortunately, the movie doesn't hold up especially compared to the first one. It's a perfect example of style over substance.

Whereas the first movie had the clear goal of Neo learning the Matrix and becoming the One, ""Reloaded"" doesn't introduce the goal of Neo going to the Source until halfway through. Even then, the journey is confusing and not clearly defined with the team going to get the Keymaker without even knowing why they need him. We don't even really know why Neo needs to go to the Source. Without a clear goal, the audience is left to just assume what he's doing is important, which is frustrating.

Also, the debates about free will and destiny are interesting, but not as mind-blowing as the original movie's exploration of the nature of reality.

Hollywood also needs to learn that fight scenes are only truly exciting when there are high stakes involved. The fight between Neo and Agent Smith in the first one was thrilling, not because they did cool moves, but because he was fighting for his life and his right to be the One. In this movie, fight scenes are almost pointless. The Bully Brawl is great, but it's hard to get excited when Neo can just fly away, which is what he ends up doing. There's also a fight between Neo and a program named Seraph which is literally pointless, just a test. Seraph says you can ""never really know someone unless you fight them,"" which must make Seraph a riot at parties.

Bottom line, this would be a great movie if they had put the same effort into the story as ""The Matrix,"" instead of just coming up with cool scenes and linking them together. But if you just forget ""The Matrix"" and take it as a mindless action movie, it's a lot of fun.

Random Thoughts:
- Monica Bellucci is smoking hot as Persephone.
- The first movie ended with the implication that Neo could now do anything, ""change whatever he wanted"" as Morpheus said. In this movie, Neo is still restricted by the Matrix, just gifted with new and specific powers.
- The part where Neo says the Agents are upgraded so he can fight them is a ripoff. At the end of the last movie, Neo is so powerful that he doesn't need to fight anymore. How can the Agents just ""upgrade"" to that?
- I thought Zion was way too advanced and idyllic. In the first movie, Cypher complained about having to eat the same ""goop every day,"" and wanted to go back to the Matrix because the real world was so horrible. The implication is that the synthetic proteins were all they had to eat. In ""Matrix Reloaded,"" they have abundant fruits and vegetables and stuff.
- The infamous cave rave is still silly.
- I really didn't want to see Neo's bare butt
- Great cliffhanger",1480377600,,4437,4.535

1462801,3,B00005JLTN,"The second movie in the Matrix series, it is still one of the better Cyberpunk films to actually stick with the genre, although not as well compiled as the first, there are elements that make the movie suspenseful and great, but the movie is more action based than the previous one and disregards some of the elements of good storytelling.  If it was not the bridge between the first and third movies, I would suggest skipping it, unfortunately, some of the elements of the second movie are required to understand the third movie.  I am not a fan of Keanu Reeves, he seems to have the same affect in every movie he stars in, with the exception of the Bill and Ted movies.  If he had an actual change of expression once in a while that did not look like it was causing him physical pain, he would be a pretty decent actor.  Fortunately, the rest of the cast make up for this problem.  On the downside, because the Matrix series was a high point in most of the other actors careers, very few will most likely never have another starring / leading role in any other genre, which is unfortunate, as some of them have genuine talent.",1472601600,,1128,4.403846153846154

Imaginative fight scenes are often followed by pretty cheesy dialog heavy parts made worse by the extra stiff acting from the entire cast.
Even a wickedly eye-browed Anthony Zerbe as the Patriarchal leader is no help.
And what's with the overlong fleshy, brown, and beige, bacchanalian underground rave scene at the beginning?

1463136,2,B00005JLTN,"A disappointing follow-up to the highly-original seminal film, the Matrix Reloaded is aptly named.  The film reloads and recycles surface-level aesthetics and action from the first film - but fails to excite or inspire.  Generally, this is because these sequences lack any real risk or stakes - or the characters involved are underdeveloped.  The exception is an excellent set-piece chase scene, in which heroes we care about seem truly in over their heads.  Also, unlike in the first film, Neo is detached and unsympathetic.  He exhibits little vulnerability (emotional or otherwise) to complement and contrast his god-like powers - a static protagonist who risks little and grows little.  The film is ultimately undone by an unsatisfying ending - interesting from an intellectual point of view, but which severs our connection with the emotional journey of the characters.",1471824000,6,874,5.343065693430657

""This is the single greatest threat we have ever faced.""-Commander Lock of Zion.

Five FRENZIED Stars. ""The Matrix Reloaded"" is the breath-taking followup to the hit movie by the award-winning Wachowski siblings, ""The Matrix"". It contains much more background on the war between humans and the machines. It centers not only on Neo, Trinity, and Morpheus, but major players in Zion. Elsewhere, Agent Smith and others continue to be a problem. Meanwhile, the machines are searching for a place called Zion.

The movie contains visually-stunning, breathless wire-fu fight scenes that took kung-fu action scenes to another level within the action/adventure movie genre: like the wall-climbing evasion maneuvers, the amazing ""Burly Brawl"" courtyard fight between Neo versus the agents, the staircase fight, the car fight against the evil twins; Trinitys hair-raising motorcycle chase, and then Morpheus truck fight. Along the way, the real truth about the Matrix emerges. All of which sets the viewer up for the next and concluding movie in the trilogy, ""The Matrix Revolutions"". Starring Keanu Reeves, Carrie-Anne Moss, Laurence Fishburne, Hugo Weaving, Harry Lennix, Harold Perrineau, Jada Pinkett Smith, Anthony Zerbe, Robyn Nevin, Daniel Bernhardt, and many more.

The Machines are ruling it and the 'Architect' who is a , robot, a machine is contrwolling it. and trying to fix the imbalances or the equations of 'matrix'.

The only saving grace for these movies is Hugo Weaving giving an exemplary performance as he always does and Laurence Fishburne who is outstanding as Morpheus.  Other than that it is truly poorly written following a cookie cutter plot to next big (supposed) outstanding action scene (most of them really had you thinking why would they do that?  that is ridiculous)  But as I stated I am in the minority with my opinion and that is what it is an opinion.  I make no statement about people who like these movies; they have their opinion . . . I have mine, and they differ.  If you liked the first one, then watch this one.  If you like this one (or are intrigued by some aspect of it), then proceed to the third movie.  I kind of enjoyed the first movie, but I was not blown away by it like so many people I knew.

That the Wachow... brothers wrote something of this sort is an achievement the likes of which many will never grasp. True,maybe their was a bit too much CGI but the brothers who did this film understand that the viewing public has to be pandered to in one sense,as they slip in a pound of knowledge about those that control what the masses do and think on a everyday basis.

1464565,5,B00005JLTN,"Contrary to everything we know about trilogies, the sequel to the Matrix is considered to be the best of the three films. The reason is simple, as this is where we get into the heart of the story. The first film was equivalent to the pilot episode of a TV show, where we are introduced to the characters, terms, and locations. In the second installment of the Matrix we are introduced to the real struggle and get a look inside the legendary underground city of Zion. The humans there have learned of a plan by the machines to tunnel through into the city and want to come up with a way to stop them. While Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne) believes that Neo (Keanu Reeves) is the key to stopping the whole thing, most of the other are skeptical. In Reloaded, Agent Smith doesn't play as large a role as in the first film, for that matter, neither does the Matrix itself, which makes it almost like a stand alone rather than a sequel. Reloaded isn't just a great Sci-Fi story as it features one of the best action sequences and chase scenes I have ever seen, following the groups interaction with the Merovingian. While the film was great and does top the original, the Directors once again tried to use never before seen special effects. While it worked well in the first film, it doesn't help the second. Many of the fight scenes with the agents become so computerized, that at points they actually seem to be animated, and those scenes hurt the film. Other than that minor inconvenience, I can't find anything wrong with this film. It is Science Fiction at it's best, featuring an perfectly cast group of actors, some edge of your seat intensity, and of course a very unique story. All that makes the Matrix Reloaded one of our must see movies!",1403481600,,1743,4.536507936507936
1464566,4,B00005JLTN,"Knowing how important THE MATRIX was and is to the cinematic landscape, I wasn't sure what to expect with THE MATRIX RELOADED. I knew that the plot would thicken and that there would be more action, yet I also had a lingering suspicion that things would be totally different. I was correct on all accounts.

THE MATRIX RELOADED takes place shortly after THE MATRIX ended. The matrix, that complex world of imaginary programs stimulated to pacify the humans who are harvested by machines, isn't the same place it used to be. Neither is it what we originally imagined. And as the characters and viewers learn, the most important question isn't ""who"" or ""when"" or ""where"", but ""why"". Why has the matrix changed so much since Neo's appearance? Why is the Oracle so elusive? Why is Neo able to do what he is able to do? Why is it that not only the matrix, but the world of Zion seems so familiar? Why is it that everything in the world of the Matrix seems like a superspeed video game? Why, why, why?

Leaving those questions aside, THE MATRIX RELOADED is a brilliant piece of filmmaking. It is true that some of the plot elements and scenes seem eerily reminiscent of foreign films that only a handful of people have ever seen, but the movie also borrows from another great epic piece of cinema, STAR WARS. That is not a bad thing. It's a good thing--all stories are recyclable, the difference is in how the stories are told. The soundtrack is better than the original film and the special effects are astonishing; the freeway chase is enough the price of admission alone.

The film starts off at a fast pace that doesn't seem to make much sense. Later it makes sense, but even later what you thought was true and real turns out to not be the case. Which is what the movie and the whole franchise is really about anyway. What is reality? In THE MATRIX the question was what if everything you thought was real, was really a lie? The question doesn't change in THE MATRIX RELOADED. The ""reality"" that so many clung, turns out to be nothing more than another illusion in a world gone mad run by machines. The film ends with a suggestion that in the end, all will be revealed.

My only complaint about the film is that there is too much sexuality. There really isn't any nudity, but there is a scene of sexuality that is totally unnecessary to the plot. We already know that Neo and Trinity are lovers; it isn't necessary to show it. The scene totally detracts from the rest of the movie and should have not even been filmed.

If you see this film in theatres, be sure to stay through the credits. A 30-second trailer of MATRIX REVOLUTIONS is shown and reveals what looks to be one of the greatest mano y mano showdowns ever.",1402531200,,2717,4.480808080808081

1464568,1,B00005JLTN,"Maybe I'm crazy but did a different director make the first matrix or was the script really stolen as the rumor goes? The reason for saying this should be obvious. The first matrix compared with the pair reloaded/revolutions are basically so different that they are in different universes. The 2nd and 3rd movie is NOTHING like the brilliance of the first. Not to mention the cgi is horrible and ruins the whole look of the series that the first movie established. I remember being so excited to see this is theaters and I couldn't believe what I was seeing on screen. Terrible plot, beyond awkward scenes with weird dialogue. Bad bad stuff. At least this is better than the 3rd one. I seriously think the script of the original was stolen unless that's already been proven. Can't really say I care anymore.

the matrix is not just a movie, this has become a cult and rightfully so. there are talks and production for 2 new movies due out in the next few years.
for those who want a better understanding, take a look at the Matrix animations- for those wanting indepth look at the matrix revisited.

With newly raised shipping charges on used copies bringing up their  price and Amazon having a particularly low price (with Prime shipping) its a bargain. And... there is no sense buying Reloaded, if you haven't seen the first in the series, since this is a continuation without giving you any information to put you in the picture on what is happening. Not that one really needs to know very much, since  the  continuity filled with meaningless  gobbledygook doesn't make much sense in any of the pictures.  Don't get me wrong, you are not watching this film for its plot. At least, not if you want to enjoy it. What you should be looking forward to, and what you get in full measure, is a ballet, in some number of movements, which might be called, Dances of Death. This is only to say, that you get dazzling displays of movement as multiple figures, leap, dodge, parry, are hit and hit, in multifarious ways. The underlying plot, aside from some talk about The One and other non-sense making sentences, is that a society of machines (including robots) is out to destroy a society of humans and only the characters played by the leads and main supporting players can stop them.  It is fun to see the cast of good and bad guys cavort in rapid fire motion; it drags a bit when we get the talk, and this film, at any rate, goes on a bit too long.

Keanu Reeves returns as Neo, but in a far more better performance than the first one. Laurence Fishburne is excellent as Morpheus, in a much well made peformance that was as good as the first one but just a little bit better. Carrie-Anne Moss is great as Trinity, with a little more style to her performance than the first one. Hugo Weaving is brilliant as Agent Smith, the ruthless agent bend on stopping Neo's crusades.

1464767,5,B00005JLTN,"Just watched it again on Amazon Instant after watching the first. Ignore the critics. This is far far far better than the first Matrix. Although the first Matrix can be very inspirational to me at a personal level, it still must be recognized that much of what it does is pop-philosophy -- nothing more. The shining achievement of the Matrix is not any philosophical depth. No. The achievement was twofold: 1) Giving a ""justification"" for people flying through the air and dodging bullets in the same manner that, say, Spiderman's origin story makes his wall climbing ""justifiable,"" -- and in the process of giving a comic-book-like explanation for the action, it makes the action exciting and watchable and 2) setting up an awesome fantasy world beyond this one where this world is the fantasy -- that's just awesome in and of itself.

And when you understand that those are the reasons why the Matrix is great, then Matrix Reloaded comes off as even better -- much better, in fact. Because, now that the first movie (which left off in a to-be-continued-style-ending, anyway) has set up the characters, you can have fun watching them go into the matrix and do crazy things -- all of which have implications for the real world (a world that is also simultaneously developed in this movie). This causes story and action to mix and excitement to increase. And then the ending leaves you with a sense of... well no, I won't give that a way -- but the ending gives me emotions that no other movie has.

Setting aside the last couple of paragraphs entirely, all you really need to know is that the first Matrix is like A New Hope, the second like Empire Strikes Back, and the third like Return of the Jedi. And as Empire Strikes Back is the definitive Star Wars movie (a movie where the story is also told very visually with Han and Leia attempting to evade the Empire, etc), so Reloaded is the definitive Matrix movie. This movie has a feeling beyond the plot and characters and dialogue and action -- it conveys an overall emotion that is difficult to convey (similar also to Empire Strikes Back), but that is worth enjoying, if you're not too snobbish to get a kick out of the tremendous amounts of action packed into this movie. It's brilliant, and it does the comic book setup of the first movie justice by showing us more of the actions-in-the-matrix impacting the ""real world,"" theme that was just starting to be hinted at in the first movie.

The action in Reloaded is awesome, and the fight scenes get pretty intense. It just amounts to a lot of running around, with less drama and substance. I guess to accomplish some epic you do have to run around a lot. Neo couldn't save the world if he sat around all the time. So he runs around a lot, and this movie is where he does it.

PLOT:

The story they came up with is the perfect continuation of ""The Matrix.""  It explores the world introduced in the first movie, while adding new twists.  Neo, having come to terms with his role as The One and formed a relationship with Trinity, is now working towards figuring out how he must save the human race, and whether his relationship with Trinity can survive this.  We learn more about the Oracle, and the world of the machines and their programs in the Matrix; they have their own society, filled with individuals with personal motives, some of whom want to help the humans and others who are just self-serving.  We finally see Zion, and how the freed humans live.  All of these things are woven together in a story of Neo racing to figure out his role in the Prophecy, as the Machines drill closer and closer to Zion.

The downsides of the story are pointless sex scenes (like the notorious ""orgy scene,"" and the ""cake rape"") and drawn-out philosophical babblings about ""purpose"" and ""choice.""

CHARACTERS:

One of the strongest points of this movie. The villain, Smith, is brought back in a way that's clever and believable (for this series anyway).  New characters are as good or better than ones form the first movie.  We get to meet other humans in the resistance, as well as other Programs who are not in league with the Machines.  Many fill roles of characters who died in the first movie, but are still fresh and new at the same time (Link is the new wisecracking operative to replace Tank; Niobe is the new secondary-female-fighter-with-cool-hair, to replace Switch; Smith-controlled-Bane is the new double-agent to replace Cypher; etc.)  The Merovingian and his wife Persephone are two fun antiheroes with ambiguous agendas.  We also meet the Architect, and although a lot of his dialogue is confusing and pointless, he's one of the most iconic characters in the series.  The only character I disliked was Kid, who was obviously supposed to replace Mouse as the cute nave youngster, but instead was annoying, and anything but ""cute.""

ACTION SCENES:

Fun and cleverly choreographed, but too drawn out.  The opening scene is classic, starting in a way that pays homage to the first movie, with Trinity coming in and kicking ass.

VISUALS:

This is both one of the best and worst things about this sequel.

The CGI is god-awful.  When Neo fights multiple Smiths in one scene, it literally looks like a video game.  The movie also has some dreadful uses of green-screen.  Most of the sex scenes are gross and idiotic, rather than romantic or sexy.  There is one romantic love scene between Neo and Trinity, but it is interrupted by scenes of a bizarre orgy that the rest of the humans are engaged in; later, we see in great detail the effects of eating orgasmic cake.

The scenery and stylish looks of the characters compensates.  If you liked seeing the different Matrix outfits and hairstyles of Morpheus's crew in the first movie, then you'll love the Crisis Meeting scene in ""Reloaded,"" were we see multiple crews of humans in the Matrix, as well as all of the sharply-dressed programs Neo and friends meet throughout the movie.  The shots of the underground city Zion are very cool looking, and in the Matrix, characters are lead through a maze of strange rooms and locations.

MUSIC:

A +.  I own the soundtrack, and it's one of my favorite things to listen to.  If you like techno or ""cyberpunk""-like music, you should love it.

DIALOGUE/ACTING:

Not fantastic, but not horrible. The dialogue, like the action scenes, gets far too drawn out and pointless at times. But there are also some great lines as well. (""Trinity, we're talking less than five minutes."" ""In five minutes I'll tear that whole goddamn building apart."")

1464878,3,B00005JLTN,"A sequel that ups the philosophy and the action while also upping the potholes and general ridiculousness, Reloaded can be enjoyed two ways:

The first is to just immerse yourself in the gun fights and kung fu as a mindless popcorn flick. The problem with this is for some of the scenes, the CG effects have not aged well. In these instances you are taken out of the film and feel like your watching a video game.

The second is to listen the the over abundance of philosophy regarding, primarily, probability and fate. The problem here is these ideas are a bit deeper then the movie is willing to go into, so instead it makes the characters talk fast so the audience has to work just to keep up with the dialogue.

This is not to say Reloaded is a bad movie. In fact, there are a few scenes that work exceptionally well for both sides, in particular the weapons fight scene at Merovingian's club (which still looks good) and, without spoiling too much, the conversation Neo has in the TV room (a wonderful visual metaphor).

The two weakest aspects of the film are undoubtedly the beginning and the end. The Zion rave is ridiculous and silly, as is the ending discovered power(s). Still, reloaded isn't terrible. It actually stands up remarkably well and is defiantly worth a watch. Just don't expect the first Matrix.

1464881,3,B00005JLTN,"The Matrix Reloaded isn't a bad film. It's a very watchable, fun film. But the real disappointment is that there was the potential for it to be as fabulous as the first Matrix. It's a squandered opportunity. Sometimes when someone writes a novel that becomes a smash hit, the next isn't edited properly, because the publishing company are eager to keep their cash cow happy. That feels very much what happened here. It feels like nobody kept an eye on what the Wachowskis were doing, nobody tried to keep them focused, nobody steered them towards the story rather than the whizz-bang. And it's a crying shame, because the ideas they had for these films are completely brilliant.

The core of the second movie is the discovery that the entire premise of the first was a lie. The Prophecy is just another layer of control. The machines created Zion, selected the One, and set him up to start the cycle, just to keep people pacified; the naturally rebellious would have an outlet for their energies that could never threaten the status quo at all. Zion and the human resistance are no more nor less than a machine-created pressure valve for the Matrix itself. That idea is brilliantly clever; breathtakingly so. If the movie had been made with that at its heart, with everything else there just to serve the story, you'd have a movie that excelled the first, and could stand alone. But that wasn't what happened. And the failure of that story means that the last movie failed too, because its own story was equally muddled and equally squandered, and that compounded the problems. If the first movie had stuck to its story, and the second had lucidly set out that the machines are just as much sinned against as sinning, and can co-exist with humanity if only the hawks on both sides will allow them to do so, you'd have a brilliant series. But that isn't what happened, and saying ""people didn't get the movies"" just isn't good enough. It isn't a lack of intelligence that caused that problem. It's a lack of coherent, skilled story-telling. The first film was beautifully made and tight, taut narrative drove the plot. The second and third were muddled and self-indulgent, despite fantastic ideas and stunning set-pieces.

The first Matrix movie had budgetary constraints that meant all the action had to be justified by the plot. Here, the action is as out there as they can possibly make it. There's no sense of it being purely to further the story; it's an end in itself. The famous ""burly brawl"" (Neo v hundreds of Smiths) looks fake a lot of the time and goes on too long, and the real shame of it is that half the length and a lot less CGI and it could have worked. The point of that scene is that there is someone new in the mix whose power threatens even Neo, but that gets very lost. Similarly, the freeway chase scene is amazing, but too long. It dislocates the movie and makes the real heart of it - the final mission - feel squashed and an oversight. The focus on set pieces such as these makes for a choppy, episodic feel, and it's a real shame, especially as when they work the fight scenes are extraordinary - the Chateau scene is balletic in gracefulness and looked breathtaking on the big screen, and Neo's brief initial fight with agents sent the adrenaline in the cinema rocketing. But the sloppy editing and pacing of the movie really doesn't do it any favours.

Similarly, there are too many scenes that simply don't need to be there. The conflict between Morpheus and the Zion military command is dull, dull, dull. I can't imagine anyone cares. Link is a brand new character, and while the actor is light-years better than the appallingly hammy one who played Tank in M1, I can't imagine anyone investing in his marital problems after a two scene acquaintance. Most of the Zion scenes are redundant, though I'm possibly in an Anglo-Saxon minority in not thinking the sex scene is one. I don't see what the issue is in showing characters supposedly madly in love having sex, especially given the weight the movies place on that relationship later. The scene was framed to make it about intimacy and profound connection rather than explicit nudity - as you'd expect from the directors of Bound -  though the Zion rave scenes it was cut with were a trifle annoying, looking as they did like an X rated Pepsi commercial.

Another problem is the wordiness and the heavily sign-posted symbolism. A good script shouldn't need to beat you over the head, yet here a lot of ink is spilt saying very little. The restaurant scene with the Merovingian is brilliant - well written and wonderfully performed - but as the character really hasn't been given enough to do, it's also redundant. This is especially unfortunate when the Merovingian says, with complete accuracy, that Neo is just doing what he's told and has no idea what his role really is. That salient observation is lost in all the waffle. This is a problem throughout; something may look good, it may sound good, but if it doesn't matter to the plot, it needs to go. The Architect scene is one that really does need to be there, and the for once the wordiness worked for me. It highlighted the difference between human and machine really well. But that was an exception. The constant talk of Purpose and Causality and Choice and Meaning is the paradigm of telling rather than showing, and if that's problematic in a book, it's a disaster in a film; particularly one so reliant on special effects. The effects and the wordiness and the heavy symbolism compete and counter one another, cancelling one another out and overloading the movie. Oddly enough in a film that prides itself on taxing audience intelligence, the philosophical and religious symbolism is laid on with a trowel at best, and beaten into your head with a baseball bat at worst. Those themes would be a lot more interesting if they were more subtly woven and didn't get in the way of the story. Exposition that detracts from the actual plot might be interesting in an art house film, but in this one it just doesn't do anything but diminish returns.

There's another big issue with a movie that throws so many words and so many explosions and fights into the mix: suspension of disbelief. When Neo stops sentinels with his mind, you need to be engaged enough with the plot to care. He can do this because he's been to the Source - the machine main frame - and presumably has enough of the machine code in his cranial hardware to do so, but it seems so out of left-field that you just think - huh?! The brilliance of the first film was the immediacy and plausibility of it. How *do* we know what is real? How can we be certain that life is as it seems? And the hyper-reality of the fighting freed and the Agents worked well juxtaposed to the broad mass of the rest of us. But in the sequels, there is no broad mass. We see programmes who are as stylised and skilled as the rebels, and you lose sight of the link to reality. Zion is a movie fantasy, too. I can't help suspecting that by losing the real world as we know it when portraying the Matrix, you lose some of the urgency. You also lose a connection to the audience. There's far less to identify with - to make this war and this battle feel relevant to audience lives. It's harder to care about the characters. This dislocation increases as the sequels progress and I found the eventual deaths - even of Neo and Trinity, characters I'd loved - muted and less than tragic. I think that is a pretty telling indictment.

The acting is mixed. I did feel Fishbourne phoned it in, to an extent. He obviously loved the character and that made him, for my money, a little self-indulgent. He sounds wonderful and looks fabulous, but there isn't the charisma and warmth he had in spades in the first film. Carrie Anne Moss is a fantastic actress, completely different in every movie I've seen her in and very convincing in all, but the oddity for me was that she was a different character in this movie to the Trinity in the first. You could argue that the character is now in love, but she still seems a completely different character, even in scenes where she isn't speaking. It doesn't matter hugely as both are likeable and engagingly intelligent portrayals, but if you watch the films together, it's noticeable, and I do wonder if the actress didn't just find a new portrayal after the break instead of rediscovering the old. In a sense it's a compliment to her that there is so little of her own personality in her acting - someone essentially playing themselves wouldn't have the problem. I also found her fight scenes rather less impressive in the sequels, to the point I wondered if the actress had been injured? She did far better in the car/bike chase elements. I thought Keanu Reeves was great as Neo; the change here is every bit as enormous but makes far more sense in terms of the plot. A lonely computer geek is now pretty much God with a wicked-hot girlfriend, so you'd expect him to be a tad more assured. People say Reeves is a terrible actor, but actually I disagree. I've seen him interviewed and was amazed to find he was very bright - and then realised that I'd thought he was Ted. Most of the world thought he was Ted. Now most people think he's Neo. Given the gulf between those characters, that's quite some achievement. He has a stillness and an innocence - a goodness, really - that worked really well here and he looks amazing in the fight scenes. I don't think he has huge range as an actor, but in his own parameters I think he's fantastic and the role suits him brilliantly. I also loved the actor who played the Merovingian; the Keymaker is also excellent; the Architect was genuinely chilling; and Hugo Weaving seems temperamentally incapable of ever turning in anything but a superb performance, no matter what he does. Jon Voight was also good in a cameo role (though it would have served the film better if his cameo had been single scene - only Star Trek fans could have enjoyed the Zion Council scenes).

The real failure of this film is that between the endless talking and the endless fighting you end up feeling like hardly anything important happened - that it's light on plot. And nothing, actually, could be further from the truth. A film with a brilliantly clever plot, some wonderful characters, and some fabulous action scenes ended up being a bit of a confusingly episodic mess. A hugely enjoyable, fun, action-packed mess, but a mess just the same. The action and speech disguised rather than revealed the plot, and it's such a shame. This movie is a real lost opportunity. I'd buy it anyway, expecially in Blu Ray and especially if I had a very large screen! But I can't help feeling sad that they didn't have someone from Warner keeping their eye on the ball.

1464900,4,B00005JLTN,"A sequel was inevitable after the (partial) cliffhanger ending of the 1999 blockbuster ""The Matrix"".

The second-part in the the Wachowski brothers groundbreaking vision, ""Reloaded"" makes sure it has the signature fight-scenes from the first Matrix and then some.

The first part of the film starts out just a bit too fast, lacking a bit of info that could have come across more clearly. After a short amount of time it becomes apparent that many months have past since the first Matrix film, and Neo has fully developed into a savior figure for the 'resistance', the people of Zion.

As the story shifts to allow for the entrance of new characters to the story, a feeling of the magnitude of the entire human/machine battle comes to light. The people of Zion are just waiting out until their impending doom and all of their hopes lay squarely on the shoulders of Neo, the savior that they believe will end the war.

Therein lies the main strength of ""Reloaded"". The new characters to the story bring a certain human aspect, not as much present in the first installment. When the cool, stylized, slo-mo style is not present, there is a certain sense that these people are only human, preparing to fight a force far beyond them.

The film spends a large amount of time on the now apparent villain, the Morovingian. A french speaking computer-program who spends his time messing with people in his high-class restaurant with his rejected wife Persephone.

And there, lies the movies biggest problem. ""Reloaded"" is highly publicized as a two-part deal, to get the entire thing, the second part (or third, whatever you want to call it) ""Revolutions"" must be seen. Why is this a problem? Because the film itself is aware that no matter how many times the characters say ""it ends tonight"" the audience knows it isn't actually going to end until the next movie. There is a rather large lack of drama to the 'climax', mostly because of the focus on the Morovingian, and not on the machines. Now this would be fine if it weren't for the scripts unwavering insistence on pretending there's a climax when there doesn't need to be one.

Reloaded does regain it's bearings toward the end though, although somewhat depressing it ends with a key revelation to the story and ends with enough left open for the third-installment to be a must-see.

1464935,5,B00005JLTN,"I know of friends who only saw the first Matrix movie and that is a shame, as all three parts of the trilogy belong together as the journey of Neo and the change that happens to him along the way. It is a fantastic job that has been done in keeping the quality at the top without descending into making B-grade follow up movies as is often the case with sequels.

It is a movie that can be seen on many levels. Some will see it just as a great action movie which it is, but there is so much more to this film. It is a fantastic depiction of the journey of the spiritual seeker and the difficulties that he encounters within himself as he starts pushing against the prisons of his own mind and the multitude of programs that operates and which keep us small.

It also neatly depicts the way humans are kept as 'food for the moon' in Gurdjieff's words or simply food for ultra terrestrials. In the film this is depicted as humans, being little less than cultivated biological batteries for the machines.

The story is part of a trilogy and all three parts are worth watching more than once, as you will undoubtedly see new things each time. Things that start making sense only after some time of reflection and reading. In this regard I can recommend reading the book by Ouspensky called ""In Search of the Miraculous"", and the book by Laura Knight-Jadczyk called ""The Secret History of the World"".",1195344000,4,1395,4.42023346303502

1464937,3,B00005JLTN,"Expectations for many were very higher after they saw the first Matrix film.  I was one of these sheep that was lead to the slaughter.  Matrix 2 cannot be Matrix 1.  What was new in fresh in the first film must inevitable become overblown in the second film.  The film couldn't meet people's expectation, and many criticize the Matrix sequels.  I almost didn't even bother seeing the last film, but after Revolutions redeemed the series and I realized that I didn't give the sequels a proper chance.

The Matrix was an incredible film.  The style and flow of the first movie was amazing.  The story seems fresh in the way it was told, even though it is a science-fiction staple.  Reality and human nature were explored in pop philosophy that even found its way to academia.  Bullet time seemed so original and amazing a concept that just about everyone that saw the movie agreed that it was revolutionary.

In the Matrix Reloaded, the story had to expand from its beginnings.  Now, the viewer is taken to Zion and the real world.  Not that the Matrix itself wasn't important but now our attention is also on this post apocalyptic society.  I don't think anyone I know was impressed with the design of Zion or the people.  The movie fails on a basic level because I think most viewers don't connect at all to Zion.  We know and have strong connections to Morpheous, Neo and Trinity, but these new ideas and characters don't make as big an impact.  Just about ever scene in Zion is ill-conceived.  The council scenes, Morpheous's speech, the rave, etc. are not really all that interesting.  The bigger cast means there is even more chance to have some mediocre actors in the movie and bad dialogue.  Zion fails not only because of design but also these dismal scenes, most of which are not key to the plot but rather, suck up screen time.  In a perfect world, these movies could be re-written and shot and this movie would be much, much better.

Then, you have the person formerly known as Agent Smith, now just Smith and also Bane.  This expansion of his role worked well.  Smith is a great villain and his ability to replicate himself like a virus adds some menace to his character.  Unfortunately, this ability allows for the battle sequences with Neo vs. hundreds of Smiths.  A shorter fight sequence probably would have worked better and been more impressive but it looks like a video game and just puts a drag in the story.

The introduction of non-agent programs in the matrix as sentient beings was a good addition, even better utilized in the last film.  The expansion of the matrix works much better than the inclusion of the real world.  The other agents, particularly the ghostly twins are pretty cool.  The battle sequences that rely more on bullet time, than video game graphics are still pretty good.  The use of melee weapons is pretty good.

The most redeeming and worthwhile part of the film is of course the highway chase.  Great effects and huge suspense.  It is beautiful if chaos/ action sequences can be called such.

The scene with the Architect is slightly confusing.  After a second viewing it makes more sense though.  It does tie everything, Matrix, Zion and the rest of the world in perspective.  I did like the scene in general, but like all the films the dialogue could use some touching up.

Most action movies don't win acting awards or script awards, and you don't expect anything amazing from these sort of films.  But there is a level of what is acceptable and what is really bad, and actually all the Matrix films walk a fine line between the two.

The philosophical aspects of the series are not as profound or evident in this particular movie.  This movie out of all three seems the most pretentious and hits a kind of hollow note.  That's why this movie alone is not that amazing.  As part of the whole story it comes out looking much better.  The story set up in Matrix Reloaded is followed up very well in Revolutions, and IMO the series has a strong finish.",1185926400,,3998,4.600566572237961

1464939,2,B00005JLTN,"There are a couple spoilers in this review, but none give away the ending.
If we were to cut all the filler out of The Matrix: Reloaded, we'd be left with a ten-minute movie. On the other hand, if we were to cut all the filler out of The Matrix, we'd be left with a 136 minute movie. Scenes in The Matrix: Reloaded are either unnecessary but cool fight scenes, necessary but boring dialog scenes, an unnecessary, endless AND boring chase scene; an unnecessary and nearly unwatchable sex scene, or (just occasionally) necessary and cool dialog scenes.
First, the good. The special effects are excellent, as you'd expect. The fight scenes are mostly good: the rooftop battle between Morpheus and an agent (the sole highlight of the chase scene) and Neo's duel with the French guy (or the Merovingian - I'll just call him the French guy from now on)'s minions of doom are great, and the multiplying Agent Smith/Neo fighting with a ten-foot pole scene is decent, though overlong, indulgent, and stupid (that many Agents would have killed anybody else, but Neo is ""The One"", so of course he survives). The ghost-people that the French guy enlists also are interesting, but only in that they can do that phasing thing - otherwise, they're stock characters. The Oracle's still charming as ever, and the conversation between Neo and the Architect is good by this movie's standards.
Now for the bad. Other than the Architect, none of the new characters are at all interesting: the kid who idolizes Neo is annoying; the French guy is pompous, self-centered, and impossible to hear (He's soft-spoken and talks in a heavy accent); his wife is just a cold-hearted killer; Seraph (the Oracle's bodyguard) is totally useless; and the Keymaker just runs, hides, and randomly drops down dead. I guess Niobe is all right, but she doesn't have half the personality that other female characters Trinity , The Oracle and Switch had.
I say ""had"" there for two reasons; Switch obviously died, and Trinity is no longer an intriguing character either. In the first movie, she was, but all she seems concerned about now is screwing Neo. Speaking of Neo, his transformation into a Christ-like figure has robbed him of any personality - he does way too much of that ""Superman s#@!"" (including a self-indulgent flight scene ""borrowed"" from the Superman movies - taking a few cues from your dad, eh Keanu?), and simply doesn't seem like a person anymore. Morpheus has also suffered, mutating into a faceless revolutionary. He does a lot of wild-eyed, inconsequential shouting. Not much else. The dialog, too, is painfully bad.
So there you have it. A triumph of style over substance. A lot of slow-mo kicks (they could at least speed time up, just for variety's sake), explosions, techno music and Neo's Messianic posturing. Not much of a plot, though, and not much of a movie. Stick to the first - it's bound to become a classic. The Matrix: Reloaded is not.",1184025600,,2929,4.825049701789265
1464940,4,B00005JLTN,"The Matrix Reloaded has one thing that simply stands out throughout the movie - complete eye candy.  Its true, while the first Matrix brought about new origins in movie animation and cgi, Matrix Reloaded takes it x100.  The action is amazing, it will blow you away almost to the point that you've had enough.  Major action and visual effects fans will dig this.  True harcorde fans of the Matrix story might be dissapointed.

The story almost takes a backseat to the action.  The plot is dragged out throughout huge action scenes that seem to never end -  example-  Neo vs dozens of Smiths lasting forever, and the highway chase that lasts as long as I-95 runs.  While these scenes are truly spectacular, they take away from the story somewhat.  Gone is the great in depth exploration into the Matrix.  Very little is newly introduced to us about the Matrix, and the story now focuses on Neo and the rest of humanity saving itself from destruction, both from the machines in the real world, and Smith in the Matrix world.  We do get to meet the architect of the Matrix, though not as astounding as one would think.

Overall this is not as good as the first one, but you'll still want to see it to see how the trilogy continues.  If you love never-ending action and cgi, you will want to watch this over and over and over.  The movie is worth buying on that regard.  As for a compeleing story, you might be ok stopping after the first Matrix and being satisfied.

By the second movie, THE MATRIX RELOADED, the filmmakers got caught up in their own pretentious premise.  The dialogue just plays flat and weird.  Keanu Reeves looks either deep or...blank.  Couldn't tell which most of the time.  The truly-odd ""Rave Scene"" was so primitive and even bestial that I wondered why humans needed to survive at all.  Maybe the machines were on to something to exterminate such rampant barbarism and partying.

The action scenes were very cool and the special effects extremely interesting.  I'm sure the filmmakers turned to talented effects people to shoot those scenes.

If only they had turned to talented sci-fi writers to flesh out their script.

1464962,1,B00005JLTN,"""Reloaded"" turns out to be a whopping disappointment. I caught the midnight preview of this movie and was expecting a satisfying sequel building from the strengths of the first Matrix film, which was an instant sci-fi/action classic. Instead, we were treated to a terribly botched effort. Apparently, the first film was a fluke for the Wachowskis, whose writing and character building skills simply evaporated after the smash success of the first film. Alongside the likewise awful ""Matrix: Revolutions"", the once promising team proceeded to demolish the legacy of what could have been the next ""Star Wars Trilogy"". Hence, a potential all-time classic series of Matrix films was not to be. What went wrong?

Plenty.

For starters, the original characters were not refreshed or developed adequately. We fully expect to see Neo's awesome powers on full display, and here the Wachowskis do not disappoint. However, the Neo character remains virtually the same, his realization that the Oracle's prediction was correct and that he truly is ""The One"" failed to boost his confidence or convince him to truly lead his comrades towards victory against the machines ( Imagine Luke Skywalker in ""Return Of The Jedi"" still behaving like a whining farm boy). Instead, Neo takes a back seat to Morpheus again. The relationship between Neo and Trinity is still flat, I sensed no on-screen chemistry between the two at any time.

The supporting cast have a small degree of development, but it is too little, too late as the movie plods along between killer (if not clich) action sequences. Central character Agent Smith is altered into a more powerful ""Smith"", OK. This classic villain has been ruined by an awful script long on existential rhetoric but short on captivation. The CGI ""Squidies"" are badly overdone here as well as in ""Revolutions"". We expect to see more sophisticated and diverse machines introduced, especially in a world of machines such as this. Instead, the squidies are the only muscle the machine empire can produce to combat the Zionites. The program-run-amok characters such as the Merovingian are silly and lame.

This movie was a financial blockbuster due mainly to the action sequences, which were superb despite the overdone CGI effects. It's a shame that the excellent storyline introduced in the first movie was thoroughly trashed beginning with this sequel and continuing into the third and (thankfully) final installment.",1175990400,8,2438,5.195928753180661

1464964,4,B00005JLTN,"First off, I will say that I enjoyed these movies as great entertainment.

I realize that for some people, these movies are vehicles for philosophy for you.  We each have different vehicles that work for us to learn the truths of life, so I am trying not to be too arrogant in my comments, but I am just flabbergasted that so many people follow the text and slightest nuance (intended or not) as if it were holy writ.

It really scares me that our culture has become so sanitized and bland, that people are looking to movies like this for meaning.  Sure, there is a little there, but it is smashed in with new-age mumbo and eye-candy.  You want to learn of life and truth?  Read Ghandi, read the words and thoughts of truly great men.  Or really take the plunge into profound searchings for the truth and meaning and read Christ, Buddha, or Mohammed.

You want things in movie form?  Watch Ghandi, the killing fields, Hotel Rwanda, or Schindler's list, etc.

But it you really want to learn philosophy, the kind that really matters, go seek out those who suffer more than you can possibly imagine, look in their eyes and hear their stories.  Keep your heart open and let them touch you.  Cry with them.  It is amazing how fully life begins to change.

1464967,4,B00005JLTN,"We know what the matrix is, altogether, since qe have seen the first episode. We know that machines have taken over the world and have decided to control all human life. Humans are slaves serving machines. Nothing very new. In this second episode we enter the final phase of this machine-controlled world : the eradication of human life, and first of all of Zion, the city that is a concentrated vision of human and urban life. The human race is trying to get organized to resist this final apocalypse, but human beings cannot much without machines and their machines are not that good when compared with the machines of the other realm. Yet some human beings, a small team of them are following a prophecy and have the capacity to navigate mentally but in a pseudophysical state from their back world into Zion and the human world. When they thus navigate between layers of material life they leave their heavy and hard bodies behind and enter new bodies that have tremendous powers. It is these powers they need to defeat meachines. This second episode of the saga is interesting because it enables us to meet with the mathematician who has constructed the whole matrix. First he is human and no explanation will be given about how he can survive in the realm of machines, and how he can expand his life into some timeless eternity. Second he announces that he programed everything, including the prophecy that is then a lie, and that Zion and its destruction is necessary to keep the balance of this matrix and that the final destruction that is announced will be the sixth destruction. We note that there is no explanation about this number six, about why and how Zion can survive every destruction. The most surprising is of course the number six, the number of Solomon that has nothing to do with the end of the world. Yet Zion leads us to the bible and the main prophecy we can think of  is the Book of Revelation. But then the number of this apocalypse is not six but seven. In other words we are not in any kind of a meaningful allusion to the bible. The film is only using these allusions to create an atmosphere of secrecy, of spirituality that helps making the film a lot less pure action. It gives some inspiration to what would otherwise be nothing but brutal movement. Third this film transforms battles, fights and action into some kind of 3-dimensional ballets that can be very pretty at times. These ballets can be set in any place whatsoever : in an open square, in the hall of a Renaissance mansion, or on the roof of a truck on a highway. The general impression is that one or two heroes are fighting against a neverending and constantly reinforced army of cloned individuals than can become hundreds in one instant and multiply to thousands in less than ten seconds. Just the time it takes to open a door and to bring them out. And yet these ballets have some beauty even if it is a little bit repetitive hence slightly long. But what can the meaning of this film be ? We will probably come to the final meaning in the third episode. But here we do have a very negative vision of a mechanized world in which human beings are becoming completely dispossessed of their life and of their future. The human race is also tremendously reduced in vision and even the will to really fight for their survival seems to have been tremendously reduced. The future of the world, when it is menaced with utter destruction, lies in the hands of half a dozen people at the most. That does not make a crowd, does it ? Then there emerges from the film a tremendous sense of fatality. Is there any hope ? If we believe the two or three who say yes, but if we look at the real and hard facts given in the film, no, absolutely no. And this fatalistic vision is emphasized of course by the nearly black and white pictures that eare in a way filmed in all the possible shades of grey.

Good sequels are hard to find, and the original MATRIX was so impressively mind-blowing in its originality that I would have been hard-pressed to come up with this story line.

The first time I watched RELOADED, I walked away unimpressed. But watching RELOADED in sequence, it makes much for sense.

A few personal observations...

1. The multi-Smith fight. This fight felt WAAAY over the top. I'm a martial artist, so I know what I'm watching for in a full-speed fight. This fight had so much going on that even I had trouble paying attention by the end of the fight...not sure how non-martial artists watched this.

2. Zion. Apparently there are older people in Zion (on the council, at least), but they don't appear to come to the big party in the temple. Kinda weird, that.

3. Highway chase scene. Okay, that was just nuts. Went on far too long.

4. Evil ghost twins. Started to feel like I was watching STAR WARS I all over again. Build build-up on the evil, Darth-Maul-ish characters ... very little actual screen time. These were fun bad guys in a freaky way ... couldv'e done a lot more with them.

1465008,3,B00005JLTN,"At first I was impressed by 'The Matrix Reloaded', by the sheer visual quality, but the story left much to be desired, as in the story felt quite weak compared to the first. This movie felt more as a showcase for special effects than a worthy sequel, way too 2-dimensional in retrospect, not enough character development.  The new characters introduced adding nothing worthwhile, such as Niobe, Link, Ice, Ballard, Seraph, Persephone, and Merovingian.  After the movie, how much do we know about each character?  Next to nothing, so it doesn't really further the plot line that much, hence they are little more than window dressing.  The Wachowski brothers became overly ambitious with this project and simply tried to do too much with too little time.  In the original there were a few characters but at least there was enough time devoted to fleshing out their personas so we grew to know and care about them, whereas in this sequel the characters that we enjoyed from the first one they take a backseat to new, inconsequential and pointless characters that have as much depth as cardboard cutouts.

Several plot elements seemed superfluous, like Persephone and the Marovingian.  Along with Seraph, it became obvious that these characters were simply added to increase the amount of mythological, religious and philosophical references, and once enough of them were added the idea seemed to be that a story would develop as a result.  Unfortunately the only thing it all added up to was an incohesive, sporadic storyline interweaved with several superb action sequences, but that does not make a classic like the first one.

Its predecessor 'The Matrix' is a classic because it combined a variety of influences from anime, movies, comics, philosophy and religion and created its own mythology while the sequel attempted to throw in way too many historical references and thereby hoping to make the story even more fantastic, but it simply ended up diluting the greatness of the original film.  'Reloaded' was too busy with too many themes with the thought that more is better, but as the first film proved less is more within the context.

The difference between the original and this sequel is that the first one made its money and cult following based on word of mouth, because of the quality of the elements involved. This sequel on the other hand has made far more money, but that is based on an even bigger budget and massive ad-campaigns that put recent Star Wars film ads to shame, and hype rather than substance.

'The Matrix Reloaded' is not a bad film, although it's not great either. I did enjoy it, but it's just not up to par with the first.  The Wachowski brothers would have been better off with their artistic integrity intact had they just stuck with the original and never made any sequels.  Few people know that the sequels were only made based on the tremendous success of the first film, there was never a whole trilogy planned.  The studios as well as the Wachowskis saw the opportunity to milk the cash cow, and it shows.

This film works as a good action film, but it pales in comparison to the philosophy and handling of the religious subtext seen in the original 'Matrix'.",1142640000,4,3200,4.822669104204754

But seriously, I could sit here and type up all the reasons that this movie is so great, but you've probably seen it on TNT 6 times.  Listen.  It doesn't matter if special effects ever surpass the ones in this film because no movie will ever couple it with such a deep story line.  And visa versa.

One thread that runs through each Matrix flick is the love between Neo and Trinity.  They sold me on their affection for one another through all they'd been through when each time they were going to supposedly die, they were there for one another, even when Trinity did actually die in front of Neo.  THAT SUCKED!  But that was the third movie anyway.

What really enhanced this movie was how confident Neo had become with his skills and not get arrogant.  How un-American of him!  But this is a good thing.  When's the last time you had a hero that wasn't a pothead with his buds or a drunk or a thug with no morals?  Neo is a guy all people can relate to, not just certain stereotypes.

Like the original, though, it is boring for the most part, and features a lot more of quasi-religious babble that seriously detracted from the original. On the plus-side though, there is a lot more action in this one, including a spectacular car-chase-crash sequence.

The acting hasn't improved either. Laurence Fishburne does the best job as Morpheus. The rest of the cast does just alright, although Monica Bellucci (""The Passion of the Christ"") does good in her interesting little scene as Persephone.

This is a form of affirmative action that sickens me. See Ayo's _How to Rent a Negro_ for more on this mentality. How presumptuous of the Wachowskis to think that a few African hackers and dashiki-clad Zion council members, some dreadlocks and a big rave can make all the hurt go away. This trivializes the entire African-in-America experience. Meanwhile, the movie is by whites and for whites, with the African characters in secondary roles, as usual. Noble negro types, to help the white protagonists along.

I have nothing against Bill Cosby presenting literate, successful Africans, as at least that is something our youth can and should emulate, but in Matrix, it is all fantasy. How can our youth be proud of this extreme artifice?

You remember that one, right? With the room of gifted child prodigies under the nanny-ship of The Oracle, particularly the little genius with the spoon-shaped head who was busy bending a spoon. How didja do that, son? Easy---

There is no Spoon.

Now, Larry Wachowski, months before Reloaded's massively anticipated release, got Matrix fanboys foaming in their droolcups when, asked about the reputedly eye-boggling new special effects in the new flick (shot back-to-back with Revolutions) and queried whether the Brothers Wachowski were about to Raise the Bar, replied: ""there is no Bar"".

Turns out he was just joking. ""There is no Bar"", get it?

The Audience didn't: Reloaded suffer the fate of everything that toys with the brutal, double-edged Sword of Hype. Given the cultic frenzy that surrounded the opening, given the peek the first Matrix provided into a world in which mankind had been played the fool by his Machines and shackled into an invisible bondage---given all of that, could anything deliver on such a Promise?

The answer, in true Matrix fashion: Revolutions is a Binary flick. You know, those little zeroes and ones that, taken together, represent The Holy Bible, or a storefront, or a superpowered cadillac sedan driven by two dredlocked razor-wielding monsters. The Desert of the Real; the World of Illusion.

With that in mind...

ONE: The Matrix Rating (the World of Illusion): 5 Stars. Reloaded is a technophile's fever-dream, and in this glossy, mechanistic, techno-sensual Real the Wachowskis entertain in spades.

Reloaded oozes style, just like its predecessor, and the supple combination of high-technology glossiness and urban grime that defined the unique visuals of the first movie have been delivered seamlessly into the sequel.

That's no surprise, since the Wachowskis wisely brought the entire team from the first movie along for the second ride. On hand for the sequel is Director of Photography Bill Pope and Costume Designer Kym Barrett, and both deliver the goods. Reloaded looks jaw-droppingly, drool-spatteringly delicious.

The original cast (minus, sadly, Tank & Apoc) are all back as well: Morpheus (an increasingly portly Laurence Fishburne), Trinity (Carrie-Ann Moss) and Neo (an increasingly Zen Keanu Reeves) all turn in competent, if not outstanding, performances, and Hugo Weaving's nefarious Agent Smith tries not to steal the show (and mostly fails: Reloaded is at its best when Weaving is snarling and mincing onscreen).

The Wachowskis toss in some other intriguing characters to round out the ensemble, including the dastardly Merovingian (played suavely, but talkatively, by Lambert Wilson), his gorgeous mistress Persephone (played tastily by Monica Bellucci), his razor-wielding Twin henchmen (done not with CGI, but played by real-life twins Adrian and Neil Rayment and a real-life razorblade!), and Jada Pinkett Smith's understated Captain Niobe.

So it entertains. But...

ZERO: The Desert of the Real Rating: 3 Stars. Is this the flick you wanted to see, thought you would see, when the credits rolled at the end of ""The Matrix""?

Me neither. Yes, ""Reloaded"" is anchored fore and aft and amidships with some eye-popping action setpieces, chiefly the Freeway chase and the mountain-top Chalet duel with the Merovingian's lackeys. Yes, it oozes style from its steel and CGI pores. If ""Matrix: Reloaded"" were a ship, it would have mighty pretty rigging and sails.

Yes, it was cool to see the big exo-skeleton walkers lumbering around in Zion. No, I didn't find the Zion Rave scene embarrassing (celebrate, party like it's 1999 chal, 'cause we're FREE! I can dig it).

But after the ""Burn the Barricades!"" coda of the first flick, I wanted something more. Neo can bend the ""rules"" of the Matrix now: he can tweak all those leetle zeroes and ones in his favor. So why stick around to fight Agent Smith in the tedious 'Burly Brawl'? Why not conjure up a few werewolves of his own to keep him busy?

Or, while we're at it---if 'waking up' those slave-minds is so critical to the Revolution, why not *really* shake things up a bit? You know, mebbe introduce a few square miles of the Kalihari Desert in the middle of the City?

Seen in the LED readout-afterburn of ""Matrix: Revolutions"", ""Reloaded"" makes considerably more sense: certainly it's operatic in its sleek, luxurious gloss and glamor.

But the real problem is this: the first ""Matrix"" was our very unauthorized glimpse into the Truth behind ""Reality"". It felt like finding out a very dangerous, dirty secret. It felt conspiratorial, which was half the fun.

It's pretty, true, and if you pick up the Ultimate collection and pop this baby in the hopper of your high-end system, you'll watch in amazement as the rafters shake, plaster cracks and falls, car alarms go off.

But at the end of the day, ""Reloaded"" is just another big action flick. Reloaded? Reheated---but still pretty tasty.

1465070,4,B00005JLTN,"Non-demanding fans of the original The Matrix will likely be enthralled by the second installment in the series. More demanding aficionados will likely have a few reservations, some of which will not be addressed until the release of the third feature, Matrix Revolutions. I fall into the latter category. Although there are things about The Matrix Reloaded that I like, the movie is so open-ended and riddled with gaping holes that it's virtually impossible to view this as a finished project. Writing this review makes me feel like I'm putting pen to paper after seeing only half of a motion picture. At this time, I recommend the movie for what it is, but I reserve the right to revise that opinion in six months. It is possible - perhaps even likely - that the shadow of Matrix Revolutions will be so long that it will fundamentally impact the effectiveness of The Matrix Reloaded.

The biggest problem with The Matrix Reloaded is that it is not a complete film. Moreso than other, recent multi-segment movie sagas (The Lord of the Rings, Back to the Future 2 & 3), this picture has a truncated, incomplete feel - as if the ending is intended as nothing more than an intermission for a five-hour spectacle. That will be fine when the entire trilogy is available for viewing, but, in the summer of 2003, it represents an impediment to full enjoyment of what the Wachowski Brothers have offered.

It has been four years since The Matrix reached screens, but, in the machine-dominated universe, only six months have elapsed. During that time, in large part due to the efforts of the messianic figure Neo (Keanu Reeves), the small human population inhabiting the hidden city of Zion has grown. The machines, taking notice of that growth, have decided to put an end to humanity. While the leaders of Zion prepare for war, Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne) takes Neo and Trinity (Carrie-Ann Moss) back into the Matrix to confer with the Oracle (the late Gloria Foster), hoping to learn how to fulfill the prophesy that will save mankind. While there, Neo encounters some new adversaries - such as the deadly-but-suave Merovingian (Lambert Wilson) and his seductive wife, Persephone (Monica Bellucci) - and an old one - the indefatigable Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving), who is literally beside himself.

The Matrix Reloaded delivers what a segment of the viewing audience expects - visually dynamic action sequences separated by interludes of wordy, often pretentious exposition. The only real intellectual titillation comes at the end, when the storyline lurches forward in a moderately unexpected direction. One of the best things about The Matrix is that it was smart as well as visceral. While it's not fair to call The Matrix Reloaded dumb, it's not on the same level as its predecessor, at least as far as intelligence goes. The movie's characters often pontificate about choice, fate, and causality, but, once you delve beneath the sheath of cryptic language, you discover that they're not saying much that's new or interesting.

There isn't much in the way of character development. The three protagonists are pretty much as we left them four years ago, although Neo has grown into his powers to the point where he's virtually indestructible within the Matrix. He's Superman in black, with no Kryptonite in sight. That limits the adrenaline level of his action sequences, since there's never any sense that he could lose a battle. When the fight involves Trinity and Morpheus, however, that's a different matter. These two are decidedly vulnerable, and therefore represent Neo's Achilles heel.

Keanu Reeves looks so good in Neo's gothic costume that it almost doesn't matter that he's not much of an actor. He's a great icon around which to design a bunch of special effects and he doesn't trip over his dialogue. (Not that he has much...) On the other hand, if you're looking for a hero to bond with, Neo's not the best choice. Reeves' underplaying, whether calculated or not, distances him from the audience. On the other hand, both Moss and Fishburne hold their own, with the latter repeatedly commanding the camera's attention. Hugo Weaving, taking a break from playing Elrond the Elf, brings his wonderfully dry wit to the part of Agent Smith. Lambert Wilson oozes false charm, and has the film's best one-liner (I won't repeat it here, but it has something to do with French cursing). Monica Bellucci is wasted, but she still looks great. Jada Pinkett Smith has a small role as Niobe, an ex-flame of Morphius' who now captains another ship.

While some viewers will be disappointed with the movie's inability to constantly engage the intellect, few will be anything less than awed by its eye candy. If there's one area in which The Matrix Reloaded tops The Matrix, it's in the visual effects department (not a surprise, considering the budgets of the movies). This is a great looking motion picture. Darkness abounds, and the Wachowskis take full advantage of its atmospheric possibilities, with nearly every scene transpiring in locales where man-made lights fight a losing battle to hold back the shadows. There are some amazing shots in and around Zion (including an Engineering room more elaborate than anything in Scotty's wet dreams), and some Terminator-like views of the machines as they go to work. And the climax to the film's centerpiece action sequence - a lengthy, convoluted car chase - is breathtaking to behold.

There are, of course, a large number of fight scenes. These include some relatively ""simple"" (and not terribly energetic) ones - Neo fighting a few agents, Trinity trying to survive a vicious onslaught, Neo ""proving"" that he's ""The One"" to a skeptical guardian, etc. But there are also three big ones. The first involves an elaborate confrontation between Neo and Agent Smith that ends with the Superman in black tangling with a small army while performing all sorts of gravity-defying stunts and using an iron pole as a baseball bat. (All that's missing is Vin Scully or Harry Kalas doing play-by-play.) The second has Neo stopping a lot of bullets in the ""usual"" way, then fending off a dozen or so bad guys. Then there's the car chase, which comes close to re-inventing the worn-out action staple. This isn't the usual, boring one-guy-chases-the-other-until-someone-crashes sequence. It goes on for a very long time, through various permutations, until it concludes with a literal bang. Good stuff, and worth the price of admission, even for those who are normally lulled to sleep by car chases. (Count me in that category.)

When The Matrix was released in 1999, it was not expected to be a big hit. Its stunning success surprised nearly everyone, including Warner Brothers. It cost about $60 million and grossed nearly three times that domestically. The video release widened its audience and increased its popularity. Production delays have meant a longer wait for the sequel than anyone intended, resulting in a Matrix feeding frenzy. As always when expectations are this high, there's bound to be a level of disappointment. Whether it becomes the highest-grossing R-rated film of all time or the biggest movie of the summer is of interest only to those who view box-office results like sports scores. On balance, The Matrix Reloaded does an admirable job of filling the niche it's supposed to - that of an action-oriented science fiction adventure. Only time and Matrix Revolutions will determine if the material contained here is just a noisy, visually lively distraction or whether there are deeper currents we're not yet aware of.",1121040000,2,7574,5.0055555555555555

By now the story is familiar, the hype has been raging for months and the wait is finally over. However, die-hard fans of the trilogy might be somewhat disappointed by the saga's middle chapter. For starters, no film can possibly live up to the media hype that precedes its release, i.e., Star Wars: Episode I. Fortunately for Matrix afficionados, the talented Wachowski brothers have more respect for their audience and general moviegoer's intelligence.

What's missing is the suspense and tension of Reloaded's predecessor. The narrative is more linear and the element of surprise and mystery is gone. The first hour tends to drag its feet; relatively unimportant characters and conflicts receive too much emphasis while some of the more crucial plotlines such as the machines that are drilling down to Zion and Agent Smith's (Hugo Weaving) ability to copy himself, are swept to the wayside. Some of those subplots might receive more attention in the final installment, which in itself leads to another, almost inescapable flaw of any trilogy: the sophomore part plays out like a whole lot of middle with not much resolution and a cliffhanger for a conclusion. However, it does whet the appetite for the eagerly-awaited third film that is due to be released in November.

1465072,3,B00005JLTN,"""The Matrix Reloaded"" is an ode to the highs and lows of sheer wretched excess. There's an incredible amount of what can only be called overload here - too much extemporizing, too much pop philosophy, and too much bloat. But the action here really is too much - in the best way possible - and that saves this movie.

""The Matrix Reloaded"" begins with an overwrought and over-philosophized first act, mostly set in the ""real world.""

We see the last human city, Zion, which is a giant cave set deep within the Earth.

Unlike the Matrix, where everyone drives cool cars, wears Armani, and can fight like a bionic version of Bruce Lee, Zion is not a cool place to be. It's rusty, dingy, dark, and depressing. Not surprisingly, nobody smiles much there, even when they're coming on to each other. Honestly, I was expecting Charlton Heston to make a cameo at any moment and start yelling out, ""Soylent Green is people!""

Unfortunately, the good citizens of Zion apparently have few outlets. One of them is chronicled in an extended sequence that combines a combination revival meeting and sweaty rave party with hundreds of thousands of participants (all of which happens in a giant cave), intercut with a pretty explicit lovemaking scene. The rave reminded me of a Grateful Dead concert, but without the beach balls and prospect of a nice, clean hotel room to go to afterwards. There's only so much togetherness you can take with your fellow humans, particularly when there's hundreds of thousands of them all around you, and they all smell like vegetarian burritos.

Unfortunately, the whole first act of ""The Matrix Reloaded"" set in this dingy ""real world,"" and the film almost sinks under the weight of the depressing environment, the silly political wrangling, and the bloated, unneccessary cavern rave party scene.

But when the action switches back to the sleek, almost magical world of the Matrix, ""The Matrix Reloaded"" kicks in with a ferocity and precision of a well-oiled machine gun.

The highlights are two brilliant set pieces, one involving a martial-arts contest between Neo and hundreds of clones of his nemesis from the first ""Matrix"" film, Agent Smith; the second is a car chase so brilliant and audacious that Steve ""Bullitt"" McQueen probably watched it from beyond with a big old grin. This is the kind of scene that the directors, Larry and Andy Wachowski, are absolutely brilliant at doing, and it makes you wonder why they spent the entire first act in the dingy, depressing space of the ""real world.""

There's also a terrific sequence featuring a character called ""The Merovingian,"" (Lambert Wilson), an oily-smooth Matrix denizen who is actually a computer program, and likes to spout curses in French because ""it's like wiping your ass with silk."" He and his wife, Persephone (Monica Bellucci), have a relationship driven by their enjoyment of their mutual distrust of one another, which serves as a counterpart to the trust-driven relationship between Neo and his beloved Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss).

This sequence, which plays out in a brilliantly sleek set, evolves into a remarkable martial arts contest between Neo and the Merovingian's henchmen. This scene, which comes right before the big car chase, is where ""The Matrix Reloaded"" really begins to kick in.

In retrospect, I suppose the over-the-top action sequences set in the Matrix, and the whole sequence with the Merovingian are just as bloated as the tedious first act, which is set in the ""real world"" of Zion. However, there's a critical difference: the Matrix is a cool place to be, and the ""real world"" looks a one-way trip to chronic depression.

All this made me wonder why the humans were at war to save Zion from the machines who control the Matrix. Wouldn't it make more sense for them to defeat the machines, take over the Matrix, and plug everyone back in so they can stop living the Soylent Green lifestyle of Zion and start living the good life?

Still, with all the brilliant, groundbreaking action any movie fan could want, ""The Matrix Reloaded"" is ultimately a rewarding film, worth three stars out of five.",1120089600,3,4109,4.921965317919075
1465073,4,B00005JLTN,"This whole trilogy is very unique and amzing and just absolutely amazing in terms of visuals. Reloaded is my favorite one though and it earned the 4 stars alone because of the action scenes. From the milllllllions of agent Smiths vs. Neo, to the fight against the frenchman's henchmen, to the awesome chase, it's original and just awesome. This movie could have definitely been one of the best movies ever but it feels confused. The plot feels confused with the sometimes bad acting to the weird story with some very random and pointless scenes. The movie also gets very boring and repetitive at times but the action scenes will leave you in such awe and amazement that you'll buy this movie just to rewatch them because stuff like this only occurs in this trilogy.",1119312000,,765,4.7164179104477615
1465074,4,B00005JLTN,"For some reason I have a bad habit of never following up on sequels until years later.  It's a flaw that occurs when I like something, but not quite enough to wait in lines at theaters or reserve copies at a rental store when I'm never quite sure of my schedule.  The Matrix falls into that category, very well done and imaginative, no doubt, but it didn't stir me enough to rush to see the sequels.

Now I've seen Reloaded, and I continue to be impressed, not so much by the raw imagination of Matrix, but by it's ability to skirt the obvious paradigms that the viewer expects and hare off instead in entirely new directions.  Of course, the wild chases and fight scenes are here in all their glory.  At a certain point, they actually become abstract and tedious extravaganzas.  The Wachowski's put everything they can into Neo's acrobatics, coming closer and closer to a bloodbath that never actually happens.  Unfortunately this means stretching them out until they cry for editing.

In spite of all this showmanship, it is the plot and characters that really make this film.  Neo struggles to discover what he needs to do Morpheus seeks after the Oracle, and a whirl of voice enhance characters sweep across the screen like Dune revisited.  New characters like Merovingian and Persephone liven things up.  And Agent Smith turns into a cast of thousands all by himself.

Doom is descending to destroy Zion, and Neo must decide what is important, what is real, what is maze, and what is purpose.  Zion itself comes to life beautifully, and we finally get an understanding of how this culture of rebels really works.  My only irritation is that the film ends in a total cliffhanger, which somehow smacks of cheating.

It doesn't have the same originality, creativity, intensity, passion and excitement as the 1st and original movie in the Matrix trilogy, but you really need to be a true die-hard Matrix fan to watch the 2nd and 3rd Matrix movies in this trilogy, in my opinion to truly enjoy them.  I would not have bought the DVDs:  ""The Matrix Reloaded"" or ""The Matrix Revolutions"" if I had watched them BEFORE I bought them - (I wish I had just rented them instead).  I never regretted buying the 1st and original movie:  ""The Matrix"" on DVD, (which I consider to be a masterpiece).

1465106,4,B00005JLTN,"Ok, I truly do not know what other people are talking about.  I thought this was a fantastic, epic, amazing sci-fi sequel to one of the best movies I've ever seen! The action sequences are brilliantly coreographed and the visuals are mind-blowingly good. The story line gets deeper and deeper that answers some questions of the first and poses new quesions. The characters in the first Matrix become more developed and have more of a personality, and there are new characters so that it's not completely centered around neo. The dialogue is intriguing, and well written.

  So why did i give it a four out of five?  Given, this movie does have some flaws.  The Zion scene took forever and completely bored me, and the scene between trinity and neo was completely unnecessary.  The new characters are blatantly introduced with little personality, and had little background to base them on.

1465107,2,B00005JLTN,"I'm not about to stand up on my little soapbox here and proclaim the first Matrix film a triumph of science fiction that radically altered all subsequent movies in the genre. Well, I'll say that but I won't take credit for being the first schlep to recognize this blatantly obvious fact. Even a chimpanzee waking up from a five-year coma knows the Wachowski brothers revolutionized the concept of the thriller with this exciting film. The fact that they--the Wachowski brothers, not the chimpanzee--pulled it off in spite of casting boat anchor Keanu Reeves in the lead role made the coup even more exhilarating. Yep, ""The Matrix"" is an experience I rarely tire of; I can watch the movie over and over and always get something new out of it. That is why I came away with a heavy heart after watching the much anticipated sequel, ""The Matrix: Reloaded."" Where the first film oozed originality, the second sinks under clich. Where the first developed interesting characters the viewer came to care about, the second dumbs them down into cartoon caricatures. Where the first achieved a balance of action and philosophical musings, the second resorts to over the top acrobatics and nonsensical mumbo jumbo.

We learned at the end of the first film that Neo (Boat Anchor) realized his destiny and could now destroy the matrix at will. Why the need for a second film? Beyond the idea of Hollywood cashing in, I can't say. Sadly, I have a tough time recalling the intricacies of ""Reloaded."" I remember Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne) orating to the assembled masses in the underground city of Zion in a series of scenes that had me laughing hysterically one minute and feeling embarrassed for the actor the next. What follows is even worse: some sort of extended slow motion dance number involving all the residents of Zion spliced together with a touchy feely love scene between Neo and Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss). It's reassuring to know that when the fate of humanity hangs in the balance everyone turns into a hoofer. Gimme a break! Then the movie introduces us to some other characters, primarily new crewmember Link (Harold Perrineau Jr.), a former associate of Morpheus named Niobe (Jada Pinkett Smith), the Architect (Helmut Bakaitis), Persephone (Monica Bellucci), the Merovingian (Lambert Wilson), the Keymaker (Randall Duk Kim), and a bunch of other folks. Watch the movie if you want to know what these people do. My response to their various onscreen activities was a resounding ""Who cares?""

By the time I slogged halfway through this film, I began to wonder if the Wachowskis were pulling a subtle prank on us. ""Ahhh, this must be a parody,"" I thought. If it isn't it should be. Everything we saw in the first picture reappears here pumped up on steroids or is the exact inverse of things established in the first film. Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving) returns in all his teeth gnashing glory, but the movie eviscerates any threat he once posed. Remember in the first film when we learned that agents were dreaded figures to face in combat? In ""Reloaded"" everyone lines up to take a crack at these guys. So much for any sense of menace. Trinity also presents a significant problem. A tough, gorgeous, no nonsense chick in the first film, she now turns into a weepy, doe eyed woman who follows Neo around like a puppy dog. It's simply infuriating to watch. Fishburne put on so much weight that he evokes painful images of Steven Seagal as he lopes through the action sequences. Need I go on? O.K. I roared my head off when I noticed Cornel West playing one of Zion's councilors. Talk about unbelievable! Any society that puts this nut job in a position of authority is doomed to destruction! And so it goes, one ridiculous scene after another. What a disappointing--and painfully long--sequel.

I know it sounds like I hated every aspect of ""Reloaded."" I hated most of it, but I did enjoy a few things. The action scenes, while totally overdone to the point of self-parody, were entertaining. I would definitely watch the chase scene on the highway again, and I liked some of the fight scenes between Neo and Smith as long as I didn't look too closely. Unfortunately, I looked too closely. Notice how the graphics look like a bad video game in the big showdown between the Smith clones and Neo. I'm sure fanboys have a quick retort to that comment, but I don't want to hear it. That particular fight ultimately stunk and that's that. Outside of the action scenes, it was nice to see Gloria Foster reprise her role as the Oracle (she soon died and her role went to someone else in the third entry), and the idea that the machines are launching a massive assault on Zion and will be there in 36 hours is a neat touch too, helping to add at least a modest amount of suspense to the proceedings. But the parts can't save the whole, and ""The Matrix: Reloaded"" on the whole is an overblown, lumbering beast sinking under its own stinking weight into a pit of abject banality.

Another positive about ""Reloaded"": it ends and ""Revolutions"" begins. The third entry, although suffering from some of the same flaws found here, is vastly more entertaining then this scattershot effort. The special effects found in ""Revolutions"" will blow your mind, the mumbo jumbo fades into the background a bit, and some real suspense unfolds. Too, Morpheus foregoes any attempt at public speaking. I think ""Reloaded"" might have succeeded if everyone involved sat down and just admitted they should make an effects heavy actioner. There wasn't any chance of topping the original, so why masquerade nonsense as deep thought when all you really want to do is blow stuff up?",1111449600,3,5645,4.792607802874743

1465110,3,B00005JLTN,"As special effects go, MR topped the first film however as far as story, character development, and suspense, MR was really mediocre, and I can say this because I am a Matrix fan but also a movie critic who is aware when a sequel is just made for the big bucks. The Wachowski brothers, really giving a damn if they really delivered a good film. I mean it's like the George Lucas thing I've mentioned a dozen times on here, the directors can make a somewhat average film with awesome special effects and get away because they know they're is going to be a bunch of fans going to see the movie  just to see the effects,stuff blow up, and cleavege.

Ok MR is the sequel to the 1999 Matrix where a young hacker named Neo (Keanu Reeves) is chosen to be the one in a computer generated world mingling with reality. Neo is told to ''he is the one'' by Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne) and his leather wearing sexy friend Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss). At the of the Matrix becomes aware of his superpowers and realizes that he is the one, and learns briefly of the history of Zion and it's enemies,including mechanical insects called ''The Osiris'' (who also make a brief return in this sequel.

Now fast forward to the MR and we know get a look at the city of Zion that Morpheus was talking about. However, trouble lurks when Morpheus learns that the Osiris are making a return to crush the city. Morpheus prepares the city for battle with a bunch of cliched speeches, however he also wants to contact the Oracle to see if the prophecy for Zion and Neo will be fullfilled and thus end the war for Zion. Meanwhile, Neo has now grasps and flaunts his special powers as the one which include flying (yes like Superman, God how original lol), expertise in the martial arts. However prior to this in a badly staged but entertaining scene Neo has a long vision of Trinity invading a building and blowing up with a motorcycle, while she makes a nice squat landing. : -0 What Genius!!! His vision ends terribly know when he sees that Trinity is fatally wounded in midair by one the computer clone agents of Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving). Neo pushes aside the incident for the moment, but does not forget it.

So now we begin with some of the cheesy cliches in the film including the public speech Morpheus gives to the Zion citizens to fight the Osiris:

Morpheus ''Tonight let them remember this is Zion and we are not afraid'' (queue up the Extras for a loud roar. LMAO).

So Neo and Morpheus eventually leave Zion to meet the Oracle while the Zion forces prepare for the situation of the Osiris however problems arise again when the Oracle (a worthless character play a worthless actress) tells them that their problems with the prophecy of Neo.

So then Neo meets the allknowing Oracle (Gloria Foster) and finds out how idiotic she is LOL

Neo: ''I suppose the obvious questions is how can

I trust you ?''

Oracle ''Bingo''

LOL What mediocre writing and this is really an annoying part of the movie because the Oracle just basically like a parrot repeats with sarcasm what Neo questions

and answers. LOL So basically the Oracle in MR like in the first movie has really no purpose.

Neo does learn from the conversation I mean he learns what he already knows from the Oracle:

The Oracle is basically just a mediocre program in the Matrix. He learns that the programs in the Matrix like Agent Smith are now hacking other programs and

becoming stronger posing a threat to the Matrix universe, and this is confirmed when Agent Smith surprises Neo with a sneak attack that ends in laughable fashion with Agent Smith multiplying himself in characters to kill Neo but still failing LOL. This one of the most awful, and laughing hysterical fight sequences. You remember those dance fight scenes from ''West Side Story'' with Natalie Wood? LOL Thats exactly what you get here. It's so bloody awful it's funny, MST3K material in fact.

The badly acted fight scene ends with jokes with

Morpheus asking Neo if it was Agent Smith:

Morpheus ''Was it Smith?''

Neo ''Yes''

Morpheus ''Now theres more than one of them?''

Neo ''A lot more'' LMAO

So Neo now wants to seek out the source and origin of the Matrix and he learns of a keymaker that holds a part of the answer to the Matrix and a couple of new characters , however trouble abounds again when Neo meets the Maitre'D (David Franklin) who holds the keymaker (whose basically a cheap asian locksmith guy lol) and does give him up. Futhermore the Maitre' D sends the ''The Twins'', special programs like Agent Smith with special abilities and who are now hell

bent on killing Neo and his friends.....

The MR as the name comes loaded with special effects. The action including the nearly 7 minute car chase scene with Neo illustrating his super powers in that scenes is great. The special effects and budget I read costs over $200

million dollars and it does show for the most part.

That pretty much is it for the Pros believe it or not now we get to the cons.

The MR is the least successful sequel with the largest number of worthless characters I've seen. I felt tortured when I watch these crappy characters on  screen and made my self a sandwitch until we got to the point of the film , the action and effects including being blown up. lol Not really. As stated by first half  of the film I knew it was already a mess, a nice entertaining mess filled with special effects.

First there is the short scene with one of the counselor of Zion (Jon Voight) that is incredibly annoying who basically just explains that he is an idiot that doesnt understand the way the world works. LOL Seriously thats the whole the point of this character. Then we have the character of Link , the black hacker (portrayed by mediocre actor Harold Perrineau Jr.) best known for his antics as the wheelchair bound convicted rapist in HBO's ''Oz'' (now over thank God). He's characters basically is there as comic relief (as if we needed any with this mess.) and act as the cheerleader for Neo and company. Oh yean and he has a worthless girl too.

One critic said that MR fully develops the relationship between Trinity and Morpheus. LOL What relationship. At heart of both this films is that while Trinity and Morpheus

are strong, they are also weak and they need Neo to bail out of critical situations of which they are helpless. That is the relationship. Then there is the character of Niobe (Jada Pinkett Smith, Will Smith's Wife), who is the ex-girlfriend of Morpheus, who comes back to Zion to lead the fight against the Osiris

All in all, I could go on and on about the flaws of MR it is heavily flawed, it was a blockbuster for the effects only folks, but with the somewhat absurd story in this, the movies

deserves ends up just being a ""popcorn"" movie.",1109289600,,6778,4.537766830870279

It was as if they were trying to recreate an MTV video where everyone was wearing earthy-toned clothes. Everything was so contrived and BORING. The only really spectacular scene was when Keanu Reeves was fighting off the thousands of attacking agent clones. The first half was full of pointless sentimentality that left me with an aftertaste which didn't disappear as the action scenes increased.

1465139,2,B00005JLTN,"The first Matrix was the Phantom Menace that George Lucas did not see coming... and neither did we. The original Matrix was an underdog of a movie that became a hot thing AFTER people ran out of the cinemas with their jaws covered in popcorn crumbs from hitting the sticky floor. The Matrix did have some stunning special effects, but bullet-time was nothing new. We had seen this effect in commercials, documentaries and some smaller films. However the Matrix used bullet-time as a plot device and that is why it stunned everyone. The Matrix also had this whole ""mind-trip"" conspiracy thing going that really drove the story forward. It was easy to understand - cyberpunk hacker is the chosen one, discovers that he is living inside a computer generated reality and uses his talents to help save mankind in a superhero sort of way. Wonderful stuff.

The Matrix Reloaded suffers from not understanding what made the first film so good. It misses all the ""mind-trip"" stuff - ALL of it entirely, thus rendering Reloaded devoid of the mystical/anarchic/quasi-religious bent that the first one had. The ""mind-trip"" stuff messes up in three critical parts to the film - the meeting with the Oracle, the meeting with the Architect and a new revelation for Morpheus about the prophecy. Instead of playing games with the audience, like the first matrix did, this one is trying to explain things - all of which is a plot device to help forward the storyline - but instead it has a reflexive effect of simply nullifying what made the first Matrix so enchanting. Reloaded is thus left extremely open to interpretation: nothing in the first film is valid, and thus everything in this one is confusing. So instead of being intrigued you are left feeling stumped and bothered by a sequel that seems to be battering the original to death while at the same time trying to be better than the first.

The first half hour of the Matrix is a snooze-fest. It spends time too much time on Zion, introducing new characters, and trying to setup the plot which is.... nothing, except that Neo must go visit the oracle to figure out what to do next before Zion is capitulated by a load of drones sent to attack it. But does Neo not control the Matrix somehow? Lots of what you took you granted goes out the window by this point, while the filmmakers concentrate on a sex scene between Neo and Trinity followed up on by a ""burning man"" dance routine that has no reason for being in this picture. There is bound to be trouble brewing. The audience is asleep until.... Neo meets the Oracle and then after that Reloaded really shows us why we came to see it by putting on the special effects in a ""never-seen-before"" sort of way.

Twenty minutes into the film and you will understand that the filmmakers are not really that pushed to deliver on the story. What they want to do is create a movie that is actually the equivalent of a new ""Theme Park"" attraction. So basically Reloaded is playing down the story and replacing it with multi-million dollar special effects. With that in mind Reloaded is an experience like no other, but the story is given the back door treatment fairly quickly. There are some surprises in store and some plot twists that will keep you going but lurking in the background is an entity called - Joel Silver and he just wants the audience to sit there with mouths open during the special effects sequences and hopefully all other misgivings will be put aside when the audience starts doing just that. The truth is that Reloaded is a revolution in special effects, but is also Joel Silver marketing at its finest. You know that when you have seen it once that you will want to see it again, but as for the plot and storyline... well Silver thinks that is all just cannon fodder for the canvas.... and all he wants to do is paint.

(Spoilers Ahead)

I have one gripe.  The love scene between Neo and Trinity and the scene in the temple with everyone dancing around half naked were a disappointment.  Both those scenes were totally unnecessary and uncalled for.  We know Neo loves Trinity and we know Trinity loves Neo.  We din't need to see them make love.  That was a cheap thrill and I don't understand why the directors went there.  They certainly couldn't have been worried about getting an audience.  That having been said, The Matrix Reloaded is still a great ride.  Some say that this film is the worst of the set but I disagree.

Many of these scenes have never been seen or even thought of before. There are so many new things to see here. My review would go on for days if I tried to explain them here. Don't feel left out while others discuss the theologies and philosophies of The Matrix. Instead, watch it for what you can get out of it. You may note something that everyone else missed. There are many levels and we don't get all of them at the same time.

While many find flaws and faults with all of The Matrix films (what movie isn't flawed?) still others will walk away unimpressed as I did. Mind you I haven't seen any of the Matrix films in the theater. I do urge you to see them more than once. Once the inital shock is over, the many levels contained therein will start to seep into your brain. Pretty soon instead of saying Huh? what? you say Ahah!! I get it. So that's what that means.

The Matrix Trilogy has ushered in a new era of sci-fi just as Star Wars did back in the day. It seems like a million years ago. We will never be the same!! We may never be satisfied with the same old thing again. The sci-fi world is forever changed now.

I must add my kudos to the main cast. They all did some amazing stunt work and really pushed themselves physically and mentally to learn all of the martial arts moves and other dazzling feats. You can see how hard they trained when you watch the special features on each dvd. Yes there are a lot of CGI scenes but the actors are underneath most of it providing the movement for the camera to capture. Great wire and stunt work.  The sets are fantastic.

Parental advisory: There is violence in this movie. There is no nudity or sex but there is foul language and unfortunately the Lord's name is taken in vain. I would advise a viewing age of at least 16 because the plots are so demanding that a younger mind may not grasp the details.

1465142,4,B00005JLTN,"I'm sick of it. I'm sick of people saying that they HATE this movie, people saying that it RUINED the first one for them. What is wrong with these people? Can they not get over the fact that it's not going to be as revolutionary as the Matrix was? Well if so, they're gonna be crying for a long time, for no movie in the near future is going to surpass the revolutionary Matrix movie.....even if Matrix Revolutions itself didn't. However, Reloaded came as close as it could to reaching this benchmark. So get out of the past and join the awesome ride that is the Matrix Reloaded.

(WARNING....SPOILERS AHEAD)

Let's start with the greatness. The special effects are absolutely amazing. Through the various memorable scenes, whether Neo be kicking 100 angry businessmen around or Trinity dodging oncoming semis on her motorcycle.....this action gives you a feeling that other movies can't seem to create.

This movie also has a brain. It makes you think deep, and parallels can be dug up from the dialouge. However, this is also what angered many people about the trilogy. I guess this is their problem.....If they're not willing to take a break from the action, they get all worked up and decide to bash on the movie. Too bad for the people that walked out of the theater during the Merovingian's speech. They missed the best half of the movie, which leads to my next point.

The whole movie is great, but the first half of Reloaded lacks the pacing that the first Matrix had. The Matrix, in my opinion, had the best, most consistent pacing of any movie I had ever seen. However, Reloaded doesn't reach this level until the second half of the movie. This is probably the main reason why many people didn't like Reloaded. However, in these rather slow scenes in Reloaded there is key dialouge that, if taken seriously, can be taken to very deep philosophical level.

In the end, Reloaded isn't a 5-star movie. I gave it 4 because the first half lacked the pacing of the second. But unlike MANY people, I was willing to listen to dialouge during these slow parts.

So why is it that he gets his ass handed to him time and time again, especially in ""Revolutions."" To get to the point, ""Reloaded"" fails to adhere to the rules set in the first film. This review won't drone on like much of the dialogue in said film. I'll simply end with saying that this film is a truly awful addition to a movie that changed the face of science fiction. The filmmakers should have spent extra time working on a logically sound script before shooting their wad so fast.",1104969600,9,716,4.303703703703704
1465145,4,B00005JLTN,"""We can never see past a choice we don't understand"".

And Morpheus old buddy, there's no way we can see past a plot point we don't understand either. In fact, the first of two sequels to the smash film ""The Matrix"" is littered with so much gobbledygook, and an abundance of confusing plot subterfuge - that I dare anyone to decode it within one viewing.

""The Matrix Reloaded"" - not unlike its predecessor - might be hard to swallow but it's so delicious you just can't help but want more. Not unlike one of those gobstoppers you can find in any candy store - Hard to chew, nice to endure, if you will.

A spectacle for the ears and eyes, ""The Matrix Reloaded"" is the sequel fans of the first one have been craving for. The action sequences are bigger and better, the effects are eye-popping, and the story - apart from being mind-boggling - stays one step ahead of its audience at all times. But it's that story that also deters enjoyment there in a couple of spots. There's a little too much partisan speeches and drawn out mockery and while there's nothing wrong with exposition scenes, unfortunately some of these moments deter from the action sequences, which are significantly more entertaining than the plot. On first viewing, the plot seems to be all over the place. Large helpings of waffle sprinkled throughout the film. Those who've seen the first film a few dozen times might find it a bit easier to understand than those who haven't - but all in all there's a little ""too much"" here. Maybe it makes sense, maybe it doesn't - that'll have to be decided upon repeated viewings.

But as an action extravaganza, The Wachowski's have matched the spectacle of - if not bettered - that of the original. A lengthy battle-scene taking place on a tiring freeway is one of the film's grand highlights and scenes where Neo is soaring through the skies like the Man of Steel are awe-inspiring [If Warner can re-create something like this for ""Superman"", maybe the remake will be worth the wait].

Some will have a problem with it, some just won't understand it, but for most, the only disappointment will be the all too annoying ""To be Concluded"" tag, that's stamped on the final frame.",1103846400,,2187,4.611825192802057
1465146,4,B00005JLTN,"At the end of the first movie, Neo became The One.  Now he is legendary amongst the free humans and the city of Zion.

But what is The One really?  Who is the Oracle and why is she allowed to exist?  That is the main thrust of this chapter of the Matrix saga.

But no quest is simple.  Agent Smith has brand new abilities thanks to his defeat by Neo in the first movie.  No longer is he a simple enforcement program.  Now he is more like a virus, able to overwrite his code onto others.

So we have Neo's quest to find out what he is, the new threat from Smith, and of course the machines are stepping up their efforts to wipe out the free humans.  Quite a lot for a movie that some feel is just a bunch of special effects.

But this movie is not just special effects.  The answered questions go a long way to making this chapter make far more sense than the first.  The setting is some time after the first movie and it would be nice to know a little more about what went on during that time but the revelation of Zion helps to make up for it.

All in all this is a very good sequel although the true movie was too long and it was split into two pieces.  This means that this chapter ends a little abruptly and you might want to have the next chapter available before you watch this one.",1103673600,,1288,4.015748031496063
1465147,4,B00005JLTN,"I'm a huge fan of the Matrix films - I know of no other trilogy that is as spectacular to watch or as intellectually engaging as these are. That said - the Matrix Reloaded was a slight disappointment to me, definitely not as strong as either the first movie or Revolutions.

The first Matrix is one of those rare films that has no weak point. It's absolutely captivating the whole way through. Revolutions is also not far behind. I can't say the same of Reloaded though. Whilst the most important of the three in terms of plot development and visually and technically very impressive there are scenes which are either too long or just plain unneccessary which spoil the overall viewing experience. Once you've seen it a couple of times you really can dispense with the first half hour of the film which is painfully slow at times and offers little value in terms of plot or character development.

The freeway chase was technically very impressive but if you've seen one big car chase you've kinda seen them all.... it didn't really offer anything new or terribly exciting for me and I felt even viewing it for the first time in the cinema it dragged a little... Some of the shots of Trinity on the bike you can see she's only riding along at about 10 mph!! The burly brawl was fabulous eye-candy but I do accept other reviewers criticisms that it went on a little too long for Neo just to fly away at the end.

Being the middle of three, the movie has the tough job of unravelling what is a brilliant, but multi-layered, complicated plot whilst upping the special-effects ante from it's predecessor. It acheives this well for the most part but suffers from an audience perspective in trying to be almost *too* clever. The answers it delivers are either almost riddle-like or just plain overcomplicated. The Architect speech at the end was the most important point in the entire trilogy but the rhetoric took several viewings to fully digest what was being said and it's implications. This is fine for the fans of the Matrix who are prepared to re-watch, dicuss and look for the answers to their questions, but it alienates the more casual viewer from the Matrix world. This is a shame because the viewing experience of Revolutions becomes richer the more you understand Reloaded.

The first Matrix and Revolutions achieved a perfect harmony of superb plot and jaw-dropping special effects, but Reloaded is a little far behind these two here. It was given a lot to do in terms of plot and special effcts and whilst it tries hard, it finds the load on it's shoulders a little too heavy at times which results in it losing it's way a little at various points. A great movie, a great Matrix movie, but not as strong as one or three.",1103673600,,2729,4.609053497942387

1465151,1,B00005JLTN,"Ok, This movie, was very dissapointing.  After the first fight with 3 agents and Neo, I thought, this was gonna be good.  But then the movie just goes on for about a 55 minute streak of long boring and some not needed diolauge(Such as making that 16 year old kid that looks up to Neo look bad)

The next time we get some action is the Zion dance ball?  Hey we get to see Neo and Trinity get intamite, and it's a whole lot worse than cinamax.  And the dance sceene along with it I could help but laugh.  Gee what's more funny that seeing 1,000,000 people do the caveman dance, and some queer as folk?(Didn't Neo in the first one say Trinity looked like a man.  UUGH!!)

Finally hollywood action breaks out in the Burley Brawl, where Neo takes on about 100 agent smiths.  The fight was pretty entertaining, but it was getting repetitive, and after he flew off, I was just wondering, why the fudge didn't he do that sooner?!  Sometimes they have too much diolauge before they just get to the freakin point(EX. The frenchman talks for like 7 minutes before he answers Neo, Morpheus, and Trinity's question.  And the whole kiss thing is stupid(If I was Neo, I would choose that chick he was kissing over Trinity).

Now the chase sceene is waaaay toooo long!!  It wasn't really a pulse raiser.  It's really pretty boring, and it gets more, and more boring to the end.

Then after that it takes like 40 minutes for the movie to end.  This is suppose to be an action movie, but yet everyones mouths, not moves(Sadly) was doing all the talking.

This movie accually had a pretty lame plot, but the seriously needed a editor.  Because the diolauge made the movie more slower, boring, and retarted.  I just can't say how dissapointed I was.  This movie just basicly dragged, but I was under the immpression that this movie was gonna go out with flying colors.  Guess what I was dead wrong

Unfortunately, the creators of this masterpiece have fallen into the old, tired Hollywood infection called ""sequelitis"" wherein the producers of a breathtakingly original film try to squeeze even more money out of it than they really have the skill for.

""Reloaded"" fails on so many levels it's hard to know where to begin, so I think I'll concentrate on the worst point.  That is, the Architect.

What was the point of dragging us through an hour and a half of fight scenes and occasionally interesting plot twists, only to have a couch potato in a white suit tell us that it's all irrelevant anyway?  Did anyone actually bother to read the script before cutting it to film?  Apparently not - if they had, they'd have noticed it.  This is a plot hole so big you could drive a truck through it, and the worst part is that there's a third irrelevant movie to follow!  Why bother?

1465187,4,B00005JLTN,"It was inevitable that the Matrix Reloaded was not going to live up very well to fan expectations.  And how could it?  The astranomical hype surrounding the movie before its release virtually garanteed that a lot of people were going to be disappointed.  I saw the movie on DVD about a year after it came out.  I was curious to see it, and I pretty much ignored the hype and got to see the movie with a clean slate.

After my first viewing, My general feelings were, ""Wow, that was a great action movie, but there were a few problems"".  I'll go into specific detal why I thought this movie was good by examening common fan complaints

1.  The Zion dance scene:  OK, this scene is absaloutly pointless, aside from being able to see nipples through clear wet shirts.  It was too long, added nothing to the plot and was pointless.

2.  Too much dialoge:  Well, to explain the plot well, you need a lot of dialoge.  And we need breaks from the action as well.  As hard as it may seem, non-stop action scenes can be a bad thing.  Dialoge adds a lot of plot and charachter development to a movie.  Here, we learn that the Oracle really likes candy, and that she is a program.  We learn that Neo has been flying a lot by listening to Link's dialog.  Watch the Lord of the Rings trilogy.  Some of the best scenes are nothing more then two charachters talking to each other.  Example:  Gandalf and Pippin in Minas Tirith in the third movie, talking about death.

3.  The architechts insane dialoge:  The first time you hear it, the dialoge is confusing and strange.  But the architect is a program.  He rarely, if ever, deals with huamans, so he uses machine talk, so to speak.  But if you watch it several times, the dialoge makes sense and seems natural (for a machine).

4.  Neo's Psychic powers:  Finding out that Neo can stop machines using only his mind is a really interesting plot twists that open a lot of possibilities.  How is this possible...unless...holy crud, a matrix within a matrix!  Or it could be something else.  The movie leaves the slate blank so you can come up with your own conclusion.  Good idea in my opinion.

5.  The Kid:  The kid has been riddiculed a lot, but I think he is a fine side charachter.  He is simply a fan of Neo, and he shows it.  What's wrong with that?  I'm sure you've been obsessed with somebody at one time in your life.

What I didint like:

Everything involving the Merovingian:  I hate this charachter with a passion.  I think he's unbelivably annoying.  He probably chose the French language just to be annoying to everybody around him.  No wonder Pershonaphe hates him.

The crisis:  the crisis of the movie, ""Zion is going to be destroyed and we need to do something about it"" is only vaugly stated in the beginning.  The introduction of the crisis needs to be more solid, rather then just saying, ""The machines are digging,"" and hoping the viewer has played Enter the Matrix.

What I really liked:

Morpheus as an action hero:  Seeing Morpheus wield a sword and a gun at the same time while dressed in a snazzy outfit is amazing to watch.  I think Morpheus has his best moments in the trilogy here.

The freeway chase scene:  What's not to like about this scene.  It's cool, and the agent battle on the Semi is just as good as the Neo subway fight in the first movie

The burly brawl:  Even if some of the effects are a bit off, it's a damn fun scene to watch.  Lots of fighting and awesome camera moves really sell the scene for me.

Remember that hype is an evil thing.  It will give you unrealistically high expectations that are all but impossible to meet.  Try to watch the movie while just ignoring how dissapointed you were with it.

Maybe I've helped you to change your opinion just a little bit about the movie.  But at least think about it.  I've found that as time goes on, the movie ages well and the plot becomes more clear and easy to understand",1097625600,3,3906,4.4022503516174405
1465188,1,B00005JLTN,"What a shame that this second release in the Matrix trilogy couldn't continue to deliver on the manic and original fun of the first.

1465189,3,B00005JLTN,"- but that's about it.

The big chase scene is exciting, and must have filled two scrapyards with the cars they trashed. The numerous fight scenes are well choreographed and wired. The visual style takes what worked in the original Matrix and took it a step beyond.

But somehow, it was too much and not enough. The action scenes were technically outstanding, but just seemed to go on and on. A little more resolution, a little sooner would have worked a lot better for me. The invading electro-squid were great animation, but somehow incidental - something in the background, not quite connected to the action. The visual style took what originality there was in the original Matrix, and drove it well past anything that made sense.

Most of all (or least of all) was the inflection infection that flattened every spoken line in the movie. It was quite an achievement to take actors as good as Fishburne and Moss, and turn their voices in to the verbal equivalent of typewritten text. As near as I could tell, the directors couldn't get any variation into Keanu Reeves's voice, but they could get it out of everyone else's so they did.

It's showy, it's got action, it's got good effects. It just doesn't have the spirit that leaves me caring whether the heroes succeed or fail.

And it does have an obvious come-on to a sequel. I guess the worst part is knowing that I'll probably watch that, too.

1465190,1,B00005JLTN,"Okay the first thing you need to know about the Matrix trilogy is that the first one was awesome, the second and third were not. That said let's find out why it was such pure drivel.

First, they took the prediction factor to an all-time high. Neo's in love, he has a choice between saving the world and the girl he loves. [Sounding like Spider-man on the bridge with the car and mary jane anyone] What does he do. Goes after the girl, because he can save the world after that. Other factors were predictable as well. We're driving down a freeway, Morpheus has a big sword facing an SUV, what's he going to do? Trinity is on a bike with no gun, how will she survive? Um. Pretty basic archetypical answers. Good guys have to win. They only die supporting their cause directly.

Second, the graphics in the first movie looked more realistic, more plausible even when we knew we were in the matrix. But in the second we go the way of Lucas. Over the top. Color intensity gone awry and it's a drab set up. A battle with a thousand Agent Smith's and not even a scratch or plausible looking scene when it was all digital. Even Gollum looked better back in the Fellowship.

Third, the cheesy ""plot twist"" that is the extensialistic approach. The first movie was all about acknowledging the fact that you have a choice. The Second is all about do you have one at all really? With Neo being forced to choose in a situation that already has a predetermined answer we will find out at the end of Revolutions. There was no significant development in the way of expanding and addressing another aspect of the philosophical reasons behind the plot.

Fourth, the Hollywood influence felt in the movie. By hollywood influence I mean, the shoddy graphics, the staple dance scene, the intimate sex scene, and other worthless scenes not relevant to the esential idea of extensialism. There used to be a message in the first movie. The second one lost it.

Fifth, there was nothing unpredictable in the movie. [This was so bad that I had to mention it again.] Jada ditches boyfriend to lead a ship to support Lawerence's cause. Who doesn't see them getting back together to some extent in the end? Or the uh oh they have this big plan that must be pulled off exactly to prevent the building from blowing up, something won't go wrong will it?

In the end, the movie entertains you on the lowest plain of existence, but it's not worthy of the Matrix precedent that the first movie established. If you think about it, only rent the movie. It'll save you a lot of money in the long run, because you won't watch it more than a once, unless you like pointless and predictable action flicks.",1097107200,,2664,4.505175983436853
1465191,1,B00005JLTN,"I'm fairly certain this review won't help anyone understand the movie but I felt I had to comment on this movie.

*Ahem* Why must the main characters wear sunglasses whenever they enter the Matrix? I was confused as to why they wore sunglasses in elevators and rooms without windows.

Why was the best fight-scene in the movie made entirely from computer graphics? When Neo fought his arch-enemy, or more appropriately, arch-enemies, after consulting the Oracle, it was computerized to the point where it reminded me of Mortal Kombat or Dead or Alive video games. If only I could plug into the T.V. and help out Neo.

Why does the architect merely sit around watching T.V. all day? He created the Matrix yet he has nothing to do...

What's up with the French villian in the restaurant? Doesn't he have passion for his wife anymore? She's beautiful yet he goes to restaurants and watches other women get off from his drug laced tiramisus. What a pervert! He thinks he's cool but he's not. He probably goes to Denny's and does the same thing on the local soccer moms.

Since when did Neo become a Kryptonian? Whenever I see him fly I have the urge to sing the Mighty Mouse theme: ""Here I come to save the daaaaay!""

Whatever happened to the other guy from Bill and Ted? Whenever I watch this movie I always wonder about him.

*Part of the fun is becoming an expert in the deep meaning of shallow pop mythology and Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne) now joins Obi-Wan Kenobi as the Plato of our age.

""The Matrix"", written and directed by the brothers Andy and Larry Wachowski, inspired so much philosophy and so many action films that it's all ""The Matrix Reloaded"" can do to stay ahead of its followers. *This film is a skillful sci-fi adventure, combining the usual elements: Heroes, villains, special effects and stunts, chases, explosions and romance.

****SPOILERS AHEAD****

THE PLOT

Neo (Keanu Reeves) and the rebel leaders estimate that they have 72 hours until 250,000 probes discover Zion and destroy it and its inhabitants. During this, Neo must decide how he can save Trinity (Carrie Ann-Moss) from a dark fate in his dreams.

Three great scenes in `The Matrix Reloaded' surpass ""The Matrix."" The first is when Neo is fighting one hundred Agent Smiths (Hugo Weaving) This scene is the most beautiful fight scene, I have ever seen in my life. Unlike most fight scenes, this one makes sense. Agent Smith tells Neo when he destroyed him, his body parts were scattered and became the Matrix. So now he can move in and out of any program in the Matrix.

The second comes when Morpheus returns to Zion and addresses an audience that looks like a mosh pit crossed with the underground slaves in ""Metropolis."" After his speech, the citizens dance to a wonderful soundtrack, which is shown with scenes of Neo and Trinity making love. Maybe those are there real bodies having sex, although I'm not sure.

*The third sensational sequence is a chase involving cars, motorcycles and trailer trucks, with beautiful choreographed moves including leaps into the air as a truck continues to move underneath. This scene is a 14 minute fun ride, although I might wonder, if such deadly enemies meet in one of these virtual spaces, who programmed it?

I recognize two philosophies in this movie. First, I feel that this is what might happen to humankind if they let technology develop unchecked. The second philosophy is that love and hope will conquer all.

The film ends with a ""To Be Concluded"" a reminder that the third film in the trilogy arrives in November. I loved this film and I recommend it to anyone. I give this film a 15 out of 10.

1465193,4,B00005JLTN,"I watched this film a few years after Matrix, so the connections came a bit rustily for me.  Nevertheless, Matrix Reloaded was viewable, even as a stand alone.  It offered plenty of action, a decent plot, some mind boggling notions to wrestle with, and the visual effects were interesting and stimulating.

For those, like me, who still think of Star Trek, when we consider science fiction, Matrix Reloaded is going to to have a ragged tempo--a little too much of an MTV feel.  Yet, it works.  I enjoyed the story and happenings, in spite of the film clearly being geared for a younger audience.  Furthermore, the fact that spirituality--even Calvinism--could be addressed in such a production is truly impressive.

Bottom-line:  If you can track with the drive of MTV-like music and tempo, and enjoy science fiction with heavy doses of philosophy and martial arts, this movie will prove a winner.  Watching Matrix first may help, but is not necessary to grasp the plot.",1093305600,4,970,4.901840490797546
1465194,2,B00005JLTN,"I guess marketing surveys convinced the directors that the best parts of the now legendary original were the fight sequences rather than the brilliant concept.  So, we get about 4 just in the first hour with logic out the window.  Starting in Zion which we assume is TOTALLY disconnected from the Matrix, agent programs, like all other programs that can only run IN the Matrix attack Neo.  Then a fight erupts as part of the screening process to see the Oracle whereas only a knock on the door was necessary in the first.  Then that Agent Smith who gave Neo so much trouble in the first film is replicated hundreds on times, yet gives Neo LESS trouble in this film.  Not that it mattered as Neo flies away superman style to conclude it,  causing one to wonder why he didn't just do that to begin with.

This film represents an utter betrayal of all the fans of the first film who had every right to expect something superior from these directors.  And after 4 years this is all they could come up with?

As I said, it opens in Zion where life has to be gruelling as Morpheus has gained about 40 pounds!  A meeting with a governing body has me thinking 'I'm in Star Wars!', expecting Luke and Leia to give subservient homage.  After a speech that one of LBJ's Vietnam peptalks would have outshone, a dance breaks out and 'I'm in 'Saturday Night Fever!'.

We have to deal with the Myrillingian (did Merrill Lynch back out of their financial committments?), as nauseating a character ever committed to film even if his wife is Monica Bellucci in order to get to the Key Master and I expect Rick Moranis and Sigorney Weaver to emerge!

The brilliant concept that was gradually opened up for us in the first film is nowhere to be found here.  What is left is a film that could only appeal to someone under 15, which I would guess WAS the intended target audience!",1091404800,3,1858,4.458579881656805

There are a lot of interesting scenes, but Neo aka up up and away, just brought a giggle out in me.  The LONG action sequences make you want to go okay, enough!  Less is More is NOT the banner of this movie! After Neo b**** slap's Elrond and his brother Elrond and his other brother Elrond 100 times it just redefines redundant.  Then Neo reaching in to pull out the magic bullet...oh, please...sigh...and the religious overtones are so pretensious.

1465229,3,B00005JLTN,"I absolutely loved the original Matrix. I still do. It got me thinking about things I'd never considered all that seriously, such as the potential negative implications of artificial intelligence and ultra-sophisticated technology. I was also drawn to the philosophical issues it raised, and I was motivated to learn more about the ideas presented in the story. For me, no other film has held such strong intellectual appeal. I've watched the DVD an embarrassing number of times. I've never grown tired of it.
When I learned that two more Matrix films were in the works, I was overjoyed. Unfortunately, my joy came to an abrupt halt when I saw Reloaded. I fully admit that my high expectations contributed to my disappointment, but that certainly doesn't account for all of it. Among other things, Reloaded is so top-heavy with bombast and claptrap that I actually stopped caring about the characters and had no further interest in what might happen. I definitely don't enjoy these kinds of feelings.
I wanted so much to like Reloaded that I actually saw it several times hoping I'd missed a crucial element, or that it would grow on me, or *something*. But it continued to leave such a bad taste in my mouth that I had no desire to see Revolutions.
As luck would have it, however, I recently had an opportunity to rent Revolutions for practically nothing -- so out of curiosity, I went for it. I'm glad I did, because it helped redeem the overall trilogy for me, although not as much as I would have liked. The only expectation I brought to Revolutions was that it couldn't possibly be worse than Reloaded. Luckily it isn't, but it still can't touch the original.
One of the other reviewers has mentioned that an indefinable ""something"" is missing from Revolutions. Well, I can identify at least three things that are absent from this film: a plot, convincing dialog, and decent acting (with one exception, which I'll get to momentarily). I also discovered that Revolutions essentially has no human stars, despite the presence of Reeves, Fishburne, Moss, et al. The only true stars of this film are its special effects.

Granted, the effects are spectacular. The battle for Zion is a feat of CGI splendor -- although I would have appreciated it more had it been shorter. It's almost like the Wachowskis are trying to compensate for the film's shortcomings by clobbering the audience with protracted high-tech eye candy.
I was relieved that there aren't many hand-to-hand (or should I say foot-to-head?) combat scenes in Revolutions. There are only so many ways to kick a bad guy in the face, and I got more than my fill of such things in Reloaded.
Of the fight sequences that *are* in Revolutions, I found the super-duper burly brawl between Smith and Neo -- in the rain, no less -- to be cartoonish and silly. It was almost as bad as the ""Trinity crashes through a window and repeatedly shoots at an agent while falling about a million stories toward the pavement"" sequence in Reloaded.
Revolutions also continued the nonsensical double-talk so prevalent in Reloaded. I'm sure it's meant to sound profound, but to me, it only sounds foolish. ""Why are you here?"" ""Because I choose to be."" ""What are you going to do?"" ""What I need to do."" ""What's going to happen?"" ""What's meant to happen."" (Where's a wall that I can smash my head into?) Both Reloaded and Revolutions perfected the art of answering questions without answering them.
And what's with all of the endless squabbling in Zion, which started in Reloaded and continues in Revolutions? You'd think that people who have so much at stake would learn to work together more harmoniously and effectively. Instead, they engage sniping, whining, cursing, yelling, tantrums, petty jealousies, and head-butting. This became so tedious that I stopped caring whether or not Zion and its residents would survive.
Be that as it may, I consider Revolutions to be a worthy diversion if taken at face value. Any meaningful philosophical underpinnings vanished for me after the original Matrix. I approached Revolutions with the intent of trying not to think too much and just going wherever it wanted to take me. On that level, I feel it succeeds.

The one character I thoroughly enjoyed throughout all three films is Agent Smith. In Revolutions, I love the way Hugo Weaving pulls out all the stops and chews the scenery with such diabolical glee. In contrast, the other characters are merely boring. In some places, they're boring and irritating.
As other reviewers have noted, Revolutions ends in a way that leaves a back door open for a fourth Matrix film. Well, I have something to say to the Brothers Wachowski about that, starting with some hokey dialog that they, themselves wrote: ""Everything that has a beginning has an end."" (Naaah...really?) For me, the Matrix ended after the first film. That's where it should have stopped. Please don't make it worse by grinding out a fourth installment. Let it end now.
Meanwhile, since ""cookies need love like everything else does,"" I'll be doing my part. I love cookies.",1088726400,3,5063,4.879210220673635
1465230,3,B00005JLTN,"It's almost a rule of thumb that a sequel is not as good as the original.  There are of course exceptions to this--although I disagree with the vast majority of reviewers, and do *not* find ""Godfather II"" to be a superior film to the original, or indeed even *as* good, but that's an article for another time--but in the main, it holds true.  Even for tripe like ""George of the Jungle"" and ""Inspector Gadget,"" the drop-off is usually noticible.
And so it is with ""The Matrix Reloaded,"" alas.  There are interesting ideas in this film, and good connective tissue between it and the first movie, but in the main, I have to say it bored me.  To say the film moves in fits and starts doesn't begin to state the case.  I was actually stunned by the alternation of long, expository scenes where one character (or much more rarely, two) sounds off at length about the nature of reality, the validity of the matrix, and the whichness of what.  Characters sit and talk (lecture is probably the more accurate term.)  Characters stand and talk.  Characters talk talk talk.  Then there's hyperkinetic action.  Somehow, one hopes that these two extremes would be better melded, but one hopes in vain in this particular film.
These scenes alternate with equally lengthy action sequences, some of which are enjoyable, but others of which were, honestly, for me pretty dull.  The fight sequence on the freeway, which got huge amounts of press, was for me stultifyingly boring.  After 5 minutes (it goes on for nearly 20!), I was looking at my watch.  It wasn't that the stunts were bad; it's just that the plot didn't *move at all* while we're watching this lengthy monument to action sequences.  And while I honestly enjoyed another sequence with Neo in the palace of a character called the Merovingian, even *that* one went on too long.  Honestly, the whipsawing of the movie between ""nothin' but lecturing"" and ""nothin' but fightin'"" got old for me.
I gave this movie 3 stars primarily because, as disappointing as it is, it is still vastly superior to most of the science fiction/action film crud that comes flooding out of Hollywood every year.  Compare this film to, say, ""Eraser,"" or ""The Punisher,"" and it rises by at least one star in the rankings.",1088553600,11,2241,4.722365038560412

Reloaded helped me to understand the history and the plot of the movie alot more by explaining in detail where and how Neo got his powers and why Morpheus believe that Neo is the One. Not to mention the action in this movie was superb. The whole Matrix Trilogy was exttraordinary to a point where it made you question reality itself like what is the real definition of what is real. It may you say to your self what if this movie is not that far from the truth, what if our minds really did digitially create this world of luxury for us to live in, this illusion, but in the real world is nothing more than a nightmarish wasteland that we created due to years of conflict, pollution, corruption, and ignorance. A world created to control the minds of the inferior by the superior to get them to believe what they believe, hmh definitely sounds familiar. But this movie has plenty of action, enigmatic question and a whole bible of philosophy that will make Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle question there way of logic and thinking.

1465234,4,B00005JLTN,"Before I went to see this in the theatre I read some reviews, which expressed disappointment after the excellence of The Matrix. On top of that, admirers of The Matrix were fed a giant wad of media hype about the two sequels. (I believe a car manufacturer even named a so-called new model the Matrix, which just seemed to be too coincidental with the opening of the movie to be a coincidence.)
 I will admit that upon seeing Matrix Reloaded in the theatre I was influenced somewhat by all the hype and relatively disappointed reviews. Visually, it was magnificent on the big screen; but it seemed that there were no characters (not even the core trio) that invited me to be emotionally involved in the story. So, I left the theatre mildly disappointed. I don't think I let myself be as entertained by Reloaded as I should have. In retrospect, I let the hype and critical disappointment expressed in the media influence me too much.
 I didn't buy Reloaded on DVD until after Revolutions was released on DVD; so, I had a few months to get over the hype and just watch it. It really is a terrific action picture, and has all the quasi-philosophical stuff that made The Matrix so fun. It takes the computer-based constructs of the first movie, and fills them out in a satisfying and evocative way. It loses one star, because it introduces new characters without really fleshing them out in a way that would be satisfying even for an action movie. All the CGI bravura and action in the movie needs more emotional grounding than the story provides. As a general rule, the more special effects a movie has, the more emotional grounding the story needs to give the audience.

Pay no attention to the nay-sayers.  This film is lots of fun.  I enjoyed the pseudo-philosophical speechifying on the nature of reality between spectacular CGI-loaded [scenes].

Cast:  Keanu Reeves, Laurence Fishburne, Carrie-Anne Moss, Jada Pinkett.
Running Time:  132 minutes.
Rated R for violence, language, and mild sexual situations.
When ""The Matrix"" hit the big screen in 1999, it was the most innovative special effects triumph Hollywood had ever produced.  With the sequel, ""The Matrix Reloaded"", the Wachowski brothers have actually succeeded in making a second film in the series that is just as exciting, equally as thought-provoking, and perhaps possessing even better special effects.  Can anyone say ""The Empire Strikes Back""?
""The Matrix Reloaded"" takes the audience through a roller-coaster ride from the last-standing city of civilization in Zion to the Matrix, which is a computerized database consisting of humans who are programmed to fuel its very existence.  As the Matrix strives to become more powerful and absolutely take over Earth, Zion attempts to stage war against the evil technological machine empire, using the messiah-like Neo (Reeves) as their catalyst.  What ensues is a spectacle of rip-roaring sequences of more kung-fu fighting than a Bruce Lee movie, a twelve-minute highway chase scene that perhaps may be the best action scene ever produced, and several superb battles between Neo and the evil Mr. Smith.
There a few portions of the narrative that seem to be illegitimate, such as the possible love story between Morpheus (Fishburne) and a previous interest played by Jada Pinkett's character, as well as the overused metaphor of love, specifically between Neo and Trinity (played by Moss).  While ""Reloaded"" does not suffer from these developed themes, they seem to provide a symbolism that the Wachowski brothers are trying to convey, but they are so wrapped up in showing off their CCI effects that they are lost for exactly what they want to show the audience.  What made the original ""Matrix"" so captivating was the expectance of the unexpected, while what makes ""Reloaded"" so enjoyable is that we get what we expect, and it is thrown at us like an asteroid colliding with earth.",1085097600,,2090,5.236526946107785

The thought puzzles surrounding ""choice"" and ""free will"" are still good for a ponder, even if they haven't been as nicely integrated as the philosphy in the original. It also helps to have seen The Matrix Revolutions, which should really be viewed as one combined film with Reloaded.
Normally I give DVDs another star if the extras add value to the overall package, but there's not that much extra stuff here.

Of course it had to follow up to one of the greatest films of our time, but essentially it is a good film if you go into the theatre (or wherever you might watch it) with not huge expectations like I did. The Matrix Reloaded is the continuing story of Neo and Co. coming back to once again try and defeat the machine world and save Zion. With Neo, now knowing his full potential, it shouldn't be much of a problem defeating the machines and saving Zion. This is part  of the trilogy of the Matrix and a highly suggest watching the first one before touching this one.
Anyways this movie has some great action sequences. There's actually a whole scene on the highway (which was a hgihway made specifically for this movie). The action is alot more intense then the first one, kind of like how LOTR: the fellowship had alot less action then LOTR: The Two Towers. In the movie you'll see some character devolpment, but not much has changed between the characters. Neo and Trinity become as intimate as they've ever been with a whole scene dedicated to, them (a very much unnessecary scene). You meet Niobe a commander of a completely diffrent ship (sorry I forgot the name of the ship) and you find out that she and Morpheus had previous relations (not to mention that she is going out with Mopheus's boss). All in all, not much character development is done. Keanu Reeves is still dull at times (you know those dumb questions he asks with absolutley no life ""what happens if i fail"" ""what if im not the one"".)
This movie is, in my oppinion a great follow up to an already amazing movie. While The Matrix is a classic, The Matrix Reloaded will be known as the movie that not only built on ""The Matrix"" but made the series' alot more intresting. Overall a definite rent, and a possible buy.",1084233600,,1855,4.455882352941177

I thought after the fist Matrix film in '99  that it was a good chane that the Wachowski Brothers could breathe new life in the SCI-FI genre.  Then Matrix Unloaded came out and I was wrong.  The First film witch actually made sense.  Had a good storyline Keanu Reeves didn't speak much. Hence he had very little dialogue SFX that was not overdone.  The violence a little overdone but still tastefull.  Carrie-Anne Moss had very little dialogue also.  Laurence Fishburne's character was totally on point.  Then comes UNLOADED.  Keanu Reeves and Carrie-Anne Moss are given way to much monologue (Note to Wachowski Bros. the difference between monologue and dialogue) they are not really good actors but you could look past that fact in the first one because the storyline was actually thought provoking.  (...).  And Morpehus has this stupid out of character speech.  And why the heck dose Zion look like crap you spend 100's of millions to produce this sequal and Zion looks like it was filmed in a sewer a la Teenage Muntant Ninja Turtles.  I'm also so sick of the Matrix Unloaded apologist saying you haven't seen it enough or you just don't understand Anime, or New Age Mysticism.  I say your full of bull.  First lets get one thing striaght which is 99.5% of Anime is GARBAGE!  (...)  Also Anime is a animation syle much like the Steamboat Willie and Felix the cat and Oswald the Rabbit look of the 1920's and early 30's in the US.  (...)  Second I don't care what you say about the religous influence the philosophy of Unloaded just dose not make sense whatsover.  What was the point of the new characters?  Jada had only eight or nine lines.  And what's up with that sex scene its got to be one of the most disgusting sex scenes of all time holes and all.  Also way to much CGI.  Which is ironic sense that the computers use the humans as energy. So know the Wachowski Bros. are relying on CGI to do all the work instead of writing an interesting storyline.  And Joel Silver had the nerve to talk about George Lucas.  At least Lucas had enough sense to wait in between years to fix storyline problems i.e. toning down Jar Jar, and recover in Episode 2.

1465336,2,B00005JLTN,"Alright, let me just get this out of the way first: There were two good thing about this movie, the special effects and the fight scenes.
Now back to reality. I loved the first movie of this trilogy, and Reloded ruined it for me. This movie digs way too deep into personal lives and gets too philosophical for a high-tech action movie. There are things like an insanely long sex scene, and family arguments that just ruin the coolness of the movie. The movie is no longer about getting the bad guys while wearing long, black trenchcoats chalk-full of machine guns. Instead, its about Zion (the only city left on Earth that hasn't been corrupted by the Matrix) and the emotional issues of the people living in it. And don't forget the way overplayed romance between Neo and Trinity. Now don't get me wrong, I don't mind a love story in an action movie, but it should not be the focus. Essentially, Reloaded gets way off track from what the viewer wants: to see those bloody computers get their butts kicked. I am not even going to see Revolutions, the last in the trilogy, because I've heard it's even worse.
I only have one thing left to do before I'm done with the Matrix series completely: Watch the first one again, so I can remember it as it deserves to be remembered, not the way I think about Reloaded.",1083369600,,1308,4.476987447698745
1465337,2,B00005JLTN,"The original ""Matrix"" effectively combined stylistic action with philosophy and spirituality, and although it resorted to action-film formula more than a few times, it remains an impressive effort. Naturally, expectations were high for the two sequels, filmed simultaneously at large expense. Would the first sequel, ""Matrix Reloaded,"" expound upon the impressive premise established in the first film?
To be blunt: I can see why the word ""load"" is in the title.
This murky, confusing sequel undermines nearly everything established in the first film. Gone are the subtle references to Zen Buddhism and Gnostic Christianity that gave the series broad appeal. Instead, we're treated to vague euphemisms for--and references to--free will and choice. The Wachowskis abandoned the more philosophical bent of the original in favor of more action, and that ends up making this film nearly unwatchable. The non-action segments are stupefyingly dull, featuring wretched dialogue that is uncomfortably similar to the ""Star Wars"" prequels, and inane plot development that is merely a sideshow to all the action. Some parts are truly bad: The ""rave orgy"" near the beginning of the movie may be the worst segment in any of the three films, accompanied by perhaps the most unsexy sex scene in recent memory. There's no passion in Neo and Trinity's lovemaking, and the same could be said for the Wachowski's script and direction: Apart from the action segments the movie slows to an utter, stultifying crawl. It's a labor to watch. The one exception is when Neo meets the Architect, and discovers what may be some unsettling truths about the Matrix and the nature of reality. There's more plot development and intrigue packed into the Architect's few minutes of dialogue than in the rest of the film combined.
Not that all of the film was bad, however. While the film fails to deliver the goods where plot, dialogue, and characterization are concerned, it does offer some excellent action sequences. Three in particular stand out: Neo vs. the Merovingian's men, the dynamic highway chase, and Neo vs. multiple (and I do mean MULTIPLE) Agent Smiths in what has become known as ""the Burly Brawl."" The highway chase is an exciting twelve minute set piece full of dizzying action and unbelievable stunts and effects, all delivered in a nearly flawless manner. The ""burly brawl,"" perhaps the best-know segment from Reloaded, is sensational, with Neo duking it out in dynamic fashion with the rogue Smith and his innumerable duplicates. The famous ""wire-fu"" effects are used to great results here; Neo and Smith defy gravity and physical laws in an impressive battle. But those scenes are merely small punctuations in the overall dullness of this film. Ultimately, ""Reloaded"" is done in by its own pretentiousness and total lack of subtext. Fortunately, the third film would bring some of the energy and subtle mysticism back to the series. But it cannot make up for the gargantuan misstep that ""Reloaded"" comprises.",1083283200,13,2996,5.179381443298969

All the business with the ""architect"" was perfectly satirized by Will Ferrrel on some awards show - he just kept yelling ""vis-a-vis"" and ""ergo"" over and over again.

1465390,4,B00005JLTN,"Many of you were very dissapointed in the 2nd instalment in the Matrix trilogy.  I was also in that group, until I watched it again.  After seeing it the second time, I began to really understand and appreciate it.  Other than the discusting sex scene there is really nothing wrong with this movie.
Matrix Reloaded mainly focuses on Zion which was mentioned a few times in the first Matrix.  In this movie we really get to see what Zion is.  Zion is the last human city on earth.  It is far below ground where the machines can't get...until now.  We see that there are many ships besides Morpheus's Nebucunezzer and they all have the same goal in mind....free as many minds from the Matrix as they can and also end the war between humans and the machines.  Morpheus believes that Neo is the one that will end the war, but many others in Zion do not share his beliefs.  After talking to the oracle again, Neo figures out that the oracle is just another computer program and now questions whether or not the oracle is there to help him or destroy him.  In the meantime Agent Smith, whom Neo seemed to have destoyed in the original Matrix is back.  It seems that Neo did not destory Smith, instead he freed Smith from the Matrix and now Smith is no longer ""working"" for the Matrix.  To top this off, Smith has discovered a way to copy himself so their are many agent Smiths looking to destory Neo.  The ending of this movie is a cliff hanger and leaves us with more questions than answers.
This movie though not as good as the first, is a nessecary installment in the trilogy.  We see the ultimate goal of the human race and it does not focus on Neo as much as the original one did.  The fight scenes are still done very well, though there was one unessacary fighting scence.  Hugo Weaving does a phenomonal job portraying agent Smith.  In a couple of places the acting is a bit corny however overall, the acting is done very well.
When I first saw this movie, I did not like it very much, but after watching it again, I really enjoyed it, and really see nothing wrong with the movie.  The only thing I absolutely hated about the movie was the sex scence, which was pretty discusting and drawn out entirely too long.  This scene served no purpose in the movie, so a simple scene of Trinity and Neo kissing then a fade out would have been sufficient.  Other than that this was a great movie and a good lead into the final movie.",1081987200,4,2424,4.356347438752784

The car chase was so spectacular that I couldn't even imagine how it was accomplished...luckily, the follow up on the second disk showed how the special effects were brought to life.  Not since Star Wars have I been so thoroughly entranced by a movie...and I'm not trying to compare the two trilogies because the Matrix is much, much, much better than Star Wars ever was!  If you loved the first installment of The Matrix, then you'll be compelled to see Reloaded.  Remember, too, that Reloaded was filmed along with the 3rd movie, Revolutions.

1465394,5,B00005JLTN,"I know I'm not with the majority in saying this, but I truly think that this movie was much, much better than the first. This isn't a case of a fanboy trying to convince himself because he's desperate to like the sequel, I already tried that with the Matrix Revolutions and failed (the third and final part of this trilogy is truly a bad movie in almost every sense).
I went into this movie expecting expensive special effects and not much story.  The key to the success of the first movie was that it had a simple story, I was simply hoping that Reloaded would come close to achieving the same thing.  What I got was way beyond expectations.
In the first ten minutes of this movie, I had the same misgivings that I think everyone else did. However, I seem to have gotten over them much faster than everyone else. Yes, the old insular, gritty nature of the first movie, the small group against impossible odds, is gone.  I missed this at first, but then I realised that the Wachowskis had set out to tell a much bigger story, and this needs to happen on a much bigger stage.
The movie is somewhat unbalanced. The first half-hour is set within the underground city of Zion, which isn't as impressive as it should have been, and it contains Morpheus' speech to the masses, which is far less impressive than it should have been.  But I didn't find the rave/sex scene to be anywhere near as dull as others did.  It serves a valuable purpose within the framework of the movie.
Once the Zion section is over, though, the movie never lets up.  The fights are more impressive, the story is incredible, and the special effects are amazing. And for once, over-the-top special effects actually aid the flow of the movie, rather than distract from it. It is the slickest, coolest movie I've ever seen.  It isn't Citizen Kane, but it is so cool that it outshines anything else that came out in 2003.
The DVD also sports a few neat documentaries that, unlike the documentaries on the original Matrix DVD, don't ruin the movie, they show you just how much effort was put into making it (the documentaries on the first DVD show how dull the fights were to film, and how slowly they were done, which takes all the fun out of them).
But really, when you buy this DVD, you buy it for the movie.  And in this case, it'd be worth the price even if there were no extras at all.",1081555200,,2355,4.410138248847926

To Be Honest Some Of The Scenes Really Could Be Tedious. Most Noticeably The Dialogue Sessions. Some Were Vital I Admit, Like The Architect's Session. Some Weren't Really Vital, Such As When Counsillor Hamman Was Talking To Neo About Control. I Enjoyed The Action Sequences Very Much. I Had A Knack For The Burly Brawl (All The Smiths Attacking Neo In The Park Or Wherever), Though The Effects Were Obviously Computers (The Effects Supervisors Said They Couldn't Do That Sequence With Just Wirework And Stuff. I Do Not Blame Them.). The Highway Chase Scene Is Awesome, Especially At The End With The Truck Sequence.
I Have To Say That Though This Movie Is A Nice Touch On The Matrix Phenomenon, It Isn't As Groundbreaking As The Original. A Lot Of People Complained About This, But I Am Perfectly Comfortable With It. Either Way, Everyone Has Their Own Opinion.

The acting is stilted (Are we supposed to care for any of these characters? The performances in ""Star Wars Episode II"" were better, compared to this). Fishburne's, Zion speech is a howler (he looks gross with his shirt off) and the dance afterwards is embarassing to watch. Jada Pinkett Smith has enough black attitude to power ""Bad Boys III"" without having Will Smith or Martin Lawerence showing up. Keanu Reeves continues to strive to be the world's suckiest actor. The highway chase went on far too long (how many times does Morpheius need to hang off the side of the truck...lame!). The Keymaster in ""Ghostbusters"" is a lot better than the one here.

It though i thought was unnecessarily long for the fact that its dragged into a 2-part chapter (or whatever).  I actually thought that the Starwars series (4, 5 & 6) were better cuz the fact they always showed u something worthwhile. But of course now thats hollywood's idea of making money. However though the actual plot of this first half was still very good, i had to admit after seeing this movie for a 2nd time i was infact more pleased. Maybe because i understood more or the fact that its on dvd & i can scan through diff areas on which i thought were boring parts (the celebration which isn't the only part). I did though watch it all the way, but still dint need a whole lot of scenes.. well at least to some people they got thier money's worth.

I will start with the good.  The visuals were stunning as before.  They created some interesting new characters:  the sentient programs, though I found for the most part, poorly acted, were an interesting idea, the upgraded agents, the new replicating agent smith, and SOME of the members of ZION.  There were some good action sequences, the burly fight was pointless as you can get but entertaining, the car and bike chase sequence was nothing short of heart stopping, and I liked Trinity's invasion of the power plant.
That sums it up for the good.
The bad:  Zion was wasted, aside from a few characters it just wasn't that interesting.  The speech Morpheus gave before the rave just wasn't that well written, and the rave was stupid.  The fight sequences weren't as well done as they were in the first movie.  They lacked the interesting group of protagonists, no Cypher, no Mouse, no Tank or Dozer.  I understand they were either dead or estranged from the producers, but they could have replaced them with some better ones than they had.  Jada Pinket Smith looked cool, but was ultimately wasted.  The keymaster was a good concept but played out really dull.  The movie had a feel that it wasn't really cohesive, like it was a collection of sequences or images rather than a movie.
All in all it wasn't a bad movie.  But it wasn't great.  it wasn't something you want to watch over and over again, or if you did you hit the forward on the dvd player to skip over the many slow or ineffective parts.
Maybe the Wachowski's should have filmed this, then taken another five years to do the next one.  Because it felt a bit rushed, and the final was obviously rushed and horribly thought out.

1465418,5,B00005JLTN,"In all fairness, I too was disappointed in this film the first time I saw it.  The opening seemed to drag on and on.  It seemed overblown, overbudgeted, and far from what the Matrix series was originally intended to be.
However, after I watched it again (and many more times since), this is the one installment of the trilogy that always mesmerizes me.  Sure it's more of a standard sci-fi action movie than the original Matrix, but despite this feel, it is actually far more complex and intelligent than the original Matrix ever was.  (or than Revolutions could possibly have been, since it was essentially just a long ""final battle"" sequence)
The level of philosophical symbolism is incredible in this film.  From the obvious continuation of symbolic names (Soren, the Logos, etc...) to the more powerful concepts that the film offers about Sci-Fi, action epics, and human nature itself.  Pay close attention to the first half of the film.  Find the places in which it appears to reference Star Wars, Star Trek, and Religious Epics, and other films in history.  Pay attention to where these echoes of past films are inserted and what they mean.
For example, Morpheus' overblown preaching in the cave.  Do you let it simply irritate you?  Or do you examine why the filmmaker's chose to turn Morpheus into an apocalyptic preacher?
Or another example, what does it mean that almost every human in a position of power in the film turns out to be some form of religious extremist?  From Morpheus' messianic rantings to the anti-religious rationality of Zion's Military Commander.  And how are we to interpret the fact that in the end every one of them is wrong...
I won't answer those questions.  As the cliche goes, art means whatever it means to you.  This film is so open and so intellectual that it can make you think about truly profound religious issues.  If you're willing to give it that level of thought.
On repeated viewing, this is one of the most challenging Hollywood films in recent memory.  Despite its many flaws, the intellectual depth of this film keeps it far above most films that have been released in the past 10 years.
The power of the Matrix series was never in its ability to entertain.  Its most important feature was always its ability to make us think, and in that regard, the Matrix sequels succeed spectacularly.",1079740800,54,2339,4.778606965174129

Reloaded was a flop, yes.  The whole plot only grew at the last half and hour, and it really grew big.  The first hour was verrry lengthy, and I really doubt any philosophical insights took place during the first half.  The CGIs were bad, that much I can tell.  The first matrix did not dwell in technologies humans have not fully conquered.  but the cgi's in reloaded sucked, big time.  If you can literally tell, when Neo is fake, that's pretty bad, especially for such an expensive costing movie like this.  Overall, it was ok, because reloaded and revolutions are actually one big movie split into two, so it's understandable why the plot on this one came only later.  And what's with the sex scene? and the girl eating the cake?  that was out of context, man.  come on, you can do better than that, can you wachowski bros? u didn't need the geeky sex scene at all. we all know those 2 were in love and making love.  and what's with the rave? we're going to war, so lets party? reloaded was, undeniably a dissapointment.  contrary to popular opinions, i don't think revolutions was bad at all.  yes, it still was far than the first one, but it was ok.  the plot was evened out, and no crappy scenes, and less crappy CGIs.

1465537,5,B00005JLTN,"""Either you get this film or you don't,"" was the common expression heard during the spring of 2003, and it couldn't be more untrue. The Wachowski Brothers have crafted a science fiction trilogy that far surpasses any of its modern-day counterparts (i.e., Star Wars, The Lord of the Rings).
The Matrix Trilogy, as a whole, asks fundamental human questions: ""Why are we here, and do we have any control over our lives?""; ""Are we completely beholden to the technology we've created?"" Like a true Zen proposition, and unlike most Hollywood created epic stories, the series mostly doles out the answers in the form of more questions.
Neo continues his journey from the tail end of the ""The Matrix"", freeing as many minds as possible, but he soon learns that this is not enough. The machines have sent an army to attack Zion, digging from the planet's surface directly into the rebel's home. The crew of the Nebuchadnezzar and others only have 72 hours to try and stop the onslaught.  And Neo discovers along the way that whatever super-abilities he may have been blessed with as ""The One"" are directly superceded by what the audience finds out ""The One"" actually is.
This film, in ten years time, will be hailed by professional critcs the same as Stanley Kubrick's initally misunderstood masterpiece, ""2001:  A Space Odyssey"", was rightfully regaled a decade after its release.",1076198400,,1372,4.9094827586206895

For some reason The Matrix Reloaded DVD needs two discs for fewer features.  What I particularly miss is the commentary track.  Where is this?  Also, the white rabbit mode in the first Matrix DVD was a neat idea, but they chose to not do any of this for Reloaded.
The above mentioned gripe aside, I thought the audio and visual encoding on the disc was excellent.  The movie itself, I thought was about as good as anybody could expect given the high expectations.  Of course, after seeing the third movie, I feel that Reloaded wasn't as good as I'd originally thought (some things that were overly complicated in Reloaded would have been fine had they resolved them in Revolutions, but they did not), but I guess I shouldn't factor that into my review.
If you are a Matrix fan, get this DVD... or perhaps hold out and maybe they will release a special addition which will have the extra features I want (that will really make me mad).",1076112000,,1107,4.4504950495049505
1465540,1,B00005JLTN,"I am not writing about the DVD because no one here did.  I am writing about the version I watched in theatres.
---MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS---
When I first heard that The Matrix would become a trilogy I said, ""well, it's couldn't be THAT bad..."".  Man oh man, was I wrong...
Obviously, criticism is purely based on matter of fact unless one is paied to do so.  Then it's matter of observation.
I BELIEVE this to be the single worst film in the history of movies, which makes The Matrix: Revolutions the second worst (yes, I have watched the third one).  I have watched both (second and third) because, otherwise, I would not allow myself to criticise them.
The cgi in movies, up to date, is still crawling toward the DECENT level.  I have never watched a film's cgi that looked appropriate.  In order for cgi to be good it must not be noticible.  The audience must ask, 'how did they do that?!'  When it's noticible, the director did a bad job.  It's very simple.
And, clearly, the Watchowski Brothers are the best example of that, and of money being thrown into a turbine.  Why not invest it all in the stock market?
The story is missing in this film, unlike the first one.  That is because it contradicts itself.  Watch the film a second time and listen to the Architect's speaches.  He contradicts everything spoken so far, in the first and second films, and makes fun of the audience in the manner that everything that made sense (and what made fans want to see this film) not longer is needed.  If Neo needed to do something, forget it.  He now needs to do something completly different, and leaning toward another pathetic attempt at a plot point (plot sucks; stories are what makes movies, and plots can not exist without stories).  If he needed to speak to someone, that someone does not know enough.  The next person doesn't enough either.  Etcetera, etcetera...
One too many new charaters were pointlessly inserted into this film.
Who are the Albino Rastafarians and what is their purpose?  And if they're important, why are they destroyed after twenty minutes?
What's so special about the Key Master if he's got a boss Neo can talk to?
Why does Neo swing his arms and create ripples in order to fly?
Why is Neo no longer powerful and Morpheus, who is pointless in this film, is more powerful than The Agents?
Why is Trinity a vigelante?  Where's the team work?  And what about helping Neo?
Why does Zion look like a cruddy, steel encrusted, stench of a hole in the ground?
Why are the machines using human being's body heat for power when they can build power plants just like the humans did, only better?
Why is it that Neo can stop bullets but not people?  Are all his enemies avatars?  No.  Sorry, that point is explained.
That is only a small fraction of the questions that I have in mind, and that is after viewing the entire triogy.
Also, any philosophical notions mentioned are nothing more than figments of philosopical ideals, strictly taken from a Philosophy 101 textbook.  If one needs to know why The Matrix is the essence of Buddhism and the real world is the essence of Christianity, please look it up.  It is a very serious mistake that The Brothers made.  They provide you with what you need to ask the internet.
Also, after reading up on the Gedel Theorum (yes, I read up for the last film), I understood certain notions are ideals.  I also managed to predict the outcome of the third film's purpose, and its charaters' meanings and purposes.
All of that was done four months before I had viewed The Matrix: Revolutions.
Two final questions: Why is the second film titled Reloaded?  what is being reloaded?  Certainly not the guns...  They never have.
And the second question is, why is the third film titled Revolutions?  There aren't any.  The humans do not revolt, the machines do; but The Brothers take over the side of the humans...
Why is that?  Especially since it's a lose-lose situation...
The humans have 250,000 civilians and the machines send 250,000 units (they have hundreds of millions more back at the machine city).  Basically it's a slaughter of the human race, except to those who hide very well.
When Neo realises that he and Smith exist because they are opposits, that explains why they are attarcted to each other.  But it doesn't explain why they need to fight.  Especially since Neo explains that if one of them is alive, the other can not die.  Therefore Neo sacrifices himself and that destroys Smith as well.  But...  1)If they were doomed from the beginning, why should we watch the third film?  The Watchowskies made fun of us all by milking our money.  We paid to see a battle that ends in favour of both sides losing because, otherwise, they would both be alive forever and battle eachother forever.  See?  LOSE-LOSE.  They both die or they fight each other forever to no avail.
2) Smith, by the end of the third film, has the entire world (within the Matrix) clones of himself.  They are all as powerful as the next, except the original one.  But when Smith dies, just after Neo, all the Smiths are destroyed.
NEWSFLASH: All the human beings bread by the machines in the machine city are hooked up to the Matrix; it is their life support.  This Smith does not borrow the human's bodies, he turns them all to clones of himself.  So Neo destroyed all the hukan is the machine city and everyone inside the Matrix.  WHY?  Who's left?  Morpheus, Niobi, and twenty other?  WHY ARE THEY LEFT TO SUFFER FOR EVERYONE WHOSE DEAD?
3) Why did Trinity have to die?  You know what?  Here's a better question; I know that The Brothers like philosophy, so: when Trinity is impaled and is dying, Neo says ""You can't die..."" and she respond with the slap-in-the-face remark of ""Oh, yeah?  Watch me.""  And then she dies.
WHY?!!!
Basically, I really detest the way the Watchoskies have ended this monstrocity of a trilogy, I hate the way they wasted their money (and you can't say they didn't because the acting sucked and the effects were horrible), and that they entirely adapted it all from many other movies and anime titles.
P.S.
These three films are made up from the stories and sequences of the following: The Terminator, Virtuosity, Strange Days, X (an anime series that I love), Dragonball Z (another anime series, but one that I hate), Neon Genesis Evangelion (another very good anime series), and there are a few more that have currently slipped my mind.  If anyone else remembers any other films or anime that I have forgotten to mention, please feel free to add them to this list.
Thank you.

I thought some of the key action sequences, in terms of spectacle and action were outstanding. Where the scenes fall flat as does most of the movie is in the drama and emotion. What lifted the first film from being just a standard action movie were the themes of truth and love. The filmmakers in the second installment barried the story with philosophy and removed anything human or emotional from it. Even the relationship between neo and Trinity seems forced and trite. Above all I did not get a feeling of urgency or danger. With all the spectaclar stunts and action happening I never felt that the main characters were in danger.

Still, the Wachowski brothers did a fabulous job with the 'Burly Brawl' scene and I loved meeting other programs in the Matrix, they were just like really wealthy, snooty people that you really wanted to take down a peg or two.

It was like watching a parody, a serious one. On top of these reactions, I am shocked by the amount of people who liked it. Are they under a spell, I sometimes ask myself? Is it an ""Emperor's New Clothes"" type situation where no one wants to badmouth the filmmakers because of their love of the first ""Matrix?"" I may never know the answer to these questions.
What I do know is ""Matrix Reloaded"" has an astonishing number of cheeseball lines, usually in the form of opponents threatening one another, before, during, and after fights. These fights are followed by more cheesy commentary. Perhaps this is where the film does excel: by reaching unknown heights of corniness and grimace-worthy comeback lines. With Morpheus's disastrously out-of-character speech to the masses of Zion in mind, combined with every other moment of dialogue in the film, I am currently of the opinion that writing could be the explanation, ""The Source"", if you will, of the creamy chedder center that is ""Matrix Reloaded."" Still, I am mystified.
Now, alongside any other possibly disenchanted ""Matrix"" fans, I am faced with the heavy task of attempting to block out memories of this monstrousity and return to the beautiful life I had before viewing the sequel, a place where the first Matrix, a fine quality film, reigns alone. It will be a long, and perilous journey to that place.",1075248000,6,1682,4.783505154639175
1465588,4,B00005JLTN,"1999's ""The Matrix"" was and still remains one of the greatest groundbreaking science fiction movies that came out in a very long time in my opinion.
 The second part of the three part Matrix trilogy ""The Matrix Reloaded"" brilliantly follows up on the original even though it can go overboard in places and even speed on very bumpy roads from time to time. This movie feels a lot different from the original, being a lot darker and having a very `green' tint to much of the movie but perhaps it's due to the cover art and the theatrical posters during the movie's release. This is in my opinion, one of 2003's best movies.
 In the case of ""Reloaded"" Neo begins to realize that he has only 3 days to rally up the remaining human population and defend Zion, their last refuge from being taken over by renegade machines being controlled by a renegade program called Agent Smith who has the ability to replicate himself and spread his power all over the Matrix. Time is running out and Neo has only 3 days to save the remainder of humanity from falling prey to the intelligent machines that are run by the replicating renegade program Agent Smith. Accoring to the philosophy, Neo is in fact, Agent Smith's equal that is the `one' who can save humanity from a fate worse than death. For some older audiences, this movie may come close to being something that came from ""The Terminator"" movie series and yes, I can see a lot of similarities between Matrix and Terminator in terms of man versus machine.
 This movie is a really excellent follow-up to the 1999 original Matrix movie but there are some areas where it can get a bit out of hand. While many movies seem to suffer from a lack of a good plot or one that never takes off at all, ""The Matrix Reloaded"" is the opposite where the plot goes way over the top and jumps too much between stories and goes all over the place without allowing some time to rest. In some ways, I feel that ""Reloaded"" has been rendered almost obsolete because it ends with a cliffhanger note almost abruptly and ""Revolutions"" is where the real fun begins. That doesn't mean that ""Reloaded"" is no longer necessary but I feel that they could easily have made ""Reloaded"" and ""Revolutions"" into one four hour movie and the final two movies in the Matrix series created more questions than answered others. The one thing that I felt was completely unnecessary was a scene between Neo and Trinity. While I am not bothered that much by such material, I felt the lovemaking scene just cluttered up the film. Sorry, no offense but I felt it cluttered up the film.
 I know that Keanu Reeves as Neo is the foreground character and he does great in playing Neo but Hugo Weaving who gave us Elrond from Lord of The Rings, steals the spotlight away from everyone else in this film. Upon seeing the scary and unsettling character Agent Smith, I have to say that Weaving can play some REALLY scary bad guys and is totally awesome and engaging in this movie. I could almost forget about everyone else in the movie's cast because Hugo Weaving as Agent Smith is one of the most awesome characters in this movie despite the fact that he's the arch villain.
 The second disc though is a real treat. You can see a lot of footage of how several of the various scenes are created and see the behind the scenes footage of the epic highway chase scenes. You won't believe how they made the highway chase scene. I'm not going to tell you how they did but you will be amazed at how they did it. I was like ""WOW!"" when I watched the part of filming the epic highway battle scenes. It's absolutely amazing! Then you got a lot of interviews with the actors and seeing how they filmed a lot of the various acting sequences, typical of most DVDs but the ""Matrix Reloaded"" DVD is definitely one to check out just for disc two.
 The special effects are absolutely amazing and groundbreaking, even by a lot of today's standards. The various martial combat, fight scenes and chase scenes are incredibly choreographed and tons and tons of fun to watch. I'll admit, the CGI effects can start to get out of hand in some places but for the most part, the visuals are just amazing to watch! I haven't seen special effects that actually were efficiently done so well since Bruce Willis' ""The Fifth Element"" from seamingly entire lifetimes ago.
 This movie is no masterpiece by any means, nor surpasses it's original 1999 predecessor and suffers from being a very confusing movie but if you can bypass the flaws, then ""Matrix Reloaded"" is a must-see movie and worth renting many times over and succeeds in many ways that a lot of sequels fail at: living up the original. I say renting as opposed to buying because I'm just waiting for a possible box set or something like ""The Matrix Trilogy"" or some box set containing all three movies in one because even though the final movie ""Revolutions"" left me wanting a lot more, this trilogy was very well done and is a great achievement in Sci-Fi History.

This movie is about saving the last of human kind so it is not exactly always on Neo but he does play a huge role in this movie as the last. The only thing about this movie i dislike is that Neo is alpowerful and no one can beat him. Unlike the first and third where smith is stronger.

1465593,3,B00005JLTN,"Highlights: special-effects; style
Lowpoints: plot; acting

Conclusion: It's as simple as it gets - I found the original Matrix way too overrated (Tarkovsky exploited those themes visually long before the Wachowskis), but also way above average in terms of Hollywood fare. The second part is just the same for me - good special effects (just fun to watch, rather fake-looking actually, except the 40-minute race and Neo flying), good style, bad plot (been there, done that) and wooden acting. Fishburne runs through the religious routine as Morpheus, Carrie-Ann Moss is blank and a tool for wires as Trinity, and Neo is wandering from one plot point to the other like a puppet.
 Hell, this is all right though, maybe too pretentious and long, but definitely worth $10. Just to see the rest of the world catch on and be disappointed.

1465632,5,B00005JLTN,"The comparisons of THE MATRIX to STAR WARS are now I'm sure as legendary as the movie itself. Yet it cannot be said enough for a powerful reason.
There is a new paradigm of thought in town, bringing us in to the 21st century with unprecedented power, grace and style. In psychology in the earlier part of the 20th century, Jung the spiritualist/linguist so upset the applecart of Freud the biologist that it ushered in a whole new way to see humanity--respecting and, via inclusion, transcending the ones that came before it in its new perspective. But Stanislov Grof, with his post-Quantum, scientific mysticism, jumped so far beyond Jung that he makes him look like early Freud in comparison, and as such prepares us for both the ancient past and the 21st century.
Equally and similarly, before the seventies, one can see the plethora of movies influenced by the Freudian perspective on human life and Western Culture (think Hitchcock), and their often amazing quality and insight. George Lucas, however, building on that Jazz mystic Stanley Kubrick, decided to come along and do an Ali (""I'll shake up the World!!!!!!"") and give us a Jungian masterpiece underneath innovative special effects, changing movie making forever. There was really almost nowhere new to go in science fiction or action movies in their entirety after STAR WARS...until the Wachowski Brothers, like Grof to Jung, showed us directly what Lucas hinted at cryptically: INNER Space is the only space.
STAR WARS, after the several years we needed to catch on, allegorically introduced the greater world to the symphonic poetry of the Post-Jungian Mythographer and genius Joseph Campbell. THE MATRIX trilogy reintroduces us to the myth and mysticism that still forms the foundation of our culture and consciousness, as Joseph Campbell said, but in the context of *Michael Talbott* (see the book, THE HOLOGRAPHIC UNIVERSE): the quantum leap above and beyond Jung and Campbell for our post-modern, post-Einstein time. And it does so in a way that will be the standard for all myth-making and story-telling in Hollywood for quite some time, I'm sure. Yet like all great movies, knowing why it is so great doesn't stop you from enjoying it. Neither does seeing it a bunch of times! There is something new to mine from this trilogy every time you see it--particularly this one--because of the divine truths it thematically and metaphorically underscores.
Naturally, you can't ignore the obvious: the special effects and cinematography are from another planet. The fight choreography in RELOADED is the closest thing to ballet since CROUCHING TIGER, HIDDEN DRAGON (and by the same fight choreographer). Laurence Fishburne is again, well, Laurence Fishburne (any OTHELLO fans out there, with Kenneth Branaugh as Iago?). And, saints be praised, Keanu has not only found the role he was meant to play (unlike so many others), he really earns a nomination with this performance. But, like the first MATRIX, the trick is that all of the above could have sucked with a script as powerful as this one and the movie would have still been wonderful. The script actually brings to life all of the above mentioned spiritual themes by vehicularizing a rumination on the existence of choice and free will for the purpose of bringing some of the most profound Eastern philosophy and Hindu myth to our consciousness as the plotline/framework of this movie.  And they do so in not just a brilliantly entertaining way, but in a way that even a young teenager (like my son) could click on to, but not even a brain surgeon (like Pribram?) or an astrophysicist (like Bohm?) could ignore. This is real reason why you can watch both--in fact all three--of these movies 16 times each and still see it again as if it was the first each time.  And you may need to watch it at least twice to get half of the treasure trove of ideas flowing through it like fish in the river Nile.
Own this. This and *PI*--another wonderful independent film that heralds the discovery of the secret worlds of INNER space--are the New Testament of Science Fiction for me; maybe for all movie making for this new century.",1073865600,,4140,4.938307030129125

1465634,5,B00005JLTN,"By itself this film gets 5 stars but when viewed with Revolutions it gets about a three.  I'll explain more about this later.  When I saw the film in the theaters I was blown away.  It was a combination comic book come to life, a philosophical excercise and a rumination on the great conspiracy theories.

There are very few movies that make me literally sweat while watching them, Saving Private Ryan and The Exorcist being two examples.  This movie had so many of them I was exhausted after seeing it.  I'm an avid motorcyclist and the chase on the freeway made my knees weak.  I haven't watched the behind the scenes making of the chase on the DVD just because I don't want to ruin the magic.  I'm sure 90 percent of it was done digitally but it doesn't matter while watching the film, it's that well done.  The ghost twins are the best movie villains since Darth Vader.  The scene with Morpheus slicing the SUV open is a visual work of art.

All of the action in the world wouldn't amount to anything if the story was no good but this one is interesting and fun to follow.  The twists, turns and theories presented kept my cousins, brother and me discussing the possibilities for a few days after seeing it.  I totally disagreed with critics and fans that the dialog and story line dragged down the action.  The first Matrix was a good, solid, streamlined science fiction story where this one is dense and complex but it never overwhelmed the action.  I think anyone who had that complaint also had a short attention span.  There were some slow moments in Reloaded but I remember thinking the same thing the first time I saw The Matrix.  And while I loved the story here that leads to the big problem with Revolutions.  The entire build up for this movie was a waste of time.  Everything my family and I discussed after seeing this movie was much more interesting than what was presented in Revolutions.  I felt cheated that the payoff was just a big long fight with no follow up on the ideas presented in Reloaded.  It instantly made Reloaded absolete.  It feels like you're just wasting your time re-watching knowing the end will disappoint.  Revolutions wasn't a complete waste, it was still a decent movie just not the one I was hoping for.  Maybe I had built up my own expections too far.  I did enjoy the way the story ended.  It had an ambiguous ending that was fitting.

In the Matrix Neo seeks out the Oracle in order to find some answers to some questions that they have; however, the answers lead to further questions which turn into a maze of problems.  Matrix Reloaded uses some amazing special effects that cost a fortune to produce, however, the beginning of the film has some troubling transitions and scenes that causes awkwardness in the storyline.  These clumsy cinematic moments are temporarily saved by the special effects, but in the long run the film suffers from a cinematically congested introduction that is full of inelegant transitions between scenes and characters.

1465691,5,B00005JLTN,"...I really liked this movie.
In fact, I approached viewing this film with a somewhat cynical view myself, largely because I had heard so many negative comments about the film, ranging from critical reviews to discriminating banter from various radio personalities and talk show hosts.  From the very first moments of the film, to its cliff-hanger ending, I was engrossed, and completely satisfied with the second installment of ""The Matrix"" trilogy.
The premise of this story is pretty much a linear sequel to the first film.  Six months have passed Neo (Keanu Reeves) discovered that he is the ""One"" who can overthrow the machines that control the matrix and enslave humans to power their very existance.  Now, powerful and unstoppable, he returns to the matrix to continue his quest for the freedom of Zion.  Plagged by visions of events yet to happen, Neo is forced between serving humanity and protecting ""Trinity"" (Carrie Ann Moss) his one, true love.
When word reaches Zion that the machines have begun to burrow towards the human refuge, Morpheus leads Neo and Trinity back into the Matrix in an attempt to stop the attack before it begins.
The movie, which is packed full of the same breath-taking surreal special effects that made the first movie such a huge hit with fans world-wide, does not have the surprise of the first movie.  Though more elaborate, the effects are no longer  ground-breaking, as they have been seen in a variety of other films (Charlies Angels, Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon) and to the directors credit, the effects serve the story instead of replacing it.  Still, they are dazzling, sometimes leaving the audience (or at least this viewer) wondering, ""how did they do that?""
The story is tight, and a consistent continuance of the original Matrix narrative.  The original cast returns, expanding on certain characters including ""The Oracle"", Smith (who is now operating outside the scope of the agents in the matrix), Trinity, Morpheus, and even Neo himself, who is now a sort of ""Superman"" within the Matrix.  The cliff-hanger ending leaves the story standing mid-field, awaiting the arrival of ""Matrix: Revolution"".
So, despite the many negative reviews I've heard, personally, I think that ""The Matrix: Reloaded"" is a worthy successor to the original ""Matrix"" and a great film on its own.  Unlike so many sequels, this movie succeeds by expanding on an idea with a continuance that is both seamless and fresh, not re-hashing old ideas by creating new ones.  Watch it with an open mind and I think you will be more than pleasantly suprised.

1465732,4,B00005JLTN,"Pros:
1) More story and depth than the first Matrix movie
2) More and better fight scenes and special effects than the first Matrix movie
3) More development of the ""Matrix universe"" - how the Matrix works, etc.
4) More humor than the first Matrix movie, particularly with Merovingian
5) Agent Smith is a much more wickedly cool bad guy than in the first Matrix movie
6) You actually get the feeling that Neo and Trinity really care for each other, not just this ""you can't be dead because The Oracle told me I'm supposed to fall in love with you"" BS.
Cons:
1) Some of the action sequences went on way too long and got in the way of the plot
2) The plot doesn't make much sense
3) What the HELL was the Architect babbling on about? Was his goal just to confuse Neo into going back the other way, or to keep Neo occupied long enough to keep him from rescuing Trinity?
4) Generally a lot of ridiculously overblown BS... but don't ALL of the Matrix movies have that?

1465735,1,B00005JLTN,"Well, well, here comes the pretentious, ""philosophical,"" turkey of the year! Let's go over Reloaded point-by-point.
  First of all, there's Keanu Reeves. I never thought of him as a very good actor before, but he really showed his worst side in this film. He shows about as much emotion as a chunk of sheet metal. I'm surprised Trinity didn't ask him several times whether he actually loved her or not. Every time he comes on, you feel like walking up to him and saying ""hey, Neo, could I give you a little injection of charisma?"" Admittedly, he did look fine in his black suit and sunglasses. But that was really all he was--a black suit and sunglasses, filled with a little sawdust. He might as well have been holding the script in front of his face, reading it off to the audience.
  Carrie-Ann Moss did little better. Pointing a gun at Merovingian's wife because she wanted to kiss Neo? Certainly, I think Persephone was being stupid herself, but saying that Trinity's move was an overreaction is an understatement. She gave Keanu about as much as she received--dry acting, and that terrible flat voice that sounds like a computer-generated recording.
  OK, Laurence Fishburne did all right...but he did not compare with his rather good performance in the original Matrix movie. His speech in Zion was unconvincing for me--and I didn't particularly like his open, sleeveless shirt.
  And then there's Hugo Weaving, probably the movie's one saving grace. The Wachowski brothers don't give him nearly enough screen time, however, and he has little opportunity to show how well he can really act.
  And then the orgy and the sex scene--which I did NOT watch, by the way, being a Bible-believing Christian; my family just skipped those two scenes--are completely out of place and unnecessary. And whether they would have made sense in the plot, they are sinful and should never be imitated on the movie screen, let alone be done in reality.
  The fight scenes could have been good--they were certainly visually impressive. But in almost every one of them, the motion is slowed down to almost a stop for a few seconds. Apparently the Wachowski brothers were trying to make some sort of an impressive effect with this, but I thought it merely detracted from the quick pace of the scenes.
  The philosophy in this movie is an absolute joke. It appears to be an insane mix of several religions, and a dash of Wachowski weirdness. Most of it is meaningless, let alone dumb, and leads nowhere.
  The highway chase scene was so-so, but it did not have me feeling almost as if I was on Trinity's motorcycle, weaving in and out of the semis, as a good action scene should. I felt somewhat detatched watching it. The twins--albino, Rastafarian type fellows with white suits--were sort of funny, but once again they got hardly any screen time, and almost zero opportunity to act.
  The plot itself was so-so, and maybe in the hands of better and more moral directors and some OK actors (even mediocre would be better!) it would have been a decent movie. As it was, however, it was not good at all.
  Well, that was quite a rant, but I think overall this movie deserves it. The first movie had promise, but Reloaded shoots that out of the sky. I will see The Matrix Revolutions, the third and last installment, but not in the theaters and only to see what happens--and see if the Wackowski brothers salvage this failing trilogy.",1072310400,2,3416,4.738175675675675
1465736,5,B00005JLTN,"I really liked this sequel, I even liked it better the first one.  It's my fav in the series.  Don't get me wrong, the first was great too.  The first may be one of the greatest sci/fi action movies ever made.  I give the first an A+, But I give this A+++.  I know there lots of others who found Reloaded to be a dissapointing sequel, and they might find it weird that I liked this one more. Well if anybody has a problem w/ that, then BACK OFF!!  keeep your opinions to yourself.  This movie is flled with lots of fun. There is so much action in this movie.  I will admit that when I went to see this film in theaters, I was having low expectations of this movie b/c most sequels don't live up to the original and that I saw lots of bad reviews for this movie.  But that only made this movie more enjoyable.  I walked out of theater wanting to see it again.  Now here is the plot.
We are introduced to Zion, the last human city.  The humans have learned that the machines are about to learn the location of the city, and the humans must prevent that from happening.  And not only that, Agent smith lives again.  He is now a different type of programm which he also can copy himself on to other programs.  He is now both a threat to Neo and the regular agents from the Matrix .  Neo Trinity, and Morpheus and a group of other humans such as Niome (Jada Pinkett smith) must travel through the Matrix in order to find a way to stop the machines.  They are at the same time are trying to prove the prophecy true, that Neo (a.k.a. the ONE) will be able save the humans and stop the machines.  As they are in the matrix, they must battle the agents and a new assasins such these ""ghostly Twins"" who have the ability to pass through walls (like like Shadowcat from X-MEN).  Neo must be able to find a ""source"" in the Matrix to help destroy the Machines.
Anyway, Matrix Reloaded is a very fun film.  I liked this one better because there is so much more action in this one then the first.  Not mention that huge might scene between Neo and 100 agant smiths.  I liked that b/c there was alot of fighting and it was so long too.  It was the best part in this movie.

The cons would probably be the way the story is being handled. Although this movie isn't just garbage like everyone suddenly started saying, it is flawed by unbalanced storytelling. Such as, why are they putting so much focus on Neo and Trinity and ignoring Naomi and Ghost. The Wichowski Bros. seemed to be convinced that the only fan base for the Matrix was teenagers and gamers. They didn't seem to realize the huge fan base for the serise. Having a whole storyline just pulled out and placed in a (what I consider) a pretty mediocore game is not the best idea. And what was with the lack of promotion for The Animatrix? That tied in to the story too and they treated it just like they treat every other anime with a small release. However after all this you're probably wondering why I gave this four stars instead of maybe 2. Me being the hardcore gamer/ anime fan. I had no problem following the story by watching the anime and playing the game. I just wonder how they expected this to succeed without promoting the entire story.",1072224000,,1213,4.468468468468468

Not to mention any usage of philosophical dialogue is totally ruined by a blatent explanation directly following, but hey, he ""drank zee wine"" and now he ""must piss.""  Is Reloaded worth having in a movie library?  Yes.  Does that necessarily mean that it was a successful continuation of an incredible plot and idea?

1465800,5,B00005JLTN,"Matrix Reloaded is an exceptional film for people who appreciate the art of the moving image.  The director deserves high praise for being able to show this film with incredible angles, special effects, and scenes that have never been created before (i.e., the freeway speed chase).
PHILOSOPHY.  The philosophy of The Matrix is that we are connected to a web, a maze of interconnected fibers within the world that pre-determine what actions we will take within the future.  There is no reason to stop an event from happening; once it is meant to happen, it will happen.  As one scene mentioned quite thoughtfully, there is no point in stopping an event from happening, but you can try to develop a sense of meaning as to why it happened.  Meaning is far more important than trying to change human events.
The issue of predetermination has been debated for many, many years, but few films try to understand the issue with as much depth as this one does.  At the same time, The Matrix questions existance itself -- as there are parallel ""existances"" -- and reality is a questionable and temporary part of the universe.
Then, a word on the freeway chase: I have never seen a freeway chase presented with such close angles on the scenes themselves.  It was absolutely stunning and quite interesting for the mind to take in.  When watching this film, you get the sense that your mind is embarking on a grand experiment -- one in which you are to notice the artistic renditions, which are pleasing to the mind; to understand the philosophical overtones of the movie, and yet, still, enjoy the plot as it unfolds.  Certainly ought to qualify for a movie of the year in 2003.  Look forward to seeing Matrix Revolutions.

1465801,2,B00005JLTN,"In a word, I found The Matrix Reloaded to be a disappointment. I suppose you could make the argument that it is unfair to review this movie independent of the 3rd movie in this trilogy, since the point of this movie seems to be to set-up the finality in the 3rd movie. But other than serving that purpose and providing a few entertaining special effects and a revelation or two that are unexpected, overall this movie was a big let down for me. Other than a couple of interesting scenes and special effects, the majority of the movie was dull and difficult to sit through. A lot of people that saw this movie raved about the car chase that occurs at the end of the film, but I was not impressed by it.
Particularly annoying are the love scenes between Neo and Trinity. Their blooming and destined love for one another was not as sappy in the first film, but in this movie it borders on being as sappy as some old Hallmark card. Why does Hollywood feel the need to continually bombard us with these absurd images of romantic love? ""Now we are even,"" says Trinity. I'm quite certain that the movie could have done without that trifle remark or the entire scene for that matter. What was the need for that entire scene anyway? Love conquers all else, even logic? Please!
What was so great about the first film was its originality - original concept, original camera work, the twists and turns of the plot. This film had none of that. If the meaning of this film was to explain part of the first one and set us up for the last one, then how about just dividing this film in half. Tack half of it onto the first film and tack the rest of it onto the 3rd film. But then again, the real purpose of this film was to get a few more million bucks out of the public. At least that was a success.",1071964800,,1784,4.265486725663717

1465803,4,B00005JLTN,"Well. I saw the movie, and i like it, is a good action film, lot of shooting, chasing, a hero, a girl in love of the hero and all the ingredients that make a good action film. But that's it, I can't talk about reloaded as a second part of the great MATRIX, why? The plot it's not consistent with all the ideas that where thrown over the first film, for example, at the end of THE MATRIX NEO was able to understand the matrix code and destroy the agents without fight them, he become omnipresent inside the system, but in RELOADED he was only a supercharged human with limited powers. Another inconsistency, at the end of reloaded, where NEO is capable of shutdown the sentinels just extending the hand, wasn't the matrix a computer environment where the hackers could jack in by plug themselves with a wire attached to their head? so NEO goes wireless? what happened with the interface that they need for entering the system? We have to remember that THE MATRIX is only a computer based system. I'm sorry but there is too much inaccuracy trying to join both films.
  The scene with the arquitect, where they want to explain everything in joust five minutes is boring pointless and meaningless, when I saw the movie at first time I get lost at the middle of it. Well this film got a lot of details that already where pointed out for another reviewers so I joust can said that RELOADED is a great film if it's looked apart of THE MATRIX.  if you wanted to find a connection, then you are not going to enjoy this film. Watch it and don't try to understand and tray to make it fit in the MATRIX Universe that were created around THE MATRIX first movie.

1465804,5,B00005JLTN,"While critics have repeatedly knocked Reloaded for not being the Matrix (just like they have knocked the Star Wars prequels for not being like the classic trilogy), I found the movie to be a thrilling, entertaining experience.  It is so rare to find an action movie that has any underlying value that I am thrilled beyond belief whenever one comes along.
As for the comments that it is ""not as good as the original,"" what sequel is?  Very few sequels can improve upon the perception of the original, and Reloaded is no different.  In the original Matrix, the Wachowskis showed us revolutionary things we had never seen before in American cinema, like bullet time and wired martial arts.  Because the second film uses variations on many of these same techniques, even though the action sequences are still thrilling, we as an audience have lost some of the wonder that accompanied seeing these things for the first time.
I don't think we give enough credit to the digital pilgrims like the Wachowskis and George Lucas, whose films pioneer effects that are subsequently replicated and mimicked by dozens of other films.  But I digress.
While the film has some slow moments (the Zion sequence, in particular), the ""burly brawl"" and freeway chase sequences should provide enough adrenaline to satisfy even the most hard core action junkie.  The film also presents some maddeningly complex philosophical quandaries that are more directly presented as a part of the plot than the subtle underpinnings of the original Matrix.  This is probably another reason some people voiced some disdain about the movie: ""you mean I have to THINK about my entertainment and not just absorb mindless action?!?"" ;-)
In short, although the Wachowskis may not have hit a home run with Reloaded as they did with Matrix, they have certainly legged out a standing triple that entertains on multiple levels.",1071705600,,1879,4.984025559105431

1465806,4,B00005JLTN,"On the Movie:
Ok, this movie made me hate Larry and Andy Wachowski the first time I saw it. But then I decided to swallow my disappointment and saw it again with hope of finding something, and I did.
I believe that this movie is a work of art with some very nasty flaws that spoilt it to me the first time, but after my second time I watched this movie I just forgot the flaws. It's like if you couldn't remain angry at a child for doing something dumb after a good smile.
The Plot doesn't have any holes as I first thought. In fact, the twist the story had with Neo's confrontation with the Architect was amazing. The Orwell inspired ""1984"" view of hope and rebellion being measures of control released by the system itself in order to keep a balance and ensure its survival kept me thinking.
The film is very philosophical, in fact it has very deep ideas like the nature of choice, causality and the behavior of men. The visual aspect was incredible with a dazzling use of special effects and the shots were simply breathtaking.
But now lets analyze the flaws. Zion was my worst problem with this film. Please!!! do not do that ever again. The rave was completely out of place and seemed as a desperate attempt to win viewers through a ""Baywatch scene"" after the heavy philosophy the studio may have feared people wouldn't stand without (I don't dare to name this atrocity with an adjective).
The people of Zion looked everything but men and women who had found the truth about reality and awakened from a lie. They were more like ""wanna party and be sexy for real"" rather than ""I'm fighting not only for myself but for mankind's freedom"" idealists and warriors. The only characters I found real there were a wise old man with a point but claming to have none, a worried man in angst for seeing his vision of defense crashed by an etheric believe he didn't understand, the crew members of the ships and controllers of Zion, a kid and a bunch of old people in the council (which are considerable), but not the thousands of mistakes raving with an army above them.
The other huge mistake I found was the ""Kung-Fu plus 10 000"". The first movie had an amazing mix of action (yes and Kung-Fu) with dialog, character development during the fights, philosophical revelations and more. Reloaded had some grate Kung-Fu too, but the scriptwriter forgot the mix, the interaction of characters and the narrative beauty leaving only the esthetic, letting the Kung-Fu be the star... (for that I can rent an ordinary PG-13 movie with Van Dame)
In the end the movie left a grate foundation for Revolutions, but again with a mistake... (never end a Film like TV!!!). The ""to be concluded"" after a flash shot of a man infected with virus Smith (grate performance by the way!!).
Oh, and another thing I just hated was the exaggerated use if CGI in the Neo - Smith fight. (It looked like Final Fantasy). There were other ways to that more realistic...
But in the end I had to swallow my hate to this mistakes and enjoy the pros of the movie. My conclusion is that there were errors in the script (in the way of deep narrative during the fights and using things without purpose)
If you cut some parts like the Zion rave, you can still understand the movie without any loss. If you reduce the Kung-Fu a little bit and add character development like in the first Matrix (1st is less expensive and 2nd makes a better movie).
The movie began incredibly boring, (just kung fu (without context), usless and ridiculous rave, kung fu (without context), kung fu (without context), and no development at all. But after the conversation with oracle, things began to improve, and by the time Neo was in the building I was hooked. The twists at the end were great and turned my imagination wild.
Dispite the flaws, I still love the good parts of the movie and think Revolutions makes amends.
On the DVD:
Great transfer (both audio and video). Great Information in the Special Features. But...
The extras had one flaw, a very plain audio track. They put one track and left it playing the whole documentary killing the rhythm. But the information is still very interesting.
Could have been better... but hey, nobody is perfect.
If you have doubts about this movie, watch Revolutions first and then think if you can forgive what you didn't like. In my case, I only had to watch Reloaded again...",1071446400,,4360,4.569604086845466
1465826,4,B00005JLTN,"Wake up! The world we live in, the one many of us believe we have lived in since the day we were born, is not real. You, as well as those around you, may believe that it is the year 2003 but it is actually closer to the year 2099, or some time close to that. The world has been overrun by the Machines who have subjugated the human race into a vast computer programming network known as The Matrix in order to keep them in line and use them to power to city and army. Sounds farfetched, huh? Prior to 1999 you would have been right but that was before the release of The Matrix, the highly acclaimed cult film that sent shockwaves through Hollywood with it success on DVD and surprised everyone with the announcement of two sequels budgeted at $300 million set to be released in 2003. Though the first sequel, The Matrix Reloaded, will contain an R-rating, not unlike its predecessor, many analysts expect the highly anticipated summer release to break significant box office records on its to possibly challenging Titanic for the highest domestic grossing film title. The hype for this film has been building for quite some time as fanatics chatted online and trailers played before nearly every film in release and all that anticipation has come to a peak. Now it is up to the filmmakers to demonstrate that all the waiting and overloaded hype were well worth the wait.

The story for The Matrix Reloaded, though a follow-up to the original The Matrix, does not exactly pick up where the original film left off. The whole Matrix universe is a complex story line that requires numerous side ventures to full realize what is going on, this includes The Animatrix DVD and the Enter the Matrix video game. But for those certain individuals going into this film practically blindfolded, here is a simple and basic story line for what is occurring in The Matrix Reloaded: It is the year 2099 and mankind, or what is left of it, continues an ongoing battle with the machines that has lasted over a hundred years. Prior to the beginning of the war, the machines ruled the world and forced all of mankind into a form of slavery. By building a vast computer system known as The Matrix, they were able subjugate humans into creating energy for them without any direct human being ever knowing they were doing so. Few were able to break free of The Matrix including Morpheus, Trinity, Neo and the people of Zion, the last stronghold of the human race. As they continue to do battle with the machine world, they draw ever closer to answering the burning questions: Why are we here? Why are doing what we do? Why us? And that is as simple as one can get without giving away key aspects of the film. Though the plot of the film can get quite confusing, even to those that are familiar with the original film, The Matrix Reloaded significantly builds on the complexity of the original The Matrix and goes one step further in presenting brilliant philosophical concepts to the teeming masses.

The cast of The Matrix Reloaded make eloquent contributions to the film and is greatly expanded from the small group that was presented in the original film in 1999. There is no doubt in anyone?s mind that Keanu Reeves is perfectly cast as the role of Neo, or The One. There was some question with the original film on whether Reeves could handle such an important role but he positively proves his worth in this film presenting a character that is different from when we last saw him but at the same time still as enduring as he was in the original film. Carrie-Ann Moss, who reprises her role as Trinity, is placed more center stage in this film then last time, allowing more screen time to demonstrate the character?s importance to the entire story, more than some had originally thought. Laurence Fishburne is, as he was in the first film, delightful as Morpheus. Fishburne is able to express more emotions within this film even though he does not play as significant a role as he did with the original film. Jada Pinkett Smith is decent with her role but she doesn?t really do all that much to give the audience a reason to care all that much. Hopefully her role will be expanded in The Matrix Revolutions. And Monica Belluci?s Persephone seems like a waster as she is given little to do outside of being anything more then eye candy for the young male audience. Unfortunately her acting range isn?t presented in this film which is a disappointment after good word of mouth coming from roles in foreign films.

Overall, though The Matrix Reloaded doesn?t exactly live up to the tremendous amount of hype that surrounded its release (what film could?), it is definitively the event film of the summer and quite possibly the year. Even with the fact stated, there are several things to pick at about the film including the large amount of kissing scenes between Neo and Trinity. After a certain point you would think the audience would get the idea that these two are madly in love with each other but apparently the filmmakers thought that the whole ?eating each other?s faces? would better express that point. Another scene that seemed to be a big problem with everybody was the ?orgy? scene in the city of Zion. What was the point of this? Granted it could be to express the concept of life and the present moment but could they have not done this in a better way then they did? It was amazing to see how quickly this film went from being a total sci-fi action flick to a porno and then back to a sci-fi action film. Though the sporadic sexual references throughout the film weren?t a significant problem, they did manage to be quite annoying after awhile and could have easily been eliminated from the film. But other then those small complaints, The Matrix Reloaded is the must-see film of the summer and should be seen for its astounding special effects alone, though at times they do feel a bit over-the-top, namely the ?Burly Brawl? sequence between Neo and the multiple Agent Smiths. The film is not perfect by any sense of the word but for those who do appreciate it, they will know that this is only one half of a two part film. Don?t forget to stick around after the credits to check out the exciting teaser trailer for The Matrix Revolutions.",1071360000,,6237,4.596947935368043
1465827,4,B00005JLTN,"Neo flies.  Trinity dies.  Morpheus cries (almost).  These are just three of the many scenes of The Wachowski Brothers' ""The Matrix Reloaded"", one of the most anticipated sequels of the last decade.
The film begins with Neo, played by Keanu Reeves.  Neo is plagued by nightmares involving the death of lover Trinity (Carrie Anne-Moss).  He believes he is seeing the near future.  After a few neat CGI-filled scenes that show that to us, we find Neo, Trinity, and Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne) (the latter of whom is being ridiculed by some fellow humans for belief in ""The Prophecy"") on their way home to Zion.  There they learn that the amount of sentinels has increased greatly.  The war is coming, or so we are told.
Morpheus meets with his rival, stern Commander Lock (Harry Lennix).  The two are constant competitors after Lock stole Morpheus' love, Niobe (Jada Pinkett Smith).  They fight about what to do, what's coming, and what to believe.
So do we.  With ""Reloaded"", what began as a single successful film becomes an updated ""Star Wars""-esque trilogy, with a seemingly unbeatable first film, a middle piece, and a battle-filled climax.  Many watchers will be put off from this film's lack of progression storywise, but that's meant to be.  It's the centerpiece for the story, and it's unfortunately quite hard to do much with the centerpiece (""The Empire Strikes Back"" still wows me).
What Andy and Larry have done is left open our questions from the first film.  Oh yeah, they added some new ones too.  And I get the feeling ""Revolutions"" doesn't clear them up either.  Ugh.
""Reloaded"" is every bit as entertaining as the original film, if not a little more confusing at times.  There's enough action and excitement to keep anyone in their seats - especially the scene around the end of the picture, in which Morpheus and Trinity struggle to keep the Keymaker out of reach of The Twins and/or the Agents.  And, all of this occurs on what's got to be the most realistically vicious freeway I've ever seen.
One thing that I deemed unnecessary was the amount of sexuality.  There was a fair amount of sexuality (including nudity) and too much sappiness throughout the film.  Carrie Anne-Moss and Keanu Reeves making out?  I don't know about you, but that's not my idea of a good time.  Generally, things like this occur when the previously careful directors become more comfortable and popular ... which isn't always a bad thing.
The CGI animation is spectacular.  There's a slight drop in martial arts action from the first film, but the action sequences here are really fun.  Of course, they're accompanied by another great punk/metal/rock soundtrack and a fast-paced score from Don Davis.
One last note: Neo flies.  Yep, he flies.  As one of the Nebachudnezzar's crew puts it, ""Uh-oh - he's doin' the Superman thing again.""  This happens about three times throughout the film, and while it does have a sort of cheesy and annoying feeling to it, I can't help myself but to find it fun.  And funny.
Overall, ""The Matrix Reloaded"" comes nowhere near being as good as its predecessor, but it's a fun time at the movies, and definitely a recommended watch.  This series is getting better and better.  Now for ""Revolutions"".",1071360000,,3229,4.850091407678245

The bulk of Reloaded is nothing but over choreographed, completely plot unrelated video game like fight scenes. Why do this Wachowski? Why sell your soul to Silver? Or did you?
I felt like crap watching this movie, and I really wish I hadn't. I am going to go to a hypnotherapist and get him to convince me that I have never seen this trite torment of a film, just so I can enjoy the first one as I always have. I am not just disappointed because the second film is slightly worse than the first. It's so pathetically bad I wanna cry.
In the first film every single scene meant something. Everything was a precursor to something else. When Neo fights smith in the subway, it's a lead-up to him waking up to the realities of the matrix. When Morpheus fights smith in the bathroom, he is sacrificing himself to save his crew and fulfills the prophecy Oracle made. Everything is connected somehow. But what do we get in Reloaded? We get Neo flying and fighting quadrillion agents, for the sake of flying and fighting quadrillion agents. Only at the very end of the movie do you get that same feeling of mystery, of something important, something significant is about to take place. It feels like the first movie again... and then you see ""To Be Continued"".
Oh and the dialog. Morpheus delivers lines with such incredible intensity and depth that you actually think he has something important to say. He doesn't. It's so pretentious it was almost insulting. He might as well come into a dark room, wearing sunglasses, and say: ""I... had... waffles! For breakfast this morning"" in his slow deliberating tone, it would have been just as deep as most of what he had to say.
I loved the first movie, I watched it at least a hundred times as it was set looping on my DVD player for a month straight at one time. I saw Reloaded and couldn't believe what a sad excuse for a Matrix sequel it was. Based on what I've heard I will never pay to see Revolutions.",1071187200,7,2119,4.520833333333333

Gimme a break!) fumble through some indeterminate pseudo-philosophy that was supposed to explain the whole mess.
And what about the albino twins?  Who were they supposed to be?  Edgar and Johnny Winters' concert reunion?  I thought they were supposed to be able to materialize wherever they wanted to.

However, it is interesting to see such polarizing effect from Reloaded and now Revolutions.  I personally enjoyed both.  The films played out the idea of a few humans struggling against a machine dominated world nicely.  It is definitely not a Hollywood happy ending sort of series.  Reloaded can be ponderous at times but if it is at fault being pretentious, it is at least thought provoking---hence such extreme feelings.  I think people who are disappointed with the sequels simply want to have a nice and coherent explaination and resolution of the story.  Reloaded doesn't provide that; in fact, it turns what is learned in the original movie upside down by revealing just how much the machines are in control.

I actually chuckled when I saw one review that said ""I expected more special effects.""  This film is nothing BUT special effects!  If you put together all the footage that featured no effects whatsoever, it might make up about five minutes of screen time.  The first film took a sci-fi plot and added an interesting philosphical slant.  This film, however, is about nothing but people who dress up in leather and sunglasses and then fight.

1465898,2,B00005JLTN,"When the first Matrix film was released, it was definitely the most original science-fiction movie in years. It was a fresh idea in the world of the 'man vs. machine' concept and featured some of the most revolutionary special effects ever, many of which would be duplicated by countless others. Now comes the Matrix Reloaded, the long-awaited follow-up to that now cult-classic sci-fi hit. Sadly, the once-anticipated series has now taken a complete step backward.

Needless to say, the Matrix Reloaded contains some of the silliest plot elements ever conceived. Anyone who believes this movie has philosophy in it is a total imbecile. The dialogue scenes are filled with ridiculous aphorisms that are either common sense or just idiotic gibberish. The amount of such annoying dialogue really hurts the enjoyable factor. All the characters seemed to have lost their cool edge from the first film. While Keanu Reeves still has no idea how to act, the Trinity and Morpheus characters have much limited roles here. The action scenes fall short of being impressive. Obviously, they've simply been added to add more length to the movie, such as the monotonous freeway chase. There's barely room for any plot, thus there's still a lot left to be desired.

Visually, there isn't anything to be fascinated by since everything has basically been recycled from the first. It is all too familiar now. The soundtrack has predominantly tribal-sounding music that sounds like it belongs elsewhere. The fight sequences seem uninspired and lack the originality and tenacity of those found in its predecessor. If you're a sci-fi fan, you might dig Reloaded, but Matrix fans may be disappointed. The lukewarm storyline, nonsense dialogue and tedious action scenes prevent it from even coming close to the original.",1070582400,2,1797,5.171821305841925
1465899,4,B00005JLTN,"The task of following up a blockbuster, genre-defining film with a sequel is no easy task.  It is even harder when production delays and on-set tragedies push the release of that sequel from two years to four years after the original.  Faced with the pressure of expectations that are only exceeded by those that the ""Star Wars"" prequels endured, ""The Matrix: Reloaded"" more or less is successful in continuing the momentum of its predecessor.  While the awe of discovery and imagination is not present here (and couldn't be after the first movie), ""Reloaded"" still manages to pack eye-popping actions scenes with mind-bending philosophy, without getting too hampered by the incompleteness that plagues most `middle' films.

""The Matrix: Reloaded"" takes place at an unspecified time after the events of the first movie.  Emboldened by Neo's (Keanu Reaves) victory against the agents in the first film, the first of any kind for the humans against the machines, the emancipated humans have been stepping up there actions against the machines, freeing more enslaved humans and creating a definite perceived threat to the existence of the machines.  Striking from the home base of Zion, near the center of the Earth, the humans have faith, thanks to Neo's presence and exploits, that the war is theirs to win.  Of course, the machines, sensing that they must make a final strike to eradicate the human threat, have sent a huge arsenal of sentinels boring towards Zion with the single missions of extermination.  Will Neo be able to save humanity from this threat?  That question will not answered here (it is saved for the third part of the trilogy, ""The Matrix: Revolutions""), but the actions that will set in motion that climax are presented in ""Reloaded"" and are quite compelling.

In ""The Matrix: Reloaded"", almost all of the characters who survived the first movie have returned.  Neo, of course, is back, as well as his lover, Trinity, along with Morpheus.  The absence of Tank (who did survive the original), however, is both jarring and barely explained.  As the Matrix was introduced to audiences in the first film, so is the city of Zion and its inhabitants introduced to all in this film.  There are many new characters added to the mix, which are too numerous to list here.  Some of the new characters are very entertaining, although almost none of them qualify as `good guys'.  The two twins who do battle with Neo in the Matrix provide some skilled martial arts action.  The always-gorgeous Monica Bellucci glows in an all-too-short cameo as Persephone.  The true enigmatic addition is that of the double-talking Frenchman, Merovingian.  It's not quite clear what he is or where his loyalties, but his rapid fire verbiage dripping with a thick French accent is both maddening and amusing.  It should be noted that even Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving) returns, although somewhat `changed'.

Much like the original film, ""The Matrix: Reloaded"" excels when it comes to action sequences.  An early where Neo battles more than 100 Agent Smiths provides a visual martial arts treat for the audience.  A later battle, which takes place at high speeds on a crowded highway, is one of the most suspenseful, white-knuckle action scenes to hit the screen in years.  Watching Morpheus leap from vehicle to vehicle while battling agents (and those twins) in an attempt to protect a vital entity known as the `keymaker' keeps the audience on the edge of its collective seat for the duration.

Unfortunately, there are some negative aspects to this film, too.  Aside from the incomplete feeling, of which it is merely the victim of the `middle film syndrome', ""Reloaded"" doesn't blend the action and philosophy in nearly as seamless a manner as the original.  While amusing, the discussions between the heroes and Merovingian, are confounding and, when examined more closely, reveal nothing.  The same can be said of a later encounter between Neo and a man called `The Architect' (whose purpose will not be revealed here).  The Architect's clipped, harsh delivery and double-talk is particularly aggravating.  The human scenes also don't resonate quite the same way the did in the original.  There is one particular scene where Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne) is giving what is supposed to be a rousing speech to the masses gathered on a night to celebrate their recent successes.  The speech is so grandiose and so over the top that the message Morpheus is trying to convey is lost in the posturing.

Fans of the original ""Matrix"" will come out of this film without the same sense of wonder that accompanied the first film.  Perhaps, they will even have a sense of disappointment due to some of the factors mentioned above.  However, ""The Matrix: Reloaded"" still strongly holds its own as a worthy sequel to ""The Matrix"".  The table has been set and the pressure is on for ""The Matrix: Revolutions"" to satisfactorily conclude this saga.",1070582400,,4926,4.993872549019608
1465900,1,B00005JLTN,"If the W brothers handed this sequel over to a small group of professional hacks, the result would have been the same: a parody of the original Matrix. No, make that half a parody. This isn't even a complete story. Sure, the special effects are good. But the look of the movie is too green, and the best special effects are simply bigger versions of the stuff we saw in the first film. This time, the fight scenes were conceived before the plot --- and the much-talked-about philosophical underpinning of the Matrix was discarded in favor of gibberish about 'purpose' and 'choice.'
I did enjoy seeing Zion. The underground city looked good --- except for the rave scene . . . and the speeches that took place in apartments and on balconies. The W brothers could have used this moment to explain how Zion functions, but they didn't bother. The scenes that follow are a jumble of pointless fights and chases, intercut with long philosophical discussions. None of it goes anywhere. There are at least three fights that could have been cut with no effect on the plot. And the endless talk just confuses things instead of clarifying. (Honestly, I think the Oracle was just mocking Neo with gibberish in her scene.) They saved the worst for last. An hour's worth of action, fights, characters, and explanation is squeezed into the final twenty minutes.
The Matrix Reloaded takes a science fiction world millions of people love and it removes everything that made them love it. The mystery (""What is the Matrix?"") is gone. We all know what it is, and there's no new mystery added to keep us interested. The philosophy we enjoyed is reduced to the repetition of key words like 'choice.'

Let me see how I can define what I think about Matrix Reloaded... Let's say that it was simply the most wonderful movie I've ever seen, absolutely fantastic. It is not exactly how I felt because what I felt is just beyond words, but let's keep moving on... You probably have already heard about Matrix otherwise you're not from this world, anyway let's see what Matrix Reloaded is all about. Basically it is the 2nd movie from the trilogy and it revolves around Zion (the last human city). Neo, Trinity and Morpheus have to save the city, but to accomplish that mission Neo has to fight Smith and his clones. There are some other interesting scenes but to know about them you'd better watch it!!
Now talking about the DVD itself. Never again will I see such a complete DVD. Let's say it is complete because of the Special Features included in the second CD. For you to have a certain idea of how complete it is they've included the MTV Movie Awards parody of the movie, and a commercial designed on the film. There are some other special features that show the production of the trilogy, such as the Highway Pursuit and some interviews with the actors, producers and directors.
I think that's what I could say about this incredible movie. All we have to do is wait for the end of the trilogy. Like the poster of the 3rd movie says ""everything that has a beginning has an end"". All we have to do is wait for it!!!",1070496000,,1432,4.448669201520913

I agree with the reviewers here that give 'Reloaded' a good review, but I have to make a couple of additional points in response to their critique.
-The feel of the series is best thought of as a graphic novel brought to life.  Therefore, wearing of sunglasses indoors at night, philisophical double-speak, and over-wrought drama are to be expected and even desired!  This is also the reason for the music video-like choreography.  Its a style choice, not meant to be realistic.
-The matrix itself is a computer program, so I would expect a hundred Smiths fighting Neo to look like a video game - it is one!
I haven't seen 'Revolutions' yet, but regardless of its reviews, I will probably enjoy it just by tailoring my attitude to what the filmmakers intended.",1070409600,,916,4.735849056603773

I cannot help but feel that many people out there have not understood the movie and, perhaps, the whole idea behind this trilogy. If you are a computer programmer you should be able to connect with the overall concept of virtual reality and computer coding, and this movie really shows, mostly in a graphical and easier to grasp, a deep relation between the two. I personally think that this movie was just as good or actually better than the first one not because the SFX are improved, but because the plot and complexity of it is exploited in a more multilayered way and Trinity is just as HOT as ever. There are a few things that I just don't care for, for example; they all, mostly, wear sunglasses even in low light ambients and the overall dialogue is somewhat woody and filled with over the top words and sentencing that makes things sound more complicated than they should. Also, when Neo fights hundreds of agent Smiths in the courtyard, the switch from live actors to CGI characters is noticeable and makes it feel like you are watching a videogame rather than a movie.

1465962,3,B00005JLTN,"Okay, okay, it ISN'T the worst film ever, as some here have claimed; it's just that the first Matrix set the bar so very high as a smart, stylish, action-filled sci-fi knockout.  And Reloaded doesn't come close to the first, because it breaks very little new ground.  The visual look is identical to the first, with the exception of the Zion scenes.  Plotwise there's not much new--Neo has a quest, but we're hardly clear on what he expects to find or why he should believe anything at all that he's told in the world of the Matrix, or why he even thinks he should believe anything he's told.  He certainly knows that the world is a fiction--that's what makes him the One!  There is an interesting twist at the end that I won't reveal--it's all that really makes the film worth watching for those of you interested in the storyline.  The writers dropped the ball almost completely on Agent Smith and the Oracle--it seems to me that what actually happened to Smith, what he has now become, outside the program, is of real interest and much more compelling than seeing him split ad infinitum; and the true nature of the Oracle is hinted at but not really explored.  Of course, some questions must remain unanswered for the final film, and I hope these are addressed.  There's a very peculiar scene in a restaurant, and a bit with a keymaker, that disturb the continuity--I felt that the scenes were there to provide some weirdness, but make very little sense in the context of the Matrix itself.
So that leaves the action.  I should probably leave it to others to judge this, not being a connoiseur of fight scenes--I always get irritated that Hollywood seems to think that outrunning machine gun fire is so easy and often-accomplished (at least in the Matrix there's really a context for it!).  But in general, I thought much of the action was simply tiring.  Okay, Agent Smith multiplies, Neo fights him to a draw, Neo flies away.  I get the point.  But do I need to get it for so long, so often?  There were admittedly some great moments, but some very long half-hours, as has been said of Richard Wagner's operas...
I'll definitely see the end of the trilogy; but Reloaded has completely changed my expectations.  What a shame of an anticlimax to what is undoubtedly a great sci-fi film.",1070323200,,2289,4.617283950617284

Simple, so much money atrophies the brain, imagination is the most important thing in writing any story, and so it is indispensable for script writing, and most important, in writing any smart script for a much anticipated sequel, what the brothers end up doing is a series of fights tie up with something resembling a script, or should I say, an script essay. The Matrix outstanding original story line was something that couldn't be surpassed so easily, such a problem required hard thinking and commitment, and most importantly, approaching the script with a new and different perspective in order to write not a more original story, but a intelligent one, they miss this big time, instead they delivered what pop culture movies care the most, Action Sequences, its all down hill from here, good scripts are essentially important in film making, if you don't have a good story to tell, having good actors, accurate direction, and great visual effects won't safe your movie.
In fact, every thing goes right until the characters open their mouth to say sh.... The Morpheus Zion speech is the lowest point of 2003 movie season (and I haven't yet seen Legally Blonde II, and I won't intend to). This is particularly sad because Morpheus was the most interesting character in the first Matrix, but in Reloaded he is  ridiculous (I don't understand how the directors wrote this atrocity and manage to write the Architect's speech, a fairly goof piece of writing). In the first film, the actors were acceptably fit in their characters (don't get me wrong, there was no Shakespearian acting in The Matrix), here they are unexpressive masks, and where are the nude scenes with Monica Bellucci (Persephone), the ones that really mattered, huh? (Monica is one of my favorite actresses), instead you get flat Carrie Ann Moss in some mindless boring nude scenes inserted somewhere in a Rave Party (shame on the editor, that scene will cost you the Oscar, Zach Staenberg).
About the action scenes, yes, they are great, Yuen Wo Ping came back for Reloaded and Revolutions, again his work is excellent (as always), the Smith's fight with Neo, and the car chase scene are really good, but you will find your self thinking: this is great, but I don't feel anything, this is because of the lack of story and the zero characters. Every time Neo is flying, you know he will safe, so there is no emotion attached for the characters been harm, and when Trinity is about to die, well, bet with some fool about is she going to die or not?, that way you will get back the money you paid to see this piece of sh... (the Merovingian's Castle fight can cause you a coma, so be prepared).
John Gaeta (the Gaeta Force), commands a great visual effects work, but it repeats itself (hardly there is anything new, only an enhanced Bullet Time technique). The cheap philosophy here is blown up an exercise to impress the audiences,  trying at the same time to bring their film to some intellectual level, not happening here of course. Don Davis improved his music for Reloaded, but the choices for the songs are unfortunate. The direction is O.K (I guess), in terms of the pace, the ending, Why?, To be continued? (see how money atrophies the brain). So if you are Larry Wachowski saying: Woooooowwwww man, I dare anyone, this is like the most com-complex movie ever, you better think again. I did laughed at the Merovingian's Wiping you're a... with silk line, that was a high point of the movie (how sad is that). Fortunately, the Matrix Revolutions has a little something more than Reloaded, so watch it anyway, even with the bad taste of the this film .
To finish with, the DVD (being this a big studio movie), has a lot of really good extras, the sound is great (Dolby Digital 5.1),  the transfer is first class, but this only enhances the DVD value, not the movie quality. The choice here is to rent or buy the Animatrix, you will be more pleased.",1070236800,,4248,4.706989247311828
1466008,2,B00005JLTN,"The Matrix Trilogy. In a way you could say it wanted to be the ""Star Wars"" trilogy of the 21st century, yet it won't be. Why? Well, personally I found all three films entertaining, as long as you could suspend your disbelief and only watched them once. Perhaps the first film raised people's expectations too much, and it was a dystopian view of a world ruled by machines (like Terminator), though with the spin of high technology and virtual reality. Yet forget any deep analysis it is, more-or-less, action throughout. The second film picks up where the first began, continues the action and special effects and fills time for the third film to come around, which wraps it all up, with a positive, though slightly ambiguous ending for humanity. In a way, I feel the thing that hurt the trilogy wasn't so much the films (no worse than Empire Strikes Back and Return of The Jedi when compared to Star Wars, really), it's just their moment in the public imagination ended after the first film. Notably, perhaps, it is a reworking of an Oxford Professors work whose dramatization will be remembered fifty years after being conceived. Now surely the idea of that, in these times of Hi Tech, would be Fantasy/ Science Fiction.",1070150400,,1222,4.741784037558685
1466009,5,B00005JLTN,"I think too many people have the wrong idea about the series. The directers of the Matrix trilogy are big anime buffs. They set out to make the worlds best live action anime movie. Well, I think they did just that. You just have to keep in mind that anime movies take awhile to unfold. They usually come in pieces. They start off with the story to let people know whats up. Then they let loose the action, usually the main character going full force in some struggle for a specifice goal, Reloaded is just that. It consists of a whole lot of action in a way no one has ever seen it in real life. You also have to remember that its not a stand alone. Your lost without the last half and you don't get anything without the first one. In most anime series near the end the emotions are let loose because of the hard struggle they just finished off, this gives the characters a human emotional feel. Last the story comes to a conclusion. I'm sure the last movie does just that. Many people don't see the beauty of japanese anime, but the Matrix directers did and I think they did a wonderful job of bringing it to life.",1070150400,,1115,4.23943661971831
1466010,1,B00005JLTN,"After the brilliance of ""The Matrix"" I was terribly disappointed with this lame cash-in.  Every part of this movie was poor - the acting is shameful, the directing and editing is very, very poor - I got so bored that I had to force myself to actually stay in the theatre, the plot was awful, and ruined the brilliance of the first film's storyline, and the action sequences and special effects have not moved on at all since 1999.
This movie just stinks basically - you sit there and can't wait for the ending to come, it just seems to drag on and on with loads of boring rubbish and shoddy effects shots.  It is so bad that I am not even going to rent the third film or see it at the movies - the film-makers and studio do not deserve it.
Compare this to the stunning brilliance of the Lord of the Rings movies and it looks even worse.  While Reloaded has the Burly Brawl, The Two Towers completely embarasses it with the Helms Deep battle sequence.  And while the much longer Two Towers flies through while you are watching it, Revolutions is almost painful to watch.  It would be more fun to rub your back over a giant cheese grater - and certainly less painful.
In short, don't buy this DVD, don't watch any of the films at the movies - simply purchase the original Matrix on DVD and be done with this shambling, steaming load of crap.",1070150400,4,1339,4.318725099601593

Finally, what's missing from the DVD is something that would help us better understand what is going on in the movie. Instead we hear more about what clever projects the directors are planning to get more of our money. I would have like to see bios of some of the Matrix-world characters, or maybe the scene where one of the Zion characters was liberated from the Matrix. How was Zion built?

The Matrix (Episode I) was a watershed in the film industry. It had everything going for it: great direction, strong characters, great Kung-fu sequences unbelievably believable special effects, stimulating music, great (albeit scientifically inacurate) story line. And the concept of the Matrix, in itself was thought provoking.
In stark contrast, Reloaded has nothing going for it. The plot is stale, the freeze-frame action sequences are not so much fun the second time around, and most disapointingy, there are no strong characters in this film.
This is the same Neo, the same Morpheus and the very same Trinity who act in this film, but all three characters, together with the whole cast somehow seem artificial; much like the romance between Neo and Trinity.

The extras on Reloaded are minimal to say the least. There is no commentary track at all. I've heard that there will be a boxed set deluxe edition somewhere down the line for all 3 Matrix films and that is why there is almost nothing on this release. If that is the case then shame on the makers of this film for putting nothing on this disc simply to try and force us to buy all 3 films on DVD a second time.

I've seen infomercials and music videos with more substance than this.  Now keep in mind, I like cheesy sci-fi movies as long as they are somewhat entertaining and clever.  What we have here is a movie written on the back of a cocktail napkin.  Just some of the problems...
1. Never take your arch villain and replicate him hundreds of times (Agent Smith).  Not only is it silly and pointless, it takes away any menacing characteristics this villain may have had.
2. Never endow your hero with superman-like powers.  If he can do anything, it takes away any suspense.
3. Never intentionally obscure your plot with psycho-babble and cryptic references.
4. Never make an excellent sci-fi movie and then follow it up with a peice of garbage like this.  People will no longer think you were brilliant, they will just think you got lucky.
I cannot even begin to emphasize how bad this movie actually was.  The more I think about it, the worse it seems.  Because of this, I avoided ""Revolutions"" altogether and I won't even go near the DVD.

And the relationship between Neo (Keanu Reeves) and Trinity (Carrie Anne Moss) didn't seem believable. Yet I found myself watching Reloaded several times. Seems I like to pick it up when I need some adrenaline kicks inside, and some of the scenes truly deliver. Maybe the producers got too greedy.... Reloaded, however, didn't seem like a waste of effort and film when I started looking at it as a film on its own merits. I stepped away from my first Matrix DVD, not watching it for a while so I could make a better attempt at not moving towards comparing the two. When I did, I enjoyed Reloaded more.

1466105,5,B00005JLTN,"The Matrix Trilogy will remain one of the most argument's raiser between critics ,movie geeks ,mainstream Audience ,the loyal fans and the matrix's philosophy believers .
Actually the problem with The Matrix in general that it's a Huge multi layered world ,Actually a unique world created completely with details of it's own ,To make full understanding of this world you need several things ,One of them is the analytical ability to tie all the different keys and events together to form some vision about what's really happening , you simply can not view each one of the three movies like individual segments ,They are completely integral and viewing them as one unit is necessary to get the full picture ,Another thing  is that you have to have some background of Computer Sciences in general to make assumption for yourself and to understand completely the other assumptions introduced by it's creators (Especially in RELOADED) .
On the technical side RELOADED is simply a marvelous achievement ,The Special Effects were amazing ,Many people complained that there is nothing new after the bullet time ,But this is not right because simply the Bullet Time was not only a technique ,It was an INVENTION and inventions doesn't happen all the time ,What the Wachowskis done is improving it and it really were tweaked in RELOADED but some viewers didn't get rid off the feeling that they have seen the Bullet Time many many times before ,But this has nothing to do with the Wachowskis ,They have invented it and many entertainment forms ripped it from them , The fight scene where we watch neo fighting swarms of Agent Smith really proves that there are no limits for what they can do ,The other scene is the Highway chase which leaves you breathless during it's running time ,I haven't felt that there were overusing of the special effects at all ,You know they are in the Matrix world where no earthly rules are governing the characters ,And so the amazing fights were necessary to symbolize that ,The other elements like editing and musical score Along with the Decoration,Design and costume passed the test efficiently .
The wachowskis hits hard and solid this time ,With very huge budget they had a plenty of time and space to introduce what they want to say ,Their vision is marked for having no borders ,You are in some point in the movie and making anticipations or guessing about the forthcoming events ,they surprises you with ultimately different things ,And this leads us to discuss some aspects about The Matrix's World and the impact it have done on the cinema's Audience ,The problems that many complained about actually are several problems ,One of them is the Zion's people and their appearances but we have to be frank ,The movie is about a world where the machines is controlling it and only one place is left for al the surviving humans so what do you expect from them? do you expect them to be clean and shaven and wears the latest fashion models?! ,About the mass sex scene I think it was designed beautifully ,Just look where Neo And Trinity were making it and you will notice that the place is designed  in a Womb like shape ,It gives a reference for the creation of the humanity and the mass sex itself can be explained as human touch in a world threatened to be void of humans within a few hours ,It has been known that human beings in times of danger tends naturally to seek the warmth of other humans companion and this takes the form of the sexual festival we've seen ,The techno musical score  reflects the artificial nature of their surroundings .
Other people simply complained that the movie become very complicated ,That's may be right for the most of Mainstream Audience ,The whole trilogy needs an open mind willing to give a deep thinking sessions in order to get the message ,Many people of whom didn't like this movie were simply because they haven't understood it or simply thought about it as nonsense due to the large and heavy dose of philosophical battles ,Another people hated RELOADED because they had solid grounds based on the first Matrix movie ,Actually one Reloaded Excellency points came from taking the story in a whole new level and so it destroyed all of our beliefs granted from the first Matrix movie ,And this ofcource wasn't appealing for many viewers who didn't like the shaking new grounds beneath their feet's ,Some themes were implemented successfully to support the story like the scene where we see multiple copies of Agent Smith confronting Neo about The Purpose and how every BEING has an purpose ,In another scene where Persephone(Monica Bellucci) gets paid from Neo in order to show him the path to the Keymaker ,The way which she gets paid indicates her longing for humanity ,This added extra depth for the story and a new meaning for the humans to survive depending on their finding the humaninty  in the most unhumanable places ,This is another solid stone in the trilogy's Concrete ,So in order to enjoy RELOADED you to have to let your self get indulged in the Intensive action,Paralyzing discussions and the unbelievable atmosphere ,Set your mind free and you will enjoy a journey like no other journey .",1069632000,,5177,4.774553571428571
1466106,2,B00005JLTN,"Like most, I was excited for this second installment.  But it proved to be ultimately disappointing, coming nowhere close to meeting my expectations.
""The Matrix"" is a well-rounded film with high-quality visuals, good entertainment value, interesting and intellectual themes and tones, and all-round very re-watchable.
""The Matrix Reloaded"", however, suffers from a lack of what made the first film great; the action and visuals are almost over-done, themes are deglected, the script is weak, and the plot seems a bit thin.  In recognizing that this is the middle installment, there is room for a lack of substance in the plot, though, seeing as this film is meant to tie the other two together.
In terms of the visuals and action sequences being over-done, certain scenes were too long and drawn-out and over-the-top.  It felt as though they were there more as a means to show-off than to enrich the film.  (Whereas in the first film the action didn't detract from the overall goal of the film.  The sequences were also more thoughtful and more discreet -- it wasn't a matter of how ""cool"" a fight was, but how artful it appeared.)
There was definitely some unnecessary fluff in Revolutions, which does have its place, but only when it's not drawn-out and isn't simply bad.  (There's one scence/sequence I'm thinking of here, which is probably fairly obvious.  I though it could have been much more crisp and, well, shorter.)
This second installment did do a fairly good job of opening up new plot and theme elements -- creating some of the intellectual curiosity so prevalent in the first film. And while I think the film ended in the right direction, certain plot elements seemed to be going wayward.  Though I ultimately feel that the abruptness of the main revelations towards the end of the film were abrupt and overly-terse.  (And either refuted or left unexplained/unexplored in the final film.)
Revolutions submitted to the mold of an action film and didn't follow the more well-rounded original, leaving it absent of the necessary elements to create a cohesive trilogy.",1069545600,5,2079,4.985549132947977

The story, the puzles which made The Matrix so fun, is entirely missing here. You are plopped into the lives of the characters, they are as formed as they're going to get, and there's no growth. You don't feel any yearning from Neo to learn more about his role in the Matrix, Morpheus has nothing new to disclose, and Agent Smith has had his personality actually reduced.
The redeeming feature is the 15-minute ""freeway chase"" which is, for the action-lover, the best thing about the film. It's kinetic, highly charged, and fun. There's some humor in the action, too. Unfortunately, the rest of the film isn't as involving.

1466110,5,B00005JLTN,"My title for this review came from the weekend section of the Washington Post the week this film came out. I used it because it is my exact feeling about this movie.
In the first Matrix, we are witness to some of the most mind bending effects ever made, well, at least until this came out. In addition to those effects, we are also witness to a great, heavy story line. It was such a fresh idea. The best parts of the movie were with Morpheus and Neo, in the beginning, where everything is being explained. Wait, how does that work? The story being the best part? Whoa!
Flip the equation for this movie. The story takes the backseat, while the mind bending stuff gets to drive for a while. Now, don't get me wrong, I prefer it the other way too, but I sure don't mind watching Neo beat up lots of Agent Smiths in the impressive Burly Brawl sequence, and I sure don't mind watching the greatest scene that has anything to do with cars since ""Bullit"" and ""The French Connection"". I have to admit though, the bullet time stuff was overused. The beginning with Trinity comes to mind. I thought that sooner or later, they would slow it down when characters were walking down the street.
I don't get what people dislike about this movie. It still has story, which is evident with the visit to Zion, the Architecht and the best scene in the whole movie, the visit with the Oracle. The Oracle was why I liked the first one so much. She is so different from what her name suggests. She alone makes the movie worthwhile.
I could not concievably get through this reveiw without at least talking about the freeway scene a little. One word comes to mind: Whoa. This is what action fans live for, and what people who appreciate story more (like me) should cherish as one of the best chases in cinematic history. The combination of physical and digital effects is seemless, and the part in which the trucks collide is probably the greatest, most perfect effect ever.
I won't give away any more (in case anyone hasn't seen this movie), but I will say that this is very close to the original in terms of fun.",1069459200,,2091,4.419689119170984
1466111,4,B00005JLTN,"I will try to keep this short and sweet...
How many sequals were as good or better than the original?  Not many, I can venture you can come up with few.  Look at Star Wars... even the ""original"" Trilogy, Episode 4 was far better than 5 & 6, however, the trilogy as a whole was outstanding.  After seeing all three of the Matrix movies, I must say that this series beats the Star Wars Trilogy, and I was a die-hard Star Wars fan!  I looked at the series afterwards as a ""Biblical series for computer geeks.""
More specifically, I must say that Reloaded was probably the weakest of the three movies, only because nothing will ever beat the fresh and outstanding Special Effects of the Original, and the last one leaves you thinking and comparing to no end... but this is a must to see if you want to understand what the Brothers envisioned at the onset.  The highway scene is simply amazing, the Smith Character really takes form, and even though some of the CGI in this movie has some visual flaws (the Neo vs. Smith Clones fight especially), the film is still brilliant none-the-less.  The only part that I have had to review over and over is the part where Neo visits the Archeitect (sp)...  he talks very oddly, and I had to re-view that scene many times to finally get the point of what happened.

Just about everything in the movie besides the fight scenes is complete gibberish with no point in the movie. The whole dance rave, dirty scene, all the way through the meeting with the Architect, it's all a bunch of gibberish.
I left the theatre feeling confused because nothing was really solved or explained worth a flip. The biggest mistake in the movie is that it feels like it was based around fight scenes, instead of story. It should have been the other way around.",1069372800,4,830,4.653061224489796
1466113,3,B00005JLTN,"I'm not saying that this was a bad movie- it wasn't. The Matrix Reloaded provides a very intrinsic chapter in the Matrix saga. However, the plot is not half as amazing as the first or third movies, while watching those two, there is no other opportunity for thought in your mind. The fight scenes are impressive - as always- but they go on too long, past the climax, and start to feel rather dragged out. However, important new characters are introduced in this chapter (along with one of the coolest French baddies ever to hit the screen)
The DVD has tons of special features, which is always a nice plus. They include a preview for the Animatrix, whixh is also a very cool DVD in this series, providing background on the Osiris, as well as the new kid that follows Neo around in this second movie.
Overall, I'd say buy the DVD if you're in love with the matrix. It's not a bad buy, and it's certainly worth th money.... and it may help tide you over until Matrix Revolutions is released on DVD.",1069372800,4,996,4.418478260869565

1466155,4,B00005JLTN,"This was not one of the better movies of the year.  The storyline seemed forced and gimmicky.  It seemed as if the Wachowski brothers were concentrating too much on making more money rather than giving depth to the storyline.  Some parts of the movie were just plain stupid.  For example, the entire Zion scene was very close to being pointless.  Morpheus announces that robots are coming that way to destroy them and then everyone starts partying....Is it just me, or was something missing there.  Did these people want to die by the Sentinels, because when they heard they were coming that way, they sure started celebrating.  Also, the sex scene with Neo and Trinity was pointless.  It was informant to the few audience members who were still naive to the fact that they were in love while stating the obvious to the rest of the crowd.  They conveyed Neo and Trinity as being so in love that everytime they see each other, they had to kiss and make out.  Is it just me, or were the Wachowski brothers trying to cater to the teenage audience with this scene.  It seems as if their hormones are still raging and they have the curiousity of a 4th grader.  If that part of the story had any use at all, then I have no idea what it was for.
The action in this story was alright.  It wasn't great, but it wasn't the worst this world had seen, either.  On a comparison between all three of the movies, this one would rank number two, behind the original, yet ahead of the final one.

The Wachowski brothers and their team have definitely outdone themselves on that score. The fight scene between Keanu Reaves and the hundreds of Smiths has to be one of the best martial arts sequences on film (OK, maybe not). The special effects are crazy, with Neo (Reaves) gaining superman like powers that enables him to fly, and bounce off walls like Spiderman. That isn't new but there are more such sequences in the sequel.
The emotional attachment between Keanu Reeves and Carrie Ann Moss gets stronger and we see more of the human-side of Neo than we did in the Matrix. (I thought the sexual scenes in the film were unnecessary) Lawrence Fishburne doesn't fail to disappoint as the general with a dream who inspires the resistance. More characters are introduced like the twins with their crazy hair and ability to become temporarily invisible, the Keymaker, Jada Pinkett Smith (Morpheus' love interest) and the Chief architect...
The extras on this DVD are excellent, check out the MTV spoof with Justin Timberlake and that dude from `Dude where's my car'. It's funny, especially the Chief Architect part, a definite must-see.

The Matrix Trilogy has a wonderful storyline, and Reloaded is the most important of them. While the original sets up the storyline and the finale is all about the war and Neos battle with Smith, Reloaded answers a lot of questions and creates even more. I mean, the Wachowski brothers did make some good plot twists.
Each character seems unique, and every one is there to serve a purpose. I feel like the Keymaker could of been more developed, and his role should of been much more important. The Merovingian and his wife Persephone are examples of new characters that are fantastic.
I do not really care about special effects, but these were grand. The freeway chase was visually pleasing, especially sequences with the Twins. Also, Neos fight with the 100 Smiths was fun to watch. I love the song they play.
The DVD has some fairly good extras, if you are into documentaries on how the film is made. It also talks about the Animatrix, the Enter the Matrix video game, and includes the MTV Movie Awards parody of the Matrix Reloaded.",1069200000,,1172,4.639423076923077

I received this as a gift instead of the usual after shave or Hickory Farms gift pack and after viewing the movie was pleasantly surprised by the spectacular special visual effects and one of the most hair raising car / motorcycle chases on film.  I'm not that big into science fiction as I was when I was  younger and I was a bit worried about viewing a movie sequel without any idea what it's prdecessor was about. There was enough background to figure out the plot after a few minutes. I'll keep my review brief, after 1100+ reviews already, you probably have a good idea of what this movie offers. Sight unseen, I probably would not have bought this. After seeing The Matrix Reloaded (Widescreen Edition) I'm ordering the original Matrix and the third in the trilogy when it comes out. The DVD includes some extras but the one most worth watching is the making of the chase scene.  The stylized kung fu / Bruce Lee fight scenes were entertaining for the first few minutes.

1466163,2,B00005JLTN,"Few things can kill a movie series like success.
Just as George Lucas' ""Star Wars"" films have gotten increasingly unwatchable, the sequel to ""The Matrix"" already shows that success, money and hype have successfully insulated the Brothers Wachowski from criticism or even the ability for someone around them to question ""why is this action sequence so long,"" ""why is there a Mad Max rave scene with Morpheus totally acting out of character,"" ""what is the point of the whole sequence with the Merovingian,"" or, most importantly, ""why would you go two hours of nothing but action and then dump all this philosophy and obscure information on audiences in the final 10 minutes?""
It's especially frustrating because ""The Matrix"" had built up so much good will towards it that the brothers didn't need to pander to their audiences -- being just as smart as the first film wouldn't have been rejected by the audience, but instead, we get a vastly dumbed-down film that fails to wow, and certainly fails to elicit any enthusiasm for the third installment in the series.

Anyway, the Matrix Reloaded goes beyond the platitudes and enters the dangerous ground of confusion. The story spirals and gets quite complicated.

In George Liucas' ""Start Wars"" films, the latter is correct, while in Peter Jackson's ""Lord of the Rings"", the former is.
The original Matrix film also belonged to the former. I feel that many other viewers, like me, were expecting Matrix Reloaded to be more of the same. If so - we were all sorely disappointed. There are some new ideas and plot twists, and some cheesy philosophy about choices and understanding our motives for making them (therefore I give this movie 2 stars), but it is almost hidden behind too much SF and too many over elaborate fight scenes. Granted, this had also existed in the first Matrix. Why am I objecting now? Lets take the fight scenes, for instance.

True to the original Matrix the Wachowski Brothers created a massive world filled with amazing special effects and visual candy. The problem is the movie is SO BORING! Like George Lucas before them, the Wachowski brothers lost themselves in their own convoluted mytholgy, spending more time on sci fi babble than on characters and plot. There are countless points in the movie where we are forced to listen to the brothers' pretentious dialog that does nothing to move the story forward.
Whats with the fight scenes too? Did their sound editor actually use an effect of bowling pins being knocked down when Neo battles 100 agent Smiths? What could have been an really cool action scene felt more like a Road Runner cartoon. Even the kung-fu scenes lack speed, energy and suspense. You can sacrifice plot for really good action but when the action stinks, it really misses the mark. Yes, the car-motorcycle chase scene is incredible and but unless you are a die-hard Matrix fan I would encourage you to save it for a Friday night rental rather than make it part of your home dvd collection.",1068940800,,1147,4.797979797979798

In the first film the story was great and involved some deep development into the plot. It did have some exciting fight scenes and effects that paved a new road for CG. It was also still based on partial laws of physics. Reloded is a completely different story.
It seemed as though the film makers wanted to create the special effects industry all over again. By using very predictable CG it made the movie seem more like a cartoon then an action flic. The cheractors seemed to be invinceable from harm and be exempt from gravity and normal reality based physical laws. Neo could fly and take on countless phoes with ease which made the agents and mineons seem like much less of a threat, trinity could jump out a 65 story building, and morphious could battle on a truck at high speeds.....It just seemed so made up. If that is not enough, it contained some of the longest speeches i have ever herd. The machene who created the matrix (in the film) seemed so calm about the continuing murder and distruction that was taking place in his world. If he indeed desired perfection why would he let humans run amok leveling buildings and freeways. I was very stunned at the out of place and completely unnecessary rave/love scene. Not something that would normally be seen in an action film.

1466202,4,B00005JLTN,"Following the phenomenal success of the 1999 film ""The Matrix"", Andy and Larry Wachowski returned to write and direct the much-anticipated 2003 sequel, ""The Matrix Reloaded"".  Returning to their previous roles are Keanu Reeves as ""Neo"", Carrie-Anne Moss (who played Natalie in the 2000 film ""Memento"") as ""Trinity"", Laurence Fishburne as ""Morpheus"", Gloria Foster (1933-2001) as ""The Oracle"" and Hugo Weaving as ""Agent Smith"".  Hugo Weaving is also well known for his portrayal of ""Elrond"" in the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy (2001-2003), as well as playing drag queen ""Mitzi Del Bra"" in the 1994 Australian film ""The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert"".  Several newly introduced characters in the sequel include Helmut Bakaitis as ""The Architect"", Randall Duk Kim as ""The Keymaker"", Harry J. Lennix as ""Commander Lock"", Jada Pinkett Smith as ""Niobe"", Harold Perrineau Jr. (who played the poetic Prisoner #95H522 Augustus Hill in the 1997-2003 HBO series ""Oz"") as ""Link"", Anthony Zerbe (whose first big screen role was ""Dog Boy"" in the 1967 ""Cool Hand Luke"") as ""Councilor Hamann"" and Lambert Wilson as ""Merovingian"".
As with the 1999 ""The Matrix"", the special effects used in ""The Matrix Reloaded"" are phenomenal.  Some of the best include Neo's battle with the multiple Agent Smiths, the sentries, Neo's ability to fly in the matrix, the freeway scene and Trinity's fall.  As for the plot, Neo has a recurring dream of Trinity battling an agent inside of the matrix.  He and Trinity are madly in love with one another.  Morpheus is steadfast in his belief of The Oracle, which doesn't set well with his commander, Commander Lock.  Not seen previously in the first 1999 film is the city of Zion, an underground human city that exists outside of the matrix and the machines that control it, but the machines are determined to destroy Zion and its free inhabitants.  While the machines unleash an all-out attack upon Zion, Morpheus, Trinity and Neo venture back into the matrix to obtain what they believe is vital information from The Oracle to the dismay of Commander Lock.  Along the way, Neo (and the audience) learns much more about the nature of the matrix, it's architect and the many programs that appear human still operating within the matrix, but not under its direct control.
The plot of ""The Matrix Reloaded"" is arguably somewhat weaker than the original 1999 film ""The Matrix"", but the sequel serves its purpose well of both continuing and expanding upon the original story.  The overall story is very similar to Buddhist belief in questioning the nature of reality: the physical world is essentially an illusion, and that each individual must awaken from a dream-like state (i.e., unplugged from the matrix) to obtain enlightenment to see the true nature of reality.  Overall, I give ""The Matrix Reloaded"" a 4-star rating.  It is a very entertaining and engaging film, but the first twenty to thirty minutes could have been hastened a bit.",1068940800,5,2963,5.034764826175869

Most of the characters in the first film were asexual.  Cipher, the Judas of the group, was the only really libidinous character from the first movie.  His desire was portrayed as evil, and so he was killed (Mouse was killed, too for manufacturing the woman in the red dress).  Yet soon into the sequel is an uncalled for orgy; likewise, Trinity and Neo are all over each other.  These kinds of inconsistent thematic movements from the first to the sequel ruined the film for me.  The changes were not at all interesting.
This sequel also relied too heavily on telling rather than showing.  Remember the first film and the emotion in Morpheous' face when Neo asked him why his eyes hurt?  He looks sadly at Neo and tells him that he's never used them before.  Story, plot, emotion, etc. were well mixed in the first film.  Yes, the first film imparted much information to the viewer, but all of us felt like Neo: New to the ship and new to the real world, we needed an explanation.  The sequel doesn't have this grace.

The movie is a wonderful sequel to the first film, as is Revolutions (the two movies were really supposed to be one, but it was too long and so it was split into two movies, a la Kill Bill, and also probably Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire).  And despite what many uninformed people have said, the sequels were always planned.  It was planned as a series, not just one film.
The movie is full of great action, incredible special effects, and a wonderful story.  It's several years since the first film and the machines are starting to decend on Zion to wipe it out.  Neo and his buddies must enter the Matrix to try to find out anything they can to stop it from happening.
The movie's mood is much more somber and deep than the first one.  It's rife with themes such as the nature of choice and do we actually have free choice, or is everything pre-ordained?  Also the conequences of those choices.
I will admit the whole love/rave scene in Zion was a bit pointless in an otherwise flawless movie.",1068940800,3,1129,4.451456310679611
1466205,2,B00005JLTN,"Arriving four years after the original, The Matrix Revolutions should have delivered action from start-to-finish since we've already had over 2 hours of set-up. Doesn't happen. Instead we get many, many scenes of long, rhetorical dialogue that wants to be deep and meaningful but instead comes across as pompous and boring. This is what happens when filmmakers are given free reign without studio interference. Damned if you do and damned if you don't, I guess.

With the machines digging their way down to Zion, Neo, Trinity and Morpheus clash with the Council and various superiors on how to deal with the oncoming assault. You'd think the last thing they have time for is lots of pretentious talking.

None of the many, superfluous fight scenes are exciting. They are virtually all about blocking. There is no real impact. Watching people twirl five times sideways after a soft kick to the chest doesn't make up for it. I can't understand how anybody has ever been impressed or entertained by these stupid, impossible physics.

Keanu Reeves ain't no actor, but I can deal with it most of the time. However, Carrie-Anne Moss is very easy to look at, and Agent Smith owns every scene he's in. I do appreciate Monica Belluci's translucent dress too.

It's an effort to get through this film. I've only watched it twice since it came out in 2003. There's just no reason to go back to it. There are films half the length, with a tenth of the budget, that have more action, and coherence.",1068940800,5,1485,4.766536964980545
1466299,4,B00005JLTN,"I liked the movie...in fact, I liked it a lot. But, I liked the first movie better. There might be a few reasons for this...maybe the whole concept of the matrix and all the ideas were new and interesting then and this movie isn't as provocative on that level, but I think I also liked the first movie because it seemed more organic. The good and the bad were clearly..or at least more clearly, defined. This movie isn't quite that way. But...other than that, this movie was great.
A word of caution, there is a sexually explicit scene in the movie...Neo and Trinity...umm...imitate bunnies for a short segment and the population of Zion imitates a rave hopped up on E. Other than that, there really isn't any sex...just lots and lots of violence. The movie is rated R...for the sexuality, violence and the language. So, if you're gonna be upset by those things and you can't look beyond them to see the great philosophic themes of the movie, then don't go see it.
Another word of caution: if you're pregnant or have a history of heart problems, this movie probably isn't for you. It is an adrenaline rush from the first 20 seconds until the end.
Special Effects: The special effects were amazing. The stunts, explosions, camera angles and everything are just incredible. If you're interested in finding out how they did some of the stuff (such as the ""Burly Brawl"" scene), you might want to search google for a wired.com article about it. The freeway car/truck/motorcycle chase scene is incredible...I've never seen anything like that before in any movie. The fighting, the choreography...everything is incredible. The movie is unsurpassed in visual goodness. I guess you have to see it to believe it...but it is simply amazing.
Philosophy: If you thought the philosophic and messianic and theological themes in the first movie were excessive, this movie isn't for you. Reloaded is totally full of philosophy and theology. From a discussion of salvation between Neo and ""the kid"" to Neo's outright fight with the idea of determinism that seems to follow the course of the movie. This isn't man against the machines, this movie pits Neo himself against determinism. This movie is all about free will and determinism, and I think the ideas of ignorance in choice will play a major part in the next movie. If you like philosophy, the ""boring parts"" of the movie (boring according to the people sitting behind me) will be absolutely fascinating. I don't think I missed or zoned out for any of the dialogue...it was so key...even the corny one-liners which one person in particular that I talked to didn't like.
Basically, the movie had a lot of stuff that I really liked, and if you like martial arts, fights, guns, cars, philosophy or computers, this is probably a movie you'll want to check out. If you don't like those things, but you do like Keanu Reeves..., you'll want to check this movie (unfortunately you see a lot of him).
However, the entire movie seemed sort of inorganic to me. The parts of the first movie that I didn't like were the parts where they were in the ""real world"" which was the hovercraft flying in and out of weird sewers and stuff and the parts I liked were when they were in the matrix. Unfortunately for me, this movie has a lot of the ""real world"" scenes...
However, other than those few detractions, I enjoyed the movie a whole lot, and I'll watch it over and over and I'm looking forward to seeing Revolutions in an IMAX.",1068854400,19,3451,4.71523178807947

Sadly, Reloaded continues an already complete story with the expected results. The plot is virtually non-existent, the action scenes are meaningless and tacked-on, and the talking-head exposition is among the most boring and amateurish ever put to film. This DVD is for hardcore cultist fans only, and those who like quality movies will surely be disappointed.",1068768000,,790,4.8161764705882355

1466305,3,B00005JLTN,"""The Matrix Reloaded"" was a difficult movie for me to review.  I saw it theatrically in the summer of 2003 and then I saw it yet again on DVD very recently.  A seamless melange of martial arts, science fiction, and Christian overtones, 1999's ""Matrix"" was both an unexpected smash hit and ignited a cultural phenomenon in the age of digital video.  The Wachowski brothers, who directed the movie, were faced with the daunting task of topping themselves, which they don't quite do on the sequel ""Reloaded.""  Here is a film that's intermittently thrilling, sometimes boring, and often confusing.  Never mind that Keanau Reeves, as an actor, is as wooden as mahogany furniture; what really matters are the stunts, which range from good to breathtaking.  Highlights include an extended car chase and a scene featuring Neo (Reeves) going to battle with tens of Smiths (the underrated Hugo Weaving).  New to the cast is the ever-striking Jada Pinkett Smith, who, as Niobe, doesn't have much to work with, but makes the most of what little screen time she is given.  But as soon as the action stops, ""Reloaded"" hits some bumps with long stretches of dialogue that, quite frankly, are tedious to listen to.  And there's a long, pointless ""rave scene"" that seems to go on and on and doesn't quite fit in with the rest of the picture.  If any clip belongs in the ""deleted scenes"" section, it's this one.  While I'm not as rabid a fan of ""The Matrix"" as some people are, I was somewhat entertained by ""Reloaded.""  But for all its stunning visuals I couldn't help noticing that it also lacked the unexpected punch of its predecessor.  Maybe a better title for this movie would have been ""The Matrix Unloaded.""",1068681600,5,1697,4.77054794520548

There, on big screens all across the globe, was a movie daring to tell the truth about the perceptual prison that humanity finds itself trapped in. While many appreciated the movie for its stunning looks and breakthrough special effects, what made the Matrix film so successful was its ability to twist your mind as much as the now famous ""bullet cam"" twisted your view. The final installment leaves the unlearned observer with a stunning illustration of what can only be understood as Illuminati sabotage.""

1466307,4,B00005JLTN,"In my opinion this second isntallment of ""The Matrix"" trilogy was better than the first one.  The fight scenes were better and the special effects and stunt work were outstanding, even surpassing those of the first movie.  Of course, once again, this is a movie that you must really pay attention too.  I found myself lost at times, with holes in plot that I couldn't quite figure out.  Hopefully the third installment will fill these holes in.  Although not really my normal type of movie I found myself enjoying this one.  Although it would pay to see the first one before watching this one I think if you take it at face value you might not be any more lost that I was if you didn't see the first one.
The concept that the movies are based on is deep for me to think about.  The fact that life could be an actual computer program.  That we could be nothing more than programmed entities.  These deep thoughts that you could bounce around again and again are intriguing.
Bottom line, in my opinion, enjoyable but not outstanding.",1068508800,,1031,4.5
1466308,5,B00005JLTN,"Yeah, that's right I thought this movie was excellent with the exception of the rave sence which was just out of place i think.  I find little else to gipe about here.  It is a visual master piece that throws a few tidbits of philosiphy at you to make you think about the true relationship between the two sides in the film.  I found Reloaded to be more enjoyable than the first Matrix, truth be told I actually fell asleep during the first one(of course I saw it at 1 in the morning ;)).  This compaired to Shotgunning a large soda during the previews in Reloaded yet I was forced to hold it in since I could bring myself to miss a minute of it.  My favorite parts of this film were the highway fight scene and the conversation with The Achitect.  This movie has more action than the first and stil manages to throw you questions about what is really going on.  Why this movie is so commonly bashed escapes me, my only guess would be do to the hype.  As a dvd this is also a film with extras that I actually watched...yes I watch them all and found them fascinating.  I don't recomend you listen to all those disgruntled reviews out there, they are mostly passionate people who are angry that it is not like the matrix while simultaniously angry that it is too similar to the matrix.  While they are busy not making up their minds I suggest you go and buy this dvd because it is great fun to watch, and isn't that why we watch movies in the fist place, to be entertained?",1068508800,4,1472,4.243727598566308

1466379,3,B00005JLTN,"I didn't quite know what to expect going into ""The Matrix Reloaded,"" and I came out with mixed feelings. This is a sequel to the 1999 film that enthralled audiences. I was a bit underwhelmed by the original, and so I figured the sequel would either be better given my disappointment in the first, or even worse. There's no doubt it's a good film, but it has some very bleak, almost corny scenes with long, metaphorical speeches. There is either too much or too little thought put into this film.
It takes place, supposedly, a few days after the original. Neo can fly, Trinity wears tighter and shinier leather costumes, and Morpheus is fatter. Neo dreams that Trinity dies in the opening sequence. Then back in Zion they realize that 250,000 sentinals are digging their way into Zion. In order to stop something they need something that does something which involves, though does not limit to, (...), kissing Persephone (Monica Belluci), rescuing a Keymaker, having a long car chase, beating up people, cloning Unleashed Agent Smiths (who appears not nearly as often as the trailer would lead you to believe), and blowing up things.
This film's plot goes to waste very quickly and so it falls back on special effects. They're great, yes, but not very different from all the ""Matrix""-rip-off films we've been getting since the original. The beginning sequence wows the audience with terrific special effects, but later in the film they must have run short on their budget because Neo's fight with the million Agent Smiths (...) Either one works.
(...)""The Matrix Reloaded"" really only has some good action scenes, which includes a highway chase atop of cars, trucks, motercycles and more, that goes on and on for seventeen minutes. Action fans will eat it up.
But it's not exactly the smartest of films. It thinks it's really smart, it tries to prove it, but scenes like that with ""The Architect"" (NOT the Archeologist) prove the movie is out of ideas. It tries to continue the smartness and freshness of the first film and tries to have revelations, but they confused me because the film moved through all the plot scenes too quickly so they could return to the action. Maybe they will be all sorted out in ""The Matrix Revolutions,"" which opens in November. I certainly hope so.
""The Matrix"" may not have been one of my favorite films but I did like it to a certain degree. It seemed pretty smart and a breakthrough achievment in special effects. It targeted all filmgoers - from sci-fi to action to drama to romance - whereas ""The Matrix Reloaded"" really only targets two audiences - die-hard fans of the original and sci-fi-lovers. That's probably one of its biggest of many flaws.
But it is still a pretty good movie.",1068422400,2,2720,4.777070063694268
1466380,5,B00005JLTN,"It is a fact about sequels - almost all of them don't live up to the originality and quality of their predecessor. Perhaps this is simply because the first is the first and the second and third are no longer introducing a new idea or concept. Therefore, it is very difficult to have the audience more surprised and amazed by the second and third.
Although the Matrix Reloaded is a sequel to a great and hard to beat original, it is still a very refreshing and entertaining sequel that pretty much lives up to its hype. Plenty of great fight scenes, as there were in the first Matrix, make Reloaded a fun ride from beginning to end. Having just seen the third(Matrix Revolutions) of the Matrix trilogy,which was very good but was my 3rd favorite of the 3,i can say that the Matrix Reloaded was definately a close second best to the original. The Matrix Reloaded is definately a worthy buy - you will want to at least watch these fight scenes many times - so you don't want to waste your money renting the movie over and over again. The DVD also comes with a bonus disc, with some interesting extra features about Reloaded to check out.",1068422400,3,1134,4.456730769230769
1466381,5,B00005JLTN,"There are a lot of great ideas out there regarding the story of this movie trilogy. The wachowskis are probably sitting back reading what everyone has to say and just loving it. After seeing this movie about 5 more times, (prior to watching revolutions on imax) and taking in a few more reviews, I think I'm close to solving this thing!
 Someone spoke of the struggle in the matrix being similar to all these goals we set in life that really don't mean crap.(You don't see Tahitians engaged in class struggles or ladder climbing career moves!) The harder we work, the more life throws at us. The better Neo gets, the better Smith gets. Humans have learned to tap into the machine world, so doesn't it make sense that machines can tap back into the human world (BAIN). Smith learns how to gain control of others, like a virus, which in the first movie he cliams is the problem with humans, (because they HAD CONTROL of machines.) Neo ups the stakes by gaining control of the machines at the end of reloaded. Neo finally realizes at the end of reloaded that his existence is not about being the ONE, or attaining the power of the one. Life is not about goals, it has no meaning, it is simply meant to be lived and loved. Which is why at the very center of this trilogy is a tribal rave/ and love scene. A celebration of life, and its most passionate moment!
 For those who have not seen revolutions, I won't divulge anything here, but as you watch any of these movies, know that you will need to see them at least 3 times to take in what is trying to be said. This is so much more than an action movie. sorry if this is scattered, its late!

1466382,4,B00005JLTN,"The Matrix Reloaded is not as good as the original classic but it's a very good follow up none the least. Keanu Reeves is back as Neo, the savior of mankind against the machines and Hugo Weaving is back as his archenemy Agent Smith. This is the second movie of the series, and while it does get too involve with its post-apocalyptic philosophies, it's a pretty good follow up.",1068336000,,376,4.463768115942029
1466383,2,B00005JLTN,"The mark of a special effects driven film that has the unmistakable cachet of being memorable is a function both of how often it is viewed after its original release and whether it has elements other than special effects going for it.  These two marks are related in that long term critical and popular acclaim depend on their interaction.  With THE MATRIX RELOADED, the brother directors Wachowski try to build on the short term success of its prequel THE MATRIX.  In this latter film, they had reasonable success in postulating a world that was a simulation of its sleeping humans who were cared for by their machine masters.  This interesting philosophical underpinning combined with some startling special effects stamped THE MATRIX as a good, but not quite very good science fiction movie.  In this Part II, the brothers Wachowski flirt with, rather than delve into, the tension inherent in a world that was not all it seemed to be and a world fought over by unsleeping humans and attacking machine squid creatures.  When the very basis of the film's aesthetic core is hidden murkily by frequent glimpses of these tentacled devices that do little more than flop around on command, then what remains is a motivation that has nowhere to go.  On a stylistic level, this aimlessness of drive is matched by an equally aimless series of montages that feature gravity-defying leaps, elaborate martial arts bouts with no one getting hurt, and a freeway chase that looks more like computer-enhanced car crashes than a filmed set piece with real stunt drivers racing up and down in their equally real automobiles.  With all these unintegrated special effects, the result is to place the viewer in the uncomfortable position of trying to care about characters who seem fated never to suffer actual harm.  Even when co-star Carrie Moss, who as Trinity, gets shot by a slug that in other scenes no one had trouble dodging, her fate is as lackluster as that of the titular hero, Neo, played by Keanu Reeves.  Reeves plays Neo as some impossible combination of Superman and Jesus Christ.  Yet, his flying and resurrection abilities do not add up to a film populated by believable characters.  Not for one second in any of the film's interminable fight sequences did I believe that Reeves was in any mortal danger.  What this second in a projected trilogy boils down to is a film that is fun to watch, but as the viewer approaches mid-point, he begins to hope for something other than special effects to hook onto.  The early returns on the third movie, MATRIX REVOLUTIONS, suggests that the Wachowski brothers are continuing the same dreary route that began with the second half of THE MATRIX.",1068336000,5,2683,4.855263157894737
1466384,3,B00005JLTN,"I have mixed emotions about this movie.  On the one hand, it was definately a movie that made ya think a lil bit.  An interesting, and often confusing, storyline that acts as a perfect bridge within the trilogy.  The fight scenes were a bit more daring at times, which helped fill in the spaces between important story lines.  On the other hand, it was almost TOO confusing, and also pretty cheesy.  Zion, which was only mentioned in the first movie, looked like some big religious/techno fest, with roots in Star Trek, as opposed to the underground army I had pictured.  The whole dance/sex sequence was too long, and just went over the top.  The scene at the end of the movie, where Neo (who can fly apparently) swoops down to save Trinity was damn stupid.  Did we really need that kind of sappy love crap?  I understand the two characters are in Love, but I think the rest of the movie showed us that.  Trying to prove to the audience just HOW in love they are by doing that whole ""Trinity, I can't live without you..."" stuff is just lame.  It was the one part of the movie where they were definately trying to make it look like the first, and failed at doing so.
As for the ugly, well, I know these new computer effects are supposed to be the greatest thing to happen to movies since color, but during some of the scenes I felt like I was watching Shreck in High Octane mode.  Computer effects are great, when they're not over done.  The whole Neo vs. Smith(s) battle was a good idea to show some cool moves by Neo, but once the computer took over I felt like I was watching a cartoon.  It just seemed a lil tacky.  Most of the interstate scene better, except for Morpheus vs. the Agent on top of the truck--too much of it looked like computer animation.  Just didn't cut it for me.
But, overall, the movie is entertaining.  I can't wait to see Revolution here pretty soon.  I'd kinda hope the twins came back, as they were a pretty tough duo who should've gotten more screen and story time.  Great villians are hard to come by.  And as great of a villian that Smith was in the first Matrix film, in this one he just seems annoying more than anything else.  I still don't quite get why he's there.",1068249600,2,2201,4.332518337408313
1466385,5,B00005JLTN,"In a time when there are so many brilliant silver screen masterpieces hitting the theaters and DVD racks, the Matrix series stands out among the top series of movies as one of the finest.  As seminal as ""The Matrix"" was in movie making, ""The Matrix Reloaded"" takes that innovation and sets a much higher mark in movie making originality as it only the second in the series but truthfully just the first half of the brilliant conclusion to the story set up in ""The Matrix.""
Few movies or series of movies entertain on multiple levels such as The Matrix series and particularly ""The Matrix Reloaded"" does; between the action and the undeniably brilliant script that is enlightening yet leaves enough open to question that you find you must see the third movie ""The Matrix Revolutions"" to get to the finale of this essential and cinematically brilliant movie going experience.
Keanu Reeves, Laurence Fishburne, Carrie-Anne Moss, Hugo Weaving, Jada Pinkett Smith and all of the other actors all deserve any and all accolades and awards they receive for their respective roles in this astonishing film.
The Wachowski brothers, Andy and Larry both have with this series proven what extraordinary creators they can be in the film industry.  From the intelligent script to the astonishing action sequences, ""The Matrix Reloaded"" entertains on every level!  The score for the film is ""spot on"" perfect for every scene.
The Premise:
How can you top a line such as Morpheus asking Link where Neo is and he replies that ""He's doing his Super Man thing?""
After the exciting conclusion to ""The Matrix"" - Xyon is now threatened with one sentinel per man; woman and child, totaling 250k, digging their way towards it and those in power are trying to find a way to stop them!  Meanwhile, Morpheus believes that the answer is not within the real world but with Neo and within the Matrix.
Neo now finds that he must seek out the Oracle once again to hopefully get some of the answers to his questions but he only finds more questions and he soon finds that Agent Smith is not dead and he has some very ""creative"" new talents.  Morpheus, Trinity and Neo learn that they must find the key maker in order to get to some of their answers but they must go through some of the most exciting action sequences and some extraordinary characters to get to them...
If you're looking for one of the most enjoyable thrill rides and intellectually challenging scripts to ever be put to film, ""The Matrix Reloaded"" is definitely for you!  I highly recommend not only this film but the first one and the last one as well.  Few, if any, movies entertain on so many levels as does the Matrix series.  This DVD most certainly deserves a hallowed spot on the DVD rack!

1466463,3,B00005JLTN,"The Matrix Reloaded is the sequel to smash sci-fi hit: ""The Matrix.""  The problem with this though? It's a sequel, meaning that it'll only bridge the first one to the third one, and all the really cool scenes in the first one aren't cool anymore.
The acting in this movie isn't bad.  Surprisingly enough it's pretty good.  The characters are still the ones we saw from the first Matrix movie, and introducing new ones.  But the new characters don't play any major role in the movie.  Niobi, for example, doesn't do much in the movie.  We don't get to see her fight or anything.  She plays a larger role in the third movie, thank goodness, but the fact that she's only a character to take space is an utter waste of film.
As many have said, the fight scenes are actually kind of boring.  They were fun but long.  Seeing Neo beat up 1000 Agent Smiths is nice but the scene began to grow long and boring.  I wanted the movie to move on at some point.  Plus, Neo has the ability to stop bullets and such, and that took the fun out of another fight scene that also lasted too long.  Not to mention that slow downs are used at times that I don't think they should've been (we watch the scene slow down while they're shooting at each other on the highway...why? The first one executed this PERECTLY but this one only wants to ""look"" cool).
Also, my number one gripe, WHERE WAS THE PLOT!  The first got me worked up on this plot and Reloaded ignores the plot for the first hour or so.  When the plot finally comes into play they just throw it at you and leave a lot of holes (that the sequel fills in thank goodness).  So as I said, it's only a bridge to the third movie.
On a final note, the movie got too much hype.  A lot of hype tends to make a movie worse!  Why? Because we expect so much more than what we see.  Everyone talked about how awesome the plot was, and it's absent from the majority of the movie.  Not only that but to understand it better you have to watch ""The Animatrix"" and play the game ""Enter the Matrix"".  Again though, a lof of these holes are filled in during the third part.
Reloaded was actually a satisfactory movie, but I was a little upset at the fact that Neo doesn't have enough emotions and that Agent Smith is just there...the movie doesn't go into enough detail on just HOW he became able to multiply himself or just WHAT his intentions are.  Again, the third one answers.
Still worth it to go see at least once.  The first one was great but it just had a level of superiority that no other Matrix movie could ever top. Not even this one.",1068163200,4,2566,4.2366255144032925

Oh yeah, and LOTS of thinly-veiled attempts to get viewers to buy all the ancillary merchandise.

""The Matrix Reloaded"" brings back the human forces to fight the machines in defense of the last city in the world, the city Zion. Neo (Keanu Reeves) wears black pajamas and can fly around like Superman. Why didn't he just fly away from all of those agents in the first place? You would think ""The One"" would be smarter than that. Of course I'm smarter than that. Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne) is in the best part of the movie where a chase goes onto a freeway and causes mass destruction. Even though his car was shot up, the windows kept breaking in every shot. Super glass. When he gets out of the car, he pulls out a sword and rids a couple of ugly twins with filthy dreadlocks. The creator of the Matrix should've been Will Ferrell.

You're better off sticking to the fawning 5-star reviews to validate your decision. (And to the reviewer who wrote that this was the ""Greek Tragedy of the XXI Century"", now THAT'S really funny. Thanks.)
There's not  enough pot in the world to make me think that this film is anything more than an over-blown college dorm fantasy, from the stoooopid, endless ""rave"" sequence in Zion's catacombs (wow, didn't know living underground all your life can still give you such beautiful skin!) to the awful dialogue during that restaurant scene. I estimate that that scene alone must've had 15 pages of script devoted entirely to yammering. And this is supposed to be an action flick?
In all, the film was plodding, boring and lame, including the action sequences. And the ""philosophy"" that we're supposed to take away from it is downright laughable. I think the Wachowski Brothers had too much money and too many bong hits when they made this.
By the time the Frenchman showed up I didn't know or care what he was supposed to be. Human? Program? Loki? Id? Cupid? Maybe he's just French, and that's good enough. Yeah, and so's the exit because I nearly walked out by this point. I'd like to say I had the munchies, but truth is, I didn't give a rat's what was going to happen next.
Oh, and here's another doozy that is stripped right from the pages of Maxim: if Trinity lets this hottie (the Frenchman's wife) smoke Neo, Planet Earth could be saved. I'm not kidding. Make sense? Of course not. Reefer to my earlier comment about the Wachowskis' influences.
And as to the whole Matrix  phenomenon, I'm beginning to think  it's really for crybabies my age (30s) who see this as some sort of adolescent video-game fantasy to deliver them from their imaginings of a controlling, corporate lifestyle. Boo hoo. Of course these fanboys worship Neo the Hero: ""I get to be cool and aloof, a kick-butt karate expert, wear shades, and be an Internet Messiah. I even get the hottest babe, too! Yesssssss!."" Yeah, I identified with those values. When I was 14.

This is one sequel that should not have been forced. The storyline has a lot of potential. It just seems that deadline was approaching and this drivel was dished out instead. Some parts are so far fetched so that they just seem ridiculous. I am a big fan of The Matrix and this is probably why I don't care for this flick. Everything that made the first so special is gone. This is just another example of marketing sequels that don't do the series justice in order to cash out on die hard fans. Maybe the third will be so awe inspiring I'll forget how bad this one is.

1466471,5,B00005JLTN,"Without a doubt, Matrix Reloaded is just simply the best movie right now.  Following the big hit, The Matrix, Reloaded keeps people glued to their seats the entire movie.  The fight scenes are just unbelievable, although a little unrealistic, but that is how it has to be.  I am tired of people claiming that the fight scenes were too fake.  Come on, it is Neo, THE ONE, of course it is going to be fake.  He is fighting agents and computer programs, so of course it will be a little ""out there"".  Matrix Reloaded keeps the viewers wondering because it is very confusing.  There are so many twists in the movie that you never know what to expect.  The ending was a perfect money-maker for the directors but upsetting for viewers.  Everyone has to wait until The Matrix Revolutions comes out so they can finally find out what is going on.  Very confusing but the best movie of the year.
The Matrix had some great fight scenes, especially the all so famous gun scene (Neo and Trinity unload on a numerous amount of guards) but the Matrix Reloaded has a different kind of excitement.  The freeway scene is all too interesting it just makes you want to watch it over and over.  There is also another unbelievably long fight scene with Neo showing off his fancy new moves.  A must see movie. But don't try to pick up by just watching this one.  If you haven't seen the first Matrix, don't even try watching this one until you have.  It is too confusing to try to get by just watching The Matrix Reloaded.
If I could give this movie a rating higher than five stars, I would.  Unfortuanetely we don't, so five will have to do.  Be sure to catch this exciting movie so you are ready for the final one.  Speaking of which, it comes out today, Wednesday, November 5.",1067990400,,1756,4.417445482866044

1466494,2,B00005JLTN,"I loved the first Matrix movie.  It was innovative and fresh; its characters were interesting and real--including the bad guys, such as Cypher (Joe Pantoliano); the special effects were top-notch; it had a plot.
The Matrix is everything that Reloaded is not.  The newly-introduced characters are paper-thin, and the only character development with our heroes Neo and Trinity is that they've gone to the next step in their relationship.
The fight scenes are tedious, stiff, over-choreographed, and overdrawn--Neo vs. 100 Agent Smiths?  Zzzzz.  The CGI looks bad at times (such as the freeway scene, which is probably the most interesting part of the movie).  The plot?  What little there is, I think they stole from Ghostbusters--something to do with a Keymaster (no Gozer here, though).
This was a very disappointing movie.  The worst part of the success of the second and third installments in the Matrix series is that it will give the Wachowski brothers the go-ahead to make more pretentious, self-indulgent video-games disguised as movies.",1067990400,2,1043,5.246987951807229
1466495,5,B00005JLTN,"The beginning scene of `The Matrix Reloaded' is a torrent of falling code: representational symbols trickling down from a higher `source' to the innumerable mediaverse-enslaved masses below.  Then the code shifts, spinning out like shards of random meme-generated illusion, and images emerge from the code: a nebula spreading out in full aeon-swirl glory; kanji-esque icons rotating in mechanical precision; and finally, the gears and numerical impression (04...05...06) of a desk-clock striking the midnight mark.  The movie itself then unfolds before the viewer in a way quite similar to the fleeting seconds of this opening scrawl: the Matrix Reloaded is a clockwork onion, with more and more layers stripping away as one makes a (conscious) effort to penetrate the surface-glare of CGI, the onslaught of physics-mandated impossibility, the kitchen sink approach to spectacle... with the visual-triggers stripped away, all that remains are the basic questions of human existence: what is truth? What is freedom...and control? How does one fight oppression and fashion a better tomorrow? This movie is _deep_, and IMO has more `testicular fortitude' than any mainstream offering from Hollywood since Fincher's necronerd epic `Fight Club.'
The story: the last human refuge, Zion, has grown too dangerous for the Matrix and its AI controllers, and an army of 250,000 sentinels have been sent to destroy the rebellious populace.  As Zion prepares for war, Neo, ultra-hacker and supposed savior of mankind, searches inside the Matrix labyrinth for the clues he needs to stop the attack.  Neo can fly, stop bullets, and even take on the replicating virus of his arch-nemesis Smith... but, without the knowledge of who he is and what the Matrix represents, even Neo, the post-modern superhero, is but a lost soul following crumbs in the woods; a tool utterly ignorant of his true purpose.  This concept sits rather uncomfortably with the average archetype-programmed fan (hence the numerous negative reviews on this page), but the tagline for this installment of the franchise is, after all, ""free your mind.""
The spectacle: The first movie of this trilogy revolutionized special effects with its seamless ""bullet-time"" approach and won an Oscar for the effort.  Subsequently, these effects were copied and replicated to the point of parody: another notch on Baudrillard's walking-staff.  The visual effects team at ESC knew they had to go above and beyond, and boy did they ever, inventing a new technology dubbed ""virtual camera"" that, unfortunately, this DVD sheds very little light upon.  I suppose they don't want Bulletproof Monk 2 copying them so rapidly...or, more likely, they are saving the big documentaries for the inevitable box set.
Let us take the much-maligned Smith fight for example.  People complain that it was ""too long"" and ""too fake""...and upon the first viewing, I would be inclined to agree.  But multiple viewings have unveiled the CGI illusion and showed me the true nature of this fight, what is being presented: 1) a representation of a virus attacking the immune system...or a computer program. 2) a long, rather impressive martial arts display for Keanu Reeves, a man veering on the 40 year mark  3) the jaw-dropping technical feat of *not cutting away* once Neo gains the pole-this, virtual technology at its astounding inception, it makes me shake and tremble as to the implications of how this technology can be used in the future. And finally 4) a sly wink to an entire generation of video-game weaned youth, with the lone hero battling endless hordes of computer-generated enemies, and even slipping into a CGI caricature (deliberate? I think so) when the Matrix itself has difficulty processing The One's chaos-generating existence.
The philosophy: Granted, the circular, seemingly redundant dialogue; the geyser of questions asked and answers undelivered; and the five-minute meta-speak speech at the climax: the Matrix Reloaded tests the current mental climate of its mass audience, and the reaction from some quarters has been quite loud, incredibly reactionary, and sadly ignorant.  A five-minute search on Google will reveal, to the curious and open-minded, the religious significance of the names and imagery; the full meaning behind the Architect's impressive (and condescending) summation; even the intent behind the ""rave"" scene (why is it that the on-screen sex is condemned as ""unnecessary"" - this, the primal expression of human love! -  while the violence is damned as not ""violent"" enough?).  But a five-minute search is apparently too much trouble for some.  Their loss.
Some other random things I liked:
1) Smith's bible-referencing license plate on the Audi-quite appropriate, given the speculation of Revolutions. The crows at the courtyard are a nice touch, as well.
2) The fact that the martial arts sequences utilize misdirection/redirection of energy instead of brute force and blood-splaying.
3) The Merovingian.  Besides the implicative import of his name, Lambert Wilson gives an astonishing performance as the ultra-debauched Pluto figure, and he offsets Neo's ignorance and Morpheus' rigid drive nicely.
4) The Freeway chase: even after watching it six + times, it still gets the juices flowing.
5) The deliberate manipulation of the camera to add layers of subtext to conversations: watch Neo and Smith's first verbal tte--tte carefully.  It took me four or five times to understand the (brilliant) usage...
6) The total-cheese Neo/Trinity moment.  It shouldn't work, but the contrast of meta-speak/mass-destruction with the clich makes me shed tears of joy.  I love this movie! *sniff*
7) The choreography.  As a martial artist, I found the fights to be more involving and interesting the more I watched them; they are easily the most complicated sequences in a mainstream movie since Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.
8) How elements from Matrix 1 corresponded with Reloaded: the Architect screens, the spoon-boy's five other spoons (on the ground, in M1), the ""twist"", several of the speeches.
I write this review a day before traveling to the theater for the conclusion to this sci-fi epic.  I know I won't be disappointed: all I expect are what the _creator's_ intended.  Given the intelligence and verve of Reloaded, I know it will be more than enough.",1067990400,6,6317,5.3086172344689375

Well I saw it in the theaters and I knew right away that this movie was nothing-close quality wise to the original. The effects were less astounding and impressive due mostly to bad CG and the plot and dialogue was very cheesy and overall completely pretentious. It also seems the movie tried to be more erotic than the last, which is all right in my books, but there is no gain in a 20-min. rave scene and is a waste of film in my opinion. But don't get me wrong there was a couple of neat scenes in this film (mostly in the freeway chase) and was by no means a terrible film. Overall the movie was decent enough and worth a rental, hopefully Revolutions will be better.

1466501,2,B00005JLTN,"I wasn't going to bother writing a review of Matrix II, being that, like 99 percent of all sequels, it failed to match the potency and creativity of its predecessor.  Sure, the special effects and action sequences are incredible.  Cool explosions, car chases, kung fu, all without taking off sunglasses or reloading.
Yawn.  Yeah, that's right, God forbid someone in Hollywood realize that it takes more than special effects to deliver a decent film.  For example, look at the last two Star Wars movies.
Or Independence Day.  I doubt anyone over the age of 13 thinks those are vehicles worth seeing more than once.
Moreover, the first hour of the movie is wretched, what with the need to show every excruciating detail about life in Zion.  So everyone there is hot and the sex is even hotter, accompanied with a techno beat.  It's so metrosexual.  Problem is I don't care about how the dishes are washed or if the wives of the crew are having a hard time dealing with the deployments.  Shoot me now.
Nor does the plot hold up once the intrepid crews voyage out to do battle.  Neo simply gets into impossibly one-sided scraps and then, surprise, flies away.
Bottom line, why does this movie stink?  Here's why -- I caught the Matrix on cable last night, which is one of those films like Raiders of the Lost Ark.  Once you start watching it, you can't tear yourself away from it.  Matrix II fits more into the Temple of Doom category -- 2 stars and consignment to the bottom of the pile of the video pile.

When I saw the first Matrix I would have been like, ""Whoa....What?"" But it's good to have friends who have seen it enough times to point out that in the virtual world you notice that all the shots have green bases. Very clever. It's not exactly that confusing.
But in the Matrix Reloaded...you have to give it some kinda credit, right? I mean, it's a sequel! The sword Morpheus was carrying was shiny....^_^ Oh, gotta love the twins. Such lack of emotion kind of reminds me of the Shmoopies. (Yeah, you won't know what I'm talking about.... Give it a few years' time.) *sigh* I'm just rambling, aren't I?
Ok...now for the ""This movie was so terrible!"" part. The movie revolved around choice and purpose. Come to think of it...this movie was practically chained to these motifs and without a blowtorch handy. Some of the dialogue...not the French guy...Morpheus was kinda eh....TRINITY'S! Absolutely cornballed.
Trinity: Is that good for us or bad for us?
Neo: Every floor is wired with explosives.
Trinity: Bad for us.
Gee, Trin...way to state the obvious!
A lot of the fighting...each fighting scence was a lame excuse to stick in some bullet time and martial arts. And toward the end when Neo's using his special stop-flying-objects-in-midair thing for the Sentinals, I was just thinking ""Ok, pass out already, we know it's going to happen."" And whaddaya know?

Instead of vital characters, we get the albino twins, Jada Pinkett Smith, and that Italian woman. None really have any purpose. The plot? Try to save the city from the machines.
  The action is too much, too often. One of the best things about the original is that it knew when to quit. The worst and most useless scene is when alternating shots of Neo and Trinity having sex and half-naked writhing dancers are shown. Pointless. Tasteless. Useless.

First of all, if you go in watching this and expect the first film, you may well be dissapointed. However, if you just go into to watch a film, without having any preconcieved notions as to what WILL take place, you will like this film.
Yes, the dance seen was lame, but that represented like 5 minutes out of a 2+ hour film?!
(...)Excuse me? No, adults showing a few minutes of passion is not porn. Maybe in your backwards town in idaho ""the flesh"" is evil, but for most adults, we understand that some people actually do have sex. Plus, there was no nudity anyway, so I'm not sure where the porn analogy comes from... If you want to watch a film with no evil stuff, don't they have some video store in Utah that will cut films to bits to remove all that ""evil"" stuff?
Anyway, this is a great film. Very few, if any, bad seens. The great seens more than make up for the dance seen, which to me was the only lame part of the movie.
As for the movie being continued, get over it. Lord of the Rings has done it, and so has the Matrix. I was somewhat bothered that I had to wait, but at least it is less than a year (with only a few weeks left at this point). That is not a good reason to give this movie bad reviews.

I, like many others, saw it on opening weekend and I was not disappointed.  Matrix Reloaded is simply an extraordinary piece of filmmaking at its highest level and is in a word, awesome.  Anybody who says this film was utter trash or garbage needs to learn how to watch movies in the first place.  It's impossible not to be impressed with this achievement. It's the reason why we go to the movies in the first place.  The people who hated this film probably looked only at the surface and dismissed it as only mindless special effects and action with no story whatsoever (or couldn't understand the film).  The true Matrix fans will see that, indeed, there are many levels to this film beyond just special effects, which indeed are truly mind-blowing and revolutionary in so many ways. The first film dealt with reality and illusion; this film deals with choice, destiny and fate.  You can't expect this film to top the first Matrix, which was almost a perfect film.  There's a lot to ponder if you just take the time to analyze it all with another intelligent film critic.  But the real reason I loved this film was for its relentless action sequences which raises the bar like few films before it.  The Burly Brawl where Neo takes on a hundred Agent Smiths is forever a classic, and the freeway chase sequence is simply awesome.  Interestingly enough, my favorite scene is actually the sword-fighting that Neo has with the Merovigian's henchmen.  When have we ever seen weapons-based fighting that was so well choreographed, so stylish and elegant like that?  Simply brilliant.  And let's not forget the music in this film, which I absolutely loved. The Matrix has always been about kung-fu and kick-ass fighting and this movie delivers; any lover of action films will be immensely satisfied with this film.  And if you study the dialogue of this film and break it down, there are very few ""fillers""; everything has meaning and purpose.  Matrix: Reloaded has received unfair critical bashing but the film is a whole lot smarter than people truly realize.  But in the end, Matrix: Reloaded is simply a film, but in a world filled with so many useless and uninspired movies, it is so refreshing to see a film that tries to push the boundaries of filmmaking to new and unchartered territory.",1067731200,5,2598,4.841628959276018

First of all almost all of the dialog in it was pointless rambling, which had nothing to do with anything. the relationship between Neo (who now is seemingly ""superman"") and Trinity (the ugly man-woman) is extremely corny. The world of men- Zion, which I had pictured in my mind to be a sophisticated and futuristic haven, turned out to be nothing more then a hole in the ground filled dancing cavemen, it was horrible. It's was not at all like the original Matrix, which broke boundaries of what is real and what is not. the whole point of this movie, the only goal was to get through a stupid door.",1067731200,5,708,4.496124031007752

On the other hand, I was fascinated by the development of the conflicting worldviews of Morpheus and the computer overlords.
If the third movie lives up to the first movie, then the second movie will simply be a necessary stepping stone to get there, but if the third fails to measure up, I think I'll stick with just the first movie.",1067644800,,607,4.735849056603773

There are many petty and pointless complaints like this scene was too long or the rave scene. I agree that some of the scenes should of being cut shorter,but thats a very minor complaint which does not detract from this movies greatness. The visual effects were beyond superb and the action scenes were done well. The plot gets thicker and more secrets are revealed which leads to exciting drama throughout the movie. Most of the people who gave this movie negative reviews probably did not understand many things which were said in the movie. I had to watch this movie like 5 times to get a good understanding of the complicated dialogue of the movie. I cant wait to see revolutions. Anyway,give this movie a chance to grow on you.

1466639,5,B00005JLTN,"I think the reason that people didn't get or hated this movie, is the fact that the story line wasn't the same predictable paint by the numbers plot/formula/story that people are used to watching nowadays.  As soon as the the plot thickened, certain people tuned out cause they couldn't follow the story or couldn't accept that it was the exact opposite of what they believed THE MATRIX should be.  I praise the Wachowski for having the cojones to write this!!
The movie truly changes your perspective of what you believe THE MATRIX is supposed to be. The first movie was mind bending, so why would you think that this one wouldn't be?? The first one didn't give you a clue of what the 2nd has to offer, and it shouldn't anyway!! That was the whole point of this narrative, what you think is real isn't/your preconceived ideas are wrong.
When I saw the despair on Morpheus' face as it dawned on him that what he believed in was a lie, that sinking feeling, I think that was  exactly what the people who hated this movie felt.  I felt that way when the Architect was explaining the whole ""Circle of life"" thing to Neo, that it was all pointless, that everything Neo did was predestined, that he didn't have a choice in the matter, it was all pre programmed.  The Architect was proven wrong, when Neo chose Trinity.  If they mentally stuck long enough and digested the implications of the last showdown with Neo and the machine's, they would've seen that here was the whole pivotal point of the movie!! That Neo's abilities/powers/mojo is able to cross over from the MATRIX to the real world!!! I thought that was an excellent ""kick in the pants"" twist.  That also brings to light the parallel cross over of Mr Smith, when he ""possessed"" the human, obviously there will be more to this in REVOLUTIONS.
Furthermore, IT'S ONLY THE 2ND PART!!! Don't expect a conclusion when you are in the middle of the story!! DUH!  It's like when some people said ""TLOTR: the 2 towers"" left you hanging, of course it did!!! AARRGGHH!!
So, I suggest that you watch the movie for yourself. Think. Chew over it. If you have to watch it again, WATCH IT! Then you'll understand that this is an awesome movie!  Don't take my word for it go see it!! Again if you have to! Darn it!",1067558400,2,2254,4.518427518427519

Of course some of those people probably did get the movie and just didn't like it. People say that there isn't many action sequences. The difference is, this action movie has a really good plot. I think people say it's crap because this is one of these so called ""Fan Boy"" Movies. If people want to see pure action then don't get this movie, If you want an action movie that has a plot and will rack your brain get this.

1466643,5,B00005JLTN,"i don't know where to start off, This is the best action movie to date, every other action movie i have watched after the matrix reloaded looks lame and retarded, the matrix movies r setting a standard too high for other action movies. First off don't go buying this movie on DVD if u did not like the theatrical release or r not a fan. No one should ever compare the original matrix movie to reloaded they r both in a class of their own. The original matrix movie had alot of revelations in story and its originality, clearly u cannot expect Reloaded to be like the first. Reloaded is middled in the series. Thing is most ppl don't really understand is the plot of the movie, like someone said if there r 400 levels to reloaded as a movie some ppl get 20levels some 100 and some 400, obviously most ppl that gave this movie a bad review got 20, reason being they bought this movie for the action only. There r alot of revelations in reloaded most ppl take for granted especially in the dialouges an example is the scene with the merovingian talking to neo. Another point i'ld like to make is the cg fights, ppl think that the neo vs smith was too fake, don't forget that the matrix is a computer program, remember what neo did in the first movie. The Brawl with smith is a super hero fight, Neo can do whatever he wants/bend the rules of the matrix thats why he is the ONE. And those of your who thought the cg was bad did u know that the truck fight scene the characters were cg in some parts. Most people just watch the action bits of the movie and rate the movie based on the action scenes no, the movie is more than just action, there is a very deep plot in the movie u simply have to think in some cases to understand the dialouges or they will simply sound pointless thats why i said this movie isn't for the weak minded. This is sci-fi ppl the matrix isn't an action movie its science fiction. if your a fan of the movie u'll love it, the matrix revolutions on the other hand will explain more and all will be revealed.",1067558400,8,2027,4.213367609254499

The end does leave you hanging, but what did anybody expect? It's just the second of a three part series. The special effects alone make this film worth watching, at least twice. In fact just buy it on DVD and keep it for further viewing in case you didn't get it the first time.

""The confusing plot"", many reviewers have complained and whined about. What confusing plot?! The plot was most certainly NOT confusing, it merely made the viewer think a little, which some people obviously don't have much practice doing. ""Horrendous dialogue"", others have said. Yeah right. The Matrix: Reloaded had brilliantly written dialogue. ""Wooden Acting"". Again, did these people even watch the movie?! Or are they basing their reviews on the opinions of some loser friend who was angry about having his established views questioned? I think that's why people REALLY don't like the movie, they've had a certain pattern of thinking regarding the series set into their minds for a good four years, and the Matrix Reloaded shows that that pattern was false. People don't like it, so they whine and complain. For the love of gawd, the third movie isn't even out yet! If The Matrix: Reloaded has taught us ANYTHING about this series, it's that you can't make assumptions until the series is complete.

it really deserves about 4.5 stars.
good movie with some awsome bullet time sequences and some really breath taking scenes.
only 2 problems for me in Matrix Reloaded was that some of the fight scenes are too long. when neo fights all 100+ agent smiths, it gets boring after a while.
that fight scene alone must have lasted a good 15-20 minutes.
also, i hate the ending, ""to be concluded""???? what was that? we're not watching some tv show here, this is the MATRIX!
on the upside, the bullet time here is just as good as in the original matrix. also, i absoultely LOVE the freeway car chase scene!!!
absoultey awsome! the music, the ghosts, the close calls with Trinity and the Keymaker on the mortacycle, and then the bullet time for the 2 eighteen wheeler crash is freaking AWSOME!!!
as for the DVD special features, it's worth it! big time! they go behind the scenes on the contrustion of the freeway sequence which began back in 2001! and it's not some 5 minute feature, it's a good feature that covers more than enough, and also helps the fans and viewers really understand not only how hard and how much work you have to do for just one sequence in a movie, but you come to appreciate the work the whole cast and crew did on matrix reloaded.

1466682,1,B00005JLTN,"What was so funny to me about this film is that the creators proved that the first film was a fluke - as I always suspected. Their earlier ventures (script for Stallone's Assassins and the sluggishly paced, though stylized Bound) are more intune with what they're about.
I don't look for American movies from the fin du siecle to be enlightening or to shed any light on the human condition, and it was perposterous IMHO for people to find that kind of insight for the first film. Proving my point about lack of comparative religious studies in our schools.
This film lacks any kind of coherency, and stuffed several 10+ minutes (redundent) fight scenes to demonstrate how much money they can spend creating special effects that WILL be used better in other movies.
American movies took their cue on how to do second and third films from Lucas' original Star Wars trilogy, but the Wachowski Brothers (like Lucas himself and suprising Quentin Tarantino in Kill Bill) don't have a clue on how to end a film that's designed to have a sequel. One doesn't just stop a story, bring some resolution to what you have already presented AND set-up the next film... which will be highly anticiapted. Anybody remember their feelings at the end of EMPIRE STRIKES BACK? What's going to happend to Han Solo? Good Christ! Is Vader reallly Luke's father? Will Luke finish his Jedi training with no hand? But in Matrix: Reloaded, does one even care about what's going to happen to any of the characters? ooohh, Zion is in trouble. so what? We never emotionally attached ourselves to them. And no one died, or even got close to dying. If this is about a war, then people who the audience cares about needs to die.
Personally, I would have killed Trinity. Permanantly, then Zeo can actually FEEL something when he takes revenge in the final film -- which I'm not going to see.

What little of the plot there is becomes increasingly confusing due in large part to the fact that what the audience gets is half a movie. Maybe things will be revealed when the final chapter of the trilogy comes out in early November. As the movie opens the machines are drilling towards Zion and Neo must find a way to prevent this attack. We go through the usual machinations of surface plot: Neo must find and rescue the Keymaker who will show him the way to the door to the core of the Matrix where he will be forced to make a choice to save the world or to act in his own self interest.
For the most part however the film presents fight scene after fight scene each more elaborate and CGI created. While the wire-fu is interesting I get the feeling that I've seen it all before and don't really need to see it again. The centerpiece of the film is a freeway chase scene that seems to go on forever. The movie is not bad but in the whole is not as great as the sum of its parts.
The DVD I viewed presented a crisp picture and soundtrack. Credit once again must be given to director of photography Bill Pope and composer Don Davis. While the set boasted of many special features they really did not amount to much more than extended promotional materials. Particularly bad in this respect were ""The Matrix Unfolds"" and ""Enter the Matrix"" game promos. The usual making of feature ""Preload"" was worth a look and so was the detailed Freeway Chase Scene featurette if your interests are inclined that way. Perhaps the best part of the special features section was the spoof of the film for the MTV Movie Awards which is  presented in its entirety.

  This film was held up by two tragedies:
Aaliyah was chosen for the role of Zee, however after just filming a music video and boarding an overloaded plane that was being pressured to take off,the plane crashed and killed her August 25, 2001.
  Gloria Foster as the ""oracle"" finished her scenes for the second film. She died from diabetes on September 29, 2001.
 Martial Arts training for Keanu Reeves, Laurence Fishburne and Carrie-Anne Moss would take 8 months.
  Hugo Weaving, while being pulled by a wire, put out a disc in his neck.
  Laurence Fishburne fractured an arm during a training incident.
  carrie-Anne Moss, during a wire stunt in training, broke her leg

  Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne) is direct in the understanding that before the prophecy can be fulfilled, the Oracle must be consulted first.
Neo (Keanu Reeves) must go back into The Matrix. First he mist meet with Seraph (Collin Chow).  he will take Neo to The Oracle (Gloria Foster) who is waiting in the playground courtyard. (My favorite scene and set in the movie).
  He gives neo very important information. neo must find the Keymaker (Randall Duk Kim). He is being held prisoner by a dangerous program, Merovingian (Lambert Wilson). Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving) is still after Neo, now more than ever.  Smith is able to copy himself.  The Albino Twins add to the combat.

1466733,3,B00005JLTN,"""The Matrix Reloaded"" is neither as bad as many fans on the site would lead you to believe nor as good as the $200,000,000 spent to produce and market it.  It is a very entertaining and thought-provoking film, while it also has some deep flaws that take away from the overall viewing experience.
The greatest flaw of all is the refusal of the directors to cut ANYTHING.  Many scenes in this film could have and should have been cut.  ""Reloaded"" would have been a lot better if it was a leaner and meaner 110 minutes instead of 138.  First and foremost, the whole Zion part of the film should have been shorter.  The orgy/dance scene should have been cut in half.  And the scene where Neo talks with the counsellor probably could have been cut completely.  And the Agent Smith fight scenes???  Though they were quite thrilling, they didn't advance the plot whatsoever.  I realize that it was important do introduce Smith in this film because it looks like he'll be important in the next one, but still, these fight scenes should have been cut down a little!
Likewise, other characters (like the Merovingian) are introduced and then forgotten about.  What was the nature of the conflict between the Merovingian and the Oracle?  I guess we're supposed to find out in the third one, which brings me to the film's final flaw- the ending is in a very bad spot.  I realize that it was supposed to be a ""cliffhanger"", but this film ends so abruptly that it just makes the rest of it seem that much more incomplete.  I guess I can't completely judge ""Reloaded"" until ""Revolutions"" comes out.  That's the problem- no one can.
What makes this movie so frustrating is that when it's good, it's REALLY good.  Some of the fight scenes are terrific, and the story is both convoluted and thrilling.  ""Reloaded"" is a film that's both entertaining and fun to talk about (hence the 1000-plus reviews).  It's just not as good as the first one, no matter how hard it tries to be.  One can't help but feel when watching this movie that the filmakers are trying too hard to replicate the originality of the first one- they end up with a film that is terrific eye candy and mind-boggling, but overlong and pretentious.  Sometimes, bigger is not better.  Here's hoping that ""Revolutions"" answers some of this film's problems.",1067212800,11,2300,4.646039603960396

Simply the best effects on celluiod.  Where LOTR the ring fails with its flat predictable imagery, Matrix challenges all directions of space.  LOTR and the Two Towers all have deep endless backgrounds over and over like the old movie matte paintings.  Flat boring predictable duds fill the LOTR imagery.

1466736,2,B00005JLTN,"Having watched the first Matrix three times with my daughter, I was strongly encouraged to see Matrix Reloaded with her.
Reviews were mixed, and MPAA also put an 'R' on this film, so we waited.  After seeing the terrible editing job done to the televised version of the Matrix, I knew I wouldn't wait until she was 18.  So I reviewed it myself, to see what the 'R' was about.  In case you don't know, there's a five+ minute section about 25 minutes into the film that really should have been mostly left on the editing floor.  Neo and Trinity having fully naked sex, and the Zion crowd, in parallel, wildly dancing themselves into a frenzy that, in some places, slips into an ....
Aside from the Neo's premonition at the end of the scene of Trinity in a future battle, which we've already seen once, this whole section adds nothing to the film, but make it an 'R' movie.
What really did not work for me was the pacing of the action sequences.  Most reviews have already lamented this - it was way too much.  The Smith fighting scene was fascinating, but to a point, and the film-makers just didn't know what ""way too much"" was. (Personally, I really enjoy Higo Weaving's fleshing out of this character, and his dialog scenes are among the best in the movie.)
Consider the highway scene.  Morpheus and Trinity, the warriors, trying to get away with Keymaker, the wise and crucial sage (who does not fight). The foes intent on stopping them, are agents, the twins, and of course the police. But Neo's temporarily out of the picture.  Part of this is very intriguing, in that the agents and the twins have no dealings with each other.  But the scene goes on far too long, and begins to feel like tag-team wrestling.
However, like the first, there are intriguing insights into the nature of the Matrix and its inhabitants, and these insights make the adventure worthwhile...",1067212800,,1870,4.591591591591592

1466797,3,B00005JLTN,"The difference between the original ""Matrix"" and this movie is like the difference between a highly conditioned athlete performing at the peak of competition versus an overmuscled beach boy flexing his oiled up pecs and abs on Venice Beach. In short, this movie, while impressive to look at, is simply too much. The action, special effects, and fight scenes are little more than the cinematic version of showing off; unlike in the first movie where these elements were essential to the story, here they were added mainly for their own sake. Neo, for example, is now so powerful he can fight of an entire army of Agents while hardly breaking a sweat, so what was meant to be a dramatic fight scene ends up being almost a comic farce as our new Superman flings the ""Smiths"" around at will. And, just like Superman, Neo can now fly, as we see in the conclusion to an over-the-top freeway chase scene where he zooms in at the last second to rescue old chum Morpheus from a crashing truck.
And that, right there, is much of the problem with this movie. If Neo can now routinely perform superhuman feats, where's the dramatic tension, the sense of risk? Even the climactic ending scene comes off as contrived, it's the old Superman dilemma of ""Do I save Lois Lane, or save the world?"" As in the first film, there's plenty of philosophizing, but unlike the first, in this film it seems heavy handed and overdone. In the first, there was the sense that we had a sci-fi movie with genuinely deep thoughts at its core, in this one there's more the sense that the filmmakers wanted to show off their ""Deep Thoughts"", with the end result being not unlike the aforementioned beach boy showing off his glistening mental muscles. In short, they're trying too hard to impress, and it shows. Morpheus now sounds as much pompous as profound, and the Oracle has lost most of her magic as we find out she's just another computer program. But the final letdown is the scene the whole movie had been building up to, the ""confrontation"" between Neo and the Architect, a figure who, we are to believe, is no less than the ""God"" of the Matrix. Well, with Neo as ""The One"", we'd expect quite a duel between the two, yet the meeting between the two falls flat, as if the filmmakers, having invested so much energy into all the stunts, fights, chases, and SFX leading up to this scene, had simply run out of ideas for a way to make this supposedly climactic match up genuinely enthralling. In truth, the whole scene felt anticlimactic, after two hours of buildup, the end result had me thinking ""This is it?""
OK, to be fair, this is merely the second installment in the Matrix trilogy, so it's entirely possible that the final version, due out in less than two weeks as I write this, will redeem this effort in much the way many Star Wars fans hope Episode III redeems the Prequel trilogy. And, also to be fair, the movie itself is really quite good. It's just that, after creating one of the greatest movies of all time with the original ""Matrix"", fans were entitled to expect nothing less than a ""Godfather Part II"" or ""The Empire Strikes Back"" from these guys. And they didn't get it.

As I was trying to watch it, I kept blinking out.  No matter how hard I concentrated and how much I wanted to watch the movie, it just couldn't hold my interest and I now know why.  The movie is lifeless.  It has no soul.  I compare it to watching your best friend play someone else on a video game and you are observing.  Sure it's fun to them and for you it's semi-interesting, but after awhile you become bored with it because it doesn't involve you.  The Matrix Reloaded doesn't bring it audience in with it.  It doesn't seem like it is interested in presenting characters that you care about.  Neo, Trinity, Morpheus and even Agent Smith are just cardboard cutout of their previous self from the previous movie.  Morpheus and Neo have become deities (for lack of a better word) and Trinity is there in order to give Neo a purpose, but she doesn't do much.  Zion, the last free city, doesn't seem like a city worth fighting for.  It's more like an elaborate cave dwelling. But the one thing that stands out like a scab is the obvious looking fake scenes.  Everything is so obvious CGI.  At least the first film final battle seemed as if there was some serious since of urgency and danger.  But this one hits you with so many stunts and CGI effects that after awhile, it becomes dull.  I still give it props on what it is TRYING to achieve, but I have to toned down my earlier glowing remarks.  Hopefully Revolutions can wrap things us for us and make this film a better film.

As it turns out, however, ""Matrix Reloaded"" doesn't even achieve that minimal level of entertainment. If you enjoy endless action sequences that look completely unreal (CGI animation) then you might like this movie, because that's basically all that it is. The characters fly around, stop bullets, jump from car to car on busy freeways, make enigmatic statements about freedom of choice, kick each other, make endless references to the Prophecy, fight some more, blow things up, more enigmatic statements, more CGI animation, more bullets, and then finally it ends..  by which time you've wasted almost 2 and a half hours of  your life, waiting for something interesting to happen.

1466804,3,B00005JLTN,"This ""middle act"" of the Matrix trilogy has difficulty standing on its own.  It lacks a compelling, driven storyline.  And not much really happens in the first third - you just sit and bide your time until the pace picks up a bit.
The playground fight with the multiple Agent Smiths runs too long.  Had it been a little shorter and tighter it would have played better, I think.  And Agent Smith seems less a threat to Neo and crew in this film but rather more of an inconvenience.
Middle act films are just difficult anyway. We already know the basic premises and we know the heroes have the ability to win in a fight, so where is the real tension?  Most importantly, where is the sense of awe and wonder that made the first film so fascinating?
The DVD extras are okay though not quite spectacular.  But by this point in time, consumers are expecting a bunch of DVD extras with movies like this one, so it never quite feels like an ""event"" purchase.  And since DVD buyers are becoming more and more demanding about the type, volume, and quantity of bonus features we/they get with a Special Edition purchase, it will be increasingly difficult to find a movie release with features that stand out above the rest of the field.
Case in point with ""Matrix: Reloaded"" -- it isn't that the DVD bonuses are a special treat, rather it is that we already EXPECT no less than this plethora of features.

The Matrix was an exercise in high budget experimental sci-fi, and where it worked was in its willingness to use archetypal characters and put them in the context of a cutting edge action film.  With revolutionary special effects and a very futuristic look, the Matrix also managed to engage the viewer in a very well written plot and creative vision.
Unfortunately, the Matrix Reloaded builds more on the technological side, and the philosophical and esoteric undertones are lost amid useless scenes of show-off filming.  Admittedly, this is impressive in some instances where the plot is moved along, such as the car chase and the scene featuring neo fighting against a multiplying horde of agents, but overall the film just LOOKS like something we'll be laughing about in 15 years.

I can't beleive i missed the giantic breathtaking fight between Neo and 100 Agent Smiths in the theatre!! But i did get to see it, and its like my absolute favorite fight ever. The camera angles are the best, and the moves and MUSIC are THE BEST EVER. The car chase part was also very well done, it reminded me of Bad Boys II. Nobody matches up to Agent Smith, he's the coolest and slyest villian ever. The dance/sex scene in Zion was kind of queer, though. I never expected that part, and it was not like the matrix.
But, as i watched the movie, it began to seem less and less like the matrix. The ""orgy"" part was like some kind of semi-porno movie, the neo/smith fight was like a Power Rangers fight, the freeway scene was like Bad Boys II, Morpheus's speech in Zion was like Braveheart, and Neo flying was like freakin' SUPERMAN! Although i must say it was pretty cool.
The DVD special features were great, especially the MTV Movie awards skit that featured Justin Timberlake as himself, Seann William Scott as Agent Smith/Scott and himself, Wanda (from ""Wanda at Large"") as the Oracle, Keanu Reeves as Neo, Laurence Fishburne as Morpheus and (drumroll please) WILL FERREL as the architect, who was HILARIOUS! The mini-movie also featured the Keymaker and this crazy hyper cat-in-the-hat guy in the dance at Zion, and i'm not sure who plays him.

However, if you are able to go beyond the action for a moment and take a look at what the people who produced and directed movie is saying- you will realize this is pondering movie.
It is about globalization. It is about saying how we humans are very self-destructive, and then once we destroy something we then try to run to fix it. The whole point of The Matrix, The Matrix Reloaded, and the Matrix Revolution is how we have been given control by a Higher Source and sqandered that control as we would money. Who is that Higher Source, G-d, he gave humans control of smaller things to make life more beautiful, to prosper them, and grow them so we can be better humans. However we have taken that control and turn it into, ""MY WILL,"" what I won't do, what I will do, what I won't allow others to do to me, and what I will allow them to do.
The most important element in The Matrix Reloaded is that the choices we make have all ready been chosen and the only thing we need to do is to understand why on earth we are here. Get it? It is not about the great moves in the movie and Neo being THE ONE. It is about coming to terms that we did not create ourselves.

Neo continues fighting new enemies, including the upgraded Agent Smith, who can duplicate himself. Another new pair of villains were the Twins, which were my personal favorite. In fact, the entire car chase was the best scene in the movie.
So Neo, in love with Trinity, has to decide between his romantic love for her and mankind, and his decision leaves the ending in a cliffhanger, forcing us to digest the third installment of the series.
Although the plot was OKAY, there were some problems:
Bullet time was great when it came out. Now it's so cliche and milked of all its originality that when the people who created it return with Matrix Reloaded, it's, well, boring. The sad part is, it's not the Wachowski brothers' fault.
So they tried to make this one a little special by cramming LOTS of philosophy in it, which I personally did not understand or care for. I doubt even if I understood, their ridiculously long speeches would amount to much.
Another problem the movie has is, now that Neo is ""The One"", he can do anything. Nothing can stop him. So there's no challenge in the fight, no thrill of the hunt, no edge-of-your-seat action that I loved about the first one.(This is what made the fight against 100 Agent Smiths too generic)

The scene drags for 10+ minutes, but once Neo and co. set to leave the city, the movie takes off down the track again non-stop to the cliffhanger ending -- which is exactly how I expected this film to end, considering The Matrix films popularity rank up there with the original Star Wars films (even if they are not as good).

There are several surprises along the way, including the return of his nemesis, Smith.  If you thought the first movie was complex, this one really increases the complexity.  There's just one bad point.  The scenes that take place in Zion are dead space.  They could have been cut, or a better job should have been done on them.  However, I think the action later makes up for it.
The action in this movie is excellent.  THe combination of wire action and CG really put the action into a world of fantasy.  There are two scenes which are worth mentioning.  First, there is an excellent fight scene in which Neo fights 100 agent Smiths.  It starts out small, but it steadily builds up to a climax.  Another excellent scene is a particularly exciting highway chase.  The highway was built especially for this movie, so they are able to crash a lot of cars.  If you're a lover of destruction, you've just got to love it.",1066867200,2,1361,4.463414634146342
1466898,4,B00005JLTN,"I am disappointed to see that many people really hated this film, but I believe that is because the film did not fit their standard template for a Hollywood action film.
So what if the rave scene went on a bit? I think that scene was there to give us an idea of life outside the Matrix and the culture of Zion.
The film's plot may seem confusing to most but I can see that it all provides a lead up to the plot twist at the end. It is not simply adequate to show a load of fight scenes and turn it into a video game.
For anybody wanting to buy this DVD who has not already seen the movie, I would recommend you rent it first to see which camp you fall into ( lovers/haters ).
If you hate the film, walk away but if you like it go out and buy the DVD and try to unravel the plot. I think that a lot of the earlier scenes provide some clues about what is going on.",1066867200,2,862,3.82122905027933
1466899,3,B00005JLTN,"It's a little hard to review ""The Matrix Reload"" for two reasons. The first is that it is a sequel to a highly original and entertaining sci-fi classic, ""The Matrix"" [1999], and the higher the innovation quota in the original, the less likely it is that a sequel can equal it, much less top it. The other is that it is itself the first half of a four-hour plus super sequel. [The second half, ""Matrix Revolutions"" opens in theaters in November.] Doing sequels back-to-back is not a new idea. It was done in the late 80s with the ones for ""Back to the Future"". What I can say so far is that the sequels are at once technically brilliant yet overblown. It's a case of bigger not always being better.
The sequel finds us deep in the bowels of the planet, where human escapees from the matrix's machine have built a city. The machines are rapidly burrowing towards the city with the intention of destroying it. Characters from the original movie are fighting to save the city. Basically, that is the plot.
The special effects are awesome, no doubt about it. But there is a truism about movies which I don't think changes much over time: Everything that happens should propel the plot along. Like many recent big budget movies, this one seems entranced by its own special effects. For example, there is a spectacular chase sequence on a freeway that runs fourteen minutes. My question, though, is whether or not this would have been a better movie if this sequence had been cut to, say, seven minutes? Whatever happened to less is more? When did excess become a positive thing?
As for the philosophical meaning of these movies, that is up to the individual viewer. I find musings over the meaning here to be bogus. To me, these are just movies. There is no deep meaning. Either they work as entertainment, or they don't. To me, ""The Matrix Reloaded"" works just some the time.",1066780800,,1870,4.585074626865672

Here are my thoughts on The Matrix Reloaded in descending order of what worked well: action sequences - spectacular; music - great, really pulse-pounding; acting - passable; plot - hard to follow the first time through.  Finally, there were a couple scenes that appeared unnecessarily risque and gratuitous.
The bevy of DVD special features should please most people.  The MTV Movie Awards clip is very amusing.  Audio commentaries and outtakes would've rounded off the extras perfectly but sadly, aren't included.
The Matrix Reloaded is a good, not great, movie.  There's just not a lot of revolutionary material here.  Don't expect the high level of surprise and awe the first film delivered.  Watch it with that frame of mind and you won't be disappointed.",1066780800,,924,4.954545454545454

A thud heard across the country from countless fans. What the hell happened to our beloved franchise? What were the brothers thinking?

1466903,3,B00005JLTN,"To the Wakowski bros. I take my hat off to you, you have created a great work and whether people like it or not is not the point any longer, Matrix part one is magnificent and will always remain so, I wished that you could have blown us all away with part two, first plot wise then with your special effects, this was not the case but i beleive in you not to disappoint us in part 3. Part 3 is already made but I hope that you will have made the immediate attentive focus on the script to leave your audience with not just another movie to watch but something that is life altering, that leaves us with awe, that leaves us feeling we too CAN FLY! that we can break free that there is more and that will remain in the back of our minds no matter where we are, whether taking out the trash or waiting on tables or fixing a car or designing a new rocketship, that you gave us the opportunity to connect with something...out there, something greater as you successfully did with part 1. No matter what happens I hope that part 3 will excel in all ways and be a breakthru film but if it isn't than i hope that you the Wachowski bros. will not stop but go back to the drawing board and bring us something else that will...in the future, never give up, never stop, we need your good minds to bring us HIGHER!
  That said, now to the fans, matrix 2 could have been better than the first, it wasn't although the special effect were unbeleivable although the one part where keanu is fighting the agents was poorly done you could tell they were cgi (this was a failure the whole philosophy in holywood is to fool us into thinking it's real, but don't go down too hard on the guys responsible for that i don't think it is good to be able to make computer generated images look too human as eventually it will be used for evil purposes). The dialogue dissapoints no enlightenment here, and that was what got us all hooked wasn't it. The fights were excellent, Keanu we love you and you are a good actor to hell with the criticism and ofcourse the magnificent Laurence Fishburne and the beautiful, Carrie Ann Moss (please i hope that you and Keanu patched everything up and are at peace) as well as some of the new faces, the master computer was fascinating, the oracle, the special effects. The music, the sound effects, the cinematography and the sets all TOP TOP NOTCH, I only hope matrix 3 will excell as part I did...not another action flick but ever so much more.",1066780800,,2455,4.300215982721382
1466948,1,B00005JLTN,"I'm deeply disappointed with this film. The first one was incredible... not simply because it was groundbreaking, but because the acting, the choreography and most certainly the plot. ""Reloaded"" didn't even have a plot... it was like a giant mess of hypothetical trilogy fillers that were just mashed into a melting pot and put on film for all to enjoy. I, for one... did NOT enjoy it. I've heard several times recently that this film was just a tease for the upcoming conclusion to the trilogy, and that it was nothing in comparison. It's pathetic when they can admit that their movie is nothing in comparison. Why would they even have made it if that were the case? Why not try and make all 3 of them great, rather than just the first and third? Does that make sense to anyone with more than 17 brain cells?
Does anyone else think it was annoying how much they used the special camera effects? It seemed that about every 30 seconds there would be a slow-motion 360 degree flip-up-the-backside and around the character shot, and it really pissed me off.
Also, what was with that party at Zion? It looked like that show ""Wild On"" on E! - basically just a bunch of disease mongering horntoads, and a lot of T&A shots.
Granted, the special effects throughout MOST of the movie were astonishing... with the exception of that drawn out clash against Agent Smith's copies [which lasts for what, 15+ minutes?] - when Neo was maneuvering while fighting them, and what he was doing was way too difficult to be done by any non-supernatural human, they had to use an entirely CGI based sequence at some points, and oh my... did it look fake. If you pay close attention to Neo's face, he looks like the cartoon drawings of Inspector Gadget, and even like Claymation if you really focus - it's THAT bad.
The agents in this movie sucked... what happened to the other two that were teamed up with Smith from the first movie? Speaking of Smith, he had horrible dialogue throughout the entire movie. The guy is a great actor, and they made him look bad... really bad. To compensate for the staggering amount of GARBAGE they threw in this movie, the conclusive installment had better be more amazing than the first. It will be extremely difficult to follow up a movie this poorly conceived and complete the trilogy in good standings.",1066694400,4,2316,4.62378640776699
1466949,5,B00005JLTN,"Ok, so i've been patiently sitting through these ""reviews"" of this movie, and I'm seeing a growing trend: a severe misappreciation of this film. people, for crying out loud, it is the MIDDLE movie. therefore, the expectations should be lowered somewhat. Also, I'm sick of people complaning that the ""mystery"" is gone from the movie. You want mystery, go watch a MYSTERY movie. it seems pointless to come to an action movie and walk away disappointed because the mystery surrounding the first one is gone! ANd of course, there is the infamous ZION scene. OH NO. the screen is showing an event that probably goes on in 100,000 diffeerent locations across the US on any given night. but funny, i don't hear a general outcry to shut those raves down! If people feel like being hypocrites, they should at least be intelligent about it. Lastly, there seems to be a great deal of complaint directed towards Keanu Reeves. Granted, he blows as an actor. But i must say that i didn't really go into Reloaded looking for Oscar performances. I went for the action, and for the numerous, and usually well thought out plot twists. NOT TO SEE AN OSCAR WINNING PERFORMANCE. Oh, and one last little thing that's annoying me. Some of my more intelligent friends claim that the film tries too hard with its philosophy, and fails miserably. More specifically, they refer to it as ""lite"" philosophy, claiming that the ideas really aren't that revolutionary, or even that interesting. I seem to be constantly explaining to them that such a process is necessary to make the philosophy accessable to the general public. But at the bottom of it all, it's an entertaining action movie with excellent special effects.

1466950,4,B00005JLTN,"There's a slew of people out there that did not like this movie (I am not one of them, however) and I think I've discovered why:  if you're looking for another movie just like the first Matrix, you're going to be disappointed.  The Matrix was truly a mind-blowing movie in and of itself...the plotline, the effects, the fighting style.  At the time, everything about it was different and completely unique.  But you have to consider that that movie was the ""introduction"" to the world of the Matrix.  That very small universe was bound to expand, and that is exectly what happens in Reloaded.  Remember, it's not called ""The Matrix Rehashed.""  Reloaded may suffer from a bit of a ""middle child"" syndrome, in that the concept is no longer new, but it provides no resolution at it's end either.  We are introduced to so many new charaters and locales, which can be a little disconcerting at first.  But let me break some of the more major points down here:
Zion:  Why do people hate these scenes so much?  No doubt many had already formed a picture in their mind of what the city would look like, and it probably just didn't fit in with their image.  Ultimately, I think their visit to Zion was necessary though.  You need to actually see the people that these characters are fighting to save.  On the whole though?  The Zion scenes take up so little time in the whole of the movie, who cares really?
The fight scenes:  The Burly Brawl IS a bit over the top...but that's what it's supposed to be.  Admittedly, I was ready for it to be over, but it was still a special effects feat.  Everything else is very much in keeping with the first movie.
The car chase:  Some people thought it dragged on...I thought it was mezmerizing.  The effects were truly extraordinary and the concept of why the freeway is so dangerous to our heroes make it all that much more exciting.  What's a true action movie without a big car chase?  This one puts all others to shame.
The big ""talk"":  Ah yes, Neo's infamous conversation with the architect of the Matrix.  Is it dry?  Like a desert.  Is it completely confusing the first time through?  Completely.  Is the rhetoric a bit puffed-up and imposing?  Definitely.  Is it helpful to watch the DVD with the subtitles on?  Absolutely.  I've watched it multiple times and I still feel like I'm missing something.  I guess you either get it or you don't.
You cannot take a movie like this too seriously.  If you do, it suddenly becomes pretentious and annoying.  But it IS just a movie, and should be taken as such.  Sure, there's some potentially serious philosophical points, namely the power of choice and the power of love.  And heck, that makes for some good conversation fodder.  But lets get right down to it:  this movie is pure eye candy, that happens to have a decent storyline and an attractive, talented cast to boot.  As a side note, the second DVD has some worthy extras, especially the documentary about the making of the big car chase, and the MTV Movie Awards snippet is hysterical as well.
Bottom line:  If you're looking for more of the first movie, you're setting yourself up for disappointment.  Viewing for pure entertaiment?  Watch on!",1066694400,13,3183,4.598930481283422
1466951,3,B00005JLTN,"This middle installment of The Matrix trilogy begins about 6 months after the end of The Matrix.  Zion, the underground human sanctuary that was only talked about in the 1st film, is featured prominently.  Morpheus, Neo and crew have had great success in freeing more and more minds, but the machines are fighting back. They are tunneling down to Zion and will surely obliterate the city if allowed to reach it.  New insights into the nature of the Oracle are revealed.  She informs Neo that the ""key"" to the destruction of the machines is within the Matrix. Agent Smith is back in a big way; his apparent destruction at the hands of Neo in the 1st film has somehow freed him from the confines of the rules that govern the system.  He is a rogue program, overwriting other programs and making numerous copies of himself.  Perhaps he represents an evolution of artificial intelligence no longer content to simply exist. As he confronts Neo, he says that he intends to take from Neo what Neo took from him; ""purpose"".  A search for purpose, for meaning in one's existence is a very human attribute.
A host of new characters are introduced.  In Zion there are members of the governing counsel and other cyber-warriors, some of whom strongly disagree with Morpheus' single-minded commitment to the prophesy of ""The One"".  Within the Matrix there are new villains and a vital new character called ""The Keymaker"".  The action has been ratcheted up a notch, including an amazing car/motorcycle/tractor-trailer chase sequence.  Neo soars like Superman through virtual skies, sometimes at such speed that he literally tears up the landscape in his wake.  But this film is less satisfying than the 1st, partly because it's the middle chapter, but also because some of the dialogue is so thick you could cut it with a knife.  Morpheus seems pompous and melodramatic here, spewing lines heavy with self-importance.  Neo has become so accomplished within the Matrix that he looks almost bored as he takes on all comers, leaving little doubt that he will prevail and thus diminishing suspense.  The love-conquers-all theme is revisited as the relationship between Neo and Trinity is developed.  But there are interesting revelations about the history of the Matrix; there is an implication that Agent Smith may be able to extend his influence into the real world; and the ending reveals a startling new development in Neo's abilities.  If the Wachowski brothers hit a home run with the final chapter, then the shortcomings of this film will be forgotten.",1066694400,,2540,4.952830188679245

You have agents jumping from car to car, Trinity hijacks a motorcycle from a movimg 18 weeler and pilots it through the crowded fast moving trafic!

1466954,4,B00005JLTN,"""The Matrix Reloaded"" tries to be a lot of things.  It tries to be more visually mind-blowing than ""The Matrix"".  It also tries to ask more philosophical questions, show more of humanity in the world of the machines, and to introduce us to numerous entities in the real world and the Matrix.  In some ways, the film succeeds (the highway chase is an amazing set piece!) and in others it fails (the ""Burly Brawl"" ends up looking unreal because they went farther than the effects were really capable of).
Many people have dissected the plot, the effects, etc.  What it boils down to is this: ""The Matrix Reloaded"" is a kick-arse sci-fi kung-fu flick with gobs of philosophy.  If you're expecting anything more than that, you've got the wrong DVD.",1066694400,,744,4.6923076923076925
1466955,3,B00005JLTN,"Ok, I rented this with some hesitancy.  This film was almost universally disliked by the critics, and many of my friends disliked it as well.  So... I waited until the DVD was released to see the film, and I am so glad that I did.
The good:  Even though it's been overdone, I will admit that I enjoyed the special effects fight scenes, at least at first.  They were very well-choreographed.
Unlike most, I also liked the Zion scene.  I always wondered what everyone seemed to be fighting for in the first movie, and now I know.
And, of course, who can forget Carrie Ann Moss and Hugo Weaving.  Great actors, do justice to their roles.
Also as usualy, great cinematography.  Those folks do know how to use cameras.
The bad:  Overdone fight scenes.  After about the first hour, it started to get tedious.
The Oracle.  <sigh>  One of the few scenes which should have been a bit longer.
Lawrence Fishburn: emotes like a poorly trained Shakespearean actor. He's one of those who tried to make the 50th row in the house feel what he was feeling, but too bad there's only 25 rows in the house.
Jada Pinkett Smith, the Albino Twins, and Monica Belucci:  hope they get more play in the third installment, I actually think they can be good characters.
The ugly: Keanu Reeves.  The man has no emotional range whatsoever, making the emotionally-challenged lunkhead that is Neo the perfect role for him.  About the only good thing I can say about him is that he's easy on the eyes.
Philosophy 101: Uhm, I felt like this flick was a lecture taught by a poorly trained doctorate candidate.  It was heavy-handed, sermonistic, and preachy.  At least the first film challenged the viewer to think; this one practically rammed it's philosophy down our throats.
Story/plot: I'd say ugly, except that would imply that there was one, which there wasn't.
The fight scene with the 100s of Smiths: It was drawn out, poorly done, and bordered on being a parody of itself.
Sadly, this film doesn't even have the excuse of being a guilty pleasure or a popcorn flick.  This, along with Mr. Lucas' recent work with the Star Wars franchise shows just how far filmgoers will go to make a buck or two without concern for quality.  If you want good, quality, modern sci-fi, check out the X-Men series or LOTR examples of how good film should be made.",1066694400,,2316,4.593673965936739

Unfortunately, it seems like the whole Lord of the Rings or Star Wars all over again. The first one(s), outstanding, the sequel financially successful on hype or anticipation alone, but falling flat as a story.

The entire film played out like a video game. Neo was no longer the confused but determined protagonist of the first movie, but simply a hollow action figure fighting his way from scene to scene. Granted, these fight scenes were impressive, but whatever happened to the story? We were forced to sit through hours of explosions, presented with some philosophical musings, and then left to dangle for several months until 'Revolutions' is released.
I felt as if this movie was lacking something special. It focused way too much on Neo's fighting, and not enough on what he was fighting for.
I give this movie two stars because of one truly touching scene in this movie. Neo is presented with a gift from one one of the orphans - a dirty, tattered looking spoon, which we can only assume is from the 'there is no spoon' kid from the first movie. More moments like this may have turned off a lot of hardcore action fans, but would have made this film a lot more enjoyable.",1066694400,,1125,4.574257425742574
1466998,5,B00005JLTN,"This move is phenomenal; other reviewers are hitting on a lot of good points.  So I just want to point out some counter argument concepts. Remember the cartoon the Transformers, which came out about 15 years before the matrix.  The idea is somewhat the same in the Transformers: The Autobots and Decepticons are robots that rebelled against their creators when they developed more intelligent and emotion.  The Autobots' Matrix, which Optimus Prime holds, was the most powerful weapon in the universe.  The first Matrix was my favorite movie for a period of time.  It had some new fresh ideas, it was stylish, artsy, Gothic, and best action and visual movie at the time.  It has an atmosphere similar to another animation call ""Aeon Flux"" which came out 5-7 years before.  This was set in a hyper-techno organic future environment.  The Matrix Reload is almost just an extension of the first movie.  The mystique is gone.  The visual is still awesome and superior above other.  A lower budget film ""Equilibrium"" that came out a year ago is another Matrix action movie that actually feels more creditable and fresh.  I wish they didn't release the next Matrix until they had something revolutionary coming out like the first movie.  I guess it about feeding the mass pop culture and money.  I give this a five star, since it is magnificent on many levels that I didn't touch on, but you know what they are.",1066608000,2,1405,4.775933609958506
1466999,1,B00005JLTN,"About halfway through this movie, I wondered if I was sleeping through a philosophy 201 lecture and the professor was intruding on my dream - but no, it was a pretentious screenwriter. Philosophical points in film should be made through the story (such as the issues of reality in the first film, and similar movies like dark city or existenz) not through (very boring) dialog.
Beyond this very serious flaw, the plot of the movie was very weak. At the end of the first matrix, Neo is shot and recovers from the injury completely, and then enters Agent Smith's body, showing that he does not need to follow rules about what is corporeal and what is not. Therefore, hitting him, any of that - does not require martial arts. He's outside of the system, it doesn't work for him anymore.
On the plus side, the entire issue of there being multiple copies of ""the one"" for a further control of the matrix - that was nice, I liked that it seemed at least somewhat interesting.
On the downside, the assault on Zion - I am not sure that this was done as well as it could have been.",1066608000,2,1072,4.41919191919192

Unfortunately, The Matrix Reloaded does not cut it the same way. Most of it's plot is fairly interesting, not as intriguing as the first Matrix but fair enough. There are many scenes that were maybe somewhat unnecessary like the Zion scene(which i would've cut in half) or the agent smith scene(which gets boring after a while).I believe the movie tries to astonish people with its special effects(car chase,smith agents) and leaves the plot out a little. Nevertheless it still a good movie. The scenes with the Oracle and The Architect were pretty interesting. I believe the ending of this movie its what makes it worth it. The movie, in my opinion talks about how destiny can actually be avoided, which foreshadows that the humans will resist in the end. It was a ""transition movie"" so it was basically paving the way for revolutions. It is a good buy on DVD because its special effects and some of its philosphical intrigue is still there.

Agent smith was a bore, however Hugo weaving was great in his role I believe his talent was severely hindered by the plot. The long winded speeches and hypothesizing was extremely wasteful, if the filmakers were short of story they might have made the movie shorter instead of padding it with cr$p!

People (mostly really, really sutpid, stupid people)have already assumed the whole thing and are dissing this film like it is the end of The Matrix saga ,BUT OH NO NO NO YOU ARE SO WRONG! . I must first say that this film is the second part of a THREE PART series so now that you remember that you can kick yourself in the ass and call yourself a big idiot. Everything in RELOADED is 'middled' if I can say that. I mean 'middled' because it is truly a middle piece of story from a whole on and becuase it is just that the result is disasterous to people with a one track mind. You must wait for REVOLUTIONS to be released to see the whole result and then and only then it will be a day of truth for all these assuming bafoons.",1066608000,6,833,4.054545454545455

There are alot of parts that are extremely dumb and corny but then there are some others that are just so cool. And even the dumb and corny parts have something cool about them, even if it is something very small...

There is a scene at the beginning where everybody is dancing in slow motion and that seems to go on for hours! The action scene at the beginning is done in slow motion and that goes on and on and isn't exciting at all. It's just boring. I hate all this slow motion stuff! Maybe it worked the first few times they did it but now it's just annoying. The freeway scene was hardly impressive. You could see where they would use the same stretch of freeway over and over. The part where Neo fights the hundreds of Agent Smiths is SO boring! Nobody gets hurt, nobody gets tired, nobody dies. So what's the point? Finally Neo just flies away. Why didn't he do that at the beginning? SO much wasted time! And the story is even more confusing. Whenever somebody starts talking that's all they do. Talk talk talk. After awhile all you hear is ""blah blah blah"" and you're looking forward to another pointless action scene. And the dialog is so dry. There's no emotion. This movie is just bad.

1467081,4,B00005JLTN,"I just saw the ""Matrix Reloaded,"" and I have to say, guns will always beat martial arts, and I don't care how good you are with your footwork.  In Star Trek, they invented a sniper rifle which was actually just a transporter device that could teleport a bullet into a selected target, which would definitely create a paradigm shift in military thinking today.  On top of that, a device like a transporter would cause a new type of military
standoff.  Why?  Because with current medical technology, you could teleport a small bit of poison into a victim and cause that person to die of seemingly ""natural causes.""  I have no doubt the military would try to do something like this, as the Russian KG B has already done something like this, only they used needles to deliver the poison, bumping into their
victims and pretending that the injection was a poke from an umbrella or something.  If everyone had the ability to transport poison into every other leader, they wouldn't have an outright war, but a standoff, as kings have not led their own battles since the days of Ramayana, a true warrior's kind of story.  Until people start portraying battles like the armies of
Ramayana, we're in for more movies like the Matrix Reloaded.  That's just how I feel.",1066608000,2,1256,4.677272727272728

Well, I've had about 6 momths to get over my disappointment and settled down to watch it again in the privacy of my home entertainment center and you know something....it's not such a bad movie.  In fact, Now that the movie doesn't have to compete with my expectations, I enjoyed a lot better.  I also understand a bit more about the gangsters and how they could exist in the matrix.  I still have issues with the Zion orgy/sex scene, That did go on about five minutes too long.  But otherwise, I feel much different about the movie as a whole.

Those who say this brings nothing new to the Matrix apparently weren't watching the same movie! Smith can copy himself, and apparently leave to the real world now. Neo has mastered his abilities, which makes for an amazing fight sequence that I can only hope is topped in the third installment. We meet more of the ""resistance"" of Zion. The Battletech-esq Mech that guards the gates to Zion made me scream for joy! Some scenes (such as the programmer) make more and more sense the more you watch the film, giving you a new outlook on the movie as you gain understanding of the Matrix itself.
  If you do not know, Reloaded and the soon-to-be-released Revolutions were filmed as one long movie, and then cut in half. So expect all the lose ends to be wrapped up in the third and final instalment of what can only be called the most ingenious and creative trilogies to date!",1066608000,7,957,4.558139534883721

There was barely a script to this movie!
This movie was filled with cool fight scenes, but they lasted way too long and were over done to be entertaining. There was a techno dance scene that was put into the movie that made no sense at all and wasted about 15 minutes of my life. It looked like a bunch of mind controlled zombies if you asked me. There was nothing mystical or mind boggling about this movie at all except when the movie ended with TO BE CONTINUED IN THE MIDDLE OF A SCENE! We all got so angry over the way it ended we vowed to not even bother buying The Matrix 3. It was really disappointing.
At least with other trillogies, you know it is going to be a trillogy, so you expect that. Don't waste your money until 3 comes out on DVD..buy the boxed set!",1066521600,,815,4.1
1467085,5,B00005JLTN,"Since we're rating the DVD version here, I'll give you 2 separate reviews: one for the film itself, and one for the DVDs.
The Film
The second installment of this ongoing story answers more questions and leaves us with just as many as the original.  I don't know whether to feel more or less at ease, because I'm still left in the dark as to what's going on EXACTLY.  I would expect more of an explanation from the third one, however, I also don't expect to be spoon-fed the answers.  Obviously this film offers the simplest (and yet most complex) form of entertainment: visuals.  Amazing work was done in this film, from the fights to Zion to the special camera effects which placed them in impossible places (eg. car chase).  Neo has developed his powers further, however, he obviously is not invincible and like Morpheus said, the rules ""can be bent, not broken.""  What solidifies this film as more than just an action movie is the plot.  The script is VERY deep and similar Shakespearean pieces, it takes some analysis to fully grasp all the ideas that are being explained.  If you want to fully enjoy this film, take the time to understand it all.  Then you can decide whether you like it or not.  However, such analysis is not necessary to enjoy the film.  Some complain that certain action scenes were dragged out (car chase, Smith fight), but I found them amazing.  They just seemed to keep going and it blew my mind as they kept adding more to each scene.  They certainly were more amazing than anything to date.  Why does the length annoy people?  So many movies are now 2 hours long (if not 3 hours) and it only seems reasonable.
The DVDs
While one DVD contains the film (which makes it worthwhile all on its own), the other contains all the special features.  I wasn't disappointed in the special features.  It contained more than the average DVD, but didn't go over the top either.  The nicest surprise was the spoof skit from the MTV Movie Awards, especially for those who hadn't seen it before.
Not that the special features aren't interesting, but because of the close release dates of the 2nd and 3rd installments of the Matrix Trilogy, I would expect a crazy special edition coming out after Revolutions is released, and an extra crazy ""Trilogy Edition"" soon after.  If you can't wait, go buy it now, otherwise I'd recommend holding off until the full set comes out later.
I've seen this movie well over 10 times now and each time I watch it I pick out something else that aids my understanding of the Matrix world.  Just sit back and enjoy the ride and read into as much as you want.  It resembles the Simpsons or animated movies - you can enjoy the surface humour, but if you look into it further, you can catch the not-so-obvious stuff that truly shows how clever the creators are.  Ergo, enjoy!",1066521600,,2815,4.5546719681908545

1467087,1,B00005JLTN,"There is nothing in this sequel that brings new meaning to the Matrix.
The script is ridiculous, there is no climax because there is no challenge: NEO can do anything he wants, fly, dodge bullets, resurrect.
Morpheus is now nothing more than a lunatic, delusional freedom warrior. Zion is a joke.
Dialogs are mechanical and have no flow whatsoever.
The only thing amazing in this movie are the FX.",1066521600,4,397,4.768115942028985
1467088,5,B00005JLTN,"""...[We] are here to understand the why, the reason...""-The Merovingian, Matrix Reloaded.
There is such poetry in this movie, both visual and spoken. The trick is to recognize and understand it. If one doesn't understand a certain poem, does one insult the integrity of it? If one did not understand Shakespeare, one would still recognize the pure genius poetry behind it, and would not call it ""crap"" or ""a waste of time and money"".
Just as Shakespeare was a master of the English language, poetry and stage, The Wachowski Brothers are masters of the visual medium know as movies. They utilize every resource known to literature and film making in order to craft their fine tale. This movie has everything: action, romance, philosophy; you name it and it is here.
The story is obviously a continuation of the first Matrix movie and the second chapter in the trilogy. Returning in the story is Neo, the one, Morpheus, mysterious and wise leader, and Trinity, sensitive yet firm warrior/lover. Neo, having acquired magnificent powers since the first Matrix film, must continue on his journey to save humanity from the ever-present threat of the evil Machines; but not without with the aid of Morpheus, Trinity and a whole slew of new and intriguing characters.

This film is a cornucopia of radically different ideas, yet the Wachowski brothers successfully mold all of the different elements into one cohesive whole. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie because, just like all of Poe's stories, this movie functions superbly on many different levels: One can enjoy this movie just for the action, devote in on the philosophical aspects of it, or ponder the question presented throughout the film.
While this is an extremely complicated movie (many, including myself, had to see it numerous times, and even get written transcripts of certain scenes to fully comprehend it all), it is nonetheless extremely enjoyable. The speeches of the Oracle, Merovingian and yes, the ever-confusing Architect all contribute fascinating questions about fate, faith and humanity: What exactly is control? How can one make decisions of one's path is already decided? What is the matrix, and is the purpose of the one really just another form of control?
The people who didn't understand this movie obviously didn't care enough to think it over and try to comprehend it. Those who argue that many scenes were boring, misplaced and unnecessary also didn't understand a damn thing about this movie. Everything in this movie is necessary to the whole of the story; EVERYTHING is extremely interesting if only one take the time to understand it. There is enough interesting information in this movie to write a book, and still fit brilliantly into this movie.
This movie is yet another landmark in filmmaking history, and should go down as one of the greatest movies of all time because of how smart and entertaining it is. I myself have seen this movie at least 15 times, and would recommend anyone who asks me to go and watch this movie. Confusing, yes, but if one devotes themselves for five minutes to actually understanding the film, it would be well worthwhile.
The DVD does come with two discs, yet has far less supplementary feature than the first movie; this is its one and only downfall. However, since the features included on the discs are enjoyable to watch, and the movie is still so good, I will still give this a five out of five, and would give it a ten out of five if I could.
Watch this movie, and even if you don't understand it at first, devote some time to understanding this movie, and the rewards will far outweigh the work put in.",1066521600,2,3627,4.878444084278768
1467089,4,B00005JLTN,"The only reason ""The Matrix Reloaded"" gets a four-star rating is because of the spectacular special effects.  Expect Oscar nominations for Best Visual Effects, Best Editing, and Best Cinematography.  The best scenes are the elaborate visual effects: characters morphing into the villian, the villian duplicating himself, flying through walls, the freeway fight scene, Neo flying like Superman, and many more.  No one can see any of the computer enhancements, a rarity for film.  The original score is wonderful, especially the techno music.  Though the editing and the sound effects are wonderful, they don't match the original.
Besides this, the plot is almost non-existant.  The only interesting events are Neo and Trinitys' love relationship.  Like many other action movies, the effects try to make up for everything else.  Some quotes stated don't make any sense and don't fit the storyline; example: ""you've already chosen if you'll accept the candy"".
Those who like action movies will enjoy this.  Those looking for more than just action may not like it as much.  The action and effects receive five stars.  The story plot receives less.  Fans should also look out for ""The Matrix Revolutions"", the conclusion of ""Reloaded"".

My parents are really big freaks about violence.  I mean they almost didn't let me get the first one.  I don't know why people think this movie is horrible.  The special effects are awesome.  So this movie is the best movie I have ever seen in my whole life.  It is also my favorite.  So, the parents who read this should decide better about this movie if they have sons that want to see it.  Not if they are under 10.

I can only speculate that Warner Bros. Home Video is planning another 'Matrix Revisited'-type DVD to sell separately and make more money off of.  'The Matrix Reloaded' itself is a rare work of art.  The DVD edition is about as pathetic as a Paramount DVD release.  It is the quintesential waste of the DVD format, offering little over a VHS tape edition or a bootleg.

Too much of Neo's ""Superman Thing"" with a digital Neo rather than the actor, and too much...amend that - a waste of time with the whole Zion thing. I hope that the next matrix is a lot better, but from what I have seen here, I seriously doubt it.

After seeing that, I couldn't take anything further in the story, seriously.
I kept saying to myself, ""Is it really worth all that effort to save THIS?""  THAT is what Morpheus was referring to when he said, ""Welcome to the REAL world."" ???  If that's the REAL world, I'll take the fake one.

However i went with a few different friends and eventually saw this movie three times in the theaters, and have since seen this alot since i bought the dvd. As with The Matrix, The Matrix: Reloaded doesn't make any sense and seems like nothing more than fights and elongated scenes, but if you look deeper into the movie, such as the Architect scene, and REALLY listen to what the Merovingian says, so much more answers as to what the matrix is are revealed, and, as usual, double the questions. This movie connects the dots for many of the questions you asked during the first movie, and also raises some new questions. Yes, The Wachowskis did make the fight scenes more numerous and longer this time around, but can you blame them considering how many people would not stop saying ""I know Kung Fu"" and raving about the fight scenes in the first one? For all the nay-sayers out there who watch it once and completely crap all over it, watch it again and again and look deeper than what you have been looking, because there is real substance there, and just like the first one, it takes so much more than just one viewing to realize how amazingly well written these movies are.",1066435200,2,1276,4.504310344827586

About the movie: I saw Matrix Reloaded twice in theatres, and enjoyed discussing it for weeks.  It has flaws, but who else out there besides the Wachowskis tries to put so much into their films?  (Peter Jackson does... but who else?)  Call this sequel pretentious or whatever ... but I call it a good effort, and great eye candy.  (And in any event, what else are you gonna do to fill your time until May 2005, when you get to watch the suckers camp on the sidewalk for a month just so they can be the first people disappointed by George Lucas' final Star Wars puppet show movie?
For such a ""groundbreaking"" movie as Matrix Reloaded, I would have appreciated more behind-the-scenes material, with slower, less intelligence-insulting edits, and more detail.

1467189,3,B00005JLTN,"To give the Wachowski brothers credit, they didn't attempt to duplicate the first film. While Reloaded doesn't suffer from middle film syndrome but it does have the Tween syndrome; it's missing the freshness of the first film (the baby)and doesn't have the maturity of what one hopes will be in the last film (the adult). OK, enough psychobabble nonsense. What works in the film are the various characters and the set pieces. There's still plenty of unanswered questions and the story is far from resolved (closing on the strongest cliff hanger since The Empire Strikes Back).
Is Reloaded a perfect film? Well, frankly no and for many folks it will be disappointing because of the lack of resolution (many people forget--and I'm not suggesting the quality is comparable to Empire from the Star Wars series--that it made the least amount of money of the original trilogy). It's entertaining and continue to break new ground.
Zion is under seige. The Matrix has discovered its location and is using huge drilling machines to reach the city. The Matrix is preparing a massive attack with hundres of thousands of the metallic Squid that act as its mobile army. Morpheus, Neo and Trinity are still waiting to hear from the Oracle.
The commander of the city's forces believes that Neo is not the savior of humanity and believes that the cryptic prophecy that Morpheus believes in is garbage. Nevertheless, Morpheus is granted his request to go back and plug into the Matrix when they receive a message from the Oracle for Neo.
Meanwhile Agent Smith has, quite literally, become a free agent. His encounter with Neo which should have destroyed his program, has freed him. He is now able to use his abilities to change other programs into duplicates of himself and infiltrate human minds. His goal is still the same; he wants to find the way into Zion so he can destroy it and Neo for his own ""personal"" reasons.
The stunning set pieces include a sequence on a freeway (built not too far from my home in Alameda, California)where mass destruction takes on new meaning. There's also a number of stunning fight sequences. I found the fight sequence with the mulitple Smiths and Neo to be too protracted and fake looking. It's clear which sequences were completely computer generated. The major flaw with the film is its lack of focus. The brothers throw everything that was successful from the first film into the second whether or not it has a place. The result is a film that goes off into too many action sequence tangents.
Matrix manages to be bigger and bolder than its predecessor. Clearly the brothers felt the need to top the first film. Instead, they should have relied on their instincts and crafted a much different film. There's elements of that different film buried under the weight of this sequel. Reloaded tries to be all things to all people when, in fact, the brother's should have followed their muse and created something different from the first film and as startlingly fresh as well. Reloaded is a good sequel that provides much action without much advancement in the plot.
It's a good sequel that could have been a great sequel. Nevertheless, the film is fun if you don't take it too seriously or focus on its flaws too much. I mentioned Superman in my title. The problem with Superman is that he's seemingly invicible. The human qualities of Superman make him interesting and when he's in peril it can be rather boring; everyone knows he'll win because, well, he's Superman. Let's hope that the third film doesn't fall into this predictable rut as well.",1066348800,3,3567,4.811074918566775
1467190,1,B00005JLTN,"The movie is terrible. I'm going to bottomline it for you. The first matrix was good, YES. The first matrix was intresting, action packed and awesome... YES. The second matrix movie, this one, not only uses the exact same ideas from the first one, but also decides to throw in some of the worst and most boring scenes ever.
I can't see why people keep saying. ""Well it looked great, the twins rocked!"" Yea, the effects are good. But that doesn't make a good movie. You won't automatically love a book based on the cover would you? Thats what people are doing.
The movie had virtually no plot presented. It starts with nothing, then tells you about the oracle, then the key maker. After that we learn there is an architect. Why are we going to see the architect? Why are we seeing the oracle again? What is the point and motivation? We don't even get to see Zion do anything except rave.
Ok so the reason the movie is bad is a terrible plot, wasted talent, and yes one huge reason that people don't seem to grasp. Useless scenes. I mean, ill name some/
-The chinese dude fighting Neo.
-The rave, which lasted 18 minutes.
-That one progammer and his uninteresting wife giving that chick and piece of cake.
-The 15 minute breifing about turning off the power to 2 buildings.
-The 15 minute fight between neo and 20 agent smiths. Mind you that he just leaves at the end, which he could of done the whole time.
-The scene where we learn about Link from Dozer's sister or whatever.
-The architect talk, which lasts about 30 minutes. Keep in mind that his confusing speech doesn't tell you anything except that the wachoski brothers have a really weird idea.
Honestly, the worst scene is the architect. He just confuses and acts weird. like 15 men and 7 women start a new zion? Why? Why do u want to destroy zion and remake it? Why do you allow the one to live?
The most horrible thing though? The sound. Punches and kicks are so weak. They are more like swipes. The sound guy did a terrible job, because the punches and kicks don't make you go, ""Whoa THAT WAS AWESOME"". Instead they sound stupid and weak. Like, add more base and they would of rocked. The first matrix didn't have this problem.
All in all? Why do people keep giving this movie 5's? Because it is the sequel to the Matrix. Honestly, the movie is boring, more of the same fights and less of the great story. This is one of the worst sequels ever, sorry wachowski brothers, but your vision isn't that great.
Also, the movie only has 3 and a half stars. Mostly because hundreds of people spammed it with 5 stars before it came out. Honestly, there are so many movies around with 4 stars that 3 and a half stars has to tell you something. It tells you that this movie is bad, because so many people dislike it. Don't believe those people who rave about the architect, he was confusing and dumb.",1066348800,,2850,4.409867172675522
1467191,2,B00005JLTN,"Ok, we have to all agree that The Matrix was one of the coolest movies we've seen but the sequel isn't as good. Looking at the trailers, we thought it might be very good but instead it wasn't. I noticed that there is too much dialogue, worth of trash. Just too much dialogue, too long dialogue, too boring dialogue, there's more dialogue then action sequences and it's boring. Reloaded isn't as good as it looks. But if your a die hard Matrix fan, you should get it, it has hours of bonus features. Watch for Revolutions which looks pretty good.",1066348800,,545,4.46
1467192,4,B00005JLTN,"I bought the DVD today, I am hoping that if I see it again it will make more sense!
I saw it the day it came out in the theaters, and I admit I had high expectations considering how much I loved the first one.  This one was great visually, I can't trash it there!  My favorite scenes are the ones with the twins, they are incredible!  My only issues with the movie are the writing and unnecessarily long scenes.  I'm willing to let it go that Neo has these amazing superpowers, yet he fights with all the Agent Smiths for 20 minutes and doesn't win, he retreats by flying away (why didn't he do that originally??).  I can forgive that, since in most fantasy stories there are things that won't make sense.  What irritated me was the extended Zion & Neo/Trinity love scene which was beautifully done, but WAY too long.  I think a bit more editing would have made it 100 times better!
I am excited about the 3rd movie as well - I can't wait to see what happens!  Hopefully between seeing Reloaded on DVD and seeing the third one, I'll finally understand what the heck is going on. ;)",1066348800,,1081,4.29064039408867
1467193,5,B00005JLTN,"Despite what other reviews you might read here, you have to consider one thing:""Matrix Reloaded"" is Science Fiction, therefore, anything goes. The movie is basically a superhero cartoon, albeit, stylized and updated, complete with computer and techno jargon. The sequel to the astonishing ""Matrix"" stands well on its own (although, it is almost imperative that you watch the first installment in order to fully appreciate this sequel).The Wachowski bros. had the immense task to outdo themselves and outdo the expectations of the loyal following ""Matrix"" spawned, and that was no easy task. ""Matrix Reloded"" is vistually ""loaded"" with action-packed scenes and mind bending special effects (the highway chase being probably the highlight of the movie). The development of characters is interesting, as we get to see Neo's and Trinity's romance intensify and get some background on Morpheus past love life. We also know that even within the Matrix, there's a conflict between what's right and wrong (won't say much, since I don't want to spoil the movie for you!). Keanu Reeves perfomance of Neo is again, stiff! But it suits the character well. If there was anything annoying about this movie was, probably, the dance scene in Zion. Sure, you get to see some nice looking bods, but that's about it. For a group of people who are about to embark on a grand scale war with a superior enemy, dancing would be the last thing on my mind!
One more thing: this is a movie that needs to be seen at least a couple of times to fully grasp the psychological and existential undertones of the plot. They are mind blowing, but perhaps a bit too deep for your regular teenager. Having said that, ""Matrix Reloaded"" is a blast, and one of the best sequels I've ever seen (Living proof that NOT all sequels stink!).",1066348800,3,1797,4.875816993464053
1467194,4,B00005JLTN,"I love The Matrix series just as much as the next person.  It is one of the best ones out there.  The first Matrix was extremely good and made me want the second one mere seconds after it ended.  I saw the second one, Reloaded, in theaters and I loved it.  Now that's just me and you can think whatever you want about it.  I loved it because it went further into the story and introduced new characters, locations, vehicles, and fighting moves.  It showed us Zion and the people who live there.  The action sequences and fight scenes were amazing.  I thought the best ones were the burly brawl and the freeway chase.
  Now for the things that brought it down.  First of all, I think some didn't like it as much because of all the hype it caused.  They expected too much from it and that made them forget that it was actually pretty good.  Also, the story was kind of confusing, but the third movie should explain a lot.  It was almost like they tried to explain and cram too much into a single movie.
  If you can look past the minor problems, then there is a really good movie here.  It isn't as good as the first one, but if you're a fan of the series or you just happened to watch this for some other reason, I really suggest that you pick this one up.  If you have a DVD player, get it on DVD.  If not, I'm sorry.  The Matrix: Reloaded is one of my favorite movies, right up there with the first one.",1066348800,,1404,4.12962962962963

Keanu's easy-going acting style is perfect for the role of Neo, and Laurence Fishburne is just plain awesome as Morpheus (even if he did put on a few extra pounds).  This movie has everything you could ask for; a plot you have to think about, great action sequences, one of the best Dolby mixes ever, and Jada Pinkett Smith.  The special features are terrific.
I highly recommend this DVD.",1066348800,2,501,4.724137931034483
1467248,5,B00005JLTN,"Well, to begin I would like to say that I'm a huge fan of the matrix movies (including the ENTER THE MATRIX computer game). I remember back in 1999, many people didn't even care about the first movie. Now in 2003 I've known a lot of people that don't like the sequel. They asked how could it be possible for Neo to have all those amazing powers, some kind of God-like attributes. When I asked them if they liked the first part they were surprised due to fact that they didn't know that there is a first Matrix movie, I was completely shocked, horrified. They even have that kind of courage to talk nonsense about THE MATRIX RELOADED, how can they talk that way if they haven't seen the first movie? Now I know for sure why they can't understand almost the whole movie. The way I rate this movie is due to the fact that it is a SCIENCE FICTION movie. I highlight science fiction for those who talk bad about the movie. Whenever you go to a theater, you have to be aware of what kind of movie you are about to see and experience. If I'm just about to see Matrix Reloaded, then special effects will have to be used to give the movie its reason of being. If you don't like science fiction movies or special effects, then what the hell are you sitting there, move your ass and go to see the Lion King then, for instance. Unluckily, many people agree that the movie sucks, that there are parts that are just fillers. I strongly believe that The Matrix is the most amazing science - fiction story ever done. The cast is just perfect and well prototyped for a story of this magnitude. I'm aware that the first part had a special impact on me and almost everybody. But then I got to think and ask myself. Have you ever seen a movie like that?
Have you ever seen those special effects? Have you ever seen that kind of revolution when talking about movies' categories?The answer to these threee questions : NO, NO, NO. Though the first part didn't get the deserved audience attention, it is a 4 Academy Award Winner. I really enjoyed The Matrix Reloaded right from the start, because it begins just like the first part, with trinity fighting cops including the amazing special effects. The sequence of Neo and agents trying to eliminate him is the best computer generated sequence ever. I'm not forgetting about the freeway chase with Trinity showing her skills with a motorcycle. To finish, the violent collision of the big trucks, just perfect. We'll have to wait weeks to watch the end of this whole story in THE MATRIX REVOLUTIONS. Finally , for those who criticise the movie and the story within, specially adult people, they have to know that THE MATRIX movies' mania is not impossible, it's INEVITABLE.
Write me : raiderstate@hotmail.com I'd be glad to see your comments about the movie whether good or bad.",1066348800,3,2803,4.4980392156862745
1467249,2,B00005JLTN,"Reloaded couldn't be a more appropriate title for this movie. Why? Well ""The Matrix Reloaded"" is just that, rehashed stunts, reiterated philosophical themes, and the reappearance of characters from the previous film. What distinguishes this sequel from its predecessor is not anything truly novel or qualitatively different. Its claim to distinction is purely quantitative. Neo, instead of dodging and stopping a few bullets from one, two, or three agents toting hand guns, now evades and halts a whole barrage of ammunition from a whole assortment of adversaries carrying more hefty artillery. In the first film Reeves' character fought one agent Smith and two of his cohorts, now he fights against an innumerable horde of agent Smiths. The original Matrix had Neo performing a whole host of gravity defying wire assisted acrobatics to veer around bullets and stay suspended in the air for short periods of time, and in this second installment he still defies gravity except he is able to do it indefinitely to the point where he flies like Superman. Neo, is still the stoic, sometimes confused character, at the center of this movie, and he is still accompanied by a John the Baptist like, messiah worshiping, cryptic philosophical musing Morpheaus played by Laurence Fishburne, and of course to finish of the triangle we have the leather clad pasty Carrie-Anne Moss as Trinity.
With the same bullet time effects, martial arts wire tricks, and green veneer, the only thing different about this film is that everything is embellished to ridiculous proportions. In fact that's probably what they should have called this movie ""The Matrix : Embellished"" or ""The Matrix : Really, Really Big Encore"".  I suppose the Wachowski brothers are not from the school that emphasizes less is more. Its unfortunate that this duo didn't realize that though the technical wizardry of the original Matrix was ingenious at the time it has become clichd and ubiquitous within Hollywood action cinema today. Every film from Tom Cruise's ""MI2"" to Jet Li's ""The One"" has used these celluloid illusions to help bolster their visual appeal. It has also been spoofed so many times from such satirical films as ""Scary Movie"" and ""Kung Pow ! Enter The Fist"" Granted the production team responsible for the Matrix franchise does perform these effects better than any other FX crew, but that still does not change the fact that what made the original Matrix such a visual phenomenon was that it was an aesthetic novelty. Yet, that novelty has been robbed by so many copycats that no amount of perfecting the process or enlarging the process can bring back its original appeal.
 ""The Matrix"" was more than a visually stunning movie, it also had a rich and innovative storyline replete with many hefty philosophical and theologically charged issues from solipsism, existentialism and determinism to Christological parallels and gnosticism. So much substantive material for thought was in ""The Matrix"" that the movie spawned serious academic discussion concerning the film, its message, and its societal implications (see ""The Matrix and Philosophy : Welcome To The Desert of The Real"", ""The Gospel Reloaded : Exploring Spirituality and Faith In The Matrix"" and excerpts from ""Hollywood Worldviews : Watching Films With Wisdom and Discernment"").
Though the sequel to ""The Matrix"" is considerably longer than the original that is no indication that the plot is any better or more in depth. In fact how can the plot be better when there is no believable point of conflict - a central element in any plot? A conflict cannot exist if the protagonist has nothing of comparable strength to challenge him. How can Neo have a formidable adversary when the Wachowski brothers, in their infinite wisdom, decided to confer upon Neo, at least when he wired to the Matrix, God like omnipotence? He's practically impervious to attack as demonstrated by his skirmish with numerous clones of Agent Smith; he can wish bullets to stop and be redirected on a whim; and if he gets tired or bored of fighting, well up up and away he goes. For heaven sake he can even resurrect people in ""Reloaded""! It is quite obvious that Neo is intended to have a Messianic role that borrows from Christian imagery, but the whole Lazarus routine he performs on his beloved borders on cheesy.
At least in the predecessor to this film there was a process of self-actualization that had to take place before Neo could fully manipulate the Matrix. During that time he was vulnerable to injury and death. Hence, opponents like agent Smith were truly menacing villains precisely because they were real threats. Now agent Smith, or should I say Smiths, are nothing more than punching bags for the virtually invincible Neo.
Even many of the intellectual challenges faced by Neo have been removed. He no longer has to discover for himself that the world he has been immersed in is purely a faade, a nod to the solipsists' school of thought. There is no longer a question about his role as a savior, where in the first film his status as ""The One"" was questioned by everyone with the exception of the unwavering Morpheaus.
With no major intellectual issue to address, except for an expansion on themes of freewill and determinism, there isn't much to stimulate the mind in this picture. Unfortunately even these issue were treated poorly because they were addressed in a most convoluted manner, when Neo and the image of the architect of the Matrix have a dialogue that used language that was so heavily laden in esoteric computer jargon that even a technically sophisticated person would have a hard time making sense of it (I am speaking as programmer by the way).
All in all it is unfortunate that the Wachowskis did not leave the first film alone. I am glad that they reloaded their pockets from the profits made from this picture. It's just sad that we had to unload our wallets in order to see it.",1066348800,2,5927,4.949799196787149
1467250,3,B00005JLTN,"Yes, this is part of a trilogy but as a movie by itself it lacks the goods to be satisfying. There are too many questions that are raised here but not an effort to at least give a hint about what is going on. In another words, this film needed to at least give a solid story as part as a whole than to cut it off at the end with out much explanation about what is happing right in front of you. A good example of a solid middle entry in a trilogy is The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers. It not only expanded what was set forth with the first entry but also gave a solid story with an ending that raises the issues of what will come in the next chapter.
Don't get me wrong, The Matrix Reloaded is a good film but it needed to stand on its own feet to be a solid movie.",1066348800,5,769,3.782608695652174

In comparison to other movie releases, and sequels, this movie left me in the theater wanting more.  My wife actually watched this movie and became a fan.  She slept through The Hulk!  The Wachowski Brothers know what they are doing.  Make an epic, kick ass, action movie to enjoy as a trilogy.
The Matrix will always be better than then Reloaded or Revolutions. Why?  Because its the original!  Only a few sequals ever offer the same or better quality than the 1st.  Scenes like the Kung Fu training, Lobby shoot out, and learning what the Matrix was with Neo can only by done in the 1st movie.
The Matrix series is not movies of eye candy like other big budget movies that have been released in the past.  It has an in depth story, dynamic characters, drama, action, momments of laughter, and you don't get bored.  These are the reason we pay to go to the movies and buy DVD's.

1467252,3,B00005JLTN,"Matrix was immensely enjoyable for its clean cut action, simple plot and clearly defined characters. Like Raiders of the Lost Ark it had a simple story line, clear distinctions between the good guys/girls and the baddies.
Sequels have the annoying habit of complicating storylines and adding meaningless threats to distract and annoy the audience. Reloaded almost achieved this. The action was good as were the effects, although the powers of Neo in the Matrix are more akin to those of superman rather than those of a mythical hero struggling to understand his destiny and accept it.
Unlike the original Matrix, which was a complete film in its own right, this is half a film. Many questions are left unanswered ...is the prophecy true ?, is the ""real world""..real or just anotjher level of the Matrix?...
To judge this film without seeing its conclusion is like trying to judge the future. A well thought out third part will nicely end the triology, however an attempt to over sophisticate the story will simply leave one wondering why they ever made two sequels.
The advice is wait and see.",1066348800,5,1093,4.881720430107527
1467253,4,B00005JLTN,"Warning - Spoilers ahead . . .
When I first saw the film, well, I didn't like it too much.  It seemed to be over-packed with CGI Fight scenes and a storyline that didn't really mean anything.  While Zion is under attack, Neo, Trinity, and Morpheus must find the keymaster to unlock the doors to the mainframe and end the war, thus freeing Zion.
This entire storyline, to me, seemed contrived, making the fight scenes seem meeningless, their overzealous and sometimes long running effects just becoming tiresome.
But, then I got it.  Weeks after seeing it, it finally clicked.
They symbolism of these films is much deeper than the average action-movie viewer is usually given.  Yes -- the entire ""The One-Saves the world"" storyline is meaningless, and that's the point.  While paying too much attention to events within the computer-generated fantasy world of the Matrix, the real world, and Zion, fall into greater danger.
We are introduced to two 'french' characters, programs, which exist simply to experience life.  While they are among the long list of villians in this piece, they are also the key to the story.  They describe the situation in as much in the film, seeing our heroes as mere puppets in a meaningless plot, which, in fact, they are.
While are main characters are engaged in a meaningless task, struggling to achieve goal after goal in a virtual world, events of the real world are dire, and, just perhaps, if more attention were paid to the real-world events, perhaps the situation would not be so dire.
It is not until Neo discovers that his existance as 'the one' is simply another level of control set in place by the machines, that the entire struggle within the virtual world of the Matrix has no real meaning, only then does the truth come to light, just in time for this second chapter to come to a close.
Think about it, how many people do you know who obsess on politics, or sports, or their favorite television show, or even the Matrix itself?  We engage in meaningless struggles to achieve goals that, in the end, really have no meaning but to feed our own ego.
A very profound statement to be made by an action film, that is, if the third and final installment draws this observation out.
As I see it, the value of this second episode is entirely dependent upon the content of the third chapter, but the potential is much greater than most people give it credit for.

1467316,3,B00005JLTN,"The Matrix underwhelmed me when I first saw it; admittedly, I saw it after much of the hype was underway, but I always wondered why it was such a craze.  I saw Reloaded when it came out, and again was sorely underwhelmed - though this time half the field was agreeing with me.  But after the movie I finally picked the original up on DVD, and liked it a lot more on re-viewing.  With that in mind, I picked up The Matrix Reloaded on DVD, to see if it would grow on me like the first one has.
It did, actually.  The Matrix Reloaded is smarter than I initially gave it credit for, and the action scenes actually hold up quite well on multiple sittings.  The problem is not really technical (though the overhyped ""Burly Brawl"" is so blatantly CGI it hurts) so much as it is with editing.  Most of the action scenes go on too long.  There's some really astonishing stuff that goes on, but it tries to hold the tension longer than it is good for and a number of such scenes lose their impact before the end.  Aside from the artful fight before the Oracle meeting, the freeway is the best of them; but again, this simply lasts too long for its dramatic potential.
The ""Burly Brawl,"" on the other hand, did not work for me.  Many of the fight's moves were sheer poetry in motion; you could really tell that everyone involved was crafting it lovingly.  But, the fight came out of nowhere and lacked the insane sense of urgency that the brilliant subway fight in the original film had.  I have nothing against a scene of this scope, but it needs to be for a desperate reason.  When the hero can just fly away, it becomes the filmmakers showing off.
The rave / sex scene early on is...misguided.  It was actually pulled off fairly well (if it lacked a certain sense of taste) and did have some revealing purpose; but again, it went on too long and seemed as if it were in lieu of characterization.  The sex couldn't pull off the fact that, together, Carrie-Ann Moss and Keanu Reeves have not really generated a believable spark since one tense moment in the club in the first movie.  This is a tragedy of filmmaking in general nowadays; rather than rely on chemistry and submerged sexual tension (watch The Adventures of Robin Hood with Errol Flynn for a classic example), characters hop into the sack fairly quickly and waste it all.  A shot or two of their hands came close to conveying it, but that was the best the Wachowskis got out of it.
I actually really enjoyed the scenes where Neo meets with the Oracle, the Merovingian, and the Architect.  The Oracle seems to be making the original film's pat Campbellian structure questionable in a really interesting way; the Merovingian's trick with the cake was actually brilliant in a discussion of causality given the sort of metaphysics the first one asks us to consider; and the Architect's room was pure science fiction brilliance.  With stoic, clipped acting on both sides, and the amazing device of the monitors (which we saw briefly in the original), the Architect's scene stands as one of the best in the whole movie.
The acting is okay.  It deserves no awards, but it did convey what it needed to convey at the appropriate times.  The attacks on it are exaggerated.  Most of the disappointment seems to be the chemistry, the fact that Keanu Reeves talks, and the fact that Laurence Fishburne has abandoned the mystery man of the original in favor of, you know, actually developing his character.
This is a film that could've been really good (I'll reserve the question of ""greatness"" for the final product) if it had reined in its running time by about 20 minutes, cut fairly evenly from the big action scenes.  As it stands, there's a good amount of lag in the storytelling on top of the interruption that is the Burly Brawl.  Some really memorable moments are created in the Matrix Reloaded, and the story is very interesting both dramatically and philosophically, but the directors went too far in showing them off.  I just hope Revolutions provides a degree of redemption for the trilogy.
A word on the DVD:  if I'd actually bought it at MSRP, I'd be royally ticked off.  The film lacks a commentary track, which is a crime, seeing as how much the original popularized such tracks.  The ""Crash Course"" featurette on the making of the freeway scene is a really cool look into technical filmmaking, but ""Preload"" is too much fluff for its worth and the rest is straight fluff.  I did get a kick out of the MTV Movie Awards Reloaded.  But, at such a high price I'd expect a commentary and a more packed second disc.",1066262400,2,4566,4.540903540903541
1467317,5,B00005JLTN,"Having thought the DVD was due November 14th for some reason I was very happy to see it a month earlier.  Rushing home I immediately cranked it up on the big screen.  Reloaded continues where the original left off, Neo resigns himself to the role of `the One' but wonders what his purpose in the larger scheme of things is.  With the machines drilling towards Zion, Morpheus, Trinity, Neo and the guy from Oz head to the oracle for some last minute wisdom.  Told to get the Key Maker they proceed to rescue him from an old exiled rogue program and attempt to get into the source of the program where Neo will eventually confront the architect of the Matrix.  The second film ratchets up the effects, taking advantage of advances in computer graphics since the original debuted; to stunning results.  The highway scene is one of the, if not THE most maniacally amazing car chase put to film, making the Blues Brothers pile ups pale in comparison [granted, different technologies].  It is so engrossing I find myself just going back to that chapter in the DVD and watching it in awe over and over.  Like LOTR: Twin Towers, this second installment in a trilogy does not lag like many before it.  It builds on the original mythos and expands the character set somewhat.  Further cerebral philosophical games are played when Neo confronts the Architect and learns about the history of the Matrix and his place in it.  Beyond that we glimpse yet another potential layer of the Matrix being peeled back at the very end, setting up the third installment, Matrix Revolutions nicely.  This is a marvelous sci-fi action flick with an excellent back story, highly recommended.",1066262400,,1664,4.739583333333333

Those long periods of dialogue (which many have complained about) actually add a great deal to the movie and offer a discussion of power and the interrelationship between man and machine which is unmatched by other ""Hollywood"" films.
So why the three stars???  My main beef is with the DVD extras (why not include a commentary).  The picture and sound presentation are excellent but the second disc is mainly full of self-promotional material which does not help the viewer understand the construction of the movie anymore than watching the preview.

The main gist of the film appears to be a link in the trilogy - as ""Empire strikes Back "" linked the Star wars trilogy and filled in a few gaps and opened a few doors, so does this excellent sequel.  There is, quite obviously and apparently, a huge emphasis on the use of CGI in the film and in part elements that are supposed to look ""human doing amazing things"" look to slick and too generated - this however i feel adds to the feel of the film as a whole - the fight sequences are perfectly orchestrated as is the awesome freeway chase m- this is after all a computer generated dreamworld so in the sense of the film the imagery should look as it does - it gives the film that extra edge i feel.
There has been a lot of criticism with regards to the ""pseudo psychobabble "" that is present in much of the dialogue with various characters i.e. the merovingian, the oracle, the Architect in particular - admittedly on first seeing the film at the pictures the emphasis on watching the film is more on the special effects and this convoluted dialogue can seem a bit tedious and pointless - its only on watching the film on dvd a few times and actually digesting this text does it actually make sense and there are explanations for the Matrix itself there and also commentaries on life itself.  Stick with it guys when you do watch the film - it is important to the overall plot and does actually make sense. Again the sequence regarding Zion near the begininning of the film - Zion was mentioned a lot in the first film and it was essential to give the feel of the scale of Zion and its inhabitants - in a high tech world, Zion has an almost lo-tech tribal feel to it - of mankind returning to a time gone past and their most primal instinct fuelled by heavy rhythmic drum beats.
I thoroughly enjoyed ""Reloaded"" from begining to end - the whole concept and the Wachowskis brothers vision , although not a completely original idea (this dystopian future where machine rules man), the concept the have created here is truly fascinating and the whole trilogy will un doubtedly become a cult classic in years to come , if not for the ground breaking cinematography for the concept alone.  As Terminator 2 set a precedent for visual effects, so does the Matrix for its use of almost three dimensional camera shots.  Already we are seeing Matrix ""copies"" and reviewers commenting on films that are ""like the Matrix"" - mainly down to the action sequences (""Equilibrium"" springs to mind - seeming to emulate the Matrix in both fight sequences and clothing (See Christian Bale in his long dark overcoat ala Neo!)
Favourite character has to be the seemingly indestructible Agent Smith (played by Hugo Weaver - ""Lord of the Rings"", ""Priscilla Quuen of the Desert"".)  There is an air of almost sinister campness about him as he spits verbal venom at Neo on more than one occasion.  His loathing of Neo is evident and he displays this with a cool arrogant manner that would make a snake think twice before stiking !
All in all , The Matrix Reloaded is the perfect visual entertainment for the modern 21st age - in this time of technological advances a film like this is fascinating to dissect and digest and the concept may seem hard to follow, but it is truly worth following.  I look forward to ""Revolutions"" with sustained glee....!!",1066262400,,3555,4.502325581395349

1467322,4,B00005JLTN,"Overall I have found the Matrix concept to be fascinating and entertaining.  I felt that the first movie in this series was the best new SF movie to come out since GATTACA.  Like most movies it had both good and bad aspects to it.
  Some of the flaws:  The story was not as engaging as the first movie.  To be fair, it would be very difficult to follow up on the first movie.  However, this movie had an unfinished feel to it that left me a little cold.  It served as an excellent lead in for Matrix: Revolutions, but left something to be desired as a stand-alone film.  Additionally, some of the effects were over done, and a bit cheesy.  The use of 'bullet time' was, I felt, over used.  While cool, using so many sequences in each fight scene (esp. Neo vs. the multiple agent Smiths) tended to bog the action down.  Some of the CG work looked plastic and very unrealistic.  As far as characters went, not enough development was done with Trinity.  While Morpheus was developed, he was presented as an almost irrational fanatic.  It made it harder for me to connect with him.
  Positives:  While the action could have been better done, there was plenty of it.  The movie was overall quite a thrill ride.  I felt that the ending was great, and raised many questions that I have enjoyed pondering.  I enjoyed seeing Zion, and I felt that introducing the whole 'Architect' and repeating history story Arc, was great.
  Overall, it was a good movie.  Could have been better, but I will wait until Revolutions, before I condemn the series.",1066262400,6,1536,4.501818181818182

Where this movie falls short is it's subtle dialogue and million-dollar words, that go over the heads of most people.  How many times did you need to rewind to just understand the Architect?
Anyhow, this movie is very good upon second viewings.  Where I am dissapointed is it's lack of bonus material.  DVD is supposed to be about the supliments, yet this set falls short.  I really wonder why it was 2 discs when only one was needed.",1066176000,5,585,4.330275229357798

1467366,4,B00005JLTN,"Despite the mixed reviews by Matrix fans upon it's release, The Matrix Reloaded may not be as mind blowing as the original, but it's still a great piece of film.  The co-writing and co-directing Wachowski brothers upped the ante on everything in this first sequel: the Matrix mythology is expanded more than one could have ever thought of with plenty of brain teasing secrets revealed that purposely lead into the next film.  The action has been considerably upped as well (this is a film produced by Joel Silver after all), with the fight scenes becoming more elaborate scenes of fist fueled carnage, and the much talked about ""burly brawl"" in which Neo (Keanu Reeves) takes on hundreds of multiplying Agent Smith's (Hugo Weaving) is a mix of real time fighting with overdone CGI effects that doesn't exactly gel together.  The highway scene is amazingly put together, and worth the price of admission alone.  However, The Matrix Reloaded just doesn't hold all the mind bending surprises and revelations that the original film did.  Monica Bellucci's much hyped about role in the film is nothing more than an extended cameo, and Jada Pinkett-Smith is criminally underused in her role.  All it's criticisms aside though, The Matrix Reloaded is still a great film, but if your expecting something as phenominal as the original, you won't find it here.  The DVD features are surprisingly (then again, this is Warner Bros. after all) not all that plentiful (not even a commentary) which in itself is a big disappointment for those hoping for a bounty of extras.",1066176000,3,1558,4.946360153256705

I think the Wirters/directors intend to give a more human face to the story. More than the struggles of few caracthers, but the survivor og the hole race. I specially like the part when Neo is revealed as a containment program. The same way the agents of the first one can hack into any ""system"" ,  Does this program hacked inside NEO? Obviously they can interact in and out of the matrix, (Remember when Smith, took posetion of Bane's system) I want to know the explanation of why Neo have powers outside the matrix (REVOLUTIONS)
I give the movie 4 stars because everybody looks at them as a joint venture. Even is not like the first is like a more mature version (if you can say Sci Fi filming is mature) of the first one. Reloaded cannot and would not top the original but it's a good sequel with a more elaborated story. I can Wait to see how everythig wraps up. Te same is happening with everybody waiting for SW episode 3, we only want to see see the whole picture, Even when episode 2 was better the 1, I belived Revolutions is going to satisfy and clear many things that us, Matrix fans, have.",1066176000,,1274,4.308333333333334

1467372,5,B00005JLTN,"The Matrix was one of the most original movies ever made. It breathed a fresh breath of air into movies and especially the sci-fi area of it.
The Matrix Reloaded picks up where The Matrix left us. Neo(Reeves) is now the one. He realizes he is different. The machines are drilling towards Zion and the people there are worried. Morpheus(Fishburne) takes Neo and Trinity(Moss) back into the Matrix to see if they can stop the machines all together.
There is more to the plot and story than that, it's just very complex and has to be seen to be understood. The story is just like the Matrix in that it is very original. It's an awesome script and everybody does well with there character.
Keanu Reeves deserves an Oscar for his work as Neo. He had done an awesome job playing the character. Neo is a very complex character that has many sides to him and Reeves has shown us the sides and emotions, and it can only get better with the next Matrix movie.
Laurence Fishburne once again continues to be the Obi-wan Kenobi for a new generation. He deserves an Oscar as well. He's such a great actor and Morpheus is a smooth character.
Hugo Weaving is back as Agent Smith in the movie. He does such a good job making you hate him. He has an important part in the film, and his fight with Neo when there are tons of him is cool. One of the best fights in movie history. There final showdown should be even better.
The special effects are one of the best reasons to see the Matrix Reloaded. The first Matrix movie brought us the most advancement in movies since T2 Judgement Day and Reloaded continues with some of the best effects ever seen. The CGI fights look real. Once again we have bullet time shots which really look coo. There is also a 15 minute car chase with two really cool bad guys. A must see.
Monica Bellucci also has an important part in the movie. The Italian model will be a big thing in the U.S. one day and this series is whats gonna make her huge here.
Overall the Matrix Reloaded is one of the best films of the year. It's a must see. The DVD is spectacular and a must for any collection. Don't miss out on the Matrix phenomenom.",1066176000,3,2140,4.325870646766169

The fight sequences and the spectacular car chase (actual California commute footage, by the way) are state of the art, and the plot actually is not as simple-minded as the critics contend. For example, when the Oracle tells Neo that even the crows have an elaborate program code written to govern their actions, one is reminded of Biblical and literary references to no sparrow falling without God's notice. Although the underlying plot device of comatose human slavery powering the Matrix is awfully hard to buy on a literal level in the first movie, this second movie sucessfully raises questions about choice, free will, and predestination. Up for grabs are the cosmologies of the Bible, Darwin, and William Gibson. Admittedly, there is a certain garbled quality to the revelations offered at the end, but they hook you into the last installment, don't they? I suspect much of what we are told will probably be refuted in Matrix Revolutions, but that is part of the intellectual fun of the entire concept. It does some good for those of us who habituate a two-dimensional electronic environment to remember that the boundary between the real and the perceived is subject to survey.",1066176000,,1420,5.098712446351931

I thought the movie was good, the rave was silly and I was majorly amused by the people who hated the film. After all, what people don't seem to realize is a middle film in a trilogy is just that, the middle, they can only do so much without ending the story. Most of the story plot action is the first film and will be in the third film. So why be hard on the film? Now that you have the DVD you can skip through the Rave and enjoy the rest. I admit I didn't see this film more than twice when in theaters, and one of those times was when it was re-issued on IMAX screens (Matix I must have seen 6+ times) But I think the movie does what it is suppose to do. Moves the story line along (dangles a few new things that will explain the last movie installment to come) and surrounded it with kick-ass chase and fight scenes. I try to see the movie on it's own and not have it conform to past memories and feelings of the last movie (though I am sorry they got rid of the operator...he was a cutie).

1467424,2,B00005JLTN,"... you'd think they could do better. The Matrix was an okay film in itself, though the ecstatic screams of its fans mask the fact that virtually everything they were going ga-ga over had been done before, and better, by a number of other films. It had one screamingly stupid plot hole, but that doesn't make it unique either. I thought that with the second film they might be able to come up with something interesting, having now established their background.
Sadly, the result is considerably LESS than its predecessor promised. I don't know if it's the direction or Reeves' interpretation, but Keanu is, if anything, more woodenly expressionless in Matrix Reloaded than he was in the first Matrix -- which wasn't at all his best work in the area of expression. There's a far too overextended and sadly uninteresting sex sequence (I understand the story point, but it's far too long just to make the point), and somehow the choreography doesn't quite WORK. In that, it reminded me of Tomb Raider (the first movie): here you have all these elements that SHOULD work, and somehow it's all falling completely flat.
Alas. Something interesting could have been done with this, but instead we just get lots of lackluster acrobatics and combat scenes.",1066176000,2,1247,4.886792452830188
1467425,3,B00005JLTN,"I liked The Matrix a lot. Who didn't, really? However, I've always restrained myself from the deification that is thrust upon it. I wanted more plot and ideas and less special effects and shootouts. I never found The Matrix completely satisfying because the Wachowski brothers managed to nullify their great ideas with Hollywood predictability. To quote Roger Ebert, ""There's something disappointing about a movie that begins by questioning the nature of the universe and ends with a shootout.""
The Matrix Reloaded is an even bigger example of this. The ""plot"" being used as a tool for stringing along a series of action sequences and CGI effects. Lots and lots of CGI effects. How much? Just think of the most CGI you can imagine in a movie and then double it. That's The Matrix Reloaded. Perhaps it's appropriate since the story itself deals with computer programs, however to me The Matrix Reloaded felt less like a film and more like a video game that you are unable to control.
This coupled with George Lucas' Episodes 1 and 2 has made me wary of modern movie technology. Gone is the mystery of movie special effects. It's no longer, ""How did they do that?"". Now it's ""What computer program did they use to do that?"". I know I sound like an old fogey (I'm only 23) but they truly don't make 'em like they used to. If this is filmmaking for the 21st century, then I will happily stay in the past with my CGI-free copies of The Godfather and Casablanca.",1066176000,,1456,4.647286821705427
1467426,4,B00005JLTN,"How do you top a global phenomenon? Easy, make 2. The Wachowski Brothers(directors) and Joel Silver(producer) first blew people's minds with 1999's the Matrix.  It really was something nobody had seen before. So to top it they went over the top, and possibly a little overboard.
Neo, now the One, and Trinity are lovers now and he keeps having nightmares of her.  In the middle of this, sentinels(those big bug-like things at the end of the first one) have been dispatched to destroy Zion, the last city on Earth and Neo and Co. are giving very little time to do so.  So Neo goes here and there getting answers and stopping the machines.
The problem with this? You can obviously see Silver and the Wachowskis took their budget and used it a lot on special effects.  Remember how in the Matrix the bullet time effect really only rotated around the central screen? Now it's going all over the place.  Remember Neo's brief but sweet fight against Smith in the subway? Well now he's facing 100 of them. Therein lies the problem: waaaaaaay too much.  More fights, more longer fights and more ""dazzling"" effects, and they do dazzle. But then they go.....and go......and go...... and so on.
Despite story shortcomings and an obvious penchant for bigger effects and fights, those fights are rather awesome to watch, seeing Neo doing all these inhuman acrobatics you wish you could do.

Unfortunately, the film is a little too full of itself, and all the philosophical mumbo-jumbo does wear thin pretty quickly. The dialogue isn't exactly the greatest either, although there are some cool lines scattered throughout. While the non-action scenes do drag the film down (and are actually quite tedious), this is the DVD version, so of course... you can skip to the action! I love the Burley Brawl - it's incredibly intense, and stylish, and the visuals are mind-boggling. The Chateau scene, and the Freeway Chase are also pretty cool. One dissapointing thing about the DVD though is that the special features are pretty thin, and not particularly interesting for that matter - a big let down, especially since the original was such a benchmark for everything a great DVD should be. They'll no doubt try to cash-in with a 'special edition' or release a bonus disc, much like the ""Matrix Revisited""... an unfortunate trend with DVD releases these days.

1467428,4,B00005JLTN,"After reading some of the reviews here, I'm getting a clearer idea of what people are expecting from movies.  The hightlights, or at least the most talked about parts of the first movie were obviously the action scenes.  So when the second movie hits, are people really expecting two hours of fight scenes?  All of the scenes have a purpose, if you're paying attention.  I've noticed a tendancy in movie-goers to want it all layed out for them; ""We got no time for sub-plots, back-story or morals!  Kick some ass!  Special effects, man!""  And then when they pull out all the stops for scenes like the many, many smiths, people complain about not knowing why it's happening!  Look a little deeper.
Everything that Neo goes through, has happened before, except the Smith thing.  It's a new thing, and the key to stopping the endless sequence.
I found the story fascinating, especially the ending.  Sure, Neo is a superhuman in the Matrix, but what made it possible for him to stop the sentinel in the 'real' world?  How did Smith infect someone in the 'real' world?  All this suggests to me that they never left the matrix at all.  Quite a puzzle, and I'm excited for Revolutions to hit theaters.
Now, in the interests of fairness, I admit that the rave sequence was gratuitous, but that was the only thing I had a problem with.  And even that had a purpose if you look at it as a whole.

1467490,3,B00005JLTN,"When I first saw this film in the theater's I found myself neither hating nor overly thrilled about it.  Many people tend to lean either onw direction or another on the quality of this sequel, either they fully enjoyed it or they utterly despised it.  For me I think it is more of a clear sign of what can happen if an artist over extends themselves with multiple projects and loses focus through their work.
When planning out the next sequels to their first installment in there series, the Wakowski brothers wanted to try and incoporate the event into as many mediums as possible to try and accomplish a media event that was previously unheard of.  They attacked on all fronts via their website with information on the films as well as the short animes collected into The Animatrix, through short film releases of ""Flight of the Osiris"", and thorugh the video game forum with Enter the Matrix and were incharge and helped to write out much of the work for these collaborations wiht the other forums.  They tried to keep afloat of all of this while at the same time work on a film that had as its predicessor a film that with a detailed and well thought out approach to science fiction and action had gone on to entrench itself into the culture.  The main reason that the first Matrix film was so successful, however, was because of its characters and the action.  Neither were singled out over the other.  Neo, Morpheus, Trinity and the others exhibited real thoughts and emotions compared to their computer program counter parts that were trying to destroy them.  They made you feel the difference between both worlds and just what they were trying to fight and protect.  In the sequel, however, this feeling of danger and survival is lost.  Do not get me wrong, I actually enjoyed the script.  I felt that it was original and was presenting the audience with something that was clever, such as its notions of the role for the keymaker and the image of the architect that neo encounters by the end of the film.  All of these characters were new and vibrant images brought to the screen, yet the film itself did not capture the audience.  I feel that the problem for this lied in the actual tempo of the movie.  Nothing during the duration of the film seems to carry any feel of importance.  As the events occur you never actually find yourself caring for the characters as much as you did in the first film.  They seemed replaced by those for which they were fighting against in the first film.  All of the title roles seemed drained of their humanity as the events which we are supposed to feel should be dire for they could possible end the war between man and machine begin to unfold.  It almost seems as if the Wakowskis were more worried about accomplishing the biggest action sequences in film history rather than creating what could have been one of the greatest movie series in film history.  Instead we are given a average follow up to a far superior film that dealt with issues ranging from how do we know what we are really here to accomplish, knowing who we are selves really are, and the power that choice and the ability to make decisions for our actions is what makes us human and why we can not allow it to be obliterated.  Perhaps, however, with everything the Wakowski's were trying to accomplish they spread themselves to thin and that is what hurt Reloaded more than anything.  As I said before, their attention seemed to only lie more on their next big action scene rather than just what thier characters were conveying within the scene.  Of, at the same time, should we really accept such an excuse as the creators being pulled into many directions as an acceptable reason for loss of quality in work, especially with the amount of time they were being given to accomplish their tasks.  For in the end, what these movies should really be about is real world of humanity and why it is more important, or should be, than the sterilized world of the machines.  Neo and the rest should embark everything that makes us different and just what they are fighting for.  It shouldnot matter how many Agent Smith's he fights or how many cars our destroyed, it should only matter if we find ourselves caring about the characters and their fight for life.  I think this is the main problem and the fact that the Wakowski's forget when they put this film together, instead viaing for visual appeal over the mental.",1066089600,2,4426,4.577946768060836
1467491,5,B00005JLTN,"all of the negative reviews i have read focus on the most superficial aspects of the film -- acting, rave dancing, and colonel sanders. too bad none of these things actually have anything to do with the film itself.
'reloaded' is most decidedly a second installment worthy of its predecessor. much like 'the empire strikes back' and 'the two towers', it ends quite abrubtly and leaves a sort of nebulous feeling. uncertainty abounds. for anyone who panned 'reloaded' for its ending, i bet you can't look me in the eye and tell me that you won't spend $7 on seeing 'revolutions' next month. you just can't.
anyway, beyond the weird scenes and acting is what is at the very core of the trilogy -- oodles and oodles of the wachowskis hitting viewers over the head with philosophical viewpoints from human history. it speaks volumes about the filmmakers that they can create a character in neo who can be interpreted as the central figure in most of the world's more popular religions. you can see neo as jesus, or even as buddha.
beyond the obvious religious and philisophical parallels the film contains are its mathematical attributes -- some simple like the recurrence of 101 and 303 -- and some not-so-simple ones, as in the many, many references to computer programming, loops, anomalies, string theory, axioms and their definitions, and just about anything else you would need to know about how the matrix is built.
if you want to read what 'the matrix' films may really be about, i suggest ""godel, escher, bach: an eternal golden braid"" by douglas hofstadter. its kinda tough to read, but once you pick up on it, you may as well believe you are reading right out of the script, only now it makes sense.
get past the superficial elements, and see what this trilogy really is -- a work of art meant to question, and perhaps solve some of life and the universe's many 'strange loops' made by two very brilliant men.",1066089600,,1916,4.705357142857143

1467494,5,B00005JLTN,"I still feel a bit saddened that so many people have a tough time enjoying this movie for what it is. Every note, to me, was pitch perfect. (Ok, the dance/rave went a bit long, but I think I understand the intent of the scene. More on that later...)
Sure, some could say the battle/fighting sequences go on a bit - then again, many in the audience probably came only for the fighting.  The writing, story and ultimate meaning of The Matrix Reloaded deliver movie science fiction at the highest level.  Sure quibbles here and there can be found, but one must remember this is a science fiction joy ride. It also happens that the ride offers willing passengers some rather meaningful thoughts along the way.
I found the story to be plausible, it pulled me in enough to go along for the ride - with the concept and truths the storytellers were trying to share.  I find this move timelessly relevant.  And people might enjoy this more if they judged this in the context of this being the middle part of a three piece composition.  This movie makes the first Matrix all the more enjoyable and the upcoming finale highly anticipated.
There are many levels to this movie that some reviewers, I am sorry to say, seem to be missing. I believe some of the reason for the violent negatives against this sequel has to do with the deeper meaning/points of the story more directly coming to light here in Reloaded. Maybe some find those meanings offensive to their political and/or religious leanings?  For example, the Matrix message is now more clearly evident as being beyond just a ""shoot 'em up action flick"", is ""wrong"" to those people now willing to give up their liberties for ""safety"" in this post 9/11 world.  The point of the Matrix movies is that, at least in part, reality as it is normally ""presented"" is something that deserves more attention, more scrutiny and more questioning.  Digging deeper into such reality can be scary and/or uncomfortable for many.  The status quo is, after all, usually easier.
Matrix Reloaded is everything the last two STAR WARS movies are not! If only such writing and creativity behind the Matrix movies invigorated these, so far, bland and leaden Star Wars sequels.
As far as all the complaints about the ""orgy"" scene: it was a rave - people having fun and DANCING. Doing, being and behaving as humans, doing something that gives them humanity the computer programs can never ""get"" as authentically.  Morpheus was solemn about the task ahead and then essentially said revel in who you are, enjoy and have fun as you are uniquely capable...for afterward it is for these such things - our ability to be free and human -  that the battle is joined.
By the way, my impression of the only way to ""win"" this Matrix battle is to co-opt the adversary by influencing them (corrupting their program) so they alter their way of thinking - seeing the benefit of each side surviving. We get a taste of that in this movie from the Oracle and also when we meet the Merovingian ""programs"" that have developed an intense appreciation for the finer pleasures of beauty, taste - even love. This person/program (Monica Bellucia) has become a voluptuary who has learned to enjoy much of what machine-like thinking is unable to appreciate - whether an actual machine or by humans who have become like machines in their rigid and controlled lemming-like following of whatever they are spoon-fed.(It is easier that way, isn't it?)

Interestingly, Mr. Smith, as he was corrupted with greater ""awareness"" as well, chose a darker path. As long as people are kept fighting and agitating and wanting, they will find that it is harder to open their eyes to other ways of resolving disputes, of working together to help each other. So, the battle is perpetuated...which leads to the need for more machinery, rules, ""order"" - instead of those resources being used for higher ideals.
Think about television in this regard. Television is most primarily an advertising medium, the ""entertainment"" is in service to that reality.  So, the entertainment - be it news or comedy or drama - is there to get you ready (to be conditioned) for those ads.  Those ads work best if you don't feel as good about yourself.  Then the products come to the rescue...to make you smell better, look better, be happier, more wealthy, more safe etc. If you are fearful of loss of something, then brush with this, wear that, drive this, take these pills.  The ads perpetuate those feelings of inferiority and unhappiness so that the shows take your mind away for awhile...and then back to commercials. More and more as time has gone on, the money/advertising aspect has been allowed to overpower and corrupt any other purpose of the mass media. This influences all media and all people.  Kinda Matrix-like, it isn't good for us, but we have gotten to the point where we do not realize that greater reality.  Like sitting in a pot of boiling water, by the time you realize what is happening, you are cooked.
(At the very least, ""watch"" what you watch, be a bit more mindful to how too much of that ""reality"" can keep you from deeper realities of human interaction and awareness of some of the other things going on in your life and the world around you. And remember, you are being ""sold""... not only products, but also ideas, a way of life, a belief system that is not necessarily in your interests.  For example, it is becoming more and more handy for powers that be to have a populace that is afraid.  This will allow the rationale for more power given to those who can ""protect"" us.  A story told time and time again throughout history.  Follow the money.)
My tv screed is just a handy metaphor for how we can willingly allow a ""Matrix"" of reality (that is unreal) to gradually overpower us; and why I believe the story of the movies is so ingenious (the ideas aren't necessarily new, but to showcase them so creatively is) and popular.  It resonates.
Some may find the above thinking beside the point of going to see The Matrix movies. Maybe they just think the movie stinks.  That is perfectly fine.  However, it is a bit harder to fathom how those who say they enjoyed the first movie can despise the second. It is most likely they will dislike the third as well.  Maybe all they saw was a bang-bang, cool special effects and new-look ""show"" and just did not wish for much more than that. Those sorts of movies certainly seem to do well at the box office too.
But, again, The Matrix stories can offer you much more.  I enjoyed the layers of ideas and meaning of these Matrix movies just as much as the visual fireworks.  And I give the moviemakers credit for trying to present such ideas while also working to make a film as popularly appealing to as many people as possible. Not an easy task.

This person goes through all the problems with Matrix Reloaded. Fine. But the one thing I had a problem with was the fact that this reviewer was basically wondering how Zion can run on ""phenomenal"" technology but the people are dressed in rags and couldn't figure out how to make shoes. Well damn near all mankind and earth was destroyed by computers and they had to find what they could to wear. I am sure in the middle of this war, when these people didn't know if they would make it out alive, they were really thinking about some damn clothes and shoes and looking good! C'mon! Survival was the first thing on their mind. And yes they run on great technology, but there was nothing for them to possibly make f*ckin' shoes with, being that they're hundreds of miles below the earth. Did you see any sheep they could get wool from? Alls I'm sayin' is think before you write something stupid like that.

1467497,1,B00005JLTN,"If you think ""The Matrix"" has ruined action movies as we know it.  I for one am raising my hand about 500 million feet in the air.  ""Bullet Time"" has ruined every action movie because they're all trying to be ""The Matrix"" and that includes ""The Matrix: Reloaded.""  Let's take BT (Bullet Time) and slow it down even more.  Let's run about one frame per year.  Right from the start I was disgusted by the BT.  What were they thinking?
I'm getting to the dialogue folks.  The action was way way too crazy.  There is a certain line that shouldn't be crossed and they broke it right in half.  The fight with the Agent Smiths was very stupid.  I was hoping it would end about 5 minutes into it, but it didn't end for like another 10 minutes.  The scenes with ""The Oracle"" really bother me because they're just not that interesting.
The only good addition to the film is Neo's ability to fly.  That is very cool.  ""The Twins"" were very annoying to me and the whole chase scene with them was a big Cadillac commercial.  The scene in the French restaurant annoyed the hell out of me.
Then there is the famous ""Zion Party"" scene.  Oh my.  That brought out a lot of laughter.  I haven't laughed that much since ""Death to Smoochy"" and I only laughed at that because it's the worst movie ever!!!!!!  All involved should have been punished.
The party/dance scene was totally stupid and pointless.  Now I know you're going to say to yourself, ""They were just illustrating the unbreakable spirit of the people of Zion,"" but come on folks, we can do better than that.  Let's not forget Morpheus' speech before the wanking begins.  What an unforgetable speech in the history of movies.  Not since ""Independence Day"" has there been such a stupid speech in a movie.....oh oh oh, I take that back.  Not since Samuel L. Jackson's when the going get tough speech in ""Deep Blue Sea.""  That was comedic genius.  Thank you Samuel L.
Is it me, or were there only two white people in Zion?  Neo and Trinity were the only two.  How's that possible?  This is not a racist comment, it's just an observation.  Did anyone else notice that?
Anywho.  They spent too much time on action.  No time on script.  And squandered what could have been a good cinema experience.  Richard Roeper praised this as some giant leap forward in action movies, but I think he just got caught up in the hype.  This is one of the worst movies of the year.
If you want to see a great movie this year, buy ""A Mighty Wind.""  The comedy is amazing and so is the acting.  They draw out a lot of emotions from the audience (especially Eugene Levy and Catherine O'Hara).  Let's not forget that the majority of that movie is improved.
Don't buy The Matrix: Reloaded.  Don't rent it.  You'll feel bad afterwards....I did.  It's awful to the infinity billionth degree.

1467498,4,B00005JLTN,"The Matrix Reloaded is probably one of the finest jobs of using computer animation along with a movie. The car chase scene on Highway 101 is perhaps in the top three only to Bullitt and the Seven Ups. Interestingly, Agent Smith becomes a computer virus which replicates himself to kill Neo. A scene in the movie involves Neo trying to fend off about a hundred Agent Smiths. The potholes of the sequel are the following.
1. The movie is more predictable than the last.
2. Neo flying just sets a lousy vibe throughout the movie.
3. The idea of a backdoor is corney.
Besides that, this is a solid four star movie. If you enjoy sci-fi thrillers or enjoy big car chase movies, I would definitely buy the Matrix Reloaded on DVD. Buying the VHS would be a waste of the tremendous special effects throughout the movie.",1066003200,,810,4.517006802721088

1467571,2,B00005JLTN,"Hi.
This movie basically was a letdown that begun the downward spiral that was the summer of 2003. Finding Nemo, the Pixar family film won out the box office and viewer's hearts rather than the forseeen meglomaniacal drive this film was supposed to have.
As deep and as apparently lovingly made, this film lacked heart. As Entertainment Weekly recently commented, 'Becoming is more entertaining than bieng', and that's very much apparent in The Matrix Reloaded.
Main characters usually are vehicles for the audience to travel with, to discover and learn with..and eventually, grow with. Neo, the film's main character, was as approachable as a wet towelette and as enthused with his job just as much.
He was The One, and as we learn, he's the One of the Ones as well.. (there had been six 'Ones' before, and alll failed because they didn't know love...or something.)
That's why THIS One is apparently supposed to win in the next film.
I really don't have much to gripe about with this film other than the fact that it had as much heart as a Star Trek episode (the characters didn't grow..they just did what the had to do...blah!) and the nearly ten minute Kahula Iced drink ad that annoyed me and everyone else to no end.
If you get this dvd, i'm assuming they have a 'SCENE MISSING' section when this horrible Christina Aguliera video pops on.. if not, it's a waste of technology.",1066003200,,1381,4.710743801652892
1467572,4,B00005JLTN,"The original Matrix was one of the most important films in the last decade, if anything only because it was largely responsible for triggiring the boom in the DVD market. It was a new experience in digital enjoyment, and changed forever the tastes of the buying public.
Martix Reloaded is the long  awaited sequel, second in a trilogy, and which did not fare well in the box office contrary to the huge expectations. However,I did find the low review marks and the negative feedback quite harsh and unfair, because there is a very important point lost on many:
Not unlike Lord of The Rings, The Matrix should be judged when all three films are FINALLY out, as they are closely interconnected and can be seen and reviewed as one whole viewing experience. The sequel might not be as good as the first, but then it does not matter as much as the fact that it is the whole trilogy that should be assessed.
The story of Matrix might be at times confusing, and at others quite simple(Its biblical/philosophical undertones/men against machines in an apocalytpic future, is a subject that has been treated extensively in cinema, from the all time masterpiece of Kubrick's 2001 A Space Odyssey to dozens of lame straight to video imitations), but this becomes secondary to the immense pleasure one gets from the viewing experience itself, the fights, action, digital wizadry, music and production design,in the first Matrix as well as in its sequel Reloaded. One fact is clear and can not be denied, the Washowski brothers have done a wonderful job in achieving this.
I liken this experience to my love of African music: the whole vibe,groove and the beautiful voices compensate amply for  not understanding the meaning of the words and what they are singing about.
The two Matrix films should,in a way, be looked at similarily, you might not like the story,or the way it is going ,but you will sure be in for a magical digital ride that will capture all your senses. A cinematic masterpiece it may not be, but it is certainly the ultimate DVD experience.",1066003200,,2046,4.76056338028169

Nobody realizes that this is a 1/2 a movie. They shot the whole thing at the same time. If the Wachowski brothers could they would have released Revolutions maybe a week or 2 later but those special effects gotta be special. Nobody seems to take this split movie in 1/2 thing seriously. I was relieved to find that ign.com reviewed Kill Bill as only part of a big story and not just a seperate movie. I like to compare Reloaded to X2 because that movie had a lot of foreshadowing. Remember the part when Xavier and Woverine are in Cerebro in the begginng? Wolverine tells him to concentrate harder and X goes ""If I did i'd blow his head up"" which is what was going to happen at the end of the movie. If the split X2 into two chunks then that scene would be meaningless to you. There is alot alot ALOT od foreshadowing and meaning in Reloaded that should be explained in Revolutions and if its not then I will say: Matrix sucks! But i have confidence in the enigmatic Wachowski brothers that they will come through and on the fateful day of November 5 we will leave the theater going ""Whoa!""",1065916800,,1256,4.348936170212766

Yeah yeah yeah so I hear that everyone's complaining about certain scenes in the movie. Like the Zion underground party, get your sex on every few seconds scenes. But honestly, I think they were a necessity. There's a lot of symbolism in this that many critics are overlooking. This whole saga is the story of man versus the machine. Machines with such sophistication and eloquence yet incapable progression capacity really needs to counteract the sense of the human's primal nature, their will to live, their will to fight for their life and their will to die for their cause. I think the underground Zion scenes exemplify this. There's a more humanistic side to this. The first one was all about detachment from the machines, but it was still over-run with the theme of control by the them. The Matrix Reloaded is more or less the exact opposite. It's expressing the human qualities that the first one couldn't...
So even though Morpheus' speech needed work..I'm still glad they didn't cut the Zion segment.

1467578,4,B00005JLTN,"Allow me to be somewhat of a voice of reason here.  The Matrix Reloaded was not the new age drek loaded, garritous, messiah wannabe that most people try to make it out to be.  Nor is it the best film ever to be released.  It is instead a innovative, daring, well thought out, and somewhat to contrived for its own good piece of filmmaking that entertains more then most holloywood inspired tripe.
First of all, the films greatest weakness is that alot of its story is so intricate, that it couldn't fit into a film.  Instead the Witchowski brothers wrote some of its backstory into ""Final Flight of the Osirus""; a animated short from animatrix, and the rest of its backstory can be found in the video game; ""Enter the matrix"" which explaines what happens to some of the more underexplored characters and thier origins.  As much as I appreciate new methods of storytelling, it would have been a bit more considerate for the mainstream crowd just to put in what would equivilate to the matrix equvelant of crib notes, to those that don't want to get to involved in the mythology.
Also, this film is defintately daring in the sense that it attempts some different imagery and story telling factors that are rare to hollywood.  It was interesting to see Zion, and its myraid levels of population and how they relate, But the ""Prayer"" and subsequent Rave that followed was no doubt meant to make us respect the peoples heart and willingness to celebrate in the face of doom, instead... it came off as campy and somewhat garritous.
My final complaint is that as a Art/history major, I am familiar with Shakesphere, Locke, Hobbs, Dostiovski, Nietche, and other Rennaisance writers.  So I was able to pick up the references, and characters that are obviously meant to represent the ideals and flaws behind the Philosophies of These writers.  However, for a average movie goer, I feel somewhat sorry for, since they will have a tougher time appreciating the thoughts and ideas the directors are attempting to get across.  The Witchowski Brothers seem to have a fascination with the Rennaisance Period in history, which is supported by the fact that the story in Animatrix that Details how the machines were created, persecuted, and eventually defeated humanity is entitled, ""The Second Rennaisance.""
Now that Ive Pointed out the movies flaws, allow me to rant a little on what is good about ""Matrix Reloaded""  The story, while yes contrived and a bit convoluted, is very original.  Those that attempt to discern where the plot will unravel will likely be very surprised.  Its very amusing to see how much thought the Witchowski's have put into the saga of the matrix.  Neo is now neigh invincible in combat, but is still fallable by human weaknesses.  Meanwhile its good to see that Supporting characters such as Morpheus and trinity are still capable of fending for themselves whenever Neo is not around.  Each of the returning good guys shall grow and develop in surpring and plasing ways.
But it is the Villans in this film that steal the show. Magnovinion, while annoying, is rather intriguing as a villan.  Persephone is as mysterious as she is seductive.  The archetect is cold and ruthless, a master manipulator.  Last but certainly never least, is probably one of the coolest villans in cinema history; Agent Smith.  Smith has returned and is now deadlier then ever.  More of a virus then a program now, he is clever with the insults, and definately worthy of further screen time.
The Matrix relaoded is not the kind of film that comes out every day.  Its story is steeped more in humanities history then it is in the future, but at the same time, is also steeped heavily in myth and fantasy.  The action scenes this time around are original, and garritous, but amusing.  Your jaw will drop during the Burly Brawl, and the highway chase is a scene that has now set the standard for car chases and fight scenes atop moving vehicles.  Though the film is flawed in some respects, the flaws come with the Witchowski brothers sometimes trying to be a bit too over the top, and attempting different tricks that just don't work.  But nonetheless, it is indeed a worthy addition to your DVD collection, the Xtras promise to pump up the value of this already great film.  Next month, Revolutions shall debut, and end off the saga of the matrix.  So the Timing is perfect for the release of this DVD.",1065830400,11,4389,4.74078947368421

Sometimes that requires an extremely short attention span, and other times these pioneers are challenging your patience & viewpoint.

Today's movies have sub-plots being planted early on, only to slap you in the face once you've forgotten about them, not to mention the fact that movie audiences now require something that is complex yet simple enough not to short-circuit thier brains. That's a fine line. It's like trying to explain a car's powertrain to a child...You don't start out telling them about the whole combustion process, the gear ratios & the transmission...you just tell the kid to step on the pedal and the car goes...And, as they get older..you start to get more & more detailed. Isn't that what's happennig in these pre-concieved trilogy movies?
Hmmm, yeah... So cool it, kick back, and let the whole story unfold. Besides, the directors have sprinkled Reloaded with just enough eye-candy & surprizes to reel us back in for Revolutions,(whether we want to be there or not.)
 I love that!
Anyhow, as far as a dvd goes... I am super excited about the Reloaded extras. Most of all though, I am eagerly awaiting repeated viewings of this movie. I will admit that The Matrix ""world"" might take itself a little bit too seriously. In fact, one of the most ""serious"" scenes takes place between Neo & the architect, and I have read over & over again how people despise this part of the movie. (It's my favorite!) All it proves is that many of the moviegoers were expecting more answers, not more questions. Still, I wonder just how important all the new techno-babble & philosophy raised in Reloaded really are. Maybe this is a diversion to a much simpler plot. Then again, maybe the Wachowskis just had too much money and time to indulge their bloated vision. Only the individual viewer can decide, and I already have...

1467678,5,B00005JLTN,"First off, I would like to point out that the 1st Matrix involed all philosophy.  However, the 2nd Matrix involves all action scenes and very little philosophy.  In other words, the people who rate The Matrix: Reloaded high love action movies, but the people who rate it poorly love a good philosophical movie.  So what kind of a movie do you like?  If you love a great action movie-than this is your movie, but if you don't, well, you will probably not like this movie since it contains only a couple of philosophical ideas.  Another thing, The Matrix: Revolutions should have a variety of both which would make it the best overall of the series, but to understand Revolutions you must first understand Reloaded!",1065744000,2,713,4.717741935483871

It wasn't even worth watching. This movie was overrated. Same with the videogame ""Enter the Matrix"". Enter the Matrix exits the Matrix and Reloaded is unloaded. Both were horrible. I'm anxiously awaiting the third one hoping it will make this one better, but I kind of doubt it. I think it was the abrupt ending that ruined it most. If you haven't seen this movie wait until November around the time the third movie comes out to watch this one. THen it might not seem so bad, but I'm not sure.",1065744000,,645,4.168

And to those of you asking when did neo start doing the superman thing, watch the end of the first one again (then proceed to smack yourself in the forehead and utter DUH!).",1065744000,7,457,4.290697674418604

They did a great job extending the story line into part two from the orginal and it will probably be even better in the last movie.

1467682,4,B00005JLTN,"I am docking one star for this, I'm suprised myself, but for two good reasons. Overall the movie was good, the philosophy blew my mind when I saw it, can't wait to get the DVD to understand abit more of it. As for the plot and such,well here are my two cents about that...
First of all the movie overall has a different feel to me, I walked out of it feeling utterly strange, it's long for one, but there have been a few things that changed. It doesn't feel quite like the same to me, but no sequel DOES feel the same does it? It's based four years or so after The Matrix, After Neo joined with Morpheus and Trinity, and now the real fight is starting to heat up with the machines. We learn much more about Zion and about the Matrix world as a whole, it isn't just focused on Neo or The One anymore, now it's showing a slightly bigger challenge, a bigger picture of the way things are outside of the matrix and in.
Second of all, as for plot and scenes go, ONE scene made me say ""Oh my goodness..."" My friends and I were wanting it to end but instead it went on for ten minutes or so, I was just sitting there in shock. I never thought I'd see a scene such as the 'rave' scene as I call it, with Neo and Trinity getting down right there in The Matrix, I expected if anything happened it would be a bit more tasteful than this. There have been other movies with far shorter scenes than that. This is the main reason I've docked a star. To me, this hasn't any place in the Matrix, if you ask me it was just a cheap shot scene to get people to watch the movie abit more. If this scene had been more tasteful, much shorter and less... strange... I would have given this a full rating.
Overall this was a great movie, in terms of plot and scene it could have had a bit better, I hope the third does not disappoint me any more than these slight problems did. Movies do NOT need something dealing with sexual acts EVERY time it's a rated R movie people! This has just proven my theory that most R rated films today do have SOME sexual interaction in them, but this was too much for this genre of film and the subject of the film.
If you are a fan of The Matrix saga it's great, if you aren't that big of a fan perhaps rent it first.
All for now...",1065744000,,2240,4.047297297297297
1467683,5,B00005JLTN,"Well, it is difficult to keep the mistery in the second one when you try to set the stage on the first one. The directors said that. The second one will be all about action and might be disappointed for some of the audience.
The problem people ahs some time is not to wait until seeing the third one. A trilogy is good or bad on its whole. If you just think that the Matrix reloaded is one movie, you have to realize that this cannot be. The directors at first wanted to release one movie out of three but the producers said that a 8-hour movie is not acceptable.
The ""chemistry"" thing is also an easy critics, I think. The matrix is not about emotions, it is about reading abook that is open for you. Who cares about the love story between Reeves and Moss. The point is that they are in love and that is important for the movie but seeing them having sex is really not my cup of tea, I would rather watch other movies for that.
As French, I apreciate how the audience react when the guy swore in French.... This is pretty funny.
I overall enjoyed the movie and enjoy all movies that are a little bit whaco anyway.

1467684,5,B00005JLTN,"The first Matrix was excellent because it was most people's first introduction to wire fighting, it was the first movie to use ""bullet time"" (a term coined by the Matrix's special effects guru) and it has a huge plot twist in the middle of the movie.
None of these things are novel anymore. Since the first Matrix, a thousand movies have used wire fighting and bullet time. I think it's not the content of the movie but the lack of another paradigm shift that has people disappointed in this movie.",1065744000,,498,4.544444444444444

It might have left the audience wanting more or asking questions but that's what it was supposed to do. The actions scenes were absolutely fantastic although the fight scene with Agent Smith did continue for just a tad too long. However with that said I came away awe-struck. The chase scene had my heart pounding every step of the way. I love action movies and this far surpassed my expectations unlike Tomb Raider 2 which was a waste of an afternoon.

1467747,5,B00005JLTN,"First off, let's get this out of the way: The Matrix Reloaded is only half of one HUGE movie. Keep that in mind when you watch it, because it doesn't end...it just stops. As for people saying that the story is pure gibberish, you might want to watch this movie a few more times...it is truly an incredible script (of the first half of a movie). It makes many many multiple connections with itself and the first movie, that ultimately weave an intricate web of storytelling. As for the effects, go back and watch ""The Matrix"" and then try to tell me that it's effects are better than Reloaded's....",1065657600,,597,4.486238532110092

This movie is the sequel to the matrix, in the matirx most people got distracted by the action and forgot the VERY philosophical plot. Most people went to go see this movie for the action, it is not a action movie; its a creative ""thinker"" movie with some cool action effects. The just of the movie is trying to explain ""the world isn't real"" theory from the first movie. Alot of people didn't like this, because they are action simpletons, who don't give a crap about philosophy which is most likely why alot of people thought this movie was bad. People just couldn't take that one part that lasted less than 5 minutes, you know the one part in the white room, where your supposed to listen and try and figure out what that one guy is trying to say. Then there are those people out there that said, ""he's just like superman flying around"" hmm where did you get that idea, heres a clu; ""THEY SAID THAT IN THE MOVIE!"" duh. And to you people saying the special effects aren't that ground breaking, let me see you do 1 million agent smiths at once, with the exact same face on.
Don't see this movie unless, you have a slightly philosophical side. If you don't even think about the world around you at least once in your daily life, then you'll probably not understand this movie.",1065657600,3,1434,4.33457249070632
1467749,2,B00005JLTN,"I believe with all my film-lover's heart that ""The Matrix"" is one of the finest sci-fi films ever made, if not arguably one of the greatest MOVIES ever made. Now, let's talk about ""The Matrix: Reloaded"", which is, in short, an ENORMOUS disappointment in the context of the potential of the series. ""Reloaded"" has one huge problem with it - it takes itself WAY too seriously. The first film wasn't afraid to happily wallow in its hokey dialogue and cheesy plot, but this one simply loses the charm of the first film and actually tries to be something more than it is. Yes, the fight scenes are great (though some commit the sin of overkill - a nearly 15-minute car chase just loses something after 10 minutes), the effects are great, and it stays visually true to the first film, but the movie gets lost in its own philosophy, not to mention indulgence. The huge ""orgy"" scene has few rivals when it comes to ""Most Pointless Scene Of All Time."" Sure, the Wachowski's were trying to show that the people were becoming part of a community, but those points could have been made in a more subtle, relevant manner. I do admire at points the times when they do try to add emotional depth to the film, with Morpheus's relationship and the growing bond between Neo and Trinity, but it just doesn't work in the context of the film. Whatever happened to being a good old-fashioned sci-fi movie? I love a comment from a critic at Entertainment Weekly that said, paraphrased, if Neo ordered food from McDonald's, he would (in this film) most likely launch into a deep spiritual battle over whether he was destined to super-size that or not. It totally captures the overdone nature of the film. All in all, the movie just doesn't know when to stop. Sure, they need to keep the plot going, but if it means putting out subpar offerings like ""Reloaded,"" maybe they should have just left ""The Matrix"" as a movie and not a whole trilogy.",1065657600,2,1918,4.578488372093023

The story, plot, drama, and tension have been so far removed, as to give a three hour demonstration of martial arts to put bruce lee movies to shame. The story that is there is so far from being the human tale that is the first matrix, as to put it too abstract to care what happened to the characters, by the end i was cheering the machines. and come on, raves underground, you couldn't find anything more popular, why not just get Britney Spears to fight in the third movie.",1065657600,5,678,4.388888888888889

The acting and dialogue suffered from this and it was obvious. The Matrix really made you think. Matrix Reloaded doesn't. The characters (with the exception of the pilot and his wife) seem like robots that don't really show any emotion. They are really very different from the way they were in part one. The writers have made Neo so invincible and God-like that you never really worry about him at all. This movie would have been worse if it did not have such a great ending.

It was different.  It would be interesting to know whether the producers of this movie planned all three movies when they released the Matrix or if they planned the 2nd and 3rd installments after the great success of the first.
Eitherway, this is a great movie.  The plot, action, background music, and special effects combine to produce a great visual display.  The only problem I had was in a few of the scenes the special effects (I thought) looked move like a video game rather than actual live action.
In regards to the plot, you either get it or you don't.  If you do, there are several different levels on which the plot exists; from the obivious to the sublime.  I am not about to compare the Matrix to some eastern mythology or some poet, but I am sure some correlation could be made.  However, if you take the time to notice the little things in both this and the first movie, you can start to understand. I have watched both movies several times and still come away with something new.

1467756,3,B00005JLTN,"Power in the Hollywood system comes from box office numbers. The more money your work earns for the studio owners, the more creative control you're allowed. Not everyone uses their newfound power wisely, however. ""The Matrix Reloaded"" demonstrates this.
Some directors know how to leverage creative freedom. Ridley Scott, for example, is a director who always maintains careful control on his creative work from start to finish (though, thankfully, not to the degree of a Kubrick). As a result, the content of his films is always perfectly paced. You may not like the content, but that won't be because it's expressed badly.
Unfortunately it looks like the Wachowski brothers are an example of the other type of director, for whom newly-gained power becomes a club with which to beat down any attempt to restrain the story they want to tell.
The story of the Matrix is epic; like the Machine, it wants to transcend all limits to its growth. In making ""The Matrix"" this impulse was restrained, both financially and artistically, and the cinematic result was a perfect blend of story and presentation. In ""The Matrix Reloaded"" these constraints were lifted. Without that discipline, the audiovisual side began growing like celluloid kudzu, and wound up choking off the story.
To put it simply, every scene in this movie is about 20 percent too long. From Neo's mid-movie fight with Smith 2.0, to the conversation with the Oracle, to the top-of-the-truck fight, to the Neo/Trinity love scene, to the staircase fight, to the Big Dance Number -- all of these scenes, and many others, were just too long. All these scenes should have been edited down to the exact amount necessary to tell the story, but they weren't. Halfway through them, we got the point, but the directors wouldn't let us move on. They lingered... and we got bored.
The result was a reasonably good movie that was less fun to watch than it should have been because it dragged. I can't help but assume that, now that the directors have the power to push exactly the vision they want, they're unwilling to accept any limits to translating what they see in their imaginations onto the big screen. Thus, scenes that any good film editor would have left on the cutting-room floor -- not because they were ""bad,"" but because they didn't add anything useful to the scene -- were retained because the directors couldn't bear to cut them and no one from the studio said ""no.""
This problem of ""falling in love with your work"" (and thus becoming unwilling to revise or cut scenes that don't help tell the story) has always been a struggle for writers. In ""The Matrix Reloaded"" the Wachowski brothers appear to have fought that same battle and lost.

1467833,4,B00005JLTN,"The matrix reloaded, considered by many was no comparison to its first, The Matrix. Honestly i do not see why people rip this movie as bad as they do. The further story of zion and the matrix is much more complex, as it should be. The first Matrix was a good, slim, to the point, movie and it could be. Reloaded requires much more explaining and therefore there is much more fillers and and a larger scale plot. This is the reason why i only gave 4-stars, because of plot execution. There are some scenes that should not have have been in the movie and only add minutes, but nothing neccessary to the story. As an example, the rave scene was useless, and could have dropped a good 10 minutes from the movie. Also the plot conflicts somewhat with that if the first matrix. At the end of The Matrix, Neo is held at the status of a God, but in Reloaded he has weaknesses. I suppose this is because of the complexity of the plot. As for the action...no other movie hails in comparison to Reloaded, Its action and graphics were state of the art and very powerful. No where else have i have a more realistic flying scene than this movie. Personally the flying scenes alone made the movie for me. There is also still the good one-on-one fights with humans, agents, machines, etc. and the classic ""bullet-time,"" motion. Altogether the movie is lengthy, but its fun and it works. It retains complexity of its matrix centerpiece but still has action that anyone can have a good time watching...Cant wait until Revolutions",1065398400,,1511,4.518248175182482
1467834,5,B00005JLTN,"I thought 'The Matrix Reloaded' was a fantsastic film.
The plot, though initially confusing and seemingly uneventful, is amazing in it's own right. As with most trilogies, it slows down a bit, to develop character. The enire 'rave' scene in the beginning was designed to show us how the inhabitants of Zion long for more simpler times, free of the complexity of the war. I have seen some complaints about the costumes on the 'ravers'. Why the dirty clothing, no shoes, the down-right-prehistoic gear? Once again, it is a rebellion against the complexity of the war; what is it to be truly human, not just a product of machines and the electronic reality they live in.
The fight sequences are far from boring; play this next to any other action film (save LOTR, of course) and these blow the other movies away. Incredibly rich, very rewarding. You can see how much effort they placed into these scenes. Kudos to the choreographer(s). Great job.
If I do have one complaint, it's the sequencing of the movie. Too much drama and story early on; way too much action later. But upon further examinaton- how else could they do it? They had to show Zion first; the love sequences; the humanity behind the Matrix. All of this leads up to the mind-boggling scene with the Architect.
That was one breath-taking scene.
That one scene changed the entire story of the Matrix- everything we thought was real turned out to be fiction in the original 1999 Matrix. Now, everything we thought was free turns out to be slavery once again.
Fantastic. These films will go down in history; not just for the technical aspects, but the sheer philosophical complexity.

1467837,5,B00005JLTN,"To start, I come from a background in philosophy (currently an undergrad) which certainly does bias my view of _The Matrix_ series.  With that said, _The Matrix Reloaded_ was a true masterpiece of philosophical intrigue, not to mention an intricate plot and dialogue.  It is understandable that many do not see this; the majority of the most enjoyable aspects of the movie are hidden in a single sentence, a complete scene, or interlaced throughout the entire movie.  In line with the above, _The Matrix Reloaded_ is not for those who dislike a lack of finality in a movie: by the end it raises more questions (on many different levels) than it answers (apparently in line with the designs of the Wachowski brothers).  For these reasons, claims about a lack of plot is understandable; without seeing the finer aspects (or having interest in the topics) _The Matrix Reloaded_ is more like a shoot-em-up action thriller with expensive pyrotechnics than a psychological and philosophical work.  Thankfully, the world needs both types; if everyone were interested in philosophy the world would be worse for it, in my personal opinion (though I think most, if not all, could definitely use some instruction in general logic and fallacies).
Along with the above, I also felt that the sex-scene between Neo and Trinity (though quite tame according to today's common movie standards) was not needed.  Some I have talked to say that it (along with the dancing in Zion) demonstrated the 'culture' in a post-apocalyptic world, but I don't see it (it is probably also related to my own personal aversion to 'hard' music, like what was played during the scene).  Carrie-Anne Moss is beautiful, granted, but I personally would prefer to view her with a little more covering.
For those who have not seen _The Matrix Reloaded_, here is a list of the philosophical topics it deals (or continues to deal) with: the nature of reality, the limits of AI, indeterminacy in human action, determinism (interestingly enough, as articulated by a computer program), multiple realities, self-defeating programs (see the most recent trailers for more on this), identity, and multiple worlds (i.e. modal semantics).  Some of the above are subtle in the movie itself, but you can find them (and probably more) if you look.  On a related note, if you haven't seen the philosophy section at The Matrix website, do so (I particularly liked the Dreyfus and Dreyfus paper).
In short, I would suggest _The Matrix Reloaded_ for those who don't particularly like to go to movies to stop thinking (or for those who like to do such, but also like the occasional movie that makes you think).  If you focus more on the plot and dialogue (something that most other movies are lacking), you will probably enjoy it more (though the computer graphics are very well-done).  For those who are 'techies' or 'computer guys,' you will probably like it as well.  For the others, more power to you; just avoid the movie (and probably any discussions related to it).",1065398400,5,3011,4.9405940594059405
1467838,1,B00005JLTN,"This film is really really boring and only has one thing good about it! That being the 14 min car chase, and that's it! Bad...",1065398400,,126,4.08
1467839,3,B00005JLTN,"Most of the reviews I read seemed born of frustration with an admittedly not-perfect sequel to the Matrix. The product isn't out yet, but I had to think hard about why I would pre-order or wouldn't pre-order a movie I both enjoyed and found dissatisfying. Some reviews here paralleled my ambiguity; others seemed to be tantrums of disappointment.
So here is why I think I will wait to buy Reloaded.
The first movie was a lot of fun. The first half was rather slow and built a foundation for the latter half, keeping you interested just with the hints of weirdness and suspense about 'the truth.' The second half carried the subject of the background and completed the mythical creation of a hero.
Cool. The Matrix, as far as I'm concerned, is a satisfying stand-alone experience.
As I understand it from following fan-sites, etc., is that there is only one sequel movie, split into two parts, Reloaded and Revolutions.
Reloaded, like the first half of the Matrix, provides backstory. Action exists to keep that portion of the audience is not interested in complex, intricate plots but rather were hooked on the Matrix by the over the top action of the first movie.
So from Reloaded I got some satisfying, though some unsatisfying, background. Not of the hero-to-be, Neo, but the war into which he as thrown as flag-bearer and champion. After all, the Iliad doesn't start at the walls of Troy; Reloaded starts far enough before the machines reach the walls of Zion to explain background but still remaining fairly close to the climactic battle.
For example: is the Matrix a virtual reality within true reality? or is it a virtual reality within another virtual reality? Will I see Revolutions and realize that the apparent cliffhanger in Reloaded was no cliffhanger at all, but instead that all the 'secrets' of part 3 were already hinted at in Reloaded?
Sure, Morpheus' speech isn't as good as the St. Crispin's day speech, or Bluto's Germans Bombing Pearl Harbor rally speech. The 100 Agent Smith fight was too much, maybe, and nothing new, but then the freeway chase was a thrill. Trinity doesn't turn all guys on, but hey, we got Monica Belluci and others but the girls only get Keanu and Fishburne (guys got the better deal, in my opinion).
Lots of people in these reviews rant about the shoes, but hey, try to make yourself a pair of shoes from stuff you have around the house that won't wear out or fall apart quickly. The glimpses we get of Zion would suggest that Zion doesn't have big leathery cows or alligators to kill for shoes or rubber plantations for the soles, and probably they have the same machines and probably hydroponics factories to spread the same resources thinner over a growing population.
Anyway, when I noticed small details like an absence of shoes, my mind filled in details; watching the movie was more interactive than most 'action flicks.' Friends of mine who enjoy a more passive movie experience on the whole disliked the Matrix.
Ok, so I overall enjoyed Reloaded. Then why not buy it?
Because it's the first half of part two. If Revolutions proves Reloaded to be a big head-fake, or deflates my expectations set after watching Reloaded, then I won't buy it. I'd rather be content with the first Matrix as a self-contained hero creation story, and forget a forgettable 'hero goes to war' sequel in two parts.
I hope after Revolutions I'll be avidly going back over Matrix and Reloaded to look for clues that foreshadowed the revelations in Revolutions, but I will wait until November to decide.",1065398400,,3530,4.779050736497545
1467840,5,B00005JLTN,"OK, all of you out there who say Reloaded was horrible are definately wrong.  This movie had so many amazing special effects, and twists and turns it made the movie that much better.  Scenes such as the freeway chase were unbelievable.  Sure there were some parts in it that were a little corny, like how the Merovingian's wife wanted a kiss from Neo in exchange for taking them to the keymaker. But oh well.
The only thing that I did not like in Reloaded was the whole Trinity/Neo part (you know what I mean).  If it weren't for that it would have probably have been better than the first.
For all of you out there who say that the movie was missing something (other than an end) you are right.  I thought the same thing after I saw it. The way to answer a lot of the questions is to watch the Animatrix, but especially play Enter the Matrix. Enter the Matrix answers a ton of questions about Reloaded, and it gives you additional information as to what is going on in 'the real world'. Oh, and at the end there is a preview for Revolutions that is probably 2-3 minutes long. Just play the game.
Reloaded was awsome, I don't care what anyone says. I hope Revolutions will be even better.

1467841,5,B00005JLTN,"Lets get one thing straight. Matrix Reloaded was a movie meant for the fans!! So if you did not like the first part and consider it just as an ""ordinary"" movie, don't watch the sequal cause you'll probably dislike it. Just stick to the LOTR (kids/disney) movies and you will be fine. If you are a fan of the first matrix (UNQUESTIONABLY THE GREATEST ACTION/SCI-FI MOVIE EVER!) you'r gonna LOVE THIS :D  This movie takes the Matrix to a whole new level. Not only does it have new villians and new story plots but once again we see effects that no other movie will ever come close to creating.. not for the next 10-20 years (or until Matrix 1999 special edition:digitally re-mastered sometime in 2020 )
I too am getting real sick of these anti-matrix groups that go on and on about how bad the movie was. The thing is, your ""Lesser"" mind either does not (or refuses to) understand whole concept of the Matrix. I only have one thing to say to you people: FREE-YOUR-MINDS! oh, and the women in this movie are so Gorgeouse it hurts ;o)  5 stars! How do you like that?",1065312000,3,1062,4.413265306122449
1467872,5,B00005JLTN,"So a lot of people were very disappointed with this movie. First of all, those people expected way too much ... you cannot re-create the same aura that the funky moves had in the first movie, especially since every action movie since 1999 has copied those same slow-motion moves. Secondly, a lot of people didn't understand the plot of the movie. They didn't understand the significance of showing all the love scenes between Keanu Reeves and Carrie-Anne Moss ... it is because of this love that Neo makes the decision he does towards the end of the movie, instead of following the path his predecessors choose. Also, the plot has several twists and turns, none more so profound than the one where the Matrix reveals that it created Zion on purpose to round up the rebels, and how the cycle of ""The Ones"" has occurred 5 times in the past. With such a plot, how can anyone be disappointed with this movie?
I would definitely recommend this movie. Don't expect to be awed by the action scenes as you were in the first movie, but enjoy it it it's own right. And if you don't understand what is going on, ask someone else to explain the story to you. I know I had to do it for a couple of my friends.",1065312000,7,1196,4.391891891891892
1467873,5,B00005JLTN,"I still can't figure out why people have labelled this flick as AWFUL.It's far from it,far from boring. It's a real improvement over the first one. Great battles,action scenes,effects,music,photography to name a few. I've watched the first installment(which is a must) 6 or 7 times - I do have the DVD loaded with extras - still some effects are aging,for instance,in the beginning Trinity is being hunted by the agents and leaps from the top of a building - at some point you can make out it's fake. Anyway it's a great movie- a classic in all aspects. This second part never shows you anything like that. Every effect is carefully produced. People complain about the Zion part,the ""rave"" ,the ""Sodom & Gomorrah"" scenes - but they forget the K Bros were trying to show us what it is like to live in a hellish place - living under threat with very few reasons to feel it's great to be alive. I didn't enjoy these passages,but I didn't frown on them. As to the ""confusing inconsistent"" plot,people forget this is SCI-FI = FANTASY - thus things can be interpreted differently - it's like reading a book - the last part will certainly put everything together. As for not revolutionalizing anything,showing nothing new seems to be an understatement because,like T3 it displays an array of wonderful effects,flawless choreography,great design and wardrobe. It may not be perfect but gets close. It is good as part one - if not better.

I'm a Matrix fan, and I'm still enthralled by the idea this movie tries to portray.  So with that said, I thought it was good for what it was, the middle of a trilogy.  The only thing I hope to see in the next one, which I may not, is more humanity in the characters, they were extremely wooden, and overly stoic(?)in this film.  I wanted to see more animation in their expressions.  The best characters were the French guy and Persimone, because they had simply - character.

While the movie itself failed to live up to expectations in some places (the tribal dance scene and Keanu's ""I just love you too damn much,"" are good examples), the complex mix of cultures and mythology comes off pretty well.
I don't think that it is as obvious to most movie watchers, though.  Most of the people I went with left confused and/or disappointed.  Only in talking about the movie in context to the greater body of art out there did they begin to find it enjoyable.  It's definitely a different kind of movie.",1065052800,,651,4.626086956521739
1467877,3,B00005JLTN,"MATRIX RELOADED, what can you say.
It is definately a good ""sequel"". The story begins in the MATRIX with introductions, themes and motifs. The story of the series continues in the MATRIX RELOADED and the dilemma or climax is introduced. The charactors develop and you learn about the final conflict.
Over-all I enjoyed the movie.
I have no complaints about the plot, it develops nicely into the next movie and the final conflict. It thankfully ends where the story seems to pause before the final climax and does not have one of those cliff-hanger ends.
The charactors for the most part were well developed and excellent. Although Neo and Trinity (and sometimes Morpheus) seem very superficial and distant. Almost like idealized caracatures. There is not intimacy or personal developement in their relationship to the audience. The supporting charactor were much more developed, even for the short time that they were on screen. (i.e. the Oracle, Seraph, Link)
Unfortunately, I didn't really like the extremely long scenes that seemed to last hours and hours. For example, the scene were Neo fights  the hundreds of ""Agent"" Smith-s was way too long. Not to mention Neo was CGI-ed for the most part. I mean it's nice to have these visual and imaginative fight scene, but a director should never get so carried away that he looses his audience. That is key NEVER LOOSE YOUR AUDIENCE. The Zion dance scene could also use some editting.
At anyrate, it makes for a good restroom or popcorn break(s).
The script was ok, no different from the first movie. (A little cheesy but I've experienced worse.)
An Overall 3. An enjoyable movie, that is ALMOST destroyed by its short comings.

Sure this movie isn't as magical or amazing to most of you and thats because its the second movie and the graphics that amazed you from the first has been done.  The graphics have been improved some and the third i believe will blow you away.  the real problem  though is that most of you only liked the first because of the graphics and you never pay attention to the plot or you don't understand it.  You put down the middle movie of the trilogy because the plot is to complex for you and tells to much.

This is a true action film is the kind f action film you won't forget anytime soon a look at the box office if you don't believe me look around it was the second blockbuster of the year
umm is like star wars we all knew what was going to happen but we saw it anyways because its been a cult phenomenon.
well perhaps we know what should happen in reloaded but lets face it Reloaded is the action film of the year and here is why:
Great script [although a couple""I don't know"" lines annoyed me] but is just because they don't wanna give anything away for the next movie like neo can now destroy machines in the real world.
Like 10000 special effects.
The best fight Neo and the Agents
Really cool new characters like the twins
you find new stuff you missed. Every time it gets better, you'll see it again and again
Okay First i have to say that the matrix is a great trilogy that defines the end of the 90's and the beginning of this new century. Just like terminator and the cheesy horror films defined the 80's.
What makes this series so unbelievable great is the message the philosophical matter, is like reading Virgil or homer, it challenges you imagination in finding out what is it really, what is the meaning the message behind the story and why so many people relate?.
Like the people who wrote bad reviews don't know but is just like buffy somewhat teen therapy same with matrix it has meaning behind somewhat spiritual if you don't believe me ask those guys who banned the movie for religious themes.
 This a very smart movie, the vocabulary is just eloquent and elegant. This like the first  matrix something you haven't seen before, it can't get any better than that people!.
 Like when neo meets the architect of the matrix, great piece of modern literature that was the ticket to coolsville for me lol:P,
The first matrix is the self discovery of the hero, matrix reloaded is about to trying to find the purpose behind being the one with loads of actions and tons of catch phrases. Perhaps this one lack a bit of mystery but it comes full force, and set the tone for revolutions.
And just seeing MR smith and his awesome lines, just the greatest villain ever!
The special effects are breath taking and really just get bet better after every scene, after the first scene when neo fights the upgraded agents you know is going to be a great movie.

The Matrix Reloaded was a huge hit that I looked forward to intensely. I had thoroughly enjoyed the first installment and thought that the second would take the story to new dimensions. In some ways, the sequel far outdid the original. In terms of sheer adrenaline and eye-popping action, for instance. The patented bullet-time special effects return, but there's plenty of new eye-candy. The movie also offers even more insight into the Neo mythos. Nevertheless, the movie fails colossally in other areas. One need only mention the Neo-Trinity Romantic Chemistry (I am being ironic, of course: there was no chemistry) and the general self-importance of this more dark and stark film. In any case, what results is a mixed-bag that twists and turns unevenly to its enigmatic (and improbable) denouement.
'Reloaded' was a sequel that was destined to be made, and there are many parts of it that sparkle. The car chase scene, which pits Morpheus, Trinity and Co. against a duo of dreadlocked cyber-twins as well as a plethora of agents simultaneously on the 101 highway is one of the most jaw-dropping pieces of film that I have ever had the pleasure to see. It could quite possibly take the mantle as the most intense car chase scene ever. Bullitt, French Connection, I'm sorry, but your days on the throne are over. The sequence goes on for over 15 minutes, but it doesn't drag at all (unlike other parts). In fact, I would have liked plenty more. Another highlight is Anthony Zerbe's small role as a civil administrator in Zion. He added a nice bit of introspection into a movie that sometimes lacked it. The film had a number of fascinating secondary characters, including the keymaker, the mirolyngion (I have no idea how to spell it), the Architect (""God"") and others. Speaking of the architect, his scene was the movie's most intriguing. He spoke so fast in some sort of mathspeak but he had a magnetic presence on the screen and his character remained a delightful mystery. Hugo Weaving was once again wonderful as renegade Agent Smith (although the much advertised fight scene with Neo against an army of Smiths was too long).
That seemed to be the central problem with this film. The Wachowskis, who had created a perfectly-paced action film in The Matrix, seemed to lose focus in some of the fight scenes. Most of them, while plenty mesmerizing, go on for far too long. The pacing of the film itself is uneven, the movie starts, then stops for exposition, then starts up again. The Zion sequence is much too long (seeing a pattern?) and the 'rave' scenes are repetivive and gratuitous. Trinity and Neo are not at all convincing as a couple, perhaps less convincing than that venerable couple from Star Wars, episode 2: Darth Vader and the Queen; even less convincing than Hemingway's duo in A Farewell to Arms. At least in the other two they said that they loved each other, however unconvincingly. I never for a second believed that Neo, with all his responsibility for his race, would give it all up for the girl, and this greatly hurt the film in my mind. Speaking of Neo, Keanu Reeves loses the tolerability, okay, likeability that he had in the first installment. He is cold as ice all the way through, no emotion or passion evident. And even more annoying was his continued flying. He became a deus ex machina whenever anyone was in peril, spending more time in midair than spouting meaningful dialogue. Too bad. All the way up to the supposedly cliffhanger ending he just seemed like he had lost touch with the character.
In short, this is a film that took some risks, some of which worked out and some of which didn't. The movie was entertaining, of course, and philosophically interesting (albeit less so than its predecessor), yet its characters don't quite come alive the same way. The producers just didn't know when to say when throughout the film, and as a result the movie seems somewhat bloated.

I loved this movie, and i honestly don't see why so many people didn't like it, because of particular scenes, (Zion, Fight Scenes) which i just guess i felt were powerful or meaningful in certain metaphorical depths, whereas some people felt empty for some reason. I think that the fight scenes were incredible, and the fact that they were long, made me like them more than the few in the first movie, since those weren't as long, but still good. I only tell those who see it to be prepared for the cliffhanger ending of this film to The Matrix Revolutions, which is coming out in November.
If you want to enjoy this movie, view it as its own movie, continuing from the same story-line, not the same storyline itself. I think too many people expect the same things over and over again, yet when they get THAT, are they really happy?
if you are too much of a critic about certain things, this may not be for you, but it has been my favorite action/sci-fi movie this year. (Revolutions may change that however)

1467994,4,B00005JLTN,"To all of you who wrote reviews bashing this movie -- look at it again. And I mean, really, just look at it. This movie is beautiful. Maybe we've been numbed by the horrible Star Wars prequels, and other movies almost entirely crafted of CGI, but really...some of this movie is astonishing. Yes, there are times when Neo looks like a video game character, complain all you want. But my feeling, first of all, is that this movie is visually mind-boggling.
  The plot is fine. The dialogue isn't. While it's not horrible, Reloaded certainly could have benefitted from another once-over from the Wachowskis before being put to film. Reloaded tends to become more preachy than it needs to be, unlike its' superior predecessor.
  Finally, the fight scenes are good, but they take too long. The whole movie is too long. The fans are right -- chop the dancing in Zion, chop the sex scene or at least cut it down a little, the movie doesn't need it. The highway scene is great, Neo's fight sequence in the foyer isn't so great. Lose two to five minutes of it, and the audience will be more wowed.
  Overall, Reloaded is a bit of a let-down. But I'm sure once people have gotten over the hype, on home video and DVD, Reloaded's virtues will be better appreciated, maybe people will be able to stop picking at all of the parts that aren't as good as the first film's. And, as a final note...the trailer for Revolutions is astonishing. Visuals of the machine world are mind-boggling. Don't count this series out yet -- something is in store. And whether or not it's perfect is really irrelevant when we can see sights like the Wachowskis have dreamed up.

1467995,3,B00005JLTN,"If I were to review The Matrix Reloaded based purely on its action, this would be an easy **** 1/2. But there's a story here, tons of filler in-between the martial arts battles and car chases, and rather than pushing forward the momentum, it actually drags the film down. Hard to believe a plot about the surviving human race duking it out with their A.I. ""masters"" could turn out so boring, but there you go.
When we last left off, Neo (Keanu Reeves) had proven himself to be The One destined to free the human race from the Matrix, an artificial intelligence that has most of the population unknowingly trapped in a dream world. Those who escaped the fantasy settled to a city called Zion, where they're in preparation for a war against the invading machines.
Neo still has his doubts over his purpose, but none are shared by his lover and companion, Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss), nor Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne), the man who discovered him. But Neo, curious to discover what further action he should take, heads into the virtual world to search for the Oracle, who tells him to search for the Keymaker. Meanwhile, Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving), formerly one of the Matrix's prime enforcers, has become a rogue program, slowly taking over the system with an interesting reproducing technique.
For me, the original The Matrix hasn't held up so well over the years. I still argue that movie failed to achieve its potential, given such a rich and fascinating premise (which wasn't fulfilled here, either)(this series exists for the action, through and through), and its action sequences were somewhat overrated, similar styles having been accomplished (albeit with less slick and polish) from earlier Hong Kong pictures. That, and Dark City (a movie which The Matrix borrowed from) beat it to the punch with the concept of memory manipulation.
But the movie succeeded enough to at least make me look forward to the prospect of a sequel and that's where Reloaded comes in. And unfortunately, as fun as the plot may sound, too much of it is shaky and pretentious. That philosophy would be presented as a major theme is not unexpected, but for it to come across as so dull and uninteresting makes its inclusion heavy-handed. The scene where Neo, Morpheus, and Trinity debate with the Merovingian drags for far too long. Unless these characters have something truly interesting or vital to say, they should shut up and get moving (in case these people forgot, there is a countdown to the possible destruction of the only remaining human city).
Too much of this series is easy to rag on. In the virtual world, the Zion humans easily bring attention to themselves with their tight, dark attire and sunglasses. The Matrix is capable of manipulating the virtual environment (like blocking the exits in a building with brick walls, which is what happened in the original), but rarely does so even when its use would prove helpful in defeating Neo (and such further obstacles would have made the action even more fun).
But complain as I might, the action saves Reloaded and makes this otherwise strictly mediocre film worth watching. The most popular setpiece appears to be the highway chase, a fourteen-minute long spectacle that, for the most part, lives up to its reputation. It's not the best chase ever (Terminator 3 boasted an even more frenetic and exciting setpiece and Raiders of the Lost Ark still has the most rousing on-screen chase), but it is one hell of a thrill ride. Coupled with the preceding martial arts battle set in the castle, the non-stop fun lasts about twenty minutes. Not since Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom has a movie delivered non-stop creative and thrilling action for such a long period of time (but Temple actually did it twice, in the beginning and end).
Best of all is Neo's battle with the Agent Smiths, who quickly grow in numbers and have our superhero surrounded from all sides and angles. The sequence is a total blast and one of the more entertaining fight scenes I've seen all year.  All of Reloaded's action put together adds to about thirty or so minutes, not even a fourth of its running time, but the quality of it is enough for me to recommend the film, even if most of the rest of it is a bit of a bore.",1064707200,,4244,4.758480325644505

The restarting of the heart did not need to be there nor did the overly graphic content of the dance and sex scene.  All of those could have been done more tastefully.  The plot was quite thin.  I would have given this a lower rating but for the fact that I really enjoyed the scene where Smith decided he needed more copies.  The presence of Smith greatly added to the movie and I can hardly wait to see more of him.  Yes.... I hope the next movie has more script to go with the FX.

I wasn't really pleased with Animatrix either, but I was enough of a Matrix fan to go to see Reloaded despite the rancor people had with the film and my own significantly depressed expectations.
It was one of the best movie experiences of my life.
Maybe it's because it was on IMAX.  Maybe it's because I enjoy Japanese animation (even though Animatrix left me flat), so I'm used to cliffhanger endings.  But I was shaking--shaking!--with adrenaline from five minutes in until we left the theater.  The fight scenes were beautiful.  Unlike in Animatrix, the plot continues to twist and deepen.  Yes, I wonder why some of the new characters have been introduced, but the same characters will be in the sequel, so I expect more to be revealed.

People enjoy complaining about good things, and that will never change.  The Matrix Reloaded was a mind blowing movie, one of the best ever made.  Contrary to popular belief, there is a plot, and a good one with many elements attached.  If you don't think so, watch it again, this time with your eyes open.
The action sequences are at a level never before seen in a film.  There are numerous complaints about the battle with Neo and the agent Smiths going on for too long.  Funny, people thought it was great when he fought one agent in the first movie, but they whine when he fights 100 of them in this one?  Hello?  That's 100 agents!  If anything, a battle of that intensity should have gone on LONGER!  Words cannot describe how amazing that fight was.
I do have a couple points of dissatisfaction.  I do agree that the rave in the cave/sex scene should have been cut.  In fact, it should never have been filmed.  And the speech Morpheus delivered could have been done better.  But these points are overshadowed by the rest of the movie in it's greatness.
Take a look at how far we've come.  Take a moment to appreciate the innovative technology that went into this.  If The Matrix Reloaded isn't up to your standards, I suggest you quit watching movies now.  It won't get any better than this.",1064275200,,1414,4.45703125

With exception of estableshed SciFi movies like the Star Trek movies ( which are based on the first two Star Trek series) and the Star Wars movies (the orginal, special edition release and episodes 1 and 2) all of which I think they are expected to speak well of because all of them are so famous and well loved by fans, it's hard to find a SciFi movie that the critics speak well of. Critics just don't get Scifi.
If you're a Scifi fan don't pay any attention to critics abd thier movie ratings, if you think what you've seen in previews and heard from friends who like Scifi, than see the movie!
OK, that being said Matrix Reloaded is a great movie several reason. First off, in the orginal Matrix you only got to see the main charactor's abilites at the end of the movie, in Matrix Reloaded he has them throughout the movie, you see more of the resistance fighters besides those on the one ship from the first matrix movie not to mention the city that was only refered to in the original movie. One critic stated that it's ony half a movie, a guess he's never heard of something called a cliffhanger. Not to mention that they came up with a believe way to challenge the main charactor's new abilites that it consistant with what kind of world that the story takes place in and believable reasons why the main charactor should doubt himself again, so there is some question in the storyline as to if he can lead the resistance to victory, so it's not like it will be a walk in the park for the resistance. Any other gripes the critics have with this movie is simply because Scifi is simply over thier heads

One thing is for sure though: it certainly didn't live up to my expectations, particularly given how much I enjoyed the first Matrix. The first one somehow managed to combine outstanding special effects with an intelligent and well-plotted storyline. This one seemed to rely too much on special effects and did not do much to drive the story along in my opinion. Granted there were some really exciting scenes, but it wasn't enough to keep me consistently entertained. Unfortunately, it did not leave me eagerly anticipating the conclusion. I am still giving it 3 stars purely for the imagination that went into to whole series, and hopefully the third film will bring a little more storyline along with all the effects.",1064275200,3,864,4.805369127516778

I think they kept us all entertained with the matrix style action sequences and ofcaurse the Agent Smith that now can make multiple copies of himself and Neo can fly as we saw vaigly in the origional. The Revolutions does live up to the origional action (if not better).
The new characters that were introduced are all pretty cool, especially those twins. I think reloaded was a great movie and was necessary to build up to ""Revolutions"" in which I am greatly looking foward to.
I think people were disapointed because they wanted this 2nd trilogy to be better than the origional or live up to it.
But I believe they did what had to be done.

The choreography was awesome, but the scenes in between weren't compelling or inspiring or thought-provoking.

Acting performances are great, as are the fight scenes and ideas of the directors. Neo now has to face his destiny, and learn more about the matrix then he has ever known.
The audience is thrown back into this thriller, wondering what is going to happen next, in awe at the special scenes of the movie, and in awe of the special effects.
There were some scenes that were a little too long. A scene where Neo and Trinity prove their love to each other takes too long, and is one you do not want your children to see. The fight scenes were a little drawn out as well.

Not something I'd expect to see in the Matrix.  What bothered me the most about this film was the ending scenes.  The creators chose to cut back and forth between several scenes that took place at different times.  I found this disorienting and lost what was happening.  Then I REALLY wanted it to end so I could go home.  It was as if they still had lots to say at the end, but had run out of time to say it in.  So they chose to cut in between scenes and just mash it all together right at the end.
I truly wished they'd stopped with the original Matrix.  It was interesting and somewhat original.  It introduced philosophical themes to a society that otherwise might not consider them.  Now, it's simply becoming the Star Wars of this generation.  Too bad.  But I guess that's what separates ""movies"" from ""art"".  A film that is ""art"" is a gem all by itself.  A ""movie"" is just a moneymaker.",1064102400,2,1048,4.357512953367876
1468115,1,B00005JLTN,"First of all, the script is abysmal. The freeway scene where Neo is separated from his friends is blatantly contrived. There could not be a freeway scene if Neo was with them with his superhuman powers. With his powers to fly, it would seem he could have dispatched those Hong Kong kung fu extras in seconds. Think about it. Stopping that many bullets in mid air would take how much force???  He should have the power of a mac truck at least. Then Trinity leaves on an offramp leaving Morpheus and Keymaker behind when the most helpful thing would be to help them out.
As everyone knows, Zion was a waste. What could have been interesting to learn how 30th century or so humans lived, clogged up with abysmal dialog and performances. People in my theater showing were leaving for the exits soon after the Zion scene. Looks like some moviegoers know how to cut their losses these days and leave early.
I gave it a chance but the action turned out to be nothing but video game demos. I'd rate this sequel even lower than Jurassic Park II: The Lost World, marginally better than Godzilla.

I kept my mouth shut, determined not to ruin my friend's enjoyment, until the moment when the little Chinese man says to Neo ""You can never truly know someone until you fight them.""  WHAT?  That is the stupidest, cheesiest faux-philosophical line I've ever heard.  A lot of people want to say that it is ""The Phantom Menace Reloaded.""  And how dare those people?

The special effects look like they came code-for-code out of some nintendo64 game and the story, well, what story is there really to speak of?  It is all a bunch of stupid diversionary stuff (i.e.- The Marovingian) which does nothing to advance the story in any way.  The first one is a pretty good, if somewhat overrated, movie.  The second is just, simply, a terrible movie.  It has no story, no deep philosophical meaning, and no good action sequences.

Anyways, the action scenes in this movie were okay for the most part but can we come up with something other than the slow motion animation that is now so prevelant?  It was relatively fresh in the first one, now it is getting stale.  Another thing, why the scene with the infinite Agent Smiths?  I thought it was cool at first but dragged on too long.  And then the dialogue, gah.  I don't like Star Trek because of all the meaningless Technobabble and this stuff made Star Trek look exciting.  About the only scene I really liked was the restaurant.
However the thing that bugged me most was the abrupt ""ending"".  I realize this was because they were releasing Revolutions in November (or so they same).  It seems more like like they can make double the revenue if they release it as two movies instead of one.  So now that they've got this precedent, more movies will be released like this.

Now The Matrix Reloaded...was way better..the fighting scenes were unbeliveable!!!!, they never showed the same thing over, but it had a little to much talking, and a whole lot of action. In my thought i think Reloaded was better than the first Matrix. But Revolutions which is the third installment should be way better than the two Matrix movies puit together...So reloaded was really good, fighting scenes just to much!!!, unbelivable....if you don't like the matrix, take a look at another movie called Equilibiran",1063065600,2,589,5.276595744680851

If you want a movie that will engage your brain cells than ""The Matrix:Reloaded"" is the movie for you. Despite a few special effects that were new,none of them was breath taking except the freeway scene. Once again this movie is more about philosophy and ""waking up"",choosing the right direction that is not a selfish one,but Neo followed his heart instead of what was right.",1063065600,2,547,4.768421052631579

1468249,5,B00005JLTN,"The highest grossing R rated movie in history, The Matrix: Reloaded is a combination of thinking man's sci-fi thriller and summer blockbuster...and against the odds it's a worthy sequel to boot.  Just as the Two Towers was to Fellowship of the Ring, Reloaded doesn't waste any time re-introducing characters or re-establishing the setup...it kicks off a scant 6 months after the end of the original Matrix, and hits the ground running.
The movie trilogy, for those who haven't noticed, represents the cycle of life...The Matrix was all about birth (Neo's awakening) and eventually The Matrix: Revolutions will mark death for either the humans or the machine army.  This middle chapter celebrates life in all its glory...hence that sweaty rave/sex scene that garnered so much misunderstanding from the critics.  I really enjoyed that transitional sequence, and to me it juxtaposed nicely with the newly freed Smith, and his brutal reproductive methods.  Actor Hugo Weaving steals every scene he's in with exceptional gravitas and presence, not to mention some great action set pieces.
It has to be said that if you're easily confused by all the techno-talky sections then this movie may come across as four or five fight scenes strung together with blah-blah-blah dialogue.  I think you either buy into this movie world or you don't, and non believers probably shouldn't apply.  IMBD's forum's for this movie are rife with people bickering over whether or not Neo could have beaten all those Smith's....it's a film guys, and you either like it or you don't.  And if you didn't then don't watch it again.
For us jack-in types however, I think this movie has given us some of the most artfully arranged and splendidly realised action sequences ever devised...its what would happen if Jackie Chan married Bruce Lee, and John Woo conducted the ceremony.
I defy those who said the movie lacked a sense of humor in its depiction of action and violence...one only has to turn to veteran actor Harold Perrineau for some great comedy timing, and indeed the whole film is underscored with comic-book irreverance. The strong cast keeps things ticking, with Keanu Reeves continuing to impress both physically and with his intensity and commitment to his role; he evens manages to raise a few smiles with his deadpan delivery. Stony-faced Carrie Ann Moss pulls off a few funny lines, and Monica Bellucci provides some pleasant eye-candy as the movie segues into its showdown action scene.
Throw in special effects that make Star Wars look dull (and I'm a SW fan as well) with a thumping soundtrack and this is a DVD that your home theatre will fall in love with.  Shake the halls of Zion, and buy this movie.",1062979200,7,2694,4.971111111111111

First thing with Matrix Reloaded is the utter lack of script or plot. Producers and director tried to fill in this void by exposing the audience to never-ending shots of overwhelming special FX. The result is a dull movie that has no traces of the creativity displayed on the original Matrix where plot and visual FX were wisely combined. This time characters are flat and unbelieveble so we don't care for what happens to them.
Let's hope that Matrix Revolutions will leave a better taste in our mouths.
Don't waste your money in this DVD, buy a ""real movie"" instead for this is nothing but a 2-hour long trailer for the videogame (which by the way I'm sure will be much more interesting)",1062892800,2,838,4.630872483221476

If they would have tried to repeat what they did in the first, Reloaded would have been forced and alot worse. What the brothers did was take what they'd given us from the first Matrix and had fun with it. I mean, come on, a fight seen with 100 against 1. Sounds stupid on paper, but they pulled it off pretty good I think. If there had never been a first Matrix movie, this movie would still have done good by itself. I'd like to see any of these people writing bad reviews about Reloaded come up with what the brothers have given us. Say what you will but the Matrix trilogy will go down as one of the best in movie history. When my 70 yrs old grandma and grandpa have heard of the matrix, you know the word is out!",1062806400,4,854,4.0
1468315,4,B00005JLTN,"Do sequels stink? Ah, that eternal question. And the only right answer is: yes, but there are exceptions to the rule.
Now, is the overhyped Matrix Reloaded worth the criticism and/or praise? There's not an easy answer, since it's in fact only half of the movie and depending on the Matrix Revolutions to lift it up there with the Back To The Future II or sink it to Speed II (which is why Speed III wasn't made).
Let's examine the evidence bit by bit and make a conclusion of the whole...
Story - good, although it could be a lot better. And those 15-20 minutes after the initial action, including the sex-scene and Zion dancers should've been cut. Thanks to the DVD chapter system, that will be avoidable now!
Characters - some small development here and there (Neo as Jesus, Morpheus' beliefs a minority), but nothing worth writing home about. Some new characters (Niobe, Architect) clearly haven't played their whole role yet. And if Merovingian doesn't appear in the Revolutions with a significant role to play, I will feel cheated - not because he's a wonderful character (he is not) - but because it'll be clear he was put there to ""look cool and speak some french"" and not serve any higher narrative purpose. Also, it'll be a shame not to see a little more of Monica Belluci...
Action - the best directed and choreographed action you've ever seen. Outdoes the original Matrix, which is a tall order by itself. Finale on the freeway is unbelievable!
Dialogue - Machines are keeping us alive, while blah, blah, blah... Cause and effect... blah, blah, blah... Pretty boring when you hear it twice, but it's the same for the original. The exception is ""classic"" dialogue between Neo and the Oracle, as well as the final dialogue between Neo and the Architect, which are the only dialogues worth watching - especially the Architect's one, since it redefines the whole movie including the original Matrix. You have to watch it very closely and a few times to really get it.
Humour - in very small doses, the same as in the original. Trinity's ""excuse me"" line in the toillette is the only really funny moment.
Music - standard techno, nu metal combination with a few atmosferical numbers. The original Matrix soundtrack is better, but this one serves purpose as well.
Direction - pretty pedestrian, except for the action sequences. That 15-20 minutes really kills the momentum after the initial action and also deprives the movie of five-star rating. ""Bullet-time"" and ""frozen graphic moments"" are still powerful tools, especially during the freeway chase...
Effects - see action and direction!
Sound - great! Can't wait to see it on DVD in 5.1 surround!
Coolness - anything happening inside the Matrix is very cool indeed, while everything happening in Zion is not cool at all. Of course, it's the sunglasses that do it, not the acting or anything else.
CONCLUSION OF A MOVIE AS A WHOLE:
Well, I couldn't put it any better than the ""Empire UK"" reviewers put it: ""A five star experience, but not a five star movie."" It is better than most sequels, and it achieves that with being only a first half of the movie. That's impressive!
But, should you buy this DVD? Of course! Because of the chapter system on your DVD, Matrix Reloaded will be even better to watch at home!!!",1062806400,,3271,4.750439367311072

Also Morpheus has turned into some kind of poetic speech making moron. Where's the controled cool to the core leader from the first matrix?
But beyond that and a couple other irritations, I found the Matrix Reloaded to be intriguing. It was definately worth seeing and I will most definately see the third one and in theaters. The plot twists were just as mind blowing as the plot it's self, equalling almost the gasps of surprise evoked by the original matrix.

1468413,1,B00005JLTN,"Even though it has already been said before in other reviews, I still feel compelled to add to the list of disappointed viewers, only to possibly dissuade any other Matrix fans from wasting their money on this movie.  I absolutely loved the Matrix, it was an incredible movie full of special effects, great fighting, some really weird stuff going on, and a freshly approached plotline to the age old ""our world is dying"" theme.  ""Reloaded"" has none of the above, with the exception of some good fighting that gets very old and boring after awhile.
There is a finite amount of Kung Fu maneuvers that can be done, and repeating them over and over and over and over does not make a fight scene a good fight scene.  What plot there was to this sequel could have been whipped out by the screenwriter's five year old between juice and bedtime.  So exactly what did I not like about it?  Waiting for two hours and twenty minutes and still not seeing the plot.  Waiting through fight after fight after fight with no originality added except Neo's ability to fly.  Wow.  He should have flown away from some of the fights sooner just to save me some of the time I wasted watching this.  The Zion/orgy and Neo/Trinity scene should have been left on the cutting room floor, along with the idealistic snooze-fest of a speech from a Morphius who has morphed from powerful, enigmatic leader to a boring fuss-pot of a wanna-be philosopher.  Yawn.  When all the Smith replicates kept coming, why didn't Neo fly away sooner?  If Neo has become ""The One"", why can't he read the Oracle better...
Sorry, I just could not find one thing to like about this sequel.  Some sequels are worth

Third, what's with all these customer complaints? If you didn't like the movie then simply don't watch it again. Is it that hard to figure out? Don't go rent it, and most certainly don't buy it if you were disappointed. I personally can't wait for this DVD to come out October 14. Plus it's a 2 disc set.

As a result, I was fairly surprised to find that this installment was very well done and easy to watch, despite having several overly wordy and meaningless scenes like the first one did.
The movie chronicles the continuing adventures of a group of human rebels fighting to free the human race from the shackles of mental and physical imprisonment. One of the obligations of any sequel is that it ramp up what came before it, and this one does that in spades. The original bullet time fight scenes were impressive on their own; this time we're treated to such spectacles as hundreds of copies of a bad guy throwing themselves at one super-powered human, or an amazing freeway chase that runs about 15 minutes but only feels like 5 because it's so exciting. Action fans (especially martial arts fans) won't be disappointed here.

The script, while sharp in spots, is laugh-inducing... While the W brothers have high-minded ideas about where they want this story to head, they are stuck in the messiah loop... How many times do we have to watch Keanu Reeves stare off in space in divine speculation? For this viewer, it was about fifteen times too many. The Zion orgy scene was also rather annoying. The final few moments of the film held a ray of hope, however. I don't want this review to discourage fans of the Matrix from seeing Reloaded, just don't let the hype fool you.

But where were all the pithy comments from Morpheus, as in the first movie? All we get is (in response to ""But you told us going on the freeway is suicide"") ""Let us hope I was wrong.""
The main characters don't even have time to slow down and make their jazzy idiosyncracies, like the way Morpheus snaps his mirror pince-nez on his nose with one hand. Instead we get a Spielberg- or Lucas-style mishmosh of never-ending action and change of scene... except, of course, for the embarrassing, lame alternating love scene/dirty dance scenein Zion...  That scene could have been half as long and still be too long.
Then, how about ""I just love you too damn much!"" Did the first Matrix movie have ANY stupid, useless lines? Just heal the girl already and be done with it.
And then there's the Superman routine, dumb to begin with and made worse by constantly shifting back to a couple people on the ship, watching and making comments. Dumb and dumber.
The architect came across as a crabby old know-it-all with prostate trouble. He was supposed to be an impatient, dictatorial figure (I guess) but instead came across as Jay Leno's Mr. Brain character in his Geritol years.
How about the whole sequence visiting the Merovingian? No rhythm there, no structure, but there certainly was plenty of cheap sexual innuendo. Not the type of material that brought me to love the first Matrix film.
The highway scene is fantastic -- really raised the bar on chase scenes and action scenes. The multiple Agents Smith started out interesting -- then got old. And why is it, in the building where the Architect sits, every time a door opens there's another agent behind it? Corny! I've seen Lost in Space episodes with deeper content!

Also I did not like the idea that Zion is constantly destroyed and then rebuilt. What is up with that? It is explained as a flaw in the program and that Neo's purpose is to fix the issues that exist with the Matrix. I guess these coders who wrote the Matrix software must have taken programming lessons from the Microsoft programmers who write Winblows..umm...Windows.
The special effects with the french guys and some of the action scenes were nicely done but overall the movie left me wanting more and I hope that the third movie is better than the second one.

And to make it worst, this was all triggered by what was supposed to be an inspiring speech given by morpheus.  Only thing I got was a pitiful chuckle as Lawrence Fishburn tried to mix stern calmness with fiery rhetorics, only to fail miserably.
I was seriously considering leaving the theater and maybe rent a DVD or something at this point in the movie.  But I stayed put, mainly because I rode with my friends and I wasn't the driver.  No choice.  So I groaned and watched the rest of the movie in state of boredom.  It wasn't until I finished watching the film and started discussing it with my friends at a local restaurant that I started to 'get' the movie.
I consider this a renter, but if you already own the first movie, might as well own the second in the trilogy.",1062115200,,1278,4.3277310924369745

It had amazing graphics, a great plot, the best action sequences I've ever seen in any movie, and for god sakes...it revolutionized the visual effects industry.  And I was waiting for the sequal for months, a week before hand I had reserved tickets....and I went to see it, and how does it start...great, it's so cool...however, once they arrive at the orgy/techno scene, as I refer to it, where keanu and carrie are making love, that scene is lost in an otherwise five star film, it is unneccessary to the premise of the movie, and takes away from it.  Also some of the computer graphic shots in the movie are a little obvious, however...the plot is amazing, and so is the ending...it just leaves u wanting more.  This is a definite must see...and for anybody who has seen the first matrix 3 times or more, a definite must buy...there are some amazing characters in there...the ghosts, that french guy...haha, ""I love cursing in french, it is like wiping ur ass with silk"", and of course...the best part of the whole film is that Neo can freaking fly, how cool is that??  And what an amazing way to save trinity's life. Sure there are the annoying things like agent smith's repetiveness...we get the idea ok, he can go into other people, and duplicate himself....but if u want a movie that u can watch over and over and enjoy over and over, if you want a movie with an amazing soundtrack, great acting, some wisdom, and most importantly...a movie that will make you think, and leaves you gripping...this is your movie my friend.  4/5 stars...and that's all folks!!!",1061942400,6,1666,4.6305084745762715

Neo fight scene I feel could have been done better by the makers of southpark, cheap computer graphics that were so obvious it was a slap in the face.  The love making scene was so lame it was laughable.  Not to mention all the mistakes - I thought they took out all the plugs save for the brain ones...no no no they are back.
this was over all a horid bomb and will only hope they spend more time on the third.  Watch it only for the progression to the third.",1061942400,4,605,4.008333333333334
1468495,4,B00005JLTN,"I'm beginning to think that a lot of the people who bash the movie are forgetting one very important fact about this film. It is a SEQUEL. Being a sequel, it doesn't have to have as much story in it as the first. Of course there wasn't much character development, we already know the character form the first movie. If there was any more development to the base character, they would all be complaining about how it was nothing but a rehash of everything we already knew from the first movie. And let's face it, if you haven't seen the first Matrix, you have no business seeing the second. It's the equivalent of starting to read a book two hundred pages in and complaining about why you can't understand any of it.
For me, the movie was way better than I thought it would be. Sequels rarely ever live up to the original. Either they suck or they are so-so. It's almost certain doom for a movie just relating it to a good first movie. Even more so when there is a lot of hype surrounding it. I went to the theater expecting this movie to be a bomb because of those two facts. I wasn't expecting a lot, so I was blown away.
The downfall with this movie seems to come from the people who went in expecting it to be better than the first. Sorry folks, but that ain't gonna happen anytime in this universe. While Reloaded wasn't better than the first, it certainly ranks up there with being just as good.
Now, for someone that is actually praising it, you may wonder why I only rated it with four stars. There were some things I did have a problem with. The sex scene between Trinity and Neo. It seemed out of place with the overall feel of the movie. But even that can be forgiven. A coworker of mine explained her take on it as the scene showing the emotional struggle Neo is going through with his feelings for Trinity and his dreams. It made sense when she explained it the way she did.
The scene I had the biggest problem with was Neo fighting the Smith's. Effects wise, it was a stunning scene. The metaphor behind it was pretty neat as well, using Smith as a virus that is spreading through out the Matrix. But it just got to the point where it was too long. And too fast. I found myself becoming disoriented with how fast the action was moving. To really be able to follow it, I had to let my eyes become unfocused and not try to concentrate on just Neo.
And, for the record, if you remember the end of the first movie, Neo flew then. He got off the phone and shot upwards. He is able to do this in the Matrix because being The One, he is essentially rewriting the code for the Matrix. He's not flying, he's just rewriting the program to allow himself to be able to do this.
In short, don't expect a lot from this movie before you see it. You'll only end up disappointing yourself. Do not expect it to be like the first and you should be just fine. It's a very good movie and one I highly recommend seeing.",1061856000,4,2910,4.235611510791367
1468496,4,B00005JLTN,"The Matrix Reloaded was one of the most highly anticipated movies of 2003 but it received a less than rapturous response from the critics on its theatrical release and under-performed at the box office, despite making over $275 m to date in the U.S. alone. This is not to say that it's bad. It certainly isn't and for the most part I thoroughly enjoyed The Matrix Reloaded. It's just not as good as the first movie and not as good as expected. Furthermore it is another classic Hollywood example of failing to grasp the simple concept that less is sometimes more. For if the Wachowski brothers are guilty of anything then it is over egging the pudding.
So what's good and what's bad about The Matrix 2? Well, let's start with the good.
First off, The Matrix Reloaded is (in parts) jaw-droppingly spectacular in scale and confidence with three or four action breath taking sequences that go beyond anything else ever attempted on celluloid. This is the all-new flying and exploding upgrade and The Wachowskis, Yuen Wo-Ping and John Gaeta's effects wizards have combined to create some stunningly original sequences. The best of which include; Neo (Keanu Reeves) battling 100 Agent Smiths (Hugo Weaving), a chateau sword-fight and in particular a lengthy freeway set sequence where Neo, Morpheus, Trinity, indulge in a free for all with Agents Johnson, Jackson and the virtually indestructible Merovingian twins. On this basis alone The Matrix Reloaded completely delivers (and then some) exactly what its fans want and the second half of the movie is nothing short of excellent  but the first hour in particular contains some very glaring faults.
The biggest thing that is wrong with The Matrix Reloaded is that it is far too long (138 minutes) and full of unnecessary and elongated sequences that could have been trimmed back half an hour or so. Due to this, the opening hour of Reloaded positively labours and the Zion-set opening sequence is at least a quarter of an hour overlong with a rather pointless and frankly rubbish love scene between Trinity and Neo among it's many unnecessary moments. There is also far too much furrowing of Neo's brow and emphasis on cod philosophy (more pretentious than profound) and the nature of choice, free will and reality. Apart from this being far too earnest it is also very much a repetition of everything already discussed in the first movie. Meanwhile, many of the new characters are decidedly underwritten and the likes of Monica Bellucci and Jada Pinkett Smith are frankly wasted. Plus, whilst accepting that this is the middle part of a trilogy, the plot is very linear and by the time the credits roll it could be argued that the story has hardly advanced from the end of part one.
All that said the second half of the movie is very exciting rollercoater ride and succeeds in raising the bar in action and SFX. On this basis alone, Reloaded is still well worth watching and worthy of 4 stars but just be warned, it isn't as good as its five star predecessor...",1061856000,3,3009,4.808880308880309
1468497,1,B00005JLTN,"With all that this movie could have been this was all the Wachowski Brothers could give us? What a shame. An earlier review said that the Zion scenes were an excuse to extend the film, I must disagree; that is too simple. Rather every slow motion fight (in other words every fight) was the tool used to turn a 40-minute movie into 138 minutes of utter boredom (the Zion scenes were just a waste of time).
  A massive fight scene with bullet-time at key moments is exhilarating (see the lobby battle in the Matrix). A quick fight ALL in slow motion is tedious. And that is what we get, over and over and over. Even the freeway fight, which should have been incredible, is reduced to a yawn by the overuse of one now tired special effect. Let's face it, bullet-time was the coolest effect any of us had seen since the first time we saw that Star Destroyer pass overhead on a theater screen in Star Wars, but it's not 1999 and we see it used everywhere now, even in commercials. We were told we'd be knocked out of our seats by Reloaded not put to sleep in them.
  Of course, now that it's on DVD we'll be able to use fast forward. Believe me, this will be a blessing for watching this movie. The audience I sat with in the theater were all wishing they had it.",1061769600,7,1258,4.2510460251046025
1468498,4,B00005JLTN,They did not do the sound track on the first Matrix in DTS 5.1 sound and it is weak!  Now they are going to do the same thing again with the sequal.  All of the money spent on sound for the movie but yet when it goes to DVD they will not invest in DTS.  The sound should always be neck and neck with the picture quality.  It is sad.,1061683200,,332,3.7
1468579,3,B00005JLTN,"This movie was pretty cool, but I had higher expectations than the film delivered. I would have given the film 3.5 stars if the rating were avalible, but I decided to leave it at 3 rather than rounding up. My largest complaint would have to be the whole Zion Orgy/Sex Scene. What was this doing in here? It served no purpose other than to secure an R rating, and it was so dragged out that it cut into the the pacing of an already slow to start film. So basically, I don't see why it was in there to begin with. In the theater, I used the time the scene gave me to refill my popcorn. With the DVD, thankfully I can click the ""next chapter"" button. Much like the Enter the Matrix videogame wich launched similtaniousely, the movie has enough good points to justify putting up with the dissapointments, but it still fails to live up to the hype miserably (okay, ""Miserably"" is way to harsh a word to describe either of them, but it's all I can think of that sounds good). I still enjoyed the film quite a bit, but I think the Wachowski brothers got a bit too cocky from their sucsess with the first film, much like Rowland Emmeric and Dean Devlin with the steller Independence Day and the fun, but flawed Godzilla remake. A director's cut treatment with this DVD could have done marvels, provided that they trimmed out all the un-desirable material (read: ZION ORGY/SEX SCENE, amongst others) and improved the pacing, but it looks like the Wachowskis don't want to alter their ""masterpiece"" at all. But hey, we still get a second disc loaded with goodies, and if you really hate the film that much, you can always just watch the action scenes.",1061424000,,1641,4.45514950166113
1468580,5,B00005JLTN,"I am one of the few people I know who actually thought The Matrix Reloaded was a great movie.  The action is mind blowing the story though slow at times answered questions left by the first movie, and the overall feel of the movie was simply electric.
The key to enjoying this movie is to forget about the first movie's insane special effects and rave reviews.  Because although this movie has the best action sequences I've ever seen they aren't that much more insane than the first movie's action sequences.  I think the reason so many people were disappointed with this movie is simply because they were expecting the impossible which is a sequal that has action scenes exponentially better than the first movie, plus a plot that is as fresh and innovative as the first movie.  Look the first movie introduced a whole new way of filming an action movie, you can't expect the sequal to be just as fresh it's just not possible!
Bottomline is in my opinion this movie is just as good if not better than the first one and though many may say otherwise it is still an awsome movie that is ten times better than any other action movie out there.  Don't give this movie the cold shoulder just because of the reputation it's prequal has.",1061337600,,1232,4.531531531531532
1468581,4,B00005JLTN,"I give The Matrix Reloaded four stars for brilliant special effects, great characters and a good storyline, even though some of the mystery was taken away. The Wachowski brothers must have done some serious brainstorming to figure out how to top The Matrix. They didn't top it, but they delivered a satisfactory sequel.
Unlike a lot of other reviewers here, I loved the fight scenes, even the long skirmish between Neo and Agent Smith. They kept upping the ante, testing each other's limits. They don't seem to have found any yet, but they have a measure of each other. It gives us a good foretaste of their own personal armageddon.
The biggest problems for me were the scenes of Zion. It was partly what I imagined, and then a whole lot of what I didn't imagine. Aside from taking away the mystery of the last refuge of humanity, the Wachowskis added some quite ludicrous scenes to the mythology. The pointed effort to make Zion a PC melting pot was one of them. Do Neo, Morpheus, etc. go out of their way to free a representative number of races???
The other unnecessary thing in the Zion scenes was the religious service. Granted, there already was a philosophical/religious theme in the Matrix that contributed to its appeal, but the orgy-like dance party was just silly. It looked like an ecstasy-fueled rave, or an ancient pagan worship rite. Like a fellow viewer commented, it made me feel these are not people worth saving, let the machines have 'em!
Fortunately, the directors redeemed the rest of the movie with continuing good action, some great new characters (the programs, not the humans) and further mind-blowing revelations in the dialogue with the Architect. Looking forward to a smashing finish.",1061337600,,1713,4.849829351535837

Here is the sad fact: If this was the first movie, there would be no sequel. The only reason for this movie is so that the studio can make this a Trilogy (so we can buy a boxed set), it is a franchise just like a Disney movie, complete with action figures and video games.  I hope part 3 ties this all together but my expectations are low. I think the W brothers are great but this movie was 2.5 hours without any memorable dialogue and ridiculous psychobabble as the script. This is not a ""well its just not as good as the original"", this is a matter of; it is simply not that good a movie, great action, great cinematography but bad dialogue and plot, that we hope ties together in part 3.

1468584,3,B00005JLTN,"Before I begin, I must say that I am not a lover of action movies. However, I consider The Matrix to be one of the best films I saw in 1999.  Along with movies like Minority Report, The Matrix manages to be much more than an action movie. The original film provides enough fodder for philosophical discussions to last for years, but sadly I cannot say the same of The Matrix Reloaded.
Due to the success of the first film, I assume the sequel probably had a much larger budget. But it is obvious that the money was spent toward special effects and action scenes rather than developing a script as thought-provoking as the first. The minor philosophical issues raised by characters like the Architect and Merovingian are painfully boring to sit through. These scenes attempt to cram as much philosophical discussion in the shortest amount of time so that the film might move on to the next action sequence. And while some of these action sequences are stunning--as most people have mentioned, the car chase is brilliant--many of them fail to blend CGI effects into live action footage very successfully. Therefore, several times I felt as I though I was watching someone play a video game rather than watching a film. The Wachowskis also put themselves in a difficult position because of Neo's seeeming invincibility in the Matrix. Since Neo can manipulate the Matrix any way he chooses, the action sequences involving Neo have the most possibility of being spectacular. But since Neo can manipulate the Matrix any way he chooses, the audience feels safe that he will not die and, therefore, little dramatic tension is created. Fights involving Morpheus and Trinity have dramatic tension because they do not have the same control of the Matrix as Neo does, but those action sequences will not be as spectacular as Neo's.
As far as the plot is concerned, the film doesn't seem to follow through with it. At the beginning of the film, the machines are going to attack Zion and at the end of the film, the machines have still yet to attack Zion. The Matrix Reloaded felt like the first two and half hours of a five hour film, which will be continued when Revolutions comes out. The script also fails to provide any real character development, especially for the new characters.",1061251200,,2273,4.769035532994923

1468587,2,B00005JLTN,"Okay, the Matrix was amazing, I loved it, blah blah blah.  Everybody knows this stuff.  The Matrix Reloaded was a disappointment.  First of all, since M2 & M3 are really two parts to one long movie, you get all of the build up for a four hour movie at the beginning of Matrix Reloaded... way too much down time to start a story with such energy.  The Zion ""orgy""/Neo-Trinity crossover was totally unneccessary and just seemed gratuitous.  The story is not one about sex, the first movie didn't have that kind of stuff in it, and this one didn't need it either.  The Agent Smith-Neo battle was way too long and way to redundant.  We got the idea after 2 or 3 minutes.  The story is a pretty deep and thought provoking one, but did they have to make it soooooooo complicated?  It finally got to the point that I didn't care anymore what was real and who would win.  The video game tie-in is kind of cool, but I'm sure some of that substory in the game would have been better in the film.  It couldn't have been worse than some of the scenes that actually made it on screen.  The one redemptive attribute of the Matrix Reloaded is the highway fight scene.  I guess it was worth sitting through all of the garbage to see that, but I would recommend just skipping to that part if you're watching at home.  And then the movie ends... in mid-scene.  A cliffhanger?  No, a disappointment.  I own the first one, I'll never buy this one, and I'll probably wait to rent the next one.

I think that the true undercurrent to their thought processes is that they may lack the intellect to appreciate good story telling and amazing attention to detail. ""dude?""  This film leaves the viewer asking questions.  I think that Reloaded is likely the best sequel since Empire Strikes Back.  Yes it has superior special effects; yes it has some of the best fight scenes ever filmed.  However, it is a larger movie than that.  It has the one thing that so many movies lack today...plot.  With strong characters, fine acting, and a setting that is obviously loved by the creators, this series will emerge as the some of the greatest cyber punk films since Blade Runner.  I think that many people don't like it because they don't understand it.  Unfortunately, American society wants everything spoon fed to them.  Most want to go to a movie and watch girls in tight clothing do stupid stuff and say silly lines...i.e. Charlie's Angels.  Many people who don't like Reloaded prefer lame brain movies like Legally Blonde or other such trash.  Sadly, Hollyweird always takes the hint (that is why we have shelves of crap.)

1468659,2,B00005JLTN,"This movie had several problems with it and none of them were that it was difficult to understand. The plot was fairly smooth and moved the story along from where the last one left off, with a few fun twists added for good measure. My problem was with some of the less important scenes.
First of all, the last human city on earth, Zion, a city that is surviving hundreds of miles below the planet, supported by phenominal technology. OK, if this is true then why is everybody in it dressed like Daryl Hannah in Clan of the CAve Bear? Wow, we can support this city off the power of the core of the Earth, but Shoes? Hmmm, those are a little too difficult for us to figure out yet.
My next problem. Morpheus (Lawrence Fishburn) gets up in front of the multitudes to inspire them and take away the fear many are experiencing due to the impending attack on the city. The speech, given in a slowed down monotone that he must have learned from watching Brad Pitt in Meet Joe Black, was much better written and delieverd by Mel Gibson in Braveheart, This speech could have been helped by a different writer and Morpheus having a few cups of coffee before delivering it . However in spite of the lack of anything inspiring in the speech, the crowds, in their cave people outfits go wild in the cave and begin dancing and writhing in the mud upon hearing it, which brings me to my third and fourth problems with the movie.
Keanu Reeves and CArrie Ann Moss are a couple now, and are of course very eager for some privacy upon reaching Zion, fine, then show them making out as the door closes and we will get the idea that they are going to have sex. But the movie doesn't do that. This couple has no chemestry together, zero, zilch, Jody Foster and Harvey Firestein would have more sexual tension between them. And instead of just nixing the sex scene for being boring the movie tries to spice it up by cutting every 5 or 10 seconds to shots in slow motion of the crowd, soaking wet, covered with mud dancing in what could best be described as a very expensive Christina Aquillera video.
People in the audience were laughing at this scene. It was so ridiculous that it was difficult to take the rest of the movie seriously.
I liked the story but lets just see the plot, the special effects, and whats going to happen next, no more chorus lines of writhing cro magnum teens mixed with shots of Keanu and Carrie Ann each doing their best not to yawn themselves to death.
It is amazing to me that these scenes didn't hit the cutting room floor. I am willing to bet that there were MANY scenes deleated that would have been much more fun to watch.
See this movie so you'll know whats going on in the third one, but you probably won't want to see it twice.",1061078400,10,2741,4.345029239766082
1468660,5,B00005JLTN,"Obviously, the original ""Matrix"" has set the precedent for every action film that has followed it. With the Brothers Wachowski borrowing from classic sci-fi themes crossed with cyberpunk sensibility, futuristic and experimental camera techniques, hyperkinetic Hong Kong/John Woo shoot-'em-ups, and almost ballet-like martial arts choreography from the Master, Yuen Woo Ping helped combine for a film that will always be one-of-a-kind. However, that didn't stop every action film from ""Charlie's Angels"" to ""Cradle 2 the Grave"" trying to duplicate its gravity-defying fight scenes. The East has influenced the West, for better or worse. How many ""Matrix"" clones will there be? The answer is quite a few. But it is not of these blatant rip-offs that I wish to comment on. It is its superior sequel, ""The Matrix Reloaded"", which offers not just more of the same but an improvement and expansion on the thematic elements and technical wizardry that made its predecessor unique. Those are where this film succeeds the most. It, like the first film, has the same stale performance from Keanu Reeves, who, as Neo, the prophetic messiah-like hero, has finally found his best use in Hollywood as a human action figure. It also bears another great scene-stealing performance(s) from Hugo Weaving as Smith, Neo's nemesis. But the film's real area of improvement is its use of the ideas of reality, destiny, purpose, and fate. All of these ideas are expanded on and done with more intelligence than the first. There are many more ideas to give your brain a workout rather than just another summer brain rubdown (or worse, a beating, like the ungodly awful ""League of Extraordinary Gentlemen""). Basically, when you leave this film, you are filled with a great many questions, some fascinating ideas, and a sense of foreboding rather than everything tied up in a neat little package, which far too many films this particular summer have had. But not to fail in their always pushing-the-envelope attitude, the Wachowski Brothers have more or less removed the massive gunplay from the first in favor of improving the martial arts sequences. The first really major sequence, which involves Neo fighting a seemingly never-ending swarm of Smiths, is breathtaking to behold. When I get my hands on this DVD, there will be a lot of frame-by-frame use and slo-mo work. Obviously, it doesn't end there. The freeway chase scene that employs all of the various fighting styles and camera tricks and breakneck speed to make for a real edge-of-your-seat adrenaline blast. All in all, it's everything that a sequel should be: bigger, faster, riskier where the stakes are higher and the decisions the characters make have reall causality.

To be Continued
why didn't anyone tell me? setup for a 6 month wait. just like the ""lord of the rings"" trilogy.
guess the cliffhangers add to the bottom line.
second, i like science fiction, read lots when i was a kid, never grew up as a result. so even a bad sci-fi interests me.
And this isn't bad. Needs to be seen in order with the first part however, too much continuity depends on it. plus character development.
The underlying philosophy is delivered via soliloquy, neither very subtile, nor a particularly interesting way. I expect better from well paid sci-fi writers, see ""Lord of the Rings"" or ""StarWars"" for much better, under-the-mental-radar way of introducing complex philosophic themes. It's a shame, the lead idea, choice and the difference it makes is a big issue (see something like for the loss of a horse shoe the kingdom was lost). Human destiny and freewill are complex issues, not just for philosophy or religious textbooks but for good sci-fi, sadly this does injustice to the complexity of this issue. It is not a matter of two doors. no, needs more thinking work before the scripting of the fights.
Likewise the new theme, akin to the Buddhist great wheel of life, revolving in big cycles, redoing, renewing, re-rolling, is introduced in the white room with the maker soliloquy. It answers a few questions, asks a few more, but heavy handed, being far too verbal. Now NEO as superman, as prophet, as ultimate decider for the fate of the human race is a nice touch, but inadequate background was laid. The scenes in Zion with him as a revered figure and the dance scene were well done and up to the standard of the best in sci-fi, but they could not pull the whole weight of the movie.
So all in all, an ok movie, but not in the class of the very best in sci-fi, but why should it be, in the last analysis it is little more than a kungfu movie with a good plot set in the dystopic future, but i'd prefer ""black rain"" or ""bladerunner"" in this genre.",1060992000,,2035,4.532608695652174

All these people saying they didn't like the movie are obviously watching it for the wrong reasons.  The Matrix is not just an action movie to get cheap thrills out of, its much more than that.  The Matrix is about opening your mind to the possiblities that may be.  I can't wait for the DVD to come out, I'm sure its going to have some amazing extras for us interested in watching a movie that has a meaning.

1468663,5,B00005JLTN,"The Matrix Reloaded was one of the best films I have ever seen. I loved not only the action, but also the way the story was told, and the development of the characters throughout the movie.
  Reloaded follows the story of Neo (a.k.a ""The One"") and his quest to help Zion win the war against the machines. With him are his partners Trinity and Morpheous and many more characters as they battle their way through the complex world of the The Matrix.
  For anyone who likes intense action and a little romance, (not to mention a little language) Reloaded is the movie you should see.",1060819200,,580,4.495238095238095
1468664,4,B00005JLTN,"...which is exactly why a lot of people supposedly did not like the movie. Lets get the obvious out of the way: Reloaded was a hugely anticipated movie with enough hype surrounding it to cover the universe. It was the sequel to one of the most popular sci-fi/action movies in history, and probably one of the best. You can't help the fact that many people are going to walk away from the theatre either confused as hell, very angry or very happy. The Matrix Reloaded is not perfect, but I consider it equally as good as the first. It even surpasses it in a lot of ways, and in some it doesn't come close. But make no mistake... Reloaded is for the chosen.
The plot here is deeper then the grand canyon. For some, it may be considered a mess. But this is far from the truth, and is  simply the result of a lack of understanding the films very complex plot. For the deep thinkers out there, who can really take the plot in and spring up theory after theory about whats going to happen next, those are the people who are really going to love this movie; like me.
Casual movie-goers will like the movie for it's amazing action sequences and special effects, which easily set the new standad in movies. Hardcore Matrix fans will either love this movie to death and spend countless hours discussing the movies plot with there friends until part three is released, or they will hate it because they could not get over the first movie. Reloaded really deepens the plot... so much so that many will just walk away boggled.
The movie does have it's flaws. One example would be Keanue Reevers (Neo). His acting, as usual, isn't exactly... impressive, but he is what he is and you can probably deal with that. Another problem is that there is a bit less of a 'feeling of danger' with the main characters while they are in the Matrix. In the first movie, you really felt like they were being hunted every minute by Agents. In Reloaded, it more or less feels like they are just doing whatever the hell they want. But considering Neo is the One now, and he can kick anyones [butt], you can't really help that. The last problem I had was that Morpheus is just too much different in this movie than the first. He just felt more human in the last film.
The Matrix Reloaded is an amazing movie that deserves much credit for it's insanely impressive special effects, camera work and action scenes. No other action movie can match what's here. And as for the plot, you will most likely love it if you can understand it and just accept it.",1060819200,,2517,4.424568965517241

1468666,4,B00005JLTN,"I give The Matrix Reloaded four stars for brilliant special effects, great characters and a good storyline, even though some of the mystery was taken away. The Wachowski brothers must have done some serious brainstorming to figure out how to top The Matrix. They didn't top it, but they delivered a satisfactory sequel.
Unlike a lot of other reviewers here, I loved the fight scenes, even the long skirmish between Neo and Agent Smith. They kept upping the ante, testing each other's limits. They don't seem to have found any yet, but they have a measure of each other. It gives us a good foretaste of their own personal armageddon.
The biggest problems for me were the scenes of Zion. It was partly what I imagined, and then a whole lot of what I didn't imagine. Aside from taking away the mystery of the last refuge of humanity, the Wachowskis added some quite ludicrous scenes to the mythology. The pointed effort to make Zion a PC melting pot was one of them. Do Neo, Morpheus, etc. go out of their way to free a representative number of races???
The other unnecessary thing in the Zion scenes was the religious service. Granted, there already was a philosophical/religious theme in the Matrix that contributed to its appeal, but the orgy-like dance party was just silly. It looked like an ecstasy-fueled rave, or an ancient pagan worship rite. Like a fellow viewer commented, it made me feel these are not people worth saving, let the machines have 'em!
Fortunately, the directors redeemed the rest of the movie with continuing good action, some great new characters (the programs, not the humans) and further mind-blowing revelations in the dialogue with the Architect. Looking forward to a smashing finish.",1060560000,,1713,4.849829351535837

Then the movie came along. Then, a lot of fan groups were created, everyone with their own opinion. But three were the basic:
THE FEWER. They liked the movie more then the first one. I'm in this group.
THE MORE. They hated this film.
THE MOST. Although they enjoyed it, they liked the first one better.
Yes, the truth is that the film was extremely boring in the first half hour of the film. Yes, it's true that some special effects looked really fake-and some actions scenes too. But did we excpected much?
The movie had more action then dialogue, and when it had dialogue, it was silly and boring. Except the end that is.
Now, I'm not gonna be too descriping because I do not wish to be a spoiler.
What is the Matrix? If you would ask me this question one year ago, I would have answered you with confidence. But now that I have watched the movie, everything changed. Everything is possible.
So, I've got something to suggest to the MORE group of people. This movie is not maybe bad. Maybe it's a bad Matrix movie(for you, that is) but not a bad movie. Think about it, before you hate it again.",1060041600,7,1205,4.408071748878924
1468719,4,B00005JLTN,"I've read some of the complaints about this movie and I must say that I wholeheartedly agree.  And I wholeheartedly disagree.
I saw this movie twice; the first time I didn't like it and the second time I did.  Since then I've had lots of time to think about it and try to understand it.
I'd like to address the first part of the movie, specifically Morpheus' speech and the resulting mob dance/love scene.  The first time I saw the movie I thought it was absolutely ridiculous.  I tried to enjoy it, but the only thing that popped into my mind was an image of two ...filmmakers from Chicago snickering like little schoolboys as they huddled behind the camera during the filming of the scene.  By all accounts it was at best unnecessary and at worst one of the most awkward and uncomfortable-to-watch love scenes I've ever seen.
And then there's Morpheus' speech.  How bland!  How cartoonish!  I'm a huge Matrix fan, but even my enthusiasm for the movie, along with my sincerest attempt to get caught up in the moment, could not enable me to get energized by it.  Not even a little.  I certainly didn't feel like getting up and dancing like the rest of the crowd obviously did.  And my life wasn't even in danger.  Theirs were!
The second time I watched the movie I still didn't really care for it, although I was better able to ignore it and wait patiently for the parts that I did like.
It wasn't until last night when I read some of the reviews that I realized that there was actually a point to all this silliness.  However, the point is lost on someone who is watching the movie for the first time.  To really appreciate this section of the movie, you must know the whole story.  ...
By the way, the only reason why I gave this movie four stars instead of five was because I thought the flow suffered a little due to the blending of the storyline of the movie with the game ""Enter the Matrix"".  Some parts that are skimmed over in the movie are shown in more depth in the game.  The idea was interesting, but I believe that the movie could have been better if they hadn't chopped it up and divided some of the scenes between the movie and the game.  Since they won't be trying this with the third movie, I have a feeling that it will be much more streamlined and smooth like the first movie.",1060041600,8,2295,4.36
1468720,3,B00005JLTN,"OK rather than bore everyone with the usual complaints (Zion, Trinity/Neo, etc.), I would first like to say that I was intrigued by the philosophy debate going on among the main characters, well actually the secondary characters (Jon Voight, the Merovigian, the Archiect, etc.). I was a tad disappointed that none of these solioquaies seemed to reach any conclusion. Presumably they will in the third installment, though I think that on some level that is a mistake since most of the audience will have a tough time remembering all that philosophy after six months (perhaps it is a cheap ploy to get everyone to buy the DVD).
One of my biggest (original) complaints is the overly long battle between Neo and Smith. After about three minutes of an essentially repetitive battle, all I could think was, ""Yes he can replicate himself. Can we please move it along?"" The freeway battle was superb precisely because it moved and the conditions of the battle changed. The Smith/Neo battle stay the same after the first dozen Smith's popped out.
Also when did the agents become such a bunch of wimps. All these rebel programs and human inflitrators and they act like the keystone kops. (I know there is a likely reasons, but still)",1060041600,24,1223,4.828571428571428
1468721,4,B00005JLTN,"Not having viewed the first ""Matrix"" film, I had to evaluate this film on its own merits ... which is a good thing, because as I had no basis of comparison, I enjoyed the stunning visual effects and futuristic fantasy concepts without preconceived notions. However, *now* having viewed the original ""Matrix"", I can see a few flaws in this sequel. Overall, it is the stunning visual effects that are most memorable: fantastic flying scenes, artistic kung fu & ju jitsu fights, acrobatic leaps including walking on walls and ceilings, photographic views of the gears and machines which keep the underground city of Zion functioning. The most important reason for the film's success is the original creative concept of humans entering the computer program called ""the Matrix"" ... to beat it at its own game, i.e. to alter or change it. This idea *alone* makes the film a block-buster at the box office. The inclusion of martial arts and spirituality add further to the intrigue and mystery of the story line ...

Unfortunately, the sequel lacked the depth  of the original theme: Neo discovering ""who he is"", ""finding his own path"" and realizing he is ""the One"" who will challenge and possibly ovecome the Matrix program. The build-up to his decision to seek information from the Oracle was nicely done but the actual meeting was a let down. Another minus to the film is the deliberatley prolonged fight scene with the Agents named Smith. It detracted from the impressive and artistic merits of the martial arts fighting. The car chase scene with the Evil Twins on the highway was also lengthy and too exaggerated . There were missed opportunities to film stunning views of the mountains and valleys of Switzterland, personally I think Neo & Trinity arrived at the Swiss castle looking for the key-maker way too soon ... a more meandering route could have been built up with a creative climax. Also, they found the dungeon in the castle where he was locked up too easily. One intriguing twist in the plot could have been to develop a romantic interlude between Neo & the French mistress of the ""god-father"". The writers of the film could have explored Trinity's ability to deal spiritually with a ""love triangle"". The ""party scene"" after Morpheus' speech to the humans seemed rather primitive. It appeared to trivialize the seriousness of the impending invasion by the machines.

Overall, the sequel was good but left *this* viewer feeling the film was hyped up too much. No doubt the Matrix trilogy will change how films are made in the future but it should never be forgotten that technical merit does not replace important themes in a story. Place equal emphasis on *both* and I will gladly see the third film in this series. Erika Borsos (erikab93)",1060041600,53,2749,4.869658119658119

This movie is very fun to watch! Yes, there are a couple long scenes that seem useless, but the directors put them there for a reason. As a whole, Matrix Reloaded is spectacular.
This movie is far better than the first in that it has a lot more action, a much more complex story, and altogether a more exciting movie watching experience.
I bought my first DVD player when the first Matrix came out, and I think Matrix Reloaded should be a good reason to buy a big Home Theater System (I recommend the Sony ones, I have one, and it rocks!).
I can't wait to pop this DVD in, and have a very exciting movie watching experience with full volume.
Can't wait for Matrix Revolutions!
Here's a tip to aid in the better understanding of the Matrix Trilogy. Watch Animatrix, this little DVD packs a lot of information, and gives a nice introduction into the fantastic world of Anime. Matrix is inspired in anime, so if you don't get anime, chances are you might not enjoy this type of movie as much.

what i liked about the matrix reloaded is that it is just like reading a comic book or watching a cool anime. both of the wachowski brothers are fans of comics and anime and i believe what they set out to do was make a movie that was just like a comic book or an anime. they are the only ones to have ever done that (so far). the similarities between the matrix movies and anime are numerous: camera angles, the speed of the action, the pauses in the action, etc. even the storyline seems to be very influenced by alot of anime such as ghost in the machine.
the martial arts in this movie are top notch. anyone who knows anything about martial arts knows that yuen wo ping is one of the finest choreographers in the business. with every passing movie i have seen of yuen wo ping, i have witnessed his martial arts choreography exponentially improve. his are among the best kung fu movies ever; fist of legend, legend of drunken master, iron monkey, crouching tiger.
this movie really has it all!
great yuen wo ping kung fu - check!
awesome anime style - check!
flying characters - check!
great special effects - do i have to say anything about that?
great storyline - check! (i don't care what anyone says about the storyline, i thought it was an excellent story with more plot twists than i expected) i can imagine how hard it is to come up with a story to follow the first matrix but as i was watching the movie, i didn't care one bit about the story. in fact, all i really wanted to see was action. as far as i'm concerned, they could have completely done away with any semblence of a story and just had 2 hours of action.
alot of the best kung fu movies have very weak storylines. the action is what makes a good kung fu movie becouse the japanese and chinese know that action speaks volumes, a lesson most americans have yet to learn when it comes to film. i know i'm turning japanese (or at least i can admit it).",1059696000,,2328,4.341743119266055

1468761,4,B00005JLTN,"The Matrix Reloaded is a good film, let no-one dissuade you, but it has detractors, and for good reason. Many people who saw this film didn't see in it what they might have expected, based on what the got with the first film. ""More of the same"" is one possibility that these people may have had in mind, but that doesn't mean that the film on the whole should be avoided, just taken with the proverbial grain of salt. Some key points:
1] The ""Zion rave"" is probably the one big reason so many people hate this film. True, it's rather unnecessary, but at least it doesn't last too long.
2] As with the Japanese anime .hack, the current section of the Matrix series is a multimedia experience. There are plot points and characters you simply will not find acceptable unless you immerse yourself in the saga. To that end, you will get more out of the story if you see ""Final Flight of the Osiris"" and ""Kid's Story"" on the Animatrix DVD, and perhaps play the Enter the Matrix videogame, as all of these things introduce plot elements that tie into the main story. (Speaking of the Kid: many people complain about his presence too, but he's actually not in the film long enough to make that much of a difference.)
3] The philosophy of the series may become harder and harder to swallow as things go along, but it is good to have a film that challenges some part of your intelligence and actually gets you to think a little. Action is not the be-all-end-all of this storyline.
4] I've noted those who mention the inconsistencies in the clothing of the dwellers of Zion, but this too is minor. At least there's a sign that they actually have a textile operation down there. And that they wear sunglasses all the time in the Matrix is merely the Wachowski brothers' fashion statement.
Despite points like these and others, you shouldn't keep yourself from seeing The Matrix Reloaded if you already saw the first film. ""Free your mind"", as the line goes. And if you can, see this film in IMAX; it's big and good, despite the fact that it's not in true IMAX format (more like a letterboxed image on a regular TV screen, even if it is much bigger).

1468763,1,B00005JLTN,"The premise behind the Matrix-machines using humans as batteries- is extremely silly. ~takes deep breath~... In reality, each human doesn't even generate enough electrical charge in a whole year to keep a light bulb lit. I'm assuming machines would be smart enough to realize this, and hating humans as much as the AI tried to convey, the machines would simply rid the planet of all these stupid, inefficient life forms and get on with...ummm...whatever...  And if humans retaliated by blocking the sun to try to stop them, the so-called original energy source of the machines, again, the machines would be smart enough to use their last bit of energy to send solar collectors into orbit, and whatever other machines they could get up there, and simply continue on with their campaign of killing off the stinking human menace. But I was willing to forego the unbelievability of that with the first Matrix movie and just sit back and be entertained. It was fun to watch. But in Matrix Reloaded we find just how stupid the AI really is.  Not only is there a ""bad"" AI, there is now a ""good"" AI.  But the good AI is too dumb to correct the obviously flawed construct, Neo, it has created to save mankind from jumping around in muddy puddles in an orgy of jungle madness,(good lord, save me from this future!).  Instead, it continues to allow Neo to ""reload"" and ""reload"" and ""reload"" the Matrix, ad nauseum, (I'm assuming this is the reason for the name of this film), because Neo would rather save his girlfriend construct than the whole human race....duh.  Hmmm...maybe these stupid machines deserve their fate of trying to glean energy from humans afterall.  I suppose the reason I'm being sooo picky with this second film is the fact that this one was just plain boring.  It was one set-up after another so we could watch Neo fight in special-effects limbo and, ugh...so the Wachowski brothers could stuff their irritating philosophies about what's-wrong-with-YOUR-society and what's-right-about-OUR-ways-to-correct-it, down our collective throats.

1468764,5,B00005JLTN,"the one explained
""the one"" is a program, but has to be ""attached"" to someone in the matrix. so mr. anderson got it in the 6th version of the matrix. then ""the one"" program's purpose is to allow zion to be destroyed then to rebuild it. the reason for this is because of anomalies - the 1% of humans that don't accept the matrix. these are all brought out of the matrix program and into the zion program by the ""morpheus"" program and other
similar ""ship captain"" programs. then once all the anomalies are out of the matrix (and in zion), that is the time for zion to be destroyed, thus killing all the anomalies off. the matrix is then upgraded, thus creating the next version of the
matrix, but zion must be rebuilt so that the next lot of anomalies can be brought out again so that they can be destroyed. this is the feedback-loop, and is the reason to retain a handful of people so that zion can be rebuilt. so this is why neo said the prophecy was a lie - the one's purpose was not to end the war as the prophecy stated. unfortunately, ""the one"" program must be re-used each time, or copied, so it can be ""attached"" to a new anomaly inside the matrix. so what happens to the old ""the one"" program? it faces deletion, and as the oracle explained, it goes into exile instead, just like the french bloke (the merovingian) did. he was the first one (probably from the second version of the matrix), and once he fulfilled his duty, he became an exile program and ""abdicated"" his ""oneness"" by choosing persephone and power. this is evident in the bogs when persephone asks neo to kiss her. she says she wants
him to kiss her so she can feel what it is like again to be kissed by something close to human, just like the merovingian used to be. then she says to trinity that she
envies her, but that these things are not meant to last. so the merovingian used to be just like neo - a one - thus proving further the feedback-loop explained earlier.",1059523200,18,1942,4.308743169398907

My point is that, like the Matrix, there is enough ""story behind story"" to make this film fun to watch over and over and over. You will notice new things every time. Reloaded has action like never seen before in a movie but the real enjoyment is the mental exercise that you will get in deciphering all the plot elements and trying to figure out where the story is going and where it's been and how the messages might relate to your own (and OUR own) existence.
It seems to me that those who hate the movie just don't enjoy the unanswered questions. Don't expect to be spoon-fed your story. There is no.... well, YOU get the picture.
For those unfamiliar with the movie, don't dismiss it as just an action movie. If you ever pondered any of life philosophical questions this will rekindle your interest. (Just make sure to watch The Matrix first. Several times.)
Also note that this movie is not conclusive. It ends mid-story with a bit of a cliff hanger. That's not a bad thing since it gives fans time to digest and discuss it. To be concluded with the release of ""Revolutions"" in November. Bravo to WB for not making us wait until 2004.
Seeing Reloaded twice just wasn't enough. I look forward to the DVD not just for the extras but the ability to watch it again and again.",1059436800,3,1624,4.327868852459017
