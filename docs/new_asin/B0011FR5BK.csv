3065365,5,B0011FR5BK,"I now do this routine almost everyday. It uses selected stretching routines seen in other Classic Stretch and Essentric workouts but Miranda has chosen ones that suit the specific men 'things'. This got me back on track with my shoulder/trapezius stretches that my doctor recommend for my neck. Though it works/stretches the full body, it is not a 'workout' video so you need to add on something else for the workout part.",1420848000,14,422,4.875

3065369,5,B0011FR5BK,"I discovered Miranda while visiting relatives in Indiana; they were still showing it on PBS. I bought a 2-disk set and liked it so much I bought Season 9 (4 disks). I am 83 and my scoliosis qujite painful.  I was told I would have to have 3 surgeries (front, back and side), but I noticed that when I did Miranda's stretches I took fewer pain pills and the relief lasted all day.  I glue my eyes to the TV so that I get the right position, and I agree that sometimes this is awkward, but it is well worth twisting my head.  I have done the stretches daily for over a year, and I find that if I really work I am set for the day and do not have to wear my brace unless I am doing a huge amount of bending (dishes, laundry) or standing for extended periods of time.  Recently, after viewing my x-rays and testing me, an orthopaedist and a neurosurgeon both told me I had found the answer and they would not recommend surgery or shots at this time.  The neurosurgeon said, ""You have evidently found the answer: get a second set so you never have to risk being without it!  Really. I still cannot do all the moves, but there is still enough variety to be useful.",1396224000,51,1157,4.142857142857143

3065371,1,B0011FR5BK,"Much to my dismay, the video contains ads. I resent purchasing something and then being flashed an ad. If they were ads for another of her workout videos, I probably would not have a problem, but that is not the case. I find it unacceptable that anyone would try to make more money selling ad time on a workout video that is for sale.",1362614400,62,334,4.234375

It doesn't have any chapters so it is a bit long.  I thought my husband might like it because it shows a GUY doing the exercises,  ah well.",1435363200,3,286,4.1454545454545455

8241757,4,B0011FR5BK,"The editing on the dvd could be better on some of the camera angles showing  Ms. Esmond-White demonstrating the poses and movements.  Some explanations seemed vague to me.  This slowed me down as I was learning the routines. I got it eventually, though.  Other than that, the workouts are effective.  Effective but also gentle and quite relaxing.",1426550400,3,346,5.0
