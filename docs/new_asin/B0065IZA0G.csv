4960408,5,B0065IZA0G,"Sooo excited! ... Not really a review I know, but I just wanted to let the ""re-leasers"" know how gleeful I am!  Probably going to write the same review for DM the Movie collection!  Yippee!",1325030400,13,189,4.371428571428571
4960409,5,B0065IZA0G,"Father Dowling Mysteries was a brilliant, original, intelligently written, and super enjoyable mystery series starring Tom Bosley (most notably for some as Mr. Cunningham on Happy Days), Tracy Nelson (daughter of famed 60's rock singer Ricky Nelson, also the sister of Gunnar and Matthew Nelson of late 80's early 90's hair band Nelson), and Mary Wickes (notably from the feature films ""Sister Act"" and ""Sister Act 2: Back In The Habit"" as Sister Mary Lazarus).

Bosley plays Father Frank Dowling, the priest of a Chicago parish who runs around the windy city with his right-hand streetwise nun, Sister Stephanie ""Steve"" Oskowski (played by Nelson), solving murders, much in the tradition of ""Murder, She Wrote"" and ""Diagnosis Murder"".  Father Dowling and Sister Steve are supported by housekeeper Marie (portrayed by Mary Wickes). Father Dowling and Sister Steve investigate murders, and in the tradition of the aforemention ""Murder, She Wrote"", outsmarting the police and criminals themselves while uncovering deeper hidden clues that the police overlook.

This series started in January 1989 with a total of 8 episodes in its first season.  The series was launched by a tv-movie called ""Fatal Confession: A Father Dowling Mystery"" which aired in 1987.  The show was not given its proper due as it ended in 1991 at the end of its third season.  I hope that the tv-movie that started it all will be included in this release.  The phrase ""they don't make shows like this anymore"" is absolutely true about high caliber shows like this one.

If you miss the days when shows weren't hyper-sexualized, when mysteries were solved without grotesque gore, vulgar language, and toilet humor, if you miss the days when tv used to have substance, then you will LOVE ""Father Dowling Mysteries"".  If you are a fan of ""Murder, She Wrote"" and ""Diagnosis Murder"", then you will LOVE ""Father Dowling Mysteries"".  Father Dowling and Sister Steve solve crimes with some pluck, determination, intelligence, and heavenly guidance.  This show will give you something to believe in.",1324944000,242,2060,5.156156156156156
4960410,5,B0065IZA0G,I have really enjoyed this series.  It ranks up there with Murder She Wrote and Diagnosis Murder.  My VCR tapes are about worn out.  This is a real good series and I hope they release them all.  They are that good.,1324080000,64,214,4.146341463414634
4960411,2,B0065IZA0G,"I watched this show as a kid, when I was a practicing Catholic. I was thinking of pre-ordering this, but quite frankly, I don't want the estate of the original author (Ralph MckInerny) to get any money. The man was a loud mouthed homophobe who loved to cram religion down other's throats. Go search it out. All the evils of the world are by women, Obama, and gay people, or by Catholics who try to take a more liberal stance on the world and the people in it. No separation of church and state from this guy.",1323993600,20,508,4.247422680412371
4960412,5,B0065IZA0G,"Father Dowling was a great/fun watch when it first aired in the late 80s, and while the picture may have a bit of age to it, the stories and characters are as good now as they were originally, the episodes are as much fun to watch as ever.

I was intrigued to read in an Obituary of Ralph McInerny on Telegraph. Co. Uk:

McInerny fashioned Dowling as a spiritual heir to GK Chesterton's Father Brown, compassionate but not entirely worldly. ""His secular interest in crime,"" noted one critic, ""is merely a mask for his deeper concern for the spiritual welfare of the victims and criminals involved.""

I began to understand, through that line, why I had enjoyed Father Dowling so much, and how I had felt so ""at home"" and ""at ease"" when I discovered Father Brown.",1487980800,3,761,4.54014598540146

4960480,5,B0065IZA0G,"a well done mystery series, even if it didn't last that long.  Is set in Chicago with nice representation of the city.",1384560000,,118,4.363636363636363
4960481,5,B0065IZA0G,"This 1989-1991 (with a 1987 pilot episode) murder mystery show is just dynamite, mixing far-fetched fantasy (really, how many priests uncover gun smuggling and mafia plots among their parishioners??) with gritty realism (cops and other extras/props appear pulled from the Chicago streets) in a very satisfying blend of entertainment, remaining faithful in this formula to the style of Notre Dame professor Ralph McInerny's original paperback detective stories. The show has a dark tone (often presenting mature themes and physical peril for its leads) while remaining family friendly, a rarity for television. It charms the viewer by allowing one to root for its protagonists as decent people, rather than presenting us with the nihilistic or neurotic anti-heroes we find on most police procedural shows now airing on TV. Full disclosure: When I saw parts of this series on TV as a kid, I didn't find it terribly exciting, but I'm loving every minute of it on DVD now that I'm able to appreciate the clever dialogue, even though I'm probably younger (33) than its target audience. This first season aired on NBC before moving to ABC for its last two seasons, also available now on DVD, but the show is the same thing from both networks. Some things that make it a wonderful show:

1.) Authentic Chicago locations from the days before filmmakers started using Toronto to double for the Windy City, avoiding Mayor Daley's high costs for filming rights. Locations here include everything from Lake Shore Drive to the Stockyards. If you've ever visited or lived in Chicago, you'll be surprised at how many times you'll say ""I've been there"" while watching this show, even though it's 25 years old.

2.) A great cast featuring Tom Bosley (""Happy Days"") as Father Dowling, a Catholic parish priest who solves murder mysteries, in an effortless performance made all the more remarkable by the fact that Bosley is both a native Chicagoan and Jewish rather than Catholic. He underplays the role with a deceptive geniality, getting serious when necessary, but never losing a sense of fun in solving the mysteries. Then there is Tracy Nelson as the cheerfully implausible ""Sister Steve,"" his sidekick in unraveling the mysteries. Looking back at this show in 2013, Nelson feels particularly odd as the reformed petty criminal-turned-nun who is so close to the pastor that she calls him by his first name and sometimes sleeps on his couch, spending more time with him than in her own convent. But the innocence and pluck of Nelson's character are charming in just the right way: Sister Stephanie is a ""naughty nun"" insofar as she picks locks and mixes drinks like a pro, but her character's quality of naive worldliness works perfectly as a Watson-like foil to the Holmes that is Father Dowling, and the mystery plots themselves are so imaginative that one rarely feels inclined during a show to deconstruct her character's credibility. Mary Wickes (""Sister Act"") is surprisingly touching as Father Dowling's scowling housekeeper Marie, who cares for him more than her external actions let on, and the actors playing recurring characters (like the gently paternal bishop, hapless young assistant pastor, and various police allies) are all delightful in their characterizations.

3.) Great dialogue. This is a more cerebral TV series than many action-driven police procedural shows, making it more like the ""Star Trek"" than ""Star Wars"" of detective fiction, but the dialogue is effortless in a way that advances the plot and endears you to the characters without ever drawing attention to itself. Characterizations of good-hearted Father Dowling, clever Sister Steve, hapless Father Prestwick, tart Marie, and the scandalized bishop are memorable and never dull. It's some of the funniest and most touching writing that you will find on any TV show from these years.

4.) Solid guest stars, including Leslie Nielson in the TV pilot movie that opens disc one of this two-disc set. Great acting and character interaction all around on this one. Overall, this show comes across as so far-fetched that one can only take it as pure fantasy, but it's a fantasy presented realistically enough that you care about the main characters while enjoying their adventures. A few of the guest stars are generic TV players, but everyone seems to be having fun on the show, which makes it fun to watch.

 There's no way to possibly take the basic ""priest detective"" premise of these stories seriously, but that's part of their charm, as they are meant to be enjoyed as pure escapism. Every episode is original and creative, refreshingly lacking in the formulaic boredom of ""CSI"" and other generic procedurals on TV today. This show is the rare murder mystery that is actually fun to watch.",1384300800,4,4759,5.063775510204081
4960482,5,B0065IZA0G,"We love Father Dowling, but mainly we love Sister Steve.  Can't go wrong with these episodes.

4960520,5,B0065IZA0G,"I did not consistently watch the Father Dowling Mysteries when this program had its original tv run and this DVD has made me realize what I missed. This is, hands down, one of the best television series I have ever viewed and I would give it an even greater than 5 star-rating if I could!

Tom Bosley is simply superb as the lovable and clever Father Frank Dowling. I recognized this actor as a talented comedian from Happy Days but had no idea he was such a gifted dramatic actor, as well. He is tremendously natural and unaffected which makes him completely believable in his role. Tom Bosley makes you realize how great the actors of the past were and that we have, in my opinion, no one of comparable talent now. Mr. Bosley has the completely natural grace that old-time greats like Bogart and Tracy had, such that enables him to completely inhabit his character.

Tracy Nelson is very nearly as good in her role as Father Dowling's devoted protege, Sister Steve. Ms. Nelson is really wonderful in this role, very likeable and convincing, and she and Mr. Bosley have a delightful chemistry together. They have an endearing relationship that is more father-daughter and best buddies than mere colleagues.

The great character actress Mary Wickes adds further flavor to the dish in her role as the rectory's longsuffering housekeeper, Marie, who is constantly befuddled and impatient with the amateur sleuthing Father Frank and Sister Steve are always getting involved in.

In short, these are the sorts of characters that seem more like friends whom you cannot wait to sit down and spend another evening with. The plots are fast-moving, with many unexpected twists and surprises, and the guest actors (like the great Sada Thompson who is masterful in a surprising role for her given most of us remember her as the surburban mom from Family) seem to turn in high-quality work. Perhaps they are ""inspired"" by Father Frank and Sister Steve!

Although the mysteries are set in the Catholic Church with a priest and a nun, it is not religious and does not push the Bible (for those who are offended by such things).

Some of the plots seem a bit stretched or incomplete and even perhaps simple-minded when viewing the TV productions in a fresh light.

I thought it was a good choice to ensure it be uncommon enough not to be something that is on all the store racks and he wouldn't already have it. We have watched some of them together and they were enjoyable.
I placed my order at the beginning of December and waited and waited checking the tracking which said it was out for delivery every day. When I finally got through to my post office on December 21 they said it must be lost or stolen off the delivery truck. I then contacted Amazon via live chat and explained the situation.

I've long been a fan of Tracy Nelson and have missed seeing her acting in recent years, so for several reasons I ordered this DVD.  It's a throwback to gentler television when we didn't need to see so much explicit violence, didn't have to see fairly implicit sex scenes, didn't have to hear swear words every other sentence.  Just clean fun, if you can consider it fun when there is a murder here and there.  I enjoyed this first season DVD and am looking forward to Season 2.",1356998400,2,551,4.372549019607843

4960575,4,B0065IZA0G,"As one of the writers of the first season of Father Dowling, it was truly gratifying to read the Customer Review Section and discover how much the series was, and continues to be, appreciated by its fans.
  I wrote The Man Who Came To Dinner Mystery episode.  The guest star who played Sister Steve's lost love in that episode was William R. Moses and he and Tracy Nelson were married at the time.  As it happened, I'd written for him before since he also starred in Falcon Crest and I wrote many episodes of that series as well.
  With Father Dowling, in addition to having the privilege of writing for the wonderful Tom Bosley and the incomparable Mary Wickes, mine was the episode which also featured Harriet Nelson, of the iconic The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet series.  It turned out to be her last theatrical appearance and she was able to share it with her granddaughter, Tracy.
  I'm very happy that fans of Father Dowling are able to enjoy it again.  I only wish the quality of the transfer and the DVD packaging reflected the fact that those of us who worked on the show always tried to give the audience the best experience possible.
Sincerely,

We need more wholesome good tv series like Father Dowling Mysteries, Charlie Angels, Matlock, Perry Mason, Ironside, etc.  I love these old time tv series because it taught a lesson and did it in a way that wasn't so negative.  You don't see all that fighting, bullying, cursing, etc, which our young people think is so cool today because we have these other tv reality shows that portray this and our young people think this is the way to live and act.  This is false and I think we need to get those type of shows off television and show more of the Father Dowling, Matlock, Charlie Angels, etc.  The good old time tv series.",1342224000,2,913,4.366863905325443

I bought the 1st season and (20+ years later)find my perspective has changed. This show focuses on the seamier side of human nature. Oh, there's no blood and gore--thank goodness!--but watching the depraved side of man thru one and two hour movies doesn't excite me. I enjoy Murder She Wrote, Charlie's Angels (the old shows), Simon and Simon and especially Scarecrow and Mrs. King! They are very similar but have a ""lighter"" tone to them. There are also fewer episodes, I believe only 8 compared to other TV shows where a season has 24 or more episodes.

The Series includes the Pilot Episode which is a must have for those unfamiliar with the Series and every episode appears to have been digitally remastered or taken from original tape source because they are crystal-clear viewing. As a result of this pleasure I went and sought out the books by Ralph McInery and found out they are scarcer than the television show! I highly recommend this program for families who are tired of the stuff on television today. Good Moral Lessons without sounding preachy and enough action to hold the interest of younger children.

Even when I remember all the details of an episode, I watch with a smile on my face and a sense of deep contentment.

It's probably the chemistry among the main characters that makes this show so great for me but Sister Steve all by herself could make the show worth watching.

I could count on both shows for an hour of decent entertainment with likable characters, (mostly) solid writing and pleasant casts.

The Father Dowling Mysteries didn't enjoy the long run of Murder, She Wrote and the wait for it to come to DVD has been considerably longer. Unfortunately, now that it's finally been released, the quality of the DVDs isn't what I had hoped it would be. I knew I wasn't going to get Blu-ray quality, but I expected the episodes to look a little better than they did on my VHS tapes when they were newly recorded and they just - don't. Not really. A couple of the episodes (The Missing Body Mystery, for instance) look overly dark and a bit muddy in places and even have some odd moments where the picture jerks a little. (Forgive my techy-talk.)

Aside from a promo for each episode - ""Next on the Father Dowling Mysteries..."" (which are of even poorer quality than the episodes) - there are no extras. There are, however, English subtitles.

The case is just as bare-bones as the DVDs. A brief synopsis of each episode is included, but it's printed on the reverse side of the case art. That means that, unless you remove the insert from the case, you're reading the synopsis text through the plastic and some of it is obscured by the doohickies that hold the discs in place.

While I was disappointed in the quality of the DVD and the packaging, I really enjoyed spending time with Father Dowling (Tom Bosley) and Sister Steve (Tracy Nelson) again and was quickly reminded of how much Mary Wickes as the housekeeper, Marie, added to the series.

Included in this 2-disc set is ""Fatal Confession"", the original television pilot which aired in November of 1987, in which Father Dowling and Sister Steve investigate the apparent suicide of a former parishioner.
The set also includes all episodes from the first season:
* The Missing Body Mystery (2-hour episode) - After a man dies in the confessional, his body disappears, only to turn up across town. The investigation leads to a confrontation with the FBI.
* What Do You Call a Call Girl Mystery - Three powerful men are suspects in the murder of a prostitute.
* The Man Who Came to Dinner Mystery - Star Tracy Nelson's real-life grandmother, Harriet (from Ozzie & Harriet fame) and her then-husband William R. Moses guest star in an episode where Moses has witnessed a murder and is now being hunted by the murderers.
* The Mafia Priest Mystery (parts 1 & 2) - When a fellow priest, who has family ties to the mob, is accused of murder, Father Dowling tries to prove his innocence.
* The Face in the Mirror Mystery: When Father Dowling's no-good half-brother (also played by Bosley) turns up, Frank is able to thwart his attempted crime, but their resemblance to one another causes trouble.
* The Pretty Baby Mystery: After a baby is left at the rectory, Father Dowling and Sister Steve try to help the mother, whose life is in danger.

The Father Dowling Mysteries was a good series with an appealing cast. I'm glad it has finally come to DVD. But, IMHO, the poor quality of this release doesn't do the series justice, which is a darn shame. I hope that seasons 2 & 3 are created with a closer eye to quality.",1328572800,30,3475,4.578778135048232
4960618,5,B0065IZA0G,"Finally this is on dvd. Prior to this the only way to get it on dvd was a very bad bootlegged copy. I haven't seen this yet, but since its the official release, hopefully the picture is much clearer. I grew up watching this series. True, the series was nothing like the book, but it had to have done some good since the author continued to write the books well into the late 2000's. A decade after the show went off air.  Its a shame the series was only on for three years. This was very much in the same vain as Murder She Wrote, Columbo, or Diagnosis Murder. Hopefully This is only the beginning. If this sells well, then the other seasons should be released on dvd. If you haven't seen this and are a fan of the type of mystery shows listed above, I'd recommend giving it a try out.",1328400000,13,785,4.1644736842105265
4960619,5,B0065IZA0G,"I have been waiting for what seems like forever for The Father Dowling series to be released. I have preordered Hazel Season 2 as well. These shows were so enjoyable and I look forward to watching them again. Shows the whole family can watch together and not be embarassed.  Also Jerry Lewis movies are being released this month, ones I didn't think would ever be released. Looks like a great month for tv.",1328227200,5,406,4.561643835616438
4960620,5,B0065IZA0G,"Like many others I have been waiting for this program to be released on DVD.  I have almost worn out the few episodes I recorded on VHS back 20+ years ago.  The program is interesting, well written and is something I can share with my family.  This program also features four of some of my most favorite movie and television actors: Tom Bosley, Tracy Nelson, Mary Wickes, and James Stephens.  I look forward to all the episodes being released on DVD, for I will surely buy them.",1327104000,7,478,4.459770114942529

I grew up with this one and have waited a veery long time for it to come out on DVD. They have a great cast that plays well off of one another and it is a fun, family friendly show. I am definitely ordering this! Hopefully the rest of the series will be soon to follow.",1326931200,13,442,4.273809523809524

4960623,5,B0065IZA0G,"I love Tom Bosley and Mary Wickes and have many of her movies that I purchased from Amazon.  I have waited a long time for this to be released and to think that this and the second season of Hazel are both being released in February is almost more than I can believe.  I have pre-ordered both series and will devour them when they arrive.

The person who wrote the negative review slamming this TV Show because if its religious nature sounds like they maybe suffering from a severe case of HolyBibleoPhobia and  Godophobia.
