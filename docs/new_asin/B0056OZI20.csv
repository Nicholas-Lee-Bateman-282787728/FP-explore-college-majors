4592776,4,B0056OZI20,"This one kinda surprised me. I expected a shoddy ""made for tv"" type western, but this turned out to be much better than that. Well put together with some interesting characters. The plot is pretty standard for a western, so don't expect anything mind-blowing there, but its well worth a watch and will keep you entertained. If you are a western fan and looking for a decent modern movie, this isn't a bad one for your collection, especially at the low price it seems to stay at on Amazon.",1370908800,4,488,4.49438202247191

4592778,5,B0056OZI20,"This is the perfect gift for a dad that is crazy about westerns.  It has all the elements of a great ""shout-em up"" film and for a very discounted price.  Personally I had no idea this even existed but my western guru dad request it and believe me, it did not disappoint.",1337385600,,270,4.173076923076923
4592779,3,B0056OZI20,"I took a shot on this one as I do love good westerns. And for the most part I can say I enjoyed the film. It tends to use a lot of western clichs. For example, the good guy is a stranger who ends up helping a family in distress against huge odds, the bad guy tends to wear black and is pure evil. The good guys always hit what they shoot at, the bad guys usually JUST miss, and of course there is the preverbal saloon whore with a heart of gold who is in danger. Basic stuff to say the least. But there are a few twists as well. The sexy female gunslinger for one, played by Veronica Diaz, adds spice to the plot.

The movie itself has a good flow and solid character development. Overall I enjoyed the film, at least until the final confrontation. At that point the film just got silly. It features a chase scene with the bad guy chasing a stagecoach with the good guy chasing him. Not quite sure what the bad guy has in mind as he's out of bullets and completely outnumbered. But instead of an explosive finale we get one that kind of fizzles. The movie ends with a quick 'feel-good' scene set two years in the future.

Again, overall I liked the film as it has many of the qualities that make up a good western. I just wish the ending was better. I would recommend the film as a good escape flick for those nights where you have nothing better to do.",1322784000,5,1353,4.10188679245283
4592780,2,B0056OZI20,"Whoever wrote this saw one too many episodes of Deadwood because it has more F-words in the first scene than what you might hear in a gangster movie. The action scenes feature cuts between every punch and there are lots of weird pauses during conversations. You'll probably hear a lot of complaints about the editing and direction on this one. In the end, it's pretty forgettable. You can watch it streaming on Netflix if you want to check it out right now, though.",1321833600,8,465,4.614457831325301
4592781,4,B0056OZI20,"This is a new western... will it go down as a classic -- no.  But, I have seen those classic westerns, know their plots inside out and this is a decent recent film that certainly does justice to those famous western good/evil conflicts.  It is not entirely unpredictable, but who thought John Wayne wasn't going to ride off into the sunset?",1320192000,,340,4.557377049180328
4592782,2,B0056OZI20,"""If you had been under my command I'd have had you hung. I will never pay you a cent for protection."" Travis McCain (Shockley) has taken over the town of Dead River and the people are living in fear. When Cole Brandt (Walker) comes in to town looking for revenge for the murderer of his wife and child he finds someone that needs to be taken care of. This is a movie where the plot and idea is much better then the movie was. While it had some really good scenes and action, it was just much, much to slow moving and hard to get into. The acting was not bad and it was decently made, it was just really tough to get into. If you are a hardcore western fan this till appeal to you, if you like an occasional one it would be better to go find a different one. Overall, not a bad movie just way to slow to fully keep you interested for the entire time. I give it a C-.

Would I watch again? - I barely made it through once. No",1313884800,3,923,3.935828877005348

4592786,3,B0056OZI20,"William Shockley as Travis McCain looks an awful lot like Clancy Brown in his role as Brother Justin Crowe in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Carnivle/dp/B0002YLC1U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Carnivle</a>.  As head bad guy of Dead River, McCain does his best to make the lives of the townsfolk miserable.

Through some uncanny inability for most of McCain's cronies to shoot straight, bounty hunter Cole Brandt, played almost convincingly by Quebcois Andrew W. Walker, comes back to be the town's deputy.  Peter Coyote's screen time is laughable considering his name placement for the film's cast.

F-words needlessly fly faster from the mouths of the cast than corn through goose in some of the most clichd and tiresome dialog in any Western in a long time.

One highpoint was the appearance and disappearance of whiplash marks from the back of Dulce de la Rosa (Veronica Diaz/Milagros) between various scenes.

Spend a little more time and watch&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hidalgo/dp/B003SI7O0U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hidalgo</a>&nbsp;if you're in the mood for a horse opera.",1399766400,5,1172,6.386075949367089
4592787,2,B0056OZI20,"""The Gundown"" was a disappointment.  The cinematography was well done.  The sets and the horses and the scenery seemed appropriate to the time period.

The extremely heavy use of profanity ruined the dialogue for me.  I also found the action and acting to be sporadic, some was okay but some was really bad.  Peter Coyote was good, but his part in the film was smaller than I expected.",1398902400,3,385,4.602941176470588

4592790,3,B0056OZI20,"Yep, started out like a real gem ... but then, about half way through it turned into one of those soppy Lifetime Movie Network (LMN). westerns, but still pretty good. Peter Coyote is listed in the credits as one of the stars but he is actually only in the first 5 minutes of the movie. Too bad to, he looked like a great character for this movie. The woman desperado/gunslinger was a little much tho. I liked it enough to buy it ... used, for just a few pennies. But I streamed it first on Netflix to check it out.",1391472000,,514,4.15
