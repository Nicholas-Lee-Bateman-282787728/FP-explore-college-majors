5853896,4,B00DSVAVVG,"The film is in Tagalog (Filipino) with English subtitles and though there is adequate time to read them, if you do not like foreign subtitled movies this one would not be for you. The story is a pretty simple and all too typical one. An attractive young girl (Ditas/Melody) is taken, by her mother, to work in a brothel. She is told that she will be treated like family. The house is run by a Madam who employs two young male ""pimps"" to supervise and transport the girls. One falls in love with Melody and she with him. Melody also is in school and one of her classmates takes an interest in her. She is failing but her teacher assigns her extra credit. She is a virgin, so of course she is of interest to the governor. The language can be a little crude and there are brief moments of nudity, but within the context of the story and not graphic.

As someone who has traveled a lot and who has spent a significant amount of time with the natives of countries where young girls feel it their obligation to support their families, I must commend the filmmakers for their realistic portrayal of a prostitute's life. The majority of films on this subject are narrated documentaries which tend to be boring. This film documented the life and lifestyle without being so heavy handed. Suggest you invest 15-20 minutes. Within that time you will know if it is for you.",1519516800,11,1360,4.461847389558233
5853897,4,B00DSVAVVG,"This movie is in tagalog with English subtitles available. Its actually an interesting and poignant movie, showcasing the delicately balanced and surprisingly relatable lives that are lived out in a brothel in the Philippines. The balance is destroyed by a love story between one of the pimps and his prostitute, Unfortunately it shows all too well how sometimes we cannot escape our own lives no matter how we try.  The Brothel scenes are amusing and very humane. Theres a little bit of female nudity and partially shown sex but nothing gratuitous. The story is simple, and the acting is more that adequate. It feels very real.",1519430400,4,628,4.9245283018867925

8597328,2,B00DSVAVVG,"Too long for the plot.  Should have moved it along more quickly.  Also, it's listed as being in English but it sounded more like Tagalog to me.",1526169600,,143,4.2592592592592595
8597329,2,B00DSVAVVG,Movie could have been better than what it was. But for what it was it was ok. Would I recommend this movie no I have seen better low budget films.,1525478400,,146,3.9
8597330,1,B00DSVAVVG,"Personally, it was too long, too slow, and looks like it was filmed with a potato for a camera. Nobody and nothing in this movie looks like the cover.

If you like this style of filming and don't mind subtitles/Tagalog then there might be something here for you.",1524096000,3,262,4.458333333333333
8597331,1,B00DSVAVVG,"I switched from Netflix to Hulu because of the flood of foreign language low quality junk. It never shows the country of origin on the cover or even in description. The only clue is the cast names. I clicked on this necause there was none of the clues.
If prime video was psid service, I would cancel it. I just need prime for free shipping.",1523404800,2,341,4.2615384615384615
8597332,2,B00DSVAVVG,"Tries to be a lot of things and doesn't necessarily fail in trying, but doesn't do any of them well. It was combined of parts: coming-of-age, love story, (sometimes dramatic) female exploitation, and (sometimes comedic) documentary of the workers' daily lives. The director didn't focus enough on any of the narratives enough to make it a compelling movie.",1523145600,,356,5.155172413793103
8597333,5,B00DSVAVVG,Towards the end i thought dita was going to have her romantic get away with her man but no. The guy turned out to be the same crap. Overall i think this portrays the real events that occur as a sex worker in the Philippines.,1522108800,,224,4.0
8597334,3,B00DSVAVVG,"I enjoy watching films made outside of Hollywood because too many U.S. films today are slanted with the liberal or left-wing agendas.

Filipino movies have greatly improved in recent years, and this one from 2002 is proof of the same. I wish more recently released films from the Philippines were available.

While I do not speak Tagalog, this movie is so well-directed that I am able to discern most of the story anyway. Granted, that is a skill many do not possess. I have fun wit it, and watch foreign films as an exercise to develop that skill. Respect to our good friends in the Philippines.",1521936000,2,596,4.613207547169812
