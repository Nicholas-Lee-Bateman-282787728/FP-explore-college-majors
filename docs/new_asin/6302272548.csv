446525,5,6302272548,"This, the original The Vanishing (please, please, pass over the dumbed down 1993 US version by same director) is without doubt one of the most quietly chilling films of all time. Based on the novel The Golden Egg by  Tim Krabbe, this beautifully constructed little thriller has a glossily  calm, ultimately misleading, veneer around its bleak icy heart. The casting  is astounding, especially Donnadieu as the mild mannered, outwardly benign,  existential sociopath Lemorne (Jeff Bridges merely mugged his way through  his later role). Here we have true, dastardly intellect of an equal to that  of Dr. Hannibal Lecter.
The story itself is a study in efficiency. Two  young lovers whilst touring France stop off at a gas station. Saskia goes  into the store for some refreshments, Rex waits for her outside. Saskia  never returns. Over the next three years  Rex becomes obsessed by the  disappearance of his lover. What happened to Saskia?
The fractured time  structure preserves this central premise right up until the film's final  few frames (while the remake chose to unfold the story in strict  chronology, thus removing all that movie's sense of mystery and tension).  The answer that Rex seeks is one of those powerful cinema moments that are  impossible to forget.
Utterly bloodless yet profoundly disturbing.
This DVD has little to offer in the region of extras(Come on Criterion,  where are you when we need you?; is the Full Screen version (which no true  film buff should accept); has irremovable subtitles burned into the  film-stock, and the picture quality is decidedly grainy with more than its  fair share of detectable artifacts.

446577,5,6302272548,"SPOORLOOS (THE VANISHING) has been categorized as a horror / thriller / suspense movie for the most part. Having watched it many times over the years, I have come to the conclusion that it's a tragedy w/ a bleak atmosphere of building dread, and a horrific finale. This is a tale of love, tragic loss, obsession, and the maddening effects of the unknown. Young couple, Rex Hofman (Gene Bervoets) and Saskia Wagter (Johanna ter Steege) are on a holiday trip, when Saskia goes missing. This begins a three-year ordeal for Rex, who is completely consumed w/ solving the mystery. His entire life hinges on finding out what happened to Saskia, to the exclusion of all else. Enter Raymond Lemorne (Bernard-Pierre Donnadieu), who is shown as the prime suspect in Saskia's disappearance from the very beginning. Rex and Raymond are on a fateful collision course, driven by each man's particular obsession to ""know"". Much foreshadowing at the start of the film  -including Saskia's revealing of her greatest fear, a symbolic dream, and the couple's burying of a pair of coins- make the proceedings all the more heartbreaking,  and turn the sheer terror at the end, into an -almost- ""satisfying"" experience. Along the way, we also learn about what drives Lemorne, making him a far more nuanced, layered, ""villain"" character than most movies offer. While we may not be able to relate to his motives, we do gain understanding as to why he does what he does. SPOORLOOS is a masterpiece of darkness and sorrow. So, no, it's definitely NOT a popcorn movie! Highest recommendation...",1467504000,,1567,4.9543726235741445

446644,4,6302272548,"The Vanishing is a spellbinding suspense thriller based on the horror novella The Golden Egg by Tim Krabbe. Rex Hofman and Saskia Wagter star as a pair of Dutch lovers vacationing in France during the Tour de France. Saskia is terrified of the dark and suffers from recurring nightmares about being trapped in a golden egg floating alone in space forever. When their car runs out of gas on a dark road at night, Rex abandons Saskia but is relieved to see her the next morning in a bright patch of road at the end of a long tunnel. Their reunion is brief, however. At a stop at a gas station for cold drinks, Saskia disappears forever.

After setting up this mysterious disappearance, director George Sluizer introduces a new character, a mild-mannered university professor with a clinically diabolical mind, and interweaves his personal story into the mystery. Sluizer creates enormous atmosphere and uses lots of subjective camera shots to enhance tension. This is a solid thriller with some memorable characters and touches of Hitchcock throughout.

The film is in French and Dutch, with English subtitles. Blu-ray bonus features include  new interviews with director George Sluize and actor Johanna ter Steege, theatrical trailer, and a critical essay.",1417046400,2,1255,5.08252427184466

446696,5,6302272548,"A masterful, genuinely creepy thriller that holds up well, especially given Criterions superb Blu-Ray treatment.  Extras are limited to two interviews and a trailer, along with interesting liner notes. If you've only seen the director's American version, you haven't seen the movie. What's more, the more times you watch it, the more impressive the subtle artistry becomes.  Bernard-Pierre Donnadieu as the villain is every bit as scary as Johanna ter Steege is magical, despite the brevity of her role.",1416096000,2,503,5.3544303797468356
446697,4,6302272548,"The folks at Criterion have released another terrific film with the appropriate care we've become accustomed to.  Rex (Gene Bervoets) and Saskia (Johanna ter Steege) are a young Dutch couple madly in love.  They are taking a road trip to France to spend time at a remote county house.  When they stop for petrol, Saskia goes into the attached convenience store for soft drinks.  She never comes back.  Rex, at first nonplussed, becomes frantic when there is no trace of her.  He spends the next 24 hours looking for witnesses and information that could determine what happened.  Eventually the police are called but there is no sign of violence.  Three years have passed when the story resumes and Rex, although recently married, can't get Saskia's disappearance out of his mind.  He has become obsessed with what happened to her.  Each year he returns to the area, putting up missing person posters and making inquiries.

Another story has also emerged, that of the kidnapper himself.  Raymond Lemorne (Bernard-Pierre Donnadieu) is outed up front as the perpetrator, so there is no mystery as to the who, but why keeps you guessing until the final act.  Eventually Lemorne confronts Rex and admits he kidnapped Saskia.  After a less than violent attack on Lemorne, Rex is told that he will be provided with all the missing components but must accompany the creep back to the scene of the crime.  There isn't enough evidence to allow Rex to go immediately to the police so he goes along.

Director George Sluizer, working with a script by Tim Krabbe from his own novel, keeps the story in equal parts of Rex and Lemorne.  Lemorne, in fact is outwardly an academic, teaching science at a local university, a loving husband and father of two teen daughters - an interesting contradiction I thought.  He's also very creepy and an admitted sociopath.  At the same time, he seems pretty normal.  The final act and especially the final scene will likely stay with you for a while.  I remember seeing this for the first time years ago and being very uncomfortable.  It is one scary movie, if a bit overrated; yet isn't a horror movie.  It features fine performances from the 3 leads and is technically excellent.

And then there is the Criterion delivery of the Blu ray package.  The quality of the video is perfect.  I won't go into the usual detail but the color, clarity and detail are superb.  Here is some info provided by Criterion: ""This new digital transfer was created in 4K resolution on a wet-gate ARRISCAN film scanner from the 35mm original camera negative. Thousands of instances of dirt, debris, scratches, splices, and warps were manually removed using MTI's DRS, while Digital Vision's Phoenix was used for small dirt, grain, noise management, flicker, and jitter. The original monaural soundtrack was remastered at 24-bit from the 35mm magnetic track. Clicks, thumps, hiss, hum, and crackle were manually removed using Pro Tools HD, AudioCube's integrated workstation, and iZotope RX 3.
Scanning: L'Immagine Ritrovata, Bologna.
Colorist: Lee Kline, New York.""

The audio is limited in dynamic range as it is presented in a lossless 1.0 track.  It is perfectly acceptable with excellent dialog clarity.  English subtitles are available for the Dutch/French audio.  The package includes a leaflet with an essay by critic Scott Foundas, interviews with Sluizer and ter Steege and the original trailer.

I was watching it on a regular Samsung 32"" screen TV through  its normal audio mechanics.  Perhaps if you  have your system attached to other audio equipment, it will do. But if you're only listening through the speakers in the TV, you won't be able to hear it even with the volume adjustment on high.
I do recommend this movie however. I agree with others in calling it one of the most terrifying IDEAS out there. It is not a typical American thriller with blood and vulgar gore... it will be appreciated by those who prefer to mull over the horror of what one being can do to another.  In this way, it is more cerebral than visual, but terrifying none the less.  As others have said , it will haunt you long after viewing it.",1392768000,2,839,4.387096774193548

The propensity of French cinema of making 99.999% of their films based on a character study is way boring in this day and age.

There is nothing new, extraordinary or even interesting about this movie. Tons of nonsense. The script seems to be written for extra terrestrials, more than for common human beings. I know it is just a movie, but there is too much here that does not make sense.

Bottom line: looked to me like a story somebody would tell you, of an event, that nobody really cared about. I have seen B- Hollywood movies that did not look this retard.",1383436800,,663,4.462809917355372
446746,5,6302272548,"A master class in intelligently crafted, emotionally harrowing suspense. Tim Krabbe's underlying novel (originally titled The Golden Egg) is okay, but the film version shows George Sluizer learned all the right lessons from Clouzot and Hitchcock and added some freaky improvements all his own. This low-key film, like its villain, makes all its moves out in the open and seems to put all its cards on the table right from the start. And if, like the hero, you believe that, you will be punished for your gullibility. The Vanishing is one of those rare horror movies that makes the world seem more sinister. I've never seen another movie in which the ending is so carefully prepared, and so in keeping with the logic of the story, and yet so shocking when it arrives.

446754,3,6302272548,"What disturbed me the most about the film was the demonstration of how human weakness and stupidity and obsession, or basically foolishness, gets people victimized by the predators.
These ""unaware"" people are going around doing their thing, lost in their own little worlds, sort of ""trusting mankind"" for their safety. So they don't pay attention to their surroundings and don't practice ""discernment"" or listening to one's heart.
So, you have a man who allows his girlfriend to be out of his sight regularly, while in a foreign country, and a woman who blithely approaches and then continues to talk to a stranger, even following him to his car without so much as a word to her boyfriend. Then, after she becomes a ""mission of discovery"" to the man, his obsession to know what happened to her allows him to ignore the fact that the man told him that he is a sociopath, and even told him what his purpose was in grabbing Saskia.
Rex even suggests that he killed saskia and will kill him too, but that doesn't seem to stop him from ""drinking the coolaid"".
Thus, pure foolishness gets him into a situation that he had admitted was his worst fear.
This is what's difficult about this movie and most horror flicks of this kind; without the cooperation of the victim, the perp wouldn't have been able to pull it off.
I would have been more entertained by a plot wherein he figures out how to capture them without their help.
This is why it's difficult for me to see such movies; a horrible thing happens to people because they didn't do what would have been logical or reasonable, and they almost deserve what they get--not that I would wish that ending on anyone--it did haunt me afterward and yes, even kept me awake a bit.",1366416000,3,1720,4.605863192182411
446755,5,6302272548,"THE VANISHING has becomes one of my favorite films of all time. The film starts with a young couple on the road driving from the Netherlands to France on vacation. At a rest stop the young woman goes for some drinks and never returns. Her boyfriend then spends the next years obsessed with finding out what happened to her. It combines the genres of thriller, mystery, and horror with deep philosophical undertones about fate vs. human control when it comes to one's own existence. This illustrates the concept of existentialism in one of the cleverest and intelligent ways that I have seen in the past 20 years. The complexity of the character of the abductor of the young woman, Raymond, (Bernard-Pierre Donnadieu) is remarkable. He is a genius, a sociopath, a philosopher and one of the scariest people I have ever seen depicted in film just for those reasons. The concept of doing the opposite of what you instinctually, or in his case societally, know is the right thing. Only a pure sociopath could do the things he was able to do and do them without gratification or remorse. He is not a fantastical monster he is the guy who lives next door to you, the family man, the business man, the ordinary man. Frighteningly superb film.

Even then, at times the sociopathic behavior of the killer was almost more than I cared to deal with.

Third one: the increasing tension in which the despair and hopeless when finally he meets the criminal and tries by all his means, to gather with her fiancee accepting the imposed rules of game by the murderer.

This is a well rounded film that resumes the final goal of a supreme masterwork. to make us feel the cathartic experience at the climax sequence of the powerful final.

446805,3,6302272548,"George Sluizer's 1988 film SPOORLOOS (The Vanishing) is the story of a murder and the search for the killer, but it's not a whodunit for the audience at any rate. Just after Saskia (Johanna ter Steege) disappears at a French rest stop while vacationing with her boyfriend Rex (Gene Bervoets), the audience sees the long chronicle of local chemistry teacher Raymond Lemorne (Bernard-Pierre Donnadieu) preparing to carry out a murder of some random woman. As the film rises towards a climax, we follow Rex's obsessive hunt not for justice and retribution, but for simple understanding of what happened to his love. It is that unquenchable curiosity to know the very details, to indirectly share Saskia's fate that drives Rex towards his own appalling end. SPOORLOOS is widely known for its twist ending, and I'd recommend avoiding spoilers before you watch the film. I myself was spoiled, but still, Rex's doom was played very different than I imagined.

Rex is something of a one-dimensional figure who exists purely to carry out the philosophical conundrum that is the plot. Lemorne is the truly detailed character, even if I find some of his motivations hard to swallow. Donnadieu plays him convincingly -- I really came to despise this character. It's interesting that his initial attempts to abduct a victim, though played buffoonishly to a rather comic soundtrack, don't lighten the mood (as in, say, the black comedy of Edward Gorey), but rather make us squirm even more.

Though the twist ending makes this film memorable, and Donnadieu and, to a lesser extent (for she has little screen time) Steege's acting is fine, I wouldn't rank SPOORLOOS *so* highly. The cinematography is plain, and there's little re-watch value. It's worth seeing once, but don't think that its inclusion in the Criterion Collection means that it ranks among the best of auteur cinema.",1291420800,4,1867,5.058441558441558
446866,5,6302272548,"6/07: The Vanishing with Keifer Sutherland and Sandra Bullock was first seen by me three times. I did like the picture because it was an intriguing piece of work. It wasn't a while later that I happened to read in a DVD guide book that this was a remake of an outstanding picture and I was thereon advised to skip it and go straight to the Dutch original called Spoorloos. The film starts off slowly, getting everybody in place. And then when the ball gets rolling by the time of the disappearance, the movie is ultimately propelled by its momentum to the height of unparalleled ending. I don't think the word obsession has been sharply defined in any film like how Spoorloos does. It is without doubt a quintessential Hitchcockian movie. One of the most remarkable qualities about it is the willingness to uncover the identity and the routine of the sociopathic killer while, albeit a ruined ending, slowly unfolding the layers of how and why he becomes this sort of a person. The pacing is deliberate, and the nonlinear approach creates this auspicious need for tension toward to the climax which is the ending per se. But most importantly, the final realization of his actual achievement, similar to Maslow's pyramid theory from seedbed to actualization, lays out the haunting effect of what Spoorloos intends to achieve. Hence, the direction of George Sluizer is absolutely brilliant. Meanwhile, the casting is nicely put together, but it is Bernard-Pierre Donnadieu, as the brilliantly played sociopath, who gives the performance that many actors crave to deliver. When I think about his approach compared to Anthony Hopkins' in The Silence of the Lambs, it seems apparent to me that latter overplayed it excessively with no boundaries and was having too much fun with it. But Donnadieu gives an exploration for the audience to watch the fascinating development of his character's modus operandi based on his constructive thinking. Not too many films take the time to outline the plan. All in all, Spoorloos is one of the most incredible pictures made.",1291161600,6,2057,4.9479768786127165
446867,3,6302272548,"The symbolism is probably deeper than most people care to look (possibly including me); I would say that developing tunnel-vision (pun intended) regarding certain obsessions people entertain is certainly not a novel concept; everyone has fallen victim to acting on impulse in a sometimes overly aggressive manner, especially when there is guilt or shame to be accounted for brewing in the past, overly zealous defenses bubble to the surface and blind us from deconstructing the obsession and nurturing the observing ego, who would ordinarily red-flag us to when we are doing something potentially harmful.  Now, all this to say that the protagonist became fixated on discovering what fate his former romantic partner had encountered, and this hampered any further development of relationships; he clearly would rather be situated in the past than attempt to readapt to present circumstances.  Now, from a psychopathic standpoint, vulnerability is to be quickly and mercilessly destroyed.  Thus, the kidnapper, showing no emotion whatsoever, takes this broken man through a rather insipidly sadistic journey through the torments of his methodology.  In the end, the choice made by our hero is to be confronted by a very real version of his conflict, either abandon the past and its perils or fall victim to it, the consequences of which can be dire.  He chose the latter, and his obsession, which already had metaphorical walls keeping it at bay from any real-world influence, ended up creating physical walls, symbolizing how there truly never was any escape from this sordid psychic reality.

446868,4,6302272548,"I have seen the European and American versions of The Vanishing and I have read the book by Tim Krabbe. So, it is safe to say that I like this story. Of the two film versions, I prefer the European original, though I also like the American version. North American viewers of The Vanishing will particularly like all of the great shots of Europe in the late-1980s.

The Vanishing concerns a man whose lover disappears at a highway rest stop. Years pass and he becomes obsessed with finding her, or, more specifically, he becomes obsessed with finding out her fate. He has little hope that she is alive and little desire to rekindle their romance. The fact that he does not know her fate bothers him. His search for her leads close to the heart of evil.

I recommend The Vanishing. The style of this film is very European. The narrative meanders or - if you prefer - director George Sluizer allows the film to develop at its own pace. The Vanishing explores the contrast between our dull, but decent, ""everyday"" lives and the exciting, but abhorrent, actions that people can take to explore the dark side of life.

For those who are comfortable seeing the dark side of life, The Vanishing is difficult to top.",1264291200,5,1207,4.578703703703703

446873,4,6302272548,"I think the key to understanding this movie is to get the motivation of its characters. The mystery centers around specifics (what did the perpetrator do to this woman). But there is an alternate mystery of why he did it and why the boyfriend makes the decisions that he does. I'd classify this film as a mystery and a thriller, as opposed to a horror movie, though I can understand why viewers would be horrified by the actions taking place. I also think we need to question the motivations of the victim, who basically just walks into the crime scene practically begging to be abducted. Consider her actions first: In her supreme innocence and joyous with love, she actually offers to accompany her abductor back to his car to ostensively buy a trinket for her boyfriend. She goes to a car with a stranger, hesitates for a moment, sees a photograph of him with his family, and decides to trust him. Fatal mistake. This man has plotted an abduction of this type for a long time, but was never able to lure an unwitting victim (with the exception of one possible time a few minutes earlier). Here, the victim more or less offers herself. Then consider the abductor: of course he is deceptively normal, otherwise he'd have been jailed years ago as a potential kidnapper. He's tried many times to get his victims into his car, where he overcomes and drugs them. But no one falls for the ruse. Women have a basic presence of mind not to get into a car with a strange man. Saskia's natural defenses have abandoned her in her sleepless and traumatized state (there was a mishap with her and her boyfriend the night before which sets up this scene). Our perpetrator has a job and a nice family, but he's well aware that he's basically insane. He sees this sociopathology as an experimental opportunity--to see how evil he can be and get away with it. Basically, he plots to commit the perfect crime. And he does. Then there's the boyfriend: consumed by guilt and remorse. He will do literally anything to find out exactly what has happened to Saskia. He knows that he will die in the process, I think that is clear. He may be shocked at his fate, but I'm sure he knew he would not come out of his encounter alive.",1240617600,5,2207,4.52

446926,3,6302272548,"Without giving any spoilers, I'll say that the ending was a major disappointment. The girl's abductor is identified very early in the movie and, although his sociopathic nature as it is revealed through the course of the film is unnerving, the ending is hardly ""a genuinely chilling finale"". By the time the film wraps up, you're expecting something to happen, and when it does, you're left asking ""That was it?""  In fact, reading the blurb on the back of the box (or here on Amazon) pretty much tells you all you need to know about the film.

For me, there was virtually no suspense or tension after the girl's abduction. There was very little of Hitchcock in this film. If you're looking for a foreign film with Hitchcock style and a truly unnerving ending, try Les Diabolique (the original version, not the Hollywood remake).",1228521600,3,828,4.743055555555555
446927,5,6302272548,"This is arguably one of the most haunting, terrifying, and chilling films ever made.  It is generally classified as a horror film, but it goes far beyond being a simple horror film.  There are no real scares, there is no gore, but a deep, unsettling vibe that leaves you uneasy for the rest of your life whenever you think of this film.

It concerns itself with a man named Rex who is on vacation with his girlfriend.  They fight (at a European rest stop), they make up, she goes in to get some beverages, but never returns.  Rex becomes obsessed with finding his lost girlfriend, and the obsession goes on for years.  The man who is ""responsible"" for her disappearance sees Rex on a TV show, feels sorry for him, and decides to tell him who he is.  Enough of the plot, the rest is yours.

This film still gives me the shivers, and yet it's not overtly scary.  Perhaps because it finds its horror in every day life is why it's so unsettling.  It's one of the best thrillers ever made, and it becomes more terrifying (and plausible) ever time you see it.  The twists and turns of the plot are believable, and George Sluzier's direction is never flashy or draws attention to itself, enhancing the horror of the film.  Simply one of the best horror/thrillers ever made.",1220054400,2,1266,4.4803493449781655
446928,5,6302272548,"In a perfect world, a viewer planning on seeing this film for the first time would not be aware of its by-now famous ending.  It is a testament to everyone involved in the making of this movie, that knowing the ending does not spoil, in the least, that first viewing experience.  Truly, this is one film in which the 100 minute buildup is as satisfying and quietly thrilling as the utterly horrifying ending, itself.

What a buildup it is.  Alfred Hitchcock, who turned American Everyman James Stewart into a fascinating (and altogether believable) character study in obsession in Vertigo, his masterpiece, would have praised this film to the heavens.  Like Vertigo, The Vanishing is a quiet, deliberate, slow moving affair, in which we first become gradually drawn into Rex's building guilt and torment over the whereabouts of his missing girlfriend, Saskia, who literally disappeared under his nose.  During his 3 year quest to find her, we begin to learn more and more about the quiet professor who abducted Saskia.  When the 2 men ultimately meet, Rex's first impulse is to kill the man who has turned his life upside down; but he can't, because he simply has to know exactly what this man did to Saskia - there's that ""obsession"" word again. Rex knows this man has killed his girlfriend, and, while fully aware he is sealing his own fate, as well, nonetheless agrees to the killer's terms at the film's conclusion:  if you want to finally learn what happened to Saskia, the girl who vanished under your watch, you have to experience exactly what she did.  And boy does he ever.

Although not all American remakes of European films are botched-up disasters (case in point:  Insomnia, the fascinating Swedish suspense film, was made into a very credible character study/police procedural starring Al Pacino and Robin Williams), please avoid the American remake of The Vanishing at all costs.  Can you imagine a remake of Vertigo, where Kim Novak, falling to her death from the bell tower at the film's conclusion, is saved at the last second by a fortuitously placed life net?  Well, there in a nutshell is the ending of the American version of The Vanishing, and for the life of me, I can't believe the same director made both films.

One person says ""This has the greatest horror movie ending ever"", while a different person says ""That ending stunk; I could think of four much better endings than that.""

We are presented with a deceptively simple psychological horror story involving a young man's incredible determination to find out what happened to his missing girlfriend whom he last saw walking into a rest stop store for beverages. No trace of her after that. He never gives up his obsession to learn the truth. So determined is this man to end the mystery that he relinquishes control to the person who abducted the girl three years prior.
That is an obsession.

For years I had heard raves about how good this film is, and how incredibly chilling the ending is. That's a pity, because after seeing it I was first impressed but then disappointed. How can any film live up to being placed on such a lofty pedestal?

Yes, this film has merit, but it can't live up to the hype that its reputation holds. We go in expecting something amazing and we are therefore bound for a massive letdown. And the notorious ending is entirely too abrupt and not nearly as good as it could have been.

446930,5,6302272548,"The Vanishing (aka The Man Who Wanted to Know) offers one of European cinema's most quietly disturbing sociopaths, thanks to an excellent performance by Barnard Pierre Donnadieu, which is especially surprising considering what a plank he is in many of his films: the only thing more wooden than his performance in The Return of Martin Guerre was his character's leg, but here he's absolutely convincing as a perfectly natural, almost anonymously ordinary sociopath feeling his way one step at a time towards murder...

If you've seen the film, you probably still can't get the final revelation out of your head, but the film has plenty more to offer than that. The parallel chronology is interestingly used and the characterization is superb: although Gene Bervoets isn't always the equal of his role as a man who wants to know what happened to his missing lover far more than he wants her to be alive, Johanna Ter Steigge is outstandingly good and genuinely believable as the vanished object of his obsession.

446932,4,6302272548,"I couldn't wait to see this French psychological thriller.  My Amazon buddies Chris Blackshere and Clint Bronson recommended this film to me. I enjoyed the plot and the fact it had a sociopathic serial kidnapper in it.  This film is subtitled in English and the audio language is in French.  Again, as in Irreversible, the subtitles were abbreviated and you were missing a bit if you don't understand French.

First of all, I think this was a good storyline, but it was a bit too slow for me, I need a little more action.  The acting and the cinematography were good. The 35mm conversion to digital was fairly okay, but it was a bit dark in places and I thought the transfer could have been better.  The best is the cover of the DVD---a dark and lonely convience store at night, setting a perfect mood for this movie!

The movie begins where a couple are returning to Holland from their bicycling trip to France during one of the Tour de France races.  The girl, Saskia, warns her man, Rex, that his tank is getting close to empty.  When are guys going to understand that we women are usually right?  Well, the car, of course, runs out of gas and Rex hikes to get some.  Saskia waits in the car and when Rex returns she starts in on him (okay, guys, that's what women do). She's upset that he ran out of gas and left her by herself where something dreadful could happen.  They kind of make up and continue driving to a convience store to get the tank filled.  Saskia goes inside to get some refreshments only never to return.  Rex desperately searches for her, the police are no help.  Even after three years went by, he hasn't given up.  A strange, family man type of college professor, observes Rex's determination and sends him a postcard telling him he has information on his lost loved one.  This is where the movie gets more interesting.  Without giving away anything, Rex naturally returns to France to investigate.

While this movie held my interest and I recommend seeing it to any fan of psychological thrillers, I was kind of disappointed with the ending.  I kept imagining different endings, but not this one, and I was a bit disappointed with it.  I had a few ideas of my own that might have been even better.

And though I didn't think the acting or writing were anything too special, I did feel it started out quite effectively.  The opening shot of the stick insect, as the somewhat quirky soundtrack begins, set a subtly ominous tone.  Even better was the tunnel scene, which was very good, and, in my opinion, the best of the film.

However, after the pivotal gas station stop (not to give away too much), I felt the film slowly lost momentum.  The final scene, which so many make so much of, was not the mind-blower for me that it is for others.  Not a strikeout certainly, but neither a home run (a nice double is probably generous enough).

To sum up:  Good idea, promising beginning, then rolls its way to an eventual standing of ""Pretty Good"" (but not as great as we might've wished for).

off with a stick insect on a tree we than follow a couple
travelling in a car. The car runs out of gas and before
the man leaves his wife tells him of how being alone is the

The film is hailed to be suspenseful, shocking and horrific with and ending that will leave you speechless.  I found this movie to be very well directed and at times well acted.  Some of the cinematography was a bit off and some shots are much too dark. This could be due to the transfer from 35 mm low contrast print to a high definition medium.  As far as the plot and script, it is long and drawn out with little to no action with a few moments of suspense tossed in.  I think the film maker told a good story but it was paced a bit too slow for me.  When taking your time with a story like this one your need the ending to really bring it home for you.  I like the ending but didn't love it.  I thought it was a bit too abrupt and lacked the punch necessary to justify the drawn out plot.  I've heard comparisons to Hitchcock and feel this work is really not up to those kind of comparisons.  Hitchcock build the suspense slowly but always had direction and purpose in every shot.  He almost always delivered in the end.  His pacing was flawless in his better known works.  This film never really got to that point of tension for me.

The print used here is not very good; grainy and very choppy at times. The total running times is just 49min. COWBOY SHOOTING STARS lists it at 58min., so almost 10min. are missing. Right from the get-go, after the credits, we jump into action that's obviously missing the set-up. Maybe this is the best print currently available. I don't know, this is the first time I've seen this film.
However, important issues aside, this is one heck of a fun movie! Bill and his adopted son Tim (played by Bill's real life son Bill Cody Jr.) drive all the bad guys out of ghost town Silver City by pretending to be ghosts. They dress themselves and their horses up like skeletons for one hoot of a haunting! If you're a fan of poverty row horror films of the 1930's (Lugosi, Zucco, etc.) you'll get a kick out of this.
Wally Wales (former silent cowboy hero and fan favorite) plays Wolf Larson, the leader of the bad guys and he's simply great as usual. Bud Buster is around for comedy relief, but it's really the entire outlaw gang that supplies most of the laughs, especially when trying to sing some lame song early in the film.
The second feature, FRONTIER DAYS (1934), is the one worth the 5 stars. This is one of the films in which Bill wears his famous 50-gallon white cowboy hat that easily looks 10 sizes too big for his small head and body stature. And he has a tough time keeping it on, especially when diving head-first through windows and such!
The plots matter little with B-Westerns, it's the atmosphere and the wonders of low budget film-making that stand out...but in this one Bill is falsely accused of murdering a rancher and must clear himself and win the pretty girl.
A really stand-out scene has Bill turning himself in for the reward money to pay off the ranch loan with.
FRONTIER DAYS is an excellent, very enjoyable B-Western, sure to bring a smile to all. The Lone Pine locations are beautiful to behold!
Bill Cody is not by any means a great actor, nor is his son Bill Cody Jr. who also turns up here, but that's part of their charm. Wheeler Oakman is excellent as the lead heavy bank manager; suit, pencil moustache and all. William Desmond plays a crooked lawman and Lafe McKee is around too.
The Alpha dvd print here is very good with nice clear sharp image quality.
They seldom come better than this and make the dvd a must!
So, saddle-up with big hat Bill Cody and ride together through all those big rock formations saving ranches from evil bankers...a good time for all!",1186963200,2,2687,4.508196721311475
446976,5,6302272548,"A psychological thriller that burrows right under your skin, Sluizer's brilliant study of a random abduction and the impetus behind it provides the best kind of chills. What sets the film apart is the early introduction of Donnadieu, playing a devoted family man with a cold, calculating sociopathic streak. Masterfully building dread around both the disappearance and Lemorne's methodical kidnap dry-runs, glimpsed in an extended flashback, ""The Vanishing"" is a smart, creepy exercise in all-too-credible terror.",1184716800,2,513,5.7631578947368425

446979,5,6302272548,"""The Vanishing"" has always garnered a lot of attention because of its ending. The film has no violence, but people frequently proclaim how haunting and/or disturbing the ending is. Having said that, I don't want to build it up too much. The fact that I was expecting an ending like that made the ending less great for me. It's a great ending, but don't be expecting something in the league of ""The Sixth Sense"" all right? The movie, directed by George Sluizer, begins with a Danish couple named Rex and Saskia on a road trip. They have a small, insignificant spat and end up at a gas station. The film slowly builds their relationship, how close they are and it helps the film along in the fact that the relationship seems very real. Saskia leaves Rex by the car to get a coffee and some beer, but never returns. She just vanishes. The only thing Rex has to go on is a Polaroid where you can see her hair and what appears to be a man standing next to her. The movie's plot doesn't unfold in a typical, straightforward fashion. After the ""vanishing"" scenes, we meet her kidnapper Raymond. The movie doesn't present him as a kidnapper (we know he is of course); he merely appears with his family. He's a professor, a man with a round face that looks like he could be both trustworthy and dangerous. We watch him as he plots a random kidnapping and even tries it a few times, with no success. When the story returns to focus on Rex, we learn he is still looking for Saskia three years later. Raymond has set up meetings, via letters, with Rex several times but has always failed to appear. Rex is already in another relationship, but she is unhappy with his ""obsession"" with finding Saskia, a woman Rex has already accepted as being dead. The movies turning point comes when Rex and Raymond finally meet, with Raymond promising Rex he will learn everything about what happened to Saskia. We, as the audience, know that Saskia has to be dead. We make this decision early on in the movie, but the brilliance of the film lies in the fact that it causes us to second guess ourselves. We think she's dead, but we don't know how she died. Did she die? Even though we see a lot of the film from the killers' perspective, we don't know what happened to Saskia until Rex finds out. Now I return to the ending. It is good, well shot and haunting. But to say an ending is good, even great, is fine. But for me to build up the ending by raving about how great it is would ruin it for you. I might as well tell you what happens. The Criterion Collection has done a superb job with the DVD, although one would wish for more bonus features. The only thing we get is a trailer for the film. The acting and script of the film is great. The man who plays Raymond plays the character perfectly, not going over-the-top or downplaying it. As for the characters, they all react as normal people would. Rex's obsession seems like too much at times, but we realize how horrible it would be for that to happen and have no idea what happened. In a few words; A superb thriller.

446982,5,6302272548,"First, this review is for the 1988 George Sluizer version, and not the 1993 version directed by Sluizer starring Jeff Bridges (that was a disaster).  The Vanishing, or Spoorloos (Dutch Title) follows the lead character (Rex) as he desperately tries to locate his girlfriend Saskia, abducted from a highway rest area.  Rex's obsession prevents him from leading a normal life and he eventually throws himself fully into the mystery.  Years later, Rex draws out the abductor, Raymond, and we (the audience) are led/drawn/forced to the frightening and disturbing movie experience.

While we must take Rex and Saskia at face value, we learn so much more about Raymond through flashbacks.  We learn that he clearly knows the difference between right and wrong but will choose to be kind or evil at a whim.  At 16 while looking down from a balcony, he asks himself,  ""Where is it predetermined that I will not jump?"" And then he jumps, resulting in broken bones. Later, we see him save a little girl from downing and it's clearly not because he is ""good"".  In fact, you can almost see the thought process in his face before finally jumping into the water. Ultimately, Raymond's sociopathic motivations blend perfectly with the Rex's obsession to create an unforgettable ending.",1160956800,3,1270,4.985781990521327
446983,4,6302272548,"'The Vanishing' reminds me of the  Woody Allen film 'Match Point' which I also watched recently, in that they're both thrillers which approach their subject matter in a very flat, realistic and non-sensationalistic manner.  Creating outlandish criminals and schemes and rushing over them so that we don't notice how absurd they are is the standard thriller formula.  These films, however, take relatively simple and believable acts of violence and examine them in depth.  In a sense, they're the opposite of thrillers, slow and deliberate, all building up to a finale which proves to be surprisingly affecting, and certainly more affecting than the traditional thriller climax.  Unlike most people here, I won't tell you this method is necessarily better or smarter.  They both can work very well, and  `The Vanishing' does this more methodical approach quite well.

The film opens by introducing us to Rex and Saskia, a Dutch couple on vacation in France.  We get to know them fairly slowly, and they're obviously very affectionate, and prove to be a much more believable and appealing couple than you'd usually find in a film.  Before too long they stop at a gas station and Saskia heads off to get them something to drink.  She never comes back.  Rex becomes obsessed, and continually investigates, putting up posters and flyers.  He does this for three years, and he knows very well that Saskia must be dead.  Nevertheless, he can't move on; he must know what happened to her.

This isn't a single perspective film, however.  We are also introduced, quite early on, to Raymond Lemorne, the man who abducted Saskia.  He doesn't seem like the killer type, as he is an apparently quite balanced family man.  He seems to go through with the plan as an intellectual experiment more than any thing else.  Can he do it?  Can he get away with it?  Raymond is quite impressed with Rex's persistence, and he even contacts Rex via postcard, leading to their eventual meeting and the film's grimly inevitable climax.

Again, this film is very low-key.  There is almost no on-screen violence, to my recollection, and not even that much strong emotion or yelling.  They all almost always manage to keep a lid on it.  Sluizer shot the film in a very straight forward manner.  He rarely makes any sort of comment with the camera, but simply records what's going on.  It doesn't have a conventional plot arc either, no traditional rising action or raising of the stakes or what have you.  It's an everyday life sort of approach, an approach which refuses to shape the story into a standard movie plot form.  Nevertheless, it draws you in, making you *need* to know what happened, just as Rex does.

This film's greatest supporters love to tell you how intelligent this movie is, but I'm not sure if I really buy that argument.  It's not a dumb movie, certainly, but there really isn't all that much to it from an intellectual standpoint.  It touches on themes of predestination and obsession and so on, but that's nothing particularly new or remarkable in this way.  It does require patience and is just different from most films, which will doubtless throw some dullards, but while a capacity for patience and a taste for the different tend to go hand in hand with intelligence they really aren't the same thing.  This is all to say, I think stupid people will tend not to like this movie, but not because they don't understand it.  It's just not their thing.

`The Vanishing' is cleverly structured, though, shifting perspectives, first showing us the crime from Rex's perspective, then from Raymond's, slowly revealing information as the film goes on.  However, I think it's a bit too drawn out in the middle, showing Raymond's contemplation of Rex and Rex's endless attempts to solve the crime for a bit too long.  Beyond this, Rex's confrontation with Raymond isn't as interesting as it might have been.  By this point we've learned almost everything there is to know, so some of it proves a bit reiterative.  Still, the ending packs a punch, and is doubtless made more effective by the occasional slight dullness of the other parts of the film.

The performances are surprisingly good for a film this cheap.  As mentioned before, Saskia and Rex are very likable, not a movie couple at all.  Gene Bervoet's performance as Rex is probably the key to the film.  If you don't sympathize with him there isn't much to pull you  into the film emotionally. (I did, and so I was.)  Donnadieu's Raymond is a psycho like few others I've seen on a film.  He's an intellectual villain, which isn't rare, but he's different because his intellectualism isn't a cover for a madness lying underneath.  He's just so coldly logical and detached, a confessed sociopath, that madness doesn't even describe his condition.  He's barely even human.

Hmm, guess that's it.  Again, I don't think this is quite the masterpiece that some do.  It's still a bit slow and dry at times, but the characters are intriguing enough and the structuring clever enough to carry it.  (And, again, the ending is quite good.)  Definitely worth a look if you want to see a different sort of thriller.

For three years Bervoets searches for her, to no avail. After the kidnapping occurs we (the audience) are shown what the kidnapper (Bernard-Pierre Donnadieu) is all about: we see that he's an intelligent sociopath and are shown how and why he does the kidnapping. Director George Sluizer does some excellent cutting and interweaving of the two interlocking stories involving the men, and the viewer's interest never slackens. Bervoets and Donnadieu meet finally and what happens to Bervoets (as was the case with Ter Steege) is truly horrific. The movie is scarier and better than most movies like this because Sluizer is more intersted in intelligent motives than the usual horror/mystery concerns (wild action, sex, bloodshead).

447025,5,6302272548,"The Vanishing is the most terrifying movie I have ever seen in my life, I had nightmares for a week after I watched it.  The reason it succeeds so amazingly well is that the terror takes place in the viewer's mind; there is virtually no violence on screen at all.  Film violence is so common that it has no impact, (kindness, by contrast, would be stunning, if not unsettling, to encounter).  Decapitated cab drivers leave us cold not because we're insensitive people, but because film producers would rather rely on cheap exploitation than make movies about people worth caring about.  In The Vanishing, George Sluizer has done just that, and the result is a film that reels you in ever so gently until it has a death grip on your neck.

The story is amazingly spare and elegant.  A Dutch couple is on holiday, the wife is abducted.  In one of the film's many lovely bits of irony, the abduction is unceremonious, taking place in a dreadful highway rest stop.  We get the sense that frequently pure evil presents itself not dramatically but with a sort of lazy ordinariness.  The husband devotes years to finding her, ultimately making a public campaign of his quest.  Using flashbacks, we are gradually filled in on the story, we meet the abductor.  He too is hardly dramatic, a very bourgeois family man, a chemistry professor, a man who dotes on his daughters.  Only when he recounts a childhood incident where he leaped from a high ledge simply because it was the kind of thing one is forbidden to do are we at all welcomed into his secret world, where the pleasure of doing the unthinkable commingles with the thrill of absolute domination and the knowledge that one is invoking terror.

By the time the abductor contacts the husband, we have formed a powerful empathetic bond with him.  His grief and loss are both moving and real and we share the desperate need to learn his wife's fate.  Because of this, we are willing to overlook the almost total insanity of turning control over to the abductor, which is what he does.  The husband's plan succeeds, he gets the answer, the torment of uncertainty ends.  He pays dearly for this peace of mind, the end of this movie chilled me to the bone.

Whatever you do, DO NOT mistake this movie for the American version featuring Jeff Bridges.  In one of the strangest cases of the American film system ruining a foreign movie, Sluizer actually directed this one too.  One can only imagine that the studios told him what they wanted and he took the payday.  The Hollywood draft of The Vanishing is as horrible as the original is spellbinding.  Criterion has done it again.  A masterpiece worthy of a place in your permanent collection.",1146441600,10,2684,4.663829787234042
447026,5,6302272548,"Saskia is such a charming, winsome girl, it's no wonder boyfriend Rex can't get over her disappearance. He's obsessed, but then he left her alone once in the dark, and is fated never to repeat that first abandonment.

A superior suspense film, tightly written, well thought out, and very well-acted, especially by Johanna Ter Steege as Saskia on whose performance the film turns. Bernard Donnadieu as the chemistry professor is also subtly effective, the very embodiment of what some call the `banality of evil'-- a peculiarly passive, even bumblng mastermind, but also a shrewd and conniving opportunist. The family scenes of him at one calculated remove from loving wife and daughters are perhaps the most chilling of an extremely disturbing movie.

Unfolding story is not always easy to follow, but rewards are great. Philosophical themes are present but not in obtrusive or heavy-handed manner. Screenplay manages to combine these with dark psychological study such that elements come hauntingly together in final five minutes. It's a movie whose central ironies may not come into focus unless you think about the various threads.

I would think more of director George Sluizer's role in fashioning this sleeper were it not for the moment-of-decision scene in the park. Hyping that scene with phony thunder and lightning is totally unnecessary and at odds with the film's naturalistic style. It is a stagey distraction, and for that slip-up, the director must take ultimate blame.

I can't help but wonder what Hitchcock would have made of the material, particularly the peculiar bond between boyfriend Rex and tormentor Donnadieu. But then, he would likely have replaced the metaphysical aspect with more psychological study, whereas to me it is the successful combining of the two that makes the film so intriguing.

447028,5,6302272548,"""The Vanishing"" the 1988 French thriller directed by George Sluizer is a film superior to the over embellished Hollywood version starring Jeff Bridges which was also directed by Sluizer.  The film's appeal is in its simplicity in creating a tension filled experience based of the strongly developed highly motivated main characters, Rex and Raymond who are both portrayed eloquently. The maniacal manner is which both characters act out their fixations make for a powerful collision when they ultimately meet.

Gene Bervoets playing Rex Hofman and his girlfriend Saskia played by Johanna ter Steege are on holiday from Amsterdam going cycling in France.  Their car forebodingly runs out of gas in a darkened mountain tunnel leaving them vulnerable to an accident.  After a major blow out caused by his abandonment of the terrified Saskia to get gasoline they reconcile at a highway rest area.  As she goes to get beverages she's being observed by the sociopathic Raymond Lemorne played by Bernard Pierre Donnadieu who is stalking an unsuspecting victim.

Lemorne a married family man and a chemistry professor, on the surface seems rather normal.  However he possesses rather strong and aberrant internal obsessions that are compelling him to abduct a woman of his desire.

When Saskia does not return to Rex and their automobile he goes into a frenzy fruitlessly searching for her.

Three years elapse and despite an exhaustive campaign conducted by Bervoets including a media campaign, the wherabouts of the kidnapped girl remain a mystery.  An impassioned plea on TV finally gets Donnadieu to emerge from the woodwork and contact Bervoets.

In flashback fashion we learn exactly what happened to the girl in a refined and well conceived plan to lure some poor gal into the clutches of Donnadieu.  His icy, unemotional manner evokes terror.  Using Bervoets' impassioned desire to learn what became of Saskia, he convinces to trust him to reveal exactly what happened to the girl.  The psychopathic Raymond intends to recreate the abduction using Bervoets to play the role of the victim, resulting in an ironic and disturbing ending.",1139356800,2,2134,5.183673469387755

I managed to snag a copy of this Criterion edition and, while the extras are scampy, the movie alone is worth the price...glad I bought it!

The story is of two lovers, Rex and Saskia (played strongly by Gene Bervoets and Johanna ter Steege), are on their way to a nice vacation and have a strange incident in the tunnel after Rex's car runs out of gas. Speed up to the rest stop, where Saskia and Rex have a lot of good times before Saskia goes into the service station and...never comes back. After Rex realizes something is very wrong, he is in a frenzy...asking people if they've seen her, looking around everywhere. What's more chilling is the villain of the movie (played in such an eerie manner by Bernard Pierre Donnadieu) has already been seen by us the viewer, so we have an idea that he probably has kidnapped Saskia. What we don't know is what he has done with her.

Rex spends several years trying to find out what happened to her and his new girlfriend becomes so quietly menaced by this that she winds up eventually leaving Rex. The sociopath, Raymond, is so intrigued by Rex's relentless search for Saskia that he eventually contacts him and they meet up. From there, the film proceeds to lead us on the search for Saskia, but it ultimately sets out to unravel the grim fate of our hero. Donnadieu has some funny moments as well when he talks to himself, but he does hold some chilling demeanor as well that leaves you completely cringing for what might be his next move. But all the leads in the movie inhabit their roles with such gusto and prominence, especially Bervoets who we feel such sympathy for. We feel his frustration; we feel his pain; we feel his unflinching dedication to finding Saskia. The film is famous for the having one of the most heart-halting climaxes in the last 20 years, and when you see the ending of this film, you'll never look at other people the same way again. It's a downbeat ending, and it's an absolutely brilliant one. You are left with no satisfaction in seeing what ultimately happened to Saskia (and then towards the end to Rex); you are letdown that Raymond never gets caught; and you are left shocked that there is no happy ending for our lovers by any means. And that, plus the strong atmosphere and tight directing, make THE VANISHING so worthwhile.

Hitchcock did it with PSYCHO; Carpenter did it with HALLOWEEN and THE THING; FRIEDKEN did it with THE EXORCIST; Fulci did it with THE BEYOND, CITY OF THE LIVING DEAD, and ZOMBIE; and now Sluizer has made the ultimate thriller that ranks right up there with those aforementioned classics. THE VANISHING will leave you bewildered, shocked, frightened, saddened, and ultimately very satisfied that you have witnessed one of the best thrillers in movies...period.",1129680000,8,2931,4.654440154440154
447031,5,6302272548,"""The Vanishing"" may make you wake up in the middle of the night with a racing heart, thinking of the horror of it, and most likely you will never forget this film. It is without doubt, the most deeply disturbing film I have ever seen, and gave me nightmares when I saw it in its 1988 release. The quiet subtlety of it is what makes it so real and memorable, and also because the obsessive man who is the perpetrator is an intelligent professor and family man that would go unnoticed in any crowd.

The plot concerns Rex and Saskia, a young couple in love on vacation. While at a tourist rest stop, Saskia goes to get refreshments and never returns. Rex dedicates his entire time during the course of the next 3 years, searching for an answer to what happened to her, and is unable to keep any other relationship. All the while the perpetrator, who likes to ""go against what is predestined"" in his life, watches Rex and plays a cat and mouse game with him.

Adapted from Tim Krabb's novel ""The Golden Egg"" by director George Sluizer, this is far from your typical Hollywood horror film; in fact the 1993 remake starring Jeff Bridges and Keefer Sutherland, though an entertaining film and also directed by Sluizer, is ruined by a totally improbable, silly ending. The acting in this original version is full of nuance and quite brilliant, especially by Gene Bervoets as Rex. Other great performances come from Bernard-Pierre Donnadeiu as Raymond the kidnapper, and Johanna ter Steege as Saskia. The score by Henny Vrienten also adds a lot to the tension of this dark thriller.

447032,4,6302272548,"At a recent family barbecue, I overhead my step-dad talking to some of my second cousins about scary movies. The second cousins named some traditional horror films, but my step-dad said ""The scariest movie I have ever seen is ""The Vanishing"""". This made me think of the film and sent a chill down my spine as my mind replayed images from the film. A few weeks later, I was flipping through channels and Fox Movie Channel was playing the American version of ""The Vanishing"", featuring Jeff Bridges, Keifer Sutherland, Nancy Travis and Sandra Bullock in an early, smaller, supporting role. I watched the ending of the American film and realized that it was a prime example of what can go wrong when foreign films are remade at an American studio. The original film's ending was changed robbing the Sutherland - Bridges version of any lasting impact. Strangely, both versions were directed by the same man, George Sluizer.

Recently, I decided to watch the original again. The Criterion Collection has released a DVD of the 1988 film. ""The Vanishing"" is a terrific example of how to make a suspenseful, great film, paying homage to the master, Hitchcock.

Rex Hofman (Gene Bervoets) and his girlfriend, Saskia (Johanna ter Steege), a young Dutch couple, are taking a road trip through France. Their car runs out of gas in a dark tunnel and Rex leaves a panicking Saskia behind to go and get some gas. Upon his return, he promises Saskia he will never abandon her again. Later, stopping at a rest stop, Saskia goes inside to get some drinks and never comes back. After a while, Rex realizes she is gone and begins to search frantically for her. But she is nowhere to be found. Over the next three years, he continues the search; he posts posters all over France, goes on news programs, revisits the rest stop. His obsession eventually leads to the end of his current relationship with Lieneke (Gwen Eckhaus). During this time, he attracts the attention of Raymond Lemorne (Bernard-Pierre Donnadieu), a family man who owns a house in a remote part of the French countryside. Raymond, the man who abducted Saskia, becomes intrigued by Rex's obsessive quest to find his girlfriend.

""The Vanishing"" is a terrifying, frightening film but not because of men wearing masks wielding chainsaws, ghosts, or other fake monsters. It is terrifying because the monsters are real people, people who could be living next door.

The film begins with Rex and Saskia having a fight. After they make up, he pledges that he will never leave her again. Apparently, this means a lot more to the Dutch than to your typical American. He spends the next three years of his life searching for her. Yes, he moves on with his life, a bit, but there is always the thought of that pledge haunting him.

All of his activity brings him to the attention of Raymond. Director Sluizer brilliantly depicts this character in a way that makes him very real. We spend time with him, his wife and his two daughters, on vacation at a broken down little farm house they own in the French countryside. One of the daughters opens a drawer containing bugs. She screams. Raymond, his wife and their other daughter join in the fun, making as much noise as possible. Raymond takes one of his daughters with him to a local fair. Raymond seems like a normal guy, someone you might work with in your office. But one day, he and a co-worker walk by one of Rex's posters. Raymond comments ""Not again"" and we begin to realize that perhaps Raymond is not just an innocent bystander.

Sluizer shows us all of the secrets in Raymond's character - he is the man who abducted Saskia - so this doesn't add suspense but it does add to the horror. We quickly realize that two events described above - the family screaming for fun and the trip to a local fair - are part of Raymond's sick attempts to become a better sociopath. He is always trying to figure out new, effective, streamlined ways to abduct his next victim. For instance, he runs into a neighbor and asks if the screaming and the noise his family made bothered him. The neighbor didn't hear a thing. As Raymond drives away, a slight smile creeps across his lips.

The suspense comes when Rex and Raymond actually meet face to face. Raymond can't resist telling Rex that he is the person who abducted Saskia. He promises to let Rex learn everything that happened to his girlfriend, but he has to experience it as she did. At this point, Rex is so obsessed that he goes along with it, driving with the stranger from his home in Holland back to France, through the rest stop where everything started, to...

Will he finally learn what actually happened to Saskia? Therein lies the horror.

The Americanized ""Vanishing"", featuring Bridges, Sutherland, Travis and Bullock is an OK film, to a point. Sluizer was lured to Hollywood based on the critical and financial success of his film. Shockingly, instead of letting him become a new artistic force in Hollywood, they asked him to remake the same film, but to change the settings and the ending. They changed the ending! My God. Why?!?!? The ending is the best part of the entire film. The ending is where all of the horror and suspense pays off, etching images indelibly into your brain.

Rent the original. Or if you have already seen it, and love it, buy the Criterion version.",1126656000,9,5323,4.683422459893048
447033,5,6302272548,"WARNING!!!  Be VERY CAREFUL when reading other reviews here - some of your fellow Amazonians have given away an important plot twist that will diminish your enjoyment viewing this film.  I will not do that here.

This excellent psychological thriller is about two men.  One of them is obsessed over the disappearance of his girlfriend at a gas station when they were on a road trip together.  Was she kidnapped?  Murdered?  Or did she just leave him?  He has to know at any cost.  Years pass, he gets a new girlfriend, and obviously no longer loves the one that disappeared, but his obsession has only grown over time.  He hangs ""missing"" posters around town and goes on TV begging to know what happened to the missing woman.

The other man is a mild-mannered husband and father, the kind of guy that might live next door to your house in the suburbs.  After doing something very good as a young man, he develops an obsession of his own - he wants to see if he is also capable of doing something equally evil.

The stories of these two men intersect, and, in a way, each holds the key to the other's obsession.

Watching this film is not effortless - it has subtitles and lots of flashbacks.  One thing that helps is that whenever the film focuses on the time around the woman's disappearance, someone has a radio on and is listening to coverage of the Tour de France (a 21-day bike race, for those of you unfamiliar with Lance Armstrong).

In the buildup to the climax, all questions are gradually answered and the movie leaves us with everything resolved in a very cool way.

The movie has some great literary devices.  Early in the film, a creepy incident in a tunnel sets the tone and becomes a metaphor for something important later in the film.

One very cool thing about this film is how terrifying it is, without resorting to gimmicks, special effects, gore, or foreboding violin music.  The director really pulls off a minor miracle.  And you think you know who the bad guy is early in the film, and you may be right, yet the suspense is still quite compelling.

The same director was hired by Hollywood and paid a lot of money to create a sanitized remake.  Avoid it.  This version is the real deal.",1099094400,16,2209,4.506297229219143
447094,5,6302272548,"Bravo to the filmmakers for this international psychological thriller! I found this film to be one of the best suspense pictures I have ever seen.

The film takes place in France as a Dutch couple is about to embark on a vacation together. After stopping at a highway rest stop their lives change forever and with an eerie foreboding that lingers throughout the entire film. The couple is played by Gene Bervoets and Johanna ter Steege with convincing roles as innocent lovers who never suspect danger lurking in their paths.

Bernard-Pierre Donnadieu is brilliant as the sociopath mathematician who stalks women at rest stops throughout the film. He is the perfect villain, an unsuspecting and happy family man who commutes between his city home and country home all the while plotting with numbers and calculations to capture gullible women and commit some mysterious act on them. Donnadieu is creepy and scary without doing anything obvious to portray himself that way. The uneasiness that surrounds him is comparable to some of the best American suspense films involving psychopaths. He decides from an early age to go against the odds and jump from buildings just because the probability factor is so remote that he would ever do so. This act then extends into adulthood and begins his current quest. The filmmakers never reveal exactly what Donnadieu is attempting but you will be glued to this film so that you can find out.

The ending of this film is phenomenal.....one of the best ever! It will send shivers up and down your spine. For suspense lovers this is a must own DVD for the French scenery, the creepy evil that lurks in its corners and the ever present sense of dread.",1091577600,6,1687,4.850694444444445

Nonetheless, this movie is more than the tension.  The characters are strong (particularly the villain), many of the visuals are strikingly visceral, and this nicely contrasts w/ the philosophical storyline.  The villain is one of the most original villains in Film.  He is an intellectual creature, not driven by anger or childhood trauma or emotional prejudice...rather cold, hard logic.  His premises may be unsound, but you can at least you can understand the method to his madness.
They simply don't make movies, yet alone thrillers, like this anymore.  Taking Lives?  Your average Ashley Judd film?  Puke.  This is the type of movie for people who like Seven, Memento, Requiem for a Dream, Identity...not for the sunshine pumpers, I assure you. But fiction *should* test our boundaries and make us uncomfortable...

447097,5,6302272548,"I've watched this movie several times, and I must admit I was shocked to see that some people find the film boring.  If you do in fact pay any attention to the film you can delve deeply into the disturbed minds of both Raymond, Rex, and even Saskia.  Raymond is obsessed with his own need to beat predestination, and the result is a complete lack of conscience on his part.  People who lack a conscience are some of the most dangerous people alive.  Rex himself is a warning.  He became so obsessed with Saskia that he compelled himself to repeat her experience unto death.  And that's just on the surface.  This movie puts the ""psychological"" in psychological thriller, instead of just being a mystery to solve.  Also, I was horrified to find that most people were not disturbed by the fact that Rex and Saskia were buried alive.  You even see Rex wake up in his own coffin.  Doesn't anyone realize how horrible that would be?  That is a slow and agonizing death.  No one can hear you scream, you can't get out, eventually you'll run out of air.  If you find being buried alive boring I suggest you try it.  It's an incredibly diabolical thing to do someone.  There you lie, with the dirt pressing in all around you, doomed.  And the fact that Raymond just didn't seem to care was also terrible.  And he could get away with it.  Anyone can go around shooting people or slashing around with a knife, but how many people can manage to bury two people alive.  And there isn't a shred of suspicion attached to him.  True he didn't torture Rex or rape Saskia, and if it's violence you're looking for you won't find it here.  You also won't find this to be a whodunit story.  But if you're looking for a *real* psychological thriller, this is it.",1083628800,6,1741,4.443037974683544
447098,5,6302272548,"I've seen a number of reviews of this movie, ranging from 'horrific' to 'outstanding' and I must say, I'm somewhat disappointed in the way some people are going about viewing the film. Don't be fooled by those who claim the movie 'sucks' just because it lacks today's special effects and gore. The Vanishing has potential for people of all ages. I, myself, am a mere senior in high school and was thoroughly horrified by the ending. It's true that today's society has been jaded by what is shown in the movies, on television - Heck, even in the news. Everywhere we look, it seems to be just more blood and gore. The wonderful thing about this movie is that it has the ability to reach through your heart, to your spine and just start twisting it about like a dog with a chew toy. It's true, there are no bloody decapitations or gut wrenching gore - but that's not what the movie was about. The movie was able to show an audience the ability of obsession to drive the very essence of your being to the point of no return (This could be said for either Rex or Raymond). We mustn't look at the movie from today's standards of what would be classified as 'horror'. We must open ourselves up to the horrifying truths of the conscious and the unconscious and allow the plot to drive us further towards the edge of our seats until the very last minute. Tell me, friends, would you consider yourselves obsessive over anything at all? If so, take a look at this movie. Let it capture your attention... let it move you... let it help you see yourselves in a way never before possible. THAT's what The Vanishing is all about.",1083542400,6,1614,4.437710437710438
447099,1,6302272548,"I have to agree with the reviewer who was totally shocked at the descriptions of this film by other reviewers.  After reading reviews that described the film as SHOCKING!  CHILLING!  NIGHTMARISH! I decided to finally purchase this dvd after hesitating for a few months.  I'm sorry - but I was highly disappointed.  I consider myself a horror fan of sorts and I'm not normally into the blood and gore type of films, prefering ""psychological thrillers"" instead.  This film was neither.  Do yourself a favor before purchasing this movie and RENT IT FIRST!!!",1080259200,15,554,4.956521739130435
447100,5,6302272548,"Most movies that claim to be horror films nowadays are not that way at all.  They are bloody slashfests, where the only real suspense is trying to figure out how many different ways people will die and how much blood will be spent.  Most of them are totally unrealistic, so people can simply remove themselves from the possibility of the film actually happening.  They can look at the film as pure fantasy.  Movies like Friday the Thirteenth or Nightmare on Elm Street feature killers who can't possibly exist.
Then, we have movies like The Vanishing.  I am not talking about the inferior remade American version from 1993.  I mean the original Dutch/French version from 1988.  This is the best horror film I have ever seen, even though there is not one drop of blood or one death on screen.
The story is pretty simple.  Rex (Gene Boerverts) and Saskia (Johanna Ter Steege) are lovers taking a bicycle vacation through France.  They have a small catastrophe very early in the film (run out of gas) and Rex chooses to leave her behind in a tunnel to get help.  They are both rather upset when he leaves and when he returns, she is not in the car.  He puts the gas back into the car and drives through the tunnel, where he sees her at the end.  They make up eventually and decide to stop at a gas station for a restroom stop and just to take a break.
After coming back from the restroom, Saskia offers to go back to get them something to drink.  Right before she goes in, she makes him swear that he will never abandon her again.  He swears to it, she goes into the convenience store, and seemingly vanishes into thin air.  He never sees her again.
At this point, the viewer probably thinks it will be a whodunit, where we try to piece together clues and figure out who the culprit is who would kidnap the girl.  But no, we are introduced to the kidnapper immediately.  Even more surprising is that he becomes the main focus of the movie for the next 20 minutes, while we learn about his background and his lifestyle.  He has a family and is completely normal from the outside.
From here, three years pass and Rex is desperately trying to figure out what happened to Saskia.  He has a new girlfriend who is sympathetic to the situation, but he can't get Saskia out of his head.  He spends all his free time obsessing about her, and where she could be.  It makes no sense to him.  All the while, the kidnapper sends him letters telling him to meet him at certain places to find out about her.  He goes each time, but never actually meets the kidnapper, because the kidnapper stays out of range, he only wants to see how badly Rex wants the answer.
Finally, out of desperation, Rex goes on TV and pleads with the kidnapper to reveal himself.  He tells him he does not want to hurt him, he just wants to know what happened to Saskia.  The kidnapper decides to take him up on it.  He goes to Rex's house.  What happens from here on is for you to learn yourself.  I will say that the reasons for the kidnapping are made clear and the true horror of the movie becomes evident in the last part.  The kidnapper is a real person, he could be your next door neighbor.  The man has two daughters and teaches chemistry at a local university.  Yet in his mind he is able to plan out in intricate detail and execute this crime.  Eventually he offers Rex a choice to find out what happened to Saskia.  To find out, Rex has to put himself in a vulnerable position.  He makes the choice and...
He brings the movie to what has to be one of the most blood chilling endings in film history.  It is completely logical and goes right along with what has gone before, but the audacity and straightforward nature of it will shock you.  I promise, you won't soon forget this ending.  It is criminal that the American film chose to change this ending to make it happier.  As a result of this, the fates of the characters are completely different.  The mystery to me is that the same director did both films.  Why would he make such a great first effort and then let it be butchered so badly in this shoddy second telling?
No matter.  The first film is a horror classic, belonging right up there with the greats.  If you have never seen this movie, rent it or find someone with a copy.  The DVD is pretty good, but unlike lots of Criterion copies with a boatload of extra features, this is rather stripped down.  There is a trailor in French which is okay and an essay in the inside cover of the case, but that's pretty much it.  The sound is clear and the subtitles are much better than when the film first hit video in the late eighties.  Without a doubt, this is one you can't miss!",1065052800,8,4656,4.342989571263036
447101,4,6302272548,"OK, first of all, I'd like to agree with most everyone here that this is an excellent movie.  It only barely misses getting five stars from me, which I think should be reserved only for the VERY BEST of all time.  My problem with most of the reviews is that they're saying that the American remake is a worthless piece of drivel, and that just isn't true.  I think that Jeff Bridges gives just as fine a performance playing the sociopath as does Donnadieu in this film, if not slightly better.  Kiefer Sutherland is also just as believable as the boyfriend desperate to find out what happened to his vanished lover.  And I think that the original version, if you're watching it for the first time without already knowing the story, fails to make it clear to the viewer at first that certain scenes of the sociopath's life are flashbacks leading up to the abduction, instead of occuring immediately afterwards; I saw the remake first, and I didn't have that problem.
  That said, because I'm a true horror fan, I DO prefer the original's ending over the remake's.  BUT - and this is a very significant BUT - it's not that the remake CHANGES the ending, it ADDS TO the ending, leading to a ""happy"" (if you could call it that) conclusion.  And I don't think that these added scenes are pointless afterthoughts to reach a more Hollywood ending - I get the feeling that, no matter how the novel The Golden Egg ended (which I can't seem to find anywhere), Sluizer intended this to be the ending all along.  Without this ending, the relationship between the sociopath and his youngest daughter, as well as a significant element of the plotline introduced in the first version, is never fully explored, and the obsessive boyfriend's new love is never more than a throwaway character.
  If you've never seen either version of this movie, here is my advice : buy the original (DEFINITELY at least see it first, to more fully take in and enjoy THAT ending), then rent the remake to see the LONGER ending.  It may not be the best, but it IS worth seeing.",1058227200,9,2042,4.561643835616438

Well, the original is anything but formulaic, though I've been told the remake screws up and changes everything that made The Vanishing such a memorable, effective thriller in the first place.

I'm not sure if it is because I saw it first, I just found the French abductor not very scary, whereas Jeff Bridges portrayed this strange character very well.

447158,5,6302272548,"""The Vanishing"" is one of the most terrifying films I've ever seen, but not in the usual sense of the word ""terror"".  This is disturbing in a way not done since Hitchcock or Bergman. While many will mistake this for a ""thriller"" or a mere tale of kidnapping, etc, but there is something going on here that suggests far more than the (extremely intriguing, suffice to say) story. This is a horror film about the human condition itself. If he wasn't dead, I would have thought Camus had directed it.  Beneath the calm facade of everyday life lies arbitrariness and chaos--absurdity.  On a beautiful day Saskia, a gorgeous young French woman, simply disappears after going into buy a soft drink for her boyfriend as they are on a biking trip together. She never emerges. The reason, which is indeed horrible, is not so significant as the fact--she simply disappears.  Her boyfriend's descent into near madness via obsession rivals many classic movies I would consider sacred. How can a human being with friends, lovers, parents, etc, disappear into thin air? Where is the justice, the knowing?
This, I believe, is what the director is trying to convey--there is none, and at no point does ultimate knowledge about anything enter our lives.
The ending is horrifying but absolutely necessary, which is why the remake is nothing but a waste of celluloid. The most significant scene is the dialogue between the kidnapper and Saskia's boyfriend during the downpour near the gas station.  The key to his motive for this atrocity is ""the eternal not knowing""--he wants someone to share the pain of life's complete uncertainty.  A masterpiece.",1029369600,7,1632,4.937956204379562

Rex and Saskia are Everyman/woman caught in what is simply an artfully speeded up version of the life cycle. Think about that symbolic tunnel they pass through at the beginning.  On the other side death awaits, inexplicable, ordinary and inevitable--just like Lemorne.  And like Rex, we all deny the obvious and search for the lost loved one only to be eventually snatched away by Him ourselves.  What is so unsettling to the viewer is the film's relentless subliminal message: the inescapable outcome of life and love is death and loss.",1002585600,6,689,4.913793103448276
447214,5,6302272548,"I'm going to warn you that hubby found this film repulsive and wished he'd never seen it. I agree that a lot about it is repulsive but it is a terrific film.  It is a suspense film done on the level of an Hitchcock film but it is a lot more grisly.  A woman disappears at a gas station when she and her boyfriend are taking a brief pit stop.  For years afterwards the boyfriend goes nuts trying to find out what happened to her.  Then, it appears that he will find out exactly what happened to her by meeting with this one person who may have been responsible.  As this film steamrolls towards its conclusion, your heart will be in your throat and you will never forget the resolution of the whole mystery.  Some viewers will find this film very disturbing.  I think seeing it is worth the upset.  This was remade in America some years later and was simply awful.  Skip the American remake at all costs.

447216,4,6302272548,"A disturbing movie that will take you into realms usually reserved for Poe and Lovecraft, ""The Vanishing,"" directed by George Sluizer, is a dark tale that takes you into the twisted mind of a man named Raymond Lemorne (Bernard-Pierre Donnadieu), with implications that are truly frightening.  While on vacation, a young couple, Rex Hofman (Gene Bervoets) and Saskia Wagter (Johanna ter Steege), stop at a crowded rest area.  While he fills the car with gas, she goes into the store for some drinks.  And she never comes back.  And, lest the scenario seem too improbable or implausible, Sluizer proceeds to take you back through the days preceding the mysterious disappearance; and once you meet Raymond, you begin to understand what happened, and how.  And when you finally know, it's as terrifying as anything you could possibly imagine.
 On the surface, Raymond appears to be a rather ""normal"" individual; he's married, with two children, and teaches science.  He and his wife, Simone (Bernadette Le Sache), have recently purchased a country home which they are gradually restoring, and spend some time there with their children whenever they can.  But hidden beneath Raymond's reserved and respected exterior is a sociopath capable of actions so heinous it defies comprehension.
 Leading up to the day of the vanishing, the film alternates between scenes of Rex and Saskia vacationing, and Raymond, as he methodically plans and calculates his cold-blooded crime.  And it's chilling, watching him prepare and fine-tune each step so matter-of-factly, as if he were staking out a new garden or planning a picnic with the family.  It's unsettling, watching Rex and Saskia going about their business, blissfully unaware of the terror that awaits them.
 What puts the real bite into the impact of this film is the way it's presented; this is no boogeyman-in-the-closet or ""slasher"" type horror film-- it goes way beyond that and takes you into a very real world of very real horror.  Early on, of course, you know that Raymond is responsible for Saskia's disappearance.  But don't have a clue as to what he's done with her or where she is-- dead or alive-- until the very end of the film.
 The second half of the film concentrates on Hofman's obsessive quest to find out what happened to Saskia.  Three years have elapsed, and he still doesn't have a clue (and neither does the audience at this point).  Then something happens, something is revealed, and you follow along with Rex as he pursues the single clue he's been given after all this time.  And as you watch him desperately trying to uncover the truth, you begin to hope with all your heart that he does.  Because after a point it becomes excruciatingly clear that if he fails, you'll never know what happened, either.
 Ter Steege lends an earthy vitality to the role of Saskia, with a performance that is entirely convincing and very real.  Bervoets does a good job as well, credibly expressing the myriad emotional levels that Rex experiences.  And Donnadieu, as Raymond, is absolutely disconcerting, exhibiting an off-handed nonchalance that evokes the image of a lion patiently stalking his prey.
 The supporting cast includes Gwen Eckhaus (Lieneke), Tania Latarjet (Denise), Lucille Glenn (Gabrielle), David Bayle (Raymond at 16), Roger Souza (Manager) and Caroline Appere (Cashier).  A sobering film that kind of sneaks up on you, ""The Vanishing"" does what most horror movies never really do-- it makes your skin crawl.  The ending is rather startling in it's simplicity; it may even leave you nonplused for awhile.  But once you've had some time to think about it and assimilate what actually happened, be prepared for a sleepless night or two.  This is one that just isn't going to leave you alone.",991526400,124,3761,5.004823151125402
447217,4,6302272548,"Here is the deceptively simple, yet mind-blowingly warped story of what happens when the lives of an average European couple cross the path of a seemingly average family man -- a guy whose mind blew a fuse at the age of six and began to bleed the thoughts of a sociopath. This film's ending is so dour, depressing, and hopeless that it made me want to vomit.
But ""The Vanishing""'s *most* disturbing aspect is that it actually carries the audience into the sociopath's mind, and invites each viewer to share the mad logic behind the heinous acts he commits -- a logic based upon principles universal and fundamental.
I've read many reviews which state, ""This is the scariest film I've ever seen."" I think it's more accurately described as ""disturbing"" instead of ""scary"".. a subtle, yet important distinction... Whereas a film like ""The Changeling"" (arguably one of the scariest movies ever made, about a haunted house) or ""The Exorcist"" has the ability to frighten for a couple of hours, here is a little wonder (MINUS any blood or gore) that could genuinely warp a viewer's mind if he or she took it too seriously.
I rated this film 4 stars instead of 5... not because it's poorly made or acted (on the contrary, the production and the performances are wonderful), but simply because it is difficult to fully enjoy a film that is this upsetting... When all is said and done, the grimness makes the viewing experience undesirable. In sum, I'll echo another viewer's sentiment: I wish I'd never seen this.
Watch at your own risk.",970185600,5,1528,4.7481203007518795
447218,5,6302272548,"I am a huge film buff, and there are very few movies that really leave an impression on me, but this is one of them.
the film is primarily a  mystery/psychological horror which takes us into the mind of a sociopath.  The villain is not some hideous monster like Fredy Krueger, but a family  man, who, all other things considered, seems to be normal.
The film is  shot very simply -- no fancy effects, no gore, no elaborate chase scenes..  in fact it looks like the whole thing could be done with a video camera --  but it is the scariest film I have ever seen, and should be a wake-up call  to horror film directors that the addition of special effects do not do  anything to the substance of a movie.
Highly reccomended
**Incidentally  please don't watch the U.S. version of the film -- It is garbage, and an  insult to the viewer's intelligence",964656000,5,846,4.4
447219,5,6302272548,"Perhaps I would have been better off if I had never seen this film. I don't usually watch horror films. I was scared out of my wits by ""Psycho"" when it came out in theater's (it's hard for younger  people who grew up with Freddie Kruger to imagine it, but there was a time  when you didn't see blood all over the screen.) This film does't show any  blood and I don't remember much violence, however, it's a psychologically  terrifying movie like ""Diabolique"" so if you have a weak heart  don't watch it.
""The Vanishing"" has a fine cast and was shot  somewhere in the Netherlands--I believe the cast is Dutch. Johanna ter  Steage(?), the fine actress who played Theo's wife in ""Vincent""  and Frau Beethoven in ""Immortal Beloved"" plays a young woman who  becomes the victim of a mentally unhinged stalker. The man's derangement is  demonstated by his lifelong willingness to ""experience"" things  like deliberately falling off a balcony so he can see what it feels like to  break an arm.
Johanna's boyfriend cannot overcome the loss of his  girlfriend. Her memory ruins opportunities to form a realationship with a  new person. The crime drives the boyfriend to acquire the attributes of the  man who 'stole' his girlfriend. First he becomes obsessed about  establishing a link with a particular person, just as the stalker became  obsessed about finding a woman he could kidnap. Second he stalks the  kidnapper in a variety of ways, just as the kidnapper used a variety of  ways to lure a woman into his car. Third, he says he is willing to  'experience' what the kidnapper demands so that he can discover what  happened to his girlfriend. In the end, I was left ""unhinged.""",960422400,45,1672,4.716262975778546
447220,5,6302272548,"This film is one of the most exceptionally disturbing horror films of all time.  The lean, psychologically terrifying premise is played out with clever, revealing twists and turns that result in one of the most shocking  and mind-bending finales ever.  The performances in this Dutch thriller are  exceptional; the tension and real anguish of the lead character's  predicament -- he lost his girlfriend at a highway truck stop -- is  palpable, and you will want closure along with him.  As with every other  reviewer below, I agree wholeheartedly that the skillful artistry of this  mesmerizing, involving movie is all but gone from the same director's  Hollywood-ized version of the same script, which exemplifies the dumbing  down of American audiences.  Rent or buy this original classic instead; if  you have a taste for terror, this will be appealing to you, even in its  horrifying conclusion.",959126400,9,899,5.152777777777778

Greatly enhancing the movie is the atmosphere created by the  subtitles and the setting in France and the Netherlands. Don't waste your  time with the wooden 1993 US English language version with Jeff Bridges,  Keifer Sutherland and the always bland Sandra Bullock. They're no match and  miscast in comparison with the European cast. Why Hollywood won't make a  movie with big names is beyond me.

447222,2,6302272548,"Having read Krabbe's The Golden Egg, watched this version and the American version of the films, I have to say I liked this one the best. But that's honestly picking which one I dislike the least. The story is compelling,  but the way it's presented leaves much to be desired. This version stays  very close to the book, but there are moments when I felt as though  something was very wrong. For example, when the kidnapping is being  practiced by the Lemorne, there is this bizarre, sprightly music playing.  What's up with that? The acting in this version is so-so, with Rex being  the character done the least amount of justice by his portrayer. Well,  actually, he isn't a very rounded character in the book, so maybe he's  portrayed the best. If you've read the book, you'll find this to be more  satisfying than the American version. Hell, even if you haven't read the  book, you'll be more satisfied with this one.",956188800,6,921,4.62962962962963

Her boyfriend is left to put the pieces together but he cannot.  It doesn't help that her abductor sends him postcards, taunting him, obsessing him at the cost of all else.  There is an uneasy neutrality when the film looks into the lives of the boyfriend and the abductor.  Indeed, the abductor, though he describes himself as a ""sociopath"", comes across as quite inept in several scenes although this hardly makes him sympathetic.  The boyfriend, on the other hand, seems off-kilter, struggling to keep himself together even when it is vital for him to do so.  It is this push-and-pull, this chronic uncertainty that gives the film its drive.  Naturally, the subtitles distract - I speak French and the translations are not quite accurate - but the acting is effective and natural and the direction never seems to waiver.  The conclusion could perfectly reasonably seem like a disappointment but one of the themes here is realism.  Ultimately, a sober and bleak affair but that is, really, what crime is.
