417986,5,6302036852,"I never thought I would see this movie released on DVD.  And if I did I would have guessed it would have been ultra bare bones.  But I have to say, this release was pretty good.

The movie itself is a fun, cheap 80's flick, with some better special effects than a normal movie of this caliber would have.  The acting is decent.  The script is campy, but fast paced enough.  The characters are okay, and work well within the story, and the direction is actually pretty good, considering how cheap this movie was.  Watching this movie made me realize how different the B-Movie market was then.  Now you get a movie with almost no style, and a lot of point and shoot direction.  The movies now usually look like they were filmed in someones back yard (and probably were), and had his neighbors do the acting.  Then you had a movie that had decent direction, actual working actors, and some minor semblance of dignity.  Over all the movie is an 7/10.  It's pretty good, but needed a little work in the final act.

The disc for Chopping Mall is actually way better than the price, or cheap cover art would let on.  For starters, the extras are actually decent, with an informative documentry on the making of the KillBots, which then goes in to the production on the film a bit.  Why Lions Gate went and did this, I don't kno, but I'm glad they did.  It's a nice extra, which is informative.  There is also a commentary, which I haven't listened to.  But the fact that Lions Gate even bothered is a plus in there case.  You also get the theatrical trailer to the film.  The picture for the disc, while somewhat soft, is very good.  I mean, the movie is old, and the original prints are probably damaged, so the fact that the movie looks as good as it does is a major plus.  It is full frame, but I don't think this movie was shot in Wide Screen, so nothing wrong there.  The audio is very good, clear, and with almost no distortion or drop outs.  It also is nice that the disc is about 14 dollars.  A fairly cheap price for a very well made disc.

I recomend the film, and even more now that the DVD is out, and turned out so well.",1092873600,18,2126,4.265664160401003
417987,4,6302036852,"Though it is a bare-bones DVD release of Chopping Mall, it is still worth the $6.00 - $10.00. Chopping Mall is good 80s horror. Not great, not bad. You are introduced to some lame characters and a pretty bland plot which is very normal for a horror movie around this time. But just watching a group of sex-hungry, dorky teens running around a mall during 1986 trying not to get their heads blown off by a few big and bulky security robots is extremely entertaining. The kills/deaths don't offer up much more than what has already been done in horror at this point in time. But the movie doesn't focus too much of it's attention to the killing, but more on the teens trying to escape and find a way to fight back against the robots. Like I said, good 80s horror, you won't have to use your thinking cap. My only gripe is that there are no special features worth looking at. I would have at least liked to see something from Roger Corman maybe explaining the craze for horror movies in the late 70s - early 90s.

Special features aside, Chopping Mall is worth the price to own on DVD and is a very worthy entry into your horror collection.",1092528000,5,1137,4.363207547169812

well. A group of young people sneak into a shopping mall to stay all night. The security in the mall is handled by some mobile robots. These robots malfunction and begin killing the teenagers who are in the mall. These security robots even shoot lasers with their eyes. The special effects used on the robots make them even
more menacing. The night of fun turns into a night of total horror

very fast paced movie. The action in this movie is nonstop as well. This is a movie that you will enjoy.",1047168000,,621,4.316239316239316
417991,4,6302036852,"Picture Dawn of the Dead with the horde of zombies replaced with three homicidal security robots....OK, so it's not that cool, but still entertaining nonetheless.
At least this movie has the 80's slasher movie staples:  teenagers, beer, nudity, and killers.  Although, I would have enjoyed this movie more if the killer was a homicidal janitor or crazy drifter.  The robots add a science fiction element to this movie that should not have been done.  I was really enjoying some of the creative killings in this movie until the robots started shooting lasers from they 'eyes'.  Pretty far fetched for 2003, forget 1985.
But all in all it still manages to fit in well with the 80's horror genre, and bravo to the makers for taking a chance on this one.  If you like 80's slasher flicks (even if it is just for the flagrant nudity and the 80's nostalgia), then you will like this one too, just don't forget to grab a sixer and a pizza.",1046044800,,932,4.5843373493975905

This movie is a great edition to anyones collection of low budget horror films of the eighties. In ""Chopping Mall"", a shopping centre purchases new security robots in order to keep the mall safe from intruders. However, a group of friends decided to hide out in the shopping centre one night and have a big party. Little do they know that the robots are malfunctioning and start to run rampage around the mall, killing everyone they encounter. The special effects are top notch for the year it was made and the one liners the robots have are extreamly funny. Unfortuantly, the movie runs out of steam towards the end, however the shear coolness (is that a word) of the robots make this movie a definite 4 star rating.",996537600,,842,4.657718120805369

The film does have a large amount of nude scenes, but to me that's kind of a horror cliche. And to be expected. While I won't say it's a great movie, it's an enjoyable film to pass the time.

I love everything about this movie!  The group decide to misbehave after work and boy do they ever pay for it.  The security robots are struck by lightning--now this happened in another 80's movie and the plot went in a completely different direction--but I digress.  The lightning strike causes the robots to go all Cyberdyne Systems on humans.  Now the group, who has just been engaging in premarital sex and alcohol [are we sure Jason Voorhees hasn't been invited to the mall?!] have to find a way to make it through a locked-down mall and get to the parking garage where they can drive to safety, all while trying to dodge killer robots.

Now you're thinking, ""This sounds awesome?"" BUT WAIT; THERE'S MORE! You've got a cameo from Mr. Fudderman, Kelli Maroney who survived an earth ending comet, and Alan from Head of the Class, not to mention a camp counselor who was slaughtered in Friday the 13th, Part 2 (spoiler alert, it doesn't work out for him in this one either.)",1483574400,14,1190,4.6650717703349285

418712,4,6302036852,"BOTTOM LINE: A fun old school slasher flick... without the slasher. The whole movie just screams 80's! And that's okay. The film moves along at a breakneck pace and the various kills are fun & pretty imaginative. The guys & gals are 1-dimensional stereotypes, but that's half the fun of these kinds of films. Fans of CHOPPING MALL are in for a treat because this Blu-ray release is fully loaded with TONS of great bonus content. Movie: 4 STARS; Blu-ray: 5 STARS

THE STORY (contains spoilers): Mega shopping mall is set to debut a high-tech security system in the form of three state-of-the-art robots designed to patrol the complex and quickly - but humanely - apprehend any intruders. Meanwhile, a handful of teens working at various stores throughout the mall have made plans to stay after hours and party it up. But soon after closing, a fierce electrical storm accidentally short-circuits the 'bots master control... and the gnarly party-hearty teens suddenly find themselves targeted by the trio of relentless, now-lethal automatons and hunted without mercy. Will any of them survive the night??

THOUGHTS: Perhaps director Jim Wynorski's best film. The actors have good chemistry together, the setting inside the darkened sprawling mall works to create a familiar yet alien nightmare world, while some top notch F/X work on the part of robot designer & engineer Robert Short give us three automated villains that present a genuine, very believable threat. (The film also has the distinction of featuring one of the greatest exploding head gags in cinematic history, second only to the original SCANNERS.) CHOPPING MALL's deadly robots are a tribute to the classic 1954 3D film GOG, and they work beautifully, surprising for such a low budget film. CHOPPING MALL would make a perfect middle feature for a ""killer robot"" trilogy home video marathon; right after GOG, then finishing up with the excellent though obscure (and highly under-rated) rampaging robot flick, 1995's EVOLVER.

THE BLU-RAY: Resurrecting the Vestron Video label was a brilliant idea. Many of us grew up scouring video store shelves for the latest VHS offering from this company, which usually promised, (and more often than not fully delivered), lots of gross-out gore, high speed car chases, sexy nude babes and plenty of bloody shoot 'em ups. Perfect viewing fare for those weekend parties at your friend's house. The picture & sound on this hi-def release of CHOPPING MALL are both quite solid. Despite the number of low light scenes in the film, it has a surprisingly good picture, with only minimal artifacting & pixelation. Soundmix is equally strong & level. The best part of this release, for fans of the film, is the wealth of excellent bonus features, including retrospective featurettes recount the making of the film, the F/X and other behind-the-scenes goodies, three (!) separate full-length audio commentary tracks to listen to, an isolated musical score option... and more! All in all, a first-rate release. Let's hope that more great old titles surface soon from the Vestron video library, and that they each receive the same level of loving care as CHOPPING MALL has.",1483315200,13,3162,5.100386100386101
418713,4,6302036852,"The cult classic Chopping Mall is finally on BD thanks to the Vestron Video line. This was an interesting horror film & one I had never seen until I bought the BD. The premise is different when compared to other horror films from the 80s in that the killers are robots. Basic premise is a group of people get locked in a mall after hrs, the robot security malfunctions & start hunting & killing them off. Some of the sfx like the robot lasers were obviously low budget but some of the kill sfx were too bad at all. The cast is decent as well, nothing really great but ok for the type of film it is. I was surprised that I enjoyed this more then I thought I would. If you are a fan of 80s horror films id definitely recommend checking out Chopping Mall.

418715,5,6302036852,"The review is for the Vestron Video.

If you're a fan of retro action than you must pick this up.  This is 80's cheese perfected. The acting, hair styles, bubble gum snapping, retro 80's synth music, etc...

The plot is pure 80's. Kids having sex in a mall that is being protected by rogue killer robots.

The picture quality is excellent! It does have a few specks here and there with some grain but that is to be expected with a movie like this. In fact, I prefer to keep that vintage look.

The audio is as good as it can be at mono. I watched the film using my $400 Astro A40's and it sounded great.

The special features were great as well. For such a low budget film, I wasn't expecting much in this section but Vestron proved me wrong. It's loaded with extras with an amazing piece called Back to the Mall.

This is a no a brainer, buy it now before you regret it. It's a limited run and will eventually be 5 times more on ebay. You may think it's pretty pricey at $29.99 but you have to realize these movies don't have a huge following. They cant just make millions of copies at $12.99 like Twilight or Harry Potter.",1480118400,,1124,4.2

But that doesn't take into  account the plans of the mall owners, to start using robots to guard and protect the mall. Also, the plans of the robots, to kill all humans.

Soon the young group is racing, hiding, and fighting to survive.

The film stars the likes of Kelli Maroney (Night of the Comet and Fast Times At Ridgemont High) and Barbara Crampton (Re-Animator and From Beyond).

And the place is ferociously guarded by 3 malfunctioning robots on a dark and stormy night.  They have a shoot to kill policy (which is quite severe.  It definitely lessens any chance of promotion, whether you get caught for partying in your place of employment or not).  The cast is neatly divided into couples.  Obviously, they make bad `life' altering decisions.  Of course, the phones are dead.  Isn't nearly everything.  They have to jerry rig a means of defense.  One learns that a pet store is not the safest place to hide (snakes if you've got them, spiders too).

I love this dopey variation on a slasher flick.  It's pretty basic as far as the plot goes (a small group is trapped and hunted down by robots that were only supposed to be equipped with Tasers and tranquillizer guns.  The lasers must have been an upgrade that no one bothered to mention).  Naturally, not everyone makes it out alive.  But, cooler heads prevail over those that lose theirs.

One by one the three robots try to rid the mall of the teenage intruders. Chaos ensues and few will leave this party alive.

There you have the premise for Chopping Mall, one of the best named slashers of the 80s, and one of the best premises too. Chopping Mall is the kind of movie that couldn't have been made in any time except the 1980s. Killer robot security guards taking over a mall by night? Sound like a good time? It does to me. The beauty of a cheesy horror movie like Chopping Mall is that you will either buy into this wacky, overblown premise or you wont. Chances are that if you are in the mood to rent or buy a movie called Chopping Mall, you will probably have a good time with it. The film is a camp delight from beginning to end with just enough laughs and gore to make the whole thing watchable. Is this great cinema? Heck no. Can you do a lot worse than this little gem of a slasher flick? You bet.

Oh and I neglected to tell you dear readers the very best part of this film.its 78 minutes long. Thats right.

Did I mention this is a Roger Corman production? Mired in the trappings of every bad direct-to-video slasher to ever burst upon the scene in the 1980s, it's deliciously, laughably awful. Although they produce sounds on par with a blender set to puree every time they're on-screen, these bots are able to routinely sneak up on their unsuspecting prey throughout the film, slinking like cats through the night. They're far from intimidating, with bulky tank treads and tiny little T-Rex arms to spin and clap for no particular purpose, but I suppose the kids' fear of them is somewhat justified after seeing a friend's head turned to mash by a well-placed laser shot. Crammed full of stupid decisions, silly special effects, well-glazed acting and tits, tits, tits, it's got everything you'd expect from the genre and the period... except chopping.

418863,4,6302036852,"There's nothing iconic about this bad 80s sci-fi/horror and I'm not saying it should be on your ""must see list.""  But this has everything I miss about the 80s; it's so awful and cheesy and cheap and campy, and that's what makes it so sweet to the refined horror connoisseur.

""Eight teenagers are trapped after hours in a high tech shopping mall and pursued by three murderous security robots out of control.""  [--IMDB]  This was originally titled Killbots.  That title would have made more sense since the present title makes me think of a slasher movie.

The very first night that a mall breaks in its new security team of three robots, lightning strikes the control center and somehow short circuits theminto killer robots.  That same night eight 20-somethings decide to have an overnight sex party in the mallbecause that's what kids did in the 80s, they had overnight sex parties.  I struggle to envision that any teenagers or 20-somthings would have died in any 80s horror movies if there were no overnight sex parties.

Well after one of the security robots detonates one of their hotties' heads with its laser vision, and thus ruins their overnight sex party, the men furiously hit the sporting goods store, load up on guns and propane tanks and fight back!  What ensues is a lot of fun, bad nonsense.  In fact, everything leading up to that was a lot of fun, bad nonsense, too.

Let's talk about these robots for a second.  They look like mini-Johnny-5's complete with videogame laser gun vision and what are called ""sleep darts.""  I wonder how much these robots cost to make.  If AI-robotic security sounds a little excessive for your average mall in Ohio, please note the obviously moderately priced time-locked Star Wars doors which are sealed shut over night.  What's with this mall?  It's like a military tech experiment!

The overnight party crew of 20-somethings include a lot of familiar faces: Allison (Kelli Maroney; Night of the Comet, Not of this Earth), Suzie (Barbara Crampton; You're Next, Lords of Salem, The Re-Animator), Rick (Russell Todd; Friday the 13th Part 2), Linda (Karrie Emerson; Evils of the Night), Ferdy (Tony O'Dell; Evils of the Night), Leslie and Mike (John Terlesky; Deathstalker II).  Also look for Mr. Bud the CHUD himself Gerrit Graham (Child's Play 2, It's Alive III, TerrorVision) and Gremlins' Dick Miller (Piranha, The Howling, The Twilight Zone: The Movie).

To call the writing a bit stale would almost be a compliment.  The poor attempts at humor in this movie succeed at little more than securing the bad name earned by 80s horror writers.  Thankfully, we find our humor in some of the kills.

Director Jim Wynorski used the success of this film to pole vault his career into the big leagues.  He later went on to helm such classy films as Deathstalker II (1987), Not of this Earth (1988), Return of Swamp Thing (1989), The Haunting of Morella (1990), 976-EVIL II (1992), Ghoulies IV (1994) and many more.

418885,4,6302036852,"Chopping Mall has always been one of my personal favorite 80's horror films. Don't get me wrong, it is definitly cheesy, and those looking for quality cinema will probably snub their noses at it, but people who love 80's horror films (and all the cheese that goes with it) will definitly have alot of fun with this one. The story (which is very thin of course) centers around a group of friends who stay overnight in a furniture store inside their local mall to basically party and have sex. Soon enough the malls guard robots go nuts, and the friends have to find a way to survive the night and get out of the mall in one piece. Running a short 76 minutes, Chopping Mall gives the audience what they expect and nothing more. It's a fast paced film with action, a bit of sex/nudity, and a bodycount. Those looking for something more should probably avoid, but fans of this genre will most likely enjoy it like I always have. The directing by Jim Wynorski is pretty basic, but he knows how to keep the film fun, and doesn't ever let it get dull. The acting is ok, and the characters are all mostly likable. Kelli Maroney and Tony O Dell play our leads, and you'll know that the moment you see them. They're a bit quieter, don't have sex, and look slightly geeky. They fit the 80's horror film leads very well. Everyone else are walking robot targets. There's the horny just married couple played by Russell Todd and Kari Emmerson. They're almost lead worthy, and a bit generic. There's the hornier couple played by Nick Segall and Barbara Crampton (Re Animator fans will enjoy seeing Crampton in this), and the horniest couple played by John Terlesky and Suzee Slater (who both look like the they could be in a 80's porn version of this film as well). It seems the hornier you are in the film, the faster the robots want to take aim and fire. Speaking of the robots, they look ok. Passable and cheesy, but nothing more. The film also features cameos from Dick Miller (Gremlins, The Terminator), Paul Bartel and Mary Woronov ( Reprising their roles from Eating Raoul), and Angus Scrimm (though you'll definitly have to look hard to spot him). As for the carnage? We get a bit of gore (head exploding scene), and a bodycount. Not much else to say. It isn't really that gory.

The dvd of Chopping Mall is sadly only ok. It looks like a decent vhs transfer (it's very much watchable, but the film really could use a blu ray release), and the extras that go with it are only ok too. You do get a director's commentary which is nice, a brief featurette, and the films trailer.

If you don't like horror films (80's cheesy ones in particular) then avoid it of course, but its definitly worth a watch for fans.",1371513600,3,2701,4.465587044534413

I was a 6-year old 1st grade student back in 1987 when I first watched this, and since then every so often I've been occasionally thinking ""What IS the name of that movie where the robots walk through a shopping mall and kill people?""  The internet is truly my friend with all the answers!

Through the coldest of winters, the roughest of flu symptoms, the swimming pool adventures of summer, the long spring walks through the fields and forest in front of and around my house... all these activites occurred for the last 25 years while remembering this movie.  I was wondering if the day would ever come when I'd ever actually be able to see it again.  All I ever remembered is the girl in her panties soothingly running for her life and getting killed by a laser beam-shooting robot in front of her friends who were watching it happen on the other side of the door.  The answer my friends, is yes.  Tonight I returned and...

Well truth be told, it's pretty dated now.  No longer are these robots very threatening whether because I'm an adult now, or since several action films from the 80's have not aged particularly well I'm afraid.  This is one of them.  These robots turn vicious at night, and they have NO mercy whatsoever.  This group of young adults made a horrible mistake picking this shopping mall as a party zone.  However there's one scene where a couple dozen laser beams blast all around this one guy who is standing RIGHT in target range!  How did those robots miss?

There's not much in the way of actual chopping- more like laser beams and gas explosions.  Despite the poor acting and writing, there's still that appealing element of cheesiness that makes this movie watchable for comical reasons and that's why I'm giving it a 3 out of 5.  I like Chopping Mall (especially the name).  It's just not as dangerous as it used to be which places this movie in the same category as Robocop.",1353456000,,1976,4.533898305084746

However, this particular mall has modernized to the point of utilizing security robots to monitor and keep the mall safe.

This means especially bad news for the group of teens who have decided to party it up after hours, unaware of the danger that lurks among them.

Kelli Maroney, fresh off of another mall adventure in ""Night of the Comet,"" plays the survivor girl amongst a cast of other well-knowns (well, to '80s slasher/b-movie fans at least). Joining her for a chopping spree are Barbara Crampton (""Re-Animator""), Russell Todd (""Friday the 13th Pt. 2), and of course, Dick Miller, without whom, no '80s horror film would be complete. The plot is pretty cut and dry, and the film -- clocking in at about 75 minutes -- doesn't waste any time whatsoever. Within the first fifteen minutes, the killbots are electrocuting a bitter janitor and blowing the heads off of shallow teenage girls. From there, it's up to the remaining group of teenagers to find resourceful ways of dispatching of their would-be terminators.  Throughout all the shenanigans, Wynorski tries to keep a certain level of tension, but can't help but give in to sheer campiness in the end. The blatantly low budget doesn't help matters much, and in the end, the film is played for laughs more than anything.

While admittedly low on substance, ""Chopping Mall"" is exactly the kind of b-flick you put in when you want to drift away with a few drinks and have a good time. In spite of its short-comings (which inevitably give the film its charm), its heart is in the right place and it will never bore even the most jaded of '80s slasher buffs.

While most of the kills are pretty unremarkable, CHOPPING MALL gives DEADLY FRIEND a run for its money when a stray laser beam competes for the 'Best Head Explosion in an 80's Film' award. If the outdated fashion and big hair weren't enough to give away the film's age, the cornball humor and synthesized score will certainly do the trick. Horror fans will be happy to see a number of recognizable faces, including Roger Corman favorite Dick Miller and scream queen Barbara Crampton in a pair of brief cameos. Even at its worst, CHOPPING MALL is still an entertaining popcorn movie with enough killer robot mayhem to please the average Slasher fan!

In a move sure to anger mall security guards worldwide, the managers of this mall have decided to replace the old security staff with three super-keen robots with all kinds of nifty weapons and tools tailor-made for stopping and detaining any hooligan who dares to invade the sanctity of the mall after closing time.  These ""Protectors"" are all like fast-moving little tanks equipped with lasers, claws, sleep darts, and other assorted goodies.

If you learn nothing else from this movie, just be assured that you should not plan a big after-hours party inside your uncle's furniture store on the same night as security robots are first given the run of the whole mall, especially if the geeky designer of said robots assures everyone that nothing could possibly go wrong - this is particularly important if huge security doors are set to lock everything and everyone inside until daybreak the next morning.  Nothing ruins a night of partying and fornication like seeing a partially clothed teenager get her head blown off by a robot laser weapon (unless you're in to that sort of thing, I guess).  Once something like that happens, you can pretty much forget about seeing any more nudity that night.

The kids who find themselves terrorized by the killer robots in this film aren't particularly engaging, but at least they try to go out fighting (although you would think that they would figure out that guns aren't effective against the killer robots after the first hundred or so shots do no damage whatsoever).  Frankly, I didn't care about any of them apart from the one played by Barbara Crampton, but that was only because she looks like a young Donna Mills.  That being said, I couldn't really cheer for the robots either - let's face it, ""Thank you.  Have a nice day"" just doesn't cut it as a killer robot catchphrase.  I kept hoping they would start chanting ""Exterminate!"" or something, but that never happened.  Despite the blandness of the bots, though, this still turned out to be a pretty fun film to watch - and at just 77 minutes in length, it doesn't overstay its welcome.

With so many choices out there why not go for a film that seemed to be just like the episode of Saved By the Bell where the crew camps out in the mall on night. You can't go wrong with a concept as b as that. Have to say Chopping Mall through us for quite a loop since we didn't read up on what it was actually about, hence the title. Thinking it would be the run of the mill 80's slasher proved to be wrong once a gang of killer robots appeared. Yeah awesome.

So our story obviously takes place in a mall where a bunch of teens who work there decide to stay past closing hours to throw a party and have a sexy time in some display beds. Once they're locked in they come to meet the new security, which happens to be a few robots that look like a cross breed between Paulie's in Rocky IV and Screech's only friend Max. They only issue is these robots seek and destroy anything moving and take aim at the gang of super 80's teens. They take a couple out with some hilarious laser graphics that must have been world renowned for the time. The film goes on with the kids trying to find a way to get out of the mall or stay alive until it opens up again in the morning.

For us Chopping Mall was worthy of a four star rating due to it's extreme 80's horror feel. Can't say it was scary in any sense at any point, but thought it was simply hilarious as the killer robots took aim at the over sexed kids. It's quite funny how the mall was the place to be back then, especially to base an entire film around it. We have to say despite the horrid acting and special effects the film did present a pretty original idea in a time saturated with slasher flicks. For some this film will be a complete waste unless you go into it with the right state of mind. As long as you know it's a bout killer robots, you should be fully ready to have a great laugh instead of a good scare.

Exciting and enjoyable 80's Sci-fi horror action thriller that puts in a ""Dawn of the Dead""-style shopping mall terror frenzy with a bit of ""Terminator"" thrown in. The acting is decent for a b-movie while the robot and splatter effects are quite excellent including that memorable exploding head sequence done on Crampton of ""Re-Animator"" fame, i also likw how it takes the slasher genre on Sci-fi level much like the first Terminator movie did and even offers an appearence by Dick Miller.

418971,3,6302036852,"Chopping Mall (Jim Wynorski, 1986)

Pretty standard Corman-produced fare from the mid-eighties. It's the year 2000, and the world is still shopping-mall centered. (And oh, yeah, fashion and slang haven't changed since the mid-eighties, either. Fascinating!) A security company have just instituted the latest and greatest in security technology--security robots aimed at keeping the burglar population down and not needing to pay human guards. ""It's foolproof"", the security consultant says. ""What could go wrong?"" Famous last words. Eight mall employees have an after-hours party in the furniture store during a lightning storm that (of course) short-circuits the system. We first realize something's wrong when one of the robots kills a janitor. The kids, of course, are still blissfully unaware. But that will soon change!

It's your typical Corman-factory crap, but if you're looking for a slasher film with a couple of variations on the usual theme, Chopping Mall will fill the bill. It's not entirely awful, Barbara Crampton gets in some gratuitous nudity (I think exposing her breasts was part of her standard contract, something for which we should all be thankful), and Wynorski (who also co-wrote the script) and Corman bring back some characters from earlier Corman films for an amusing twist on the whole meta thing years before it got popular. All in all, a surprisingly unstupid Corman flick, especially considering Wynorski (whose greatest achievement to date has been the Bare Wench Project series) was at the helm. ** ",1228608000,,1535,5.360995850622406

418973,4,6302036852,"The Park Plaza Mall security has just gone high tech, leaving its unsuspecting mall shoppers dying to get out,they just don't know it yet. This new breed of mechanical security guard has been created and recruited specifically to be the new ""night watchman"" for the Park Plaza Shopping mall. After a series of freak electrical strikes and short circuits to the computers main system all hell breaks loose and the shopping mall has now become the ""Chopping Mall"". Those unfortunate to be locked in are in for a deadly surprise. Due to a number of power surges the mechanical menaces have now powered up on their own to become ""Killbots"". Once activated the ""Killbots"" only objective is to kill mall intruders by any means possible and most of the deaths are carried out in gruesome fashion.

I really enjoyed this typical 1980's teenage B slasher flick and it's definitely worth a look for fans of this genre. Four pairs of horny teenage mall workers come up with an idea to have a party in the malls furniture and bedding store for some teenage fun and frolic after the malls shoppers have cleared out. It doesn't take long for the killing to begin because the ""Killbots"" soon discover the teenager's party playground and their fun and frolic quickly turns to all out fear. Faced with no other alternative the teenagers decide to band together to fight their way past the ""Killbots"" to escape the ""Chopping Mall"" and not become the ""killbots"" next victim.

This movie has a little bit of everything featuring Nudity, sexual situations and plenty of carnage. As for the movie itself its pretty good and the audio and video transfer is pretty decent although a little dark and mirky in some spots. Lions Gate films has included some nice bonus features in this DVD release making it worth the money. Welcome to the Chopping mall where there slashing their prices and their customers, it could cost you an arm and a leg, maybe even your head. Is it possible to lose your head over a little shopping, you'll have to watch to find out. I give this film four stars for pure 80's fun.

418974,3,6302036852,"From the high-tech computerized wizardry and robotics of the 1980's, comes Chopping Mall. The basic plot is simple; a shopping mall purchases three security robots to roam the mall during nightly closed hours. All intruders will be zapped via stun gun wires. Workers such as security guards and janitors must simply show an ID to the robots who answer ""Thank you, have a nice day."" Unfortunately, during a lightning storm, the main computer gets zapped by a bolt of lightning and the robots go on a killing spree.

Typical horny 80's teenagers, who are a must in films like these, try to stop the killer robots with guns, propane tanks, paint, and road flares. I recognized one of the dudes as 'Scott' from Friday the 13th Part II.

There are some decent kills and a cute blonde goes up in flames, so it isn't a total waste of time, but I don;t see myself popping this in the DVD player on a regular basis. But for fans of 80's flicks, though this is not ground breaking, belongs in your collection.",1203897600,2,999,4.544444444444444
418975,4,6302036852,"It is what it is. A good movie for those who like horror,but different horror. I like the movie because it has robots instead of people doing the killing. And I grew up in the 80's so I like these type of movies. Not alot of people will probably like this movie. However,I liked it.",1194480000,,282,4.1454545454545455
418976,5,6302036852,"I first saw this one on cable back in the 80's. It is just as much fun now as it was back then. Fresh, creative, original, and oh-so-cheesy. I also met Kelli Maroney and Tony O'Dell a few years ago, what a blast. The casting is great, and the acting ranges from mediocre to very good. The special effects, for the time this film was done, are very good. Kelli and Tony do an excellent job, and another standout performance, in my opinion, comes from John Terlesky. If you're a fan of the genre, you should not miss this one.",1162166400,7,524,4.25
419015,5,6302036852,"I think my favorite scene in chopping mall is when they get into the sporting goods store and conveniently find an arsenal of weapons and ammo on display right in the front of the store.  This way, the customers can load up the guns and try them out without having to wait for some lazy manager to get them out of the locked glass case behind the counter.  In my opinion, put the guns & ammo right up front with the golf clubs & baseball gloves just like they do in TEH Chopping mall!  I give it 5 stars for awesomely bad dialogue, awesomely bad special effects, feathered 80's hair for the dudes, and big big big permed 80's hair for the seriously hawt actresses.",1160092800,3,664,4.296
419016,3,6302036852,"I saw this movie on cable the other day.  This movie reminds me of everything I miss about movies from the 80's.  It feels good to watch them because they're so awfully cheesy.  Especially this film.  The robots look like they were left over from a low-budget 50's sci-fi film.  As other reviewers have mentioned, they never actually chop anyone, but giving this movie a lesser rating because of the misleading title is just plain silly!  How could you take anything about this movie seriously from a critical standpoint?
  This movie is full of bad editing and awesomely bad one-liners.  One of the scenes that makes me laugh is when the studly jock dude just gets done humping the blonde babe.  He rolls over and he's chewing gum to add coolness.  In bed during sex seems a little out of place for gum chewing.  He must be extra cool.  In fact, he's so cool he dies chewing it a few minutes later.
  A good one-liner is when the kids are shooting at this open gas tank trying to blow up one of the killbots.  No one seems to be able to spark the gas despite multiple gunshots.  But then, the ""nerd turned badass"" blonde steps forward and takes one shot, blowing the killbot to smithereens.  She steps back and blows on her gun bragging, ""My dad was a marine.""
  This movie is great to sit back and make fun of with someone.  It doesn't really matter whether you pay attention or not.  The storyline and characters have been copied since the beginning of bad horror flicks.  It's another piece of dried-up 80's cinema excramite.  Enjoy!",1143072000,10,1537,4.505454545454546
419017,4,6302036852,"Some horror movies are meant to scare the pants off of you. Some horror movies try to scare the pants off of you, and other horror movies realize they really have no hope of scaring the pants off of you, and just try to be a fun movie. Chopping Mall is one of those movies.

I always look for three things in a slaher/horror movie. One, is the acting up to par, and is the movie well made? Secondly, are the death sequences cool, and believable? Lastly, does the ending deliever?

Chopping mall does well in the first category. It is fun, has that cool 80's mall feel to it and the actors do a rather good job. The ""cool guy"" of the movie chews gum like a cow chewing cud, so you're not to upset when he goes. The other actors all do a great job of running, screaming and coming up with ways to destroy the robots. The robots do an excellent job of scooting around and dispelling intruders with their lasers and tazers. (Their laser sound is right out of the original War of the Worlds movie)

Chopping mall, chops up the death sequences into cool and believable bits. This movie has one of the coolest sequences ever, when the blond bombshell, (I'd go into the mall and buy her a pack of cigs too...) loses her head, when running away from the ""bots"". I watched it in slow motion to see how they did it but I can't figure it out. The rest of them are pretty traditional deaths, but they are all believeable and unique.

The last part of the horror movie for me is the ending. Chopping mall ends pretty well. It's pretty exciting, and fairly tense, believeable and it wraps up the story of the movie.

This movie isn't one you want to watch to be terrified. This is a movie you watch with a bunch of friends, make fun of, laugh at and generally have a good time. It entertains, and brings a cheesy smile to your face. If you like cheesy movies, and are looking for some to add to your collection, then purchase this one.",1138579200,2,1920,4.249315068493151
419018,4,6302036852,"Yes, CHOPPING MALL is a dumb and deceiving title for this movie. KILLBOTS (the original title) is superior and more truthful. At any rate, I like this one a lot. The idea of killer robots chasing kids trapped in a mall after hours, is my kind of story! Plus, I get to see one of my favorite 80s horror babes, Barbara Crampton (Re-Animator, From Beyond, Castle Freak) running around screaming and bursting into flames! CM has plenty of action, humor, nudity, and violence. The cameos of Paul Bartel, Mary Woronov, and Dick Miller are cool. Also, there's ""Peckinpah's Sporting Goods"" (loaded w/ artillery of course), and ""Roger's Little Shop Of Pets"" in the mall! So, if you drool over killer robots and / or Barbara Crampton like I do, then this is the perfect DVD purchase!

419020,4,6302036852,"I have to admit with guilty pleasure that this one of my favorite slasher films from the 1980's.  I think the fact that it's a bit of sci-fi laced with horror that makes it unique.  Rather than the typical psycho with a butcher knife or chainsaw, we get a group of security robots who go berserk when the computer that controls them malfunctions and attack people with laser beams.  Originally entitled Killbots, Chopping Mall takes place in a mall of course where the usual horny teenagers are up to their usual teenage hijinks.

The teens have stayed in the mall after hours to hold a party, not knowing the new security robots are on thw prowl.  A lightning storm causes the computer to malfunction and the robots to go bonkers.  The kids are doing the usual, partying, smoking, having sex, etc...but then begin to wander off and eventually meet up with the robots and get killed in fairly brutal but not all that gory style.  The kids soon find themselves under attack and on the run trying to avoid the three robots on the various mall levels.

Okay, maybe it's a bit cheesy.  The bots don't move all that fast and you'd think it would be small problem to avoide them but who cares.  I think what appeals to me about the movie is that the idea of being in a mall after hours has always been one that has intrigued kids.  We probably all that it would be pretty cool when we were teens.

The film was just the second to be directed by Jim Wynorski who has since gone onto become one of the great ""B"" movie directors with films like: ""Sorority House Massacre II"", ""Ghoulies IV"", ""Vampirella"", and many more.  The film starred Kelli Maroney who had been in Fast Times at Ridgemont High and The Night of the Comet.

All in all a pretty good little film",1124064000,,1753,4.420560747663552
419021,4,6302036852,"A group of 20 year-olds throw a party inside a mall after hours.  The mall's new killbot security force doesn't take too kindly to these hormone overdosing no gooders running around half-dressed, so they start blasting everybody with lasers.  That's right, lasers.  There's never any actual ""chopping"".  Maybe a little head exploding, but no chopping.  Even though the movie itself doesn't live up to it's gruesome cover art CHOPPING MALL is still fun in a nostalgic 80's kind of way.

Would make a perfect double feature with the 1973 thriller TRAPPED about James Brolin locked in a department store overnight with six vicious Dobermans!

If the mall in CHOPPING MALL looks familiar it's because it's the Sherman Oaks Galleria which was also featured in TERMINATOR 2, COMMANDO, FAST TIMES AT RIDGEMONT HIGH and PHANTOM OF THE MALL.

419024,3,6302036852,"Critics can debate the merits of Chopping Mall coming to DVD and philosophers can wonder why it exists at all, but for whatever reason, here it is.

They kept the original box art, which does not actually represent anything in the movie (maybe it was part of the original concept but the budget didn't allow it to be realized...maybe an artist drew it up after the fact because the actual robots in the movie weren't scary looking...which came first, the chicken or the egg?).  The title ""Chopping Mall"" is also misleading.  It does take place in a mall (reminiscent of Dawn of the Dead), but there's not much of any ""chopping"" (the kills are mostly from killbot lasers).  It reminds me of when Problem Child came out and the promotional displays showed a cat being put in a washing machine...but it never happened in the movie.  Advertisers and marketers and promoters make us want things like ""Chopping Mall""...even though many of us wouldn't want it if we knew what it was.

It's not a terrible movie.  Nude girls, gore, dumb dialogue, nonsensical plot developments...typical for 80s slashers.  Some humorous moments (intentional and unintentional), too.  But I found the fast forward feature useful during much of this movie.

There are only so many hours in a day, days in a year, and years in a life.  Why spend precious time watching Chopping Mall when there are so many thousands of other movies (and hundreds of 80s horror movies) that are at least as entertaining and moving?  I don't have an answer.  Chop till you drop, if it suits you.",1112227200,8,1548,4.731343283582089
419055,3,6302036852,"Good plot...the malls are tired of repeated roberies, so they manufacture a ""Killbot"" to patrol and apprehend any criminals after closing hours.  I like that.  Something different, which I fully expected would be better developed throughout the movie.

Unfortunatly, that was the end of the plot.  Normally, I love horror movies, regardless of what they are about.  This one, however, was a little tougher to watch.  I just couldn't stop thinking about all the holes; and, again that is normally not my style.  My first big question regarding this movie is: How are the robots able to kill people????

At the start of the movie, we are told by a salesman for the ""Killbots"" that they are equipped with a sleeping dart that ""would put any man to sleep in no less than 30 minutes""

That was the only defense these things were manufactured with.  Where did their lasers come from???

Where did their ability to spew plastic explosives come from???

I don't know, but it really irritated me throughout this film.  I'm also curious why they are called ""Killbots"" when they are not supposed to kill criminals.....

Please understand, I am not trying to put this movie down(It was enjoyable), these are simply what bothered me during my initial viewing.

The acting is as to be expected from a movie of this sort.  The score to the movie is pretty good, but bothered me only in the aspect that it gave away all suspense when the score would turn from regular background music to creepy, tense music.

The mall the movie is set in is awesome.  I totally remember shopping amlls that had pet stores and paint stores and smoke shops, etc...I only wish that malls today would go back to that format, rather than 25 cellphone stores and a food court that dominates the rest of the mall..

All in all, I guess I would have to gve this movie 3 stars.

1 for the creative plot

2 for the creative ways the ""Killbots"" kill

and

3 for the nudity and mall.

It loses two stars for using a propane tank repeatedly in efforts to kill the ""Killbots"" and for not building further on the plot.(I honestly feel this movie should have been a half-hour longer, with more at the beginning before the bots started killing).

Fun movie, check it out and let me hear what you thought!!",1109462400,9,2256,4.58
419056,4,6302036852,"An early example of cult director Jim Wynorski's work, Chopping Mall is one of those movies that you'll hate yourself for enjoying.  From the corny pun title and equally corny tagline - ""Where shopping can cost you an arm and a leg"" you pretty well know what to expect right from the start. Full of visual gags, wisecrack one-liners and cheeky references to other movies, Chopping Mall certainly stands up to repeated viewings so the viewer can extract every drop of twisted humour and irony.

Great to see a very young John ""Deathstalker 2"" Terleskey leading the youngsters' illicit partying. Ably supported by a couple of B-movie babes (great excuse for a bit of gratuitous nudity part way through), and Barbara Crampton as a real feisty kick-ass heroine, who stoicly puts up with everything from laser beams to tarantulas!  Also a brief cameo from Toni (the delicious Sultana in Deathstalker 2) Naples near the start.  Great pounding swirly synth soundtrack from Chuck Cirino (who also wrote the superb score for ..... you guessed it, Deathstalker 2!).

The real stars though are the killbots. Like some unholy cross between Robocop's ED-209 and Short-Circuit, these tracked monsters, equipped with lasers (audio and video hat tip to ""War of the Worlds""), tasers and nasty snapping pincers, patrol the mall at night looking for intruders.  After a lightning strike scrambles their program, the killbots start ...well killing - after politely greeting their victims and then wishing them a nice day of course! The killbots also run impressively quickly on their tracks - no lumbering zombies these!

Wynorsky gives us some inventive and spectacularly messy deaths, from victims electrocuted, thrown over balconies, punctured by robotic arms, necks sliced through, burned alive and, of course, the mandatory (and impressively gross) exploding head routine.

Whilst perhaps a tad tame by today's more brutal gore-fest standards, Chopping Mall remains a highly entertaining movie, with its charm lying in the fact that it never takes itself too seriously.

On the down side, the DVD picture quality is not brilliant though, appearing little better than VHS, and the audio is some very early incarnation of Dolby that falls far short of the 5.1 or DTS that the punters usually expect these days. Not much in the way of extras either - shame there's no director's commentary, as Wynorski is a fun guy and does a witty and entertaining commentary on Deathstalker 2.  Never mind though.

We all know this isn't Oscar material, but you could certainly do a lot worse than getting a few cans of beer in, watching this, then watching Deathstalker 2!",1108857600,,2641,5.06221198156682

We are in a mall with a handful of young adults with a teen-like behavior straight out of the 80's and of course it is the nerdy duo we care about most...the virgins.  The character development is not the greatest and the ending is abrupt, but I found this film to be extremely entertaining for a cheesy horror flick.  When it comes to my taste in horror...I love the good, bad and the crap in between...so of course this was a hit with me.  This is one of those horror films you can throw in the dvd player and watch for no reason at any time.

This dvd did not receive 5 stars because this dvd only comes with a short featurette on the killbots discussing how they were made and a little background on them.  I found the trailer to be most entertaining and wish that the movie had displayed what the trailer had...more gore with a cheesy twist!  I would have loved to have seen an arm attached to a shopping bag being drug around the mall...or more ""chopping"" to fit with the title.  This is why the creators should have run with the original title of ""Killbots!"" but it is understandable why titles must come out to make the film sound better (just like ""The Book of the Dead"" being renamed into ""Evil Dead"").  Only gore I can really remember was the head explosion but there are some parts that are great...just not real unique.

Shop 'til you drop...dead.

Some people would kill for a bargin. At Park Plaza they do.

They're slashing prices...and employies!

At Park Plaza you can save on everything but your life!

Thank God they finally released this one on DVD. I was really afraid it would just fade away in obscurity. This is one of the better dead teenager films from the 1980's, but one thing you should know, it's title and box cover isn't right at all for the film. There isn't one tenth as much gore in the actual film as shown on the front cover (the film's most gruesome moment is a very brief head explosion scene), and there's no actual chopping in it. I really wish they had gone with their alternate title, KILLBOTS, instead.

That having been said, this film rocks! Think of a cross between THE TERMINATOR and DAWN OF THE DEAD. (It also gives you a very good idea of what SHORT CIRCUT would have been like if the makers of that film had gone ahead with their origonal idea of making #5 go homicidal after being struck by lightning rather than becoming a curious, benevolent, wisecracking, loveable, mechanical version of E.T.)

Anyway. The plot is set in a time when robot technology has advance tremendously. Park Plaza mall has employed the Securetronics company to supply them with some of the latest, state-of-the-art security systems. A master computer is installed which during the night time activates three Protector robots that patrol the mall for burglers, and all the exits are sealed off by thick metal doors. The robots distinguish late night workers from intruders by scanning their identity badges.

Then one day eight young mall employies and their friends plan a late night party in one of the furnature stores (their plan being to start the party after the mall closes and be out shortly before the steal doors close). Unfortunately, that very night there is a lightning storm (again, just like in SHORT CIRCUT, which came out the same exact year as this film,) a bolt of lightning hits the generator on the roof, frying the circuts of the computer, and the malfunctioning machine is soon sending the three robots under it's control on a homocidal rampage, killing everyone in the store. After killing the two technitians and a janitor (B-movie vet Dick Miller), the robots go after the eight partyiers. Soon the steal doors close, locking the young people in. Now they must ether find and destroy the master computer (being low-ranking employies they don't know exactly where it's located,) or eles find some way to destroy the seemingly invincible robots, if they are to survive the night.

This movie has action, comedy, nudity, (of course) and one strong, smart, tough heroine in the form of Allison Parks, played by Kelli Maroney. I really liked her. She reminds me of Ripley in ALIEN or Sarah Connor in THE TERMINATOR. Check this one out.",1100736000,2,2901,4.7629482071713145
419061,4,6302036852,"Chopping Mall brings back memories of seeing its ridiculously cheesy poster up in local video stores as a kid.  The movie made appearances on the tube later, where I found it to be watchably bad, and kind of amusing.

This is basically an 80s formula movie, the kind of thing that goes straight to DVD now.  It's a combination slasher-Dawn of the Dead-Alien flick.  A shopping mall uses robots for night security, and of course, one night the things go haywire and go into Kill mode.  Naturally, the robots are equipped with some serious weaponry, a bit too serious for dealing with a ripoff at Footlocker.  Of course, a group of teenagers is trapped in the mall overnight, after hanging around after work to write their resumes for death (drinking, partying, sex, etc).

You know where it's going.  It could have been great, but there's a low gore factor.  In pales in comparison to other films set in shopping malls, namely Dawn of the Dead, a classic.  There's plenty of tongue-in-cheek indication, such as a cameo by Dick Miller, and the (hopefully) intentionally cheesy sound effects of the robot laser beams (could robots this advanced have been cheaper than hiring your typical mall cop?)

No accident that it's on DVD, fans of the esteemed killer robot in mall genre are well familiar with this films amusing wares.",1095206400,3,1323,4.784140969162996
419062,3,6302036852,"Having never seen Chopping Mall (1986) and knowing almost nothing about the film, the title conjured thoughts of a slasher film, a very popular and overused genre throughout the 80's, set in the confines of a shopping mall, a very popular destination in the 80's.  Had they stuck with the original title of Killbots, I may not have been so quick to assign my preconceptions to the film, but either way, this was a pretty fun film, if you are interested in 80's horror films with a side order of science fiction.

Co-written by Steve Mitchell, whose main credits include writing for the oh so 80's cartoons Jem! and Transformers, and Jim Wynorski (who also directed the film along with a plethora of sequels to other films including Big Bad Mama II (1987), The Return of Swamp Thing (1989), Sorority House Massacre II (1990), 976-EVIL 2: The Astral Factor (1991), among others...) features a cast that reads like a B-movie fan's dream, including Barbara Crampton (Re-Animator), Zoe Kelli Simon, aka Kelli Maroney, (Night of the Comet), Russell Todd (Friday the 13th Part 2),  Nick Segal (Breakin' 2: Electric Boogaloo), and Tony O'Dell, who also appeared in not only the first Karate Kid, but its' subsequent sucky sequel (love that Ralph Macchio...).  Also, making cameo appearances are B-movie legends Paul Bartel, Mary Woronov (playing the same characters they did in the film Eating Raoul), Gerrit Graham, as a technician (I most remember his part from the Kurt Russell film Used Cars (1980) but he's been in a ton of films), and Dick Miller, as a janitor named Walter Paisley, a name he's used for a number of characters in movies he's been in, going all the way back to original appearance as the name for the main character in the film A Bucket of Blood (1959).

The film begins with the introduction of sophisticated (well, sophisticated for the mid-80's, at least) robots designed to patrol the mall during the night, and immobilize and detain any intruders until the authorities arrive.  The robots, three of them, about 4 feet tall, feature a variety of weapons, including tasers, mechanical claws, explosives (for getting past barricades), and laser beams that shoot from their optical orifices.  Seems like they carry some pretty serious weaponry to deal with the occasional punk, but I theorize the robots were originally designed for the military, who then probably discontinued funding for the project, leaving the manufacturer to find uses for their investment in the private sector (this theory is never posed in the movie, but it would have gone a long way to justify the ordinance these things were packing).  Also, the robots worked in conjunction with an elaborate computer system that controls the doors, among others things, and, if an intruder is detected, it would notify the police.  The whole system is touted as completely safe and utterly fool proof, which means something will go wrong, seriously wrong, and result in quite a few deaths, or, at least that's what I was speculating at that point...sure enough, a lighting storm outside zaps something on the roof of the mall, causing a short circuit in the system, screwing up the robots' programming, switching them into `murder/death/kill' mode.  This does not bode well for the group of teenagers, most of whom work in the mall, who decided to stay past closing, drink beer, and do the nasty in a furniture store (nothing like getting your freak on in front of your peers).  Oh, but wait, not all decide to feed their desires, as one couple, the nerdiest of the bunch, refrain from nekkid time (gee, can you guess who makes it to the end of the film?)  Once the core group realizes they are trapped with three robotic conveyances of death, they equip themselves with weapons taken from a sporting goods store (handguns, shotguns, and even a semi-automatic M-16...man, that place has everything), and it's a fight to the finish...who will win?  Well, you'll just have to watch and see...

As I said, I enjoyed this film, and I think the thing I liked best was it didn't take itself too seriously.  There were a few tongue and cheek quips, and even a few nods to other films, for the attentive viewer (the `killbots' laser blast sounded suspiciously like the laser blasts from War of the Worlds (1953), and the line `klaatu barada nikto' from The Day the Earth Stood Still (1951)).  Gorehounds may be disappointed, but there is one memorable scene worth watching for as one individual suffers from exploding head syndrome after a shot to the noggin with a laser blast.  Also, if you are looking for some vintage 80's  nekkidness, there's a couple of scenes about a quarter of the way in involving a couple of the more buxom stars popping their tops...yowsa!  (alright, it seemed a bit gratuitous, but hey, we men are visual creatures...)  The story moves along pretty quickly once plot elements are established, and doesn't disappoint.  I felt the influence of The Terminator (1984) (the killer robot theme became quite popular after that), coming through here, but I don't think it was acknowledged in the commentary, although they did mention other films.  The robots, very dated now, actually are pretty good and feature some well-crafted details (they also moved very quickly on their treads).

What about the disc?  Well, it's pretty obvious that Lions Gate Entertainment used an existing video version for their transfer (watch until the end, and you see and ad for Lightning Video Films).  The movie is presented in full screen format, and I am unsure if that was the original format or not, but it looks pretty decent, despite some murkiness.  Special features include a commentary track by Wynorski and Mitchell, an original theatrical trailer, a worthwhile 16-minute featurette on the making of the killbots, and a good-looking photo gallery.  3  stars ( star off for funky transfer)

419063,1,6302036852,"I'm as passionate as the next guy about ""bad movies"". And so I hate to be a grouch about Chopping Mall, but it really is not very entertaining at all. It's more DULL than bad. Stupid script, but the dialogue isn't dumb enough to be entertaining. The acting isn't bad enough, either. The characters all blend together. By all means CM is NOT good, but it merely exists in that boring middleground- there's just nothing memorable (good or bad) about this movie, except for the title and the concept.

  On a positive note, if any viewers thought Karrie Emerson was cute, you really should find a copy of Evils of the Night. She's in that movie as well, and IMHO Evils of the Night is far more amusing than chopping mall.",1094601600,4,718,4.465648854961832
