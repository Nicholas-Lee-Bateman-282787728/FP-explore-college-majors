7921886,3,B00004STB0,"This movie supplies all the sorts of entertainment you would expect from an Italian sword and sandal picture from the early sixties.  Scantily clad male bodybuilders.  Bosomy villainesses.  Cheesy tin armour and sets that look like a vision of the ancient world redesigned in papier-mache by a drunken Frank Lloyd Wright.  Bad overdubs.  An incomprehensible plot made out of a pastiche of classical mythology.

 This one was ""Perseus the Invincible"" in Italy.  All sorts of these things were bought up to be turned into ""Sons of Hercules"" pictures in the States, and turned into a series with the stirring title song.  Hercules must have been busy.

 You ain't gettin' Shakespeare here.  But for those who like this sort of thing, this is a somewhat better than average example of what they like.  I get a hoot out of them myself.  I have since the Sons of Hercules films were made into a weekly TV series in the mid-1970's, and this week's episode was always the talk of the Latin club back when I was in high school.  The mythological and historical mish-mash will entertain classical students with the appropriate sense of humour.",984614400,8,1133,4.828125
