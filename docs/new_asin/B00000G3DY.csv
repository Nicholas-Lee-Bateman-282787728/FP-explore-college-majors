1214726,2,B00000G3DY,"..other than that, it's not much of a movie. It was interesting seeing Michael in one of his early roles.  There are occasionally some good bits of humor/dialogue...but this certainly isn't an award winning movie.",1397088000,2,213,5.085714285714285

1214729,3,B00000G3DY,"I like the video, it was interesting. Not super-awesome, not B-rated trash.. just in the middle. If you want to have some entertainment and like to watch 1980s type of show, this is a good time-waster... try to watch this and do something else at the same time. It doesn't require your full attention and just mindless entertainment.",1358208000,2,333,4.758620689655173
1214730,4,B00000G3DY,"this movie on dvd called ""The Colony"" is a very nice movie about a couple who fall in love and there is a twist this whitch many will find wonderful if you like vampire movies",1240272000,,175,4.0285714285714285
1214731,4,B00000G3DY,"A brutal race of expansionist aliens has just target Earth for harvesting.  The planet will be stripped of its resources and the inhabitants will be enslaved.  But before the fleet arrives, there is a chance to discover more about humans; particularly why so many are resistant to the alien's mind control.
Four humans have been collected for study.  Three are resistant to mind control and one is not.  But while the alien scientist pushes for understanding, the commander pushes for elimination of the humans.  The scientist has been worried.  The normal expansion methods enslave alien races but they have all died out within a year of servitude.  Can this be prevented?  Meanwhile, the captive humans keep trying to escape and pull every trick they can think of.
This is a good drama where characters' behavior is more important than effects.  The sets are rather crude, looking like old sci-fi shows of the 70's but as such they do not distract from the real point of the film.  The acting is surprisingly good and the casting is excellent.  My only problem was the use of gratuitous nudity at several points in the film.  Sometimes we just see a naked girl posing while the dialog still goes on.  I do not know why this was included.  Otherwise this is a very decent film and well worth watching.",1087948800,23,1302,4.728888888888889
1214732,2,B00000G3DY,"The Scifi Channel coproduced this lame, low-budget yawner.  Once everyone gets on the space ship, the set looks like something thrown together by a junior high thespian troupe.  Isabella Hofmann plays Harper, an alien out to experiment and study humans to find out their makeup.  (ho hum).  John Prosky is the alien leader, shaved head and filled with misanthropic nothings.  Michael Weatherly is the somewhat hunky hero; Cristi Conaway is the sexy but bland other alien; only Eric Allan Kramer as the almost beefcake Bravo makes an impression:  watch as he follows Conaway's sinewy, sexy glide in an attempt to pick up girls--it's funny.  Even Jeff Kober (from Falcon Crest) doesn't do his usual seedy job as a snarly redneck.  Low production credits, a meandering pace, and relatively poor acting sinks this one fast.",1082160000,7,819,5.059701492537314
