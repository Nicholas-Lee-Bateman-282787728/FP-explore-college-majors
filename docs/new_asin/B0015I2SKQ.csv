8258773,4,B0015I2SKQ,"Wasn't clear from the description, but this is a documentary initially about a young man's apprenticeship with a yakuza group.  Ultimately its an interesting inside view of the mundane side of yakuza life.",1419120000,,205,5.212121212121212
8258774,2,B0015I2SKQ,"An extraordinarily limited viewpoint that tells the outsider little about the lives of Yakuza.  We don't see them doing any of their real business per se, nothing illegal that is, and very little else of even minor interest.  What we do see:  the new Yakuza apprentice and his peers very carefully folding napkins and laying them on special napkin-holding plates, arranging cups and saucers and teapots on trays, slowly walking them from room to room, turning about precisely as they open and close doors, setting the table item by item ... doing it another few times on different days ... bowing on the way out while uttering ritual courtesy phrases, soaping the backs of their superiors in bath houses and toweling them dry, smoking on a rooftop, driving the boss around, ritually bowing and speaking in praise of the boss at a New Year's gathering ... are you excited yet?  Learned a lot?  Looking forward to more?  Yeah, same here.

Another day at the office, Yakuza style.  They might as well be working for a chicken hatchery or at an ice cream store.  The Yakuza boss drones on morosely about declining business and the difficulty of developing talent, but not in a way unique to Yakuza.  It's the high point of the movie.  But it's not a very high point. If you've been at work all day and want to come home and see somebody else doing more of it, here's your movie.  If you think you're going to get anything like an open look into a very closed society, guess again.",1418515200,,1476,4.591603053435114
8258775,5,B0015I2SKQ,"I am a grad student in Economics who is interested in Japanese society and culture. One great virtue of this documentary of this movie is that you can see the nonviolent aspect of Yakuza's daily operation. Although this is no essential accounts of the business model of Yakuza, since there is probably agreement between the director and the Yakuza that nothing in this movie shall have the nature of evidence of crimes, from a cultural perspective, these daily operations, the codes of conducts, the rituals are enlightening.

You may read further for the boss, Masatoshi Kumagai's wikipedia page, as well as an interview of him by the french business magazine, L'Expansion"". The article is titled, We Have To Evolve Our Business Model"".",1404950400,,737,5.040983606557377
8258776,5,B0015I2SKQ,"I rate this documentary 5 stars for bringing to light the essence of the yakuza spirit: giri. Although the initial focal point Naoki (the apprentice) is lost with his sudden undeclared departure, the boss of the Kumagai clan Masatoshi Kumagai becomes an unparalleled protagonist who shares with the viewer his reflections on his role as a non-blood-parental figure of the clan members: to show affection in a contained, expressionless, and stoic way. I disagree with those who believe that the documentary 'lost steam.' Naoki reappears almost at the end, showing his directionless existence in between worlds (the underworld and the mainstream society). The documentary portrays aspects of the contemporary Japanese society that are little known. It breaks stereotypes, and challenges the Western expectation of a linear progression of a film. I applaud Limosin's work.",1306454400,3,869,5.492537313432836
8258777,4,B0015I2SKQ,"Yes, the main character leaves the Yakuza before we get to see him fully initiated.  But this real life, which is impossible for a director to predict.  If you want action, this film is not for you.  If you want a realistic image of the modern Yakuza, then check it out.",1292803200,,270,4.254901960784314
8258778,3,B0015I2SKQ,"This is an odd film, compelling but odd.  I have no idea how it was done but the director of this film was able to gain access to a minor Yakuza crime family from the Shinagawa section of Tokyo (one of the promises made between the director and the yakuza boss was that only the legitimate aspects of the yakuza life could be portrayed, ie nothing illegal, no violence, etc).
The movie begins with the introduction of a ne'er do well young man, age 20, to a Yakuza apprenticeship that is to last one year. In between literal albeit stylized depictions of his everyday life as he learns to become a Yakuza are interviews with the Yakuza boss and scenes of him conducting business.
The Yakuza boss himself is more fascinating than the apprentice by far.  Most of his musings involve the increasing strictures upon the gangs in Japan and also the deleterious effect of modernity upon an ages old institution.  (Interesting aside about alterity: The man is a Roman Catholic in a country where Christianity is a tiny minority).
Although compelling, the movie doesn't contain any action to speak of, nor any commentary.  So one is left to figure out that the the jolly gaijin who appears midway through is actually the Yakuza's confessor and priest who was sent for to arrange to have blessings said in the boss's name.  This being deemed necessary, one surmises because of his precipitous fall in the gang hierarchy, ""I am nothing now, because I put my job on the line"" he comments.
Nothing is said about the circumstances surrounding this calamitous set back, only that he must now try to rebuild an organization.
The underside of the Yakuza life does make its presence known during the course of the film when certain events occur which are used to both demonstrate the risks one faces as a Yakuza and also to remind one that the Yakuza are an underworld gang.
The cinematography is beautiful.  So good, in fact, that the film has the feel of so-called Cinema Verite.  In fact, one goes back and forth throughout the film wondering if this is real or fiction, but for real it is.
Four stars for people fascinated by Yakuza.",1229299200,6,2120,4.652406417112299
8258779,3,B0015I2SKQ,"Young Yakuza is that unique blend of reality show and Godfather-esque drama. An insightful look at the underworld of Japan and how the modern world has changed the world of the Japanese Mafia.

There is an oddness to the relationship between young Naoki and the mob boss Kumagai is an odd one, but touching at the same time. Perhaps it takes a foreign director, in this case French auteur Jean-Pierre Limosin, to have the objectivity to tell this story in this manner.",1213660800,2,468,4.7073170731707314
