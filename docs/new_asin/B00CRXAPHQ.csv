8585462,3,B00CRXAPHQ,"When i saw the price I was excited. I figured that the price of this is the price of one movie. But what the cover picture doesnt show you is the big "" FOR SALE IN INDIA ONLY "". This dvd is only supposed to be sold in india, not america, so THERE ARE NO ENGLISH SUBTITLES!!! how am i supposed to know what they're saying??? unless you're fluenty in 3 different dialects of hindi, or like me you can rip these off the disc and add subtitles via a computer program don't buy it.  if computer or hindi aren't your thing, don't try either. hindi is a language you take years to learn, and the computer work involves downloading 3 different freeware applications ( handbrake, dvd decrypter, format factory), only to then have to download srt ( subtitle ) files that you have to add to the video vai the handbrake application. just to do one of the 3 movies takes about 36 hours, because you have to rip, then stitch, then add the subtitles. all that download may leave you with a nasty virus if you go someplace unsafe, or don't have a antivirus. please note that as long as you make these ripped movie copies for yourself its totally legal.

Anyway, if you are good with computers like me, or understand enough hindi, you would enjoy this especially as a SRK fan. 3 of his better movies for sure. the picture is decent, good for a dvd, and the audio is a bit tinny, but nothing that ruins the songs or dialect. i watched them on a 55 inch vizio from my ps3, which upscales the quality of the picture (makes it better). i listened to it on a bose surround sound system, which in my opinion is the only way to go with these older more filmy-shilmy knida movies.

in the long run, it was too much of a hassel to return, so im hoping i can rip them and watch them with subtitles from my computer or phone. don't buy it if you think you are going to do what i did. its not worth it. but them seperately, or just watch them on youtube, or download them off the internet.",1377993600,,1960,4.207446808510638
