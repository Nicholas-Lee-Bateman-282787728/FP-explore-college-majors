4514006,1,B0050E4AHA,"I was so excited to receive this video, but I couldn't have been more disappointed. There is a VERY limited vocabulary for the price. Yes, it presents the ABC's and 1,2,3's, colors, and a few sentences, but the everyday words aren't extensive.
In addition, the video only gives limited examples and time to practice before moving to the next sign. There is no practice session.
I would suggest saving your money and visiting [...] for free lessons, which you can replay over and over until you get them correct. I learned more in a few minutes from this website then I ever learned from the video.
I expected more from the ""Signing Time"" people.
By the way - I never leave reviews, but felt very strongly about leaving this one! I'm a teacher of children with autism so signing is important.",1342310400,40,791,4.617021276595745
4514007,4,B0050E4AHA,"I purchased this video along with the flashcards and a sign language book because me and my wife were interested in learning sign language and also teaching our 4 year old and soon our 8 month old.  We just started the video and its been great, the only issue is that it goes by fast for my 4 year old, but a quick pause at each letter or number or word helps and isn't too much of an issue.  I wanted to video in addition to the book and flashcards because you can actually see the signs in motion incase you were unsure by the description in a book. The reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 was that the disc was scratched upon arrival.  I cleaned it very well and so far it seems to work ok but when I first opened the case, I was a bit worried it would skip and freeze. Other than that, great product.",1333843200,,806,3.962962962962963
4514008,5,B0050E4AHA,"I am more than satisfied with my purchase. This Item was worth every penny. Here's why:

1) You learn quick, easy and useful words in ASL.

2) You are taught idioms and sayings and some ASL slang (not taught in traditional classrooms).

3) The DVD shows you proper ASL etiquette and how to properly communicate with people of the Deaf Community.

4) The instructors on the video are very expressive and show you facial expressions which are essential to communicating with Deaf people.

5) The DVD is categorized in sections which are easy to learn. ie. Graduation day phrases, Holiday phrases.

6) There is an Android/iPhone application that can be used portably as a supplement to the DVD (How awesome is that!)

7) Customer Service was excellent- the people on the EveryDay ASL Facebook were very friendly and kind in updating me on my purchase.

I learned a lot my first day. What I love about this DVD is that you're not bored. Instead of learning ASL the traditional way, you actually learn words that are the most used by those fluent in ASL. I am looking forward to further practicing this DVD for days to come and am interested in future purchases of other DVDs by this company.

I urge you to buy this DVD if you're interested in learning American Sign Language.

Good Luck! Happy signing!

Everything from simple vocabulary, sentence structure and grammar, to etiquette and beyond are covered in this DVD. This DVD has helped me review and refresh my memory so that I can stay on top of my ASL skills. I really like that the material was covered in three formats: signed in ASL, voiced by an interpreter, and displayed on the screen. As for the company that produced the DVD and the sign models who are involved in the production and running of the company...I have had many communications via email and Facebook; they are kind, courteous, and very knowledgeable.

The signers seem genuinely happy when they're signing, which makes me excited to learn!  My wife tells me that traditional ASL requires the signing of every single word, conjunction, connector etc., and when she saw this DVD she said she could easily understand what they were saying, but that it definitely was sort of a short-cut version of the traditional ASL.

Sections with phrases repeat the signing (3 times?)with 1 of the repeats in slow motion - very helpful! It is also the first I've seen that has a detailed bio of the ASL teachers, which is at the end of the video (great for those who are interested, like me, but is also good to have at the end for those that may not be as interested in the teachers professional details).

4514081,5,B0050E4AHA,"My friend had this - ""Sign Language 101: A Beginner's Guide to American Sign Language"" & it was so helpful in learning ASL. I already purchased the ""Idiom & Phrases in ASL"" by EverydayASL Productions, because it was used in our Interpreter Trainer Program at Sinclair Community College. Our Deaf professor taught an entire class using the dvds. He loved them, and so did we. There were many signs that I never learned in other sign language classes. (Plus, there is so much more to learning ASL than just the signs. Non-manual signals, including facial expressions, eye gaze, body position...etc., are equally important.) Not only that, you will learn about Deaf Culture.
Many people pick up bad signing habits when learning sign language. It would be so much better to learn the right way first.

I can't wait to get ""Sign Language 101: A Beginner's Guide to American Sign Language""!! The instructors on the DVDS are Deaf and native users of ASL. If you want to learn sign language, or brush up on your skills, I can't think of any other DVDs that will help as much as these do. They are fun too! I have bought other instructional dvds from other companies and those were poorly made and so boring! EverydayASL Productions are professionally made and well worth the money. You will laugh while you learn!!",1346630400,14,1306,4.753303964757709
4514082,5,B0050E4AHA,"If you are interested in learning American Sign Language, I highly recommend Everyday ASL's DVD ""Sign Language 101"".  Gilda and Avery make learning a new language fun and they have a great sense of humor!  I have bought a few different ASL DVDs from other companies, and theirs are my favorite:)  They are true Masters of their language and are able to teach hearing people how to begin to understand this most beautiful language.",1346630400,10,430,4.783783783783784
4514083,5,B0050E4AHA,"This is a FANTASTIC dvd for anyone wanting to begin learning ASL! The signers have a wonderful sense of humor and are so funny! Also at the end of the dvd there is information about their facebook fan page where you can get free video lessons, participate in quizzes and win beautiful jewelry prizes! Gilda one of the signers answers you personally and is such a sweet person! I absolutely LOVE LOVE LOVE Everyday ASL Productions, Ltd and I have purchased EVERY single dvd as well as other fun iteams from their online store!",1346630400,4,525,4.595744680851064
4514084,5,B0050E4AHA,"As a former student pursing my career to become an interpreter and having Deaf teachers  , lanuguge should be taught by thier native users  I have found Gilda's videos to be not only reasonable in price but an excellent resource to have whether a person is just starting out learning or wanting to enchance thier sign skills..when learning a new language it can be intimidating Gilda has the gift to make this not only fun but also keeping you wanting to become fluent . I suggest anyone wanting to learn sign take time to also do research on Deaf culture and also the linquistics of ASL and you will find that Gilda is an asset to not only the Deaf Community but the Hearing one also . I will continue to purchase videos from Everyday ASL to enhance my skills.",1346630400,3,761,4.428571428571429

Sign Language 101 gets a KISS-FIST from me, and my students love it, as well. Each unit has clear objectives, provides positive examples from native signers and shows creativity.  All of the everydayasl products are done with a great sense of humor and great educational sense. Two thumbs up to Gilda and Avery!",1346544000,2,441,4.88

4514090,1,B0050E4AHA,"I can't express how disappointed I am with this product when there are websites like lifeprint.com and signsavvy.com that cover most of the info in this video better and for free.  This video contains no real teaching or explanations for ASL grammar and no memory aids.  Often it will give an entire sentence, then show you how to sign it, but not break down which sign corealates to which word--this is insanely important because you won't structure a sentence in ASL the same way you would in spoken english.

I have to admit that I did pick up a few new things, but overall its garbage and you'd be better off going to one of the websites listed above",1346284800,9,654,4.4789915966386555
