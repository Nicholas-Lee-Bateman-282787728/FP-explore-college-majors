1529249,5,B00005JO4F,"This is one of the best family shows of all time. I was 12 back in 1977 when the Bradfords first hit the air. I was a faithful viewer. Please release this show on DVD,so that I can go back to the 1970's with the Bradfords. Its been long enough,the time has come. Lets go people!!",1117843200,89,279,4.0
1529250,5,B00005JO4F,"I was born in 1970 and watched 'Eight Is Enough' on TV and in syndication (PAX TV) for most of my life. When I grew up I always wanted to live in a neighborhood like the Bradfords and have friends like Tommy with three or more hot, available, sisters...unfortunately, when I did grow up it was during the 80's and I lived in Texas. Needless to say, life was nothing like the television show and still to this day, I have yet to find a community or a group of people that are as cool as the ones portrayed in this show. The last of the 'Star Wars' saga is coming out this month in the theaters and back then the original 'Star Wars' movie had just come out and 'Eight Is Enough', a show which epitomizes the values of an era that has long come and gone has not been given a DVD release like 'The Brady Bunch' or 'The Partridge Family'. I liked 'The Brady Bunch' and 'TPF' but it always seemed fake to me like 'The Monkees' and I never really got into it like 'EIE'. If whomever is in charge of the rights to this show would put it out on DVD with a really cool 1970's-ish cover (NO DOUBLE SIDED DVD'S!!!) and some cool special features I'd buy it in a heartbeat, and be eternally grateful. It's a shame that in the time that we're living in we don't have more positive family role models on television, and instead have channel after channel of reality shows and military/cop dramas that aren't nearly as cool as 'Chips', 'Magnum P.I.', or 'Simon & Simon', in my opinion. Oh, also, release 'Simon & Simon' on DVD and I'll buy that as well. I love that show!!!",1114992000,15,1558,4.231543624161074
1529251,5,B00005JO4F,"I can't believe that with the popularity of -- and push for -- family programming, this marvelous show isn't on the shelves available for purchase.  I sure loved it as a young kid, and I would love to have this one in my home for the rest of my family to enjoy.

Even though Betty Buckley wasn't on the show until the second year as Abby, the first short season was a decent offering.  Dick Van Patten as Tom Bradford was maybe one of the best TV dads on television ever.

The first year was so brief, so it would be great if whoever owns the rights would release seasons one & two TOGETHER (like the ""Dallas"" set).  Betty Buckly, after all, was one of the best things to ever happen to this series.

01 - Never Try Eating Nectarines Since Juice May Dispense (3-15-77)

Elizabeth is arrested for drug possession, and David (played by Mark 'LUKE SKYWALKER' Hammil in this episode only - Grant Goodeve took over in episode 2) moves out on his own.

**The title of this episode is really just a clever way that Tom and Joan remember the names of all their 8 kids - Nicholas, Tommy, Elizabeth, Nancy, Susan, Joanie, Mary & David (from youngest to oldes)**

02 - Schussboomer (3-22-77)

Mary's single friend (who's also pregnant--GASP!) stays with the Bradford family and clashes with Tom.  Apparently Diana Hyland who played Tom's wife Joan, passed away around the time this episode first aired, forcing them to eventually have the mother character die--and allow Betty Buckly to join the cast as the woman Tom would soon marry!

03 - Pieces Of Eight (3-29-77)

Tom and Joan argue when she insists on continuing her photography career while his newspaper is shut down by a strike.

04 - Women, Ducks & The Domino Theory (4-5-77)

Tommy gets stood up by his date, and Tom and David pretend to be interested in their annual hunting trip (Charlene Tilton gust stars).

05 - Turnabout (4-12-77)

David dates an older woman, played by Adrienne Barbeau (she played Bea Arthur's daughter on ""Maude"" and Oswald's mother on ""The Drew Carey Show"")

06 - Quarantine (4-19-77)

The entire family gets quarantined at the house, forcing David to run errands for them ""on the outside.""

07 - 'V' Is For Vivian (4-26-77)

Tom's sister (Janis Paige) comes to visit and annoys Tom by encouraging the kids too much.

08 - Hit And Run (5-3-77)

Tommy accidentally breaks a window at a church, Joanie meets a land developer who is in conflict with Tom, and Elizabeth lands three dates for the same high school prom.

09 - The Gipper Caper (8-10-77)

Tom's friend 'The Gipper' challenges the Bradfords to a game of touch football.",1114041600,22,2604,4.608695652173913

When I was much younger this show was on television. We liked it, I'm not sure quite why, but I like it now, too, in part because of the quaint, sexist stuff that is so much part of the writing of that time.
This show is corny, almost campy. The acting is adequate, but not great. Same for the writing. If you want great television, this isn't it, but if you just want a fun show with a definite period flavor, here you go!",1367798400,,761,4.141891891891892

Betty Buckley was simply not in the same class, and Tom Bradford on his own, just didn't seem right.  Grant Goodeve was dependable as David, but somehow I can't help wondering what the series would have been like if Mark Hamill had stayed on for the whole first season. The more I watch the pilot episode, the more I like him as David. And Kimberley Beck would definitely have been a great Nancy!  Oh well, what might have been!

Anyway, I am really impressed with the quality of my DVD product. Hope to see the second season one day, but wouldn't bother with the last 3 seasons.  The show really jumped the shark, when annoying characters like Merl the Pearl came along.",1351555200,,823,4.489932885906041

I hope they will release season 2 soon.. I also love that the theme song, sung by Grant Goodeve.  Seeing  this show on Wednesday nights, was someething I looked forward to... same night as Charlie's angels, and network....
So glad to get to watch this show again.",1349222400,4,782,4.426573426573427
1529956,5,B00005JO4F,"THANK YOU FOR SEASON 1 OF ""EIGHT IS ENOUGH"".

THIS WAS ONE GREAT SHOW!!

I was in high school when this show came out in the 1970's and was the same age as the kids portrayed in this show. This show transports me back to a simpler time when I was in high school and the world was not hooked on instant messaging, the internet and cell phones. Back in a time when people communicated with one another face to face.

I have missed being able to see this GREAT show on TV. I think one of the reasons this show was so good was it was done by LORIMAR PRODUCTIONS, the same company that did - ""THE WALTONS"". ""THE WALTONS"" was another TV favorite of mine. They had great writers on this show that knew how to relate to their audience. Unlike all the garbage that is being produced today for television. This show dealt with modern topics of the day and how the Bradford family handled them..

Thank you Dick Van Patten as Tom Bradford. You did a great job in that role! You were a GREAT dad!

THANK YOU TO EVERYONE INVOLVED in the production! It was ""SUPER""! You ALL we're ""SUPER""! To put it in 70's vernacular.

I can't wait to hear that great theme song sung by Grant Goodeve in Season 2.

PLEASE BRING ON SEASON 2!",1348099200,,1210,4.189655172413793

1530019,5,B00005JO4F,"Let me just star out by saying I was ten days old when the show premiered March 15th 1977. But I did grow up watching the show when I was a kid in the 80's.  Gotta say Nicholas was my idol growing up. He seemed like the whole show to me. I loved everybody on it but he just had the best lines and had the best quips. Now watching the show again in 2012 he still has the best lines and comic quips. He was the star of the show then and is the star of the show now. I heard over the years that Adam Rich spent time in and out of jail and was addicted to drugs from a very young age. Sad if that really is true. I saw pretty much every episode when I was a kid. Saw it some again in the early 2000's when they showed it again on that religious family cable channel. That was a nice refresher. Saw the first episode that featured Mark Hamill and minor scream queen Kimberly Beck (Friday the 13th Part 4, Massacre At Central High and Nightmare At Noon along with the too-groovy-for-words Roller Boogie) on the internet back in 2007 when they had free tv shows from the past on a certain website. Interesting to see the mother on there because I was so used to Betty Buckley as the step mom when I was a kid. Think the original mom died of breast cancer while dating a 20 something John Travolta at the time. But having the dvd of the first season was a great experience. What also really stood out was the breathtaking picture quality with hardly any flaws. I think a reviewer said on here it looked the show was taped today and they are totally right. Funny to see Willie Aames so young. He went on to co-star along with Scott Baio in Charles In Charge and be a nuisance on Celebrity Fit Club. I remember Grant Goodeve being the coolest older brother ever and he still is. Love Dick Van Patten. ALWAYS! He still rocks even in his 80's. He's still a working actor guest starring in Hot In Cleveland occasionally. The sisters are all cutie pies. Just have to mention that Dick Van Patten's sister, Joyce Van Patten, outshines Adam Sandler, Chris Rock, David Spade and the other two famous comedians in the comedy Grown Ups. Funniest damn person in the movie while also being in her 70's. After evisiting Eight Is Enough the last few days I was having fun watching some future stars guest star on the show. Almost as fun as watching those old famous guest stars on Murder, She Wrote. Okay, I've geeked out enough here. All I got to say is NICHOLAS LIVES!!! 2012 is his comeback year!!!",1343433600,,2478,4.227848101265823

A major disappointment was in store for me.  Unlike Family (with Sada Thompson), which is as superb today (on DVD) as I had recalled it as being on TV, Eight is Enough proved to be, in a word, awful.  The acting is wooden and unrealistic, and the scripts are worse.  Everything and everyone are shallow beyond belief.  I suppose it is a good thing in a way that there is no real suffering, angst, or anger called for in any of the scripts, as none of the actors would be capable of portraying such emotions anyway.  But they do not even convey real happiness with any success, either.  In short, any convincing portrayal of any emotion at all is utterly lacking; but, as I said, none is called for by any of the trivial scripts in any event.

The series does have one real advantage, and that is as a soporific.  Insomniacs take note!

The series has never looked this good. Crystal clarity, you can see the stitching on Tom's jacket and on the upholstery of his car. The vibrant colors shine throughout.
As I watched the pilot again, I was amazed at the chemistry between Dick and Diana and realised it would only be enjoyed for a few episodes before her untimely passing....
Of course as everyone knows David, Tommy and Nancy would be recast by the second episode. I enjoyed every one of the nine first season episodes, culminating in the The Gipper Caper. I found myself teary-eyed when Mary reads Tom's draft for his article....It still packs a punch 35 years later...
Interestingly the end credits for Gipper are from episode 5) Women, Ducks And the Domino Theory....
The reunion from 2010 was a treat - Dick, Betty, Grant, Laurie, Connie, Willie (in New York) and Dianne (from Los Angeles).

1530118,4,B00005JO4F,"I've been waiting for this set as long as everyone else, and couldn't wait for it to arrive so that I could finally trash my VHS tapes recorded from syndicated edited TV versions.

Well, the GOOD news is that these 9 episodes are overall very clear and sharp, the best I've seen them for a 35 year old show from 1977. And they all contain the opening ""teaser"" scenes from just before the opening credits, and the closing ""tag"" scenes from just before the closing credits that typically are missing from the syndicated versions. Plus, there is a bonus special feature of the recent Eight Is Enough Cast Reunion that occurred on 3/1/2010 during the Great TV Families Reunited Week on The Today Show.

But, there are some issues with this set for die-hard completists. So, for those of you who get bored with history lessons, or who believe that everything they read on Wikipedia and other internet websites is absolutely true, then you might as well stop reading now.

Everyone knows that Diana Hyland played Joan Bradford, the original mom on the series, and that she died during production of the first season. She had filmed only 4 episodes (counting the Pilot) before she became ill. She subsequently voice recorded some telephone conversion scenes for a couple more episodes before she passed away.

The original production order of episodes were:

1. Pilot NTENSJMD (features Diana Hyland)
2. Schussboomer (features Diana Hyland)
3. Pieces of Eight (features Diana Hyland)
4. Turnabout (features Diana Hyland)
5. Quarantine (phone conversation with Diana Hyland)
6. The Gipper Caper (phone conversation with Diana Hyland)
7. V Is for Vivian
8. Hit and Run
9. Women, Ducks and the Domino Theory

Now when Eight Is Enough aired on Tuesdays on ABC during the Spring of 1977, they only aired 8 episodes (counting the Pilot). The order of these episodes and their airdates is INCORRECT on this DVD set and just about all internet website listings. Amazon's own instant video listings can't even get the WRONG dates correct.

The correct order and airdates for Spring 1977 is as follows. And all 8 of these episodes had opening credits which included Diana Hyland, and all of them (except the Pilot) had the opening and closing credits with the 10 cast members posing in front of their house for a family photo.

3/15/77 Pilot NTENSJMD
3/22/77 Schussboomer
3/29/77 The Gipper Caper
4/05/77 Pieces of Eight
4/12/77 Women, Ducks and the Domino Theory
4/19/77 Turnabout
4/26/77 Quarantine
5/03/77 V Is for Vivian

When Eight Is Enough returned for the Summer of 1977, now on Wednesdays, ABC had Lorimar replace the opening and closing credits with the new soon-to-be 2nd Season opening and closing credits. This version featured the remaining 9 cast members forming a human pyramid by the side of the house. AND new scenes and dialogue were filmed and recorded to REPLACE the phone conversion scenes and voice recordings by Diana Hyland in the previous episodes for their reruns.

8/10/77 Hit and Run
8/17/77 Women, Ducks and the Domino Theory (repeat)
8/24/77 The Gipper Caper (repeat)
8/31/77 V Is for Vivian (repeat)
9/07/77 pre-empted for David Copperfield's The Magic of ABC Fall Preview Special

This DVD set contains a mixture of the Spring 1977 original episodes and the Summer 1977 original and repeat episodes (with the replaced scenes and credits).

And finally, 3 of the episodes on this DVD set: Quarantine, Hit and Run, and The Gipper Caper have the WRONG closing credits. They all have the closing credits from Women, Ducks and the Domino Theory. It makes it looks like Charlene Tilton was a recurring character as Tommy's crush Wendy Springer in 4 episodes.

All in all, this really is a great DVD set. And it was a joy to re-watch all these episodes. So, if you can get past the incorrect episode order, the repeat episodes with the replaced scenes, and the 3 wrong closing credits, you'll have a blast getting reacquainted with the Bradford Clan.",1335484800,12,3959,4.891044776119403
1530189,5,B00005JO4F,"This show brings back so many memories.  It wasn't the great acting, but the personalities, the 70's clothes, hair and close family times of sitting around the table.  The caring and love expressed. It was more real than a lot of family shows that had come before it. Everything didn't always turn out all right, but you had to watch because these people made you care about them and root for them.  I love their house and the warmth it radiated.  I love this show and hope the other seasons come out soon.",1335312000,4,506,4.408602150537634

It brought me back to a wonderful time. Wish the times today could be so great. I forgot the opening w/Joan. Didn't know Tom was sporting a tatoo. Yes i did have joannie's haircut back in the day, course i was 8 @ the time. But if you are going to drop 20 bucks on a dvd this is it!  Get this you will not regret it at all. Now my only question is when will season 2 come out?",1335225600,2,550,3.8584070796460175
1530191,5,B00005JO4F,I absolutely loved season 1.  This is a great show!  My only complaint is that season one is too short.  I like the scenes with Diana Hyland.  But I would also like to have the seasons with Betty Buckley as the step mom.,1335225600,3,220,4.046511627906977
1530192,5,B00005JO4F,"I was wondering if they would ever release this, and when I finally saw the news it had been scheduled for an official release I pre-ordered. I got my copy over the weekend, and while this is a short & sweet package, its a wonderful taste of yesteryear. It is only 9 episodes, which is probably going to make some people hesitate at buying this, but the pricepoint being below $20 should certainly help.

Picture & Sound: I cannot say enough as to how well this has been restored. The picture is flawless and looks better than I ever remembered it. Considering the source material is 35 years old, I find it odd some people are saying it wasn't remastered, as Ive watched these shows since I was a kid (I saw them all the first time around) and theyve never looked this good. The 4:3 aspect ratio has been preserved, so you'll be watching this with black columns on most modern HDTVs, but Im glad they did this as it respects the original view of how the show was supposed to look. One of my biggest complaints about Season One when it ran in syndication was how dark it always looked, but here every scene of every episode has been toned-up and brightened to modern-day standards. It truly is like watching it for the first time again. And even the laugh track has been preserved, which I know a lot of fans dislike. But to me, that was a part of the original show and Im glad they kept it. Both picture & sound get a 10/10 from me.

Eight Is Enough premiered as a mid-season replacement in the Spring of 1977, and thats why this first season is so short. But please don't let that stop you from investing a few dollars. They simply don't make shows like this anymore, and I don't think it could be done if someone tried. The 1970s was a much simpler time, and the Bradfords' ""crisis of the week"" would seem just plain hokey by today's standards. But its exactly that atmosphere of the show that makes it so wonderful to watch again, as it takes you back to when life was simple and family was always the most important thing in your life. Like other shows of the time, such as Little House & Family, Eight Is Enough was wholesome without being preachy or too overly sappy. And, obviously, Warner Brothers is testing the market with this release, saving future seasons based on how well this one sells. (IE, if you want to see Seasons 2-5, make sure you buy this one so they release them!!!).

The only real extra on this collection is a rebroadcast of a 2011 Today show segment in which the majority of the cast was brought back together for an interview. Two cast members are very notably missing from this, as Adam Rich (Nicholas, the youngest) and Susan Richardson (Susan, the tomboy) are nowhere to be found. Rich did email a statement regretting his inability to be there, but Richardson was simply ignored altogether. And without the entire cast, I find it a little flimsy calling it a ""reunion"". Still this is the only thing I can find fault with on this DVD, and believe me most viewers won't miss it. The episodes of the show are the real stars here, and FINALLY they have been given a chance to shine.

Overall, this is definitely a great buy. And for those of you still on the fence because of how short this set is, here's something to keep in mind: Season Two is when this show really found its' footing and the writing began to excel, and there are 24 episodes in that one. So, consider this your sampler...if it sells well, the really good part of this show will come in future releases very soon.

My mark for the season's episodes themselves: B
Its a great start, but the best is yet to come in future seasons.

My mark for this DVD set: A
The lack of any real extras is a bit of a bummer, but the impeccable restoration of the video & sound makes you feel like this was shot in HD and really feels like you're watching it all for the first time again. Here's to Season Two coming soon!!!",1335139200,8,3907,4.3598901098901095
1530193,3,B00005JO4F,"I was excited to recently get the long-awaited first season of Eight is Enough. I feel it's worth the money for the Diana Hyland episodes alone, which have been rarely seen in syndication until just a few years ago. I was also looking forward to seeing the non-Joan episodes, since I have only seen some of them once or twice. According to producer William Blinn in the book ""The Show Must Go On,"" when Diana was unable to work anymore, the writers wrote Joan as visiting a relative who was having a baby. He went to her home several times and tape recorded her side of phone conversations with Dick Van Patten. Blinn is quoted as saying, ""And to her everlasting credit, Diana's energy and her intelligence and her performance in those off-camera telephone conversations was terrific."" These conversations with Diana's voice originally aired during the show's first run and explained Joan's absence from the second part of the short first season. However, when the episodes were rerun in the summer, to not get viewers too acclimated to Joan, the powers that be reportedly only aired the non-Joan episodes, filmed and presented a new opening sequence (the pyramid in the front yard) and eliminated any references to Joan. I was expecting to see the originally aired phone conversations. To my surprise, when I watched the first non-Joan episode, ""Women, Ducks, and the Domino Theory,"" it played exactly as it did that summer - no phone calls or mention of Joan, with the new opening credits. Does anyone know what happened to the phone call footage? If they still have it, I think it would be a tribute to Diana to include it and somewhat disrespectful not to (don't get me started on the miniscule photo of Diana on the DVD cover). What the heck were they thinking? I haven't watched the rest of the episodes yet, but I'm assuming the rest of the episodes are the same. I think there has been some confusion with viewers because in syndication the kids seem so happy in the non-Joan episodes (before Betty Buckley arrives) and people are wondering what happened to Joan and think Joan has already died, which she hasn't (I believe Diana died when filming was almost complete for the season and it was revealed that Joan died at the beginning of the second season). Showing the phone conversations would clarify matters. Despite this flaw, it is great to finally have the season on DVD.",1335052800,23,2386,4.751807228915663

1530195,4,B00005JO4F,"Eight Is Enough was a late 70's TV show that was based on the writings of newspaper columnist Tom Braden.  Starring as Tom Bradford, Dick Van Patten entered the TV hall of fame as one of the most memorable TV fathers of all time.  The first season is a supremely short nine episodes and featured the late Diana Hyland as Tom's wife Joan.  She only appears in the first four episodes as she became sick with breast cancer and eventually succumb to the disease shortly after the showed debuted.  She was written out of the rest of the season and season two shows that Tom had become a widower.  I wonder why the show's producers didn't replace her with another actress since she hadn't become entrenched in role.  Probably it was out of respect, but some of the better scenes in the first episodes is the interchange between Tom & Joan on raising the kids.  This was lost in the later seasons and could have been a strong part of the show. The first episode is interesting to watch as Mark Hamil played the role of eldest son David.  He seemed like a great casting choice as he bears a slight resemblance to both Mr. Van Patten & Ms. Hyland and he seems to fit in with rest of the family.  In retrospect, Grant Goodeve who replaced Mr. Hamil in the series seems like an odd choice because he doesn't look like he fits into the family with his dark looks.  The nine episodes show Tom trying to juggle his job, finances and raising his eight kids.  He wants to be liberal and ""modern"" as he is in his columns, but finds himself reacting a little differently when it comes to his own kids.",1334793600,2,1584,4.35374149659864

As for me, I will be enjoying quality tv and watch it again and again. The picture quality is good and so is the sound. It does not appear to be remastered. But for the price, who can complain.

There is absolutely nothing to watch on TV with my now 15-year-old daughter; I wanted her to see the shows that meant so much to me in my youth before she gets older and grows away from me. ""Eight is Enough"" was a warm, funny, meaningful family show which portrays a special time in my life, when my parents were still alive and life was full of promise. I purchased ""Family"" Seasons 1 and 2 last year, and my daughter has watched it so often she has almost memorized the episodes. The remaining seasons of ""Family"" should also be released.

I hope this is the beginning of all the seasons being out on DVD and not like Who's the Boss. Where season 1 was available on DVD and then that was it. No more. We supported these Stations by watching the show for the five seasons it was on TV and they made millions of dollars. The least they can do for us fans is make the full series available on DVD.

1530293,5,B00005JO4F,"On April 17th, 2012 one of the most beloved family series of all-time makes its debut finally on DVD. ""Eight Is Enough"" arrives for purchase in stores in a two-disc set featuring all season 1 episodes. The reason the set contains so few shows is because ""Eight Is Enough"" was a mid-season replacement on ABC in the spring of 1977 and ordered by the then head of the network Fred Silverman who wanted to go after the young audience. What better way to achive that feat than by featuring a one hour weekly drama revolving around eight kids at various ages.

 In season one the pilot, which debut on March 15th, 1977, was a bit different than other produced episodes. First of all the part of David was played by a pre-""Star Wars"" Mark Hamill, Nancy was played by Kimberley Beck and Thommy by an unknown actor named Chris English. Once the pilot was bought by ABC those roles subsequently went to the actors who played the roles until the cancellation of the series in 1981.

 Season one also featured the beautiful Diana Hyland as the matriarch of the Bradford clan, Joan. With  Dick Van Patten playing the father and running a newspaper, Joan was contented on being a housewife and raising 8 kids. However, Diana was only able to tape the first four shows before she fell ill (Diana died of cancer in the arms of her then boyfriend John Travolta). Hyland passed away just 12 days after the pilot aired forcing the producers to come up with the issue on how to deal with the character of Joan. That problem was solved when the series came back in the fall of 1977.

 The DVD boxset will feature, as a special bonus, an ""Eight Is Enough"" reunion special produced for this set.

 The following is the complete episode guide of all shows from season one along with their airdates:

1. ""Never Try Eating Nectarines Since Juice May Dispence"", March 15, 1977 (PILOT)
2. ""Schussboomer"", March 22, 1977
3. ""Pieces of Eight"", March 29, 1977
4. ""Women, Ducks and the Domino Theory"", April 5, 1977
5. ""Turnabout"", April 12, 1977
6. ""Quanantine"", April 19, 1977
7. ""V is for Vivian"", April 26, 1977
8. ""Hit and Run"", May 3, 1977
9, ""The Gipper Capper"", May 10, 1977",1326412800,9,2151,4.534883720930233
1530294,4,B00005JO4F,I'm giving this four stars. That's an average of five for the show and four for the video quality. You have to turn the sound way up on the TV to hear it clearly. The pilot episode was almost like watching a home-recorded video tape but the other were a little better. The show was great and I enjoyed watching it. Bring on season 2!,1326153600,8,333,4.138461538461539

Why can't all 5 seasons be released as a set?  I have completed my set of The Waltons, have also finished 7th Heaven, still working on Little House on the Prairie and Touched by an Angel (only want Seasons 1-6. Valerie Bertinelli's character ruined the last 3 seasons). I'm stuck with only a few seasons of Highway to Heaven, Early Edition and Life Goes On and can't get any more to finish my sets. I'd really like to add this show to my collection too. I spend more time on the computer than watching TV any more. There are no good decent family shows on TV to watch.

Be careful everybody with those sites that advertise entire sets when they have not been officially released. They are usually bad tv copies and sometimes you never even get what you have ordered.

Unfortunately it has never been rerun in Italy since the early 90s and I'm looking forward to watching it again on dvd.,1155427200,10,425,4.325
1530673,5,B00005JO4F,"I love this show! It often would tackle serious subject matters and never failed to entertain. There have been two television series that i have wanted to see come out on DVD more than any others. One was ""Family Affair"" which finally came out and the other is ""Eight is Enough"". This show always made me feel warm inside as did ""Family Affair"". They were a family you would of liked to be a part of or at least visit for a while. Maybe that's part of it's appeal to me. I just hope we don't have to wait much longer to enjoy this wonderful show. Please release this quality show on DVD!

1530674,5,B00005JO4F,"I grew up watching Eight is Enough I looked forward to each episode,I was greatly saddened when the show was briefly cancelled after the death of Diana Hyland (original mom Joan Bradford).When the network brought it back I was thrilled the show had a great cast. When the show came back we watched as the family dealt with the changes from the death of one (Diana Hyland) and the welcoming of another (Betty Buckley)The show dealt with many different issues some serious,some funny. Eight is Enough is a show that brought you heartwarming episodes yet the characters were never sappy,we laughed,we cried many episodes dealt with the normalicy of living in a house with 7 siblings (eldest son David had moved out)the Bradford family fought,but they always bonded. Eight is Enough on DVD would be a great addition to the many family oriented shows now available on DVD I for one would love to have all 5 seasons. In my area there is no network running Eight is Enough at this time but I hope to see it in the listings real soon. Besides the show there were a few made for tv movies that reunited the Bradford clan,which was awesome Id love to see any and all of those available on DVD.There are many shows from the 70s that are fun to watch which are available on DVD but Eight is Enough will always be my favorite and its a shame that they haven't brought out this show on DVD for collectors to add to their TV librarys

If you haven't caught Eight is Enough reruns or its original airing you've missed out on fun family tv viewing. PLEASE ADD EIGHT IS ENOUGH TO THE DVD LIBRARY IT REALLY IS A PERFECT ADDITION TO ANY ""70s"" TV SERIES COLLECTORS SETS OUT THERE TODAY",1148601600,15,1664,4.473684210526316
1530675,5,B00005JO4F,I was a kid and this was my favorite show and I still seem drawn to it now as an adult...thank goodness AOL is showing some of the reruns now..I would definetly be interested in buying it if it ever comes to DVD.,1143158400,12,212,3.953488372093023
1530676,5,B00005JO4F,"This is my all-time favorite TV show.  I remember watching it when I was a young, young kid (born in '72 so you do the math!) and I have been searching for it on DVD!  If people are actually buying cheesy shows like ""Mork and Mindy,""  then they will most definitely buy ""Eight is Enough!""",1127952000,20,288,4.2
1530677,5,B00005JO4F,"Eight is Enough is one of the best family shows from the 1970s.  Almost everyone you talk to has fond memories of the series and it should be released in boxed sets. It's one of the last '70s family series yet to be released, even though it is ranked #40 in WB series people would like to see on DVD -- out of their entire stable -- and ranked high on Amazon.  Please write WB and ask them to release it!

So THRILLED to see the first season finally being released!  Everyone post about it, blog about it, tweet about it -- do whatever to get the word out there so that we get MORE than just 9 episodes on DVD! This is an anticipated release, but we must make sure we get the entire run on DVD, so it's not just a one shot one hit wonder.",1124582400,26,738,3.9662162162162162
1530678,5,B00005JO4F,"While growing up, Eight is Enough was one of my favorite shows. It was a rare family drama that was humorous and real without being too sappy. I would buy all of the seasons of this series in a heartbeat.",1123891200,103,204,4.125
1530679,5,B00005JO4F,...its one of the classic 70s family shows. Please release it and future seasons. I'm sure it'll be a success.,1123459200,22,110,4.55

7940772,5,B00005JO4F,"I adored this tv show when I was little, I saw this show in the 80's...It was wonderful...",1519344000,,90,4.055555555555555
7940773,5,B00005JO4F,"Wow. Eight Is Enough. Been a long time, old friend. Its interesting to note how much certain TV shows (or books) from your youth leave such an impression. This was definitely one of them. I remember bits and pieces but upon viewing it now through adult eyes its funny to see how a lot of it is very unrealistic.
We all know this is supposed to take place in Sacramento. This is my hometown and though they do their best to make it look like it, they just cant take the L.A.feel out of L.A. Except for the house. It really does look like one of the houses in our Fabulous Forties neighborhood, they got that part right. But I don't think they could have afforded to live in that neighborhood in real life on a newspaper columnists salary even back in the 70s,lol. Sadly, the real Bradford House was torn down in the 90s. This house shows up in several TV showsRockford Files, Murder She Wrote, Quantum Leap to name a few throughout the years. But it will always be remembered best as the Eight Is Enough house.
Am I wrong but are there only 2 bathrooms in this house? LoL. For 10 people? Hilarious to watch the kids wait in line for their turn. And while were on the subject of kids, most of them are way older than the parts they play. Obviously they were in their early to late 20s while trying to play teenagers. Ive been a little distracted about that while watching. It makes it awkward and silly sometimes when the issues they deal with are teen ones but they all look older and should have been through those things already.  This is where you have to suspend your disbelief.
The first season is a real jumble. In the very first show we have a different Tommy, Nancy and whoa! Luke Skywalker as David! Not sure if Star Wars came out before or after this show aired but I suppose we can guess why Mark Hamill did not return. Our new David, Tommy and Nancy show up in the 2nd show. I cant imagine anyone else playing David other than Grant Goodeve and even though hes supposed to be only 22 he looks about  26 or 27. Then theres the matter of Diana Hyland who died after 4 episodes. Shes in an episode then disappears. Shows up again and disappears. Nothing is mentioned about her dying until the beginning of Season 2. I thought this made for an awkward transition but guess it couldn't be helped because of what was really happening behind the scenes with her death. (She died in boyfriend (at the time) John Travoltas arms!)
Other age matters: In real life Joanie is actually a few months older than Abby who plays her stepmother. I cant understand why they didn't go with younger actors and actresses. Was there a shortage of them in the 70s?
Another thing I noticed: a newspaper columnist who doesnt know how to TYPE? In many scenes we see Tom PECKING away at the typewriter with 2 fingers. How can a writer not know how to type?
The kids don't have after school jobs? Most of them are in college but in a house that size you would think Pops would all want them to help out.
Only 2 cars for that big a family?  I grew then and our family only had 1 car. Pretty much the norm but now I have to chuckle at this in todays world.
I didn't remember how much Tom is always yelling. Hes not a very likeable character on the outside though his scenes with Nicholas are very touching, those are my favorite. We have to understand the incredible stress hes under with that full house and being a widower on top of that. Mary is another character that isn't very likeable. Her and her issues get annoying sometimes. In real life she was Robby Douglas sister from My Three Sons. Every time I see her face, I see him, they looked so much alike. Some of the issues are ones kids today may not understand, like the ROTC on campuses. (Or do they still have that? Im showing my age) Also when Tom thinks Mary is involved with a black guy, they conveniently dodge the whole situation by giving him a fiance. Weve come a long way in our attitudes toward inter- racial relationships (or have we?!) Then I think,wow,this show is 40 years old this year. Seems like only yesterday. What happened? I blinked and boom! Its 2017. (Yes it happens to all of us,lol)
The stand out players here are, of course, everyones favorite little brother, Nicholas. My God, is that the cutest kid on earth or what? There was a scene with Nicholas and Mary where he obviously messed his lines up but it seems like they just went with it and kept it in. Maybe that was in the 2nd season but that so CUTE. OMG, the cast must have had a lot of fun filming with him.
To me, the show really didn't come alive until Abby shows up. Her vulnerability is so endearing and truly makes her the heart of the show. She always seems on the verge of tears and it seems so REAL. But thats next season. Dick Van Patten, of course, has to get kudos here even though hes a little rough around the edges you can tell hes a really good dad and plays the part convincingly (except for the typing!)
Unfortunately there are a lot of sad stories behind the actors once the show was over. I looked each one up and most did not do much acting past the 80s. Disheartening to read about Nicholas, how he dropped out of school at 17 and has had trouble with drugs. Same with Tommy and Susan and Mary (who ODed years ago). Sadder still was the death of Michael Thomba, good friend Greg Maxwell the doc, who tragically died in 1982 from cancer. That was a surprise. Maybe Eight Is Enough was the high point of their lives. I know it was one of mine, once a week. Ah, if we could only go back to when Eight was Enough to Fill Our Lives With Love",1510358400,,5581,4.2781456953642385

I guess when it was released for tv, that was what the times called for but I just do not remember so much of the politics in it.  I only bought one season because when I sat down with the kids to watch it, I was not too happy about it.  Guess that was the beginning of the indoctrination through television programming.
