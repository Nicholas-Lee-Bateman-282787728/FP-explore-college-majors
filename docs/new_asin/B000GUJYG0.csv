8134777,5,B000GUJYG0,I believe I saw this one time on life time and couldn't get it out of my head.  I went searching for a different movie and came up with a list of movies that I have been looking for. Thank goodness for the list that helped me find this movie again.  Kate Nelligan  is a wonderful actress just like in little house on the prairie.,1297728000,2,329,4.030769230769231
