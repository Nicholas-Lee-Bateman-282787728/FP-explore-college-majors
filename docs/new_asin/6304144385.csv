I'm giving up my dream of Medical School at Northwestern to be a farmer. I really want to learn how to work the ""Manuer Machine"" Man Fun all over the place.. Just don't be near the rear of the machine!",992563200,,329,4.15625
8221733,5,6304144385,"Bought any kids' videos lately that they watch once and then never look at again? Well this isn't one of those! Your children will enjoy it over and over and so will their friends (as well as yourselves if you take time to  watch!) Beautiful countryside, wonderful people and adorable animals - what  more could you want? Oh, maybe an award winning creator (Chris Fesko) and  real farmers doing real farmwork with real animals? This is it then. No  cartoons here, friends. This is the real deal, one the whole family can  watch and enjoy.",944438400,4,538,4.621052631578947
8221734,5,6304144385,"Chris Fesko is a master at bringing farm life right into your own living room with this video. The videography of the animals are up close and imaginatively done. NOT a cartoon!! Music, as in all her videos, is one of  the key elements that make this film extraordinary. The section showing the  mother cow licking off her newborn calf and it's first staggering steps to  nurse is so very precious. Chris uses tender, soft flowing music for this  portion that helps to portray the bonding and miracle of life. Anyone who  enjoys animals would LOVE this film.",939686400,,558,4.653061224489796
