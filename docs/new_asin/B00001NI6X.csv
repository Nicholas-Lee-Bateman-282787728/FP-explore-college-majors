Actually, not at all, Ana and Otto are brought  together again and again for most of their lives by small coincedental  situations, learning an enormous lesson: it's not the coincidences, but  destiny itself who brings them together.

1245758,1,B00001NI6X,"I found this movie cold, heartless and anti-romantic. It sets up romantic situations and then pulls the rug from under you. I didn't find either of the alternative endings, one 'happy' and one tragic, at all convincing. But I'm probably just an old fogey.
OK, so it's a romantic tragedy, and when the director manipulates the plot he is doing what Shakespeare does at the ending of Romeo and Juliet.  I always found that contrived, too.  The trouble is that unlike Romeo and Juliet, who are kept apart by powerful forces that create a genuine tragic tension, there is nothing to keep these lovers apart but a series of ludicrous coincidences.  Or non-coincidences; can anyone believe that two lovers can sit 10 yards apart at different cafe tables and not notice each other?  And what became of the co-pilot, that's what I want to know...
I didn't like this movie, even though it contains some beautiful sequences.  I feel a bit better about it on reflecting that modern Spanish films tend to show the antithesis of Franco's Spain.  Because people were once repressed, now they have to go to the other extreme and be casually amoral at all times.",950659200,4,1146,4.733668341708543

1245760,3,B00001NI6X,"Spaniards love passion, tragedy, danger, secrets, coincidences, fate, and possibilities fused into a spicy stew.  This movie pushes all of those elements to the absolute limits of what is believable.  If you are the gushingly romantic type, watch it anyway.  If you demand logic, reason, or consistency, it may irritate you.  All this is symbolic of the extreme places love can carry young people.",1360108800,,397,5.15625

1245762,2,B00001NI6X,"One always lives in hope, perusing DVD's for a good night's entertainment.  Both the title and book cover indicated a film focused on Lapland, specifically Finnish Lapland on the Arctic Circle, with an old Finnish tango song to introduce the film.

No, this film focuses on the selfish and broken families of modern Spain, where after some break-ups, a new family is formed where the ""brother"" and ""sister"" are the same age.  They fall in love with each other as children and become real lovers by their teenage years, right under their ""parents"" roof.

The film is trying to present a very strained version of Pan's Labyrinth, where people are walking around in pain and suffering and loneliness all on their own, hence making those around them also very sad and lonely.  The viewer is supposed to root for Otto and Anna,  young lovers/siblings, as true and loyal.

Naturally, things fall apart.  They each go their own way for years, cannot find each other, won't communicate through the old father or the new mother on the wearabouts of the lost lover.

Ultimately, in a fit of pique over a finished live-in relationship, the daughter Anna, now a teacher, decides to take off for Lapland in the summer (thank God!) to see the Land of the Midnight Sun.  It never sets on June 21st, imagine, and she dreams of reindeer for reasons unknown to any of us viewers.

The son Otto, knowing that his grandfather had been a German pilot in WWII, decides to become an airmail pilot and fly to Lapland on a regular basis.  Yes, they're both fixated from photos seen in a schoolbook years ago.

The film hops and skips all over, until finally the two are reunited in Lapland, only to find that ...well, there's been a terrible accident on the streets of Rovaniemi, capital of Finnish Lapland.

I found myself fast-forwarding constantly through long staring sessions of these characters, waiting for some kind of real plot or resolution, or at the least, something about Finland and Lapland.

What we see of Finland is an absolute minimum.  I had spent a long time in Lapland and wanted to see it again in film, but what does one see?  One street scene in Rovaniami, and one lake scene , and some trees along a road.  That's the Lapland they've dreamt of, and that's all, folks!

A DUD.",1327449600,,2275,4.656641604010025
1245763,4,B00001NI6X,"Everything can change in the blink of an eye.

This is a beautiful story of missed chances.  Alas, one of those missed chances was on the part of the director.  But it is fixable.

I will give nothing away, for there will be many who will enjoy the story exactly as it is, and heaven bless them.  Certainly, the premise is worthwhile.  Otto and Ana appear to have been meant for each other from the moment they meet as young children.  But Otto has a selfish streak, little commented upon by other reviewers.  And it is this selfishness that creates each of the disasters that tears him and Ana apart.  He is building up a karma -- if you don't mind the mysticism -- that is working against what would otherwise have been his fate.

But Otto seems to have learned his lesson and we the viewers are rooting for him and Ana.

Then, his last broad gesture is itself stupid and dangerous and impulsive (involving the piloting of an airplane) and results in the final events of fate in the curious sequence of coincidences that are the fabric of this movie.

And I didn't like the ending.  So a five-star movie gets four stars.

But I promised it was fixable, easily fixable.  Life can change -- as I said -- in the blink of an eye.

So there it is:  Imagine if you will the last 1/10 of a second of this movie.

And add the blink of an eye.",1323561600,,1336,4.254980079681275
1245764,2,B00001NI6X,"Though I am a great admirer of Medem's work, I found this movie very unsatisfying. Considering the movie's ending, the thick web of coincidences really lead nowhere.",1235952000,,165,5.148148148148148
1245765,4,B00001NI6X,"In Lovers of the Arctic Circle (Los Amantes del Cirulo Polar) Spanish director Julio Medem creates a love story that does not fall into melodrama the way that most of today's love stories fall.

Otto and Ana meet as children as a result of an incredible series of coincidences. As they grow up they become secret lovers and eventually they separate. Following the separation each feels a longing for the other that is unlike any love that they have ever known. Passing each other and intersecting with each other's lives over the years they never reconnect until it is too late.

Medem uses the device of coincidence to highlight the circular nature of our lives. This is a film that doesnt give all the answers to its audience. It is a film that makes you think and reflect upon the reasons things happen as they do. The first half of the film is one of the most romantic films that I have ever seen. Some of the emotion is lost in the second half as Madem tries to tie things up too neatly but this is still an international film that deserves to be seen by a wider audience.

The HVE disc presents the film in widescreen with a Spanish Dolby 5.1 soundtrack. There are no bonus features except for the trailer. Madem went on to direct the festival favorite Sex and Lucia. See this one to get a glimpse of an important director at the beginning of his career.

1245766,5,B00001NI6X,"Ok just a bit about your reviewer here... I'm not a big fan of ""chick flicks"" and if you tell me you've got a great movie I should watch, but it's got subtitles, well then there's a certain place we all know of that's surely going to freeze over before I watch it.

That all being said, I just got a DVR and was recording a days worth of movies off of one of our HD channels and this was one of them.

Although it kills me to say it, I truly enjoyed the film.  I speak enough spanish to get me by, but not enough that I could follow everything they were saying in the movie, so I was more or less reliant on the subtitles to get me by.  I found it curious how when the focus of your attention is to what is going on, on the screen and your movie experience isn't solely driven by what you're hearing from dialog you tend to appreciate a movie much more.  The film was definitely worth watching.",1161561600,5,894,4.0
1245767,4,B00001NI6X,"Not like I have been looking to get this movie on dvd, but it is great to see that this movie from 1998 has arrived on dvd, and I bet on an all new video tape, for those of you that still buy video tapes regulary. The best thing Ican say, even if you know what the story of this movie, even through this movie is in Spanish, there are English subtitles. The movie is told from the eyes of both the 2 main characters of this movie, Otto, and Anna. If you don't know what the story of this movie is, well you should. Eight years old Otto (Peru Medem), is playing with a ball one day after school in the playground, and the ball gets away and into the woods, Otto chases after it, and meets Ana (Sara Valiente). He feels in love with her, and then the story goes back in a flashback to show how Ana got thier in the first place in first of the many chance meetings these 2 go through in the whole movie, Ana's father has passed away, and she runs away, and gets lost in the woods, and meets Otto, in her eys she thinks this is the her late father back from the dead, as a little boy. Then in one of these coincidences, Otto throws paper airplanes, and Ana picks one of up, and gives it to her mother, telling her it is from ""that man"" which is Otto's father. Otto's parents are dirvoced, and Ana's Mother is widowed. And then they meet and fall in love, and then Otto and Ana becomes step-brother and sister, and then lovers as teenagers. Then as adults they become seprated, when one of thier step-parents dies, and Otto finds himself gulity of it, and rins away, and becomes a pilot, guess where they meet once again, well let's just say I will not give it away for you, if you want to find out what happens, I urge you to watch this movie.",1157068800,4,1739,4.102639296187683
1245768,5,B00001NI6X,"I've seen this movie multiple times, and it always astounds me. Worth every cent!",1145491200,5,81,4.857142857142857
1245769,5,B00001NI6X,"Julio Medem, the spanish director of the foreign film 'Lovers of the Arctic Circle,' is one of the greats of our time.  This film is based upon two simple ideas: coincidence and palendrome.  The events in the painting of this picture intertwine so strongly that each brush stroke is relevent and deliberate.  In other words, every detail is important.

The film is presented in a disjointed format.  It jumps back and forth from the two main characters adult lives to their childhoods.  This format seemed to do justice since the story has many chance coincidences between the main characters, Otto and Ana, where they meet each other without actually meeting.  The journeys that Otto and Ana take to find the other again reveal the incredible energy that they share between them.

The other theme of the story is the use of palendromes (where the word is the same backwards and forwards; i.e., DAD, MOM, BOB, NOON, POP, etc).  So the names of the characters, Otto and Ana are palendromic.  The story goes into some detail as to why this is so important to the characters' lives.  In case you haven't already noticed, even the director's name has this trait.

Julio Medem is also known for the film, 'Sex and Lucia,' which is another powerful film.  Najwa Nimre is in both films, and is one of the most beautiful and talented international actresses.  The other actors and actresses are also great examples of fine cinema.  The storyline and plot of the film is enthralling and is loaded with ideas of what is tangible and what is not.

The VHS version of 'Lovers...' does NOT include a behind the scenes look or interviews that the DVD will probably contain... I do not know for certain since the DVD has not yet been released in the U.S.  All aside, I recommend purchasing this film if you want to add a highly evolved well-written, well-presented, unconventional love story to your collection.",1141084800,,1896,4.749235474006116

1245773,4,B00001NI6X,"That's what young Otto's father asks him in Julio Medem's Los Amantes del Circulo Polar, and quite frankly, something I'd like to ask all of you.  The two were having a conversation on one of the philosophical aspects of life.  ""Everything needs to be cyclic.  Everything begins and ends.""  ""That's life,"" according to the father.  ""Happy and sad.  Everything expires over time.""
The story concerns Otto and Ana, two children who met when they were eight, and whose lives become entwined further when Otto's father and Ana's mother marry.  However, the beginning shows Otto as a pilot delivering long distance air-mail and flashes back and forth to his childhood and adolescent years.  As for Ana, we hear her voice over a cinematically beautiful scene of a lake reflecting the salmon-coloured sky, as if it were a lake of pink lemonade, the sun dipping down lower until looping back up in time-lapse photography.  She says she could tell the story of her life through coincidences, and is waiting for the biggest one of all.
The action cuts between Otto's POV and Ana's, so certain scenes are repeated, but we hear both character's thoughts, which provide insight into their characters.  Both children have experienced losses.  Otto's parents have split up, and Otto was closer to his mother.  His mother is similarly counsels him on the impermanence of things.  ""Life's tribulations have to be taken with humour because they come and go.  They don't last forever.""
Ana lost her father in a car accident and sees Otto as a reincarnation of her father, a present from her father for having died early.
The story of how Otto got his name, when his grandfather rescued a German pilot named Otto who was shot down over Guernica, plays a key role in this story of coincidences.
As time goes on, Otto and Ana fall for each other, and Otto even moves in with his father just to see Ana everyday.  Despite not being biological siblings, they have to hide their love from their respective parents.  However, the tide turns when Otto's mother dies, and a suicide attempt reveals the guilt Otto feels in giving too much attention to Ana, thus separating the two.
The two leads also appeared in Alejandro Amenebar's Abre Los Ojos, Fele Martinez as Pelayo and Najwa Nimri as Nuria.  As Otto and Ana, Martinez and Nimri pull sterling performances, exuding individuals going through their pained lives.
One series of shots of Otto and Ana being at the same square, but at different tables, barely missing each other, is intriguing.  Otto is seen to the left, reading the want ads, and to his right but farther back, we see Ana, her back to him.  It's one of those heartwrenching moments when I want to leap in and say, ""Behind you!!""
The use of palindromic names, Otto and Ana symbolize the circular and eternal qualities of love.  And check out the director's last name--Medem.  And the Arctic Circle, beyond which the sun never sets in midsummer, also represents that eternal flame of love.
Yes, the ending is a bummer, but not so much.  However, I'd sure like to know what question Otto wrote on that paper airplane.  And maybe someone else who has seen this movie can tell me if there is something that lasts forever.",1062374400,20,3207,4.7594936708860756
1245774,5,B00001NI6X,"I happened to catch this one on TV one night and was so impressed and intrigued by it's content that I have purchased it...  After reading the reviews of other's, I find no one has addressed what I feel this movie is so beautifully portraying.  Not only is it a wonderful and moving love story, it is also what I call a ""Bardo"" story.  The best one yet in my opinion.  To me it shows what happens at death (at least from the viewpoint of the one who has died), depicted in this movie as if nothing much really happens but the life we believe we are in continues with only some minor changes.  In this movie the two main characters, Ana and Otto, actually die several times.  The way the movie unfolds it appears as only a bright flash of light and then their apparent journey in this world continues.  Not so apparent until the end is that they have both gone into the ""bardo"" and in fact perhaps we are all in the ""bardo"".  If anyone else was aware of this I would love to hear from them.  The story is told from the viewpoint of the two main characters, switching back and forth to their perspective of what is occurring.  Behind it all however is something much more profound happening, and could give us a long pause for thought regarding what our beliefs about death are and what other possibilities exist.  Whoever wrote this story was truly enlightened regarding reality/illusion.  I intend to watch this movie many times to remember something so easy to forget; death has no real power to those who love.",1060041600,18,1512,4.418772563176895

I don't know how to put the brilliance of this movie into words. In the vein of ""Pulp Fiction"", ""Run Lola Run"", and ""Before the Rain"", ""Lovers of the Arctic Circle"" is a complex movie that dares to defy conventions of storytelling--using multi-perspectives, circular storylines, coincidences. This is not for everyone, since some people just like their stories to be flung onto their plates, challenges aside.
The story penetrates into the psyche by not telling it through one person's eyes--but both--the two lovers, Ana and Otto. This method of storytelling heightens our perspectives and increases the depth of emotion and thought. The story tells how Ana and Otto fall in love as children, and how their love only grows stronger throughout the years, despite trials and tribulations. Both perspectives weave in and out, combine once--and split at the very end. One ending is happy, the other is tragic--one is Ana's, the other is Otto's.
This movie will haunt you for days afterward. It will force you to think about love, life, coincidences, fate, destiny, the unique twists and turns that life gives us, and the beauty of it all . . .
Of all the movies I've seen in a lifetime, and that's a lot for the average human being, this is one of the most profoundly unique I've ever seen.
