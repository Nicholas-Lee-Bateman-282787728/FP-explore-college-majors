7825378,4,6302379334,Pleasantly surprised to find this treasure of early movies of leading men before they became stars. If you're  a movie history buff you might  get a kick out of this collection. There are no classics here but the stories held my attention.  I am satisfied with the vendor I ordered these from too.  .,1431561600,,300,4.5
