8339396,5,B001S2Q52G,"True this material is technical; climate change and sustainable energy are technical subjects.  It is very well presented and not, ""too technical"" as another reviewer states.  especially if used in a class as the harder-to-understand-for-some-audiences present fantastic opportunities to discuss and research more.

This is the quintessential presentation I would choose to not only thoroughly explain the 'situation' we are in but also the 'solution' or more accurately the need for everyone to understand how important it is to exercise a viable solution.",1335312000,2,557,5.686746987951807

I'm not into this professionally but I'm a concerned amateur teaching a course on the subject to other seniors. ""Saul Griffith"" is a highly technical lecture that is of no use to me or to my course, although the book may be useful to professionals in the subject matter.",1305676800,2,340,4.683333333333334
