7854232,5,6303832423,"This rich, entertaining documentary is largely a film version of Gertrude Stein's gossip-filled autobiography published in 1932, which she cleverly mistitled The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas. It combines passages from  her writings with vintage photographs, amateur film clips, her famous art  collection, her lyrics set to music, and brief excerpts from delightfully  candid conversations with people who knew her in Paris, among them Virgil  Thomson, Genet, Maurice Grosser, Jacques Lipschitz, Daneil-Henri Kahnweiler  and Bennett Cerf. Dozens of other key players are also remembered: William  James, Ambroise Vollard, Pablo Picasso, Henri Matisse, Juan Gris, Carl Van  Vechten, Ernest Hemingway, Ezra Pound, Edith Sitwell, James Joyce, T.S.  Eliot, Thornton Wilder and others. So it's far more than simply the story  of Stein and her life with Toklas. There is never a dull moment in this  fast-paced, jam-packed guided tour of the emergence of Modern Art, both  literary and artistic. (Review copyright  1999 by Roy R. Behrens from  Ballast Quarterly Review, Vol 15 No 1, Autumn)",950572800,32,1088,5.560975609756097
