3919795,4,B002EWD0BI,"As someone who has taken a workshop at kripalu and gone to a retreat in vermont with ashley this DVD is almost as good as being live with Ms. Turner.
  What you get on the DVD is a great workout in a short amount of time.  You get bits of Ashley's sage advice.
Since I live in Vermont and she (Ashley) in California, I am not blessed to be able to take her classes all the time, there for doing this DVD reminds me what is important and kick's me into shape!
  This is by far one of the better yoga DVD's in the sense that you actually get a work out.  I think alot of them are kept at a lighter pace so beginners won't hurt themselves, but I find them frustrating as someone who is more intermediate.  Half the time I turn them off midway.  To slow, or not enough difficulty.  This one is not like that.
  I will definetly do this DVD on a regular basis!",1258416000,12,855,4.0
3919796,5,B002EWD0BI,"I went on a retreat with Ashley a few months ago, and was excited to hear that I could order the DVD for my home practice. She's a fantastic instructor and  more importantly a Life Coach!  You get so much more than a tight tush with this one!",1258243200,7,242,4.020833333333333
3919797,5,B002EWD0BI,"I found this DVD to be absolutely wonderful!  I thought it was practical and although I am at a very high fitness level I found it to challenge me very nicely. I did the DVD yesterday and I am already sore today in my obliques, upper glutes, legs and shoulders.  I also believe that adding this yoga workout could promote weight loss!  I felt so much better when I finished yesterday.  I wasn't fatigued or worn out.  But I felt energized and in a ""new place.""  I thought the instructor was wonderful and calm.  Element DVDs are fantastic! I look forward to more excellent workouts!",1256515200,9,582,4.485714285714286
3919798,5,B002EWD0BI,"I recently started practicing yoga again after stopping a few years ago and have been looking for something new to replace my old DVDs. I bought one of another well-known yoga instructor's DVD and found it to be very challenging and not for beginners/intermediates as it was advertised.

Ashley Turner's ""Yoga for Weight Loss"" was just what I was looking for. The poses and pace make for an excellent cardio and core strength workout, and afterwards, I feel relaxed and accomplished. Ashley's voice is calm and encouraging and her instruction is clear and concise. I find her to be very motivational and look forward to more DVD releases from her.

As for the reviewer who's sour about the intro: I personally find it comforting to know that I'm taking instruction from someone who is qualified and think it should be mandatory for all instructors to give their credentials on their products. *smile*",1255824000,126,900,4.9144736842105265
3919799,3,B002EWD0BI,"The core of this workout is  acceptable power yoga  with the usual  vinyasas--sun salutations and dancing warriors. It's fine for beginners with some yoga familiarity, has an acceptable flow, though there's little here I haven't seen in many other power yoga DVDs. Turner has a calm voice, gives some form pointers and cues well.  I wouldn't recommend this to an absolute yoga beginner, but it might be all right for a first power style practice because the pace is slower than some.

Every ""Element"" DVD I've seen has been a worthwhile product.

I was annoyed though by Turner's introduction, that she teaches ""celebrities,"" and is a ""mind/body expert"" holding  a Master's degree in psychology. I can skip the ego display, thank you.  Her affirmations, sprinkled throughout the practice (presumably evidence of this formidable mind/body expertise) were similarly juvenile to me.  Anyway who claims herself a mind/body expert has just proven she isn't one.

I wish video instructors would teach without talking down to their audience.",1255392000,9,1034,5.212121212121212
3919830,3,B002EWD0BI,"I really like Ashley Turner but if you have any of hwr other videos, this one is quite similar so no need to buy more. If you don't have others, then yes, it's good. But, I like the 5 day alot since I can pick the length of my workout easily.",1481414400,,242,3.764705882352941

3919832,4,B002EWD0BI,"I actually really liked Ashley and her cool and confident style. I appreciated her explaining the benefits of yoga to the mind, body and spirit. This DVD may not be for beginners but hey, there's no stopping you from pausing and rewinding when needed until you get used to the flow and movement. I broke into a sweat with this and felt it was challenging for my skill level (beginner).  I only wished there was a bonus track with a more advanced workout or an alternative to the main workout just to break up the monotony. But it will be a while before I will feel the need to upgrade as I am toggling between this and other Yoga and Pilates DVDs.",1478563200,,647,4.30327868852459

3919834,5,B002EWD0BI,"Absolutely love this yoga DVD and instructor (highly recommend checking out Power Yoga, too). A great holistic practice that combines strengthening, flexibility and mindfulness. Challenging but not enough to dissuade me from showing up to practice, regardless of the time of day. In this 8 years I've been practicing yoga, this has truly been one of the best DVDs I have found.",1470700800,,377,5.096774193548387
3919835,5,B002EWD0BI,"This is a great yoga DVD. I love Ashley's uplifting words and detailed, yet easy to understand, cuing.

The more I complete the DVD, the more I'm able to push myself.",1467849600,3,307,4.4035087719298245

3919851,5,B002EWD0BI,Another great video by Element.,1453766400,,31,5.4
3919852,4,B002EWD0BI,This dvd is a good workout and I like the setup of element yoga dvds. However depending on what you are looking for sometimes she moves too quick when I am unsure of the moves bc I am a beginner so I find myself watching her more then performing the poses. Still a good workout and good yoga moves though. Just have to watch a few times to know what you are supposed to be doing.,1446508800,,379,4.0
3919853,4,B002EWD0BI,"Very good yoga practice.  It wasn't super challenging so its not intimidating.  It was a good gentle kind of power yoga, not the most difficult practice I've done but it was a good pace to keep your body moving and help get your blood pumping a little.  Not one of my favorites but still a good practice that will help get you in shape, do your daily yoga without being strenuous on your body.",1446422400,7,393,4.283783783783784
3919854,5,B002EWD0BI,"This is a solid workout, and one that I enjoy doing. I especially like the way she seamlessly offers alternate poses depending on the level of your abilities, and I can notice my improvement the more often I do it.  Highly recommended.",1446249600,,235,4.595238095238095

This DVD jumps from floor to standing postures, is hard to follow and the pace is super, super slow. Very disappointed. I doubt I'll use it. :-(",1442102400,,275,4.612244897959184
3919859,1,B002EWD0BI,My dvd came to me broken and with some sort of smudge over the crack/right next to it,1440979200,,85,3.7777777777777777

3919882,5,B002EWD0BI,"This really is great for beginners, I was in really good shape and then lost it during a long hard time in my life, but doing this makes it easier to get back into the daily routine of working out because it's relaxing and hard enough to see results, but easy enough not to kill me!",1434844800,,282,4.053571428571429
3919883,2,B002EWD0BI,Normally like Elements teachers. Would give it more stars if instructor wasn't so arrogant. It's not super difficult but for a beginner it's hard. It's annoying you cant skip (at least not on my computer) her speech about how awesome she is and how she works with celebrities. Not sure if I have or will loose any weight on it but I am going to continue giving it a try a little longer.,1433116800,,386,4.301369863013699
3919884,5,B002EWD0BI,"I really like this yoga DVD. I am new to yoga, have some trouble with carpal tunnel & have fibromyalgia. Many yoga DVDs spent most of their time on the wrists -- this one uses some wrist time too, but not extra-ordinary amounts of time. The location is great, her voice is soothing and I like the verbal messages to de-stress. There is nothing out there affordable for fibromites right now, specifically for us; I feel this one can be used safely. It's not too intense and it's thorough for hips, upper back and lower back, and not too intense on the neck. It's also easy on the budget. Well done.",1428278400,6,597,4.387387387387387

3919887,4,B002EWD0BI,"Good instructor; music not quite in tune with a yoga practice.  However, as an intermed. yoga practitioner, I thought the practice could have a bit more postures that are helpful when one is trying to lose some wgt. which is not the case with me.  But, for a beginner, this is a good place to start and Ashley's tone of voice and explanation of asanas are helpful (not that we westerners ever remember them).",1425254400,,408,4.5
3919888,5,B002EWD0BI,"I'm not yoga pro, but I'm not a beginner either, and this yoga workout always makes me feel like I've gotten a good workout in at the end of the day.  I'm not huffing and puffing, but I feel like I did something good for my body. If you're looking for a slow-paced, meditative beginner yoga, this may not be the video for you. She's not fast-paced, but I think she moves at a normal pace with the positions she uses to promote weight loss, which may not be the best thing for beginners. I find the combination of the Element brand yogas really are all-encompassing as far as getting a well-rounded yoga experience goes. The backgrounds are peaceful, and the instructors always speak at a low voice volume that maintains the calm within. She's very knowledgeable and experienced in the art of yoga, and she uses her background in psychology to encourage her viewers to remain positive within themselves while practicing yoga. I really enjoy the uplifting and mindful aspect of Ashley's teaching and I enjoy having her as an instructor!",1423008000,8,1034,4.681318681318682

3919910,1,B002EWD0BI,I really wanted to like this dvd. It is a good workout but my back hurts every time I do it. I agree with the other reviews about the introduction to the routine. I wish that were separate but I just fast forward through that part. The worst part about this dvd is the constant psychobabble. She goes on and on as if to see how much of it she can fit into the routine. There is nothing soothing about it and I finish frustrated instead of rejuvenated. The savasana is the worst!  There is no way I can get quiet and centered during that time with her rambling on incessantly.  I finally threw the dvd away so I wouldn't be tempted to try one more time.  Wasn't a good fit for me.,1421712000,4,679,4.090225563909774
3919911,5,B002EWD0BI,My favorite. I probably do this 4 times a week before work. It is something to build on but yet not too hard. Each time I do this routine I find small areas where I have improved.,1421625600,2,179,3.864864864864865

DVD was under 10 bucks - so not really worth the effort or expense to return.  Bummed.",1415923200,,242,4.333333333333333
3919936,1,B002EWD0BI,"This DVD only frustrated me. I guess I might be the only one that feels this way, but a lot of the stuff she said didn't make any sense. I am new to yoga, definitely not for beginners. I barely made it through 10min before I got so frustrated I just shut it off. At one point she says to spin your inner thighs. Maybe Im just too new to yoga, but that makes absolutely no sense. I had to constantly stop to look up and see what exactly shes doing because she talks so much and so fast I cant comprehend what shes saying to do as Im trying to get my body to do it. I ended up just cussing up a storm and going with my more trusted DVD and instructor.",1415836800,,649,3.8507462686567164
3919937,5,B002EWD0BI,Love.  I thought it started out a bit hookie but she is a nice change.  I generally do Warrior Yoga from Bob Harper.  I like to push myself.  She does this without too much knee pain.  I have found MOST of the Jillian Michaels tough on the knees.  I like this one.  Plus the view of the sunny beach in the background is relaxing!,1415664000,,329,4.046875
3919938,5,B002EWD0BI,"This workout is not only extremely empowering and confidence boosting, but it really makes you sweat and challenges you. I used to do yoga and pilates pretty regularly but when I got a pinched nerve, I gained about fifteen pounds and got completely out of shape. This workout kicked my butt but it also made me feel so good and grounded. I could feel my blood flowing more easily and she ends with a great meditation of empowering words and affirmation. It's about 50 minutes long but the time goes by pretty fast. I really recommend this workout! (It's not for intermediate or advanced people but I doubt that you'd need this if you're intermediate or advanced!) Anyway, great workout, totally worth it.",1415318400,,704,4.7317073170731705

If you want a smooth refreshing routine that makes you feel great for hours that you'll actually look forward to every day try a Barbara Benahg yoga Dvd.

I was told I have adrenal fatigue from so much heavy cardio, and to slow down and do more strength training and yoga, and this is fitting the bill.  It is a good work out, and I walk away feeling centered and positive.  Ashley is the best teacher I have found, she is amazing.  It has made me wake up to the mind/body philosophy.  She is so knowledgable in the mind/body technique, in psychology, positive thinking, and setting your intention.  Through out the video she sprinkles these topics and I finish  feeling so positive, that I want to learn more.

3920095,5,B002EWD0BI,"Ashley Turner is a fantastic yoga instructor. She states in the intro that you additional cardio to lose a lot of weight, so if you're thinking of buying this DVD specifically for weight loss, it will work so long as you include other exercises as well.

The first time I did this workout, I couldn't make it all the way through. It is a fairly challenging routine, though you will get used to it as you do it more. It's been my regular routine for the past few months and I did lose weight while using it regularly (and doing other things, including tracking what I eat). I've started to branch out in my yoga routines, so I'm hoping she'll come out with another vinyasa yoga DVD soon! I highly recommend this routine.",1374105600,,719,4.406015037593985

This DVD is peaceful but challenging. I really feel like I get a lot out of this workout, physically and spiritually. Ashley is great!",1372982400,,142,4.68
3920099,5,B002EWD0BI,"I have many yoga DVDs as well as most of the Element DVDs.  This yoga DVD has many positives.

Instructor:  Ashley Turner is great.  It's done voice over style, which I prefer.  Her instruction is so clear, that you rarely have to look to see what she's doing. Her narration is also on time with her movements, unlike some DVDs.  Her voice is soft and soothing.  One of the things I like about her instruction is that she's very positive in her comments, not just instructing on what to do, but also what to think, as in ""think about your goals."" She says she has a master's in psychology, and it shows.  I'd like her to do more than two Element DVDs she's done because her comments are so positive.

Set:  It's filmed outdoors in a beautiful garden with an ocean setting.

Music:  It's not ""yoga"" music, but it's instrumental and nice.  The tempo changes with the actions.

Level:  This is done well enough that beginners could follow along easily.  I think beginners to lower level intermediates will like it.  Those with an advanced practice will be bored.  However, this is one of those that's nice for days when you don't feel like doing much.  That said, it can be challenging if you're out of shape or recovering from an injury and you lack muscle strength and endurance.  These are easy poses, and the instructor is very good about telling you how to get in and out of them. The most advanced is bow pose (dhanurasana). It's a nice choice for those getting over injuries, as I am.  She's good about indicating how to modify for neck, shoulder, back and knee issues.

Production values: Excellent sound, filming, views, etc.

Overall, it's a nice beginner or light yoga DVD.  Its greatest strength is the positive messages from the instructor since there are many DVDs out there for beginners and filmed outside.  It's not one I'll do often, but it's nice to have around when I want to move but am feeling low on energy and need some positive energy.  I have many to choose from and I can see myself pulling this out on a cold winter day when I'm feeling blah and need a breath of fresh air to get me going.  It also leaves me feeling loosened up and relaxed.

As for the weight loss part, it seems that the mind/body connection is what comes into play. You'll burn more calories doing power yoga or by exercising.  However, this yoga DVD is good about getting one to connect how the body feels with the mind.  Many people have a disconnect between their brains and bodies, and a DVD like this could be very good for someone who needs to lose weight and doesn't have body awareness.  I've seen people lose weight through yoga not because of the physical exertion, but because yoga helps them to appreciate their bodies, and from there, they start making better food choices and/or feel good enough to exercise.",1372896000,,2817,4.529761904761905
3920100,5,B002EWD0BI,"I really like this video.  It's easy enough that I can do all of the moves, but it really gives me a workout!  It's also very intuitive.

3920137,3,B002EWD0BI,"I can't say I really like this DVD. On the one hand, there are parts that are challenging, but for the most part I find this DVD unenjoyable. It doesn't really satisfy my need for a yoga practice. I end up putting in a ""real"" yoga DVD afterwards to satiate that craving.
Some exercises have an excessively long description and lead-in as she walks you through. That's great the first time you do the DVD, but after that, it just gets annoying and you want to get to it already. Speaking of annoying, I'm truly sorry to be rude, but her voiceover is extremely annoying to me. She talks a mile a minute and never allows for a moment of quietness or concentration. Her manner of speaking is that of a valley girl having lunch with her girlfriend. To me, it's not relaxing or soothing. In a normal, non-yoga setting, her voice would be just fine. But she doesn't seem to know how to bring it down a notch for yoga instruction. Even through shavasana, she yapped quickly and incessantly. It made me crazy because I just couldn't relax. She's trying to cram in as much inspirational talk and instruction as possible. I'd prefer only the necessary information to safely and effectively do postures. And I cringe every time she orders us to smile. I know I sound a bit mean-spirited, and I truly am not trying to be. I am just sharing my honest feelings about the DVD.
Some things I like: some of the postures make my muscles burn big time! She shows variations so that you can take it up a notch if you're capable. The scenery is nice.
I don't really feel like I'm going to burn any more calories during this program than many of my other ones. Quite the opposite. So while yoga may not be about burning calories, that's how this DVD is billed and I guess I expected more from it.",1365292800,7,1773,4.39209726443769
3920138,4,B002EWD0BI,"I'm new to yoga, but I was sore after doing this video and not that uncomfortable sore but that good, I got a great workout and can still move without severe pain sore.

I love that she is wearing a very simple yoga outfit without all the ego trappings of the more high-profile instructors. You get a sense that you are practicing as equals. And it is all about the practice for her. I am very happy with her emphasis on alignment, and the mind-body connection. I have experienced deep results from this DVD, in body, mind, and improved, more mindful eating habits. I also love the music, which is a bit different from the usual ""Tibetan flute"" yoga-type music that can be a bit annoying and repetitive at times. Instead, the music goes through several genres, at times almost R&B-inspired, or Spanish-guitar inflected. It is a welcome distraction during some of the more difficult poses!

My mom could do this workout by taking child's pose or D-dog when it got too hard and yet it made me sweat and shake and gave me that good yoga buzz.  Highly recommend.

3920198,5,B002EWD0BI,"Unfortunately, I cannot review this program from the perspective of a true yoga expert...honestly, when I bought this DVD, I was just interested in adding some new life to my old workout routine.  I was also interested in learning about yoga, rather than the ""yoga-based"" workouts that I'd done in the past, but that still came second on the priority list.  Anyway, I am absolutely blown away by Element: Yoga for Weight Loss!  This program has now taken the place of all other DVDs that were once in my rotation (although I still do a separate cardio routine).  The instructor is fantastically knowledgeable and encouraging and gives prompts right on time.  The workout is challenging and SO rewarding; it is truly a full-body blast.  Also, there are enough modifications presented that I feel as though I have plenty of room to grow with this routine.  Yoga for Weight Loss is something that I actually look forward to doing everyday--I seriously can't wait to do it!
Now, I am a mom of four little boys, so I really have to MAKE THE TIME to work out (no snacks for 45 minutes, people, don't even ask--that's the rule!), but my kids really love this routine, too.  They are always trying to keep up, which makes for great comedy--but more importantly, it makes me feel good to see them taking an interest in such a wonderful practice.  As for results, after one month of performing this workout for an average of 4 times a week, I can see some positive changes in my body; I've noticed some increased muscle definition and I am slowly seeing an increase in my flexibility, but--and I never thought I'd say this due to my inclination to work out for vanity's sake--what is more impressive to me is how I FEEL now.  I am so much more relaxed in my daily life.  Now that I have been so inspired by this practice, I have started to read up on the tradition of yoga so that I can hopefully grow and truly appreciate the history and methodology in its entirety; I realize even scratching the surface is a lofty goal, but I'm going to have a go at it!  What more can I say, go ahead and experience this now, you have everything to gain!",1346025600,40,2131,4.492227979274611

The poses stretch and tone muscles all over the body in a well-balanced way. I like the length too - just under 50 min of yoga so it's easy to find time for. I can see myself doing this DVD once a week or maybe more as a standard workout, and as I get stronger I'll find a few other DVDs to add more challenge. Thanks Ashley!",1342137600,,487,4.083333333333333
3920201,4,B002EWD0BI,This DVD is a great one indeed. I didn't give it 5 stars just for the simple fact that I tend to enjoy a workout a bit less serious.

3920202,2,B002EWD0BI,"I was disappointed.  I quit after 30 minutes.  :(  It was very challenging, but it was also really boring to me.  And I didn't feel like I was flowing the way I do with some other DVDs.

The poses felt repetitive, mostly focusing on using the leg muscles or doing some version of push-up pose.  I was missing stretching and lengthening poses, and balancing.  And honestly I slightly pulled a muscle in my side during this practice, and I'm very physically fit (I'm a dancer, I do yoga, and I also do other forms of cardio).  It was during the dancing warrior segment, and I've done dancing warrior no problem before with Shiva Rea's practices.  I wasn't warmed up or stretched out enough to do boat pose either by the time I got there.  All in all I was really disappointed.

I do think it's nicely shot, and challenging, and good if you like to hold poses for long periods and repeat them.  If you like faster moving flows that use more of your whole body, and you want to feel stretched out, then maybe this program isn't for you.  I fast forwarded a bit to see if there was anything coming up that would be different, but I found more of the same.  So I can't say how the very end went.

Something I thought was weird:  I don't usually take 2-3 steps from downward dog to get to forward bend, nor do I take steps to get into push-up pose from forward bend.  She also spent a lot of time explaining, which is good for the beginner but too much for me.  But yet at the same time, I can see this being way too hard for a beginner.  It was hard for me and I've been doing yoga on and off for a decade.",1340236800,6,1600,4.153094462540716
3920203,5,B002EWD0BI,"I looked at a lot of reviews, both good and bad, concerning this video.  Now that I have it and have used it, I want to disregard all the negative reviews.  Some hated the beginning, I thought that's great, fast forward and don't listen to it then!  Some hated the style, that's okay, I might like it.  Some were embarrassed to use it around their spouse, I have a habit of memorizing the movements and then going somewhere else when my husband is home to exercise.

I guess what I'm saying is: I was a little apprehensive because of the negative reviews but decided to get it based on my thought process listed above.  Now that I have it, I think the intro is short and to the point.  It tells me she's experienced and trusted in this area.  I find her narrative really good.  She doesn't have what I think of as a dreamy voice that makes me feel bored.  Her voice is matter-of-fact and even.  She gets you into the spirit of it and allows for those of us that are not yet into a more experienced level.

I find my limmbs have that tingley, shakey feeling you get after a good workout after only a half hour.  And that makes me feel good!

Overall, I think this is a good video for someone who's looking for weightloss and toning and who is new to yoga.",1337472000,85,1254,4.214285714285714

A friend and I decided to buy all three of Ashley's yoga DVDs Element: Yoga for Weight Loss, Element: Power Yoga and Element: Yoga for Stress Relief & Flexibility figuring we would some days need a bit more challenge and some days need more of a calm class.  We do our yoga together at our homes so we figure it is a pretty cheap workout for the two of us.  We are both ""regularly"" fit ladies but not at the peak of our fitness (so... we used to run but we haven't for a couple years ha ha).  We were able to do all the posses (not all of them as pretty as they should be but that will come) of our original disc Yoga for Weight Loss right away but there is still lots of room for us to get much better also.
I've tried quite a few yoga DVDs and this one is one of my 2 favourites.",1333670400,4,898,3.9175824175824174

3920257,5,B002EWD0BI,"I have been using this DVD for over a year now and haven't tired of it.  The moves are challenging enough to get a good sweat and stretch at the same time.  While I'm not that limber, I am able to go at my own pace and position.  I keep thinking that some day I will be able to do the advanced positions, but I'm not discouraged as I do see  and feel results.

3920259,3,B002EWD0BI,"She does a nice job explaining what to do. Yet, I find it hard to believe this is a weight loss yoga dvd.  I don't feel like I burned any extra calories doing this yoga practice, perhaps it is because I have been doing yoga for several years now.  I think it should be named something like 'relaxing yoga' or 'calming yoga'.  I felt good after this yoga, but not like I had a strenuous workout.  If you are looking to calm yourself and stretch, this is a fine dvd.  If you want to burn lots of calories, you should select something else. I personally felt like I burned more calories with her power yoga dvd.  Jillian Michael's yoga meltdown probably burns more calories, but that one is shorter and not as great for stretching.",1324598400,3,728,4.355555555555555
3920260,5,B002EWD0BI,"I purchased 4 yoga videos from Amazon based on their reviews and this one is my favorite. There is a little more psychology to it than I really prefer, but the combination of poses is definitely the best. It is not just vinyasas and balancing poses, and she doesn't hold all of the poses for too long. She adds some abs and some back exercises that I feel are missing from some of the other videos. And she adds some yoga push-ups to add to the arm toning. Some of the other videos probably give just as good of a workout as this one, but I enjoy doing this one the most. I will definitely purchase another one of her videos.",1324425600,2,625,4.1735537190082646
3920261,5,B002EWD0BI,"I've gone through many yoga and exercise videos, and this one's a keeper. It's one of the 2-3 yoga videos I find myself coming back to. The production values are all great (scenery, music, voice-over, etc), and the routine is nicely balanced and paced. It's not the toughest workout, but it's also not the easiest (and probably not good for complete beginners). It always challenges me (especially the back-bends) and leaves me feeling as if I've done a good thing for myself. The narration is very helpful without being overly cloying, and every pose is useful and integrated into a nicely paced routine. However, if you don't enjoy a little motivational psychology with your yoga, you might not like this as the instructor feels free to provide positive living advice during the poses.

I am embarassed to put this dvd in if my husband is at home because I don't want him to laugh at me listening to ""sometimes when we think we are hungry all we are really needing is a hug or a smile"".

All this does not seem very relevant - I just want to exercise and not listen to how great she is. There is nothing unique about the workout - it contains pretty standard ashtanga poses I do every week in my yoga class. Some poses are held longer than usual or repeated more but that's about it.

This DVD takes a holistic approach towards yoga and health and well being, talking you thru the asanas (poses) while demonstrating them, and also ensuring you are mindful of your weight loss goals. Its not too hard for beginners, yet structured to flow for those who are advanced with additional, more difficult asanas. I find the DVD to be inspirational, even when I don't want to practice, and the time (about an hour incl. the meditation at the end) goes quickly and starts my day off well. I can't say whether it will make me lose weight but I do work up a sweat and I'm sure it will tone my body and enhance my well being overall.

3920278,5,B002EWD0BI,"As someone relatively new to yoga (and interested in losing a few pounds), this DVD was exactly what I was looking for. Several times during the workout I felt like giving up, but I find that the instructor never pushes you TOO hard--which is good. Right when you feel like you're about to break, or rather your thigh muscles are about to explode, she gives you a big, well-deserved stretch. Also, I'm not one who usually buys the relaxing yoga zen talk, but this woman's voice is extremely calming. It helped me power through the workout, and her words of encouragement and congratulation at the end left me feeling very relaxed and accomplished.

Although the workout is challenging (or at least it is for me), by the end of it I'm left feeling happy and relaxed. This DVD is awesome.",1312848000,4,786,4.614285714285714
3920279,4,B002EWD0BI,"I purchased this DVD after reading the Amazon reviews and have to say that I was not disappointed at all.  It is a great workout.  The instructor gives great instructions and cues for the yoga moves.  It moves a bit slower than some of the other Yoga workouts I do, which is a nice change up.  My boyfriend just recently started doing Yoga with me and he found this to be easier as a beginner than some of the other DVD's we have done together.  If you decide to purchase this DVD you will not be disappointed.  Great for a beginner who is brand new to yoga and for a seasoned beginner (such as myself) who is familiar with the moves.",1311120000,2,634,4.198347107438017
3920280,5,B002EWD0BI,"A rank beginner, both in yoga and in exercise videos, this DVD gave me exactly what I expected and needed.

I have attended 16 or so yoga classes prior to this video, so I at least knew some of the moves.  A few were new to me.  But, the video covered them in enough detail to do them even if you did not.

I found the best way to approach using a video, as this was my first time, was to watch the video through once and then the second time, do the routines.  Initially it was fast, but later when you know the routines, it is the perfect length.

One issue I had is with the breathing. The duration between breaths that the instructor said to take and what I needed to take, was not in sync. Maybe when I get better, I won't be gasping quite so much.  Not sure if this is a common thing or not. Suspect it is more of a conditioning thing.

I'm an overweight woman in my 50s and to go from downward dog to warrier pose, is not as gracefully as the yoga instructor shows.  However, I get there my way and this video works for me.  I was drenched halfway through and had to towel my face off.  Anyone that does not think yoga is not strenuous has not done it. The chair, table and superman pose and the warrior dance (variations on the warrior poses), are one heck of a work out.

Having read complaints about the intro, I don't get the big deal.  Subsequent plays did not even bring it up.

Can't tell you yet if you lose weight from this, but after I use it awhile I will repost.

AN UPDATE:
Having purchased even more videos, this one really stands out. It is one complete workout that I can do. As I said I am overweight. I also, have issues with my knees and really rigid ankles and feet, but, I can do all of this workout. I can't say that about other workouts. There are some other beginner videos that have kneeling poses, or some more extreme poses (despite their beginner label) that I just can't do.  Additionally, the pace is reasonable.  She keeps you moving and working out.  Some other videos had one convoluted pose after another, that though I have been through the video 2-3 times, I can't quite get, nor keep up with.  This is a keeper and one heck of a workout.",1308441600,8,2181,4.162291169451074

I plan on buying the other two Ashley Turner Yoga DVDs with my next Amazon purchase.  I didn't have a yoga mat, and my hands kept slipping on my carpet- so I put on my weight lifting gloves (I have a cute turquoise pair:) and they worked perfectly, and provided a little extra cushion for the downward dog poses.  As  a complete beginner, some of the poses were challenging, but I was able to complete the entire workout with the 'modifications' and I look forward to building up the stamina to do a real yoga push-up, among other poses.

Yoga has not been the same without her.  I was SO excited to see she finally has a DVD out so I could at least get a hint of what I got out of her classes.  As soon as I got the DVD, I checked it out.  It's a wonderful DVD with a nice flow that will get you to break a sweat.  As a comparison to her classes, I would classify this as a ""beginner-intermediate"" class.  One look at Ashley, and it will get you to do what she tells you.  She obviously knows what she's doing!  I can tell you after six months of classes with her 2 to 3 times a week, I was stronger and more centered than I have ever been.  The video will do the same for you if you commit to doing it.

Ashley is great at reminding you about postures, getting you to set intentions, and overall giving you positive affirmations that help you find balance in your life and in your yoga practice.

I was annoyed at ""Sue's"" negative comments regarding Ashley's intro, where she declares her certifications.  Ashley is in no way braggadocious.  Sue obviously has never taken any classes with Ashley and unfortunately, completely misperceived the intro.  A note to Sue:  Give the girl a break.  It's her first video.  She's a yoga instructor, not an actor.  It's possible that the Element producers scripted her speech at the beginning.  Besides, it doesn't take away from what the purpose of the video is all about, which is to give you a solid yoga workout that will help you achieve positive results in your life.
