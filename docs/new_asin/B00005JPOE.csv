1567369,5,B00005JPOE,"History.  Overcoming discouragement.  Looking at something besides the American point of view.  Living your faith.  And real romance.  And all this is accentuated by good acting, accurate period costumes, and beautiful scenery -- NOT dependent upon blatant sex, violence, and vulgarity.  The plot's twists are amazing because they are real, not drawn out of a hat.  The people are unique because they actually were unique individuals, not because a skilled casting director got actors with different personalities.  Worth seeing repeatedly.",1178496000,7,540,5.6625
1567370,5,B00005JPOE,"As most of the reviews here are complimentary (as opposed to at Hollywood video, I would like to respond to some of the criticism found there. Sorry, this movie does not have a whole lot of car (carriage) chases, houses afire,  sordid sex scenes or other Hollywood staples). What it does have is heart. William Wilberforce almost single-handedly stood up against a noxious totally-ingrained-social institution and changed the world. This accomplishment was executed quite well in the movie. True, 'Amazing Grace,' does chronicle the end of slavery in Britain (and years before the Americans saw the light, at that), but it does so much more. By the way, Ioan Gruffudd performed beautifully.
  As to the take-away value for today; Are we today overwhelmed by certain noxious-totally ingrained-social-institutions?
Oh yeah. How to prioritize them: Consumerism, oil dependency, corporate malfeasance, and the sensationalism rampant in the press all make life less than it could be.
  The champions standing up for new directions on all these fronts can take a page from Wilberforce's book. As to the title of this critique, Margaret Mead's full comment was ""Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful committed citizens can change the world; indeed, it's the only thing that ever does.""",1177632000,11,1285,5.248780487804878
1567371,5,B00005JPOE,"I went to see Amazing Grace with the teens of my church as a chaperon.  I did not really know what to expect with the exception that I was told it was about the abolition of slavery in England.  What a great story for all to learn that it was the Anglos in England who were amongst the first to abolish slavery.  It is not a story we hear much about.  Wilberforce got religion as they say.  His mentor, John Newton, who wrote the hymn 'Amazing Grace,' taught him about what slavery was.  In the theatrical version of the story, Wilberforce wanted to go into the ministry.  Newton suggests to him his calling is to free the slaves, to make that his life's work.

Oh that we had such passion for the things of this life today.  I liked it becaused it showed about the potential in man to accomplish great things if he has a heart.  I am a believer in God, yet, not a religionist.  Religion, sometimes, causes more difficulty because it is so much like men and not like the God that it is attached to.  Wilberforce lived his religion.  Who knows though, maybe he was an enlightened soul, who really was against the crown, or maybe he really saw the commonalities between himself and the Jacobites in France.  He was able to hold forth in his battle in the Parliament.

It is a story like no other in recent times.  I hope that more come to see it, that it gets its time in the media.  We never really heard much about it.  It is a story for everyone.  Historical, with a strong ethic for the love of mankind.  Wilberforce and his story will inspire people to stand for what they believe.  In the times we live in today, it is rare for people to stand up for what is right.  Wilberforce is an example of almost unwavering commitment to a cause.

The world was better for his efforts, I think you will be better for seeing, Amazing Grace.  I am getting the DVD.",1176681600,21,1856,4.267241379310345
1567372,5,B00005JPOE,"""Amazing Grace"" is an exceptional film that chronicles the amazing true story of William Wilberforce, the man who spent twenty years in the British Parliament fighting to end one of mankind's greatest injustices: the slave trade. The film features powerful performances by an outstanding cast, including Ioan Gruffudd (""Fantastic Four,"" ""King Arthur,"" TV's ""Horatio Hornblower"") as Wilberforce, whose faith and courage drove his fight for social justice. Albert Finney gives an amazing performance as John Newton, the former slave-ship captain turned pastor, and writer of the beloved hymn ""Amazing Grace."" Michael Gambon, Romola Garai, Youssou N'Dour, Rufus Sewell, and Nicholas Farrell give outstanding supporting performances.
The rest of the crew does a fantastic job of bringing the world of 18th/19th Century Britain to life. ""Amazing Grace"" is an amazing film that shows how men of faith can truly help change the world. Amazing Grace, indeed!
Grade: A",1176508800,162,959,5.530612244897959
1567373,5,B00005JPOE,"This film is focused on the little known, at least in America, but historically important William Wilberforce (Ioan Gruffudd) who played a vital role in putting an end to the African slave trade in Great Britain. The slave trade was abolished there in 1807, over 50 years before it was ended in the United States. This was especially significant because it was, to the best of my knowledge, the first time a political movement had succeeded in stopping the slave trade throughout an entire nation. It also went on to serve as an impetus and inspiration for the abolition of slavery throughout much of the world. Slavery, of course, being an oppressive practice that dates back to the earliest days of humananity and that has existed throughout world history, including today in parts of Africa, such as the Sudan.

Director Michael Apted does a beautiful job of accurately portraying this important era in British history, with a fascinating set of characters that include Prime Minister William Pitt the Younger (Benedict Cumberhatch), Wilberforce's wife Barbara Spooner (Romola Garai) and former slave and abolitionist writer Olaudah Equiano (Youssou N'Dour). I especially enjoyed the character of John Newton (Albert Finney), the ex-slave trader turned abolitionist preacher who wrote ""Amazing Grace"".

The movie is passionate without being self-righteous. It also manages to add some depth and nuance to it's characters, especially Wilberforce himself. He is depicted, later in life, as being disillusioned with politics and addicted to the opiate laudanum before his relationship with the young, idealistic Barbara manages to revive his hope and give him the energy to return to Parliament and eventually help pass the legislation that outlawed the British slave trade. An additional nice touch is that it shows how Christian evangelicalism has not always dominated by right wing Republicans. But instead were once leaders in the movement for progressive social change.

This is a very fine film worthy of a large audience. I hope especially that young people and African-Americans turn out to see this movie because, as Bob Marley once sang, ""If you don't know your history, then you don't know where you're coming from"". Go see it!",1176508800,21,2238,5.22841225626741
1567374,2,B00005JPOE,"The target audience for this Michael Apted directed sleeper, best I can tell, are probably any reluctant conservatives out there who are in the market for the experience of, for just once, being on the side of something right and just. ""Look honey, not only are they against slavery, but they are for free education! I'm lovin' this being a liberal thing."" As I've stated before, anybody can beat up on a conquered issue but it takes one brave soul to go after a pressing issue of the day. We need more movies like ""Road to Guantanamo"" and fewer movies like this. And there really is no mistaking who this film is aimed at. It is a throwback to the early 90's art house, when they were filled almost exclusively with little old ladies and proper entertainment like this. So as we wait around to see if slavery is actually abolished we get to watch rich white people enjoying their mansions. Our hero William Wilberforce (Ioan Gruffudd) flirts with a girl two times just so that they can justify throwing a wedding up on screen. We get death bed scenes that spew the virtue of faith. And we get a happy ending that is happy because it results in procreation. Yeehaw!

I pick on my dad a lot because he refuses to see costume dramas (""Take and adventure"" I say) but he does have a point, these things always tend to be stale. At the center of the story is William, who we learn led the charge in England to do away with the grand tradition of forced labor. It is a whitewash as Williams appears as saintly as can be which means that he is not a character but an ideal. He builds a coalition, collects signatures, and battles a very neutered opposition led by Ciaran Hinds and Toby Jones (or Julius Caesar and Truman Capote if you prefer). There is no drama because we know how history turns out, and since the characters are either bad or good we can't turn to them for excitement either. There is some sly humor mixed in, but unfortunately most of the jokes were duds (although I'm sure the gag where he pops out of the slave box killed with those aforementioned little old ladies). So there I was, stuck watching a movie that had no interest in doing anything so as not to offend anybody.

I do find it disheartening that this film did so much better at the box office than Apted's last film ""49 Up"" ($19 million to $240,000) because that one was so much more intelligent than this one. Of course viewing habits in this country are disgraceful and the people only seem interested in showing up if you pander to them. In the middle of the film William tricks a bunch of stuffy pro-slave types into listening to his speech by promising them one thing and then delivering another. This gave me hope that, maybe possibly, Apted would pull a similar trick and deliver an unforeseen shot to the audience. But no such luck. On the plus side it does take a loving look at a true act of bravery in the campaign for equal rights for all. And Ciaran Hinds is always a welcome face. Still, those who are unseasoned in the art of sitting quietly through something of this type should stay home because it is exactly what the preview makes it out to be. I have no doubt that Apted's intentions were pure when he sat down to make ""Amazing Grace"" I just feel that somewhere along the way it turned into one big back patting session for Americans everywhere. **1/4",1176508800,11,3347,4.423014586709886
1567375,5,B00005JPOE,"There is not much I can add to the previous review as far as importance and story.  A period costume piece this film most certainly is not: it's a timeless story of the triumph of good, determination, and perseverance, and a very human telling. Well-written, beautifully scored, finely acted and gorgeously filmed, ""Amazing Grace"" is a treat for the eyes as well as a balm and inspiration for the heart.  I must give kudos to the excellent makeup team - they've done an exceptional job with the entire cast, particularly Ioan Gruffudd (Wilberforce) and Benedict Cumberbatch (William Pitt), both of whom portray men often battling illness and addiction throughout the film.  As a former makeup artist I am very impressed with their work, especially with regards to ageing the characters.

The cinematography is beautiful and lush as well, rich with texture and very fine small touches.  The colour is gorgeous.  Some of the images will stay in my mind for some time!  The score - which I purchased immediately after seeing the film the first time - is beautiful and organic.

Finally, the cast is absolutely perfect.  Gruffudd as Wilberforce turns in a wonderful performance, portraying a man driven by his dream and hope for a better world.  Benedict Cumberbatch, as yet unknown on this side of the pond, was particularly excellent and absolutely sublime as Wilberforce's best friend and PM William Pitt the Younger.  His acting and carriage is quite impressive, and if he chooses his scripts wisely, he's likely to have a golden career.  The beautiful Romola Garai plays the intrigued-by-Wilberforce and abolitionist Barbara Spooner; her character wanting to hear Wilberforce's story is our vehicle for hearing the backstory as well as encouraging Wilberforce to continue his work.  Albert Finney convincingly and honestly plays a minor role as John Newton, composer of the great hymn ""Amazing Grace"".  Finney has a few of the film's best lines.  Michael Gambon does a sound and often entertaining turn as Lord Charles Fox (in general Pitt's fierce enemy but aligning himself with Wilberforce anyhow); Ciaran Hinds is perfect as Lord Tarleton (really, he is).  Senegalese singer Youssou N'Dour plays the former slave Olaudah Equiano, a prominent abolitionist; I found myself wishing he'd had more screen time and opportunity to flesh out his role.  As Equiano, his screen presence is quite powerful.

I do wish at least a little more attention had been paid to Wilberforce's faith, a vital part of his life.  That aside, ""Amazing Grace"" is free of the heavy weights political correctness and the twisting of history in order to make sides look good.  It's the story of Wilberforce's battle to abolish slavery without silly, vapid or disparaging embellishments.

Overall this is an excellent and enjoyable film, but more than that, it somehow manages to soothe and inspire at the same time.  I cover world events, politics, and culture, which can be exhausting and depressing to the spirit.  This film was definitely part of the cure for me, and others have said the same thing about the movie.  We saw the film for the third time this evening, and the theatre was still half full although I suspect its run here is just about over (of course we have to make room for more inanity and torture-tainment, don't we?).  But if you can find it, I can't recommend it highly enough.  It is rare for me to give five stars to modern films, but ""Amazing Grace"" deserves it.",1175817600,49,3463,4.948096885813149

1568166,3,B00005JPOE,"I may be the lone reviewer among many but I only recently watched this movie and for me, it didn't have the emotional impact and the sway I hoped it might conjure. The inspiration behind Amazing Grace seemed to be mentioned only in passing with some remarks by Albert Finney who plays the author of the song, John Newton. Instead of seeing flickers or memories of what haunts this man that compels him to live like a monk with the blood of hundreds or thousands of men, which could have the impact or emotional sway, we instead are given examples at a dinner conversation where Rufus Sewell's character who joins a few others at the bidding of the to be prime minister to show William Wilberforce how the chains are intended to work. Then onto a ship, where the same William invites aristocrats to smell the scent of death. Obviously the audience cannot share in this experience....it's not tangible nor can it be seen.

For a song of such power that transcended the centuries, I was left feeling disappointed that this movie didn't live up to it's potential. It's a movie about the abolition of the slave trade in 18th century England and there is one token black actor, Youssou N'Dour who speaks little, sheds a few tears when prompted and hopes for a better future at the hands of 'white male saviors'....our two main protagonists, William Wilberforce and William Pitt the Younger although, historically speaking, while Pitt was a friend to Wilberforce, he was known for his fiscal management and implementation during the French Revolutionary War and aftermath as opposed to movements regarding abolition, which seems almost contrived.

Sadly, Twelve Years a Slave, this is not. But if you enjoy seeing a bunch of British actors petitioning in the House of Commons and playing the role of the 'white male savior' and having a movie, which is about slavery, which remarkably, shows scant little to nothing about the actual slaves or have black people at all in the film, then, this is for you.

But it was dull for me. I hoped for better.",1474156800,,2041,4.743661971830986

1568232,5,B00005JPOE,"Good history and better drama.

This film can be seen from several viewpoints -
1) English political history explaining how slavery was 'abolished' in the British Empire.
 2) Biographical presentation of the life of William Wilberforce and his influence on abolition.
3) The impact of the ""evangelical'' movement in Britain during the nineteenth century.
4) Description of the reasons and economic justification of slavery.

Every scene adds to the narrative. From the opening shot of Wilberforce defending an exhausted horse suffering a beating, to the touching romantic story of how he met and married a beautiful young woman, to his deep friendship with Pitt, all add wonderfully to our understanding of Wilberforce and his world. Marvelous!

One theme that runs throughout is the religious motives of the abolitionists, with the exception of Pitt and later Fox. Wilberforce is recruited by the evangelical movement since he is a prominent member of parliament and shares their faith. When Pitt is dying, he reveals 'I am afraid', then adds 'I wish I had your faith'. The evangelicals support and embrace the former slave Equanio. He talks and writes in ways that touches the heart. Great!

Wilberforce and his deep pain of heart and then physical intestinal agony clearly presented. Doctors prescribe laudanum (opiate) that affects his metal state. He finally abandons that treatment. The French Revolution and then the napoleonic war, convulsed England with war fever.  Wilberforce and his focus on slavery was viewed as anti-English. He was reviled. His health, his emotional state, his mental outlook, all suffered. Who wouldn't?

Nevertheless, he started again. What a inspirational example to - never give up, never give in!

One poignant scene is Wilberforce arguing with Clarkson over the ongoing French Revolution. Clarkson believes it will bring 'the perfect society'. London will (should) be next. Wilberforce responds 'a imperfect order is better than no order at all'. Sternly forbids Clarkson from ever mentioning revolution in England again. Good illustration of the difference between France and England.

My wife and I watch this history with my grandson each year. Find more details and insights each time. The clear value of genuine faith, and the astonishing impact, highlights the contrast with today's world, where faith is out of sight.",1471910400,17,2362,5.327956989247312

1568343,5,B00005JPOE,"This film is an excellent, fictionalized depiction of the life of a historical British politician named William Wilberforce, who was key in the abolishment of slave trade in the British Empire, in 1807.

As can be imagined, those who profited from slave trading and ownership were ""in bed"" with most of the politicians whose ranks Wilberforce joined when he was elected to parliament circa 1790. Eight anti-slavery bills which he introduced were prevented from becoming law between then and 1805.

This film depicts the political and personal adversity William Wilberforce contended with throughout his struggle with himself and others to come to grips with (and do something about) slavery.

Although this film initially seems to advance the liberal agenda that white men, especially of British descent, are responsible for evil such as slave trade, this film redeems itself by showing how certain Englishmen and women united with black people to peacefully, legislatively abolish slavery in their empire, and minimize it even among the French and Portuguese, almost sixty years before the Americans abolished it by means of their literally bloody Civil War.",1467244800,,1159,5.357142857142857

The film may, or may not, have been true to Wilberforce (Hollywood isn't always accurate, of course), but it presented the story in an interesting, often inspiring way and I thought the acting good.  Albert Finney played the author of the hymn, Amazing Grace, a man whose story I have known about for many years.  Finney was excellent,, though we only get a thin pie-slice of the man's life.  It's hard to know if my five stars comes completely from this being an excellent film, and how much comes from admiring the work that Wilberforce did.",1465689600,7,792,4.588652482269503

It is set apart from other similar films in that it is well made and can stand up next to any popular period-drama. It's not a cheesy Christian film that so many of us were used to growing up. As with any movie, historical accuracy was loosened in the name of cinematic effect (Newton, to my knowledge, did not serve his penance mopping floors; he was a pastor).

1568463,5,B00005JPOE,"Amazing Grace is an amazing movie to watch. It tells the story of how this great song came to stir in the hearts of those who have come before us and those who have come after. This hymn will be a hymn that is sung for generations to come. Understanding the story and why it was written and the time frame it was written and sung makes you understand that Amazing Grace is such fun a sweet sound, especially under the circumstances this man had to overcome and how he changed the heart of people and truly showed that each soul no matter what color you are has the same value in God's eyes and we truly are blessed to be saved by grace and grace alone. The character chosen to act in this movie couldn't have been chosen any better. The dialogue is rich and with easy to listen to and understand European English of the day. The costumes were perfect and the sets were perfect.

The breadth of this man's accomplishment spanned the entire globe as eventually the entire British Empire abolished slavery.

1568775,5,B00005JPOE,"I found out about this movie two days ago from my brother. He and his wife, he said, were deeply impressed with this extraordinary story of William Wilberforce, born into great privilege, who after a somewhat debauched early adulthood, had an epiphany and became England's greatest abolitionist. He also, it turns out, was an animal activist and helped found the British Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. He was active in education reform and very active in the Christian Church, especially in the area he called Practical Christianity. At one point before going into politics, he considered becoming a pastor. Thus inspired by my brother's comments, I looked for the movie on Amazon Streaming and there it was ... so I paid for it and watched it the next night. The movie, it turns out, was released in 2007 to time with the 200th anniversary of the passing of the first abolistionist movement law by Parliament in 1807 ... the law that forbade British ships to carry slaves. It would be another 26 years before slavery was abolished in Britain in 1833 when slaves were freed in most of the British Empire. The movie profiles Wilberforce's passion, ill health, Divinely inspired commitment, deep friendship with William Pitt who ultimately became Prime Minister and especially, Pastor John Newton, creator of the world-famous song that gives the movie it's title, Amazing Grace. It is beyond me how I never knew about this amazing man before, but ... what's good is, I do now, and that's awesome. I've subsequently found out that Wilberforce was extremely impactful to both U.S. President Abraham Lincoln in his early law days, and and civil rights activist Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. who mentions him in his memoirs. This movie is extremely well done, the photography is beautiful, the characters are all very well casted and quite honestly I now feel it is a must-see for anyone who cares about equality, human decency, celebrating diversity, and compassion towards all life.",1449100800,3,1995,4.976047904191617

1568892,4,B00005JPOE,"The movie focuses over eighteen years of Wilberforces campaign to abolish slavery, and he was every bit the campaigner, using every trick in the book. The film had a great cast, cannot fault the casting director, and never skip a movie with Benedict Cumberbatch. The issue is the naive, quick with the give-and-takes in the Commons, but a less astute and calculated thinker than one might hope for in a crusading MP. This protagonist is not exactly as convincing as he could have been, with his indecisiveness and self-doubt. Not quite the movie hero expected.
In the end, what this movie does not make clear is that the bill passed did not abolish slavery, this would not happen for another thirty years. The film focused more on Wilberforce, his home life, the parliament, and less on the slaves themselves.",1444867200,,809,4.827338129496403

1568960,5,B00005JPOE,"This is an excellent movie that seems like an accurate period piece, but really is an intense delving into the complexities of one man: in this case the great abolitionist and English parliamentarian William Wilberforce. It depicts the great influencers upon Williams maturation and evolution from mentors like John Newton and his romantic love, steadfast faith in God, a sense of personal mission, and stubborn, uncompromising personality. The sets and depiction of 18-19th century London is quite extravagant and convincing.
  Particularly, I was taken with the depiction of Wilberforce as a mortal flawed man, warts and all, and yet with blind faith and belief, his ability to achieve great things against all odds. (Note: An (unrelated) film that actually makes a good prequel delving into the faith conversion of Wilberforce's most influential mentor, John Newton, is called ""The Amazing Grace""; both together show the cross generational fertilizing of how great men/women can influence each other over time)",1443744000,,1013,5.445859872611465

1569083,5,B00005JPOE,"A well-crafted film that brings to light the tremendous efforts required to get people to see the inhumane barbarism that was slavery.  It took about fifty more years before America understood its hypocritical attitude toward owning human beings.
I had never thought of the song ""Amazing Grace"" as having anything to do with slavery.  I thought it was a Christian anthem sung in Christian ceremonies.  The movie speaks very little about Christianity.  Humanity is what is displayed.  It could as well have been a Buddhist who sought to free the minds of his fellow citizens from the shackles of human ownership.  The movie is about honor and human beings, not religion.
I enjoyed this film very much.  All of those involved did an excellent job.  What a good film to show what men of conscience can achieve.  I hope it is shown in history classes.
Warning: Spoiler alert.
(After posting this I was alerted by wikipedia that the author of the song ""Amazing Grace"" wrote the song after experiencing a storm at sea where fear induced reverence.  Not exactly what I got from the film.  He even continued slave trading after the song was written.  I'd advise checking out the history of Newton and his song.  It is interesting.  He did become an ardent abolitionist and joined forces with Wilberforce to stop slavery.
I still enjoy the idea that the wretchedness he saw in himself was the same personality defect that could allow one to enslave another human being.  Joining a religion should not be a requirement to seeing one's own hypocrisy.)",1440028800,,1540,4.824427480916031

1569580,4,B00005JPOE,"One reviewer mentioned some additional resources for those interested in William Wilberforce. I will add another resource for those interested in the British abolition movement in general (not just Wilberforce and the characters in this movie). Moral Capital by Christopher Brown is a very good scholarly work with a chapter on the Evangelicals and a chapter on the Quakers involved in the abolition movement.

I have been studying the abolition movement as part of my graduate class on revolutions, and Amazing Grace was an optional item recommended by my professor. After reading Moral Capital and watching this movie, I understand some of the characters involved in the movie and their relation to one another that I would not understand from just watching the movie by itself. Newton was not an abolitionist, it was only with Wilberforce's influence that Newton vocally opposed the slave trade. Hannah More, shown in the movie, was also an important abolitionist, who was in similar circumstances as Wilberforce. More and Wilberforce were well-known public figures who had compelling conversion experiences that challenged them with how to live out their faith in a public area. This was at a time when being a Christian/Evangelical or using your faith in politics was unheard of. If you want to delve deeper in this time period and the challenges that the abolitionists faced, Moral Capital is a terrific resource and one college book that I'll be keeping!

As for Amazing Grace, it is definitely worth a second watch. I watched when it first came out, but watching again after my limited study of these characters and abolitionism, I have a much greater understanding and appreciation of what the film is showing. Watch and learn, study about the abolition movement, and then watch it again!",1429833600,,1797,5.108843537414966

Ioan Gruffudd does a fabulous job portraying William Wilberforce, the great British Abolitionist, and the other stars are also fabulous in their roles playing William Pitt-Prime Minister of Britain (played by Benedict Cumberbatch for all you fans out there!), John Newton, and others. The film takes place as Wilberforce fought year-after-year on the floor of the British House of Commons against the slave trade and for the freedom of the African people. He was so overcome by the atrocities of the slave trade and firmly believed that God created all men to be free, that he fought noblemen and all the powers of the day to end the trade, to the detriment and destruction of his own health. The movie is beautifully filmed and the performances are quite moving, all while the facts of the movie are historically accurate. I HIGHLY recommend this film for everyone, and especially think that any high-schooler studying British History, Wilberforce, the slave trade, or abolitionists, should see this film.",1425600000,2,1045,5.046242774566474

1570024,4,B00005JPOE,"On this single, DVD-disc, Britain's Parliament comes to an explosive head, as lead by the Legendary William Wilberforce, a prominent and controversial member of it. Why? Because he was a man ahead of his time with a historic agenda: To abolish slavery and the trading, thereof. However, the political and social climate of the day, was that the Royal Nation of England, had conquered and owned many colonies and was a leader in the import and export business which included, slave ownership and trading. It's global economy thrived on it. That is, until John Newton as portrayed by Actor - Albert Finney, a former slave-trading, Ship Captain turned Monk and Minister, encouraged his young friend William, to run for Parliament and introduce a revolutionary, Bill of Law. That being, the total eradication of slave trading. Which ultimately, would halt slavery, altogether. He ran for office, was elected and so began the endless years of debates and political intrigue. The recorded moving testimonials by various Parliament members 'for' and 'against' slavery, are revealing of the mindset of the various principle characters within this political, legal and historic fight for representation, emancipation and all encompassing freedom of human beings. The heart of the matter..., are all men really free? Also included within this true-life, historic, Parliament battle, is the Audio Commentary with Director - Michael Apted and Actor Ioan Gruffudd, who plays William Wilberforce. Further depicted, is: 'Finding Freedom' - A Tour of the National Underground Railroad Freedom Center and the Featurette: ""How Sweet The Sound/The Story of AMAZING GRACE."" A world renowned Church Hymn which was written by the Reverend John Newton and originally sung by, William Wilberforce. An inspiring movie of colossal historical proportions that illustrates how one courageous mans' actions and perseverance, radically changed the course of history. And how..., one man views another in light of truth and justice and even more so, in the eyes of God. For ""there is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor free, there is neither male nor female: For ye (meaning..., all of mankind) are all one in Christ Jesus"" (Galatians 3:28 KJV). A moving drama to be sure. Nina Kish",1422403200,,2265,5.259668508287293

1570200,5,B00005JPOE,"I just saw this for the 3rd time. It is marvelous and inspiring. The acting is superb. Dialogue is interesting. The movie flows nicely and is rich without being confusing. Gruffudd is stunningly believable as William Wilberforce, which seems no small feat to me. Too often we see actors put into such roles because they are big name actors, and while excellent actors, they often aren't believable as the brilliant men they portrait. Gruffudd is completely believable as this brilliant activist, great speaker, motivator of the people of his time who resisted being touched by the horrors of slavery, and as a man of deep devotion. Benedict Cumberbatch is fantastic as well, and one feels the friendship between the 2 characters.
What really amazed me is how they managed to create the completely believable appearance of aging in both actors. I believe the movie spans 2 decades and portraits ill health at that. Amazing makeup job (and lighting?)",1419984000,2,948,5.006329113924051

1572102,5,B00005JPOE,"The story of William Wilberforce, and his mentor, John Newton, is a dramatic example of good vs evil. Slavery existed for one reason: Profit. Human beings were sacrificed so that a relative few could become wealthy and others could have jobs facilitating the trade. Newton benefitted financially from being a slave ship captain but he realized the evil and suffered from nightmares. Inspired by Newton, Wilberforce had the courage to take on the entrenched establishment that benefitted from the slave trade economy. In the end, the right thing was done.",1399507200,,554,5.166666666666667

1572213,4,B00005JPOE,I enjoyed this movie more than expected.  It's a compelling personal story of one person who was willing sacrifice greatly for a cause and a story of politics.  I found myself thinking about the parallels to the US and how it took us another almost 100 years to end slavery in this county.,1398816000,,289,4.433962264150943

1572216,4,B00005JPOE,"Wilberforce was a truly amazing guy - his life story is a captivating tale.  This movie covers so much in so little time, that perhaps some of the fascinating aspects of his life might are a bit lost.  Gruffudd is excellent as Wilberforce, covering decades of time from youth to old age.  Cumberbatch is also very good as his friend, the Prime Minister.  I am not sure the almost insurmountable odds against Wilberforce's quest to end slavery, were made clear.  And there could have been more exposure to the horrors of slavery, and hence, Wilberforce's motivation.  But all in all, it was an enjoyable and awesome tale.",1398297600,,620,4.747663551401869

1572412,5,B00005JPOE,"This film was well casted and very realistic. Set during a bleak time during history, it shows how one man never gave up and followed through with helping to end the slave trade in the UK. A very moving and powerful movie.",1394150400,,222,4.309523809523809

It is a wonderful story about William Wilberforce who championed all other different things in society {not just the ending of slavery over in England but because of him, it spread over here in the United States..and albiet ...it took the civil war and Lincoln to finally end slavery here...but Wiberforce got the ball rolling},He also was against animal cruelty,and how people were treated in prison and many other things...some people who gave it a 1 star said that it was about English history,and though the abolisment movement started in England......it was really not about English history,But about the ending of slavery and human dignity...so some people should get their facts straight",1394064000,,929,5.032467532467533

1572415,5,B00005JPOE,"This one really surprised me.  I didn't think it was going to be as wonderful a movie as it is considering the topic of the slave trade and those who fought to bring it to an end in England.  I was expecting a bit more heavy-handedness, but surprisingly no. Through the perspective of Ioan's William Wilberforce character and those who worked and inspired him to action time and again, it truly an outstanding movie.  The cast is brilliant as well.  Incredible how much acting talent they fit into this.  I really cannot say enough good about this.",1393459200,,548,4.608247422680412

1572417,4,B00005JPOE,"This is a good movie dealing with the abolition of slavery in the British island colonies in the new world after the time of the American Revolution. The British had slaves working sugar plantations in the Caribbean islands to supply the homeland. It's an interesting story that predates the US civil war and emancipation of slaves. The acting is good with the characters and story brought to life. That being said the movie may seem a bit tedious to those who prefer more ""action"" and less ""thought"" in a movie.",1393200000,,512,4.7
1572498,5,B00005JPOE,"Amazing Grace draws you into 19th century England/Britain with sweeping filmography and a subtile and well-done script. The actors are well picked and bring important characters who grace the pages of history back to life such as William Pitt the Younger (Cumberbatch). It handles topics as horrific as slave trade and noble as the movement to abolish it with tact, dignity, and respect for history.

Well worth the time and money for this underrated film.",1393113600,,456,5.08
1572499,5,B00005JPOE,I don't think there are many examples of how 1 man can really change the world that are so poignant and relative. One man can be the voice in a revolution and can change the world for good and not evil. Uplifting. I have sung the song for over 40 years. What a revelation.  I can never sing it again without thinking of this.

1572834,5,B00005JPOE,"This drama records how the worst (slave trader) can actually change even to create an immortal piece of art, something you'd never expect to arise from the stench of human slavery.

1572937,5,B00005JPOE,"This movie does not require anyone to provide any reviews to be an excellent gem.  This is what films are all about; to tell stories like this to educate and enlighten others.  People can make historic changes without having to kill others to make a point.  In this case, people fought with their passion and wit to stop the killing and abuse. While the entire cast was excellent, Ioan Gruffudd's stellar performance truly made the mark on this historic epic.  Ramola Garai's portrayal of Barbara Spooner was very impressive as well.  I think all the children in the entire world above the age of 14 should see this film instead of many of the garbage they're fed these days.",1387238400,,675,4.638655462184874

I thoroughly enjoyed the movie and would recommend it to my family and friends.  The acting in it was superb.  I hope that more  movies like this one will be made in the future.  It is a film that demonstrates what Christ can do in our lives if we let Him.  It speaks of salvation through faith in Christ and how our heart is changed in a new relationship with the living God.",1383091200,,494,4.191489361702128
1573042,5,B00005JPOE,"Ioan Gruffudd does an excellent job of portraying William Wilberforce, the British MP who spent much of his lifetime fighting against the British participation in the slave trade. Add to this excellent supporting acting by Albert Finney as John Newton (writer of the lyrics of ""Amazing Grace""), the former slave trader who, upon his conversion, became a pastor and a staunch opponent of slavery, and one has the makings of a truly memorable movie.

But what makes ""Amazing Grace"" an outstanding movie is the compelling and true story it tells of Wilberforce, a man whose strong and abiding faith in the sovereignty of God gave him the strength to persevere against all odds and against the many special interests, both within and outside of Parliament, that profited from the slave trade. Very occasionally someone comes along whose singleminded devotion to a cause is as great and persevering as was that of Wilberforce. We can be thankful for his life and for the fact that it was made into a movie so that today's generations can witness a true profile in courage.",1383004800,,1067,4.895027624309392

I didn't think this movie would interest me but I watched it with my 11 year old daughter and I thought I would end up having to turn it off, but she loved it too.

1573156,5,B00005JPOE,We need men like William Wilberforce to fight for what is right. This movie is beautifully done. I watched it with my family. There are some sensitive parts for children showing the brutality of slavery but it was tastefully done. We had a good discussion as a family about equality and treating others with kindness. William was a man who did not give up on the cause for justice. He is the kind of man we will study as a family and try to emulate.,1381795200,,449,4.294117647058823

1573244,4,B00005JPOE,"An inspiring story of a life dedicated to eradicating one of the greatest evils ever committed by man on man. Abraham Lincoln and the American Civil War may have ended slavery in America, but William Wilberforce was the driving force to end the slave trade years earlier in England. This fact is often overlooked and the film makes a strong effort to correct his oversight in the American view of the end of slavery. If our government had followed Wilberforce's lead, the Civil War might never have occurred and countless lives saved, those lost in war and those lost in the evil of slavery.",1379030400,,591,4.6923076923076925

1573346,4,B00005JPOE,"This movie is inspiring from the beginning to the end.

1573348,5,B00005JPOE,"This movie was recommended to me by a co-worker. I had not heard of it until then which is a shame because this movie is a quiet masterpiece.

The set designs and locations are excellent and reflect the period very well. Ioan Gruffudd, Romola Garai, Benedict Cumberbatch,  and Albert Finney all give sterling performances as William Wilberforce, his wife, William Pitt, the Younger and John Newton (the former captain of a slave ship who wrote the hymn Amazing Grace).

Mr. Wilberforce worked for more than 20 years (along with many others) to get the Slave Trade outlawed in Britain. He had to work almost another 20 years after this movie to get Slavery completely abolished throughout the British Empire. Despite being ill with a severe auto immune disease, Wilberforce was the voice of the abolitionist movement in the House of Commons. He was the political face of a movement that would end slavery in Britain without a civil war.

Ioan Gruffudd and Benedict Cumberbatch do an excellent job of portraying the life-long friendship that Wilberforce and Pitt shared. After I watched Amazing Grace, I read a great deal about Wilberforce and was pleased to see how well the movie stuck to the historical accounts of this man and his life.

I highly recommend this movie to anyone who wants to watch something more than a car chase. I highly recommend this movie for older children. I think that seeing this could open a discussion with children about justice and morality and sheer perseverance in the face of adversity. If you love history, If you love costume drama, If you love a good love story, this is a movie you should see.",1377734400,3,1631,4.790035587188612

Had there been such a person in the United States, we may well have avoided the Civil War.  Ioan Gruffudd shines as Wilberforce, and Albert Finney is remarkable as John Newton, the author of the lyrics of the hymn Amazing Grace.

I would recommend this movie for ages 12 and up. Understanding the ideas in the movie requires a mature mind and is not really for younger children (my opinion).",1371427200,,486,4.729411764705882

I WONDER WHAT KIND OF ANALOGIES CAN BE DRAWN TODAY WITH THE NEW DEMOCRACY. I BELIEVE THAT PRIMARY & SECONDARY,  EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS SHOULD ADD MORE EMPHASIS ON REALITIES.

Ioan Gruffudd is excellent, as always. Frankly a pity he is not in more big blockbusters. Of course the supporting cast had a couple big names in Michael Gambon, Benedict Cumberbatch, Albert Finney, and Jeremy Swift, but Romola Garai really shined as Wilberforce's soulmate.

The movie shows us how William Wilberforce struggled for years to stop British ships from trafficking in slaves.  He was opposed by those who made money from the trade.  William was a young politician who experiences a religious conversion.  At first he considered giving up politics but decides to try to get rid of the slave trade.  He started in 1782 and was unsuccessful for years.  He is supported by a few others devoted to the cause, but for a long time they are unable to convince a majority of the Parliament to stop the trade.  Finally they are successful.

I strongly recommend the movie.  If you have not seen it, track down the DVD now.  It is well worth watching.  It is uplifting to see how a few determined men can accomplish great things.",1361750400,,1027,4.422459893048129

It was thoughtfully made, and the acting was skillful.  It powerfully described the evils of slavery --- without Hollywood's normal graphic emphasis on violence.

The one missing dimension in this movie (which would not be ""politically correct"" for Hollywood to include) was a description of William Wilberforce's deep love for the Holy Scriptures (the Bible) --- which impelled him to strive to abolish slavery as a Christian duty.

His intense study of the Bible (and resulting self-examination) was too huge a part of his life to omit (reference his magnum opus ""A Practical View of Christianity"", which was published in 1797).",1356393600,,657,5.228571428571429

1574312,5,B00005JPOE,"I took my wife to see this at the theater when it was first released and later bought copies of the DVD for ourselves and to give away. This is an excellent film about the most important Christian statesman in history, William Wilberforce. ""Amazing Grace,"" was named after the hymn written by the former slave ship captain, John Newton, who was Wilberforce's spiritual mentor. The film chronicles his tireless fight against slavery which lasted almost until the day he died, forever attributing to him the title of the greatest social reformer who ever lived. The beautiful cinematography and excellent acting immediately impressed me, especially being an independent Christian film. My only disappointment with the movie is that I would have liked it to have explored his conversion a little more, which lead him to question his career and consider the church pulpit. It also would have been nice to explore the spiritual roots of his mindset being against slavery. Before his conversion, he had already been influenced greatly by John Newton and other Christians.

If there is any reason to doubt the connection between legislation and morality, his illustrative life should once and for all reveal the relationship as inseparable. I've also read Eric Metaxas' interesting biographical account, that the movie was based on. Wilberforce has permanently affixed upon the Christian conscience the moral obligation for political action. The idea that one cannot ""legislate morality"" should be forever banned as meaningless nonsense.

  ""Is it not the great end of religion, and, in particular, the glory of Christianity, to extinguish the malignant passions; to curb the violence, to control the appetites, and to smooth the asperities of man; to make us compassionate and kind, and forgiving one to another; to make us good husbands, good fathers, good friends; and to render us active and useful in the discharge of the relative social and civil duties? ""

 William Wilberforce

Wilberforce also highly esteemed William Carey who worked as a missionary to India, together they pressured the government to outlaw such practices as infanticide and suttee (in which Hindu widows immolated themselves on their husbands' funeral pyres). Who knows, maybe a William Carey film will be next. I remember hearing talk of John Newton, but haven't seen anything yet. We'll watch and wait.",1353974400,2,2376,5.2368421052631575

1574492,5,B00005JPOE,"The title of this motion picture is taken from the popular hymn Amazing Grace which was written by John Newton. In this film, Albert Finney plays the former slave trader who once carried slaves across the sea. After turning from the slave trade, he became a minister in Britain. William Wilburforce grew up in his congregation and became a member of the British Parliament where he would contend for the abolition of slavery for 20 years.

The film Amazing Grace is based on a true story and was released on the bicentennial anniversary of the abolition of slavery in Britain. The movie depicts the passion and diligence of those who sought freedom and an end to injustice for those who could not speak for themselves. Albert Finney portrays a humbled man who is haunted by the 20,000 human souls that he harmed.

The movie also has a touch of romance for Wilburforce. His friends try their hand at matchmaking and introduce him to a pretty redhead who is also an abolitionist. In spite of their initial resistance to the idea, the two find common ground and marry. The movie switches back and forth from different times in the life of Wilburforce, from youth to when he is older, which can get a little confusing at times. On a historical note, the close friend of Wilburforce, William Pitt, still holds the record as being the youngest Prime Minister in Britain's history.

1574499,5,B00005JPOE,"I was a little worried that this would be heavy on the religious aspect, but it's not. It's about humanism, really. It's about human decency. Young William Wilberforce (Ioan Gruffudd) was a student of John Newton (played by Albert Finney), who wrote ""Amazing Grace"" after having been a slave ship captain, and estimated that he had the ghosts of 20,000 slaves to keep him company. Wilberforce was also close friends with William Pitt (Benedict Cumberbatch) long before he became prime minister.

This is basically the story of the fight to abolish the slave trade in Great Britain, but the relationship to the American trade is tied into it. Wilberforce just kept pounding away at the Parliament until they gave in, but of course the story is far more complicated than that. He used a variety of tactics to bring home the issue of the cruelty of slavery, including inviting a group of MPs and their wives to an outing on board a boat in the harbor which stopped beside a slave ship where they could smell the stench of blood, sickness and death.

Barbara Spooner (Romola Garai) was a beautiful abolitionist whom Mr. and Mrs. Pitt tried to set up with Wilberforce, which of course made them both a bit put off. However, years later they did marry. (Oh, dear, am I giving too much away here?)

Two faces in this movie, and especially the two voices, may seem very familiar, although I had to look them up on Wikipedia to be sure I was right. The Duke of Clarence, who favors the slave trade because he makes money from it, is played by Toby Jones, who did such a brilliant job of playing Truman Capote in ""Infamous."" Lord Charles Fox, who comes over to the abolitionist side, is played by Michael Gambon, who also plays Albus Dumbledore. And just for fun, Toby Jones also does the voice of Dobby the House Elf.

If you are, then this film is pretty much definitive of its class in being the story of how one man can, within his lifetime, achieve something noble and leave the world in a far better place than if he'd never existed.

Though it is quite a predictable plot - starting with his friendship with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/William-Pitt-the-Younger/dp/0007147201/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">William Pitt the Younger</a>&nbsp;and ending with his success in banning the slave trade - the film maker has done his best to take slightly different tangents, such as including hymnwriter John Newton and making his lesser known wife and William Pitt into central charactors in the tale.
With these charactors, it is also worth mentioning that the actors chosen are generally first rate, and the script they're given doesn't have any special howlers within it.

In being a story that is as well-known as this one, it would be easy to get this film totally wrong. Just imagine a story of Martin Luther King to see how wrong it could go (e.g. doing a 'postmodern perspective' or, conversely, sucking up to his legacy).
But as I sit here in the aftermath of the film, it feels like the first time I'd seen&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Braveheart/dp/B00003CX95/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Braveheart</a>&nbsp;- the movie may not be perfect, but the bagpipes linger on, as does the spirit of the film.

It is not perfectly historically accurate (it does not claim to be a documentary or anything) but I do believe it a generally accurate representation of events and people.

With short paragraphs in school texts and only few movie forerunners (Amastad, Roots), the subject is truely an embarressment to civilization.

1574811,5,B00005JPOE,"This movie chronicles the efforts of William Wilberforce to end the slave trade within the British Empire.  Emotionally stirring with stunning cinematography--the viewer is so caught up in the decades long struggle that the outcome almost seems in doubt.  The supporting cast is superb.  Albert Finney as John Newton--reformed slaver and penitent clergyman (the author of the hymn from which the movie derives its name).  Michael Gambon as Charles James Fox--the consummate British politician.  Toby Jones as the Duke of Clarence--who in life was able to crank out 10 illegitimate children but when he ascended to the throne in 1830 as William IV left no legitimate heirs forfeiting the crown to his niece Victoria. Benedict Cumberbatch as the over-zealous William Pitt the Younger (prime minister at 24).  The chief antagonist of Wilberforce in the House of Commons is the nefarious Banastre Tarleton (deftly portrayed by Ciaran Hinds).  Tarleton was the least popular officer in the British Army during the American Revolutionary War.  He was, no doubt, the inspiration for the fictional Colonel Tavington in Mel Gibson's ""The Patriot"".  Like Tavington, Tarleton commanded the British light cavalry at the Battle of Cowpens--but unlike his doppelganger, Tarleton survived the battle (only because Mel Gibson wasn't present to dispatch him) and after the war was elected to Parliament from Liverpool.
The movie not only chronicles the fight against slavery, but also gives the viewer a feel for the political environment in Britain from 1780 to roughly 1806--the disharmony following the American Revolution, the hysteria over the French Revolution, etc.",1298073600,3,1655,5.43359375

1574813,4,B00005JPOE,"'Amazing Grace' is the story of William Wilberforce and his fight to abolish slavery in Britain. The first part of the film is told via flashback and then after shows how he finally managed to pass his abolition act. Ioan Gruffudd acts the role of Wilberforce supremely and very soon into the film you are completely gripped and are following the story intently. The excellent costumes and scenery really add to the overall feel of the film and help immerse you in the period. The politics of the time are explored reasonably well and the details of the act and Wilberforce's struggle are recounted in enough depth, but without becoming too dry. At just under two hours, this film manages to keep you interested for the whole duration and yet makes you feel you have a good understanding of the issues. This is well worth a viewing, it's not your fast paced action film (nor does it try to be), but a slow, steady builder and all the better for it.

Newton was a slave trader who experienced a ""great deliverance"" during a storm at sea.

The story - whether it's historically correct or has been subjected to artistic license - is still inspirational as Britain's William Wilberforce stood as the leader of the abolitionist movement and against all odds of success at a time when slavery was the lifeblood of the economy.  My only mild criticism is that the movie dragged a little through some parts and could probably have been shortened just a tad.  Nevertheless, it's a good one.",1260576000,,671,4.808695652173913
1575114,5,B00005JPOE,"I would place this film amongst the most powerful I have ever seen in a long life of cinema going. The script was brilliantly tight and barely a word was wasted. The sets were very authentic and cost I heard a reported 30 million. Beyond the walls of Wilberforce's home the world of London was presented in a dark and brooding manner which reinforced the sense of the legitimised evil that Wilberforce and his associates were fighting.
The mainly ensemble British acting was of the highest order. Outstanding performances amongst others were given by Ioan Gruffudd who superbly conveyed the complexities of Wilberforce's character, Michael Gambon,Rufus Sewell,Benjamin Cumberbatch, and Romola Garai with a superb cameo of the reformed and redeemed slaver, John Newton, by Albert Finney. Balance was given by recognition of the important role of Oloudaqh Equiano played by Youssou N'Dorr. However, some historical license was taken in order to create dramatic effect. This included the Duke of Clarence sitting in the House of Commons and James Fox,one of the greatest orators and reformers of the day, giving the final paean of praise to Wilberforce when in history he had already died.
Never mix politics and religion we are told, yet the film does it successfully by embellishing the issue with a real wit and humour. The power of the film lies to a great extent in its understatement which makes it very British and it will be interesting to see how well it does in the States. The deliberately diverted visit of MP's and their consorts to the moored slave ship was a metaphor of this. The power of the misery was conveyed without it being completely thrust in the face. The final tribute to Wilberforce was another notable example of the power of the use of a few chosen words rather than many.
The film was both moving and inspirational. In this era of the quick fix, it reminded us, as do the lives of Nelson Mandela and Desmond Tutu,of the importance of never giving up in the fight for a more just and humane world. Evil prospers when good men and women do nothing -but we need to do it again and again and again. There are more slaves in the world today than there were at the time of abolition and I trust this film will inspire another generation to continue the struggle. For those who want a more politically correct revisionist view of history and who cry paternalism, it needs to be emphasised that Wilberforce and his supporters took on the might of the political and economic establishment of the day and won. Yes he was a compassionate man but he was also a great champion of justice and justice above all requires that we see those who we are trying to help as equals. This is an outstanding piece of film making that does justice to the achievement of Wilberforce and his associates",1259193600,4,2802,4.720408163265306
1575115,4,B00005JPOE,"Amazing Grace chronicled the story of William Wilberforce, a key figure behind the British Abolition movement of the late 18th and early 19th centuries. The film had an unfortunate tendency to hop around from ""the past"" to ""the present"" (which was also the past--dates would have been helpful). But basically, it was a tale well told--nicely filmed, well acted, and with a stirring soundtrack.

Like John Newton (the man who wrote the hymn, ""Amazing Grace""), Wilberforce was primarily motivated by a conversion to Evangelical Christianity. Although little is made of his conversion in the film, this epiphany continued to inspire him throughout his life and provided the basis for many of the social reforms he championed.

While Amazing Grace was true to the spirit of the times, there were some significant inaccuracies. Departures from real history are expected in films, and I wouldn't normally point them out. However, in this case, the discrepancies tended to detract from the film rather than enhance it. First, John Newton, Wilberforce's friend and religious model, was an Anglican priest, not a rag-clothed penitent. It was not until late in his life that Newton repented of his earlier slave-trading days, and by then he had a congregation. Depicting Newton as someone who scrubbed floors in a burlap sack lent a distinctly melodramatic, off-key note to the story.

The second major discrepancy is that Wilberforce was in his seventies when the act to abolish slavery throughout the British Empire was finally passed. (He died a mere three days later.) In the movie he was shown as middle-aged, which, while better for the love story, really didn't capture the dedication of a man who literally spent his entire adult life devoted to the abolitionist cause.

Although I wouldn't necessarily recommend it for a high school class (students need to get their facts straight), Amazing Grace was a good, solid introduction to the history of the abolitionist movement. One can only imagine the course American history would have taken if the Revolution had occurred after the passage of the anti-slavery acts, rather than before.",1257897600,2,2133,5.15606936416185

1575219,5,B00005JPOE,"This movie has a lot of heart. William Wilberforce almost single-handedly stood up against a noxious totally-ingrained-social institution and changed the world. This accomplishment was executed quite well in the movie. True, 'Amazing Grace,' does chronicle the end of slavery in Britain (and years before the Americans saw the light, at that), but it does so much more. By the way, Ioan Gruffudd performed beautifully.
Is this film relevant today. Oh yes, indeedy do. Would anyone care to name certain noxious-totally ingrained-social-institutions that have us under their thumb today?
Other than consumerism (shoddy products and service as well), oil dependency, corporate malfeasance, and press having been sold out to sensationalists instead of reporting the facts. Gee, I can't think of a thing.
If you would be a voice for change, for making the world a better place, you could do far worse than taking a page from Wilberforce's book. As to the title of this critique, Margaret Mead's full comment was ""Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful committed citizens can change the world; indeed, it's the only thing that ever does.""

1575224,5,B00005JPOE,"This is the story of one man on a mission to end the English slave trade.

William Wilberforce (Ioan Gruffudd) was an English member of parliament in the late 18th and early 19th century.  He had a Christian experience and was led to eliminate the abomination of slavery.  Although he was a person of extraordinary wealth and privilege, Wilberforce was driven to do the right thing.

This movie is a testament to the power that a single person who is focused can have.  In addtion to the protagonist, there are outstanding performances by John Newton (Albert Finney), Barbara Spooner (Romola Garai) and William Pitt (Benedict Cumberpatch).

It took far too long for me to get around to seeing this one.  It is one that I would not mind seeing again and I can heartily endorse it for anyone who loves an inspirational story.  It is also a good history lesson and just plain great entertainment.",1249862400,,893,4.716129032258064
1575225,1,B00005JPOE,"""Amazing Grace"" is not the story about the classic hymn as the ads and title lead you to believe, it instead attempts to tell the story of English abolitionist William Wilberforce. Wilberforce's struggle to dismantle the horrific slave trade in Britain is a story worthy of a film, but unfortunately ""Amazing Grace"" plays more like a crawling, unfocused costume drama that comes across more as a bad TV movie than a serious motion picture. It also unsuccessfully juggles multiple story arcs, creating a fractured narrative that makes the film lose any real power or punch. There are good scenes in this movie, and some decent production values, but it never fully engages the viewer. The film also makes the mistake of forgetting a crucial element of the story: The slaves.

The movie begins with a fascinating scene where Wilberforce shows his compassion for all of God's creatures by stopping a man on a side of the road who whips a black horse, the narrative then jumps to some of Wilberforce's colleagues trying to make a love connection between Wilberforce and a pretty English girl who has followed his abolotinist work for years. It is here where the jumping back and fourth begins as the film decides not to keep a focused narrative and instead employ a flashback technique where the resolutions of certain story arcs are revealed before they even begin. We meet some interesting characters, including a former slave ship captain who wrote the hymn ""Amazing Grace"" and is haunted by the memories of his former trade. He gets the best dialogue in the movie, and you wonder, indeed, why the movie isn't about him.

Director Michael Apted, best known for the 007 film ""The World Is Not Enough,"" surprisingly exchanges power and impact for cheesy romance and cornball scenes between friends. Like the films ""Luther"" and ""Alexander,"" Apted here shows a lot but tells too little. There are some good, intense scenes where the British MPs debate the issue of slavery and the economic importance it held at the time, but the very issue of slavery itself feels pushed back in a film which decides to be timid and safe about the subject. Wilberforce tours a slave ship, and we see a few chains on the roof, but we never meet the slaves, we never actually see their plight as in Steven Spielberg's ""Amistad."" There is only one major black character in the film, and he's only given a few lines in two scenes and then we simply discover he died after publishing his memoirs. After that, the African slaves Wilmberforce is fighting for have no identity, they are, as with the former captain, ghosts.

The character of Wilmberforce is also never treated like a flesh and blood person, a brilliant man pushing against the status quo. Oh there are classic moments of fist clenching and shouting, but Wilmberforce is reduced to a cardboard character, a cartoon who only says what we expect him to say. Even his faith, a major theme in a film obviously meant to cater to Christian audiences (Chris Tomlin even sings the title song), is never explored or even convincingly portrayed. How Wilmberforce really find God? We never know, it's all summed up in one corny scene where he sits in a field looking at the sky and observes the beauty of a spider-web, after that the rest of the movie reduced the importance of Wilmberforce's faith to just a few, typical lines like ""we are all equal in the eyes of God."" Can't disagree with the notion, but we're never convinced of the passion or fever of this man's beliefs. Instead of exploring where Wilmberforce's faith comes from, the script feels as if it just had to randomly throw in the word ""God"" in every few lines just to remind viewers this is a religious-friendly movie. But those seriously interested in Christian ideas in the fight against slavery will find nothing deep or profound. Valuable space is given to a very unconvincing love story between Wilmberforce and the woman he eventually marries. Their dialogue is suitable for a bad soap opera and we never feel as if these are actually two connected people bound together by anything. Even the films villains have little to no identity, they are simply qeued for every Parliament scene and then disappear in the background.

We shouldn't expect movies to be historical guides, those who really want to inform themselves should go to the local public library instead, but the best historical films also take history seriously and with at least some detail. ""Amazing Grace"" simply skips around themes and events without showing their impact or importance. The American Revolution is mentioned and glorified (of course), but it never goes beyond that. Did Wilmberforce have any opinions on America's own slave culture? The Haitian Revolution is at least mentioned in one quick line, but you never know what Wilmberforce thought about it. Thomas Jefferson himself was terrified of the Haitian Revolution because it symbolized the ability of the slaves to rebel and even take power, Jefferson is only mentioned in passing in the film as suspected of corresponding with Wilmberforce eventhough they had completely different ideas of freedom for the slaves. The ending of the film is also a little tricky, I understand Apted has to give the audience what they want, a heroic, triumphant ending for the hero, but the way slavery is abolished is explained in a rapid, muddled narrative. Of course the screenwriters had to find a way around the fact that Britain abolished slavery more for the purpose of hitting the French and American economies hard, not because Wilmberforce convinced the government of his moral battle.

In the end ""Amazing Grace"" is a bad exercise in anglophile cinema, this is the kind of movie directors like Spike Lee and actors like Danny Globver must feel frustrated about. Glover himself has been trying to launch a film on the Haitian Revolution for years, but whenever he pitches the script around Hollywood, the answer according to him, is always the same: ""Where are the white characters?"" That is not to say ""Amazing Grace"" is some sort of racist film, it has too much of a good heart for that, but in trying to reduce Wilmberforce's struggle to a soapy message movie, the film loses sight of its subject and even its spiritual content. Even the title is not done justice, because the real story of ""Amazing Grace"" is surely a film worth making. This one has costumes, but no soul.",1249776000,25,6402,4.842922374429223

While lovely to watch, what was noteable about the film was that Albert Finney stole it.  His John Newton was brilliant, as was Romola Garai's Barbara Spooner.

1575314,4,B00005JPOE,"I will share that part of my disappointment may have been that the film toted itself as ""How the song Amazing Grace came to be"". Not really what the film was about. While the song was penned and tuned during this time, the film is actually about William Wilberforce and his decades long struggle to abolish the British slave trade. The song is mentioned and it's author is a pivotal figure in the film, but it's not the main focus. I thought this film took an interesting look as Wilberforce's life and the relationships formed that inspired and supported Wilberforce during his quest. The movie jumps quite a bit between two periods with a sort-of ""flashback"" mentality. I found it a bit difficult to keep up with the concepts and am not sure it was a useful tool within this story. I learned more of the ""players"" during this period of abolition and am looking forward to researching their stories. The acting is fabulous.

*For parents: I believe you could watch this with children even as young as elementary age. However, the jumping back & forth between time periods may be confusing for younger viewers.

Ioan Gruffudd is outstanding as William Wilberforce, the man that leads the figtht against slavery in Britain's Parliament.  The rest of the cast is equally magnificent.  Watch as Wilberforce spends his time, efforts, energy, health, and reputation fighting the deplorable, yet government sanctioned slave trade.

Every time I watch this movie I think to myself, ""Why has it been so long since I last watched this!?""

What should you know about this movie if you are considering it?
1) It has a fantastic set of actors and actresses in the cast.
2) This is a period drama, based on historic events mainly in the late 1700s in Great Britain
3) The costumes, sets, etc., are incredible.
4) The main focus of the movie is the British slave trade, and the battle in Parliament to make that practice illegal.
5) Though this film carries only a PG rating, the focus of the fllm - slavery - contains dailog and some images that are not appropriate for younger children.
6) This is top-notch drama, and the fact that it's based on historical events makes it all the more compelling!

In my opinion, this 5-star movie belongs in the collection of any thinking viewer.

1575317,5,B00005JPOE,"This is the true story of one Englishman's crusade -- and ultimate victory-- against slavery in England.  From what I have read on the subject, the film stays close to fact. Although this is a serious film, it is not overly heavy, and is not preachy. The seriousness of the matter is balanced with humor and wit about the human condition. There's matchmaking, schemes to outfox politicians, etc.
One of my favorite scenes is when one self-important politician finally gives in and grudgingly comes to an abolitionist meeting.  The first thing out of his mouth is --- Well, do any of you, ""saints"", drink?  Promply a bottle of whisky is produced!

Also in the film, our hero - Ioan Gruffudd-  can actually sing as well as act  Some may recognize him from his lead role in the PBS series ""Horatio Hornblower"".

1575437,5,B00005JPOE,"Amazing Grace is the story of William Wilberforce, a Member of Parliament chiefly responsible for the abolition of slavery in the British Empire in the latter part of the 18th century and beginning of the 19th. Focusing on the political struggle as opposed to the individual stories of slaves themselves, the film's creators have crafted a moving and highly entertaining story of a now mostly forgotten period in world history.

We begin with an introduction to the 'ordinary world' of Wilberforce. Right away he's depicted as someone who is compassionate toward animals after he alights from his coach and prevents two men from beating a horse (it's one of Blake Snyder's 'Save the Cat' moments: according to screen writing guru Snyder, a good screenplay always has a moment early on where the protagonist does a good deed, creating audience sympathy). After Wilberforce arrives at his cousin's estate, he dreams of smashing glasses during a banquet held by high society people, foreshadowing his struggle with pro-slavery forces throughout the movie. We're also introduced to Barbara Spooner, the woman he eventually marries. No sparks fly between them during their first meeting and Wilberforce appears disinterested with the prospect of hooking up with her. Wilberforce is depicted as a complex character from the outset. But his moral compass is always firm (as he looks in the mirror, images of slaves in chains appear--these flashbacks to the actual scenes of slavery are never overdone).

Before we break into Act 2 of the story, there's always some kind of 'inciting incident' or catalyst which gets the action moving. In Amazing Grace, the flashback to 15 years earlier, marking Wilberforce's early career as a politician, is the actual inciting incident. We see the extremely articulate and witty Wilberforce as a young man in Parliament, debating with conservatives over the course of the war with America. There's a great scene where the Duke of Clarence (brilliantly played by Toby Jones) shocks our modern day sensibilities with his request to ""fetch my n-gger""--his black servant is brought in and offered by the Duke as a wager during a card game with Wilberforce. While Wilberforce does walk out in disgust, he doesn't hold a grudge against his fellow MP's (Members of Parliament). He realizes he needs to work with these people and movingly sings 'Amazing Grace' to show them just where his sentiments lie. Wilberforce's internal conflict is dramatized as he communes with nature on his country estate. He's conflicted about whether he should pursue a solitary spiritual life as opposed to continuing his career in politics. His servant who quotes Francis Bacon, points out that serving God and pursuing political ends in the cause of justice are not incompatible. Wilberforce's eccentric personality is also depicted: his mansion is overflowing with animals and beggars who he can't say no to--bent on obtaining a free lunch.

We break into Act 2 when the a group of abolitionists visit Wilberforce. The key moment is when Henry Clarkson, one of the more radical abolitionists, displays the actual chains at the dinner table used by slave traders and when former slave Olaudah Equiano opens his shirt to reveal how he was branded during the time of his captivity. The first half of Act 2 of Amazing Grace involves the initial successes of the abolitionists. We skip forward to the 'present time' and a series of events unfold including Wilberforce's developing relationship with Barbara Spooner, introduction of the principal antagonist, Lord Tarleton, the defection of Charles Fox, the pro-slavery MP who joins the small group of anti-slavery MPs, and Wilberforce dramatically forcing upper crust Londoners (partying on a boat) to take in the ""smell of death' from a slave ship docked in the Harbor. The midpoint of the story is usually a 'false victory' for the protagonist and his allies. In Amazing Grace, the abolitionists' publicity campaign is working. Fifty thousand copies of Equiano's book have been sold in two months and Wilberforce remarks (in a voice-over), ""our message was everywhere.""

The second half of Act 2 usually leads to a temporary defeat for the protagonist. Despite collecting 390,000 signatures on a petition and presenting it to Parliament, the war with France has turned public opinion against the abolitionists. Slavery is seen as necessary to the economy and the public now believes its abolition will undermine the war effort. Prime Minister Pitt can no longer support Wilberforce given the changed political realities. The end of Act 2 usually features a 'dark moment of the soul' for the protagonist. Members of the public walk out on an anti-slavery deacon's sermon and Wilberforce has another attack of his 'colitis', symbolizing the effect of the pro-slavery forces' counterattack.

At the beginning of Act 3, the protagonist must regroup and once again attempt to battle his opponents. Wilberforce's wedding to Barbara Spooner serves as a brief respite before he goes into battle once again. This time, the abolitionists are aided by James Stevens, a lawyer who devises a plan to seize French ships sailing under neutral American flags. Since 80% of slave ships are under the American flag, removing the protection of the neutral flags, will effectively end the slave trade. The climax occurs when Wilberforce and his allies give free racetrack tickets to MPs who aren't there for the crucial vote regarding the French ships.

Wilberforce now returns to his 'ordinary world' which has been transformed. His life has been renewed--he's now able to cope with his crippling colitis and his wife has given him six children. Finally, he lives to see an 283 to 16 vote in Parliament abolishing slavery throughout the British empire. Amazing Grace is not only a great history lesson. The casting and performances are superb and the story is inspirational. This is a film that should be viewed multiple times.",1236988800,,5960,5.151859504132231
1575438,5,B00005JPOE,"I loved this inspirational story of the abolition of the slave trade in the British Empire.

Great acting, great story line and a wonderful message of perseverance and the equality of all human kind.  A must see for everyone!  The descriptions may be grusome for the youngest of children (8 and under), but then they might be too young to understand those parts anyways.

I love hearing the stories of the ordinary (or not so ordinary) people who changed history that are often neglected in history books.  This movie is also pretty historically accurate.  It would even be a great study for middle school or high school social studies classes.

1575561,3,B00005JPOE,"William Wilberforce was a member of Parliament who earned his place in history by becoming one of the great English abolitionists of the late 1700s.  Inspired by his deep-abiding love for God and his commitment to Christian principles, he was instrumental in bringing an end to slavery in his nation.

Written by Steven Knight and directed by Michael Apted, ""Amazing Grace"" plays like one of those historical costume dramas of yore - serious in tone, stolid in execution, inspirational in theme and handsome in appearance.  The movie provides an interesting history lesson, even if it doesn't always make for the most gripping or compelling of dramas - especially since its characters, Wilberforce included, often emerge as more two-dimensional than three-dimensional in nature.  Still, it's a great movie to look at, and the stodginess itself becomes almost reassuring in its old-fashioned comfiness.

1575565,5,B00005JPOE,"Is this film totally historically accurate? Probably not, but it's intriguing enough to get you to dig into the history yourself. Is it a little hard to keep track of? Yes, the film does jump back and forth in time: but you're given the baseline date at the beginning of the film and with a little knowledge of the history of the times you can keep track of when things are happening. Heaven knows the script gives you enough clues. A rare film. You do have to pay attention. Thank heavens for pause buttons on the remote, though.

There is only one thing I would change. Wilberforce was a devout Evangelical. He was moved to his actions by a deep personal faith. I suspect that rather than saying that ""all men are created equal"" as he does in the script that he might have said that ""all men are created in the image of God."" If that is true, then it is the best reason of all for the abolition of slavery then......and now.

And the film is worth watching for one other piece of history. William Pitt the younger still holds the record as the youngest Prime Minister in the history of England.

1575568,5,B00005JPOE,"As it is regrettably too often the case ... corporate greed prevails over human rights, animal rights or the preservation of the environment. Amazing Grace evidences that fact clearly.

We witness the decade struggle of a decent man fighting incessantly at the cost of his health and sanity for the abolition of slavery in the United Kingdom. But in so doing he must face in parliament, wealthy men solely motivated by greed ... sugar cane plantation owners in the Caribbean Islands, who hold their fortune on the back, sweat, misery and death of African slaves.

Intertwined and deeply woven into the fabric of this story, is the tale of a slave trafficking ship captain who upon the peril of his life during a storm, asked God to spare his miserable life.

He promised to change his ways and to become an advocate in favor of ending slavery. His sincere change of heart inspired him to write the lyrics of what would become the most beautiful gospel song ever ... Amazing Grace.

For millions around the globe and for centuries to come, this hymn will forever remain us of the tragic story behind these words and that man can listen to his conscience and replace his insatiable greed or hatred ... by compassion, tolerance, respect and love for his fellow man.",1231891200,,1262,4.722727272727273
1575569,4,B00005JPOE,"I was moved and inspired by this story of an ordinary man who felt a call to end slavery, and achieved his goal by simply not giving up. The inner struggles of William Wilberforce are clearly portrayed by an understated and often humorous performance by Ioan Gruffoad, as well as the difficulties of gaining success in this (at the time) most unpopular mission. The rest of the cast are as superb as we ""over the pond"" have come to expect from British period dramas, and Albert Finney is absolutely brilliant as John Newton, repentant former slave trader and author of the hymn ""Amazing Grace"", who acts as mentor to the often discouraged Wilberforce.

But the film itself is a beautiful work of art, with exceptional sets, costumes and uniquely stylized editing, which might be confusing to the lazy viewer, but pulls together beautifully for the stirring and heart-lifting climax.

Some have criticized this film for not showing more of the plight of the slaves or their point of view, but it seems to me they miss the point. Wilberforce was in a battle for the hearts and minds of a population who for the most part had no concept of slavery- except to enjoy its financial rewards- or empathy with the enslaved. The filmmakers take for granted their audience has a different perspective, and endeavors to make them realize the complete ignorance and apathy, as well as avarice, against which the hero struggles. The scene in which Wilberforce leads a ""pleasure cruise"" of wealthy and influential people past the docks of slave ships, is particularly telling.

I hardly buy videos lately because I tend to lose them after awhile. However, I decided to buy this one after watching it from a rental.  This film needs to be watched over and over again to inspire myself, my wife, my children, even my friends to put faith in action in our time.

Others have written great reviews about how well this movie was made; so I won't repeat.

I just want to highlight the life changing message of a real life story of William Wilberforce and his mentor John Newton.  It is a story of someone who took on something impossible and without personal reward. A true story like this is more powerful than fictional stories, like the Batman movies, no matter how powerfully they are made.

This movie should not be watched just for entertainment, but an inspiration to take on the evil forces of our time.  Slavery still exists in many parts of the world.  Check out [...]

Pitt, Wilberforce's friend who decided to run for Prime Minister, said it well, ""We are too young to realize that certain things are impossible so we will do them anyway.""  If you are an old man (or woman) with wisdom and life experience, be like Newton in inspiring young people around you to change the world.  If you are a young man (or woman), find a mentor to guide you to accomplish something for humanity that he (or she) didn't have the chance to accomplish.

Like Wilberforce who tried to chose either faith or work, God or social action, too many Christians today compartmentalize their lives between the two.  We should not!  I hope this movie encourages people to fulfill God's purpose for their lives.",1225497600,,1859,4.554216867469879
1575772,5,B00005JPOE,"Great movie with moving content.  The music throughout the movie was stirring and emotional.  William is portrayed as having a deep passion for ending slavery at any cost.  It consumes his being.  It is a drive he cannot ignore and he dedicates his life to it, ultimately sacrificing his own will for his life to fulfill God's purpose. This is a great movie for older kids to see. Although not young children, due to the themeatic elements and a few visual scenes that may be disturbing.  Also, the content is too mature for young kids to understand or follow what is going on.

What a wonderful telling of not only the man who took on the British Parliament to abolish the slave trade, but William Wilberforce was the founder of what we today know as the SPCA.  Wilberforce had so much compassion for both humans and animals and led a hard won crusade in their interest.  I found the moving disturbing at times and definitely needed a tissue by the end.  I think everyone should see this movie.  It matters not that it's a bit of English history.

It's about a giant of a man, a Christian dedicated to abolishing the English slave trade, and it paints a beautiful and moving portrait of this man, William Wilberforce, played marvelously by Ioan Gruffudd.  Rufus Sewell is also outstanding as his friend, Clarkson, and Albert Finney is unforgettable as the former slave ship captain who wrote the hymn ""Amazing Grace.""  This is the sort of film that can be shown to high schools and college classes, to families, to church groups, to any and all who want to know the story of all that Wilberforce endured politically and personally for his beliefs.  It is exquisitely directed by Michael Apted and every performance is terrific, not just the few I've named.  The portrait of William Pitt in this film, England's youngest prime minister, is deeply affecting, and the film takes on even greater power when we realize that slavery in many forms still exists today.  This is a film that makes us ask ""Are we doing enough?"" on every level? Are we doing enough to bring out the best in ourselves and in others, and for the greater good?  Highly recommended.",1224979200,,1139,4.780612244897959
1575775,5,B00005JPOE,A great period piece. Not preachy but could have been. Acting was great. Historical content accurate. Do not pass on the chance to see this.,1224633600,,140,4.64
1575776,5,B00005JPOE,"Why sit down to see a mindless, massively historically altered, action film like 300 when one can see something that is not only for the large part historical accurate but moving as well. That is exactly what Amazing Grace is. Amazing Grace is a moving, inspirational, true story of what one man and a righteous cause can accomplish. Add on to the story itself some terrific acting and excellent production values and you get one of the best films of 2007.

Ioan Gruffudd gives an outstanding (for which he should have been Oscar worthy) performance as William Wilberforce. He is intense in the scenes where he is passionate and he is just as believable in the scenes where he is disgruntled. Not to mention him and Romola Garai share chemistry as a romantic couple and that he also is highly believable as the best friend of the Prime Minister. This is Grufford's best work to date and I hope to see more work of this caliber in the future.

The supporting cast is top-notch as well. Benedict Cumberbatch is excellent as Prime Minister Pitt and, as I wrote above, he shares a lot of chemistry with Gruffudd. The same is true of Romola Garai who plays the wife of Wilberforce. She is convincing as a figure whose passionate views could make Wilberforce fall in love and continue a struggle he has lost faith in. Albert Finney makes a few dabbles into the film as the man behind the song, John Newton. He is excellent as the guilt ridden slave ship captain turned preacher. Michael Gambon is also excellent as one of Wilberforce's biggest supporters in Parliament. Roundign out this amazing cast is the villains: Ciarn Hinds and the ever excellent Toby Jones.

The film's script is near perfect. The story is a true one which proves that fact is, as always, better then fiction. The story never delves too deeply into sentimentally but keeps the story's emotional power in firm check. The scenes of debate are tense and even at times frustrating. The only fault of the writing is the lack of a point of view from the slaves themselves. We are given only a few brief glimpses into their world and the basis of the film is given to us only in those glimpses and some of the dialog. Yet the writing supplements the acting and by the end of the film the viewer(at least the audience I saw this film with in theatres when it came out)cheering and applauding the final vote in Parliament.

The production values of the film are high and impressive. The film manages to take you in and bring back to a distant and gone time and place. The world as it was then comes alive in a way that few other films manage to do. This is evident throughout the sets and costumes. Also there is the score by David Arnold who creates a score that captures all the emotional power of the story and is the composers best work to date.

It is a shame that other, lesser films hovershadowed this film in both box office dollars and in the minds of audiences while it was in theatres. This a film that leaves you believing that with the right cause and a passionate person to back it and nurture it, anything is possible. It is a story that should not, and hopefully never will, be forgotten.",1224288000,,3163,4.503484320557491
1575777,4,B00005JPOE,"This movie hits home. Should Christians be involved in political issues? Yes! ""Against slavery? Don't own any. Slavery is the Briton's right to choose. Keep your moral views to yourself...or you're violating the separation of church and state.""---were someone to say that, one could well imagine Wilberforce's reaction!

Although this movie can be boring and hard to follow at times, it does capture the dilemma faced by Wilberforce: Should he just stick to personal piety, or get involved in the battle against current injustices?

He shows compassion even on a fallen horse getting beaten. The movie describes how the slaves were shackled in chains and transported across the ocean under horrible conditions. Those who survived the crossing were tattooed to show that they now belonged to a man, not God.

The battle to end slavery wasn't a simple one. It would take many tries. And it had to be done in a manner that would not cause a collapse of the British economy.",1223769600,4,970,4.938650306748467

1575879,5,B00005JPOE,"The true story about an unlikely hero with a non-heroic name, William Wilberforce.  The title of the movie comes from his association with and inspiration from the author of the greatest hymn and greatest work of Christian music ever written, ""Amazing Grace"".  The unlikely songwriter was reformed and repentant Christian ex-slave trader, John Newton, who, like Wilberforce, was a prime example of the liberal abolitionist Christians of the 18th and 19th centuries.  These great men provide a stark contrast between the conservative pseudo-Christians of today, who march in near total lockstep with the conservative business and political agenda, with the real Christian progressives (i.e., liberals) of yesteryear and today.  As accurately portrayed in the movie, the Christian liberal abolitionists squared-off in a David vs. Goliath mismatch against the united conservative business and political juggernaut of their time, in this case united behind the fortunes being made in the slave trade.  Instead of a civil war ending slavery, the British experienced the ending of this abomination due almost 100% to the determined efforts of the Christian abolitionists portrayed in the movie.
The movie does a great job of capturing and portraying the dogged determination, principled perseverance, and ultimate victory of as unlikely a group of successful and inspirational protagonists as could be imagined.  Also shown are their moments of defeat and despair that make their story the substance of real life, as well as the monumental forces resistant to changing the financially rewarding status quo they faced.",1220745600,,1611,5.528455284552845

Thankfully, I tried to watch the movie before I gave it away. My impression was that both the screen writers, director, and editor must have been using heroin when they executed this project.

It is impossible to follow the story the movie attempts to present. There are no establishing shots, characters are not introduced, and the scenes are edited together randomly, without following any chronological sequence or using any of the typical cues - dissolves, titles that state the time period, etc. - that might help the viewer understand the order in which events take place.

Ioan Gruffudd has become one of my favorite actors, between this and his portrayal as Reed Richards in the Fantastic Four.  Both my wife and I were very impressed with Benedict Cumberbatch as the prime minister, and Michael Gabon was great as MP Fox.

You know William Wilberforce is a rebel right away because he's the only one who doesn't wear a wig in Parliament.  He also scores 100 percent on the debate rejoinders that leave his opponents speechless and his supporters in stitches.  He suffers from colitis, but refuses to take laudanum.  He is, in short, a living saint, and about as interesting.  It doesn't help the movie that it is filmed in such constant near darkness, even in the interior or outdoors in daylight scenes, that it is sometimes difficult to recognize characters.

Although the time line may jump a little it still gives a good picture of his adult life and his battles in and out of court including those with his health. We see all those that impacted his life.

Would highly recommend this movie for high school, college students and adults because the movie's ""tour of a slave ship"" help show the human side of the fight to end slavery.",1210204800,,349,4.88135593220339
1576093,3,B00005JPOE,"This movie romantically dramatizes the Parliamentary efforts of bleeding-heart nabob William Wilberforce to abolish slavery in the British Empire. It is well made liberal hagiography with good production value and some well known actors, but the Manichean simplicity of such agitprop is becoming very tiresome to me as I get older. The slave holders are all evil and the abolitionists are all saints (that's literally what they were known as, which demonstrates the lunatic boundlessness of liberal arrogance). We are even shown Wilberforce taking on the role of ""alter Christus"" as he undergoes another Passion through his physical ailments and the stress of his abolitionist crusade. There's just no gray areas in this movie, no deeper questions about an issue that still haunts us to this day.

Even if one holds slavery to be a human rights injustice, it's pretty hard for someone to turn that into a sinful offense against the Christian God, as the abolitionists claimed, considering that the Lord Jesus Himself never saw fit to address the issue while He was on earth and His own Scriptures condone the institution in the clearest terms, even going so far as to enjoin slaves to obey their masters. Why then do we still accept the demonization of slave owners that abolitionists engaged in? In the 1750 years or so between the ministry of Christ and the birth of the abolitionist movement, should we not ask why so minuscule a number of Christians, who read the same Bible and worshipped the same God as Wilberforce and his ""saints"", came to the same conclusions about slavery as they did? Slavery, after all, was an ancient and venerable tradition in every part of the world, especially Africa, whose role in the Atlantic slave trade goes unacknowledged in this movie. Without the help of the Africans themselves, there would have been no slave trade for Wilberforce to rail against. Instead, this film leads the ignorant to heed the fictional tale of an African ""prince"" who was captured by marauding White men. It's a horrible thought, but is it perhaps nature's law that the strong and advanced will ever rule the weak and primitive, that a part of humanity is born with saddles on their back, ready to be ridden by those born booted and spurred? Will slavery be seen again in history, once the relatively brief and artificial interlude of Anglo-American liberalism is overcome by the inexorable forces of nature and its own degenerative qualities? What does it portend when recent news reports quote several Africans, disgusted by the universal failure of their liberated continent, as openly expressing a desire for the return of European colonialism?

While Wilberforce had a legitimately charitable heart and may not have been as bad as many of his compatriots, who bewailed the fate of the African slaves, while scorning the cries of five-year-old White children who went to their early graves working 16 hours a day in mines and factories, his sympathies often did not extend to his own people's horrific conditions. He opposed the right of workers to organize for better conditions and pay, and was described by one notable Englishman as someone who ""who preaches vital Christianity to untutored savages, and tolerates its worst abuses in civilised states"". Another activist told Wilberforce that ""Never have you done one single act, in favour of the labourers of this country."" Where is the movie about the White serfs of the British Empire, who often lived in worse conditions than slaves? Why are we not incessantly reminded about the White blood that fueled the Industrial Revolution?

Another uncomfortable question this movie raises is why American abolitionists had to resort to bloody civil war to free the slaves, when Great Britain achieved the same goal legally and peacefully with financial compensation for slave owners. Slavery would have withered and died within a few decades even had there not been a Civil War. Without favoring slavery, perhaps our northern abolitionists should be cursed as Jacobin fanatics who sacrificed 600,000 Americans on the altar of their revolutionary mania.

Another unexamined issue in this movie is the fate of the liberated. In order to prove the equality of Africans, Wilberforce and his people set up the free colony of Sierra Leone, which was populated by starry-eyed Whites and freed blacks, and liberally funded by wealthy friends. Wikipedia says ""The dream was of an ideal society in which races would mix on equal terms; the reality was fraught with tension, crop failures, disease, death, war and defections to the slave trade."" Today, Sierra Leone ""is the lowest ranked country on the Human Development Index and seventh lowest on the Human Poverty Index, suffering from endemic corruption, suppression of the press and the HIV/AIDS pandemic."" (also from wikipedia). The history of every single other black society on earth reflects the same attributes. This movie makes it seem like the Africans' troubles were over once some White men passed a bill in London. Wilberforce's abolition bill was indeed significant, but by no means got to the root of the problem, and in most ways it seems like African quality of life has only declined since the 19th century.

I'm not defending slavery and I do think Wilberforce accomplished a good thing with the abolition of slavery. I just think the issue isn't as cut and dried as Hollywood History for Dummies would lead us to believe.",1209254400,5,5449,5.043285238623751

The essential truth is there: People with conscience (mostly white Christians)in England put it on-the-line to stop the slave trade to England, setting the example to follow for like-minded Americans. Good acting and drama from all involved. but the romantic diversion for Wilberforce seems awkward.
There are still slaves traded today in some parts of the world! The navel-gazers in America should look somewhere else to find fault instead of dwelling in the 18-19th centuries.

The acting is superb. Ioan Gryffudd presents a convincing hero in William Wilberforce.  He is supported by an excellent cast which includes Albert Finney and Michael Gambon who play their roles as convincingly as Gryffudd does his.
The storytelling itself can be a bit misleading as the story is told in flashbacks and if one is not paying attention one can lose track of which time period is being shown.  But it is a small distraction.
Amazingly accurate in its historical detail, amazingly engaging in its story, Amazing Grace is a must have for any DVD library.",1206748800,2,696,4.840336134453781
1576185,5,B00005JPOE,"I enjoyed the movie. The title for this movie is silly. The main Character of the Movie is William Wiberforce.  William Wilberforce knew the author of the song Amazing Grace, but so what. The movie is not about Mr. Newton, the Song, or Grace. Twice in the movie is song in a relative contrived way. The song does not fit the movie or the situation in the movie. William Wilberforce's faith pays a major part of the movie. To say God's Grace is a theme of the movie would be a stretch.  It is clear the title was chosen to sell the movie.

This is an excellent depiction of a man who worked with single mindedness to change the law about the slave trade. It depicts a man struggling with his conscience, cultural forces, his faith, and political reality. The man pursues what he believes to be true, correct, and God's Will.  He tries to bring social change through argument and protest. He works with great energy to change the minds of those in power, but over the years of slow progress he becomes weary of his consuming passion to meet his goal.  His passion has progress in society, but the minds in parliament change slower.  How to frame the argument? How to gather allies who have deviating agendas, but agree in the end of the slave trade? The movie does an excellent job telling the horror of the shipment of human cargo. The movie tells how the French revolution detracts from the political process to end the trade. Less is told of the common poverty of the time. This movie depicts a Christian man, but I consider it less then accurate its depiction how church and Faith effected society as a whole in that the time period of the events shown.  The one book I read written William Wilberforce tells of a Christendom society that one's declared Faith does not reflect Godly nature in one's daily life. I believe a good portion of both his allies and his opposition positioned themselves as Christians, at least in the manner of regular church attendance and shape of argument. This is totally lacking in the movie. I know Locke by his time had great effect on public argument, but I doubt this much.  Anyway my side thoughts besides, it still is a good movie. The times are not portrayed as what was.",1205712000,2,2211,4.51
1576186,5,B00005JPOE,"I seldom bother with movies, as very few manage to be historically accurate, remain on subject, and manage to compel me to keep watching them.  This movie manages to accomplish all this, and more.  A period piece for setting and costume, it stays true to it's subjects, and manages to be relevant even today.... maybe even especially today.

Wilberforce was evidently an amusing, positive and very agile minded individual (as well as one seriously occupied with thoughts of morality), and that is how he is portrayed.  His character comes off as likeable, rather quirky, and of considerable personal force.  He is also shown as a man, capable of stumbling and falling, losing faith in himself, but not above accepting the support of friends, and especially a good and strong willed woman.

This is the story of the fight to abolish a profound evil, and slavery itself is not the centre-piece of the story:  rather the fight against it is.  Enough of the evil is presented, not casually, but with simple statements and examples of fact (and in one scene, odour).  A lot is said, with an amazing compactness of words.  Surprisingly effective.

The machinations that are on the route to ultimately succeeding in passing the legislation are quickly covered, and the (generally speaking) happy ending is attained.

The characters are consistently believable, but none are portrayed as sainted...  All are obviously human beings, with feet of clay, as are we all.  Several actors should have been in line for Academy awards (Finney for one), but given the nature of the story (good being done by good people), that didn't seem likely to happen.

Every now and then, you see or hear of someone that convinces you that, warts and all, maybe the human race has enough of value in it, to worth endless second chances.  This movie is about such people.

While viewing the movie, the audience is brought to care deply, not just about the outcome of events, but about the individual players as well.  Wilberforce's personal weaknesses are not glossed over, nor is the role of his wife in helping to add new strength to his efforts at a critical point in his career.

1576191,5,B00005JPOE,"""Amazing Grace"" cannot be fully appreciated with only one viewing!  As other reviewers have noted there is some difficulty in following the flashback format of the movie so it takes some of us at least two viewings (subtitles help) to get all the details of the plot. The beauty of the production is that it's worth the time and effort.  The focus of the film is William Wilberforce, a hero who deserves far more recognition than he receives.  It takes a tremendous amount of courage to fight a well-established, profitable evil like the slave trade year after year,facing pressure from every political faction.  Wilberforce's views were too radical for the mainstream politicians of his day but not radical enough for the extremists (does this sound familiar to anyone else?).  The script presents an honest discussion of what the pros and cons of the whole issue were in eighteenth-century England. But all of the discussion would only interest academics--what makes the movie memorable is Ioan Gruffudd's performance.  Certainly, the supporting cast gave outstanding performances as well, but Gruffudd's is the brightest of them all. After you're familiar with the story, sit back and watch his portrayal. Gruffudd's personal charm, handsomeness, and general ""likeableness"" are key to the scenes of Wilberforce's beginning career. But he takes his character in to far deeper significance as he battles his demons in mid-career. His struggle affects his family and friends, and their support gives him the impetus to ""try again.""
  The director is to be commended for presenting Wilberforce's eccentricities with low-key humor, and his dependence on laudanum with sympathy. (The medical profession of his day administered the opiate-derivative as casually as aspirin is administered in our culture--no wonder he was addicted!) Where he failed Wilberforce somewhat is in not showing us the depths of his faith.  His beliefs are acknowledged as his motivation, but our self-labeled agnostic director did not understand that Wilberforce's faith was also his greatest strength.  With that caveat entered, I thoroughly appreciated the fine efforts that brought us ""Amazing Grace."" The attention to historical detail and the on-location shoots round out the believability of the whole project. Hurrah to all involved!

1576324,5,B00005JPOE,"Actually, let's give Michael Apted's ""Amazing Grace"" 4.5 stars and let's look at the strengths of the film first.

First, when you start with a plot about the abolition of slavery in the British Empire, and intertwine, accurately, historic characters such as Fox, Pitt the Younger, Tarelton, and the Duke of Clarence, you are starting with a strong story.  Focus on the main character--MP William Wilberforce and his indefatigable efforts, and you have a winner.

Next, work with the copious records and documents to stay historically faithful.  Throw in Wilberforce's strong relationship with John Newton, a former slave ship captain turned cleric, and author of the title hymn.  How can you miss?

This film's greatest virtue besides the great historic tale is the fine acting. Ioan Gruffudd as Wilberforce is supplemented by many of the finest talents of British Cinema including Albert Finney as Newton, Rufus Sewell, Nicholas Farrell, and Toby Jones. The script crackles, allowing them all to display their talents.

If the film has a technical weak point, it is it's odd use of flashbacks, flash forwards and strange ""two years later"" time increments.  It's a little hard to follow, but not unwatchable at all.

If there is a historic weak point of the film, it has to be ""Where's Wesley?""  John Wesley, founder of the Methodist Church was mainly remembered when he died in 1803 as a premier fighter against slavery in the UK.  Living contemporaneously with Wilberforce, not even giving him a mention seems a major historic omission.

But, otherwise, great, inspirational entertainment.  Good cinematography and soundtrack round out a top film worthy of repeated watchings.",1203379200,5,1679,5.174074074074074
1576325,4,B00005JPOE,"AMAZING GRACE is a historical film about William Wilburforce, a member of the British House of Commons, that leads the fight to eliminate the slave trade in the British Empire. Wilburforce is an amazing person and this film really doesn't do his life's work justice. But it does tell a good story and is a good starting point if you want to learn more about Wilburforce and the era in which he lived. At a young age, Wilburforce has a religious conversion and became an evangalical Christian. He felt called to serve God, and others convinced him that he could serve God by pushing for change in Parliment. A group of men, including ministers and an ex-slave met with Wilburforce and convinced him to take up their cause in Parliment to abolish the slave trade in the British Empire.

Wilburforce faces an uphill battle because the economy of Britian is very dependent on the slave trade. He tries to gather evidence to support his cause while speaking to the House of Commons. He has chains, drawings of slave ships, eyewitness accounts and replicas of sleeping quarters. While all of this evidence is very persuasive to characters in the movie, I found it very uninspiring to me. I realize director Michael Apted's goal in the film was to make a movie about the legislative battles it took to abolish the slave trade (actual slavery was already illegal in England). The movie has very few black characters. I realize the horror of the slave trade could not be captured in such a brief moment in this film, but after hearing the descriptions of the way the slaves were treated and seeing a few reenactments of their treatment, I believe a few scenes depicting the horror of life on a slave ship would have been very effective and showing why Wilburforce was so motivated to abolish the slave trade.

This movie had a top notch cast, great acting, and was very intellectually stimulating. Yet it failed to capture my heart. The flashback mode of storytelling seemed confusing and unneccessary, and as mentioned earlier, I never felt the true horror and suffering of the cause Wilburforce sacrificed so much of his life for. If anything, this is a movie to watch if you're interested in slavery and William Wilburforce. There is nothing too offensive in the movie, yet children would probably be bored to tears.  This is a movie that does a great job telling the story of how the slave trade was abolished in the British Empire. If you're looking for a movie about slavery and its affect on millions of Africans, you won't find it here. This movie is really about William Wilburforce, and the amazing life that he led.",1203379200,4,2617,4.709606986899563
1576326,2,B00005JPOE,"There are certain cinematic moments so absolutely perfect that they remain in one's memory, even if the film in which they occur isn't much to write home about.  So it is with ""Amazing Grace,"" a movie that manages to take a magnificent story--Wilberforce's long struggle to end slavery in Great Britain--and transform it into a rather tedious and unconvincing script.  Albert Finney's performance as John Newton, the slavetrader turned clergyman and hymn writer, and Michael Gambon's brilliant portrayal of Charles Fox, salvage the film.  Finney has only two scenes (plus a third silent walk-on), and Gambon, although in several scenes, probably has no more than 5 total minutes of speaking time.  But their performances are breath-taking:  Finney as the conscience-tortured ex-slaver, and Gambon as the cynical but wise legislator.

Other performances in the film fall short, some of them because the script, written by Stephen Knight is so bad.  Veteran character actor Nicholas Farrell, for example, does his best in his role as Dr. Henry Thorton, but the scriptwriter doesn't give him much to go on.  Benedict Cumberbatch puts in a decent performance as William Pitt, but even he can't pull off the bathetic death scene with which the script encumbers him.

Sadly, however, the very worst performance must go to Ioan Gruffudd, who plays Wilberforce.  Gruffudd's talents in the film veer toward loud melodrama rather than subtlety (a surprise, because he's given quite admirable performances in other movies).  In his hands, Wilberforce comes across as both unsympathetic and implausible.

In short, a bad, sometimes mawkish script; lackluster performances; and miscasted leading man.  The film had the potential, given its inspiring story, to be as great as (for example) ""Chariots of Fire.""  But it fell far short of that.

1576434,5,B00005JPOE,"Why did the Academy ignore this movie for Oscar Nomination?

Ioan Gruffudd plays William Wilberforce a member of Parliament who tries with all his might to have Parliament abolish the British Slave trade.

We have seen this story before with Amistad but there is a fluidity and ethereal quality that makes this movie so watchable. The cinematography, the empassioned dialogue between characters and the realism of atrocities committed by slave owners as described by those who lived to tell of it.

Albert Finney gives a powerful performance as ex-slave-ship captain John Newton who went on to write the beautiful hymn, ""Amazing Grace"".

Ioan Gruffudd is such a talented actor and does period pieces SO well-e.g. Horatio Hornblower, Great Expectations,Poldark, etc.. He SHOULD HAVE got an Oscar Nomination for this!

SPOILER ALERT: The ending of this movie is so moving, as a regiment of bagpipes plays ""Amazing Grace"" outside Westminster Abbey-the final resting place of Mr. Wilberforce which I had the privilege of visiting.",1201305600,9,1026,5.269938650306749

1576436,4,B00005JPOE,"Many believe that the stories conceived by writers offer compelling tales that take us on journeys unimagined. There is some truth in this idea. But at the same time, there are journey's that men have taken in the past that offer themselves to compelling tales as well, offering more drama than imaginable. Such is the story of William Wilberforce.

Wilberforce (Ioan Gruffudd) was a 19th century politician whose views in Parliament were a bit unconventional for the times. As the tale beings, William has just lost his greatest political battle, an attempt to abolish the slave trade in the whole of the British kingdom. Succumbing to ill health, he has retreated to his cousin's home to recuperate. Along the way his cousin (and his wife) introduce William to a young woman who has similar viewpoints to his and who has been a staunch supporter of his beliefs. It is through their short courtship that William tells her the story of how he came to this point in his life.

As his political career was beginning, Wilberforce hit a snag in the road. He was touched with a profound belief in God and considered a life as a minister turning his back on politics altogether. His friendship with one time classmate William Pitt the Younger (Benedict Cumberbatch) leads Pitt to coerce Wilberforce to learn more about the slave trade. Meeting in secret with those who have strived to have the cruelty of slavery brought into the public eye, Wilberforce is overcome with a belief that not only is it wrong but that it must be stopped.

At one point in the story, The Duke Of Clarence (Toby Jones) offers to put up one of his slaves to offset a bet during a card game with Wilberforce. While he turns down the offer, he is encouraged by his friend to sing for fellow members of Parliament in the club where the game was taking place. The song he chooses is ""Amazing Grace"" which was written by a man Wilberforce is familiar with, an ex-sea captain named John Newton (Albert Finney) who has since retired and who wrote the song while overpowered with grief for the atrocities he had seen with the slaves.

The story continues, showing the ups and downs of politics in the 19th century and the battles that Wilberforce and his followers went through in their attempts to change a system in place for many years, an economic whirlwind that brought money into the country but at what cost. It is the drama of mans inhumanity to man and one mans attempt to change what is accepted and make it unacceptable.

Gruffudd does a wonderful job as Wilberforce, making him not only a noble person to look up to but a human one as well. The character is filled with passion for his beliefs and Gruffudd brings this out in each and every scene. The supporting cast is equally adept at bringing the story off of the pages of history and making it an inviting trip into history that many are unaware of.

The song ""Amazing Grace"" may be only a starting point for many, bringing them round to the truth behind it. But the movie ""Amazing Grace"", while touching on a depressing subject, is an uplifting tale of a man who changed history for the better. It's a movie that's worth watching with the whole family.",1200700800,10,3183,4.604938271604938

1576581,5,B00005JPOE,"After watching the film ""Amazing Grace"" the other night, I had to immediately watch it again, so impressive was the remarkable attention to historical detail and authenticity. It was easy to smell the lush English countryside, the dim old churches, and the stench of the slave ships. It plunges the viewer into late eighteenth, early nineteenth century England.

I must admit, however, that I was a bit confused by the portrayal of the Duke of Clarence, the future William IV, as an unappealing midget. Did the prince, whom I have always thought of as a very handsome man, really spend that much time lounging around the House of Commons? I thought Clarence was usually to be found with the navy, or with Mrs. Jordan and their ten children. But then I do not really know that much about him.

The story pivots around the first encounter of politician William Wilberforce with the lovely, idealistic young lady who was to become his wife. Barbara encouraged Wilberforce to persevere in his struggle to outlaw the slave trade in the British Empire, in spite of his many health problems. The wealthy merchants and their representatives in parliament stood against him. It is interesting that in autocratic France, slavery had long been abolished; a former slave, the Chevalier de Saint-Georges, held an exalted post at the court of Versailles.

Wilberforce, a devout Christian, gained popular support for the cause through education, boycotts, and skillful political maneuvering. His character, portrayed by Ioann Grufudd as an eccentric English country gentleman, in love with God, is utterly captivating. His courage and refusal to surrender his convictions, in spite of slander and ridicule, made him a prince among men, one who was totally free.",1199923200,9,1746,5.0979020979020975

Stellar performances, meticulous costuming and historical detail - the makers of this film do all those things right.  If I have any criticism, it's that it's a little slow-moving in places.  It also may be a little difficult for those unfamiliar with the historical background to make sense of the plot.  Skimming an encyclopedia article about the British abolitionist movement ahead of time could improve one's enjoyment of the film - just to become familiar with some of the names of key players.  This is in many ways an important film, precisely because this stirring story is too little-known today.

1576586,5,B00005JPOE,"While there is romance in this movie, it is not a romance, nor is it a cute costume drama.  William Wilberforce came to be known as the keeper of the Britain's conscience.  This movie shows us his struggle against slavery in the British Empire.

The title of the movie comes from John Newton's famous hymn, Amazing Grace. Newton was a slave trader early in his life but when confronted by God turned his ship around and released the slaves he held.  While Newton was a friend of Wilberforce and is a part of this movie, the focus of the movie is William Wilberfore, (Ioan Gruffudd) who, when confronted by that same God, spent years working to abolish slavery and improve the life of man and beast.

One reviewer has argued at length that Wilberforce was not a saint.  All who follow the call of God are saints, but they are also human and imperfect.  Wilberforce was both saint and sinner, but because he was not afraid to follow the call of God countless humans and animals had better lives.  In addition to his struggle against slavery Wilberforce worked to establish charity schools for children and also founded the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, which continues to this day as the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals in Britain.

A few reviewers have stated the movie should have had more Africans or dealt more with the African experience, but the movie was not about Africa or Africans, it was about the parliamentary fight of William Wilberforce to make slavery illegal in the British Empire.

Recommendation: As I mentioned in the title of this review the movie has history, drama and even a bit of romance. This is an excellent film.  I recommend it.  Five stars.

1576587,5,B00005JPOE,"As the title for this review suggests, I absolutely loved this film. In fact, I really can't find much to criticize in it. It is highly accurate historically (with a few very minor exceptions - for example, I'm told that they were a little off in how long John Newton was a slave trader), has a very engaging and inspiring true-life story about a great Christian statesman, and was very well done artistically. This isn't your low-budget B movie that many associate with the Christian film genre; unlike films like ""Left Behind,"" the production values of this film are great (in fact, it was produced by one of the major Hollywood studios and has production values comparable to other major Hollywood films). To make a long story short, it has everything you could want from a truly great, possibly even classic, movie. The acting was great, the sets were great, the writing was great, the cinematography was great, and the editing and all the other technical aspects were right on target too.

My only minor complaint was I'm not sure I agree with how they portrayed John Newton. They portray him as being plagued by guilt about his past. I'm not sure if that was a historical reality that they had to portray or a decision they made about how to portray it.

With that said, I thought this was a wonderful movie. If you didn't catch it in theaters, you'll definitely want to see it on DVD.",1199145600,7,1391,4.604838709677419

One man made a difference.  Ioan Gruffudd and a superb cast present the story of a man at times uncertain of his own ability to make a difference, but never wavering in his commitment to doing what is right.

1576675,4,B00005JPOE,"This film was well done in all details both professionally and historically, even though a two-hour film cannot be expected to satisfy true history's demands.

Some would be shocked to know that the end of the slave trade was painstakingly accomplished by a few warriors of hearty Christian faith, especially since modern social justice issues have been hijacked by secularists whose worldview cannot sustain sacrificial love for the oppressed (especially when there's no one else's tax dollars available to finance their supposed good intentions).  William Wilberforce's beliefs and character were constantly assailed for being the narrow-minded Christian who actually believed what Jesus said, and it was he who was painted out to be the immoral one for incessantly laboring to free those who had no voice.

I would recommend this film to any who would be interested in knowing more about how the abolition movement/avalanche began in the west.  When government and commerce were both on the side of exploiting a class of human being (as it is today in America with Mexican slaves), the odds seemed insurmountable unless you had a great faith in the Almighty who controls the destiny of all history (may He raise up new warriors to free the illegal Mexican slaves in America from both the pseudo-liberals and the greedy capitalists who are invested in the status quo).

1576785,4,B00005JPOE,"This is a fine film with a good cast.  Anything with Ioin Gruffudd is usually good.  He was great in the Hornblower series.  This film deals with the issue of abolition, and how it started in England long before it was ever known in the States.  Fortunately this film does not become too preachy on a topic which is normally quite moralistic in tone.  The perspective here is more on the inner-workings of politics and how Wilberforce had to work the English parliamentry system to achieve his goal.  One must give the English system credit for passing such a measure without bloodshed, something which required a bloody Civil War in this country some 60 years later!

The main interest for me in this film however is the massed band sequence at the end just before the credits.  The sight and sound of the bands is quite fascinating, even if not historically accurate. The tune ""Amazing Grace"" has long been associated with the Scottish pipes, although it is doubtful that it was played in the fashion shown here.  For one, pipers in the Scottish regiments were generally not known to play together until sometime later in the 19th century where they eventually combined with the drums to produce the sight and sound we know so well today.

The military bands shown also would not likely have combined to play in this manner at that time.  The modern assocation we have today with the bands and pipes combination must come from the Royal Scots Dragoon Guards who made their version of ""Amazing Grace"" so famous in 1972.  The legend of that recording which those two bands of the regiment produced lives on today and even gets picked up in movies like this!  Still, the sight and sound of these bands in period unifroms, and with period instrumentation is fascinating for the true student of military music like myself.

British military bands of the period rarely combined in larger ensembles than their own band, and on the rare occasions they did the results were often not promising.  We are reminded of the famous incident from the Crimean War where all the regimental bands tried playing ""God Save The Queen"" and did so in different keys and arrangements!  The resulting noise drove the Duke of Cambridge to create the Royal Military School of Music at Kneller Hall in 1857.  This venerable institution is now celebrating its 150th anniversary where it continues to turn out polished musicians for the remainig few British military bands of today.  Those wanting to catch a glimpse of the original ""Amazing Grace"" as made famous in 1972 should catch the 2008 USA Tour of the Royal Scots Dragoon Guards and the Band of the Coldstream Guards.",1198022400,3,2646,4.765350877192983

1576878,4,B00005JPOE,"The story is wonderful - the lifelong quest of William Wilberforce to abolish the slave trade. He faced numerous obstacles in his quest and suffered the strains in body, mind, and spirit, yet ultimately succeeded.

  Unfortunately, the script writers chose to scimp on events in Mr. Wilberforce's life that gave his life depth. Three examples should suffice.

  Under the orders of his physician, he used opium for years to combat ""colitis."" Opium addiction, like modern narcotic addiction, can be devastating. Yet the only effect the script writers felt important to highlight was Mr. Wilberforce's desire to give up opium in order to keep his mind clear for the coming battles over the slave trade. His mind was clouded? The movie never showed this effect. Was his life or relationships affected in any other way? The movie is silent.

  The scenes showing Mr. Wilberforce's friendship with Mr. Pitt early in their careers are wonderful. Showing them race through the gardens like young lads before Mr. Pitt rose to the post of Prime Minister was a stroke of brilliance. However, simply noting that they had become estranged, as they remarked each other at Mr. Wilberforce's wedding, did not do justice to the depth of their friendship.

  Why would Lord Tarleton have taken excpetion to Mr. Wilberforce's use of the term ""the people"" when he presented his anti-slave trade petition to parliament? The movie only hints at the reason, and it was much more complex than Lord Tarleton having fought in the Revolutionary War against the Americans and having lost two fingers. Since the movie presents Lord Tarleton as the principal person who thwarted Mr. Wilberforce's attempts to abolish the slave trade, presenting his complex character as a simple caricature diminished Mr. Wilberforce's achievement.

In summary: A wonderful story about an extraordinary man. Though the film ultimately falls short of telling his story, it is still a compelling movie.",1197849600,2,1954,5.1455696202531644

1576880,5,B00005JPOE,"Amazing Grace was a superb depiction of one man's over 30 year struggle to end the British Empire's lucrative slave trade. William Wilberforce was a young man who came to his own understanding of the immorality of the ongoing practice of enslaving other people. He was raised in a rich trade family, and had no need to work himself. He was exposed to the best of everything; the best food, the best clothes, opportunities for schooling including Oxford, continual parties and entertainment. Yet in the midst of growing up, he was exposed by a Methodist uncle and aunt to the great religious speakers (and practitioners) of that faith. Wilberforce came to the realization of the need to devote his life to something good. His friends including William Pitt Jr. encouraged him to spend his life in Parliament fighting for a cause, rather than retiring his place in Parliament to become a preacher or a religious hermit. Wilberforce had always been a kind young man who hated to see the mistreatment of animals and other human beings of all classes, so when his friends showed him the ugly side of the British Empire's wealth, that was based on the enslavement of people from Africa who were then sent to the Americas, he quickly chose to devote his life and time to ending this horrific trade.

This movie eloquently demonstrates not only the many obstacles Wilberforce had to contend with, but also the length of time it took him to achieve his goal...the passage of a bill that made the trade of shipping slaves illegal in Great Britain. Thirty years of work by Wilberforce and those who work with him took its toll on his health. This movie above all is a testament to the need to endure to the end that this great man demonstrated so well.

I had read the book on this man, and wanted to see the movie. My husband had not been interested in this though I had told him about this man and his great efforts. During the course of the movie, my husband went from paying attention to his photography work, to paying attention to the movie. Afterwards he exclaimed that this was one of the best historial dramas he had ever seen. This from a man who prefers Dirty Harry movies and war movies. The acting was impeccable as always from known British actors, many of who performed in small but great support roles. Iaon Gruffudd, who most Americans know from the commercial 'Fantastic Four' series, was outstanding as Wilberforce.

Don't think that a historical drama has to be dry and boring. This one is anything but. For one thing, Wilberforce was known to be one of the best, if not the best, political speaker of his time. His eloquence on the floor of Parliament and in his own writings, made him required reading over here in the U.S. by Franklin, Jefferson, LIncoln, and other well-known men of our own. They considered his acts, acts of supreme courage (which they were). He also had a huge sense of humor and timing, and was quick on his feet and could put down the highest ranking Lords (one of which was the King's own fat son). He and William Pitt complemented one another to great effect in Parliament, and they were practical joke players who would aid and abet in setting up those who needed to be taken down a few pegs. Yet in all this, Wilberforce did so without meaness...and this movie shows this.

I wish this movie would be shown in history classes throughout the world. Our children need to have better examples than what they currently are exposed to. A truly great movie.

Here we have a man, whom most of us had never heard of, following his ideals of making a better society despite a very long struggle and countless setbacks.  The actors, on the whole, give very good performances with small bits of comic relief being supplied by Rufus Sewell as Thomas Clarkson and the actor (whose name escapes me) who portrayed Wilberforce's butler.  Despite the heavy subject matter, the film manages to give us an historical snapshot of a situation we generally know little about, without being depressing or overly preachy.

The acting and cinematography and musical score are very well done.

Further, the special features of contemporary slavery is moving and revelatory as well as the commentary with the director and actors.

It's a great movie, just for the historical information.  However, it is also a wonderful encouragement for anyone facing what seems to be an insurmountable task.  William Wilberforce eliminated slavery in pieces --eliminated trading, reduced the number of slaves per ship, etc., while he was working to end slavery out and out.  Any task that seems too much can be done in pieces if we do not give up.  That is a word of encouragement for all of us.",1196812800,2,592,4.6
1576964,4,B00005JPOE,"This movie was a well done piece though the rhythm of the film does ebb and flow.  Iaon Gruffud made a decent effort playing William Wilberforce but was overshadowed by both Rufus Sewell and the actor who portrayed Prime Minister William Pitt and Albert Finney.  Though the charisma Gruffud displayed for Wilberforce seemed a bit uppity and off at times, the solid dignity that is portrayed in his face does more than capture the screen.  Gruffud is a decent actor but a bit too all over the place with his movements, a lot of overt theater habits still apparent on camera.  His face alone carries remarkable expression.  If only he made more use of this quality, he'd be a wonder to behold.  This is an actor with Oscar potential, he just needs to fine tune his abilities.

A good film with a bit of a slow start but a powerful ending.",1196553600,,836,4.496688741721854

William Wilberforce (a powerful Ioan Gruffudd), the movie's protagonist, progressively used a combination of faith and activism to abolish the British slave trade against the odds. Albert Finney is excellent as a former slave ship captain who repented his slave-trading past, converted to evangelical Christianity, joined forces with Wilberforce, and wrote the timeless hymn, Amazing Grace. The performances are strong all around. The historical drama sweeps along as we follow Wilberforce's passionate efforts to abolish the inhumane institution of slavery. I also found it refreshing that the movie was pretty clean, with only mild profanity and no graphic violence or sex.",1196553600,,768,5.46218487394958
1576967,5,B00005JPOE,"In this inspiring story of William Wilberforce and the movement to abolish slavery, we are once again challenged that one man motivated toward good can accomplish much.  Standing for justice in an unjust world is swimming against the tide of current cultural norms at times but the end is sure as long as one stands.  As with so many, there were unfortunate liberties taken with historical fact with this film but the overall affect was true, at least in spirit.  Mr. Wilberforce's faith rings authentic in the film and the results on his life and political views were unmistakable.  The message is loud and clear, good does indeed triumph - at times it seems slow in coming but the end is inevitable when we are firm.

The cultural norms of the Mr. Wilberforce's day seem foreign and unthinkable to us today.  One wonders what norms of today will be obvious moral and civil rights issues tomorrow.  Will history record that we were on the right side of those issues or will it find us with a majority that resists what is right?  Each must examine their own conscience.  May we, like Wilberforce, find the courage to be on the side of political right rather than political expediency.  That, I think, is the theme of this important film.",1196553600,4,1238,4.663594470046083
1577078,3,B00005JPOE,"The movie was not that entertaining to watch, and it suffers from a lack of drama, in the sense that the viewer obviously, knows how the movie will generally end.  The effect of the movie is that it does not reveal any fundamental truths about mankind, or the behavior of man-it feels like a documentary made for high school children.  I find that the best stories have a historical situation in the background and a human drama in the foreground.  This movie stumbles a bit with that balance, but the acting is quite good, and it might be worth a look.",1196553600,3,553,4.455445544554456
1577079,3,B00005JPOE,"I enjoyed the movie. The historical sets were great. The acting was very good. The dialogs had a ring of truth. The love story, although it was a minor part of the movie, was done well. The story needed to be told and the movie told it well. One of the bad points was the movie jumped around in Wilberforce's life quite a bit. Following the time shifts was confusing at times. As the movie went along, the plot was easier to follow.

I read a short biography of Wilberforce and I heard a talk on Newton. I can't claim any expertise on these men, but what little I know of them made me question the movie's historical accuracy. Newton had a congregation. He was not a hermit mopping up a church. He was a popular Anglican preacher. Finney did a great job in the part, but I don't think it represented Newton very well. Wouldn't a better charactorization have been a more historic portrayal of Newton who was a slave trader that became a slave of Christ by serving and preaching to all? Rather than a guilt-ridden old man?

I also wished the movie spent more time on Wilberforce's conversion and beliefs. Wilberforce was a thoughtful Christian who wrote books on what he believed. Wilberforce's stamina according to Wilberforce was his reformed faith. The movie just had him studying nature in a worshipful manner in his garden.

In summary, I liked the movie and I enjoyed it. The message needed to be told and it was told well. How England avoided a bloody civil war because of this issue and resolved the issues through a peaceful process was instructive. However, Wilberforce and Newton deserved to have a more accurate portrayal of their lives.",1196467200,121,1647,4.595238095238095
1577080,5,B00005JPOE,"This is the best motion picture I have seen in 2007.  It rivals Gandhi in its inspiration and ability to move the heart.  Having seen this movie, I deeply admire William Wilberforce (well-portrayed by Ioan Gruffud) as a sincere, persevering and dedicated reformer whose belief in God motivated his efforts.  But it is his friend, who was also Prime Minister at the time, William Pitt, who nurtures Wilberforce, helps set him on his path and who also never gives up on the dream of the abolition of the slave trade in the British empire.  Prime Minister Pitt (as magnificently played by Benedict Cumberbatch) is a model of leadership worthy of study.

The movie weaves together the personal and world political circumstances of the time accurately and in an understandable manner.  I was pleased to see Rufus Sewell in a non-villain role, and thought all the actors played their parts well, with particular appreciation for Michael Gambon as a savvy political insider, Albert Finney as friend and minister to Wilberforce and author of the words to the hymn ""Amazing Grace"", and Romola Garai as the woman who heals Wilberforce's spirit and enables him to resume his fight for the Cause after many years of effort and defeat.

I highly recommend this movie for World history classes covering this period of time, and for anyone with the desire to contribute to the making of a better world.",1196467200,2,1387,4.876595744680851

1577082,5,B00005JPOE,"I can't handle history in black and white dates. But give me history with faces, sights, sounds and smells and I'm hooked. Add sacrifice, heroic acts and strong convictions and you have Amazing Grace and my heart.

This movie blew my expectations out of the water. I expected good enough because so many have given it great reviews. I didn't expect to laugh. I didn't expect to care so much about the characters. I expected to struggle a little with boredom during parliamentary discussions but even those grabbed hold of me.

The Christian theme is present but not overdone. God was part of the picture-- a driving force -- since He loves all people and all people are created in His image. And on the flip side the words arse, bloody and hell are tossed about throughout the well-written dialogue.

If you are a history fan you really should at least rent it. Fans of movies like Luther, Master and Commander, Girl with a Pearl Earring etc. will probably like Amazing Grace. It's not ram-packed action and has plenty of heavy dialogue so thinkers should get much out of it.

The storyline is also inspirational in remembering that anyone can affect significant and positive changes with persistance!

I was impressed with WW's commitment to social justice, more compassion for animals, and improvements in health care and education.  Ioan Gruffudd does a nice job in the role of WW, as does Albert Finney, who plays his mentor, John Newton.  Ciaran Hinds and Toby Jones are at the top of their game as the main opposition in the House of Commons.
It would have been more effective to have more slaves featured so we could hear their point of view; as it is, only one former slave gets to say anything about his horrific experiences.
Overall, however, this is a story worth getting to know.",1196121600,6,832,4.533333333333333
1577086,5,B00005JPOE,"This is a beautiful, epic film with so many different dimensions that make the heart-soul soar!!  I realized shortly after the end of it that I need to see it again and view from another perspective. We see Wilburforce's frustration with his tireless efforts not coming to fruition, and as it unfolds, we see that in a way, he too is enslaved--to the opiate painkiller, laudanum.  Looking back from the ending, we see that all his tireless and frustrated efforts for so long did not come to fruition until he was finally able to conquer his addiction, so that his newborn son would see and know the ""real"" (drug-free) Wilburforce.  Both Wilburforce and his cloistered former preacher-former slaveowner Newton were plagued by personal demons of conscience, and it was only when they faced these demons and solemnly vowed to not be ruled by them with the help of Holy God,  that their dreams of abolishing the slave trade finally came to fruition.

One additional comment:  For all who have been soured/jaded by outward, institutional religion and legalism, this film is not a ""religious"" or ""Christian Bible Pounding"" film.  It is a historical-political film in which 2 men's souls were moved by the unseen Spirit of God to break the bonds of slavery, over persons bought/sold by men,  and over free men whose souls are under enemy occupation by the demons of addiction.  This is a soaring, uplifting film of epic proportions.",1196035200,3,1425,4.8796680497925315
1577087,4,B00005JPOE,"This is a good movie whose story is so important that it raises the movie above its quirks and flaws.  Simply, you should see this movie.  Better, you should read the book ""Amazing Grace"" and learn about the real life of William Wilberforce.  However, this movie is a fine place to start.  Yes, the nitpickers can find flaws (starting with the star being much taller than the character he is playing), but they really don't matter so much.

William Wilberforce was the son of a very wealthy merchant family from Hull (northern England).  He was an orator of genius and very charismatic.  He had health issues with his bowels for which opium was the only remedy in his time.  His friends were the worldly types such as William Pitt the Younger and the very religious of the dissenter variety such as Isaac Milner and others.  When Pitt was converted and became a committed Christian he felt God had two important missions for him: To lift the lives of the poor and to free the slaves.

This movie is not a biography of the life of William Wilberforce nor does aim to tell the whole story of the abolishment of slavery.  It is a picture that tells the story of that part of Wilberforce's life in Parliament that, over a generation, overthrew the slave trade.  While the movie is very impressionistic with the history of the Parliamentary battle, it does get the sense of opposition and hatred across to the viewer.  I found the jumping between the past and the movie's present time and bit confusing because the star, Ioan Gruffudd, doesn't age in any consistent way even though the last triumphant scene took place in 1833 when Wilberforce was out of Parliament and is a conflation of many successes along the way.  There was no single triumph that ended slavery once and for all.

Charles Fox was never a Lord and had died in 1806.  John Newton was never the crazed hermit depicted in the movie.  The fiction created to represent him is well played by Albert Finney and captures the anguish and guilt felt by so many in the abolitionist movement for the society that had enslaved so many humans beings, but in no way captured the real life public activism of the former slave ship captain.

Still, with the conflations, anachronisms, and outright fictions, you really should learn the name of William Wilberforce.  He was a great and good man who gave his life and fortune to the betterment of mankind.  But don't stop with the movie.  Your life will be enriched by getting to know the real life human being with all his complexity and struggles.

1577161,5,B00005JPOE,"I was able to view this film in a prescreening a few weeks before it was released in theaters.  Unfortunately it did not receive a whole lot of attention, and had a fairly short theatrical run.  But I'm hoping it will do well on DVD.

This is the true story of William Wilburforce, the man who stood alone in the English Parliament, working tirelessly to end the terrible slave trade in England.  It is an uplifting film, dramatically demonstrating how one man with a few loyal supporters can win the hearts of a nation and change the world.

The message of Christ rings clear and true throughout the film, never descending to syrupy sentimentalism or beating the viewer over the head with preachy dialog.  One feels the moral conviction that drove Wilburforce to put his faith into action instead of being content to sit on the side and gaze and spiderwebs.

I watched the film again this weekend after buying it on DVD.  And I was struck with the relevance it bears, especially this year.  With upcoming elections in the United States, many are tempted to look for ""electablility"" first and principle second.  We would do well to learn from William Wilburforce.  He was one man fighting the representatives of an entire nation for what he knew was right.

I don't want to get too political here, but this is a political film in a political world.  To me, Ron Paul is a modern American Wilburforce.  He is one man standing for right in a Congress full of men molded by the establishment, just as Wilburforce stood against the whole of Parliament when slavery was accepted as the status quo.  They said Wilburforce was crazy.  An idealist whose morals could never work practically in the real world.

So this next year I'll be voting for Ron Paul for President of the United States.",1195603200,,1782,4.642172523961661

The acting is this movie is superb. Some of Britain's finest take center stage in this production.  This is a family friendly and Christian friendly film.",1195516800,,473,4.8875
1577163,5,B00005JPOE,"On the surface it is a historical movie about the work of William Wilberforce against the English participation in the African slave trade at the turn of the 19th century.
But i think that the writer's had much more to say about English society than this, things that are still important and ought to be considered.

Their deeper criticism is about the hierarchical nature of English society, the rulers and the ruled, the elite landowning and servant owning class and the masses of people toiling in the farms, fields and factories. There are several places where this criticism breaks the surface of the movie: the scene where the servant steps over the fence and sits in the field with Wilberforce and together contemplate spider webs, the scene in Parliament where the Whig opposition leader asks Wilberforce ""the people?"", and the analogy of America opening the bottle of revolution and France pouring it out.

The defenders of America slavery in the 19thC took the issue of the hierarchical nature of society very much to heart, Robert Dabney in defense of virginia, stated boldly that without a natural hierarchy and an elite of rulers, and an underclass of slaves, Christian society was doomed to a radical equalitarianism stemming from the French revolution's atheistic call of arms.

Wilberforce himself was an independent, but he supported wholeheartedly the Tory administration of his friend William Pitt, elements of this friendship make up a substantial thread in Amazing Grace. It is the Tory flurtation with French revolutionary thought that gets Wilberforce and others in trouble during the war years with France. The movie firmly takes a stand not only against the slave trade, for the moral improvement program of Wilberforce, but for the gradual flattening of English society into a meritocratic democracy rather than the traditional Whiggish view of elitism, as the movie so aptly sums it up near the end in the term-""Nobilis oblige"".

What i find curious is that only one review here hints at the larger criticism of society that this movie attempts. Slavery is not a burning issue in our society, but wage-slavery (as the wobblies pointed out) is much the same thing, elitism and a heritary hierarchy without reference to individual achievement is a big problem in England and an increasing problem in Western culture in general and the US in particular. If you look at the movie in this way it becomes not so much a criticism of a form of economics which rightly died in the mid 19thC, but part of an ongoing struggle for genuine participation in political and social life for all people, not only the ruling classes.

I think that the writers avoided strongly pursuing this theme because the current climate of the natural audience of the movie, Christians are far more aligned with Whiggish theories of history and economics then classical liberal Tory type views and they really couldn't sell the movie to this group if they had made the elements stronger. but the fact that in Christ there is no Jew nor Gentile, no rich or poor, the theme of the field scene about spider webs and such, is one of the greatest criticisms of a hierarchical society that mankind has ever believed.

It is a good movie, just look a bit deeper than a historical piece about Wilberforce and the ending of the british slave trade. it is an amazing and productive period of history and i'm glad someone was able to make a somewhat popular movie about a few of the pieces of the puzzle that is the Whig-Tory 18-19thC dance.",1195516800,2,3526,4.878130217028381
1577164,3,B00005JPOE,"That this is an amazing story no one can deny, and the story has been capably transferred to the screen.  However it seems clear that many stylistic changes were made to give the movie a more American ""Hollywood"" style, rather than a more understated and realistic British film style.  This is somewhat jarring to watch, because of course the film is fully cast with great British actors giving top-notch performances - but it seems at many points that the orchestra soars a little too much, and the director attempts to pull one's heart strings a little too much - when the story itself is more than adequate to do that on its own.

My one big complaint, however, has to be with the DVD artwork.  Once again we see the opportunity for a great and inspirational cover thrown away by a belief that the only thing which sells DVD's to Americans is the number of famous faces one can place on the cover.  Remember the movie poster?  It was very melancholy, with Ioan Gruffud looking away into the distance.  It was a marvelous photo which has been replaced here with strips of ""action stills"" which - while showing scenes from the movie - completely fail to communicate the SUBSTANCE of it.

Typically the British do a much better job, handling DVD artwork more like that of a rock album - in a much more subtle and interesting way.  Just slide on over to Amazon.co.uk and look at the their ""Amazing Grace"" artwork.  Wow!  Now all that sun filtering down through the trees just screams ""Amazing Grace"" to me.  And what's more there's not a famous face to be seen - just a scene which invokes this story powerfully.

At this point I would normally tell everyone that you should have already bought a universal ""Region-free"" DVD player so that you can buy such DVD's from across the pond.  Typically a Brit-centric film like this would have far more extras on the UK release, but unfortunately they've bucked the trend and let us down with that this time.  Of course the current exchange rate also makes that an expensive enterprise.  It should be noted, though, that you will usually get more extras on a UK release of a British film, and always get better picture and sound on the UK release of any British TV show made before the late 90's.  A lot of picture quality us dumped during the transfer process to US DVD from the UK tapes which the older shows were recorded on, but you don't lose that if you watch the UK DVD on a universal DVD player.

Anyway, the trend of US DVD covers is a disturbing one, so we need to complain every chance we get in the hope that it will change.  If we as consumers demand a better product intead of the most commercial one, we might just get it someday.

What attracted me to this movie was the cast(Ioan Griffud, Albert Finney, and Michael Gambon).  The movie shows the parliamentary machinations and the persistence of Wilberforce to abolish the slave trade in Great Britain.  This is despite personal and health problems.

The film is a personal inspiration showing that determination and patience will yield positive, long term, change. The film was cast well from the lead characters to secondary characters.  Rufus Sewell did well as Clarkson, serving as the Devil's Advocate for revolution.  Toby Hughes, as the Duke of Clarence, portrayed the old guard.

The film switched back and forth between two time periods.  Sometimes, this was confusing.  I would have liked to see more of Albert Finney as John Newton.

Amazing Grace tells the story of England's attempt to banish slavery from its kingdom. Hurting after the loss of those rapscallion colonies, the British Parliament is debating whether or not to end the African slave trade. One William Wilberforce, a devoted social rights advocate (evidenced by his fondness for animals and the poor), takes up the cause after a particular confrontation with a group of abolitionists one night at dinner. It turns out the journey to end the slave trade begins to wreck his health, and despite some clever ploys to get people to side with him, he ends up strung out on laudanum. Enter Barbara Spooner, herself an advocate for the many social causes that Wilber himself believes in, begins to rejuvinate his devotion and ardor.

The performances of Ioan Gruffudd and Romola Garai carry this film throughout. As Wilber, Ioan is passionate and deeply committed to his performance. Early on, we discover that he finds God (or does God find him, he ponders). Rather than being overwrought and preachy, Gruffudd's sense of joy is palpable. Albert Finney's turn as the former slave ship captain that reforms and writes the title song is brief but glorious, making me wish he was in more films.

Nothing, the stirring music nor the wonderful performances, can overcome the raw emotion this film has. As the people struggle against great odds, there passion and sense of justice only grows. Somehow, from somewhere, they only get stronger in their search for emancipation. This culminates in a final scene that swells with emotion without ever being melodramatic; with fervor without ever being harried.

And as the final scene with the bagpipe and band playing the infamous tune ""Amazing Grace"" becomes even more than this. It becomes a transformative message of hope, devotion, and ultimately love. What a movie!",1195257600,22,2059,5.029325513196481

1577260,5,B00005JPOE,"AMAZING GRACE  is a beautifully mounted, well-scripted, powerful film that reminds us that there were heroes in the late 1700s who vehemently fought the fight for abolition of slavery. Benefiting from a tight intelligent script by Steven Knight and directed with great sensitivity and fluidity by Michael Apted, the film captures the flavor of the turn of the 18th century into 19th century in England when slavery was a commodity the wealthy could ill afford to lose, and how the courage and perseverance of William Wilberforce created probably one of the first human rights movements on record.

William Wilberforce (Ioan Gruffudd) witnessed the horrors of transporting slaves from Africa to be sold around the world to wealthy plantation owners and to serve as cheap and disrespected servants to the British populace.  Encouraged by a previous slave dealer John Newton (Albert Finney) turned contrite priest, his friend Prime Minister William Pitt (Benedict Cumberbatch), and the informed woman of his life Barbara Spooner (Romola Garai), Wilberforce bonds with a band of abolitionists including Thomas Clarkson (Rufus Sewell) and Oloudaqh Equiano (Youssou N'Dour) and begins long years of battling for abolition in the Parliament where cads such as Lord Tarleton (Ciarn Hinds) and the Duke of Clarence (Toby Jones) fight his every word.

One of the hallmarks of this fine film is the dignity it sustains: in a film that could have easily focused on depictions of slave abuse to make its point, it instead elects to keep the focus on the heart of the struggle against the inhumanity by subtle yet powerful means.  The title of the film, of course, comes form the song the reformed John Newton wrote as he had a life altering experience to end his slave trading to fight for human rights.  It is a haunting reminder that is used throughout the film in the score by David Arnold.  The cast is uniformly excellent with not only first class performances by each of the leads, but also by superb cameos from such fine artists as Michael Gambon, Nicholas Farrell, Sylvestra Le Touzel, Jeremy Swift, and Stephen Campbell Moore.  The atmosphere of both elegance and poverty of London is captured in the cinematography by Remi Adefarasin. This is an epic film with a powerful message that deserves the attention of us all.

1577261,3,B00005JPOE,"While Amazing Grace is a good movie, I wasn't as impressed as I hoped I would be. I much preferred Amistad. One of the reasons might be because I only watched it once but some movies, such as Amistad, take only one viewing to really leave an impression.  For me, I think one of the things that disappointed me was the lack of African-American actors and also, not enough was spent on the terrible aspects of the slave trade. I don't mean by that to say, horror filled scenes of the slave trade in action should have been shown except for maybe an example or two to give the audience somewhat of a feel for how horrible it really was. I know the movie was about William Wilberforce and his efforts to abolish the slave trade and, therefore, the story focused on him and rightly so. I just think a bit more of the African experience should have been shown as it would have re-inforced the good Wilberforce was trying to do.  I loved the ending performance of ""Amazing Grace"".",1195171200,7,973,4.4
1577262,3,B00005JPOE,"Amazing Grace is a silly title for this film, designed, I assume to capture a conservative, Christian audience. Why? Because the song refers to God's grace, poured out on the undeserving. Wilberforce's faith was not a component of his life; it was what drove his every action. But this movie was clearly made by people who see religious belief as a quaint custom from the past. It exemplifies a very modern sensibility: Christianity, if it must exist at all, should be a social club dedicated to doing good works. ""Oh how nice it was when those nice religious folks did such nice things,"" say, I suppose, the Hollywood folk who created this pap. But the lyrics to Amazing Grace are not about doing good things. Even worthy good things. They show how God rescues us from sin and despair and gives us new life. ""I was blind, but now I see."" Despite the droning bagpipes and funereal pace that conclude the film, it is a happy song. We have received a priceless gift. Wilberforce is never shown as either blind or seeing. And his faith is a jolly willingness to enjoy nature, but little more.

So, the drive that came from unshakable faith is missing. We see a driven man, but driven because he's a softy, not because he loves God. And how did a whole culture change its mind in just a few years? Slavery had been the way of the world since the beginning of time (and still is in many places.) The English, the owner of the seas, making a good living transporting this human cargo, stopped. And gave up an immensely profitable practice. That is an astounding, nearly unparalleled, accomplishment. How did this happen? One man? No, there was much more going on during this time, and we witness precious little of that. It's as if Wilberforce was working in a vacuum (sure we see the petitions, though why a body generally elected by a very tiny percentage of the populace would care about them I cannot say.)

And, I suppose, as a sop to feminists, his wife is portrayed as a fiery believer, capable of an all-night discussion (which would never have happened between two unmarried people such as these) not the happy stay-at-home mom she apparently was.

Not a bad film, with superlative performances all around, but one that downplays what was important to its protagonists and focuses on what is important to a contemporary audience.",1195084800,22,2332,4.655339805825243
1577263,4,B00005JPOE,"Ioan Gruffudd gives an invigorating performance as William Wilberforce, the sharp-witted, determined supporter of abolition in Amazing Grace, the true story of one man's struggle against a kingdom. With impressive performances from an equally impressive cast, this epic battle is one fought not with blood and steel, but of intelligent words and cunning linguistics. Brimming with intricate character development, pertinent morals, and thematic gusto, Amazing Grace is a period piece not confined by its period or the piece of history it so masterfully depicts.

In 18th century England, William Wilberforce (Ioan Gruffudd) fought tirelessly in Parliament to end slavery and the slave trade throughout the British Empire. Amazing Grace chronicles his successes and defeats and also delves deeper into the life of the remarkable idealist and the events that shaped and influenced his extraordinary career. Forced to contend with debilitating illness as well as the ruthlessly powerful and deviously manipulative lords supporting the slave trade, Wilberforce overcame adverse odds and managed to construct a diverse and unexpectedly strong movement for abolition. Comprised of a flashback structure that relates his many tribulations, Amazing Grace also reveals a poignant tale of love, friendship, and the unending efforts that led to his monumental achievements.

Based on the true story of William Wilberforce and his endeavors in Parliament to abolish slavery, Amazing Grace utilizes flashbacks to connect the arcing storyline that traverses several years nonsequentially. At once both an engaging courtroom drama and a whimsical love story, the carefully structured film remains assertively paced throughout and the mood is seldom as grim as its subject matter would expectedly afford. Combined with compelling characters and subsequently affecting character development, Amazing Grace boasts a surprisingly epic feel for a film devoid of any gladiators or soldiers dying on the battlefield.

Though its themes are powerfully presented, Amazing Grace would not have achieved its pronounced conviction were it not for the overwhelming talent of its cast. Ioan Gruffudd magnificently portrays the brazen speaker with rebellious charm and heartfelt sincerity from his stunning accomplishments to his tragic defeats. Aiding him in his ceaseless crusade are Pitt (Benedict Cumberbatch) and Clarkson (Rufus Sewell) who both give strong performances; Pitt as a figurehead working behind the scenes and Clarkson as his resolute right-hand man. Michael Gambon effortlessly scene steals as the cynically droll Lord Fox, ever ready with his sharp tongue and comedically commanding presence. Albert Finney also turns in a bold portrayal of John Newton, the former slave ship captain who wrote the title song and sought forgiveness for his sins. The antagonistic Lord Tarleton (Ciaran Hinds) and Duke of Clarence (Toby Jones) add a refined touch of villainy to their characters, creating a far more satisfying conclusion when they finally fall to the band of ingenious heroes. Not a dull performance exists in this graceful drama, and even the rather expected love interest is handled refreshingly by the lovely Romola Garai.

Perhaps a bit over sentimental at times, Amazing Grace still captivates with its diverse cast of exceptional talent, often movingly witty dialogue, magnificent recreations of 18th century costumes and sets, and the incredible true story of one man's unceasing quest for justice. Thankfully relinquishing any long-winded speeches, Amazing Grace allows the actions of the dauntless Wilberforce and his followers to do what they do best - speak for themselves.

It was a story of courage and sacrifice, and it seemed strange that I had never heard it before. The character of William also fascinated me. So when I saw this yesterday I literally pounced on it, knowing it had to be great. It was great, though it focused more on what Williams faith produced than on his faith itself. Beautifully filmed and thouhtfully written, the little known story of a compassionate and strong-willed young man who changed history was brought to life with an all British cast. The settings and costumes were good, and the acters were well chosen. The array of eccentric characters made it seem a bit like Dickens. Wilberforce himself was an odd man, with poor people he didn't know crowding his dining room at lunch time and all kinds of animals running around. His friend Thomas Clarkston caught my eye every time he came on screen. He didn't have many lines and never changed his expression, but Rufus Sewell can do more with a wistful, stoney glare than most actors can do with a dozen speeches. An intrigueing, dark character, greying, sandy hair swaying in the breeze beneath a scare-crow hat . . . And Pitt, another friend of Wilberforce, is convincing in a quiet way. Would watch it again just to hear his accent. The special features are as rich as the movie. Actor interviws, a music video by Chris Tomlin, and a section where a young modern-day abolitionist speaks out on slavery today. Politics often stand in the way of justice, now, as then, and this movie reminds us not to quit fighting for what's right when the tide of political sway is against you. ""If not you, who?

Instead, it tells the story of William Wilberforce, the man who led the fight to end slavery in England.  The hymn of the title is William's favorite hymn and shows up a few times in the soundtrack.  Still, I don't completely get why the movie got this title.  Either way, that's my only complaint.

William Wilberforce (Ioan Gruffudd) was a member of Parliament during the late 1700's.  He hadn't been in politics too long when God got a hold of him.  While he was good at politics, he felt pulled to devote his life to God.  But through the encourage of his friends, especially Prime Minister to be William Pitt (Benedict Cumberbatch) and preacher John Newton (Albert Finney), he found another calling for his life - leading the fight to end slavery in the British Empire.

This movie begins in 1797, and in a series of flashbacks, tells the story of William beginning his struggle to end slavery.  In 1797, his poor health and constant defeats lead him to almost give up his calling.  Will he stop or keep fighting?

William Wilberforce was a deeply committed Christian, and that influenced much of his life.  But don't let that fact scare you away from this wonderful film.  Christianity is an ever present part of the story, but the movie never preaches.  And, unlike many Christian movies, this one is well written, acted, and produced.

I often have a hard time getting into period movies, and this one was no exception.  But once I figure out who everyone was, I got lost in the story.  The movie brings in the larger historical context, making it that much richer.  And the costumes and sets are wonderful.  Everyone in the cast does a great job.  Obviously, the movie is mostly series, but a few comic moments help lighten the mood.  They really took me by surprise and made me laugh out loud.

Mainly through words, this movie depicts the harsh realities that were the slave trade.  Frankly, this made the horror all the more real to me.  There are two uses of the ""n"" word.  They are jarring.  While historically accurate, I think their use was intended to jar us.

As I watched the story unfold, I couldn't help but notice how little has changed in politics in the last 200 years.  Frankly, this gave me hope that some of the issues of today will eventually be resolved despite how it looks from year to year.

1577338,5,B00005JPOE,"If you watch this expecting a ""Christian movie"", you'll probably be disappointed. If you watch this expecting a movie about a Christian and how his faith informs and directs his life and his work, you'll probably be greatly encouraged.

Amazing Grace tells the story of William Wilberforce, a member of the British parliament in the late 18th and early 19th century, who worked to abolish Britain's involvement in the slave trade. Wilberforce's co-MPs posed quite the opposition, both because of prejudices and economic factors (the livelihood of many who voted them into office depended on the slave trade).

Although strongly interested in abolition early in his career, he began to wonder if a newly redisovered faith demanded that he abandon politics and dedicate himself full-time to ""the Lord's work"". He consulted with many -- even John Newton, a former slave ship captain and writer of the eponymous hymn -- all of whom recommended that he remain in politics.

While still wrestling with the decision, Wilberforce encountered Thomas Clarkson and several other abolitionists who convinced him that he could marry the two concepts -- by pushing hard for abolition in the political arena in which he found himself, he would be doing ""the Lord's work"".

And therein lies the crux of the story for the Christian who is watching this film. While God certainly calls some to abandon a ""secular"" career for a ""sacred"" one, there is work to be done in the secular world in which we live. And Wilberforce did not stop wrestling with which way to go until God gave him a clear sign through Clarkson and company.

How the story ended is obvious -- when's the last time you saw a British slave ship? But how it gets there, and the lives of those involved, is what is so compelling. I'm not really one for historical movies about 18th century Brits -- my dad rolls his eyes at my mom's enjoyment of what he calls ""stiff neck-ed"" movies -- but I was pulled in quite quickly. People from a distant land and even more distant time come alive as regular people.

William Wilberforce was a man extraordinarily used by God in a ""secular"" profession. This is the message of Amazing Grace -- the movie, the song, and grace itself.",1192924800,9,2216,4.787958115183246
1577339,3,B00005JPOE,"I had been looking forward to seeing this ever since the film came out but I regret to say I was disappointed. Ioan Gruffudd was better than I expected as Wilberforce. My beef is with Michael Apted the director for giving such a blatantly unhistorical drama. I do not have time to list the errors but the two most blatant ones are to do with John Newton. The present tune we sing to Amazing Grace was unknown in England at that time so Wilberforce would never have sung it. Newton was not a monk plagued by guilt for being a slave captain. He was a vicar who knew God's grace and forgiveness, hence the hymn. Right from the start when a screen caption told us the British Empire was built on the back of slaves one sensed that present day (erroneous) judgment may be evident. Wilberforce was not bothered by his addiction to opium. It was the one analgesic available and he controlled, not increased, his dosage throughout his life. I do though doubt that he would have been alone with an unmarried lady, unchaperoned through the night. The production is so inaccurate I thought that the director must be American, but no, to our shame he is British, portraying a royal duke in the House of Commons, Fox erroneously ennobled and still there to give the econium on Wilberforce in the hour of triumph though Fox died before 1807.

It was not merely the historical inaccuracy that disappointed me. The flash backs were confusing and took away from the whirlwind nature of Wilberforce's courtship. I found the whole thing rather dull and not a patch on say, Chariots of Fire for an inspirational Christian theme. It was sympathetically done but could have been so much better.

1577340,4,B00005JPOE,"Amazing grace

A movie about the ending of the slave trade and the eventual ending of slavery in Britain is a worthy subject in this year of the celebration of the 200th anniversary of its abolition. One should note that this was done, unlike in the United States, by mainly democratic means rather than civil war. Would that all our victories could be won in such a manner but history is replete with many more examples of the necessity for bloody social struggles, win or lose.

The core of this film is however a little disquieting as to its fidelity to historic facts or at least the way they are presented on the screen. In my youth I believed that Wilberforce's parliamentary fight was the key to abolition. While it is impossible to ignore his contribution to the struggle against slavery time and more study have revealed many other factors, not the least the push from below by the working class and other oppressed strata of British society, in contributing to that result. Based solely on the film one would never get the impression that those efforts from below counted and once again we are treated to that timeworn premise that the `great man' was decisive.

Commercial films are not obliged by their nature to be paragons of historical correctness. An informative article in a recent New York Review of Books (June 14, 2007) discusses in greater detail the historical problems than I wish to do here.  While I encourage everyone to see this film (if for not other reason that the magnificent performance by Albert Finney) one should use that as a starting point to investigate the other details about this great struggle to end a heinous crime against blacks and against humanity.",1192492800,10,1695,4.755102040816326
1577341,5,B00005JPOE,"I've long been a fan of William Wilberforce - a man that God used greatly for a great cause: the abolition of slavery and the reformation of manners into the English society.  Working at a private Christian school, I often refer to Wilberforce as an example to our students of what God can do with one man wholly committed to Him.  In fact, I took sixteen of our students to see the movie when it was released and it had a very profound impact on their lives and thinking -- they saw with their own eyes the struggle of Wilberforce's life, the great cause to which he gave himself fully, and the great joy that comes from a life given in service to the King of Kings.

While I strongly recommend that all Christians watch this movie, parents I'll warn you that the issue of slavery isn't easy to watch or understand at a young age -- I would recommend this movie to middle school students and older, but probably not elementary-aged students.

There are some wonderful resources that you can get to accompany this movie for family discussions and devotions.  While most of the Wilberforce books are lengthy, but excellent, let me tell you about a few lesser-known gems.  First, John Piper has a great little 76 page book titled Amazing Grace in the Life of William Wilberforce -- great read.  This same material is actually found in another book by Piper that is simply outstanding -- it is the third book in a series by Piper to reintroduce our generation to some of the great saints of the faith -- Book Three is titled The Roots of Endurance and examines the lives of John Newton, Charles Simeon and William Wilberforce.  Finally, one of my favorite finds is a 5 disk CD audio drama set titled Amazing Grace produced by the Focus on the Family Radio Theatre -- you can listen to the lives of Newton, Wilberforce and Olaudah Equiano (a slave who purchased his freedom and was instrumental in the abolition movement in England).

His mentor, John Newton, who wrote the hymn 'Amazing Grace,' taught him about what slavery was. In the theatrical version of the story, Wilberforce wanted to go into the ministry. Newton suggests to him his calling is to free the slaves, to make that his life's work.

Oh that we had such passion for the things of this life today. I liked it becaused it showed about the potential in man to accomplish great things if he has a heart. I am a believer in God, yet, not a religionist. Religion, sometimes, causes more difficulty because it is so much like men and not like the God that it is attached to. Wilberforce lived his religion. Who knows though, maybe he was an enlightened soul, who really was against the crown, or maybe he really saw the commonalities between himself and the Jacobites in France. He was able to hold forth in his battle in the Parliament.

It is a story like no other in recent times. I hope that more come to see it, that it gets its time in the media. We never really heard much about it. It is a story for everyone. Historical, with a strong ethic for the love of mankind. Wilberforce and his story will inspire people to stand for what they believe. In the times we live in today, it is rare for people to stand up for what is right. Wilberforce is an example of almost unwavering commitment to a cause.

The world was better for his efforts, I think you will be better for seeing, Amazing Grace. I am getting the DVD.",1190851200,9,1835,4.267241379310345
1577345,5,B00005JPOE,"Seldom does a film come along that has somewhat ""religious"" overtones that does not somehow gender strong and polarizing opinions. Michael Apted and Patricia Heaton have done just that in their magnificently produced,directed,scripted and acted ""biopic"" on William Wilberforce, the Father of the Abolition of the English Slave Trade. The story of this courageous man and his uphill struggle to bring The Middle Passage Slave Trade to extinction is eye-catching,beautifully filmed and edited with A-listed English actors who totally inhabit their very demanding roles with finesse and sensitivity. The story is fairly presented and is not in the least ""preachy"" or over sentimental. Having studied the lives and times of the main characters in this film, I found the events to be accurate and well presented. Ioan Gruffudd as Wilberforce always can be expected to turn in a top drawer effort...and he does. Benedict Cumberbatch is a positive revelation as William Pitt. This film does not shy away from Wilberforce's Christianity as it was a part of the man;yet the film does not become overly religious so to make the man any more or less than he was. In fact, Wilberforce is presented in a very fair and balanced light. This film should not offend or discourage anyone whatever their belief system. This film focuses on the prevailing political system of the day and one man's determination to win freedom for Black Slaves. You will be well educated and inspired. A true 5+ star film.",1190505600,11,1485,5.0653061224489795

Anyone who has seen AMISTAD or ROOTS needs to see the Michael Apted directed AMAZING GRACE which predates and fills in so much of the political and humanistic tug of war that existed concerning the awful dirty business of the African Slave Trade. Hollywood could not have conjectured a more true film than the actual true and inspiring life of William Wilberforce,a revered heroic figure in England,who,with the help of other abolitionists and political sympathizers,takes on the English Parliament and wins legislation to finally end the Slave Trade in 1807. This movie is SO significant because it is this piece of history that leads other European nations to follow suit in subsequent years and eventually to abolish the trade worldwide. Michael Apted has skillfully rescued this story from being another biopic,and has turned it into a sweeping epic that rings historically true.
No finer actor could have been chosen to play Wilberforce than the Emmy Award winning Welsh marvel Ioan Gruffudd,pronounced YO-an Griffith( HORATIO HORNBLOWER,SOLOMON AND GAENOR,VERY ANNIE MARY).Gruffudd positively understands the heart and soul of Wilberforce,and delivers a tender yet dynamic knockout performance of this absolutely giant among men whose inner convictions and powerful and persuasive rhetoric eventually win over Parliament in a nearly twenty year life-and-death struggle.
This film brings tremendously true and historical understanding of the political machine that was (and frankly still is) in place from 1785 to 1807. Historical figures argue and debate their opposing views while the lives of millions of innocent Africans and the fortunes and supremacies of national pride hang in the balance. The film moves swiftly and is not preachy or at all heavy-handed in any direction. It simply tells and honest and riveting true-to-life story. Some characters and events are combined together to compact the screenplay,but no truth is lost in the outcome.
The film takes it's name from the famous 18th-century renowned hymn AMAZING GRACE,written by the Anglican minister John Newton,who had,years earlier,himself been an active and ardent participant in the selling of African flesh. John Newton is portrayed (a bit much like a crazy old celibate monk) by veteran actor Albert Finney in one of the smaller supporting supporting roles. Though much of what Newton says in the film is directly from his own memoirs,he was a married man,who,historically,valued his wife as his best friend. Now in his declining years,Newton,who has in later years been Rector of a London Church,is sought out by Wilberforce,who sat under Newton's pulpit as a child,to have the old minister help him in the cause of exposing the Slave Trade in all of it's ugliness. As was true in Newton's real life,Finney shows that this is the singlemost painful event in Newton's life thus making it next to impossible to discuss. The film directs Newton and Wilberforce over the course of the twenty years in order for the awful truth to come forth. Proof was necessary to persuade Parliament, and Newton was a key piece to passing the abolitionist legislation.
Up and coming actor Benedict Cumberbatch accurately conveys William Pitt The Younger,in his boyhood friendship with Wilberforce and his subsequent rise to Prime Minister of England. What is inspiring about their relationship is that all of their political idealism comes to fruition showing the power and perseverance that these two young men had in fighting an age old institution that threatened to destabilize all of England. Other historical figures in this film such as Lord Tarlton (the ever amazing Ciaran Hinds)and Equiano (Youssou N'dour),Toby Jones as Lord Clarence (this actor seems to be able to play EVERYTHING!!!) and actors Michael Gambon as Sir Charles Fox do the utmost to bring this film to the heart and consciences of the world today.
This film is simply NOT just another period piece drama or an ""inspirational"" film;rather it is an artfully scripted,deftly acted and directed and compelling piece of historical drama that all will benefit from viewing. Again,5 *****'s is not sufficient. May there be more films of such quality and substance made like this!
Excellent companion films would be A RESPECTABLE TRADE,THE MIDDLE PASSAGE,AMISTAD,THE VOYAGE OF LA AMISTAD, MANSFIELD PARK (1999) and somewhat ROOTS.",1190505600,24,4426,5.304843304843305

1577398,5,B00005JPOE,"Every decade or so, a motion picture comes along that captures its subject's heroic essence so perfectly that the film becomes its subject. Such is the case with British director Michael Apted's superb biopic on abolitionist William Wilberforce, passionately portrayed by Welsh actor Ioan Gruffudd.

Though Wilberforce is largely unknown to Americans today, this movie is an excellent introduction to the great English parliamentarian who devoted twenty years of his life to eradicating the slave trade throughout the British Empire. (All slavery had been abolished in Great Britain itself by a judicial decision in 1772.) A devoutly religious though thoroughly skeptical man, Wilberforce figured prominently during both the Enlightenment and Britain's Evangelical Revival.

The movie opens as the eighteenth century draws to a close, with Wilberforce not at the beginning of his crusade to end the barbaric practice of slavery, but at what seems to be its most hopeless point. Once one of the youngest members of the House of Commons and a powerful orator, he's now gaunt and dejected, having nearly exhausted his fortune and health in service of his fight.

Riding in a carriage along the muddy road in the rain, he happens upon a driver whipping his fallen horse. Moved to the animal's defense (he was a founding member of the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals), Wilberforce uses simple logic to persuade the driver to cease his brutal flogging, explaining that the horse would more likely regain its strength if left to recover for an hour. This simple exchange, in which he achieves his ideals through practical persuasion, reveals his forceful personality and unyielding integrity, traits that would serve him so well throughout his career as a legislator.

Wilberforce is on his way to the resort town of Bath, There, he hopes, the famous mineral springs will heal his body from the ravages of colitis and addiction to laudanum, an opiate prescribed by his doctors. When he arrives, however, his friends, economist Henry Thornton (Nicholas Farrell) and his wife Marianne (Sylvestra Le Touzel), have a different sort of tonic in mind to cure what ails him. They slyly maneuver their friend into a ""chance"" meeting with a ravishingly beautiful young abolitionist and social reformer, Barbara Spooner (Romola Garai). Resenting his friends' manipulations, he at first rebuffs her. But the Thorntons are relentless and soon set him up again, bringing Barbara to dinner at Wilberforce's house.

This time their chemistry is too powerful to deny. Barbara and William launch a long conversation that extends into the wee hours. The subject turns to his tireless but fruitless efforts to stop the slave trade, a story told in flashbacks that constitute the bulk of the film.

Elected to Parliament at twenty-one in 1780, Wilberforce barrels into the House of Commons full of piss and vinegar, taking on all comers with his confrontational debating style and razor-sharp wit. One dewy morning, as he lolls about his lawn, transfixed at the intricacy of God's handiwork in a spider web, he experiences a spiritual epiphany.

After his conversion, Wilberforce's interest in the affairs of state evaporates and he ponders a life of religious contemplation. But to those around him--especially William Pitt the Younger (Benedict Cumberbatch), a friend in Parliament who's angling to become Britain's youngest Prime Minister--Wilberforce's divine spark would be better put to practical use. Pitt asks him, ""Do you intend to use your beautiful voice to praise the Lord, or to change the world?""

Wilberforce isn't convinced until a group of Quaker abolitionists visit one evening. They bring along a liberated slave from the New World, Olaudah Equiano (Youssou N'Dour), whose memoirs about his horrific passage from Africa would soon spark public outrage against the peculiar institution. He is shocked by the brand on Equiano's chest (""to let you know you no longer belong to God, but to a man,"" the former slave explains) and by his iron shackles.

""We understand you're having problems choosing whether to do the work of God, or the work of a political activist,"" says radical abolitionist Thomas Clarkson (Rufus Sewell). Another guest (Georgie Glen) finishes the thought: ""We humbly suggest that you can do both.""

Taking up the battle, Wilberforce introduces a bill every year to abolish the slave trade--and every year the bill is defeated. Yet he perseveres. In a nation where slavery is largely out of sight and mind, he constantly contrives ways to force it into the faces of polite society. He launches petition drives and sponsors meetings where Equiano lectures and sells copies of his book. At a gathering of MPs and their wives aboard a tour boat, the captain weighs anchor alongside a slave ship just returned from a run between Africa and Jamaica. Wilberforce notes that only a third of the original six hundred passengers survived the journey, and exclaims, ""That smell is the smell of death. Slow, painful death. . . .Breathe it deeply. Take those handkerchiefs away from your noses! There now, remember that smell.""

Wilberforce ends his painful reminiscing, too taxed to go on. Barbara is clearly moved, finding inspiration in his struggle. The two passionately talk of their ideals, while the sexual tension silently builds between them. If Barbara's fiery red tresses, flawless peaches-and-cream complexion, and corseted, heaving cleavage weren't sufficient to bag the man, nothing would have stirred him. Without a word spoken of love (not to mention sex), romance blossoms instantly and inevitably.

As morning breaks, the two announce their engagement to their friends.

I like this little touch, coming as it did from out of left field. This is old-fashioned moviemaking at its best, with courtship scenes far more erotically charged than the crassly explicit sex in most movies nowadays.

Their marriage and Barbara's pregnancy become a beautifully simple metaphor for Wilberforce's own regeneration of health and will. He heads back to Parliament to fight the good fight once more. Political intrigue moves front and center as Tories Wilberforce and Pitt, along with the abolitionist Clarkson and Whig MP Charles Fox (Michael Gambon, best known as the Headmaster in the Harry Potter series), put their heads together to plot the end of the slave trade. What follows is the best depiction of political machinations that I've seen since Otto Preminger's political thriller Advise & Consent, based on Allen Drury's novel. Witnessing Wilberforce's ultimate triumph left me nearly breathless.

Costume dramas usually leave me yawning, but not this time. Production designer Charles Wood's painstakingly researched and designed sets lends the movie period authenticity, while Remi Adefarasin's factual cinematography downplays idiosyncratic camera angles and lets the actors and the settings predominate. Writer Steven Knight and director Apted's deft balance of gravitas and levity give the whole business a timeless feel befitting its hero's stature, but without clumsy signposting.

The only drawback, I felt, was that Albert Finney, in an otherwise bravura performance, seemed underused--especially considering his pivotal role as John Newton, the former slave-ship captain who later repented and penned the moving hymn for which the film is named. While the scenes depicting his influence on Wilberforce were succinct and heartrending, they also felt somewhat truncated.

Amazing Grace, whose release was timed to coincide with the 200th anniversary of Wilberforce's legislative victory, February 23, 1807, has been well received by faithful and secular, conservative and liberal. Still, it generated some criticism on the pages of the Wall Street Journal, where guest columnist Charlotte Allen found a ""cover-up"" of Wilberforce's evangelical Christianity. But the film was not about his religious motives per se; it was about his campaign to end slavery. I think she missed the forest for the trees: The slave-trade abolition was Wilberforce's apotheosis, and that is exactly what Apted put up on the screen.

In a recent interview, producer Patricia Heaton (herself an outspoken, religiously motivated opponent of abortion) described Amazing Grace as an inspiring biography of ""the Abraham Lincoln of England"" and as an antidote to our ""age of such cynicism and despair, particularly about politics and religion.""

I agree. William Wilberforce is historically significant for his courageous actions in stopping an inhuman evil. While religion played no small part in motivating those actions, I really doubt that so many talented people would have assembled such an unabashed labor of love as this movie had Wilberforce decided to spend his days contemplating God's grandeur, while ignoring his own potential for personal greatness.",1189814400,16,8867,5.347919655667145

(Did you know?  The historically black college Wilberforce College was named after William Wilberforce.  Also, anyone who has read Olaudah Equiano's slave narrative will find that the two men were contemporaries; Equiano is brilliantly portrayed in this movie, too.)
