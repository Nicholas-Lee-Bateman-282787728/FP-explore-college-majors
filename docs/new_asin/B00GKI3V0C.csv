8624065,1,B00GKI3V0C,"Stanley Farmer (Charlie Floyd) fancies himself a reality film maker which means he films stuff and hopes people will like it. He runs an ad in the paper to cast people. He interviews people about being tortured in a basement and then he proceeds to do so, except the low budget prevents us from seeing any real torture. The whole budget was spent on fake body parts for the last scene. The monotone drone of Stanly put me to sleep as the torture aspect wasn't there, i.e. fails as torture porn. His goal was to film real horror, which didn't make much of a movie. Lacks entertainment.

Guide: F-bomb. No sex or nudity. Not even with the tied up Asian chick.",1445731200,,657,4.429752066115703
8624066,4,B00GKI3V0C,"This is not just a horror movie, but also a clever and creepy look at how people will believe almost anything to make it in show business. I laughed out loud as the characters' blind ambitions led them astray.  Spooky imagery also adds to the unsettling ambiance, which at times is startling and wince inducing.  It was a lot of fun to watch with a group of my friends.  The right mixes of shock, mock and schlock. It's the way I like my horror flicks!",1395532800,,452,4.294117647058823
8624067,5,B00GKI3V0C,"With so many similar plots in so many thrillers, this film takes the traditional out of horror.  To be completely honest, this is not your typical horror film, but more of a satire thriller.  Without giving too much away, this is a story about a calculated home invasion, where the basement becomes a venue for unsuspecting actors final debut.  The camera work gives you the pseudo-documentary feel and reminds you that the star of the movie is shooting this film.  Speaking of which, Stan is one of those diabolical characters that you can't help but want to know what he has in store for the aspiring, yet nave, thespians.",1393891200,,624,4.697247706422019
8624068,5,B00GKI3V0C,This was a really great surprise. It has great scares and intelligent writing. It's a fun horror/black comedy that I really enjoyed.,1393891200,,132,5.045454545454546
8624069,2,B00GKI3V0C,Dumb but quirky shaky-cam horror comedy about a psychotic Brit in New York who makes a low-budget horror film by inviting aspiring actors over to his home (sort of) to audition for a horror movie called Do You Like My Basement? which involves people spending a night in a basement for a thousand dollar reward but bad things happen to them before they ever get to collect the money.  When he brings his actors down to the basement to film--guess what?  Bad things happen to them.  Some of the encounters with the would-be actors are mildly amusing but this never works at all as a horror film--the movie always cuts away before anything really bad happens because it wants to keep you guessing as to whether the actors are really being killed or if what we see is part of the director's unconventional filming process.  Unfortunately the pay-off is lame and definitely not worth the wait.,1390348800,,888,4.673076923076923
