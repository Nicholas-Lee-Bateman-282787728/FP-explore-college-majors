5921087,5,B00EJ9OGGW,"This is the closest we get to a Christmas album by this incredible tenor.  The emotion put into every piece draws the listener in.  It has been a long wait for the recording from theMormon Tabernacle Choir, but well worth it!  Great bonus interview with Alfie included.",1385683200,,269,4.680851063829787
5921088,5,B00EJ9OGGW,"The music really blesses me, and I love the singing of Alfie Boe.  Every time I hear ""Bring Him Home"", it brings me to tears. The rest of the DVD is really wonderful as well.",1384905600,,174,3.9714285714285715
5921089,5,B00EJ9OGGW,"I took two of my children to see this concert last year. Going in, they were interested only in Alfie Boe, whom they had seen in the 25th anniversary concert of Les Miserables, but were willing to sit through the choir and Tom Brokaw. Coming out, they were raving about the entire concert: the dancing, the choir's singing, the humorous organ solo, and Tom Brokaw's presentation, which excited them as much as Alfie Boe's singing.

As for myself, I had already planned to enjoy the concert, but the performances took by storm even my high expectations.",1383696000,9,552,4.75
5921090,5,B00EJ9OGGW,"This DVD will definitely get you into the holiday spirit!  This DVD signifies the holidays, with an array of joyful music from the Mormon Tabernacle Choir, a toe-tapping organ solo, soul-stirring songs from Alfie Boe including the song that made him famous, ""Bring Him Home"", and a heartwarming World War II story about giving...narrated by American icon, Tom Brokaw.  This isn't a fast-paced show...It's just a relaxing, spectacular performance that is perfect to watch while you're wrapped up in a blanket with a warm cup of tea on a snowy night.",1383436800,7,548,5.010989010989011
5921091,5,B00EJ9OGGW,"Like many Americans, I consider the Mormon Tabernacle Choir a national treasure.  I've enjoyed their Christmas concerts for years and this is one of the best I've ever seen.  Alfie Boe is a phenomenal talent.  The WWII story is a touching example of the goodness we hopefully all aspire to demonstrate, having Tom Brokaw give voice to the story was perfect.  If you enjoy Christmas, Les Mis or WWII stories--you won't be disappointed.  It is always great to have it end with a reading of Luke 2 and Angels from the Realms of Glory.  I will enjoy it for years to come.  Merry Christmas!!  Thank you to all involved for the glorious gift!!",1382054400,12,637,4.575221238938053
5921092,5,B00EJ9OGGW,Really awesome and uplifting.  The salute to the WW2 soldiers brought tears to your eyes.,1419292800,,89,4.933333333333334
5921093,5,B00EJ9OGGW,"There is nothing that compares to a Christmas celebration as the Mormon Tabernacle Choir with their special guests.  This production starred and I mean starred Alfie Boe.  It is so grand, and spiritually moving and hand clapping experience.  Seeing Hal Halvorsen (candy bomber) as his story is related as the one airman who instigated the dropping of candy to the German children ( who were on the wrong side of the fences) during the Berlin Airlift following WW11.

Alfie Boe's voice is so strong and then backed by the Choir and Orchestra is magnificent.  I highly recommend it. You will watch it over and over.",1418256000,,613,4.8
5921094,5,B00EJ9OGGW,"I agree with the many reviews of this incredible program. As usual the MTC is outstanding and so is the Orchestra. Alfie Boe is incredible. Tom Brokaw narrarates the story of the ""Candy Bomber"" in 1948 post war Germany. I am not going to say more because I don't want to spoil the surprise. It brought me to tears. God Bless ""Hal"" Halverson. Merry Christmas",1417305600,,357,4.507692307692308

5921099,3,B00EJ9OGGW,Content is wonderful. We purchased one and it had a glitch in the DVD near the end and sent it back. We then ordered another and it had the same glitch in it so it has to be in the original. We kept this one because we like the content and are able to get by the glitch by restarting.,1393286400,,284,3.75
5921100,5,B00EJ9OGGW,We watched this DVD by the Mormon Tabernacle Choir and the Orchestra at Temple Square and fell instantly in love with Christmas all over again. We put it away with all the Christmas treasures and will pull it out again each Christmas season.,1392940800,,241,4.627906976744186

5921102,3,B00EJ9OGGW,"The DVD I ordered was sort of represented by a clip which I presumed to be ON this DVD.  Is NOT.

Good news is when I posted the error to Amazon, they with out question, refunded the price in full.

THIS is great Customer Service",1391904000,,229,4.044444444444444
5921103,5,B00EJ9OGGW,"This is one of the best DVD's ever.  I have been collecting the Christmas DVD's for the past 5 years and enjoy them all, but this one is so very good.  Alfie Boe's rendition of ""Bring Them Home"" is a tear-jerker and probably the best version on the scene today.  So many warm and tender memories evoked from this magnificent DVD.  I shall treasure it always.",1390867200,2,358,4.378787878787879
5921104,5,B00EJ9OGGW,Does it get any better than the Mormon Tabernacle Choir?  I was present for this performance in December of 2012 and could hardly wait to order the DVD.  The Berlin Airlift segment is the most moving aspect of the program.  Prepare to be inspired by the surprise ending of that segment.,1390780800,,286,4.568627450980392
5921105,5,B00EJ9OGGW,This is the 4th or 5th DVD/CD we've bought of the annual Tabernacle Choir Christmas concerts. Every one of them has been extremely well done and an artful masterpiece. Couldn't be happier with them!,1390608000,,198,4.852941176470588
5921106,5,B00EJ9OGGW,Loved this DVD one of the best they have done ever for Christmas.  Alfie Boe is such a wonderful performer.,1389657600,,107,4.35

5921108,5,B00EJ9OGGW,I buy these Christmas programs every year and they are a wonderful inspiration.  They get me in the mood for Christmas and I love to watch them again and again.,1388793600,,160,4.333333333333333
5921109,5,B00EJ9OGGW,"A tremendous production with wonderful singing and a great story of the Berlin ""candy bomber"".  This really helped me get into the spirit of Christmas.",1388275200,,151,5.04
5921110,5,B00EJ9OGGW,A most excellent program! I would recommend it to anyone. The quality of the recording was excellent. I love good Christmas programs!,1387756800,,133,5.090909090909091
5921111,5,B00EJ9OGGW,"We have a library of the Mormon Tabernacle Christmas specials.  Though we have enjoyed all so far, this was, in our opinion, one of the best.  The music choices, the dancing, the singing, and the stories made it a very enjoyable program.  We are now in the holiday spirit and ready for Christmas.  We would like to thank the Mormon Tabernacle organization and the artists that performed with the choir for creating such a wonderful holiday experience.  We will be watching this DVD to celebrate Christmas seasons to come.",1387152000,,521,4.808988764044944
5921112,4,B00EJ9OGGW,I would have loved to have more of Alfie Boe singing.  That is the only thing that drops this from a 5.  The choir was lovely but Alfie was what I was buying it for.  The story that Tom Brokaw told with the old soldier who gave out candy was pleasant and heart warming but that too I could have done without.,1387152000,,308,3.935483870967742
5921113,5,B00EJ9OGGW,It was amazing as they all are!  Alfie Boe's rendition of Bring Him Home is one of my all time favorite songs!,1387152000,,110,4.0
5921114,5,B00EJ9OGGW,"This is the best by far of the traditional Christmas concerts put on by the Mormon Tabernacle Choir each year. Alfie Boe has the voice of an angel, but ""Les Mis"" fans know this. And yes, he does sing ""Bring Him Home."" Tom Brokaw also gives an emotional reading of the story of the Berlin Candy Bomber and his efforts to drop candy over Germany after the war. What a surprise when the bomber takes the stage at the age of 92. A good blend of traditional carols and lighter modern fare, this is a concert for all.",1387152000,,511,4.224489795918367
5921115,5,B00EJ9OGGW,"a wonderful collection to be played every year, along with others, at Christmas.  The Mormon Tabernacle Choir and featured guests are the best in music and song - uplifting and inspiring.",1387065600,,187,5.032258064516129
5921116,5,B00EJ9OGGW,"This years concert featured Lt. Hal Halvorson, the REAL Candy Bomber from WWII and the story was told by famed journalist, Tom Brokaw.  Vocals from Alfe Boe, who plays Jean Valjean in Les Miserable adds his handsome tenor to the voices of the Mormon Tabernacle Choir and the Orchestra at Temple Square.  There was fun dance numbers and the best part of allwas when they dropped, quite literally, a surprise on all the guests!  It gave me chills and brought tears to my eyes.
My kids' favorite part?  The organ solo!  Sleigh Ride by Richard Elliott was incredible!  He played all the parts, by himself  such a treat!",1386633600,,615,4.638888888888889
5921117,5,B00EJ9OGGW,"Each year the Mormon Tabernacle Choir puts on a performance for the Christmas season.  Each year it is beautifully done.  This particular performance was from Christmas 2012 and is now available for everyone to enjoy, rather than just the live audience who were present for the original performance.

There is a magical quality for me when viewing the DVD or listening to the CD.  The choir is well know for quality music.  It adds many levels to the performance when they add a guest performer.  Alfie Boe has a beautiful voice.  I loved to hear him perform in this concert.

For me an added bonus was the feature of ""Christmas From Heaven"".  I recently reviewed that book and accompanying DVD on my blog.  It is truly stunning.  This is perfect for music lovers who revel in Christmas performances.",1386460800,,800,4.72463768115942
5921118,5,B00EJ9OGGW,This is a great Christmas album.  The MTC has a great sound and to add Alfie Boe as a guest artist - magnificent.  Tom Brokaw's rendering of the candy bomber story is touching and the tech people at the MTC did an outstanding job in supporting the story.  It was magical.,1386374400,,271,4.2745098039215685
5921119,5,B00EJ9OGGW,"great for the Christmas season ... loved the music as well as the story of the candy bomber
Alfie Boe sings his signature song [from Les Miz]",1386115200,2,141,4.2592592592592595
5921120,5,B00EJ9OGGW,"One of my favorite things about Christmas is the beautiful music that I get to hear.  And the Mormon Tabernacle Choir Christmas Choir DVD release is at the top of that list.  Last year's concert had Alfie Boe and Tom Brokaw as guests. I'm not sure what to say except that it is wonderful as it is every year. I marvel at the amazing choir, the talented guests, dancers, bell ringers, and orchestra.  The music is beautifully arranged and performed.  The costumes are gorgeous and decorations stunning. As is usual, there were several numbers that I hadn't heard before.  It's nice how they choose both well known favorites as well as lesser known but just as beautiful pieces as well. And the organ solo is mind boggling. I think my favorite number this time is ""Bring Him Home"" sung by Alfie Boe from Les Miserables. It just gave me chills. Highly recommended for those who love beautiful Christmas music.",1386028800,,906,4.672955974842767

8605973,3,B00EJ9OGGW,"Loved Alfie but the night we went it felt like Tom Brokaw was simply going through the motions and couldn't wait to get out of this ""gig"". Thank goodness the candy bomber made up for Tom's unenthusiastic performance.",1481414400,,216,4.7105263157894735

8605977,5,B00EJ9OGGW,"This is an amazing show that I saw on the public broadcasting system so I ordered this DVD. The story that Tom Brokaw tells is a true story of
a pilot that did some amazing things for some German Children during a war.  It was a very heartwarming story to hear at Christmas time.  The
music is wonderful!",1422057600,,304,4.224137931034483
