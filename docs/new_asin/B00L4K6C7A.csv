8694390,4,B00L4K6C7A,"Now for those who don't already know, Pro Wrestling Guerrera (P.W.G.) is a promotion based out of southern California who holds events monthly/bi-monthly that feature local independent wrestlers along with some names who work for other promotions as well like Ring Of Honor, DragonGate, Evolve, and Championship Wrestling From Hollywood.

PWG Champion Adam Cole once again defended his championship against his former Future Shock partner Kyle O'Reilly in a ""Submission Or Knockout Only"" match that started off with the best Power Ranger reference I've ever heard in wrestling followed by both men heavily singling out a body part throughout the match with various submission combinations while also going for the knockout with strong strikes to the point where one man had his eye swollen as you literally saw both men beat on each other in exhaustion.  Mount Rushmore members Kevin Steen & Young Bucks competed in a six man tag against Cedric Alexander & Trevor Lee & Johnny Gargano that saw Steen & Alexander trying to get at each other before the bell with both teams trading fist & bodies flying all over the place in the opening minutes as this match had tons of fast paced action with one big move after another along with double & triple teaming from both sides resulting in the announcers saying ""Holy..."" more than once.  Best Friends (Chuck Taylor & Trent?) took on The World's Cutest Tag Team (Joey Ryan & Candice LaRae) in #1 contendors match for the tag team championship where it was clear Best Friends were uncomforable wrestling Candice to the point where they were apoligising to her to the point where they resorted to a tactic that had Kevin Steen on commentary reference Nicole Bass of all people.  Other matches include Brian Cage vs. Roderick Strong that started off intense & high impact from the start resulting on one man having their nose bleeding in the opening minute, Rich Swann vs. A.R. Fox that saw not just a heavy mix of athleticism & high flying by both men & impactful DDT's that landed both men directly on top of their heads but also put Ryback over more than his last year in WWE, Ricochet vs. A.C.H. in another match that showcased athleticism & high flying ability along with unique showboating from both men, and the battle of the Forever Hooligans with Rocky Romero vs. Alex Kozlov.

I've always said you can never go wrong with a P.W.G. event & this was no exception with the only downfall being that the show was shorter than how long their events usually go but it was still a quality event that I would recommend.",1405900800,,2560,4.782805429864253
