However, I think the movie is an improved depiction of the various possible scenarios regarding the meeting in 1941 between the two physicists Werner Heisenbeg  and his mentor, Niels Bohr in Nazi-occupied Copenhagen.  No one really knows the reason why Heisenberg requested a meeting with Bohr.  It remains a scientific mystery to this day.  Because Heisenberg was in charge of the Nazi's atomic/nuclear program, the real reason is all the more intriguing.  The movie does an excellent job of presenting Heisenberg's possible intentions for meeting with Bohr as well as examines how one can never truly be sure of the moral motivations of any individual regardless of how close the association with them.  Great performances by both Daniel Craig and Stephen Rea are ""frosting on the cake"". Also, the scientific speculations and discussions between the two men are both very engaging and informative in layman's terms for those interested in science/Physics. I bought the VHS because the DVD was very pricey and am very happy with it.  Definitely worth the money!",1391731200,,1215,5.03
