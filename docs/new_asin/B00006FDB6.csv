1745127,5,B00006FDB6,David Mamet always delivers I have wanted to see this a very long time due to its limited release.  Actors are wonderful as always.,1360972800,,131,4.458333333333333
1745128,2,B00006FDB6,"For the names that are in it I expected a lot more than what I got. This movie gives the false image that lake boat sailors are lazy, drunk, foul mouthed and in several cases severely mentaly ill. I guess as a former great lakes sailor I found the movie offensive. I don't know where the writer got these ideas but it wasn't on any boat I worked on! P.S. The movie would be a lot better if it had a plot!",1220918400,3,404,3.9390243902439024
1745129,5,B00006FDB6,"You enter this closed world aboard an almost phantom ship like secret corners of life composed of solitude, memory, inner yearnings and the desire to be remembered even if only for having imparted the trick of removing fingerprints from stainless steel.
The offerings of some part of themselves to take to another life of which they know nothing to someone who listened, who said yes, or I understand, the romantized stories about a missing crew member of this back and forth across the lake of people embedded in lives they unendlingly explain in the gestures that compose their lives is haunting, touching and often pure poetry.
The actors are breath-taking and the directing so beautifully done as to be almost invisible.
I love this film.",1196812800,6,742,4.944
1745130,3,B00006FDB6,"Re the DVD itself, not the film:

* Pan and scan only

* No close captioning

* Subtitles in Spanish only

Great movie, not the best DVD.",1111536000,6,137,3.962962962962963
1745131,4,B00006FDB6,"This is a guys movie about men teaching a grad college student about men's lives.  They do it by association and without lecturing or posturing.  Tough language in places, but it is how a lot of guys talk. Same idea as Duvall and Caine teaching the kid in ""Second Hand Lions"", except the 'student' was younger there.  I enjoyed this movie a lot.  Good acting and quite subtle for all the cursing.  By the way, Jack Wallace, who initiates the funny Steven Seagal discussion, played Seagal's uncle in ""Above the Law.""",1093564800,3,515,4.615384615384615
1745132,4,B00006FDB6,"For David Mamet fans, dialogue over special effects fans, fans of charming humor and people intertesed in a view of men without women...this is a quality film. Even for people who aren't fans of any of those things, but open to good acting and even bizarre, absurd conversations, funny non-sequitors. There are three great scenes: One from Jack Wallace as Fred, describing his introduction into the battle of the sexes, another between Jack Wallace and J.J. Johnston about Steven Seagal, and Robert Forster's tour de force monologue towards the end.",1048377600,5,549,5.111111111111111
1745133,5,B00006FDB6,"I couldn't disagree more with previous review.
I enjoyed this film very much. There is a great story about a college student who ships out for the summer aboard an ore carrier on Lake Michigan.
The crew members he meets, and learns life lessons from are wonderful cast of real ""characters"" played by some great actors.
The reoccuring story about what really happened to the missing crew member is fun as well.
Not and action packed film, but a great addition to any David Mamet film collection.
By the way Ebert gave this film 3 stars. And wished this film had been made at the time he taught a class on Mamet and his films.",1043625600,14,624,4.434782608695652
1745134,3,B00006FDB6,"Setting: a slowly moving boat and its crew with a young boy  from a college to have a part-time job among them.  Script: written by David Mamet for stage, now adapted for movie.  Plot: almost nothing.
This is the shortest way to describle this film, but as  enthusiastic Mamet fans (which I am not) would claim, the film's charm does not lie in the conventional story; it is a series of energetic and peculiarly funny dialogue filled with humanity between colorful characters that interests and amuses you, and this time first-time director Joe Mantegna does justice to its original merit (my favorite is rather silly discussion about Steven Seagal).  During the film, nothing spectacular happens.  No ""Perfect Storm,"" no ""Poseidon Adventure.""  What you see (or hear) is the portrayals of the mostly veteran crew which consist of reliable cast long familiar to movie fans.  The old boat glides slowly on water, just like the life of the crew.
So, ""Lakeboat"" belongs to the groups of films like ""Glengarry Glen Ross"" and ""American Buffalo"" both adapted for movie from Mamet's stage play.  It is heavily dialogue-driven, but without intense exchange of acting between heavy-weight actors of ""Glengarry,"" which is perhaps better made than this one.  As far as ""Lakeboat"" goes, in my opinion, casting Tony Mamet (brother to David, and one of the producers of the film) into a key role of a youth in ""Lakeboat"" is a mistake, I am afraid; frankly, he is not up to working with the caliber of the veteran cast such as  Durning, Forster, and Falk.  And the moviemakers should have reconsidered the idea of the unbilled Andy Garcia character (he appears only in flashback scenes), which does not simply work.  However, Robert Forster (deservedly Oscar-nominated for his acting in ""Jackie Brown"") compensates for these, with his extremely humane, warm performance.  When he recollects his dream of becoming a ballet dancer before young Dale; or when he remembers he considered of committing suicide, the film turns a little jem.  ""Lakeboat"" is worth watching just for him.
As a whole, just like ""American Buffalo,"" ""Lakeboat"" is a very stagy film, and that is the point our tastes differ.  If you think movie is a thing to move on, you should forget it.  But if you are willing to pay some money to see good acting from  skilled actors, and Mamet's rough, but intriguing dialogue, watch it.  It is strange but even after watching it, you might feel the boat is still going on somewhere around Michigan.  The film is so true-to-life.",1011484800,9,2522,4.889411764705883
7967497,5,B00006FDB6,"I love the jazz music.how could you not love a movie with such good taste in jazz... you have many famous people talking...older men talking and the young writer leaqrning. basically it's people talking on a giant ship and eating egg salad sandwiches. and my favorite,Columbo....then you have the humor of Denis Leary.his job is sitting and watching buttons for 4 hours.",1522972800,,370,4.983870967741935
7967498,3,B00006FDB6,"It has quite a few actors you've seen before, and it's interesting to see it filmed on a Great Lakes freighter. But other than that it doesn't offer much. There isn't really a story, just a lot of talking. Based on a play and it shows.",1509408000,,235,4.130434782608695

7967503,5,B00006FDB6,"Writer David Mamet and director Joe Mantegna deliver a simple, dialogue-driven story about men working on a great lakes freighter that examines male relationships, angst, depression and unrealized hopes and dreams. Mamet, known for his sharp, sometimes vulgar dialogue from plays and films such as ""Glengarry Glenross,"" once again scripts interesting dialogue that is poignant and at at times humorous while also providing an insight into each unique characters' back-story and personal demons.

7967504,5,B00006FDB6,"David Mamet likes dialogue -- and the dialogue here is WONDERFUL.  A bright college kid (played by Mamet's son) spends a summer on a Great Lakes freighter and talks with the seasoned freshwater sailors.  A small, cleverly revealed mystery unfolds as the movie rolls along -- but that is very much a sideshow. This is a movie for lovers of language.",1398902400,,348,4.688524590163935
7967505,4,B00006FDB6,"This is a movie without any particular plot, but rather one that concentrates on the proletarian merchant marine sailors who figure in it. A Jewish graduate student in the University of Massachusetts (my Alma Mater, but not the Amherst campus which the film suggests) works for the summer on a freighter (too big to be a ""boat"") and gets used to the rough and somewhat daft ways of the ship's sailors, most of them notably older (indeed quite a lot older) than he is. One can see him growing more accustomed to such life and blending in, as the months pass, with his shipmates on the rusty old vessel.

The dialogue is mostly trivial or of the ""shaggy dog"" story variety. The sailors recount, each with his ""take"" on one of their lusty shipmates, Guigliani, younger, more physically fit, and sexier than any of the others, about whom all tell tales of his boozing, brawling, and consorting with loose women, including one about an unfortunate encounter with a prostitute in a back alley that has an amusing number of contradictory variants. Guigliani has missed the departure of his ship, so the sailors are free to say whatever they want about him without fear of immediate contradiction. At film's end, there he is, Guigliani himself, abrubtly leaving a sleazy, worn, alcoholic bar-fly (who is not at all of the luscious calibre that the crew's stories describe in their accounts of his picaresque doings) at last to come back to rejoin his crewmates just as the student leaves to return to university for the fall semester. (The segments about Guigliani's onshore adventures are in b&w, the film elsewhere being in colour.)

Having been a sailor only in military life at sea (U.S. Navy), on a Second World War vintage destroyer (thus a small warship, at that), I cannot vouch for how authentic the freighter featured, the Seaway Queen, really is. I only rarely have had the opportunity to board and view merchant ships of the kind, those that ply the Saint-Laurent River on their way to the Great Lakes or which sail the Atlantic Ocean. However, I would be surprised if the living quarters on a ship like the Seaway Queen would be so spacious and relatively comfortable, albeit plain and unadorned, or that the engine room of such a large vessel would be so small-scale. A ship of the name was used in making the film, so I would suppose that I likely could be wrong about that!

The movie is about character, atmosphere, sailors' humour, and it succeeds in its aims, with a minimum of ""real action"". The music for it is sophisticated and of high quality, late swing music, vocals heavy, of the type so successful in the 1940s through late 1950s. The DVD edition (T,V,A, Films 00020, two-sided, one in English, the other in French) which I acquired has no special features or subtitles, but such assets vary with other editions available.",1397779200,,2841,4.746963562753036
7967506,5,B00006FDB6,take a look at the cast and writer and you can see it is packed with talent. I enjoyed this movie and watched it many times.,1365033600,,124,3.8076923076923075
