2605349,5,B000GEAMD0,"A different take on the zombie genre. Romero is amazing, he is a pioneer in horror. Camera work is much better than Cloverfield. Disregard the person who wrote the 1 star rating, he is very ignorant.",1206748800,5,199,4.555555555555555
2605350,1,B000GEAMD0,"George Romero is a hack.

Or: The Dead Walk. I snore.

""Diary of the Dead"" is absolutely about the Dead getting up and walking around: it's true, it's amazing George Romero can even lift a camera, let alone have the audacity to slap something this slipshod, this mediocre, this stupefyingly dull together. Here's a hint George: time to hang up the cam and spend those royalties on a nice tropical timeshare and mebbe a pair of decent glasses. Not those giganto loopy things you've been wearing since ""Night"". It's affected your vision, in every sense of the word.

If you really wanna see a zombie flick where about 95% of the run-time is spent with obnoxious community college types going on and on (and my God! on and on) about the meaning of blogging---I'm not making this up!---and cinema, and the reality of media, and the reality of reality---this is your flick. If you wanna see an engaging, visceral, shiggola kicking zombie film, stay away.

""Diahrea of the Dead"" is Romero doing his zombie thing by way of the ""Blair Witch Project"": student filmmakers scoring a mummy flick when Earth passes through a meteor shower, or the Arrowhead Project gets all outta whack, or the Illuminati raise Nixon from the dead and he starts really taking a bite outta crime. Whatever.

The premise is that one talky student (the pretentious Joshua Close, who 'plays' Jason, who...forget it, who can't act, even describing this thing is making me groggy) and his crew of derelicts, misfits, social morons, and college student apes, are shooting their crappy little film when the recently dead start hankering for human canapes. Chaos ensues. Or does it?

1)""Diary"" cuts its own throat: you can have instant, on the spot realism, or you can have a typical studio film. You can't have it both ways. ""Diary"" doesn't trust its audience, and why should it? So even though we've got a handicam film, it's got background music. The chick narrator (see below) says she edited that stuff in to 'scare us'. Yeah. We're viewing a flick about the zombie holocaust, and we need bad synethesizer tunes to get creeped out.

2) Irritating Chick Monologue: Jason's squeeze is ""Debra"", played by Michelle Morgan, who, with her big puppy-dog eyes and nice cheekbones and raven waves of cascading black hair and taut little nubile muscles and toned up thighs and arms and....where was I? Oh yeah, she's easy on the eyes. But I've seen autistics who were better actors. She does voiceovers. Constantly. Voiceovers that make you want to cringe, as in: ""we were all in this dark corridor of meaningless violence together, the camera showing us what was real, only because it was a camera, it wasn't real, and so we weren't really real.""

Yeah, babe. Make me a pie. And then vamoose: Ridley Scott's ""Blade Runner"" was a visionary masterwork in spite of Harrison's lame narration. ""Diary"" sucks, but it sucked worse because you opened your mouth. And not in a useful way, dig?

3)ATTACK OF THE 80 FOOT CAMERAMEN! having a guy hoist a camera and film throughout a zombie apocalypse is hugely silly. Rotting folks are trying to make you their power lunch: you gonna keep filming? The only way to get us to suspend our disbelief is not to dwell on it overmuch---the way ""Blairw itch"" did it, or the way ""Cloverfield"" did it. The camera, then, becomes our own eyes, as opposed to an intrusive screen or barrier to the story unfolding before us.

Romero's cam is artless, distracting, and constantly takes me out of what might have been scary or worked. Worse still, when you have a mini zombie rampage in a hospital, and the Zombies are really working it, you know, working it to make chicken McNuggets out of the actors, and you've got about 3 people shooting videotape while everyone else is wigging out----well, it's funny. Funny not ha-ha. Funny Liberace. Dig?

4)Zero Scares. Every time romero starts playing around with an idea that might be cool & nasty (the dead guy in the warehouse hide n seek, or the rampage in the fortified mansion, all covered room to room by this creepy dead-eye surveillance camera) he immediately deep sixes it to return to monologue babe (Morgan). Yeah, she's a hot chick, but she can't act her way out of a paper sack. Every time we get a quease inducing idea (Mummy boy!) we gotta talk about blogging. Or the Internet. Or the Media. Or Global Warming. You're getting sleeeeeeep-ier, or I am.

5) the mummy scene actually worked. Phil Riccio, who played the wicked, doomed socialite Ridley Wilmott, did what he could to make this flatline flick amusing. Thanks Phil!

Oh, and the pool zombies (what we saw of them) were fun. Seriously. Maybe sticking to the mansion the whole film through might have been more fun and given things a nasty ""Resident Evil"" vibe. Same with the Warehouse thing: you got a buncha brothas together, and they're all hardcore, you know, all Harrisburg PA and all, and they get to do NOTHING. Zero. Bummer.

6) not enough of the talky annoying people die. Big bummer.

7) not enough guts by far.

""Diary of the Dead"" is pretty much a diary by way of King Louis XVI, last King of France (who did his own undead shuffle by way of the Guillotine), who wrote in his diary on Bastille Day (when Paris's infamous political prison was obliterated by Jacobins) ""Nothing Happened Today"".

Serve that up as an epitaph for ""Diary"" and bury this corpse.

2605351,4,B000GEAMD0,"UPDATE TO MY EARLIER PRE-REVIEW BELOW.

Change my vote to two (2) stars !
Having now had the chance to see the finished product, I must say this feels nothing like a Romero film.

This movie simply lacks all of his trademark elements and may well mark the end of this franchise........ going out with a whimper, not a bang.

This is the first Romero film we will not be adding to our DVD collection.

I am almost suspicious that he had nothing to really do with this movie but just but his name on it for a big royalty because it really is very, very flat and feels like somebody trying to cop his style but failing.

ORIGINAL PRE-REVIEW
I have tentatively given this film a 4 stars based only on a years worth of preview clips........
YOU MEAN THIS FILM FINALLY GOT RELEASED ???

I was trying to keep track on the progress of this film for over 2 years... then suddenly it gets ""released"" (if the word applies here).... and comes and goes before I heard a word about it.

This was really getting alot of excitement and hype then the buzz died faster than a zombie !!

I guess we will see the DVD in the next 30 days or so.

Yikes.... this never even showed up on the radar it seems.",1206403200,5,1183,4.199115044247788
2605352,4,B000GEAMD0,"Thank you George A. Romero! After the last futuristic vision of the Zombie apocalypse on earth, the great action-horror packed, with incredibly creepy-atmosphere, but too zombie-concerned ""Land of the Dead"", the master finally  finished or ended his previous ""living dead"" series with extreme prejudice: Knowing that his last major production hitted rock bottom in every possible aspect one can refer to, he Re-started his beloved saga from point  zero in an original revision to his first classic masterpiece, ""Night of the Living Dead"". The only two factors in this movie that could cloud our vision about some controversial ""usual"" issues, is our pre-judgement product of having witnessed in the flesh and at the time, the continuity and evolution of this major classic series, and the obvious aproach of the film for today's standards. For newcomers, this will be fantastic. I  know, cause i felt like one: Wow, talking about some fresh air! I believed that the next Romero's movie would explain the reason why the dead walk..... Pheeww!!!!!

No more sequels people, this is a pure revision of the zombie mythology in a great new concept, absolutely teenage oriented like every ""re-born"" horror saga or re-make fashion these days, of course . I didn't say original, cause after all, the filmaking style is based on other succesful but used concepts like ""the blair witch project"" or even the fresh-but-awful re-make of ""the texas chainsaw massacre"". The new horror industry still rules despite Romero's ideas, don't ever forget that, in order to forgive some anoying issues that he must be aware about too. Anyway, the story is simple, straight-forward but effective, with outstanding tale development for a horror movie, even for Romero: A student filmaker is setting out to shoot a low-budget film in the Pensylvania woods, some kind of amateur production about mummies, along with some friends in what you could describe as a funny adventure. All well, untill the media reports starts talking about dead people rising from their graves and attacking human beings. The unbelievable horror they witness unchain the devastating struggle to remain calm and sane, and then run to seek shelter without any logical explanation for the horrible nightmare unleashed before their eyes.

Instead of filming a hilarious monster home-made film, our student end up capturing the breakdown of modern society under the ravaging hordes of  flesh-eating re-animated corpses. The story of  survival under such new, menacing, tense, and creepy circumstances reminded me of  the first ""Night of the living dead"", with the media reports, the panic, the claustrophobic ambient and the desperate will to overcome and survive this nightmare no matter what. It's actually easy to compenetrate with the escence of this dark and gruesome hell-on-earth story, it's even easier to feel the zombie apocalypse under our skin, better than any other previous Romero's zombie movie.

Of course, the zombie imagery is awesome as usual: what can i say about every take involving those gruesome creatures devouring life itself and leaving a path of despair and destruction behind them? The usual pshycological and physical effects proper of the ""they're us"" epidemic remain intact. A perfect match for such a visceral and kinetic race out of hell that is the movie itself. The filming style may disturb our concentration a bit, but this is because we're enjoying so much!

Well, two things can be happening here: Either this is the best zombie movie i've seen in years, or i'm just too glad to have Romero back in the ""right"" track! No matter what,  this is a must see for Romero's fans and for horror fans worlwide. Long life for the ""Dead""!

WARNING: Too much focus on the amateurish cam style and flaws of production, as well as prejudice towards the series or Romero, may result in a painful dead followed by the awakening as a flesh-eating ghoul. The company of an armed friend is recomended.",1206403200,8,3966,5.093990755007704
2605353,5,B000GEAMD0,"I took in Diary Of The Dead tonight, I liked it.  The audience of The 20-year-old boys around me didn't seem to like it, but I can see why. Truly it's not a zombie film, and I think Romero had little interest in making one this time around. It's much more a scathing critique of our cultures narcissism.

In a way it's a very clever device Romero uses to satirize. The conceit is that the film is this self-important, green, and not necessarily talented college student's film. It first shows the kid trying to shoot a crappy student horror film, and then he gets wind of the zombie events unfolding and decides it's his duty to document it, as he and a small crew are already are out in the universities movie-van.  So it becomes today's generation's take on the event, in their own ""I just gotta tell someone everything that happens to me"" way (Yes, I know I doing the same by writing my review of this film).

Anyone who wants just another ""Romero zombie film"" is going to be gravely disappointed, anyone who dismisses it a just a ""Blair Witch"" zombie film is missing the considerable wit and insight Romero has brought to the table. DIARY OF THE DEAD is definitely more than in seems to be at face value, I'm thinking most won't ""get it,"" but I hope some do.",1205625600,23,1262,4.4034334763948495
2605354,3,B000GEAMD0,"Seen this film in theater when it came out. I have to say it's a different zombies film. I think George Romero could of done better. But not bad to watch it atleast once. Stick with the classics Dawn of the dead, and Day of the dead, better story and more GORE!",1205280000,5,261,4.038461538461538
2605355,3,B000GEAMD0,"Diary of the Dead finally released in my hometown. Overall, it was a decent flick but I couldn't help but feel somemthing was lacking. Romero decided to film the movie with a Blair Witch/documentary type of feel and this (I felt) kind of shorted the viewer. Instead of being able to lose yourself in the story, your constantly reminded you are in fact watching a movie.

Downsides-
The movie is constantly interrupted by narrative voice-overs.
Because the group decides to bypass major populated areas, you never get to really see whats going on in the real world except for tiny news clips which you have to watch as the ""camera"" films the group watching on a tiny monitor.
As soon as the group gets a chance to access weapons not one more gunshot is fired throughout the film (LAME).
The ""camera guy's"" friends would not shut-up about him filming. Get over it already or break his camera.

Upsides-
Samuel the Amish guy totally rocked! (Diary is worth seeing just for this charecter alone).
Zombie Goldfish
A few (and sad to say I do mean few) nice zombie deaths.

  I'd have to say Dawn of the Dead is still remains my favorite and in order to be completely fair, as of now, I would have to rank ""Diary"" as my least favorite. I really wanted to be blown away but I have to admit I wasn't.

Diary of the Dead is still worth seeing especially if your a zombie or Romero fan. Just don't have your hopes up to see anything new and innovative to be added to this genre. Keep your eye out for a George Romero cameo! I give it 3.5 stars (*sigh*).",1205020800,6,1542,4.411971830985915
2605356,5,B000GEAMD0,This  starts a whole new line of Zombie movie for Romero. He keeps that same mystery surronding why and what is happening which is great. All the usual plot is still here and why not. Don't change if it works. It follows a group of coolege students filming a movie who find themselves in a world turn up side down. Well one of the filmakers decides it needs to documented and plug into the internet. This gives a different perspective for Romero and it works. The film is done from the view of the student film maker. Dont worry its not like Cloverfield where you have all the bad camera work and shaking all around. This film works on all levels. It has everything you want in a Romero film plus with a new twist. I say it a must see! I saw this one in the theater and can't wait for the DVD. Lets just hope there is a second one!!!!,1203897600,11,834,4.148148148148148
2605357,5,B000GEAMD0,"In my opinion, this is probably the best ""dead"" movie to come out since the original ""Night of the Living Dead"".  The basic plot is a group of film students from Pennsylvania and their professor are forced to go on a road trip in a Winnebago to find a safe haven in a world suddenly overrun by zombies.  While the plot sounds similar to the other ""dead"" movies, there's a fundamental shift in the ""isolated and on their own"" paradigm used previously.  Thanks to technology, the students record their experiences and share them on-line with others during their travels.  Unfortunately, their obsessive compulsion to document all their experiences results in instances the students forget that they should be participating in the events unfolding in front of them rather than acting as invisible bystanders.  Romero is big on social commentary in his movies.

Now that we've gotten the intellectual stuff out of the way, let's talk about the things most people will watch the movie for.  The zombies get dispatched in a variety of gruesome ways.  There's a lot of dark humor and a couple of references to the original ""dead"" movie (I think one of the radio broadcasts comes from the original movie).  There aren't any ""epic"" scenes probably due to the low budget, but plenty of action throughout the film.  If you like zombie movies, definitely catch this one.

P.S. Amish farmers rock!",1203120000,14,1384,4.871794871794871
2605358,3,B000GEAMD0,"Reading the video box, you may get the idea that this is a supernatural horror film.  The box says ""Some people come back to haunt you no matter how deep you bury them.""  Also: ""A tale of horror from beyond.""  Also: ""This suspense-filled horror film proves that some people come back to haunt you no matter how deep you bury them ... his mother-in-law's power extends beyond her bloody grave.""

Well, all that marketing is a lie.  This is NOT a horror film.  And NO supernatural elements.  It's a crime/suspense film.

A hen-pecked 39-year-old son-in-law plans to murder his mother-in-law.  I won't say what happens in detail, but people die.  Much of the film is about how the son-in-law must lie to cover up what happened, and then lie some more to cover up his past lies.  The lies compound as events risk the son-in-law's lies being exposed.  Will his lies be exposed?  Will he be suspected of murder?

No supernatural or horror elements are even implied.

As a suspense film, it's okay.  Low budget, but not bad.  Hector Elizondo is a sympathetic son-in-law.  Salome Jens is his sympathetic and attractive wife.  Geraldine Fitzgerald does well as the nasty mother-in-law.

But if you're seeking a supernatural horror film, you'll be disappointed.",1176422400,4,1251,4.838862559241706

2605376,4,B000GEAMD0,"It's probably the fact that this film was directed by George Romero that people don't like this film as much as they might. With Romero, father of the modern zombie genre, expectations run high, and this film doesn't reach the level of his best films. But it's still a good traditional zombie film once you get over the fact that it's not a new masterpiece. Made over two decades since Day of the Dead, I suspect he was inspired by the immediacy of the found footage genre begun by The Blair Witch Project and its potential to give everything a documentary gloss. He didn't overdo it, either by letting the whole thing become an incomprehensible shaky-cam mess. Of course it's rough in patches and cuts off at odd times, but it has to do that. You never lose sight of the narrative.  His only misstep in the new form seems to be a need to explain Jason's obsession for videotaping everything every fifteen minutes or so. We get it.

The plot is a simple journey from the woods near the University of Pittsburgh where the group of film students are making a mummy movie to a series of increasingly dangerous stops that take them to a college dorm, a hospital, an inner city warehouse, an Amish farm and an estate near Philadelphia.  The students are accompanied by their somewhat alcoholic professor who adds some cynical and humorous observations to the proceedings and who actually helps with killing zombies. Though not much is required of the actors besides not seeming scripted, they all do well and are convincing in their roles.

The zombies are of the good old Romero type  dead and slowly shambling. I much prefer these types to the ""infected"" who have taken over many of these kinds of films. Credit is often given to 28 Days Later but Romero's The Crazies was long before that. I find the slow, dead variety much more eerie and creepy. A person also has a chance against them whereas the speedy, often super-strong infected would be practically impossible to survive against, especially in groups. I understand that some people find them scarier because of their speed and strength, but in the end as one person said in an internet comment, ""Fast zombies are just angry soccer fans"".

So in any case what you have here is a good zombie movie, full of action and scares that moves along briskly in its 95 minutes, never letting up for long. The shot live on video gimmick works well with the scenario.  I find the ending a bit confused and underwhelming but I can't go into that here.",1459555200,8,2493,4.6139954853273135

Movies like Blair Witch, all the Paranormal Activities and as I mentioned The Zombie Diaries asll did it way better.  In those movies it actually seemed like real people (non-actors) in front of someone filiming them.  In Diary of the Dead the lead girl was the worst I have ever seen.  She is always looking right at the camera and her trying to act natural was extremely poor.

Normally I am fine with kind of far fetched stuff as I am all about just being entertained, but just to mention a couple weird things was
***spoiler alert***
when he went to the dorm to get his girlfriend no one was there besides her and some old dude taking a TV.  First, I highly doubt a dorm like that would have cleared out so fast and second, I highly doubt she would be all alone in the dorm and not have evacuated also.

Another part was the hosiptal.  Again.  I seriouslly doubt the place would be completely empty like that and would take a lot longer than that to evacuate, let alone no cop cars or anything.  The hospital would be a place that would be packed imo.  This is where you really see also how bad of an actress the main girl is.

Finally, they are on the road a lot and only see 1 car pass them.  1 accident of like 1 or 2 cars involved.  A few zombies on the road until they get to the farm.  The barn has 1 omish guy who is deaf.  Last I checked the omish have a lot more people than just 1 person and I highly doubt they would have left this guy alone.

So yeah, 3 stars may be giving it more than it should, but overall it was entertaining still.  Some cool stuff and not all the acting was horrible.  They were better actors then a b-horror type movie so it isn't too difficult to overlook the acting.  But I also gave it 3 because IF Romero found better actors who can do the found footage well, the movie would have been a lot better using this same script.",1420243200,,2198,4.141843971631205
2605402,5,B000GEAMD0,"I love this film, I was so happy to add it to my collection. I'm a sucker for anything with zombies in it. I have two personal categories for zombie movies. One is more on the comical side and one obviously on the serious side when they are truly into the more realism of what it would be like to be in that situation. The comedies of the undead movies being ones like Shaun of the Dead, Fido, Dance of the dead, and Zombieland ( I kinda think Zombieland fits in between the two types). More serious being all the Dawn of the Dead movies I've seen, 28 days later ( some would argue that being a zombie movie but I sum it up to be one), and this movie Diary of the dead. I find this movie to be in this group because of the fact that they play it off as a documentary and obviously they aren't going to go around looking for a Twinkie or try to gather their friends and get to a pub, they have to be oblivious to what's going on and try to find answers and figure out what to do.

2605404,3,B000GEAMD0,"Diary of the Dead (2007)
 Writer/director/producer George A. Romero is movie number five in the string of Zombie flicks by the modern master of the genre.  Romero started the modern Zombie movie industry with his brilliant Night of the Living Dead in 1968.  In this high quality version of the Zombie myth, a student film crew making a cheepie Mummy flick is out in the woods filming when the Zombie outbreak occurs.  The crew continues filming the Zombie apocalypse as a documentary so we see the movie through the lens of the student's camera as often as through the regular movie camera.  I thought this interesting in itself.  The story is pretty much standard Zombie fodder.  The kids wander around doing at first stupid things but gradually, and at the cost of the lives of several of their number, they become more Zombiewise.
 There are a couple of plot detours that are worth the side trip.  In one segment they are captured by determined, well armed people who might either help or kill them.  The survival folk are all black from the inner city which gives a jolt of social commentary to the film.  In another interlude they are helped by a deaf-mute Amish guy.
 Two cool Zombie kills are one where a Zombie has a jar of acid broken over his head.  Over a period of several minutes the acid works on him until it devolves enough of his brain to kill him.  I haven't seen that before.  In another unusual Zombie kill a bitten man who has not yet changed sticks a scythe through his own head and also through the skull of a Zombie at the same time.  Economical that is.
 Zombie fans should eventually see all of Romero's book of Zombie films.  I liked this one enough to give it a good two and a half brains.  It runs an average one hour and 32 minutes.  The film overall has good production values and cost $2 million to make.  The makeup and the fake guts and what not are well done and up to expectations.  It took in over $5 million at the box office and of course plenty more on DVD.
 Diary of the Dead has an R rating for a brief boob shot, the usual munching (which is kept within reason) and lots of very bad swearing.
 Fun Facts-  A whole mob of famous people did various voiceovers as newsreaders on TV broadcasts from time to time.  Q
Quentin Tarantino, Stephen King, Simon Pegg, Guillermo del Toro and Wes Craven all can be heard if you listen carefully.  Romero himself appears briefly as a cop doing a press conference.  Romero appears in all of his Zombie movies.

Romero does try to show the influence of YouTube on his zombie-verse, but it just falls flat.

As students are shooting a horror film for a class project, the zombie outbreak begins. The students, and their professor, pile into an RV and set out for their respective homes, or somewhere safe from the undead attack. Typical of Romero's later films, there is lots of arguing, specifically about whether Jason should continue to film their journey. They run into some more people here and there and argue some more with them, then get back on the road and continue arguing with each other. Along the way they run into zombies who manage to eat some of the students now and again.

This is a blah film, that tries way too hard to deliver it's message about society's over-exposure through social media. It should be an easy message to tell, but for some reason Romero just doesn't deliver. There is no one to like, so as the character's continue to die off, you don't really care. There is only one scene at an Amish farm that manages to build some tension, but it just feels wedged into the film as an excuse to remind us that there are zombies in the movie.

Weak film, and I almost wish Romero would quit mucking around in his own series as nothing he's put out in the last couple of decades can even come close to the first two films in this series.",1400457600,,1658,4.501661129568106

2605424,1,B000GEAMD0,"It seems that George Romero has simply lost that magic flair for making ground breaking horror films he once had. Most of his non zombie efforts through the 70's and 80's were somewhat memorable, None were truly remarkable, but good efforts. His last two most recent efforts fail simply because George Romero forgot the simple formula that made 'Night of the living dead', 'Dawn of the dead, and 'Day of the dead', so well appreciated. Those films offered some of the most shocking and terrifying sequences ever committed to film. The first two dead films in the series worked so well due to their shock value, and offered audiences a new level of fear factor and gore than had ever been seen before.

That is much of the reason those two films are classics. This latest effort covers no new ground. In fact it clearly rips off the 'Blair witch project' without shame. The idea was good, and Romero should have been able to do it well. However much of the film is dedicated to trying to convince the audience that the use of cameras by the actual characters in the film was a reasonable possibility that might very well happen in real life. The harder the film tries to justify the use of the cameras, the more ridiculous it all seems.

Some situations are so silly that I found myself saying ""Omg you have got to be kidding. No way in hell. This is so stupid"". Much of the gore is reasonably well done but under par for what we have come to expect in many recent horror films, and under par for even Romero's achievements. Never does it truly astound until the very last shot right before the credits. That was truly an astounding shot as far as gore goes. And if the entire film was filled with the same level of creative gore it would have possibly been the next step in a new direction of truly astonishing gore. Sometimes the film is so bad it's just plain stupid. But this is not the Romero that made horror films truly remarkable back in the late 60's and 70's.",1371513600,2,1968,4.448753462603878

I noted a number of undigested comments in it on the imperfection of mankind and, what I take is the chief message, that filming  the ""truth"" is worth the price one might have to pay for it, because it serves the cause of the Good, the True and the Beautiful. Too simplistic, I should think, for the average American graduate of high school (or  some higher level of education), to take seriously, stated in that unqualified manner. At any rate, I dismissed any message I could make out as an unnecessary appendage to the film.
The film,  itself, I enjoyed as a low key follow up to his earlier ones, giving a somewhat different perspective than he presented in those. He did not induce an intense sense of pain and horror, but did maintain interest in the outcome throughout. I leave it to you to read the reviews of true devotees of this kind of film to get the ""expert's"" evaluation. Speaking only as an outsider, making a foray into the genre simply for a change of pace, like chewing a bit of bread between sips at a wine tasting, to refresh the palate so as to enjoy the next (different) type of wine, I thought it worth sitting through as the second, shorter, minor, feature in an evening's double bill.",1370995200,,1330,4.438524590163935

DIARY follows a group of college students as they document their first-hand account of the zombie apocalypse using a hand-held video camera. Unfortunately, Romero gets the format entirely wrong in every conceivable way. Instead of producing an ultra-realistic nightmare as we had seen in [REC] from the same year, he gives us a poorly-staged and utterly contrived zombie bore lead by unbelievable characters and lackluster special effects.

In the first of many offenses, Romero allows his characters to edit their footage, which entails adding slow-motion effects, scene transitions, and even narration. The editor has even chosen to emphasize the scares using blaring sound effects! Romero's characters are given painfully unnatural dialog, which makes them come off as being bad actors rather than genuine people. The zombies are killed in a variety of glamorized ways that simply would not happen in a real-world survivor setting. Worst of all, the cartoon gore is comprised almost entirely by computerized effects! How does this, in any way, reflect reality? Why choose this format only to then go back and fictionalize the events? The only answer seems to lie in the editor's commentary, itself. Debra repeatedly stresses how it was impossible to discern fact from fiction with 400,000 spins on the truth available for download online. Perhaps this, too, is some elaborate prank being played by the filmmakers, calling back to the Wellesian War of the Worlds radio drama that Romero references as well? Even in that remote possibility, DIARY OF THE DEAD never displays enough intelligence to credit it as being a satire.

DIARY OF THE DEAD shows an extreme disconnect between concept and execution. Romero may have entered this project with good intentions, but the result is truly horrifying.

2605437,4,B000GEAMD0,"Diary of the Dead is the fifth entry in George Romero's famous ""of the Dead"" series. As opposed to Diary's predecessor Land, Romero takes us back to the very beginning of the zombie apocalypse. Taking place at the same time as Night of the Living Dead, a group of college students and their professor are out in the middle of no where filming a student film when the dead start waking up and attacking the living.

Unlike the prior ""Dead"" films, Diary doesn't keep our characters in a single location barricaded up but instead must survive driving across Pennsylvania in a Winnibago trying make it to safety somewhere while one character insists on filming the whole thing for a documentary.

Truth be told, between Land and Diary (I am still waiting for Survival to come in the mail so I can watch it for the first time), I'm one of the people who actually prefers Diary and enjoyed it more than Land. I enjoyed the atmosphere going on where it was like ""What's happening and what do we do?!"" and sense of urgency that I felt was missing from Land.

Unlike what the Amazon description states, this blu-ray does in fact have special features. These are commentary for the movie, character confessionals where  four of the main characters sit in front of the camera (in the bathroom?) of the Winnebago (mostly ranting and raving about nothing in particular) while throwing out little tidbits of their lives, a behind the scenes documentary set during the first week of filming, and a VERY short interview with George Romero.

Granted I haven't watched the commentary yet, but truthfully I don't think rest of the special features are anything to write home about. They might could have tried slightly better with the interview with George Romero and the ""first week"" behind-the-scenes documentary. As for the confessionals, they were okay too. Mostly it was the characters sitting there screaming at the camera though each character ""interviewed"" (Deb, Tony, Eliot, and Tracey) dropped a few pieces of information about their lives prior to the outbreak or what they were planning to do in the near future.

Like Eliot tells us that not long after they were to finish shooting the film, he was to be going on a blind date. He muses it might have been nothing or something meaningful might have come out of it. I kind of wish the others did something similar, though Tracey mentioned wanting to be an actress..

Here Romero goes the mockumentry route, & you know what? He succeeds in making his best film since ""Creepshow,"" & his best zombie film since ""Dawn of the Dead,"" & in many ways, surpassing that mall muncher.

A group of college kids are out in the woods making a horror movie. Little do they know that the undead have risen, & that they will actually make a film documenting the true horror surrounding them, as they try to survive.

""Diary of the Dead"" is a well acted & directed Zombie film. Romero's direction tends to meander in many of his other films, but here he is as straight as a stiff corpse! Same has to be said about the script, as with many of his films, the combination of bad script, bad direction, & bad acting make for a bad movie, but not here! Sharp, intelligent & intriguing, ""Diary of the Dead"" may be Romero's best Zombie script ever, if not his most visionary or original.

Truth be told, I feel that Romero is a sometime brilliant, but overall, a highly overrated director. When he is on his game, he is one of the best horror film makers out there, but more often than not, he misses the horror & makes the horrible. He was a visionary director with his ultra ground breaking (no pun intended) debut, ""Night of the Living Dead."" He made what I feel is the best horror anthology ever in ""Creepshow,"" but everything before & after just have not met those high standards. People will point to ""Dawn of the Dead"" as his classic, but it really does not hold up as well today, especially in regards to such recent films as ""28 Days Later"" & ""28 Weeks Later."" Even the ""Dawn of the Dead' remake is more potent in it's horror than the original, but it does lack the black comedy & humanity of the former.

Utilizing the ""Found Footage"" sub genre, Diary of the Dead takes us back to the early days before the Living Dead Apocalypse began, possibly the same night Ben and Barbara first encounter the Walkers.  A group of college students are out making a horror movie when they receive the first news of the dead returning to life.  The movie then documents the students as they desperately try and make it back to their families while trying not to become the next Hot Plate Special.

It's hard for me to pin point what I liked best about the movie but if I had to it would be that Romero wisely avoided any big names.  Seeing guys like Simon Baker, Asia Argento, John Lequizamo, and Dennis Hopper just took me out of the story Land of the Dead was trying to tell and reminded me that I was watching a big budget Hollywood movie.  The smaller budget allows for better character development and can play by its own rules.  And with a no name cast, we don't automatically know which star will live to see the end credits. There were some parts where I wanted the characters to drop the cameras and either run or help one of their numbers being attacked, the movie flowed at a quick pace with very little gore that doesn't get too over-the-top.

While it doesn't add anything new to the overworked Zombie genre, Diary of the Dead does make for a good late night movie or one for parties and gatherings.

Some college students are filming a movie about a mummy in the forest for a school project, they then hear the news about the dead waking up and attacking people. At this point they go their separate ways to make sure their loved ones are safe, one of them takes the camera and from here on out we are treated to seeing the action from the point of view of which ever actor is holding the camera.

This is quite a bad and cheesy flick, the acting is quite horrid (yes its a no name cast but still really bad), people do things just for seemingly no reason other than advancing the plot (i.e. a girl accidentaly runs over some people, questions if they were really dead then later shoots herself out of guilt).

There are a lot of problems here in this one, and the guy holding the camera seems so determined to get everything on film that he neglects to ever help his friends when he's in danger. There's a point where they video chat with a friend of their's, who is at a house they can be safe at, but this friend talk about not feeling his best and seems kinda shaky (gee wonder what the chances are that he's been bitten by a zombie?)

Given how the film just plods along at a snails pace, actually makes me think zombies edited and paced the movie themselves cause no sane human could've thought this was a good way to build any tension or generate any scares. The closing scenes are especially laughable including when the actor with the camera just runs off to film more stuff despite having just reached a point of safety only to get attacked moments later (which I personally cheered for).

I would go so far as to say I hate this movie, its just about as close to the bottom as a zombie movie with a budget could get. 1/2 out of 4 stars.",1343606400,,1768,4.281437125748503

I'll admit, I hate Found Footage Horror; it just doesn't work; instead of making you feel like you're there watching it, it ads another degree of separation because you're watching footage of footage & footage of footage of footage instead of just footage. I also hate Shakey Cam shooting. Another annoyance is the suspense technique of shooting in a completely dark room with a minute light source that shows nothing; I'll take an armature day-for-night shot over that any day of the week. My discrepancies are really no different than they would be with any movie that uses these techniques.

Romero has his own style & because he's trying another director's style, it just doesn't feel like a Romero film. Typical of the FF genre, the acting is overly melodramatic & when people become hysterical, they all have the same personality & barely react differently to situations. The dialogue & reactions create an ""uncanny valley"" feel to the cast, with entire ""real people don't talk that way"" conversations, because in the attempt to make it seem more real, it seems less real. & like most post 90s horror movies, I found myself not liking the cast or caring to see if they survived, perhaps because of the lack of deep character development. Having a casual narrator that you can forget about who occasionally remind you that you're watching footage of footage or a reenactment of it or whatever, like a Discovery documentary, is also very irritating. It also has that one guy that's in every found footage movie, the one who just can't put the camera down, even if it costs him his life, & argues with his lover who thinks his obsessive need to film is stupid. There's also a jarring moment where the movie starts playing ""The Yellow Rose of Texas"" that really rips you out of the movie. If it were any other director, I would have complained that the move felt unfinished, but the ""Of the Dead"" thing is a series & there are already 2 sequels.

There are a few nice moments all in a row; the news montages (which would have been better unnarated), the mute Amish farmer chucking a grenade at a bunch of zombies, the video of the zombie clown ruining a birthday party, & then the way the farmer reacted to being bitten. It also has the nice traditional slow stupid zombies that just seem to make more sense for something dead & decaying. There's also a refreshing lack of in-your-face CG; the only notable moment being the zombie who was attacked with acid & a head-spliting scene.

Random though: I love listening to Scott Wentworth talk in the movie, & his dialogue is perhaps the most over-the-top. With Tony Jay dead, I'd hope he'd voice Megabyte if Rainmaker Ent. ever did another ReBoot movie.",1340323200,,2836,4.677354709418838
2605442,1,B000GEAMD0,"just by using that camera technique where the director is depicting use of handheld video camera alone ruins this movie. They need to stop using this method of taping. It does NOT work.

2605444,5,B000GEAMD0,"first let me start im a huge fan of romero. And i think his zombie movies should be the foundation for the genre. NO RUNNING ZOMBIES! But thats another conversation. diary of the dead is a masterpiece the second time you watch it. I'll admit when i first picked up a copy the 1st day it was released i was really pissed off that i spent money on this movie. But unlike the other garbage i take chances on i didn't sell this dvd, and i'm glad i didn't. years after i watched it, i watched it again. I was amazed on how much i missed in the first viewing and got on the second. The movie goes back to day one well night one. this movie takes place in the same time frame as night. but unlike night your not trapped in a house your on the road. you see what romero wants to point out as far as societies hang ups, and people and theirs. I know that sounds preachy but you have to expect that from the PUNK ROCKER that is GEORGE ROMERO. even his non-zombie film have little point your finger scenes in it. I think in the future that this movie will go down with day as an underrated masterpiece. and if time doesn't see this movie as the masterpiece it is, then its times loss!",1321747200,,1173,4.082251082251083
2605445,5,B000GEAMD0,"Diary of the Dead is one of the finest zombie movies out there.  Now I must admit that I originally snubbed at the concept because whenever it's executed, the results are almost ALWAYS bad.  I'm talking about the ""film within a film"" concept.  I fully expected the worst possible writing imaginable, but instead... it WAS in fact executed near flawlessly.

You see, whenever the writing consists of the main character filming a horror movie and walking around with a home video camera, I usually expect a cheap finish with a ""We got you!  It was all just a movie!  None of this was real, haha!"" finishing touch.  Thank goodness I was wrong!

Instead it's about a group of teens/young adults (obviously) who walk/drive through several different areas filming zombies in an attempt to make a movie and put the footage online so people around the world who also happen to be experiencing the outbreak can watch for themselves and know how to respond and defeat the vicious blood-sucking creatures.

Some of my favorite segments are the ones where the one female working with the crew returns home to find that her family has turned into zombies, and there was a strange feeling of realism here (despite of course, the fact that zombies are far-fetched and unrealistic).  It's hard to explain the feeling... more like an overwhelming feeling of dread.

I can't help but believe this movie was influenced by the Resident Evil video game series.  Zombies in a hospital?  Yup, in Resident Evil 3: Nemesis.  Zombies in a barn and the sound of chickens bulking?  Yup, in Resident Evil 4 (granted they weren't considered zombies in that game, but still).  Just a few similarities to the popular video game series is something viewers can expect to encounter.

Overall, highly enjoyable.  There ARE some dry spells with little in the way of action, suspense or character development, but the parts that are suspenseful are EXTREMELY bloody and graphic so I'm happy with the film overall.",1314057600,,1976,4.865269461077844

2605447,1,B000GEAMD0,"I have to preface this with the admission that I absolutely hated The Blair Witch Project and subsequently curse it for starting the whole handheld video craze.  I have never seen this gimmick used in a way that ever made sense and this movie (Diary of the Dead) is no exception.  It's an artifice that doesn't work.  (One of the characters in this movie repeatedly points out just why it doesn't work.  Did anyone listen to her?  No.  Because apparently people will put up with someone shoving a camera in their face....even while they're driving!)
Then too, the premise of a movie within a movie is a tired gambit made even worse when the director yells cut but the sap behind the camera keeps filming.  Why?  I can't begin to recall the number of times someone told him to turn off the camera.  Despite his claim to document all this, THIS hadn't happened at that point so the only conclusion is that he is a total narcissist.  It was never about keeping a record.  It was about him playing cameraman.  Something he really wasn't that good at as he jerks from one character to the next (while also managing the feat of walking without stumbling with a camera permanently fixed to his face).  I kept thinking how does he keep his arms up in that position for hours on end; doesn't he ever tire from holding his camera up?  And wouldn't a normal person find it just a little disconcerting having everything they do filmed?  How do you talk to someone who's not a face, he's a camera?  It's inherently a creepy idea.  It's even more ridiculous when they pause to give into a rant about video cameras and the loss of privacy!  Not to mention this gimmick is also repetitive (how many times can you put up with some idiot prompting you to speak into the camera and explain what's going on!?).
I'm the first to admit I can't get past the way this movie was presented to deal with it on just a story level.  I might have liked it had it been shot like every other zombie movie Romero has ever made.  As it is, I've seen it twice and considered that two times too many.  I won't bother watching it again (in any regard, it's NOT a keeper).",1299715200,,2134,4.392857142857143
2605448,4,B000GEAMD0,I wasn't expecting much from this movie so maybe that increased my enjoyment. But out of all the movies from the recent zombie uprising this was one of the better ones,1295827200,,167,4.419354838709677
2605449,4,B000GEAMD0,"2008's ""Diary of the Dead"" is a little seen but pretty good zombie movie, utilizing the ""found footage"" and ""characters making a movie on the run"" genre of thriller film making popularized by movies like ""The Blair Witch Project"" and ""Cloverfield"".  Set in the initial days of a zombie apocalypse (it's mostly left up to the viewer whether director George Romero is re-booting his zombie universe or simply choosing to set this story in the early days of the same timeline he's been exploring for years, with a little artistic license to allow for the use of cell phone cameras, social networking sites, and other modern communication conveniences), we follow a group of students and their professor as they try to make sense of the dead now coming back to life.

The student characters are mostly whiny and annoying, but no more so than similar characters seen in other horror movies (besides, don't unlikable characters often make for the most satisfying death scenes?).  Conversely, the professor character is kind of fun, as his main concern seems to be whether the group's latest hideout at any given time has a fully-stocked bar.  I think I would worry about a bar, too, if I was on the run from zombies.

""Diary of the Dead"" is slick, fast, doesn't overstay its welcome, and features lots of creepy zombie action (though some of the CGI effects are better than others).  The movie looks sharp and clean on standard DVD, and the DVD features a generous amount of special features.  While perhaps not up to the classic standard set by his initial zombie films (1968's ""Night of the Living Dead"", 1978's ""Dawn of the Dead"", and 1985's ""Day of the Dead""), the tension, scares, and raw immediacy of ""Diary of the Dead"" definitely make it worth a look.",1295568000,,1753,4.765676567656766
2605450,3,B000GEAMD0,"I've never seen a George A. Romero film before this one.  Of course I knew it was to ""different"" from his usual fare, given that it starts with a new zombie thing happening, rather than continuing on with the one established in the previous movie.  Be wary of spoilers.

I was surprisingly pleased by the fact that, while obviously presented like a documentary filmed by these bunches of students, the protagonist girl whose name I forgot, in the very beginning, describes everything that they've done, filming what has happened, as well as openly admitting that, for the sake of drama, she has added music to certain portions, and edited together footage from other video cameras and security camera footage.  This gave it a sense of legitimacy even in the face of dramatic musical cues.

While the characters fall in to the obvious stereotypes of ""the pretty one"", ""the smart one"", ""the dumb guy"", ""the nerd"", ""the jock"", etcetera, they were believable enough in their actions and dialogue, well acted enough.  It does make sense for the protagonist boy to film everything, but the protagonist girl's heated reaction, from pointing a camera at him and repeating dialogue he'd done earlier, to replicating how she screamed when encountering a zombie for the camera, is believable and sympathetic.

There are a few moments which seem rather stupid, not quite believable, such as when the bunch are exiting the hospital, and suddenly a zombie staggers out in front of the camera guy, and bites on the guy in front of him.  I found it disorienting as to how the camera guy did not hear/see/smell/in some way sense that a zombie was following them, and how the zombie just bumped past the cameraguy to bite the guy in front of him, and then even more frustrated that NOBODY BOTHERED TO POUNCE ON THE ZOMBIE except for the nerd, who very DANGEROUSLY fought and killed the zombie with a metal stick they put the IV fluid bag on.  Considering how he kept stabbing the zombie, and the zombie would try to keep moving into it to get closer, I found it unbelievable that no one would do anything to try to help him or stop him from putting himself in such close danger.

Encounters like the all-black militia force was rather comical, with the leader almost pleased with his predicament, claiming that they have the power now.  It's not unrealistic, but it was funny, and they were nice, especially compared to the band of militants supposedly National Guard who loot from the protagonists.

Going towards the end, the usual stereotypes end up dying off, and the survivors lock themselves in a panic room, with the protagonist girl ending the picture off a clip of video that the protagonist boy last downloaded; a gang of hooligans tying up zombies and using them for target practice.  This leads into probably the only direct attempt by the movie to ask ""Are we worth saving?""

This message, given the context of the movie itself, seemingly comes out of nowhere, and is totally abrupt and curious.  And then the movie just ends on that.

EDIT:  The Amish guy was real fun.",1294185600,3,3065,4.752830188679245
2605451,1,B000GEAMD0,"I really enjoy zombie movies and I'm a film student. After viewing Cloverfield and loving the shaky-cam documentary feel to it, I thought this movie would be a great combination of some of my favorite things. Turns out, it was utterly terrible.

Deadpan narration from our lead lady tells us right off the bat that she's edited it (rather than giving us the raw footage) and also included music (to scare us, she says) which means that this movie isn't a ""raw"" documentary-type movie, which was how it was advertised. Opening bit tells us that these kids are all senior college students who are all majoring in broadcasting, film, or other related majors and that their professor is a complete drunken idiot who really doesn't care what his students are making for their final project.

The stereotype characters are all there. There's the hot girl and hot guy, who are dating. The snotty rich kid and the girl who wants to just party, willing to put up with the rich snotty guy so he can buy her booze and let her hang out in the hot tub. The quiet girl and the tough guy who has a bad reputation but is a total soft-hearted fellow. Then there are the two normal characters, who are dating, one is the deadpan female narrator and the other is the camera guy.

There's some story development and then we get to the hospital scene. As a broadcasting/film student myself, I felt like these guys were all amateurs. Firstly, recharging the battery? Are you kidding me? If you're determined to document the situation of the zombie apocalypse, you're going to bring your camera bag, which he obviously does because he has the power cord. In my HIGH SCHOOL film class, our camera bags were required to have two spare batteries, 3 microphones, and the power cord. Since he doesn't have a spare battery at all in his bag, it means that he's not fully prepared and probably needs to bribe his professor and get him drunk in order to pass this final project. Displays other than timestamps do not record onto footage (such as the low battery signal or the [REC] bit) but they magically do here, which means that our deadpan female narrator added them post-production. Loads of mistakes on behalf of the supposed filmmajorfinalprojectseniorstudents that only a first semester film student who has never operated a video camera would make.

Story, bad acting, story, story progression, plenty of good practical effects but TERRIBLE digital ones. HOLDING AND OPERATING A CAMERA AUTOMATICALLY MAKES ZOMBIES IGNORE YOU. Seriously... a zombie comes up the hospital hallway from behind the group and the camera guy is the last one in line. The zombie ignores him and goes sauntering right up to the disposable 2-dimensional handsome guy character to take a chunk out of him. This happens a lot.

The rest of the movie isn't even laughably bad. The scenes including the mute Amish explosives expert ninja were awesome, but the rest of the movie left a really bad taste in my mouth, which must have been vomit.

The entire thing comes to an end when they are attacked in a mansion where zombies who have been in the bottom of a pool the entire time suddenly know how to use a ladder to get out and other zombies notify others that there must be some juicy brains around because the mansion gets blitzkreig'd in the last ten minutes when they haven't seen groups of zombies larger than seven at a time for the entire movie. The stereotypical hot girl character is being chased by a zombie and the camera guy says, ""Hey, I TOLD you that dead things move slowly!"" in response to something said at the beginning of the movie, despite that the girl's life is in danger and the camera guy just keeps filming with no attempt to aid her.

The last five minutes is a youtube video our deadpan narrator attached to ""make us think"", which is a bunch of rednecks shooting zombies for fun and a zombie head is hanging from a tree, crying tears of blood. The movie leaves us with our narrator asking ""Who are the real monsters?"" and making me want to blow chunks onto the nearest baby.",1292457600,3,4051,4.633704735376044

2605453,5,B000GEAMD0,"Not to date myself, but I clearly recall the day I had begged my parents to rent me this little movie on VHS called 'Night of the Living Dead' back when there was no sell thru pricing and if you wanted to buy a film they were like 90 bucks. So of course I made a copy of it from VCR to VCR and I watched the movie so many times I warped the tape. And since then  Mr. Romero has never disappointed me.  Though my favorite of his Flesh eating masterpieces (and one of my favorite films period) still continues to be Day of the Dead, I really enjoyed Diary immensely hence, why I give it a perfect score. While I don't give the acting a perfect score, and there are times when certain bouts of dialog are painful to listen to, the overall atmosphere the movie creates, with it's faux documentary style and it's various current pop culture references, is quite unique and engaging. From the very beginning, with the immigrant zombies to it's sudden finale, this movie will take you for one sweet, zombie infested joy ride if you just let it. I did see opportunities for the movie to really be more allegorical and with this push more on the boundaries of political correctness. more gore would've been nice also (not that the movie lacks gore I'm just a bit glutinous when it comes to violence in horror). Too many films these days, even horror, are afraid to really be socially challenging and transgression al and instead opt for a safer approach. The whole immigrant angle in the beginning, for example, would've been fun to explore. But then again one can always add their two cents to any film no matter how great and it wouldn't take away from it. Even the acting, to me, doesn't take away from the experience. So on the experience, which is why we watch movies in the first place, I rate it 5 stars. A prefect way to spend 96 minutes of your life. And if you're new to the wonderful world of George Romero ( I figure AMC's 'The Walking Dead' series will create more interest in the genre) be sure to check out Day of Dead, Dawn of the Dead (The Argento cut I like the best), Land of the Dead, Survival of the Dead and...Don't forget the one that started it all ; Night of the Living Dead (just not the 30th anniversary one).

I don't mind the whole home camera shaky thing style (provided it doesn't look like some cheap home camera production values), but the acting is awful in this. The story is completely predictable at virtually every turn. No surprises here whatsoever. You can see all of it from a mile away.

Good social commentary, but it's missing the most important element- horror! Romero, I want my money back on this. I have purchased multiple copies of every other horror movie you've done.

Contrary to what most people say, I do believe you can have a good zombie movie without having zombies in it every 5 seconds. To me its all about the hopelessness you feel when you know things are chaotic and what you would do, how you would survive and those around you. I have seen WAY worse zombie movies. Get it used for half the price of new and then at least if you don't like it, you didn't waste that much money. In all that I DO think it's better then Land of the Dead, which I am sorry, I believe to be his WORST movie. Come on? Thinking zombies who just want to live in their own abnormal society?

2605463,4,B000GEAMD0,"Hello, and THANK YOU for reading my reviews. Despite my deep respect for George Romero as a filmmaker, I've waited until this week (over 2 years after it's release!) to see DIARY OF THE DEAD. Mainly it's because I was somewhat disappointed with his last big horror feature LAND OF THE DEAD, but following my recent screening, I have to say that I found DIARY to be an unusual, entertaining feature. Filled with interesting content, reasonably solid dialogue and good characterizations, DIARY is an unusual choice for Romero in that it 'compresses' the zombie world he's created, in effect moving the events of the original NIGHT to relatively current times, as well as placing the followup DAWN OF THE DEAD in a time frame as to suggest that it occurred only weeks ago. Strange as that sounds, Romero makes it work by filling the screen with haunting images of violence, an unsettling tone of despair and a modern pace that compares (and transcends) most contemporary thrillers. Although the film starts out a bit 'stilted', it's relatively easy to fall into line with the pack of survivors he creates here. The actors are all unknown but deliver solid performances. If I had one major complaint with the film though, it's that Romero's decision to shoot on HD video (not only as a budget constraint, but as clearly as part of the in-film story) it's that there are a few TOO MANY scenes where the screen is too dark, losing character detail and confusing the action. HD video seems to be good for relaying vibrant color, but the blacks seem all too FLAT and the lens range doesn't seem to compensate well when going from indoor to outdoor environments. Having said that, I found the film overall probably the most effective ROMERO ZOMBIE entry in terms of maintaining an effectively creepy tone throughout, as well as a terrifically bizarre ending shot that's as shocking and oddly thoughtful as anything he's committed to film. All in all, after TWO viewings, I feel that DIARY has achieved a position directly behind DAWN OF THE DEAD and NIGHT as my THIRD FAVORITE zombie effort. I wasn't crazy about Romero doing another zombie film, but with DIARY, he's shown considerable growth and energy as a filmmaker and cultural commentator.",1267142400,6,2236,4.8407310704960835

Set in Pennsylvania and following a group of University of Pittsburgh students, DIARY OF THE DEAD chronicles a group of survivor's journey from beginning to end. Starting in the woods during a senior project film project, the group is quickly distracted after Elliot--the braniac--tells everyone that they `need to hear this.'

`This' happens to be the reports that the dead are coming back to life.

After the mummy (the `monster' of the movie) and his girlfriend leave the scene, the rest of the group quickly decide to leave. Mary--who's woman in command of a good-sized camp trailer--begins to take them back home, but not before something strange becomes apparent. When a burned-beyond-recognition cop stumbles from the scene of an accident and into traffic, Mary quickly stops the camper, then pushes past him and onto the main road.

She runs over three people--three `dead' people.

Traumatized beyond belief, they pull over on the side of the road, only to have Mary attempt an act of suicide.

In a desperate rush to save their friend, the group flees to the hospital.

It soon becomes apparent that this isn't all a hoax when they find the hospital abandoned of people.

As a fan of Romero's original DEAD trilogy (consisting of Night of the Living Dead, Dawn and Day of the Dead,) as well as the fourth installment LAND, I was more than willing to watch this unique and fifth installment, although I will admit to being a bit wary about it being shot in a handheld/over-the-shoulder-camera angle. I was quickly able to get past this insecurity though, as the film is shot with stability and without a lot of rough running and tilting. The main thing I liked about the movie was the fact that it was shot like it was--from the perspective of a few college men and women with a camera.

Now, although I enjoyed this movie, I did have a few quirks with it.

-- In the beginning, Deborah (the main narrator of the `film') mentions that she's `edited the footage' and `added music' in an attempt to scare the viewer. Why, I ask, would someone attempt (or want) to do this when they're running from the end of the world? It begs to question the motive of the film, and the footage we as the viewers see. Did we see the end of the world from the perspective of a few college students, or were we hoaxed with some elaborate special affects--CGI and trick camera angles meant to confuse the viewer. We also have to take into consideration that, if they WERE really in the end of the world, and the internet WAS failing, how did they upload it to the internet, if they even did? Did the group survive and eventually upload the video after the United States became stable, or did another survivor find their footage, then view it as we the audience did? I can only assume that this `fault' (if you would even call it that) was Romero's way of making us question the film. Like Night and its racial undertones, Dawn and its commercial abstraction, and Day and its confusion with the military, I can only assume that Diary was meant to symbolize the media and how we can't always believe what we see on TV.

-- There were points during the movie--particularly when the Texan woman took off in the camper--that seemed unrealistic. During the point in which the group is attacked, then rescued by a group of survivors holing up in a warehouse, Deborah demands for the leader to give them food while a gun is being shoved in her face. The fact that any person in their right mind would do this is beyond me. Given the way the group originally attacked Elliot and knocked him down to the ground, it surprised me that the warehouse survivors would so easily give into helpless stranger's demands. As also mentioned above, the blonde-haired Texan woman took off in the camper for no apparent or logical reason near the end of the movie. I can understand why someone would suddenly take off on a whim like she did (from fear, confusion or panic,) but up until that point, she seemed extremely stable, especially after having to kill her boyfriend. Deborah experienced the same kind of character development problems. Her whole family was murdered in front of her eyes, yet she only seems slightly disturbed and says, `Thank you?' I screamed and bawled my eyes out when I thought my cat was hit by a car a few months back--I can't imagine just sitting there like I'd just been punched in the gut after my whole family was killed.

-- Character development was also faintly sparse throughout the movie. While some characters developed extremely well (Deborah, despite her blunt emotions, and the professor, despite his quiet demeanor,) the majority of them remained the same and two-dimensional. Jake seemed to care about nothing more than filming, even going so far as to leave the group in order to keep filming, the Texan woman isn't traumatized by her boyfriend's death and takes off without warning, and the professor's only real point is to say the occasional insightful thing, and be a complete badass with a bow.

Despite my three major points with the movie, I can say that I enjoyed DIARY OF THE DEAD more than any other movie I've tried to watch recently. The tension keeps you going, the action is done in traditional Romero style, and the metaphorical undertones spruced throughout the story make you question the intent of the film.

Although I can't say that Diary has taken its spot as my favorite (or second or third favorite) zombie movie, I have to place it in my top ten. It kept me entertained--I don't see why it can't why it wouldn't keep another Romero fan on the edge of their seats.",1256428800,3,5855,4.66537342386033
2605470,4,B000GEAMD0,"I have been spending a few hours reading these reviews (mainly out of boredom, because I already own the Blu-Ray of this movie), and I'm very amused and perplexed by the mix of what Romero fans think.  Personally, I love this movie, and I would like to address some of the objections other Romero fans have given, and why I choose to forgive these (admitted) shortcomings.

1) THE ACTING IS TERRIBLE!  Yes, yes it is.  But so was all the acting in NOTLD (with the sole exception of Ben), Dawn was cheesey (and meant to be), Day was a bit overdramatic.  In other words, at least in mine eyes, there's nothing new here.  This *IS* classic Romero!

2) THE MESSAGE IS TOO IN-YOUR-FACE!  Granted, Romero's style in this one (narration instead of showing) does seem more heavy-handed than in previous films, but that doesn't change the fact that the commentary (although *slightly* more subtle) has always been there, too.  Furthermore, when Romero was making movies in the 60's and 70's, audiences were content with things going unexplained, and didn't need things spilled out for them.  Audiences *today*, however, were raised on MTV.  Look at movies (just in general) from the 60's versus today: There were a PLETHORA of films that ended with semi-cliffhangers, inviting the view to create his or her own ending.  If a film does that today, then audiences would *DEMAND* a sequel, as if they are REFUSING to think for themselves.  Romero isn't doing the in-your-face for those of us who have been watching and loving movies for 30+ years, they're doing it for the teens and young adults who are used to having their hands held and having everything TOLD to them.

3) THE PLOT IS TOO THIN!  Well . . . got me on that one.

4) NOT ENOUGH GORE! Got me on this one, too.  But Romero has a very good reason for it: The camera is being HELD.  If someone is getting ripped apart by zombies, he is NOT going to stand by and film it, knowing he's standing next to a swarm of zombies.

5) THAT DARN CAMERA GUY JUST KEEPS FILMING!!!  This one I find the most amusing objection, and here's why: You are SUPPOSED to hate this guy!  You are SUPPOSED to be angry that he's still filming while his friend is being chased, and isn't lifting a finger to help.  Why?  Consider his real-world counterpart: You can find footage of the African witch burnings online.  Just search for it (but be warned, it's VERY graphic and disturbing -- don't blame me if you lose your lunch -- you HAVE been warned), and then think: Someone stood by and did NOTHING while several people were SLOWLY cooked to death, his shiny camera lens glistening in the flicker of the flames.  But for some reason, I have YET to hear anyone express criticism for this individual -- a REAL individual who filmed REAL suffering.  Romero is DEMANDING that you DO, and is making that statement with this film.

Is this Romero's masterpiece?  No.  I'd say that was Dawn or Day (toss-up in my book).  But it's a movie that has some genuine heart, despite its plot inconsistancies and other flaws.  I have been watching Romero movies for nearly twenty-five years, so I wasn't aware of how deep they could be until I matured into an adult, but in my mind the whole ""I can't shoot him!  He's my DAD!"" aspect of zombies never really hit home until I watched this one, despite the tenement scene from Dawn.

Diary of the Dead is a VERY quinessential Romero film, and I proudly own the Blu-Ray of this movie, along with my Blu-Rays of his other Dead movies.  Try watching it again: This is one that WILL grow on you, even if that means nothing more than changing it from a 1-star film to a 2.  My official rating: 3 & 1/2 stars.",1256256000,5,3663,4.5068285280728375
2605471,3,B000GEAMD0,"Diary of the Dead falls in a category of disappointing, not because it is a bad movie, but because it's a zombie movie from the father of zombie movies, George Romero.  Had this movie been directed by an up and comer instead of someone who hadn't created, and in some ways defined, the zombie movie, it probably would have been better received.

To the movie itself, the best way to describe it is a modern day version of a cross between blair witch and night of the living dead.  The entire thing is filmed by film students, one in particular, and the rest is the usual zombie moments.  The first encounters with zombies (let me look at that guy with confusion...until he gets close enough to bite and that person becomes the first casualty), the gory deaths, and of course the sad moment of killing a friend/loved one right after they turn into a zombie. Though the story is pretty generic, there are some very unique deaths, and the ""zombie fish tank"" was something I haven't seen before.

Overall I think its worthy of a seeing, though its not a journey I particularly want to take again.  Maybe his next zombie movie will get him back to more original territory.",1255651200,3,1167,4.533333333333333

No- its not as good as DAY or DAWN or even LAND OF THE DEAD but it is far from the crapfest that I'd been led to believe. I would say that if you like his earlier movies I would think you'd enjoy this one but I've heard so many negative comments on DIARY that might not be true. I suggest seeing it for yourself.

I searched very hard to come up with any redeeming part of this ""film"", and the only good thing in it is the Amish farmer and he only lasts 5 minutes, after that part, just turn off the movie, you will thank me.

2605476,2,B000GEAMD0,"The Bottom Line:

With weak acting, poor special effects and little-to-no narrative thrust, Diary of the Dead is a poor film by any standards (regardless of when Cloverfield was released) that hopefully won't be mentioned alongside Romero's much better other ""Dead"" films; with basically one good sequence (the encounter with the black survivalists), a terrible voiceover narration and little-to-no suspense, this is sadly just not a good movie.

  Diary of the Dead is a video diary of Jason Creed (Joshua Close) who is documenting the making of a horror film in the woods.  Ridley (Philip Riccio) is playing the mummy chasing the helpless young lady, Tracy.  On the radio they hear that the zombies are awakening.  With everyone getting the willies, Tony (Shawn Roberts, who played ""Mike"" in Land of the Dead (2007)) decides to pull out of the film and head home.  Jason picks up his girlfriend, Debra (Michelle Morgan) at the dorm. She is the narrator of this film.
  The small cast and crew, Mary (Tatiana Maslany), Debra, Tony, Eliott (Joe Dinicol), Gordo (Chris Violette), Tracy (Amy Lalonde), Andrew (Scott Wentworth), Jason, are all in the trailer on the road. They come across an accident with the living zombies now focused on them. They make a getaway.
  The stop for a breather when all of a sudden, Mary runs outside in panic. While the crew is talking outside, Mary takes a gun and shoots herself.
  They take her to the hospital.  As Jason continues to record their night they see zombies in the hospital and realize they must not be bitten by them.
  Their only hope is to try and make it to everyone's home in the trailer.

  I think the film would have been better without the hand-held camera situation.
  The film really falls flat for me, but began to pick up when they arrived at the fortress.

2605481,1,B000GEAMD0,"Zombies make me happy.  Really happy.  I LOVE seeing them shuffling around, groaning every so often, and chowing down on the feuding denizens of the once-dominant, living world.

This movie didn't make me happy.  Romero clearly is trying to go the route of ""Cloverfield"" and ""Blair Witch"" and the result just plain hurts.  The actors aren't the greatest, but they're doing the best they can with the truly clunky dialogue they've been given.  Is George R. taking tips from George Lucas these days!?  The business about the young movie maker got real old real fast.  Scenes in the movie that CLEARLY could NOT have been filmed by either of the cameras are included, and leave one to wonder just what's going on.  MUSIC?! Lame narration at the beginning explains why these sorry errors occur, but it only adds to the clunkiness.

The whole story is forced and feels like amateur hour rather than a stark new take on an original idea by THE GUY THAT CAME UP WITH IT IN THE FIRST PLACE!  Has George lost his love of the dead? Is the cynical film professor really representative of him?  Why do none of these characters actually act like real people would in this situation?  His previous movies all made intuitive sense.  This one doesn't.  How do people go from freshly dead to gnarly, sunken-eyed, snaggle-toothed zombies in a matter of seconds?  In his prior movies, the freshly dead looked...well...freshly dead.  Here they ""transform"" in a blink of an eye.  What?!  It seems George is just trying to turn a quick buck on a tired premise (the rise of the living dead) and prefers to not try anything truly new and scary.  Why not set it entirely in a hospital? Plenty of potential zombies already there.
Why not set it in an airport that goes on lockdown?
How about expanding on the scientific efforts seen in Day of the Dead?
There's plenty of material waiting to be explored, but George seems to have lost his love for the genre.

The zombies are less than inspiring.  They're not even interesting to look at actually...how can an animated, walking corpse not be interesting you ask?  Well, this movie answers that for you.  I can't believe I'm typing this with my own hands, since I've even found nice things to say about movies like ""Redneck Zombies"" in the past.

I saw this before the far superior ""Zombie Diaries"" and would strongly encourage anyone curious about this latest Romero flick to reconsider and instead get a copy of ""Zombie Diaries"" instead.  It's a much better film, is genuinely interesting, and you'll be happier by far seeing the creative results of some younger people who truly LOVE zombies!",1245283200,3,2617,4.7218543046357615

2605484,4,B000GEAMD0,"George A. Romero is the legendary horror film maker of the dead. He is responsible for the original Night of the Living Dead, and Tom Savini's remake, the original Dawn of the Dead, the original Day of the Dead, and Land of the Dead. He has returned to his independent filming roots with his latest outing Diary of the Dead.

Like all of his past Dead films, Romero has chosen an issue that is happening in the world while he was writing his latest Dead film. The phenomenon he has chosen to criticize was the media.

You can watch Fox News and get the Republican spun version or CNN and get the Democratic spun version of the exact same news story. You can read one newspaper and it will tell you that our country has economically fallen, and another will tell you that things are not as bad as they seem. Newspapers describe the Swine Flu as a pandemic, yet the traditional flu is still a much higher death threat then the new strain.

The media has the power to influence the way we think and live our lives. So, who do we trust? Do we trust the corporate government run media or do we trust each other, ""the little people"" who blog on My Space, You Tube, Face Book, and other internet websites?

Romero's Diary of the Dead is an exercise in showing just how the news you watch every night can take a story and manipulate it either to the standards of the government run corporation it works for or a political agenda.

In this film, ""the news"" tries to tell everyone that everything is going to be okay, however, Jason's camera and recording show the painful truth of a very different reality. Is Fox News and CNN really trustworthy, or should we just count on nobody but ourselves and each other? After you have watched Romero's Diary of the Dead, you will ask yourself the same question.

As a film itself, it is a little low on zombie and gore action, but the gore that it does have is definitely Day of the Dead quality make-up effects that are absolutely disgusting. The film was shot in the perspective of a hand held camera to sell the plot of a character documenting true life events. It is a very scary and suspenseful film, because reality is untrustworthy. You never know what is going to happen in reality until it does. The zombies' make-up is top notch. This film is a scary and exiting adventure of a group of people just trying to survive the beginning of the end of the world.

This film is not as violent as past Romero Dead films, as it focuses more on tension and the characters, but the gore it does have is relentless. This is George A. Romero, taking his zombies into an original idea, on the budget of a low budget horror film. This is a very smart horror film. You can expect suspense, tension, and gore, but it is also a smart film with a lot of social commentary on media manipulation. You really need to watch this film twice. Watch it the first time to enjoy the horror aspects of it, yet watch it a second time to really take in all of the satirical story elements.",1243296000,3,2999,4.363799283154122

2605486,3,B000GEAMD0,"My biggest gripe with this movie is that it didn't bring anything new to the table.  As I watched it, I saw the same old Romero zombie cliches.  They were great then, but just don't cut it these days.  There were almost no surprises, because most everything was telegraphed (""All clear, sir.  I don't see anything in he- <growl, growl, chomp, chomp>"").

Quarantine, on the other hand, kept me on the edge of my seat the entire time.

Had Romero cast Diary of the Dead better, I think the film would have been much more palatable.  The professor character was absolutely unnecessary, and the actor chewed the scenes like a zombie Shatner.  At the climax of the movie, when they arrive at the mansion, I was hoping for something new - some twist - but as soon as they were greeted by an over-acting Ridley, the rest of the movie was suddenly laid out.

Perhaps the most out-of-place scene in the entire film was when Jason chooses to film Tracy as she is slowly chased by zombie-Ridley.  Not only does Romero choose to make the scene comedic (complete with whimsical score), it makes the viewer wonder how the hell this zombie thing became an epidemic in the first place.  A person can out-walk a zombie in the middle of a forest -- barefoot!  I mean seriously, only in Romero movies can a person pierce a zombie skull with a blunt aluminum pipe.  Does part of becoming a zombie include human bone turning to styrofoam?

I hope that Island of the Dead delivers more than this one did.  Romero's franchise deserves better than this film.",1242000000,3,1534,4.547445255474453

The way it is filmed does not bother me like it did other people that gave it unfavorable reviews. What I like is that it starts back in the beginning. Right when the original zombie outbreak occurs.

I am glad I finally watched it and bought it for my collection. Yes, it's filmed different that the other movies, but I am pleased with the way George made a ""different"" film than all the others. There are a few surprises that I liked as well. I won't spoil it for you, but George has always had unique ways for the Zombies to get killed. Take the helicopter blade to the head part in ""Dawn of the Dead"" for instance. Well, let's just say that in this movie there is a scene that equals or betters that scene. It will shock you if you don't know about it, and to my knowledge it's never been done in another zombie film. Thanks for another great ""Dead"" movie George!!

This is the first of the series that I've watched all the way through, and I was pleasantly surprised. The film within a film approach is more effective, and less annoying, here than in some other examples as Romero doesn't allow the camerawork to become too shaky, disjointed, and ultimately irritating. However, the voiceover jars in places and I think more use of captions would have been a better option. The dialogue is also very ripe at times. But there are some nice ironic touches and some very funny moments. Romero's attitude towards the media and the blogosphere is suitably ambivalent although the moralising is occasionally heavy-handed. And I mustn't forget the gore, which is both well produced and marvellously over the top in places. All in all this is good fun if you like a slickly-made, intelligent gorefest.",1238889600,2,973,4.975460122699387
2605490,1,B000GEAMD0,"Normally, I love Romero's zombie films. I also thoroughly appreciate the biting social and political commentary that is present in his films. With that being said, however, I really dislike this movie.  The special effects were good and there was some cool gore. However, the storyline itself made absolutely no sense and there were too many movie gimmicks for it to really grab me or ever feel real.
For example, I am an alumna of the University of Pittsburgh, which is where the movie starts as our student filmmakers are shooting their horror flick. In all the years I spent there, I have yet to meet a student who had an RV.  Another example would be the whole sequence in Philly. They get to the rich guy's house after something like three days and no one stops to ask him why he's still wearing the mummy costume? If things are so great, why hasn't he showered or changed clothes? It's the first thing that another one of the charcters wanted to do. Moreover, after they find the zombie swimmers and realize that the rich guy has been bitten, they don't think to warn their cleanliness-minded friend? Stupid moves by people in horror films are too much of a cliche to be worthy of a Romero film.
Social commentary is all well and good, but first foremost a movie needs to have a cohesive plot. Quality acting would also be nice, which was sorely missing in this movie as well.",1238803200,2,1382,4.546184738955823
2605491,4,B000GEAMD0,"Ever since the creation of the protoypical and legendary zombie film ""Night of the Living Dead"", and the other Romero outings that followed, fans of the genre have cemented in their minds a very specific idea of what makes a good zombie movie.

While most agree that George is the king of this genre, within that universe, there is much dissent as to what makes one of them better than the other.  Some love Dawn more that Night.  Some consider Night the undisputed champ and will consider no other opinion.  Some even like Day of the Dead as much as the others.

My point is that the bar for Romero films has been set so ridiculously high by rabid fans, (all with their own very specific ideas of what the ideal zombie film is), that nothing George produces will ever satisfy his entire fan base.  Such is the life of an acknowledged and prolific genius.  Those who love his work think their first experience with one of his films is the definitive one.  That's why there are unanimous lovers of Romero's work and such diverging opinion of what work is best.

That brings me to Diary of the Dead.  I thought that the story was very compelling.  I genuinely cared about the characters, (the first order of business in any good horror film).  It was also acted very well by actors I did not immediately recognize.  I was impressed.  The effects were great.  George even pokes fun at his own penchant for ""subtext"" in the film.  And there is subtext in Diary.  Very relevant to our times in taking on the media machine of today as well as our rather disgusting love affair with the digital age.  It's not too heavy handed and that's important.  There is balance there because afterall we want to see some zombie action right?  There's plenty to be had and it's a fun ride with a modern spin.  For my money George Romero did a great job.",1236902400,,1834,4.463855421686747
2605492,2,B000GEAMD0,"Given that Mr. Romero has made four previous films based on the zombie apocalypse, it is puzzling that he decides to go the route of a plodding cast with no chance of being remembered. The strength of previous actors prevented the other movies from falling into outright farcical material; the actors were flawed yet endearing. This film has the viewer hoping that the actors will die in hopes that a better movie is in the making.

Recent zombie fanfare has taken the satire out of the genre, therefore an underlying diluting of the concept. It is my hope that better research can be done to prevent Japanese people from giving advice on killing zombies: Japan has a no gun policy, so shooting is out of the question. Oh. my goodness, this should be forgotten.",1236384000,2,761,4.67910447761194
2605493,5,B000GEAMD0,"I can't believe the ""negative"" reviews I'm reading here.  These people liked ""Dawn of the Dead"" but abhors this?  Did I watch the same movie?

First, enough with the comparison with ""Cloverfield"" and ""Blair Witch Project.""  Whoever even tries to make a connection/comparison obviously did not get this movie.  Both ""Cloverfield"" and ""Blair Witch"" ARE pretentious garbage whose only purpose is to scare its audience.  AND FAILS, by the way.

Romero's zombie films--on the other hand--are ""social commentary"" first, then ""scare-the-hell-out-of-everyone"" second.  ""Diary of the Dead"" is basically ""Dawn of the Dead"" in a modernized re-telling.  The origin of the ""zombies"" was never really explained because it did not matter; the focus of the film is HOW the society has abruptly decayed.

Romero did use hand-held cameras but it was nicely done.  ""Cloverfield"" and ""BWP"" had the same attempt but it was pitifully executed: it was done for the sake of inducing seizures.

As far as character development...or the absence thereof as some reviewers noted here.  Well, guys, given the manner of screenplay, how would you have a complex character development that has a timeframe of less than 72 hours?  What, you needed flashbacks?  I wouldn't say there is ZERO character development...but I can't explain it without ruining it for the rest who hasn't seen it.  I would say something though: you wouldn't notice the romantic tension between Tony and Debra unless you really pay attention.

I do agree that the effects are poorly done, though.  It could have been better, but perhaps it's going to cost more money.

""Are we worth saving?""  pretty much sums it up.  Is it preachy?  No, it is not.  I mean, jeez...it's a ZOMBIE FILM for crying out loud.  Romero DID want the audience to learn something from it and not just scare them...why is he labeled ""preachy"" all of a sudden?

And as far as the inevitable comparison with the brilliant ""28 Days Later"" (not the stupidfest that is ""28 Weeks Later"").  Well, to me, the ending of ""Diary"" made much more sense compared to the ""fairy tale"" ending of ""28.""",1234742400,4,2098,4.956896551724138

Romero could've made this believable like Cloverfield did--make them doing something else, something normal, like simply filming a retreat on a camcorder. Plus, when the dead start to come to life, the band of students don't even act scared. The only normal response was by one girl who attempts suicide...and hey, what do you know, she comes back as a zombie. They go to a hospital, and no one's there. So what do they do? They scream ""Hello?"" Slap a big label on these losers that says, ""Zombie dinner"". I dunnno--normal people would be freaking out really bad if this was happening.

2605498,5,B000GEAMD0,"There is an honesty to horror films people relate to.  The viewer goes to the horror film to be horrified.
Television news programs survive on scares as well.  For example video news releases disguised as the news playing during our local news every night telling us more vitamin C is what we need meanwhile that video news release was being paid for by an orange juice company.  A more specific example, ""between 1990 and 1998, when the nation's murder rate declined by 20 percent, the number of murder stories on network newscasts increased 600 percent (not counting stories about O.J. Simpson) (Glassner, 1998).
Auteur director Romero in Diary of the Dead uses these misleading tactics in reverse.  Romero gives viewers a social critique of the media in the form of a horror film much like the media gives you the news disguised as a horror film to get ratings.
The main character, during apocalyptic chaos while zombies kill his friends finds a purpose and that is to get the truth to the people even if that means dying for his cause so the public will know the truth.  His belief for his cause does not die with him but is picked up by his friend and continued.
There are so many ads being thrown at us at all times how do we know what to consume?  To use film as an example if you just went to your local suburban movie theater you wouldn't discover anything except for Oscar time when it seems a movie might make money.  So, we film lovers dig and find a critic we like, a critic suggests a book or a magazine, that magazine leads us to a website, and we find a network of inspiring art if were lucky and it takes work.  For example, I wish there was an IMDB for music or everything in life that could lead me to one place then another of interest.  Singers sing about materialistic things and rappers rap about a gold plated bathtub.  We live in a time of upheaval there are so many causes to get behind but we aren't going to find it on MTV when this singer ""idol"" does the next Revlon commercial.  I'm sure a rapper could find something to rhyme with foreclosure, unemployment, war, recession, depression, see I just did it.  There are many inspiring singers and rappers out there if you work hard you can find some but we the people have to want it and not buy the pre digested garbage.
Romero's film tackles these issues if you're willing to dig for them.

2605501,1,B000GEAMD0,"Even after reading all the reviews online, I was excited to watch this film as it comes from one of the great masters of contemporary horror. I had low expectations, given the reactions from many people on Amazon and around the web. I was very disappointed that, despite my low expectations, the film still managed to disappoint me thoroughly -- to the point of feeling disgusted, and having to write this review.

There are three main aspects that ruined the movie for me (no spoilers here so it is safe to read):

1) Master of Horror, not Master of CGI Horror, please! 90% of all the blood splatter we see is CGI and poorly made. Video games have come a long way and have better special effects than this film. The special effects make it seem like I'm watching a cartoon.

2) The hand held camera style takes away from the realism that the film was striving for. The film tried very hard to instill a sense of panic that never came through to me as I watched the film. Instead, the movie struggled to explain itself as to how it got this shot and this other shot, basically, whatever shot that was not filmed by the main character had to be explained. This just shows an extreme lack of creativity that I would expect from a novice film student (like the ones in the film), NOT Romero. Not for one single moment did I get absorbed enough to forget that I was watching a movie and focus on the gore. I know that this is part of the point of the film, to constantly remind us that we're watching a horror movie and to question our taste for gore. It is repeated so many times that this comes off as flat out pretentious (see the next point).

3) The script and social commentary come off as extremely preachy, and the narrator is beyond obnoxious and distracting to the mood and atmosphere of the film. Most of previous Romero's films depict social commentary of sorts, but these are usually nuanced and delicately embedded within the film's narrative. This normally adds to the suspense and does not detract from it as it did in this film.

I am sorry, but I could not get over these three main aspects as I watched the film. Ultimately I felt that these factors were compelling  enough to give the film one star. I'll be waiting for his next film, hoping he will drop the hand held at least.",1231372800,2,2294,4.398584905660377
2605502,4,B000GEAMD0,"First, I love George A. Romero's zombies.  New-school zombies can suck it (literally, what the F*** is up with them.  They are more like people on angel dust than zombies).  28 Whatevers Later blew.  I thought the remake of Dawn of the Dead sucked.  I love zombie movies but have honestly only seen about 8 that were good.  And I liked this one.  I was very amused at Romero's digs on the new-age zombie.  ""See, I told you dead things move slow!""  I think his take on the first person point of view horror film is the best yet (I have yet to see [REC] which I hear is really good and not available in the US).  Blair Witch was OK, Cloverfield was OK, but Romero nailed it with the, perhaps excessive, detailing of who the camera is being held by and when and why.  Sure, I thought the acting was a sort of bad, but I didn't think it ruined the movie.  Imagine this wasn't a Romero movie...you would think ""Oh, that's interesting filming, some sweet kills, good zombies, but what a rip-off of George A. Romero.""  But its not a rip-off, its not amazing, its DECENT.",1228780800,,1063,4.308080808080808
2605503,4,B000GEAMD0,"i don't care what most neo-zombie fans think about this movie to be honest. i've sat through some great ones and some less than watchable ones throughout my life since the wee age of five and i must say that george romero has always been on the top of the list in my opinion. even max brooks should give him credit for the influences of the neo zombie bible-the zsg because he obviously based the techniques in it off the so called ""romero zombie"" anyways onto the movie.

this was a low budget indy film, showing george getting back to his roots after the big budget land of the dead which pretty much finished off the original series of the ""dead films"" but this one is different.
it is shot completely in first person through multiple cameras including a camer phone and video surveilance footage at times which was then edited and had music added for effect. its also one fo the first films ive seen of its kind where it mentions heavily on how wired society is these days hitting ehavily on myspace and youtube especially for seens of ""unedited footage"" and the likes. its not hyper gorey like most neo zombie fans enjoy but it goes back tot he body of story over substance romero build his ebst films on. the movies g.a.r made never really showed the effects of zombies on society trearing it apart but rather society tearing itself apart with the zombies as a subtle catalyst. and this film delve sinto that very well as the team bicker constantly about how the filmographer won't put his damn camera down even when they're being attacked and even has the camera pointed back at him at times to illustrate the point of sometimes you need to put your priorities in order first instead of getting the shot on camera.

i honestly really loved this movie alot. it's not as shaky as blair witch project was but still realistic enough that sometimes i had to take a break from it to remind myself it was just a movie after all.

so if you like the dead films because of the story and conflicts of the distressed main characteras and the sticky situations they get into, you may very well enjoy this movie. i wouldnt recommend this for the neo zombie-lets see gorey zombie chomping anywhere without alot of substance crowd who settles for crappy  movies because of good special effects though. just the true zombie fans at heart who love a good tale.",1228176000,,2350,4.522352941176471

2605505,3,B000GEAMD0,"In ""Diary of the Dead"" George A Romero returns to his roots. That is what some people say, and they are right in more than one sense. Unlike his previous ""Land of the Dead"" ""Diary"" is made with a lower budget and largely unknown cast, more like an independent film. ""Diary"" also takes us back to the earlier days when the dead started walking and eating the flesh of the living. For all the merits of the film, however, I was slightly disappointed with his latest entry.

The story is not bad. It is about a group of film students and one professor in Pennsylvania, witnessing the world slowly ending around them, with people turning into flesh-eating zombies. Clearly the 68-year-old veteran hasn't lost his touch. Some scenes are scary and some gory (what happens if you use an AED on a zombie?) Some scenes are really funny in a twisted way.

All those events are told through the camera-eye. The film-within-film that follows the terrifying events are actually, according to the narrator, edited (using ""footage"" downloaded from the net), and sound effects are added to the final cut. In this way ""Diary"" tries to make its oft-used hand-held camera device more accessible.

I don't disagree with the narrative method itself. Still what we see is essentially the same as before. People get bitten and they become undead. ""Diary of the Dead"" has great opening, and the fast-paced storytelling and Romero's skill as director keep us interested, but we know where the film is going, and it does.

Perhaps the film should have been made at least seven years earlier when we were not still perfectly aware of the impact of the ""live"" images of the media, or the potential of YouTube. I agree with most of Romero's social messages, but with all respect to him his social commentaries are obvious to most of us now.

This movie fell face-first into the mud.

To be honest, the first-person camcorder style is officially overdone.  I'm tire of the same excuses being used in EVERY frickin' movie like this one as to why the guy with the camcorder can't put down the frickin' camera, even to go to the bathroom.  Blair Witch was good.  Cloverfield was Ok.  By the time I get to Diary of the Dead, it becomes old.

Too much introspection.  Too much philosophical crap, and virtually no plot.  There was nothing new added to the series by this offering.  I found myself fast-forwarding through portions of the movie.

Romero should have just stopped with Land of the Dead.

It wasn't a wretched piece of film, but when I find myself bored watching a horror flick, it tells me that the movie wasn't worth making in the first place.

2605508,3,B000GEAMD0,"This is not a terrible film, but i will admit it is by far the weakest of the Romero Zombie movies.  It's problems are (unfortunately) numerous:

1.  The acting for the most part is HORRIBLE.  We are talking sub-porno movie level here.  Only occasionally does a character actually act like a normal person, the rest of the time they behave like a bunch of college kids that are trying to act.

2.  The character development is bad.  Character development is usually a big part of Romero's zombie flicks.  You actually care about the characters and what happens to them, and you begin to understand them on a certain level.  not in this movie.  You don't learn much about the characters and you don't care if they live or die.  Well, that's not entirely true.  Towards the end of the movie I was hoping they would all be horribly killed, but i don't think that is the effect Romero was going for.

3.  No sountrack to speak of.  There are short bursts of music occasionally, but not NEARLY enough.  Most of the time it is silent and all you hear are the forced and crappy dialog from the characters.  Not good.  Also, the lack of a definable soundtrack takes away much of the impact from the zombie attacks.

4.  It is too preachy.  There is an underlying moral message in the movie, which is good, but the characters pound it into your head by saying the same points over and over and over again.  There is not a trace of subtlety, which is surprising, because that has always been a Romero strong point.

5.  There is no story to speak of.  Zombies attack a film crew so the film crew runs, and the story just follows them as they drive through the countryside.  That's it.  No revelations, no plot twists, nothing.  Just following these dorks around.

Here are things I DID like:

1.  It is Romero, which means that even if it isn't that great, it will still be better than 99% of the zombie flicks out there.

2.  I am not a fan of the first-person camera style, but it is used well here, and doesn't get all shaky constantly like it is b eing held by Michael J. Fox.  The use of surveillance video and news broadcasts was a cool touch too.

3.  The zombie deaths are imaginative and look good.  No one can kill a zombie like Romero.

4.  Despite being shot independantly with a small budget, the film looks very good and does not have that ""cheap"" look a lot of indy films have.

5.  The special features are cool, especially the commentary track by Romero himself.",1224806400,3,2469,4.395555555555555

I just bought this movie and wow....its amazing.  The movie itself is very good and I like the first person feel of the movie.  The acting is actually very well and you never feel as if the actors are over acting.  The special features on the dvd are also pretty good.  They have a lot of mini documentries on there and they are fairly entertaining.  The only downside that I could see is that the ending just leaves it open.  It's kinda like how the remake of Dawn Of The Dead was.  I hope that they continue this story soon and I will be sure not to miss this one again.,1223856000,,729,4.041958041958042
2605511,4,B000GEAMD0,"As an avid fan of George Romero I was overall pleased with this film.  It had some good plot mechanics and over all was an enjoyable movie.  Though as it progressed I felt that it didn't quite grasp the emotions for the characters as the other films had in the past.  That is not to say that all of the the movie was bland in that department.  Just at some moments with close friends dying off there wasn't quite the griefing as there should have been.  Given that I don't even know how I would feel if put in their situation.

One other issue came to my attention.  When watching a video from the 2007 Sundance on this film, some of the blood and effects were indeed CG.  With more and more directors moving over to that area it is some what dissapointing to see that the stage blood and Real mechanics of a movie are fading.  I would rather have non CG work done on these films.  In my honest opinion.

Despite giving this 4 stars this is a movie that people seem to love or hate so you should try before you buy. If you think that the best romero zombie movie is the first then I think you'll enjoy this. If you think the second one is the best then you I'm not so sure.

This movie seems to follow the Night of the Living Dead and Day of the Dead mold where there's more character development but not as much action as in Dawn and Land of the Dead. This is a plus in my eyes considering that most of the recent zombie movies seem to follow the Dawn of the Dead mold as seen in the remake and in the 28 series. If you have different taste however you'll probably be left wanting for more.

The special effects where very good and work despite the fact that Romero starts goofing around in some scenes as usual. Thankfully he decided to not do something as ridiculous as the elastic zombie in Land of the Dead.

The one big negative I see is that the movie looks too clean for its own good. Had this movie been made earlier with old school grainy film I could bet that it would get a cult following from people who think the original NOTLD is the best movie in the series. Unfortunately the crisp visuals can make follwing the movie distracting and some people just won't be able to relax and let themselves be entertained.",1222214400,,1419,4.205882352941177
2605515,1,B000GEAMD0,"My wife and I own all of George Romero's ""Of the Dead"" movies, including Day of the Dead. However, Day of the Dead is no longer the weakest link in the ""Of the Dead"" franchise. Not even close. We were considering purchasing ""Diary"" without watching it first, thinking, ""It's George Romero. How can we go wrong?"" Suffice to say, we are glad we didn't purchase that DVD.

The idea is simple: college students filming a horror movie get thrown into a real one. However, whatever merit the original idea had gets sidelined by the absolute horror of the script, the screenplay, and the acting.

To follow are spoilers:

Let's get this out of the way first: you can't edit your video during the zombie apocalypse. And you don't edit music into a movie in which your significant other dies. Part of the beauty of other first-person movies like The Blair Witch and Cloverfield was their complete lack of music or editing... well, not quite complete in both cases, but neither had music or, God help us all, voiceover. The voiceover by the female lead was monotone, it was trite, and it was quite bad. Any movie that relies on voiceover to accomplish its aims, whether it be a moral message or simply a scare, will fall to its knees(the best example of this was Lynch's Dune).

With this said, you'd think that at least the script or the acting would make up for it.... but it doesn't. The actors say exactly what they are thinking whenever they think it. The script is full of meaningless, cringeworthy lines. Whoever wrote this movie needs to learn the value of silence in a horror movie. Filling the silence is not always a good thing.

All this would be redeemed, as in Day of the Dead, if the movie had some serious gore! However, it doesn't. There is an incident with a farmer, but that is about it. The zombie on the gurney spilling its guts out is done once again, after being done in Day of. It seems as if they ran out of on hand cash for special effects, however that's another issue - what's with the CGI gore? The acid on the head CGI was absolutely atrocious, and completely unbelievable. Most of the gore was computer generated, and it showed. Advice to the producers: stick with the makeup artists. They served you well.

Basically, this movie had some promise in an abstract sense, but failed to deliver. It had no subtlety, no gore, and no acting. The narration, music, and fortuitous editing sealed the coffin, but this one ain't waking up any time soon.

We will never again watch this movie, unlike the rest of the Of The Dead franchise which have an honored position on our DVD stand.",1222214400,5,2597,4.536324786324786

2605518,5,B000GEAMD0,"Everyone seems to be leaning toward the ""it was okay"" review. However, this is a masterpiece. I love the social commentary that Romero is pounding into everyone's head. It's great and it is VERY much needed in a day and age where everyone does nothing but film mayhem and never does anything to help someone who is in dire straits. I am guessing people are afraid of this film because it truly shows how much of a society of dumb-dumbs we are. Cell phone users are included.
 This in my opinion is Romero's best film since 1985's ""Day Of The Dead"".
Much much much better than ""Land Of The Dead"". Looking at the simplicity of a mansion that has a built in panic room...only to be that the mansion itself is a panic room. And that we see things on tv and try and say that it is ""really not happening"" when in fact it is.
 Look to interviews with Tom Savini and his stint as a combat photographer in Vietnam and how he said that him looking at the carnage through the lense was a seperation from what was very much in fact happening around him.
 I love this film and will stand by my statement. If people still wanna try and compare this to the original ""Dawn Of The Dead"", then you are cheating yourselves and this film becuase NOTHING will ever measure up to it's standards.
 Oh, and I hate reality tv and this too makes fun of that garbage.",1221091200,2,1340,4.284584980237154

Day of the Dead and now Diary of the Dead are my least favorite. I don't hate them, they are just kinda weak. I was really pumped to see this movie because it was a new beginning to Romero's Zombie series. I was expecting to see people being ripped apart by zombies, but that didn't happen. I do love the opening scene, with the immigrant family coming back and eating people. I love the background in the opening too, that orange kind of sunset is really awesome! Jason Creed wants to make a mummy movie for his college class, then his friends hear about the zombie epidemic. They all get in a Winnebago and look for help. The whole movie takes place on a handheld camera. There are some cool zombie gore scenes. Some parts are kinda boring. If you love zombies and George A. Romero, you might like GEORGE A.

And from there, we get what George Romero must have thought would be cute: a homevideo style chronicle of the start of a zombie outbreak. It was sort of interesting to watch at points, seeing the background reaction of the media and everybody posting to youtube and all that. But it ended at sor t of and never grew. It didn't provide anything new, and I mean if George Romero is going to plaster his name right there in the title he better back himself up with something that will make me think some more about the genre. Even a little. I didn't. It's all stuff that I've either seen on tiny low budget movies, read in novels or short stories, or hell even just read on a typo filled message board. It was so flat and uninspired.

I did have some hopes for this film, but they were all dashed. It just annoyed me more than anything else.",1220227200,3,979,4.235294117647059
2605521,4,B000GEAMD0,"When it comes to the genre/films of Zombies and the Undead, especially the works of it's biggest creator George A. Romero, I am one of it's biggest fans. It takes alot for me to dislike the barrage of films we've received since it's official conception over 40 years ago with Night Of The Living Dead. But after four films by Romero himself, one being the somewhat disappointing & commercial Land Of The Dead, does a now 66 year old George still have what it takes to scare us with these creatures? With his latest chapter Diary Of The Dead, he still proves he can be relevant while bringing us some old time scares at the same time.

Diary basically is a reboot of his franchise bringing it back to the first outbreak of the dead rising from their graves. But this time their coming back in the digital age, where now any Joe Schmo could video record the events and post them on a variety of websites for the whole world to see rather than just the local news. The film concentrates on a group of Pittsburgh film students shooting a Mummy monster movie when the initial outbreak begins, and in their Winnebago they try to travel back to their homes and safety. All along the way, they turn their movie into a documentary trying to capture, obsessively mind you, the events of Horror and Death they encounter every time, using the logic of ""If the camera doesn't see it, it really didn't happen"".

Unlike other films in Romero's Dead library, this one is in an ""edited after the fact"" documentary style, but unlike last year's Cloverfield, instead of a small handheld camera bought at any electronic store, the main camera used is the type you'd notice carried by your local news team, so the picture it produces wouldn't be as shaky and uncontrolled. And much like The Blair Witch Project, what you see has already been edited, so it's more like a movie made from raw footage instead of just plopping in the original tape in a player and pressing play. For the film it works quite well, but unfortunately it leaves open other problems of logic along the way.

On the negative side, the unknown actors used here act about as stiff as the Zombies they're recording. Even though this is supposed to be really happening, at times they just don't seem believable in their emotions & reactions. Another is the fact that at times the girlfriend of the group narrates the documentary but mostly comes across like she's the little sister of Sarah Connor, flat and unaffected. Also, if a Zombie was coming after you I personally would be too afraid to just keep rolling and hope someone else comes to save me instead of putting the damn thing down and running like Hell. But again, these kids are from the ""You Tube"" generation, where hobby becomes life itself, and that should be taken into consideration when watching this film.

On the plus side however, there are deaths here that I can assure you that you haven't seen before, the acting does either get better (or you just get used to it), the overall vibe of the film takes on a '85 Day Of The Dead-like quality, and unlike Land Of The Dead never seems too commercialized or sterile. I'm giving this movie a low 8.0, and that's in part to the disc's great extras including commentary, behind-the-scenes, and some great home movies shot by fans for some contest ran before the movie premiered. I would say if you own at least four Zombie movies in your collection, Diary should be in there as well. It is a very good representative of the Digital Age & Social Commentary we now live in and how today's youth would handle it. It's not a Romero Masterpiece like others have claimed, but after four films George could have done alot worse.

2605523,4,B000GEAMD0,"George Romero's four previous zombie films have all followed a natural progression.  The Zombie outbreak started in Night of the Living Dead and by the time we reached Land of the Dead the zombies had become the dominant species.  However, Romero takes the series back to its roots with Diary of the Dead in more ways than one.  Consider this a reboot or a re-take on the start of the zombie outbreak.  We are back in Pennsylvania just as the first few reports of the dead returning to life are being broadcast on local news stations.  A group of University of Pittsburgh students, working on their own horror film for a class project, pile into a motor home to try and get home.  Jason (Joshua Close), the director of their film, decides to start recording the entire event on his camera.

The group has their first encounter with a zombie along the highway as a burned up state trooper tries to stop their RV.  The full realization of what is happening finally hits them as they take an injured friend to a hospital only to find it empty...except for a few undead doctors and nurses.  Even as the carnage unfolds, Jason continues to film, uploading his footage onto the Internet even as his girlfriend Debra chastises him for his insensitivity.  Immediately you're thinking Night of the Living Dead meets Cloverfield because of the handheld camera.  The camera work in Diary is certainly less jerky than in Cloverfield and much of the time you'll barely notice it.

Diary is the closest zombie film yet in terms of scope to Night of the Living Dead.  It's a small cast working within the confines of a handful of sets and locations.  There are fewer zombies than in any previous Romero zombie film since ""Night"".  This is all by design.  Romero wanted to return to a smaller, independent feature.  His intent was to make the film for under a million dollars.  This was a very personal film for George, one that he could do entirely his way without having to please studio bosses.  Romero talks quite candidly about this during the making of documentary. While he certainly enjoyed working with the bigger budget he had with Land of the Dead, you get the feeling that he's more comfortable with a smaller film.

The cast is largely unknown but not inexperienced.  Most of the actors have at least a couple of dozen credits in both film and TV.  No one stands out but no one hams it up either.  What the film lacks, however, is any real tension.  The difference with Diary and the rest of the series is that our survivors are mobile, and are not trapped within a farmhouse, shopping mall, underground bunker, or a walled city.  The one time they are pinned down within an old barn they are able to make a quick getaway.

Diary is also less bloody than Romero's previous films, in part because of the camera work.  Since the whole thing is supposed to take place through the lens of Jason's camera, some of the zombie feeding activity must be imagined.  There are some notable special effects, such as the zombie who gets a jar of acid busted over his head and his skull slowly is dissolved down to the brain.  Still, you have to admire Romero.  He could have made another big-budget zombie film but he told the story that he wanted to tell.

Extras

Pulling up the grade on the DVD is a nice set of extras.  Romero, Director of Photography Adam Swica, and Editor Michael Doherty provide a lively audio commentary.  The best extra is the feature lengths (80+ minutes) making of documentary covering the cast, crew, special effects, make-up, and more.

Other extras include featurettes on the first week of filming, character confessionals, and the inspiration for the film.  Romero recruited some well-known horror personalities to do some of the voices you hear over the radio and TV in the film and these are covered in a featurette called ""Familiar Voices"".

Finally there are five short zombie films, winners of a Myspace contest that are quite entertaining and well-made.",1219363200,,3975,4.6676258992805755
2605524,4,B000GEAMD0,"Ah, hell.  I'd might as well put my two cents in about the new Romero zombie film.  I see it has succeeded in disappointing many fans for the most part.  That's too bad.  But for those who thought this movie was a big letdown, I do see why you feel that way.  All around I actually did like the movie.
There is one misconception about this movie I have to address.  Many folks think this film ripped off Cloverfield.  Not true.  I don't know about anyone else out there, but I remember reading about this movie a few years ago.  This film hit the market after Cloverfield, but it must have been shot right around the same time.  I do know that Romero had the idea for this one a few years ago.  SO THERE!!
Romero's original Living Dead Trilogy is required viewing for any hardcore horror fan.  For most of us horror geeks, these films served as the gateway to the world of gruesome, extreme and other-side-of-the-fence types of horror movies and a lot of us have never looked back since.  They're essential movies!  They're as essential as Number of the Beast is to the Iron Maiden fan or Hannah Montana to preteen girls and pedophiles, or ""Margaritaville"" to every damn ocean cruise you go on.
So many years of repeated viewings of the Trilogy(if you're like me you could do a one man Broadway performance of all three films), and the impact it's had on our movie tastes, how is Romero supposed to top that?  Or even get close to that?  Eight billion zombie films make it into the theater and video shelves every month anymore it seems.  Romero's films don't seem terribly unique anymore.  I enjoyed Land of the Dead(a lot of people seemed to), but it just didn't feel the same.  It was a good movie, but I just couldn't find myself lumping it in with the Trilogy.  Too much time has passed and too many bad changes to the film industry have occurred.
I feel pretty much the same for Diary.  I like the fact that Romero went back to his low budget, independent style of film making.  Like in Land, he approaches the subject matter with a bit more intelligence than most zombie films.  After all, it is HIS genre.  Romero and John Russo more or less created the world and the rules that most zombie films play by.
I didn't mind the story of Diary, nor did I mind not seeing hordes and hordes of zombies onscreen.  I actually enjoyed the ""less is more"" type of approach.  But as a personal preference, I don't like films that are presented as footage through the camera lens of an individual shooting the events.  I don't think it's a dumb idea, I unfortunately get ill when I watch it.  I always get a headache and/or nauseous feeling when watching it.  Most people don't experience this at all, and it may be piddly, but the fact is that it always does it to me, so I don't enjoy this type of format.  I am glad that I watched it however.  I probably just won't want it many times unless I take the necessary precautions beforehand.",1218931200,3,2933,4.395910780669145

I think I even said it out loud a few times.

And it all comes down to the acting, really. I hated the gimmick (a movie within a movie), hated the pacing, hated the same old OMG HUMANS ARE WORSE THAN ZOMBIES schtick.. But the acting! The lead actress in this one, I don't know her name (I will check now that I think about it, so I can avoid her in the future) delivered the WORST performance I have seen in a while.

2605527,5,B000GEAMD0,"In this fifth installment of George Romero's zombie saga, he turns his sites on our current cultural pathologies; in this case, it's the society of the spectacle under examination. Romero's acute eye for social satire and his tremendously serious motivations coexist with sterling storytelling ability, some of the finest gore effects in movies today, and a bit of fun too. In other words, Diary of the Dead offers something for everybody, much as Shakespeare, even in his tragedies, always serves up a bit of business with the gravedigger. These days we're more and more apt to be a hybrid audience; we've got a little bit of the groundling in us, a little bit of the highbrow critic. Media has made us what we are, for good or ill, and Romero offers no solutions to our existential crisis. In this film, we're all implicated in one or another kind of living death, even if it's just the ubiquitous passivity of the average YouTube watcher...if we watch and do nothing, we are guilty of the kind of sin even the Pope has no category for, yet. The mall-walking zombies of Dawn of the Dead, dead consumers with an atavistic twitch for product, are now the clickers on hotlinks, the bloggers and blog-readers, the goldfish in the media aquarium (to cite one of the many splendid metaphors in Diary). This is as profound a film as ever the horror genre achieved, a true work of art that will be studied and enjoyed for a long, long time...",1217980800,4,1436,4.65748031496063
2605528,2,B000GEAMD0,"I know it seems wrong to criticize or -gasp- dislike a zombie movie made by the master, George Romero. Besides his enormous influence in the genre, his ability to mix horror and social satire has been remarkable. But this latest offering, while sure to be enjoyed by Romero purists or forgiving zombie fans, feels dated and frankly, Romero or not, behind the times. Using a shaky first-person handy-cam perspective, Diary records the predictable events and endless rambling, poorly-acted dialogue to tell its story. This style can be seen in recent movies like Cloverfield and Blair Witch and you can either deal with it or not; some people actually report getting nauseas when viewing this editing style. The plot points of the story are typical - screaming, running and shooting all punctuated with buckets of blood and gore. The expected Romero social commentary does predictably deal with weighty issues such as racism and class conflict but it's delivered with awful acting by screechy immature would-be students out to record their own real-life horror movie. I don't begrudge the film's low-budget atmosphere as it's practically a hallmark of the genre. That still doesn't make it appealing.

The film had implied that the epidemic started in the present day, and that was a pretty big anachronism on George's part. Even though I'm aware that he was trying to re-boot the series, I was still a bit disappointed.

2605531,3,B000GEAMD0,"George Romero has returned to his ultra-low budget roots with DIARY OF THE DEAD.  For most, it will be a welcome return.  While there were many parts of his ""big budget"" LAND OF THE DEAD that I enjoyed...frankly, having known actors and high production values just took something away from the nastiness factor of NIGHT, DAWN and DAY OF THE DEAD.  That shudder of realizing you're watching something distasteful and compelling at the same time.

Much of that feeling returns in this newest film.  No doubt Romero simply couldn't raise the money again after the box office failure of LAND...but he may have relished a chance to display his filmmaking chops in a manner similar to NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD.

In a way, this movie is a reboot.  It takes us back to the time when the zombie outbreak (in case you don't know...the dead are coming back to life to ""feast on the flesh of the living."") is just starting.  But now it is set in our time.  Digital video is everywhere, as is access to the internet.  In fact, the entire film is supposed to be a hastily edited video from one of the survivors...because various members of their party have been filming the events of those horrific first days of the ""plague.""  So, yes, it has a very BLAIR WITCH / CLOVERFIELD feeling to it.  While I still don't mind this jumpy, ""amateur"" style of filmmaking if its done well, occasionally I couldn't help thinking how unoriginal this type of movie was becoming...and realizing that it won't be long before filmmakers won't be able to get away with it.  It's a gimmick.

Much of the movie is seen through the lens of Jason, a film student who simply cannot bring himself to stop recording the events, even when setting down his camera to help his friends might be a ""good"" thing to do.  Romero gets around this by actually having the various characters (especially Jason's increasingly bitter girlfriend Deb) criticize and comment on Jason's obsession.  We also see the cast downloading videos that others are spreading around the world in an effort to show ""the truth"" of what's happening, because official government reports are clearly watered-down edits of the truth.

Some reviews have praised the social commentary of the film...and the DEAD movies have always had a little element of social commentary in them.  But they are at their most clumsy in DIARY, because the characters literally spout social commentary.  Romero seems to think we can't understand his commentary just by viewing the actions of his characters.  So it becomes a clumsy commentary...especially in the hands of these unknown and frankly, marginally skilled actors.  As always, the acting leaves a lot to be desired...Romero just doesn't seem that interested.  So as we follow around this group of college film students and their professor, they become increasingly annoying because they are generally written and acted in an unconvincing manner.

But luckily there are good things too.  The basic premise of these films...that our dead are coming back and killing the living, who also come back with an all-consuming interest in eating living people...always works.  Danny Boyle tackled similar stuff with 28 DAYS LATER.  Others have certainly done ""zombie"" films...including the truly excellent Zach Snyder DAWN OF THE DEAD remake...but NO ONE DOES THE GORE LIKE ROMERO!  He ups the ante yet again in this film, with some imaginative death and dismemberment sequences.  The movie is GROSS.  Often gloriously so.  But isn't this the reason we watch these films...those of us that do?  Do we watch the zombies so we can enjoy witty banter and biting social commentary?  Or do we tolerate the bad acting and clumsy dialogue so we can enjoy some good zombie gore?  I modestly suggest it is the latter.  I don't feel proud of the admission...but there IS something satisfying about those bursts of adrenalin that come from a close call with a zombie that is then dispatched in the squishiest possible way.

Just to give you an idea of the newest gross-outs:  (by the way, if you aren't interested in gory details, please don't read this paragraph).  In one scene in a hospital, our heroes are out of ammo and there's still one zombie remaining.  She shambles towards our cameraman, but one of his friends grabs a defibrillator and shocks the head of the zombie.  The zombie briefly twitches and then its eyes swell and then burst in a gelatinous explosion.  It is horrifically gross, but I also had to wonder how this scene was so convincingly executed.

There's one death of a zombie, involving acid, that was clearly done with CGI...but for the most part, this is old school makeup and low-tech special effects.

So overall, I recommend the movie...just barely...but really only to fans of the genre (or niche, really).  The film is full of flaws...but nonetheless will appease those who hunger for some more flesh-eating zombie action.",1217030400,5,4900,4.874244256348247
2605532,3,B000GEAMD0,"There was a 20 year gap between ""Day Of The Dead"" and ""Land Of The Dead,"" and I'll own up to being one of many who wished for another Romero zombie flick.  The man virtually invented the zombie subgenre, and the man deserves credit for ""Night"" and the wildly inventive ""Dawn Of The Dead"" (2005).

But after ""Diary,"" it's not hard to fathom why the father of slow-moving zombies may have had difficulty gaining funding and getting projects going.

""Diary"" is just mildly interesting at best.  I don't really care about the violence, but the gags in ""Diary"" kind of fall flat (a scene involving a deaf Amish farmer and a scythe is supposed to be inventive, but ends up cold).  The film is clearly derivative of ""Blair Witch"" although it does take the concept in a new direction.

It's not the low-budget atmosphere, and it's not the attempt to have a message - in this case a commentary on addiction to voyeuristic net culture as a substitute for actually creating something.  That's all fine - but the ""message"" is a little to on-the-nose to make it interesting, and you feel a little patronized at the end.

In all fairness, the lamest Romero Zombie flick is an order of magnitude more interesting than the slew of living dead competitors/remakes/rehashes made in the last few years.  I'll always have a warm spot in my intestines for Romero's horror films, and I hope he tries again, perhaps with a sequel a bit more in line with the epic ""Night-Dawn-Day-Land"" series (""Land"" got a bad rap, but it improves with age, much like ""Day"" did.)

2605533,3,B000GEAMD0,"...the dead shall inundate Hollywood!

First let me just say, I'm a big Romero fan, after all he's the father, err grandfather, of zombie filmmaking. Last year when I first heard that Romero was making another dead film and I started seeing trailers for Diary of the Dead; I was overwhelmed with excitement. It seemed edgy, gritty, and kind of reminded me of Martin in that it was set out to be more of an experiment in filmmaking and carried itself in a kind of intellectual way.

Fast forward to a few months ago and Dimension Extreme released Diary of the Dead on DVD. First, what is it about the word ""extreme"" that immediately makes me doubt the intention of its very meaning? Oh I know, Tartan Asia Extreme has sullied the expression on more than one occasion; but that's beside the point. I keep an open mind because both Tartan and Dimension have put out some excellent stuff; it's just every now and then...well you know. Anyway, I'll get right to it. Diary of the Dead missed its mark for me; conceptually Romero gets an A+, as always, but he just failed to deliver in his execution.

Romero makes some of the most prolific, poignant social observations of any filmmaker I know. Subtly masked within their zombie layer his commentary has a way of creeping in and infiltrating barriers that we would normally, perhaps inadvertently, be not in tune with. In this case, sensationalized media, desensitized and habitualized society, was, and I think the biggest, comment made in Diary. ""The people need to know"" words that echoed repeatedly in my mind while watching this film. It could be construed as irony within a world where the term ""people"" and what qualifies is quickly becoming debatable. It reminds me of the adage; if a tree falls in the forest and no one is around to hear, does it make a sound? I think the real question Romero asks is does it really matter if it makes a sound? Touch, Romero, touch.

Well with Romero's good intentions aside; the film just didn't pull it off for me. I'm not sure if it was because of a low budget or what but Diary just came off as trite. The innovative third person documentary style came off as overly polished and the camera work lacked the gritty documentary feel. Maybe the HDV video look was not the best way to differentiate between the uses of multiple cameras. It simply blurred them and made it appear that the filmographer was drunk. Simply put it lacked the realism that one would expect from a documentary. However, the biggest flaw was not that Romero didn't keep up with the thread of different cameras; in fact that all pretty much made sense as we would go from one camera as its battery died to another that ""coincidentally""(accidentally on purpose) was placed in another strategic location. It's just that it made no sense as to how we, the audience, happened across the masterful, edited copy of the video in question. It didn't jive with me, in fact bugged me throughout the whole film.

There is not much else left to say about the film at this point. The gamble Romero took by using this documentary style as a plot device just didn't hit therefore things like the acting is irrelevant. The effects certainly didn't make up for anything either. The CGI gore just, well sucked. Sorry I couldn't be more constructive there but it just wasn't believable and looked as though it was edited along with the fake made for TV movie that the protagonist shot.

It was certainly a great effort on Romero's part and any fan of Romero can appreciate what he is doing and has done for the horror genre. I think he is definitely, continually going in the right direction with his films. I just think he needs to let go and really get back to his roots a bit more and experiment.",1216684800,6,3741,4.584454409566518

2605537,2,B000GEAMD0,"George A. Romero's legacy as a master horror filmmaker is secure, that much I'll say at the beginning.  With films like ""Night of the Living Dead"", ""Dawn of the Dead"", ""Day of the Dead"", and the first two ""Creepshow"" films under his belt, George Romero has brought a lot to the genre over the years.  Unfortunately it seems as if he's beginning to lose steam.  ""Land of the Dead"" was a mediocre payoff for an ambitious effort, but ""Diary of the Dead"" is even less impressive.

Coming conspicuously hot on the heels of the hand cam style kaiju movie ""Cloverfield"", ""Diary of the Dead"" is a hand cam style zombie movie. While this is an interesting concept, the execution is so weak that the film seems little better than the recent Sci-Fi Channel Original ""Return of the Living Dead"" sequels.  For one, the film begins with a voice over by one of the characters, who states woodenly that she put this film together from video she and her friends shot during the early days of a zombie outbreak.  She then notes that she ""added music to the film to try and scare you"".  Right.  From that point on, the film follows a handful of film students who are trying to make a horror movie when the outbreak starts.  They all decide to take off in an RV and regroup, one by one, with their families.  One of them, an aspiring young director named Jason, refuses to stop filming, stating repeatedly that has to record everything so people will know the truth.

The idea of media truth is the central theme of this film.  It begins by implying that all big media is so slanted as to be of absolutely no value and that perhaps user-produced media (like blogs and Youtube) is a better avenue for truth.  Midway through the film, the message shifts to something along the lines of ""the more voices there are, the more spin there is because everyone wants to tell the story their way"".  Now these issues are certainly worth discussing, but Romero has completely abandoned every last iota of subtlety in addressing them.  Once upon a time Romero's films contained social commentary that had to be read into a little to really be appreciated.  ""Land of the Dead"" was more obvious about it than the previous installments, but ""Diary of the Dead"" just beats you over the head with it as if viewers will be too stupid to get such an obvious premise.

This is greatly exacerbated by the ongoing voice over, always delivered in a wooden monotone, that constantly interrupts the flow of the film and even goes so far as to blow some scares for viewer by introducing them before they happen.  What in the world was Romero thinking?  The characters are all stiff and do little to draw our sympathies, and Jason, the lead, is easily the worst among them.  It is completely unbelievable that anyone, even some sort of uber-serious documentary film student, would go so far as to, say, film a zombie attack rather than helping his own friends to fight them off or stay with his charging camera rather than help his companions look for help for a gravely injured friend.  When a zombie movie is cobbled together poorly enough that believability issues enter the viewer's mind at all it means that something is very wrong.

What's even weirder is that none of the characters seem all that frightened of the fact that there's zombies around.  They all seem capable of shooting perfectly straight, making wisecracks, and efficiently wielding any weapon from defibrillator paddles to dynamite to easily dispatch their foes.  The viewer never feels any real sense of danger at all, even, bizarrely, when people are dying.  The movie barely makes an effort to build tension, and almost any time some modicum of suspense is allowed to build up it is instantly blown by an intrusive and utterly unnecessary voice over.

""Diary of the Dead"" is an almost staggeringly tedious movie.  Before its release I'd waited with baited breath for this movie to come out, but in all honestly I spent the final half of the movie just waiting for it to end.  It pains me to say this about a George Romero zombie movie, but I'm not lying when I say that I haven't seen a zombie flick this hard to enjoy since the legendary French stinker&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Zombie-Lake/dp/B000059H88/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Zombie Lake</a>.",1215216000,4,4326,4.778225806451613

2605539,5,B000GEAMD0,"So much has been said about DIARY OF THE DEAD already that even attempting to write an in depth review of it at this point would be a waste of my time, and probably yours as well. Thus what you have before you are some rambling comments on the film and at least one of the major complaints I've heard about it.

Like everyone else who refers to him or herself as a horror fan, I love Romero's previous work. Although LAND OF THE DEAD is taking its own sweet time to grow on me this is not unprecedented since DAY OF THE DEAD had the very same effect on me--DAY OF THE DEAD took a good decade and a half for me to be able to appreciate its charms, it was a case of loathe at first sight. I admit that this is as a result of my inability to cope with Romero's change in tone rather than any defect in the film itself. Its more than likely that this will also prove to be the case with LAND OF THE DEAD which I have only managed to watch once since its release.

My reaction to DIARY OF THE DEAD was as quick as my reaction to DAY had been, but in exactly the opposite direction. Perhaps I'm simply being my normal contrary self and responding to all the negative reviews by coming out in favor of the film, but I don't think so, not this time. I was immediately relieved to learn that Romero had dropped the notion of zombie civilization for the time being because that brings with it all sorts of awkward questions, such as the delicate subject of being asked to feel sympathetic toward creatures who still need human brains in order to survive no matter how much they want to just pull a Greta Garbo and be left alone!

What I was happiest with was that he wasn't hammering his social message home as heavy handedly as I had feared after having seen LAND OF THE DEAD which was almost embarrassingly blatant in its delivery. In fact everyone claims to have ""gotten"" his message as they proceed to pan his film for not having enough carnage and ""serious zombie dining"" in it to quote my favorite phrase from Main Man's review, but I think they only ""got"" half of his message--the obvious half having to do with the distance that the media, television and internet have put between us and reality. They missed the more nebulous part about how films such as his own have decreased the value of a single life until it has come to mean nothing at all. Its just another death. And that doesn't mean anything at all--its all about the body count. To quote the film:

""Its strange how looking at things, seeing things through a lens, a glass, rose-colored or shaded black, you become immune. You're supposed to be affected, but you're not. I used to think it was just you out there, the viewers, but its not. Its us as well, the shooters. We become immune too--innoculated so that whatever happens around us, no matter how horrible it is, we just wind up taking it all in stride. Just another day. Just another death.""

The above quote from the end of the film makes me wonder if, as he nears the end of his own life, Romero isn't standing back and asking himself whether his films haven't contributed  just a little bit to the devaluation of the worth of a single life. Or at least whether the violence in his films hasn't in some way negatively affected his own life...

Just some rambling thoughts.

Liked the movie though, although time may reduce the rating to a somewhat more realistic 4 stars.",1215043200,9,3391,4.337539432176656
2605540,4,B000GEAMD0,"There is nothing more cinematically satisfying to me than a zombie film, especially any of Romero's Dead series. Night, Day, Dawn, and Land are ranked high on my list of zombie films and even horror films, so where does Romero's fifthy entry in his series lie in my top? Sadly, it's not up there with the previous four. That doesn't mean that I saw, I didn't enjoy.

 The first-person camera aspect of the film is becoming popular years after it was done in The Blair Witch. Cloverfield did it and did it well. Diary of the Dead was lower-scale (also that way in comparison with the other Dead movies) and more personal, and I think that's a part of the reason why I enjoyed it so much. Romero through in his usual commentary on the world with how everything is available to see due to the extremely easy accessibility of recorded evidence. Of course, a bit of unbelievability is required to view this film because in a situation like this, I don't necessarily think that anyone would keep a hold on a camera although Romero's characters reason was to show the world what was actually happening since the government was lying. I'm pretty sure the world could just look out their windows and see what was actually happening.

 What I really liked about Diary was the character's reactions to what was going on around them. I don't know if it was a directorial choice, but they seemed so sensitized to what was going on. There weren't any overreactions (unless they were literally attacked), each character automatically manned up and used any way possible to approach the dead and dispose of them.

 As for the creep factor, there were a few moments that got to me, but one scene in particular really spooked me. That scene being in the hospital when something appears in the far corner of the camera and then burst into frame.

 Although a little dissapointed that Romero decided to revision his own series and with lost hope that we will see a continuation of Land of the Dead, I was slightly surprised with his new path. Now I'm stuck with which continuation would I want to see. Land or Diary?

2605544,5,B000GEAMD0,"In 1968, unknown director George Romero and a group of friends put together what has been hailed as one of the greatest horror films ever made. Unfortunately none of them ever saw much in the way of money from the film's distributor, but they've made up for it since. The movie was NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD.

Now Romero returns to his roots with his latest excursion into the world of zombies with DIARY OF THE DEAD. Taking place during the same time period as the first film (not '68 but in the zombie timeline or when the zombie plague first begins), Romero gives it a fresh look and turn.

A group of college students are out shooting a horror film, a mummy movie, when they get word that the outbreak has begun. A news station is airing footage of 3 murder victims who rise off their gurneys and attack the EMTs sent to pick them up. The students pack up and head for the dorms.

When they arrive, they find that no one has remained and decide to make the trek to their own homes as well. Fortunately one of them has a motor home and they set out. The entire movie is filmed as if it were a documentary ala BLAIR WITCH/CLOVERFIELD. These are film students after all. But the main person in charge, Jason (Joshua Close) is so detached from all that he films that he never sees until too late what is going on around him.

The group consists of Jason's girlfriend Deb (Michelle Morgan) whose home they are trying to reach first, Eliot (Joe Dinicol). Tony (Shawn Roberts), Tracy (Amy LaLonde), Gordo (Chris Violette) and their film instructor Professor Maxwell (Scott Wentworth). Each has their own part to play in the story and the acting is never an issue. They all do a great job.

Central to the story is Deb who's constantly worried about her family. At the same time, she draws further away from Jason as he focuses solely on his film, explaining that it's important that someone document what is happening for others to see. The problem is that in so doing, he detaches himself from reality and from those around him.

The film move at a steady pace as the group encounters everything from their first zombie on the road to zombies in an abandoned hospital. The reality of death and of the dead rising is handled by each in their own way as survival instinct kick into overdrive and they move forward. We watch as humans decided not to sit and take it, but to move forward with the hope that something, somewhere, their old lives remain intact.

Fans of the series of films Romero has made know up front that the zombie invasion will change things. While zombies make up the low percentage of those walking at the beginning, eventually they outnumber the living by the time his last film LAND OF THE DEAD took place. What we see here is a precursor to what is to come.

Some say that the handheld look seems lacking. I thought that it added to the story. It made a statement about the use of cameras from news footage to kids falling off skateboards in clips online. People take themselves out of the picture and seek only entertainment value at the expense of others. They do detach themselves from reality. And it's sad to think that in so doing, they drop us a notch down the evolutionary scale.

Romero has taken what could have become a lame genre filled with the same old same old and given it an injection of something new. The film stands on its own or fits well into the series started over 40 years ago by the same man. It has its share of scares, of commentary and of human interests.

But you need to watch the extras on the DVD, specifically the one in which Romero discusses the film and the fact that he's ""not sure"" how the audience will respond to it. The predecessor, ""Land of the Dead,"" was a major studio (Universal), relatively big-budget film. ""Diary"" isn't, and Romero freely admits this. He says that there are ""fewer zombies, but maybe if the zombies we have are really good that will be OK.""

I found it hard to get behind the ""college students video taping the zombie crisis"" central plot line. And face it, if the ""hook"" doesn't hook you, you either find other things to appreciate in the movie or you turn in a one-star review.

I didn't particularly care for his previous film; ""Land of the Dead""(Romero's big budget outing) but hey, even great directors have their bad moments. With a very small budget, Romero's latest film seem to have captured the documentary style ""gimmick"" that have plagued other films. I never really cared for this style, I've always thought it was a one-hit wonder with ""Blair Witch Project"". Armed with a measly budget, can an acclaimed director pull off the dead end gimmick of a first person view? It almost feels blasphemous to give a critical review to a George Romero film, but amazon friends; Dave K and M have done it, Jenny, Main Man, M.B Cole and Chris Blackshere are on the middle ground while T-man loved this film. I'll give it a go. The issues with ""Diary..."" isn't all cosmetic, it was discipline.

The film is supposedly a documentary that is shot by a film student named Jason (Joshua Close) and narrated by his girlfriend Debra (Michelle Morgan). The film's main premise is that while they are in the woods with an alcoholic film professor (Scott Wentworth), the news of the dead coming back to life and feeding on the living breaks out. They pack up, gets in the RV and try to head home. In their journey, they encounter zombies, a militant group, zombies, a deaf amish, zombies, ex-national guardsmen, zombies, meet up with a friend, zombies...sounds repetitive doesn't it?

As with Romero's other films, ""Diary of the Dead"" contains a social commentary. No, it is not subtle at all; this message seemed to have taken the audience by its neck and kept on shaking until we passed out from boredom. It deals with the fact that because of the internet, more folks from all walks of life are reporting on current news and events, the more videos, the more the truth gets blurry until we don't know just what the truth is anymore. As usual, Romero uses the `undead' to make such a statement and fans are undoubtedly split on its preachy tone. The drunken film professor never runs out of alcohol and never runs out of insights about the past war and the philosophical aspects of mankind's inhumane actions seem to be a little out of place when he shoots a zombie with an arrow. There are also some attempts at satire with an deaf Amish but it seemed so cheap and incongruous. The SFX sometimes looked realistic, then at times looked very fake. It wasn't consistent in its delivery of the `undead'.

Romero also makes a bit of subtle coaching (he is the proclaimed zombie guru) to aspiring filmmakers when the characters discuss the workings of a horror flick; why is it women always loses their shoe, they trip over something, gets their clothes ripped to show a bit of skin? Then as a touch of irony a girl does trip, loses a shoe, gets her outfit ripped to show some breasts when she was being chased by a zombie. Romero also criticizes the more modern zombie flicks when he expresses that the `undead's' bones and joints are so brittle from decomposition that if they move fast, their `undead' bodies would break apart; therefore ""moving slowly"" or ""shambling"" is a necessity for all `undead' stars. (imagine that)

The problems in ""Diary.."" is that suspense is none-existent as the DV camera gimmick kills all attempts at such. The film also suffers quite a bit from the feeling that we've all seen it before, and we've seen it done better. The film also gets repetitive and their sense of purpose doesn't really provide any sense of credibility, which is further emphasized that the characters are so wooden and one-dimensional and the acting looks like they're reading the script out of the cue card. There is also a very annoying scene where Jason just kept on shooting his camera while a colleague was being chased by a zombie that displays his obsession with the documentary itself. This feeling of annoyance gives the character a very unlikable impression, much like the characters in ""Cloverfield"". It was quite annoying and nauseating to watch someone be so insensitive and at the same time dull. Perhaps this was an attempt (another commentary) to point out the indifference of everyday folks to the plight of their fellow men. Homelessness, poverty, etc.

My point to all this is while I agree that nobody mixes in social commentary with zombies as a vehicle better than George Romero; halfway through the film it was just too much and turned out so boring. This is a horror film and if and when I want to watch social preaching, I'll watch TV. The film is so darned predictable that as I expected, characters will make bad decisions, drive somewhere, they'd encounter zombies, narrowly escape, split into groups, then get trapped somehow and encounter zombies again. While I did expect the film to be full of clich, I just wished Romero could have given it more thought in concentrating on giving thrills and chills (or even more gore) to cover it all up than stooping to a ""commentary"" about current society. Instead, the film is an overload of annoying scenes and an overkill of the same ol'stuff to cover up its very hollow execution. Body counts are aplenty but none of them were inventive, making the film very forgettable. It is not subtle at all with its message that in the end it just left a very bitter taste in my mouth. I really wanted to like this film and I doubt it will grow on me.

Die-hard fans will still praise and applaud this film just because it was made by George Romero; isn't it ironic that this film comments on the truth becoming  jumbled when too many eyes are involved? Maybe it was the expectations and the hype that killed the film`s enjoyment?

Its in the Shawn of the Dead realm( Romero even gives Shawn Pegg among others a special thanks in the credits)...the movie is not scary because its not supposed to be! lol...thats why none of the characters or the situations where based in any kind of rational reality and why the acting is so horribly over the top! Diary of the Dead is a snooze fest for the most part but there are some truely funny scenes: I laughed out loud at the old Amish man with the chalkboard scene(classic!)and the scene in the garage with the black guys had a great moment (where they kill the guy whos NOT the zombie lol...very cute joke)...the clown at the birthday party was hilarious! the guy stealing the TV in the girls dorm and when the main character is in the hospital but cant leave the room with his camera because its charging both gave me a laugh :)
Also the zombies in the pool were cute and the whole ""Mummy"" in the mansion was fun in a kind of adult Scooby Doo way...
all in all,not the best film and people seem to be SO SERIOUS about it...
definately a rental...dont expect to be scared or horrified because guys...thats NOT THE POINT of the movie lol...some of the the effects are neat(the final shot with the rednecks and the zombie woman hanging from the tree is cool)but all in all not up to Romeros standards...although the attempt is there :)",1213056000,2,1483,4.435897435897436

I'll try not to let me disappointment in Amazon tinge my review.

As Romero Zombie movies go it was definitely near the bottom of the heap. I understood waht he was trying to do it just seems a shame that SO many people for there first. Some of the zombie effects were cool and I though the CG was used sparingly and overall well done. The problem with the most recent films from Romero is he never seems able to create a character that we can actually give a crap about. If there's no sympathetic character then there is no reason to be scared, heck you actually enjoy seeing all these self involved college kids getting killed in this one. His best film is still Night of the Living Dead and I think that is because the main character was so likable. You wanted the other knuckleheads to die but Ben (Duane Jones) was cool and in charge and he really deserved to make it out. The dark twist of him actually making it through only to be killed by idiot rednecks was a shock. He's never really equalled that genius move in any of his films since although Dawn of the Dead came pretty close with the characters of Roger and Peter and Roger's tragic conversion to the undead and Peter's horrifying choice to kill him was pretty much the last time I can recall giving a dang about anyone in a Romero Zombie movie.",1212969600,2,1625,4.208333333333333

The acting was great a very realistic which added alot to the premise of this latest outing.  This new chapter in the Romero Dead series truly adds to what makes the series great.  The plot is very interesting and edge of your seat, you never know what will happen or where a zombie is going to show up.  The feel of this film is like you are one of the on the run misguided members of this ill fated group, which is what makes the film so effective.  The atmosphere like all Romero zombie films is truly amazing, the over the top gore effects are all present and well done add even more realism to the film.  The Zombie epidemic presented this way is a very well thought out new angle on the rise of the living dead.

2605561,5,B000GEAMD0,"As with Day of the Dead, Diary puts a very strong emphasis on the characters, and less on action, with great results.

The great thing about Romeros Dead movies is that no two are alike. This one is from the perspective of film students making a documentary of their experiences during the first outbreak. The premise allows for unique camera angles, and Romero's directing talent shows throughout. Shaky footage, shots from the floor, documentary style interviews, and even small details like the camera running out of batteries are used. There's nothing flashy or hollywood about this. The characters are developed wonderfully instead of reel after reel of mindless zombie blasting. This is a horror movie as it should be. The dialogue is smart, giving each character, even ones that make only brief appearances the human element. They are each dealing with the crisis in their own way, and portrayed for example in scenes where the camera man is so tied to his camera that he would do nothing to save his friends because it would ruin the shot. Breif clips that were 'downloaded' by the students (made by others experiences of the crisis) and incorporated into the film are vividly created to an eerie level. They also give Romero the chance to make more observations about how we deal with the threat of danger.

This is intelligent, A grade horror, and though all 5 dead movies are great, this and 'Day' stand as my favorite of the first 5 for their special attention to the characters rather than action. Highly recommended.",1212710400,,1530,4.85823754789272

However this movie was like George Romero took a giant dump in a dvd case and then tried to close it up and sell it. First thing, the acting was absolutely horrible, where did he ""dig"" up these fakers? 2nd the story sucked balz, it could have been decent given better actors and if they weren't trying to preach so much about the media and about ""having to document this for whoever's left"" garbage!!! I mean, in one scene this girl is getting attacked by a zombie and her friend is filming and doesn't put down the camera to help her, just starts yelling CUT CUT CUT..trying to distract the zombie, she gets away and calls him an a-hole, no realism at all. If an undead creature was attacking a normal person, she'd be hysterical, and if he didn't help, she'd be crying and beating on him once it was over, not just a raised eyebrow and a curse. Ridiculous stupid garbage, I have been such a big fan of Romero my whole life, but this putrid, fetid pustule of excrement should be burned.

Diary of the Dead is no zombie masterpiece, but it is much better than the abundance of criticism that it received suggests.

Diary is the story of what goes down with a group of young folks at the time of the zombie outbreak. In other words, the events in Diary are supposedly concurrent with the events in the original film. Unfortunately, instead of just filming the movie, Romero built the story around the events all being captured on raw video...mainly on a portable video-cam, a la&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Blair-Witch/dp/B00001QGUM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Blair Witch</a>&nbsp;and more recently&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Cloverfield/dp/B0014Z4OQG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Cloverfield</a>.

In the remake of Dawn of the Dead the zombies went to a new level: they ran, they seemed a little smarter, and (yuck) they could give birth. Then in 2005 George himself came back with Land of the Dead, and the zombies forgot how to run but were even smarter than in the Dawn remake. In Diary we go back to when it all started and the  zombies are just slow, dumb old zombies again.

I was thoroughly entertained by Diary and would not suggest anyone interested in the genre pass on it. The horrible camcorder effect and any lapses in a believable plot line are made up in good scares and in going for the gross out.",1212624000,2,2462,6.9546925566343045

2605567,4,B000GEAMD0,"Recently, Romero seems to get his thunder stolen moviewise more often than not.  The last dead flick LAND was preempted by a more trigger happy remake of his brilliant DAWN OF THE DEAD, getting to his idea of the DEAD RECKONING vehicle first.  Beside all the financial BS he has undergone from the 1st NOTLDs oversight with the copyright, he is now beaten to the punch by other 1st person narrative ""reality"" films like CLOVERFIELD.
The thing is none of that matters this time as Romero is back in form with a meaty culturally skewed tale that fits right into the series and reflects our times perfectly.  The ego/importance of the documentarian, the overexposure of home video, and the general uncertainty of the times we live in are explored deftly within the confines of a good old fashion horror flick.
This is entertaining thought provoking, and gory as it should be with the best final scene of any of the DEAD pictures.  It wasn't quite what I expected and other than the common sense lack of a certain zombie killing near the end Diary fits right in with Night, DAWN, DAY, & yes LAND as some of the more socially relevant and impactful horror films of all time.

In its social commentary the movie comes across as a 60's flower-child hippy having a temper tantrum.  So blatant that it almost sounds like a caveman: media bad, military bad, society bad, etc.  In Romero's previous films the social commentary was there, brooding in the back like a dark specter.  In this movie the main characters pontificate so much that I was wishing for all of their demise so I could hear the sweet sounds of the shuffling dead.  It always amuses me that people with no to very little weapons experience suddenly doing head shots at will (not to mention using a bow).  The professor reminded me of Sideshow Mel from the Simpsons, with overly dramatic delivery and his shunning firearms was so pretentious it made me laugh out loud.  All of the college students are great philosophers, have undying love a la Romeo and Juliet, and are leading the fight for social justice cause the public has to know man! Bleh.  At the end of the movie I almost expected the Rodney King sound byte ""cant we all just get along?""

Where was the tension? The fear?  The helplessness?

Overall, the movie is very disapointing.",1212364800,2,1414,4.676113360323886
2605569,2,B000GEAMD0,"""Diary of the Dead"" is the fifth installment in George Romero's zombie cannon which started off with 1968's genre-defining ""Night of the Living Dead"", was updated brilliantly and surpassed by the 1978 sequel ""Dawn of the Dead"", which was also nearly (but not quite) upstaged by 1985's excellent ""Day of the Dead"".  This trilogy proved that when it came to zombies, George could do no wrong.  In 2005 Romero returned with the 20 years in the waiting ""Land of the Dead"" a film, which was met with very mixed fan reaction.  I personally liked Land of the Dead and dug it for what it was.  We couldn't expect George to make movies look as though it was still 1985 could we?

Story: In Diary, a group of college students from Pitt University flee from campus after a zombie outbreak.  They hit the road in a big hippy-style van so they can go back home and be with their (hopefully still alive?) loved ones.  One of the students named Jason decides to film all of the events and broadcast on-line for the world to see.  The film thus plays out as a sort of web-cam unfolding of events.

My initial reaction on hearing about the premise of Romero's new zombie opus was not necessarily a negative one.  Sure, the shaky-camera, reality thing has been played out for years now but I gave Romero the benefit of the doubt because it wouldn't be the first time he reinvents himself through these films.  Although all of them are zombie films, ""Night"" is radically different from ""Dawn"" which is radically different from ""Land"".  So in Diary, Romero is not settling but continuing to reinvent himself.  But oh, how poorly this is executed!  Nearly everything in this film is an absolute mess.  The CGI head shots that make us crave for Tom Savini.  The dreadful ""social commentary"" about how we are now all a bunch of media-obsessed, blogging, self-promoters.  What a fine observation of modern culture George!  And the acting....the most frustrating part is not knowing if the atrocious wooden acting is due to a puke-poor cast or if Romero wanted it to look this way intentionally to play in with his ""reality"" concept.  I'd like to give you the benefit of the doubt George, but after watching this wreck I've given up all hope.

Is this the worst movie ever?  Certainly not, there are heaps of b-horror trash way worse than this.  But one thing's for sure, this movie will never elicit repeat viewings the way Romero's other zombie films did.  Even those who liked this movie, I refuse to believe for one second that they would see the need to sit through this again for multiple viewings.  It's sad to think that throughout the nineties I kept hoping, praying, Romero would finally have the green light to make more zombie films.  Now?  I just want him to stop...

One thing I've noticed reading through these reviews is that no one seems to be debating this simple point:  If Romero's name wasn't attached to this, would we have anyone defending this movie as being a ""masterpiece"" or have a single 5-star rating on this board?  No way, this would be discarded as a by-the-numbers 2-star zombie straight-to-DVD fodder and nothing more.  Blind worship I say...",1212278400,4,3151,4.666061705989111
2605570,3,B000GEAMD0,"Diary of the Dead (George Romero, 2007)

I had thought, after George Romero gave us a twenty-year wait for the fourth Dead film, that Land of the Dead would be the final entry in the series. And given the quality of Land of the Dead, I didn't figure that as a bad thing. But here we are a couple of years later, and Romero has ditched major-studio funding and massive shooting schedules, and we have the fifth Dead film, Diary of the Dead. In every way possible, this is a back-to-the-roots effort for Romero; it's derivative, it has no budget whatsoever, it features a cast of unknowns, it's short and to the point, and it's the most fun I've had watching a George Romero joint since Monkey Shines.

Diary of the Dead dispenses with the idea that this is going to be original early on, heading straight into the territory of Cloverfield and [REC], giving us a movie shot from the perspective of a handheld videocamera. Old news, right? Well, yeah, but the reason it's become such a popular conceit in the past thirteen years or so is because it's a very effective way of limiting what the viewer can possibly know about what's going on, and letting the viewer know that's what's happening. It also lends a sense of immediacy to the proceedings that is just as effective (and fun) here as it was in either Cloverfield or [REC]. This is an alternate universe for Romero's Dead films, for obviously videocameras didn't exist back in the day, but the dead are rising for the first time (or these are the dumbest characters you've ever seen in a movie). So we get a bunch of folks running around trying to avoid zombies who want to eat them (or, another well-used but still effective zombie-movie conceit, refusing to believe that loved ones are dead, because after all, they're walking around again; one of the most memorable scenes from Romero's own Dawn of the Dead plays on this). And sometimes failing. And running into other survivors who are more interested in stealing what you have than helping a brother out. That sort of thing. It's nothing new, plotwise, but it's blissfully obvious that Romero had a great deal of fun with this. And sometimes that's what makes the difference between a turgid piece of nonsense like Land of the Dead and a witty, urbane success like Diary of the Dead. ***",1212105600,2,2297,4.613691931540342

No, it is the opposite. Romero uses great actors, but relatively new to the movie scene, for this movie which makes the movie fresh and seem more original. The cinematography was a breath of fresh air, as it allowed us to follow these characters in somewhat ""real time"", without the edited feel to all of it.

The movie goes back to when it all began and tells the story through a group of film students in the initial stages of the zombie outbreak. The gore in the film is top-notch and splendid. The defibrillator scene is especially good.

Romero also brilliantly explains why zombies are slow, why they don't run: their knees would give out. Take that running and wall jumping and climbing zombies! (The new&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Day-of-the-Dead/dp/B00116GEHU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Day of the Dead</a>) Let Romero show you how it's done! This movie is nothing short of great, Romero uses a fresh take to cinematography in his movies, new faces, and a very good script. The result is a really good movie that deals, in Romero fashion, with the current issues of society: war, immigration, distrust in the military, chaos, the ""not knowing"", 9/11 and many more.
Dawn of the Dead is the best of Romero's movies.

2605574,5,B000GEAMD0,"WOW! George A. Romero's Diary of the Dead... where do I start?

Well, this is the film film that I have watched that his was filmed in shaky cam. In my mind that film was GREAT - There were very little special FX used, Looked/seemed like he tried to make it like his old style films - facial makeup - over the top blood/gore.

I really recommend renting/buying this film - A must have for all Romero and zombie fans!",1212019200,2,416,4.1875
2605575,3,B000GEAMD0,"I've always loved George A. Romero's zombie movies, dating back to when I first saw Night of the Living Dead (90's version) when I was just a kid.
I remember that I loved the 2004 remake of Dawn of the Dead, then I saw the original version and loved it even more!
Night of the Living Dead & Dawn of the Dead set a standard for zombie movies that cannot be surpassed. Perhaps that's why Diary of the Dead comes up a bit short...
Diary of the Dead was a good zombie movie, and worthy of mention as one of George A. Romero's movies. However, that's just it... Diary of the Dead is good, just ""good"" not Great. The movie keeps you feeling tense throughout, (just as Romero's earlier movies did) yet this one has some issues.
First of all, the acting isn't so great... While some of the characters are portrayed quite well by their actors, some of them are so bad that you feel like you're watching A Sci-Fi Channel Original Movie, and that's where Diary of the Dead suffers most.
Next, while the new through-the-lens Documentary-like style of the movie is a fresh approach to the Dead series, and it's realistic how the main character constantly has to recharge the battery in his camera, (unlike the everlasting battery from Cloverfield) it just feels too different from the other Dead movies.
Furthermore, Diary of the Dead really has no place in the Dead series. It's not a sequel, nor is it a prequel to any of Romero's earlier movies. One could make the arguement that it's set before the events in Night of the Living Dead, but unless they remake it again, that wouldn't make any sense. This plot of Diary of the Dead is set in modern times, there are cell phones, camcorders, and internet access in the world of Diary of the Dead. The last Night of the Living Dead movie was made in the 90's, yet it really didn't have anything in it to suggest that the happening in the movie took place anytime after the 1960's, so to claim that Diary of the Dead took place before Night of the Living Dead wouldn't fit with the timeline.
And lastly, the special effects aren't as good as the 90's remake of Night of the Living Dead, or the original version of Dawn of the Dead, why? Because Tom Savini, the guy who did the special effects for both the 90's remake of Night of the Living Dead & the original Dawn of the Dead was not part of the special effects crew for Diary of the Dead. One of the reason's why 90's Night & the original Dawn of the Dead had such realistic special effects is because Tom Savini was a war photographer in the Vietnam war, but for some reason he wasn't part of the Special Effects crew of this movie.

On a side note, I live in PA, and my college student friends don't drop the F-bomb nearly as casually as the characters in this movie do.
The stereotype that all us young whipper-snappers are so found of using the F word is blown way out of proportion in movies today, and Diary of the Day has fallen prey to it.

The Verdict: Good zombie movie by George A. Romero, but that's about it... Paid 17.99 for a movie that I may never watch again.
Rent it before you buy it.",1212019200,3,3091,4.33678756476684
2605576,1,B000GEAMD0,"First off, I am a huge Romero Fan as well as a fan of the whole zombie genre. I don't claim that the movies I do love (night, dawn, day, land, the remake of dawn, the return of the living dead I and II, Undead, Fido, remake of Night,) are Oscar winning material, although a lot of them are horror lovers fan favorites. Humans getting up from a seemingly long dirt nap, morgue table, or after you run over them aren't usually on your normal wish list for plot points. I have said in reviews past that my love of zombies comes from my fear of the closest thing to you, or the people around you, becoming what you run from in the night, and you cannot reason with them, they want your flesh and they want it raw. Romero above all, has been able to tap into that fear and he is the king of the dead. This movie, as its internal movie within a movie is called is hopefully not the ""death of death"" It was horrible, and not in a campy ""its so bad its good"" way.

The premise, college kids making monster movie in woods when the dead come back to life, and so its filmed in that shaky hand held homemade movie way. It worked for Blair Witch, and for Clover field, but not for this. Jason, the man behind the camera, just HAS to document the events; all of a sudden he is beyond mummy movies and thinks he is the next great documentarian. So he gets it into his head that he MUST film at all times, even at the expense of the living people around him, he won't drop that camera because it is now his life's purpose.  The rest of the bunch consists of the rich guy, the blonde chick and her boyfriend, some nerd, a drunken professor, and Jason's girlfriend. Romero has a way of putting people together who represent society, this time it was his version of what kids today are like (and he got it wrong) I think back to Barbara and Ben and Harry in NOTLD (1968) and how amazing that dynamic was, or Stephen and Peter and Roger and Francine in DOTD (1978) those casts are memorable and iconic (also Day, and even in Land and remake of Night and Dawn). It was as if Romero didn't want us to care about this cast, as if they were expendable and forgetful and the Blog/footage was the real star, but that didn't work either.

The actors in Romero's films usually, to me anyway, are refreshingly un-affected, they aren't well known and they aren't tainted by what ""they think"" they should be ""acting"" like. It's what makes them all the more real. The ""actors"" in Diary of the Dead reminded me of watching very horrible high school drama skits, or some banal MTV ""reality"" show like The Hills or Laguna Beach. Painfully aware that they are on camera and should be acting a certain way.

The effects, my favorite part of zombie movies, were so severely disappointing. Gone were Tom Savini's genius and in its place was weakly executed CGI and makeup. Digital blood is a slap in the face of zombie enthusiasts everywhere. Sure if you want to do a giant shot of the dead (remake of Dawn) go ahead poor some CGI blood up in there, I will even okay it in frenzy, but one on one is unforgivable and lazy.

I think that Romero still has things to say, points to make, dead people to reanimate, I just don't think that shooting a movie over 23 days sloppily is the way to do it, and still retain your fan base. I just got burned, me a loyal fan, and the next one I will rent instead of buy.

The special features, mainly the contest winners from the Myspace ""make your own zombie movie"" were the ONLY redeeming quality on this DVD. All five were interesting, funny and entertaining.

In conclusion, this movie sucked and its my one and only ""get out of undead jail"" free card for george.",1212019200,7,3664,4.278499278499279

People have problems that it doesnt look like a documentary, but I have to disagree. I enjoyed the acting alot and thought the actors did a good job doing what Romero asked from them. And the idea that it is beginning back to the original Night of the Living Dead in modern time is also brillant. Trust me after watching it over and over again I love the film more and more.

2605580,4,B000GEAMD0,"This wasn't my favorite Romero film.  Living in the technological age, I get pretty tired of it so I really don't like it being the premise of this film.  There were good jumps (when the zombie came up from behind in the hospital, still dragging the I.V. bag along)  and tense moments, but the actors left much to be desired.  I love the way Romero never divulges what causes the dead to rise, and the last few moments really make one think about humanity and just where it is headed.  I will purchase this film because I am a Romero fan, but I will probably never view it again.",1211932800,,579,4.275229357798165
2605581,4,B000GEAMD0,"George Romero has insisted time and again that this was a back to basics approach of independent film making.  Yet, Romero has rarely strayed from his original formula - low budget, little known actors, plenty of scares.  The difference with prior ""dead"" movies though is that this resets the story, playing it out against modern technology, politics, and perhaps cynicism regarding the powers that be.

""Diary"" takes something of a ""Blair Witch"" approach to its story.  The film is narrated by Debra, one of the survivors from the group of students we encounter at the beginning of the film.  The film within the film is basically what we are watching.  It is shot by a film student named Jason Creed, played by Joshua Close, who sounds uncomfortably like Crispin Glover.  Jason doesn't know what's going on, but if it's something big, he wants to get it on tape.

The film is political allegory, like all of Romero's zombie films.  There is hysteria around the nation and the media isn't quick to show us what is really going on.  The nation raises the terror level, but isn't saying why.  People are quick to get in touch with family and friends to see if they're ok, in spite of the uncertainty about what is happening around them.  Romero's political subtext is more obvious than his previous outings almost to a fault.  It's all over this film.  It can seem a little preachy, but it does work.  There is a great quote in the film, stating that if it doesn't happen on camera, then who's to say it actually happened, which although is obvious, does assess our obsession with media in regards to tragedy and hysteria.

Another ubiquitous feature of the film is technology.  It's something that didn't exist in Night of the Living Dead.  The internet changes things.  Romero wisely shows how the immediacy of information among communities effects things.  In Night of the Living Dead, people were fixated on a black and white TV.  They had to believe what was dished out to them by television personalities.  Now, of course, we can get information from miles away from people we know.

While Romero's points are poignant, they can get to be a little much.  It seems that we are getting things shoved in our face rather than receiving the subtle contexts of Night of the Living Dead or Dawn of the Dead, where the themes unravel in the closing.  In Diary, it feels like Romero has to keep reminding us of his message, as if we can't figure it out on our own.  Also, while the casting of unknowns is smart, the talent leaves much to be desired, detracting from the brilliant way the film is shot.

Still, Diary is a heck of a lot smarter than the slew of horror films released today.  It's also full of splatter with a dash of humor thrown in for good measure.  Romero's formula feels untainted and it's a welcome entry into Romero's ""dead"" genre.  The DVD is full of a lot of making of vignettes.  The treat to fans will be four or so films made by fans, including a hilarious 3 minute piece featuring Teller, of Penn & Teller fame.",1211846400,,3034,4.58364312267658
2605582,3,B000GEAMD0,"Good evening.  This is Tom with Channel 4 news.  The stock market crashed as oil prices hit record highs.  The unemployment rate ballooned nearly 10% the past month while crime keeps escalating at an alarming rate.  Home equity plummetted, health care plans are becoming invalid, taxes rose, debt skyrocketed, and the soldier's death toll suffers its most jagged increase since the opening weeks of the war.  But to heck with all that irrelevant junk, did you watch American Idol last night?  Hahaha, that's some funny stuff!

My biggest problem with the latest Dead installment is the seesaw effect between the serious and the comical.  Throw in so much cheese and corn, and it's hard to digest all of the social and political commentary.  George makes some great points, some important profound statements, and then shows something totally absurd to spoil the moment.  I didn't particularly care for that.
I've got some more issues with this one.  The acting is pretty bad, but that didn't really bother me.  Neither did the CGI.  I hated the tone, or the mood of this entire story.  George never really establishes a dark, gloomy, foreboding atmosphere.  In my opinion, an adequate feel of desperation never settles in, I'm sorry to say.
I did love the idea of the homemade zombie documentary.  Romero tries to bring a  fresh element to the horror genre, and for that he should be commended.  But the camera work was not too convincing.  It rarely has a real feel.  And I was shocked at how underdeveloped the characters are.  Maybe this story is about people as a whole, but some closer connection with some individuals would have been nice.

Diary of the Dead starts strong, but quickly fizzles out in many aspects.  There are some nice gore scenes, although it seemed to be lacking in that department a bit.  It has some undeniably great pieces from the master, but are bogged down by chunks of disaster.  I will say that I'm impressed with Romero's efforts at something original in the zombie saga.  Hopefully his latest effort will grow on me.",1211846400,19,2051,4.80515759312321

2605584,2,B000GEAMD0,"A ""restart"" of the Dead film series necessitated by the scarcity of humans seen in the earlier arc of Romero zombie flicks (Night, Dawn, Day, and Land), Diary of the Dead is George's attempt to retell the tale using a Cloverfield documentary style feel. Not much went well here, and the end effect for me was to make me revisit my earlier antipathy for the next to last Romero zombie flick, Land of the Dead. Land of the Dead actually had many things that Diary is lacking, such as:

* An adequate budget. Diary looks cheap and uses a lot of unconvincing CGI gore effects. The plot is designed to accommodate a scanty budget and so Diary lacks the panoramic epic feel that Land (and Dawn) had. The lack of money perhaps is linked to another deficiency of Diary vis a vis Land, mainly:

* Decent acting: the professional cast of Land added a lot to the movie's feel and narrative. The community theater rejects in Diary are both way too old for their parts and also incapable of portraying their characters convincingly. Particular scorn must be reserved for the Roy Scheider impersonator who plays the alcoholic film professor who tags along for the ride. He takes a bad part and makes things worse by his wooden delivery of his lines and general smirkiness. His sudden epiphany as bow-wielding hero and Yoda-esque wise man is more than a bit too much to accept.

Our lead ""hero"" Jason is such a wimpy passive voyeuristic jerk that one soon begins to root for his demise, and the idea of he and his movie girlfriend making a couple before the action in the movie is especially unconvincing.

* A coherent plot: the script of Land, though hardly Citizen Kane, at least had elements of narrative development and resolution of issues. Diary in comparison is a series of episodic vignettes, featuring encounters that are not especially interesting. A number of dull characters and scenarios are introduced for seemingly no logical reason, and the ending is both predictable and unsatisfying.

* More subtle political / social message: yes, believe it or not, even the ham-fisted community college adjunct professor Marxist polemic style of Land was more cleverly and elegantly done that Diary. Although the cartoonish human society shown in Land was both silly and blatantly hortatory, at least there weren't tedious talking head debates about the role of media in society and voice-over monologues about the narcissism of our decadent age, blah, blah, blah as happens repeatedly in Diary. Diary resembles a Critical Media Studies seminar with a few zombies thrown in, while Land was a zombie flick with some Marxist sentiment subtext.

* Action! Though Land was criticized by some as having too much action in it, the dull drab Diary in comparison is like watching paint dry. Combined with the skimpy budget, watered down gore, and episodic feel, Diary is unlikely to excite viewers expecting something along the lines of Night, Dawn, Land, or even Day. When Day of the Dead trumps your film in terms of action and suspense, you know you have trouble...

Sad to say, the themes that so fascinated Romero that he had to start the Dead series over are not especially compelling ones. Yes, we are all a society of passive voyeurs, manipulated by the media, prone to self-indulgent navel gazing even in the midst of apocalypse. The validity and narrative utility of these sentiments are open to debate, but the most damning criticism of Diary is that the Snyder Dawn remake addressed these same themes both more effectively and with greater efficiency. Snyder didn't need to spend the whole movie on this limited scope theme, taking just a few minutes of video cam footage to develop the exact same theme, and then besides addressing that concept, he also gave us a polished high production value looking film featuring a strong plot, mostly strong acting, other themes of interest, and lots of excitement and suspense. In comparison, Romero's re-imagining of his own universe seems bland, cheap, preachy, and uninteresting.

Like the mall zombies from Romero's original Dawn, Romero's new zombie film is a pale corpse of its former self, returning to its familiar haunts, but in a lethargic, lifeless, and empty manner. We can see glimpses of Romero's talents here as he is still a technically competent filmmaker, in terms of shot composition and cinematography. There are some interesting scenarios and supporting characters here (especially the deaf Amish farmer, who shows up all too briefly) but too many elements that are either retreads (usually inferior quality ones) of earlier Romero concepts seen in his other zombie films, or that are examples of frustrated Communications Theory Professor Romero channeling McLuhan, Postman, and Chomsky in ways that bore the hell out of the viewer. Romero fans will be disappointed, new zombie movie fans will wander what all the fuss over this guy was about, and non-horror movie fans will feel like they are watching a Sci Fi Channel original, only one that is less entertaining than usual.

Essentially Romero called for a do-over and then fumbled the ball... The game may be over for him, but let's wait and see.",1211846400,3,5157,4.918390804597701
2605585,1,B000GEAMD0,"Let me start by saying that I am a huge George A. Romero fan and I believe that Night of the Living Dead, Dawn of the Dead and Day of the Dead are like to horror movies what Star Wars is to sci-fi movies. But Diary of the Dead was a disappointment and clearly shows that this movie lacks vision and he has squandered a great chance to bring the zombie genre back out from the schlock of other poorly made direct to DVD zombie flicks that seem to pop up every year. The idea of a first person POV zombie film seems tailor made for George Romero's style of directing but he makes so many missteps that it is almost unwatchable. After reading other reviews I was hoping that it would compare to the opening sequence of the 2004 remake of Dawn of the Dead. The thought of having an entire film based on video clips of a world wide zombie invasion could have been an intense experience, but clearly he has forgotten what made the first three movies great: character development, plot momentum and GORE!(Not counting Land of the Dead, which also could have been much better but I defended nonetheless.)Since ""Land"" I have detected a downward trend in his writing and directing.

Firstly the actors are almost as lifeless at the dead themselves and there is no character development to make us care what happens to them. He should have kept the focus on the TV News crew from the beginning which would have made more sense and have had a reason to document the entire incident and be where the action is. Instead we follow a bunch of knuckle-headed college students trying to film their own horror movie and end up driving around backwoods Pennsylvania in a Winnebago constantly yammering about what's happening and where their friends took off to. And the English professor's character was a feeble attempt to inject social satire but comes of more like a creepy washed-up Shakespearean booze hound who for some reason likes hanging out with college students and prefers a bow and arrow to guns because it is more sporting or some such drivel.

Secondly is that there is no suspense whatsoever here (George telegraphs every scene so we know what's coming) and the film actually starts to lag in the last forty minutes. I found myself wishing for a full on zombie gore fest to get things moving and redeem this thing but sadly never materialized. It all seems clumsy and poorly thought out and the ending is just a mess. Don't let the DVD cover fool you, you never see more than maybe a handful of zombies at one time.

The only memorable things about Diary of the Dead is the idea of a heavily armed street gang waiting to take over the city after everyone else has evacuated was interesting and could have been expanded on but also wasted by continuing with the stupidly intrepid film-student storyline. Also the effect hydrochloric acid has on the undead was surprisingly disturbing even if it was CGI.

I used to think that George Romero and zombies were a can't miss kind of event. But after Land of the Dead and now Diary of the Dead I have come to the reservation that Mr. Romero, along with another director named George, have run out of new ideas and now seem to be going through the motions rather than still trying to be visionary. I think I will be taking a pass on Land of the Dead 2. Sorry George.",1211760000,4,3304,4.510851419031719

You could tell that he was on a smaller buget with this film. No name actors and 1990's style of effects made this less innovative then say ""Land of the Dead""  Great Movie!!!. This is not to say that it did not have it's moments. The Undead are in typical Romero form. Effects, other then the CGI where good and realistic. The characters were not over acting or over done. Good tongue and cheek humor. The downside was, since the actors were unknowns, it was hard to identify with any of them. When one got ate I did not feel bad for them. There was no sense of drama that gave his other films a element of seriouness to it. Same locations of rual Pennsylvania that were in his other movies. All in all if you are a Romero fan then this is good to add to your collection. But in a industry that is over saturated with zombies, we needed a movie that re-set that standard.

2605588,5,B000GEAMD0,"......in 1968 George Romero made a low-budget black and white zombie movie""Night of the Living Dead"" which is one of the scariest movies ever made.  He followed with ""Dawn of the Dead"" a few years later on a bigger budget in blood-drenched color and became one of the goriest splatter movies ever.  ""Day of the Dead"" and ""Land of the Dead"" followed but were not as good as the first two-but still contained the Romero gore.

Now comes ""Diary of the Dead"" and like some horror movies of late the story is told using a hand-held camera but Mr Romero thankfully has a steadier hand using this technique.  In fact he uses almost every camera device possible including a shoulder-held camera, a camera phone, internet blogs, news broadcasts and security cameras. He cleverly uses a few camera glitches from time to time but for the most part you can watch the movie without needing dramamine.

The movies start-off point is a group of students and their professor making a horror movie in the woods for extra credit. Once they realize something is wrong the rest of the movie is the usual fight for their lives from the ever increasing legion of zombies.  As expected the gore is plentiful mostly from shooting the zombies in their heads but fans of the zombie genre will not be disappointed and gladly Mr Romero has won back his crown an the premier auteur of the living dead movie.",1211673600,,1378,4.627049180327869
2605589,1,B000GEAMD0,"I just want to say that I love Romero and the original three movies (Night, Dawn, and Day) are still some of my favorite horror movies. When I first caught wind that ""Diary of the Dead"" was beeing made in a hand-held camcorder style, I got excited! The possibilities were endless. Images of potential storylines ran through my head and I couldn't wait to see the film. Needlees to say, the film hardly played in any theaters (was only available for one day near me, but I already had a prior engagement) so I was forced to wait for the dvd. On Tuesday, my time came.

It took me two attempts to finish this movie. I never quite felt sucked into the storyline or found the characters to be believable. As another reviewer had previously stated, they did not feel like ""real"" people. They were clearly actors, not very good ones, trying to act like they weren't acting.

Understanding full well that Romero always has a message in his movies, I was shocked at how blatant he made it in this film. I often felt awkward when a character would go off on some heavy-handed tangent about filming an incident instead of taking action, and then they'd stare into the screen as though I should ponder what they've just said. This stare would make me feel awkward for a few seconds, not because the message hit home, but because these performances are going to haunt their careers forever. I could easily see some of these actors/actresses in some of those ""The More You Know"" commercials.

The gore also was not present in this movie in the manner that you'd expect. Most of the classic effects were replaced by CGI, and not very good CGI at that. I think the same person that made the ""spiderman"" zombies for the Day of Dead remake might have done the special effects for this film.

Overall, the idea had potential but the execution was horrible. I feel as if something a little more ""Cloverfield"" in style would have been better. What if these students had been in class as the news reports rolled in? What if they'd had contact with their families and were told to stay put? Shots of bored college students in their dorms would be interrupted my screams across the campus. The confusion caused by the sudden appearance of zombies on campus would send everyone into a panic and trying to scramble away. Maybe the students could try and escape? Maybe they would barricade themselves in and keep a video diary? Maybe they'd only leave in order to collect food and supplies? I don't know. Just about anything could have been better than this film.  This felt too amateurish to be Romero.",1211500800,9,2577,4.5813449023861175

Marvelous and interesting installment of the legendary zombie series from George A. Romero is perhaps the best horror movie of the year! this is a very ""Blair Witch Project"" and ""Cannibal Holocaust""-esque movie that  takes the viewer on a terrifying and grisly journey through hell from the eyes of filmmakers in their point of view. This movie rivals this year's ""Cloverfield"" but this could be even better, there's plenty of suspense and graphic gore to satisfy fans of the genre and the franchise.

2605591,5,B000GEAMD0,"There seems to be alot of people who are unimpressed with Romero's latest zombie film. I think I know why. First off today's audiences don't know what a zombie is anymore (28 Days Later) and younger audiences are used to a differrent breed (zombies don't run). But that's not my point. Romero is the man who created zombies. Before 'Night' they were nothing but slaves. Then Romero created flesheaters. When the creator of an entire genre does a new version it is always worth seeing. So what if there's not as much gore as we're used to? There was no place it could be. So what if the characters aren't as engaging as we're used to? The story is the main thing. And that is the point. Romero is a great story teller. Especially when he doesn't have people telling him what to do.

So here's the deal. When the outbreak of zombies begins, a small group tries to get home. One of them decides to film everything that happens, this is the footage he shot. So be ready for hand held footage.

My only gripes have been adressed, and I understand them.
This is not your typical zombie film.",1211500800,,1085,4.42
2605592,1,B000GEAMD0,"I wanted to love this movie. I was very happy when i got the last copie at the H.M.V yesterday knowing that today i was off work +  the wife was not home. I closed the curtains, pop up the DVD and waited to be impressed once again by one of the best in the game mr Groege A. Romero. When i first heard of the script i got to say i was not convince that it would work and after watching this movie....it doesent ! Sorry George, i loved Dawn and i thought that Day was the best (night of the living was ground breaking at the time) and i really think of it as the trilogy of the dead. Land & Diary has nothing to do with them. Were is the good soundtrack (i miss goblin) ??  Were is the good F-X ??? (by the way cgi in this movie stinks and the gore .... i miss tom savini !!!) I can honestly say that i did not like one thing about this movie and glad that i paid 15$ only and im not anxious at all for Diary part 2 !

2605593,3,B000GEAMD0,"I love George Romero, as well as a majority of his films, with his Dead films being the highlights.  Despite its flaws, I enjoyed Land of the Dead for what it was, and I looked forward to Diary of the Dead, even though I wasn't too thrilled about hearing of the documentary/first person view film style that The Blair Witch Project and Cloverfield have made famous.  However, I figured if anyone could pull it off to any great effect, it would be Romero.  Sadly, Diary of the Dead ends up being a zombie film that would be great for any other director, but considering this is from the godfather of the zombie genre, it ends up being disappointing.  Following a crew of would-be film makers, Diary of the Dead gives a first person view of a zombie outbreak, and the chaos and carnage that follows.  Now Romero is no stranger to injecting social and even political commentary into his zombie flicks amongst all the blood and guts, and he does to decent enough effect, but it felt kind of overdone.  The cast, which is far from convincing, didn't do too much better, especially in a flick that is going for the documentary type of feel.  As previous reviewers have stated, they didn't come off as natural at all, and just as actors, which would be fine if this were any other type of film.  Also disappointing is the gore factor, most of which is now done by CGI effects.  They're good, but (and this is the zombie nut in me) there isn't enough of it.  Where Diary of the Dead works is that there are some moments of genuine suspense, the story is harrowing enough, and the film ends up being enjoyable for what it is.  All in all, Diary of the Dead could have been better than what we get, and while some will love it and some will definitely hate it, it is what it is, and it is a worthwhile trip for Romero and zombie fans.",1211500800,3,1824,4.351032448377581
2605594,2,B000GEAMD0,"I've mulled this over in my mind and have tried to hold off as long as possible. After reading the reviews here, some positive and some negative I feel that I can't hold out any longer.

Let me start off by saying YES, I'm a Romero fanboy. I'm also proud of that fact. I loved ""Bruiser"" even with its flaws. We here are all Romero fans, and just because you liked a movie that I didn't doesn't change that fact. We just have a difference of opinion. I originally hated ""The 9th Gate"" and watched it a few years later to find that I missed the point originally and now love it. Keep that in mind when reading my review.

Diary of the Dead feels rushed and is plain sloppy. Romero falling into the trap of writing a script with late teen early 20's characters is a huge disappointment. He had an amazing idea, but carried it out poorly. He tried to come at this movie from so many different angles that it never really finds itself.

On the FX. I didn't find the CGI horrible, however Romero's FX have always been amazing. It was disappointing to see him resort to the easy payoff like so many directors before.

*spoilers*

Maybe he should have revolved the story around the ebony warriors. He seemed to have something going there for a bit then let it slip through his fingers. They were interesting, organized and could have carried the movie further than the ""Scooby Gang"" minus a talking dog.

The portrayal of the Amish/Quaker guy was a complete miss. It's obvious Romero's never actually known one. The guy would have died faster than Ghandi before resorting to violence.

Where did everyone go? There were no bodies, no living people, not many zombies, so what happened to them all? I know where they went. They were waiting in the woods to surround the ""fortress"" at the end of the film.

Romero has always had a political agenda. Typically I've never really cared or minded. The earlier films are just too amazing to care. However with the release of ""Land of the Dead"" that agenda started to miss its target and become annoying.

Where the movie really fell apart (besides being pretty boring through out) was the last 20 minutes. When they realized that mummy man had killed one of the last members of their team why didn't they decide to investigate? The girl getting her top ripped off was a cheap move and one that Romero never had to resort to in his early ""Dead"" films. Don't get me wrong I love B films, but not ones that try to take themselves seriously.

Where did the girl from Texas run off to with little or no gas? That whole scene seemed to be tossed in for a little comedic value.

I can't call this horror, I can't call it campy, I can't call it suspenseful.

I rate a movie by its rewatch value and I can't see myself watching this one again. Even if I tried I know I wouldn't make it all the way through.

I feel that once the newness of this newest ""Dead"" release wears off it's true longevity will become more apparent. I just can't force myself to like this movie.

I'm glad it was a rental. Sorry George!",1211500800,2,3035,4.396428571428571

2605596,4,B000GEAMD0,"I enjoyed my Diary of the Dead experience.  I thought it was a thoughtful little storyline.  Some won't like it because it isn't wall to wall gore, blood and guts.  Some won't like it because there aren't screen-fulls of grunting zombies.  I thought it was a fine mix.  There are a few chuckles and a few ""ewwws"" to go with everything else.  There are quite a few special features on the DVD like a full length documentary, cast interviews and commntary track (and more).

A lot of reviewers are dogging the actors, but I thought they were pretty good.  Remember, this isn't a hundred-million dollar blowout.  George Romero indicated he originally wanted to do a direct to DVD movie so he could have complete creative control (which aparently he didn't have in Land of the Dead).  The Company said let's make it a low budget feature and it got very limited release.  I am in Texas and could never locate it in the entire state when it came out.

Lastly, whether people hate Diary of the Dead or love it right now doesn't really matter much as it will be the future when it will be considered a true classic or not.  I personally think it will go down as one of George Romero's top 2.",1211414400,,1183,4.421296296296297
2605597,2,B000GEAMD0,"As I get older and more individualistic I begin to realize that many of the movies I once thought were brilliant or underrated, I was in fact judging and looking at through zombie-bite colored glasses.
Such is the case with all of Romero's work, especially his last two installments in his zombie genre, Land of the Dead and his latest work Diary of the Dead.
I recognize that Land of the Dead wasn't a particularly good movie, but I must have seen it in the theaters at least 3 times nonetheless, I truly enjoyed the movie despite its misguided attempt at satiring President Bush.
I've come to realize that much of the ideas and political statements that Romero seeks to make with his films are for the most part juevenile at best.
No more so has this been more apparent than in Diary of the Dead (hence forth Diary).
I wouldn't call Diary a bad movie, so much as it is a very mediocre one, with little in the way of scares or real substance (the whole video documenting obsession idea has become something of a dated concept that I don't feel really needs to be commented on, or that at least Romero wasn't quite able to pull off what he was going for with it).
I think Romero would have been better off making a statement about something a little more relevant to everyone, like the energy crisis, terrorism/war etc. Any of those ideas would have been better than trying to comment on something as boring as video documentation obsession.
I also think that the whole idea of watching the movie through the lens of amatuer handhelds, while an interesting concept, wasn't executed to any great effect and really just kind of makes the thing a bore to watch. I think it's almost easier to dissasociate yourself from the film, even more so than it would be if it were shot in the traditional filmmaking manner, for me anyway.
At no point while watching Diary did I find myself buying into it or suspending my disbelief, whereas while watching Zack Snyder's Dawn of the Dead remake (which I feel is superior to almost all zombie films to date and is responsible for the recent revitalization of the zombie genre and Romero) I became engulfed in the story and action and found myself feeling for the characters and watching on the edge of my seat.
No such luck with Diary.
The verdict: Diary plays like as a decent b-movie, strives for more but fails terribly.

2605599,2,B000GEAMD0,"As a fan of Romero's past zombie films, I was pretty let down by ""Diary of the Dead"". It has three pretty significant flaws in my humble opinion.

1. No shock: Nothing new or even effective here in terms of scares, effects, or mood. In fact, it falls far short of ever conveying a sense of menace or threat to the cast. Once you've seen one take of fake intestines falling out of a corpse, really, you've seen them all, and we've seen all this before.

2. Fails to get the ""first person"" perspective: Like them or not, films like ""Blair Witch Project"" and ""Cloverfield"" succeeded, in my opinion, in creating a look that made you believe they were being filmed hand-held... that you were getting a live, ""as it happened"" view. ""Diary of the Dead"" drops the ball on this in many places. Dialogue is stilted and unnatural. The performances fail to convey the sense that they are living the events, and are pretty flat in general. The shots look too staged and lack any sort of visceral feel. While the narration indicates that the footage has been edited and had music added, the result is a poorly constructed mash of two styles. The narration, music, and edited shots ruin the first person feel, while the attempts at first person come off stiff and unnatural. All in all, really ineffective.

3. Just plain dull: First person pictures have to engender some suspension of disbelief to overcome the obvious thought ""why don't you drop the @#$%!! camera and run?"" The set up feels really contrived in this film... more so than others. The attempts at social commentary... e.g. government is trying to cover up what's really going on, hunters shooting zombies for fun... are ham-fisted, blunt, and feel tacked-on rather than part of an integrated theme. When the narrator actually asks ""Are we really worth saving?"" at the end, it was too silly for words. This was the kind of theme Romero put forth excellently in the original ""Dawn of the Dead"" without having a character blatantly cry out ""why do we destroy each other??""

The result is a pretty bland film, with uninteresting performances and boring gore effects. In the special features, Romero makes reference to going back to the original ""Night of the Living Dead"" with this film. Perhaps he should have done so more literally, 'cause that film still holds up as a masterpiece of terror.",1211414400,6,2341,4.71638141809291
2605600,2,B000GEAMD0,"Romero has been watching too many zombie movies. Yes, I know, that sounds a little weird, the man who practically invented the zombie movie, and who's masterpiece Night of the Living Dead has served as the inspiration for every undead film since is watching too many zombie films? Nonsense you say, crazy says another, what on earth makes me think that? Just look at the Romero of old, from the days of Dawn of the Dead and Day of the Dead and you'll notice that he doesn't rely on cheap tricks and logical inconsistencies to scare you. He's actually pretty straight forward when it comes to his scares. Here is a list of inconsistencies common to zombie films that Romero has seemed to pick up on.

1. Zombies don't hide and wait for people to stumble upon them to attack, they just attack. In two cases (maybe more but I can only remember two) the people and zombies were in the same building for about ten minutes before the zombies decided to come out of the closet and eat. This never happened in Romero's older movies (okay maybe it happened once in Dawn of the Dead), the zombies acted like zombies there, but in modern zombie films the zombies often times will seem to stalk their prey. Zombies don't hide from people and mount a surprise attack, they just attack.

2. Gory=scary. It doesn't. Gore is always good to have in a zombie movie, but when the gore replaces the scares then we have a problem. Romero's dead films have always been gory, from the comical attempt of Dawn of the Dead with the blue man group trying to break into a mall to Day of the Deads' rubber chicken mixed with pig guts. But both those movies also had a sense of dread going along with them. The unbeatable hordes of zombies, growing steadily every day, slowly breaking down your defenses, moaning for your flesh. Very creepy. Not here though. There is no mounting sense of dread. It's just gore, gore, and more gore.

A team of film students from the University of Pittsburgh are shooting a low budget horror film when news reports of the dead coming to life start coming over the radio. The group splits up but most end up going on a road trip across Pennsylvania to escape the growing number of undead who are roaming the countryside. Jason, the supposed leader of the group, takes it upon himself to film the disaster as it unfolds and put his video on YouTube so that hopefully people will see it and learn how to survive. The film should have been called ""Road Trip of the Dead"" because that's what it ends up being anyway. First they go here, run into zombies, kill a few and lose a member, only to hit the road again and repeat the process somewhere else, all while Jason films everything. Go here, kill zombies someone dies, go there kill some zombies someone dies. On and one and on and on.

The two biggest problems I found with the film though were the horrible acting, and the lack of believability with the documentary footage. There are no good actors in this film, with the exception of the professor who's drinking and preference to bows and arrows over guns was quite amusing. The narration is annoying and unnecessary, and the rest of the acting is either too much or too little, never the right amount. I found the character Jason to be especially annoying with his refusal to put down that stupid camera under any circumstances. Girlfriends little brother just tried to kill her? Don't help, film it. Zombie horde closing in? Don't help fix the van, film it. At one point one of the girls in the group is being chased by a zombie and he just follows them filming it, and lending no kind of help whatsoever. What a guy. If there are people like this I hope their first to be zombiefied. The film is shot on two hand held cameras documentary style much like Blair Witch Project and Cloverfield, but unlike those two films I never believed this was actually a documentary. It's different from those two films because not just the tape, it's edited and narrated, but even the parts which are just the guy filming don't have that documentary feel to it. It felt staged, scripted, not like a documentary should be. It never seemed like this was actual footage. That's what sets this film apart from other documentary style films.

The film had some pretty good ideas going for it, such as the road trip across undead America (all of Romero's previous films had the heroes held up in a fortress of some kind cut off from the outside world) and the news footage which really helped in showing just how the zombie plague was spreading. Got to say I loved the Amish guy who couldn't speak and who everyone thought was a zombie because he could only moan, even if he did just become cannon fodder. This film could have been really good, but alas it seemed like something a college student would make, not a seasoned veteran who's made lots of great films in the past. It was also pretty neat how Romero weaved in elements from Night of the Living Dead (he puts in part of the radio report from that film) and Dawn of the Dead (I didn't' see the guy with the camera filming that part in the apartment complex). The ending though was pretty lame.

I love Romero's films people, heck I even liked Land of the Dead, NO ONE liked Land of the Dead, except me, but even I couldn't give this movie anything more then two stars. I'm a pretty tolerant guy, but this isn't a good film, its preachy, not scary, and has some pretty major flaws.

The closing question this film asks is, are we really worth saving? Well I sure hope so, because if we aren't then nothing is.

2605602,5,B000GEAMD0,"Step one. Forget Land of the Dead. Terrible movie, and it could potentially turn you away from this film.

Step two. Read the following:

  Diary of the Dead is not a film about zombies. It could've been anything, honestly. A plague of rabid weasels, giant vultures, etc etc. The zombies ARE in the movie, but they serve mostly as a catalyst for human beings to react as they typically do, which is strangely and sometimes savagely.
  The film is portrayed as a final product of a group's experiences with the ""end of all things"". It reflects primarily on our current oversaturation with news, and how if we didn't see the clips on youtube, didn't see it on CNN or Fox News, it simply didn't happen.
  The film approaches another aspect of modern life, and that is how we numb ourselves to tragedy. We want to see it, but we aren't moved by it. This is especially true for many in light of what's going on in Iraq and even Myanmar.
  It also deals with how a personal quest for documenting everything can result ina  detachment from reality. It wasn't until after watching the movie that I realized the cameraman did what he did because it was a coping mechanism. There's also a very good scene near the end where it truly becomes apparent that the lines between reality and film have been blurred a bit.

Step three: Prepare to be frightened.

  This is still a horror movie, folks, and there are plenty of scary and particularly bloody sequences that occur. The anticipation is far more frightening than the actual events, and Romero does a great job keeping you on the edge of your seat.

I highly recommend this movie to horror fans, and those who like to be forced to think while watching. You can't avoid it. Something will be said in the movie, or done, that will make you reflect on how things really are. It's a Romero trademark.

Thank you, George Romero. I can now forgive you for your past transgressions.",1211328000,3,1917,4.542274052478134

But they are nearly always ahead of their time and eventually earns a well-deserved place in the hearts of horror fans.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Land-of-the-Dead/dp/B000B2YR7Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Land of the Dead</a>&nbsp;is still weathering criticism in spite of the fact that it raised issues of immigration years ahead of the political furor we're in the midst of now.

He pulls no punches, he bows to no one and he continues to make the most politically and socially defiant films of the horror genre.  There is not even a distant second: Romero is the zombie genre king and this film clinches it definitively.

""There's always an audience for horror; believable horror"" insists a character early in ""Diary"".  This sounds to me like Romero rebuking an industry that has made him fight for nearly every film he's ever made in spite of his many successes.  And, of course, he's entirely correct.  The fixation this time is on the power, futility, and dehumanizing effect of media in our society.  The drunken, war veteran British professor who accompanies our college student zombie chow during their tour of Romero's newest undead apocalypse reminisces about Orson Welles' fateful broadcast of ""War of the Worlds"" that famously caused panic in the streets.  He notes that that was but a single radio broadcast; nowadays we get it 24-7 from every angle.  The media has the power to cause mass hysteria over nothing and to minimize the most heinous of atrocities simply by controlling what people see.  ""If it didn't happen on camera, it's like it didn't happen, right?"" says the amateur documentarian's girlfriend sarcastically; disgusted with his obsession with filming the death of society.  When people see a horrific scene they don't stop to help, they stop to look, she states plainly while musing on the nature of mankind's morbid, voyeuristic obsession with death.  These moments are the heart and soul of this film.  The centerpiece of every film in this series has not been the zombies, but the humans' suicidal behavior that divides and allows the plague of animated corpses to conquer.

That is not to say that Romero forgot to bring the fun.  Ever seen a deaf Amish bada$z kick some zombie tail?  How about eyes popping out a head being zapped with a defibrillator?  The kills here are (as always) outstanding and the characters have some amusing moments as well.  The aforementioned British professor actually seems to enjoy performing for the camera and there is a great bit where a pair who were acting out a horror scene at the film's opening do a second take, but for keeps.  The conclusion of the scene is an impromptu one-liner complete with corny music added for effect.  Cheesy, but I laughed.

As a horror film fan and a mean-spirited bastard fed up with mainstream media and the incessant dumbing-down of our society this was much more than a breath of fresh air for me.  This was CPR.  The internet gives us unprecedented power to get the truth out or see it for ourselves and put a middle finger in the face of those who think we should only see what they wish us to see.  Romero brought his A-game this time and I hope you guys will do the same when you watch ""Diary of the Dead"" because few films of any genre speak the truth like Romero's classics.  Count this among them.",1211328000,6,4547,5.516594516594517
2605604,4,B000GEAMD0,"Diary of the Dead is the fifth instalment of George A. Romero's zombie legacy.

We all know how it started, way back in the late 60's with his - at the time - extremely controversial movie, Night of the Living Dead.

From that horror classic, his legend grew. Some people think that with each instalment, his movies got worse, some feel the opposite.

Me, I'm simply a fan.

I've never been a huge fan of horror, with only a couple of notable exceptions. I'm even less a fan of gore. I guess it's the fact that I'm just getting old, and with modern technology, making gore seem more realistic, and thus, horrific, I just can't stomach it any more.

The nice thing about Diary of the Dead, is that the gore isn't over the top. It is there, believe me, but it's nothing that I haven't seen before on regular television.

No, I'm not kidding. I've seen worse on some medical shows.

Is Diary yet another social commentary or is it just a film made for fun? Personally, I believe it's a bit of a commentary on just how accessible information is today, with more and more computers being accessed not only in North America, but globally.

I believe that it is also a commentary on how the media takes news and puts its own spin on things, hiding the truth, changing the truth.

Can, by the media changing what it films, cost lives?

I think that is the basic message behind the movie - that and for pure entertainment value of course.

And the answer is yes. If the media changes things, puts its own spin on a story, vital information could be twisted or changed, or left out completely.

Thus, misinformation could very well cost lives.

A call for the media to change its way. And a bit of an invitation for armatures to continue to film what they see and post it online for others to see. That is until the government or others who control the media get to it and force it off the web.

Right now, I wonder what a person such as myself might be able to find on the whole earthquake in China, or that Typhoon that wiped out so many lives in Miramar.

Makes one think, doesn't it?

Also, it deals with obsession, in this case, one that is to the point it could be considered an insanity. With what happened in the movie, it's not a big surprise, really.

Anyhow, enough of my own social commentary.

The movie was wonderfully done! It had the feel of a amateurish production, being shot through handheld cameras, but at least it didn't make me motion sick to watch, like a movie I enjoyed earlier this year called Cloverfield.

And, the movie takes place right at the beginning... right as the rising began. Even the first shot of the dead rising being caught on film. It was pretty intense to watch, despite the fact that I knew what to expect.

Of course it also showed how quickly civilization could crumble under something totally unexpected, and where the media has been twisted to the point that nothing but misinformation is getting out.

Thus costing lives that could have otherwise been saved.

As with any major disaster, the other thing that I really enjoyed about the movie was how it brought out not only the worst in people, but the best.

You'll see what I mean with a gang, and with the military.

For myself and my wife, the movie wasn't scary. Intense, oh, yes... but scary? Nah, I've seen far worse. My son - well, he's only thirteen and he was a little scared watching it, but again, he's seen worse and it hasn't bothered him.

Hell, some of the gore in Shaun of the Dead was worse than what was depicted in this movie!

Ok, now for the special features. You have the required commentary with writer / director George A. Romero, director of photography Adam Swica, and editor Michael Doherty. There is also a very long feature called For the Record, a documentary on the film's cast, crew and creation.

There is a featurette called The Roots, which is the inspiration for the movie, The First Week, which is a visit on the set, Familiar voices, out-takes with the various people who had cameos, and Character Confessions.

Finally, there were 5 short zombie films from a contest held on my space.

A really excellent film, one of the more enjoyable DVD's I've watched in a long time. I just wish it would have gotten wider release earlier this year.

2605605,2,B000GEAMD0,"I never thought I'd see the day when I wrote a negative review of a George Romero zombie movie, but that day I never thought I'd see has come. Diary of the Dead easily rates as the biggest cinematic letdown for me. Upon hearing Romero was doing another Dead flick I was quite excited. I wasn't expecting a masterpiece, but I was expecting an enjoyable movie, but what I got was mostly poor with some good moments.

George Romero made his feature debut in 1968 with Night of the Living Dead and when Diary of the Dead got it's theatrical release it's almost 40-years since his debut; so right there you can't expect Romero to be the filmmaker he was in his prime, but the problem is with Diary of the Dead he's not even half the filmmaker he once was. A lot of people felt Land of the Dead was a letdown and while I can't say I disagree at the end of the day Land of the Dead was alright and I suppose that was the problem. Romero was a filmmaker who reached a level of greatness most filmmakers can only dream of having and with Land of the Dead he was just hanging onto that; Diary of the Dead is by a filmmaker far past his prime.

The one thing I always loved about Romero's movies was his characters; he's an excellent writer who created such great characters with so much depth. The screenplay for Diary of the Dead was simply poor. The characters were terrible! They were rather annoying with no depth at all. Diary of the Dead is one the type of movie that you'll be hard pressed to remember the names of any of the characters and that's never a good thing.

Debra played by Michelle Morgan was the only character that was fairly decent, but she's mostly just poorly written for and lacks any depth that it's hard to feel anything for her.

The concept for Diary of the Dead is nothing short of brilliant, but the execution was way off. The comedic elements don't work at all there's nothing really funny about them. The only part I found funny is when one character is explaining why the dead don't run. Besides that the comedy was very weak. George Romero is one of my favorite writers, but Diary of the Dead was just lacking I felt the screenplay was poor with very little good about it.

As director George Romero doesn't fair any better; The first 3 Dead movies has such amazing suspense and tension and always had this feel of dread and even despite the flaws Land of the Dead also featured some of that even if not as solid. But here there was no suspense or tension and the feel of dread was never around. Diary of the Dead really could have been made by any DTV filmmaker. Besides the social commentary there really isn't anything Romero about this movie; I don't know maybe it's me, but Diary of the Dead feels like a movie by a guy who's seen Night of the Living Dead one too many times.

Quite honestly there were a lot of moments that borderline on poor filmmaking. Several scenes are meant to be a little campy, but there's almost this feel of unintentional comedy at times. And even if some of these moments were meant to be light it doesn't work and comes out rather poor.

The acting takes a lot of heat, but while the acting was weak it's not as bad as it's made out to be. But it does hurt the film in some spots. At times it's a bit hard too take anything too serious since the actors while not terrible, but just aren't strong enough to pull off the more dramatic moments.

What I did however like about Diary of the Dead is the documentary like feel it has going for it. That's why I said earlier the concept was nothing short of brilliant, but the execution was just way off. I might be a little too harsh on Diary of the Dead, but I expected a lot more from George Romero. Maybe in time I'll grow to like this movie, but as of now I can easily say this is my least favorite of all of Romero's Dead movies.

In closing, Diary of the Dead isn't terrible despite my review, but it's really not very good at all. Again maybe in time I'll grow to like it, but upon my first viewing while there were some good moments they are few and far between.",1211241600,3,4072,4.250645994832041
2605606,5,B000GEAMD0,"George Romero's latest zombie epic Diary of the Dead is his fifth in the living dead series and it, like it's predecessors is outstanding. Romero is back at the top of his game with this entry. He hasn't been this good since Dawn of The Dead(and I'm talking about the original not the horrid remake). I loved every minute of it from the brilliant opening scene to the last minute. While I loved both Day of The Dead(again the original people), and Land of The Dead, this should have been the 3rd movie. I loved the documentary type feel and the over the top gore. The zombie's are once again slow moving(the way they should be, you dumbass dawn of the dead remake idiots). I loved the way they used a radio broadcast from the original Night of The Living Dead) which makes me wonder if this takes place at the same time that night was. Zombie lovers rejoice, George Romero's Diary of The Dead is a masterpiece.",1211241600,3,910,4.4226190476190474
2605607,2,B000GEAMD0,"As a longtime Romero fan I've been anticipating this release for quite a while, and I have to say this movie makes Land of the Dead seem like a masterpiece. How this movie has been getting the rave reviews I've been reading is beyond me. It's filmed really well but all that is completely destroyed by atrocious acting. The documentary style comes off as really corny and it just seems really unoriginal to me. And the satire? Don't get me started.

Tips to Romero if he decides to make another entry in the series:

- GO BACK TO BLACK AND WHITE!!!!!
- Ditch the teen actors!!!!
- No more GGI!!!!!

I'm gonna go cry now.",1211241600,6,620,4.373913043478261
2605608,4,B000GEAMD0,"First off I'm a huge George Romero and zombie fan, and had to at least see this movie one time. The premise sounded really cool (people documenting the zombie uprising using hand held cameras), but I was worried that it was going to be disappointing because of some of the reviews I'd read. A lot of people who liked Romero's other Dead movies didn't like this movie, saying that Romero was past his prime, that the acting and dialogue were bad, that it hit you over the head with its social commentary and it was preachy, and that there was annoying music and narration over the whole movie. I'm writing this review for the people like me who are fans of Romero and zombie movies but are put off by some of the reviews, and to tell them not to worry. This is a good movie.

It's probably my third favorite after Night of the Living Dead, Dawn of the Dead, and Land of the Dead (I liked this better than Day of the Dead). And yes it is flawed, but not as flawed as some of the reviews are saying, and I had an enjoyable time watching it. No, I'm not a Romero apologist either. Though I'm a fan of his Dead series he's made some clunkers too. I didn't really like Bruiser, for instance. I also like intelligent horror movies. I care more about telling a good story than I do about blood and guts and fast cuts.

The narration which I thought I would hate doesn't actually run over the entire movie. I thought there would be this running monologue explaining what was going on as if we couldn't just watch the movie ourselves. But it's only every once in a while and it usually moves the story forward. For example, after a sequence is done the narrator might come on and say ""Over the next couple days we watched the story develop on the news..."", and as she's talking it'll show news clips of how the dead are taking over. She doesn't talk over any of the action or dialogue. In fact, I actually liked the narration. I thought the documentary style was what set this movie apart from Blair Witch and Cloverfield. I also didn't think it was preachy or heavy handed either. I thought it was ""just right"" and it added commentary to the movie.

That said, there were a few times where the dialogue between the characters themselves got a little preachy, most noticeable in the hospital scene. And I thought sometimes the way they acted wasn't very realistic. For example, every time someone was in danger and Jason (the guy behind the camera) just stood there and kept filming. It gets explained later on that the media is distorting everything and that's why making this movie is so important to him, but still I didn't find it very realistic. Especially in the hospital scene where he's standing there waiting for his camera to recharge while he can hear his friends screaming in the background, and he's not even like ""hurry!"" And when they hear the first news reports at the beginning of the movie, everybody's just like ""oh, shouldn't we get out of here?"" If it were me I'd be glued to the TV like ""NO WAY! ZOMBIES?!?! Can this be REAL?!?!?""

Also, the music is a little annoying because again it isn't very realistic. The narrator says she added music because ""I am trying to scare you...so maybe you don't repeat the mistakes we made."" What mistakes??? I would have been fine with music over the parts where the narrator cuts in and starts showing news clips of what's going on in the rest of the world, but it makes no sense to add music to the scenes where people are dying.

Those are my only problems with the movie. And it may seem like a lot, but I thought the movie really took off in the second half and I was sitting on the edge of my seat and really getting into the story. I thought the movie was flawed and could have been a 5 star movie with some polishing, but on the whole I enjoyed it. There's voice cameos by Stephen King, Guillermo Del Toro, Simon Pegg, and Quentin Tarantino. There's references to Romero's earlier Dead movies. At one point in the movie, the characters are actually listening to the one of the news broadcasts from Night of the Living Dead. There's an intelligent commentary, some good looking zombies, it has elements from Romero's world like a gang of looters and corrupt officials, and this is the first Romero zombie movie where the characters are actually out in the open the entire movie, not boxed up somewhere with the zombies outside trying to get in.",1211241600,3,4399,4.446096654275093
2605609,4,B000GEAMD0,"There is an audio commentary by writer/director George A. Romero, director of photography Adam Swica, and editor Michael Doherty. They kick things off, rather fittingly, with how they pulled off the challenging prologue sequence. Romero points out that most of the cast were stage actors and this allowed the filmmakers to shoot fast and a lot of pages in a day. Romero frequently mentions the creative freedom he had on this film. Most of the time is spent talking about the nuts and bolts of filmmaking on this informative track.

""Character Confessionals"" features several characters from the film talking about themselves for Jason's documentary within the film. However, they then to ramble on about trivial details that quickly becomes tiresome.

""The First Week"" takes a brief look at the first week of principal photography with some nice footage on location with intentionally cheesy, cheerful music.

""The Roots"" has Romero giving a quick introduction about what inspired this film and how it differs from his other zombie films.

""Familiar Voices"" identifies three of famous friends of Romero that lent their voices to the various newscasts in the background of scenes.

""For the Record"" consists of five featurettes documenting the making of the film. There is a nice profile of Romero where the cast and crew praise him. To his credit, the veteran filmmaker is his usual, charming self. The members of the cast are interviewed and talk about working with Romero and about their characters. Legendary make-up artist Gregory Nicotero takes us through the film's gore effects and how they did them. Some of these effects were enhanced digitally as the next featurette demonstrates. Finally, there is a look at the film's hand-held camerawork and the production design.

""Myspace Contest Winners"" features the five short films that won the Myspace contest. They are all pretty good, including one done by Teller of Penn and Teller fame.",1211155200,3,1945,5.158730158730159
2605610,5,B000GEAMD0,"I enjoyed this film immensely and really was ""in the moment"" so to speak.  I felt the filming was better done than most of this type and like the less jerky movement as well as the different angles.  I felt the acting was good and believable, although I wanted to KILL that camera man for not helping!!  GRRR!  I really liked the message about people believing what they hear and not trusting themselves and what they see.  Totally buying into what we are fed and believing what we are told to believe.  Truthfully a good zombie movie isn't so much about the zombies, but about the PEOPLE and how they deal with said situation.  I like the part about whether we are worth saving or not....makes me ponder and keeps me thinking after the film...which I like my favorite films to do!

I wanted to write a review the minute I heard some of the stupid, inane, fodder spouted by people who know no better, but I wanted to wait until I had actually SEEN the new Romero film.  First let me say this is the BEST film of this genre bar none...I mean come on....George Romer = BRILLIANCE and this was no exception.  It was fantastically done....all I can say to the people who are being SO disrespectful to George is the following:

Unless you have the brilliance, recognition, and talent he does, I would suggest not being so judgemental of his work...you have no right.

While everyone won't like this film, that is OK, everyone can have their opinion.  What they can't have is disrepect for the father of this genre.",1211068800,6,1509,4.483516483516484
2605611,4,B000GEAMD0,"I am a huge fan of zombie movies. In fact not 2 months ago I got the original cast and Romero himself to sign my Diary of the Dead movie poster (YEAH BABY!!) I finally got to watch it for the first time last week. I really enjoyed it. It had some great and amusing scenes in it. The only problem is I am not a fan of the whole first person view through this college kids camera. But, other than that I would recommend this to any fan of zombie movies.",1210291200,,451,3.9130434782608696
2605612,3,B000GEAMD0,"When a friend comes up to you and tells you he has something for you but the only way you're going to get it before he watches it, is for you to rub his feet and suck on his big toe, you just know he has something good. I laughed and asked him ""Come on man... just tell me what it is."" He tells me, ""I got a copy of Diary of the Dead...sup.""

After gargling some mouthwash and wiping my mouth, I stuck Diary of the Dead into my laptop with Zombie glee pouring out my brraaaainnnss. The film begins with one of the best opening scenes to a zombie movie in my opinion. A new cast is filming a gruesome murder scene, to only witness the dead rise and begin to attack. When the lady zombie gets up, you can see her eyes fixated on the camera man from the start, but he's looking at another zombie mainly and sometimes you can see the female getting closer and then BAM in your face. And she looks wicked thanks to the zombie makeup that does not go over the top.

We then come across some college students (our main attraction) who are filming what I'm pretty sure is a low budget Mummy movie. During a break to fix makeup, they learn about how the dead are rising. Whether it's real or not, everyone decides to go home. Two head to the `Mummy's' house (more like mansion), the rest decide to go get the director's g/f and then everyone at once head to their parents houses which are, thankfully, on the way to someone else's parents house. While on the road, they are basically safe, but it's during the stops that the troubles begin.

The story was great and the zombies were fantastic. I can see what Romero was doing here and I totally enjoyed it, but there were things that just really bothered me about the movie and I'll got into a little detail for them

1. The acting was atrocious. The movie is supposed to be filmed like a documentary, but the acting seemed like acting. None of it had a real feel to me. I saw actors, trying to act like, they weren't acting. And bad acting doesn't bother me, it's just the fact that it kept taking me out of what I was supposed to be feeling, and that was that I was watching a documentary.

2. The camera. The documentary feel doesn't bother me. I liked how Cloverfied was filmed because I KNEW that it was supposed to FEEL like a documentary. And that's what it felt like. This though felt more staged. To me Diary felt more like a videogame the way it was filmed. Like I was watching a rail camera.. It felt like HUD was actually behind the camera in Cloverfield. Jason Creed, well, he felt more like a camera machine and not a human. Yeah I'm sure this helped a lot with the shaky camera problem that a lot of people hated about Clovefield and made them run out to get Dramamine pills for, but it took away from the REALNESS that I believe Romero wanted for the movie. What I meant about the rail camera above was that it felt like certain scenes were choreographed to give us a scare or put action into the scene. Sure I know ALL scenes in ALL movies are choreographed, but they don't FEEL like it. Hopefully you get what I'm saying, I might be having trouble trying to explain it.

3. CG was used. I couldn't believe this. On little things such as gunshots to the head cg was used. Blood splatter from the back of the head was CG. That really pissed me off cause I hate when CG is used for things that special effects artists can CLEARLY make look better with actual real life blood packets and whatever other cool gadgets they got. There was one scene where the CG was used correctly and looked really good and it involved acid. Sure we've seen acid scenes before with make-up effects or whatever, but this looked really good. But it doesn't make up for the other countless CG effects that could've been easily done the good old fashioned way.

4. The editing on some scenes made me scratch my head in befuddlement. I get the fact that Romero is giving us a lesson on how we are using camera, phone cameras, whatever else is out there gadget wise, to film everything around us now. But I don't need that to ruin a good scene for me. In one part, the Winnebago the crew is driving, runs over a group of zombies. Well right when we are getting ready to see a nice scene, the camera switches over to one of the camera phones somebody was using. So we don't get the good sound or video we were witnessing. It goes to a very crappy looking and sounding shot of these zombies getting run over. I was pissed at that.

In the end, I get the message. The media. The constant updating of OUR lives. The youtubes and MySpaces. The car wreck syndrome. The `not really being there feel' when you are behind the camera. I get it. But when I'm watching a zombie movie, I'm watching it for the zombies first and..well..second. The message can go in there somewhere also, but I REALLY could care less. I want my carnage. I want my blood. I want my gore. I want my feel of hopelessness. I got what I wanted, but I honestly think Romero could've done better. Will I watch this again? Hell yes. It's better than a LOT of the zombie movies out now. I will own it also and spend the extra dough on the blu-ray version as well. I think EVERYONE should at least rent it and give it a try. Just don't going in it's going to be blockbuster quality because it's just not... in my opinion.

To my zombie and gore friends, please don't hate me for giving this 3 stars... lol. I just have to rate it how I feel.

P.S. The scene looking out of the barn via the camera was very cool looking.",1210118400,24,5508,4.2371428571428575
2605613,4,B000GEAMD0,"After all these years...

1) ACTING: I thought the acting was really good for a ""low budget indie."" I felt that the relatively lesser and completely unknown actors added to the movie's realism, because I really think if there was a ""name,"" it might've distracted from the movie. All the actors were competent and comfortable in their roles, and I had no problem with any of them...well except for the Texan lady. She seemed a little forced upon viewing the movie again.

2) PRODUCTION: As usual, Romero shows how much can be done with little money. While some viewers will not like the hand held camera type of filming, it does add to the tone of the movie and I think it is done well. The Blair Witch Project used similar tactics, but (in my opinion) often there were many scenes that were almost unviewable due to the rapid movement of the camera. Romero keeps the scenes well under control. Romero also has successfully combined the usual high quality film making with the social commentary and our beloved zombies (along with some great zombie kills!)

3) ZOMBIES: What can I say? These are the wonderful Romero zombies that we have all grown to love.

4) THE CAUSE: Let's see...what was the cause in 1968's NotLD? (you all should know this!)

5) NUDITY: None.

FINAL:
What can I say? Many people have put Romero on a pedestal with his zombie movies. Some have said this was a sad swansong for him, others have praised him for showing he still has what it takes. To each his / her own. I saw what I wanted to see. A zombie movie made by George Romero. I really don't watch zombie movies lookin' for Shakespearean drama. I enjoyed this movie a lot, and it is nice to see that Romero still ""has what it takes"" to crank out another zombie opus.

RATING: 4.5 out of 5",1209513600,3,1767,4.468944099378882
2605614,4,B000GEAMD0,"'Diary of the Dead' is the latest of George A Romero's zombie films, which always seem at least a cut above his competitors'. This time around, Romero's taken the novel approach of working with the basic premise of 'Night of the Living Dead' and remixes it within our You Tube-happy pop culture. I was very surprised to see such a fresh, contemporary take on the Living Dead coming from one of modern horror's Old Guard.

This is a horror movie that gets better as it progresses. At first, I didn't like it much at all. But within 20 minutes, I did. I appreciate that Romero's largely unknown cast of actors play clever and plausible characters (unlike the way most horror movies portray college students as mindless morons). The satire and social satire are heavy-handed at times, but that's part of what you're buying into when you see a Romero zombie film (and its something missing in most horror films). The gore effects are exceptionally well done, and the film nicely captures the look and feel of 'amateur' video that ends up on the web. There aren't a lot of sudden shocks in this movie; instead there is a growing feeling of despair and dread. By the time the film was over, I felt exceptionally uneasy - which is exactly the way that Romero wants us to feel after his movies.

This isn't my favorite 'Dead' movie - but each Dead movie is a different beast from the others. If you're looking for an exceptionally up-to-date Romero film, this one's for you.",1208649600,,1466,4.6130268199233715
2605615,5,B000GEAMD0,"Let me just start by saying that ""I LOVED THIS MOVIE""!!  As much as I enjoyed ""Land"" it still just wasn't up to snuff when compared to Romero's original trilogy.  Finally after the ""B Movie"" zombie craze has run it's course & done it's damage, comes ""Diary"".

  Diary is a refreshing return to the beginning of the undead plague now set in modern times.  Romero this time around perfectly sets his satirical views on our society's constant need & addiction for up to the minute news & media.  As not to spoil anything (not to mention all the other reviews beating the plot to death already), the movie is basically about a group of film students who decide the film the events of the outbreak as they unfold around them.  Now I must admit, it's a little hard to swallow that even the die hardest of die hard film maker would really keep the camera rolling through alot of the events that take place, but it certainly made for an entertaining movie.  Did these people that blasted the movie for that same reason not know what they were getting into I wonder?

  As far as the acting's, it's all grade A stuff as far as I'm concerned much better than your average horror amatuer schlock.  Basically just don't go into the movie expecting ""The English Patient"" & I think you'll be fine.  True alot of the film revolves around the cast talking about what's happening around them, & there aren't copses in every frame of the movie but that's character development.  Would you expect anything else from Romero?

The effects as with any Romero film are again outstanding & we loose alot of the corney CGI stuff scene in ""Land"".  There are truely some great new imaginative gags.  Ever wonder how a defibulator would fare as a weapon against a flesh eating corpse?  You'll find out :P.  The documentary style of shooting really gives the film an extra creepy feel.  You feel a little less safe watching the movie.

  Why Diary wasn't given a wide theatrical release is absolutely mind boggling.  This is a breathe of fresh air compared to the rest of the remade, PG-13, direct to video, amatuer hour, garbage being churned out by Hollywood these days.  What else can I say, great atmosphere, great cast, grade A horror from the STILL master of horror himself, George A. Romero.  Any true fan of horror owes it to themselves to watch this movie.

The idea is really great =)  Some film students working on a crappy B Movie are out filming their stuff for school when everything starts going bad and they take their film equipment and show you their story =)

I would give this movie a 10/10 if the people in it could act better, but I rate it so highly because it was SOOOO fun to watch!  Romero keeps things fresh with new ways to mess with and kill the zombies too =)  In the hospital scenes everything is keeping you on your toes and they off some zombies with some really cool ways

I really liked just about everything in this.  Even the deaf Amish guy added a really nice touch =)  The gang of hoodlums was a little out of place, especially with the way they entered the film, but added an interesting touch and some funny and odd dialogue =)

There were about 5 times when I thought the flick was over but it kept going and I was really happy about that =)  I've become so used to other movies just dropping you off with what seems about half way through and not finishing the WHOLE story - This kept going and going and each scene really added to the whole experience =)

I believe Romero was trying to go back to a more stripped down production, which is fine. What isn't fine is the complete lack of empathy or regard I feel toward any of the characters. I couldn't care if they lived or died, and I don't remember that about the zombie films before. There was always at least someone (or some situation, like in Day of the Dead) that I could relate to. Plus, in the movies before you had some deeper allegory going, that seems to be completely non-extistent for this film (one of the most devastatingly daunting things ABOUT this film, in fact).

Even Surviving the Dead (an overall just ""good"" movie, but certainly better than this) had some depth to it with the warring factions, the setting was a bit more imaginative, etc. This runs through more like an independent film with a decent budget for effects. The music is okay.
