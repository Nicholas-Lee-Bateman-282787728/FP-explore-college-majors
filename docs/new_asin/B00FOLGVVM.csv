6016443,4,B00FOLGVVM,"C.M. Punk vs. The Shield - Punk attempted to use different strategies early on such as avoiding their corner & playing ""cat & mouse"" attempting to avoid double & triple teaming attempts only with taking huge impactful moves such as Roman Reigns' spear to the point where Punk used Reigns momentum against him that caused his eye to heavily swell & having the ringside doctor look at it for several minutes throughout the match allowing Punk to ""divide & conquer"" the rest of The Shield by trying to focus on one member in the ring while keeping the others outside of it. I'll give this match credit in that it was better than expected based off the handicap stipulation alone but told a good story throughout the match & had good wrestling as well.

Divas Champion A.J. Lee vs. Natayla - Natayla focused on A.J.'s arm in the early moments with various armdrag & armbar takeovers before the match got taken onto the floor with the barricade & ring apron taking some hard hits with A.J. focusing on Natayla's head with kicks & front facelocks as the girls traded momentum with moves & submission attempts. This was the best divas PPV match in sometime as they gave a good back & forth match.

Intercontinental Champion Big E. Langston vs. Damien Sandow - Langston showed that he had the power advantage early on causing Sandow to attempt to take that power advantage away grounding him & taking his legs out while Big E. still attempted to use his size & power to his advantage. This was a solid match that did it's job but was really no different than what you've seen on regular TV for weeks up to this point in showcasing who it was designed to do.

Elimination Match: WWE Tag Team Champions Goldust & Cody Rhodes vs. Big Show & Rey Mysterio vs. Real Americans vs. Ryback & Curtis Axel - You got exactly what was expected seeing not just how many but all the names involved here with such moments as Big Show repeatedly chopping the hell out of one of his opponents, a participant being a sore loser after his elimination, one team taking advantage of various situations caused by other teams, Goldust's ""Slammy Award Winning"" performance that he's had all year, not just one but a double knockout, and when it got down to the final two teams. This was a great match with sequences & near falls that kept your attention from start to finish.

R-Truth vs. Brodus Clay - Truth had Xavier Woods in his corner while Clay had Tensai & the Funkadactyls in his with Brodus dominating truth with his superior size & being more aggressive like he has in the past month than he ever was before including using one of Yokozuna's offensive moves to the point where J.B.L. referenced Ox Baker of all people but made it clear he was out to punish & humiliate Truth more than just win the match to the point where Tensai was yelling at him to just pin him before getting into a verbal fight with his partner. This was just here to further push the issues that Clay had with not just Truth & Woods but also how it was effecting his partnership with his Tons Of Funk teammates as well.

No Disqualification: Kofi Kingston vs. The Miz - I believe this is the third time they've feud in WWE over the years (over the U.S. title & around a year ago for I.C. title) with this match coming together after a brawl earlier in the night when Kofi confronted Miz on the PPV panel as both men started off trading punches before the match got eventually taken to the floor with both men taking advantage of the ringside surroundings like the ring post & barricade as they traded momentum with each man taking up level of aggression. I'll give them credit in that they attempted to be more physical & aggressive than they usually are but it's a case where the ""No DQ"" stipulation seemed irrelevant as not one man really took advantage of that outside of the brawling on the floor to the point where the crowd was chanting ""Boring"" in what was nothing more than just a solid encounter.

Daniel Bryan vs. The Wyatt Family - The numbers game caught up to Bryan very early as Rowan & Harper just beat Bryan down with power moves & brawl tactics such as tossing him up & around like a rag doll while Bray kept attacking him mentally with his taunts not just physically that got a response from the fans of ""That Was Creppy!"" but also verbally telling him ""We could have been friends!"" before Bryan was able to get some offense in with top rope maneuvers along with using the environment around him such as the ring ropes, announce table, and steel steps. This was a completely different handicap match than earlier before as it was more character driven but still an good performance from all men involved.

T.L.C. Match: World Champion John Cena vs. WWE Champion Randy Orton - You saw the effect of the match stipulation early when a ladder was rammed into Orton that caused him to show heavy pain in his elbow with the action not letting up from there with such highlights as both men delivering chairshots across the body, more weapons used including the ringside steps & microphone & handcuffs, trademark maneuvers delivered off the ladder, and bodies going through tables. This was the type of match expected from this stipulation as they used plenty of weapons, physical brawling, some hard hitting spots, and intense action from start to finish with the CLEAN non-controversial finish we haven't had in months.

This was easily the best overall PPV effort from WWE since SummerSlam so it's an event I would check out.",1388188800,3,5490,4.560851926977688
6016444,5,B00FOLGVVM,"On the 12th day of Christmas 2013 I'm going to review...WWE Tables,Ladders & Chairs 2013. The Shield-CM Punk-3-on-1 Handicap match was strong and surprisely back-and-forth for that type of bout. The Divas title match between AJ Lee & Natalya was nice but I wish WWE gave them more time. The Intercontinal title match between Big E Langston & Damien Sandow while better off on RAW,it was still a good bout. The 4 way elimination match for the Tag Team titles(Cody Rhodes & Goldust vs The Real Americans vs Ryback & Curtis Axel vs Big Show & Rey Mysterio Jr) was fantastic with everybody giving their all. The Brodus Clay-R-Truth match was nothing but filler. The NO DQ match between The Miz & Kofi Kingston was boring but solid. The Wyatt Family-Daniel Bryan-3-on-1 Handicap match was also strong and surprisely back-and-forth. The TLC match for both the WWE & Worlds title between Randy Orton & John Cena was a hardcore,smash-mouth,hard-hitting & entertaining brawl. I give this PPV a 9 out of 10.",1387929600,,997,4.83625730994152
6016445,5,B00FOLGVVM,"In my opinion every match on this was at the very least decent.  This wasn't the best PPV of the year, but far and away the best since Summerslam.  No screwy finish plus a solid undercard makes it worth watching.  Even the divas match was quite good.  The highlights for me were the main event TLC match and the Tag Team title match.  Both handicap matches were solid offerings that felt different enough from each other to not be repetitive.  Miz-Kofi was decent albeit unnecessary, and could have used the no DQ stipulation better.  R Truth Brodus was a throwaway match but still watchable.  Big E vs Sandow was more back and forth than I figured it would be.  This certainly is better than the two stars that were given by the other two reviewers (one of which praised the event but was mad they didn't release a bluray...).",1387238400,,827,4.496644295302014
6016446,1,B00FOLGVVM,"This was the the most horrible piece of trash I have ever watched.  I'm glad I didn't have to pay for this crap.  The build-up seemed pumped me up and all I got in the end was a big slap in the face.  The under-card had nothing exciting or satisfying except for the opening match with the Shield vs Punk.  The main event had me wondering if I was watching WWE or TNA, it was that bad.  It's sad that when the event was over, I had started thinking about giving away my Wrestlemania tickets.",1387152000,,490,4.11578947368421

Spoilers

1. CM PUNK VS THE SHIELD-four guys I love were involved in this match. This handicap match would see all three Shield members taking on Punk. Punk would try to divide and conquer as the commentary team would say and Shield tried to keep things moving tagging in and out. Punk would catch a break when Reigns would injure his eye. This would basically make it a two on one match, still bad odds but better than three. A mistake from the injured Reigns would cost the Shield this match as he spears his own teammate. Still this was a good fast paced match and a good opener for the PPV.

2.[DIVAS TITLE]AJ LEE VS NATALYA-this was one of the best Divas matches I have seen in a long time. Of course it makes sense given who was in the ring. This was an excellent back and forth contest with counters and submissions a plenty. I love both of these ladies but have been waiting for Natalya to win the belt for some time. Both worked hard in this match and right when it seemed Natie was in control a simple hair pull and roll up would help AJ keep the belt.

3.[I-C TITLE]BIG E LANGSTON VS DAMION SANDOW-this was a good match that most would say would have been right at home on Smackdown or something. Still it was a good match that showcased Big E and his power. Sandow looked to ground the bigger man but was eventually defeated by the power of Langston.

4.[TAG TITLE ELIMINATION MATCH]GOLDUST & CODY RHODES VS RYBACK & CURTIS AXEL VS THE REAL AMERICANS VS BIG SHOW & REY MYSTERIO-now this was a fun match right as all the teams just went at it. Every team had their moments as is the norm in these types of matches. Great action here especially when it gets down to the last two teams. I am glad that this was given time to play out with the Rhodes brothers keeping the titles.

5. R-TRUTH VS BRODUS CLAY-this match was there to further the storyline involving everyone from both teams. Clay dominated most of the match using his superior size and strength. But his attitude would cost him as his teammates walked out on him from ringside, this gave Truth the chance to roll him up for the win.

6.[NO DQ MATCH]THE MIZ VS KOFI KINGSTON-this match came about because of an incident earlier in the night on the kick off show. Now regardless of what the crowd was chanting I thought this was a good match. The momentum was traded back and forth going from inside the ring to outside and back in. this was a good encounter between the two with Kofi coming out on top.

7. THE WYATT FAMILY VS DANIEL BRYAN-this was a great handicapped match with the Wyatts controlling most of the match. Bryan would make a late comeback but it was halted by the cult like team. Bryan used his speed to take advantage from time to time but the bigger men would beat him down for most of the match. In the end it was too much for Bryan, and I loved the That Was Creepy chant from the fans.

8.[TITLE VS TITLE TLC MATCH]JOHN CENA VS RANDY ORTON-this is actually a much better match than some people are giving it credit for. These two have always had a good chemistry and it shows here. Sure it is not the best they have had but it is a fun one. The action is great with all kinds of weapons used including some handcuffs, with a creative way of getting out of them. I also liked that when Randy got the win he got it clean like others have pointed out.

BONUS

1. DOLPH ZIGGLER VS FANDANGO-this was a pretty good opening match between these two. Ziggler basically controls for most of this short match. Ziggler looked to have the win in his grasp until summer got involved and allowed Fandango to get the victory.

You get some interviews as well for special features and reactions to the night. This was a great event and one of the best of the year. I would highly recommend it to any wrestling fan.",1399507200,2,3802,4.302097902097902
8617426,5,B00FOLGVVM,"For years I thought WMXXX would be held at MSG, not too far from where I live. When it was announced to be in New Orleans, I swore that I would watch the event one way or another. Recently Ive been starting to doubt that promise until I watched this event. Heres why this event was good and why WMXXX will be better.

The CM Punk vs Shield match was a surprisingly fun one to watch. It was short but it served its purpose. The Shield are great in tag team matches and singles too. In the end they mainly contribute to the tag team division, but Ill talk about that later. CM Punk always has great matches and attention brought to him, so I have no doubt that hell hit a main event at WM.

Big E Langston and Sandow put on an alright match. The unification with Orton and Cena may spread to the US and IC, which would be great if the holders changed to give a lot more attention. This is why I miss the WWE from the ""Ruthless Agression"" era.

The divas matches are always good if you don't skip it. WWE will just keep the title with AJ and thats really about it.

Finally the tag team division is back. I love Rey Mysterio its about damn time he's done anything. Rhodes and Goldust are even better of a team to watch. I like Ryback and Axel, Cesaro and Swagger too. This match itself was probably the best one on the card. If WWE doesn't give in to a Wyatt vs Shield rivalry, do a Tag Team Turmoil and WM will all these teams now.

R-Truth vs Brodus Clay, no comment.

Kofi Kingston vs Miz(NO DQ) both of these men are great on an undercard. They wrestled a good match while it lasted. I wouldn't be mad if they had a little rivalry continuing.

Daniel Bryan vs The Wyatt Family, I love the group and Bryan but I mean Bryan needs to become back to SummerSlam status again. Chances are if WWE wants him to be big, hell win the Rumble which would be genius. The Wyatts dominated this match though, so they are getting slightly bigger. As I said, Wyatt vs Shield. Hopefully

John Cena vs Randy Orton. If theres one thing I liked about Cena, he FINALLY BROUGHT ATTENTION TO THE HEAVYWEIGHT TITLE THATS BEEN TRASHED FOR TWO WHOLE YEARS. Its a gift that Orton is a star again. This match was great and filled expectations. Sorry Cena but at WM its not u facing Orton, it Bryan or the returning BATISTA!",1388275200,,2295,4.2
