8053126,1,B0007X01T0,"Scientology?  The world's fastest growing religion!!??  Really?  There are more people who self identify as Jedi or Pastafarian in the US than Scientologists.  Believe it or not, they are probably saner than the Scientologists too.

For the real story on Scientology, google ""Xenu"", then watch the South Park episode on Scientology.

If you want an education on the criminal cult of Scientology from David Miscaviage's niece, read Jenna Miscaviage Hill's book, ""Beyond Belief"".  Or read Lawerence Wright's award winning ""Going Clear"".

If you insist on seeing Miscaviage speak, check him out on youtube.  There are plenty of Scientolgy lulz on youtube.

I enjoyed this short intro and was happy to see the celebrities being honored by the Church of Scientology. I was further educated as to their roles in education, drug abuse and criminal reform. Quite a lot of info.

I don't believe the media is a good source of info regarding any religion and this video really pounds the point home that people need to be more receptive to what they can do with this society.

Mr. Miscavige was well-spoken in all he said in plain language. I was especially impressed with the woman from New York regarding the drug treatment program proposed and funded by Tom Cruise for the firefighters from 9/11. Nice.

The DVD was nicely edited and can be played at home.",1374192000,2,746,4.503703703703704
8053128,5,B0007X01T0,"With so much in the press today about Scientology most of it poorly researched this video is fantastic.  Most people hear about Scientology as a religion and automatically associate it with the authoratative dogma that they have been force fed by other religions. They dissmis it out of hand and aren't even willing to find out for themselves what Scientology is really about.

  This video is great for the new Scientologist who wants to know more about the religion.  I have also found it is an excelent tool for sharing with your family and friends who might not understand what Scientology is all about and why you are involved with it.  In a lot of cases you find that people who were antaganistic twords Scientology because of what they have heard about it in the news realise that they are in compleate agreement with the goals of Scientology.  I have come to belive that there are only two reasons that someone wouldn't want to be involved with Scientology.  They one just don't want anything to get any better for anyone, or two they just don't have enough info about it.  This video is a great way to give them that info.",1152748800,5,1131,4.587064676616915
8053129,5,B0007X01T0,This is a fantastic 45 minute briefing covering all the important and broad aspects of Scientology.  Mr. Miscavage accurately and directly describes all of the religion's social betterment activities as well as fully answering common questions regarding the religion itself.  This DVD contains information about the Scientology world in an easy to understand way and completely covers the basics.  It is a must see for anyone who wants to know more about what has become the fastest growing religion on the planet.  This is data you need to have!,1124236800,4,546,5.101123595505618
