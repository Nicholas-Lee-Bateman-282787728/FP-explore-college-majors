My son learned his shapes, colors and alphabets by watching these amazing videos too, so I figured why not move on to letter sounds! It's so great! Keeps him busy while he learns... I just reinforce his learning by reviewing and singing the songs with him!",1344902400,2,402,4.597222222222222

4887923,5,B005T3P28I,"I bought this for my 3 (almost 4) year old.  He had been doing the sight word videos for a while and seemed to have them down so I thought I'd try something new.  I watched this video with him several times and didn't think it was as effective as the sight word videos...I was very wrong.  Before going to bed at night we read books, and I'll tell him to sound out the words and try to read with me.  He is able to sound each letter out, and then put it together to say the word.  It is amazing.

This video and the sight word videos are awesome.",1331078400,5,546,3.918181818181818
4887924,5,B005T3P28I,Well done!  Preschool Prep knows its stuff.  My four year old is interested in everything except sitting down learning something new.  This video builds on things familiar including other Preschool Prep material (Meet the Letters)and ties it all together.  This is my favorite one!  And my son loves it (but I think Meet the Sight Words is his favorite).  It's a great investment!,1330041600,2,380,4.9523809523809526
4887925,1,B005T3P28I,"I have all of the Preschool Prep Company basic early learning DVDs, plus the Sight Word videos & they are all AMAZING!  My daughter knew all of her colors, shapes, letters, & numbers by 18 months just from watching the videos a few times each.
As a kindergarten teacher & reading specialist, I was thrilled when PPC came out with the Phonics videos, and figured as awesome as the other videos were, I couldn't go wrong.  That is definitely NOT the case.  The letter sound video introduces ALL letter sounds at the same time which is really confusing for early learners.  In addition to having the hard & soft sounds for c & g inter-twined, they also mixed together long & short vowel sounds.  The worst was the letter ""A""  they even had the ""aw"" sound like in awesome.  That is not a part of any early childhood curriculum that I have ever seen and in my opinion, could cause significant confusion amongst early learners.  Overall I'm sad I wasted my money on the Phonics set from what I have seen so far.  I do not plan to allow my daughter to watch the videos until at least 1st grade because I do not want to confuse her learning and cause her difficulty when taking standardized tests such as DIBELS.",1328918400,59,1204,4.4363636363636365
4887926,5,B005T3P28I,"As a douceur to convince my daughter(31m) to start blending C-V-C words, I've cracked open my wallet and loaded Preschool Prep's ""Meet the Phonics: Letter Sounds"" onto our Kindle Fire. Let me tell you, as somebody who has turned green from watching Leap Frog videos about 100 times, and who can sing the ""Rusty and Rosie"" songs by heart, ""Meet the Phonics"" is a nice change of pace!

That being said, I don't think that ""Meet the Phonics"" would make the best starter video for a young learner because it introduces a lot of information very quickly. Conceptually, ""Meet the Phonics"" teaches material covered in Leap Frog's ""Letter Factory"", ""Talking Words Factory"", and ""Talking Words Factor Two"", all put together.

What is really interesting to me as a parent, is right in the middle of ""Meet the Phonics"" when they start showing a slot machine that blends C-V-C words, My two year old starts to immediately lose interest and starts wildly touching the screen trying to change the Kindle over to something else. This is proof yet again that she is still not ready to blend...  Nevertheless, this video is still a great pick.",1328745600,14,1126,4.793814432989691
4887927,5,B005T3P28I,"My 3 year old niece, thanks to her Dad is an avid Leap frog collector and quite a fanatic. So much so she has her personal DVD player to view them.
From an adult perspective, I have seen the progress of my niece with the way she expresses herself and of course the basic education she is gaining.
The phonics of the english language are presented in a most entertaining and fun way for a child to interact fully.  Whilst there may be other effective learning systems, I am happy with the progress of my niece and would be using this system for my son when he is ready.
As a parent myself, I recommend that you spend time with your child while viewing these programs. I usually view the material first then sit with the child and be very interactive.
No regrets with this purchase.",1327622400,,780,4.342465753424658

He acts out the ""characters"" from the movies and this one is no exception.  Additionally, since he has complete letter recognition thanks to Meet the Letters, after watching this movie he can point to the letters he sees and make some of the sounds they make.

That's another story. I think they key with Preschool Prep is to introduce it when they're young. Ages 2-3. Even the age of one! Or else they could find it boring.,1474502400,,325,4.344262295081967

He already knew numbers,  shapes, and letters after doing the Your Baby Can Read series, so I thought this would be a great intro to phonics. Your Baby Can Read does not teach phonics, but word memorization which is still great to me and he is able to indentify objects and words before the age of 2. This video does teach both short and long vowels sounds at the end with the phonics song.  It also has a cute song for vowels. By the end of the 1st week, he was able to do the sounds for all the letters!  Now I will say this. If your child is used to high animation cartoons, then this video may bore them.

Also bought Letter Factory from the recommendation of a teacher. This one was much better! Kids are like sponges... so why not teach them everything you can at a young age. This video gives MORE of the phonics sounds and also sound like they are suppose to over the other video, in my opinion. For example, with the letter ""C"", they sound it out two ways... as Circle and in another scene Crab. Same letter but different sound. Some say it might seem confusing, but we had the opposite experience, again our 3yr, as most kids are sponges and learn very quickly.",1408406400,,728,4.607692307692307

It's also a nice wind-down video at the end of the day, reinforcing what he's learned at school or at home.",1372291200,2,257,3.8679245283018866
4888005,5,B005T3P28I,"My son is actually learning the letter sounds!!  I tried teaching him with flashcards, but just ended up bored out of his mind.  But he actually pays attention to this movie and sings the songs.",1372118400,2,194,4.514285714285714
4888006,5,B005T3P28I,Meet the Phonics has been a God send for our preschool program.  The two-five year olds have mastered their phonics with this fun and educational video.  I now purchase it as birthday gifts for grandkids and other children that are not part of our program.,1369267200,2,256,4.666666666666667

We had Conjunction Junction, Alphabet Rock and a few other rockn' up beat cartoons in the early 70's that made you want to sing it cause it would get stuck in your head and were amusing to watch.",1365379200,,315,4.080645161290323

4888011,5,B005T3P28I,"I am so happy to finally find something that teaches (almost) all the phonograms for the letter sounds. While my kids love the leap frog games and shows, they don't cover the vowel sounds which can be so confusing. I believe that teaching in small groups each letter and all it's possible sounds are a better and more effective way to learn. It takes a little more work in the beginning, but is much more highly effective in the long run. (I have a 7th grade boy who is currently reading at college level as proof that it is effective). Spell to write and read and writing road to reading would agree.

A fun compliment to our curriculum.",1362873600,2,638,4.406779661016949
4888012,5,B005T3P28I,"I cannot sing this series enough praises. My two children, ages 3 and 1, watch one of these DVDs once a day. As evidence of their effectiveness, my three year old daughter can pick out any of the sounds/words in this series any time we are reading a book togehter, when we are out in public, and if she happens to look at a page that I am reading. My son, who can barely speak, has limited speech capacity and he is able to distinctly verbalize these words and sounds. I really don't care if some educators are against learning in this way. It works. This is hands down the best way that I have found to teach my children (along with reading)- and my friends and family are literally blown away by what they have seen my children read at such a young age. Do you want to feel like the best parent in the world (at least temporarily)? Then buy this DVD series. You will be creating baby geniuses!",1356998400,2,895,4.239766081871345
4888013,5,B005T3P28I,"I have a 5 year old in kindergarten that I wanted to make sure that she was learning what she is supposed to during this first year of schooling. It's amazing how the use of sight words and phonics can get a child reading in no time. I just love hearing my kid sound out the letters in a word and then correctly identifying a word.

As a bonus, my 2 year old LOVES to watch this movie with her sister. Maybe I'll get her reading before she starts Kindergarten.",1356652800,2,460,4.111111111111111

8485757,3,B005T3P28I,"This is not what I would consider a good phonics video. They give the child multiple sounds for each of the letters. This gets confusing and unmanageable for toddlers. They should stick to one, common letter sound per letter. This way it actually will stick. The other sounds will come later. They also say the letter name, which is not a good aplroach for the same reason. It overwhelms the child. Montessori only sticks with one letter sound, and they don't even bother with the name of the letters until later on, once theyve mastered the phonetics. Not a good product for beginners.",1509840000,,586,4.699029126213592

She is already reading pretty well and knows all the concepts presented in the movie, but I still think she's getting stuff out of it.  The songs are catchy and I like that this presents more than just the basic phonics sounds.  It covers the secondary (or tirshiary) sounds of both consonants and vowels and other concepts such as ""controlling R"".",1487721600,,517,4.23469387755102
