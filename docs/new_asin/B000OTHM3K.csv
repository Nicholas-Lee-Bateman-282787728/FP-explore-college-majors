8186632,4,B000OTHM3K,I remember buying this along time ago when I heard it advertise on the radio. I hated wearing glasses and couldn't afford contacts at the time. I bought it used it for a couple weeks and honestly it started working. My eyes did started to focus better my vision did improve a little. I don't know how well my eyes would ne to this day if I continued. I stop doing the exercise because my life got a little busy and I skipped a couple days and then just stopped. The exercises are about 30 minutes long starting from beginner to advanced. I wished I woulda done it longer but I'm starting to do it again. So honestly I think it does have potential if you stick with it and have patience. People these days like to dismiss things that are involves natural healing same goes with medicine. I stay away from pharmaceutical drugs as they do more harm than good. Natural is the way to go,1387929600,6,881,4.281437125748503
