4216998,5,B003XKQ62A,"I bought this because my three year-old likes trains. I mean he REALLY likes trains. This has kept him fascinated for hours and it is the first thing he wants to see in the morning and the last thing he wants to watch before he goes to bed at night. I also leave it running on the television in his playroom for him to glance at if he is in there playing. Now, do not get the wrong impression, we do not use the television as a ""babysitter"" (but it does help keep the kids quiet at times when it is necessary), but for a child who has mild autism, this is wonderful.

The CDC has reported that 1 in 88 children have an autism spectrum disorder ([...] the fact that children with autism like trains ([...] research has shown the spontaneous origin of an extremely intense interest in trains/tracks to be a preoccupying passion in many very young children with autism ([...]%20trains%20and%20automobiles.pdf ).

The HD quality is good and the sound is clear (e.g., sound of the wheels on the tracks, the whistle, etc.). Now, for me to sit and watch this is a different story. I think trains are okay, but I could not sit for hours and watch this because (as another reviewer stated) it is basically just shots of trains. Up close, far way, still on the tracks, in motion, and on and on it goes. No words, just trains.

So with all that said, I HIGHLY recommend this DVD for children with autism who like trains.",1368489600,3,1409,4.390804597701149

The HD was not very good either.",1357344000,,90,3.55
4217000,5,B003XKQ62A,"As a professional broadcast cameraman,I think these DVD's have some of the most beautiful scenes I've seen in railroad/train video productions. This a great set of various trains and steam engines. The price for what you get is a super bargain and the quality of the original video in HD and DTS audio is simply superb.",1334102400,6,319,4.714285714285714
4217001,5,B003XKQ62A,"I fully concur with Jeffory A's review.  Much of this Blu-Ray set makes you feel like you are actually on or near the train.  I don't see how it can get any better than this.

The only, and I really mean only, down side is the really crummy plastic case.  First thing I did was throw the case away.  This type case unnecessarily stresses the disc when you try to remove it and almost always forces you to  remove 1-3 discs more than you plan to watch.  Additionally, the  slip on cardboard sleeve is a waste of money.  Lastly, it consumes twice the shelf space as a 4 disc (1/2"") case available everywhere.  What were the folks at Tropics Entertainment thinking?",1295049600,8,662,4.396694214876033
4217002,3,B003XKQ62A,"I got this set of four blu-ray from Amazon. I'm in Blu-ray region C member and could play these in my A region Panasonic player as well as region C players (SONY 370). Content of these videos are relevant and explains the journey in short with routes and connecting stations. The video quality is average and not so stunning sharp, however sound and narration scores high. This is a better than DVD but certainly not the best! Considering the value is a good buy for the beginners.",1292803200,3,481,4.540229885057471
4217003,5,B003XKQ62A,"This&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/HD-TRAINS-BLU-RAY/dp/B003XKQ62A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">HD TRAINS - BLU-RAY</a>&nbsp;is as picturesque as these train programs get!

This blu-ray set is four hours of steam trains in four complete programs by Railway Productions (2010).  It's produced by Les Jarrett, the owner of Railway Productions and narrated by Lane Venardos.

VIDEO:
HD TRAINS [BLU-RAY] is a Four-disc set (4 BDs - 25GB Blu-ray Discs).  Each disc has a running time of about 60 minutes, with 'trailers' for other programs by Railway Productions.

All four blu-ray episodes are in HD 1080i.  The video quality is generally crisp - however, the occasional 'noise' is detected especially in some scenes with steam and snowy weather.
Video codec: MPEG-4 AVC, Video resolution: 1080i, Aspect ratio: 1.78:1 (16:9)
(NOTE: Amazon erroneously lists the 'aspect ratio' as 1.33:1)

AUDIO:
DTS-HD Master Audio 2.0 as well as Dolby Digital 2.0.  Like other 'train documentaries'  in this genre , the narration can be turned on or off.  The audio realistically captures the historic steam trains rumbling along through Utah and Wyoming, Nebraska, Indiana and Colorado (your sub-woofer 'kicks in' realistically as the trains rumble by).  Lane Venardos' narration is crisp, not rambling into too much historical detail.  These programs are afterall about appreciating trains!

ABOUT EACH DISC IN HD TRAINS:

DISC ONE - ""Steam Giants"".  If you like watching steam trains for hours on end, then the Nickel Plate 765, the Southern Pacific 4449 and the Union Pacific 844 steam trains all beckon you on this very engaging disc.

DISC TWO - ""Winter Steam"" in the Rockies features the Durango and Silverton narrow guage railroad in and around the Colorado mountains.  Despite the heavy February snowfall when most of these snow scenes were filmed, I only once saw a snowdrop melt on the camera lens!  This disc stands out for the magical capture of falling snow with the D & S steam train chugging along the wintry Colorado mountains.

DISC THREE - ""Steam Ghosts"" - explores the Northern Nevada railroad through places like Ely, Nevada and Heber, Utah.  Although rugged and scenic, it's the least engaging disc in the set ... yawn! :(

DISC FOUR - ""Cavalcade of Steam"" - The Pennsylvania Dutch Amish communities, the 1832 Strasburg Railroad Line, a 1925 steam engine running on a narrow gauge route and the Cumbres and Toltec line (bought by New Mexico and Colorado states in 1970) - this disc is full of history ... my favorite in this HD Trains box set ... great job Les Jarrett! :)

ALSO RECOMMENDED: If 'train documentaries' get you started, then the blu-ray -&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/BNSF-in-the-Mojave-Desert/dp/B002XV1QSY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">BNSF in the Mojave Desert</a>&nbsp;is a must have for your collection!

8408192,4,B003XKQ62A,"Loved these DVDs, the photography, subject matter and narration are top notch.  I'd give it five stars of it wasn't fit one very annoying problem....when you start up the DVD for some reason the narration is not enabled.  I watched the first DVD for about ten minutes before I stmt searching for the setup I the menu and changed the audio settings.  Even that was confusing.  You can choose from ""trains, narration, trains DTS and narration DTS"" but not any two, just one!  It's really pretty stupid.",1486857600,,500,4.7011494252873565
8408193,1,B003XKQ62A,waste of money. I thought this would be more than people using cell phones to record videos of trains going by.,1456099200,,111,4.333333333333333
8408194,1,B003XKQ62A,ok,1433462400,,2,2.0
8408195,1,B003XKQ62A,"There is no narrative.  Just the exterior of trains -- coming in and out of stations... for hours on end.  It would be great for insomniacs, except for the horns blowing.",1424822400,,170,4.451612903225806
8408196,5,B003XKQ62A,I read the good reviews of this dvd before purchasing and I am still surprised and impressed by the quality. It captivates my son like few things can and his train-loving grandfather is equally mesmerized. The images are beautiful and I don't mind having to watch this video over and over.,1421366400,,289,4.686274509803922
8408197,5,B003XKQ62A,I ordered this for my son who LOVES trains. I did read all of the reviews for this and ordered it anyway. This is one of his most favorite movies to watch. 4 disks of trains! The small parts that it shows Google Maps its that bad. This really was a great buy!!,1407024000,,260,3.9245283018867925
8408198,4,B003XKQ62A,Love the snow train!,1405468800,,20,4.25
8408199,4,B003XKQ62A,"Material is great, sharp vid. Nice angles of view, clear sound.  Would've given 5 stars but had two concerns.  1) Packaging sucks.  All 4 discs are on a spindle which is difficult to remove.  Afraid I may snap a disc when removing.  2) Unfortunate audio not recorded in 5 Channel.  Would have been a thrill hearing it all around me.  Packaging was the biggest issue for me, there is a better way to have these presented.  Otherwise, a keeper and an excellent addition to my collection.",1398211200,3,485,4.558139534883721

8408201,5,B003XKQ62A,"So my dad bought this for our little boys to watch! They never wanted to watch anything else while there. After much debate we bought this. 4 hours of train watching. My LO now 2 then just 1 couldn't stop watching it. I love it because he does! Whenever he was teething, upset, whatever. This would calm him down. My 4 year old loves it too. Although one DVD is about enough for him :) in a sitting. Don't hesitate if your kid loves trains this is a great buy and very expensive.",1387843200,,479,4.161290322580645
