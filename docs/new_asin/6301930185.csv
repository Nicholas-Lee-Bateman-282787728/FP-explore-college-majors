quote several lines and have watched it more times than I care to
admit. I found it on VHS at a street fair and treasure it because as
far as I know it isn't out on DVD...I hope one day..please!

Phillis Diller hates the idea that her husband (Slim Pickens) sank
their money into a motel and likes to nag and insult him. Slim: ""These
pink outfits, our pink motif"" Phyllis: Yea, ""we get all the drunks
because they think they are checking into a bottle of Pepto Bismol"".
""I'm still not convinced the money isn't in fried chicken"". Slim: ""what
we have here is a gold mine"". Phyllis: ""the only gold here is in our
teeth"".

One by one people check in from different walks of life. Each persons
story gets more detailed as to why they are there and why they picked
that motel.

To top it off, the movie actually has its own catchy theme song ""pink
motel, nobody kiss and tell, rendezvous, room for me and you at the
pink motel, American tradition, keeps you in condition...""

Yes the movie is cheesy, but it is quality cheese and I highly recommend it to
anyone who loves the fun eighties like I do.",1279843200,4,1162,4.2681818181818185
8240316,3,6301930185,"A collection of short stories that take place in a sleazy, roadside no tell motel, run by Phyllis Diller and Slim Pickens who are great.  It reminds us of those colorful motels that lined our streets once upon a time, but are now being replaced with high rises, etc.  Spicey but would probably get a PG-13 rating at most by today's standards.  Not necessarily a classic but would not take up space on a cult film collector's shelf either.",1231632000,2,438,4.518987341772152
