933847,5,6304843267,"I saw this in the theaters when it first opened and loved it.  However, even as a kid I could tell there were problems.  The film is very campy and everyone seems to be concentrating very hard on ""acting.""  Watch Karen Black's eyes... there are several scenes where her eyes are actually uncrossed!
A cast of future has-beens dominates this film: Linda ""Exorcist"" Blair plays the ""isn't she cute?"" sick girl and Helen ""I am Woman Hear Me Roar"" Reddy plays a nun.  Spot ""Mr. Roper,"" Erik Estrada and Sharon Gless amongst the cast.  Gloria Swanson makes an appearance-and yes, she too ""acts.""
Charlton Heston and George Kennedy spend half the film trying to outdo each other saying cheesy lines with such earnest I almost believed them.  The thought of Charlton, with his turtleneck and aviator glasses, gritting his teeth and saying, ""Fly, baby, fly,"" still gives me chills... or is it hives?
Regardless, this film is an amazing amount of fun and more repeated viewings just adds to the pleasure.  You'll find yourself asking questions like, ""How come when I fly, I can barely see out the window, but on this flight, people in the back of the plane can see all that is happening at the front of the plane?""  or ""If they are flying at 190 mph, how come there is only a light breeze coming through the gapping hole in the cockpit?""
Buy this film, you won't regret it.",971136000,8,1364,4.584362139917696
933848,3,6304843267,"I recently saw this movie for the first time.  Compared to other disaster  movies, Airport 1975 is rather one note.  There aren't any twists and turns  that keep the plot suspenceful.  Once the disaster occurs, the rest of the  movie is literally on auto-pilot until the end.  The film also suffers from  a drab, low buget look that is similar to a 1970s made for TV movie.  That  said, this movie is still worth watching as a time capsule of the period.  The clothes and hair styles are always fun to look at, and the cast is  often filled with many familiar faces.  It is also interesting to see that  the flight crew can openly lust after the stewardesses.  In this age of  sexual harrassment awareness,  this can be somthing of a shock.  Many of  the gags in the movie ""Airplane!"" are direct take offs from  Airport 1975.  The singing nun, the sick kid and the replacement  pilot/stewardess relaionship are all here.  The DVD edition of this movie  is in wide-screen.  For the most part this is a good transfer of an older  film. There is some production notes, but not much else in the extras  department.  If you are a fan of 70s disaster movies, this is required  viewing, but, it is not the best example of the genre.",969321600,,1225,4.4409090909090905
933849,5,6304843267,"When I first saw Airport 1975 on NBC's Friday Night At The Movies, I was amazed and stunned at the storyline of the movie. Not only does it stay true to avaition in general, it also stays true to the classic '70's  disaster movie formula. An all-star cast, superb script that is handled  properly, good special effects for its time, and an explosive soundtrack.  This was the movie that made me a fan of Roy Thinnes(whose character's  tragic death in the film took me by surprise)and his later works. Most of  all, it made me appreciate the works of Charlton Heston, George Kennedy,  and others. Although one wishes that lead actors like Harrison Ford and  James Brolin were in the lead role, Charlton Heston does a remarkable job  as the heroic pilot who tries to save the plane and its surviving  passengers. George Kennedy also does an excellent job re-prising the role  of Joseph Patroni. And the ever great Roy Thinnes did an excellent job as  the ill-fated co-pilot and first officer of the plane, John Urias. Much of  the stunt work in the movie was also good, and very convincing. I was on  the edge of my seat nearly throughout the course of the movie. If you  enjoyed films like The Poseidon Adventure and The Towering Inferno, then  you will definately enjoy Airport 1975. But, you don't have to take my word  for it. Watch it yourself and make your own conclusions.",964310400,3,1377,4.604938271604938
933850,4,6304843267,"Watch Charlton Heston snort, chew, spit, and grunt his way through the greatest display of machismo ever captured on the silver screen. Watch Karen Black, every glorious cross-eyed inch of her, calmly fly a plane  holding each and every has-been performer of the past half century. Watch  George Kennedy chomp cigars, ride atop fire engines like a rip-roarin'  cowboy, and sweat buckets as his precious wife heads into danger. Without  question, this installment in the delightful series is one of the best:  silly, ridiculous, nearly unwatchable, and yet masterful in its ability to  entertain. From Gloria Swanson to Sid Caesar (a particularly embarrassing  performance), all the stars are here. But again, it all returns to Heston:  a true man among men. He might not want this film at the top of his film  resume, but it deserves to be. Whether he is chewing scenery with tongue  firmly in cheek or honestly believes his character needs to be this manly  (do we really need to discuss the answer?), Heston dominates this film to  the point where no other actor can even breathe.

933851,5,6304843267,"This movie is one of my all-time favorites because it is truly a camp classic.  It is completely over-the-top and unbelievably melodramatic, but it still works as a great disaster flick.  The script is so full of cliches  and one-liners that it is very nearly a comedy.  There are so many famous  people in this film that watching it is like being on the red carpet at the  Oscars.  Best of all, the star (not Charlton Heston, as many wrongly  believe), Karen Black, gives the performance of her career and a place in  the pantheon of bad acting.  Two DON'T MISS IT moments:  Karen's look as  she notices the huge mountain that they are going to hit, and when she uses  her tongue to help get Charlton into the plane (maybe if she had used her  tongue with the first pilot, he would have made it!).

But, the last half hour is silly  enough to make the likes of AIRPLANE completely redundant.

933854,5,6304843267,"The Theme (aircrew disabled/dead, stewardess or passenger brings it in...) has been done and re-done. This one, however, stands out due to the superlative ""10-star"" performance by Karen Black. With little  help from special effects, less from the screenwriters (mediocre  story-line, at best), Black made me FEEL the terror, frustration, anger,  desperation and elation as Nancy's predicament progresses. Putting aside  the known improbability (I'm a former jet fighter pilot)of a non-pilot  being able to quick-study command and control of a B-747, even with expert  coaching, Black's emoting captivated me to the point where I BELIEVED her;  she made it real for me. The plethora of other stars, including the mighty  Heston, faded into  supporting roles to Ms. Black in this one. She was  absolutely superb.

I thought this was a good thriller....the whole thing with Linda Blair playing the sick teenager needing to get to the hospital for a kidney transplant where any delay in landing could prove to be fatal angle was a bit too much over the top.  Also, once the small plane hit the cabin to start the disaster off on a great foot, the next footage then shows the passengers down on the cabin deck.  If you look carefully, you will see this woman in the middle of the aisle (center seats) standing with this horrid look on her face, as she just screams at the top of her lungs.  Then, several times, the camera cuts back to this same group of passengers and every time, this woman is still standing there, out of her seat...screaming.  It's the funniest thing I've ever seen in a disaster movie.  I often look at that part of the movie and chuckle.  Anyway, Charlton Heston at his best......Watching George Kennedy ride on top of a fire truck was pretty funny.  Still, all in all, a good disaster movie.",1468022400,,1144,4.40952380952381

934012,5,6304843267,"Another 70's-obligatory ""all star cast"" takes off for another flight into fear in AIRPORT 1975. It's great fun to watch Efrem Zimbalist Jr. piloting the giant 747, w/ a passenger list including a very annoying Sid Caesar, a drunken Norman Fell and Jerry Stiller, Myrna Loy as a boiler-maker-slamming woman, Linda Blair (THE EXORCIST, HELL NIGHT) as a young, sickeningly-sweet patient in dire need of a kidney transplant, Helen Reddy as a sickeningly-sweet, singing / guitar-twanging nun, and Gloria Swanson (SUNSET BOULEVARD) as... er, Gloria Swanson! George Kennedy (JUST BEFORE DAWN) reprises his role -as he does in every AIRPORT film- as flight engineer, Joe Patroni. Dana Andrews (CURSE OF THE DEMON) plays the doomed pilot of the offending aircraft that causes the necessary mayhem. Oh yes, and Erik Estrada is the smarmy, sex-starved Julio! Of course, the heroes of the movie are the ultra-mega-macho Alan Murdoch (Charlton Heston- PLANET OF THE APES, THE OMEGA MAN, SOYLENT GREEN, EARTHQUAKE) and his screeching, resourceful, long-suffering girlfriend / stewardess, Nancy Pryor (Karen Black- THE PYX, TRILOGY OF TERROR, INVADERS FROM MARS), who must join forces in order to save the plane! Much daring-do is done as rescue attempts fail, leaving Murdoch as the last hope! Heston is at his brick-jawed best here, chewing scenery like a rabid hyena! Fans of AIRPLANE! will find this essential viewing, as it was used as the basic template upon which it was based! Extremely entertaining in every way imaginable!...

934018,3,6304843267,"Airport 1975, spoofed by the parody AIRPLANE! in 1980, has to be the quintessential action/disaster movie of the 1970's right up there with Towering Inferno. Repleat with a Who's Who of Hollywood name talent whose portraits probably appeared in little boxes on the original movie poster, although I don't know how you could fit them all! Everyone from Charleton Heston, George Kennedy (who made a career of playing in films like this) to Helen Reddy and Sid Caesar is somewhere in this film. Even Jim Plunkett, the pro-football quarterback, makes a cameo. This movie, three decades later, seems a laugh-a-minute, a riot in scenes where it's hard to believe the actors weren't on the verge of cracking up. I mean, can you really take this seriously? This film begged to be spoofed, although maybe it stands on its own! The lines and kooky characters alone are worth the price of admission, and most of them make an encore appearance in AIRPLANE! (by different actors). Does a typical group of airline passengers really look like this? But that's what makes it fun and impossible to take soberly. The big question is this: if the filmmakers were attempting to make a thought-provoking disaster movie, where did these guys go to screen-writing school? Screen writing for Dummies? Unless they were writing for laughs all along and we the audience were so dumb we thought we were watching a serious film.

Let's look at the characters. This is utterly fantastic. You've got the full-of-herself over-the-top movie star, Gloria Swanson, playing herself essentially. You know the type ""Dahhhling"" with the long cigarette holders. A couple of nuns, one of whom just happens to sing, of course, care of Helen Reddy. A couple of Hari-Krishnas. A sick girl flying to an operation. Old drunk guys, care of Norman Fell and Jerry Stiller, constantly asking the stewardesses for more booze. Actually, at one point, the entire coach sections get shamelessly sloshed! I guess who wouldn't knowing your plane might crash! A boy and his mother who just happen to be the son and wife of the director of operations of the airline. Stewardesses who are not only drop-dead gorgeous but are the kindest people you've ever met on an airline. And the pilots, one of whom named Julio played by a young Eric Estrada who can't seem to stop flirting with the stewardesses.

And now we have the even-better part: the lines! Eric Estrada says at the beginning of the movie after seeing some of the beautiful stewardesses ""That's why I love my job."" Or how about the hot-headed George Kennedy ""It's the only chance we've got!"" The TV reporter has some of the best: ""The plot thickens!"" And of course, Helen Reddy sings for, you guessed it, the little sick girl, played by Linda Blair who always played sick girls in the 1970's. That was so embarrassingly bad, I had to fast-forward it. Heston's line at the end of the movie will have you rolling over the floor.

When you watch this, are we really supposed to believe this is to be taken seriously? The action-packed thriller that never let's up on lame but memorable lines or its crazy memorable characters! We spend more time on the plane than at the airport, and yet is called ""Airport 1975"". That about says it all. This should have been called AIRPLANE.",1434672000,,3274,4.811722912966252

934089,5,6304843267,"This is definitely a 3 or 4 star film; why 5 stars?  Read on...
The 'Airport' series of films highlighted the air business and the trials and tribulations that we, as travelers, face.  It's strangely out of date and corny now though scads of films from that era are still relevant.  Perhaps the reality of the real perils of flying have made the minor squabbles(for the most part) in these films seem trivial.
Airport 1975 was different in that it put you in the cockpit.  This is a fundamental point of film, to give us an experience we wouldn't normally have but dream of.  When a mid-air collision takes out the pilots(Efram Zimbalist, Jr.) it makes the most senior flight attendant(Karen Black) take the helm.  In those days, there was not the slightest glimmer of training for 'stews' in such an instance.  In the event, she is up to the task with help from the ground(Charlton Heston, George Kennedy) until the impending landing.  Then they have to attempt an incredible rescue.
SO, the film on its production merits was about a 3 star like the other Airport films; however, for the emotional 'thrill ride' of taking the helm of the plane, something many of us have dreamt of(dread?), I think we can up the ante to 5.",1423353600,,1223,4.6036866359447

934216,4,6304843267,"Airport 1975 may not be 100% as entertaining as its predecessor, Airport, but it remains a pretty good thriller at any rate. It all held my attention every step of the way; there's plenty of suspense and great acting! The casting was well done; and the choreography and cinematography both reflect good forethought. True, the musical score essentially just tells you how to feel; but Helen Reddy gets in a good number as she sings and plays guitar very well! In addition, some people say that this is a campy movie with a plot that relies upon many clichs and soap-opera style melodramatic relationships; and I think they are right. It's possible, however, that at the time the filmmakers thought they were making something more serious--but at any rate, it's still pretty good entertainment.

When the action starts (and there's lots of action), we quickly meet the principle characters of the story. There's 747 ace pilot Alan Murdock (Charlton Heston) and his flight attendant girlfriend (they called them stewardesses back then) Nancy Pryor (Karen Black) who have had a stormy affair for the last six years without commitment much to Nancy's chagrin; and George Kennedy reprises his Airport role of Joe Patroni, an ace at airport troubleshooting and a fine pilot in his own right. Although Nancy wants to spend time talking with Alan to save their failing relationship, she must serve on a red eye special with Captain Stacy (Efrem Zimbalist Jr.) at the controls. Moreover, Alan doesn't seem all that interested in talking with Nancy--he'd rather be alone with her instead.

To flesh out the plot, the flight is full of passengers with their own problems and situations in life; there's the aging actress Gloria Swanson (playing herself) who's working on her memoirs with her assistant; men looking for fun and women (look for Jerry Stiller as Sam and Norman Fell as Bill); Joe Patroni's wife Helen (Susan Clark) and son Joe Patroni, Jr. (Brian Morrison); and a young girl Janice Abbott (Linda Blair) is also on board with her mother (Nancy Olson). Janice is being rushed to a hospital for a life-saving kidney transplant. There are also two nuns, Sister Beatrice (Martha Scott) and Sister Ruth (Helen Reddy); and Sid Caesar plays Barney while Myrna Loy plays Mrs. Devaney.

Tragedy and serious trouble ensues when the pilot of a small airplane (Dana Andrews as Scott Freeman) has a fatal heart attack up in the air; and consequently his plane crashes into the jumbo 747's cockpit, making a huge hole in one side of it that immediately pulls out the co-pilot and blinds Captain Stacy.  The jumbo 747 now has nobody to fly it--and it's up to Nancy with the help of Alan on the ground to try to land the plane safely.

Of course, there's much more to the plot--but I won't add any more to avoid giving out spoilers! Suffice it to say that even if you can guess the ultimate resolution of the plot, it's not at all obvious what transpires to get to that point.

Overall, people who are fans of this film would do well to add this to their collections. In addition, people who enjoy thrillers and action and suspense will like this movie. It's also somewhat campy in retrospective so if you like campy films you will like Airport 1975, too.",1352419200,,3240,4.776785714285714

Just checked, and found that it grossed ten times the cash it took to make. I think the average viewer today will find it entertaining though not a high point of your viewing week. I would strongly urge that you not see the original Burt Lancaster, or the succeeding versions, within clear memory span of watching this one. They are working to the same formula and it will dim your pleasure to see the formula followed so closely. It may mar your pleasure in the film to outline the plot; one need only know that a commercial jet liner gets into bad trouble, and that is has a passenger list that includes assorted familiar faces of the time (including, most prominently, Gloria Swanson (playing herself) and Myrna Loy. George Kennedy, promoted in rank, appears as he did in Airport, and Sid Caesar has a rather thankless role. Charlton Heston replaces Burt Lancaster in the big name slot, while Helen Reddy does get to sing a song, which must have taken some professional composer ten or fifteen minutes to 'create'. She emerges sounding fine despite all. It was nice to see Dana Andrews again, minor role though he had. Thirty years before,, he had been on his way to major stardom but, somehow got sidetracked into the ""appearing also"" list. There are other familiar faces doing their bit toward making this a ""star-studded"" production.

Karen Black - Charlton Heston- it just works. Many sub-charactors also contribute in a way that has never been repeated again. The storyline doesn't need to be rehashed. I've watched the film in all it's incarnations. I've concluded that the now defunct laserdisc version is the best.

The premise that the collision of the two planes; the smaller plane hitting the larger 747, tearing a whole in the cockpit; killing the crew and leaving the stewardess at the control being so outrageously inaccurate is not relevant.  I don't remember Hollywood ever being required to produce anything other than means of entertainment.  This was a great action packed movie.  Something that Hollywood has lost in the last decade or so.  This movie; NO F-bombs, NO gun violence, NO cheesy sex scenes and the producers and director still managed to create a great movie.

People need to learn to enjoy themselves; just enjoy the movie for what it is; a way to get away from our daily lives for a couple hours and have some enjoyment.

934221,3,6304843267,"A combination of drama, suspense, and action, the original Airport (1970) launched the 70's disaster film genre.  The success of films that followed Airport, like the Poseidon Adventure (1972), demonstrated that compelling characters combined with spectacular action were two key elements.  In Airport 1975 (1974), the focus is more on action and suspense, and less on the melodramatic lives of the characters.  The streamlined approach works rather well, as the story isn't cluttered up with a lot of side issues, as a Columbia Airlines 747 flying from Washington DC to Los Angeles, is struck by a small private plane.  The sequel doesn't have the same number of A-List stars as the original, but the cast is very solid, and includes Charlton Heston, Karen Black, George Kennedy, Efrem Zimbalist Jr., Roy Thinnes, Dana Andrews, Gloria Swanson, Susan Clark, Sid Caesar, Erik Estrada, Linda Blair, Norman Fell, Martha Scott, and singer Helen Reddy.

The plot is very straightforward, as bad weather forces both a businessman (Andrews) flying a small plane bound for Idaho, and Columbia flight 409, to be diverted to Salt Lake Airport.  While the planes are maneuvering to land, the pilot of the small plane suffers a heart attack, loses control, and crashes his plane into the cockpit area of the Columbia 747.  There is severe structural damage, two of the flight crew are killed, and the pilot (Zimbalist Jr.) is badly injured.  With no one else available, stewardess Nancy Pryor (Black) establishes radio contact with air traffic control, and assumes control of the plane.  Pryor is romantically involved with Columbia's chief flight instructor Alan Murdock (Heston).  Both Murdock and Columbia exec Joe Patroni (Kennedy) jump on the company's small private jet, and head out to intercept Flight 409.  Eventually there seems to be only one possible course of action, dropping in a pilot via a line from a USAF helicopter.  When the air force pilot flies off into oblivion, it falls to Murdock to save the day.  The film does have an interesting finish as after landing safely, the passengers depart via air filled slides.

The roominess of the 747 is quite a change from the very tight quarters in the first film, and none of the passengers is seriously injured.  The pressure is squarely on Karen Black who has the key role.  She is very good under at displaying both fear and courage, as various people provide guidance over the radio, about how to fly the plane.  The level of tension remains high as long as she is piloting the plane.  Once Murdock is aboard, the film is essentially over.  Attention is given to the various passengers, but there isn't a lot of depth.  Film legend Gloria Swanson, in her last movie appearance, plays herself.  Travelling with her aide Winnie (Linda Harrison, Heston's costar Nova from Planet of the Apes), Swanson is engaged in the writing of her memoirs.  The Exorcist had just made Linda Blair a star, and she appears here as a patient on her way to get a kidney transplant operation.  Pop singer/songwriter Helen Reddy is a guitar strumming nun, while Susan Clark plays the wife of Joe Patroni.  Her conversation over the radio with her husband is one of the most awkward and uncomfortable moments in the movie.

Airport 1975 isn't a great film, but for its time it was quite exciting, and more important to Universal Pictures, quite profitable.  Except for Karen Black, Dana Andrews, Efrem Zimbalist Jr., and a few others, it's not a particularly well acted.  The success of the film would result in another sequel,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Airport-77/dp/6305137161/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Airport '77</a>&nbsp;where a 747 crashes in the Bermuda triangle, and sinks beneath the sea.",1298246400,,3779,5.142389525368249
934222,4,6304843267,"The incredible success of the 1970 film version of Arthur Hailey's novel ""Airport"" was in no small part responsible for having given birth to the first wave of disaster films that scarred their way through movie screens for much of the 1970s.  The peak of the disaster film genre was reached at the end of 1974 with three spectacularly successful (and critically panned) films that were the apotheosis of the form.  Two of them were THE TOWERING INFERNO and EARTHQUAKE.  The third one, of course, was AIRPORT 1975.

Since Hailey never repeated himself as a novelist, the subsequent three sequels to AIRPORT hewed only to the formula of people caught up in a mid-air crisis that had been inherent in both the book and the original 1970 film.  In the case of AIRPORT 1975 (or AIRPORT `75, for short), this involves a 747 jumbo jet flying from Washington to Los Angeles that, because of heavy fog along the California coastline, is forced to divert to Salt Lake City to allow conditions in L.A. to clear up.  But on final approach, the jet is hit at 12,000 feet by an out-of-control Cessna whose pilot (Dana Andrews) has suffered a fatal heart attack.  It is up to the plane's chief stewardess (Karen Black) to somehow keep the plane in level flight after the collision has badly injured the pilot (Efrem Zimbalist Jr.) and killed his two crewmen, until an elaborate mid-air rescue can be coordinated.  Not too surprisingly, George Kennedy returns as the tough-as-nails Joe Patroni, along with Charlton Heston doing one of his many heroic turns as the 747 instructor (and, of course, Black's love interest) who has to make the mid-air transfer and then bring the plane down safely.

As with its predecessor and the two ""Airport"" films still to come, AIRPORT `75 has a lot of clichs that would be skewered by the 1980 comedy blockbuster AIRPLANE!, notably Helen Reddy's performance as a singing nun.  There's also a bit of unintentional comedy in the form of former F Troop alum Larry Storch doing a turn as a publicity-seeking Salt Lake City TV news reporter.  It is when it is focused on the basic physics of the mid-air collision, Black's ability to keep the plane in flight until rescue arrives, and the rescue and landing itself that AIRPORT `75 is at its most intense.  Heston, not surprisingly, does his usual good heroic and professional turn in his role, as does Black in hers, though there are not enough sparks at the beginning of the film to keep their relationship from drifting towards standard disaster film melodrama.  Kennedy, as always, does his usual tough thing well as Patroni; and Susan Clark is good in a minor role as Kennedy's wife, who just happens to be on the plane in peril.

Given that any kind of collision, even with an out-of-control private plane, would be enough to bring any other jet plane down to the ground, both director Jack Smight (who directed the 1966 crime classic HARPER) and screenwriter Don Ingalls have to somehow cause the old suspension of disbelief stimuli to kick in with respect to this film's plot line.  Although they are not always successful at doing this, and the clichs do get in the way, they are successful enough to make AIRPORT `75 no worse than any other disaster film of its day.  Given this, it is no surprise that the critics should have ratted on this plane-in-peril piece, nor is it a surprise that AIRPORT `75's success should have continued the disaster film run to the end of the decade.",1267747200,,3456,4.71594684385382
934223,3,6304843267,"It wasn't until the 70s disaster movie craze was well under way that Universal got round to a sequel to its 1970 blockbuster Airport - largely because the lucrative profits deals Lancaster and Martin secured on the first film made reassembling the original cast impractical (though George Kennedy did return to provide a vague fig leaf of continuity). It wasn't until producer Jennings Lang came across a script intended as a TV movie that some bright spark thought of slapping the Airport brand on it, adding 1975 to the title and abandoning the actual Airport aspect to concentrate on the planes in jeopardy instead.

The result, Airport 1975 (actually released in 1974) is the other movie that Airplane! lampooned mercilessly, what with sick transplant patients, Hare Krishnas and singing nuns among the passengers, not to mention Charlton Heston in safari suit and shades providing the blueprint for Robert Stack's Rex Kramer and Gloria Swanson in the kind of comeback role that could have been written by Joe Gillis for Norma Desmond (although it was supposedly intended for Garbo). In fact, Swanson wrote her own anecdote-filled dialogue, and boy does it show - this isn't a part, it's a chat show appearance.

Swanson isn't the only star of yesteryear bulking up the cast, with Myrna Loy knocking back several boilermakers, Sid Caesar providing the odd wisecrack while Dana Andrews, every drink he ever took etched onto his face, gets his own back for Effrem Zimbalist crashing into his plane in The Crowded Sky by crashing into Zimbalist's 747 this time round, leaving stewardess Karen Black to fly the plane until Chucky baby comes to the rescue, taking off his shades for a midair transfer that's a mixture of daring stuntwork and pitiful backprojection. Yet it's surprisingly entertaining, superbly photographed by veteran Philip Lathrop, much better directed by Jack Smight than it has any right to be and, as the shortest entry in the series at 107 minutes, keeps things tight enough not to leave too much room to dwell on the absurdities. Well, almost: if ever there was a moment where Linda Blair projectile vomiting on a member of the cloth was not just absolutely justifiable but positively mandatory it's when Helen Reddy sings about her best friend being herself, but sadly Linda doesn't deliver the pea soup on this occasion. But while we may scoff today, Jennings Lang knew what he was doing - no singing nun movie has ever lost money at the box-office, and the film was a big enough hit to guarantee two more sequels with considerably bigger budgets, though not before, in one of those nasty ironies the series is prone to, Dana Andrews' light aircraft in the film really was destroyed in a mid-air collision in 1975. Oh, and if the midair footage looks familiar, that's because Universal recycled it for years, most memorably in the 747 episode of The Incredible Hulk TV series.",1232755200,,2901,4.930470347648262
934275,4,6304843267,"This sequel to the original ""Airport"" is much better written and acted.  Unlike the first ""Airport"" this film actually has suspense and a plot.  A small place crashes into a 747 (right into the cockpit, wouldn't you know) and either kills or severely injures the flight crew.  A stewardess is left to bring the jumbo jet safely back to earth.

Charlton Heston gives a pretty good performance as the boyfriend of the pilot/stewardess and other cast members like George Kennedy (how did he get so lucky to be in all of these movies?) and Karen Black portray believeable, if not a bit predictable, characters.  I will say the guys in the Salt Lake City air traffic control tower leave a lot to be desired, but they are the weakest of the film's cast.

In the end all is well and things work out.  While this is not a great movie, it is far superior to the extremely boring original.",1225584000,3,879,4.490566037735849

AIRPORT 1975 didn't have as many Oscar winners or the symbolic storyline that grabbed so many people as POSEIDON did, but it is filled with enough stars to make it worthwhile.  Charlton Heston is in a Charlton Heston role.  You have two actresses from the classic SUNSET BOULEVARD, Nancy Olson as the mother of the sick girl (Linda Blair!) and Gloria Swanson as Gloria Swanson (that's Linda Harrison, the incredibly hot Nova from the original PLANET OF THE APES as Gloria's assistant--but it's stewardess Karen Black who gets Charlton Heston in this movie).

Though edited to make it fit its two hour timeslot and allow room for commercials, I later purchased the video from Goodtimes Video to watch the parts not shown by NBC. From the beginning of the movie shot at Dulles Airport in northern Virginia, the cast who star as the crew and passengers aboard Columbia Airlines flight 409, board a Boeing 747-123 (on loan from American Airlines) and it is typical Hollywood overacting, particularly the passengers.

I've flown a lot during my lifetime, even aboard 747s, and have never heard so much redundancy as depicted in this movie.

Universal trucked out a cavalcade of stars that would definitely make the ""Match Game"" proud...Myrna Loy, Norman Fell, Sharon Gless, Helen Reddy (ICK!), Linda ""Gimme a Crucifix PLEASE!"" Blair, Jerry Stiller, Efrem Zimbalist, Jr., Susan Clark, Ed Nelson, Larry Storch, and even ""NOVA Herself""...Linda Harrison.

""autobiographer??""  ""Lesbian Lover""??  We never really get to find out what her real reason for being IN this film is because she has all but about 6 total words in her entire diologue.
ANYWAY..the ""thesps"" are also trucked out in true ""Airport"" fashion, with Dana Andrews having a heart attack and slamming his Cessna into the cockpit of a 747, wiping out its crew, and leaving the cross-eyed Karen Black to try to avoid driving her into a mountain by ""Just looking at the little plane on the horizon, honey"" or whatever rescue-honcho-hero-hubby Charlton Heston orders her to do while he tries to LOWER himself (via a rope) into the plane.  Of course, George Kennedy is on hand as Joe Patroni, who blurts out his lines with the subtelty of a sledgehammer, and whose dorky son, and over-acting wife just HAPPEN to be aboard.  The films lone saving grace is a truly strong performance turned in by Karen Black, who manages to make lines like ""Alan...I'm scared"" seem heartfelt and genuine.  But all is lost in a weak finale where NOTHING disastrous happens at all..yet everyone gets to slide down those fun-looking innertube things onto the runway.  I have always wanted to be in a plane that crashes, just so I could slide down one of those...ANYWAY, if its a choice between a rerun of ""Howard the Duck"" or this film..pick this film.

934341,4,6304843267,"AIRPORT 75 must have the least believable premise of any major Hollywood release that wasn't straight science fiction: a small private plane crashes into the cockpit of a giant 747 en route to Salt Lake City, and all the flight crew members are either killed outright or incapacitated as a result. So a stewardess (Karen Black, as bewitchingly crosseyed as ever) has to come into the remains of the damaged cockpit (which, despite the fact that it has a giant gaping hole in it, still manages to retain Black within it and does little more to her then make her chilly) and steer the plane to Salt Lake until Charlton Heston can be dropped by helicopter into the hole in the cockpit.

The premise was so outrageous even at the time that it quickly spawned two exceptionally memorable parodies: ""Disaster 75"" on THE CAROL BURNETT SHOW and AIRPLANE! (for which it was one of the primary sources of inspiration). But the original itself is so jawdroppingly strange it remains almsot beyond parody. The passengers are played by a series of Borscht Belt comedians like Sid Caesar and Jerry Stiller and Norman Fell, with the notable exceptions of a singing nun (Helen Reddy), a young girl with serious health problems (Linda Blair), and, most memorably, Gloria Swanson (as herself). The other stewardesses keep wandering in to the damaged cockpit to be comforted by Karen Black, whom one would think has enough problems as it is. Even if you can get beyond these thing, you find yourself fascinated by the questions the film's astonishingly bizarre details propose, such as why the airline's logo is so ugly and why its color scheme (bright red with violet and fuchsia accents!) is so hideous.",1054252800,24,1686,4.833910034602076
934342,3,6304843267,"Like everybody says, it's Karen Black's film, although George Kennedy and Machine-Gun Heston do a pretty good job of almost crashing the film through their own disasterous talents.
'Airport 1975' stars a few screen legends - Gloria Swanson (needs no intro), Dana Andrews (pilot of small private plane and big time movie star from 'While the City Sleeps,' 'Laura,' 'Tha Fallen Angel') and Myrna Loy, whose majority of spoken lines revolve around the subject of alcohol (a major nod to her 'Thin Man' series with William Powell).  Magic.
Best line:  George Kennedy, while clinging to the outside of an emergency vehicle that's speeding down the runway chasing the landed plane:  ""he can't stop her!!""  (Why he couldn't ride in the cab of the truck, I'll never know).
Also, contrary to popular belief, Charlton Heston did not lose his mind shortly after becoming president of the NRA.  He lost it in this film.  When he finally gets aboard the 747  - a plane Karen Black has been flying with no experience for the past hour - he gets right into the whining about 'back-up systems' and isn't sure whether the 'wheels are locked' and . . . oh, it goes on.  Hard to believe she bothers to walk off the plane with him at the end.

934401,4,6304843267,"My personal favourite of all the Airport movies, Airport 1975 is a camp classic. Right from the opening credits I am whisked away to the 70's and the familiar feeling of snuggling up at the drive-in....I can almost smell the thermos coffee. Airport 1975 doesn't take itself too seriously, yet all the characters play it straight. With a cast that reads like a guest list for a post Oscars party this movie seems to be full of cliches, yet it was this movie that started the said cliches, which I suppose debunks that theory. This is the movie that Airplane (aka Flying High) stuck closest too. With the sick child (Linda Blair), singing nun (Helen Reddy) and commitmentphobe pilot (Charlton Heston) all represented in the direct spoof. The movie however belongs to Karen Black, the poor old flight attendant. The plane is rendered pilotless when a midair collision with a small plane collides with the cockpit. Ms Black then has to take control of the 747 with no experience in flying whatsoever. Entertaining and hilarious.
I was disappointed however in the DVD which was very light on features. I would have loved to see a trailer, a commentary or better yet, a feature on all four Airport movies, but alas, it was not to be. I had to settle for a filmography on the top 2 stars only and that was it.
If you want a blast from the past, or are just fond of the disaster flicks churned out in the 1970's I would heartily recommend Airport 1975.",1029369600,15,1444,4.579150579150579
934402,5,6304843267,"Airport 1975 was the next film that came after the Movie Airport with Dean Martin.
This was the time when disaster film was being released once a year. The 1970's saw earthquakes, floods, airplane disasters and even meteorites.
I enjoyed this film better than the first `airplane disaster' flicks' because of actress Karen Black. (I also enjoyed her in Trilogy Of Terror) Although Charlton Heston is top billed it was really Karen's movie. Her dynamic performance and courage when forced to pilot a 747 were amazing.
The effects in the film were standard for this time in film history but the plane mock-ups were done very well. The supporting cast is sprinkled with celebrities and each has their own histories. People like George Kennedy, Linda Blair (a very sick child), Helen Reddy (as a singing nun), Sid Cesear, Myna Loy, Larry Storch and many more.
This movie has a lot of heart and passion and the plan sequences are very good. Basically two planes crash in mid-air. The rest is land the plane with no pilots while flying over the Rocky Mountains. Wow!",1025654400,8,1060,4.797814207650274

When i first saw this movie at a drive-in, i thought the co-pilot was sucked out and up, as into outer space, i guess i didn't know about gravity or pressure differential then.

934405,5,6304843267,"This movie, which seemed pretty campy in 1975, has become funnier and funnier as time has gone on, mainly because of the incredibly dated and sexist script.  For the two of you who haven't heard, the plot involves the flight crew of a 747 being wiped out in a mid-air collision, leaving stewardess Karen Black to fly the plane.  The hilarious flight scenes are the best- to the tune of the most ominous music imaginable, and at the command of Charlton Heston, Karen bravely, tearfully... turns a dial.  Yep, that's pretty much it.  Then they make a big deal that Karen couldn't possibly land the plane by herself.  Well, since an earlier scene (before the crash) showed her operating a galley coffeemaker that was slightly less complicated than rebuilding a carbuerator, I think she can handle twisting a few knobs, especially (I guess they couldn't afford to annoy Boeing, the maker of the plane) since they take pains to tell you how the 747 is the best plane that has ever been created, is called the ""Flying Pussycat"", ""practically flies itself"" is better than anything, will even drop over to detail your car if you ask it nice.  Well, maybe not that, but they lay it on pretty thick.
But no, they decide to drop a pilot inot the speeding plane from a helicopter.  When Captain Stock Character fails to make it in, it's up the heroic Chuckles to save the day.
The performances in this movie are uniformly hilarious, most not meaning to be.  Heston, is, well, Charlton Heston, and that's worth a laugh from the get-go.  Karen Black goes way out on a limb with her performance, and cuts it off behind her (when she comes out of the cockpit to tell the cast that a pilot is aboard the plane, she looks as if she was expecting them to give her an Oscar or something).  Linda Blair, in a vain attempt to make us forget her performance in the ""Exorcist"", plays the character of the little girl in need of a new kidney so saccharine-sweet your teeth will ache; and you still expect her to levitate and puke pea soup.  But Gloria Swanson takes the cake with an amazingly self-aggrandising performance, basically selling her book by referring to it about every ten seconds (She was writing one in real life), or telling Sid Caesar ""in 1922 I flew non-stop from Hollywood to Pasadena.  Do you know who the pilot was?  Cecil B. DeMille.  He did loop-the-loops all the way back so I could see the moon upside-down""
You can imagine the look on his face.",1013731200,12,2445,4.552511415525114
934406,3,6304843267,"Charlton Heston does his best here, in the 1974 sequel to the original blockbuster ""Airport"".  Good visual effects are on hand this time (beating out the 1970 Airport effects by a large margin), with lots of excellent aerial footage of the stricken Boeing 747-100 aircraft in flight, after a collision with a small prop plane. But this version lacks the crisp, witty dialogue so prevalent in the first Airport flick. Still, this one is worth taking a look at.  My rating would actually be 3-and-a-half stars.",1007164800,,508,4.895348837209302
934407,5,6304843267,"In college, my friend Scott (who also reviewed this for Amazon) and I used to watch this movie incessantly.  I had seen Airplane and wondered why they even bothered.  Airport '75 is the height of self-parody.  Rather than evaluate it on its merits - none - I will simply list for you many of its classic camp moments and the joy they have brought over the years to me and mine.  Herewith:  Karen Black period but especially when she first sees the hole in the cockpit and for the five second hysterical outburst ""There's no one to fly the plane!  Oh, my God!  Help us!"" after which she collapses as if she has just channeled every Hitchcock heroine from Ingrid Bergman to Tippi Hedren to well, herself in Family Plot.  Karen's other fine moments include the tongue as grapple hook moment when she pulls Charlie boy on board and her deathless line, ""We're all alone now Beth.""
Moving on to Gloria Swanson.  Apparently no one told her the movie was not called ""Gloria Swanson's Brush With Death"".  She gives it everything she's got, and it's still a crushing blow to me that it is a double wrapped in that hooded black fur coat coming down the slide at the end.  And let's give it up to Myrna Loy, drunk, drunk, drunk and still with more class in her little finger than well, never mind.  And let's consider for just a moment how they could have ever thought the plane would get further than 15,000 feet with Regan, I mean, Linda Blair on board.  You know something horrible is going to happen.  I won't even go into how horrible Charleton Heston is.  Okay, so maybe I'm swayed by the fact that he's a fascist, gun-toting psycopath in real life, but really, he couldn't ever act beyond gritting his teeth.  In truth, I can't think of anyone better to play the part.  And finally, let me give props to Miss Candy Clark who somehow pulls a little bit of sass and dignity out of her character.  Her ""We love you"" moment with George Kennedy is the only real thing that happens in the film.
Okay, so I couldn't get to everything, but this movie - from the blaring trumpets to the horrible day for night editing of the exterior shots - is a stone cold blast.  It's Karen Black's world, welcome to it.",1005004800,6,2192,4.4214463840399
934408,3,6304843267,"Chuck Heston must groan everytime this movie is brought up.  It is probably the worst movie he was ever involved with.  While the special effects are not bad, the story and the characters are laughable.
Actually, so laughable it is worth buying the DVD.

934409,3,6304843267,"Airport 1975 has a made for television feel about it - but it works well as a big screen film. Charlton Heston is remarkably little used, and completely sexist macho throughout the film, as are the pilots who seem to think the Flight Attendants are nothing more than bimbo's to be slept with.
However, a particular moment when George Kennedy (as Patroni) speaks to his wife from the ground (they're on the plane) almost brings you to tears - and it's that piece of acting which surprised the hell out of me - very very good.
Other than that, Karen Black seems to enjoy herself, as does Gloria Swanson. Helen Reddy sings a twee little song, and Linda Blair manages to look like the most gorgeous sick girl you've ever seen. The aerial photography is very nice, however the dramatic landing with Heston at the controls is a bit of a let down at the end.
The DVD transfer is not all that crash hot. Some digital masking can be seen in certain points, making it a bit difficult to watch in places. You get used to it later on though. It would have also been nice if the DVD had things on it like a theatrical trailer - it's very bare bones. So a new DVD release would be nice.
A lot of this film was later spoofed in Airplane (or Flying High as it was called in Australia) - and it's not hard to see why. The character reactions are extremely overdone in some parts, but overall it's worth a look.",980812800,3,1393,4.300380228136882

Sarting with the flawed premise of a red eye flight that goes from East to West, or the pilot lighting up a cigar in the cockpit,  or Linda Blair playing the child being flown across the country for her renal transplant its just filled with the improbable and impossible and As a commentary on aviation 43 years ago the most amazing thing for me was the depictions of Dulles International Airport.

7878212,3,6304843267,"Airport 1975 is a film I wasn't sure if it was supposed to be a comedy or thriller, I was thinking the former before the event on the cover of the DVD takes place, and I thought I guess this is a survival thriller then. But before that we'd had a lot of cheesy lines between passengers and flight crew,a lot in relation to trying to hook up. You had your staple addition of nuns and a sick girl that most movies from this era have, as passengers on board the plane too.  Obviously we've had plenty of aircraft in peril movies since 1974, as well as plenty of documentary style re-enactment aircraft crash/in trouble shows too.  So they make the lack of anyone getting sucked out of the cockpit, the unmoving hair on the flight attendant's head, the clown level applied makeup face not washing off with rain and wind on the face of the woman who is now responsible for flying the plane and the seemingly unaffected rest of the plane's interior seem a bit fake. Not to mention a helicopter that can fly faster than a 747 and the fact that passengers can look out the side windows and somehow see everything taking place in front of the nose of the plane.  The cockpit (roof and all) seemed to be intact on a lot of the external shots of the 747 flying in clear weather when storms are supposed to be so bad they've been diverted to the only airport safe to land at before the collision and things like that don't help with the believability either.  But in its time it was likely more believable. The cast of well known actors would have been the selling point anyway. Interesting just to see how society was back in the 70's with smoking on planes/the airport and things like this.  The limitation on how much they could allow a female character to save the day and aspects like this also shows in the script.",1510963200,,1808,4.369047619047619
