8422987,2,B004CG2BJ6,"Battle Royale(2000) was a great action-horror-drama film directed by the late Kinji Fukasaku. It was a satire of our dog-eat-dog world.
His son was hired to complete Battle Royale II Requiem(2003). The music score was good, it had high production values and an ultra-pretty female lead who looks like an anime character.
However, the movie itself was a giant trainwreck! The plot and characterization was a mess! A dictatorship forces school children to hunt down Nanahara Shuya from the first film. There is anti-US propaganda that comes from nowhere. A building that looks like the World Trade Center is blown up by Nanahara Shuya. This movie has a giant body count that will leave you feeling numb! This is just like The Exorcist II(1977); it is ONE OF THE WORST SEQUELS EVER MADE! Battle Royale was great. Watch Battle Royale II if you're strong enough.",1521417600,,857,4.917241379310345
