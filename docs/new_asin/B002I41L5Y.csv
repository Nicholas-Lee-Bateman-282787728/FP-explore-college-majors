8370716,3,B002I41L5Y,"I liked this movie for the overall story, however, it won't win any awards.
The story is about a ""licentious"" blond who marries a wealthy man for his money and position. He belongs to the ""horsey"" set and rides at his country estate. She on the other hand likes men...all men..any men and goes out of her way to annoy her husband who has resigned himself to having a ""tart"" as a wife. The next door neighbor (a single women who is also in the horsey set) wants to comfort him in his hour of need. The wife is murdered and the the police are hot on the trail to convict the husband. BUT...things are not quite as they seem with a lot of guessing and plodding by the police and the husband trying to rise above it all..and stay out of jail...overall a good movie with a different ending...good print and sound. A British film set after WW2 circa 1950ish..??",1260057600,,855,4.316770186335404
8370717,4,B002I41L5Y,"The American version of WICKED WIFE (known as ""Grand National Night"" in Britain) was trimmed from its original 80 minute running time to about 75.

The Grand National is a famous steeplechase held at a track just outside Liverpool. The majority of this taut little crime drama occurs after a principal character's horse wins that event.

SYNOPSIS--
Gerald and Babs Coates (Patrick and Lister) have an incompatible marriage. Her love of an urban lifesytle directly opposes his career choice of country-based horse trainer. On her not infrequent excursions from rural Chillington to Liverpool, Babs does more than take in a movie-- she also cheats on Gerald.

Gerald's entry finishes first in the Grand National and Babs drives alone to Liverpool to ""celebrate."" While there, she's rebuffed by current boyfriend Jack Donovan (Mitchell). After an intoxicated commute home, Babs quarrels with Gerald and pulls a knife on him. He responds by knocking her out. The next morning, Babs' body is found in the driver's seat of Donovan's car.

Police Inspector Ayling (Hordern) determines that Donovan has a solid alibi, so his investigation focuses on the husband, who has already confessed to a lady friend (Campbell) fears that he may have accidentally killed his wife. When a train ticket from Chillington to Liverpool is found in Gerald's coat pocket Ayling is set to arrest him, until a phone call changes his plans....
