3545587,3,B001E39XZA,"Ok, but not as good as I was expecting it to be. I guess I was looking for more info EXACTLY what and how the sex goes on. Kinda just skimming over the info.",1264723200,2,157,3.6470588235294117
3545588,5,B001E39XZA,"This awesome filmmic trip through the one of the grittiest aspects of prison life - the subjugation and rape of the weak by the strong - held me spellbound. Kind of like having a dream while you're awake. It also provides prisoners' surprisingly stoic insights into what they get from benign homosexual relationships (more than just sex). A must see for anyone interested in just how twisted - and suprisingly tender - prison life can be.  Actor Danny Trejo, who narrates, is a great touch, and the soundtrack is seductive.  ""Turned Out"" has great picture quality and a very high end encoding standard for a home DVD.
For an independent documentary the extra features were indeed excellent.  Extra features include in-depth interviews with assaulted inmates, interviews with main characters five years after the original filming, an interview with a female rape victim, an image gallery, and music videos by rappers C-Nile and Juvenile, and by country singer/convict Denver Holloway.",1236124800,25,983,5.169811320754717
3545589,3,B001E39XZA,"This is a fascinating, if inherently disturbing subject and video. I find the prison subculture (gangs, isolation, extraction teams, and especially the many ways prisoners make do in creating their own meals) and all the myriad dynamics at play to literally be a world unto itself. I don't know how they pulled off scoring Danny T to narrate this, but kudos to the production team on that one. That said, this documentary does have a couple positives - first, it looks at both sides of this issue: the predator, and the prey. The downside, is that it pretty much focuses on one of each. It doesn't do a good job of interviewing a wider number of predators and victims (or, in some cases, willing participants), and in that way it does not provide as full a picture as I'd hoped. So, it's an OK rental, but you will probably end up disappointed, unless you are one of the unfortunate few who has a term in prison pending, and is looking for some inside info and guidance as to how to behave once the gates close behind them.",1422403200,3,1023,4.475935828877005

3545593,2,B001E39XZA,"It's not totally about prison rape as many have said in reviews below.. It's more about prison culture and homosexuality.. anyway, it was a boring documentary.. Didn't even watch the entire thing because it was basically what I imagined prison to be like and there are many more interesting documentaries than this one about prison life..",1413417600,,338,5.053571428571429
3545594,3,B001E39XZA,it was informative especially if you plan on working in corrections,1410393600,,67,5.181818181818182

3545596,3,B001E39XZA,Good documentary. Really goes into detail about life behind bars for some individuals.,1404950400,3,86,5.6923076923076925

3545598,5,B001E39XZA,"This Documentary is worth watching. Gives you insight that goes far beyond what others have accomplished in the past.

This would be the documentary that OZ tried to accomplish on screen!!!",1393286400,2,189,5.096774193548387
3545599,5,B001E39XZA,Provides a look into sex behind bars and the hierarchy of the system at a prison in the south. Plus the prison they call Mindy is a cute ginger.,1389484800,,144,4.0
3545600,4,B001E39XZA,Needs more rape. It was very interesting but was over when it just started getting good. Why isn't this a series?,1387497600,,113,4.428571428571429
3545601,5,B001E39XZA,This was very well done.  It was surprising that straight men who got turned-out by their daddies had real affection for each other. This means that human beings do have feelings.,1372118400,,179,4.774193548387097
3545602,1,B001E39XZA,Just the most sick 45 mins of my life turned it off early thought it would be like lockup. It's like watching sex criminals get turned on with no condemnation of it They just tell the story of sex freaks like its normal. Sick sick disturbing sick.,1368748800,2,247,4.276595744680851
3545603,5,B001E39XZA,I liked this documentary its very intense and scary and real and dramatic...I think it's a must see without the kids in earshot.,1362355200,3,128,4.608695652173913
3545604,1,B001E39XZA,This film did not give a far ranging coverage of the topic. It was far too narrow in its focus.,1360108800,,95,3.8
3545605,3,B001E39XZA,How can I write a review for a book I have never read let alone use 14 words? Thanks but I can't spend time writing a review.,1359849600,,125,3.6666666666666665
3545606,4,B001E39XZA,"I gave Turned Out: Sexual Assault Behind Bars 4 stars because I didn't feel comfortable stating I ""loved"" a documentary about prison rape. I don't know how the film makers were able to get such candid interviews from inmates. The inmates' description of the depravity that exists within prison walls are the ingredients of nightmares. This documentary should be a required addition to any ""scared straight"" program. If you have a morbid curiosity about the social dynamics that exists in prisons, watch this, you won't be disappointed.",1358380800,8,535,5.160919540229885
3545607,3,B001E39XZA,it was ok.  yet just barely.  After reading the review I figured it would be riveting.  Not for me.  Kind of lame actually.  More like 2.5 stars.,1358294400,,145,4.222222222222222
3545608,5,B001E39XZA,"A look at prison rape, prison sex and relationships that is not sensationalized for media but a revealing and sometimes touching understanding of what happens.",1354579200,2,159,5.4
3545609,5,B001E39XZA,"This video takes you inside the prison to see what is really going on in there. It's not going to be well received by people who feel strong judgement against people in prison, it might even make you judge them more. But if you're like me, and have had family and friends who have been incarcerated, and they 'didn't want to talk about it' once they got home, this gives you an idea of the atmosphere inside and why people become hardened and institutionalized from being behind bars. This is a look inside for those of us who have never been there, and yes it is shot with compassion towards the prisoners. For me personally, this gave me some insight and understanding about a topic I always wanted to know about, but none have ever told me about their direct experiences. When I was done watching this I was so glad that it had been made available so easily here on Amazon.",1346889600,6,876,4.41358024691358
3545610,1,B001E39XZA,"This book is rotten. It is a waste if both time and didn't even finish the book. Once i'd put it down there was no use picking it Back up again.
By far, the worst book I've read!!",1341273600,,179,3.736842105263158
3545611,4,B001E39XZA,Very interesting insight on what really goes on in prison..without telling anything it's only $2.99 if you're curious watch it.,1339113600,2,127,5.4
3545612,5,B001E39XZA,"""Turned Out: Sexual Assault Behind Bars"" is a good place to start understanding such assaults. It's also an important corrective to the misunderstandings created by well intentioned networks of prisoner-rights activists and academics. Misunderstandings created by this network stem from ideological baggage brought to the subject by feminist theory extrapolated into the world of male prisons. In this construct, men reduced to sexual slavery by other men in prison are ""substitute women"" in a binary world of masculine-feminine/men-women/strong-weak whose essential purpose is to establish male power by, in the language of post-modernism, allowing those labeled ""men"" to ""perform"" masculinity via its opposite, the imposed femininity of raped men. Rape is thus about power, not about sex.

The essential errors of this view are clear in ""Turned Out."" The feminist and post-modernist need to separate out and deny the powerful sexual and emotional impulses behind prison sexual assault, a need of these ideologies that cries out for analysis, is unsustainable once we see here the undeniable and undeniably unhealthy integration of power, sexual desire, and yes, love in the motivation of those guilty of horrendous acts. For instance, the two prisoners focused on here, Mark the prison daddy and Mindy his ""boy"" are obviously in love. Yet their relationship began as an exploitative one in which Mark used trickery and manipulation called ""the boo-game"" to maneuver Mindy into sexual submission. In another case, the rape of a young man named Iddy by Mark and another prisoner is recounted in detail. We then learn and that Iddy subsequently became an enthusiastic prison sissy, ""tossing the a-- everywhere"" in Mark's word, then lived as a drag-queen after his release. These conflations of violence, desire and genuine love are extremely disturbing and complex, demanding complex models of analysis and explanation. Wide-spread feminist distortions around these issues, however, systematically deny their existence. ""Turned Out"" can at least introduce viewers to the realities of this world in their bizarre nuances much better than much of the recent activism and research on prison sexuality.",1335571200,4,2197,5.519287833827893
3545613,1,B001E39XZA,"Don't judge this dvd by it's cover.....It looked like it was going to bo a good one from the start. The cover looks tough the topic is an eye catcher, the start of the documentary is good....and then...forget about it. I had a classroom full of at-risk teens and they all, including my self, wanted to change the channel. Like Danny! but he's not even involved with the interviewing.....save your money. Sorry Danny this is not your best work, I liked your videos for AA much better!",1299110400,2,483,4.563218390804598
3545614,2,B001E39XZA,"It was very boring and dull, im thinking that it was going to look in on like real prison in the newer years, it was like watching prison with ugly black and whites in the 1980s, if I known it was a prison in Alabama, i wouldn't have wasted my money omg",1296691200,4,253,3.8846153846153846
3545615,4,B001E39XZA,I feel that this documentary was informative.  I have two young boys and I like to have visual documents to deter them from doing the wrong thing.  This type of up front information helped me with my older two.  Thanks for the prompt response.,1272153600,,243,4.4772727272727275
3545616,5,B001E39XZA,This films just goes to show that anything is possible when you are in a constricted area like that. Quite informative and interesting.,1269648000,2,135,4.913043478260869

3545618,5,B001E39XZA,"Excellent documentary on sodomy in the prison system. From pimps to hoes, this ones got it all. Might be shocking to some, but almost makes you want to get locked up to see how many guys you can get to be your bitch. Very good video.
