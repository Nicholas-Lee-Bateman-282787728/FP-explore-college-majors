It is about two high school students who are ""anti-love,"" who pretend to date each other because the female lead (Masuzu Natsukawa) is tired of guys asking her out all the time, and blackmails the male lead (Eita Kido) into it by threatening to expose his embarrassing diary that she found (consisting of his fantasies of his past life). She starts a club to help other girls become who they want to be. The competing girls for the male lead's affections include his childhood friend (Chiwa Harusaki - AKA ""Chihuahua-chan""), then later a shy girl who thinks she was his lover in their past life (Himeka Akishino), and one of the school's hall monitors who thinks she is his fiance because they signed a marriage agreement in kindergarten (Ai Fuyuumi - AKA ""A-chan"").

The title, Oreshura, is short for ""Ore no Kanojo to Osananajimi ga Shuraba Sugiru,"" which translates as ""My Girlfriend and Childhood Friend Fight Too Much""

It's directed by Kanta Kamei, studio A-1 Pictures, and licensed by Aniplex. It was originally aired January 6, 2013  March 31, 2013. The original manga was written by Yji Yji and published by Square Enix.",1401753600,2,1305,4.761061946902655
