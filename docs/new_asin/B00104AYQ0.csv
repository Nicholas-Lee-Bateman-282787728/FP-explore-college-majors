8236792,2,B00104AYQ0,"This film is not great and it's pretty much propaganda but observing several of Britains leading ladies together is very enjoyable and quite pleasing to the eye. Phyllis Calvert and Patricia Roc - 2 of Englands top female stars during the 1940's - headline this  picture about English women held in an internment camp in France by the Nazis. Wonderful Flora Robson is a joy (as always) as a prim lady who takes no guff from anyone much less Hitlers henchmen. Joining them are Dulcie Gray, Anne Crawford, Jean Kent - as a sexy tart doing whatever it takes to keep herself comfotable - Thora Hird and Betty Jardine round out the cast. It should be noted that Ms. Jardine  died a year after this film during childbirth. All in all I enjoyed the film more so to watch some of Englands top actresses of the day. Ms. Roc is easily the lovliest of the group and even made a western in Hollywood in 1946 called Canyon Passage with Susan Hayward. I gave it 2 stars not because of the acting but of the storyline. Also the dvd I have is not a great copy. Thats not the fault of the distributor I bought it from. This is just another one of those old films that needed restoration and some tlc before being released.",1238025600,5,1205,4.375
