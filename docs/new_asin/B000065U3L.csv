1709220,5,B000065U3L,"What can I say, but I really enjoyed watching this movie.  It was a fun throw back to 70's grind house style action movies.  I could almost imagine that I was at the drive-in for a double feature while watching Death Machines. Next time, I'll remember the pop corn.  Also, watch it a second time through with the directors commentary.  It is great to get the inside scoop on how the movie was made.  There are also some fun anticdoes in the commentary.",1404345600,,452,4.397590361445783
1709221,4,B000065U3L,"An ambitious mafia queen with big hair that would make Jim Kelly proud, uses three kung fu trained zombies (with bullet proof jackets) to force a takeover of all assassinations in town. The killers hardly speak, in fact they never question orders thanks to heavy doses of mind control drugs. Several brutal assaults follow unheeded warnings as people are put-down in broad daylight. The zombies go after a kung fu instructor but chop up the whole class in order to not leave any witnesses in this bloody scene. The competition is blown up, thrown off a building, stalked relentlessly, and forced out of a restaurant after the zombies turn it into a drive-thru. One of the trio (Ron Marchini) is caught and while in the police station, stages a jailbreak with some bone-cracking moves escaping with the use of a human shield that gets blown away. A crippled survivor from one of their massacres pursues them while trying to restart his life. An equal opportunity action movie, many racial groups are represented here. All the brutal action, and comedy from some of the dialogue kept me entertained. Fullscreen/cropped dvd from rhino has a very good picture special features-trailer. 16x9 dvd from Germany looks great. The U.S. trailer promotes Death Machines as a futuristic scifi film. *UPDATE* code red has released it here in original aspect ratio with director Paul Kyriazi commentary",1364169600,,1387,5.008658008658009
1709222,2,B000065U3L,"Paul Kyriazi's ""Death Machines"" is a peculiar 1976 entry into the martial arts genre which blossomed in the 1970s. The film suffers from several problems, not the least of which is its lack of marketing clarity: the promotional copy and cover art imply this is a futuristic sci-fi death struggle, but it's actually a martial arts action movie pitting the Mafia versus the Yakuza filmed in Stockton, California. This lack of clarity assuredly cost the film viewers, and the viewers that did see it were doubtlessly not impressed with its futuristic pretentions.

Right off the bat let me say my single biggest problem with the movie is the nails-on-a-blackboard electronic synthesizer score. It is a distraction at best, and at worst a reason to take the disk out of the player and break it into tiny pieces with a hammer. Long after I've forgotten the green skin tones, the eye-poppingly ugly plaid suits, the ponderous dialogue, and the giant-haired dragon lady, I will remember never to watch this again due to the music.

The plot is a bit convoluted, though it really is simply a pretense for the fighting and mayhem. In the beginning an Asian master criminal explains how through the use of a mind control drug, three super assassins have been created which will eliminate the competition and serve the nefarious plans of the Yakuza. The Mafia contingent is headed up by Mr. G, a man whose bad temper is equaled only by his wardrobe selections and acting ability. He's distraught that his men are being bumped off by the intruding assassins, and a sort of war breaks out. Along the way there is an attack on a karate dojo, killing everyone except one student who loses a hand. He becomes the protagonist long after the film has started, and despite his vows of vengeance, he proves in one of the worst-staged bar fights ever, that he can take one punch and fall down. There is a sympathetic renegade cop on the case (one point of realism is the police involvement: the Stockton Police Department fully supported the film,) and with the help of the single-handed bartender, the police begin to close in on the killers.

There are many subplots that are wholly unnecessary: the exploding banker, the biker versus assassin restaurant brawl (complete with religious music,) and the whole mind-control drug premise itself just to name a few. This scattershot approach really dilutes the impact of the film and makes an average 1970s martial arts film more boring that the norm. Besides the music and the frequent plot tangents, other problems abound. The film features some glaring skin tone problems, most notable on the police Captain, which are highly distracting as well as highly amusing. The fight choreography and accompanying sound effects are atrocious, particularly in the bar fight, but also in the dojo as well. The film's abrupt amoral conclusion was unsatisfying, though did leave the sequel option open.

Director Kyriazi has written an excellent online review explaining many of the directorial choices, and even if I'm not a huge fan of the final product, I recommend reading his account of the film. He frankly acknowledges some of its foibles, and his candor and insight is highly readable and interesting, especially for fans of B-movies. I found ""Death Machines"" slow and implausible, I didn't really like any of the characters, and the acting and production values are middling at best. Having said that, fans of 1970's action or martial arts films will appreciate seeing this once.",1322006400,4,3504,4.933898305084746
1709223,2,B000065U3L,"Disclaimer:  Here's another little gem included in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Savage-Cinema-12-Movie-Collection/dp/B00310PSUI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Savage Cinema: 12 Movie Collection</a>.  Transfer and sound in that format seems sufficient, but I can't comment on the quality as sold as an individual disc.  This review is only concerned with the entertainment value of the film.

Hoo-boy, where to  begin.  A shadowy organization, fronted by the mysterious dragon lady, Madame Lee, is trying to become the only game in town for assassination contracts.  To further their goals, they bring three killers under some kind of mind control, and send them off on missions to wipe out the competition.  Once the other operatives in town are gone, the local syndicate has no option but to come to Madame Lee's door and pay her price for services required.

Along the way, we get green police officers, barroom brawls, bazookas, love in the afternoon, and prosthetic devices.  Looking at the cover for this DVD release, it's difficult to know what this film is about - it probably most reminds me of 'Carousel' from 'Logan's Run' - but in reality it's a fairly standard action/martial arts film, with a young bystander who survives one of the attacks by the three assassins (the 'Death Machines') bent on revenge, and the cops who are committed to tracking down and stopping the assassins. I would rank this film just below the quality of an early Chuck Norris film , so that might be a helpful reference point for some people.  The location of the film is static (Stockton), the choreography of the fight scenes is weak, and the story is paper thin, so on second thought, it reminds me of any Steven Seagal movie from the last five years.  And, also like Seagal, we get a few inadvertently humorous scenes too, ably pointed out already by some of the other reviewers.

Although I give the crew some credit for effort, this one just doesn't have enough oomph to make it worth the time involved in tracking down a copy to watch, nor does it have enough unintentional entertainment value.  Best watched by insomniacs, twelve-year-olds, and action junkies on late night television.

Apologies to Woody Allen for stealing his line for my title.",1285632000,4,2285,5.204918032786885
1709224,5,B000065U3L,"You are a terrible director, but god-dammit I respect you. Your films represent a steaming pile of malodorous fecal matter (AKA caca.) Your work on Omega Cop can be described as atrocious, deplorable and magnificent! You capture the feel of a post apocalyptic city just as well as John Mark Carr exudes masculinity. The next time both of you appear on film it better be on an episode of Autopsy, although I wish no ill will towards you.

1709225,3,B000065U3L,"So you've finally achieved your lofty goal of developing a drug that will allow you to completely control the mind and will of others. What's next? Isn't it obvious? You hire a weird Yakuza woman to test the product on three surly brutes and then unleash them as assassins on an unsuspecting lower rung of the local assassination ladder. When you take out all of the other assassins, those wanting to arrange for a hit will have to come to you and pay your price. That's just what happens in this film - except the mastermind puts in a shadowy appearance at the beginning and never returns. Now about this drug - OK, I can buy the mind control thing, but I'm really not clear on how these three assassins are able to withstand multiple gunshot wounds to the chest, or why they don't speak at all in their newly servile condition. They do good work, though. Take, for example, their attack on a Japanese martial arts facility - it's basically a slaughter. They aren't perfect, though, as they leave one karate student alive (albeit suddenly one-handed), thus indirectly inflicting upon the viewer a slight and awkward romantic sub-plot involving this lone survivor and a nurse who actually likes the guy for some incomprehensible reason. At the same time, you also have a subplot involving the local detectives dedicated to finding the killers. Here we learn that police captains are obsessed with making their men attend human relations classes. Our man, Ferguson, is an old-school investigator who doesn't cotton to ridiculous stuff like that, preferring to spend his time actually hunting bad guys. This leads to some interesting confrontations between him and his supervisor.

Ah, you're probably wondering about the fight scenes. Well, with all of these sub-plots swimming around the same small fish bowl, action sometimes get pushed aside temporarily. It's probably just as well because the fights appear staged and rehearsed as often as not (the only really good action takes place inside the police station). In some cases, the assassins don't even rely on actual fighting. Let me paint you a picture of my favorite scene in the movie. You have this jogger who is marked for death, and his would-be assassin sets himself up behind his car directly in the sight path of the approaching victim (who miraculously never notices him or his very large rifle). Meanwhile, the three ""Death Machines"" drive up, park about twenty feet behind the original assassin, and take him out with a - well, let's just say it's a case of definite overkill. It's definitely not cricket for a martial arts purist.

This film seems to have a slight identity crisis at times, and you almost have to laugh at a scene here and there, but I'll be dadgummed if I didn't enjoy watching the thing. Like most low-budget kung fu-related films, you have to sort of go with the flow as far as the plot is concerned, but any fan of the genre will already be used to doing that. These same fans may not be used to waiting so long in between fight scenes, though - and, in this case, those fight scenes also happen to be relatively unimpressive. On the other hand, this is probably the only kung fu film featuring an Ernest Hemingway look-a-like starting a barroom brawl - and that's something they can never take away from Death Machines.",1188432000,4,3308,4.771378708551484
1709226,4,B000065U3L,"I stumbled upon this movie quite by accident. Being an avid web log reader, I was surfing and came across a weblog titled FeatureFilmDirector. (xanga.com/FeaureFilmDirector) I  read an entry about the making of this movie called Death Machines. The owner of the web log claimed to the Director of this movie as well as several others. Never trusting anything I read on the net, I came to Amazon and found the movie was available on DVD and ordered it. After reading the weblog entry on the making of Death Machines I knew what ""parts"" to look for. It was really a fun experience having the inside scoop on the movie and then being able to see the feature come alive. True to his word, this name appeared as Director of the film in the credits.

I found the movie a fun ""step back in time."" After reading the Directors accounts and stories of how certain things had to be done as well as the actual budget of the film... I think it is a great testament to low budget films!",1113696000,6,972,4.394444444444445
1709227,5,B000065U3L,"The story is simple. A yakuza type woman takes control of all the gangland killings in her town using three kung fu killers. But the plot throws so many exploitable characters and situations into it, it plays like a fun mix of ""Pulp Fiction"" and a Road Runner cartoon.
There are cops, gangsters, karate teachers, lovers, bikers, and bartenders. The action sequences are varied and bizarre like the one where the three killers whip out a karate school full of students. Or when one of the killers fights his way out of a police station. Or the three of them take on bikers in a roadside cafe.

There is a hero. A guy who gets his hand cut off in the karate school and goes after the killers. There is even a psycho style ending. Too bad this obviously lower budget film didn't have any stars in it. If it had Travolta and Willis we could have had ""Pulp Fiction"" 20 years sooner.",1031788800,5,877,4.380368098159509
