8532207,5,B008XKKGLC,"I have watched this video multiple times.  And each time I grow fonder of it.  The description given to it on Amazon by Mary's Dowry Productions is accurate.  The film is prayerful, the music soothing, the narration by Emily Jane Bevans is wonderful.  Her voice is peaceful.  I see myself watching this video several times a year for the rest of my life.",1512864000,,354,4.555555555555555
