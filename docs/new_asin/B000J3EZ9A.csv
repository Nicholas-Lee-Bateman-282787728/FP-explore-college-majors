No one believes their story and they go out on their own to solve this case. This movie is a lot of fun. There are serious moments but the kids all seem to really care and love each other. They seem to work as an ensemble. The dreams, goals and desires of these kids are all out in the open. They struggle to survive. Each going through a set of problems. But they remain loyal and strong with each other. Teenagers and young people will love his film. I watched my nephews watch this film over and over. These kids are no thugs and they really want to prove it. Get your copy now. It is a great movie to curl up to with your teenager.",1402185600,,783,4.058064516129032

Some stopped talking to each other. Some went out on dates. But the fact was that they grew as a family and are now young men and women. This movie lead to a series in which the kids trained, wrote, shot and discovered the world of filmmaking. Some have went on and continue to study in the business. This film is a fun film with lots of great moments.",1392768000,,505,4.101010101010101
