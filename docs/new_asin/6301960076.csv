7817773,3,6301960076,"Why why why I mean why did you love that ugly woman not me?
The beautiful wife asks the husband.
This movie won the Grand Price at Canne the second best price. Why why why?
Let's find out.
The director  Bertrand Blier made many love songs like <GET OUT YOUR HANDKERCHIEF> the movie I will never understand a husband who give up his wife to another man because he only interested in her happiness and the guy who is in love with her is he thought he will be better for her.
Or other movies like <HOW MUCH DO YOU LOVE ME?> a boxoffice hit in France
Or <Beau-pre > A girl who's mother dies and falls in love with the stepfather chist!
and so on. He knows how to deal with the audience and also he is quite a storyteller about love.

Now this movie?
Yes it's about a man a mid aged man whom everyone is jealous of because of his lovely beautiful goddess looking woman.
Why why why is he fall in love with this ugly fat woman who happens to be his secretary?

The answer is quite simple.
She has this mother like heart. Warmth perhaps.
But for me? I am a wordly man I guss.
This part I didn't followed.
The woman he felt in love I didn't felt in love like he did.
The wife was a decent woman with two children birth to him.
Why why why did he felt in love with this lady?
Like his other movie <GET OUT YOUR HANDKERCHIEF> a bunch of question lingers in my mind.
But it seems that there are so many of them like his movies.
The hell I will try to understand more.
Maybe I am still too young to understand this kind.
Sorry my french but how can a guy can be sexually stimulated looking at the body of that kind of a woman? Sorry I am an idiot!
Maybe that all are not even matter for him.
Maybe his mother is alike that lady.
Maybe he felt similar thing from that lady and he wanted that kind of mother like old feeling from her.

Then again the wife keep asking why why why that lady? If you want to have an affair why some style? You are ruining my dignity!

There is this one shot with wife came to the husband's office to check if he is having an affair with someone at the office and releieved seeing the secretary's face.
The shot is husband and wife together in one room and the secretary on the other which in in front of us mirror by the window so we see them all three in one shot. We clearly can compare the wife and the secretary's face together.

Why why why why why the husband is in an affair with the lady?
The classic music the beautiful music gracious songs uphive the enviornment and tries to support the love between the lady and the husband.
It work somehow and I am very sure some of you will love the relationship between them and even claip your hand towards them.
Yeah yeah yeah.
But the husband should have been stayed with his lovely wife.

At the end he kind of hesitate choosing the lady after his wife found out and about to leave for good and ends up with loosing them all.
What a bomber.

So what is this movie try to say?
He should have done something before loosing them both.

Alongside of issuing the beauty bla bla's love is all about choosing and timing.
He lost everything becaue he loose to choose one of them.
The wife said I did faked everything for entire life the sex orgasm the everything with your life. Maybe she said just because she was hurt by him maybe not.

The ugly -sorry- lady left because she though that she is replaceable.
He is the one who should be blamed.

7817775,2,6301960076,The only reason I bought this DVD is because it had Gerard Depardieu in it.  I love all his period pieces.  But this was just crazy with a crazy ending.  I was not pleased with this film.,1359936000,,187,4.0
7817776,5,6301960076,"I remember seeing this when it came out, and I still have my vhs copy from long ago. I don't understand how anyone could call this too pretentious. Too farcical or silly maybe. But lines like, 'I vomited on your rug,' 'Take my rug but leave my husband' are pure comedy. It's a mockery of the pretentious. (Is that over the head of the local audience?) I think it's a really lovely movie that impressively combines comedy and drama.",1232496000,,431,4.468354430379747
7817777,2,6301960076,"Depardieu plays a car salesman who falls in love with his ordinary-looking temporary secretary, despite being married to a gorgeous wife. The premise was promising but the result disappointing.
  In general I'm a lover of French cinema but it does have a tendency to get preachy and pseudo-intellectual -- and that's what happens in this movie. We get lines of dialogue like this:
Mistress: I've vomited on your rug.
Wife: Take the rug. Leave my husband.
  Sometimes the characters step out of character and deliver lines as if they were spectators or critics. Sometimes, they come together for absurd dinner parties and in one scene for a wedding at which they deliver ridiculous speeches in the manner of ""The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie."" But in general, this is a sloppy, pretentious movie of little charm or worth.",1217203200,,825,4.956521739130435
7817778,5,6301960076,"If you want to settle in for a light and entertaining breezy film about the complex intricasies of why and whom we love,then Bertrand Blier's TOO BEAUTIFUL FOR YOU is not your fare!!! Blier's mindblower is about as difficult  and surreal a treatise on attractions and why they occur and with what pain they can cause as this reviewer has ever seen! You will be richly rewarded as Blier's trip into the serendipitous world of unexplained attractions is explored and actualized through a totally brilliant and unconventional narrative (that must have been a real toughy for an actor to read on first glance!),clever scene changes that shift back and forth in time and place, characters who speak aloud their most secret inner thoughts (though not actually doing so!),unbelievably sensitive acting from the three principle actors,Josiane Balasko,Gerard Depardieu and Carole Bouquet,with all of this glued together by a geniously woven tapestry of the tragic/melancholic composer Franz Schubert's romantically  charged quartets,symphonies and choral works. (This is highly significant to the film's theme as Schubert was a man thwarted in love,sickly, whose music always bordered on the romantic of the unfulfilled and unfinished,who died in his mid-thirties. One of the most clever uses of his music is when his HOLY,HOLY,HOLY, a hymn to the Trinity somberly intones when all three principle players are meshed into this love/betrayal triangle showing that only God could get them out of this mess!)

On the surface,the film is simply about the seeming attraction of a highly successful car salesman (Depardieu),who is married to his most beautiful and desired- by- all wife (Bouquet)with lovely children and mansion-like house,to his rather dowdy and ""slob-like"" temp secretary (Balasko)who returns the like attraction to her employer. The narrative at this point becomes totally unconventional and the film becomes progressively intertwined between what is real, what is emotion spoken and unspoken, and what is real time vs.what is something that may or may not actually have happened. Actually, what Blier shows us is  the true craziness and paranoia/grandeur-like pomposity that overtakes  people when they allow themselves to act upon their impulses! If this sounds confusing,you are correct to a point! If you are not totally alert at every turn in this marvelous French wonder you may be tempted to throw up your hands and scream ""What!!??"".But Bertrand Blier is smart enough to keep the viewer from falling from their own sane seat! Blier's film is so clever that it actually defies convention. It does help to know a little about the music and life of Franz Schubert and his music to understand why Blier particularly chose this composer. If this had been a straightforward narrative such as the American films UNFAITHFUL or even FATAL ATTRACTION, you would simply have had another taught thriller with a tidy ending. Blier doesnot give you that at all. He forces you to think in great detail about how affairs/attractions occur, the unrealistic sense of ultimate bliss they will bring, and the tragic results to everyone's psyche that they leave behind when they don't work out. Some will dismiss this as French arthouse intellectualism .I prefer to consider the alternative; a filmmaker's brilliant artistry that challenges the viewer beyond what normally is done by 99% of his contemporaries.",1177977600,,3402,5.280961182994455
7817779,4,6301960076,"This film is definately charming, and is different from most of the main sream films.

A man, who has a beautiful wife and children, falls in love with his frumpy-dressing average-looking secretary. He makes love to her, cheating on his wife.

His wife becomes aware of this, but instead of leaving him, she tries to be the woman of his dreams, but cannot suceed. He discovers that a woman with no imperfections is not desirable, there is nothing more to want from her.

What happens in the end is for you to discover.",1128470400,,518,4.548387096774194

Only through the whole meaning of this deep thought you will be capable to understand why this apparently absurd and raising hair decision when you compare to Carole Bouquet one of the Goddess of the French Cinema and the humble secretary of this husband who would seem to find at last his authentic reason to live.

Perhaps Afrodite couldn't win the fight against the Mother Goddesss Earth: Gea. And this fact allows understand him since many of you may be disagree.

7817781,2,6301960076,"I like Gerard Depardieu, but this movie was not good. It seemed almost unrealistic. Gerard is not convincing in this role. It was clear there was no chemistry between he and Josiane Balasko (his secretary). Just not believable. Sorry.",1096070400,,234,5.0256410256410255
7817782,4,6301960076,"In this clever take on love and relationships, the affairs of three people are enigmatically
portrayed. Everyone adores Bernard's wife Florence. His friends lust for her, her friends envy her. She is very beautiful, and for Bernard there is nothing more left to desire. And that is precisely what troubles him: she may just be too beautiful. His secretary, a temp named Colette, is completely the opposite to Florence. But in her physical unattractiveness Bernard finds a refuge to his peculiar dilemma. Despite of what may seem as a logical explanation, he is not plagued by an inferiority complex. What drives Bernard is the psychological force of the middle-age crisis. Some people wonder whether what they have is as good as it gets. Bernard actually knows that. The second he is near Florence he knows that that is true; gazes of his friends reassure him in that.
With Colette, however, he feels completely at ease. There is no need for self-assertion and he is free to choose. Naturally, there is much more to this film, which is full of surprises and unexpected events. The only country where such a complex and somewhat surrealistic plot could have been brought to life, where careful avoidance of turning the film into a soap opera, a pointless comedy, or a tedious drama meets with the bittersweet taste of love and desire is France, and the philosophy of love, the satire, and the superb acting -- Depardieu, Bouquet, and Balasko make a lovely team -- are also typically French here. Ironically enough, the question of the age is inverted to ""what does a MAN want?""",999907200,,1576,4.840740740740741
