Very few later movies had as great influence on the country's underground culture as Chapayev.
Must see for everyone interested in Russian cinema, history and culture.

Unfortunately, soundtrack is terrible. English is overlaid on original Russian track, and as result, it's hard to understand in either language.
There is no way to turn any language off. No subtitles either.",1203206400,3,460,5.216216216216216
