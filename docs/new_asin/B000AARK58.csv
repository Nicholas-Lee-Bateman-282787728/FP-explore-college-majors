2383878,5,B000AARK58,Gave it away for a Christmas present.  I didn't see it.  Received it in plenty of time for a present.,1356998400,,101,4.0
2383879,4,B000AARK58,"This series was done a few years after WW II and does a good job
telling what went on in the Pacific of WW II.  If you are a WW II buff
and do not have this series, get it and you will enjoy it.  I got
this in the used category and it came like new.  Paid less than $5.00 for it.
I am very pleased with this purchase.",1342137600,10,317,3.5
2383880,5,B000AARK58,"I bought this for my father who watched it avidly.  It is real war footage.  Some of it was shown in theaters during the war to push war bonds or inform the public of political decisions and actions.  Some of it is too graphic and wasn't seen until much later.  My dad was a WWII vet and served in the pacific, it was important to him.  This held his interest during his illness, and he was pleased that I found it.  I would reccommend it to anyone with a true interest in the actual progress of the war, as there are a lot of details that have since been forgotten.",1341964800,17,566,4.1
2383881,5,B000AARK58,"I'm a huge World War II buff and I bought this on a whim having never seen the series before.  And I gotta say, I'm really glad that I did.  This is an incredibly in-depth series filled with rarely seen war film footage that really gives you a sense of what it was like.  This series is incredibly informative about the events preceding Pearl Harbor and the events following it.  This is a great series for any proud American and Historian.  I highly recommend it.",1334534400,56,464,4.411764705882353
2383882,3,B000AARK58,"Just a note for the collectors out there, that the opening credits of most of the episodes in this collection are incomplete.  I don't know if Diamond Entertainment did this themselves for some odd reason, or if it's all they had to work with, but it's worth a mention.

Normally, the credits start with the title CRUSADE IN THE PACIFIC, then fade to a shot of waves crashing, with the episode number superimposed.  For episodes #'s 3 through 22, however, the credits are only a paused image of the title CRUSADE. . .  then go directly to the episode itself.  Only the first and last couple episodes have the full credits.  Otherwise the image quality seems to be pretty good and the sound is fine.  The only other demerit is the completely inappropriate music used for the menu screens (Diamond tends to do this with their DVD releases).  It's some funky disco riff that sounds like it was taken from the ABC Movie of the Week credits.

Anyway, the price isn't bad, but there are other editions out there.",1210377600,36,1006,4.575418994413408

2383888,1,B000AARK58,"This product is displayed as a 5 disc set with the title ' World War II in the Pacific', while in actuality it has been cloaked, and is actuqally the 2 disc set 'Crusade in the Pacific, which I already have. So you have accepted my payment, and sent an item advertised as something it shall never be. Have you no decency? Why would you cloak the actual title? What a cheap trick!

2383889,2,B000AARK58,"What was advertised as a 5 disk set titled as World War II In The Pacific was not delivered as advertised. a barcode sticker attached to the back of the product stated that title.

I can only imagine the video compression and fuzzy images caused by compressing video.
this is a bogus offer and should be addressed as such.",1464393600,6,443,4.5375

2383894,5,B000AARK58,"1950s style format and narrative style, but it's well worth getting for the large amount of film and historical information, far more so than Victory at Sea, though the latter has better music and dramatic effects.",1438819200,,214,4.972222222222222

2383909,2,B000AARK58,"This is actually Crusade in the Pacific TV series from the 50s gaudily repackaged! An excellent series in its own right it covers many less-well recorded and with the luxury of 26 episodes uses a lot of less-familiar footage. The commentary, at times, tries for a poetic or sober tone and the lack of music may put some off, used as we are  to ""modern"" impactive"" documentary styles. If you don't have this series already it is well worth getting just don't expect colour sound etc etc",1412380800,17,485,4.574712643678161
2383910,3,B000AARK58,"Doesn't seem to be any different than the 2 disc version I already own which was bought at a discounter for $7. This would only be worthwhile if the picture quality is better due to a remastering, which does not seem to be the case. However if you don't own a previous version and are a WWII buff this is a very good, albeit U.S. biased, presentation of the Pacific theater events.",1411948800,5,381,4.305555555555555

Since I assist in teaching Washington State, U.S. and World History, any DVD at a reasonable price stands a chance to make its away into my collection.

I bought this set knowing the subject had already been covered this  year.  This will give me ample opportunity to go through each and ever disc and make notes.

Thus far I've watched only Disc 1, but I must say I'm impressed with the quality of the picture and material presented.",1389484800,15,571,4.5588235294117645

Excellent film footage  both from US archives and captured Japanese film. The casualty figures are staggering and make you realize the sacrifices made by our fathers and grandfathers to bring the war to an end. Includes bonus footage of the Korean War as well.

2383929,5,B000AARK58,The archive video in this set is excellent. I love the gun camera film. I bet it was a gas shooting up anchored Jap ships in a P38 or going in low over the home islands and strafing unopposed in a P51.,1373068800,,201,3.8095238095238093
