6891451,5,B00R041BAW,"This season was an awe-inspiring journey. From the despairing lows of the Kansas City game and the projected demise of Tom Brady, to the resounding turnaround against Cincinnati; to the unfortunate injuries to Stevan Ridley and Jerod Mayo in the Buffalo game; to the shellacking of the Denver Broncos; to the Jonas Gray game; to the dramatic face-off against the Packers; to the second-half explosion to clinch the division at the expense of Miami; to the improbable fourteen-point comebacks against Baltimore and the Edelman touchdown to Amendola; to the obliteration of the Indianapolis Colts; to the outrageous ball deflation scandal; to the polarizing, memorable press conferences delivered by Bill and Tom; to the bleak outlook with under thirty seconds remaining in SB XLIX; to the pure elation that surged through every member and fan of the New England Patriots after an unlikely hero in Malcolm Butler sealed a Super Bowl victory with an interception at the goal line, the 2014/2015 campaign is one to be cherished forever. I've never been more proud of this organization.

*EDIT: Regarding the product itself, it is essentially a recap of the entire Patriots season with the usual narration by Scott Graham. Because many Sound FX and Inside the NFL specials were dedicated to New England throughout the season, much of the footage will be familiar (but not completely identical to what we've already seen). Some will be disappointed by that; I personally don't mind. After watching the older Patriots Super Bowl DVDs, this production is very similar.
David Robidoux's NFL Films soundtracks are electrifying and dramatic, as always. Also, if anyone is curious, play-by-play commentary is indeed provided by the 98.5 The Sports Hub radio crew, Bob Socci and Scott Zolak.
The Extra Content is mostly lackluster, as it consists of a lot of interviews and Sounds of the Year. I'd say that the Gronkowski content is worth watching, however. Finally, there is no Super Bowl broadcast, but that has been the case for the last ten Super Bowl Champions DVDs. If you're interested in entire postseason games and fascinating exclusive content, you'll want the comprehensive 3 Games to Glory IV, which will be available this spring. It's currently listed for pre-order on the Patriots ProShop.
Overall, I'd definitely recommend this product, despite its faults.",1422835200,115,2358,5.188976377952756

6891515,3,B00R041BAW,"My first purchase of a Super bowl DVD - a disappointment.  I thought I was buying a DVD of the GAME - not a compilation of the Patriots' season.

I was one of the fans who gave up on them after the 1st half (so shoot me - who wants to watch their team flush itself down the toilet?)  Fortunately for me, I just put it on mute and got out a book.  When next I looked - sometime during the 3rd quarter - they were up a bunch of touchdowns.  I unmuted my TV and watched the most incredible comeback ever!

Wow, what a game!  But I wanted to see what I had missed.  What HAPPENED?  HOW did they turn it around?  I wanted to see the entire game again - even that depressing 1st half - and experience the amazement and wonder of watching the Pats jump in the toilet, then haul themselves out before it flushed (watching the Falcons go from a slam dunk to a crash and burn was a  fun bonus feature).

If you want a DVD of how the Pats got to the Super Bowl and a few Super bowl highlights, this is your DVD.  If you wanted to relive that amazing Super Bowl game you will be disappointed.  It's better than nothing, but not what I wanted or expected.",1493510400,,1142,3.995575221238938
6891516,5,B00R041BAW,As long as the Patriots won it was a great DVD,1493337600,,46,3.272727272727273
6891517,3,B00R041BAW,"New England fans will no doubt want to have this video as part of their collection which has an hour long recap of the Patriots 2014 regular season and postseason games, with extensive highlights of the Super Bowl XLIX win, 28-24, over the Seattle Seahawks.

Other than being a New England Patriots fan, I would rate the video to be about average.  While it does a decent job of providing a nice recap of the regular season, it could have done more to build the drama throughout the season.  While New England ultimately went 12-4, there was some real drama early in the season.

Despite blowing out a poor Minnesota Vikings team in Week 2, the Patriots looked very mediocre after four games.  They were humiliated in Week 4 by the Kansas City Chiefs and not only looked like a pedestrian team, they looked like a bad team.  The offensive line was a mess, Brady didn't look like Brady, and the entire team looked like it could be headed to has been status.  There was even talk in the media about Brady being benched.  Thats just how bad it was.

While this video plays up the fact New England looked pretty poor in that game and captured the theme were on to [choose team] mantra the coach and players adopted after the Kansas City game, it missed a lot too.  For example, it really should have included Belichick scoffing at a reporter when asking if the QB position would be evaluated implying Brady could be benched.  And it could have shown some of the commentary in the media about the Patriots being a bad team.  But it didnt.  And that would have made what came next even more powerful.  The Patriots righted the ship and went on to win all but two of their remaining games.  One was a close loss to Green Bay at Lambeau field and the final game against Buffalo where most of the starters rested.  And of course, they won the Super Bowl.

The video does a better job with the playoff wins against the Baltimore Ravens and Indianapolis Colts and of course the Super Bowl.  The Ravens game was particularly close with tricky formations and a trick play to secure the win after being down by 14 points twice.

The New England Patriots seem to always be in heart stopping Super Bowl matchups that leave viewers on the edge of their seats until the final gun sounds.  Super Bowl XLIX in which the New England Patriots defeated the Seattle Seahawks 28-24 is no exception.  Seattle was able to pull off a miraculous drive at the end of the game to almost win it, only to be thwarted at the goal line by an interception by the unheralded rookie cornerback Malcolm Butler.  The video is at its best covering this game and its magnitude for the legacy of Brady and the Patriots

Of course everyone will remember the season for the ridiculous Deflategate drama at the end of AFC Championship Game.  The video never mentions it, and as a Patriots fan I am not sure if this is a good thing or a bad thing.  It was definitely a part of the story leading into the Super Bowl and had to be a distraction for players and coaches so I feel the video should have somehow deftly handled it because it was part of the full story of the season.  That its completely missing seems odd.

The special features in this addition are nothing special or worth mentioning.  I wish they could have put together a better package for that as they have done in the past.

Overall, of course Patriots fans like me will love the DVD despite its drawbacks.",1492992000,,3427,4.4384

Instead I received a rapid review of the Patriots' 2014-15 season and a summary of the Super Bowl as the final segment. I think the NFL deceived me and others whose purchases were based on similar assumptions to mine.,1428105600,,291,4.509433962264151

6892242,1,B00R041BAW,Where's the Superbowl play by play?  And is the half time show on here?  I have the game on my DVR and that recording is far superior to this product!

The halftime show was terrific and should be on here too.,1427932800,,360,3.9859154929577465
6892243,3,B00R041BAW,"As a Patriots fan since 1976, I was thrilled that I was able to buy yet another Super Bowl championship DVD, but I found the final product disappointing, especially in comparison to the previous championship DVDs (especially for Super Bowls 38 and 39).  This DVD lacked the card inside the front cover of the DVD holder which listed all of the games and scores from the previous season.  Also, the narration of this video seemed to lack enthusiasm and energy and his voice didn't seem to capture the intensity of some of the games, in particular the Super Bowl.  This video also doesn't contain the entire Super Bowl in a condensed form as earlier DVDs have.  It's nice to be able to replay the game, especially given the great outcome for Pats fans.  Overall, I thought the coverage of the Super Bowl was also lacking.  It would have been appreciated by Patriot fans to see all eight (8) of Brady's completions on the game winning drive.  And why does the video pick up the game only in the 2nd quarter?  I know the Patriots had a drive end in an interception, but that drive showed that the Patriots could basically have their way on offense and it set the tone for much of the rest of the game.  This version clearly isn't as good as previous versions, but I will treasure it nonetheless because of the much coveted fourth Super Bowl title.

6892286,3,B00R041BAW,"I wish this were a richer video to report on. It was a really interesting season, filled with ups and downs. The playoffs were terrific, particularly the game against Baltimore and the Super Bowl, one of the greatest ever played.

But you wouldn't really know it from this video. You'd hardly know there had been any adversity during the regular season. And the Patriots playing poorly at any time and close to extinction? Not in this video. Remember when the Patriots fell behind by a couple of touchdowns due to sloppy play? The Patriots don't play sloppily in this video. Part of the drama of a game is when the team plays poorly, putting themselves in a bad position, but then turns it around not by just scoring more points, but making adjustments and playing better. In the video, we're merely told the Patriots fall behind by two touchdowns, and then are taken from there.

The storytelling is just not very compellingly told. The drama isn't built well.

Sure, NFL Films does its usual fantastic job of capturing the action, but if the adversity is not set up well, then the ultimate victory doesn't have the proper payoff, and that is what is really the problem here. Any in-game adversity is merely temporary, given a cursory mention. It's pretty much all happy-clappy.

Properly setting up and giving just time to the Seattle comeback and seeming victory, the feeling of negative destiny when Kearse makes that unlikely catch that had seemingly been properly defended away and made a Seattle win seem inevitable, is what made that New England victory so stunning. Yet the drama is hardly there.

There is so much to be disappointed about here. The extras are also weak. Mostly fluff. There is no complete Super Bowl game broadcast. Nothing very insightful about the game itself.

This video is really more for fans as a memento, as opposed to a video to help relive or revisit the drama of the season. Past Super Bowl videos have done better jobs than this one.",1427673600,9,1972,4.73469387755102

People who have their TV's set for the NFL Network and never change the channel - perhaps you have seen all of this footage and heard all of the sound before, (albeit without the soaring background musical soundtrack?). But if you're like me and basically watched all the games as they were broadcast week to week, and have not seen the NFL films field level video, sound, and also the sideline and post game locker room speeches by Belichick and his staff - plus enjoyed the enthusiasm of the players as the season progressed - then of course you will enjoy this DVD. Most of the play-by-play is by the understandably over the top ex-Pat Zolak and his 98.5 partner Bob. I'm writing this review only to reassure those Pats fans like me who might have wondered if this was not going to be entertaining. Don't worry. It is. And I haven't even watched the extras yet.

6892349,5,B00R041BAW,"The NFL has been making super bowl championship blu rays since the Steelers win after the 08-09.  I have them all.  I have to say that this one is the best of the bunch. It does follow the same formula of the others, but in small ways it collects perfectly the intangibles that made the Patriots 2014-15 season very special. In the beginning, it devotes a small portion of time in showing the teams budding greatness between 05-13.  But also the frustrations of playoff defeat and then nicely transitions to some training camp building.  Relatively quickly it gets into the season. Once thing that stood out early is that even that they lost to Miami, it shows some terrific defensive works against the Dolphins QB and paints a clear early picture of the teams budding athleticism and physicality on that side of the ball. Though it might be said that Bill is never a great interview, it does show how he thinks to a tee after the KC rough handling.  Were focused on Cincinnati (like 5 times in a row) to every question he is asked.  Try not to laugh at that, it was terrific.  All the key moments during the winning are there, the Ninkovich pick vs the Broncos, many big Gronk highlights to include the Bears and Colts explosions and the left hander vs the Broncos.  Gives fair treatment to the Packers game and has pretty even shots between the teams there.  One thing that stood out is the camera work for this blu ray really gets you very close to the action and the picture seems even crisper then in the previous NFL blu rays.  There are also some unique shots like one where you are watching from the opposite goal line on a Pats drive and get a full crowd shot on a touchdown while still seeing the action.  Pretty neat.  Another good move on this blu ray is it demonstrates well how close this team was and how as much as any champion I can remember every guy would try and run through a brick wall for the other.  For example, on an Edelman punt return we see Tom running all the way down the field to celebrate and what future hof QB will do that in his final years?  Cant think of ever seeing that before.  Also, throughout the presentation it is observed very well how the game is won or lost at the line of scrimmage at its root, and the proud emphasis the Pats place in this facet.  The playoffs work well, one thing that was neat was seeing the Pats thinking about the WR to WR pass strategically in the game.  Also well done was showing with detail some of the unique formations use and how TE #47 shined here through deft strategy.  The Indy game for the AFC championship is filled with terrific shots and demonstrates the weather perfectly, and also how the strategy shifted well to a run first focus with RB #29 bulling and twisting his way to solid gainers. Just to be clear, throughout the show, the defense gets pretty fair treatment, not exactly equal, but it shows up in a correct and relatively detailed throughout.  Maybe the NFL still kind of does care about defense (but I am not holding my breath). That non story related to footballs is NOT mentioned at all and that is a massive breath of fresh air.  The icing on the cake is the SB.  The shots throughout are the best I have seen from NFL films and I there is no way the emotion and physicality of the game could be captured better.  It also gives a showing that stirs the soul concerning the budding excellence of Malcom Butler, even before the game sealing pick.  Julian also goes into full hero mode in this game and you cant help but relate fully to his display vis a vis manly values of courage, strength, mastery, and honor in full force throughout.  This was truly the ultimate team and so greater than the sum of their overall parts.  As much anyway as that can be said at the NFL level.  Very nice parade shots to cap off the video.  Good and plentiful extras, also.  Not just for Pats fans but any fans of this game played the way it should be.",1426118400,5,3937,4.363511659807956

6892386,3,B00R041BAW,"As a longtime Patriots fan (just since the days of Jim Plunkett and Randy Vataha - I can hear some younger football fans saying to themselves, ""Jim Plunkett played for the Patriots?!"" while others are probably saying, ""Who's Jim Plunkett?""), I was thrilled with the Superbowl this year. A truly great game, whoever eventually won. And Brady's performance in the 4th quarter is simply, henceforth, THE benchmark for clutch QB play. So I looked forward to this compilation of the 2014 season. In many ways, it delivers, but for the serious fan, it simply is too superficial. The video and the audio are just what you would expect from an NFL Films BluRay - excellent. The main program is very straightforward, with a sequential review of the 16 regular season games, followed by the 3 post-season games, all told from a very Patriot-centric view. Unfortunately, the regular season  games are all just thumbnails with limited highlights (just a key play or two) without fully exploring the context of the games, or the back and forth of the games. And the playoff games, though presented in greater detail, still leave me wanting. The Superbowl highlights showed a single Seahawk score, the TD at the end of the first half, but not the drive that got them downfield in 30 seconds. Nor did it show the key pick in the 3rd quarter that got the Seahwaks the 10-point lead. So it leaves out so much (not a single direct mention of Deflategate), that it leaves me wanting more, a lot more. The main program is 77 minutes long, and twice that might have started to do justice to the subject. I don't mean to be all negative. There are some great things in this DVD - some of the scenes, showing Belichick on the sidelines in the 4th quarter of the Superbowl, coaching his players are priceless. There are a dozen or so short special features, most in 3 minute range, except for the presentation of the Lombardi trophy, which is about 11 minutes. All of some interest. So as a fan, I still recommend this disc, but it could be so much more, giving us more detail about the individual games, and the ebb and flow of a long season. And how about some stats? How much space would it take to include the full roster, game books from each game, season stats for the team. I'm sure there are plenty of other ideas about interesting things that could be included. So, NFL Films, get on the stick, so that next year, when the Patriots win again (wink, wink), you'll have all this straightened out.",1425772800,,2479,4.583333333333333

6892390,5,B00R041BAW,"Super Bowl 49 Champions:  History Recaptured
In a historic season, the New England Patriots captured the coveted Super Bowl with a 28-24 victory over the Seattle Seahawks on Feb. 1.
With the game on the line, the Seahawks were barking on the door at the one yard line with under a minute left in the game.  What could have been the most exciting Super Bowl of all time, became the most talked about Super Bowl of the decade with an interception by rookie Malcolm Butler to clinch the Patriots fourth championship ending a 13-year drought.
The quest for the Super Bowl title began in training camp, and NFL Films follows the Patriots through their 14-3 season with sparkling highlights and behind the scenes footage.  Fans can follow quarterback Tom Brady as he leads his team to athletic glory while winning the game MVP nod for a two TD run to capture the win.
 Special features on the DVD include season highlights (in the main feature), Super Bowl media day, post-game ceremonies, interviews with Tom Brady and Rob Gronkowski, and two features on Bill Pelichick and the Belichick/Carroll connection.
Football champions are no accident, and the Patriots had to fight back from controversy to win the League Title convincingly.

6892394,4,B00R041BAW,"I am, of course, a huge Patriots fan, so that's why I ordered this to arrive the day it came out. The content of the video is really good. It is basically a bunch of slow-motion clips from the majority of the regular season and all of the playoff games. Sprinkled throughout are parabolic microphone clips that NFL films has become known for over the years. If you've followed the team closely, though, hardly any of these will be new. What is fun to see is the virtually anonymous Malcolm Butler standing behind Belichick in a couple of post-game locker room speeches.

I bought the Blu Ray DVD because I wanted to preserve the format for years to come and have it on high definition. But the coding on the Blu Ray did not work with my PC-based Blu Ray player. The computer would recognize the disk, but it failed to play the disc even after I updated the drivers. As such, I could either pay for a new Blu Ray software program for my computer, buy an actual Blu Ray player for my TV (which I don't have), or just buy this video from iTunes (which is what I did) for about half the price (still in HD) and watch it on my computer with no problems.

6892416,5,B00R041BAW,"I've been eagerly awaiting the release of ""New England Patriots: Super Bowl XLIX Champions"" almost from the moment Super Bowl XLIX ended with a Patriots victory on February 1, 2015. I pre-ordered a Blu-ray copy of this program from Amazon on the day its release date was first announced.

I received my copy of ""New England Patriots: Super Bowl XLIX Champions"" yesterday, and I must say I was very pleased with it. This is an absolutely outstanding product, and a perfect summary of the New England Patriots' 2014 championship season. The format of my Blu-ray version of ""New England Patriots: Super Bowl XLIX Champions"" is similar to the Super Bowl XXXVIII and XXXIX discs, which I own on DVD. It contains a brilliantly produced NFL Films summary of the entire Patriots 2014 season, from the opening of training camp in July 2014 to the presentation of the Vince Lombardi Trophy to Patriots owner Robert Kraft in February 2015.

Using its patented, brilliantly conceived combination of regular speed and slow-motion photography, excellent music, and the mellifluous voice of narrator Scott Graham, the film quickly grabbed my attention and held me spellbound for its entire 75-minute running time. One notable improvement over previous films: this one has a lot more in the way of ""miked-up"" players and coaches. I found myself having a much greater understanding of what gets said on the field and on the sidelines during NFL games.

""New England Patriots: Super Bowl XLIX Champions"" contains a wealth of special features that I found especially entertaining. Viewers will find everything from short interviews with Tom Brady, Bill Belichick, Rob Gronkowski, and others to a series of NFL Films SoundFX, which show in-game actions and reactions from players across the league.

The main program and all special features of the Blu-ray version of ""New England Patriots: Super Bowl XLIX Champions"" are in high definition video that is crisp, clean, shows no artifacts, and has perfectly balanced color. The disc also employs DTS-HD Master Audio, which brought a totally immersive sound into my viewing area.

""New England Patriots: Super Bowl XLIX Champions"" is an outstanding addition to the long and illustrious series of NFL films that commemorate team championships. It's a must-own for all New England Patriots fans.",1425513600,6,2321,5.162234042553192

6892419,3,B00R041BAW,"Once again, this DVD does not focus on the actual play by play of the Super Bowl. This series  focuses on the journey to the superbowl with video abstracts of the games--this series' primal focus. At one point, however, it did include the actual SB as an extra content bonus. But it has never been its main focus. Now if you wish to have the actual SB, the 3 Games to Glory Series includes the actual 4th quarter televised broadcast, only.

As far as the main content of the film is concerned, well it's mediocre. Not because it fails to do what this series does best at presenting, but because it fails to execute it properly where it matters the most i.e., the Super Bowl. When watching the last segment of the series, it clearly  fails to build any worthwhile suspense to what is arguably the best play in SB history--Malcolm Butler's interception. The antagonizing factor of drama that was SB49 is just not there. So much so that I would argue that Inside the NFL's version of the SB is x-fold better.

Nonetheless, where it does excel at least is in regards to the Seahawks final play. Contrary to popular belief, though, the Seahawks' final play  was not the ""dumbest"" in NFL history like Jimmy Collinsworth and the rest would have you believe. Instead, it's that Butler's interception is epitome of what the Patriots Organization is--An Organization dedicated to Doing Their Job! And that right there is what this presentation gets right.",1425427200,6,1445,4.695652173913044

6892456,3,B00R041BAW,"Thrilled with the win but the highlight portion of the games was rushed and poorly put together. The highlights portion of each regular season game is particularly bad. Just a mish mash of poorly put together clips that did not give you a feel for each game. Not much better for the playoffs and Super Bowl, The extras are awful. What happened to NFL Films? I don't know why I give this 3 stars other than the Pats win because this disc is a fail. BTW, the Amazon page lists this with a 180 minute run time. The Blu Ray package shows 140 minutes. I'm looking forward to Three Games to Glory 3 disc set out later in the spring with the entire playoff games and Super Bowl as broadcast by the networks.",1425427200,10,700,4.2706766917293235
6892457,3,B00R041BAW,"Let me start off my review by saying neither am I a Patriot hater or bandwagon. I've been a Patriots fan since I started watching football in 2006. The year before that I would play the NFL video games to learn the concept of how football works. I would always choose the patriots because they would have the highest team rank in the games, plus I thought they had the best looking logo in the games. 9 years later I'm pretty much caught up, I know everything there is to know about the pats. To the Raider that paralyzed Stingely and the whooping the Pats took from the 85 Bears in super bowl 20. *NOW ON TO REVIEW* (Belichick Voice)

By no means was I expecting any 3 hour football game from anytime this season on the DVD, But I was expecting was an ""NFL Network Presents: Americas Game."" or ""NBA Championship  DVD"" type of presentation where they take 3 (or more) people from the championship team and have them do confessionals while clips of games played from that season are shown on the screen while, The player or personnel breaks down their thought process on a specific situation or play. Instead the DVD contains a compilation of like 2 plays per football games that season with cheesy narration and if your someone who your teams video section on their official website frequently than you already seen everything on these super bowl DVDs. And bonus extra features are like 1 min forgettable clips. I know NFL releases ""The Road To The Superbowl"" DVD for the winning team mid year, every year.. Which is suppose to be Set of full length playoff games that the champs were in that year, but those DVDs fail to display what the team has been through to even make the playoffs that year. which can be forgotten if you choose to watch those DVDs years later, but that is the good part about this DVD because at least the narrator tries too but it doesn't work because you need clips from ESPN and other sports talk shows in this DVD Clips when certain Analyst were writing the team off after playing badly over a stretch of a few games. NFL shop is selling this for 35 bucks, its not worth that thats why i saved money by buying it here.. My real score is 3.5 but I rounded down.",1425340800,,2188,4.413366336633663
6892458,4,B00R041BAW,"I must admit, I'm slightly disappointed with this as I was under the impression it would include the entire Superbowl game. Instead, its a documentary recapping the entire season. A tremendous job by NFL films as always but just not what I really wanted - to relive the whole game.",1425340800,3,281,4.64
6892459,2,B00R041BAW,Very disappointing.  It's 2 hours with only 20 minutes spent on the Super Bowl.,1425340800,8,79,4.642857142857143
6892460,2,B00R041BAW,"Updated review after I received a working blu-ray in place of a defective disc...
I watched every highlight show I could get my hands on after the Superbowl and rewatched the 4th quarter probably 100 times...I was excited to get the Blu Ray to relive the whole season and the playoffs, but overall I was sadly disappointed.  The version of the Superbowl here is lacking.  There is no Seahawk perspective, none of their preening, and surprisingly no mention at all of Deflategate.  I am a big Pats fan but really couldn't believe all of this was left out. I enjoy seeing the other team celebrate during the game and make fools of themselves when I know the eventual outcome was a Pats win.  There should have been shots of Sherman doing his ""24"" bit and more ""sounds of the game"" from the Seahawks sideline.  Plus there were lots of fantastic sound bites on other NFL Network shows in the weeks following the game that were apparently left on the cutting room floor here.  Where was the shot of Belichick telling Brady that there was no way the Seahawks D could put together three good plays in a row?  That they were being undisciplined and careless and all Brady needed to do was avoid negative plays?  That was brilliant stuff and is not in this version. So while the synopsis is fine I was really hoping for more.  Looks like I will have to wait for Three Games to Glory.

Disc didn't work.  I am a huge Pats fan and I ordered this blu-ray the day pre order became available.  I have watched the 4th quarter of the Super Bowl maybe 15 times via dvr in the past month and was eagerly anticipating this synopsis of the Patriots season and championship.  I got it today, popped it into my Sony blu-ray player and...nothing.  It's a dud.  Amazon is handling the return and replacement admirably but I am still very disappointed.  Never had a DVD or blu-ray fail to work before.  Guess they rushed production or something.  Maybe I will reassess after I get a disc that works but for now gotta go with one star.",1425340800,4,2009,4.472527472527473
6892461,1,B00R041BAW,"This is just a DVD with highlights that you can watch anywhere, any time online. Not one full game, no scores, times or downs shown, just the NFL taking your money for something you can get for free.",1425340800,14,199,4.2631578947368425
6892462,5,B00R041BAW,"One of the GREATEST.SUPER BOWLS.EVER. I'm sure I would not feel that way if the outcome were different.  How am I sure?  Two previous Giants wins which were almost eerily repeated - both of which left me devastated because I am a Patriots fan and a HUGE Brady/Belichick fan. However, no matter what your team affiliation (unless you're as die-hard Seahawks fan as I am Patriot fan), I defy you to name me more than 3 or 4 greater games in SB history from a purely GAME perspective.  The back and forth - the comeback in the second half - the UNBELIEVABLE last two minutes.  The Patriots came back improbably in their game against the Baltimore Ravens - TWICE.  And now there is a fourth Lombardi trophy for Robert Kraft and his team. I could watch this fifty times (easily!) and never tire of it because I know it will contain all the highlights of my team winning. If you are a Seahawks fan or just an anti-Brady/Belichick fan (of which there are many), I get it - click on the button that says this review is Not Helpful.

6892475,5,B00R041BAW,"""This season will forever be tarnished because of football pressure."" Give me a break!  Only an ignorant, arrogant individual would write such a thing.  Here you have an incredible franchise that just accomplished an amazing feat with a Hall of Fame Coach and Quarterback and all you can do is focus on football pressure that supposedly was tampered with during one game.  Words just escape me.  Anyone that knows football understands how difficult it is to win the Super Bowl, let alone have a winning season.  This ball pressure nonsense will be cleared up soon and anyway, who really cares.  The comeback that New England made against the Seattle Sea Hawks and the final interception that took place to seal the deal will forever go down as one of the greatest Super Bowl Victories ever.  But wait a minute.....the Patriots must have cheated in the Super  Bowl to Win.  Perhaps they wore illegal helmets or prepared too much.  In any case, let's give credit where credit is due.
