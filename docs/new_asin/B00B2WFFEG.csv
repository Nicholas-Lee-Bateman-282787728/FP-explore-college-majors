5553806,4,B00B2WFFEG,"A lovely little film--Bob's New Suit is highly literate, inquisitive, compassionate, delving into an utterly modern world of family dynamics and identity politics, yet abounding with universal themes of love and redemption. It's also a lot of damn fun. I could not recommend it more highly.",1373328000,3,290,5.326086956521739
5553807,4,B00B2WFFEG,"I do not believe in a star system for rating films or books. However Amazon won't let me post a review without stars.  I gave the movie four stars because 5 stars is reserved, in my mind for well, ""The Earrings of Madame D.""  Having said that I think that Bob's New Suit is a movie very worth watching.  It is about love, family, acceptance, forgiveness, death, LBGT issues and much more. It is about big stuff and it is refreshingly unironic and open hearted.  Look for a marvelous turn by Bookworm's Michael Silverblatt as, well, I guess, Michael Silverblatt in a movie.  He is awfully good.  My favorite scene in the film is a conversation between Silverblatt and a young woman transitioning to becoming a man.  He has given her Orlando  to read and their discussion of it is priceless.

5553808,5,B00B2WFFEG,"Bob's new suit is a beautiful film by Alan Howard. The story is brave, the performances are strong and the care Mr. Howard has taken to make a true independent film is inspiring! It is such a treat to see that there are still wonderful filmmakers that create a world that is not only truthful but entertaining.",1370217600,3,310,4.456140350877193
5553809,4,B00B2WFFEG,This movie does an excellent job of depicting real life in a funny and thought provoking way. Watch carefully for the hidden humor and the hidden messages they might just be what you need. Must Watch,1369958400,,199,4.555555555555555
5553810,4,B00B2WFFEG,"This lovely movie is a throwback to the days when small independent films were made by filmmakers who told stories about people and relationships, rather than superheroes, CGE and explosions.  The people are real, their dilemmas are all too human, and their lives intersect in odd and delightful ways that recall La Ronde or Jacques Demy.  A warm and compassionate view of people and life all too missing in films today.",1369699200,2,420,4.901408450704225
5553811,5,B00B2WFFEG,"A totally charming story with a large cast of characters, many of them touching in their own way. (One or two scenes brought tears to my eyes.)  Makes you root for a happy ending which it gracefully delivers.  Highly recommend.",1369699200,,227,4.65
5553812,5,B00B2WFFEG,"I bought this DVD and was very pleased with the writing, directing, acting, and the subject material that it addressed.  We are living in a Brave New World, and these topics need to be addressed, and I am referring to the transgender issue that was handled so beautifully in this film.  Kudos to the writer, Alan Howard, for doing so in the manner that he did.  I was very impressed.  The storyline flowed easily and was totally believable and the acting was superb!  I would highly recommend this film!",1367712000,4,503,4.606741573033708
5553813,3,B00B2WFFEG,The premise of this movie that the suit will do the narration and commentary sounds more promising that what is delivered.  It is a not too original story about family dynamics except for the transgender-to-be daughter. It was entertaining but not riveting.,1366588800,5,257,5.119047619047619
5553814,1,B00B2WFFEG,Not my cup of tea,1485388800,,17,2.6
5553815,1,B00B2WFFEG,"One of the most meaningless movies I have sat through.  Seriously, better take a nap or go for a walk.  There are a lot of characters and story lines but none fully develop.  The movie wraps up somewhat abruptly with a very happy ending for all.",1485388800,,245,4.282608695652174

5553817,3,B00B2WFFEG,"A ""nice little movie.""  Uneven at times in the ability of the actors and the staging of the scene.  The role of the Bob's mother is particularly well acted. Not great, but pleasant enough to watch.  The end seems contrived.",1484697600,,223,4.525
5553818,5,B00B2WFFEG,"""Bob's New Suit"" is a hidden gem. It's the sort of uplifting movie I've been longing for. It's got a little bit of everything: family dynamics, love stories, a teeny bit of crime, and a little gender bending...and a surprise ending.",1484438400,,232,4.682926829268292
5553819,3,B00B2WFFEG,"An ok film,  just that!!",1484265600,,24,3.8
5553820,5,B00B2WFFEG,"I loved this film.  It requires some patience and it is quiet and very personal.  For me, the different strands in each character's life came together in a very workmanlike and realistic fashion, the acting was wonderful, and the plot was consistent with the vicissitudes of life, when it thrown you a curveball or two.  I do want to say that I am idealistic, prone to being romantic, and I tend to root for the underdog.  So if you share some of these characteristics and like to ponder what motivates some people and how they navigate the challenges they face, I would recommend ""Bob's New Suit"" with few reservations.",1483315200,3,620,4.660550458715596

5553822,5,B00B2WFFEG,"Howard has woven a remarkably taught and complex narrative tapestry that examines how unfair life can be for certain members of society.  But hope prevails in this heartfelt tale, but not without certain characters paying a hefty price, which is usually the case in life.",1481155200,,271,5.022222222222222

5553826,5,B00B2WFFEG,"This was probably one of the best movies I've seen in recent times!  I would definitely recommend that you watch it if you want to see a positive, happy movie!  I have no idea why Candy Clark is listed as the star - her part is very small.  The main actors are mostly unknowns, but they are very good!  Please watch it - you won't be disappointed!",1475539200,5,347,4.134328358208955
5553827,4,B00B2WFFEG,"This movie avoids a formulaic script, uses real people, and has real-life dialog. It is entertaining and smart. For those who frequently quit stupid movies after 10 minutes, this one will be worth watching.",1475452800,5,206,5.088235294117647

5553843,5,B00B2WFFEG,"I graduated HS in 1964, college in 1968, and spent 1969-1972 as a USAF officer (avoiding the draft), so you might see how easily I relate to this movie.

I'm thankful to all the people who created this movie. I especially enjoyed seeing Jack Larson's cameo in his last film role.

I watch a lot of movies covering 8 decades. For me, so many recent movies are victim / victimizer flicks with personal gratification and revenge displacing empathy and compassion. This movie invokes personal responsibility for being a good person to yourself and others.

Oh, the opportunities abound for victimization in this film, yet everyone comes out okay. Wonderfully!!!

I recommend this movie to all feeling people who like multiple happy endings.

5553845,1,B00B2WFFEG,"Terrible movie. It starts out like it's going to be humorous and light hearted, but the whole agenda is about a lesbian who starts cross dressing. I don't have anything about trannies, but if the whole movie is about a tranny then it should be clear from the start.",1447891200,,265,4.428571428571429

5553851,1,B00B2WFFEG,Just did not like the way the movie was structured (talking suit).  The story line about the sister was outdated and made the movie seem like it was much older than it is.,1444176000,,171,4.181818181818182

8561814,1,B00B2WFFEG,"I couldn't get past the irritating narration by the suit, speaking in the worst fake-Italian accent I've ever heard.

A varied cast of actors unknown to me, to the point that I thought they were locals, in their first roles.  Not so.  Their acting is so natural with such integrity.  The  story is actually fairly simple though the back stories of the main characters are quite interesting.  It could have been a much longer film.  Definitely worth watching.",1487980800,2,430,4.64
