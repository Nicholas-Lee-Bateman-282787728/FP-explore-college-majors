The title of the series refers to the ancient mythos of Charon the ferryman to Hades.

Another great production from the late M J Bird; dealing with Crete and in this case a central character, Alan Haldane, returns to the island decades after WW2. Only to find out that his former girlfriend has passed away, but that he has a daughter. He decides to stay. While the main theme deals with him and his experiences, there are episodes with a sub narrative of their own, however, the shadows from his past catch up with him and threaten his present contentment. The Filming was done on location in Crete for a good part of the filming. The series also had a very memorable theme tune.

The transfer to DVD is not bad, and I consider quite good. There is some 'bleaching' but there rarely nothing to spoil its entertainment value.

Unless I am wrong, there are two versions of this series out on DVD, one Dutch and other from Eureka. I personally think the Dutch version is the better of the two in terms quality of picture, otherwise the series on both are one in in the same.

The price paid was more than reasonable. This is well worth investing your time and money - real TV Classic, unlike some of the poor programming we get on TV today. Enjoy!
