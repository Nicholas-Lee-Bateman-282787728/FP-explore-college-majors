3088033,5,B0012EF7N8,The production is great. Beautiful music and costumes. The costumes have great detail and there is some great Korean dancers which were a surprise and fit well into the story.,1364601600,2,175,4.866666666666666
3088034,4,B0012EF7N8,I have watched this tape finding it is well sang & well played. i do have another one quite different the way they played which is well sang but it is in VHS. I am glad I got this DVD as the music is so beautiful & I play it to amuse me specially when I am down.,1360454400,2,262,3.5344827586206895
3088035,5,B0012EF7N8,"This is an great, beautiful Operetta, amusingly funny and the music, only Johann Strauss could have composed.
I am so glad that this particular DVD shows all actors and singers in the clothes worn during that time. Sometimes
in these new era, costumes are not fitting when a story took place that long ago.
If one loves Operettas and Musicals, that is thee one.

3088036,4,B0012EF7N8,"While this operetta is very light on plot it is enjoyable and humorous.  What really makes this a treat is the music and the singing.  It is exceptional.  I find myself humming and mentally singing the songs days after watching it.  It doesn't compare with Die Fledermaus but what a relaxing, enjoyable evening it provides!",1315008000,8,323,4.818181818181818
3088037,5,B0012EF7N8,"This DVD would deserve 6 stars!  The glamour and waltzing of Imperial Vienna is captured perfectly.  Deutsche Grammophon catches the true essence of Vienna.  This was filmed like a movie on location in Vienna and sound was recorded in Munich, a superb job with both.  Outstanding performers, great choreography, fabulous sets and costumes add to the enjoyment of this performance.  Deutsche Grammophon translates the Wiener Blut title as Viennese Spirit which is perfect.  Bravo!",1303776000,14,479,5.405405405405405
3088038,5,B0012EF7N8,"This is one of a series of movies of Viennese operettas which Unitel produced in the early 1970s and which DG released on DVD. They were filmed with very good sets and scenery (frequently on location) using young opera stars of the period. Singing, acting, and staging are excellent. If you like viennese operettas, you will enjoy these.",1264464000,21,337,4.827586206896552
3088039,5,B0012EF7N8,If you like operetta (or if you haven't tried it) buy this beautifully photographed work.  The color is brilliant and the costumes are authentic to the period.  A young Rene Kollo in in top form.  All the singing here is excellent and the acting and dialogue (in German with subtitles) is first rate. It was a joy to watch and I highly recommend the DVD.  Thanks to DG for bringing these treasured performances to the DVD medium.,1217721600,48,429,4.532467532467533

8245647,5,B0012EF7N8,Perfect. Gave a wonderful view of Old Vienna. Great singing by all the cast. The last Operetta that Strauss ever signed contract for a work of his arranged music. He did help with some picking of the music used. But the Operetta was arranged by another. He did such a good job that it sounds like a Strauss original. Please buy this DVD and you will not be sorry.,1470700800,3,363,4.27536231884058
8245648,5,B0012EF7N8,"great music sure to be enjoyable, as well as the acting, but buy it for the music alone and you'll be thrilled.",1440979200,,111,4.090909090909091

8245650,2,B0012EF7N8,I was very disappointed by this. It is silly beyond words. Acting is also poor even for an operetta. Advise not to waste money on it.,1432857600,,133,4.153846153846154
8245651,5,B0012EF7N8,Great version.  HArd to find other than through Amazon.,1421539200,,55,5.111111111111111
8245652,4,B0012EF7N8,"Not bad if you can get it at a good price.  Boy chasing after girl, mistaken identity all ending happily. If you like this kind of fluff then you will like this disc. The video is good not real hi def, the sound is quite good. Real Wiener Schmaltz. I am glad to have it.",1421107200,2,270,3.909090909090909
8245653,5,B0012EF7N8,"Now who DOESN'T like Johann Strauss Jr.????
I have to say that after viewing this DVD, i could NOT get ""Wiener Blut"" (the walltz) out of my head for an entire WEEK!
If that is not excellence, what IS????
It is wonderful that this has come to a ""DVD Near You--""buy it!!",1392422400,3,268,4.173076923076923
8245654,4,B0012EF7N8,"Evaluation of Weiner Blut.  I love that greatest coloratura that ever was, Ingeborg Hallstein.  (used to think that was Roberta Peters, but Hallstein is at least as good.  But she does too little singing in this performance for me!",1386288000,,231,4.871794871794871
8245655,3,B0012EF7N8,"The plot is too light for my taste (even within the operetta's standards) but both the music and the scenography are enjoyable.
If a person in interested in exploring the european operetta world I would suggest him/her to try instead the works of Franz Lehar.",1372291200,,259,4.777777777777778
