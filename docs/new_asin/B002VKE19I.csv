8382159,4,B002VKE19I,"Any zero-tolerance, active -- instead of reactive -- approach to anything always precipitates negative comments (see ** and below).  What is gratuitously forgotten is the subjects are dogs, whose unavoidable hierarchy is determined by aggression and violence, oh so totally different than those of us human beings that live indoors.  We've placed an animal who is comfortable in the wild in our so-called ""civilized"" environment of the city.  As descendents of wolves, dogs are exceptionally clever and conspiratorial.  Without sufficient discipline or replacement activities that are stimulating to the pooches, canine behavior will dominate even the tallest human beings' lives.  Brad wisely notes that human interaction directly affects [bad] dog behavior.
When visiting friends' houses, being jumped-up on and licked, or growled at, or leaving with clothing full of fur, or, worst case, smelling of wet dog is disgusting and unacceptable.  If I had human friends that acted this way or caused these events, I'd run away, so why should I put up with it in pet friends?
Brad's point that the human beings are the alpha dogs is spot on. We must act in a manner the dog understands so that our pets will resume submissive behavior.  Note I said ""what the dog understands"" and not ""what we understand.""  ""Treats,"" for example, do not work on the most aggressive dogs, because they demand access to all your subservient dogs' possessions.  To the alpha dog, all food is expected -- not a treat.
Surprisingly, even I've been successful using Brad's methods on friends' dogs based on these ideas.
The only reason I gave these shows four instead of five stars is TV editing in general.  It's possible to favor the best outcome with editing.  My favorite example is the national lottery shows.  Yah, they claim to be live, but what's to stop them from digitally (i.e.perfectly) pre-recording, making sure the numbers weren't chosen by too many people, and then starting over if so?  It's the same complaint with 1/2 hour sit-coms, where problems are presented initially and are completely solved after 29 minutes -- just in time for the credits to roll.
A comment was made about Brad's lack of credentials.  One comment I'd make is I'd LOVE for my car mechanic to have 15 years' experience.  He's fixing problems.  So is Brad.  Another point needs to be made: he may or may not have any formal preparation (degrees, books, etc.), but then neither do you. I've never seen a BS in dog training or a PhD in dog psychology, and I'd probably avoid the institution that offers them.  My vet admits she never had such training except for the purposes of evaluating whether or not to put down an overly aggressive animal.",1429833600,2,2707,4.938189845474613
8382160,4,B002VKE19I,"I have been watching these shows for a few weeks..although they are on TV at 3am in the morning and labeled as ""programming"" so until I caught it one day I had no idea about this show. I guess unlike the comments here I enjoy the show. My dog of 14 years passed away 7 mos. ago.  I guess I did not find his methods ""abusive"". He was a ""disciplinarian"" to be sure and he would not have approved of how we brought up our dog which we treated more like a family human member than a dog, but she was a lab and a very special one at that.  I assume some of his approach was for TV audience interest and I don't know how he was in between shows or ""off stage,""  but I did feel some of his tips and advice made a lot of sense. I think my pet days are coming to an end, but who knows? I enjoy watching the show since I am a ""nightbird"" my nature. I never see the show advertised and those who have young dogs and families probably have no idea that is it even on the air.",1421020800,,963,3.829145728643216

Comparatively Cesar's video, presentation, direction, and style is very unique, that nothing comes close to it.
I have just watched this once.",1300060800,5,219,5.111111111111111

The punishment based techniques Pattison uses often create more problems than they solve, including increasing aggression in the dog. Look for other trainers who focus on positive reinforcement techniques, such as Karen Pryor, Trish King, Patricia McConnell, etc.",1299024000,3,316,5.74468085106383
