7030031,4,B00U7DLUNQ,"Overall, this is a very nice documentary. I'm not the kind of person that even likes to wear a watch, but I can certainly appreciate those that delve into such a grand and mechanical art as watchmaking. It's absolutely flooring to learn of the time and dedication that these two extraordinary men have invested into a nearly abandoned and forgotten art-form. You'll be awakened to an appreciation of time itself as you let the wonder of this film take hold of you. And while it can move a bit slow within the moments that bear no voice, you can be thankful that it's only an hour long. This was made for deeper and more technical thinkers, as there is a certain romantic sense that only true watch lovers can get here, yet it's not so overwhelming that some others can't enjoy it, so as long as their personality can find some component to appreciate (if you like most good documentaries, you'll not find this completely boring).",1503532800,,929,4.602409638554217

7030033,3,B00U7DLUNQ,"1) This will not play in an older  DVD player but it did play on my computer.

2)  This video is way, way too long with interminable artsy shots and very repetitious.

3) daniels was clearly near death was this was recorded and I was uncomfortable with a lot of his commentary

4) If you are a  Daniels fan, and I am, it is are redeemed by the shots of watches and tools just wish there was more.

5) Too much video of very rich, smug, collectors",1480291200,,446,4.057471264367816
8704592,1,B00U7DLUNQ,Bad music and horrible monologues.  This was super cringe worthy at points.,1533859200,,75,5.25
8704593,5,B00U7DLUNQ,"A continuation of 'Longtitude' and the great John Harrison.  Incredible mechanics, parts so tiny it is hard to believe these time pieces were made by human hands",1529625600,,161,4.962962962962963
8704594,3,B00U7DLUNQ,"Good, but the background music throughout much of the documentary was a total mismatch and a distraction. There should have been better editing for quality - but it just really messed things up especially during narration and when some of the people are talking on film. Very loud and disturbing to an otherwise interesting subject.",1528848000,,332,5.054545454545455

8704596,5,B00U7DLUNQ,"I read recently where someone said that his greatest fear in life was to think on his deathbed that he had been mediocre.

This is a wonderful film, and with which the best artists and perfectionists, at whatever it is they do, will quickly identify and say ""yes.""  This film will inspire you who aspire to perfection in whatever skill or talent you do or create. It shows the unstoppable, unflagging drive that it takes to not just be the best. But to be the best of the best. If you are one who perseveres as far as you can possibly go with something in life, this will give you motivation to stay dedicated and to keep going after seeing these two extraordinary role models in their precision craft of extreme precision and detail. The miniaturization they create with their hands and eyes seems near impossible to me, and was what drew me to this film initially. I am still in awe of them.",1523577600,,893,4.439024390243903

I learned a lot about the amazing craft and art of it all. Haven't seen many, if any, good docs on this subject. Quite unique. Well worth a watch!",1515456000,,266,5.068181818181818
