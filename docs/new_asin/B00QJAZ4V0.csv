6872404,1,B00QJAZ4V0,Was not able to view it as it wouldn't download correctly. Our internet was working fine. Very disappointed that Amazon keeps trying to push me to phone or chat support. Just refund my fee.,1427241600,,189,4.588235294117647
6872405,3,B00QJAZ4V0,"I have been studying Phase 4 Films' animation carefully and was looking forward to this one as it is being pawned off as an original CG animated feature but unfortunately, it is anything but.  It turns out this is in fact a 2010 release called Pet Pals (or as it is sometimes known Pet Pals: Marco's Polo Code).

It got a US DVD release a couple of times before and in fact can be rented from the Redbox right now under the title Monkey Business (which is especially odd considering the minor role the primates play in the plot).  In any event, I am disappointed suffice to say and will be withdrawing my preorder for this film.

Just wanted to come on and review the piece so that others may not fall victim to the same marketing scheme.  Either of the other names Eggy has been released under prior can be purchased (or rented) right now and for far less money.  Shame on Phase 4 for trying to pull a fast one.",1420675200,12,912,4.273255813953488
