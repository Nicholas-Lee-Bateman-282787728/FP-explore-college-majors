I very much enjoyed this film.  I found it interesting on a number of levels.

We showed it to our kids (ages 8, 12, and 15), and we had a fascinating discussion about the subject matter afterward.

I would say this movie is definitely worth buying.",1390694400,,292,4.351851851851852
8530042,5,B008RCUZ76,"I know I'm prejudiced, but I really enjoyed this film. It's a different view of polygamy the society outside the Mormon culture doesn't understand. Polygamy was discontinued before 1889. The marriage portrayed in the film had been performed before the ban, and therefore legal. Part of my delight in the film is that the villian (sheriff) is my nephew Paul Hunt. He's a great actor because he really is a nice guy!
It was a pleasure to watch the bonding that took place between the mother and daughter of the first wife and the daughter and the sister of the second wife. The LDS community will appreciate the trials faced, and the non-LDS will gain insights into the early church. I recommend the DVD to anyone.",1369526400,,712,4.658730158730159
