8472343,5,B005GUIN9Y,"Fangoria Fright Fest delivers yet again. Pig Hunt is a wildly entertaining movie, part horror, part comedy. When veteran John (Travis Aaron Wade) brings his girlfriend Brooks and his best buddies to his dead uncle's cabin to hunt for wild hogs, it seems like your normal weekend in the woods, but as they delve into the forest, they learn the awful truth about just how his uncle died and the local legend of the ""Ripper"". Mix in some crazy drug fueled cultish hippies and some of John's own backwoods kin, and the basis of a wicked little film is born. While some characters may be over the top, the dialogue is well written and believable. The monster is a true life nightmare one could actually imagine rather than a faceless, nameless wraith. The soundtrack is full of Les Claypool's work while he also lends his acting talent to the role of ""Preacher"". A couple of the movie tracks are the kind you find yourself remembering and perhaps even singing days after hearing them, especially Claypool's hillbilly rap, ""Boonville Stomp"" and ""He Was a Good Man (Now He's Gone)"". The protagonists are ones you honestly want to root for and to see conquer the evil wreaking havoc. Newcomer, Travis Aaron Wade, is a charismatic leading man and his girlfriend, played by Tina Huang, is recognizable from her ""Rizzoli & Isles"" character as Dr. Maura Isles assistant. The only downfall for this film is the characters of the drug crazed cult but fortunately, the rest of the story is engaging enough to forgive this. If ""Jaws"" and ""Deliverance"" had a baby, ""Pig Hunt"" would be it.",1470182400,,1571,4.737226277372263
8472344,4,B005GUIN9Y,"John Hickman (Travis Aaron Wade) and wife (Tina Huang) go boar hunting with a bunch of John's military buddies. Along the way they have the proverbial local yahoo hassle and there is a legend about a 3,000 pound boar named Ripper.

Good blood spray, ample killing, some guts, and ample nudity toward the end of the film. Enjoyable characters, and that's what makes a great ""B"" film.",1397952000,2,382,4.701492537313433
