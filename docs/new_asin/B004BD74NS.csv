4315173,4,B004BD74NS,My four year old graddaughter loves to watch it while we ride in the car.  I can see her smiling in my rear view mirror and she often laughs and tells me what she is laughing about.  Those moments are worth millions.,1302134400,,216,4.119047619047619
4315174,5,B004BD74NS,"This DVD was our first introduction to Chuggington, and we love it!  My daughter prefers it to Thomas the Train Engine and I have to say I do, too.  There's just so much to love about it, from the engaging characters (engines) to the brightly colored 3-D graphics.  There's nothing slow or boring, either - it kept my 3-year-old's interest from beginning to end, and she asked me to replay the DVD after it had run through all of the episodes.  She's singing the theme song, too - it's so cute!  We're thinking about buying some of the Chuggington toy trains now that we've seen this and become attached to the characters.

The lessons learned in each short episode are easily applied to a little one's daily life.  For instance, in the first episode, ""Braking Brewster"", Brewster learns about the importance of listening.  He couldn't remember if he was supposed to go downhill slow or fast (with a full load) and finds himself in a scary situation that a friend is able to help him out of safely.  The rest of the episodes are the same with everyday skills and lessons that you want your little one to learn introduced in a fun and entertaining way.",1300492800,4,1151,4.548543689320389
4315175,5,B004BD74NS,"This is a great DVD.  My 11-month-old daughter loves Chuggington.  It's a very upbeat and positive show.  I wish there were a few more episodes on here, since they're each only about 10 minutes long, but this is a good hour's worth of entertainment for the price.",1299974400,,263,4.553191489361702
4315176,5,B004BD74NS,"It was hard to find a Chuggington DVD.  This one is perfect.  It is multiple episodes on one DVD - I like that because I can say ""you can watch two shows"", and it stimulates their creativity with their toys, yet they aren't watching TV all day.  It is a fun DVD!!!  My 3 year old and my 6 year old both enjoy it.  Good price too.",1299801600,,329,3.8507462686567164
4315177,5,B004BD74NS,"Got it for my nephew's 5th birthday. He absolutely loves it! :) I hope there are more of these made because I will most likely purchase them for my own kids or my nephews. The guaranteed price for purchasing before the release date worked great, as well! I saved an extra $3 after I originally purchased it. Thanks, Amazon!",1299542400,,323,4.491525423728813
4315178,4,B004BD74NS,"Like many of my children's favorite DVDs,, our family first discovered Chuggington on Treehouse.  Even though it has clearly been created for the preschool crowd, even my seven-year-old really enjoys the antics of these cheerful, computer-animated trains.  Similar to a modern-day Thomas the Tank Engine, this up-to-date train series has a very neat, futuristic train station, curvy streamlined engines, and short episodes that you can use to piece out just a bit of Chuggington at a time, or the whole shebang.

The first Chuggington collection to be released on DVD, Let's Ride the Rails includes six episodes:

Braking Brewster
Clunky Wilson
Can't Catch Koko
Old Puffer Pete's Tour
Koko On Call
Hodge and the Magnet
Each episode is around ten-minutes in length, making for a total running time of 62 minutes.

There are also some coloring pages and activity sheets included on the DVD in pdf form that you can print from your computer, and a fun memory card game that can be played on screen on your television with your remote control.

The Chuggers learn to help each other, be polite, be considerate, apologize to each other, and many other character-skills vital to life.  This is great because unfortunately some children's programming does NOT encourage the development of positive character traits in children.  This is very naturally integrated into the storylines, and is never overly preachy.  My children often ask for Chuggington, it's a very fun series for them to watch and the positive models presented to them certainly add to its appeal to me as a parent.

I have to warn you in advance, Chuggington has one of the most addictive theme songs I've ever heard.  If you aren't afraid of finding yourself dancing around the house singing it to yourself throughout the day (ahem), then go ahead and get a copy.",1299369600,40,1825,4.970394736842105
4315179,4,B004BD74NS,"We LOVE Chuggington in our home.  We DVR all the episodes on the Disney channel and my son cannot get enough.  I was a little disappointed to learn (after I received the DVD) that it contained 6 episodes (of which we already have on our DVR).  I didn't read the description before pre-ordering it.  I just saw the title ""Ride the Rails"" and saw that the length was over 60 mins and assumed that it was a movie.  Phooey.  My fault.  I guess this will go to grandmas house, no harm.  I'm just bummed I paid for something I already had for free. :(",1297296000,,545,4.173076923076923
4315180,5,B004BD74NS,"We have been a fan of Chuggington for a couple of years now and couldn't be happier that they are finally releasing a DVD.  We've recorded a number of episodes off of TV onto a recordable DVD, but it will be nice to have a genuine DVD for our kids to watch.

As parents we love Chuggington because they actually treat each other nice.  If they do something wrong, they apologize to each other and ask for forgiveness; they don't just say, ""I'm sorry"" and that's it, but they say what they are sorry for and understand the they shouldn't do it again.  It's how we are trying to raise our kids, so it's good for them to see examples of what we expect of them when they do something wrong.  There is another train-type show that has been around for many years that we won't allow our kids to watch; they never learn what they did wrong and bring correction or resolution to the situation.  That's just not acceptable for our home, how we live and how we are raising our children.

The fact that they quality of the production with awesome graphics is just icing on the cake for us.  The character are fun with great personalities and they genuinely care about each other.  We would recommend this show to any parent who is looking for good wholesome TV that they don't have to filter before their kids watch it.",1297036800,24,1308,4.371900826446281

4315204,5,B004BD74NS,"My 3-year old granddaughter has trouble even  saying ""Chuggington""  but we
have to watch the DVD over and over! The individual shows are short enough
to enjoy without losing her attention and the messages are clear, but not
preachy. Excellent purchase.",1380067200,,252,5.121951219512195

4315207,3,B004BD74NS,"The material itself is good but they have changed the accents on this film from english accents, which is what the cartoon usually is in, to american accents. I don't think they should have changed it just because it is zoned for the states.",1371168000,,241,4.5
4315208,5,B004BD74NS,"My boys love this DVD and watch it over and over while we drive around town.  The episodes are short, which is nice for kids who want to finish the episode before they move on to something else.  The song is very catchy, which can be unfortunate when it gets stuck in my head, haha. But overall, I like Chuggington. The characters are fun and friendly and learn little lessons in the shows, like not teasing, paying attention to directions, etc. I would definitely get more of these Chuggington DVDs.",1364601600,,500,4.544444444444444
4315209,5,B004BD74NS,"My kid loves Chuggington.  There's more action than Thomas the Train and the stories seem to be more accessible to him.  The voices are clear and the animation is solid.  6 episodes so there's some variety, but you'll want to pick up other discs.",1363046400,,246,4.545454545454546

4315217,5,B004BD74NS,"We got this from the library and I was pleasantly surprised.  The lessons are actually beneficial and make sense (not like some nonsensical Little People lesson recaps), the trains have exciting adventures without an evil nemesis train and the other trains aren't rude and hateful (unlike Thomas the Train dvds we've seen).  Other than the super repetitive theme song (my 4-year-old even asked why they keep saying ""Chuggington"" over and over in the song), it's a great dvd and I highly recommend it for younger kids (my boys are age 4.5 and 2.5 and both love it).",1309910400,,564,4.804123711340206
4315218,5,B004BD74NS,My grandson is nuts over this DVD.  He will watch it over and over again.  Given the choice he would rather watch Chugginton over Thomas and Friends.,1304553600,,149,4.481481481481482
4315219,5,B004BD74NS,"Finally, a train show I can enjoy to watch with my son. Fun, energetic, upbeat voices and music that makes my son smile & dance. And I actually don't mind playing it again and again.",1302566400,,182,4.228571428571429
4315220,4,B004BD74NS,"We were so excited when Chuggington came out on DVD, however, I didn't realize that there's only 6 episodes and each episode is only about 15 minutes long, so this is shorter than most kids dvds. Also, there are so many great episodes, and most of the kids favorites did not make it onto this dvd. And when watching the show in tv, they have a ""Badge Quest"" in between each episode, the dvd does not. We DVD the episodes, and actually prefer to watch those instead of the DVD.

Chuggington is a great show though. It is very kid friendly and much easier to watch and understand than the Thomas the Train show. Chuggington teaches values and is really a great show. I enjoy watching it with my kids and would have loved the DVD to be longer and have some of the better episodes. Especially since it took such a long time to come out on DVD.",1302393600,4,839,4.276729559748428
