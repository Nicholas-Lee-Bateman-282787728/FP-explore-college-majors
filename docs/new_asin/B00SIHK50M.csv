8698437,5,B00SIHK50M,"This collection of historic videos will be a must-have for dance lovers for several reasons:

1) it features the video of Balanchine's ""Square Dance"" with the caller. Balanchine later eliminated the caller but in this 1960 video you can see Balanchine's original thoughts on the ballet, which was to make it a formal American square dance using baroque music. This video also features the incredible performance by Patricia Wilde. Wilde is a dancer we don't hear about much anymore, but watch her here: she's fast, she's musical, she's amazing. Nicholas Magallanes is an amazing partner. And the caller just shows how much American culture Balanchine was able to absorb into his ballets. ""Down the center with the butterfly twirl"" accompanies a pirouette. ""Make your feet go wickety wack"" is another command.

2) Allegra Kent and Jacque d'Amboise in Balanchine's Sylvia pas de deux. This has fallen out of the NYCB repertoire, and Kent was rarely filmed in her prime (she had three babies and a lot of personal problems). But here you can see what an luminous dancer she was. Why this pas de deux was dropped from the repertoire I don't know. It's a charmer. Allegra Kent is also featured in a cheesy piece of Americana called ""Concert for Art Lovers."" This whole video actually shows how handsome and star-like Jacque d'Amboise was in his prime.

3) Lupe Serrano in Giselle pas de deux. Serrano is almost forgotten today and even during her day her Giselle was considered inferior to Markova, Alonso, and Fracci. But the excerpt from Giselle shows Serrano's lightning fast entrechats and gargouillades, something many modern day Giselles struggle with.

But that's not all there is to enjoy in this video. I confess I have an allergy Anton Dolin's Pas de Quatre, but watching Alicia Alonso, Nora Kaye, Melissa Hayden, and Mia Slavenska dance it was delightful. Four very different dancers with very different background and training. It's interesting.

Melissa Hayden is also featured in excerpts from Sleeping Beauty. I can't say she's Margot Fonteyn but it's interesting to see her outside her usual repertoire. There's also some cheesy by-now forgotten choreography: a ridiculously costumed Violette Verdy and Jacque d'Amboise in Donald Saddler's version of Midsummers Night Dream. Thankfully both Ashton and Balanchine later made far superior classic versions.

This is overall just a great video for lovers of vintage dance footage.",1453593600,12,2438,5.143939393939394
