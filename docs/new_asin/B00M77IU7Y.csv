8670518,5,B00M77IU7Y,It's difficult to rate this as unfortunately I hadn't noticed that it was for playing in USA etc so couldn't play it.  It sounded good in the write up and the trailer but unfortunately I couldn't watch it.  I have rated it 5 star as Amazon were great about refunding the price and postage.  It's a shame I'd like to have seen it and know there is a way but I'm not technical enough with IT to do that.,1428883200,,401,4.050632911392405
8670519,5,B00M77IU7Y,"David Bond and his team do a fantastic job in the film of making a case for nature as the easiest to advertise product out there.

It's easy for adults and kids alike to get caught obsessing over their Smartphones, or binge watching TV shows, but this film shows that if we make an effort, we can make nature an important part of our lives again.

I would recommend this film to people of all ages, but it may be of particular interest to parents with young children, or people who are interested in the environment.",1408492800,3,516,4.364583333333333
