7988831,4,B000093NR5,"Having watched the previes installments of this series, I was expecting the last disk to be more conclusive than it was.

This installment successfully wraps up the mystery of the previous disc, and continues with new episodes after that, ending with a story which could possibly conclude the series, but instead kindof trails off with ""to be continued..."" so that I wonder if there aren't supposed to be more episdes than have actually been released  in the US.

In anycase, I would recommend this dvd to anyone who's seen and liked the Previous Hyper Police episodes, but not to someone who is uninitiated. The animation is kind of bland sometimes but it's still a step up from most modern US television cartoons. Besides, if you watch Hyper Police it's not for the animation... it's for the cat-girl Natsuki! :D",1092960000,2,814,4.841726618705036
