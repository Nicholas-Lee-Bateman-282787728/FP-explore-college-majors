I felt like I was watching one of the funny American Idol auditions. This guy may be giving you good tips, but it's hard to confidently learn singing from someone who so obviously does not have a great singing voice himself.",1308873600,,368,4.125

All the techniques in this level lead to the next series of events that teach you to navigate difficult singing.  Of any style!  The warm up is key and you have to stay focused during it.  If you go on auto pilot while doing the exercises and just keep hoping they are going to make you better, then you're missing the point.  Learning to sing difficult music requires some assembly of the voice.  Some coordination skills more than anything else.  And no, I'm not a hardcore heavy metal singer or teacher.  The material in this product is almost identical to the material in the other instruction programs I have.  But anyone who thinks the core fundamentals in singing Metal is different from other styles is sadly mistaken.  Great Metal singers learn to use good technique and then attach the kinds of resonance found in Heavy Metal to that solid singing foundation.  If they don't they are (and sound like it) faking it.  And their voices do not last long.  The voice is very specific about how much you can abuse it.

So good luck to all.  I wish you the best in your pursuits of singing.",1303862400,2,1113,4.522613065326633
