I was about to throw my VHS copy away! - it's nothing I would give as a gift, and I don't want to see it again. (If you pay the postage, you can have my copy for free -  my e-mail is philip1@post3.tele.dk.)",1119916800,,317,4.031746031746032
7864096,5,6304189389,"As far as I know, Camillie Paglia is the only person to ever appear on Politically Incorrect BY HERSELF!  At the time, the show was only a half hour I think, and it was NOT enough time. She speaks so fast, after one of  her rants, Bill Maher just SITS THERE FROZEN trying to take it all in.  I  attended the college she teaches at and I have taken 2 of her courses. (I  even let her borrow one of my Adult Anime tapes) She is a genius among  geniuses and anyone who thinks otherwise is obviosly not intelligent or  well-versed enough to ""get"" what she is saying.",949968000,16,562,4.148148148148148
