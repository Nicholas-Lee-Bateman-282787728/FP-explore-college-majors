4463961,1,B004SLEW60,I received the wrong movie. I received The Perfect Man with Heather Locklear in it. So at this time I do not have a review for The Perfect Man. I suggest that when you have more than one movie with the same title please may sure the vendor send the correct one that the customer order.,1331596800,2,285,4.107142857142857
4463962,5,B004SLEW60,"I saw the original stageplay in Los Angeles and was excited to hear that it was being released on DVD.  What a fantastic DVD and play!  The actors are gorgeous and play their roles well.  I ran thru the gamut of emotions watching this movie; laughter, sadness, disgust, love, hope, trust...you name it, it was in there!  I'm especially impressed with the writing and the soundtrack.  The title of this DVD may be The Perfect Man, but we know that he doesn't exist!  Sure, someone can be ""perfect for you"", but not perfect.  The main female character finds this out the hard way.  I can't wait to see more movies by this Writer/Director.",1330300800,2,636,4.566371681415929
4463963,4,B004SLEW60,Not too sure how to review this one. My wife and I happen to catch this one night on TV. The cast was solid at best ** The main characters (females and males for you ladies) are very easy on the eyes and that helps**. It had a few laugh/funny moments and some serious times. The plot was surprisingly well thought out and for a play it was watchable. I guess the problem my wife and I had was why any of this (actions of the 2 lead characters) even took place. ***** This is not a spoiler just some of the plot/beginning first 5-10 min play that is already stated*****  Russell (Christian Keys) and Bailey (Jazsmin Lewis) call their marriage over years ago but they agreed to stay together until their son left for college. He leaves and Bailey (Jazsmin Lewis)does try to work it out with him but he has no interest in making it work. Why????? that little bit is missing for me (In my opinion). Her best friend then sets her up on a blind date etc.... There is a brief conversation and mention that they broke up because he cheated on her and she was not taking care of business at home etc.. Maybe we were just to assume that he cheated a few times maybe hit her or something and they argued a lot etc... Since none of that ever happened on stage (yes I know it's a play and can only have a certain run time) I just did not see why they could not get along and work it out. I guess if they did work it out we would not have this play LOL. Aside from that we enjoyed it and gave it 4 stars.,1322524800,2,1490,4.068027210884353
4463964,3,B004SLEW60,"Everybody on the internet looking for a date 'LIES,LIES, LIES'. They can pretend to be anyone, doing any kind of job, CEOs, PRESIDENTS of Corp, Millionairs, Moguels, and all other kinds of lies they tell to meet a woman, and get over.

This guy,Jason, said he was celebit 3 yrs; own his own company; lied he gave his heart to someone else, and he died after it ended. She fell for it when he said he was celebit.

It's a shame that it takes only a little bit for a man to say a few chosen words before a woman faLL all over herself for him and eat every word up he says, lies and all.  Womem can be so gullible being desperate for a man.  Need to love yourself first, and date yourself, love you, get to know you and who you are, and be YOUR BEST FRIEND,FIRST, BEFORE YOU LOVE ANOTHER.  That's where women get lost and get messed over so badly. Looking for a man to fulfill them instead of being fulfilled within yourself and In God.

Dont let a man idendify who you are. You are someone without a man.

Her girlfriend was too eager to get her out on a date  soon after her husband left instead of encouraging her to be a good wife to her man. Had a baby and gave it all to him and left hubby alone. He got tired of being alone with no love from her and found it someone else. That is when friends, parents, pastor, someone responsible  should have counselled them/her to take care of your man also or you will lose him.

Jason showed up at her house with wine and rose petals and hubby came in and she put him out over Jason in his house. But Jason was a snake and put a mickey in her drink to rape her, and was saved by son and hubby.

You'd have to see it to find out what happened.  I did not like he girls gettting together looking and acting ghetto. We can do better than that making these plays. We have to stop making the world think this is the only way African American are and act.  IT'S A LIE. We must come out of the box white hollywood put us in and show the true life of many great black relationship, dating and families.",1319328000,,2037,4.0625

4463972,5,B004SLEW60,"I really enjoyed watching this movie, it teach you about commitment, honesty, trust, and what the marriage vows means when you state them. Marriage is honorable before God.

4463986,5,B004SLEW60,"I rated this movie at 5 stars because the premise was so believable; a married couple who had both made mistakes and didn't know how to overcome them to save their marriage, but staying together to raise their child. It was realistic and I loved the scenes with the two leads. I thought it meandered a bit when the rebound guy showed up and was obviously no good, leading to a rathe rpat fnale, but overall a very good watch.",1396483200,,425,4.325

4463992,4,B004SLEW60,I enjoyed this very much especially because it focuses on forgiveness and how a marriage can withstand and conquer challenges if both people are willing to work at it.  I appreciate movies with an ethical base that come full circle.,1370563200,,232,4.8
4463993,5,B004SLEW60,"I first must say that I am fans of the actors and actress' in this play.
