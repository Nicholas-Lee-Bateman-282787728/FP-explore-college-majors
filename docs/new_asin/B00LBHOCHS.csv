6479150,5,B00LBHOCHS,Thank You Amazon For Release Doug Complete Nickelodeon Series I Love It Doug Its My Favorite Show When I Was a Kid I Was 2 Years Old By Then I am 21 Years Old And Still Love Doug,1405209600,2,178,3.710526315789474
6479151,5,B00LBHOCHS,"The price of this set alone is what makes all of the small issues no issue at all. The thing about buying these MOD dvd-r shows brand new is that there are usually a few scratches on them. Two discs in the Doug set had small scratches and finger prints on them. And like others have said, no episode list. But We get the entire series for 22 bucks. That's pretty awesome.",1405209600,,371,4.166666666666667
6479152,4,B00LBHOCHS,"It's great that Nickelodeon finally released all of their episodes of Doug on MOD DVD! The discs work great. The video and audio vary, but they never really look or sound bad. Despite this, there is something about the set that kind of bothers me.

On the later episodes in the set, the second segments of the episodes (For example, Doug's Bad Trip, Doug's Babysitter) open somewhat abruptly, with maybe a second cut off from the beginning, Some episodes that begin with Doug saying ""Dear Journal..."" open with Doug saying ""--r Journal..."" with the ""Dear..."" partially cut off.

Don't worry, this does not apply to every episode though. It really only applies to Season 4 episodes. I'm glad to say that it is otherwise a worthwhile set, having previously owned the separate&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Season-1/dp/B001EHDSOS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Season 1</a>&nbsp;set. I also hope that Disney will eventually release their episodes, since all of the Disney version that's available on DVD is the movie, which I own on VHS.",1405123200,9,1075,5.548780487804878
6479153,5,B00LBHOCHS,product was just as described and shipped fast!!,1404950400,,48,5.125
6479154,4,B00LBHOCHS,"First, I just want to say, that it's totally awesome that Amazon is finally giving us Doug complete on DVD! After waiting several years after only having the ""Best of"" for season 4, it's great to have those missing episodes. I don't know if that was an issue on Nickelodeon's part and they wouldn't GIVE the episodes to Amazon, or if it was something on Amazon's part by not getting all the episodes FROM Nickelodeon and only just recently decided to complete these seasons and shows. Either way, it's just great that it's now complete (and for a very fair price too).

I'll skip reviewing the show, since it's over 20 years old, we all know it's great and I doubt that someone is looking at this product if they aren't familiar with it.

There are only a very few nits I have to pick with this set, and I don't feel that any of them should dissuade anyone from buying it, but I just thought I'd point these out in case anyone was curious.

The biggest issue I have, is that there is no episode list on the set like there are with other Amazon Nicktoon releases (which have always been on the back of the case). There's no way of knowing which episodes are on which disc (other than checking online). Shout! Factory did this with their Rocko's Modern Life and AAAHH!!! Real Monsters too, and it's pretty annoying.

Another issue, the episodes aren't separated by season, which means that the season 1 finale and season 2 premiere are in the middle of the same disc. Though, with a show like Doug that's episodic and doesn't feature episode arcs, it really doesn't matter. It's just something I'd like to point out. For the sake of using less discs, it's better in the long run.

This is a more legitimate problem: there's a somewhat brief pause (maybe a second and a half) between when an episode ends and the ending credits that follow. It kind of interrupts the flow. Again, not a big issue, but worth noting. It also shows the Nickelodeon logo before every episode. It's a little obnoxious because the volume seems to be louder than the actual episodes (Nickelodeon seems to do that with ALL their DVDs and Blu-rays though, it's not a problem exclusive to this set).

The chapter breaks are another low point. Rather than have a chapter break after the opening theme, then put another one where the next episode starts, the chapter breaks are all at the 10:00 mark, which means if you want to watch the second part of an episode, you'll have to hit the ""next chapter"" button, and then fast forward a little bit to get to it.

I'd like to end this review on a more positive note, the picture and sound quality are just fine (nothing spectacular, but still very good and better than VHS of course). The set is DEFINITELY worth buying, and I encourage everyone to do so. A lot of my complaints really are just nitpicks, and don't ruin the enjoyment of this at all.",1404691200,146,2864,4.485604606525912
6479155,5,B00LBHOCHS,this indeed is the full series i can finally own a complete series of my childhood and yes even though i did notice it wasn't completely in order from what i saw on wiki that's not a huge deal,1404345600,5,192,3.948717948717949
6479156,5,B00LBHOCHS,"As the name of this set suggests, this is the full and complete series of Doug from the Nickelodeon run. It does not include episodes from Disney's years (Brand Spankin' New Doug), but as most fans would agree, the only episodes worth owning are the ones in this set anyway.

Several years ago, Amazon and Nickelodeon executed a deal whereby Amazon's new MOD program would produce DVD sets as customers ordered them on DVD-Rs. Among the shows included in this deal was Doug, a show from the early years of Nickelodeon's Nicktoons brand. The first three season sets released without issue, but Season 4 was labeled as ""The Best of Season 4."" Instead of being a true ""Best of"" release, though, it was simply an incomplete Season 4, missing two episodes.

This set rectifies that issue. This is indeed the complete series, with all of the Nicktoons episodes spanning six discs. The discs are DVD-Rs with the purple backs, though in my usage I have not encountered any issues. Each disc is very basic, with a menu image and an option to either Play All or select an episode. There are no episode listings within the packaging, which is a shame because all prior releases had an episode listing per disc on the back of the DVD case.

I cannot comment on the order of the episodes, though some quick research seems to suggest that the episodes are all in order of original airdate (someone correct me if I'm wrong and I'll update this review accordingly). When you select an episode, you either get the opening theme and Nick logo or the episode credits depending on whether the episode was the first or second segment of a full 22-minute episode.

The video quality is acceptable. There is some noticeable grain and early episodes had some particularly jarring animation which improved over time. There is no remastering to speak of on this set. However, comparing it to other shows of the same era (Rocko's Modern Life, Rugrats, and Disney Afternoon shows like Chip 'n' Dale Rescue Rangers and Ducktales), the video quality is most certainly comparable. The audio is basic stereo with some minimal right and left panning. It is nothing special, but it is functional. There are no extras whatsoever here.

The real question at this point is whether you should buy this set. Completionists like myself should definitely buy it even if they already have seasons 1-4 because it's a fair price for the complete series and you get the remaining two episodes. If you've wanted the series on DVD for a long time and held off on ordering it due to the issue with Season 4, now is the time to get it. Likewise, if you're a casual fan with a passing curiosity, it's worth owning (though as of this writing, the whole series is also available to stream with an Amazon Prime membership). For those who already bought the prior season sets, it's a close call. There are two roughly 11-minute segments missing from the Best of Season 4 set which are included on this one. Whether that justifies the additional price is a matter of personal preference.

On the one hand, this is something of a ""too little, too late"" situation where the complete series double dip corrects a problem with the prior release while failing to add any extras justifying the purchase price. On the other hand, I give it 5 stars on the basis of the fact that this is indeed the complete series and getting all the episodes justifies the score. If you've held off buying until this point, don't hesitate to get this set over the individual season releases. If you already have those, from an informative standpoint this is exactly as advertised and rectifies the Season 4 issues, so at least you know what you're getting, but it is hard to recommend the double dip for anyone who is not a completionist.",1404345600,54,3759,4.67927382753404

6479167,4,B00LBHOCHS,"It's so great to have a good (affordable) collection for all the shows I kept hoping would come to DVD for years. I actually liked Doug the least out of my Nickelodeon cartoon favorites, but for this price who can argue? I subtracted one star because of some menu/chapter select issues, and a lack of an insert saying what episodes are on which disc, but really for the affordable pricetag printing out my own is an inconvenience I can work with. I sorta wish these were a digipack style set instead of the box, but I'm just super grateful to have the shows I miss all in one easy place!!",1493769600,,588,4.3545454545454545

6479169,5,B00LBHOCHS,"Loved this show as a kid. Had to get it as an adult. The only downside is that its not in HD and wide screen. Which I understand, due to it being made in the 90's. Other then that it beings back fond memories.",1492905600,,209,3.772727272727273

6479174,4,B00LBHOCHS,Great series! However this one doesn't have the Disney episodes,1489881600,,63,5.4
6479175,5,B00LBHOCHS,Doug is a very good TV show to  preteens understand of life and privacy I used to watch the show as a kid and now my daughter can't get enough of it,1489622400,,148,3.625

6479181,5,B00LBHOCHS,My dvd set came in a clear case. I grew up watching Doug on Nickelodeon and love the show. It has funny moments especially with Doug's enemy Roger Klotz. His best friend Skeeter is a hilarious character too. If you wanna watch thia show I highly recommend iit,1488672000,,259,4.416666666666667
6479182,5,B00LBHOCHS,Great!,1488585600,,6,6.0
6479183,4,B00LBHOCHS,"Here it is the complete nickelodeon series of Doug on 6 disc with cover art for each disc in a compact but quality release, for those wondering why it says ""Nickelodeon Series"" and not the complete series it's simply because Disney would produce more Doug after season Four. This collection contains the nickelodeon run and his best run in my opinion. The DVD's are DVD-R but the quality is great and every single episode is here. They did do something weird and that's why it got a four out of 5, these episode's on the disc are not in the order they aired and jump a bit if you do some research. Below i will include the breakdown so you will see what i am talking about. If your a fan of doug or want to simply show someone else or your kid's what doug was about this set is terrific and you should buy it for your collection.

6479212,5,B00LBHOCHS,"I'm so happy to have this series and not have to worry about the individual, incomplete sets. Amazon's burn-on-demand series is a very important collection for shows we may never see releases for otherwise.
With the popularity of ""Doug"" (pre-Disney acquisition), it's a surprise there was no release prior to Amazon's B-O-D. This show has held up very well over the years. Judy is still the ultimate character of the series and the references made to other series can be appreciated more now that I'm older.
The set itself looks great and doesn't look poorly put together or rushed. The discs are held together inside the casing with plastic holders and don't have any risk of scratching.
This set is exactly what I'd hoped it would be. Highly recommended to fans of the show or ones interested in finding a well written animated series.",1469491200,,837,4.819444444444445

6479217,5,B00LBHOCHS,I really loved this show as a child and I was happy to see it finally available on DVD. Some of the sound is off on some of the episodes which can only be attributed to the fact of constant reruns before they actually decided to merge the show onto DVD.,1466553600,,253,3.980392156862745

6479220,4,B00LBHOCHS,"The discs do look like they were burned onto the disc by someone's computer. There are no subtitles, so if you need them, you will be disappointed. The Nickelodeon title that plays before every episode is incredibly loud while the show is rather quiet. As for the picture quality, it wasn't as bad as I expected from other reviews. Sure it's a little fuzzy, but it's the same quality it was when it was on tv in the 90's, so no complaints about there from me.",1464739200,,459,4.348837209302325

Neither my son nor I found any flaws with the set we received. The casing and dvds were in great shape and we didn't have any issues in regards to playback. Instead we enjoyed a fun Doug marathon that inspired my youngest to start writing his own diary and trying to create his own comic version of Quail Man and Quail Dog! All in all, this was a great purchase and I am so happy we found it.",1464480000,,551,4.0181818181818185

6479301,5,B00LBHOCHS,"I was very forunate to be a 90's kid where Nickelodeon released many of the best old school shows that a 90's kid could possibly love. One of those early 90's shows was ""Doug"" a preteen kid moving to a new town to start a new life after his dad Phil gets a job as a photographer. This show  shows has an ensemble of lovable characters but is always detailed in Doug's point of view through the works of him writing in his journal about his new life in Bluffington. He's a shy/reserved kid with an overactive imagination that goes through many situations and usually thinks of the worst on what could happen when he needs to make a decision on what to do. Doug is such a positive show in a way that the theme is generally ""How to do the right thing"" even when you won't benefit from it and there's plenty of life lessons that's thrown in and always recommend a show that has such a positive theme. For me Doug was such a positive show it eventually influenced me to write in my own journal that because of this show it always starts out with ""Dear Journal""!",1439337600,,1056,4.253731343283582

With all my anticipation from my childhood memories, imagine my dismay when the dvd's would not play!

6479307,4,B00LBHOCHS,"It's an absolute delight to go from those old orange Nickelodeon VHS tapes (remember those!?) to an entire series in one standard DVD case. Amazon did a great job preparing this set, though it's a little bit of a bummer that, like all their Manufactured-On-Demand DVDs, no special features were included. It really would've been nice to get some commentary from Billy West or Creator Jim Jenkins on how they view the beloved Nicktoon 20 years later.

As an animation enthusiast, I'm a little disappointed in the audio quality. The tacked-on modern Nickelodeon bumper is rather loud on my surround sound system, while the actual episodes are very quiet in comparison, at least a 10-15 db difference. As for the video quality, there are some noticable, small annoyances like a weird white line on the edge of the screen or scratches on the film transfer.

Still, I am grateful that this set exists for big kids (20 or 30-something who grew up with this cartoon) and a new generation of kids alike. Remember Amazon, when it comes to nostalgic products, the little things matter. Cleaning up film transfers or balancing the audio levels a bit before recording goes a long way in the eyes of the fans. Fans like me.",1435622400,,1210,4.757142857142857

6479323,5,B00LBHOCHS,"Shortly after the 2nd and 9th seasons of Rugrats became whole season sets in 2014, via Amazon's CreateSpace program, Amazon put all 4 seasons of Doug (when it was only a Nicktoon) in 1 normal-sized DVD case; 6 dual-layered DVD-R discs to be exact, containing all 52 uncut episodes of Doug from his Nicktoon run! There's 9 shows apiece on discs 1 to 4, and 8 apiece on discs 5 & 6, and all 52 shows have closed captioning in them here! If only they took such a measure for Rugrats' 2nd season, making it a 3-disc set instead of 4, but probably didn't want to, to not make all the show's other season sets seem inferior in comparison. You never know what kind of situation Doug and his friends and family will get into next with this set; such as Doug inventing Quailman and Quaildog, trying to bag a nematode, getting in trouble at school (and with #1 bully Roger Klotz), trying to woo his crush Patti Mayonaise, dressing as Hamburger Boy, surviving Mr. Dink's wacky and very expensive inventions, his dog Porkchop getting into a heartbreaking lawsuit at Christmastime from gravely-misjudged heroic deeds, meeting his and buddy Skeeter Valentine's favorite band The Beets, Skeeter being considered a genius, getting addicted to video games (via Super Pretendo) to the point of forgetting his homework, having meals at the Honker Burger, trying to overcome his gloomy feelings of graduation, and tons more! Some DVD reviewers' clips show the case for this set as solid black, as the one I got for my sister and niece for Christmas 2014 was all clear, as with my own from eBay in the summer of 2015! Black or clear, the cases don't contain an episode list, so you'll have to make one from scratch yourself, like I did for my Rocko, Angry Beavers, ChalkZone, and Real Monsters complete series sets. You know I did the same with Doug's Complete Nicktoon series when I got one for myself. Luckily, there's episode selection menus on every disc for making such a list, or not being able to play every show in the disc at once! Somehow after the Nicktoon series, it became a Disneytoon series lasting 3 more seasons with 65 shows AND a theatrical movie, Doug's 1st Movie. Sadly, the movie is the only part of the Disneytoon run on DVD, and only from the Disney Movie Club. The Nicktoon run still belongs with Nick to this day, as Doug's Disneytoon run is still with Disney. Digimon went through something like that in 2012, only the whole series went from Disney back to Saban Brands, being televised on Nicktoons (seasons 1, 2, 6, 7 and 8 only), as well as Cinedigm for home video & Digital Download releases! If you're building a classic Nicktoon DVD collection, along with those from Shout Factory, here's a great example of a classic Nicktoon to add to it. In fact, it debuted the same day as Rugrats and Ren & Stimpy back in August of 1991, and it's a favorite of my sister's, alongside Rugrats and Hey Arnold! If you want the whole Nicktoon version of Doug, you can put the season sets in hock if you wish, especially the incomplete season 4 set (via ""best of""), which left out at least 2 whole shows somehow, through here or eBay! I never have seen MOD-DVD sets in pawn or thrift shops before, especially Goodwill. As Skeeter might say, ""you and your whole families are gonna enjoy this little-giant package deal, honk-honk! AOOGA!""",1430092800,4,3331,4.618887015177066

6479384,3,B00LBHOCHS,So are all nickelodeon shows like this where the dvds are  DVD - R the only reason I am writing this review is because I ordered Three things from Amazon that are nickelodeon and they are the same quality they are all DVD - R now I noticed also you did write down a disclamer that they are DVD - R. I just was not expecting what I was expecting. The I  have a dvd in right now seems to be working okay. I guess I am just going to have to be careful with  the nick series if they are all going to be like this cause I did order more nick stuff off of amazon. A little disappointed by it but I am sure I'll get over it if they work like they should. Sorry if this does not make any sense,1412208000,,685,3.7430555555555554
6479385,2,B00LBHOCHS,"Amazon's ""manufactured-on-demand"" titles by CreateSpace have seriously decreased in quality over the years.  Poor print quality of disc & cover art, flimsy DVD storage cases, and sheer creative neglect (laziness) have turned this once-promising service into a huge disappointment.  Most of you reading this review could probably design and create a higher-quality, more professional-looking product at home all by yourselves.

COVER ART:  I immediately noticed the dark, dull colors of the DVD cover art (don't expect that Nickelodeon logo to be the bright orange that you're used to).  The ink coverage and tones were inconsistent, most noticeably in large areas of one color (like Doug's face).  I removed and inspected the cover art's paper insert; it seemed to be just plain, thin copy paper.  A thicker, glossy/photo paper should have been used to produce brighter colors and better overall print quality.

DISCS:  DVD-R discs with printable surfaces are used to manufacture these DVD sets.  Though these discs are known to be more susceptible to scratches, I was glad to see the label colors looking much brighter, printed on the bright-white surface of the disc.  However, none of the six discs in my set were properly aligned when the labels were printed.  This resulted in odd-looking, slightly-askew disc art.

CONTENT:  After having several playback issues, including skipping and freezing, I inspected the discs to find that each disc only had about 1/4 of the capacity written to it, as if the burn process failed at the same point on each disc.  This was enough frustration for me - I packed up the product and shipped it back for a refund.  From what I was able to view, the video quality was mediocre at best; higher quality than those VHS-ripped bootlegs but still in desperate need of a remaster.

BOTTOM LINE:  Go Digital - Downloading each season will probably cost more than this physical set, but the convenience factor is worth it.  You'll (usually) have a hassle-free streaming experience (not to mention, the possibility of A/V quality upgrade in the future).  Besides, the ""professional"" design and presentation of this box set is nothing at all to write home about.

If physical media is a must for your entertainment library, this is your only ""official release"" option... but beware possible write errors/glitches, and certainly don't expect the DVD case to look pretty or ""fit in"" with store-bought series sets on your shelf.",1412208000,33,2455,5.102756892230577

6479399,5,B00LBHOCHS,"Well, this is the complete ''Nickelodeon'' series alright, the superior Doug series which ran from 1991 to 1994. But it is NOT the complete show. The series continued from 1996 to 1999, distributed by Disney. I understand that the Disney version was much, much inferior, but it is still the continuing episodes. I wish the complete ''Disney'' series could be released so we could have the entire series on DVD.",1409961600,,410,4.871428571428571

6479401,5,B00LBHOCHS,I know it's burnt to DVD-R but it will have to do for now until some other company decides to buy the rights and legitimately put this classic 90s cartoon out there on the retail shelves where it belongs with so many other Nickelodeon classics!  I'm just really happy to finally have the entire series in my hands and be able to watch it whenever I want!  Thanks Amazon!,1409616000,,370,4.3478260869565215

6479403,5,B00LBHOCHS,Doug was a handful of great shows back in the early 90's. I bought this show when I found out that this was available at such an affordable price. I can't wait to show my kids this shows.,1409184000,,187,3.9473684210526314

6479406,3,B00LBHOCHS,"Doug, Doug, Doug, it was a cool show man. This review is for the quality of the merchandise and transfer- not on my personal opinion of the show. The show is great, buy this if you love it. If you are a collector or stickler for super quality, do not buy this. The DVDs are the purple fake burned DVDs people use for copying discs at home....pretty lame. Do what thou wilt, where else are you gunna watch it at?",1408579200,3,411,4.15
6479407,5,B00LBHOCHS,I loved this show when I was a kid. I'm sol glad they packaged the entire nickelodeon series into a 6 disc set. Rey practical design for a good price.,1408579200,,150,4.033333333333333

6479410,5,B00LBHOCHS,"Love this show as a kid, glad to see nick have a official release instead of buying fake copies from non reliable sources.

6479412,5,B00LBHOCHS,"Looks just like it did in Non Hd in 1991-1994. Since Nickelodeon won't come off of these this is the best way to get them and even if Nick did come off of this series and put it out, it wouldn't look too too much better, unless they remastered in HD on Bluray lol.",1407196800,,264,3.9074074074074074
6479413,4,B00LBHOCHS,"Checked most of the episodes, they look fine. Except Doug's Babysitter but that episode's issue seems to be a source issue. Which can't be fixed so other than that, this set is great.",1406937600,,183,4.575757575757576
6479414,5,B00LBHOCHS,"Great Cartoon, my favorite I love it. It's clean compare to the modern cartoons. It brings me back childhood memory.

8665003,5,B00LBHOCHS,"I constantly watched this show back in the day every time it was on & always enjoyed every minute of it! I have a few Nickelodeon series DVD's in my collection so I had to add this set for sure! This was my favorite cartoon after Rugrats back in the day & it's great to own all of the episodes now. The picture quality isn't what you call great (it's a bit blurry & fuzzy), but I wasn't getting my hopes up too high since we're all so used to HD & 4K nowadays. Besides that this is a great set. I've been watching it almost everyday lately & I'm currently halfway through the 3rd season & the discs play perfectly so far. Still love the show now as much as I did then! A must have for any 90's kid!",1531094400,,698,3.9574468085106385

8665005,1,B00LBHOCHS,"This is specifically in regards to the quality of the DVD and not the show.  I loved the show but after a couple of plays the DVD's stopped working. I have an Xbox one and when it tries to load the video it fails.

Great show, bad discs.

Unfortunately because it took awhile to die, I'm kind of stick with them.",1530316800,,312,4.081967213114754
