8133835,4,B000GPU3ZQ,"I watched Alaipayuthe because I love the song Yaro Yarodi, which I had heard on a compilation series called India: The Woman's Voice Bollywood and Beyond. I watched a clip of it on Youtube and it made me want to see the movie because it is joyful and light-hearted and sweet. It turns out Yaro Yarodi is the first song right after the credits. I enjoyed this movie, but it is not quite in my top favorites for Bollywood. The story fell apart in the end, and although the acting was good, some of the musical numbers didn't seem up to par with those in other Bollywood films I've loved. That said, the language and filming style were in some ways more realistic than many of the big budget Hindi movies, without as much make up and brand name clothes. The photography was interesting and often beautiful, especially of the trains. It is in either Telugu or Tamil, according to Wikipedia and imdb, respectively, which sounds beautifully musical. I don't speak it, though, so the fact that the subtitles changed extremely rapidly made me miss quite a bit of dialogue. At least they were in large type and easy to read. (I don't normally have a problem with subtitles, so this is not the usual complaint from someone who doesn't like foreign movies for that reason.) The translation to English was hilarious. I'm sure the original made a lot more sense. My husband and I laughed throughout the movie over the English phrases that resulted, like: ""Rub me with olive oil and give me service!"" I can see why this movie was re-made because though it was good in many ways it is a story that could be attempted again. I now want to see Saathiya, the Hindi remake.
