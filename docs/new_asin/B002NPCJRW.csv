8375260,5,B002NPCJRW,"When I bought it I had low expectations. It was well beyond what I had expected in terms of acting-plot-beautiful transfer-thrills and chills. More of a murder mystery than a horror flick,  but lots of fun and great acting. German with excellent English dub.",1477440000,,258,4.863636363636363
8375261,4,B002NPCJRW,"Not bad late 60's color West German-made, English-dubbed Edgar Wallace mystery.  A group of rich men are being murdered for the inheritance by a badly-costumed gorilla.  A self-assured, smart Scotland Yard detective investigates the proceedings.  Some nudity seen at a seedy nightclub.  The color and picture are very good for a Sinister Cinema DVD-R.  My only beef is that the picture is framed by a black band all around.  Since the film is probably not widescreen this is to be expected.  The case art is only so-so.  Other than all that this DVD-R release is highly recommended.",1465171200,2,582,4.927835051546392
