2728449,4,B000MDFTHE,"The rare visit of a periodic comet turns everyone who witness it's return to dust. While those exposed to it in the open air, slowly degrade into flesh-peeling deranged sub-humans! (They're not quite zombies, are they?!)

Night of the Comet is an awesome 80's throwback!!! I remember renting this from my local Mom & Pop video store, copying it to VHS tape, and watching the hell outta this when I was a kid! This movie may have been made on a budget but, it captures the 80's well and is WAY ahead of it's time in portraying it's two lead characters, sisters Regina (Catherine Mary Stewart) and Sam, as average fun-loving, boy-crazy, snarky, resourceful, smart, capable, weapon-trained, badass chicks! That's right... women! This movie must have inspired Joss Whedon's creation of Buffy. Seriously.

Night of the Comet is a genre-masher with well executed elements of sci-fi, horror, action, and comedy. And while the practical special effects and makeup may appear simple and cheap compared to today's CGI dominated world, they remain passable and effective for a 33 year old film.  What's better is the acting and character portrayals by the two female leads. They're fantastic together and it's a lot of fun seeing them react to the new world around them and  everything that comes next. It's a classic. See it!!!",1513296000,,1317,4.9457013574660635

2728468,5,B000MDFTHE,"I used to watch Night of the Comet on television when I was a kid. Back then, I thought it was so great. The end of the world. Everyone disintegrated, except for a lucky few. In my opinion, it was very original, but as an adult, I think it's silly in a good way and entertaining.

The gist of the movie is a comet passes by the Earth. Most people on the planet have vanished. Two sisters survive, and they have to figure out what's going on. They meet a guy. They get into trouble, but the girls fight like Rambo in a department store. There are scientists who knows what has happened, zombies, and yes, a movie montage. All the ingredients needed for a cult movie favorite. It was great watching it again, dated, but fun nonetheless.

2728482,5,B000MDFTHE,"Okay I'm a bit biased being from the generation of 80's teens featured in this movie but it really is a gem.
The movie is about a comet that passes buy earth turning anyone into dust who is outside exposed to it.
Two sisters survive and search out other survivors meeting a variety of characters along the way.
Yes it's science fiction with a dose of humor added to it.
The releasing of the movie on Blu Ray is a godsend as it includes interviews with the main actresses in the bonus section which is a real treat.
Guys if you have a lady who is not crazy about science fiction movies I think she'll like this one for several reasons.
One : Women are the main characters.
Two : There is a touch of humor and romance.
Three : it's rated PG-13 so you don't have to worry about your girl being offended by excessive bad language, violence or nudity.
Highly recommend !",1482796800,,865,4.280487804878049

2728497,3,B000MDFTHE,"cool 80's end of the world movie. Always liked it Always will. Worth watching if you haven't and again if it's been a while. I've seen it many times. On a scale of one to ten for 80's movies this was a solid 6.5. But that was a tough decade to compete in lots of great horror, sci-fi and adventure movies. Prince of Darkness The Gate  Aliens  The Hitcher  Christine  Halloween II  Night of the Demons  Day of the Dead  The Lost Boys  The Fog  Creepshow  Hellraiser  The Howling  Fright Night  Poltergeist  Re-Animator  A Nightmare on Elm Street  The Thing  An American Werewolf in London  Evil Dead II  The Shining  The Return of the Living Dead
Blade Runner  The Terminator  The Empire Strikes Back  Mad Max 2  Predator  The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai Across the 8th Dimension  Weird Science  Altered States  Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home  Scanners  Back to the Future Part I.II, III
Ghostbusters  The Princess Bride  Raiders of the Lost Ark  Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade Full Metal Jacket  Platoon  Die Hard  The Untouchables  Beverly Hills Cop  First Blood
 So as you can see a tough decade indeed. The couple of decades have paled by comparison. You mostly have remakes of 70's 80's and 90's movies and Comic book as well as video games as the inspiration. I think the 80's will be the platinum years of Hollywood when history looks back. In Horror, Science Fiction, Action Adventure and Comedy  movies. Maybe drama as well.",1472169600,,1474,4.60546875

2728542,4,B000MDFTHE,"BOTTOM LINE: Those who love a good adventure & a good laugh will doubtless enjoy this scary-lite end-of-the-world tale. The story is a refreshing take on the familiar post-apocalyptic zombie tropes and yet it's suitable for all but the youngest family members. The film is lots of fun and very well made, giving it a high replay value, which makes it an even better purchase. 4 STARS

THE STORY (contains spoilers): A meteor - which the opening narration claims was responsible for wiping out the dinosaurs 65 million years ago - makes a return trip past the Earth. Every living thing directly exposed to the comet's lethal rays is reduced to piles of red powder, while folks only partially exposed are turned into quasi-zombies. Film focuses on two sisters (who were both coincidentally shielded from the deadly rays) and their adventures in the post-apoc world left behind. A mysterious truck driver and a group of scientific types with questionable motivations help thicken the plot.

THOUGHTS: A fun diversion from the traditional zombie & post-apocalyptic fare. Scary situations & deadly dangers are still present to threaten our heroines & heroes, but NIGHT OF THE COMET also has an infectious sense of free-spirited fun to lighten things up. Cathrine Mary Stewart & Kelli Maroney are terrific as two teenaged sisters who battle zombies & other end-of-the-world hazards, in between bouts of giving each other stylin' make-overs and trying on all the latest totally bitchin' new outfits at a nearby mega mall. Like totally, fer sure! A young Robert Beltran impresses as a fast-on-his-feet trucker who chances upon the sisters at a local radio station and decides to stick with them and see what this uncertain new world has in store for them all. A simple but effective red gel overlay used on the camera lens during all the outdoor shots reminds you that things are no longer what they used to be thanks to that deadly meteor. Bummer, dude! Solid, straightforward direction from Thom Eberhardt keeps the proceedings moving along at a steady clip. A tight script with a few clever ideas keeps this from just being another doom-laden end of the world flick.

THE BLU-RAY: The hi-def transfer for NIGHT OF THE COMET looks & sounds great. Video portion features a good picture, with only minimal artifacting, pixelation and crush (video noise). Solid blacks & mid-tones. No edge enhancement or overuse of DNR to ruin the look of the film. Audio is strong and the soundmix is level & clean. In short, this is a really good release.

Not because Night Of The Comet is a christmas movie, it is because the movie uses the holiday as background. If you really enjoy subtle humour as I do, then you will like this flick; and, I guarantee it will bring a smile or chuckle out of you. What has always drawn me to the film just as much as the story line and the plot, is the rare  soundtrack. Although it is tuff to find and it does command a premium price, the LP is a worthy purchase as well as the movie. So if you are into movies about zombies, this movie will fit right in.

This is an old, corny flick, and not what you might be expecting unless you're familiar with it as kind of a cult classic. I modified my review once I went back and watched the whole thing through, It has a certain charm about it and is dripping with nostalgia. Alas, it was fashionable to use the Lord's name in vain back then too. All things considered the actors did a pretty good job especially the cutie cheerleader and Commander Chakotay. An everybody-turned-to-dust-except-some-zombies apocalypse in 1980s L.A. might just be the diversion you're looking for as long as you don't take it too seriously.

This thing was bad even for the '80s. Terrible story line (NO story line!), terrible acting, terrible cinematography and the list can go on and on and ... The only two good things we took away from this was that fortunately, we missed this in the '80s so we didn't have to sit through this in a theater or waste the money walking out on this. The other good thing was seeing downtown L.A. before massive development ruined what ambiance downtown still had to offer.

It would seem that quite a few favorable 4 and 5 Star reviews for this silly disaster were born out of some unknown sense of nostalgia. Oh and there is a 3rd positive aspect to this substandard cinematographic attempt -- the rental was only $3.",1439596800,,778,4.471830985915493

The Idea of this movie is just so interesting to to me, a Comet that can kill people or turn them into something else...  People who love post apocalyptic movies will also love this, it's main focus being what would happen if two teenage girls were stranded in ""modern day"" with no one else.",1438905600,,587,4.149122807017544

This movie was very much a product of it's time.  It hasn't aged well three decades later.  Some of the humor was specific to that time and has since lost its edge.  At best, it's a quasi-zombie flick desperately lacking in zombies (if you can count their number with one hand, leaving out the dream zombies, then there really isn't enough zombies).  Of bad guys there's no lacking, from an evil stepmother, to twisted stock-boys in a department store, then blood obsessed researchers from a secret think tank out in the middle of nowhere.  The plot isn't challenging or surprising.  What this film has going for it is a lot of sentimentality from people who loved it on its initial release.  Now, so many years later, the bloom is definitely off the rose but it still holds great favor as far as nostalgia goes.  I'll always like this movie.

2728604,3,B000MDFTHE,"Movie is/was great.  It holds up really well.  The bonus features however, that's another story.  The reason I bought the blue ray was for the ""updated commentary""  with the stars.  The ""commentary"" was not a commentary at all.  There is a male voice who sounds like a public access , camp horror fan  asking a bunch of dumb questions most of which have nothing to do with the movie.  The questions that are somewhat related, aren't questions I would ask the stars.

 For example Q: What was the budget on this film?  A:  I don't know.  Q: Did you have input on your costumes?  A:  They took  me to a mall and bought them.  Q:  What did you think about filming in this old theater?  A: I don't really remember it.  and ""I wasn't there""

In my opinion, the commentary should be the involved parties watching the movie and commenting about memories, trivia , off camera stuff.  Not some guy asking a bunch of dumb questions that area not scene specific while the movie happens to play in the background.",1421193600,,1001,4.444444444444445

2728641,4,B000MDFTHE,"The director/writer understands zombie flicks well, meaning that beneath all the gore and mayhem a zombie movie should express some kind of social commentary. Most often, zombies become a symbol for some kind of intolerance. In this movie, Thom Eberhardt correctly targets defense spending and consumer culture as the two defining trends of the 80's. I guess all of us who grew up during that decade were made a little mindless by all that Top 40 music, MTV, and Morning-In-America jingoism.

Beyond the clever subtext, however, zombie aficionados will probably be disappointed by the light tone and surprising lack of gore. Catherine Mary Stewart is very strong, and film buffs might remember Robert Beltran and Mary Woronov from Paul Bartel's Eating Raoul. Kelli Maroney turns in the best performance, light comedy that is completely spontaneous, never practiced.

As a final note, NO WAY is this DVD worth more than $10. If you have to pay more for it, just rent it on Netflix instead.",1399507200,,988,5.0182926829268295

Having a gun to blow up the zombies or knowing  martial arts or using our brain to outsmart the bad guys. Girl's could not only can kick zombies behinds, ride motorcycles and shoot guns. Of course it would not be a true movie about teenage girls without most teenage females favorite thing, shopping.  Add in song Girls just want to have Fun best scenes in movie. Plus to do so without a credit card. (even today, every female would love this option).  It showed us even without our daddies or mommies we could survive what ever the world threw at us.

I love the two disc combo and the interviews with the actors, my vhs copy was wearing out. If you've seen and liked it this is a great deal, definitely add it to your collection.

There are a few nicely shot scenes that showcase how empty and alone the world has become.  The acting is much better than most old B or C horror movies, but the plot is dull and much is left unexplained.  Most of the movie is very slow, following the sisters around as they gab and shop and have an A-Team type of battle with a bunch of kids in two-dollar gas station sunglasses.  Apparently, after most people on Earth are turned to Tang mix, we will still have electricity and running water.  Or so the writers would have us believe.

You will laugh at the terrible writing and smile at all of the long-lost technology of that era.  No cell phones!  Other than that, there's no value to this film.  My suggestion is that you keep the version of this movie you have in your memories.  Trust me.  Your memory is ten times better than the real thing.",1395014400,,1023,4.349206349206349

I turned my daughter on to this movie and she loved it too, but what's not to love? Two valley girl sisters who save the world from zombie like comet mutants and whacked out scientists.

2728668,4,B000MDFTHE,"Scream Factory brings middle-aged horror fans another piece of their childhood on Blu-ray with the release of the ""Night of the Comet"" Collector's Edition. Here's another perfect example of a movie I grew up on and spent many summer days watching while on vacation at my father's house. A combination of ""Night of the Living Dead,"" ""The Omega Man,"" and ""Valley Girl"" makes this quirky film an essential addition to any fan's 1980's genre collection.

Everyone is celebrating the return of a comet that hasn't buzzed by the Earth in 65 million years. The last time it swung by, the dinosaurs went extinct. How can it come as a surprise that this time around it incinerates humans and leaves survivors mutated and ravenous for human flesh? Two Los Angeles valley girls (Catherine Mary Stewart and Kelli Maroney) join forces with a truck driver (Robert Beltran) as they run for their lives from the walking dead and scientists intent on draining their blood in an attempt to find a cure for the zombie outbreak.

""Night of the Comet"" perfectly captures the tone of the 1980s in every way. The feeling of paranoia about the world coming to an end is one element. I remember reading about the planets aligning and how this could cause the apocalypse. It seems like every day the papers or television would feature stories about impending nuclear Armageddon.

It was a scary time for kids and the fact that two valley girls in a big city like L.A. could survive gave many a teenager hope they could as well. In what other time period besides the 1980s would we see two high school girls raid a shopping mall and try on clothes while listening to ""Girls Just Wanna Have Fun"" on a jam box. Keep in mind, this is right after discovering the world had come to an end? However, the best part comes when they wield semi-automatic rifles dressed to the nines against mutated delivery boys. These are just a few of the reasons why ""Night of the Comet"" is such a charming part of horror cinema history.

On top of all that, we also get the usual ""Don't Trust the Older Generation"" message. There's nothing adolescents distrust and hate more than authority figures telling them what to do. ""Night of the Comet's"" examples of these suspicious characters come in the form of a group of scientists willing to kill survivors in search of an antidote for themselves.

The film is rated PG-13 for violence, language, adult situations, and gore. ""Night of the Comet"" is tame in comparison to most zombie and horror films. This is the type of movie designed for the masses. You could watch it with people who don't frequently watch scary movies. It's perfect for helping get lightweights into the Halloween spirit without completely freaking them out.

The ""Night of the Comet"" Collector's Edition gives consumers exactly what they want when it comes to bonus material. Audio commentary is provided by actors Kelli Maroney, Catherine Mary Stewart, Mary Woronov, Director/Writer Thom Eberhardt, and Production Designer John Muto. There are new interviews with Catherine Mary Stewart, Kelli Maroney, Robert Beltran, and Special Make-up Effects creator David B. Miller. It also contains a film photo gallery, behind-the-scenes photo gallery, and a theatrical trailer.

The high-definition transfer of ""Night of the Comet"" is exactly what most will want and expect. It's a cleaner and better picture, but doesn't lose the grainy feel we all love when we watch 1980's flicks. It's presented in 1080p High-Definition Widescreen (1.78:1) and DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1/Mono. The movie's boisterous blend of pop music, gunshots, and growling zombies have never sounded better.

The ""Night of the Comet"" Collector's Edition is another fine example of the respect Scream Factory has for cult classics that might not see the light of day on Blu-ray because of a niche audience. Once again, they go above and beyond by providing fans with special features that give us an insight into the making of the movie and the impact it's had on audiences. Hopefully, it will also give new people the opportunity to see it for the first time. Great new ""vintage-style"" cover art for the release is the icing on the cake.",1381536000,,4171,4.88135593220339

2728670,5,B000MDFTHE,This is one of my all-time favorite campy movies. I was really happy to find it in DVD format and it was a definite blast from the past. From the Valley Girls to the Think Tank Scientists to the Zombies it is truly entertaining.,1380153600,,228,4.204545454545454
2728671,4,B000MDFTHE,"4 stars = Classic

Here is a sci-fi/zombie film that screams the 80's! Which is not a bad thing, because a lot of good to great genre bending films popped up in that decade. A lot of fun, because ""Night of The Comet"" does not take it's self seriously. This is what I'd call a classic drive-in B movie back in the day.

2728672,5,B000MDFTHE,"I missed this back in the day.  It's a shame.  This is one of the best classic kitsch films of that most incredible decade!  Two sisters, played by Catherine Mary Stewart and Kelly Maroney, manage to survive the return of the comet that extincted the dinosaurs.  Most of humanity is obliterated, zombie mutants prowl the streets and the scarce few survivors fight to stay that way.  A scientific think-tank who knew the truth about the comet and hid themselves underground, finds they are sickened and turning into zombies because someone forgot to shut off the ventilation system before the comet arrived.  They are working to develop a serum from survivors' blood that will keep them alive, but they must have survivors first!

The 80's fashions are awesome - fantasies play out as the sisters go shopping in an empty mall without their credit cards - and they bicker over the last non-zombie man left in L.A. and possibly the world!  Need I say, I highly recommend!!  :)",1378857600,,973,4.778443113772455
2728673,3,B000MDFTHE,"This story requires no thinking whatsoever and makes fun of itself at every turn.  Two spunky sisters find themselves among the last humans on earth.  Of course there are zombies and an evil underground government fortress collecting survivors to take their blood and cure themselves.  There is even a mall dress up montage followed by a shootout.  Like ""Omega Man"" it lets you laugh in all the wrong places.",1378771200,,408,4.869565217391305
2728674,3,B000MDFTHE,"It's the first comet to buzz the planet in 65 million years, and everyone seems to be celebrating its imminent arrival! Everyone, that is, except for Regina Belmont (Catherine Mary Stewart), and her younger sister Samantha (Kelli Maroney), two valley gals who care more about meteoric fashion trends than celestial phenomena. But upon daybreak, when the girls discover that they're the only residents of Los Angeles whom the comet hasn't disintegrated or turned into a zombie, they go shopping! But when their day of malling threatens to become a day of the mauling, these two valley girls flee with both killer zombies and blood-seeking scientists in hot pursuit.

This 1984 comedy-horror was a hit when released and has maintained an impressive fan base over the decades who are being treated to a 2-disc Blu-ray/DVD combo. Night of the Comet is about two Los Angeles girls battling zombies after a comet wipes out most of life on Earth. The plot is similar to The Omega Man/I Am Legend. Night of the Comet was written and directed by Thom Eberhardt. Everything from sci-fi, horror, comedy, romance and of course a few zombies is found here. Modern audiences should appreciate it is full of 1980's clothes, music, dialogue, themes and it is a definite period piece for those who love the era of excess. If you haven't seen the film and didn't grow up in the '80s you may want to check out Shaun of the Dead instead.

This 2-disc (BD/DVD combo) sports average picture quality but the audio quality is a little better. There is 38 minutes of total bonus content (but the back of the package indicates a new interview with Mary Woronov which is not actually included). Fans will appreciate this version is an upgrade from previous releases.

2728675,5,B000MDFTHE,"Night of the Comet is classic 80's B-movie fun. Funny, scary and atmospheric, it's a great movie that, despite its low budget, gives off a nice creepy ambience. I've been wanting Shout!/Scream Factory to put this out and it seems they're actually listening to fans. I've bought more of their releases than any other company and that's because they actually put in the work to make sure you get your money's worth.

Catherine Mary Stewart (Regina) & Kelli Maroney (Samantha)fall right in line behind Heather Langencamp from A Nightmare On Elm Street as strong kick ass leading woman who you fall in love with.

Two sisters hate their money-grubbing step-mom who is having a Comet Party that neither attend.  Both awake the next day and find each other, only to discover they appear to be only non-zombies from the passing comet.

What do girls do with unlimited time and no money needed?  Well, don't want to spoil the movie - HA!!

So many of the ""horror"" films during this time were the slash-em soft porn kind.  This one was refreshing as it actually had a beginning, middle and an end.  Regina, the older sister takes her responsibilities seriously while Julie the younger just wants to have some fun.  When I purchased this recently, I thought it would be too dated.  While the haircuts and language are definitely 80s, the story itself and the action was not.

2728701,3,B000MDFTHE,"A passing comet has turned most of the world to ash... Everyone, that is, except for two Valley Girls and a handful of freaked-out zombies that have been set loose in downtown Los Angeles! Write/Director Thom Eberhardt mixes THE OMEGA MAN and DAWN OF THE DEAD with trendy teen comedies like VALLEY GIRL from the early 80's to give us NIGHT OF THE COMET, the campy cult-classic from 1984. At the end of the world, our airheaded heroines are more concerned with doing some free shopping and fighting over the last boy on Earth than grieving over the rest of humanity. Luckily for them, Daddy taught them how to shoot a machine gun, so they can casually blast away any of the undead that happen to get in the way of their good time. Eberhardt cleverly parodies the youth culture of the time using both wit and satire, which are brought out splendidly in the performances by Catherine Mary Stewart and Kelli Maroney. These two play up the ridiculousness of their characters' speech and actions while still creating a believable pair of self-absorbed sisters. Eberhardt succeeds most in delivering his vision of a post-apocalyptic Los Angeles on a budget. The use of red filters to produce a hazy radioactive fallout over the empty city streets produces a convincing overall effect. Add to that a final note of distrust in the military machine, and you have yourself a mini-Romero for a new age.

A comet gets too close to Earth and disintegrates everyone. Okay, well almost everyone. People partially exposed were turned into zombies. Two teenage sisters, left as some of the very few survivors, make the apocalypse look fun: playing arcade games, acting as radio DJ, shooting fully automatic weapons, killing a few zombies, and free shopping sprees at the mall.

2728708,4,B000MDFTHE,"""Night of the Comet"" is a classic 1980's ""tongue in cheek"" horror movie that is still quite enjoyable. This isn't likely to appeal to everyone, but it is worth watching if you are a fan of zombie movies.

No plot spoilers from me: The movie centers on an 18 year old survivor of a zombie outbreak. The plot is fairly weak, the acting is passable, and the special effects are not very good, but it all works together better than it should. It is almost worth watching the movie to see the '80s hair.

This is one of the movies that I showed my teens since it has become part of pop-culture and is referenced in other movies and TV shows.

Recommended!

As a longtime zombie post-apocalyptic junkie I rented it on VHS the first chance I got. I have watched it at least a dozen times since.

Let's put it this way, you've got zombies, a cheerleader, some Uzis, a shopping mall, and evil scientists-- what could be more perfect?  The mall scene in the film is priceless.

2728719,4,B000MDFTHE,"When people invite you to take part in a once in a lifetime event, you just point to this movie and say NO. Why? Because saying yes can be bad. Ask two girls that lost everything that was going on in their dull lives before that moment, when one was a cheerleader and one was a theater worker. They knew they had this chance to see a comet and one had to work, one had to be ignored, and both ended up in the middle of a ""dust storm"" with everyone gone. Couple that with fringe elements in society, with people goign mad, and with keys falling at bad times and you have a classic.

A real classic.

Night of the Comet came along in the middle of this wave of movies that had The Cold War at their back and UFOs in their rearview as well. They also worked off of some things we saw coming along that worked like Maximum Overdrive tried to, pointing out how comets might not be our friends. Granted, living through it seemed to be one of those toss-ups, with the thickness of things not really playing a role. You might be in a shed or in a movie projector or a million other things. Or you might just be half protected and, as such, you might just be a mutant. Still, that was the beauty of it all.

Along with the Dawn of the Dead look through the science scope was beautiful, as was the mall moment. The girls there, along with the guys, looking at stuff and then getting attacked was priceless. Also priceless was the videogame score and the way it led to the outcome that came along, not to mention the radio tower and the way that set up. It had the ""humans are our enemies"" calling card as well as the comet is our downfall calling card.

I will not say that you will love this because it is a budget movie and it was made in the middle of the 80s. Someone might not get it - rightfully so depending on when you were born - and you might not like it. Still, it is a classic like Night of the Creeps and, in a lot of ways, it deserves 5/5 love. i am not going to give it that because that is just me being me and loving it. I am rounding it to 4/5, however, loving it that way. The violence is not horrible, the blood is barely there, and yet it is a movie you recall.

Since the movie is lower quality, the DVD is also lower quality. It is grainy and it is not such a nice sound experience, but it surviving is a plus in and of itself. I wish I could say there were better ones around but this, combined with the fact that it has no real extras, is what you get. Still, DVDs should be judged by the movie and not what directors cram into them.

2728726,4,B000MDFTHE,"For reasons unknown, two valley girls survive a blast from an impending comet only to find the world they know has been transformed overnight into a post-apocalyptic zombie-infested wasteland. Together, the two hook up with a wholesome trucker, fight off the living dead, go on a shopping spree to the tune of Cyndi Lauper's ""Girls Just Wanna Have Fun"" all while evading who else but a band of evil scientists.

""Dawn of the Dead"" it sure isn't, but those seeking a brilliantly cheesy zombie romp (which incidentally doesn't feature many zombies) will find much to rave about with ""Night of the Comet."" Director Thom Eberhardt apparently didn't take things seriously enough to turn in an effective or particularly scary film, but instead, focuses on lampooning the b-movies it so closely resembles. With tongue planted firmly in cheek (or so it would seem) the director guides the cast through silly scenario after silly scenario with little regard to logic. That's not to say the film is stupid, though; on the contrary, it's quite witty in its extreme characterizations and hammy dialog. It also helps the film's credibility to have two leads in Catherine Mary Stewart and Kelli Maroney, who, in spite of being too old to play teenagers, carry the film with a bubbly sensibility that suits the material at hand perfectly.

Sure, there's not much in the way of blood or even sense (Red dust? Zombies? Which is it?) but beneath the tacky clothing, dated soundtrack and cheesy special effects is a fun little b-movie that knows its a b-movie. There's no social commentary to be found amidst the silliness, and that's a good thing. The film plays like an arcade game come to life and should be treated as such. Spend a night with ""Night of the Comet"" and you'll be guaranteed a delightfully schlocky good time.",1278374400,,1808,4.866883116883117
2728727,4,B000MDFTHE,"It is best to approach this film with a light-hearted, just-for-the-fun-of-it, perspective; it has a little bit of almost everything a sci-fi sampler should have. We learn about two sisters whose military dad is away and live with a step-mother who leaves a lot to be desired. The dad, fortunately, has taught the older sister the use of automatic weapons; this will come in handy later.

The rocky relationship with the step-mother is inturrepted by the events involved in the return of a comet which changes the world forever. Their determination and resourcefulness eventually carry them through many perils from zombies to evil scientists and enable them to triumph over all the obstacles they encounter.

The movie is a fun romp through the assorted perils one has encountered in other sci-fi flicks and does so with the added benefit of two pretty girls.

The same year this film was released, 1984, Catherine Mary Stewart had a smaller part as the girlfriend of a young man who was destined to become ""The Last Starfighter."" If you enjoy watching Catherine you'll want to see her in this one as well.

In summary the back of the DVD quoting ""Variety"" sums it up best; a ""Tongue-in-cheedk pastiche of numerous science fiction films.""",1272585600,,1239,4.913875598086125

2728733,5,B000MDFTHE,"An L.A. cheerleader and her tough but sexy movie theater usher big-sister think they may be the last survivors on Earth after the comet that devastated the dinosaurs makes its return fly-by. It seems that most everyone turned out to witness the comet, and those unlucky folks were reduced to a pile of red dust. Those who stayed indoors are now dangerous, zombie-like creatures decomposing at a slower rate. But, those few that were, by chance or design, protected by walls of steel, like our two heroines, have inherited the burden of the future of civilization. It isn't all that long before they find one more survivor, young truck driver Hector, but everyone else they encounter seems to be highly hazardous to their health, including a group of rowdy boys at the mall led by a guy who seems to have inspired Mark Hamill's take on the Joker!

Starring The Last Starfighter's Catherine Mary Stewart as the gun and videogame loving theater usher Regina and Fast Times at Ridgemont High's Kelli Maroney as her cheerleading Valley-girl little sister, Samantha, ""Night of the Comet"" is a survival horror/sci-fi spoof from 1984 that is sure to be an instant favorite for any fans of the genre. Don't get the wrong idea though. While there is humor, this film plays out as a serious story, much like 2004's wonderful Shaun of the Dead. And to my fellow Romero fans, don't get the idea this is pure zombie horror. The zombie-like creatures here are important, but we don't see hordes of them or anything like that. More important and frequent threats in Night of the Comet are those folks who are turning. There are some good scares, by the way, though they are few enough that one should go into this more for the post-apocalyptic adventure theme than anything else. Primarily, this movie is just loads of fun by having just the right amount of everything it serves up! The cast is great, and the stars are definitely the two leading ladies. Neither is my dreamgirl type, but between Catherine Mary Stewart's Emma Watson-lookalike head and Kelli Maroney's fantastic body, you've got enough to keep me watching with a smile on my face. Robert Beltran is the male hero of the film as Hector of the barrio (you'll get that one after seeing the film), and one simply must mention the great Geoffrey Lewis as the leader of a group of government scientists with nefarious plans for our beloved girls and Mary Woronov as the one scientist keeping control. Incidentally, also check out Mary in the hilarious and underrated ""Looney Tunes: Back in Action"" opposite Steve Martin at his best!

My sincere thanks to the presumably underappreciated writer and director of ""Night of the Comet"", Thom Eberhardt, for providing one of the most enjoyable films ever. If you're interested in ""Night of the Comet"", I recommend picking it up right away, before it gets any harder to find! This film is a must for your home DVD library! Sadly, it's totally barebones, but the film alone, thankfully presented in widescreen, is more than worthy of the currently, usually very affordable price!",1242518400,,3066,4.815939278937382

2728741,3,B000MDFTHE,"I remember watching this film as a pre-teen when it first came out. I'll admit the main draw at the time for me was watching Kelli Maroney run around in that sexy cheerleader outfit. Other than that, and the fact that people are turned into red dust because of the comet, very little memory remained of the film itself.
Watching the flick 20 years later, I was surprised at what an inventive story ""Night of the Comet"" is based on. Without giving away any spoilers, the basic tale is of two sisters who survive the passing of a comet, maybe the same comet responsible for wiping out the dinosaurs years ago. The comet seems to have turned most folks into piles of red dust, and others into zombie-like flesh eaters.
The special effects aren't bad for a 1980's B-movie either. The deserted city landscape is as effective as the recent Will Smith ""I Am Legend"", probably at 1/4th the cost. There really isn't any gore to speak of, but the zombie effects were also pretty decent.
The cast seems to have been pulled from the who's who of Soap Opera's of the day. But they do a good job, and as a Star Trek fan it's fun to see a young Chakotay (Robert Beltran) as the knight in shining denim role.
But make no mistake, this is pure cheese. If you are looking for genuine scares, look elsewhere. This is a fun slice of Reagan era sci-fi along the lines of ""Damnation Alley"" or ""Steel Dawn"". But I think the film makers realized that they weren't making a Shakespearian Drama here, I mean there is goofy 80's montage thrown in the middle of thing where the girls go shopping to a cover version of ""Girls Just Wanna Have Fun""!!
So if you are in the mood for some goofy fun, heroins sporting big hair and leg warmers, then pop a big old bowl of popcorn and enjoy ""Night of the Comet"".",1228089600,,1775,4.365558912386707

2728745,4,B000MDFTHE,"NIGHT OF THE COMET is a cutesy, '80s take on the apocalyptic / zombie story. Two sisters, Regina (Catherine Mary Stewart) and Samantha (Kelli Maroney from Chopping Mall and Fast Times At Ridgemont High) wake up one morning to find that a comet has wiped out most of humankind. Thankfully, these pretty, suburban girls are as well skilled in martial arts as they are handy w/ automatic weaponry! This proves to be essential, since those not turned to dust by the comet have become flesh-eating zombies! Alas, the zombie population is very small, w/ only a few meandering stragglers here and there. Fans of other living dead-type epics may be disappointed by the lack of zombies and any real action. There are some stretches of dullness. However, NOTC has it's moments, and the characters are fun. I especially enjoyed the encounter at the department store between Regina, Samantha, and a group of eeevil, homicidal ex-employees! Robert Beltran (EATING RAOUL, tv's STAR TREK: VOYAGER) is the Mr. nice guy hero dude. Mary Woronov (DEATH RACE 2000, SILENT NIGHT BLOODY NIGHT, ROCK AND ROLL HIGH SCHOOL, EATING RAOUL) is at her low-key best as the only member of a scientific research team who seems to have a conscience.

Look for a young Robert Beltran, Chacotay from ""Star Trek Voyager"". They must survive till it rains so they hang out in a radio station for awhile trying to call for help.

2728748,4,B000MDFTHE,"In the past, I saw brief clips of this film on the Sci-Fi channel. I was never able to complete the film, and for some odd reason, I never saw the beginning of the film. For the longest time, I wondered what was the name of this film. Finally one day I got the name by accident before I had to leave for somewhere. Shortly after, I went on Amazon and bought the full length dvd.

Many reviews of the film indicate that the movie is a mixture of 80's pop culture with a blend from earlier apocalypse themes of the 50's. Call me blind or dumb, but after watching the movie, I didn't see a single thing that indicated to me that it was the 80's and not a single scene reminded me of a 1950's era of end-of-the-world movies. The only thing that reminds me of the 80's would be the ""Girls Just Want to Have Fun,"" and the only thing that reminds me of the 50's would be the secret underground laboratory where scientists are more eager to save themselves than people. Unrelated to the movie, but I can't believe how old that song, ""Girls Just Want to Have Fun"" is. Over 20 years old. The sad fact about this movie is that it's now a ""classic."" The sad thing is, pretty soon us 1980s folks will be ""oldies.""

The movie starts out like most teen movies: a group of young high school girls enjoying the life and making excuses to not be with their ""lame"" parental units. Suddenly, like a bad comedy, the world ends and it seems like only two sisters, Reg and Sam, are left alive. They go out on an adventure into an unknown world talking about boys, going on a shopping spree, and unlike most girls, they know how to defend themselves when the times comes. Suddenly, that times come to where they have to defend themselves for the sake of surviving in such a brutal, new world. The sistes have to defend themselves with TNT, Mac-10s, and using clever tactics such as tossing a shoe at machine gun wielding foes. In the end, everyone walks away unharmed and they live happily in a world where no one else survives. Sounds to me like a commercial for the deadly effects of LSD.

In the end, I loved the movie for some reason. Logic would dictate that this movie flat out sucks, and should be avoided like a plague. However, something about the film sticks to you. Every time I watch it, I get a fuzzy feeling all over like I'm on a bad trip or something. Perhaps it's Sam, played by Kelli Maroney, who saved the day. Sam plays a wonderful stereotypical blond teenager who cares more about fashion than the destruction around her. I think she did wonderful in the film and she quickly drew on me. If the movie wasn't about some post- apocalypse where mutated half-dead people running around scaring the living day lights out of you, I think she would have been a fun person to hang out with.

In all, the movie was a disaster but it's really a ""love it or hate it"" type. Either you'll like it and admit it sucks, or you'll hate it and curse it's very existence.",1212364800,,2949,4.308108108108108

It is the early 1980s, and a passing comet somehow kills most of the population of Earth, and infects most who survive (turning them to ""zombies"").

Pros:

1980s nostalgia
guns
quirky characters

Cons:
cheese

Two parts caught my attention early on - one is where the boy working at the movie theatre is about to leave, puts on a leather jacket ready to go on his motorcycle, while a poster for the Wild One with Marlon Brando is in the background.  Elsewhere in the theatre are posters for such movies as Forbidden Zone.  This film is campy and it knows it.

The sense of humor is present throughout, perhaps the funniest are Robert Beltran's costume changes (Sant Claus and cowboy), and the kooky conclusion.  That the girls go the mall is pure homage to Dawn of the Dead.

My only gripe about this film is that the premise is so good that more could have been done with it.  The girls celebrate their newfound freedom by going to a mall instead of mourning the loss of all their friends and family.  Instead of entirely letting the film run with that premise, there is a lot of time spent wondering what's going on and all too few glimpses of the zombie like creatures.  Still, there's enough in here to grant a few chuckles.",1190505600,,1179,4.371559633027523

Thom Eberhardt crafted a great film, and I'm thrilled that it's finally released on DVD. Unfortunately, there are no extras. It's creepy, unsettling and no end of entertaining.

This type of production is bullcr#p; especially after all of the time I have waited for this!!!

Take for instance `Aqua Teen Colon Movie', that movie bites so hard and yet, it has a massively cool cover and it's TWO discs!!! I don't even have the season sets of Aqua Teen and I'm tempted to buy this movie just so I can see the DVD in my grubby hands. I am so very TIRED of this junk.

Otherwise, keep the freakin' movie in obscurity where it freakin' belongs!!! You idiots!

And one more thing...leave your stupid freakin' distributor logo on the spine of the DVD art where it f'n belongs. Nobody wants to see that crud on every one of the DVD's in their collection. You guys are so stupid and you would think that being in business as long as you have, you'd know something about marketing to a specific demographic by now. At least you didn't slap some idiotic `special unrated extra comety edition' on the cover and a review by some obscure website praising the films nostalgic flavor or the usual garbage. GOD! I hate huge companies that have no respect for marketing. I mean, you could sell a million really really bad movies with just the minimalist of efforts towards your products packaging. You losers!

Anyway, the two stars are for the movie actually being released on DVD after a gazillion years and the negative three stars is for your half baked attempt at packaging this so that it would sell.

2728772,4,B000MDFTHE,"A signifcant cult hit when released in late 1984, NIGHT OF THE COMET is an admittedly cheesy film even by the standards of low-budget offerings, and dated as well; given the time in which it was made, it screams ""Eighties!""  But it still somehow comes off as a completely fascinating oddity, combining tongue-in-cheek 80s comedy with science fiction and horror.

The premise is a fairly simple one: A large comet (contrary to what some reviews have said, this comet does not have a name attached to it) makes an uncomfortably close encounter with our planet while millions have come out this night to watch its arrival.  But the following morning, two Valley Girls (Catherine Mary Stewart; Kelli Maroney) come out, and realize, albeit slowly, that everyone and everything around them has literally turned to dust; and if they haven't turned to dust, they've either gone psychotic or turned into zombies.  The City of Angels is now a veritable ghost town.  And along with an Hispanic trucker (Robert Beltran), they soon find themselves at the mercy of mad scientists searching for a vaccine from the comet dust that killed or zombified everyone else.

Provocative title aside, nobody is going to mistake NIGHT OF THE COMET for such similar films as DEEP IMPACT, METEOR, or the hyped-up ARMAGEDDON by any means; the dialogue has so much in the way of Valley Girl lingo that there's no mistaking its era.  These flaws aside, however, writer/director Thom Eberhardt manages to make the most of a parlous budget.  Apart from the slightly lame dialogue and comedy, NIGHT OF THE COMET has a lot in common with the 1971 sci-fi thriller THE OMEGA MAN (scenes of a deserted Los Angeles), and its source material, Richard Matheson's classic 1954 book ""I Am Legend""; and Eberhardt's decision to use orange filters to create an L.A. skyline shrouded by comet dust has echoes of an early Steven Spielberg TV project, 1971's L.A. 2017.

Quite campy by today's standards and a product of its time, NIGHT OF THE COMET nevertheless remains very watchable in ways that many other films like it with budgets one hundred times bigger aren't.  It is a midnight cult item that should be seen to be believed.",1183420800,,2184,4.862533692722372

Well they should've worried, as we soon find out in this OmegaMan-knockoff.

I believe the people that rated this movie past 2 stars are promotional stand-ins for Hollywood. Either that or they've been watching some pretty whacked out flicks.  Speaking of Hollywood-Hollywood this would be a lovely little movie to re-make. I would hope that you don't do much worse than the original like the Hollywood remake for ""Black Christmas""-an atrocity.  But to prevent another remake catastrophe, Hollywood, please grab either Sam Raimi, Quentin Tarantino, John Carpenter or even Steven Spielberg before attempting a remake of this film.  This why I am so NOT liking this film: I asked myself: why the ""Star Wars"" intro? Boring. Why the banter between snobby mom and snobby child? Boring. Why the movie theater and radio station scene?  Nothing really happens. Boring. Then it hit me these scenes are just space fillers.  The only thing worth watching is the 3 or 4 zombies that debut in the film and the no-nonsense, woman scientist, Audrey. She's lethal like her shot.  This movie is absolutely afraid to be horror.  Horror to the point where Ms. Cheerhead gets ""done-in"" for real by Audrey. Horror like poppin' the zombie kid in the noggin-just for kicks.  Or horror, like the zombie kid eats Mr. Knight in Shinning Armor.  Horror like RUN Ms. Cheerhead over at the end-I mean get real she asked for it by running out in the streets challenging Fate at its best!  These are just some improvement horror suggestions.  I mean come on in a real-life event one of them would die if not all, in their case, but no everyone stays alive.  And with no surprise, the ending is too ""happily ever after.""  Horror should never be happily ever after unless there is a grotesquely sarcastic twist i.e, the ending of John Carpenter's ""Village of the Damned"" and ""The Thing."" Or the ending of Robert Rodriguez's ""Death Proof"" (Note:  SHAME on you movie watchers who did not understand ""Grindhouse"").  Now those are some endings that leave you thinking.  This movie is probably best served to newly found horror fans or some Halloweeners on October 31st.  Sorry folks, I have to be honest.  This movie really ain't worth a nickel, until the remake.  That is if there is one and if Hollywood doesn't F&$K that up. I'm selling my copy of ""Night of the Comet."" Anyone want to buy? Sorry no ""nickel discounts"".",1182038400,,2475,4.778823529411765

 i don't want to spoil the movie by giving it away. if you have the time and want to enjoy your time watching a movie this is one to see. i recently bought the movie when it came out on dvd. was worth every penny they charged me.

 i was asked to review it for people so here i am writing another review. you might recongnize some of the people in the movie. Catherine Mary Stewart from ""LAST STARFIGHTER"". even her sister did a movie called ""Chopping Mall"", i'm not sure what else she's done.

 was also shocked to see ""ROBERT BELTRAN""!!! i'd not seen it in many years i guess. which in itself is sad because it deserves a viewing every now and again. i'd not seen it in about 10 years or more. for those of you not ""STAR TREK"" fans you might remember him as ""CHOKOTAY"" from ""STAR TREK-VOYAGER""...

  there are also a few supporting cast members you might recognize i'll not give them away. that way you can have fun finding them out for yourselfs. going to imbd.com you can find out what else they have been in... enjoy!!

2728788,5,B000MDFTHE,"Night of the Comet is quite possibly the most entertaining horror film I have ever laid my eyes on. Of course, by entertaining I mean good for laughs and ridiculous fun.

If you haven't seen this movie (or in some sad cases haven't heard of it), do yourself a favor and take the opportunity to get your hands on this little gem. What the DVD lacks (no special features whatsoever, soundmix is only 2.0 stereo), the movie makes up for ten-fold. With a beautiful 1.85:1 widescreen, remastered transfer, Night of the Comet is finally given the due it deserves.

Night of the Comet starts off with a lot of fun and excitement as the 80s welcomes the return of a comet not seen in millions of years. But the next day, all have disappeared and only few (VERY few) are left on Earth. While some of those few desperately search for answers to this strange phenomenon, others have undergone a very frightening change.

Catherine Mary Stewart, Kelli Maroney, and Robert Beltran carry this movie so well and with such great comfort that you'll want to watch this over and over again. While the movie is no oscar-winner, the lines have that great ""80s feel"" to them, and the styles are a solid reminder of what is long-gone (thankfully).

The best part about this movie, aside from the entertaining jokes and fun, is that the story is really pretty solid! This easily could've been a nightmarish, apocalyptic horror film because of its smart story and passable sci-fi ideas.

I highly recommend Night of the Comet for its fantastic rewatchability factor. The laughs (and even a few scares!) never get old!",1176163200,,1593,4.695340501792114

It's intentionally cheesy. It's funny. It's satirical of this genre. It's entertaining, and the whole ""Valley Girl"" thing is so 80s.

2728801,3,B000MDFTHE,"Night of the Comet reeks of the 80's, from it's costumes to it's style.  Despite it's utter cheesy ludeness though, Night of the Comet manages to be enjoyable and fun for the most part, never taking itself too seriously in the process.  Coming from an era where ""end of the world"" type films were popping up all over the place, Night of the Comet centers around two valley girl sisters (Catherine Mary Stewart and Kelli Maroney) who awaken the day after a big time comet event to find that they are the only ones who haven't been turned to dust.  They meet up with another survivor (Star Trek: Voyager's Robert Beltran) and are soon on the run from semi-zombified beasts.  Night of the Comet is a fun blast for most of it's running time, but it quickly loses steam during the final acts of the film when government agents come into the picture.  Despite that though, Night of the Comet is a fun ride while it lasts, and if you recall this fun B-movie, it's worth another look.",1174521600,,976,4.46067415730337
2728802,3,B000MDFTHE,"Night of the Comet took advantage of the return of Halley's Comet hype which ran through nation and pretty much most of the world throughout most of 1984 and into 1985. Hollywood being the opportunist industry that it was and still is were quick to produce and release a movie about the return of Halley's Comet over the planet as soon as possible. The 1980's was a good decade for the low to mid-budgeted horror and sci-fi movies which had a quick death at the box-office but which gained success and cult status in the many displays racks of the tens of thousands of video rental places. 1984's Night of the Comet was one of these films and it typifies the cheesiness that was 1980's scifi horror.

The film opens up with everyone partying the arrival of Halley's Comet which could be seen in the night sky every 75-76 years. People are out on the streets as night falls celebrating the Comet's arrival and we meet two of the main characters in the film in the form of Regina and Samantha. Two sisters who truly epitomizes the mall and valley culture of 1980's Southern California, Regina and Samantha are not enjoying the night of the comet as Regina ends up working the night shift at the local theater she works at and Samantha is stuck at home with her stepmother and all the partygoers attending her stepmom's party. In the span of a few sequences both Regina and Samantha end up locking themselves up somewhere quiet and safe to get away from the party going on around them.

While they stew in their own little hideaways the comet makes its pass over the planet with everyone who can see looking up to take a peek of the returning comet. What happens next sets up the rest of the movie. The comet seem to have turned anyone not protected behind heavy steel structures into red dust and those only half-protected end up turning into zombie-like creatures. Luckily for the two sisters they were inside such heavy steel structures when the comet did its pass over and well-protected. The rest of the movie deals with Regina and Samantha dealing with the possibility that they may be the last people on the planet (though this soon get shotdown with the arrival of Captain Chakotay of Star Trek Voyager...I mean Robert Beltran) and trying to keep themselves from being eaten by the zombie survivors and being tested upon by shady, secret government scientists.

Night of the Comet won't win any awards even from horror and science-fiction groups, but it will entertain to a point. For those who grew up during the 80's the movie will bring back fond, if painful memories of just how cheesy that decade was in terms of pop culture. Catherine Mary Stewart as Regina would be seen in more cheesy horror flicks of the era. In fact, she pretty much became the PG-13 version of 80's Scream Queen Linnea Quigley. Where Ms. Quigley wasn't against gratuitious nudity and sex in the movies she was in, Ms. Stewart was very chaste and very girl next door in her roles.

Would I recommend this movie to people? Yes, I would but buying the dvd may be more for the hardcore horror and scifi completist since one can easily see Night of the Comet on regular and cable TV. In the end, the movie is a fun romp back through time to a weird and different era. The movie is not great, but it's not bad either.",1174521600,,3294,4.540404040404041

2728811,4,B000MDFTHE,"Imagine Jeff Spicoli and the gang from ""Fast Times at Ridgemont High"" mixed with the old zombie/plague movie ""The Last Man on Earth"" starring Vincent Price and you have ""Night of the Comet"". Part of what makes this movie worth watching today is intentional, part of it isn't. The intentional part of what makes it worthwhile is that this movie knows it's pure cheese and isn't afraid to have some fun with the scenario. It knows it's ""Airplane"", not ""Airport"". The good part that wasn't intentional is the nostalgia. The 80's fashions, the big hair, the collars, the rolled-up coat sleeves, they're all here. Plus, there's all the 80's music when our heroines are camping out at the automated radio station. It's a perfect little time capsule of 80's pop culture. Of course, if you're too young to remember the 80's, then this part won't be as much fun for you as those of us who remember this movie in its first run. One other thing worth mentioning about this movie. It is unique in that it predates ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" by eight years as a horror film in which the teenage girls aren't just eye candy sitting around huddled in terror waiting to be devoured or chopped to bits by the villain. Instead, Regina (Catherine Mary Stewart) decides to use her wits plus the weapons training her dad gave her before he ran off to Central America and fight for her survival. If you remember this movie, you know it's worth seeing a second time. If you're too young to remember, I strongly advise that you check it out anyway.",1173052800,,1524,4.606617647058823

2728815,4,B000MDFTHE,"""Night of the Comet"" is one of the better entries in the 'end of the world' sub-genre and one of 1984's most memorable films. If you judge these things solely on the basis of how effectively they connect with a viewer watching it alone, then the film would be worthy of a 10; you quickly get sucked into the story and have no problems identifying with the three sympathetic characters.

Although not exactly high-budget, the production design is very professional and the outdoor shots quite effective (they really do creep you out-at least if you get into the story). Unlike similar films from this the era like ""Eating Raoul"" and ""Terror Vision"" (both also featured Mary Woronov), ""Night of the Comet"" is played relatively straight for its first hour, with no major self- parody elements working against the viewer identification process.

Catherine Mary Stewart and Kelli Maroney play two sisters who wakeup the morning after a major comet event to find themselves alone in Los Angeles. Everyone who viewed the comet was turned into dust. This type of thing has been done before (""The Day of the Triffids"" and ""Five"" for example) but never before has it featured armed and dangerous Valley Girls (Frank Zappa's daughter had just released a song that made the nation aware of that strange phenomenon). Stewart is fine as a character which Linda Hamilton pretty much appropriated for the second ""Terminator"" movie;  but Maroney really steals the whole film-running around in her Pep Squad uniform and shifting back and forth between airhead and vulnerable (but weapons trained) little sister.

Although the first two thirds are excellent, ""Night of the Comet"" stumbles badly with the introduction of a big government research facility that hopes to use the girls for experimental purposes. The wheels pretty much fall off at this point and since the plot has nowhere interesting to go they have to play the self-parody card at the end. But if you are prepared for a somewhat disappointing final 30 minutes, you should find ""Night of the Comet"" a very entertaining film.

2728816,4,B000MDFTHE,"Okay..So I admit I went to see this at the theater because I had seen Catherine Mary Stewart in ""The Last Starfighter"" and I had a crush on her(Okay..So I admit I still do!) Anyway, this is a very cool movie! Just the right amount of seriousness,humor,gore,action and romance a good Sci-Fi movie needs with not one but two babes that are very easy on the eyes! I highly recommend this flick! When I saw the empty streets in the city scenes in ""Vanilla Sky"" I immediatedly thought of this movie. Very surreal! Catherine Mary Stewart is in another one of my favorite movies of all time ""Mischief""  A great late 50's early 60's era film about a cool guy who moves into town and teaches a somewhat average kid how to be cool! For the girls it's got loveable Doug McKeon and 80's hearthrob Chris Nash For the guys besides adorable CMS it has a young Kelly Preston...And guys were talking a full frontal nudity scene! Also look for a small part by babe Jamie Gertz as a nerdy student. This one with all the teen agnst and seriously funny comedy is a real keeper! Thank God they released this on DVD!",1170806400,,1093,4.384236453201971

2728818,4,B000MDFTHE,"Fortunately, you can't judge a book (or DVD) by its cover.  As others have said, the cover of this (March 2007) DVD release seems to have been put together by someone who doesn't know what the movie is about.  Personally, I liked the understated cover and poster of both of the earlier VHS versions (Goodtimes and CBS/Fox).

The content is the important thing, though, and if rumors are true this will be a widescreen release.  If so, I won't complain too much about the cover art.

I disagree with others about the ""artistic"" quality of this movie.  In particular, the false-coloring effects are relatively simple but very effective.  In fact, the lighting effects in general are above average.  This was not a hastily slapped-together film, despite that it was not a production with a large budget.",1170115200,,800,4.830882352941177
2728819,4,B000MDFTHE,"A Post-Apocalyptic world where two teenage sisters pack Mac-10's, engage in shootouts with half-zombified punks in a shopping mall, and hook up with truck drivers? Gratuitous use of always-on Neon artwork in the local Radio Station?  Teenagers in cheerleader outfits getting slowly undressed?  Spooky scientists out to save their own skins by harvesting the blood of young comet holocaust survivors? ZOMBIES? MORE ZOMBIES? Chakotay from Star Trek Voyager!?!?!

This film has it all!  And the best part, it has it all and its not nearly as hokey as my description makes it sound.  Cashing in on three major themes from flicks in the early 80's: (Apocalyptic themes, the return of Halleys Comet, and Zombies) this film actually melded the three with a pretty cool story.  Sure its not Citizen Kane, but its also not direct-to-video drek either.

The acting is well done, with all of the players turning up in other 80's and 90's movies you've probably seen if you like horror/scifi flicks of the period.  Today this movie works on alot of levels...on the one hand, its a great 80's timecapsule..The talk, the fashion, the locations, music and characters.  More than a few one-liners and a bit of violence and gore with some creepyness throwin in for good measure.  Not over the top like Evil Dead II, but not an emotional beat-down like Dawn or Day of the Dead either.  A true California horror/scifi movie :)

Its also got the camp factor going for it....because, lets face it, times have changed since then. Remember when *every* girl had blown out hair? :)

Fans of the movie have come to grips with the fact that we'd never expect to see this movie ever on DVD.  It almost never makes the rounds on Cable, heck even the writer/director/whatever suggested you buy a bootleg copy as he had no idea who owned the rights anymore, if any prints still existed, etc.  What a SURPRISE!!

This leaves very few 'well remembered' horror/scifi flicks from the period still missing on DVD.  Phantasm II still needs a Region 1 release, and The Keep is still nowhere to be found.  But with NOTC finally coming out, its one less gaping hole in your 80's SciFi/Horror collection!

Heck they're even releasing LOOKER soon, another early 80's HBO/Cinemax staple that had dropped off the face of the earth.....its the apocalypse! Run..RUN FOR YOUR LIVES!!!",1168473600,,2338,4.858585858585859

2728824,5,B000MDFTHE,The fact that this film has not been released on DVD is a complete disaster but apparently there are reasons for it. This film has got to be one of the best I've seen. I hold great memories of watching it as a child in the 80s (who was also a big horror and sci fi fan). The view of a post apocalyptic USA was I thought superb and the use of people whod been partly exposed to the comet and where zombified was a really good idea. I would say that this is my favourite film of all time and one of the few that I could watch over and over. Anyone who hasn't seen it should see it.,1130803200,,579,3.8333333333333335

2728826,4,B000MDFTHE,"I first saw this movie in the 80's and enjoyed it, but nothing spectacular. Then, a curious thing happened. Some movies really impress you, but after a few viewings, they lose their appeal. Well, this is the opposite. Every time I've seen this, I like it better. As soon as it becomes available on DVD, I'm buying it!

Others have outlined the basic plot, so I won't do it again. The acting is uniformly good. The plot is, at turns both witty and scary. The writing's OK, but the actors make the show. From the leads to the minor roles, everyone does a first-rate job. Despite similar plot elements, it holds together much better than the original ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" movie.

It's an often funny show, but its humor is natural and not forced. Clever but not precious, it's the humor of everyday life,  not simply jokes inserted for their own sake. Definitely recommended!",1107043200,,878,4.651612903225806

Suffice it to say that if you like really bad movies, then this is for you. But if you like quality look elsewhere. Chacotay from Star Trek Voyager is in this, and the 2 main actresses can act, otherwise it is awful.

Well if you're Regina and Julie, two cute Valley girls, when you aren't fighting the disintegrating zombies that are the remains of humanity, you are hitting the closest Mall and picking out some sassy outfits.  (Best line in the movie, when the younger sister asks the older which outfit she should take and the sister responds, ""That one, it'll stay in style longer"")
The movie starts off with a space scene and captions that explain a huge coment is going to be making a close approach to earth.  It will put on an amazing light show....one that hadn't been seen in over 60 million years, about the time the dinosaurs disappeard.  Then it goes on to say, some people noticed this coincidence ""Then shows a bunch of people in white lab coats sealing themselved in behinde a massive underground door"" then states ""But most didn't"" and flashes to wild crowds dressed up in their finest 80's party clothes screaming and waving signs that say ""We Love the Comet""
Needless to say this movie does NOT take itself seriously and is all the better for it.  Staring some of the same actors from the classic dark comedies ""Eating Raul"" and ""Scenes from the Class Struggle in Beverly Hills"" this movie is a lightweight, goofy, comic gem well worth seeing!",1083801600,,1297,4.621739130434783
