7947784,4,B00005NSYZ,"1. Revenge of the Zombies:  I have been watching a bunch of the zombie movies from the 30's and 40's lately and I was glad to find this one on dvd.  It shares some of the same cast as King of the Zombies and is similar in many ways.  However it is set in the american south (Louisiana) and not an uncharted Caribbean Island.  Both have mad scientists working for the Nazi war effort by creating Zombies.  Pretty much what you would expect for a poverty row zombie movie from the 40's.  I enjoyed it.  The print and sound were pretty good.  I bought it used at a very reasonable price.  4 star rating takes into account the type of film we are discussing.  Not for everybody.  Just for fans of the genre.

2.  Voodoo Woman:  Not as good as Revenge of the Zombies but I found it interesting and I had never seen or heard of it before.  It is a 1950's monster movie more than a Zombie film.  The voodoo takes place in Africa with a mad scientist trying to create a female monster to do his bidding.  A she-creature if you will.  In fact it stars Marla English of She-Creature fame and the film uses the she-creature costume with a different head.",1448668800,,1143,4.2372093023255815

7947786,4,B00005NSYZ,"Well, this is a pretty run-of-the mill 1940's ""remote tropical island zombie"" flick and I like those (even though they will never be a critics' choice for anything).  One virtue of the flick is the cast.  It has one of Mantan Moreland's later roles.  Tom Conway (who had been something of a leading man such moovies as ""I Walked with a Zombie"" and played Holmes and The Falcon on radio and, later, The Saint on TV)appears relatively late in his film career. In addition, there is Bob Steele, star of many 'B' westerns of the 30's and 40's playing what was an unusual role for him.  This is just an interesting old flick.",1286323200,4,620,4.460176991150442

7947788,5,B00005NSYZ,"I had a ball watching this film -- from the moment the first zombie is ""yodeled"" from the grave, I laughed my head off. The zombies were hysterically funny, but they were skilled -- dig that expertly crafted casket they fashioned early on in the story. Heh. They could barely wield their heavy hammers, so it was a scream that it was implied they had actually built even this crude of a coffin. I love it!!!

Though there was a definite sinister intent, the comedic value of this movie can't be denied. Highly recommended for fans of bizarro horror flicks.",1227484800,4,556,4.56
7947789,2,B00005NSYZ,"Revenge of the Zombies (Steve Sekely, 1943)

I've long been a fan of the Nazi Zombie subgenre of horror films, ever since I first saw Shock Waves as a preadolescent. I had no idea, however, that a Nazi Zombie movie had been made during World War II! Prolific director Steve Sekely (who, ironically, would not go on to make a name for himself until his third-last picture, 1962's The Day of the Triffids) and screenwriters Edmond Kelso (King of the Zombies) and Van Norcross (Behind Prison Walls) worked up a story that, in today's society, would be marketed as ""ripped from the headlines!"", with a German mad scientist (John Carradine) working in the Louisiana bayou to create Nazi Zombies, an unstoppable military force that would win World War II for the Germans. Sometimes, when you get a contemporary plot like this, you generate an immediacy to the material that can't be duplicated with later work; such is not the case here. It's plodding and unscary, with all the best moments provided by comedian Mantan Moreland (Spider Baby). Note that Moreland's performance may be offensive to some of the ultra-politically-correct set (Moreland was well-known for drawing his comedy from contemporary black stereotypes, and has fallen well out of favor for it nowadays), but in a movie this boring, you can sink as low as you want and you'll still liven it up. **",1219104000,6,1360,4.862068965517241
7947790,2,B00005NSYZ,I caught this on MGM's HD channel. The film probably looked better on this station than it ever did! This was another one of those war time films just to take people's mind off of bigger more real horrors. I know it probably gave people the best nap they had in a long time. Silly and boring with the usual white eyed stereotype frightened black guy(comic relief thank you!)running around with some very non scary zombies. Poor John Carradine!.....he deserved better than this!,1203724800,2,477,4.759036144578313
