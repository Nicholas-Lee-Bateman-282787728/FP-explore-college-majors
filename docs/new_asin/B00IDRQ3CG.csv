8641327,1,B00IDRQ3CG,"The ""Remastered"" discs cut parts out! Some are subtle and barely noticeable even if you know the show fairly well. But some are just obvious that something is missing. I have no idea why they decided to shorten the episodes by cutting sections out but they did. I would buy an older version because those have the full episodes.",1522972800,,328,4.576271186440678
