If you are not used cardio workouts I suggest that you start slowly. I love how the Disco Abs does just what the name implies, works out your abs! I feel the burn in the right places. as long as you remain committed and constantly exercise you will see results.  I recommend this to any one. Love it.....",1358726400,,469,4.153846153846154
8605105,5,B00595IBNY,"I love this entire 8 DVD set, but Boogie Burn Cardio is the best I have ever used. I've been doing aerobics routines using a video/DVD for 35 years. This routine offers all the latest exercises that create strong muscles & cardio fitness. It is so much fun, I am addicted to it! Tsha Marie's form as instructor is superb. She motivates me & calms me with her voice & direction. Tsha's skills as a dancer really shine. She is the best teacher, by far. And I've seen quite a few instructors! It's been 35 years! I recommend this set so highly, I wish I could rate it more than a 5! I am so happy my husband is such a great Internet shopper. He's the one who found this DVD set. & I must say, it has changed my life. I get up every morning raring to go, I have so much energy. I am 56 years old! I look forward to the next collection Time Life Production puts out. Go push yourself to the limits. The sky is the limit!",1351814400,,915,4.032967032967033
