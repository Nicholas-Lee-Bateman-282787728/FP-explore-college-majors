5165139,4,B008HUSFO8,"I have her first two stand up dvds Allegedly and She'll Cut A Bitch along with practically every other dvds of hers I could get my hands on (My Life on the D-List seasons 1-4, Celebrity Mole: Hawaii) so I'm super excited to see this release! I've seen most of these stand up specials on Bravo so I already know they're funny and worth owning.

Everytime I saw one of these other stand-up specials I thought ""Why don't they release this on dvd?"" I love Kathy but I didn't think She'll Cut A Bitch was her best special. Allegedly was pretty hilarious.

Can't wait to own this!!",1351296000,10,575,4.364485981308412
5165140,4,B008HUSFO8,"I love kathy griffin and as a foreing guy I don't wanna miss any witty comment from this extroardinary lady.

Please please please... CC in english is a must . I wanna be able to translate to my fellow spanish friends.",1349308800,3,218,4.317073170731708
5165141,5,B008HUSFO8,"Have watched all the stand-up specials when there aired on Bravo! Very funny and always current. Love her storytelling style of comedy on everything from the Hollywood life to her sweetheart, box of wine loving, mother. Looking forward to adding these shows to my comedy DVD collection. And 7 shows all on one disc - Awesome!",1348876800,8,325,4.821428571428571
5165144,5,B008HUSFO8,"This is a wonderful addition and value for any Kathy Griffin fan. It's much better to watch all of these shows on DVD rather than on youtube. Plus, there are tons of extras. A very funny lady that brings happiness and laughter to many people. She's a genius and after you watch this body of work you will realize that not only is she the hardest working woman in comedy - but she is the best!",1439683200,,392,4.171052631578948
5165145,5,B008HUSFO8,Excellent collection in great condition.,1437782400,,40,7.2
5165146,5,B008HUSFO8,Loved every second of it .,1433808000,,26,3.5

5165148,5,B008HUSFO8,Sper funny. Great collection of kathys standups. Great special footages,1427673600,,71,6.2
5165149,5,B008HUSFO8,She is the BEST,1427155200,,15,3.0
5165150,1,B008HUSFO8,"I thought this would be funny turns out not so much.  Had only heard small snippets of Ms. Griffin before buying.  Wish I had stuck with that and saved my money.  I watched some of it, then threw it in the trash.  Enough said",1417910400,,225,4.045454545454546
5165151,4,B008HUSFO8,"Her stand up shows have definitely suffered in quality compared to her earlier ones, but Steel Balls is one of her best. Does the Bible Belt was great, too, and the others were pretty much ""hit or miss."" I think a lot of them were made just so that she could break the record. Knowing Kathy, that's probably true. But I prefer quality over quantity.",1405209600,,349,4.384615384615385
5165152,4,B008HUSFO8,"A good collection. Didn't care for her Milwaukee show. Too bad, because Im from WI, but it just wasn't that funny. The rest of the shows are pretty good though!",1404345600,,160,4.366666666666666
5165153,5,B008HUSFO8,Kathy Griffin's unique perspective on all things Hollywood and the entertainment business is always such good fun.  Contains many hours of laughs.,1399680000,,146,5.636363636363637
5165164,5,B008HUSFO8,Great collection of specials for a GREAT PRICE!  Kathy Griffin has more comedy specials than anyone else - it's been verified by Guinness Book of Records - and this dvd has 7 of them.  No censorship - full on raw like she intended but TV doesn't show. FABULOUS!,1397433600,,261,4.416666666666667
5165165,4,B008HUSFO8,You either like Kathy or you don't.  I happen to like most of her stuff and enjoyed this DVD.  Fun.,1396569600,,99,3.9
5165166,5,B008HUSFO8,This was a great compilation.  I was surprised that two of the concerts were released on a different DVD which I had purchased.,1394323200,,127,4.521739130434782
5165167,4,B008HUSFO8,Kathy is very funny but the nature of her routines can date a performance.  She may be talking about a movie star who is out of the scene in a more modern time.,1393286400,,160,3.8484848484848486
5165168,4,B008HUSFO8,Didn't know what to expect with a Kathy Griffin tape.  She talks about the events she goes to and criticizes people of course in her own way.,1392508800,,141,4.222222222222222
5165169,4,B008HUSFO8,This is some of the best performances from Kathy Griffin in the past few years! Great dvd for anyone that is a fan or give to someone that has never seen her before. It is missing some of her top shows but this is a good variety.,1391040000,,229,3.893617021276596
5165170,5,B008HUSFO8,"Contains several performances.  Kathy at her best.  These are some of her smoothest and best shows, where she stays connected with the whole audience throughout.",1388188800,,161,5.4
5165171,5,B008HUSFO8,"This box set is really the epitome of the kind of comic Kathy Griffin has become.

Kathy updates her routine constantly and you do not get the SAME SAME material all the time that you get from many other comedians.

Kathy (as far as I'm aware) writes her OWN material, unlike many in the business who have writers for them. This is a testament to her genius and comedic timing. You can tell she's done the hard yards, she's done the research, now we get to soak it all up.

Her celebrity run-in stories are always a HOOT - and wait for her Cher impression (she's buddies with Cher, hence the impressive mimic). Always fresh, always charming, always funny, the HILARIOUS Kathy Griffin is worth every penny.",1378684800,,705,4.535433070866142
5165172,5,B008HUSFO8,"I was so happy to get this collection of hers, she is my favorite! You can't miss, when you get so many of her shows in one set. She is hysterical, I can listen to her all day! Nice set! Money well spent!",1378166400,,204,3.7674418604651163
5165173,5,B008HUSFO8,She is so very funny and we love her humor.  When to see her live in Chicago and this collection is just like her (different material) hilarious !!!  If we had more money we'd purchase more of her things and go see her in person more often!!!  Love this Kathy Griffin Collection!!!,1373587200,,281,4.365384615384615
5165183,5,B008HUSFO8,Kathy's got it going on!  She's so enthusiastic about pop culture.  So what if everything she talks about is on Bravo?  They can't help it if they have the best shows on tv.,1365811200,,173,4.181818181818182
5165184,5,B008HUSFO8,"Can't beat the price for all the different shows you get with this collection. Some stand-up was better than others, but I bet you'll find them to be hilarious overall.",1365638400,,168,4.633333333333334
5165185,5,B008HUSFO8,"More of these collections need to be released. It was well worth the price to get all these specials in one package, and Kathy, of course, is great fun to listen to.",1363910400,,165,4.1875
5165186,5,B008HUSFO8,"her shows are so much better without having every word bleeped out. This collection is fantastic... there are just a few earlier ones that we're still missing.

The deleted content is hysterical.... the sets were cut because they were too explicit for television. Love them, love this, get it.",1362268800,,293,4.979591836734694
5165187,5,B008HUSFO8,I think she is so funny and enjoy her and her mother very much.  She is a really nice down to earth person.,1361145600,,107,3.652173913043478
5165188,3,B008HUSFO8,"When I saw this, I hurried to buy it. However, all it is is all the tv specials shown on tv. I really like the content: just wish there was more unshown video.",1357344000,,159,3.8484848484848486
5165189,5,B008HUSFO8,"This is a great collection of her specials.  I bought this as a gift, but have seen it myself and really enjoyed it.",1356912000,,116,4.043478260869565
5165190,5,B008HUSFO8,I LOVE MY KATHY GRIFFIN STAND UP COMEDY COLLECTION!! I LOVE HER ON BRAVO AND NOW I HAVE THE COLLECTION AND IT'S UNCENSORED!,1356307200,,123,4.391304347826087
5165191,5,B008HUSFO8,Kathy is probably one of the funniest women in the world right now. Her wry observations of celebrity culture and the sheer absurdity of what they get up to make for fabulously ribald entertainment. Never a dull moment in this DVD which is packed with  her specials plus a bunch of scenes that never aired. This is a must-have for anyone who love Kathy or needs a hearty laugh.,1353628800,4,377,4.463768115942029
5165192,5,B008HUSFO8,"This is one great collection of Kathy Griffin stand up shows. They have aged, but still amazingly funny! This girl makes me laugh so hard, my side hurts!! This two disc set is over five hours of outrageous fun from a hilarious woman. It is awesome to see these commercial free and every dirty word intact! Watching these on Bravo always took me ""out"" of the show because commercials break continuity (especially in the middle of one of Kathy's stories). But not anymore! I will cherish this set and hope Shout puts out more of her shows in a compilation like this one. Is there anyway to wear out a DVD from watching it so much?",1352764800,2,628,4.422413793103448
8528238,4,B008HUSFO8,I love this woman.  She regularly says stuff even I'm afraid to.,1504915200,,64,4.333333333333333
8528239,1,B008HUSFO8,Overrated and snarky person.,1498003200,,28,6.25

8528241,5,B008HUSFO8,Great for buying multiple copies as gifts. Kathy's haters of any kind are buffoons.,1496793600,,83,5.0

8528243,5,B008HUSFO8,Love Kathy Griffin!!! These specials are a must have for any fan,1485561600,,64,4.416666666666667
