Film = two (2) stars; costume design = five (5) stars; cinematography = five (5) stars; restoration/preservation = four (4) stars; set design = three (3) stars; score = two (2) stars.  Director Kenji Mizoguchi's small-scale, sound-stage-bound production of a Pygmalion-like legend set in the court of the Emperor of China (circa eighth century) involving a just-off-the-farm girl turned kitchen maid who is promoted by overly ambitious clan politicians to become the Emperor's favorite concubine.  This is the standard zero-to-hero plot line used in many Japanese films.  (In stark contrast to the elongated English title picked by Western distributors, there is neither a princess nor an extant empress to be seen in the movie!)  Political over reach eventually results in a ""popular"" revolt that murders the ""princess"" and almost over throws the Emperor.  The uprising consists of about 40 extras (and this is supposed to be population-heavy China)!  A mostly seasoned cast (including well-known character actress Haruko Sugimura) is allowed to deliver ho-hum/lack-luster performances across the board (although heavy-handed editing may have been a contributing factor).  Leading actress Machiko Ky is seriously miscast as the ""princess.""  She is too old for the role.  The real stars of this film are the costumes that look simply stunning in color and the small sets that initially appear rich and splendid (in color) but later seem rather drab (perhaps due to budgetary constraints?).  Cinematography (narrow-screen format, color) and lighting are very good.  Restoration failed to remove age-related noise artifacts especially during the initial third of the film.  Score is uneven and a mixed bag using apparently indigenous instruments.  It ranges from fairly pleasant multi-string lute solos to ensembles that sound like cat-strangulation orgies!  Shooting in color does not compensate for an otherwise colorless photo play!  WILLIAM FLANIGAN, PhD.",1512864000,,2091,5.5777777777777775

Spoilers ahead!

Ykihi is by some distance the least successful of Mizoguchis final films made for Daiei. It was originally the brain child of the Hong Kong outfit Shaw & sons, not as is widely said Shaw Brothers who (Tony Rayns tells us) only started after Ykihi failed. Run D. Shaw approached Nagata Masaichi with an offer to provide 30% of the financing in a joint picture deal. Nagata (the chief of Daiei and Mizoguchis long-time producer) handed it over to Mizoguchi who reluctantly took it on. The fact that it was not a personal project (Dudley Andrew states, Mizoguchi made this film against his will), that he was still recovering from an accident while doing Uwasa no Onna (1954), that he was possibly still mentally unsettled by the row with Tanaka Kinuyo, and that he was possibly starting to suffer from the leukemia that would eventually kill him two years later were all factors said to have made for a fractious shoot militating against the films success. None of these things however qualified the outstanding success of films that surround it (Chikamatsu Monogatari [1954] and Akasen Chitai [1956]), so we must look to other reasons to explain Ykihis particular short-comings. I feel two things obviously stick out. One, both Ykihi and Shin Heike Monogatari (1955) were made in colour and in both there is an over-emphasis on mise-en-scne or the way things look, at the expense of dramatic complexity as Mizoguchi explored a new visual medium learned from a recent trip to Hollywood where he studied various new laboratory colour processes. Ykihi in particular is dramatically lifeless and completely lacking in the complexity of Mizoguchis best jidaigeki work. Two, Mizoguchi the cultural aesthete got the better of Mizoguchi the sophisticated humanist as he proclaimed himself an expert on 8th century Tang Dynasty China and insisted museums and archives be ransacked for absolutely authentic props and other materials for his film. He clearly wanted his film to be as beautiful as a priceless Tang Dynasty plate and unfortunately the end product is as inert as one. The merits of Ykihi are entirely visual, and it is telling that when Shaw & sons saw it they pronounced it ridiculous and declined to release it in their theaters because Chinese audiences would only laugh. It was released in Japan to modest success, but it failed to win any awards either at home or abroad though Hayasaka Fumio did win a special award at the 1955 Mainichi Film Concours for his music both here and in past films.

The story of Ykihi is based on the famous historical tale of the celebrated Tang Dynasty beauty Yang Kuei-fei (read Ykihi in Japanese and played by Ky Machiko) who is pulled from her work as kitchen maid in the Yang household and presented to Emperor Hsan-tsung (Mori Masayuki) as a concubine because she looks like his beloved late wife. The Emperors acceptance of her leads to the rise in society of the whole Yang family as well as the ambitious Turkic general An Lu-shan (Yamamura S) who plucked her from the kitchen in the first place. He is not content with his reward and wants to climb the social ladder even higher. He turns on the now-powerful Yangs represented by Yang Kuo-chung (Ozawa Sakae) and his daughters through stirring up a popular rebellion which destroys them and pressurizes Ykihi (the last Yang) into allowing herself to be hanged to save the Emperor.

That is all there is to the story, though Mizoguchi and his screenwriters (Yoda Yoshikata, Naruwasa Masashige, Tao Jin) wrap it up as a sentimental fairy tale in three acts book-ended by a prolog and an epilog as the old Emperor reminisces back. Things hardly bode well in the prolog with the Emperor mooning over a statue of Ykihi in a hackneyed pose, the camera looking down as he looks up in bathetic supplication, for an old mans soggy reverie is exactly what we are given in the main body of the film. Best really to accentuate the positives. Shot-by-shot this film visually is never less than resplendent and Sugiyama Khei deserves some credit for his sumptuous compositions. The flashback from the Emperor mooning on starts with a dissolve, a sideways lateral track and the unpeeling of various gauzes as we go back in time and see him playing the shamisen, enjoying his own music. The effect achieved here is undeniably intriguing and captivating. The rest of Act 1 centers on this lonely sad Emperor marooned at court trapped by his own rules and rejecting all offers of a concubine, even Ykihi when she is first presented in his plum garden. Mizoguchi heightens the artificiality of the whole film. We rarely see the sky or landscapes, the camera pointing down trapping characters in obvious studio sets. The plum garden couldn't be more artificial. Perhaps Mizoguchi wanted to highlight how artificial the Emperors rule is, but I suspect he merely wanted to control to death everything that was in front of his camera. The Emperor in his palace is contrasted with the scheming Yangs and An Lu-shan as they prepare Ykihi for her presentation which only works when she attracts him by playing the same music he had played in the garden when she is later planted in his bed chamber. Her sincerity and musical ear are what eventually attracts him and this is successfully conveyed.

Act 2 portrays the Emperor and Ykihi as a happy couple. First there is a beautiful bath scene featuring a nude Ky Machiko rising from the waters (a privileged marble duck looking up at her bared posterior taking the place of Ky lovers in the audience!) and then there is a lyrical and beautifully executed street scene as she takes her shy Emperor out in disguise and they enjoy the festivities of the New Year celebrations, he taking a shamisen from a street player and accompanying Ykihi as she dances for him. The crowd sequences are handled well (as they will be in Shin Heike Monogatari), Mizoguchi giving in to simply providing colour spectacle  la Hollywood. Clunky pantomime machinations at court set in however as the dastardly An Lu-shan tries to get Ykihi to intercede on his behalf to get more power, something that she cant do according to the law. This along with all the other scenes involving the court chamberlain Kao Li-hsi (Shind Eitar) and the Yangs, feels very awkward indeed. In Chikamatsu Monogatari there is Mizoguchis trademark x-ray depiction of a whole society in motion which feels totally natural. Here amidst the Chinese up-right furnishings, the matte porphyry and exotic colours (pastels of yellow, purple and violet) which seem completely alien to Mizoguchi, the protagonists battle it out in the manner of two-dimensional cartoon caricatures. It doesnt help matters that Ykihi herself is whitewashed as a pure angel whereas the Emperor is simply the indecisive vacillating prisoner denied a single scene where he becomes a flesh and blood real character. Sad to relate, impeccably researched as the costumes and mise-en-scne obviously are there is nothing to disguise all the puppet-characters here as Japanese actors in piles of Chinese period clothing. Only the solemn expressions prevent the film from sliding into delirious kitsch.

Act 3 charts An Lu-shans rebellion, most of it related with title cards (Mizoguchi taking another lesson from Hollywood) and there is little to really captivate the senses except for the execution scene itself. Mark Le Fanu stresses that we are moved because Ykihi takes the decision herself and her preparations are beautifully observed by Mizoguchis camera as she gives a hairpin to her maid with the instruction to give it to the Emperor, selects a silk scarf which she prefers to be hanged by, and walks outside to her fate. The camera points down at the train of her dress as she approaches the tree and we see first the slippers abandoned and then jewelry cast aside as she renounces her official position. With typical subtlety an ellipse blocks out the moment of execution and we cut straight to the corpse being borne to a shaken Emperor. As a sequence in itself there is nothing wrong and it does fit into the central Mizoguchian thematic of women sacrificing themselves to men, but coming at the end of a film where we don't feel involved with the characters there is something hollow here which doesnt ring true. Similarly, the epilog where we are taken back to an aged Emperor as he collapses in front of the statue we saw in the prolog and we hear Ykihi inviting him to her in the afterlife as the camera drifts through an open door and across a graveyard as the two laugh united in death feels over-constructed, highly contrived and sentimental to the point of whimsy. The voice from beyond the grave also closes both The Lady from Musashino (1951) and Ugetsu Monogatari (1953), but there we care about the characters and feel completely sucked in by the drama which seems elemental and pure. Here we are left out in the cold, unsatisfied and unengaged. Had Mizoguchi lived longer he may have given us a truly stunning colour film which captivates the intellect as well as the eyes, but Ykihi is a textbook example of what happens when the visual side of things is allowed to swamp the script. A very beautiful but essentially empty spectacle, this cannot compare with Ozu Yasujirs first venture into colour Equinox Flower made three years later.",1488240000,,9451,4.88107098381071
