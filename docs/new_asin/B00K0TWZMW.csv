6397939,3,B00K0TWZMW,It went a little slow then came to an abrupt ending.  With some thought I could see the point.  I had trouble figuring it out at first.,1474675200,,135,3.962962962962963
6397940,4,B00K0TWZMW,"It is a small budget movie, though is well made.  However, the ending left the audience desiring more. The boy who played David has done a marvelous job - not sure if the the actor is a profession actor or is an amateur.  However, he has inherit talent to act.  Other actors have done a great job as well.  This is one small budget film I did not mind watching.",1473638400,,361,4.114285714285714

6397944,5,B00K0TWZMW,"This story, about a middle aged Muslim boy and his friendship with a Jewish boy, who assumes David is Jewish, is well done. It is thought provoking and shows how culture affects both Muslims and Jews. Although the story is probably fictional, it made me wonder how each of the boys would feel about the other's culture as they mature. The photography is excellent.",1468022400,2,364,4.703125
6397945,5,B00K0TWZMW,I loved it. Sad but true in so many ways,1466208000,,40,3.1

6397947,5,B00K0TWZMW,"Incredible movie.  Very sensitive.  It made me think, feel happy and very sad.  You identify with this kid who is deeply spiritual, but that also makes him different from the other kids at this young age.  Incredible movie, watch it.  Very relevant to what's going on in our world today.",1461283200,3,287,4.66

6397951,5,B00K0TWZMW,"AMAZING. Solid movie, beautifully written, beautifully directed.

I'll admit: The main reason I decided to watch this was the fact that Maz Jobrani is in the film and this is one of his more serious and thoughtful roles. But the real stars of the film are the kids, specifically David, the protagonist, who is so incredibly talented. Everything about this film felt real. The angst of David's sister... the relationships in the film, the friendships, the cultural themes, the setting, everything.

Do not pass this one up, you will not be disappointed.",1451433600,7,552,4.989130434782608
6397952,5,B00K0TWZMW,Heart warming story of a young man attempting to fit in and at the same time find himself!  Enjoyed every scene from beginning to end.,1447718400,,134,4.36
6397953,5,B00K0TWZMW,"Very entertaining story line.  All the characters were likable and interesting.  The boys were great, especially the young Muslin.",1445558400,,130,5.7894736842105265
6397954,4,B00K0TWZMW,"Nice concept,  but feel as if the resolution in the plot was lacking.",1437177600,,69,4.3076923076923075
6397955,5,B00K0TWZMW,A movie that we can all learn from.,1434240000,,35,3.5
6397956,3,B00K0TWZMW,This was a good coming of age movie. It has a lot trials and tribulations and stresses. That come with pleasing your parents and trying to fit in. Along with pressures of fitting in with people of your own age.,1414368000,,210,4.275
6397957,3,B00K0TWZMW,Interesting movie. I liked it because it dealt w/ religious differences but from a child like perspective so it wasn't too intense. I imagine many children that are raised in very religious homes are curious about the other religions of the world and this movie shows that being curious is not a bad thing.,1412380800,3,306,4.685185185185185

6397959,5,B00K0TWZMW,"Well done! Duad is precious and Maz Jobrani does exceedingly well in a serious role. Please make a ""Five years later"" follow up to this story--it's something people need to experience.",1404518400,,184,4.967741935483871
6397960,5,B00K0TWZMW,What a little gem of a movie.  I wish we would be more like children where innocence can teach us so much more.  I wish it were on DVD so I could use it as a teaching device in a religious setting.,1404259200,,197,3.6666666666666665
6397961,4,B00K0TWZMW,I watched the move the other day and it held my attention. I recommend it to people who like to watch movies on TV.,1402012800,,115,3.8333333333333335
6397962,4,B00K0TWZMW,"I greatly enjoyed this somewhat simple story about youngsters that touches on so many issues of depth and complexity for adults. The young Muslim boy Daoud is drawn to an association with the Jewish boys and conceals his religion. Thus, friendships naturally develop. Then, the crisis, his identity is revealed and he is turned away for having lied to them.  Yet, what remains is the reality of that natural association that did lead to friendship.  This is the basic question for humanity, across ""religions"" - as seen in a child: can we be one as human beings?  A very difficult questions.  As certain holy writings say, ""...and a child shall lead them...""",1400371200,4,658,4.848214285714286

6397964,5,B00K0TWZMW,"The touching film with a lot of heart. A must see for Anyone who questions the boundaries of identity. The film shows us the value if seeing people for who they are passed the clutter of religion, race and ethnicity.",1399075200,5,216,4.425
8654979,5,B00K0TWZMW,"Honest and credible portrayal of a young boy caught between two worlds. When he accidentally loses a very important heirloom, he goes on a quest to retrieve it, at first bravely entering an unfamiliar culture, but eventually finding that friendship and family are universal strengths. A real gem of a film, set in modern day Brooklyn.",1525219200,,334,4.982142857142857
8654980,5,B00K0TWZMW,"Loved. Precious young actors. Such innocence.  Well written, simple story line yet powerful.  Gives me much to ponder...",1524700800,,120,5.611111111111111
8654981,5,B00K0TWZMW,"Beautiful story, beautiful movie and great actors.  The two kids are great and wish them the best in their acting career.  This movie gives you a glimpse at Muslim and Jewish lives.  Two proud cultures intermingled in one story.

One kid, Duad/David, is studying the Quran and his father is head of a mosque in Brooklyn (Bay Ridge), New York.  His Muslim father is very strict, and Duad has a sister who received a scholarship to study Computer Science at Standford University in California, but the father refuses to let her go far from home.  The Muslim mother is passive, but has a high influence over the father as a house wife, and she sides with the kids.

The other kid, Yoav, is studying at the Yeshiva school nearby and his family is Jewish.  One day when Yoav was studying the Jewish Bible with his friends at a park, Yoav left his Bible on the park bench.  Duad, being a really good person, he chases Yoav to the Yeshiva school to return the Bible, but was locked out.  In his rush to leave, Duad left the book in the Yeshiva's mailbox only to later discover that he had left his family Quran instead.  He then returns to the Yeshiva and plays himself off as a Jewish kid named David, so that he can access the school to get his Quran back.  While there, he befriends Yoav, and they became best friends.  They enjoyed life together and David had the chance to learn about the Jewish life style.  Living in two worlds, he knew he would have never met his friend if not for this incident.  The question is, can they remain best friends forever?  Must their cultures/religions keep them apart?",1515196800,,1601,4.468965517241379
8654982,5,B00K0TWZMW,Sweet movie of young boys that became friends until religious beliefs got in the way. Definitely worth the time invested.,1514332800,,121,5.1

8654984,5,B00K0TWZMW,An incredible movie,1508630400,,19,5.666666666666667
8654985,4,B00K0TWZMW,"This is a film that everyone should see. Thru these kids, the film shows how polarizing religions can be.
A Jewish boy and a Muslim are great friends until the Jewish boy finds out his friend is Muslim.
This is like a condensed version of what is going on around in the world.
Religion seems to get in the way of friendships. It polarizes the world.
These two boys are wonderful actors. I just love these little guys.",1503705600,,417,4.358974358974359
