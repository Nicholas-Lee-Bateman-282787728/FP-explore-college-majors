1038458,1,630548130X,"Unbelievable. This movie is so incredibly bad that my hands are shaking as I type this. I felt I needed to give it a look as I am obsessed with all things Dean.........but this is too much to bear. Casper van Dien may be a  Melrose Dawson Party Of 90210 pretty-boy, but he couldn't have been a worse  choice to portray Jimmy. I was absolutely appalled by every facet of this  misguided attempt at saluting the most influential, creative and sensitive  film actor who ever lived. The right actor to play Jimmy (if there IS or  WILL EVER BE one) has yet to surface. Until he does, and until a writer and  director with the intelligence and sensitivity required for this type of  project make themselves known, commiting a decent portrayal of Jimmy's life  and career to film should not be attempted. Do yourselves a favor, folks,  and STAY AWAY FROM THIS TRIPE. If you want to know about Jimmy, see his  films! EAST OF EDEN, REBEL WITHOUT A CAUSE and GIANT are amazing  achievements on EVERY level. Treat yourself to one of the excellent JD  biographies available, most notably JAMES DEAN: THE MUTANT KING by David  Dalton (the best) and REBEL by Donald Spoto (also top-drawer). Enough said.",962928000,7,1189,4.631578947368421

1038460,1,630548130X,"This film has got to be the single, most atrocious bio-pic ever put on film. I'm not exagerrating when I venture to say that it is one of the very worst films I have ever seen and I've seen many. This poor excuse for a  movie focuses on mostly on the love affair between James Dean and Pier  Angeli. The acting is awful. Casper Van Dien is laughable as James Dean. He  tries but fails big time. Diane Ladd, who plays Mama Angeli, hits an  all-time low. The competent, often excellent actress gives an amazingly  terrible performance and happens to sport the single, most awful Italian  accent ever in the history of movies. It's not just the acting that stinks  but also the sloppy editing, the horrid direction, the stupid script and  the laughibly lame songs that fill the soundtrack. This whole abomination  has to be seen to be believed!",952646400,12,841,4.553333333333334
1038461,1,630548130X,"I went into this expecting (at least) a halfway decent direct-to-video, or made-for-cable film; what I watched was a ghastly mishmash... poorly directed; poorly acted; poorly edited; just: poor! To anyone interested in  Dean, this video is an insult (and to add insult to injury, the  ""filmmakers"" dedicated the film to Dean in the end credits!!)  And to think that this was Robert Mitchum's last film (and he does look  very ill in the small part he played [as George Cukor] toward the end);  that just adds to the travesty.  Anyone looking to shell out the asking  price to own this film: caveat emptor!  Beware, at all costs!",933033600,9,628,4.75
1038607,5,630548130X,"After all the negative reviews I've read on this, I was suprised that I actually enjoyed this film.  It's not as deep as the James Franco version, but it was still a good film.  It shows the more crazier side of Dean, which I think is completely true, because I have read about Dean and seen bios on him and a lot of people do say that he is a wierd guy and a bit crazy.  Him being a genius actor, I'm not so suprised that he is a bit crazy.  Anyway, the film did heavily go over the Pier Angeli love affair.  Though I doubt James Dean actually loved her as much as the film emphasizes, I do believe that she really loved him.  This movie didn't touch on the homosexual side of Dean, though not an appealing fact about his life, it's still part of his history.  The Franco version didn't really go over this either, but it still touched upon this part of Dean's life in a classy way.  This movie is perhaps half accurate and half not, but I still enjoyed this movie and would recommend it to any James Dean fan like myself.",1127952000,4,1023,4.1313131313131315
1038608,4,630548130X,"This film never claims to be a COMPLETE or ACCURATE autobiographical release.  Its a combination of fact and fiction.  Just like Hollywood itself.

I do feel Casper Van Dien does a very good role playing James Dean.  I mean honestly how can you expect ANYONE to measure up to the man himself.  We all know and agree James Dean himself is just larger than life and borders more on the edge of something beyond words.  He was just so talented, just so enigmatic!!  Even today his body of work touches each new generation in so many ways.

Granted, if you are looking for a complete chronological movie about the life of James Dean then look elsewhere.  But if you are looking for an interesting little movie then watch this.  If you are a James Dean fan of any sort then I feel this movie is worth watching and even owning.  Casper Van Dien IS A WONDERFUL actor.  This movie just proves it.  This movie is also interesting because I beleive this is the LAST film the veteran actor Robert Mitchum EVER appeared in!  I mean this man in his own right is a film legend.  Also it is the FIRST movie to ever star Robert Mitchum's granddaughter.

This is a neat little flick about a PORTION of James Dean's life.  It represents that part of his life rather well.  The enigma that is ""James Dean"" today is probably so far removed from the real man we would all be hurt if the truth were known.  He represents something different to each of us.  That is what makes James Dean the ""legend"" so AWESOME.  This movie just adds a little to that legend and enigma!!!",1112572800,2,1549,4.383802816901408
1038609,4,630548130X,"I really enjoyed this movie, it helped ignite my love for Jimmy. I had never heard of Jimmy or Casper before I seen this movie, therefore I Originally had no bias what so ever, I did go on to read his biography and research him greatly after viewing the movie. Once done this I watched the movie again and I must say I still enjoyed it, yes I admit there was sum really odd things about the acting and portrayal of Jimmy however there was that intence look and voice that Casper Portrayed oh so well!!! (the name change for the us premiere was not well thoughtout)",1109894400,,564,4.280373831775701
1038610,1,630548130X,"This film is extremely insulting to the memory of James Byron Dean, and attempts at presenting a ""cool-legend"" other than how Jimmy actually was.  Bad, bad, bad stuff right here.  Please, ... Casper? (I can't believe I can't get work acting (I look more like Jimmy than he does), this performance was pathetic and one-dimensional.)  For a great and multi-layered portrayal of how Jimmy was check out ""James Dean"" starring James Franco (a role in which he won several awards).  While the TNT film may have some factual slip-ups here and there, it does not romanticize and idealize James Dean.  It presents Jimmy as a lonely boy with vast emotional problems searching for acceptance and love. (Which is exactly who he was)...",1019779200,7,723,4.89344262295082
1038611,1,630548130X,"I could play a better James Dean than Casper. I cannot even believe they chose him, I find that so insulting. This movie [stinks] royally and thats that. And for once could we please have an honest hollywood film about his LIFE no fiction added romance.... EVERYONE KNOWS he was bisexual... whats the big deal? I think its okay to make a film about that as well as all the other real things he did and what he delt with. Enough of this low budget trash.",993600000,5,453,4.27906976744186
1038612,5,630548130X,"I think this is a good film, period!!!! I live in Indiana and I have been a Jimmy Dean fan for over half my life (I'm 36).  The point here is that there will never be another James Dean, we all know that, so get over it!!!!!  I'd never expect any guy to play Jimmy and capture his whole persona.  Jimmy was too talented and special for that to happen.  Casper is blond, blue eyed, medium-short height, and pulls off Jimmy's facial expressions and body gestures well.  What else can you expect?  I think Casper is a fine actor and he does a sensitive thoughtful acting job in the role of James Dean.
 For starters, everyone knows Pier left Jimmy for Vic Damone (documented facts here, even Pier said so later).  The story of Pier and Jimmy in this movie is considered by most Dean fans to be the true one.  Pier's mother pushed her to marry Vic, end of story.  Unless you subscribe to the story that Jimmy was gay and their relationship was a farce (for myself, I think the idea of Jimmy being gay is a farce in itself).
 Yes this film has flaws.  Sal and Natalie are depicted unfairly, but that is a judgement call depending on whose facts you choose to believe.  I thought the jibe to both was unessesary.  sal was gay and Natalie slept around, but Jimmy was no angel either.  It was uncalled for.
 Robert Mitchum and Connie Stevens are awesome in this movie as well as Carrie Mitchum (Casper's ex-wife).  Diane Ladd was so good as Mama Pierangeli that I wanted to reach through the TV screen and punch her lights out.  If you like Dean and are open minded enought to seeing someone play Jimmy, then you may find that you will like this film.  It is meant to be an action-drama, not a serious hardcore bio picture.  Lot's of cool scenes of Jimmy (Casper) riding a motorcycle and Jimmy's Porche's.  The soundtrack can be overbearing at times, like alot of film's nowadays.
 Poor Jimmy and Pier, I'll bet they are in heaven right now snuggling.  I hope they are together finally.",991267200,8,1978,4.403314917127072
1038613,2,630548130X,"i have to agree with the other reviewers for the most part this movie stinks.  With the possible exception of Robert Mitchum the acting is horrid and the movie very inaccurate. James Dean was not madly in love with Pier Angelli and in fact broke off the relationship with her.  In the movie the reverse is true.  On the plus side the music, at least the songs by  Gordon Waller are excellent if you like mid 50s music or are a Peter and Gordon fan.  You may consider buying the soundtrack 'Race With Destiny"" if you can find it. I give it 4 stars, fron what i have heard from the movie.",981504000,3,586,4.196428571428571
1038614,1,630548130X,"I am still in dis-belief after viewing this terrible excuse for a movie. James Dean,was such an icon,seeing him portrayed by such an incapable actor discusts me. Casper Van Dein doesn't even attempt to give a good performance. He says his lines with no emotion. Diane Ladd is just plain goofy,as is Connie Stevens.(possibly laughable). I also hated the way Sal Mineo and Natalie Wood were portrayed. This film has no respect for the dead,and in return,should get no respect from the living.",970099200,5,490,4.9156626506024095
1038615,1,630548130X,"Casper Van Dien needs to go back to the monkeys,and stick to acting in  ""Tarzan"" movies,as he cannot act his way out of a paper bag!  Starring as James Dean,he is plain horrible,not to mention insulting to the  legend of James Dean..and Diane Ladd? Well,she gives new meaning to bad  wigs,phoney accents,and horrible acting! But we all knew her credibility  was over,years ago,when she gave birth(discustingly graphic) to a dinosaur  in that other horrible film,""Carnisaur"". Obviously,Ms. Ladd is  desperate to take on ANY roll she can get these days! This film's negatives  should be destroyed! POOR GARBAGE!",968198400,4,609,5.206185567010309
7890429,5,630548130X,"James Dean: Live Fast Die Young was a quick biography of JJames Dean.  Many actors are involved, I watched particularly to see Connie Stevens. Fans of the 1950's, James Dean, and Connie Stevens will like this the most.",1448409600,,218,4.7368421052631575

7890431,1,630548130X,"James Dean: Race With Destiny is a biographical film about the movie legend that stars Casper Van Dien in the title role. It follows the time when he was Hollywood for only a short period of time while working in New York after the release of East Of Eden. There were no other aspect of his life tackled and it provides a major emphasis on his love affair with Pier Angeli.

This is a disaster. Probably that it even an understatement. It provides nothing about James Dean nor does it give him any tribute at all. Added to that,it was poorly acted as Van Dien is the worst James Dean portrayal ever that is not even up to par with that of James Franco and Stephen McHattie. Finally,it was just one awful movie not only compared to Dean biopics but to any other released. This simply insults the movie legend and basically just capitalizes on Dean's legacy for a quick profit.",1418860800,,875,4.434782608695652
7890432,1,630548130X,"This movie is horrible.  Carrie Mitchum is such a bad actress and uses the worst fake accent.  Casper Van Dien looks nothing like James Dean and is a pretty terrible actor as well.  I read that they were married in real life, and I can totally see why they aren't together anymore.  They couldn't even fake chemistry for this movie...I guess that could have something to do with their lack of acting skills though.  Also the costumes are HORRIBLE!  They used a few actual vintage items, but there were so many mistakes made by the costumer.  I would give this film negative stars if it was possible.",1402876800,,599,4.542056074766355
7890433,2,630548130X,"Focussed too much on tough/cool side of Dean and not enough on other aspects of his personality (sensitive, shy, insecure, farmboy values, clever, funny and mischievous in a Tom Sawyer way.  He was also quite bright and creative (painted, sculptured, loved classical music and dance).  I think the love relationships with Angeli and Andress were not well portrayed.  It appears , at least on the surface that he was over Angeli by the time he met Andress (which was the summer of 1955).  There are many pictures of him and Ursula together ---laughing and cuddling --- in which he seems very relaxed.  He talked about learning German so that ""they could fight better / or fight in another language"".  So even though it was tumultous there was obvious passion there and he seemed to like and admire her independence (quoted as saying ""she doesn't take any baloney from me and I don't take any from her....."").  Also, his friend Lew Bracker gives a rather provocative account of Vic Damone approaching Dean at Villa Capri (Aug. 21, 1955)  to ""toast his new fatherhood""  and Dean took it all in stride.",1394496000,,1098,4.767195767195767
7890434,1,630548130X,"James Dean was a very complex person. He was polite, yet rude, lonely, yet charming, a very difficult part to play for any young actor. I've seen many documentaries on James Dean, as he's my favorite actor, and try to read up in him as much as possible. This film I found very distasteful and poorly done however. Id give it 0 stars if that was even possible. Casper Van Dien makes James Dean look like a whiny, childlike, obnoxious boy. The plot is very unrealistic, and any fan of James Dean would agree. Sure, pier angeli was the one true love of his life, one that could never be recreated on the screen in my opinion. The only part of the film I find amusing is the fact that I wasted money on this horrible piece of crap called a movie. If you want to be given a vague, unrealistic view of who James Dean was, watch this film. It will forever change the way you see biographical films. James Dean is an American icon, a hero in my eyes. This film ruins him. Take my advice: if you just now have found out about James Dean, don't watch this film. It will give you the wrong impression of who he really was.",1375228800,,1111,4.196261682242991
7890435,1,630548130X,"This is a bad as you can imagine.  Don't be conned on this.  Check out the James Franco ""James Dean"" if you want something good on Dean's life/career.  He won the Golden Globe for his performance.  On the race version - you were warned here first!",1267747200,2,247,4.304347826086956
7890436,5,630548130X,"Let start off by saying I've been a fan of James Dean since i was a kid. I've seen his movies and some of his tv work. he is definitely one of a kind. I liked this movie very much, easily the best movie about James Dean. Casper Van Dien potrayed him flawlessly. He did have a darker side most fans are not aware of. He actually had an obsession with death and was good friends with  TV's Vampira among other things. He was very good racer, no telling how many trophys he would've brought home if he had lived. The only thing about this movie is it should have been longer, but other than that it's great. George Barris himself Customized the Porsche Spyder 550 for the movie. Also this was Robert Mitchum's last movie before he died, he was an acting legend in his own right. Check it out, it's definitely worth it. James Dean's legacy will live on!",1176249600,,849,4.273291925465839
7890437,3,630548130X,"I just bought this movie on DVD, but I had seen it on TV about 4 years ago. Since I had seen it before, I obviously liked it well enough to buy it. Let me start out  by saying that I am a huge James Dean Fan. As far as I know there have been only 3  movies made about James -this one, the James Franco 2001 version and the 1976 TV film. I have not seen the 1976 version so I can't comment on it. Everyone knows and agrees that the Franco version is excellent and the best of all the  James Dean films, but this movie is far from being as bad as most people  seem to think it is. In fact I think that it is underrated and uncredited in many areas. This film is hated by a lot of Dean fans who feel that Casper made a horrible Jimmy. I don't agree. I don't think there is a person on the face of the Earth that can accurately portray the greatness and magnetism that is Jimmy. James Franco came closest, but Casper did not do a bad job. I'm a fan of Casper's too and I think that he did a fair job here. Carrie Mitchum was the perfect Pier Angeli. She was fantastic .She was the perfect Pier . She is similar in stature  to Pier and her accent was perfect. She even looks like Pier a bit. She has played  the role of Pier  the best so far hands down... What is most overlooked and underappreciated about this film though is its deep exploration of the romance between Jimmy and Pier.  Its the major part of the story here and no other Jimmy film so far has devoted this much time to the Jimmy/Pier romance or delved this deeply into it. And as a Jimmy/Pier fan, I really love and appreciate that. I think that their romance hasn't  been depicted enough in either books or film. And for those two things alone, the film deserves a lot of credit and praise. The film is a lovely tribute to their love. The soundtrack is full of 50s Music. And the transfer to DVD is really bright and clear with great sound.

 Before I wrap up my  review, I'd like to comment on a couple of mistakes  made by my fellow Reviewers. I don't think the film necessarily depicted Natalie Wood badly. By her own admission, she had a big crush on Jimmy and she often flirted with him almost the entire time she knew him. That has been stated in many books.

 And Jimmy did see and speak to Pier again at least a few times after they broke up. They spoke on the phone while she was in the hospitalafter being injured on a plane while she was pregnant and a  couple of Jimmy's friends saw her over at his house  not long before he died. That in the book Little Boy Lost if anyone cares to read it.
Just thought it was important to clear those things up.",1148774400,2,2622,4.060194174757282
7890438,2,630548130X,"I don't know anything about James Dean.  I'm not a fan of his.  The only reason I saw this film is because my wife picked it up for a dollar.

The film makes James Dean look like a jerk.  I'll give you an example.  He is in love with an Italian girl, and in front of her mother he insults Italians by referring to one as a pasta head.

He is a self centered and annoying jerk throughout much of the movie.  Reading other reviews on this site, it seems that he wasn't that way in real life.

Also, I remember reading somewhere that he had a terrible relationship with his foster parents, and that he received a lot of beatings.  In this film, his dad is just peachy with him.  If they can't even get that right, I have to wonder who this film is about.

There is an ultra phony scene where James Dean makes a tough guy basically quack like a duck.  He tells the tough guy to admit that he is a yellow chicken, and the guy does, all because James Dean is holding a finger against the guy's eye.  What a stupid scene.  The guy should have grabbed his hand and pulled it away from his eye, and then socked him.  How stupid was this?  You can't just stand there holding your finger to someone's eye.  It simply doesn't work.  Either you poke the man's eye or you get your hand pulled away, one or the other.  It is not difficult to pull someone's hand away from your damn eye and move your head back.

The whole movie was intent on portraying James Dean as some tough guy with an attitude, rebel without a cause.  It was just stupid.  That was the name of a movie.  That wasn't the biography of a three dimensional man.

The love of his life, Pier Angeli, came off as an idiot, even moreso than Dean.  She loved Dean but she married Vic Damone because her mother told her to.  What?  What century were these people living in?  That was ridiculous.  If I am to believe these characters as presented, I can feel no sympathy for that moronic girl, but only scorn, and wish her the worst.  Too bad she didn't get killed in a car wreck.  Moron.

All in all, a frustrating and stupid movie.  I was rooting against the characters because they were so damn annoying and stupid.  I was wishing them the worst.  A nice happy ending would have been for them all to fall in quicksand and sink.",1136073600,4,2276,4.189814814814815
