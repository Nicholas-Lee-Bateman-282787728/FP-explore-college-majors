It is one hour and thirty minutes (give or take) of non-stop B movie  humor.  It shars a level of ha ha suckyness shared only by aclaimed films  such as ""I Spit on Your Grave"" and ""Philidelphia""  OH  sorry about that ""Philidelphia wasn't a B movie.",938563200,2,392,4.422535211267606
1010729,4,6305326657,"The right audience will LOVE this movie, but if you're looking for jolts and scare...or even a good movie, keep on looking. ""Night Train to Terror"" is amazing. Packed full of incompetence, but lots of heart, it's a train-wreck (sorry but I couldn't resist) of a movie.

As the film opens we meet a jazzercise class in full swing on a runaway train. All spandexed up and looking to rock and roll, this group of partiers fails to realize they are on a trained doomed to crash, and in the next car over God and Satan are dueling over their fates. Satan presents three ""cases"" for God's review in which he gleefully points out humanity's failings, and as God points out the good found in Man in even the worst circumstances. Each case is it's own little story, none of which are very good or even really coherent, but each is chock full of over-the-top scenery chewing, blood, boobs and amazing dialog.

No, this isn't a ""good"" film, but it's enjoyable as hell in a so-bad-it's-good kind of way. Recommended if bad movies are your thing.",1454630400,,1033,4.548387096774194

1010778,5,6305326657,"Vinegar Syndrome's new blu-ray/dvd combo of Night Train to Terror is a trashfilm lover's dream come true. Not only do you get a high quality transfer (on both discs, though obviously the blu-ray has a bit better picture and sound) but some great extras as well, including the complete version of the second story, Gretta, on the dvd. For those who don't know, Night Train is a collection of three oddball, unfinished, shot-in-Utah features re-edited into a completely incomprehensible, insane, ridiculous 93 minute ""anthology"". Wrap around stuff featuring God and the Devil on a train viewing the three stories, as well as a goofy recurring whitebread pseudo break-dancing musical thing, only add more bewilderment to the proceedings. Throw in some off the wall gore, abundant nudity and stop-motion monsters and you have Night Train to Terror!

Gretta, apparently based on a pulp novel by Erskine Caldwell (what it says in the title anyway), is actually a very entertaining schlockfest and makes much more sense (although it's still very messed up) as a complete piece. Cute lead actress Meredith Haze is no Meryl Streep but she immerses herself into the title role with gusto, verve and minimal clothing. The story is hard to describe, basically it follows Gretta's rather odd trajectory from porn actress/ piano player to gender-confused mobster (I'm not kidding). There is also a subplot involving a death-wish club, wherein the members play Russian roulette type games with deadly consequences (these scenes made it into Night Train, with the stop motion and makeup effects added later).

Other extras include two commentaries, one with a couple enthusiastic and informative researchers of the film and one with director (of the added footage) Jay Schlossberg. This latter commentary has to be heard to be believed. It's the most rambling, maddening, verbose, almost psychotic sounding commentary I have ever heard. The poor guy conducting the interview with Schlossberg literally has to stop him at certain points to try and get him on some sort of relevant track. Many answers as to why Night Train to Terror is such an exquisite mess can be gleaned by simply trying to listen to Schlossberg ramble on about his dreams of Broadway stardom, his cinematic influences of Brakhage and Kubrick, his fine art painting, etc.

1010780,4,6305326657,"While certainly not my favorite b-movie, Night Train to Terror is worthwhile viewing. Strange horror-comedy.

  Three stories, two of which are edited down from previously released full length features. Each connected by segments on a train featuring god and satan bickering, and an amusingly horrible collection of fashionable 80s kids breakdancing and singing.  Richard Moll (Bull, of Night Court) appears in two of the stories. Cameron Mitchell also appears in the last.  My favorite story is the second one, which will be featured as a full length bonus on Vinegar Syndrome's release (Death Wish Club aka Gretta is worth your time!). It's the tale of a college kid obsessing over a girl he sees in a skin flick; he meets her, and is lured into her club of near-death survivors whom enjoy the sport of various Russian roulettes. This story is just WEIRD. It alternates between genuine creepiness and (not always intentional) comedy, and the lead actress is extremely sexy.

I'm guessing most who bother to read these reviews have already seen the film. But if you haven't, give it a shot.",1377820800,15,1091,4.967032967032967

1010784,2,6305326657,"""Night Train to Terror"" is a wretched combination of (apparently) three horrendously bad movies which have been edited down to a singular completely incoherent plot, with links added featuring good versus evil on a model train scheduled by Satan to crash at dawn, all combined in the format of a wretched music video from the 1980s, complete with breakdancing.

The first storyline concerns a man who kills his wife by driving off a bridge, and who then becomes involved in a plot to remove organs (only from attractive women) and sell them to medical schools. Plot emphasis is on random gore (including the most unrealistic beheading ever), bad dreams, and lots of screaming, all tied together with no production values.

After an intermission from the debate club on the train where horrible dialogue is exchanged (sample: ""You have no tears; you don't know how to cry.""; ""I can laugh and cry at the same time."") interspersed with more of the same horrendous pop song and stock footage of a steam locomotive, the film progresses to subplot two, ""The Case of Gretta Connors,"" which starts at a carnival with Gretta selling popcorn. Needless to say Gretta is a struggling musician and actress who only lives for stardom and playing the piano. She is quickly seduced by the evil George Youngmeyer, who puts her in risque movies. The oldest fraternity brother in history, Glenn, sees one of her films and falls in love with her. He then tracks her down (today this is called stalking) and they fall in love. George is furious and vows revenge. He involves them in something called ""The Death Club"" where members try to die in creative ways. I will tell you that while this movie is generally only worth one star (if that), I gave it a bonus star for the most hilarious special effect since ""Robot Monster,"" namely the claymation ""Tanzanian Winged Beetle"" which could not be made funnier if they tried. The electrocution computer is also ludicrous as it melts the face of its randomly selected club member: watch for the classic line ""Excuse me while I smoke."" What isn't clear is why Glenn and Gretta decided to participate in this club if they were so in love and had such a lust for life. Also watch for the endless pontification on the subject of a wrecking ball, and a special guest appearance by Mark Ridley as Prince Flubutu.

After yet more singing the same old song and even more breakdancing, the case of Claire Hansen delves into a confusing and sacrilegious subplot about good versus evil in Nazi Germany, which segues into an extended disco and claymation debacle of epic proportions. It's kind of like ""The Omen"" combined with ""Can't Stop The Music."" This story was the most pretentious and the most boring. Fortunately it's only a half hour until the train wreck, which features a terrible scale model which would embarrass the producers of the Godzilla series. Finally, after a bit more pompous pontification, we get to see yet more of the song (""Everybody's got something to do, everybody but you!""), and after another round of breakdancing the credits roll, and not a moment too soon.

Although I am a hardened veteran of numerous B-movies, I found this one trying in the extreme: it took me four attempts to make it all the way through this mess. It turns out that when you put three otherwise awful films together into a single cinematic work that the synergistic effect does not improve them: to the contrary, the net result is one of the most jaw-droppingly bad films in memory.

I do not recommend this movie for humans.",1221868800,2,3540,4.758957654723127

1010814,5,6305326657,"Well, I'm very sure that by today's horror standards, Night Train To Terror, released in 1984, is tame, but there were moments in the film that were genuinely frightening in its intensity. On DVD, it has been restored to look crisp and new, with great sound. It all begins with a train ride where abet between God and the Devil, a classic theological theme (as presented in the Book of Job)triggers a series of horror vignettes. The struggle between good and evil abounds in these stories. The first tale is of a man who becomes a guinea pig for a group of doctors who cut off body parts (without anesthesia) to sell them off to schools. The second story is about a wayward young girl who gets trapped in the world of pornography and a deadly cult who play a fatal game of Russian Roulette. This particular one is awfully disturbing, especially a scene in which a Jimmy Hendrix type is electrocuted to a crisp. This material is R-rated and I sense this film probably aired late nights on TV or cable in the 80's. The last story is about a courageous woman whose husband is the Devil incarnate who was also a former Nazi officer. The heroine defeats the devil with a box made of the True Cross. The whole thing is a mixture of cult campiness and 80's nostalgia. The song ""Dance With Me"" is straight out of early MTV as the young kids dance on the train that is awaiting a collision. Not for the faint of heart.",1130716800,,1409,4.402298850574713

Sound is average at best.  The movie, or movies as it is, are rather confusing.  The action seems to bounce all over the place and it is not entirely clear as to what is going on most of the time.  The general idea of the movie (e.g. God and Satan bartering over souls) is interesting but this movie does not pull it off very well.  The only thing that keeps it remotely interesting are the short parts with gore that is so fake and funny you end up laughing your ass off (clay animation anyone?).

1010817,5,6305326657,"I wish Amazon would let customers use 1/2 star ratings cos this is actually a 4 /12 out of 5; Just short of a brilliant masterpiece in mid-80's four to ten minute attention spans, with a fake band aping Menudo and playing a song that makes Rick Springfield sound sophisticated.
I first watched this on a drunken movie night binge and we were so impressed we played it twice: Half of which was due to being able to make zero sense of what was going on. Under initial scruitiny, the film appeared to be three features that had been edited down to become ""chapters"" in an athology piece, and ten minutes or so of research proved that to be true: NIGHT TRAIN TO TERROR is actually three features from director John Carr, two of which were miserable bombs and one of which was apparently never finished, that the producer[s] then cut down to the barest minimum of footage deemed necessary to make them into the anthology chapters.
The most popular & memorable of the three is actually the unfinished SCREAM YOUR HEAD OFF with the great John Phillip Law in what would have been another one of those sad exploitation & horror films he was reduced to appearing in just to keep up on the alimony payments in the late 70s/early 80s. Because the film was never finished & trimmed down to about 27 minutes or so of footage, what we are left with is a dizzying tale about an insane asylum that is a front for a body parts harvesting organization, with Law being their latest recruit to be hypnotized, go out into the world & drug people [usually attractive B movie would have been starlets], bring them back to the asylum and turn them over to Richard Moll [billed as Charles Moll] who straps them down to gurneys, strips them nude, molests/assaults them, and then uses a hacksaw & other implements to carve off the marketable portions. Along the way we get a sexy head nurse Ratchet from hell, a lobotomized asylum director, John Phillip Law singing a church hymn, and what would have been the finest American made Mad Asylum thriller since DON'T LOOK IN THE BASEMENT, which this movie is very reminiscent of. Gory, filled with exploitative nudity and utterly incomprehensible, this is my favorite of the bunch as well & the lost footage should be resurrected for a reconstruction -- It'd be an instant classic.
Part two is actually all that is left of what was known as DEATH WISH CLUB, a straight to video bomb that actually is very reminiscent of Jess Franco's exploitation/murder mystery hybrids & shares their air of tacky immediacy. A not so young couple run afoul of a pornographer who enrolls them in a suicide thrill club, with results that are utterly hilarious and, again, edited down to the point where the film has no continuity on it's own and had to have a voiceover narration explain the events which unfold. They are not bothering mentioning, but the claymation killer bug is, a device that Carr apparently became enamored enough with to invest a serious amount of screen time to it in the next chapter;
CATACLYSM. This was another home video only bomb that actually did find a release & is the least comprehensible of the three: What starts out as a sort of (...) Atrocicties From The Past bit turns into a confrontation against the Antichrist that allows for Carr to do a series of claymation sequences involving a giant Golem like creature run amok, as well as the anthology's most extensive use of his trademark horror gimmick: Having a victim electrocuted so that their head begins to shake back & forth like one of those mechanical paint shakers, while the flesh sizzles & smokes & melts off the skull [when allowed to run it's course]. While this may sound ""gross"" it looks about as realistic as his claymation Golem, and makes for laugh out loud moments that lovers of trash horror will go bonkers for.
Linking these three segments are a series of discussions between God and Satan [both played by Cameron Mitchell, who also plays the detective in the CATACLYSM segment] who are presiding over a train wreck about to happen. How this movie came to be in the form it exists as may be one of the great puzzles of the 1980's. If you are looking for meaningful plots, convincing performances and deft filmmaking, this title is not advised. But if you want a movie that will demand repeat viewings, elicit repeat laughter & cheers as well as jeers, this DVD is the best money you can spend on entertainment this side of ZOMBIE LAKE or KING KONG VERSUS GODZILLA.

7887741,4,6305326657,"This is one of those films that borders on being a cult classic, depending on who you are. God and Satan are riding on a party train that is doomed to crash at dawn, all on board will be dead...all the musicians, break dancers, shags, and sweatbands. There is a basic low level theological discussion of good and evil and free will as our twosome looks at three separate cases forming an anthology. The segments include an asylum, a death club, and some Nazi satanist. The film includes the ""God is Dead"" movement made to look idiotic.

This typical 80's film is available on many multi-packs. It is front loaded with nudity, mostly blondes strapped down to a table.

Guide: No swearing.  Sex and Nudity (Lisa Watkins, Micki Anne Corbin, Merideth Kennedy, Merideth Haze...basically this film was career killers for all these women too.)",1474588800,3,836,4.791666666666667
