8105736,5,B000E4IED2,"Fast shipping, as advertised, I love the old nascar races, differnt style of cars, different era of men.
Need to bring back more of the older races like this one.",1487894400,,162,4.433333333333334
8105737,5,B000E4IED2,"If you love racing this is one for viewing, again.",1429833600,,50,4.1
8105738,5,B000E4IED2,This is the full TV broadcast (without the commercials).  So if you want to see a race as it was originally broadcast and not edited features...this is what you want.  There are some sporting events you want to keep and that are worth watching again.  This is the best way to accomplish that.,1425859200,2,292,4.471698113207547
8105739,5,B000E4IED2,"Exellent!  The only thing that disappointed me was the opening of the broadcast being cut out, and no starting grid or ""gentleman start your engines. Also the program ends too abruptly with no closing credits or wrap up.",1420761600,,220,4.7894736842105265
8105740,5,B000E4IED2,"Great classic of a great race.  First start to finish filming of the Daytona 500.  Benny Parson's carrying the first ever in car camera around the track.  It brought back a lot of memories of when I watched the race live on TV.  Naturally the fight at the end of the race which propelled NASCAR to front page news.  Joe Mesnzer's book ""The Great American Gamble - How the 1979 Daytona 500 Gave Birth to a NASCAR Nation"" is what turned me on to trying to purchase this DVD.  You can still see the front end of Donnie Allison and Cale Yarborough's cars on display at the NASCAR Hall of Fame in Charlotte, NC.",1395187200,,606,4.271929824561403
8105741,5,B000E4IED2,They say this is as good as the 1979 Daytona a lot when you are watching races. But nothing can compare to this race. I didn't grow up watching alot of these guys i was born the year before this race. BUT I can watch this race over and over.,1324339200,,241,3.84
8105742,1,B000E4IED2,NASCAR FANS SAVE YOUR MONEY!  This as well as others i've bought from nascar super store are almost un-watchable.  It's almost like some kid with a 8mm camera filmed these races.  These are not what was televised.  Had any TV station aired these NASCAR would never be where it is today.  The cars are white and black most of the time they are on screen.  They are just silhouettes from the sun glare.  I have been watching NASCAR since 1984 and I know personally this is not what was televised.  Even some of the newer races look this bad.  How could NASCAR get the money to grow as they did if fans couldn't see the fancy color schemes or even the number on the cars.  And the sound is also equally as bad.  I can't suggest strongly enough how much of a waste these tapes are.,1239753600,,777,4.2534246575342465
8105743,5,B000E4IED2,"This DVD does contain the full race coverage (it isn't only 1-1/2 hour long, it is much longer) and it's really worth the price.",1230249600,4,128,4.375
8105744,5,B000E4IED2,"to anyone who loves auto racing, this is a must have. This race was the first full race coverage. plus the added atttraction of the fight.",1219449600,2,138,4.346153846153846
