8155587,5,B000KC89CE,The DVD provides excellent step-by-step instructions for building concrete countertops.  I followed the instructions and was able to build a countertop that surpassed my expectations.,1374883200,2,183,6.32
8155588,2,B000KC89CE,"The title of the DVD does not cover the contents of the DVD.
There's only 1 episode on concrete countertops and it's not an advanced technique i think.
All other chapters on the DVD are about bistro table's, planters, and some on repairing.

If you need to choose buy the DVD from Fu Teng Cheng on concrete countertops.",1260403200,5,319,4.5
8155589,5,B000KC89CE,"I bought this DVD for my husband who fell in love with concrete work.

He loved it and recommends this to almost anyone who'd like to make a concrete countertop or work with concrete in general.",1174608000,4,194,4.388888888888889
8155590,5,B000KC89CE,"""Building Concrete Countertops with Buddy Rhodes"" is an excellent learning aid for the ""do-it-yourselfer"" and seasoned concrete countertop contractor.  If you have never attempted to do your own concrete countertop but have been thinking about it, this DVD will have you saying, ""it can't be that easy.""  Yes, it is! Not only are the basics of templating, building the mold, mixing, and finishing covered but two of Buddy Rhodes' signature techniques are explained and shown in detail. This alone is worth the price of the DVD even to an experienced concrete countertop maker.

As for me, the next concrete countertop I make will be with the Buddy Rhodes pressed technique and his concrete mix. Thanks Buddy for sharing your knowledge and joy!",1168646400,9,743,5.073770491803279
