8230133,5,B000XXWKFC,"Shaoran's teacher has been revealed as the one behind most of the demon uprisings and chaos all over the place. Shaoran may not be able to defeat him. As the 1st season comes to a close, we are a little closer to seeing Sakura saved. There is a long way to go though, and the Vampire Twins have an ace in the hole that appears to be awakening. This is a great conclusion to season 1.",1355097600,,383,4.052631578947368

8230135,4,B000XXWKFC,"I must say i love the manga series and if you want to know the truth read the MANGA INSTEAD the first series (26 episodes) was good but the 2nd series was destoried. I was sad to see it a great series ripped from it's greatness. The ovas in japanese was volumesin the manga series is 21, 22, and 23 which is the near the end of the manga series. I watched the ovas all 3 of them in english subs. Clamp decided that the third series would be cancel caused by the company in japan that killed the real seies, Clamp was not happy with them so they canceled the 3rd series, sad but true. It hurts me to watch the 2nd series they made it for kids, they took everything that was great about the series and changed it to something that was no longer the series itself. So if you really want to watch the series go a head but be warn the english is not so good either.  I about wanted to cry to see this series destoried.

I'M JUST GOING TO READ THE MANGA IT'S THE ONLY THING THAT IS REAL TO THE REAL DEAL AND IT'S GREATNESS FROM CLAMP WHICH ARE NOTHING BUT WOMEN MAKING THE STORIES. AND THESE LADIES HAVE PROVEN THEY ARE GREAT. SO PLEASE DON'T HAVE TO MUCH HOPE ON THE 2ND SERIES, BUT THE OVAS WERE OK.
BUT PLEASE BE WARN READ THE MANGA.",1206576000,,1230,4.036885245901639
