4388809,2,B004IWR06S,"""Hereafter"", the new film directed by Clint Eastwood and written by Peter Mprgan (""The Queen"", ""The Last King of Scotland"", ""Frost/ Nixon"") is as disappointing as a s&eacute;ance with a fake medium.

George (Matt Damon) is the type of factory worker who makes ""two grand a month"" yet lives in a nice apartment in San Francisco, one of the most expensive cities in the world. George has a secret; he was once a psychic very much in demand. He did readings for many people, he had a website, he helped people talk to the dearly departed and he was qite sought after. In fact, he still is when people remember who he is. But George has always viewed this ability as a curse. He doesn't practice any more, except when pressured by his brother (Jay Mohr), and prefers to just work in his meaningless job. Because the slightest human contact can cause him to see things, he has also shied away from meaningful relationships. Meanwhile, a French television journalist, Marie (Cecile de France) and her show's producer and boyfriend vacation in a tropical paradise. On their last day, Marie wakes up early to shop for souvenirs when a tsunami hits. While under water, she has visions that haunt her far after their return to Paris. She takes time off from the show to write a book about the repression of the psychic world. In London, twin brothers, Marcus and Jason (Frankie and George McLaren) struggle trying to maintain a normal life with their drug-addict mom (Lyndsey Marshall, BBC's ""Being Human""). When Jason dies, Marcus feels guilty and tries to find someway to contact him, visiting a number of people who profess to use different methods of contacting the dearly departed. Eventually, the three people will meet and help each other.

I am a huge fan of Eastwood's films and have had many long and passionate debates about ""Unforgiven"" with one of my best friends. She doesn't like the film. I have spent many hours trying to convince her this is the great film many recognize. However, she obstinantly refuses to see she is wrong. But we agree about ""Hereafter"", although her reaction was a little stronger than mine. She said it was the first film in a long time in which she has actually wanted her money back, she felt robbed. I wouldn't go that far. But there are a lot of problems with ""Hereafter"", so many that thornhill can't recommend it.

Let's start with the ending. After watching two hours of somber, maybe even somnambulistic storytelling, Eastwood and Morgan have designed an ending that is just so out of place it rings completely false. Worse, for two men who have created some of the most memorable films in recent memory, it rings like an ending more suited for a television show. Obviously, I can't reveal what happens, but it leaves a bad taste in the mouth. And as this is the last moment we spend in this universe, a bad last image is not a good thing.

Next, we have Matt Damon. I get why he walks through the story as though he is sleepwalking, but it doesn't make his character very engaging. George is trying to stave off the nightmares, he gets nightmares when he has the visions, he has visions when he touches people, and he touches people when he meets them. To prevent all of this from happening, George is simply lonely, preferring to spend many hours in his apartment alone. He spends much of his time working in a factory, driving a forklift. Throughout, George walks through the film as though he wishes he were dead. And to portray this, Damon simply keeps his face blank or impassive throughout. It isn't real engaging to watch one of the more engaging actors of our generation walk somberly through the storty.

The best part of the film, involves a cooking class George decides to take at an Extension program. There, the chef (Steve Schirippa) teams him up with Melanie (Bryce Dallas Howard). Over the course of their relationship, we see illustrations of everything we are supposed to know about George. These moments gives us a better idea of who and what George is supposed to be in twenty minutes.

 I wish there had been more of these moments and fewer moments of George walking around with a dour, pained expression on his face. This would have increased the pacing of the film and helped to move the story along, making the overall film better.

Cecile de France (come on, is that her real name?) plays Marie, the rancorous journalist who is famous for raking her interview subjects over the coals. After she begins to have her visions, she decides  to investigate and finds the study of the after life, of the hereafter, has never been taken seriously. She decides to write a book about it and shelves the other book her publisher has paid her for. Naturally, he is reticent to publish something ""more suitable for the Americans"". This is an interesting idea, but the storyline eventually plays out as something barely plausible. Because the study is not taken seriously, she investigates and has long conversations with her boyfriend, with a doctor, with other people. In an effort to make this part of the story work, these long conversations and investigations have the opposite effect. Instead, Marie's journey becomes an illustration of an old stereotype of French culture. People sit in groups and endlessly discuss.

It isn't a great idea to include tons of interviews and discussions in a fiction film. Film is a visual medium and should illustrate a story with images, with action, with movement.

Also, we don't really know what Marie was like before. Before the tsunami. Before the visions. All we know is that she is famous. What would have really helped this story is to show us an example of how Marie used to be, perhaps grilling some company executive on her television show. This would provide a nice counterpoint to the interview she conducts after returning from vacation. Her producer tells her to rip into the subject. But she can't concentrate and lets him off easy.

The story of Marcus and Jason is the most interesting and the most believable. The McLaren brothers, who play the twins, are very naturalistic giving us a look at how two real brothers might deal with the situation. As Marcus deals with the Foster system in London and his attempts to contact Jason, everyone around him seems very natural as well, as though we might be eavesdropping on a conversation.

You may not be aware of this, but Eastwood has been very involved in the music of his films for decades. This passion led him to direct ""Bird"" and he has scored and or composed the music for many of his films. Lately, he was also started to play the music, plucking out chords on a guitar in the background. This worked during ""Gran Torino"" (and Eastwood even sings during the closing credits) but in ""Hereafter"", this same guitar playing, selectively used throughout, only serves to make the pace of the film seem even more somnambulistic.

Essentially, the ""Hereafter"" is not a place I want to visit again and that isn't something I have said about a lot of Eastwood's films.",1288224000,6,7023,4.717781402936378

The intutive,and insightfullness of Muzzlehatch,well he was right on.......I will not
be lenghthy in my comment.  Regardless of your upbinging, and I am referring to any religous teaching or thoughts, this film is about life.....what we know, have been told by those who have experienced the ""near death"" and have lived and how each of us choose to use this knowledge in our own lives.
The slowness of the film is not a deterrant, it is refreshing, gives you time to appreciate the completeness of the emotions and reactions.  In praise of Clint Eastwood, would anyone expect anything but the very best from this man of character?  A film that will be in my mind forever.",1288137600,6,738,4.661538461538462
4388811,4,B004IWR06S,"Yes this movie is slow, and I was surprised by the subtitles in the beginning.  However, I liked that it wasn't obvious how the subplots would reconcile themselves (like in most movies today), and the acting is very good, the story is interesting, and the movie is ultimately moving and rewarding.

I also enjoyed being introduced to actor Cecile De France.  Although she was new to me,she has starred in numerous films in Europe, and I have already started reserving some at my local library.",1288137600,3,493,4.776470588235294
4388812,1,B004IWR06S,"Don't let the exciting ads on television for the ""Hereafter"" trick you into thinking this movie is anything close to an enjoyable, interesting film, this movie is a worse disaster than the tsunami depicted in the opening scenes. To be honest, this is one the worst films I have ever seen and it was torture for me to sit through it for over two hours reading subtitles and trying to understand heavy British accents, along with other negative aspects of this film too numerous to mention.  You have already viewed the best scenes of this film (the tsunami) on the tv promos, the rest of this film belongs on the Warner Bros. garbage heap.",1287964800,10,638,4.5964912280701755
4388813,5,B004IWR06S,"A tsunami rushes in on an island resort where Marie (Ccile De France) and Didier (Thierry Neuvic) are staying.  Both survive, but Marie almost drowns and has a near-death experience, with ghostly light and indistinct figures...George Lonergan (Matt Damon), an apparently psychic American in San Francisco, is pushed into giving a reading for Christos (Richard Kind), a business associate of his brother Billy (Jay Mohr); George resents doing it, claiming that his ""gift"" is really a curse...in London, twin brothers Marcus and Jason (Frankie and George McLaren) struggle to help their drug-addict mother (Lyndsey Marshal) keep it together enough so that they don't get taken away by the social services - but fate has tragedy in store for them.  Three stories, linked by death, gradually coming together, gradually influencing each other.

The bulk of HEREAFTER is about coping; George copes with his unwanted abilities, feeling isolated from his brother and even from the attractive and interested young woman (Bryce Dallas Howard) that he meets at a cooking class.  When she thrusts herself on him and pushes him into making dinner at his place with her, she finds out a bit of his guarded past, and the results aren't what either of them desire.  Marie finds both her relationship with Didier and her job as a television journalist faltering, as she decides to write her dream book about a late French politician but can't forget her near-death experiences; and Marcus struggles with loss and even comprehension as a child who feels his life cut in two.  Very gradually, all of them are drawn in similar directions, emotionally and eventually physically.

Clint Eastwood's 31st film as director is, like a large percentage of his work, concerned with death.  Strangely enough though this film marks an inversion or reworking of many of his previous concerns, in that death begins the film, is at the very heart of the lives of most of the main characters - and yet, ultimately, is less oppressive and less a tragedy or even endpoint than it is in most of his previous films.  In almost every way, the film starts out in major keys and works its way towards the minor chords, from loudness to quiet, from tragedy to possibility.  It's a film very much imbued with the literary and musical worlds - strands of opera impinge periodically on Eastwood's fine low-key score, and De France's character is a writer and journalist while Damon's is obsessed with Charles Dickens.  Cinematically, it works out as a very un-dramatic drama, and even the coming together of the three plot strands seems inevitable and preordained as a literary device rather than the movie-thriller that the misleading advertising promises.

The film is going to irk a lot of people because of its slow pacing, and its refusal to come to anything definite in regards to the questions posed throughout.  And there are going to be people who are serious skeptics and cynics who won't like the hints of the extraordinary throughout the film - which remain, for the most part, just hints.  But this is not a film trying to come up with any answers to life's ultimate questions - Eastwood and screenwriter Peter Morgan aren't interested in such simple pieties, and they are wise enough to know offering such bones for the audience wouldn't let their characters off the hook.  These are people that have to live with the facts of death and what it means to those who survive - even knowing what comes afterward, if anything, wouldn't necessarily make the daily business of getting on with things any better.  And all of them begin to realize this over the course of the film; if there's a definite message here, it's that while the conversation about death and it's meaning is a worthwhile one, it's this business of living and overcoming our dark obsessions with the afterlife that is important, and that makes our lives in the here and now worth anything.

HEREAFTER is put together with Eastwood's habitual economy and grace; as has been said many times about his work, it's a film with nearly invisible direction.  This might not always be a compliment, but in this case it very much is; apart from the big CGI tsunami at the beginning and a couple of other important scenes that I don't want to spoil, the camerawork is never ostentatious, never gets in the way of the characters or feelings, which are just about all the film is concerned with.  The focus then is on the actors, and they do not disappoint.  This is the best piece of large-ensemble acting that I've seen in a while and it may be the best cast Clint has ever put together.  Bryce Dallas Howard is extraordinarily charming and winsome in an ultimately unfulfilled role; Ccile de France is luminous and conveys a careworn look that seems to age her a decade from her first scene to the rest of the film; the British cast members are all terrific and I'd especially like to cite Lyndsey Marshal for a small but powerfully moving portrayal of a woman on the brink.  Matt Damon, though, is working on a level that echoes his director's work, disappearing into his role so completely that he had me completely feeling for him from the beginning.  He is ultimately the engine that drives the resolution of the plot, and yet as a very passive and introverted character it's a challenge to make it believable that he would be able to push himself as he does in the last scenes in the film; somehow Damon conveys that inner power and specialness with an ordinary - deliberately ordinary - exterior in a way that is riveting.  I've rarely seen an ""average Joe"" who is so compelling.

And it's the reality imbued in these special-yet-ordinary characters that makes the last few scenes, aiming for a magic and transcendence that I'm not sure I've ever seen Clint Eastwood attempt - and that few directors in Hollywood today are capable of or interested in attemptin - work.  If you weren't pulled in, put on the edge of your seat by this slow, somber but intense film, you'll probably find the ending stupid.  If like me you really feel like all this contemplation of death, and the futility of really understanding it, has made the small fantasies and artifices in the film fade away and left you with some kind of higher truth - however indistinct, like Ccile's blurry deathly visions - you may well be enraptured, as I was.

It's unfortunate that the trailer for this film seems to promise something like this summer's hit INCEPTION; and given that more people know Matt Damon for the ""Bourne"" films than anything else, a lot of people will be expecting a thriller, something with sci-fi or fantasy overtones, excitement, effects... They're not going to get it.  If there's a model to compare HEREAFTER to, I'd suggest the last few films from the great Japanese director Akira Kurosawa, who like Clint Eastwood made his name with films dealing in violence and action, but ended his career on a quiet, reflective and humanistic note.  It's a tribute to how great a filmmaker Eastwood has become that he can stand in such company.

One of Eastwood's best films, and my favorite film of 2010 so far.",1287878400,112,7124,4.786296900489396
4388814,5,B004IWR06S,Hereafter is a movie that makes you think in many different way. It is trully a movie that should and will be watched many times. Death is a topic that makes most people nervous but this movie puts into a light that I have never seen. I just say it at the theaters and I came out of the movie astonished. I am personally afraid of death but this movie did not give me that sense. I would say this is the perfect movie that all movies should be like...,1287792000,7,451,4.022222222222222
4388815,4,B004IWR06S,"Many of us have a terrible tendency to pigeonhole filmmakers into the genres we think they're best suited for. When I first saw the trailer for ""Hereafter,"" I, like much of the moviegoing public, was unpleasantly surprised at the thought of Clint Eastwood having directed a supernatural drama. Given his recent triumphs with films like ""Mystic River,"" ""Million Dollar Baby,"" ""Changeling,"" ""Gran Torino,"" and ""Invictus,"" it just didn't seem like something he would have or should have done. As usual, I was reacting impulsively; ""Hereafter"" is an incredibly strong film, in large part because Eastwood resisted the temptation to treat it as a thriller. It certainly has mysterious elements, but for the most part, it's a poignant, thought-provoking story of how different people react to traumatic circumstances.

The common thread of the story is death - or, more accurately, what awaits us after we die. Although glimpses of a spiritual void are revealed, neither Eastwood nor writer Peter Morgan makes any grand claims as to what it is or how it works. In other words, the film assumes the reality of life after death, but it doesn't linger on details such as heaven, hell, purgatory, or anything else resembling eternal punishment or eternal reward. There isn't even a discussion about the existence of God. This isn't a criticism. We've seen far too many movies in which deathly states are both explicitly examined and regarded with either extreme sentimentality or extreme terror; ""Hereafter"" wisely avoids these clichs, in effect keeping the true nature of death a mystery.

The film is initially structured as three separate storylines, all of which theatrically but cleverly converge during the final act. In the first storyline, we follow Marie Lelay (Ccile de France), a French television journalist for a left-wing political program. While on vacation, a tsunami tears through the resort and sweeps her away, causing a near death experience. (While never directly stated, I'm forced to assume that Eastwood was depicting the 2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami that destroyed coastal cities in Indonesia, India, Thailand, and Sri Lanka.) Miraculously, she's revived. However, upon returning to France, she finds the experience has had more of an effect than she ever thought possible. She can no longer concentrate on her work, damaging her celebrity status. She's consumed with thoughts of life after death, a possibility that neither her atheist lover (Thierry Neuvic) nor her secular coworkers are willing to consider.

The second story focuses on George Lonegan (Matt Damon) a San Francisco factory worker who, after a childhood illness, gained psychic powers, specifically the ability to talk to the dead. He doesn't consider it a blessing, and he flatly refuses to step back into the spotlight as a celebrity psychic. In an Italian cooking class, he strikes up a friendship with a female student named Melanie (Bryce Dallas Howard), which seems like the beginnings of a contrived Hollywood romance until he takes her to his apartment; at that point, a simple but disturbing scene makes his reasons for trying to keep his ability abundantly clear. His brother (Jay Mohr) simply doesn't understand where he's coming from; the way he sees it, George is missing out on a tremendous financial opportunity.

The third story centers on a British boy named Marcus (Frankie McLaren), whose identical twin brother, Jason (George McLaren), is struck and killed after running in the middle of the street. This tragedy is made worse due to the fact that his mother, Jackie (Lyndsey Marshal), is a both drug addict and an alcoholic, forcing her into rehab; Marcus, now alone and in foster care, becomes withdrawn and moody, looking uncannily like the proverbial creepy child from a horror movie - pale skin, sunken eyes, and never a smile on his face. He gets obsessed with finding some way to reconnect with Jason's spirit, thus beginning his citywide search for a medium, someone who isn't merely selling crackpot ideas but can actually speak with the dead.

This particular plotline includes one of the film's best scenes, in which Jackie tearfully but bravely says goodbye to Marcus in the Social Services office. The reason it works so well is because it develops Jackie against our expectations. We've been conditioned by other films to see characters like her as hopeless and uncaring; I was prepared for scenes of emotional breakdowns and irrational behavior, such as her being completely unable to cope with Jason's death and somehow finding a way to blame it on Marcus. But nothing that conventional ever happens - even before her son dies, we see that she's finally coming to terms with her addiction problems, and her resolve only seems to strengthen after Jason's funeral. So too does her love for Marcus.

The ending is perhaps too conventional, although it appropriately challenges George's assertion that absolutely nothing good can come from his psychic abilities. It also nicely plays into the film's message, namely that, regardless of whether or not there is life after death, we must make the most of the time we're given here on Earth. Inevitably, this will involve the difficult but necessary task of moving on after a period of grieving; life is not about staying in the past, but going ahead. There may be certain atmospheric elements of ""Hereafter"" that seem atypical for Clint Eastwood, but in no way do they affect his affinity for strength of character and engaging stories. Don't dismiss this movie simply because of its supernatural overtones. There's so much more to it than that.",1287532800,307,5605,5.11353711790393

Eastwood has shown himself to be a stellar director, and Damon truly is a great actor. But his performance is in this film is entirely muted, meaning Eastwood deliberately directed him to be so. Why? Certainly his character is deeply conflicted, and is consciously denying his deepest self. But Damon is more than capable of portraying that conflict in a more vibrant, compelling fashion (see The Talented Mr. Ripley, for example). Eastwood's motivation for his bizarre direction for this movie is a mystery.

I was hopeful that the movie would pick up and redeem itself when there was about 1/2 hour left, and for a few minutes there was some light in the plot and acting... but then back into the strange muted mediocrity that pervades the 2 hours you will spend waiting to see the Damon we know and love.

This movie has a great premise, and it's obvious why Damon would have signed on with the script and director. It's a huge shame that the promise of the story was squandered through bizarre direction decisions from Eastwood.",1500422400,3,1143,4.738693467336684

4388858,3,B004IWR06S,"The subject matter was very intersting; the acting was great and actors were cast well.

But for being an Eastwood/Spielberg/Kennedy endevaour, it fell short. The story was not well written and the characters were not fleshed out by any stretch of the imagination.

I appreciated the fact that though the featured actor was Matt Damon, the movie was not all about him, they gave ample time for the other story lines. But with that said, maybe it was what caused the story to fall flat. Matt Damon's plot line was barely there and I never ended up really caring about his character.

It was a passable movie, and enjoyed it but certainly expected more....",1484524800,2,654,4.719298245614035

4388870,1,B004IWR06S,"This a movie that goes for about two hours and doesn't really achieve anything.  It's basically three different story lines that of course cross at the end.  One of the story lines is spoken in French with English subtitles, and revolves around a French TV presenter who is on holidays when a tsunami hits.  Even though this is the most exciting thing that happens in the film you can't help but compare it to other Tsunami films such as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Impossible/dp/B00BAYLQI0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Impossible</a>&nbsp;where the wave of water and destruction looks more real.  This one just screams at the viewer, we didn't have the budget to make this good or we don't care much about this scene since the tsunami or its aftermath aren't what this movie is about.  Anyway the French TV presenter gets trapped underwater for a while, as her brain runs out of oxygen she has some visions, but is saved in time before finding out if they are just hallucinations or a glimpse of the afterlife.

Next we visit Matt Damon's character who has been pressured into reading the palms of Richard Kind.  Is he really a psychic who can talk to the dead or just a con artist?  His questions with insisted on one word yes or no answers seem like something anyone could guess with a pretty high chance of accuracy but I won't give away if he actually has abilities or not.  He doesn't want to be doing psychic readings anymore which his brother can't fathom, as he makes more money doing that then his factory job.  But Damon's character wants to learn to cook so much of the movie we watch him in a cooking class where he is partnered up with a young woman, much to the disappointment of the old guy who is visibly disappointed to be paired up with someone from his own generation.

The final story revolves around two young British twins, whose mother due to substance abuse isn't being much of a mother.  Sending one of the boys to get some pills for her results in him being attacked for them by a cowardly gang, but does provide an opportunity for the hatless of the twins to now wear a hat.

Really this movie just goes on for too long. It's the type of movie that if the person you're watching it with falls asleep (which is highly likely due to how boring it is), you'll secretly start fast forwarding it.  It could have been edited down to make it more bearable.  The twins story was probably the most interesting of the three.  The inevitable cross over of storylines was pretty weak and seemed like they couldn't come up with something better.  Plus its pretty unlikely you're going to remember a website you glanced at while browsing the internet, let alone remember the guy on it's name and recognise him in a crowd.",1475107200,,2788,4.715463917525773

I believe that there are people who can do what this man does.  It is just not very well done in this movie. The scene between Matt Damon and whoever it was in the cooking class where the feeding of each other just went on and on and was more and more uncomfortable for all viewers and  was just plain childish directing.  Could she have been more annoying in forcing him to do a reading on her.  After the sappy, soapy unbelievable ending I'm afraid I had one question ""how is he going to support her, is her going to live off her earnings from a book that isn't going to be very successful""?  The whole thing is too contrived, too slow moving and for a lot of it just downright boring.  The fact that a lot of it and particularly the first few minutes of the movie is in French with subtitles.  I had to go back and check to be sure I had it set for English.  Way, way too much stuff in French about where this woman works.  This could have been a good movie.  The way it's done just isn't very good.

Each person fumbles thru their aftetmath, after loss, and seeks an answer, or help, just a small sign, or hope their loved one ' is ok'.  Or so to speak. True mediums somehow know you broke a glass last night, and some meaning to THAT moment. Or you found a momento from your loved one, and left it out this AM, and the medium can describe the moment and item and usually who owns it, etcetera. .  and whatever a medium conveys, its not something found facebook or sounding like astrology predictions.

The idea of using a child to see it from his eyes, as being his tragic loss, the longevity of his loss, viewed through the lenses of the innocence of a young boy, is very powerful and heart wrenching. And just like the topic itself, the movie doesnt give you ready made answers, which is cool. But like the ending, all one can give one self is some sense of comfort over such a loss, and Hope.

A heart rending story from Peter Morgan, produced by Steve Spielberg with impressive actors such as Matt Damon and Bryce Dallas Howard. Even though Damon's acting was a little stiff or seemed 'over acted' at some points, he was still able to pull off the part of a troubled George Lonegan. Howards part seemed minimal and I believed the audience would have liked a little more on her backstory with maybe an extended relationship with George, before disappearing from the screen entirely. It was C&eacute;cile de France with her superb acting and the ability to help me 'suspend my disbelief' that made this movie an empathetic rollercoaster ride with a little help from the McLaren boys.",1446163200,,743,5.0

Big kudos to Derek Jacobi for playing himself in this movie, and to Clint Eastwood, who did a fantastic job in directing this fascinating and worthwhile movie.

Three lives intersect in this drama that is only supernatural enough to the point of feeling very real instead of the often overdone scenarios of so many of its predecessors.

Cecile De France plays a French journalist who survives a tsunami and decides to change the path of her career to find out some will be supportive while many will not.  Frankie McLaren and George McLaren portray twin boys, one who is killed in an accident, leaving the other brother to deal with his loss.  This is another Eastwood venture out of the norm and I am very impressed with this story which calls into question the viewer's own belief without seeming preachy or forced.

I rarely write reviews for movies as one persons symphony is another person's bubblegum rock ... so who am I to say ....  but I was very disappointed in the trailer vrs the actual movie ....  It was an interesting subject for me and I went in without a whole lot of expectation.  But it was so slow .... and if you could find the patience to get past that ... you for sure would try to look for the substance and or character development and interest ....  but NONE ... EVERY character (with the exception of the young boy) was not only boring but had no unique interests and yes, even with one of Hollywood's favorites ... the acting was mediocre at best ... again wit he exception of the young boy...  A waste of money and a waste of time ... my time was better spent watching a re-run of Alph (which is pretty bad in anyone's book .. well, maybe not ... haven't seen ""Alph"" since I was a child ..lol) but truly ... my time would have been better spent tweezing my leg hairs ... and less painful as well.  Even with some attempted humor in this review ... which could be unappreciated or taken wrongly by some... I assure you that I take this seriously and am NOT quick to complain about movies ... but the humor or poor attempts at humor in this review ... was only to try and entertain myself or someone... because this movie does not .. nor does it educate, make you ponder .... or have any redeeming qualities that I could find.. and I looked.

I've never been into foreign movies because I don't want to ""read"" a movie.  If I wanted to read, I would buy the book.  Subtitles are horribly hard for me to read while I try to watch the movie, totally distracting and oft times confusing.  So basically the movie starts off losing 3 stars for all the foreign language.
Then the acting is not all that. I never did understand what was going on in this movie, was confused as to how the different people were tied together into a movie. Very confusing.  And boring.  Very very boring.

4388969,5,B004IWR06S,"This film is a very nicely understated entry in the overused and much-abused genre of paranormal fantasy. Upon first hearing about HEREAFTER, I was not sure Clint Eastwood was capable of working with this tricky subject matter, but I was very pleasantly surprised. The cinematography and choice of actors for the key roles are what make this such compelling viewing; and the artifice of the three interwoven plot lines is so transparent that it doesn't get in the way of the viewing experience. The CGI rendition of the tsunami waves inundating the island paradise was mind-bogglingly realistic (be sure to view the ""making-of-the-movie"" bonus feature; I was astounded to recognize Lahaina's Front Street on Maui buried in the CGI!). The intellectually and psychologically rich plot revolving around the premise of the retired and once-famous psychic coming out of retirement to resolve the three converging plot lines worked very well on screen, thanks to the down-to-earth performance by Matt Damon. Casting C&eacute;cile De France as the once-famous French news presenter turned psychic investigator was an inspired choice: she exuded the fabled mix of sophistication and sexuality of gallic womanhood without looking like a stereotype (frankly, I couldn't take my eyes off her during her entire performance; the camera truly loves her!). The final scene really grabs the viewer: it is the much-anticipated emmotional plot resolution, but it turns out to be a bit of a tease when the credits begin to roll just when you're hoping to find out how the obvious chemistry between the characters plays out. It leaves a lot to the viewer's imagination... and maybe that's what adds to the kick of this gem of a story.",1428192000,,1714,5.146953405017921

Also, the parts that were in french with sub-titles were rather annoying. The scenes went too fast to read the subtitles unless you were really focused on just reading the print, not actually thinking about what was happening in the scene at the same time.

Matt Damon was not at his best in this one. He's such a good actor usually but in this movie, his acting seemed like a sleep-walk, not engaged or particularly believable in this role.

While in the Dead Zone Christopher Walken could do the same but he saw the past and what will be in the future . Slightly different but similar  in the character of the story, that said this is still a very good movie . Yes it is sad , though it makes you think about life and how short and important it is and how important your family and friends really are , and everyday people too. At least that is how I feel and what I got out of the movie ,it is movies like this and the Dead Zone , movies that you think about after you watch them , movies that touch your heart are movies worth seeing and owning in a DVD collection.

4389011,4,B004IWR06S,"Hereafter
 In his dotage Clint Eastwood has transformed himself from squint eyed killer to one of the most impressive movie directors in movie history.  This is his latest in a string of films that are at best brilliant and at worst interesting, provocative and well worth watching.  Hereafter leans to the later end of the scale.
 He is joined in this endeavor by writer/producer Peter Morgan, who also wrote such dramatic successes as The Last King of Scotland, Frost Nixon and the very well received The Queen.  He is able to attract suburb actors to his scripts, in this case the rapidly growing talent of Matt Damon and also French actress Cecile de France.  In the scheme of things, a brilliant script with average directing and acting will result in a good movie experience for the audience.  Thankfully, we do not have to make that trade off here.  Everyone does truly fine work.
 Eastwood is at his directorial best in the opening of the film which includes the only extravagant big screen event, a beautifully made tsunami which sweeps all before it.  The killer wave is fatal to a French TV journalist of uncertain years played by Cecile de France.  She revives but is shaken by the occurrence of being briefly dead, as who would not be.  After the visually dramatic tsunami, Eastwood handles the camera in a way that lets the viewer intrude intimately into the lives of the players.
 The movie proceeds with a deliberate slowness that leaves some in the audience squirming in their seats, awaiting the action sequences.  There aren't any.  But there is a payoff for the grownups that have the patience to wait.  The Damon character is a psychic who can actually communicate with the dead, a skill that he wisely regards as a curse.  Who wants to spend his life mired in the tragedy and deaths in other peoples lives?
 Like Grand Torino, Hereafter explores the ethereal territory that surrounds the big ideas of life.  Why are we here?  Where do we go afterward?  The direction of Clint Eastwood and the writing by Peter Morgan gently guide us on this journey to well, if not to an epiphany at least to somewhere where we can be comfortable.  It is an interesting and worthwhile film.
 Unfortunately they spent $50 million to build this film but its art house flavor has held back the mass audience.  After four weeks in release, it has garnered only $29 million.  Oops.  The PG-13 film (theme of death) runs a full two hours and nine minutes.  I give it a strong three saw blades.",1414713600,,2492,4.6689655172413795

I would describe it as sort of an ad-hoc melancholic documentary of a love story? Maybe? A lot of scenes in French, which I found a bit distracting as the DVD software on my PC has fuzzy subtitles unless I rip the movie. When the end of the movie came I was unsatisfied - not sure what the movie lacked, but I felt it definitely lacked Something.

4389056,5,B004IWR06S,"I almost didn't purchase this movie but when I saw Clint Eastwood directed it my curiosity got the better of me.  I'm so glad it did.
Clint Eastwood had the foresight to give the movie a profoundly thoughtful approach.  Understated is a word I might use to describe it.  By taking his time we get to know each of the main characters more intimately which gives us a deeper understanding of the events as they unfold and each one finds the other at just the right time.  It's got it all; Love, sorrow, life, death and the afterlife.  I have had a near death experience.  It is something you never forget.  This film does everything right.  I think anyone would enjoy this movie.  I highly recommend this movie; but if you're looking for spirit visitations or ghosts this is not that type of movie.  I don't think there was any foul language but the subject matter may not be good for children.  One of the characters looses a brother and he is young and their Mother is an addict.  Depending on the age of the child you may want to save this one for the adults.",1397260800,,1060,4.3520408163265305

4389059,4,B004IWR06S,"I am very color sensitive.  Colors are like food to me.  In this film a beautiful ice blue was repeatedly used in almost every scene. Perhaps the repeated use of a single color was to tie together three very different stories?  This film deals with spiritual questions, ultimate questions, which probably explains why the reviews are all over the place.  It is not an action movie per se.  I am not much of a Matt Damon fan but I have to say I was very impressed with his performance.  It was understated and pitch perfect.  I also like the fact that psychics who exploit others' grief were exposed for what they are.  They give psychics, like Matt Damon's character, a bad name.  I firmly feel that there is a life after death.  I have had experiences that have convinced me so I don't need a film to sell me on the subject.  Having said that I like how this film gently explored the issue without bludgeoning us over the head to accept a concept that apparently is difficult for a lot of people.  One has to ask oneself what it is about our culture that is so dubious about 'spiritual' subjects.  What are they afraid of?",1395792000,,1123,4.393203883495145
4389060,5,B004IWR06S,This movie is so well done and thought provoking.  A warm yet wonderful story set against the chaos life can present.  It implores us to question what and who is really important.  The music is hauntingly beautiful as well.,1395705600,,223,4.666666666666667

Roger Ebert, gave the film four stars (out of four), calling it a film that ""considers the idea of an afterlife with tenderness, beauty and a gentle tact. I was surprised to find it enthralling.""  I agree and add that for myself, it changed my life because it changed my view of death.  My life has expanded as a result of this film.  Also, the tsunami scene at the beginning is a must see if you have a nice size TV and surround sound home theater system.

I love hearing this actress speak in her french accent - but got tired of reading the subtitles (that were Not through the whole movie).
I think this movie is too loose with piecing together these three stories - and waiting to the end to try to do so.

4389090,4,B004IWR06S,"The most difficult part about writing this review was titling it.  ""Hereafter"" is about people who must suppress their feelings because the world can't understand their experiences. They are looking to understand as well.  This is a subtle, quiet, well drawn story from Clint Eastwood.  ""Hereafter"" refers to the main characters' near death and psychic experiences.  Matt Damon and Cecile de France create two very likable characters who live on different continents but eventually meet in Europe.  Their meeting is facilitated by a young boy whose personal loss is soothed by Matt Damon's psychic skills.  There are no explosions or car chases, but the wrath of a tsunami early in the movie is dramatically and amazingly illustrated.  The cinematography is stunning, but the film seems to remain in blues and greys and though the movie is not sad, it is perhaps too subdued for some audiences.  Even the warm and hopeful ending is fitted within this restrained palette. As I imagine the story beyond the end of the movie, after the two main characters fall in love, the golden rays of sunlight splash through the window in the morning!  The soundtrack perfectly illustrates and supports the film--beautiful, but oh so restrained.  Just a little red and orange and another chord to the music could add another note to the film.  I would like to encourage viewing of ""Hereafter.""  I really do like it, and it is very well done.  I believe that being prepared for the utter restraint of the movie may make you more patient during it.  The story is resolved very well.

People have so little appreciation for what genuine psychics do, and how vulnerable and open they must become to give the information that so often people aren't ready to hear.  What started out as a career in which I thought using my god-given talents would heal people, and bring people clarity, has turned into a mostly thankless job.

4389104,5,B004IWR06S,"I have now watched this twice (since receiving it a few days ago).  First of all - thanks, Amazon, for sending a free rental download to my Kindle Cloude when the purchase was made.  I work long hours, with a hefty commute into town - so to be able to begin watching at home, then watch the rest on the train coming into work - wonderful.

The film?  I don't want to give anything away.  Too much information would spoil it.  I can tell you that I sat down to watch this film, no expectations, no idea of where it would take me, or what journey Eastwood wanted to share with the rest of us.

Every new film I see with ""directed by Clint Eastwood"" on it, i find a new aspect to this man that i like - as a director, who knows how to unobtrusively lay out a story, draw the best performances from his actors, have a point.... you may not agree with everything that comes out of this man - I sure as shootin' have a few issues with him - but then i see another one of his films, and thank the maker (or whatever) that he chose to pursue directing as one of his acts of human expression.

And he even scores his films, wrapping the wonderful choices in music he's picked, with musical compositions that come from some special place in his heart, his head - who knows?  Clint Eastwood never ceases to surprise me, and contintually reveals a talent for, if nothing else (and there's plenty!), picking subject matters that others might pass by....

I doubt this movie would have been made without the CE stamp of approval on it.  I am not sure what the audience is out there for such a thoughtful, thought-provoking film.

All i can say to end this ""review"" is:

If you have a hankerin' to question why we're here, where we came from, where we're going, what exactly is it, to be alive, and to be dead?....

This film will not answer those questions for you....

but you will learn that you are not alone in your quest for answers...and regardless of what faith you follow (or not), this film will touch you, likely, give you hope in a way that is hard to explain....

and the (Clint Eastwood) music/theme will haunt you long after the credits roll....He's the Man!....Thank you, Mr. Eastwood....",1374105600,,2189,4.341523341523342
4389105,4,B004IWR06S,"Another brilliant Matt Damon performance in a story that features him as a guy suffering the ""curse"" of the ""gift"" of psychic abilities. His measured display of loneliness and quiet desperation that paradoxically results from his ability resonates throughout.  As does his interfacing with the lives of others at the aforementioned cost to his own happiness ... until he crosses paths with a lovely French woman who has seen ""the other side"" through a near death experience.  And by the way, that lovely French woman (Cecille DeFrance?) is immensely appealing, and very effective as a woman whose life is turned upside down because others are uncomfortable with her sudden sureness about one's fate after death. I give the movie 4 stars - but could easily be persuaded to up that to 5.....

My one complaint? I purchased a top of the line DVD via Amazon - but the product was far from full screen (""letterbox"" I believe is the term) and the volume capacity would challenge an owl.

It is a gentle story about grief and loss, about coming to terms with oneself and accepting one's gifts, and about discovering and uncovering a new way of looking at the world. I was surprised that it was directed by Clint Eastwood, since I don't think of him as particularly sensitive to these subjects, but he is a terrific director and does a terrific job here.

4389116,4,B004IWR06S,"Im rather boggled as to why so many people disliked this film. I think a major reason why is because its been described as some sort of supernatural thriller. Well nothing could be further from the truth. This is not a thriller at all. Nor is it even exciting or particularly ghostly. This is a film that explores the very real questions about death and what really happens to the living who have lost loved ones and not really about the dead. Personally I thought this film was absolutely brilliant. Here Director Clint Eastwood explores a subject far from what is appropraite for a director of his kind. I think the only way Eastwood could approach this story effectivly would be to lay his spiritual inhabitions totally naked and look death squarely in the eye. It seems throughout Eastwoods career he has always chosen wisely in his subjects. His body of work lays a blueprint that speaks about perfect human balance and clarity. Being Eastwood is now in his 80s and facing death not too far off himself, its as if Eastwood has seen a vision of death and wants to share it. Here Eastwood gives us much to think about. The most interesting thing here is that even though the movie revolves around death there is such a calming and full of life feeling about this story. Its as though Eastwood is saying that death is truly only the begining and that he knows there is literally nothing to fear about death. The entire film is so very tender and beautifully told. I loved it, and I think it puts a wonderful layer of frosting on a near 60 year career for this one of a kind human being.

I must admit that I was skeptical about this movie when I read the description, mainly because one of the main characters is a psychic. I'm not really a believer in that kind of stuff, but yet this movie was still very entertaining to me. There was actually a scientific explanation of why the psychic character had his abilities, which was interesting.

I really liked how the movie consists of three separate stories of different people going through struggles related to death. The character development was excellent, and I also liked how the three different characters the movie follows were located in different parts of the world.

I won't give away the ending, but know that the ending wraps up the stories in a very satisfying way for the watcher. This was a movie that I was pleasantly surprised by, which is why I felt compelled to write this review. Hope this helps!",1366156800,,1029,4.679558011049724

accelerate as we learn more about the ""gift"" Damon has, and why he considers it a curse.

The computer-created tsunami that opens the show is almost worth half the price of admission all by itself.  But beyond that, the film's pleasures are for me largely of the travelog variety in that I always enjoy seeing foreign locations such as Paris and London, etc.  The movie's one depiction of the hereafter is limited to a brief enactment of the sort of thing generally reported as a ""near-death"" experience.

Matt Damon plays a reluctant ""psychic"" who has an apparently real ability to see a brief event in his subjects' past, although he's decided that a career driving a forklift is preferable to raking in the bucks doing five-minute ""readings"" for bereaved clients seeking contact with the departed.  Merely holding a person's hands for a moment allows Matt to enter that person's memory for an instant and thereby establish contact with the departed.  Actually, although we see the memories through Matt's eyes, we don't hear the departed talking to him, so his reports in that regard may just be a competent cold-reader in action.  And one wonders what more prolonged physical contact might produce in the way of insight.

On the other hand, it's a bitter disappointment when you consider the talent involved. However you feel in the end, Hereafter certainly does warrant at least one watch, if anything to see why there is such a division amongst viewers. The score is a depressing one. It sounds a lot like Unforgiven's in ways, and all of the actors are as depressing as the subject matter. They do a pretty good job at portraying the pain, grief, and all around hollowness caused by the death of a loved one. It's definitely well-acted, and the cinematography is pretty good as well. Dark and ominous are the best words to describe this one. It's a somber affair. That's obvious when considering the subject matter of the focal point of the three stories that the film revolves around. If you know me and my reviewing style, you know I hate to summarize plot, but I'll say that the three stories build up to an intersection that does absolutely nothing for the audience, or at least it did nothing for me.

You feel for the characters throughout the story, but when they cross paths (after about two slow hours), you are left with a longing. I felt like Eastwood just ran out of story, so he wrapped it up abruptly. *Spoiler* And for a film that is so sad and depressing, the generic Hollywood happy ending pissed me off. Also, the opening sequence looked like something from 2012. Cars flipping down the street, trees falling, explosions in the background, and chaos. Don't get me wrong, it is a good sequence, but it just reminded me of 2012. My major complaint about this movie is that it really just left me feeling unfulfilled. I didn't take anything away from this, not a positive way to sum it up. I can't even explain why they took a supernatural route with it. The ""Herafter"" parts were pretty hokey. I didn't like The Lovely Bones either, but I'd consider watching that one again before this. I'm truly disappointed, but see it if you like Clint Eastwood.

But this remarkable man has earned his best credentials later on in his live, once he assumed his place behind the camera.  Many actors turn to creating their own production companies and directing movies, but none has done it with so much success as Clint Eastwood (and occasionally, Robert Redford). Every single movie that was directed by Clint Eastwood created some form of stir.  Here comes a man who is not afraid to ask difficult questions about difficult (and different) experiences in ordinary people's lives.  He is not afraid to challange his viewers and does not back down from his ideas, not matter how difficult they may be on the audiences.

In this film there are three parallel stories: one is a sotry about successfull Parisian journalist who escapes death, another one is about a young London boy who looses his twin brother to death while his mother ends up in the rehabilitation center, he is sent off to the foster care.  And there is a blue collar worker in NYC who has psychic ability to speak with dead that haunts his personal and professional life.  Each one of them is struggling with their experiences that other people do not seem to understand. They are outcasts in a society that is so quick in labeling people.  Until one brief moment, when lives of these three people intersect and change their destinies from that moment on to hereafter.

This movie promises insights into the afterlife, yet delivers little. From what we see we can expect something like a celestial department of motor vehicles, crowds of people standing around waiting endlessly to be called. And this is supposed to give me hope?!

Probably the high point of the movie came when the French woman broke up with her annoying boyfriend, who is best described as too shallow, too cynical, too Jean Paul Sartre, too much body hair, in short too French.

Hereafter, a bland journey of meaningless chaos and supernatural silliness that will take you absolutely nowhere (and will take its good old time getting there too). All of your unanswered questions about life beyond death shall fade like fragile fragments of forgotten daydreams into the boring blackness of a bottomless oblivion as the screenwriter reveals (eventually) that there are no answers to be found here, no mysteries to be solved, no truths to boldly emerge from the cracked crevices of curiosity to conquer the countless crumbs of contrived content that keep spewing forth like random samplings of a plot-in-progress stuck in the sleepy sap of slow motion until all of the honest of heart witnessing such a dull display of lingering emptiness begin to hope and pray that in the real hereafter, for saints and sinners alike (and everyone in between these two spectral extremes of inner dimensionality), the Creator has perhaps seen fit to let it all beat to the pulse of a slightly less morbid tempo, one where the idea of Death potentially being a transitional modification of living instead of being the final curtain call doesn't come across as a dead-on-arrival script stripped of any substantive qualities (as in introducing any philosophically challenging propositions or explanations or presenting any culturally controversial suggestions or theories) leaving only the anorexic skeleton of an underdeveloped idea that was suffocated by constant exposure to chronic neglect until it morphed into an incomplete torn-package of a production unfulfilling in just about every aspect. It is as though it was an unfinished sketch of experimental improvisation one might expect to find posing as a film school project but never rising above the level of being a platform for mediocrity, a pointless portrayal of a serious subject that no amount of talent in front of or behind the camera could resuscitate.

For the record, the reason I warned that this review contains spoilers is because unlike the traditional spoiler that tells how something ends (such as revealing that ""the butler did it""), my comments deal with a slightly different scenario, one where I am revealing in my own way that I was unable to detect any type of what I would refer to as an ending, at least not any ending that conclusively and satisfactorily summarized or punctuated relevant themes and events that preceded it. But if you have not seen the movie yet, I think it is far better that you personally discover your own unique interpretation of this cinematic experience as opposed to gaining access to my views in advance.

So in a sense it's a story about rebirth--but the rebirths are not at all what anyone expects.

There are three stories, in three locations, and they eventually converge.

In Paris, Marie LeLay has her world exploded by her drowning and resuscitation in a tsunami.  She can't stop thinking about her time in death, and it affects, and eventually destroys, her work, and her (apparently rich) life as a news interviewer and correspondent.

In London, one of an indissoluble set of twins is killed, leaving the remaining brother hopeless and familyless (his mother leaves at the same time).

In San Francisco, George Lonegan (Matt Damon), tries to begin a new life after years of heartbreaking work as a psychic connecting others to their dead loved ones.  (Lonegan himself got his ""gift""--which he regards as a curse--after dying several times on the operating table as a child.)  But this life, too, shatters, when he reluctantly performs one last reading for a woman he meets in his Italian cooking class (Bryce Dallas Howard).  She is unnerved by his ability to see her childhood abuse, and she flees, and shortly after George is let go from his escapist factory job.

With his severance money--job, hobby, and potential girlfriend gone--George decides to follow his love of Dickens to London.  (I knew I would love this movie when I heard George listening to a recording of David Copperfield--one mention of Peggoty, and I was hooked.)  Naturally, he runs into the bereaved twin boy, and also the French correspondent, who has written a book called ""Hereafter"" about her death-experience, and is at a London book fair.

In some ways, the movie is like a Dickens novel--preposterous coincidences and shameless tugs on the heart.

But that is all to the good, because it is genuinely moving and thought-provoking.

4389162,2,B004IWR06S,"Clint Eastwood, with Hereafter, manages to capture that feeling of getting your palm read for $5 on a boardwalk by a fickle old lady with cigarette stained teeth. You are promised a film about disaster, death, and the afterlife; what you end up with is a cheap imitation of all three.

Hereafter establishes the afterlife and the existence of heedful souls. The story follows George, a psychic who communicates with the dead, Marie, a news anchor who writes a book about her near death experience, and Marcus, a young boy who is coping with a death in the family. Their lives are intertwined and significant to one another with their respective fascination towards the afterlife.

The film opens with an earth shattering tsunami that immediately consumes you with a ""I saw the light"" sequence as one of the protagonists is teetering between life and death. You'll be hooked as this seems like a movie that aims to go where most films have not - exploring what happens when you die. If the 2012-esque sequence doesn't hook you, than the introduction to George and his ghost whispering abilities will. Unfortunately, Hereafter is a lot like sitting through the weather report eagerly awaiting the top story that was introduced at the top of the news broadcast. The three main plots are crafted with an almost Halmark card simplicity. They reek of heart wrenching solemnity - supplemented with guitar plucking music and tearful tragedy - but they are all so contrived and forced that there is no emotional attachment to any of the main characters.

Unfortunately, it gets worse. When the three narratives inevitably converge, it is done so in such clumsy, nonsensical fashion. Along with never even exploring the phenomenon of death and the afterlife, Hereafter decides it needs a love story and literally tacks one on right before the credits roll. This film certainly is not unwatchable. There are sequences that are entertaining and well done, but as a whole, it fails by holding back and resigning to mind-numbing Hollywood conventions. Allow this review of mine to serve as a free psychic reading for you- You will walk away from Hereafter utterly disappointed...",1326412800,3,2165,4.975138121546961
4389163,2,B004IWR06S,"To be frank, this movie was a little boring and anti-climactic.
Hereafter follows the lives of three people who have experienced death in different ways: an American man who has the psychic ability to see departed loved ones, a French woman who momentarily died from drowning, and an English boy who lost his identical twin brother in an accident.
While the movie started out very engaging with a tragic tsunami scene, it slowed down afterward and never picked back up. And waiting for the three stories to intertwine was long and tedious. The stories are interesting, but not enough. Matt Damon, Ccile De France, and the McLaren brothers do a good job of carrying this movie on their shoulders, but not enough to save it from its dull resolution. There was a definite lack of payoff when it was all over.

**Spoiler Alert**
I have to admit that the dead little boy was kind of a jerk. He seemed nice while alive, but then became mean-spirited once he passed on. His brother searches for a way to connect with him for most of the film, and when he finally does, the only thing his brother can say is don't touch my hat, you can't rely on me anymore, and goodbye. Jerk.
And I was really upset at the idea that it was mere coincidence that the boy's losing his hat in the subway saved his life. I was happy with the thought that the ghost brother knocked it off his head as the act of a guardian angel to keep him from getting on the train. But then we find out that the ghost brother knocked it off the boy's head because he was mad that he was wearing it and that the boy missing the train was just a happy coincidence. Lame. Again, jerk of a brother.
And what was with the random flash of a kiss between Damon and France? If they were trying to establish the idea that Damon can touch France without seeing visions, we already get that with the handshake and lack of visions when they first meet up in the street after the flash. The scene was completely random and unnecessary. And weird, too.
**End Spoiler Alert**

Overall, the film was a bit bland. The end.

As far as questionable content:
There is a tsunami scene in which several people are engulfed in water that can be a bit traumatic, and there is a scene where a little boy is hit by a car and smashes into a car windshield with some blood splatter. He is afterward lying on the ground with blood running from his head.

4389164,3,B004IWR06S,"I presume the pacing of this film is supposed to reflect the afterlife. I hope not, I don't want to spend eternity with that 'Sunday-afternoon-after-a-weekend-doing-nothing' feeling. Half the problem is that it cant seem to decide whether to be an out and out, if understated, supernatural thriller, or an exploration of the known science of near death experiences. If the latter, Matt Damon's character is as jarring as he is irritating. He is the 'one in 10 billion' or whatever it might be, who has a genuine window into the beyond, except that he won't use the ability, 'I don't want it, it's ruined my life, boo-hoo, poor me' etc. If anyone with his ability does exist, he would single handedly revolutionise our science, stun skeptics at CSICOP and win James Randi's $1,000,000 challenge for scientific proof of the paranormal. Therefore we can probably take it that this aspect is not based on fact.

The French newsreader character was far more interesting, and should really have had the film to herself. She was on a journey of discovery that does seem rooted in genuine experience, and could have been used to open up discussion of the scientific study of near death experiences. The brief scene in the German hospice was a particular lost opportunity. The Dr there was worthy of a wider role herself.

All in all, and interesting and worthy exploration of a field that must fascinate all of us. I'm not entirely sure whether it is appropriate to weave real world disasters that touched the lives of hundreds of thousands into a fictional thesis on the 'Hereafter', but it's great that Clint chose to explore this theme. I'd have done it differently, but I doubt any major studio would give me the time and money... (if I'm wrong, let me know)",1326067200,,1754,4.785478547854786

4389166,5,B004IWR06S,"There are essentially three very moving tales in this excellent film. Viewers hoping to learn about what happens to people after death, whether there is something or nothing, will be disappointed, because this is not the film's purpose. The hereafter is a backdrop to the three tales that Clint Eastwood directs and Matt Damon acts in very well.

One story is about the character played by Damon. He discovers that he has the ability to see and hear a dead relative of a person who he touches. But he has no idea where the dead person is or what life is like after death. He is traumatized by this ability. He feels that it is a curse rather than a blessing. He realizes that his ability helps others and makes them feel good, but he feels that it ruins his own life. He wants to live like other people. He doesn't even want others to know about his ability. We see an episode where he is virtually compelled to use his ability and the effect that it has on him. He is searching for a normal life and we watch to see if it is attainable.

The second story, which, as the third, ultimately entwines in Damon's story, is about a highly successful French female reporter who is pronounced dead after being drowned in a tsunami. She experiences the well-known phenomenon of a person seeing a white light and moving towards the light. However, she recovers. She has difficulty getting over what she has seen and it affects her life.

The third tale is about two male pre-teen young twins. They are unusually close; very loving toward each other. This is especially so because their mother, who they love dearly is an alcoholic and uses drugs. One of the twins is killed when a truck hits him, and the other mourns him greatly.

4389173,5,B004IWR06S,"I am not usually one for fantasy films about psychics and the afterlife, but this one has such depth  that I could suspend my disbelief and feel completely engrossed in the emotions of the characters.  I have never seen acting so fine and vivid in this genre.  It is moving, beautiful, mysterious, and psychologically real.  I think it is a masterpiece.

The film starts with the 2004 tsunami that devastated Indonesia.  A French woman is swept up in the wave, receiving a terrible blow in the head that brings her near death while submerged.  What she sees changes her life, alienating her from her past and its certainties.  She loses everything.  Meanwhile, we learn about a young man from San Francisco, a psychic who is searching desperately for a way to live and love with his ""ability"".  Every time he sees a potential relationship, it seems, his ability destroys his chances.  He is not helped by his brother, who is pushing to exploit his ability as a business concern.  The third character is a boy, whose mother is a junkie and who loses someone near to him.  He is pitifully depressed and seeking answers while in fostercare.

How their lives intersect is the plot of the story.  However, the theme - of being able to move on with one's life - is wonderfully evoked by Eastwood, who is one of the greatest filmmakers alive.  Every gesture and expression of the 3 characters moved me, their struggle and melancholy totally believable, at least to me, as they search for resolution and a way forward.  It brought tears to my eyes, perhaps because I lost my father not too long ago.  The film actually helped me to mourn.

I gave this film a chance, because it is 'made' by Eastwood and it stars Matt Damon. That, I thought, would at least guarantee that it is not outright stupid. It isn't.
Actually, once you start with the beginning and the South East Asian tsunami pulls you in, and the heartbreaking story of the London twin boys with their addict single mother, it is hard to walk out, though Damon's part (the psychic)tries hard to demotivate me.
We have three threads in Paris, London, and San Francisco leading to a unified ending via a London book fair. Whatever the realities behind the ghost world, Clint tells the story well.

The opening scene with the tsunami is quite impressive; unfortunately, the rest of the movie doesn't quite live up to it.  The ending is predictably Hollywood as far as much-too-neatly tying up all the loose ends with a happy and fortuitous twist, but again fails to present or support any coherent theme or thrust behind the story.  There is simply no subtext at all---it's very much a straightforward, what-you-see-is-what-you-get kind of light drama, kind of a Public Service Announcement to raise awareness that hey, people who almost die usually report the same visions and there just might be a couple of genuine psychics out there amid all the fakes...not exactly breathtaking new information.

Cecile De France is a gorgeous woman and feast for the eyes, but aside from that this is far from Eastwood's best work.  All the same, I do not regret renting it from Blockbuster.  I definitely would have regretted purchasing it, however!

I would put this one somewhere in between those two.  As far as the movie itself, it was well written and well directed, believably acted and of solid quality.

I saw it again a few times when it was on HBO.  Every time I viewed it, I was able to see the layers within the storyline.  I definitely love this movie and will order it on DVD.
Interwoven among the concept of the afterlife, is the story of three unrelated people from 3 different countries (USA, France & England).  It is ""death"" for them that changes their lives and makes them rethink their concept of what it means to be alive and that nothing or no one is permanent - and we need not fear that, but celebrate the times we had with someone - no matter how brief or long as a gift - instead of the pain after the loss - it also speaks of forgiveness and the evolution of the spirit, who realizes mistakes made during a lifetime even after death.  It also draws upon the concept that we are all connected and that death is not the end, but the beginning of something else - the movie does not answer what this beginning is, because it leaves that up to the viewer based on their own belief systems. It just seeks to portray spirit life as a cycle even after death - whether that means heaven to someone or whether it means the spirit learning and coming back for more lessons and connections.
In the storyline, we have the psychic (Matt Damon), who has a gift that is really a curse for him, because he cannot have normal relationships, as everyone sees him as a freak and/or only needs him in order to communicate with those that have passed.  He is the ""real"" deal as far as psychics go - he developed this ""gift"" after a bout of illness and surgery as a child.  All he wants is a connection to being alive - a normal life - and to have a relationship with someone who understands him as a human being and that what he knows is not a freakish gift, but is a lesson that others who have experienced near death experiences already know - a universal consciousness of the continuity of the spirit.
We have the french television journalist, who experiences a death experience during a tsunami, and changes because of what she experienced.  She has to seek another path, as she becomes ostracized as a journalist for trying to discuss and write a book about her experience after researching documented data.
We have a twin boy from England, who loses his sibling and his rock as the children of a mother who loves them both, but has addiction problems.
The story is about the eventual interaction between all of these characters.  It not only involves issues regarding death, but our connection to everyone because of death and because of life.  It is also a love story and the concept of how although we think we are alone, we never are - not only with those who passed, but those who live among us.",1319932800,2,2878,4.320964749536178

The scene of the tsunami was filmed in Kihei, Hawaii.  What was funny was the locals they got for the parts of the shop keepers in the big market, the guys on the boat, all local Hawaiian residents.  The place was never given a name, but even that the place seemed to be a south seas country, the English spoken was really good, and this didn't detract from the movie one bit.  The music is lovely.  The twin boys are great.  The French woman was sweet and smart and subtle.  What I found good was that the ending is solid.  You know what's going to happen even though it hasn't happened yet.

There are, after all, hundreds of people who have had Near-Death Experiences (NDEs), and yet no one seems at all comfortable discussing these things.",1319500800,3,759,4.5777777777777775
4389183,4,B004IWR06S,"From my pov, this is a fairly good movie. The premise of the existence of a 'hereafter' is intriguing and this movie takes a unique approach, but it works only to a point. The script tells the story of three people whose lives will briefly intersect and carries the viewer through the process of what brings them together, but in the end it really doesn't make any attempt to answer the question of is there an afterlife and what happens when people die.
While I found the ending oddly plausible, it seemed to veer away from the main theme of the movie.
I gave this movie 4* because despite what I considered an uneven ending, it had an interesting script. The actors were very good as was the direction, the photography was stunning, special effects ranged from awesome to haunting, and the movie had a european feel to it. What kept it from being ultimately memorable was the somewhat low-key conclusion that wasn't completely satisying.",1319068800,,939,4.696969696969697
4389184,5,B004IWR06S,"Clint Eastwood has cemented his role as one of the best story tellers in Hollywood right now. See other reviews for a synopsis of this movie. If you love good old-fashion Hollywood story telling, this movie is for you. In many ways, Star Wars killed story in movies. George Lucas stated once that if you keep the story moving fast enough, the audience will not question the plausibility of the events. He meant that if the pace is quick, no one will question the logic of the story line. Eastwood's Hereafter returns the story to pre-Star Wars Hollywood, the late sixties and early seventies, when most studio executives had book publishing roots. Most studio executives today have MBAs and law degrees. And most repeat the successes of other movies. Any movie that elevates the story to pre-Star Wars Hollywood, gets an automatic ""A"" in my book. This is a great story that progresses logically. You become interested in the characters and the story. Great movie. I hope other examples follow.",1318032000,2,993,4.847058823529411

George Lonegan (Matt Damon) can do no wrong in my eyes and directed by Clint Eastwood (who also wrote the musical scores), and with Spielburg as the excutive director,  made the near Sci-Fi thriller experience come off smoothly.  I have watched this twice tonight and enjoyed the second time more than the first. The story is sound and the near death experience was treated logically and not over done. Matt Damon's clairvoyance and ability to read peoples minds, by just a touch, was also treated well and added depth to the story line. So with the story, acting, directing and presentation makes this video a winner in my mind.",1317686400,,697,4.75206611570248
4389186,5,B004IWR06S,"""Hereafter"" is an amazing movie. I can't understand why it's generated such mixed reviews. The only thing I can think of is that the film was a lot different than I thought it would be based on the movie trailer, which made it out to be a scary thriller. It's not that at all. The movie revolves around three people living in three different countries who all are affected by death in some way. One man is a medium of sorts and has the ability to communicate with the dead. A woman survives a near-death experience that changes her life. And a young boy is lost after the death of his brother and is desperately searching for answers and reassurances.

I thought the movie was great. It tackled this sensitive subject matter from multiple perspectives and was incredibly moving at times (I teared up during some of the Marcus/Jason scenes). Clint Eastwood is amazing, and ""Hereafter"" is just one more of his brilliant films.",1317513600,,924,4.634146341463414

Matt Damon, who must be one of the most reliable, down to earth and watchable actors working today -and the wonderful Cecile de France, a very talented actress with a broad range, who charmed us in the delightful 'Avenue Montaigne' (aka Orchestra Seats) a few years back.  I also must confess that Cecile is one of my favourite actresses.  I have seen this movie twice so far and intend to add it to my DVD collection (or Blue-ray when I get one).",1317340800,2,734,4.856

In a culture where so much of our popular entertainment is in your face, hits you over the head or is just plain imbecilic,  something like this is such a welcome relief.  My advice...go along for the ride and just savor it and appreciate what the characters are doing.  They are just looking for justification and answers...the same as any of us.

4389191,4,B004IWR06S,"""The Hereafter"" (2010) is directed by Clint Eastwood. The film focuses on the lives of three people and how they eventually intersect. Mat Damon plays a Clairvoyant who has been trying to leave that side of his life behind him, and there is a television journalist (Cecile de France) who has a near death experience, and then there is a young boy whose brother's death has left him feeling alone. This movie is less about what possibly happens after death than how people with a common interest and need come together to share their special bond. The main characters in this film seem isolated, and lonely, and alienated from those around them because of their particular unique experiences. In this way the film is really about how people connect in this life and bridge the gap between their various islands of experience.

No answers, no final revelation, no deep insight. 60% of this should've been left on the cutting room floor. The rest should've been thrown out.

4389193,5,B004IWR06S,"Any Clint Eastwood film is going to be masterfully crafted. So, the content is what one may like or dislike, but rarely is the film a bad product. And this film has a great story, and a superb craftsmanship. With, to my surprise, the main music being done by Clint, and in the extras, you can see some of the theme music being played by clint.
  Given its unique material, the first film I thought was similar to it was AFTERLIFE; with the caveat that AFTERLIFE is a first film, and so is not as refined as the material, and the execution of this film. HEREAFTER delivers a quality supernatural undertone without this wonderfully chilling element subsuming the character driven content of Clint's film. The way the story weaves together three people's lives and eventually brings the two leads together, is both brilliant on the film level, and emotionally fulfilling on the personal level. The dramatic tones are a superb experience on the heavier side ( the supernatural elements) as well as the themes of loss relating to the young British actor, and the French actress who visits a character who is remarkably like Dr Elizabeth Kubler-Ross ( in some respects, not all). For AFTERLIFE, and HEREAFTER, my comment for the AFTERLIFE review was that the coment ""get a life"" applies; well, Afterlife achieves this in a heavy handed way, and HEREAFTER achieves this in a dramatically fulfilling way, with a style few people can manage. Also, the extras on the DVD are great, they shows elements that I would suggest you don't watch until after seeing the film, since the they show how the strong and very realistic images are achieved.

Clint Eastwood has done another great piece, very strong on many levels, and whilst it achieves the surreal elements I prefer, it also gives the heart ache of the personal experience in its sadest times.",1314403200,3,1837,4.788643533123029
4389194,4,B004IWR06S,"To believe or not to believe ...
Is that really the question?
I believe it's the asking of these questions(and others), the desire to explore possibilities, open minded people, & creative beings that can bring such a seemingly heavy topic to an artistic level making it both inviting & intriguing!

I'm always skeptical when an award winning actor becomes a director/producer.
Even the great Clint Eastwood!
I'm not one to seek out movies for that specific reason...however, I do have to confess that I'm a sucker for a handsome & talented actor such as Matt Damon!
I watched the movie's preview a few times before I finally decided to give it a shot.  It was one of those nights when not much jumped out at me & I decided to give something I might not normally watch a chance!  Good thing I did so!
I have the attention span of a butterfly - I see something shiny & flutter off to the next shiny object.
So, to say that this movie captivated me from start to finish is no great feat!  I was pulled in & held in a state of wonder.  I've never been on one side of the coin or the other of the idea of psychics or whether there is a white light, life after death, or hereafter.  But, I pride myself on keeping an open mind in every aspect of my life possible.  So it wasn't a far stretch to sit back, open my mind & take in the cinematic beauty of this film's message.
The story & its characters are seamlessly sewn together to form a breath taking fabric.
I enjoyed having a leading actor such as Matt Damon who talented enough to carry a movie but also was able to let the other characters of the film shine through.
To me, director's such as Ang Lee & Clint Eastwood are some of the select few directors that come to mind that you can instantly tell that music plays a strong piece in their attempt to tell their story!
I enjoy a movie that tickles all of my senses, keeps my attention, leaves me in a state of wonder & has me wanting to persuade friends & family to watch it too!
If you have an open mind & an open heart I highly recommend you watch ""Hereafter""!",1314144000,,2064,4.236641221374046
4389195,1,B004IWR06S,"Clint Eastwood had an idea when he filmed Hereafter; instead of cutting the parts of a story where nothing happens and showing the parts where something happens, he would do the reverse; the result sucked. It sucked like my life minus all the good parts.  I was thinking about bad reviews I would write halfway through the movie. In this respect, the movie was inspirational.  I think I did good, much better than I would have had the movie been any good...at all.  I'm watching the last part right now.  Guess what?  It's freakin' boring.

I'll give it this.  This movie is great for contemplating things that are not this movie.  Like Mario.  I have this weird itch to play Mario, and I don't play video games.  Isn't that weird? And wow!  As I write this, the film introduces a character named Yoshi. No joke!  Does the film want me to play Mario??  Is this the point?  Is it like subliminal?  Does Clint Eastwood have a contract with Nintendo?  If you slow the film down enough, will we see freeze frames of Mario doing cool stuff?  Will freeze frames show Clint Eastwood being all like ""play Nintendo""? Is there such a thing as too many consecutive rhetorical questions?  If you watch this film, you'll be thinking things like this.  And more.  But they will be your thoughts, because you have your own mind.  For example, my girlfriend was telling me how badly this film needs Betty White.  These were her thoughts.  Make some of your own. My response, by the way, was to say how badly this film needs not to suck.  You too can have such conversations with your friends about this movie.  Except of course, you will rarely actually talk about this movie.  My girl and I, for example, got into long tangent about the merits of The Golden Girls.  As I said, this movie is great for stimulating discussion and lively talk about things that are not this movie.  You, of course, need not talk about the Golden Girls.  You can speak of things that interest you.  You can reconnect with old friends, play truth or dare, or reconcile old differences that once got between you. You might even make a friend, develop a deep connection, get into a fight, and lose the friendship all while this movie is playing. It's pretty long.  And boring.  You can watch it in groups so you watch the drama unfold amongst the audience. (By the way, this movie is still rolling.)

I'm starting to hum little songs in my head now.  Maybe I'll take a nap.  I'm sure that you can daydream a little bit and tie up any loose ends I might have left open about the film.  Matt Daemon is in it.  Maybe that helps.  He sucks in it too.  But at least you know he's in it.  Some chick from Spider Man is in it.  I'm doing this to tell you a little about the movie, since it's a review.  The guy from Sopranos who became a cook is here.  He plays a cook.  Someone said that was the best part...the part where he cooks.  He might be right. My sentences are too short.  Oh, the movie is also kind of about death, psychic powers, and has French people.  Spoiler alert, in the end, nothing happens.  Okay I'm off.  It's time for you to watch for yourself and dream your own dreams.  While you sleep.

This philosophical view is the thread that ties this movie together, a movie that attempts to move beyond it but leaves one, if one is an unbeliever, unconvinced.  Matt Damon plays a psychic reader with a specialization in contacting the dead.  He no longer practices because he sees it as a curse rather than a blessing.  The movie's plot moves lethargically towards its conclusion, where eventually Damon and the other two main protagonists life's intersect.  The viewer is left wondering, at first, how this will ever happen, and one feels as if one is watching three different movies with only the weakest link between them.  There were some problems with the script: a potential paramour of Damon's is overplayed by the actress; there is a scene where, for someone who is insistent on not discussing his life as a psychic, Damon goes into an excessive soliloquy about the very same subject.  This and the general loose connections among the characters left me very unsatisfied.",1312502400,,1132,4.890052356020942
4389197,5,B004IWR06S,"The even spread of 5 star through 1 star comments here reflect the subjective experience of the viewers more than any film I have seen recently. Now in his eighties, Eastwood directs a film whose theme lies close to heart of all people who have matured as they have aged. It is a reflection on the possibilities of the afterlife that we all think about as we age. Eastwood offers no answers but instead gives us 3 parallel stories of people who have experienced death or near death; a woman drowned in a tsunami, a psychic who sees his ability as an affliction, and a young boy who loses his twin to death. Each protagonist searches for answers, as we all do. Viewers may not be satisfied by that lack of concrete solutions but a film about death and acceptance can have no other ending. Some viewers may be fooled by the opening tsunami sequence into thinking that this is an action film. The absorbingly realistic set of CGI sequences that open the film makes other CGI laden films look artificial and lame. But it  is not an action film though studio marketing may have given people that idea. In lesser hands a film like this would be filled by after death pseudo babble that has been all to common in American cinema over the decades. Entertaining but trivial films such as 'Ghost' are pedestrian but pleasant to watch. TV shows like 'Medium' were light silly but enjoyable time wasters. Eastwood does nothing like that here. Instead this is a film for people who think, those who are at the end of life, and those who have had life threatening experiences. Highly recommended.",1312070400,2,1582,4.590106007067138
4389198,4,B004IWR06S,"Clint Eastwood is certainly one of the most iconic people on this planet. As a actor he has has had some memorable roles and lines, as an director he is in a class by himself. Most of his films that he has directed have repeat viewing value and some have become classics. At an age where most people could barely walk, to have such a prolific directorial flourish is simply amazing. His latest work ` Hereafter' is abut death, tragedy, the effect it has some people and their attempts to cope with it, thus continuing his obsession with death. Three divergent story lines across three different continents are merged together in a ending.
Marie ( Cecile De France) survives a tsunami but finds that he life is falling around her. She is unable to cope with her relationships, her work and life when she returns home after this tragedy. George Lonegan ( Matt Damon) is a psychic who forsakes fame and riches he could have had as a psychic when he realizes that his gift is more like a curse and prefers to lives in near obscurity. Finally there are Marcus and Jason who are struggling with their mother's alcoholism and are struck with a life altering event.
The segment of Marcus and Jason was the most touching, and warms your heart to feel this brotherly love. The other segments are fine and well acted. The Tsunami scene is the great and probably the most fast paced in the entire movie. A common grouse amongst the viewers of this movie is the slow pacing but I felt that was necessary and keeping up with the theme of the movie. The tone of the photography is extremely muted and brightens up only towards the end. The actors are great and Matt Damon slips effortlessly in to his role as a psychic, the kids Marcus and Jason are incredible as well.

""Hereafter"" (2011)
----------------------------
Matt Damon stars as a reluctant psychic who has the ability to connect grieving people with their dead loved ones, but feels his talent to be a curse. His story intersects, unevenly, with two other people who have had recent mystic experiences. This film was ""artful"" and deliberate to the point of lethargy, and the Altmanesque shifting between parallel plots was surprisingly clumsy and artless. Moreover, the big ending was a real letdown - instead of saying anything about the afterworld, other than that it exists, Director Clint Eastwood tries to blow our mind by telling us that even the psychic has no idea what lies beyond.  Wow. Welcome to the club, buddy. Instead, the plot is resolved by a simple, unexplained romantic liason, bluntly provided at the last moment with no motivation other than the dissatisfaction that Damon's character feels because his burdensome, spooky ""gift"" keeps chasing women away. Yes, there is something to be said for understatement and anticlimax as dramatic tools, but Eastwood overdoes it in this film, a problem made worse because the script is so bereft of vigor or depth.

Hereafter is three stories woven into one movie, one storyline follows a depressed former psychic who is trying to put his days as a professional medium behind him as he do not want to live with death anymore, however there are always pepole with sad stories showing up and asking for readings, the second story follows a news reporter who barely survived the Asian Tsunami and is haunted by her near death experience, the third storyline follows the young son of a drug addict who lost his twin brother in a car accident and who in turn becomes obsessed with death. Each of the main characters becomes involved with death in their own way and try to figure out more about the hereafter.

Min main problem with this story is that it tries the wrench tears from you, however since every, single character in the movie is so tragic it get ridiculous other than sad, everyone had either suffered a great loss, has been raped, have lost their siblings, are drug addicts, are depressed or in other ways their lives suck, the movie stand and screams look at all this tragedy, give me tears and give me an Oscar! Fortunately the Oscars did not bite and neither did I.

All in all this movie have a near concept, and under all the tears and grime and depression it haves some good moments, the problem with Hereafter is that it tries way, way to hard, also for a over two hours movie it get very boring as it is just way to slow. The concept of three pepole who have each been touched by death in their own ways who are seeking what lies beyond is interesting and is what made me buy the movie in the first place, however why do every single character have to be tragic, the stories of the three main ones drown in unnecessary emo drama and what would have been a great speculation on life after death turn into an uninspiring, depressive tear wrencher.",1309219200,,2062,4.525469168900805

Now, if she had done more than just see quick blurry visions of people walking towards light, it would be more believable.

It is not preachy and does not knock heaven or hell or any religion down your throat.  It is, quite simply, a look at the part of the life cycle known as death through the eyes of three people who all experience it in a different way.  After watching it, I felt serene and secure.  Matt Damon, in particular, gave a dazzling performance.  His performance was subtle but impassioned and I don't know why he did not receive more praise for this.

The first thing that shocked me was that it was an Eastwood movie.
I didn't think this was his sort of thing but he did an excellent job here.

Here is what I liked...
Excellent performances from the entire cast especially Damon.
Beautiful direction.
An interesting story.
You really have to be interested in the subject of the paranormal to enjoy this movie.
Most movies usually make this subject out to be some sort of joke but that is thankfully not the case here.
We get three stories that are interwoven and everything wraps up into a neat little package at the end.
I have heard other people say this movie was boring and nothing happens.
I disagree....nothing happens, everything sort of unfolds...
A patient viewer will be rewarded by this movie.
If you're expecting a ""Bourne"" flick, go elsewhere.
This is a VERY slowly paced movie, there's not a whole lot of action, just a whole lot of emotion and story which for once is a breath of fresh air.

The only thing I didn't like was the ending.
I DID NOT want the movie to end that way, I won't give it away but I found the ending to be rather annoying.
For a movie with so many loose ends for it to wrap so nicely seemed to contradict the entire movie itself.
That minor gripe aside, I found it to be a beautiful movie on a an interesting subject.

An egocentric French journalist, twin boys trying to care for a substance-abusing mother, and a young woman haunted by her abusive father stumble along toward a nonsensical conclusion.

Matt Damon plays a genuine medium (oxymoron?) who is trying to break away from a lucrative career as a psychic consultant because of the pain it all causes.  Damon is not convincing. Perhaps he should have worn some exotic headdress. A long beard that glows in the dark?  A high-tech crystal ball?

Obviously, an aging Clint Eastwood, sitting atop the world amidst his fame, accolades and wealth is beginning to grapple with what may come, if anything, after his own demise, when it uncertain he will fare as well as he has in his present life. Through this film Eastwood attempts to move the viewer toward accepting the view that ""all"" (asserted by Ccile De France's character); all of us, no matter what we have done, end up in a light-infused netherworld where we float lighter than air (but of course there is no ""air"" there, strictly speaking).

I have no control over what Eastwood believes about an afterlife, and as a Christian I would not want to control it, but outrageously, Eastwood throws Christianity under the bus to create conflict in this film; for where there is no conflict, there is no story, no story - no profit, no Academy Awards.

Ccile De France's character (a French journalist/media star) has a near death experience; it transforms her life and the conflict arises when her desire to publish, in book form, her experience is opposed by reactionary forces including the ""religious lobby"". Now if you are so naive as to believe that in America, let alone France, there exists a ""religious lobby"" that could pressure a publishing house to not publish someone's views on an afterlife, then I suggest you go grow up. Simply go to the Amazon.com advanced search engine and type in ""near death"" for ""All Categories"", and you'll find that the ""religious lobby"" has not been very successful from stopping anybody from publishing anything they like about life, or absence of life, after death.

Apparently what Eastwood is trying to convey is the likely truth that people who try to convince others about an afterlife, or what it is like, based on alleged near death experiences may meet with skepticism from many people, including from ""religious"" people, including Christians, like me. So apparently, if I as a Christian tend to dismiss the significance of near death experiences, than I am bigoted and closed-minded (so much for freedom of religion). I could point out  there where many reliable witnesses to Christ's resurrection, but I don't go around bashing persons who remain skeptical.

The other big problem I have with this film is that lack of depth brought to the suggestion of everyone, without exception, enjoying this blissful afterlife. In this film a child molester is depicted as doing just fine in his afterlife, although he begs forgiveness from his still-living daughter for molesting her. Did any Hollywood deep-thinker ever consider the contradiction between the notions of sending a child molester, whether repentant or not, to this delightful light-infused netherworld, but this same person IS seeking forgiveness from his daughter? Which is it? Do people need forgiveness or not? If we ""all"" go to a pleasant netherworld, why seek forgiveness? We can rub shoulders with Mother Theresa and Pol Pot in a great big happy clam bake; no judgment, just happy times.",1305417600,,3093,4.996116504854369
4389231,5,B004IWR06S,"Yes, the movie addresses the issues of an afterlife in interesting way, possibly requiring that one does a little more research to see what information is truly out there, since the number of people brought back from near death (i.e. near-death experiences) is huge. But the movie is more of a rich character drama and weaves a story of how the characters eventually interact, which is vibrant and facinating. I found that adding real life scenarios, the 7 July 2005 London bombing and the 2004 Indonesian tsunami (which brought back memories of the incidents) added to the realism of the film. Also, the fictional character of Dr. Rousseau (Marthe Keller) seemed to be based on Dr. Elisabeth Kbler-Ross (Swiss-born psychiatrist, a pioneer in Near-death studies and the author of the groundbreaking book On Death and Dying (1969) and who also encouraged the hospice care movement).
Clint Eastwood, as director, is  confident, smooth and accomplished. The original music by Mr Eastwood is appropriate, romantic and beautiful (and of course, the 2nd Piano concerto by Sergei Rachmaninoff is seminal and profoundly romantic). I loved the film (possibly with one or two hiccups and a bad attitude towards organized religion) for what it conveyed, the grounding of a supernatural subject, and the penetrating character studies.",1305331200,2,1322,5.235849056603773

This movie would have been better if there was more concentration on Matt Damon's character and what lead him to unhappy life, inability to have a relationships... instead of just constantly referring to it.  They go into insanely boring minutia on the woman's and boy's life, but not of the other main character?

I feel that if they had less info on the other book she was going to write and various scenes demonstrating her distraction (we get it already) and more on maybe her relationship with that guy (who was he to her really?) and how they were close (were they) and then disconnected after her experience, then that would have been more meaningful.

With the boy - a little less about the situation with social workers and adjusting to a foster home and maybe a more satisfying reconnect with the brother during his reading would have been more satisfying.  Because it seemed to drone on forever before getting to the point.  The person I was watching the movie with about an hour into it asked ""What is this thing about?"".  That is a bad sign.

I'm a fan of Clint Eastwood, whether he's acting or directing. Hereafter almost tempted me to see it in the theater, but generally negative reviews made me wait for the Blu-ray release. After finally seeing it, I think I know what caused the negativity. That said, it worked on a number of levels for me and met the expectations I had when it was originally announced.

So why do some people dislike it?

The first reason is the trailer. The use of the tsunami scene and the train accident suggest that the movie will contain plenty of action. It also hints at a fantasy aspect and that viewers will see the afterlife depicted. In reality, these incidents merely set the scene for what the characters are dealing with.

Another potential problem is the story structure. Similar to movies such as Babel and Magnolia, Peter Morgan's screenplay introduces strands of a plot which eventually meet. One of these threads frequently uses subtitles as the people involved are French. The pacing is fairly slow and we are allowed to see things gradually develop.

The final reason is the resolution of the individual stories. Eastwood allows room for us to speculate what will happen to the characters as they move on with their lives. It's not a traditional Hollywood ending where every loose end is neatly tied up.

There are three main stories:

Marie (De France), a French news anchor, has a near-death experience in the first six minutes of the movie, but ultimately survives a tsunami. It changes the way she thinks about her life and she can't focus on her job and normal activities. She wants to write a book about the experience.

George (Damon), who lives in San Francisco, has psychic ability and used to perform readings. He wants to forget that part of his life and have a normal job. Unfortunately, that's not easy to accomplish. His ability hinders his chances at normal relationships and his brother, Billy (Mohr), encourages him to reconsider his decision to stop giving readings.

Marcus and Jason are identical twins who live with their alcoholic mother in London. When Jason is killed after being struck by a car, Marcus has to deal with the loss. His world is crumbling around him and he looks to various psychics to help, but all are shown to be fakes.

As the story progresses, it switches more and more rapidly between the three threads. We suspect that the three main characters will eventually meet and interact, but it's not clear how and to what degree. I won't ruin that for you.

Death is a complex and thought-provoking subject. What happens when we die? Is there something more? What would you say if you could talk to loved ones you have lost? How much stronger might the feeling of loss be for someone losing an identical twin?

Eastwood makes some good choices in this movie. After the opening tsunami sequence, the story is the focus rather than special effects. The casting worked well and the main actors did a terrific job. Damon seemed completely natural in his role and De France also gave a strong performance.

Rather than trying to show viewers what the afterlife might look like, Eastwood shows us very little. It's left to our imagination. All that is made clear is that George is having psychic visions and those are handled in brief flashes similar to Christopher Walken's character in The Dead Zone. The story explains what happens to the three characters at a point in their lives and nothing more. Again, the right choice. Any resolution to the three story threads would have felt tacked on and superfluous.

Video Quality 4.5/5
While the tsunami sequence doesn't look totally convincing - despite the film receiving an Oscar nomination for visual effects - it isn't a fault in the transfer. Some of the cinematography is beautiful and colors appear bright and natural. Detail is strong and this is one of Warner's stronger transfers.

Audio Quality 4.5/5
The lossless DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 mix doesn't disappoint either. It's at its loudest during the opening tsunami, but background effects all come through clearly and dialogue is perfect. I had to turn the volume up a few decibels more than for most films, but the presentation is even throughout once the appropriate level is selected.

Special Features 4/5

Step Into the Hereafter: Focus Points (42 minutes, 1080p) - Eastwood and Damon go into more depth about some of the choices made for the film.

The Eastwood Factor - Extended Version (128 minutes, 1080p) - A look at Eastwood's career, available in HD for the first time.

I completely understand why some reviews were negative. If you're the type of person who enjoys art house films and contemplating your existence, there's a chance you will get something from Hereafter. If you have a problem with slow-pacing, subtitles and unresolved plot threads, pass on this title.

It was a pleasant surprise for me and something that I will definitely revisit before too long.

The film reaches high for answers it can't possibly deliver but, still, reach high it does, to satisfying effect. Had I not known this was a Clint Eastwood joint beforehand, I never would've guessed (although the spare guitar recalls the theme from ""Unforgiven""). It can't be a coincidence that he took this subject for what has to be one of his final films.

Cecile de France, as one of the leads, is gorgeous to the point of special effects, and the opening scene -- an astonishing depiction of a tsunami that struck Indonesia in 2004 -- is one of the most moving, most harrowing sequences of the past year, amazingly executed.",1304812800,,950,5.006329113924051

4389239,4,B004IWR06S,"I just viewed this movie and thought it was very nicely done. I was really surprised (pleasantly) that Clint Eastwood was the force behind the film. As an author/journalist who is married to an intuitive (who recently stopped giving personal readings after two decades) the material was familiar and comfortable, and offered understanding and insight into what those who are in touch with the other side (as well as those who want to be) experience.

I felt the film portrayed many of the emotions and traits of the ""psychic,"" the people in the business of representing the ""other side,"" and the clients quite accurately. Many of the reasons Matt Damon's character gave for stepping away from the needs, dependencies, and emotional demands of people burdened with loss were valid and understandable. While people certainly need help in reaching those who have passed, for an intuitive to deal with grieving, desperate folks every day, knowing that giving them what they may need to hear (from those who have passed) may not necessarily be what they want to hear, this takes a great toll on those who authentically provide this service. The complexities of this situation were well portrayed in the film.

What I especially enjoyed about this film was the way it was set up to offer an example of synchronicity in life, with three disconnected lives that all had wounds from personal tragedies, three seemingly unrelated stories, that, in the end, came together (as they were meant to) to complete pieces of each life's destiny. While one reviewer saw the end as a typical Hollywood ending, I felt it perfectly illustrated how so many events and seemingly chance meetings provide opportunities and perhaps pre-destined openings for us to find our true paths. I felt the two adult main characters would go on to write a better book (as well as a better story for their lives) and this book could not be written without the seemingly chance intersection of all three lives. The boy asked the question, the psychic didn't truly know the answer, the woman had been there, but she needed help to fully round out the experience. All three were important and necessary for the end result to occur.

Just as portrayed in the movie, these events happen every day--every single day--if we are open to recognizing them. I was happy to see that the creators of this film recognize that and found a way to offer that vision to the world, for those ready to embrace it. While many who were looking for action and adventure and typical Hollywood fare seem to feel cheated (evidenced by several reviews on this site), perhaps a second viewing, seeing the film's potential as a story about what is happening beyond the surface of our world (and our lives) would offer a deeper understanding of how naturally synchronicity works, when we are open to it.

Good job to the folks who created and offered this film to the world at a time when it helps us to make sense of tragedy and provides a journey into what is possible if we reach out to each other. For those looking to view an example of the journeys that many are taking at this time (either knowingly or not), this is a nice movie to help with understanding the potential and possibilities for growth.

Those who still need some questions answered, ones that weren't as easily recognized by all viewers in the film, are welcome to discover them at the Answers From Above site (our communicated messages for the world), a free source of hundreds of actual messages from the ""other side,"" many that answer questions like those posed in this movie. I only mention this because the film demonstrates how so many people are searching and are unable to find authenticity in information while on their quest. Answers are out there and few should have to weed through the inauthentic when they need help and solace, especially when people are lost in their grief, just as the young boy in the movie was, as well as the clients chasing after George.

The movie starts out great as the three stories are introduced.  I was hooked and looking forward to all the possible angles, theories that could have been analyzed about death, dying, and our ultimate stop.  It didn't happen.  It was a story about how death affects three people and the emotions that go along with losing someone, even if that someone is you.

4389243,4,B004IWR06S,"The Hereafter is a subtly-layered American movie with a foreign flair that glimpses into a continuing beyond death.

The movie follows three people as they deal with elements of death, life, and love.  It interweaves the stories of the three people together in a suprising ending.  It plays on the themes of death, life, relationships and loves like a jazz song that is at times sad and inspirational.

The three main characters are played wonderfully, especially the younger actor who played the boy.  The cinematography is excellent with locations adding to the plot of the movie.

This movie really highlights Eastwood's versatility as a director.  Why?  It harkens back to earlier movies and shows his exploration as a director.

The three stories coming together as one at the end made it easier for me to understand what each person was going through either in their grief or search for the meaning of what they were going through.  It is hard to fathom this unless you have gone through something similar in your own life.  Each of the three main characters had to face rejection, either personally or in their business lives.  Even the little boy felt he was rejected by his mother.  Each wanted answers and I believe in the end they got what they wanted.

I liked the way Eastwood wanted us to understand that death and dying isn't the end, but perhaps just another path.  Very spiritual movie in my opinion and I really wish people would have accepted the ideas a bit better, since there are people who have gone through near death experiences for decades. I also like the fact that Eastwood explored something about death since he is 80 and perhaps is ready to let go of what is here on this side.",1304294400,2,1051,4.331632653061225

4389248,4,B004IWR06S,"I won't repeat anything the top three reviewers have to say about Hereafter.  I will simply add that the three stories of the French journalist brought back from death, the English boy trying to learn to live without his twin brother killed in an accident, and the American, Matt Damon, attempting to ignore his gift of being able to connect to the spirit world do come together, if only briefly, at the end of the film.

Matt Damon's character is at the center of this film.  Damon knows that when he touches people he occasionally sees visions and hears voices from people who are dead.  When he shares his visions with the living they tell him that he has truly contacted a dead person.  This is dangerous territory for Damon who is confused and upset by his extraordinary power to connect with the dead.  He refuses to use his gift, which he calls a curse.  Instead he escapes to London where he meets the journalist and the boy.  No surprises here.  From the beginning we knew that the stories of the journalist, young boy, and Damon would come together if we were going to be able to make sense of the story and arrive at a satisfying conclusion for the movie.

This film has generated mixed reviews on Amazon.  Some viewers love it; others hate it.  I must say that I thought Clint Eastwood did a good job on a most difficult subject.  Even though the film was slow paced, that is, after the opening tsunami sequence, it kept my attention throughout.  The film makes clear, at least to me, that a spirit world does exist and a few people are able to connect with it.  Some people will find this dramatization of the reality of the ""hereafter"" convincing.  Others will point out that it is simply a movie and has no truth value.  The former are likely to be entertained by Hereafter, the latter, bored and disappointed.  Eastwood might well be in a third group who are unsure about what happens after death and who are willing to entertain a variety of points of view on the subject.  This third group is unlikely to be convinced that a spirit world is real, but they may well be entertained by Eastwood's presentation.

Damon's character George Lonegan, a man who works on the docks of a shipping yard while possessing the ability to contact the dead, is a strange guy who no longer wants anything to do with the John Edwards' or Uri Gellers' of the world.  Once a professional psychic making tons of money, he now wants only to live a quiet life apart from the hereafter and in the now. The problem is that every time he touches someone, their past is revealed in a kind of watery cinematography that Eastwood clearly favors over the stereotypical ""flashback telepathic vision"" scenario.

His brother Billy (Jay Mohr) is a man who rightly or wrongly feels differently and wants George to return to the I See Dead People Business.  Not only, he reasons, might this garner some cash--his brother is the real deal and in one of the most affecting scenes in the film, Lonegan gives a private reading to his a co-worker of his brothers' coming directly from his deceased wife.

Cecile De France plays Marie LeLay, a famous French newscaster who is happy, famous, beautiful and all until she has a sudden vision of a tsunami while on vacation with her agent.  What exactly she sees may be open to the interpretation of the viewer: her own death?  The apocalypse?

Because of two chance encouters--what makes this film touching and believable is that it adds an all too human dimension to the otherworldly subject by portraying quite worldly concerns, perhaps the most memorable of which concerns two small London boys with a heroin addicted mother--LeLay and Lonegan are brought together.  What happens at the end is certainly left open to the viewer's interpretation, though something big is definitely about to occur both in the metaphysical and worldly sense for the two protagonists.

This is a film which stands on it's own merits stylistically but also delivers a message that needs to be sent: that those who quest for the afterlife, for the ultimate, are not to be laughed or sneered at.  Have we come so far that we can no longer believe in anything but the material world?  Why, then, do we watch people running around on television with glow lights and EVP monitors?

4389253,5,B004IWR06S,"I have been trying to figure out why this film got so many bad reviews, and I think it really just comes down to subject matter. One of the characters in the movie is a journalist who has a near-death experience in the Indonesian tsunami, and then starts to probe research on near-death experiences, and comes to believe there is a conspiracy against the material getting out. I don't know if there's a conspiracy, but certainly very few people really want to contemplate death in the way this film does. It is not light and fluffy. And although it does posit the idea that there is something more for us after death, it doesn't offer an idea of what that might be. In other words, it refuses to give us a superficial, heart-warming, or comforting dogma to take home with us. It probes people's experiences with death and the other side, including in the form of a reluctant psychic played by Matt Damon, and it probes human suffering, but it doesn't necessarily give us a dimestore happy ending.

I have to admit, after the first 20 minutes or so of the film, I wasn't sure I wanted to go on. It is sad, the characters suffer, and they are sad. But I'm so glad I continued to watch, because there is a richness and truth to what they go through, and the individual seeking they each embark upon, which brings them all together in a beautiful way in the end. I also felt the performances and special effects were all excellent.

So no, it is not your typical feel-good movie, nor even your typical paranormal sci-fi type movie. It is a spiritual human drama, and if you are willing to stick with it, I think it is well worth the journey it takes you on.",1303689600,,1653,4.416393442622951

4389255,2,B004IWR06S,"I have liked almost every film Clint Eastwood has directed, but with this story, he made lots of choices that just did not work for me. First, a word about the successful parts: I sympathized with the main character played by Matt Damon, a reluctant psychic who would like to ""retire"" from the practice of giving readings but who keeps encountering people who need the hope that such contacts bring. I used to give readings myself. I was trained in my mid-20's in a small church of the American Spiritualist Association, in Albuquerque. I did mediumistic readings frequently for two years, never for money, and only part-time. Many people claimed that what came through me, but not supposedly from me, was helpful. However, I grew uneasy with the practice over time, and gave fewer and fewer until doing my final one in 1984, eleven years after first learning how. I met people who only wanted their pre-determined beliefs confirmed, and people who wanted ""guidance"" way too frequently, and people who ""channel-shopped"" until they got ""spiritual permission"" to do what they wished to do anyway. So Matt Damon's dilemma in this film resonated with me.

Ah, but Mr. Eastwood, you mucked up this tale of moral conflict mightily. The first two-thirds of your movie is so terribly slow, and sad, and much of it is in French, and I almost gave up on your film. Not everyone in grief is so paralyzed that he or she talks in whispers without need, or makes every physical motion take twice as long as it should. There was no real cause to make one character French and spend so much time in the details of her news anchor job. No real cause, either, to make another character British, and spend so much time showing his mom's drug abuse. All these atmospherics and opportunities to show the skylines of Paris and London do not add enough to your story line to justify the time you took doing them. I found neither the French woman nor the English boy sympathetic enough to make me root for them overmuch. The last 40 minutes were pretty good, but a film with such a title and theme should have expended more screen time showing and explaining the hereafter and less on the unpleasant details of the earthly lives of your characters.",1303603200,3,2224,4.673469387755102

A sophisticated individual who thinks for themselves will love this film.  Those that delve deep into life will love this film.  All others will not as its too complex and nothing gets blown up except for a powerful opening sequence involving a Tsunami.

I was a bit surprised to find the onslaught of negative reviews.  I thought for sure everyone loved this too.  I've come to the conclusion that the negative reviews are from those that were expecting some kind of pointless blockbuster.  This is not a fast paced action film involving a cast that looks like cardboard models.

I highly recommend this to those that are looking for a well crafted and intelligent film.  Those that are young, limited or particular will not like this.

Her character is totally lame and unlikable (and so is that douche she's dating in the film) and worst of all, the subplot is boring as hell. She just spends time thinking about her magical escape from death in the opening tsunami scene, which should have been looped continuously for two hours, as it would have been better than the B/S we got.

Then you have Matt Damon's subplot, which plays like a really bad episode of Ghost Whisperer. Seriously he should have won a razzie, his performance here is so bad it's beyond surrealism. He is basically this psychic who can talk to dead people, and he meets this messed up hot chick in an Italian Cooking school, a subplot within a subplot that is soon left to die. I really can't remember what happened in this subplot, it was so damned uninteresting.

The ONLY interesting story was the British kid. I'll admit this movie was a bit of a nostalgic rush for me (which may be why it gets one star as opposed to 0) because a week before I watched this movie, I was in London and Paris for vacation. But this was an interesting substory, as he loses his twin brother, lives with a drug-addled mother, and has trouble adjusting to life with a new family. I'll admit there were a few humorous scenes and his search to talk to his brother was interesting and had me wanting to know more. Actually the movie could have been this and it would have worked a solid 3/5 off the bat.

And then the ending where it all comes together is just LAME!!!! If I am going to sit through a movie with 3 subplots with only one being even remotely interesting, I want a satisfactory conclusion. And don't get me started on the Romatic Comedy puke-fest of an ending. It brought back painful memories of ""The Tourist"".

An Oscar-nominated tsunami opens the film nicely and segues into the more conventional storyline.  Eastwood's direction is understated and unobtrusive, allowing the strong performances to drive the film.  Matt Damon is excellent and generous, not succumbing to his star power nor trying to dominate the movie.  Cecile de France brings a haunting strength and eloquence to her role and the McLaren twins are heartbreakingly convincing.
I wasn't totally impressed because it seemed dull at times and almost too restrained as if Clint was trying to overly arthouse his direction.  I also didn't care for Bryce Howards or Jay Mohr's performances.

I think I'd rather have a root canal than sit through this movie again.  At least with that kind of oral surgery, something new and 'interesting' would happen.

Matt Damon plays a 'retired' psychic who finds his special talent is more of a curse than a gift.  Gee, we've never seen that before.

We have a French woman who really has no business being in an American movie.  And by that I mean, the story itself did not require the character to be French, did not require the viewer to read half the movie as it was spoken in French.  The story, such as it was, would have been perfectly well served had the Marie character been played by another American who spoke English.

And just what kind of a story is it?  Well, given the title and trailer, you might think it some kind of supernatural story about life after death, about what comes next.  But the movie really only glances on the subject, and offers absolutely nothing new at that.  It's really more of a romantic drama than anything else.  Except there's not a whole lot of romance going on...or drama for that matter.  It's two plus hours that only George Costanza could love - a show about ""nothing"".

I thought the stories were going to prove to have some sort of clever, complex connection, a la the disparate stories in ""Crash."" But the ""Hereafter"" is a let-down on that score. Characters from the three different subplots do end up crossing paths, but their final encounter turns out to be more a matter of geographical coincidence than anything integral to their back stories.

The common thread of these stories is supposed to be a quest into the nature of the afterlife. But the consequences of each character's questioning turns out to be - inconsequential.

Matt Damon plays a true psychic who rather vehemently and inexplicably refuses to give readings anymore, even to the point of slamming the door on a bereaved mother who desperately wants to make contact with her recently deceased child. Damon doesn't give any sufficient reason for giving up his work as a psychic and becoming a construction worker instead. He mumbles something about not wanting to live with death all the time. But this denial of his ""gift"" seems essentially inexplicable and perverse. His budding romance with a young woman who might have made some sense of it all evaporates into thin air. Her sudden defection from the San Francisco cooking class where they met is not sufficiently explained. She's just in the picture one minute - and gone the next.

Then when the Damon character does relent and gives a psychic reading, the kinds of communications he extracts from the beyond are inane. ""She wants you to be happy and remarry."" ""He says this weightless thing is really cool."" Why would the departed wrench themselves from the spirit world simply to convey such banalities? And why would the living find such comfort in these pronouncements, other than seeing in them a reassurance that their loved one still does exist somewhere, in however tedious a frame of mind?

The theme of the Hereafter rests on one further bit of illogic. When the French investigative reporter whose life is featured in the first vignette nearly dies in the tsunami that hit Thailand - we see her near-death experience as consisting only of the sighting of vague, filmy characters lined up like stelae, reaching out to her from some cloudy afterworld. However when she revives, she says the experience changed her life. Why would it?

Each of the three vignettes is very well-acted, and would actually have stood on its own terms as an absorbing, low-key insight into the everyday life of a distinctive personality. There's the French news anchor living a very Parisienne life. There are identical twin brothers living with a heart-warmingly dysfunctional/functional mother in England. Then there's Damon's psychic character turning his back on his visions. We see details of each life and each setting that draw us into personal knowledge of the individuals, like well-written essays draw us into a feeling of personal acquaintanceship with the authors.

But the attempt to unite these separate lives with the overarching theme of life-after-death proves to be a bit too forced. The keystone of the Hereafter is just too weak to brace this film into anything substantial and long-standing.",1302912000,,3248,5.039106145251397

Director-Producer Clint Eastwood, born 1930, is approaching that journey to the ultimate unknown. It is only fitting that he should, through compelling subplots, examine some of the known aspects of 'passing away' as told by those who were clinically dead, moved on for a few minutes, and were then jolted back into their bodies.

The ""boring slowness,"" of which some viewers complain, is time well spent in not only developing the on-screen personalities of the five leading characters, including the brooding George Lonegan (Matt Damon) but also, to a limited degree, their psychological makeup.

It's also unfortunate that we have become so used to films moving along at a fast pace. Many of the great films were made by directors like Eastwood who took their time and let the story develop at a natural pace. This way you get to feel the impact of the story, and also you care for the characters. Many of today's films are poorly edited and have no flow, they jump from one scene to another too quickly. There are several amazing scenes in this film, including the opening scene, the romantic feeding scene, and others. The film has depth and comes together beautifully at the end as the characters lives cross. This is one of those films that is under appreciated now but I expect will gain stature over time, as many great films did.

4389277,4,B004IWR06S,"Over the last few years, I've learned to appreciate Clint Eastwood's work, now more for his directing than the movies he's starred in the past. Don't get me wrong, he's had more than his share of hits as a great actor but as he continues to direct and make movies of all types of genre, his work just gets better. As in the case of Hereafter, I was fairly surprised that he would touch on subjects like these - life, death, what happens after? If you're looking for an action movie, this ain't it. There were some great special effects in the beginning which was bold but yet tragic cause it reminds you of what's happened before. The movie starts off slow but the ending is well worth the time spent watching. I love how the movie factors in chance so that all the main characters somehow meet to help each other at the end. Also, the film never touches on Religion, God, Hell, and Heaven but simply leaves that idea to you. Matt Damon, of course, great as always! For those who like movies that makes you think about the ""what if's"" and movies that make you reflect on ideas that you don't normally think of, watch it! I'll be waiting to see what Clint Eastwood comes up with next.

I liked the melding of the story line with age old question what happens after we die. The acting was good and the characters were well developed.

4389280,5,B004IWR06S,"NO SPOILERS appear in this review!! Hereafter is not an action movie, nor does it pretend to be. As the title suggests, this movie is about the hereafter. Clint Eastwood, as director, skillfully weaves three stories about the hereafter together in this one film. (Think the academy award winning ""Crash"".)

There are one or two places where I thought the film was just a little slow, but as soon as the thought entered my head, wham, a major event happened in the movie. This is one of those movies that speaks volumes about life and death (if you liked ""The Life Before Her Eyes"" -- with Uma Thurman-- you'll like this.) My recommendation is definitely see this movie, preferably with your cell phone and all other distractions off. I noticed a few negative reviews on here for the movie, but I really think those negative reviews were from people who saw Matt Damon was in the movie and figured it was a Bourne Identity type film. (It isn't.) Once again, this is not an action movie. But it is DEFINITELY not dull at all.

Regarding the Blu Ray quality, it was very good, crisp, and clean, the outdoor scenes (great locations by the way) definitely pop.

I made sure not to include any spoilers, even about the outdoor scenes, because I purchased Hereafter just because I passed by a giant billboard for it for what seemed like months-- and I didn't know a single thing about beforehand, and LOVED it.

What I got was a bunch of random nonsense that didn't amount to anything in the end. This movie was boring as hell. It was painful in the way it kept going on and on and going NO WHERE.

Now there a lot of people claiming that most others didn't get it, now let me tell you something, those people are just egotisitc snobs, alright? I understood to an extent, what this movie's message sort of was. Personally, I felt like it had to with a little bit a destiny and peace with what we don't understand. And that message isn't terrible, the movie is. Now some interesting things happen, one guy, one girl, and one british kid all experience death in their lives. The girl was pulled into a tsunami and had a near death experinece, the british kid's twin brother was hit by a car, and the guy, or Matt Damon can talk to ghosts from the other side. Now to tell you the truth, I did expect an Action-Triller or some big important adventure to save the world or whatever, but what you get is three seperate storylines who barely overlap. I understand the importance of the british kid and the girl's storylines, but Matt Damon's lengthy backstory (which is about 97% of his part of the film, what he does before he meets the kid and the girl) was completely unnecessary, and should've definetly shortened. In fact half of the movie towards the end should've been altered, in my opinion. It takes them forever to meet! It's agonyizing when you know they'll eventually meet, but it'll take more than an hour to do so. And I feel like they were leading up to something like how important life is or to not be afraid of death, since the girl had a near death experince you'd figure she'd have some question about the afterlife, and Matt Damon will answer them...but you won't hear anything. Seriously? I thought that was suppose to be the big important thing of the movie, in fact if I'd written it, it would've been, and it would've been revealed a lot eariler. But the real climax of this movie is more realistic and super natural but natural enough for us to relate to it. Now I feel that I might want to give this movie just one more star because some people could relate to it in some vast minority, but since I'm not part of that group, this movie really sucks, it's something you watch once, and I'm not even sure the people that liked it will watch it again, I suggest you stay away from it and look for something worth your time",1301788800,8,2349,4.439814814814815

I don't understand the disappointment so many felt towards this movie, but I highly recommend it. It's not a fast paced thriller or action packed movie, but a serious movie meant to be taken and slowly digested. Do yourself a favor and watch it.

Rather, Hereafter sets a premise, but does not follow through with much character development, and has no ending.

there is a good idea (several actually) floating around here, but the movie is slow, plodding. we have to wait a long time for the inevitable: that these people will somehow connect, and share something. a great subject, just needed to be told with more urgency, ""magic"" even.

4389291,4,B004IWR06S,"Clint Eastwood's Hereafter tells three parallel stories about three people affected by death in different ways; Matt Damon plays American factory worker George, who is able to communicate with the dead; Cecile de France plays French television journalist Marie, who survives a tsunami  and Frankie and George McLaren play Marcus and Jason, an English boy and his elder twin brother who suffers a devestating loss and goes on a hunt for answers.

Eastwood is careful not to offer any answers on the afterlife in his film because as he says at one point there are no answers to offer. He tells a good story that forces the viewer to evaluate his own ideas on death and what if anything comes after it. The film is much more than a meditation on death it is a carefully drawn portrait of how death affects people no matter where they are located nor whatever is their place in society.  One of the interesting things that Eastwood does and is to be congratulated for is that he chooses to present his French segments in French with subtitles rather than pandering to those who feel that everything must be in English this gives the film a feeling of reality.

The film is not always easy to watch but it does provide a good oppurtunity for discussion. The Blu Ray disc  presents the film and a series of focus point videos dealing with the production. Of special interest is the video which deals with the creation of the tsunami effects for which the film got its only Oscar nomination. Other featurettes deal with skeptics and mediums and a short on twins. This is an excellent package for a film that gets better on repeat viewings by a director who seems to be contemplating his own mortality.

George (Matt Damon) is a psychic with an ability to speak to the dead loved ones of those he touches. And young Marcus (Frankie and George McLaren) from London loses a dear family member in a tragic accident, and begins to search for answers to what happens after someone dies.  Each of them will begin a journey that will converge in their search for what may happen in the hereafter.

The first scene of a violent and catastrophic tsunami is certainly the most moving and tragic in the film. Unfortunately, the rest of the film is dismal and extremely slow-moving. Bouncing around the three main storylines, it's obvious from the start what will bring the three characters together. But the journey is painfully slow. To make matters worse, over a third of the film is in French (with English subtitles).

While the acting was spot on, it wasn't enough to make the film worthwhile. The three storylines obviously connect, but without much resolution at the end. It was a long build-up to a fizzled, lackluster ending. Clint Eastwood directs this strange, monotonous film with seemingly little direction.  Fans of drama, with a paranormal twist, who don't mind reading their movies and watching stagnant scenes (like Matt Damon eating meals by himself) may be interested in this one.

Along with ""Inception"", this is one of the most original films from a well respected director--and it accomplishes what it set out to do--and this is to make us think!!

4389296,4,B004IWR06S,"I've been going through the reviews and it captured my attention on how people were rating this film based on the accuracy or credibility of a ""Hereafter"". Well, for starters I really can't blame them. People have their own opinions, their own believes. ""What will Happen to Us after we die?"" is a Question that crossed many people's minds at least once in their lives. Of course, when we are younger we are told that Good people go to Heaven and bad people go to hell and we accept that fact as it is, plain and simple but as we grow older we always Question our believes our minds are always rebelling against the illogical and the idea of Heaven and Hell seems too paranormal for some that it simply can't be true.

I think when you view this film, try to view it based on your believes and on your point of view. Do you believe in a ""Hereafter"" do you believe that there is something after death ? or is death merely the end ? If you believe that there is something for us after we die, then this movie isn't trying to establish itself as a fact. It's just a possibility of what might happen when we die.

I personally am a superstitious person, I like to believe that people will eventually get what they deserve. The idea of a bad person who kills people and do so many crimes and not getting punished for it is disturbing and depressing, It almost make me feel that there is no meaning in life, so the idea of Heaven and Hell gives me a comfortability. You can never be too sure right ? So, when I watched this film I liked the idea behind it and I also liked the story. True, this may not be Eastwood's best work but it's unique and different.

I would recommend this movie to people who have an Open mind, or are willing to see something new. If however, your into fast paced, action movies than you'll probably get bored considering there is little to no action in this film at all. I know the trailer has that tsunami and the people running away from it that gives us the impression it's full of action scenes under water almost like 2012 but after watching the actual movie I was amazed at how fooled I was by the trailer.

I wouldn't recommend this movie to people who like to watch ""realistic"" movies. The film is obviously a work of fiction and it's not related to any world problem issues at all.

I would recommend this film to anyone who likes to watch spiritual based movies that deal with the issue of life, death and after death.

I think this movie had a problem with inaccurate marketing. Yeah the tsunami scene was pretty amazing (unfortunate timing in relation to the Japan quake and tsunami) but this wasn't a CGI effects driven flick, as the previews would have had you believe.

It is, however, a very thoughtful and peaceful story.  I suspect you have to be over the mental age of 13 or 14 to actually understand this kind of movie.

And while at times, it did seem to be a little difficult to follow... it was worth the effort.

Damon did a masterful job developing his character's struggle with this strange talant.

Ms. France's scene, in the restaurant, when her cad of a lover admits his feckless betrayal, was so real I was both moved and shamed at the same time. Moved in sympathy for her character... shamed because I recognized my own human weaknesses from experience.

4389310,4,B004IWR06S,"This is a very well-acted movie by mostly unknown actors except for Matt Damon.  However, for over an hour I wondered what the French news woman had to do with this entire plot.  Her role and that of Matt Damon (as George L) weren't coming together, and indeed they don't come together for the first 90 minutes.

There are three protagonists here.  First there is Marie Lelay, the French journalist vacationing with her news editor on a tropical island when a serious tsunami hits and wipes out the coastal village.  Both survive, but she has a concussion that forever changes her; she experiences the pathway to death before she is revived by two men who find her swept onto the beach.  She writes a book about her experiences that gets published in the US for American audiences.  I believe if this entire storyline were taken out of the movie (except for her book and her tour in the US) the movie will be faster-paced and shorter by a good 20-30 minutes.

The second protagonist is Marcus, twin brother to Jason who gets killed by a truck as he is running away by a group street gangs.  Marcus tries the rest of the movie to get back to his brother, and starts finding psychics on the internet to meet in real life, all who turn out to be quacks...except for George whose craft is phenomenal.

But George, the third protagonist, doesn't want to do readings anymore, yet he is coerced by his brother to get back into it because that his how his brother can make money off of him.  His brother wants nothing more than for George to get back into conducting readings again because George has a natural gift with that.  George sees it more as a curse, though, and only does readings after the people  persuade him to do one, which always turns out making the subjects admit to deep secrets of their past.

These three story lines develop slowly.  For someone expecting a fast-action thriller or suspense will be deeply disappointed in this movie.  This is more of a drama whose theme is connecting with the afterlife, and Clint Eastwood does an excellent job refraining from making this either a religious movie or a SciFi/horror/thriller movie. He gives a sensitive slant to this topic which gives all the characters a human touch.

It's a shame this movie is not well-received by the general public.  When seen as a drama this works well, and anyone who believes in the afterlife would enjoy this.  Damon plays a convincing psychic.",1300752000,3,2434,4.618604651162791

I must confess that this is the most boring film I have ever seen..I suffered through the dialog waiting some special effects or great revelation ..it didn't happen.

4389312,5,B004IWR06S,"Clint Eastwood is always throwing his films in the crowd of onlookers as if it were a bomb or a good uppercut or some kind of blackmailing session of arm twisting. And this Hereafter trip into dead territory and death's kingdom is one more provocation right in our faces.

What is there beyond death? A beyond or hereafter that no one knows except a few who have been able to come back but who are regarded by people as some kind of zombies or crazy ranting and raving extra-terrestrials. He takes a little of Dead Zone by Stephen King and he turns his film into a journey across the world from San Francisco to London and Paris where we meet three exceptional beings. A twin brother who has lost his twin in some ugly road accident. A TV anchorwoman who has died in a tsunami and managed to come back. And a medium who suffered some health problem in his youth and died a couple of times or more on the operating table.

The whole film will aim at bringing the three together one way or another and make them discover there is something, even some life beyond those deadly and fatal events. At the same time he settles some long deserved accounts with a few people, among others French publishers who are as frigid as for publishing kinky things as old spinsters who have dedicated their whole lives to looking at the tip of their shoes. Jean Yves Berteloot in that role is cruel and so realistic that he is truer than truth itself. And we can think of absolutely all French publishers as being some rancid loveless and heartless old crumbs lost under a pile of rotting wood.

But the film is also a good fist blow right into the noses of the audience. Terrifying pictures of a tsunami, we used to say tidal wave in the old days, all the more frightening because of the recent Japanese tsunami. Horrifying pictures of death: death in the hands of that natural cataclysm; death in the hands of an underground catastrophe in London; death in the hands of some bullies against a younger child causing his deadly fate in the middle of the street; death in the hands of heroin, the famous horse that stampedes and gallops more often and longer than we can imagine.

And yet Clint Eastwood wants us to believe there is some bright side in that story. The medium who cannot have a normal life since he can't touch anyone without being transported into their hereafter and there-before, will be saved by love. The forlorn twin will find solace in his own dead brother who will know more about life than the living now he is dead. The TV anchorwoman who will find love and hope in someone who can see beyond the surface. Even the horrid horse will find its master in the hands of some good doctors.

Clint Eastwood's realism is the main power and force in this film. He whips you around with pictures so true that they become divine with truth and life together. And you better say thank you to the old man who is there to show the future in the past and the present in the visionary ranting and raving of the insane, and we are all insane somewhere, so we are all aware of the present, the past and the future, but 99.99% of these people are 200% sure death is the final end of life. Well, I am ready to bet it is not, though when I know I won't be able to cash my bet.

4389313,4,B004IWR06S,"I really liked this movie and it killed me to see these unjustified 1 star reviews. I won't give it 5 for a good reason but it is definately worth the watch.
We have 3 stories that give the impression they are not tied together. At the beggining, they aren't. Later in the movie they are and some people simply wanted it to happen faster than Mr. Eastwood wanted. Have a little patience and you will like this movie.
This is why I gave it 4 vs 5 stars. Although slow paced, it just seemed like the ending wasn't the ending. You will have to watch to understand. It takes so long to finally ""close things out"" that you are like, ""That's the end?"". Maybe a part 2 later?
But, the 3 stories, if you take the time to enjoy them and pay attention to the situations, the foreshadowing of what is to come pays off.
Damon (George): Is a psychic that can commune with the dead. He is very good at it but he is drained. Think of it from his perspective. If you had to give news to people that made them cry for so long, after a while, you won't want to do it anymore. They did NOT sensationalize this. He doesn't see evil or bad people. He is giving that news ""move on with your life"" or ""I'm sorry I made your life so hard"". Although they can be happy tears, they are heart breaking just as much.
Marie: French woman on vacation has a near death experience being drawn under water in the tsunami back in 2004. She wakes to want to write a book about it but meets resistance from people around her. These special effects were excellent!
Marcus: Man who, as a boy, his twin brother died and wants to connect with him but has encountered fakes in the past.
All will somehow come together and hopefully get the answers they seek.",1300665600,4,1716,4.218844984802431
4389314,3,B004IWR06S,"""Hereafter"" was directed by Clint Eastwood and stars Matt Damon, Ccile De France, and Frankie and George McLaren. George Lonegan (Damon) is a psychic who views himself cursed with this ""gift"" of visions and the ability to talk to those in the afterlife. Marie LeLay was a respected television journalist until a brush with death in the form of a giant tidal wave inspires her to write a novel called ""Hereafter"". Frankie and George McLaren play the twins Marcus and Jason. Marcus is on a search for answers after his brother dies suddenly and he didn't get to say goodbye. Eventually all three cross paths in the most random of ways that will make you raise an eyebrow.

This film tried to bill itself several different ways as if it was similar to ""The Sixth Sense"" (it isn't) or perhaps is a big budget thriller since it has that giant wave and another accident scene later (two scenes does not an action movie make). This is a quiet, slow-paced drama watching these people attempt to continue their lives though one feels cursed and his relationships always fall apart, one is being abandoned by those close to her that feel she is losing it, and the brother that feels like half of a whole. The whole film is just ok for me. I felt it easier to relate to the woman and the twin than the psychic's dilemma. Jay Mohr is a great casting choice for George Lonegan's brother who wants him to start making money off his talent again (with the brother as manager, of course). While Cecile and Marcus are both on a determined path looking for answers, I felt like George was wandering aimlessly just hoping to dissolve into the background, giving up on happiness all because as soon as someone finds out he is psychic, they demand a reading and don't like what they hear. The tidal wave was VERY impressive shaking my entire living room with the sound, but seeing it this week for the first time seemed far too much like the current events in Japan (which I hear this film title was pulled from the Japan market by request).

Even if the afterlife, heaven/hell/whatever is a fascinating subject for you, the film really doesn't go very deeply into it. All the characters have very mild experiences and most of their journey takes place trying to get others in the tangible world to understand them. *Shrug* Oh and the ending made me roll my eyes so that didn't help either.

Bonus Features:

The movie can be played with focus points or you can watch them separately. You can learn all the different aspects that went into filming the tsunami tidal wave. Exploring the possibility of life after death just asks actors, filmmakers, and producers what their opinions are on the subject. Clint Eastwood talks about the casting of the film, who auditioned and who was given their roles on the spot, and the casting of locations, and as always the actors talk about Eastwood as a director. They interview some mediums who talk about ""head-tapping"" to profile violent criminals and make predictions. They also explore the bonds between twins from experience and also the filmmaker's knowledge of the ""white light"" experience many have when near death.

""The Eastwood Factor"" is a feature-length profile of the Actor/Director's career, in his own words, covering his over 35 years with Warner Bros. Obviously this documentary was originally made for ""Invictus"" because of the introduction and Morgan Freeman narrating. There are clips from tons of his movies exploring his favorite characters and aspects of his career. It's a great introduction to Eastwood for newcomers and a good refresher course for avid fans complete with a tour of his own costume library.",1300665600,,3651,4.7705696202531644
4389315,1,B004IWR06S,"As a psychic/medium (voted the Number 1 Psychic for 2011 by ""The Long Island Press""), I think Hollywood is ten years behind the times with this movie.  Near death/going to the light experiences are not new news.  There have been countless books over the last few decades dealing with this topic.  As for psychics and mediums, even we are becoming mainstream, as more and more people are on a spiritual quest and seeking our services. ""The New York Times"" bestseller list has had many ""hereafter-type books"" represented there, and so, I felt that this movie seemed already dated before it even hit the theaters.

4389316,4,B004IWR06S,"This is a well acted drama that by it's nature deals with tragidy. I think folks missunderstand the message: It's not about 'the afterlife', it's about what you do while your still alive!",1300579200,2,187,4.696969696969697
4389317,1,B004IWR06S,"I am a big fan of Clint Eastwood.  I had high hopes from this movie,
but it was a miss-fire.

There are three separate plot lines that eventually merge together.

The best part of the movie is in the beginning when a tsunami hits,
but it lasts no more then a few minutes. French journalist Marie
has a near death experience which makes her curious with the afterlife.

When she comes back to France, she changes her mind about writing a
political book, and instead wants to write about afterlife.  Her
manager thinks that a book on that topic would not sell in France
and gives her a list of publishers in the USA.  This makes me think that
people in the USA are either a) more open-minded, or b) easily duped.
Your pick.

The second plot line is that Matt Damon had an operation in the past
that made him connect with the other side.  If this were a super-hero
movie, I would buy that idea no questions asked.  However, if this is
a realistic movie, then you have to ask the question why nobody else
who had a similar operation did not become gifted as he was.  Of course,
it is easy to create a 'WHOOSH' sound in the movie to force us think
that things like this can happen.

The third story line is about a shoolboy Marcus who has a twin brother.
After his twin brother dies in an accident, he tries to find a way to
communicate with him through psychics, but they are all fakes.  But
then he meets Matt Damon and things change.  Somehow, just because
Matt Damon is the star of this movie, he can communicate with his
brother.  I just did not buy it.  I would put Matt Damon in the category of
fakes as well.  Because there is not a single thing that separates
him from the rest of the psychics, other than the fact that he is
the star of the movie.  Assuming of course that this is not a super-hero movie.

I am rating this movie 1 star based only on its subject matter.  Acting,
directing etc may be good but it was very slow going for me.",1300579200,,1944,4.205405405405405
4389318,1,B004IWR06S,"Seriously?  I kept on waiting for this movie to pick up.  But it never did.  Poor Matt Damon.  He did some great acting.  Whenever the long, drawn out pans stopped. Was this an art film or something?  It was sooooooo bad.  I always thought Clint could do no wrong.

What happened with the cute redhead?  Yeah, I get it.  But seriously?

""I'm not looking out for you anymore, marcus"" Really?!?!  So - a dead 10 year old is a kermudgeony old man?

I was not disappointed.  This is a very interesting story of three lives and how they come together.  Two by tragedy (Marie Lelay, the twins-Marcus/Jason, and one by a gift-George Lonegan.  This movie takes twists and turns but Eastwood never loses the viewer.  My only distant complain is that as good as Matt Damon is as an actor, I feel this story deserved a different kind of actor to totally fulfill it.  If the right lead actor was picked for this movie I would have given it a solid five stars.
This is a totally enjoyable and entertaining movie.",1300579200,2,730,4.6484375

4389321,1,B004IWR06S,"Credibility:
The movie was in immediate ""credibility"" trouble when one of our stars is hanging onto a tree in the midst of a raging mountainous raging river of a tsunami and
(a.) as someone who has rafted the Snake River in Hell's Canyon I'll tell you right now that was not possible; she would have sucked in water and been dragged under.
(b.) while clinging to the tree she is hit by a car floating at a high rate down stream and ends up with a bruise -  should have been crushed.
(c.) the amount of time she's under with no control - she should have drowned.
(d.) but, somehow she's suddenly appears on a roof top being resuscitated.
I know, picky but that sets the tone for how the movie is being produced. One hour and fifteen minutes of  tedium as to knowing obviously where the movie is heading, i.e. that the three character subplots who are in three different countries will magically come together at the end and live happily ever after. End of story - except, of course, the hereafter.

Incorrect portrayals:
(a.) Portraying science quotes:  ""scientists minds are closed to such things as hereafter myths""; ""evidence is irrefutable""; ""others that disagree are enemies"". First, scientists welcome all possibilities -  witness quantum, chaos, singularities and GUTs. Second, nothing is irrefutable in scientific process - everything is refutable. Third, disagreement is welcome. That is part of the process of how science advances. No one has an investment in being right, just in advancing the discussion.
(b.) The hereafter is shown as little statue people surrounded by a light is portrayed as real because ""when unconscious no fresh images can be produced""; ""there is no sense of time/space and you feel weightless"". All are offered as proof of a hereafter. WRONG! Whether dead or unconscious the brain continues to function with cellular stores of oxygen and glucose for minute(s) and as they are depleted the normal white light effect becomes tunneled. Not surprisingly the one image you want to create when dying is someone important to you. The other evidences are normal for anyone who has ever had night time dreams.

Producer bias:
It is not coincidental that Eastwood would make such a movie because there is nothing more desirable for a person approaching the end to not want it to end. Even more so if your life has been an accumulation of idolatry and materialism. The more you have the harder it is to lose it.  Preserving and passing on wealth to your descendants has been common fare for thousands of years - Egyptians!. It's just an additional pathway to immortality.

4389322,3,B004IWR06S,"Not that there has to be a clear-cut resolution for everything, but I would have liked a bit more of the story told explicitly, especially since there are high emotional stakes for the three main characters:  Matt Damon, the reluctant psychic who can communicate with the dead; a young English boy who wants to talk to his dead twin brother; and a French woman who survives a tsunami while on vacation.

All three come together towards the end in England, yet there does not seem to be any kind of payoff overall.

Yes, he did a professional job with fine actors but they were in the service of a boring, slow drunk hippo of a movie. It starts out well enough with a good SFX sections and then gets slower and slower and slower. There are 3 stories (at least) going on here. One of the stories could easily have been left out to shorten this film so we could get to the sappy ending. I wonder if Clint made this film so he could get a studio-paid trip to Europe?",1300579200,2,576,4.245454545454545
4389324,4,B004IWR06S,"The movie is not so much about death or dying. It is more about how the mind and body are connected in efforts to survive, and how we connect with other people in those efforts as well. It illustrates that the brain releases the functioning of the senses so that the body can do what it does to survive, while the mind takes us on a trip to never never land.

The movie talks about social groups and individuals who gravitate about the subject. It talks about people who deeply miss loved ones, or are trying to understand their own experiences. It talks about pubic conversations on the subject.

The results of the struggle for the characters are that the boy becomes calmer about his brother, and the man and woman find a transition to a new beginning once they have the information they need to go forward with their lives. Truth be told, we go forward even without the information, but having it loosens the grip of the trauma.

It is a good thing that the artists did for us. They did it well enough. It is for us to study the movie if need be, and learn the lessons it teaches. Thankfully, it can be watched by most people. I'm certain the movie will help novices approach the subject from a healthy perspective, and because of that the movie will have longevity in the public eye.",1300579200,,1288,4.4033613445378155

There's really no weak link here among the main players.

It's no surprise audiences are mixed on the film. I have a feeling most are expecting a more eerie, supernatural thriller type of movie, ala The Sixth Sense.

The separate story lines, one in the UK, in France, and, of course, in the US are just too messy.  By that I mean that it's too hard to follow each, when they're not carefully integrated into the whole.  For example, do you enjoy endless dialog in French with subtitles?  I do not. Or Brits with mumbled and often too heavily accented lines? Nope.
And all of that is before the downright silly, but primary relationship, if you can call it that, between the hero and his dopey brother.

4389333,4,B004IWR06S,"This movie did not turn out to be what I was expecting. Movie trailers quite often paint a different picture of a movie than what it actually is, and that is the case here.  This being said, I still enjoyed this film.

It is not a grand masterpiece by any stretch of the imagination, but that's fine.  Not every film I see has to be.  This story revolves around three individuals, and their experience with death.  One listens to the dead, one has a near-death experience, and one loses his twin brother.  The common thread in the film is that all three struggle to cope with their experience with death.  They each try to run away from it, try to understand it better, or try to bring closure to it.  The story finally brings the three characters together, and we see that they are united by the one thing that eludes them...death.

I thought the movie was well made, except perhaps for the beginning few things and the ghastly special effects during the tsunami. I think they could have simply done without that, and shown the French woman sinking in the water having her visions, which in the end is what we were to take away from her experience during the tragic circumstances she endured.

In good Clint Eastwood fashion, the film advances at a pace that allows the viewer to see the characters for what they are intended to be.  The movie is slow at times, but not disturbingly so.  It is meant to be.  I think there is meaning in each scene, and that is what I enjoyed.  In the end, we see that no matter what we do, death is always present, and is part of the cycle of life.

I gave this film a 4-star rating, mainly to offset the 1 or 2-star ratings it received, which I believe are not merited here.  I think a true rating would be a 3 1/2 star, which I believe this movie is currently receiving.  It is definitely worth seeing.",1300320000,,1838,4.343108504398827
4389334,4,B004IWR06S,"This film could not arrive on the shelves at a more appropriate time: natural disasters such as hurricanes/tornadoes/earthquakes/tsunamis/winter blizzards cover that part of the news that is not flooded with stories of man's inhumanity to man, lending a yearning for discovering some meaning to all of this.  If that meaning comes at the point of death then that is at least something to comfort us.  HEREAFTER is a thinking man's film from Clint Eastwood, a film that carries his trademark concern for human communication to a new level,  And it works.

George Lonegan (Matt Damon) had an experience as a child with encephalomyelitis that left him with the ability to communicate with the dead -a psychic.  After some years of using this as a profession (with the aid of his brother Billy - Jay Mohr) he has given up this disturbing 'curse' and become a construction worker. Billy pleads with him to continue as a psychic but George is too disturbed by his talent and seeks peace.  Simultaneously we are introduced to a French TV journalist Marie Lelay (C&eacute;cile De France) and her boyfriend Didier (Thierry Neuvic) as the 2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami destroys their vacation and Marie is drowned for a while - but revives: the experience  changes her outlook and she takes a break form her Parisian YTV job to write  a book about her hereafter experience. And simultaneously the brothers Marcus and Jason (Frankie and George McLaren) try to keep their drug addicted mother whole and Jason is accidentally killed: Marcus is devastated by the loss of his brother and by the fact that he is to be placed in a foster home. These three people's lives intersect in a course of events that lands them each in London and their shared belief in the hereafter is what manages to bring them a semblance of sanity, despite the world's negative opinion of their beliefs.

Peter Morgan  ('The Queen', 'Longford', 'Frost/Nixon', 'The Other Boleyn Girl', etc) wrote this absorbing tale and Clint Eastwood directs with a true flair for the subject matter.  The special effects are extraordinarily well done, especially the underwater sequences.  Damon and the beautiful and talented C&eacute;cile De France are excellent in their roles as are the boys who play the brothers  and the cameos by such luminaries as Derek Jacoby, Marthe Keller, Steve Schirripa, and Bryce Dallas Howard.  Though the music score is attributed to Clint Eastwood, for the most part the music is provided by excerpts form Rachmaninov's 2nd Piano Concerto!  The film goes on a bit long (over 2 hours) but the twists and turns of the action keep it well worth watching.  Grady Harp, March 11",1300233600,2,2651,4.923595505617977

4389336,5,B004IWR06S,"Bravo, Clint Eastwood, you really outdid yourself on making this movie.  Also, bravo to Matt Damon for not pigeonholing himself into roles but instead flexing his acting versatility every chance he gets.  I just got done watching him as Tina Fey's pilot boyfriend on 30 ROCK and the Texas Ranger in TRUE GRIT.  You would be hard pressed to tell any of these roles were the same actor!

This film has an incredible opening, one I can see again and again.  A French female tv broadcaster is on vacation at a beach paradise on the Indian Ocean.  While she is shopping at the stalls, the tsunami which erupted from that ocean in 2004 crashes towards her.  She struggles for her life in the water but a car hits in the water and she dies and starts to cross over.  This, however, is one of those deaths where she is subsequently brought back with life guard techniques.  Yet she now is forever drawn back to that transition point.  Hers is just one of three stories but what a bang up opening to this film.

There are two other stories.  Matt Damon is a reluctant psychic located in San Francisco.  He is the real deal unlike just about everyone else in the field.  The reason he doesn't want to do it is that it is absolutely ruinous to one's personal life as it obliterates the distance needed to carry on personal relationships.  It is hard to romance someone when you can see her entire life with just one touch. He has such an encounter with a would-be girlfriend played by Bryce Dallas Howard.

Finally, there is a boy who loses his twin brother in a fatal collision.  He desperately wants to get in touch with his brother.  His life is a mess because after his brother's death he is removed from his mother and put into foster care. (Although, one evidently can get far better foster care families in the UK than here in the US.) It was interesting for me to see that the boy uses a computer with internet connection as his lifeline in almost every situation.  The other characters are too old for them to have been raised with a connected computer since earliest childhood.  However, with the newest generation coming up, it as natural as breathing to use it everyday for everything.

All three of these people will ultimately come together in London.  This too works very well.  It is just an astonishing piece of filmmaking and I consider it at the very top of Eastwood's directing efforts.

4389337,5,B004IWR06S,"It's almost shocking that Clint Eastwood, at his age, is still crafting such risky, memorable and important films like ""Hereafter.""

Clint Eastwood's ""Hereafter"" is great in every way a movie should be great. The characters are layered, psychologically complex and always interesting. The performances are natural, restrained and effective. The writing it timely, thoughtful and intricate. The story is deep and probing without being melodramatic or overly sentimental. The directing is stylish, calculated and visually arresting. ""Hereafter"" is a fantastic film, and I'm not entirely sure why it's being met with such hatred. Sure, the film has a slow pace but that shouldn't deter it's effect, for me, it enhances it. ""Hereafter"" may be a somber experience but it's Eastwood at his most thought provoking, emotional, and daring. Certainly one of my favorite films from 2010.

It's also quite refreshing to see Matt Damon in such a restrained performance, he too, like Eastwood, keeps turning out surprising work. If you are a fan of serious minded, thought provoking and emotionally relevant filmmaking, please support ""Hereafter.""",1300147200,8,1133,5.468571428571429

I love this film. I am very interested in ""life after death"" as well as a life lived fully ""aware and awake"".  The film beautifully and abstractly shines light on many subjects including people's experiences/stories and finding their way.  Magnificently done.

4389339,3,B004IWR06S,"First of all, I went to my local video store, and got one of those 'rental exclusives' copy of HEREAFTER. The first thing I noticed, was how out of focus most of the scenes were. More like 'soft focus' out of control. At first, I thought there was something wrong with the production of this DVD. Many straight vertical lines and objects appear curved, like they were shot with a wide angle lens. But, thats supposed to give you more depth of focus, not blurriness. This hampered my enjoyment of the film very much.
The story line hardly grabbed me at all. Its like Eastwood wanted to make a European film. Vague, understated, and bleak. Matt Damon gives his best performance. Because, Eastwood made him drop all of his routine expressions. You know, that half smile-half smirk look. He completely transformed Damon's performance, into quite a magnificent understatement.
But, the story just never really grabbed me enough to hold my interest. I nodded off to sleep on more than one occasion.
So, this film is still a mystery to me. I hated the way it was filmed, unless those rental exclusive copies were defective. The story didn't interest me, but Damon's performance is so outstanding, because it is so...un-Damon like. I dunno Clint...I just don't know.",1300147200,,1258,4.828703703703703

I think people who like movies about death and dying are looking for one of two things - either an inspired answer to their questions, or a thrill.  This gave neither.

I watched this just a couple of days after the Japan earthquake, so perhaps I was looking for something to answer that kind of devastation.  The special effects of the filming of this tsunami was good...perhaps the best part of the film.  But having subtitles while they spoke French was distracting and unnecessary since she spoke English during the rest of the movie. Between her, the child who loses his twin, and the psychic, there were three very interesting characters, but the storyline between the three just didn't make much sense.  Compared to Travolta's ""City of Angels"" or even ""Michael"", it didn't hold a candle. I'm not religious, so wasn't looking for that angle...I just wanted some new idea, new revelation about the afterlife, or at least a riveting story, and I'm afraid it didn't deliver any of them.

I know it's politically incorrect to say so, but I think Clint Eastwood was a better actor than he is a filmmaker.  I don't recommend it unless you just want to watch a movie to pass the time. I'm glad I didn't pay $8 at the theatre to see it.",1300147200,,1404,4.5436507936507935

4389343,3,B004IWR06S,"On a scale of 1 to 10, I give it a 6.9. Here's the breakdown:
(All of my reviews are also on [...] if you want to see it with pictures.)

Screenplay
9.0

The screenplay for this movie is excellent. I think Clint Eastwood's greatest strength as a director is his ability to create lifelike characters, and this movie is no exception. I love the way that he makes the viewer feel distant from Marcus' foster family and pretty much everyone in Marie and George's lives. Eastwood makes the viewer care about the characters and feel their loneliness and isolation. The characters feel so rich and human; they are anything but shallow or one-dimensional.

The first half of this movie focuses mostly on character development. It felt rather slow and tedious when I first watched it, however it ultimately pays off. Each of the story lines is independent until the end of the movie, and the way the filmmakers bring together three compelling story lines is really elegant.

Hereafter is a very well written movie. The dialogue feels natural; it never feels forced.  There are tons of one-liners that are poetic and wise.

Acting
9.0

I was worried about the acting quality of this movie at one point. One of the twins (Jason) definitely showed some weak acting at a few times. Luckily, they kill him off pretty early on on the movie, and his twin brother was a superb actor. I swear, the quality of child actors seems to be getting better and better lately.

Matt Damon delivers a stellar performance. He is great at playing people with unique abilities and head injuries. (Borne series) Damon brings those same skills to the table here. The actress who plays Marie does a very good job of delivering both her English lines and her French lines. (about a quarter of her lines are in English and the rest are in French) Marcus' mom plays the part of a heroin addict perfectly.

Despite my initial concerns, the acting quality in Hereafter ended up being one of the movie's greatest strengths.

Style
8.5

I liked the style of this movie a lot. The three story lines take place in England, France, and San Fransisco. Eastwood gave the scenes a strong local vibe and the result is a movie with a very international ambiance.

The special effect that is used during the near death scenes and psychic connection scenes is beautiful. When George goes into a psychic state, there are many figures in an open area. The colors seem almost inverted and ethereal.  When he is focused on one person, they appear detailed and vibrant; the other spirits are shadowy and vague.

The computer generated tsunami looked fantastic. Few movies can match the realistic appearance and motion of the water in this scene. The destruction of the tsunami is very intense. You see bodies, cars, boats, and even buildings being swept up by the water and carried inland. People are caught in downed power lines and electrocuted. The whole tsunami scene is very intense and jarring.

Genre Comparison
5.5

I don't know whether I would consider the genre of this movie to be a Clint Eastwood movie or, to be a drama about the afterlife. Either way, this movie shines. Clint Eastwood makes fantastic dramas dealing with the subject of death. The bar has already been set high, and this movie doesn't make the cut. This is mainly because it doesn't leave you with a clear message; just with some things to think about.

Originality
6.5

Hereafter is mostly original. I haven't seen many other movies that looked at near death experiences from the same angle as this movie. The view of death portrayed in this movie is pretty standard. I'm mean, its not a Judeo-Christian perspective, but its fairly mainstream in the way it shows psychics and death. For example, for the near death experience, they showed bright lights and dead relatives. The psychic reading scenes had the typical ""I'm getting a strong signal related to the month June. Does June mean anything to you?."" Very John Edwards-esque.

I thought the structure of the plot was pretty original though.

Message
1.0

This is where Hereafter fell flat. The message of this movie was very vague. The resolution to the conflict basically did nothing to portray a meaningful message, unless of course you are a psychic. It mostly just left you with a few things to think about and, as I mentioned before, those few things are basically mainstream metaphysical ideas. Maybe I was a little harsh in scoring this section, but it really is a glaring omission.

Huevos Factor
5.0

This was a tough one to grade. It was well written and the acting was good. I want to love it, but it never really drew me in. In many ways its a quality movie, but it's missing some things. Overall, its not bad, but it's not a movie I'd watch again and again.

Hereafter comes out on DVD and Blu-ray on March 15.

4389344,3,B004IWR06S,"In ""Hereafter"" are told three seemingly unrelated stories, about French news reporter Marie Lelay (Ccile De France), who survives the horrifying tsunami while on vacation; a San Francisco factory worker and retired psychic George Lonegan (Matt Damon), who considers his unusual abilities as a curse; and London twins Marcus and Jason (Frankie and George McLaren) living with their substance-addicted mother.

I am not going to repeat what other reviewers have rightly said about Clint Eastwood's latest film. It is quiet and thoughtful (with the effectively moody cinematography from Tom Stern). This is not a supernatural thriller, but a drama about those who are trying to cope with the inevitable or, perhaps more precisely, its consequence. The theme is immediate and the film is well-intentioned, I know that for sure.

With all respect to veteran director Clint Eastwood and the serious subject matter that is dealt here, however, narrative of ""Hereafter"" is disappointingly flat. It is not boring. It is, for lack of better word, predictable. About one hour in, you get where three stores are leading us, and the way the film is trying to reach there is not very compelling, but just contrived.

Peter Morgan, screenwriter of ""Frost/Nixon"" fame, fails to invest his characters with enough personality to further each story. Many say the opening tsunami sequence looks hauntingly real. I agree. But I just don't see how Marie's near-death experience influenced her life after the shocking event. What these characters experience has profound dimensions, loss and sadness resonant to us all. Sadly, what they are (and do after their life-changing experiences) does not generate emotional resonance.",1299974400,,1703,5.347014925373134
4389345,3,B004IWR06S,"I viewed this movie on Thursday, normally right after watching a movie I would rush to write a review while everything is still fresh in my mind. However, this was not to be the case. But yesterday, after seeing the vast and total devastation of the tsunami in Japan, I decided to now write it, in memory of all those who perished in this disaster.

A very realistic Tsunami

This movie opens in India 2004, with a very realistic tsunami sequence. This is a very frightful situation to be caught up in. Those living in low lying coastal earthquake prone areas must now consider the very real possibility of a tsunami coming to shore and changing their lives forever.

A Necromancer

In this film, Matt Damon takes on the role of George Lonegan. It is explained that because of a near death operation that he now has the ability to communicate with the dead. While this appears to be a plausible explanation, it should be noted that this is only fiction. According to Christian beliefs, the souls of the dead do not just drift about waiting to talk to their relatives through `mediums'.

The Plot

The plot starts out on three fronts:

[1] - a French reporter who turns writer, her life is changed by a tsunami;
[2] - 2 brothers (twins) one is killed and the other desperately misses him; and
[3] - a necromancer who is trying desperately to live a normal life.

In the end, the lines are all neatly tied up. Overall this is an interesting picture, but remember, it is only fiction, so don't go out there trying to hear from your deceased loved ones.",1299888000,2,1549,4.507142857142857
4389346,5,B004IWR06S,"Yet another great film by one of the very young-at-heart veteran filmmakers around.

Is Hereafter, really a film about a guy who communicates with the dead? The general consensus is that Lonegan (Damon) manages to connect with the dead relatives of his clients and acts as a medium. However, if we observe what he says to his ""clients"" it seems that the dead do not reveal anything that the living didn't know beforehand; there are no surprises at all. Perhaps the only surprise is that the dead seem to be up to date with events after their death. Either they can see what is happening ""here"" or simply it is not the dead speaking through Lonegan.

In fact, what Lonegan conveys, and what the ""clients"" learn, is that their dead forgive them or ask for their forgiveness so as traumas, guilt, unfulfilled desires should be dropped aside and they (the living) should get on with their lives. In such an interpretation, it is the living that speak through Lonegan to themselves. Lonegan reads their deep feelings and desires to be set free from whatever past load is weighing them down and tells them to do so. At the third ""reading"" in the film, that of the young boy, it seems that Lonegan is aware of this aspect of his work since he appears to insert some of his own advice in what the dead brother ""says"".

One point about all this is the view that we all know what we need to do with our lives but we require someone else to tell us to do it, in order to accomplish the big leap forward. In the film, to round up the situation, even Lonegan needs some of his own medicine in order to move on with his life and it is the boy who acts as the catalyst. He ""reads"" Lonegan's not so deep desires and sets him up with Marie Lelay (the French woman).

The film, as I see it, is not really about ""hope of what happens afterwards"", as a review suggests, but about life before death; the fact that usually it is so very obvious to everyone else what we want and need to make our lives work that it is a pity to have to reach the hereafter in order for each one of us to understand it.",1299628800,8,2079,4.282442748091603
4389347,5,B004IWR06S,"Here it is. Your classic Anti Hollywood/reality TV show picture crowned with only a few of Hollywood's most AA lister's, newcomers and foreign child actors. Director Clint Eastwood has set into motion a raving Pro Con discussion about the acclaimed ""success-failure"" of his new movie ""The Hereafter"". Moviegoers will be surprised to be sitting out the 2 h 9min movie with mostly waiting on some action after the Grand Opening of a natural disaster scene.
Forcing the viewer to be intuitive rather then judgmental is the fact that half of the movie is being subtitled in English, while a French couple tries to mend their relationship after it had been traumatically shaken up on their vacation in Asia.
The 3 storylines that are running beautifully parallel to each other, subtle suggest that they will find their path to each other. Paris, London, San Francisco.
Matt Damon's character beautifully portrays a medium that due to his ""curse"", being able to talk to the dead, is unable to lead a real life or have any romantic relationship unless leaving his gift untouched, while at the other end of the world a young English boy is mourning the sudden death of his little twin brother.
No Mercy for reality TV lovers: If you are looking out for flat foul action you guaranteed to miss the subtle signs pointing gently to a suggested Higher Power that maybe after all might lead us humans together and connect all spirit. Whether you like the movie or not--It cant be denied that certain Life scenario's have in some form or another been present in your Life leaving the question open: ""Can this after all be just coincidence?""
Eastwood and Damon's character won't give you the answer: You have to give it to yourself.
It's the beauty of this movie that it suggests a truth that might miraculously web through everyone's real life. If you only want to see what you want to see you will not even get a glimpse of the intention of this movie.

4389349,5,B004IWR06S,"Octogenarian Clint Eastwood's Hereafter is an understated but deeply moving meditation on death and how it affects those left behind. Congratulations must go to Eastwood for going above and beyond the conventional to provide a film that is empowering and unforgettable, one of the finest of his career and one of the best of 2010.

It is not a documentary, nor a European art film. It is a Hollywood product through and through but one with a difference. Refusing to cater to an audience that thrives on chaos and gore, Hereafter is a quiet and slow-paced film that treats every character, even the most flawed, with respect as a three-dimensional human being, not as an object used to bring in box office receipts.

Based on a screenplay by Peter Morgan (Frost/Nixon, The Queen), the subject matter deals with death but it is not maudlin in the slightest. Unlike films such as What Dreams May Come and The Lovely Bones, it is a reality-based film without colorful special effects mirroring popular conceptions of what heaven is all about. While some may not agree with its focus on spiritual mediums, Eastwood still allows us to share the pain of those who have lost a loved one and their experience that there is another dimension that transcends our five senses.

Hereafter tells three stories. In the opening sequence, French journalist and TV personality Marie Lelay played by the outstanding French actress Cecile de France, is vacationing in a beach resort in Indonesia with her producer and boyfriend Didier (Thierry Neuvic) when she is caught in a raging tsunami that uproots buildings and trees and sweeps hundreds to their death. She suffers a concussion and has a near-death experience that transports her to a world of light, one that exists outside of space and time where she feels weightless and has visions of others crossing over after the storm.

As a result of her experience, however, she is unable to focus when she returns to work and is compelled to take time off from broadcasting to write a biography of French politician Francois Mitterrand. What she really wants do, however, is to write a book about her near-death visions. She journeys to Europe to meet with the director of a hospice (Marthe Keller) who has documented many cases in which her patients have seen the other side. Her voyage is a lonely one, however, as her boyfriend rejects her experience as fantasy and publishers look askance at a draft of her book about life after death.

In the second story, George Lonegan, played by Matt Damon in one of his best performances, is a blue-collar worker living in San Francisco who has an unusual gift. Like spiritual mediums John Edward and James Van Praagh, he has the ability to make connections with and communicate messages from the dead. George has not done any readings for three years because he says that ""a life that's all about death is no life at all,"" and considers his talent to be a curse rather than a gift.

Though his brother Billy (Jay Mohr) keeps pressing him to return to doing readings, George refuses, but finally agrees to do one last reading for a client of his brother. When he is laid off from his job, however, he takes an Italian cooking class and meets Melanie (Bryce Dallas Howard), who hides her pain beneath a bubbly exterior. When she presses him to do a reading, he agrees but it brings back unpleasant memories for both participants and seems to validate all of his fears.

In the third sequence, in one of the most affecting child performances that I can remember, twin brothers Jason (George McLaren) and Marcus (Frankie McLaren) live with their mother, Jackie (Lyndsey Marshal) in a London apartment. Though she loves the boys, she is addicted to drugs and is being monitored by child welfare. Jason is older by twelve minutes and is the most talkative while Marcus is quiet and withdrawn.

When a sudden tragedy takes place, Marcus is sent to a foster home to try and provide a normal upbringing. The boy is obsessed with one thing, however, and that is making contact with the spirit world. In the film's only misstep, he goes to a variety of psychics who are shown as laughable charlatans instead of serious but perhaps flawed practitioners. Undaunted, he keeps up his quest, refusing to give up until he can achieve his goal of communicating with the hereafter.

While we sense that the threads will come together, to say as some critics have done that the stories are pulled together in ""a silly set of contrived coincidences"" overlooks one of the key messages of the film, that synchronicity does exist, that we are all connected, and that things happen for a reason. Backed by a serenely beautiful score composed by Eastwood, the film is emotional and had me in tears, yet it is honest emotion that carefully avoids melodrama and sentimentality.

Hereafter is not a perfect film and there are enough critics around to remind us of that. Yet the fact that this film was even made gives me hope that amidst the lunacy of today's world, the sense is growing slowly, in the song of Gordon Bok, that while ""it's so easy in the cold to feel the darkness of the year, the world indeed may be ""turning towards the morning"".",1297296000,7,5195,4.743078626799557

It is a long while since a film has done that. In this era when movies are mostly about action and blowing things up comes a movie that has action and does blow things up, but is in essence a peaceful , thoughtful, heartfelt treatise on life and death and dying. Eastwood is a better director now than he has ever been, he has grown up from his big kid western adventure days and his movies now address the most thoughtful and important issues known to man. The last six years he has given us ""Mystic River"", ""Gran Torino"" and this, along with many other films of strong if variable quality. He is now the master film maker. This film actually delivers up a Matt Damon who is sensitive and acts and his story is the centre piece of this master work. I believe this film will expose audiences, those who are cynical, ignorant and don't have a strong understanding of human connection (which is ultimately what the movie is about, the healing of troubled souls and the connections we make on this earth)will hate it. Those who embrace life and all it offers and find the question of the after life fascinating will love it, the cynics should go and watch an action flick. This is a master piece that has already been over looked in America. It will grow in stature and reputation over the years.",1296691200,13,1461,4.335766423357664
4389352,5,B004IWR06S,"Hereafter is a European art-house movie with Hollywood production values.
It's yet another Eastwood movie that ranks as the best American film of the
year because it engages both heart & mind with its tale of three individuals
in different parts of the world disconnected from life by a brush with death.

In Paris, famous TV reporter Marie (a luminous Cecile deFrance) briefly
dies during a horrific natural disaster & has a vision of what she
suspects may be the afterlife. Back home she can't get the experience
out of her mind & her obsession threatens her high-flying career &
friendships. In San Francisco, lonely, middle-aged factory worker
George (Matt Damon) can talk to the dead but his 'gift' makes it
impossible for him to form relationships with people. Finally, on a
grim housing estate in South London, young brothers Marcus & Jason
(George & Frankie McClaren) try to fend off social workers from taking
their druggie Mum (Lyndsey Marchal) away. But when tragedy strikes
Marcus finds himself all alone & desperate to speak to his beloved
brother one more time.

This is Eastwood's quietest film & one of his very best. The director
has always exhibited a fondness for emphasising character over plot but
here he goes further than ever before, luxuriating in the lives and
surroundings of these three very different people. Hereafter has almost
no plot, a third of it is subtitled, there's no villain, the film asks
questions without supplying answers, the actors don't 'act' in any
Hollywood sense of the term, the most spectacular scene comes right at the
start instead of at the end, & death is the starting point for both the
characters & the story rather than the climax.

All things that are clearly going to alienate a section of the movie-
going public simply because they're so unaccustomed to experiencing
that. And yet the same film features three ordinary people - not the
buffed up superheroes of so much contemporary American cinema - the
mood isn't one of overriding anger or self-pity (again, as so much
modern American cinema tends to be) but compassionate & thoughtful,
kind of contemplative, & in its quietness remarkably compelling. As the
critic Roger Ebert noted, it induces in the viewer something
akin to the feeling of a reverie.

The actors are extraordinary. Matt Damon gives the best performance
I've ever seen from him. His lonely psychic who aches for human contact
& goes to sleep listening to Dickens audio books is so heartfelt you
find yourself completely rooting for him but at the same time it's a
totally unshowy performance. That same low key quality applies in fact
to the whole cast. Cecile deFrance, looking a little like a young Julie
Christie, is simply terrific here, both intelligent & vulnerable, & the
McClaren twins have a rawness & authenticity that just works.

The craft side is equally impressive with the film moving smoothly
between the three story lines in 10 min chunks thanks to Eastwood's ace
editors Joel Cox & Gary Roach. Tom Stern's excellent photography gives
each setting - Paris, San Francisco & London - a distinct look & on the
musical side Eastwood himself contributes a lovely & sparingly used
piano piece.

Those fearing some sort of preachy Hollywood confection needn't worry.
Even Damon's psychic abilities are ambiguous. If you watch carefully
you'll note that he tells his subjects nothing they don't already know
or could have imagined themselves. Revealingly, what messages are
delivered all reinforce screenwriter Peter Morgan's key point; there's
no help to be had from the dead, you're on your own & what matters are
the connections you make in this life.

Morgan's script gives short-shrift to both organised religion & the
network of New Age frauds who profit from people's misery. One of the
more amusing sequences shows Marcus visiting a succession of con men
'psychics' each of whom offers increasingly ludicrous methods of
contact with the afterlife. Yet if all that sounds coldly atheist and secular,
Morgan's script is deeply sympathetic towards the need for those
who've lost loved ones, not just to grieve, but to talk publicly about death, &
skewers a materialistic western culture that fears & sidelines
anyone who does.

Hereafter doesn't say there is an afterlife. It doesn't pretend to have
any answers, it simply asks the question & it does so with intelligence
& compassion. It tells a story about people under the shadow of death
yet comes down on the side of life, love & simple human connection, not
with ghosts, but with each other. I loved it.",1296691200,4,4557,4.939947780678851
4389353,2,B004IWR06S,"Truly great cinema is a form of emotional conjuring trick: a way of presenting sounds and images - which, by their nature, we know have been contrived to induce a certain emotional and intellectual reaction - in a way which nonetheless genuinely induces that reaction.

It's a trick that Clint Eastwood, against the odds, has become rather good at. So much so that, by his reputation alone, part of his work is done before we even take our seats: we like Clint Eastwood: we like his films. We will him to present a film what will enthral us. Our suspension of disbelief is fully willing. We happily disregard occasional dissonances. Clint Eastwood has earned the benefit of our doubt.

And so, Hereafter opens promisingly: A black screen, backed by gentle augmented trills on a Spanish guitar, builds into a wide shot of a languid Pacific paradise. We know from its title this is a film about loss, so we look for a sign of lurking menace. And there it is: the gently breaking surf. Behind it, the sleeping heft of the azure ocean. We track a handsome French couple around their hotel room. There, reflected in every window, lying in wait behind every vista: that casual, loitering threat.

So far, so very, very good.

We are aided by the introduction of Ccile de France, a Class A smouldering French beauty. She magnetises our attention in a way that only Class A smouldering French beauties can. As the monstrous ocean broods, she flounces grumpily out of the love nest, leaving her layabout boyfriend to lie in while she arranges checkout, orders him breakfast, and goes out to buy gifts for his kids. His kids.

Our internal voice says, ""a lazy, married, bounder of a paramour? He'll be a villain then.""

But wait a minute: Isn't that a bit obvious? Did we just see a magician's wire?

We park the dissonance: Clint Eastwood has earned that. There follows shortly a set piece involving a natural catastrophe: I won't spoil what it is, but it drives much of the drama that subsequently unfolds. Now: if you were a director of this sort of film, how would you present such a plot driver: by subtle touch - implying the horror; leaving the carnage to the reader's imagination? Or would you cart in Industrial Light & Magic and give it the whole Bruckheimer treatment?

Another odd dissonance. Still, we park it. The scene isn't all ham-fisted, by any stretch: Along the way Eastwood throws in some thoughtful tableaux: It is a film about death, but who is dying? What is the afterlife we glimpse? Is it really anything of the sort? Carefully, Eastwood refrains from answering (though there will be those viewers who will miss the subtle equivocation and assume he does).

The narrative driver triggered, Hereafter settles down to exposition. We are introduced to three unrelated, geographically dislocated stories, so there is a lot of it. It's a magic trick, remember, so we know there will be some pay-off by which all this narrative will come together, but as the film progresses it is hard to imagine how this could possibly happen. We think: it will take a skilled conjurer indeed to pull this one off.

And, as these strands slowly unfurl themselves, the odd dissonances keep ringing.

We meet twin 12-year-old brothers, each astonishingly self-motivated, diligently doing their homework in their council estate flat and organising their own photographic portraits while their heroin addict mother (it is implied) turns tricks and comes home blitzed out of her brains. When Social Services come knocking, the boys resourcefully hold them off, covering for and reconditioning their mother. They singlehandedly hold together their household. Again, a dissonance: implausibility. We think: really?

As we alternate between the stories, we're given rather clanging signposts to show us which one we're in: A wide shot of the Eiffel Tower for France: Tower Bridge for London.

We meet Matt Damon - excellent, as ever, and unquestionably the beating heart of the film. He's in San Francisco, a retired psychic called George Lonegan. Eastwood equivocates ever-so subtly about Lonegan's ""gift"", and the extent of it (again, credulous viewers will miss this). But, Eastwood defuses this tension: However real Lonegan's powers may be, he is no charlatan. He's saddled, not blessed, with the gift. He refuses to profit from it, or even use it. When he is obliged into exercising it (rather easily, it must be said: the lady doth protest too much, methinks), he does it decently. He doesn't manipulate: he isn't cruel. Somewhat needlessly, we're invited to further admire Lonegan for his passion for Charles Dickens. (In a visit to Dickens' house, Lonegan thrills an entire tour party by correctly identifying a picture of the author asleep while all his characters float around him as ""Dickens' Dream"". I mean, the acumen!)

Still dissonances continue to ring. Eastwood's emotional manipulation begins to reveal itself. Particularly with the London Twins, who have been written so sympathetically that no acting or film-making talent is required to ensure we are emotionally invested in them: Who wouldn't be? But then it slowly occurs that very little film-making or acting talent is on display anyway. Again, we wonder, is that a magician's wire we can see?

Finally, the spell is broken: our French Bombshell, Marie Le Lay (a comedy name almost as good as the actress' real one) visits a Swiss mountain-top clinic specialising in knowledge about the afterlife (I couldn't tell whether it was a cancer hospice, a suicide clinic, or both) to be lectured on plot signposting so she could bring the picture home. It is a clumsy scene: clumsily conceived, clumsily scripted and clumsily acted.

It was then it hit me that Clint Eastwood had totally, completely, lost my complicity in his enterprise: his conjuring trick had failed. Hereafter was suddenly preposterous, manipulative and, frankly, daft.

I looked at my watch. We were a good hour and a half into the movie, and there was scant evidence of a means to drive the characters together.

And then suddenly, in a tsunami of implausibility, there they all were: a redundant factory worker from San Francisco, a ten year old boy from South London and a French television Journalist, all wandering around Alexandra Palace in North London. Again, you think: *really*?

As the credits rolled, I was left wondering what Eastwood had said, artistically, while presenting his illusion. I concluded: not really anything. The film is no more or less equivocal about the afterlife than it was at the beginning, and in any case has very little to say about it anyway. If it was a metaphor for something else, it was difficult to comprehend what.

We will see more of Ccile de France in the coming months and years, I dare say, but how well this film does in the hereafter is harder to predict.

4389357,5,B004IWR06S,"If you are interested in the subject matter, there is a definite tension that builds throughout this movie - a sort of rush - that will keep you riveted to the three unfolding dramas (and they are dramas, not thrillers or horror stories) despite the slow pace. And really, it is not so slow of a pace at all except that there are no lasers, robots, or dinosaurs in 3D.

A famous reporter's career and reputation are impacted when she attempts to share her near-death experience with others. Simultaneously and on another continent, a man with a heart of gold is shunned for a gift he cannot hide. And in yet another part of the world a young boy struggles to keep his hope alive as, in a lonely solitary search, he meets one charlatan after another who's claimed connections to the afterlife prove to be yet another farce. These three stories intertwine at the end of the movie, and payoff in a satisfying way. However, they don't payoff in a gratuitously ""spooky"" sort of way. The ending is certainly satisfying, it is uplifting and there is closure. But instead of gratuitous blowout interactions with the afterlife, the ending is a bit more understated albeit with a very moving conclusion. Personally, I appreciated that sort of restraint. Restraint, for me, was the powerhouse strength of this movie. Instead of jumping as quickly as possible into scenes of the afterlife and spooky interactions, the movie focuses the majority of its time on the hard yet realistic experiences of the characters who've been affected. Like a river that is serene on top but churning underneath, the stories are 95% completed with soft-spoken dialogue, in serene environments, and in safe settings; however, beneath every calmly conducted scene there is also conveyed sharp pain, rejection, and loneliness on the part of the individuals seeking, sharing, and questioning in a world that shuns and becomes annoyed by ""that sort of talk."" I'm not saying I'm a believer, but this film does make you wonder - Why aren't more of us wondering? What makes some of us afraid to question, or even pull away from those who do?

This movie has some scenes and portrayals of what the afterlife might be like, but by and large it focused more on the repercussions to the characters who shared about or questioned, or tried to hide, their experiences with the afterlife. For me, it's less a movie about the afterlife, and more a movie that defends it as being OK to question and share about it from this life.",1294358400,23,2482,4.756380510440835

If he wants to ponder what comes next for him and for all of us, that's just fine with me and I'm going to watch while he does it.  It turns out I did it for Hereafter on the day of my mother's expected death at a few years older than Clint.  So I was an easy mark for the emotions of Hereafter, which are -- to be honest -- kind of predictable and manipulative, but also very entertaining.  The opening scene, by now famous, is awesome (and not in the overused slangy sense) and I'm glad to see Matt Damon and Eastwood working together again.  Neither Hereafter nor Invictus is superb, but if they continue collaborating something one day will be.  A bit of droll humor runs in the necessary subplot of Marie LeLay's (Cecile de France) proposed book about the foibles of Francois Mitterrand, which turns into something else entirely, much to the chagrin of her planned publisher.

4389361,2,B004IWR06S,"Having seen and enjoyed Gran Torino in the theatres, and then purchasing the dvd, I was looking forward to Clint Eastwood's work in Hereafter.

As I was watching Hereafter, I allowed myself to get lost in the film, especially the scenes involving the fatherless twin boys, one of them  played by Frankie McLaren (Marcus), who did a great job.  These scenes involving the two boys and their mother, who was a alcoholic/drug  addict, were very heart wrenching, and at the same time very loving.  I could not help but feel for both the kids and their Mom who was so sick.

I will not go on with an entire outline, so I will fast forward towards the end of the film, when  Matt Damon's character, the reluctant psychic, finally meets with the 12 year old boy Marcus, who has just lost his twin brother in an accident,  was taken away from his mother, and is now  in a foster home.  So, you got the idea of what this kid is dealing with? Ok.

After Damon's character gives Marcus his reading, he tells him that his brother from the great beyond said ""he is him and I am you, and we are one"" ( I guess this is some New Age Hollywood mantra for:  Forget God).  Then he tells him that Marcus is now on his own.  What a message to tell a 12 year old.  Especially a 12 year old who has just been devastated by recent family tragedies.  HE'S ON HIS OWN!!!??

What I was so angry and upset about was how this poor kid's character was given no hope for the awful pain he was enduring.  Of course, at the very end of the film, all the main characters had the very mere mortal, cheesy, happy ending.  Please.

But nowhere in the film did Clint Eastwood, or the screenwriter Peter Morgan, ever acknowledge the Creator of the hereafter.  Nowhere in the film did I ever see any indication that God was in charge, or how Christ's Resurrection  plays a part in how most people in Western society view the afterlife.  Oh, there was the one scene where Marcus goes on line to view a Muslim man talking about death, and  Marcus ignores him, and then views another man talking about how knowing Christ would be helpful to understanding the afterlife, but this was shot down as well.

Look, to me it's very simple, unless people demand that the One, Living,  Loving God and His Holy Spirit be brought into Hollywood films more often, we will still receive the same results (like in the Hereafter) over and over again.  Hopefully, some big producers will allow some more writers and directors ( like they did with Secretariat, and The Blind Side) to let God's Love  shine more often.  There are millions of Americans who would pay good money (including me) to see more films like the two aforementioned.  Hey Hollywood, even our currency says ""In God we trust."" :)

4389362,1,B004IWR06S,"It's frustrating how bad ""Hereafter"" is. The topic, life after death, is fascinating. Almost all the actors are top notch in every scene. Cecile de France and Thierry Neuvic are both especially good, both gorgeous and moving in their roles. Clint Eastwood's direction exemplifies seamless, slick, pro, Hollywood style. The problem is the script. It's idiotic, manipulative, and shallow. Worst of all, its emptiness and ineptitude often produces sheer boredom. You will learn more about death watching a cable TV afternoon show on professional psychics, or having a long talk with a friend about paranormal phenomena, or reading online accounts of near death encounters. When a movie can't get any deeper than these readily available alternatives, it truly is wasting your money and your time.

There are a couple of really great scenes in ""Hereafter."" The best scene is the very first one; maybe you can check into a theater showing the film just to catch it. The opening scene depicts a couple of gorgeous French tourists, Marie and Didier (Cecile de France and Thierry Neuvic) lounging in their hotel bedroom in Southeast Asia. Marie remembers that they must purchase presents for his kids. She ventures to a market; he stays in bed. And the 2004 Tsunami hits. The special effects here are one hundred percent convincing - it's as if you are viewing actual film footage of the tsunami rising from the ocean and flooding the beach, hotels, the streetside markets where Marie shops. Utility poles snap and fall, one after the other, like so many twigs. Cars are taken up and become waterborne projectiles, mercilessly hitting and drowning humans. Marie is shown, bruised and battered, falling through water, detritus, past other bodies. What's so remarkable about this scene is that it emphasizes the human tragedy of the tsunami, rather than the ooo-aaa of watching a virtuoso special effects scene.

But there are too many other scenes that are completely shallow, silly, and manipulative. A character is introduced, built-up, and killed off in record time. Even as this character makes his appearance, and is shown, with brisk efficiency, to be someone you could love, you realize that this character has no place in the plot, no place in the movie, except as someone the movie is teaching you to like so he can be killed off and used to serve the film's theme of life after death. You get it that the film is doing nothing in this character's scenes but milking your tears. The movie really lost me with these scenes, and those who have seen the movie know exactly which character I'm talking about.

Another character is introduced only to make the situation of retired psychic George Lonegan (Matt Damon) more pathetic. As soon as this character appears onscreen, you know exactly why she's there, how and why she will let George down, and so you can't become emotionally involved in any scene she's in.

Damon is never believable as George the psychic. George is written as a completely passive, socially retarded loser who doesn't know how to say ""No"" or how to make a living. Damon is most convincing as a cocky character. Again and again George attempts, and fails, to say ""No"" to people, and Damon can't make these scenes believable or poignant or make them make any sense at all. In their repetitiveness, they become frustrating, and ultimately laughable. In addition to being a passive pushover, George isn't very nice. He's shown behaving very badly toward a child and any sympathy the audience might have had for him is lost.

Even the lighting is handled manipulatively. When George is in apartments with several available lamps, he lights only the lamps in adjacent rooms, and conducts his psychic readings half in darkness. No reason is giving for this, except that we all know that darkness is more spooky.

There's a completely unbelievable scene where a small child visits several psychics in London in one day. I know adults who couldn't handle the logistics of such a field trip: tracking psychics down, locating and traveling to one venue after another, paying admission fees, reserving seats ... and a small child does this? Not. Took me right out of the movie.

The ending of this movie is awkward and completely unbelievable and utterly absent any emotional truth. It seemed an attempt by the screenwriter to put a big, fat bow on the empty mess that preceded it.

Two relatively minor complaints: most of the film follows three completely disconnected storylines in three different countries, and there is no good reason for this. All three storylines could have easily taken place in one country, and the viewer would be spared the annoyance of having to read subtitles. When actors as good looking as de France and Neuvic are onscreen, you don't want to miss a shot. There are a few blatantly anti-Christian scenes that are just laughable in their absurdity. There is a Christian conspiracy to keep knowledge of the afterlife publicly known? Christians are preventing scientists from researching this topic? Yeah, sure, if you think throwing that into your movie will sell tickets or add depth. Good luck with that.",1289692800,24,5145,4.953650057937428

STARRING: Matt Damon, Cecile De France, Frankie McLaren, George McLaren, Jay Mohr, Bryce Dallas Howard and Richard Kind

WRITTEN BY: Peter Morgan

DIRECTED BY: Clint Eastwood

Rated: PG - 13
Genre: Drama
Release Date: 22 October 2010
Review Date: 09 November 2010

It's amazing how much Matt Damon and Clint Eastwood give us out of so little, in Hereafter. Eastwood directs Damon for the second time, this time as a psychic named George who can communicate with the loved ones you've lost, just by touching you. The reason I say they give us so much out of so little, is because we never see anything other than Damon's flawless acting.

George touches your hands and can instantly sense who has passed in your life and can relay their message to you. What makes Hereafter so likeable is that we believe George can do this, from Damon's performance alone. He's not a quack, he doesn't have an ego about his gift and he's just so terribly convincing that even if we didn't know his as Matt Damon, we'd still find him convincing.

And saying he doesn't have an ego about it is an understatement by the way. George hates his so called gift and would sooner refer to it as a curse. His talent has left him in a world of bitter and cold isolation and he's fed up with it. We learn that he once made quite a name for himself and a respectable living but has long since given up on all that and taken a mediocre paying job just to get by.

The story isn't only about Damon's character George, but it largely is, and it's the one I found the most enjoyable out of the three that are shown to us.

We also meet a lovely French woman named Marie, played by Cecile De France, who has had a near death experience and witnessed a small taste of an afterlife. It should be noted that we will be seeing more of this gifted actress in films to come.

The third story is of a set of young twins who do anything and everything together and for one another, until a brutal accident changes their lives forever.

We cut back and forth between the three stories, realizing that eventually they will come to a head. They do, and it's marvelously done.

But let's go back to the George story. Jay Mohr plays George's brother and is so adamant that George should give his talent a second chance in order to help others - that George just might. In the meantime, he has been taking a cooking class at night and has met the woman of his dreams there: Melanie, played by Bryce Dallas Howard - who by the way had better be the next MJ, in the upcoming Spider-Man reboot. She's perfect for it.

These two, meaning Damon and Howard, together in a scene, was simply electrifying. They acted and Eastwood directed them, in some of the best romantic scenes that I have ever seen in a film. It was brilliant because they are both experienced adults, but George has been out of the game for so long that it's almost like high school again for him, and for us watching them. They both want each other, but don't seem too keen at first, as to if the feeling is a mutual one.

The scene with the blindfold is a pristine blend of eroticism, romance and temptation, and is directed beautifully by Clint Eastwood. In addition to the acting and the directing, I just really liked the idea of two people falling for one another as partners in a nightly cooking class. Because I was so invested in these moments, I was absolutely riveted with anger at what happens between the two of them, that it nearly split me in two; even though I saw it coming from a mile away.

But the movie goes on, and it remains good and ends as originally as it opened. It makes us think, it stimulates us and it entertains us. You should know that it is very slow however, and you need to be ready for that when you sit down to watch it. But if you invest the time and the proper amount of attention, you will not be disappointed. And this is important subject matter folks. If you haven't given thought to what your hereafter holds in store for you -perhaps you should.",1289520000,4,4017,4.365951742627346
4389365,4,B004IWR06S,"Eastwood the Director may wind up in history more well-known than Eastwood the Actor, and for the man who played Dirty Harry and The Man With No Name, in addition to brilliant starring roles in his own films such as Unforgiven and Million Dollar Baby - that is saying something.

Hereafter is a film with three different plots headed toward a common destination.  In one strand Cecile De France plays Marie, a Parisian Journalist who is saved from drowning in a tsunami and finds that she can't extricate her private and professional lives from the experience.  Frankie and George McLaren play twin brothers Marcus and Jason.  The brothers have a drug-addicted single mother and share the task of shielding her and themselves from the authorities before tragedy strikes.  In the final thread Matt Damon plays George Lonegan, the character you know the other characters are moving toward.

George has the ability to talk to the dead through contact with people who have connections to the deceased.  He explains halfway through the film that he developed this ability after a near-death experience, and although his brother (played by Jay Mohr) thinks ""the gift"" is a gold-mine that should be exploited, George tries explaining repeatedly that it is a curse rather than a blessing.  (Any person George touches floods him with images of the dearly departed.)

The film moves slowly.  After the opening Marie doesn't want to be a journalist so much as explore the world of near-death experiences.  We see young Marcus visiting sham psychics.  In a series of scenes we see Damon's George reluctantly give ""readings"".  One of the strengths of the film is that it contrasts the work of the fake psychics, who use clues obtained reading body language and facial expressions, with the dilemma of a person like George, who can't turn his power off, which invariably makes it impossible for him to develop actual relationships. How can you be ""normal"" if every time you touch a fellow human - you see dead people? Bryce Dallas Howard plays a pleasant woman George meets in cooking class.  George attempts to hide his psychic ability from her, but when she finds out, she pressures him into a reading.  What begins looking like a simple parlor trick instead rips open decades-old wounds.

For action addicts the film moves glacially after the tsunami scene, but the emotional payoff at the end is worth the trip.",1289433600,69,2401,4.920595533498759
4389366,3,B004IWR06S,"HEREAFTER deserves a very mixed review because it deals only superficially with the supernatural and offers no real answers despite the fact that its craftsmanship is undeniable.

After a brilliant start with the tsunami wreaking havoc as giant waves sweep over an entire village beach front, I expected HEREAFTER was about to delve into and explore the possibilities of an afterlife.

Instead, we examine the lives of three separate individuals whose lives are about to converge rather unconvincingly at the finale. Meantime, we have no idea where the story is going until the final scene. There's an uneven quality to the thread of the story with many scenes played too long before getting near the payoff.

But overall, the acting is excellent, particularly that of the little boys, FRANKIE and GEORGE McLAREN, who play the twin brothers effectively, CECILE DeFRANCE, the French woman who almost drowns during the tsunami and her lover (THIERRY NEUVIC), who makes the deepest impression as far as acting and charisma goes. MATT DAMON is effective as the psychic who wants nothing more to do with his ""gift."" But at all times, the script gives nothing more than a surface treatment of the hereafter and avoids delving into a deeper look at the supernatural implied by the film's title.

HEREAFTER could have been a great film. As it is, it's uneven, slowly paced, and avoids the paranormal aspects that its title implies will be touched, especially since its main character is a psychic. But on the credit side, the opening sequence is amazing for its special effects. Unfortunately, what follows is not as absorbing, challenging or thought-provoking as it ought to be.

The cooking class scenes between BRYCE DALLAS HOWARD and MATT DAMON were dragged out and less than satisfying, due to her irritating habit of delivering giggles with each line to suggest the airiness of her character. Furthermore, their relationship is never fully explored once he agrees to do a psychic reading. She just disappears from the plot line after foolishly begging Damon to practice his skill. The script might have taken a better turn if it resolved their relationship in a meaningful way for the conclusion. Likewise, there are other scenes that are totally irrelevant and give the story a lack of focus.

An attempt to end the story of our three main characters on a bright note is only so-so in effect. I'd have preferred a deeper look at the supernatural than this hints at being and the ending just seemed downbeat and contrived.

The acting throughout is uniformly fine and special praise is due MATT DAMON, THIERRY NEUVIC and the McLAREN brothers, all giving top-rated performances. Clint Eastwood's direction is fine but the script presented too many obstacles for any director to overcome.",1289174400,43,2784,5.026030368763558
4389367,1,B004IWR06S,"This movie was terrible.  It had absolutely nothing going for it besides an awesome tsunami scene.  The acting was downright dull, the soundtrack was a three note guitar track widely dispersed and there was little if no substance to make any kind of viewer sit back and say, 'Now that was a good idea'.  I had no idea Clint Eastwood directed this flick until the credits starting rolling (which felt like a marathon just to get to).  I went to it on a date with my wife (who really just wanted to see it for Matt Damon) and I had no clue what it was about (and I'm still not really sure).  I guess the movie makes a weak attempt at explaining the importance of the afterlife to three complete strangers (two of which fall in love for reasons which make little sense).  Shame on you Clint.  After Mystic River and Gran Torino and Million Dollar Baby? The only good thing I can say about this way-too-long-waste-of-hard-earned-cash is that the people did seem real.  You want some good movies about the afterlife?  Try the Sixth Sense or Flatliners or What Dreams may Come.  At least those movies have a pulse and flow.  I am not comparing this movie to those, but instead stating that a movie about the afterlife has more potential than this two hour snore-fest did.  Wait for DVD, and rent it at that.  Other than 'The Happening', this was the worse movie I have ever seen at the theater.",1289001600,10,1388,4.4603174603174605
4389368,1,B004IWR06S,"The Mrs. and I just had a fantastic $14 nap.  Not since M. Night Shyamalamadingdong's ""The Happening"" have I been so utterly board in a movie.  In fact, I'd prefer to credit this journey into the mundane to him rather than the typically brilliant, Clint Eastwood.

Roger Ebert says, Clint Eastwood's ""Hereafter"" considers the idea of an afterlife with tenderness, beauty and a gentle tact. I was surprised to find it enthralling. I don't believe in woo-woo, but then neither, I suspect, does Eastwood. Enthralling?  I was begging for the French couple to break into a fit of rage and stab one another to death. Anything.  Something.

I tend to agree more with Kyle Smith of the New York Post who writes, The movie drags, yet it feels like it's missing an hour.

It may have seemed slow in this flash/bang/whizz lightening speed laugh-a-minute, dripping blood and guts era of moviedom. However, I remember movies with plots that involved human beings in ordinary lives punctuated with extraordinary moments. A story worth getting caught up in. Humor and drama. And I guess by today's standards, those movies were slow. But the dialogue was worth listening to and remembering as you followed the characters through the story. As you participated with the characters, each and every one.

That's what I loved about ""Hereafter"". And that's why I could have lived in it another hour. At least.",1288828800,8,729,5.016528925619835
4389370,3,B004IWR06S,"I love Clint Eastwood's movies, I've seen all in the last 25+ years. The older Eastwood gets, the more thoughtful.
Hereafter is a movie, and psychics and the afterlife, which Clint at 80+ might be thinking about.

The action, the main action in the movie starts with a Tsunami in south east Asia. A lead character, Marie Lelay, played by Cecile de France, hard-edged news reporter gets caught in the rising waters, drowns, and has a near-death experience. She experiences the afterlife before coming back to this one. This experience changes her life from a skeptic. The other hero, George Lonegan, played by Matt Damon, is a reluctant psychic. There is also a young boy searching for answers about death. I won't reveal more of the plot.

This is a gentle and thoughtful movie, well acted and well directed, but it leaves a lot of questions unanswered. Like why the Damon is so reluctant to help people? Why he feels compelled to tell people all the negative things he ""sees""? I have met psychics who do this on a daily basis, who are much better, much more psychic, who tell their clients more than the Damon character. They are not bothered by having this gift at all.

The main action here is the tsunami, in the first ten minutes. The rest is love story with a lot of synchronicities. These synchronicities tend to happen to and around psychics and not to most skeptics. The world (or our experience of it) expands or contracts depending upon our expectation of it (!) I had expected Eastwood would do more with his themes, but he didn't. he chose to stick close the the generally agreed reality. I would have liked to see more hereafter in Hereafter.

Actually there is an amazing convergence of opinion from people who have experienced near-death and psychics about what to expect in the afterlife (though not from organized religions).  If you have no not heard of these things you will find this movie fascinating. Very mainstream, really. From all acccounts I've heard, this is a short glimpse of what to expect, ""you won't be alone""...",1288656000,2,2046,4.719887955182073
4389371,5,B004IWR06S,"Clint Eastwood, one of my favorite actors of my youth, now partially retired as an actor is now dedicated to film directing. Im very very impressed by this film as Clint covers new ground dealing with life after death experiences and psychic phenomena that like the film suggests, there are people out there that have this GIFT and others are scammers.

PLOT - This movie is 3 stories going on at the same time: A woman in Tsumani on vacation that experiences death. Two close twins and one of the dies and Matt Damon a retired psychic that was laid off and decided to take a break and go to England. With a magical twist of fate, all these 3 people meet each other at a Book Fair in London.

This movie is a masterpiece and is real proof to me that MATT DAMON as an actor can cover a lot of ground which is a talent that not all actors are able to do.

4389372,4,B004IWR06S,"It doesn't matter if you come from London, Paris or San Francisco. It doesn't matter if we speak the same language.
We live in the same world, undergo similar experiences, and respond to those experiences in different ways.  Some of those experiences offer insights into something more that lies beyond the everyday reality you can see hear of touch.

A female French tv journalist has a near death experience in an island resort in the tsunami which jolts her out of her ordinary everyday reality. A 12 year old London boy copes with the sudden death of his twin brother goes into foster care while his mother goes into rehab, and seeks answers, and Matt Damon plays a reluctant 'real' psychic  in San Francisco who people seek in their quest for answers. He has the gift which he considers a curse.  If you are like me, as you watch you wonder if there is an invisible thread that will somehow connect these three stories, will their paths somehow cross.

Hereafter shows a major shift in direction for Clint Eastwood, and Matt Damon.  All of Clint Eastwood movies tend to be grounded in reality, whereas Hereafter moves to a metaphysical level.  Some people who usually like Clint Eastwood movies won't like this transition.  So, you have been warned.  Matt Damon often plays action heroes, not renowned for their psychic abilities.

Matt Damon plays a blue blue collar worker who has spurned his spiritual gift in favor of labor.  He used to be famous, and now chooses to be anonymous and his brother encourages him to return to this potentially lucrative life.  As the movie progresses and we see the interaction between him and Bryce Dallas Howard, (Ron Howard's daughter), we understand how his gift which is activated by touch, blocks him from true intimacy and prevents him from having a proper romantic relationship.

I particularly enjoyed watching the San Francisco sequences. The bar scene between Matt Damon, and his brother played by Jay Mohr was filmed at the Final Final, my local bar, and he sits at the exact same spot I often sit at.  In fact, I had a near Clint experience. He left the bar, after one of the patrons got a little out of control, and I arrived twenty minutes later.  Darn..Can you imagine.  Clint Eastwood practically at your doorstep, and you miss him.

I loved watching the local scenes, many of the interior shots were filmed in real locations, you get the sense of an ordinary cramped walk up apartment in San Francisco, and the flash of the Hobart Building, before the office scene. This adds to the authenticity of the movie.  How many movies have you seen where somebody has a regular job yet lives in a fancy loft.

A couple of scenes in this movie I thought were remarkable, one where where he spoon feeds her while she is blindfolded.  I also love the scene where he gives the final reading, and ad libs a comforting message even though you can tell from his  facial expression that he has lost the connection.  Even real psychics can be fake sometimes.  Beautifully played.

It's worth mentioning that other than Matt Damon, this cast is mostly full of unknowns, the standard of the actors is amazing.  English actress, Lyndsey Marshal demonstrates tremendous presence, as Martin's mother.  Bryce Dallas Howard though young looks like a long ago movie star.  Cecile de France, the Belgian born French actress, has a certain chic appeal, and is a well established actress.

If you are like me sometimes when you see a movie, you forget about it almost immediately, I find myself still thinking about this one a week later.  If you are curious to go see this one, you still won't know what you don't already know.

If you like this movie, I recommend Aftershock, which has some parallels with this movie.  Set in China, instead of a tsunami we have an earthquake, and a mother is faced with the crushing dilemma of only being able to save one of her twin children the girl or the boy.  By lifting the concrete beam under which they are trapped one will be saved, and the other will die. Based on the real event of the Tangshan earthquake in which 240,000 people perished, it's one of the most powerful of the year, and sure to be nominated for best foreign movie.",1288396800,3,4208,4.667571234735414
4389373,3,B004IWR06S,"I was a little disappointed in the film.  I'm not certain what I expected, but this seemed a little flat.  I suppose when you start out with a tsunami and drop down to private experiences with death, you go from shock to flat.  The only real highlight in the midst of it was the near miss with death of the surviving twin, Marcus.

The acting was quite good.  I was especially impressed with Marcus, whose twin was killed in an accident, and his mother, whose personal problems had reduced the family to a shambles.  The acting here was intense and very real.

In all, the film had the feeling of an assembly line process.  Everyone did their bit on their own home turf according to availability, and the featured actors met on common ground for the dnouement.  No fuss, no muss, no bother.  Sometimes that works really well.

4389374,3,B004IWR06S,"HEREAFTER is an engrossing but frustrating film.  My interest was held throughout, yet when it was all over, I was extremely disappointed in how little my interest added up to.

Directed by Clint Eastwood, HEREAFTER would appear to be exploring the old question ""what happens to us after we die,"" but really it is a character study of a couple of folks who have very atypical experiences with death.  Ultimately, it isn't terribly meaningful because it is NOT universal.

The film starts out with a bang.  We meet Marie (Cecile de France), a TV journalist on vacation in Thailand with her producer boyfriend.  She heads out of the hotel to do some last minute shopping, and in minutes, finds herself facing the tsunami that so famously devastated that region of the world some years ago.  Eastwood is not known for spending big bucks on special effects, but these scenes are fairly effective in their depiction of the awesome destructive force of the killer wave (when we see the wave gathering strength by sucking in all the water from the beach...that is pretty scary).  Marie drowns in the water, and feels herself headed towards a light where shadowy figures beckon to her.  She is brought back to our world, though...but she has been deeply changed by her experience.

We then meet George (Matt Damon), a very shy man living along and working on a loading dock.  He seems unusually withdrawn from the world.  We discover early on that he is a psychic (apparently the real deal) with an ability to see beyond the grave and communicate with the dearly departed to send messages to their loved ones.  His ability is a compelling temptation for all who encounter him (""read me!!""), but the intimate knowledge he gathers from virtual strangers also alienates him from those folks.  His slimy brother (Jay Mohr) essentially tells him to capitalize on his abilities (""with great power comes great responsibility"") but for George, he is cursed, not gifted.

The third leg of the story is about young British twins Marcus & Jason (played by twins Frankie & George McLaren).  Jason, the stronger and more outgoing brother, is killed, and poor Marcus is sent to a foster home to stew not only about the separation from his drug-addicted mother but about his loss.  The 12-year-old is adrift...compelled to find some way to reach out to his brother again.

All three of these characters carry a sadness with them.  Marcus is obviously saddled with grief, and Damon with loneliness...but it is Marie who is perhaps the most tormented.  She was on top of the world...a celebrity journalist who was also a model.  The world at her feet.  Yet her near-death experience leaves her feeling separate from everyone.  She wants to research her experiences and write about them. Everyone else just urges her to be quiet about it and take some time off from work.  As her career passes her by, she becomes more convinced that her experience was a revelation.

It seems unlikely that these 3 characters would ever meet...but the plot has other contrivances in mind.  I didn't mind...I expected the ultimate meeting of these three to come and for something of import or relevance to happen.  I was left disappointed.

But the film is interesting in large part because the three leads give outstanding performances that are well worth checking out.  McLaren does a nice job of showing the particular kind of grief a child feels.  DeFrance (previously only known to me from her fierce performance in HIGH TENSION) is a striking performer, and makes her character tough but damaged.  And Damon gives another nice performance, underplaying admirably (although occasionally coming across just a little like his character in GOOD WILL HUNTING).  Here is another actor who seems to give nuanced work under the direction of Eastwood.

Another thing that bothered me was the feeling that the entire Tsunami scene existed only to create some really cool previews, so that folks would be more likely to come to the movie.  There is no real reason that Marie needed to have her experience in that famous, true-life tragedy.  She could have drowned in a swimming pool in Milwaukee and had the same shattering, personal experience.  Certainly the scenes are dramatically staged...but they are utterly out of character with the rest of the movie.

HEREAFTER promises much but delivers little, beyond some really nice performances.  For me, that is just enough to recommend it to audiences who understand they are about to see a quiet, slow-paced movie; not some kind of supernatural thriller as the previews hint at.  I just wished that all the hard work had added up to more.",1288396800,3,4641,4.8861892583120206
4389375,5,B004IWR06S,"There are three reasons to see ""Hereafter"":

Clint Eastwood's ever-burgeoning genius as a director.

The ghoulish coincidence that, simultaneously with the movie's opening this past week, a volcanic eruption and ensuing tsunami wave killed 300 Indonesians, and left 20,000 homeless--an occurrence powerfully depicted in the film's opening minutes.

And the Number #1 reason is that ""Hereafter"" introduces to the world a great new talent and face.

Among those viewers possibly put off by the film is bound to be Catherine Deneuve.  For half a century, ever since her world-wide success in ""Belle du Jour,"" Deneuve has been ""the official face of France.""  Literally--for her perfect but rather bland features have been the model for painted or sculpted allegorical representations inside all government buildings of ""la belle France.""  But today, coincidental with the formidable Deneuve's puffy new look (she quit smoking), Mr. Eastwood is the first to show Americans the new face not only of France, or Europe--but the whole global community of strong, sensual, intelligent, and forthright youth.  This Face could belong to a beautiful female or to a beautiful male:  lips! cheekbones! a jawline as determined as Clint's!  This Face, conceived and born in itsy-bitsy Belgium, blows right off the big screen Hollywood's Blubbery-lipped Jolie or Aging, Crossed-eyed JR.  This fresh new Face belongs in the Valhalla inhabited by such cinematic beauties as Garbo, Lamarr, Dietrich, Hayworth, Taylor, Loren--or Grant, Power, Clift, Dean, Eastwood, Curtis, Newman, Olivier, O'Toole, Connery, rookie Cillian Murphy.  This newcomer, even after nearly drowning in a tsunami wave, is gorgeous! natural! luminously thrilling!  Oh, her name?  Oh, Jesus, this actress is saddled with a truly, TRULY awful name.  We can only hope that with increasing adulation she changes it to something more suitable, like  ..Esmeralda.. Nefertiti ... Beatrice ... Mata Hari.  Her name?  OK, ok, it's:

Cecile de France--and like Hercule Poirot, she not's French.  She's universal.",1288310400,2,2054,5.522435897435898

8431293,3,B004IWR06S,"George is gifted--or as he'd call it...cursed.

What would you do if you had a window into the other side? The hereafter? How would it change you? Is this good? Or bad?

In Hereafter, those are the questions posed (indirectly as much as directly) throughout the movie. Alongside George's story, we have French journalist Marie, whose harrowing survival of the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami left her irrevocably changed; and young Markus, a British boy that's lost someone close to him... Through their singular tragedy and experiences about death, their paths eventually cross, and in unexpected ways.

This movie doesn't try to answer anything. And that's probably the main reason it fails to really convey any point or message other then use the concept of this phenomena of people on earth who have some connection to whatever is after this life as a byline. That's fine. It is. It's interesting in and of itself but the writers and producers didn't really understand why they were making a film about this very concept and just tried to tug at our hearts with 3 characters who are trying to deal with loss and tragedy in various degrees.

The performances are wonderful. Nuanced and well meaning but because there was no real point, the movie just got lost in itself. We have George, whose abilities are presented as genuine. He's a man tortured by his 'abilities' and runs away from it without really asking himself why and what he's supposed to do. He's waylaid by his older brother who only wishes to exploit his talents and because he's never tried to really understand himself and this thing he's stuck with, gets lost in translation. The two parallel storylines, Marie and Markus, are supposed to help explain things and to a degree they do. But again, the central figure is George, and since the writers and producers failed to address that angle head on, everything centers around him and his narrative. His storyline competes with the other two so much so that whatever was supposed to be conveyed in his POV is so muddled it messes up the whole movie.

Half the movie progresses in a linear fashion with all three storylines kind of complementing each other but then towards the end, we get this random shift in the direction that makes little sense. In that, all three find themselves in London and for no particular reason other than...that's how it was written. Granted, the writers tried to weave in this subtext about George's fascination with Charles Dickens as a way to explain his reason to going to London when he has his 'epiphany' (also 'sort of' explained but delivered in a weak way), and it works--kinda--and then drawing in Marie there for reasons that are 'kind of ' believable but ultimately, at this point, the movie really disintegrates. This leads to an odd and perplexing ending of his 'connection' to Marie after a brief meeting at a book fair and their eventual meeting. And this concept that they're 'meant for each other' idea that makes no sense.

Again...this movie is just a drama with no real point. It tried to 'go there' but somewhere along the way, everyone attached to this movie realized they had no idea why they were making a movie about the hereafter other than that it was different. Now, did I hate it? No! I actually enjoyed the performances and the first half held a lot of promise until the second half which floundered and did nothing but try to end the movie in a sensible way that utterly failed.

It was just too underdeveloped, conceptually, and no follow-through by the writers and producers. The acting is lovely. It's not on the actors at all. I think if the'd concentrated on just Matt Damon's character throughout the movie instead of the other two interweaving storylines, this movie could have been less wandering and haphazard. All in all, a nice diversion and somewhat memorable but nothing special.",1524182400,,3880,4.799401197604791
