2909773,5,B000TSJ03G,"Being a flyfisher makes a person almost an equiptment junkie.  This video reveals be it condensed, a view into the growing, harvest, grading, shipping, and eventual use of bamboo for the ""cane flyfishing rod"" we covet.  A little use of the finished rod on some beautiful streams is just the ""foam line"" we dream about. Highly recommended.",1330646400,,338,4.912280701754386
2909774,5,B000TSJ03G,Very informative DVD and how the bamboo is harvested and what is done to the bamboo before it is shipped and what is done to build a rod,1231459200,2,136,3.892857142857143
2909775,5,B000TSJ03G,"Although I had been a keen fly fisherman for some time I had never owned a cane rod. After watching Trout Grass I have a totally different view of the cane rod and it,s makers and exponents. This has to be one of the best put together doco that I have ever had the pleasure to have watched.(over and over) Even if you are not a fly fishing fan you would still get a great deal of enjoyment from this movie. Be warned, if you are a fly fisher you ""will"" want a cane rod after watching Trout Grass.",1218758400,5,496,4.02020202020202
2909776,5,B000TSJ03G,"I do not own any splitcane rods and to be honest I always
tease my fellow flyfishing friends with their bamboo rods
as being ""not of this time"".
Still there is something magic about splitcane as anyone
who has casted with these rods will know.
This documentation tries to show that magic and I must say
they have done a great job.
The whole process of buidling the rod from the Tonkin harvesting in
China to the rod building in Montana is beautifully filmed and narrated.
It was a pleasure to see the finished rod in use on a Montana river.
A very worthwhile title to own.",1207958400,2,572,4.355140186915888
2909777,5,B000TSJ03G,"You don't need to be a fly fisherman to appreciate this extraordinary film that is part travelogue, part ""how to"" instructional and part nature doc.  The imagery is stunning and the film is never less than engaging. You won't regret buying this film.",1201651200,2,250,4.813953488372093
2909778,5,B000TSJ03G,"Trout Grass is a delightful documentary that follows the making of ""split-cane"" fly-fishing rods from the lush bamboo forests of China to the delicate craftsmanship of the rod makers in Montana and eventually into the hands of fly-fishers. The film is both visually stunning and quite entertaining. The scenes, alone, in China with the vast acres of bamboo forest are breath-taking.

Told in a linear fashion, the story is told through a whole host of characters - the Chinese women who collect the ""cane,"" the American importer who must sort through thousands of samples, the craftsman who constructs the rod to the eventual fly-fishermen who swear by the final product. Of note, there is an excellent scene in the bamboo forest with a fly-fishing expert who we learn is the son of the legendary Hoagy Carmicheal. It is through him you learn that out of 1200 species, this very specific Tonkin bamboo cane is the ""only one you can successfully make a rod with."" And once I discovered that bamboo is actually designated a ""grass,"" the film's title became quite clever.

This documentary is a quick 45 minutes, perhaps too quick. I found myself fascinated with the meticulous detail that goes into creating and fashioning these fly rods, and ultimately amazed at the level of complexity required. All from a natural material I see everywhere but knew little about.

Turning what may seem like an ordinary item into some rather extraordinary, Trout Fish tells the story of making of a ""split-cane"" fly rod and ultimately, the love for fly-fishing. As the narrator notes, it isn't just about a fishing pole, to him it is actually a ""magic piece of grass"" in his hand.

I not only highly recommend this film to avid fly-fishers, but also to anyone who enjoys a well written and beautifully shot documentary.",1195084800,11,1803,4.882352941176471
2909779,5,B000TSJ03G,"not being a fly fisherwoman i wasn't sure how i'd like this film, but that didn't matter. it was magnificent and fascinating. i had no idea the amount of detail and work that went in to create a fly fishing rod. the scenes were beautifully filmed. it really was a visual treat. i loved it!",1193961600,9,289,4.2727272727272725
2909780,5,B000TSJ03G,"Wow. This amazing film feels like watching some of my favorite passages from David James Duncan's ""The River Why"". It takes a look at a rather obscure pursuit; that of building a bamboo fly rod for the pleasure of fly fishing. But, like any good story should, the heart of this film lies deep below the surface of that summary. Duncan (who wrote, narrated and appears in this documentary) explores the methods of constructing a fly rod by taking us all the way to the source of the material in China. Here we see beautifully captured landscapes and a crazy look at the growth and harvest of this magical plant they call bamboo. The music is awesome (some mix of Eastern sounding Chinese instruments and a very Western banjo?) as we watch a group of women careening their way down a hillside with a small wooden cart loaded with a ton of 20' poles! These poles go all the way to Montana where they are crafted into fly rods.

But really, the prize of this film is unwrapped on the rivers of Montana where Duncan explains the lure of angling and moving water. Anyone who has felt the pull of wild rivers or fishing or is just curious about any of this should really enjoy this film!",1191196800,3,1180,4.43778801843318

2909792,5,B000TSJ03G,"This was very interesting movie to watch, it intricately detailed the entire life of a bamboo cane from the forests of China to a shop in Montana. I enjoyed the level of detail paid to the lives surrounding the bamboo industry, especially those in China that worked so super hard to harvest the cane stalks without the knowledge of the intended purpose (which undoubtedly would have baffled them). This movie also showed the culture surrounding the bamboo fly rod and the craftsmanship involved in building one. Excellent showcase that made me excited to trade in my graphite rod for fine quality bamboo!",1441584000,,604,4.931372549019608

It's narrated by David James Duncan, author of The River Why, and features sequences with Hoagy Carmichael (whose book is responsible for the revival of interest in building bamboo rods), Glenn Brackett (one of the best contemporary rod-builders), and Tom McGuane (novelist and author of wonderful essays on angling).

2909806,3,B000TSJ03G,"Initially more like a travel log, most of which could have been covered in about 10 minutes, if the intention was to get to the production of a cane rod. Nonetheless, Interesting information regarding growing, cultivation, cutting, selecting, transporting of bamboo, as well as the intimacy of the importers relationship with the Chinese people and culture, etc. More of an ethereal overview of cane as a fishing rod, rather than, ""this is how it's done"", although there is a bit of that. If you are looking for a ""How to"" this is not it. If you are looking for an interesting over view and the psyche reasons why certain anglers use cane and why the builders builds with it, with lots of dialog, then pour yourself a cup of tea and settle in.",1416182400,,743,4.593984962406015

2909814,5,B000TSJ03G,"Excellent rendering of the local economy surrounding the harvest of bamboo in southern China. Gives one a sense of the importance of this commodity to the livelihood of the regional population and their efforts to keep up with the needs of brokers who provide the product to the quality cane rod makers building finely crafted tools from this unique material. Fine discussions with top rod makers, and an excellent segment on the actual crafting of top quality rods. And, of course, just enough smattering of scenes of well executed fly fishing for trout in beautiful locations to tease those true anglers with a love of being on the water.",1388966400,,640,4.8807339449541285

2909816,3,B000TSJ03G,"The film quality is good but this to me is more of an infomercial for high-end Fly Rods. The harvesting of the bamboo tries to imply this is work suited for women.
I would like to see the makers of this film and any one who uses a fly rod to work for a month as these women do.
After watching this film I went on-line to read about fly rods and found how much information was not included in the film. Too bad it is only part of the story.",1372550400,,439,3.8351648351648353

It also, brought back old memories and I could totally relate to the narrative.  Fly-Fishing is not just a sport it's kind-of a spiritual thing to those who really love to fish and love nature.  One, of the most easy to watch documentaries I've seen.  You don't even have to know anything about Trout Grass to find this one well worth your time.",1372550400,,486,4.4772727272727275
2909818,3,B000TSJ03G,"Too much time spent getting metaphysical.  I guess if you fly-fish (I don't) you might like those parts.  Some are quite long and just show a couple of guys fishing while the narrator waxes poetic.  I really enjoyed the first part, in China.  I wonder if anyone has taken the time to actually show the finished product and how the rods are used to the Chinese who supply the bamboo.",1371945600,,382,4.414285714285715
2909819,3,B000TSJ03G,"Watched this with my husband who is really into fishing. It was interesting, but a little slow. There was a lot of waxing poetic about the beauty of fly fishing, a little too much in my opinion. Very beautiful scenery and nice narration. The history of the rod was interesting. If it were any longer I probably would've turned it off though.",1371254400,,341,4.516129032258065

8210799,5,B000TSJ03G,Wonderful documentary that highlights the appeal and practicality of Bamboo flyrods. It' begins in China and then to Montana where a rod is made for the camera. The only disappointment is that they did not really show the details of certain aspects of the making but only gave you a general idea of the process. So this is not where you want to learn how to make them but all the same it's a fine movie. I was left with a very impractical but heady lust for a bamboo rod to fish with someday. Maybe I will get one someday.,1481760000,,522,4.23
