442543,5,6302255848,"I had this movie on VHS for years, but I wanted it on DVD too. (I'd also purchase it on Instant Video if it were available!). Rutger Hauer has been my favorite actor for a very long time - he plays his part  extremely well, whether is be a good guy or a bad guy. Personally, I like it when he's the good guy. This movie entertained me and kept me interested for the whole time - and that's what I'm looking for in a movie. I liked the story this movie told. 5 stars from me!",1451433600,2,474,3.88659793814433

442607,4,6302255848,"This is a really well done movie.  First of all, Joan Chen was not in this movie.  I got this first on video when it came out.  It is good enough to see about 30 times without ever getting bored.  Hauer is a chameleon- he;s either a really good guy or a really bad guy.  Hauer likes playing evil guys as a didactic lesson.  In real life, he is one of the most down to earth, very brilliant and funny men you will ever get to meet, if you get the chance.  H e runs an independent film school in the Netherlands. Early in his career, he was marketed as a sex symbol ""tall, blonde, blue eyes""  and later marketed for his talent.  He has worked with Stallone, Christian Bale, etc.  He has worked in many countries speaking native languages.  Hauer is a multi linguist from the Netherlands who inflects a broad newscasters'''''' ideal Midwestern dialect. He has done everything from bounty hunter films to soldier hero.  He has worked with Joan Chen, Vince D'nofrio, Michelle Pheiffer, Eric Roberts, and many known stars....  In the Netherlands he is an icon.  He devoes his time to an organization he founded Starfish International, which helps African AIDs victims.  Hauer likes to give back,,  H e can spend a few years living on a house boat, and has been known to be a ""clean freak:. He got involved in this movie because he felt government was far to involved in our lives. They were even measuring the time it took to shower (like in Hawaii or Texas!!!) Anyway, WEDLOCK refers to  collars placed around prisoners necks so they do not escape- or they get electrocuted.  Its a movie well worth watching.  And any interview with Hauer you can dig up at this point of his life is treasure,  If yu can get Soldiers of orange  or Kejitie Tiipel. you won th e  acting  library of awards,  Never once does Hauer fail to stay in character.  He is amazing.",1411516800,5,1848,4.444776119402985
442608,3,6302255848,"It was good but it's not the same as the original as I remember it. There seems to be a lot of the prison scene cut out and him trying to figure out who his partner it. Another movie is Legend by Scott Ridley his directors cut is totally different than the original version, which to me isn't as good. The same with this movie which has been renamed wedlock.",1407628800,,358,4.128571428571429

442728,1,6302255848,"Very poorly done, I remember this when it was DeadLock and not
WedLock, my best guess is, when they, for what ever reason, decided
to rename it to WedLock, they had to dub in voice tracks to cover
up any words that mentioned DeadLock and let me tell you, the voice
sync is WAY off, I will email Amazon to see if I can return this
but being open, they may not allow it?
SO, my 1 star is for the VERY poor quality of the audio track sync
the movie itself is ok as I am a long time Rutger fan
So be forwarned of this audio glitch,

442729,4,6302255848,"I haven't seen this version yet, but if it's the exact same as when it was originally released as ""Deadlock"" (only available on VHS as far as I know), then it's a great early 90's movie.  Rutger Hauer has a certain 'style' of acting that you either love or hate, but if you like him, you'll like this movie.  Sure, his inevitable hook-up with Mimi's character is formulaic, but overall it's an interesting watch.",1206748800,3,412,4.554054054054054

It surely deserves *****.",1088467200,2,317,4.482758620689655
442731,3,6302255848,This is a fun movie.  Caught it on HBO. If you like breaking out of prison movies with some twist and turns; this one does it for you.  Joan Chen as the two timing bitch girlfriend is fun to watch.,1085443200,,197,3.9
442732,4,6302255848,"I'd like to see this one on DVD. It's a pretty good movie.

The idea behind it is extremely clever. Rutger Hauer (who was so hauntingly dangerous in _Blade Runner_ and so terrifyingly menacing in _The Hitcher_) is here cast somewhat against type as an electronics wizard who is enlisted into a diamond heist by a beautiful woman (Joan Chen) and then double-crossed. Off he goes to an experimental maximum-security prison.

The really clever bit is how the prison works. There are no walls holding the prisoners in; instead, each prisoner wears a collar with a charge of plastic explosive in it. Will it go off if they step outside the prison boundaries? Nope, that wouldn't be secure enough (or sadistic enough either). Instead, each prisoner is _paired_ with one other prisoner (in what is euphemistically called 'wedlock') and their collars attuned to each other so that if they get more than 100 yards apart -- powie. And since nobody knows which prisoner s/he is paired with, nobody can ever get more than 100 yards from anybody else.

Unless, that is, a pair of partners could _find out_ that they were partners and escape together. I won't give away any of the plot developments, but since Mimi Rogers is Hauer's co-star, you can probably do the math here.

The credible-at-best dialogue isn't going to win any awards or anything, but at least we don't run out of plot before we run out of movie. Stuff keeps happening right up to the end, most of it clever, some of it deliberately funny, and all of it kept personable by Hauer and Rogers. And there's some nice play (occasionally sharp-edged and satirical) with the concept of wedlock that makes the thing worth rewatching.

Drawbacks? The budget obviously wasn't very big here and it's pretty clear some corners were cut. Then, too, some of it is derivative of _Cool Hand Luke_, _Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid_, and any number of other loner-individualist-in-prison and/or two-outlaws-on-the-run flicks.

Nevertheless it's a good, reliable movie that won't disappoint you if you like this sort of thing. If it ever shows up on DVD, grab it; until then, the VHS version is serviceable if you can get it.

EDIT: It _has_ shown up on DVD, under its other title _Wedlock_.",1072569600,,2232,4.81201044386423

7823009,3,6302255848,"WEDLOCK which was filmed for TV way back in 1991, not filmed for Theatrical release at all
Great performance by Rutger Hauer of course
is now on dvd by Xenon pictures and in 2:35:1 widescreen format surprisingly because the Movie was filmed for 1:33:1 ratio only
but somehow Xenon was able to change the ratio to a very wide 2:35:1 ratio which i think is too wide
the film's ratio can easily be fixed to 1:78:1 or 1:85:1 ratio for sure
but instead Xenon pictures decided to stretch the ratio to 2:35:1
the picture quality is Digital remastered little bit so there's still lots of Grain & Dirt in the quality but much better than VHS quality
there's No extras at all no trailer no commentary by Director Lewis teague, just PLAY MOVIE or CHAPTER SELECTION that is it
between 2-3stars i gave this dvd reissue mainly cause it's in widescreen ratio instead of it's original TV ratio 1:33:1
and the picture quality is Good but not excellent",1488240000,,934,4.565476190476191
