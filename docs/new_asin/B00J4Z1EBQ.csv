8648189,5,B00J4Z1EBQ,"This important short film highlights the life and importance of cowboys of color in our past. Directed by Coy L. Poitier and Jacolby Percy, this is a much needed piece of missing American history.

About the talented director Mr. Poitier, when he isn't supervising his production company, or shooting a commercial video, or involved with music at church, or teaching a class on How to Produce a Short Film, you are likely to find him with this family, hanging out with their horses at the stables.  Thank you Mr. Poitier and Mr. Percy for creating this informative, interesting, and enjoyable film.",1442534400,,598,4.910891089108911
