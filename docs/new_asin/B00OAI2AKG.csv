8682986,3,B00OAI2AKG,"This is a sentimental blarney (1935) about an Irish widow and her three adult sons who still live with her! The film casts well known Irish actors of the time; James Cagney and Pat OBrien, who in real life were very good friends. Mary Gordon with her authentic Irish accent plays a quintessential mother. The story offered little surprise and no meaningful plot.

Work-shy Cagney feuds with his elder brother (OBrien) over the love of a girl (Olivia De Havilland). Cagney accepts the job of a fight promoter and then steps into the ring himself when his boxer is too drunk before a prize fight. He struggles during the fight but ultimately wins and wins the love of his brother and the girl. Earl Baldwin wrote the screenplay from the story of Frank Orsatti, and it was directed by Lloyd Bacon.",1460592000,,794,4.631205673758865

8682990,5,B00OAI2AKG,Comedy/drama.  I loved this movie.  It shows the relationships of a typical Irish family in the 1930s New York.  Storyline centers around the fallout of two of the three brothers (Cagney and O'Brien) who both fall for the same girl (Olivia De Havilland) and how they come back together again as a family at the end (thanks mostly to their mother).  Lots of humor (courtesy of McHugh) and a very enjoyable movie.  Highly recommend it.,1427932800,3,433,4.72
