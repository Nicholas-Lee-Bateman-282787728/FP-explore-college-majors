2247809,5,B0007XBKVI,Excellant material for those young people who want to learn more about Canada and the Depression Era.  A lot of human feelings shared throughout the series.,1176249600,4,156,5.0
2247810,5,B0007XBKVI,"Wind At My Back originally began airing on Canadian TV about 10 years ago.  I first saw the series when I was living in Buffalo while an undergrad at the University there (as I could get both US and Canadian TV)...  When I heard the show was created by the same team that brought Anne of Green Gables to the small screen, I figured it could not be *too* bad, so I gave it a try...

To cut to the chase, it definately wasn't ""too bad"" at all... In fact, it was absolutely brilliant!  I soon found myself pushing aside all my US (and Canadian) favorites, making sure I watched every episode week in, week out.

The show takes place during the Depression in Canada in the early 1900s...  The Bailey family happily runs a convenience store in a small town, but soon gets swept into the hard-times others are suffering around them, and has to make do after a series of tragic events occur.

Due to these events, the family heads to the mining town of New Bedford, where they meet up with the town's matriarch -- May Bailey.  May is a subborn, hard woman who has never even met her grand-children, and was against her estranged son marrying Honey (the family's mother).  Now the family must depend on May for its daily survival or starve to death (and May, not being the forgiving type does not make it easy).

The show can run the emotional gammot from tear-jerker to hilarious to heartwarming-inspirational.  It is that brilliant range mixed in with brutal realism that makes it such a pleasure to watch.

Also making the show a pleasure to watch is the fabulous overall cast.  Every one of the characters is well-developed, and superbly acted.  The standount of the show is definitely Shirley Douglass as May Bailey though.  Every scene she is in is absolute magic, going from the heartless grandother and business person one minute, to a person with real feelings and pain the next...  Great stuff all-around.

Needless to say, I think Wind At My Back is a must watch series, and one of the best ever created.  If you or your kids like to watch well-acted realistic family dramas which don't hold anything back, then this series is for you.",1128211200,88,2138,4.537859007832898
2247811,5,B0007XBKVI,This is one of those programs that you wish would never (have) end(ed).  Full of life!,1123113600,22,86,4.375
2247812,4,B0007XBKVI,Love this entire series but wish it was more affordable. Will have to purchase one season at a time due to cost.,1420329600,,112,4.136363636363637
2247813,2,B0007XBKVI,I see that most people here say this is a family show. We watched the first episode and found there were many profanities. This sure isn't like Little House on the Prairie.,1416873600,,172,4.40625

2247817,5,B0007XBKVI,"This is the story of the Bailey family's struggles during the Great Depression.  When their hardware store fails and the bank auctions off their belongings, Honey and her husband Jack are forced to ask Jack's mother, Maeve, for help.  Maeve is the owner of the Bailey silver mine in New Bedford, Canada.  She takes in the family, but Jack dies when a bee sting causes a severe allergic reaction.  Maeve has plans for the couple's two boys, Hubert and Henry, nicknamed Hub and Fat, but has no use for the baby girl, Violet, whom she sends to live with distant relatives.  She sends away the boy's mother, Honey.  Honey struggles to find a job in desperate times and to keep her scattered family together.",1408406400,,703,4.629032258064516
2247818,5,B0007XBKVI,Looking forward to ordering Season two.  It is so nice to watch something entertaining and not the junk they show on reality shows.,1406678400,,131,4.695652173913044
2247819,5,B0007XBKVI,"If you like family-oriented films, you will love this series.  It is extremely well done.  The actors in every part are well-suited for what they portray.  We had initially seen it on TV, so had to get the series, and we begin watching it just as soon as it arrives.",1388275200,,266,4.28
2247820,5,B0007XBKVI,I caught this series on BYU but unfortunately started watching it during the middle of the first season.  I was happy to see how it all began.,1377648000,,142,4.2592592592592595
2247821,2,B0007XBKVI,"Certainly, this series is great for family values. But the acting, at least in episode 1, was very bad. And frankly, I did not like the writing. The story line was too contrived and cliche - script seemed like what a freshman in high school would dream up to complete a writing assignment the night before it was due. I don't mind cliche (like MacGyver) but I watch it for humor, not so much drama. Just the wrong mix for me - I found it difficult to even sit through the first episode. Yeah, yeah, yeah ""would you rather watch the trash they show now-a-days?"" and my answer is ""No"". I like family value shows and I like the classics. I never heard of this show until yesterday, thus it could not be the smash hit that many make it out to be. But if you like, watch it - there is plenty worse you could tune in to with your family. Actually, virtually anything made in the current era is worse.",1375747200,,894,4.203488372093023
2247822,5,B0007XBKVI,"I AM VERY PLEASED WITH MY SELECTION.CAN'T WAIT TO PURCHASE MORE. ONE OF THE BEST SHOWS ON TV. THIIT.S SHOW IS NOT ON TV IN ATLANTA, GA. AND I WAS MISSING",1368489600,,153,3.967741935483871

2247824,5,B0007XBKVI,This is the best series I have ever seen.  The setting for the 1930's is perfect; not one detail was overlooked.  I am so glad you have these at an affordable price!!,1366934400,,166,4.15625
2247825,5,B0007XBKVI,I loved the first season and am planning on purchasing all of the series.  This would probably be more appreciated by the 30-80 year olds.,1365897600,,138,4.52
2247826,4,B0007XBKVI,"We love the era, the story line of a depression family coping, and the setting views (beautiful/nostalgic scenes). However, we found the script/dialogue too simplistic or unreal and the acting effort too obvious in some of the scenes. I would buy it again because I liked ""The Waltons""  TV series and other stories I have seen of that era. I am buying all of the series because I still want to see how the characters progress even though the dialogue and acting fails to completely convince me at times.",1358208000,,503,4.651685393258427
2247827,5,B0007XBKVI,"This television show is so refreshing if you are looking for something to watch as a family. It is appropriate for all ages, and the issues that the characters in this family as well as small town suffering during the depression deal with are engaging and suspenseful. Will Honey get to return to her family? Will the boys find acceptance in their new home with their grandmother? Out of all the characters, Grace is my favorite. She has lived with her mother all her life, but she dreams of living an exciting life of her own - though when that will happen, nobody knows but the powers that be! Very good television. The DVD set itself is beautiful and not so bulky that it won't fit nicely on a media shelf. Highly recommended!",1357862400,2,729,4.488721804511278
2247828,5,B0007XBKVI,My husband and I enjoyed this series.  It was refreshing and kept us wanting more.  We rooted for the good guys and found ourselves hoping the bad would lose.,1357516800,,158,4.413793103448276

I enjoy ""period"" dramas or drama-comedies about ""real life."" This series is in that genre, and has some good qualities. However,I wish the acting was better. Perhaps it's that way in part due to the script and the directing.
Also, because it is portraying most of the characters as ""Christians,"" it would be refreshing to see some of them have a more personal relationship with God, such as relying on Him in need, realizing they need to be forgiving to others (because Christ has forgiven us), and being thankful to Him.",1343260800,2,721,6.078431372549019
2247830,5,B0007XBKVI,"This series takes place during the Canadian Depression. The matriarch of the family is someone you love to hate! The story is sad, happy, very poignant. You'll look forward to each episode.",1337558400,,189,4.9375
2247831,5,B0007XBKVI,Just discovered this series a few months ago. What a treasure! Especially since there is nothing being made like this today. If you want wonderful wholesome programs for your family - this is it.,1333411200,,195,4.764705882352941
2247836,3,B0007XBKVI,I purchased this DVD for my family to enjoy watching together and I do find it to be appropriate for us all and entertaing without being inappropriately provokative. The reason for my selecting this particular series was that it was produced by the the same producer of Anne Of Green Gables which I absolutely LOVED!!! I did not find that it lived up to that expectation but my family and I are coming to enjoy it. The very first episode was a lot to digest in that there were a lot of hardships all compounded in the very first one!,1326758400,,533,4.34
2247837,5,B0007XBKVI,"Wind at my Back is a wonderful ""experience""!  This is a series that keeps  you so interested you can't wait for the next episode.  You live and breathe with all the wonderful characters in the series.  The characters portrayed are done by wonderful actors/actresses....just made for the part they are playing.  Definitely at 5-star rating in my book!",1314662400,4,350,4.9655172413793105
2247838,5,B0007XBKVI,Wind at my Back is a wonderful wholesome entertainment wonderfully done with great acting. It is a must see. So much better than most of the other junk which is on TV these days.,1289520000,3,178,4.264705882352941
2247839,5,B0007XBKVI,This is a wonderful series about small-town life in the 30s.  Full of family love and situations to be dealt with.  The shipping on this was fantastic...super quick.,1288310400,4,165,4.857142857142857
2247840,5,B0007XBKVI,"We love this story.  .  It is funny, heartwarming, homey, and portrays a gentler time.  I will definitely be buying other seasons.",1284681600,2,130,4.818181818181818
2247841,5,B0007XBKVI,"First saw this series on BYU TV (374) Dircet TV.  Fell in love each viewing!  It's better than Little House! The set is so realistic; clothes, hair, towns, characters that make it almost real in depicting the hardships of the depression era and the characters were pefect in every way.  I've purchased all 5 years + the Christmas Special DVD.  Sad to see it end.  Loved every single episode.  Good, clean viewing.  Too bad we can't have things like that on TV today.  Producers listen up:  Take us back and away from the trash being shown today.",1280793600,32,545,4.536082474226804
2247842,5,B0007XBKVI,"My family are picky about movies, my children are ages 15-20 and it is becoming hard to find something that pleases all of us and not embarrass us while watching as a family. we saw Anne of Green Gables and Road to Avonlea and we were trying to find nice series. Thank the Lord we were able to find this to watch together with the children. we are enjoying them and I got all seasons.",1280793600,6,384,4.133333333333334
2247843,3,B0007XBKVI,$78 dollars for just one season?!!!?  Get serious. I loved this on tv but this price is totally unrealistic.  For anything over $20 for any one season you can KEEP THEM!!  and that would be for top-notch picture quality.,1280016000,5,220,4.589743589743589
2247844,5,B0007XBKVI,"This is a timeless series for the whole family.  I watched this after my kids grew up and moved out, and I loved it.  I ordered it for my sister as a gift and she went bonkers over it also.  I love the time period this is set in.  Wonderful!",1278547200,3,241,3.76
2247845,4,B0007XBKVI,"I remembered watching the first couple of seasons of this show when I was a kid so I picked up the first season on DVD for a trip down memory lane.

The episodes are pretty much presented as they appeared on TV (which is a good thing)there are no unneeded edits or additions so everything is as it should be.

On the whole everything about this show is really good with well written stories  well developed characters and some great acting, its very wholesome family entertainment that is great for the whole family (from little kids to seniors), there are few if any obscene words used in the scripts (and if there are they are very mild) which can sometimes lead to some unintentionally funny dialog because its obvious that words phrases and sometimes entire sentances were edited or changed to get the G rating and there is no gratuitous nudity or sexual situations/talk either.

The main relationships that are focused on in this season are the relationships between the young Bailey brothers and various members of their extended family and members of the community,  the relationship between the brothers is one of reluctant (but devoted) love and affection from the older son towards his little brother who seems to look up to him in an almost hero worshiping way they are both devoted to their mother who adores them and loves them more than anything while having a strained relationship with the grandmother whom they previously hadn't met.

My only complaints are the way the discs are structured and the distinct lack of any real special features.

Each disc is a dual-disc with a couple of episodes a side so be careful when handling these discs because they scratch very easily (they could have put everything onto two high density discs instead of using the lower density dual-disc system which is cheaper to produce and having the set end up as a four disc set) and the first episode is at the beginning of disc one instead of being on a disc with the rest of the episodes so you have to switch discs after watching the first part of the two part first episode, the other more sensible option would have been to just edit the two episodes together into a single two hour premier special (like how it was originally broadcast in the first place) .

The first disc also contains the ""special features"" which consists of a three minute TV teaser that aired just before the first episode was broadcast and a series credits screen (why even have this feature because each episode has a credits screen at the end so the series credits screen serves no real purpose at all) there are no cast interviews bloopers deleted scenes or any kind of stuff like that unless you count the shows audio track being available in english and dubbed (sometimes badly) french (which is a given because it was a Canadian produced show and we are a bi-lingual country) and the closed captioning that doesn't seem to work on my dvd player is a major stretch in the definition of what special features are and for an eighty dollar set this is unacceptable, those kind of lazy special features are what you'd expect to see from a twenty dollar special value DVD set at wal-mart not something that is this expensive.

Other than those small complaints I have to say this is a great show to have on dvd even if the ""special features"" are lacking.",1250553600,13,3332,4.633898305084746
