2614047,3,B000GIXCLK,"Ammando De Ossorio's Blind Dead Quadrilogy has had a cult like appreciation for a number of years thanks to spotty availability and a series of striking, haunting images that Ossorio had no qualms about reusing... Over and over again. While each of the Blind Dead films is distinctive in one way or another, they're all tightly bound by the undead Templar Knights that terrorize villages, sea-farmers and tourists alike. And while the first film, ""Tombs of the Blind Dead"", has the greatest reputation, I feel that second film, ""Return of the Evil Dead"", is superior entertainment.

The second chapter of the series is more of a ""Night of the Living Dead"" clone with a group of people getting ensconced in a small area with seemingly no way to escape and impending doom knocking at the door. Certainly, RotED doesn't live up the the Romero classic, but moves briskly through the motions, features a number of violent set pieces and, at times, recaptures the haunting atmosphere of its predecessor. And that doesn't take into account the gleefully sleazy bits like the mayor tricking a child into becoming live bait for an escape AFTER he already sent the child's father to a similar fate.

While not my favorite of the series (that would be the fourth and final film), the second film rectifies some of the errors made by the original and manages to be a more entertaining if less individualistic piece of film. Do yourself a favor and watch the whole series this Halloween.",1408752000,4,1474,4.822134387351778
2614048,5,B000GIXCLK,"This is the fastest-paced, most violent and goriest of the Blind Dead series. Taking place in a small town during a festival, the Templars awaken and begin a killing-spree through the town. After killing a bunch of the townsfolk, they force a small group to take refuge in a single building. There's some topless nudity, and the body count in this one is high. The atmosphere, suspense, music and scenery is also very good; although many might not find it as scary as the other Blind Dead films. While it doesn't feel as claustrophobic as NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD when they take refuge in the building with the Templars waiting for them outside in the dark, the film may still be of interest to fans of that film. The directing is really good, and the film is likely to appeal to an even larger audience than the rest of the Blind Dead films because of the increase in violence, action, and gore. There's good amount of gore in the movie with some scenes being quite nasty, but it isn't all gore from beginning to end. It's an excellent easy to follow film to watch at night, or for those who need to get anything remotely resembling NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD.

The quality is excellent. The best version by far on the disc is the original uncut Spanish version with English subtitles.",1390780800,4,1284,4.510729613733906
2614049,4,B000GIXCLK,"Apparently Peter Jackson saw this wonderful Spanish horror film prior to filming the Lord of the Rings films. Revenge of the Evil Dead is the second installment in the ""Blind Dead"" Quadrilogy, helmed by low-budget Spanish Horror director/visionary Amando De Ossorio. The reason I am reviewing the second in the series and not the first film Tombs of the Blind Dead is simply because this is a stronger film in terms of story and pacing.

Tombs of the Blind Dead was so successful that De Ossorio continued the story of the ""Blind Dead"" with Revenge of the Evil Dead as a follow up. Revenge starts of with recycled footage from the first film telling the story of the Cult of Templar Knights and their quest from immortality by sacrificing and drinking the blood of a virgin woman. The towns people round up the Knights and burn out their eyes, ""so they may never find the town again"" and then incinerate them. Centuries later, the Knights are free and bring their revenge back on the same town, on a celebratory night, remembering the Templar Knights deaths. Then the film borrows tricks from Night of the Living Dead only with more betrayal amongst the cast of characters who are cornered in a locked church hiding from the evil knights.

In the Lord of the Rings films, the Nazgul or the Ring Wraiths that obsessively hunted Frodo for the ring, looked so much like the Blind Dead Knights in Ossorio's films that the similarity is obvious. Even down to the weakness of both Nazgul and the Blind Dead Knights when concerning being scared of torches or being attacked by fire.

Revenge of the Evil Dead is not a technically brilliant film in terms of cinematography or editing but it is worthy to make mention that great idea with sub-standard execution can influence a multi million dollar film franchise.",1362787200,3,1805,4.723809523809524
2614050,4,B000GIXCLK,"Unlike its slow moody predecessor, ""Return of the Blind Dead"" aka ""Return of the Evil Dead"" is all about non-stop action and mounting suspense.  Despite once again working with a very limited budget, writer/director Ossorio gets good milage out of the cool Spanish locations and stages some impressive mayhem as his iconic Templers crash a fiesta with swords swinging.  Utilizing more B-level gore, the undead knights feely slice and dice their innocent victims with blood and severed limbs flying. There's even a cool car vs. horse chase sequence through narrow atmospheric streets and a couple cheesy fist fights for the hell of it.

After the wild first act, the script settles into a ""Night of the Living Dead"" scenario with a small group of survivors held up in a besieged old church.  Despite being simple caricatures the colorful characters are surprisingly effective, especially the sleazy overweight mayor as he manipulates and uses others without remorse; a far cry from the boring non-characters of the original film. The unique ""blind dead"" gimmick is also much better exploited this time out as villagers frequently attempt to sneak past these cloaked menaces in sequences of almost unbearable suspense.  Surprisingly, Ossorio even smoothly weaves some rather amusing dark humor into the script.  And just in case this sounds to classy for you, plenty of attractive women have their shirts ripped off for no other reason than to expose their breasts before their gory death.

2614051,3,B000GIXCLK,"The '72 release `Return of the Blind Dead' is writer/director Amando de Ossorio's second installment in the ""Blind Dead"" series. While many consider this to be an improvement on the first film, I personally think the first was the superior of the two. While the overall scope of the second is larger I find the mood and atmosphere of the first to be more compelling and evocative. Maybe it's just a case of what's done the first time is done the best. Anyway, for those of you who like the unnerving moaning and slow-motion specters here they come again!",1199059200,,554,4.606060606060606
2614052,3,B000GIXCLK,"The Return of the Evil Dead is the second installment of Amando de Ossario's Blind Dead series. This film is more formulaic than the original Tombs of the Blind Dead. Ossario owes a tip of the hat to George Romero on this on in that it follows the plot of Night of the Dead almost to the point of being the same film moved to a Spanish locale.

None of this makes it any less a classic of the EuroHorror genre. The blind knights are back on the 500th anniversary of their execution to wreak havoc on the village of Bouzano. The casting is a little better, the plotting a little tighter and the story a little more predictable. But the reason that you've gotten this far is that you are a fan of Ossario or his creation. The best part of the film is that the horsemen get more screentime in this outing (truth be told perhaps too much screentime). The makeup and costume effects for the early 1970's are not to be missed.

Blue Underground has done the best they could with the flawed source material. There was a distinct hum on the mono audio of the Spanish version of the film. The Spanish version is presented in its full 91 minute running time. If you are more inclined also included is the slightly shorter 87 minute American version. It is my understanding that some of the more gratuitous violence was removed from the opening sequences and some of the tame by today's standards nudity was also excised.

The disc contains the original trailers in both English and Spanish and a stills gallery.

Bottom line: this is one for the fans. While it may be the strongest film in the series it lacks a little of the originality of the original. Well worth a rental but purchase only if you are a true fan.",1184371200,,1705,4.386075949367089
2614053,5,B000GIXCLK,"In this second startling film in the BLIND DEAD series, writer/director Amando de Ossorio returns to the horrific origin of the depraved Templar: heretic knights whose eyes were burned out by medieval vigilantes to prevent them from finding their way back from Hell. Now on the 500th anniversary of their execution, the blind horsemen rise from their tombs to wreak bloody revenge on the town that condemned them. Tony Kendall (When The Screaming Stops), Frank Brana (Pieces) and Lone Fleming (Tombs of the Blind Dead) star in this chilling sequel that rocked the EuroHorror genre.",1159401600,5,581,5.126315789473685

2614055,3,B000GIXCLK,If someone re-edited all the Blind Dead movies and cut them in half they'd be great. Creepy and cool but way too slow.,1456012800,,118,4.173913043478261
2614056,3,B000GIXCLK,"Subpar laughable 70's horror flick which should generate an hour of joy to an hour of sheer boredom.

Plot: Totally nonsensical and utterly ridiculous. A group of Holy Crusader Knights Templar engage in a Satanic witch ritual, for reasons that are never explained nor make one ounce of sense, where a hot local village babe is slightly stripped and hacked in order to drink her blood (are they trying to become vampires???) Why on Earth would Christian Knights sworn to defend Europeans just out of the blue decide to become unholy witches?

  The Portuguese medieval village people get mad, so they storm the castle where they burn and blind the Templar Knights, including murdering some of their rank and file.  For no reason at all 800 years later a Spanish border town has a festival where these Knights, now skeleton warriors exactly identical to Tolken's / Peter Jackson's ""Lord of the rings"" - ""Hobbit"" franchise characters come back to life to hunt down and kill all of the people in the town (what is their end game? we have zero clue other then they want to attack).

A few nice looking ladies and macho horny boyfriend guys try to defend themselves, the town, and a little girl who are all targeted by these horseback and sword wielding thugs.  At any point anyone with two functioning legs, a set of lungs, and a little fire in their belly could easily out maneuver and run away from these slow moving preposterous Skeleton Monsters that the entire movie becomes so absurd it's laughable.

These creatures are slow, they are dumb, and they are not threatening at all unless you are a tortious at an elderly home and thus this is why this movie really just doesn't come together fully.  For an action-adventure science fiction fantasy horror flick to work, the bad guys have to be believable and the good guys cannot be these helpless tree stumps.  We have silly gory shots where people get chopped up, along with a few tit scenes thrown in here and there, but over all this film is pretty much a dud through and through.

Teens could watch this movie to get a laugh at terrible special effects, and adults could watch it for even harder laughs, but other then that it has little to offer.

 I guess if anything this film was a victim of it's time, when special effects just were not that great and thus the acting and plot had to make a horror action movie believable alone (just watch the classic Hammer films to see an example of that).  A grade of a C.",1447459200,2,2467,4.577272727272727

8132807,2,B000GIXCLK,"I normally don't mind watching some of these old school zombie flicks...  That said, this one literally had a complete cast of people with IQs lower than that of a hamster...  I expect some silliness in these, but this was just off the charts.  I honestly can't remember a single decision anyone made in the entire movie that made any sense  ( I mean, these are worse than decisions like ""I just found my boyfriend murdered...  I'm going to get naked and take a shower..."" )...  maybe there were some issues in the dub job ( it's possible ), but I can't imagine the difference would be ""that"" drastic...

I will say that the zombie makeup looked surprisingly good for an early 70's flick...  but that is literally about the only good thing this movie has going for it...  plot, acting, camera work, rest of the special effects, etc...  all complete garbage...",1523664000,,859,4.592105263157895

8132810,1,B000GIXCLK,"This is clearly an homage or some would say even a ripoff of a certain other film, while there are some definite similarities, it's also vastly different especially in quality. A small town is having a celebration on the anniversary of when the templars were blinded, and executed for human sacrifices. Well obviously the knights are going to rise again, but since they're blind they shouldn't be much of a threat, yet some how people keep getting killed! This town is also home to the most lackadaisical mayor I've ever seen, and also apparently quite a few rapists. At least the blind dead are courteous enough to knock on the door before ripping some throats out.
  This is my first foray into the blind dead series, and I've seen that this is one of the best, God help me if that's true. There's some comedy sprinkled in here and there, but the horrible FX are actually the funniest part of the entire thing. The skeleton knights, the swords that don't actually cut anything, the hilarious dubbed fight scenes. The acting actually starts off quite well, but by the time they get stuck in the chapel it degenerated greatly. One of the men even tries to get his rape on while facing certain death, that's just bad placement. The knights also are apparently sympathetic to children, because one walks right through a crowd of them calling for her parents, and they ignore her completely. This is just a mess, there's no other way to describe a film like this, I'll give it an extra star for the unintentional comedy.",1506470400,,1517,4.656716417910448
8132811,3,B000GIXCLK,"Return of the Evil Dead (1973) is the second installment in the Blind Dead films. The Templar knights rise from their tombs and terrorize a village during it's centennial celebration. I've always  watched the Spanish version. Like the other films in this series the Blind Dead look pretty cool, especially when on horseback.

I'd mildly recommend this DVD, or any of the other 3 Blind Dead films. This series has some charm that draws me to revisit it every few years

Product review:
Blue Underground DVD contains both the English version (87 mins) and the uncensored Spanish version (91 mins). The picture and audio quality are both fine.  The dark scenes can be kind of tough to make out. The only special features are Theatrical trailers and a still image gallery.",1504828800,,768,4.8396946564885495
8132812,4,B000GIXCLK,"RETURN OF THE EVIL DEAD (1973) begins w/ a similar human-sacrifice-through-vampirism scene, as in TOMBS OF THE BLIND DEAD. This time, the Knights Templar's executions are shown in full, gruesome detail. Fast-forward to the modern day, and a small village is celebrating its centennial. Putting on the big show for the event, is Jack Marlowe (Tony Kendall). Marlowe is told by the local oddball, that on this very night, the Knights will rise from their graves, and wreak havoc upon the living! Of course, Jack considers this idea to be pure banana oil, and goes about his business, as does the rest of the town. Unbeknownst to any of them, the Knights indeed do arise, in typically slllowww fashion, seeking victims for their revenge! As part of the village festivities, the ""knights"" are burned in effigy. Bad idea! Mounting their ghostly steeds, the real Knights make their move. This movie wastes no time w/ any real plot, and gets right to the good stuff! Within a few minutes, these nightmare riders are taking down their prey. When they finally crash the town's party, its a grisly delight! Will anyone live till dawn? Watching this, I can't help wondering just how much of an influence it was on John Carpenter's THE FOG, w/ its similar theme and atmosphere of dread. This is the sequel to TOMBS OF THE BLIND DEAD...",1499126400,2,1323,4.781659388646288
