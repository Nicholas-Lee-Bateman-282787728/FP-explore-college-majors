1338919,4,B00004CJ64,"The supplier of this collection send an email asking if we understood that the dvd's were Region 2 (Europe) and PAL, which we did. They arrived very quickly. So supplier gets good ratings.

For those in N. America, the DVD region codes are a royal pain inflicted by smart-ass lawyers and Hollywood types. This is NOT a complaint about paying for something. It is a complaint about greed -- asking someone to pay a second time to read/see something they can read/see somewhere else. Perhaps they should region-code bibles so most can only be read in Georgia when the month doesn't have an R in it.

The work-around for us was to use the medibuntu repository for Ubuntu linux, the handbrake software from the Stebbins repository and the VLC media player. Worked fine, but a bit of work to manipulate the files to a usable form. And all we wanted to do was watch the old films that are not available in NTSC or region 1 format. Sigh.

And don't ask for copies -- we are NOT going to offer for download.",1327449600,2,999,4.478021978021978
1338920,5,B00004CJ64,"I've been waiting for this film to get re offered as I remembered it as a very funny fim.  Alastair Sim is tremendous--and Jack Cole,quite good.  the action keeps moving.  One of the funniest bits is the trio of ladies playingminstruments in the bar.  typical english characters.",1318550400,4,279,4.872340425531915
1338921,4,B00004CJ64,"I have many of the movies that had Alistair Sim as a star - and had been searching for this title for years.  I originally saw his films in the 60's while at the University of Minnesota, through the multiple film clubs in the metro area.  He adds a quality of character to his films that really makes them great as a whole - even as a detective in one of them.  His reactions to plans messed up is one of the ways he makes the films wonderful.  The team of actors with him in this film greatly increase the humor.",1267920000,5,513,4.0495049504950495
1338922,2,B00004CJ64,"This has always been a favorite film of mine. I have hundreds of DVD, and only this one gets lost in my player. I have to eject it several times to get it out. I could have returned it, but realized it too late. Is it a cheap bootleg?",1251849600,,234,3.795918367346939
1338923,4,B00004CJ64,"In my view Alistair Sim was the finest comedy actor British cinema ever produced and his considerable talents are given full rein in this literate and witty  comedy .He plays Hawkins a professional hit man  who is persuaded out of retirement for one last job -the killing of a pompous politician Sir Gregory Upshoot(Raymond Huntley).The chosen venue is The Green Man ,a somewhat seedy and slightly rundown seaside resort hotel ,where Upshoot is planning on spending an illicit weekend with his latest mistress. The proposed method is a radio operated bomb designed to explode when Upshoot arrives .To this end Hawkins disguises himself as a clockmaker of meek and timid disposition and ingratiates himself with the hotels' permanent and temporsry residents ,taking tea with the dowager ladies and enetring into the cultural life of the hotel with its ""Palm Court ""style musical diversions .But will Upshhot  ever arrive  ?And what will happen to the bomb if the ladies will not cease their musical recital as this may effect the timing of any detonation?

Their are some very amusing flasback scenes in which we see earlier assassinations carried out by Hawkins and Sim us especially good in these but his performance nver really falters as his lugubrious countenace registers ever nuance of carefully controlled irritation he feels as his plans seem fated to be obstructed .Huntley excelled in the type of role he plays here-the pompous windbag with masses of self-importance and self -regard .George Cole is OK as a bumbling vacuum cleaner salesman and the whole thing is a bright and diverting comedy ,which also provides a nice cameo for the estimable Terry Thomas",1200528000,,1668,5.072992700729927
1338924,5,B00004CJ64,"I agree with the previous two reviews.  I wish merely to emphasize the excellent performance of George Cole, whom I first encountered as Flash Harry the go-between (NOT middle-man, as he correctly insisted) in ""the Belles of St Trinian's.  To this day, I cannot think of him without hearing the barrel organ playing Flash Harry's theme.  He was never a star, but he, like Tony Randall in American films, was one of the few truly great second bananas.

In this film he is the little guy, an utterly insignificant vacuum cleaner salesman who almost unwittingly confounds and frustrates the suave (and quite charming) assassin played by Sim.  His pitch for his machine is an unforgettable classic.  ""The ordinary cleaner sweeps as it cleans,"" he tells his hapless victims.  ""The superior cleaner beats as it sweeps as it cleans.""  But his cleaner, he boasts ""DISINFECTS as it beats as it sweeps as it cleans!""",1193443200,,906,4.875816993464053
1338925,5,B00004CJ64,"First things first: It should be noted that this film is clearly identified at the top of the Amazon listing as the version starring Alastair Sim and George Cole.  It should be further noted that eight of the nine following reviews refer to an unmemorable potboiler called ""The Green Man,"" a tepid horror flick that featured Albert Finney, made many years later.

The one review that actually relates to the film at hand is the fine piece by Mr. DeRiemer.  I find myself in agreement with Mr. DeRiemer in all things save his assigned rating.  He gives ""The Green Man"" four stars.  I fully concur with him that there are small flaws, but overall the ""Green Man"" is so much better than the average run of things--then and certainly now--that I think the full five stars to be the most appropriate rating.",1172188800,8,802,4.619718309859155
1338926,5,B00004CJ64,"Watch this film and you are immediately one up!!  Unlike poor Palfrey played by the wonderfully unassuming Ian Carmichael.  If you are feeling down and want a story with a happy ending, thats romantic without being too sloppy, funny without being crudely slapstick and innocent but with a gleam in its eye, then this is the film for you. As ever the performances of Alastair Simm, Terry Thomas, Carmichael and the rest of the cast end up overshadowing the never-the-less delightful plot.  Actors of this calibre from this period always seem not to be acting if you know what I mean. This gives the viewer such empathy with their plight that one becomes engrossed totally, squirming with Palfreys plight and chuckling at the Professors ploys and cheering when the baddy gets his and Palfrey gets the beautiful April.

Please watch this fim but try not to take the wrong message from it! Remember that finally Palfrey has to open his heart to get the girl.  Enjoy.",1135382400,6,962,4.771084337349397
7919736,4,B00004CJ64,"Plot: Alastair Sim is the mild mannered killer for hire who's bomb making goes wrong when salesman George Cole shows up.

Alastair Sims is hysterical as the clock maker turned bomb maker who is plans to blow up a boring public official. His past exploits have been smooth and successful. He becomes ""engaged"" to the public officials homely secretary to get the inside info on the target. When the fiancee shows up at his home she is killed and stuff into a piano. When George Cole the vacuum salesman shows up to make his first sale he stumbles across the body in the piano. Lovely Jill Adams is also drug into the plot as the new neighbor when Cole goes to the wrong house. With nothing going right Sims and his flunky side kick set off to plant the bomb. With Cole and Adams on their tail they end up at the Green Man a low end hotel where all continues to go wrong. This has a very funny plot and and Sim is always hysterical as he has to try extra hard to get rid of the bomb and his intended target. Terry Thomas shows up as a cheating spouse who is taken for the wrong man. I give this one 4 stars for all clever plot, George Cole holds his own as the bumbling salesman and lovely Jill Adams is along for the ride.",1503878400,,1220,4.169491525423729

7919738,5,B00004CJ64,"I bought this film because Alistair Sim is one of my favorite actors. Unfortunately, I did not know that region 2 would not play with my existing set-up. great plot, and acting",1411776000,,176,4.53125
7919739,5,B00004CJ64,Only problem is that I cannot find the DVD in region 1 format. Can you help me with this. thanks.,1381795200,,97,3.9
7919740,3,B00004CJ64,"A bit too frenetic and slapstick.
Not as good as some other Alistair Sim and Terry Thomas movies such as ""School for Scoundrels"".",1365984000,,129,4.6521739130434785
7919741,5,B00004CJ64,"Alastair Sim!!!  A genius!!!  It's difficult to realize that he had a career long before ""Scrooge"", but he did!!  One of the best of his previous films is ""Green for Danger""; wish they had turned that into a series of films!!!  He was excellent as the inspector!!!

Anyway, these are quite enjoyable!!  They are for a ""universal"" DVD, not for American players.  Know that before buying!!  However, today it is just so much easier owning a universal player, which means you can play ANY DVD; why would you want to own an American DVD player which limits what you can buy & watch??  And, they're not that expensive!!  Look on Amazon and judge for yourself!!  Buy one!!  Then buy this set of DVD's!!!  You'll love them!!",1363737600,4,717,4.595238095238095
7919742,4,B00004CJ64,Film version is an old-fashioned British farce (based on a play) with an outstanding performance by Alistar Sim and an enthusiastic supporting cast.,1362355200,,148,5.478260869565218
7919743,4,B00004CJ64,its a bit slow but the first 5 minutes is very funny.  terry thomas and the ladies trio are scream,1361232000,,98,3.9
7919744,5,B00004CJ64,"The Green Man is a 50's British comedy and it still makes me laugh.  Obviously dated but there is a charm in that too, especially if you were alive in the fifties as I was.  I was surprised to discover that the lead (George Cole) is still acting and going strong on British TV. The story is the usual: paid killer versus innocent vacuum cleaner salesman and beautiful blond whose fiancee works for the BBC.  There's a body that keeps moving from place to place and the characters at the hotel are poster material for AA. The sexual situations will probably be over the heads of young children (nothing graphic). A fun movie to watch.",1333324800,3,633,4.48695652173913
7919745,5,B00004CJ64,"The movie is a classic English situation comedy with no weak points and non-stop delight from the beginning. It features the incomparable Alistair Sim, who may be best known for his 1951 portrayal of Scrooge, but who starred in a number of English comedies. The film is immune to being dated, and is a delight. The disc was in mint condition, and arrived promptly.",1330992000,3,364,4.703125
