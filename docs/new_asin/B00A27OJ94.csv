5375051,5,B00A27OJ94,Jason Isaacs is obviously a huge draw to anything but what I truly like about this series is that it is wonderfully quiet storytelling. There is enough in the story and characters that it has no need for a lot of car chases and explosions and gunfights and all of that nonsense.  Not that there is not a place for that and I am even a huge fan of many movies and films of that ilk but it is so nice to be able to enjoy a piece of modern fiction that harkens back to the golden years of film when they didn't feel the need to distract the audience constantly.  If you like this series you will also enjoy the Jesse Stone films with Tom Selleck and probably the Flashpoint series with Enrico Colantoni which has a little more action but is focused more on story and saving people rather than gunning them down.,1396483200,13,808,4.2064516129032254
5375052,4,B00A27OJ94,"I enjoyed&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Case-Histories/dp/B005K8QIS0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Case Histories</a>&nbsp;Series One.  Series Two brings us more of Edinburgh based private investigator, Jackson Brodie, and his indomitable spirit.  I think in a way, he can sometimes be too good for his own good.  He constantly puts the welfare of others before his own.  This, in my opinion, makes him a man of decent character with a sound moral compass.  (Just the way I like ""good guys"" to be.) The people who seek him out certainly benefit from his caring and compassionate nature even if his business does not.  As a private investigator, doing things out of the goodness of his heart doesn't pay the bills, as Deborah Arnold, his lovely and sassy ""secretary?"" so often reminds (nags) him.  Her threats of walking out unless he takes on clients with money influences him about as much as the power company turning off his lights.  Not so much.

Brodie's penchant for taking on cases of those with troubles that he understands and relates to gets him in a lot of trouble.  He's also a sucker for the weak, helpless, abandoned, forgotten, and lost.  People turn to him when they have nowhere else to go.  And invariably, he helps them.  Successfully.

He is not afraid to wade into the middle of things even if that means he'll wake up in a dumpster, beaten to a pulp. I told him, ""Run, Jackson, run!"" But not Jackson, he won't turn and run, it's just not in him. And somehow, once he heals, he ends up keeping his handsome looks.  Must be good genes.  I think though that he just cannot compromise his values to make a buck or even save his skin.  It's just not an option.  Even when he tries to walk away because he knows the case can only swing the wrong way, his better nature keeps him in the fight.  He's exactly the sort I'd be seeking if I needed help.

His childhood is still a flashback thread in the plot.  The sadness of his youth has shaped him and his memories haunt him.

Jackson Brodie is played masterfully by Jason Isaacs.  He's perfectly cast.  The first time I saw him was in Harry Potter Chamber of Secrets as Lucius Malfoy and he was fabulous.  He remains fabulous.

There are three episodes.  All contain excellent stories involving twisty plots, intrigue, and interesting characters.  All actors are top-notch. Brodie becomes embroiled in some nasty cases and doesn't come out unscathed both physically and emotionally.  Due to being misled about a touchy child custody case he ends up owing the wrong person a favor and it's called in. He risks his license to help a former cop in a delicate situation to find a new identity.  His precocious daughter, Marlee, drops the bomb that her mum has given her permission to live with him. And she moves in.  In finding the biological parents of a young woman, he unearths some darkly disturbing skeletons in her gene pool.  Louise Munroe has some kind of pull on him even though he walks away from her and she marries another, yet, it is clear that she still carries a torch for him.  She reluctantly continues to help him in her capacity as a Detective Inspector when she can.  Julia Land, aspiring actress, his love interest of series one, returns as a kind of bee in his bonnet. And a beautiful ""new"" woman enters the story to steal his heart. (Methinks it is feast or famine when it comes to women in Jackson's life.) Oh, and lest I forget, The Ambassador, a mangy mutt becomes an unlikely sidekick.  When I saw the little fur ball, I was reminded of an expression my dear departed mom used to say, ""That dog is so ugly, he's cute.""  I don't know, it's just something she used to say. It just fits somehow.

I think for those who liked the first, series two will not disappoint.  I hope I've written something that describes and perhaps tantalizes.  I aimed for ""vague"" so as not to spoil anyone's viewing pleasure.  Enjoy!",1387238400,21,3940,4.719941348973607

I am so glad I came upon this series.  Well acted and great stories based on the books by Kate Upton.  After viewing the series which I purchased, I read the books.",1370563200,11,336,4.370967741935484
5375056,5,B00A27OJ94,"Jason Isaacs is superb as the Edinburgh, Scotland, based Jackson Brodie, a tormented former soldier and policeman who became a private detective. He never recovered after the murder of his sister Niamh, and the suicide of his older brother. As usual, Isaacs is pitch-perfect as Jackson Brodie, every nuance evoked with subtlety. Brodie is as haunted as a peat bog by past tragedies that ripple the surface of the present. Happily for fans, ""Case Histories: Series 2"" reunites Jackson Brodie with his precocious daughter Marlee (Millie Innes is a rare talent), perhaps his most honest and real relationship.

The three features in ""Case Histories, Series 2"" are approximately 262 minutes in total; each feature is about 126 minutes long, with English subtitles (handy, if hearing the telly is difficult). The Extras run about 35 minutes.

Started Early, Took My Dog:
Based on a Kay Atkinson mystery novel, this first case opens with a vicious custody-case Jackson Brodie regrets being involved in; he winds up owing his employer, Mr. Minyawi, a favor. Returning to Edinburgh, he works to unravel a skein of mystery regarding a young woman's adoption, Hope Mamaster (beautifully played by Emma Hamilton). He is plagued by an old murder case that may connect with past colleagues, including Tracy, who has taken in an abused girl. Jackson recalls his hurt relationship with his mother, who abandoned him (it would have helped if the producers found a young actor that actually looks like a child-version of Jason Isaacs, as they did in Series 1, not one with curly red hair; we love ginger hair, that's not the issue). Policewoman Louise Munroe (Amanda Abbington) tries to help Jackson, while harboring feelings for him. The filming of Edinburgh is a treat, from Jackson Brodie's offices on Victoria Street, to lovely panoramas. A pleasing moment is when Jackson punches a an abusive owner of an adorable Border Terrier, who then chooses to go home with his rescuer; Brody calls his scruffy new pal The Ambassador (real name: Crunchie the Dog). It's remarked that such is a big name for a little dog; Jackson replies, ""He's big on the inside."" Like the TARDIS. This episode also features the return of Zawe Ashton, that fierce Scottish redhead and force-of-nature James Cosmo, and guest stars Victoria Wood in a fine turn as Tracy.

Nobody's Darling:
Rachel Stewart hires Brodie to follow Andy, her fiance, whose former mother in-law (played by the marvelous Diana Quick) believes killed Isobel, her horse-riding daughter. Jackson's professional integrity is questioned yet again, when a past mistake curdles his life; no good deed go unpunished. Jackson is also working a case trying to solve the reason for missing funds for a bookie; turns out he wins big betting on horse Nobody's Darling, but the police believe Brodie is involved in a scam. At the racetrack, he meets (and later beds) Charlotte McGill (Dawn Steele, memorable in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Monarch-of-the-Glen/dp/B004EYT8BA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Monarch of the Glen</a>. Marlee returns from New Zealand to try living with her dad, even inflicting&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Vegemite/dp/B001JDHUUA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Vegemite</a>&nbsp;on him, but she soon learns Jackson is a pretty unreliable case. I must comment that the music overall in this series may leave viewers seriously underwhelmed, not the kind of stuff that in real-life a male private detective, even one with a deep heart, would listen to!

Jackson and the Women:
Jackson Brodie takes on a case for a Aiden Kelso, a young man whose mother, Isla Kelso was murdered years ago in what was called the Christmas Shopper Murder. Meanwhile, the favor to Mr. Minyawi is called in, when he asks Jackson to find his missing daughter Samira; Westernized, she has run away from home to escape her father's more traditional Muslim expectations. Fatherhood and its difficulties is a recurring theme in Series 2. Julia, Brodie's actress ex-girlfriend (from Series 1) looms large on the horizon; is the baby his? Charlotte is still on the scene, but for how long, and what are her motivations? And Louise Munroe gets divorced and is now available as well, but Jackson is a muddle.

5375078,4,B00A27OJ94,"Unusual series and different from much of what comes out of the UK.  Brodie is a good-hearted character, but seriously flawed.  People take advantage of his goodness.  But he is not all good.  He is moral, but will go around the law when he feels the moral ""good"" is better than allowing the law to handle things.  Usually, there is more than one case he is working on at a time -- one old and one recent.  The reason I gave it 4 stars is that 1) the second season was not as well written and 2) the supporting cast was, too often, like ""chalk on a blackboard"" annoying.  I'll avoid spoilers only to state that a woman from the first story reappears and I found her so annoying that it was unbelievable that he would have her back in his life.  The best, his assistant, was given too little to do.  But, Jason Isaacs plays Brodie as a genuine, but seriously flawed individual.  Unfortunately, some of the continuity could have been better -- dragging out his back-story took too long.  Second, the folk music was beautiful (and appropriate to the scenes), but sometimes went on too long.  Who does the subtitles?  I'm American, and sometimes the Scottish accent is hard to catch but even I knew that when a character said ""here it comes"" that does not translate into a subtitle of ""Hugo.""  I find this often.  Last, the single parent, with an adversarial relationship to the other parent, has been done.  It was unnecessary.  Recommended but 4 stars because I think it's not for everyone.  Isaacs yes but the rest of the casting (with the aforementioned assistant and his first season daughter excepted) were lacking and annoying.  Or their story lines were.  Edinburgh is beautiful.",1522800000,,1683,4.602693602693603

5375114,5,B00A27OJ94,"Wow. This is good. As I read in one other review (I'm sure others have written the same): why do the Brits make such great shows when we have so much dreck on this side of the pond. Jason Isaacs--sometimes charming, sometimes annoying, always brilliant--plays a detective with a tortured past whose self-described job is to find people and not lose anyone. The actors around him are great, as well as the often sideways plots. Watched the first season in a weekend and was overjoyed that they made another three episodes in 2014.

Edinburgh is beautiful.

That comment about the Brits always making better mysteries was not really fair--Longmire and Bosch are both excellent. Interesting that neither program is produced by a traditional 'network.'

At any rate, even BBC's throw-aways, like ""Zen,"" are better than most of the stuff on offer over here.",1487376000,,852,4.944055944055944

5375124,2,B00A27OJ94,"Kate Atkinson wrote only four Jackson Brodie novels, so Case Histories Series 2 includes two original stories written for television by Emily Ballou and Debbie OMalley. The first episode is based on an Atkinson novel. There are three episodes in this series, all feature-length at 90 minutes, first aired in the UK in 2013. Jason Isaacs returns as Jackson Brodie, brooding ex-cop, ex-soldier, now private investigator in Edinburgh, Scotland, who is becoming more dysfunctional by the minute. Unfortunately, the writers, including Atkinson, have mistaken dysfunction for personality, so were treated to a man who compulsively plays Good Samaritan to the most screwed-up creatures he can find in order to cope with his justifiable lack of self-worth. He doesnt investigate mysteries so much as he offends everyone connected to the case until they lose their patience and he stumbles upon the culprit. His interactions with former colleague and object of his desire DC Louise Munroe are outrageously inappropriate and embarrassing. He has mental health problems; its not charming.

I don't know why anyone likes to watch dysfunction on television. Television should transport viewers to fantasyland, where we watch people who are richer, smarter, and/or lead more interesting lives than we do. People whom we would like to know or be, not people with whom we would do anything to avoid contact in real life. It goes beyond lazy writing; its bizarre. Five minutes with Brodie in real life, and you hope he has a psychiatrist whom he sees regularly -out of concern for public safety- but you expect hes committed to being an object of pity and rage, alternately. Beyond that, the first episode is so convoluted that its is difficult to follow the plot. The third is so dark that characters faces are engulfed in shadow. The second features Millie Innes as Brodies daughter Marlee, who incredibly is allowed to live with him. Marlee acts like a 12-year-old, which I assume is the intended age. But the actress is so diminutive, she appears to be about 8 years old. Just another peculiarity in a series that relentlessly tests the audience willingness to suspend disbelief.

The episodes are:

Started Early, Took My Dog begins with a bang, as Brodie has involved himself in the kidnapping of a child in Germany. His ego and body bruised, Brodie returns to Edinburgh to a pile of bills, an indignant secretary Deborah (Zawe Ashton), and a new client, Hope McMaster (Emma Hamilton). Hamilton is the adoptive daughter of a fashion model and her husband, both now dead, who is looking for her biological mother but has no records to go on. Brodies only lead is a retired police officer named Ray (Maurice Roeves) and his wife, who knew the adoptive parents, but this seems to be a dead end. Meanwhile, Brodie is tipped off to the murder of prostitute Carol Braithwaite (Angela Hardie) decades before. In looking up that case, he speaks to the officers that found her body, Barry (Gary Lewis) and now-retired Tracy Waterhouse (Victoria Wood), who offer a new perspective on the case that might connect it to the present day. Taking in those who have been victims of cruelty and caring for them is a running theme, but Brodies dysfunction overwhelms a very strained plot.

Brodies daughter Marlee has returned from abroad to live with him in Nobodys Darling. Soon to be married, Rachel Stewart (Michelle Duncan), hires Brodie to follow her fianc Andy Marshall (Mark Bonnar), as she wonders about his frequent absences. Rachel was nanny to Andys son, before his wife Isobel died in an equestrian accident 5 years before. Brodie finds that Andys former mother-in-law Miriam Baker (Diana Quick) suspected him of being responsible for her daughters death. Meanwhile, Deborah is running a honeypot scam out of Brodies office, and a bookmaker who owes Brodie money, Ian Mackie (Tom Cotcher), comes to a bad end, leading DC Louise Munroe (Amanda Abbington) and a hot-shot fraud investigator to drag him in for questioning. Brodies relationship with Munroe is more strained than ever, after he attends a party hosted by her new husband Patrick (Paterson Joseph). But Brodie has new girlfriend in art historian Charlotte (Dawn Steele). He stumbles around the case alienating everyone until he stumbles upon the solution.

Brodies secretary Deborah quits right off the bat in Jackson and the Women, just as a new client walks in the door. Aiden Kelso (Oliver Coopersmith) is a young man whose mother Isla went missing on Christmas Eve, when he was a child, only to be found dead in the river. Her murder was blamed on a serial killer, but that man denied it, when he admitted other crimes. So Aiden has come to Brodie for answers. Meanwhile, Mr. Minyawi (Emilio Doorgasingh), the creepy character who involved him in the German kidnapping in episode one, insists that Brodie retrieve his errant 19-year-old daughter Samira (Gem Carmella). Brodie locates her with ease, in the clutches of an abusive boyfriend, but she chafes at her fathers controlling ways. Brodie runs into a voluble, ditzy actress with whom he had an affair, Julia Land (Natasha Little), who is now pregnant and making a false show of wanting to raise the child alone, evoking Brodies compulsion to help people he imagines in need. The photography in this episode is so dark that faces and details often cant be made out.",1476489600,,5368,4.986607142857143

I still enjoyed it, though--most of the things I loved about the first series were still there.  The mysteries were still enthralling, and I still cared about the characters.  I particularly enjoyed the Jackson & Marlee storyline, as it was simultaneously realistic, funny, and painful, which I probably shouldn't have enjoyed the 'painful' part, but it was part of the whole package, so I don't feel so bad about it.

Recommend for fans of the first series, as it doesn't really stand on its own, since there are certain characters who have past history you won't get as much if you try to watch this series first.

I tried to understand why Jackson told Louise he could never lover her. Did he really mean that? Was he saying that to completely make her hate him so she wouldn't want a relationship? It was so un-nerving. He tells her the affect she has always had on him and then says something so cruel. If he can never love her, why? Amanda Abbington was so brilliant in that scene.

5375205,5,B00A27OJ94,"Fans of Jackson Brodie will appreciate this second season which starts off a bit darker than some of last season's episodes.  Marlee, his daughter, is in Australia.  Jackson gets involved with a deal which compromises his values.  Louise, his romantic interest, seems to have moved on.  His administrative assistant is ticked off with him more than usual.  It's a dark time.  If you're not already enamored of Brodie, it might be difficult to plop down in the middle of all of this gloom.  However, devotees of his, will stick with him as he goes through a rough patch.

He has innovative mysteries to solve, as usual, thanks to author Kate Atkinson's imaginative sensibility.  Edinburgh is its usual scenic and panoramic self.

There is also some commentary from Jason Isaacs and the other actors and crew. The behind-the-scenes on stunts and make-up is especially interesting.

5375256,5,B00A27OJ94,"CASE HISTORIES, after a long absence it seems, is back. Series star Jason Isaacs has been busy working in America the past few years and appears to be settled there for the present. When he was formally approached to revisit the role of Jackson Brodie, his world-weary character in CASE HISTORIES, he actually turned it down. Not out of disinterest, but for domestic reasons. With his family well-settled in the U.S., he didn't want to uproot them or require them to move back to the U.K. on a temporary basis. Fortunately, Isaacs has a very understanding wife! She insisted he sign on for series two. That's a good thing, because Jason Isaacs as Jackson Brodie has managed to carve his own niche in the detective genre. Without his star power, I suspect CASE HISTORIES would be just another detective show. With Isaacs at the forefront though, it is much more than that.

Nonetheless, Isaacs would be the first to insist the pedigree of the show begins with the writing. The novels of Kate Atkinson served as the source for the first series and the first episode of series two. Having exhausted the source novels for the moment, there was some concern as to whether the continuity of the show would be compromised by having scripts by other writers created solely for the series and not published first as novels. Fortunately Ms Atkinson was on hand to tweak the scripts written from scratch and offer reassurances. The quality of the writing has been maintained. The choice to make the episodes of series two 90 minutes each as opposed to the two-part format of series one is also an improvement. The stories are more succinct and the pacing tighter. When you consider that CASE HISTORIES isn't really about the cases but about the characters, this is a significant improvement.

You see, CASE HISTORIES, at its very core, is primarily a character study. And while many examples exist in the detective genre of the battle-scarred protagonist with a destructive tendency and a checkered past, few portray it as well as Jason Isaacs. His Jackson Brodie is a curious mixture of qualities which lead him to make the wrong decisions in his personal life and the right decisions in his professional life. Here's a great quote from Jason Isaacs himself, describing Brodie: ""He's a very noble and fearless individual and incredibly instinctive when it comes to peeling back the layers of what's holding other people back, and not just finding out when and why a crime was committed, but how people are crippled or imprisoned by their pasts""

This ""incredible instinct"" when it comes to helping people is the direct result of his own troubled past, a past he is constantly trying to reconcile within himself. This makes what could be a cliche (the ""battle-scarred protagonist"" etc.) a defining characteristic of Brodie and a fundamental element to each storyline.

The quality of CASE HISTORIES continues with its brilliant cinematography on location in Edinburgh, Scotland and its rainy, Celtic moodiness. For example, quite often characters are shown against windows or other brightly lit backgrounds, suggesting that their shadowed faces are a metaphor for their shadowy circumstances, and that happiness, resolution, contentment, etc. is, for the moment at least, just out of reach. There is genuine artistry on display in CASE HISTORIES at every level of production, an attraction that helped to entice a number of outstanding actors to appear in the second series. Victoria Wood, for example, best known in the U.K. as a comedienne, is outstanding in the first episode, creating a wonderful character whose pain is just below her wise-cracking surface and who manages to find redemption when Brodie helps her cover up a legally dicey but morally right decision. This episode also sees Brodie acquire, at least temporarily, a dog, who adds some smiles to the goings on. The manner in which Brodie acquires the dog is a defining moment in understanding his character. He does what every one of us who love animals would aspire to do in a similar circumstance. No spoilers here, though. You'll have to find out for yourself.

The second and third episodes do not miss a beat in furthering our understanding of Brodie. Given that these are the two original scripts in this series and not adapted from novels, that says a lot. And what's best about all this is that by the end of the third episode we are primed to want to know more about Brodie. A third series has not yet been announced at the time of this writing, but we can only hope that it will materialize.

If there is one element of this show that has proven to be divisive among its audience it is the use of background music. Specifically songs. It is now a tired and worn cliche to see and hear in any number of dramas being produced today a montage-like sequence at the end of the episode where a song is played over snippets of scenes which help to wrap up the story. CASE HISTORIES takes this by now annoying feature one step further and inserts song bits throughout the episodes. I understand these are reflective of Brodie's love of country music (by nature inclined to themes about heartbreak and sadness) but enough is enough! As much as I love this show and stand by my rating, this one trying aspect almost had me running screaming from the room whenever it occurred.

Please, Mr Isaacs, pull back on this. The country song as Greek Chorus no longer works (if it ever did).

The behind-the-scenes interviews on this two DVD set from Acorn are fun and one comes away particularly impressed by the intelligence of child actor Millie Innes, who plays Brodie's daughter, Marlee. She is especially effective in episode two when she comes back from New Zealand to live with her dad.

CASE HISTORIES is most welcome after its extended time away and we can only hope for further Jackson Brodie adventures in the near future. But ditch the music, please!",1406160000,2,5911,4.821499013806706
5375257,5,B00A27OJ94,"Jason Isaacs is wonderful as Jackson Brodie, a complicated former policman turned private investigator.  He doesn't make money, as he repeatedly takes on clients who are hopeless cases, lost, abandoned, helpless, hurt, or wretched.  He has a good heart and he loves his daughter Marlee above all else, but he is constantly in trouble because his cases inevitably lead him to those responsible for evil, and often they are persons who should be honest and good.  This is crime drama at its very best, gritty and terse, and yet compelling.  The series is based on the Jackson Brodie books by Kate Atkinson, and the first episode of series 2 is adapted from her novel Started Early, Took My Dog.  The other two episodes are original works, but follow the character of Jackson as in the novel based episodes.  There are moments, especially with daughter Marlee that the viewer laughs out loud, and there are other times that the action is so chillingly horrible, it is difficult to watch.  But watch you do until the episode ends, and you breathe again, waiting to see where Jackson will go next.  Intense and well written, this belongs on the shelf of mystery and crime drama fans, it is not a ""cozy"" mystery series, but those who enjoy character mysteries will find this one intriguing.  It is sharp, dark, intelligent and feels very real.",1406073600,4,1337,4.778260869565218

5375264,5,B00A27OJ94,"When I received a review copy of the second season of this well-done crime/mystery series that was produced in 2011 by BBC Scotland (and affiliate of Englands BBC, but separate) I realized I had not seen the first season and its always best to start at the beginning, so I got this set of Season One. (Actually the package does not actually say first season as maybe the series hadnt been renewed at that time. It has been though.).  After watching  (and reviewing  see my review)  the first set  I can tell you that you really need to start at the beginning. There are continuing relationships that form in this set that will be essential to understand later volumes.

 As I post this there are already 10 reviews. But I note that nearly all are from 2013 - over a year ago.  and I want to make you aware that Amazon has a policy of grouping ALL reviews of ALL formats of a film or TV series together, whether it was in theaters, on TV, Streaming or on DVD or Bluray. So I always recommend that folks sort by Newest First and then look at both the date and the format that the customer is reviewing. This is of the physical two-disc DVD package which will be released in the US by RLJ (formerly Acorn) on July 15, 2014. There are major differences in the RLJ from previous ones and I want you to be aware of that.

For the sake of briefness, Ill assume you have come to this review after seeing Series 1 and so you know who Jackson Brodie is- as well as his daughter Marnee and other main characters. (If you don't go back to Series 1, as I said above). With that said, Ill point out that, unlike season 1 which consisted of 3 stories based on a series of books by Kate Atkinson,  the producers reformatted it into three episodes  each lasting approximately 90 minutes. This makes it flow smoother. Also, onlt the first episode is based on an Atkinson novel; the other two are newly scripted.

Ill let you read other reviews (but be aware of spoilers) for more on the content in Series 2 but will offer some suggestions for those in the US ordering this series:
1) There is an English Subtitles option on the DVD (added by Acorn Media). I recommend that you enable this feature). There are quite a few Scottish words which will confuse you.  And Acorn gives the viewer subtitles that are large, in bright yellow, and easy to read. Some of the best subtitles Ive found.

2) The series aired in the US on Masterpiece Mystery but in an EDITED version. Probably about 7 minutes or so. In addition to allowing for funding messages Im sure it was for some pretty graphic violence as well as language (the S-word).

3) Theres another interesting reason for using the subtitles. This time around the producers of the show decided to join the trend now to include nearly complete recordings by singer-songwriter to set the mood. For Jackson they use Americana recording artists like Lucionda Williams, The Cowboy Junkies and, a favorite of mine, Mary Gauthier). The artists are  surprisingly  not credited in the end credits, BUT they are identified  and the lyrics provided  as part of the subtitles!  (Way to go RLJ !)

As in Series 1 each of the three stories has two crime stories running together .

The DVD has TWO Bonus Features this time, though they overlap :
A behind the scenes featurette (18  minutes) with the cast as and the series Producer, which includes a lot of scenes from the show

A set of five Cast and Crew interviews (27 minutes) with four of the cast as well as the Executive Producer. No clips here. It looks like some of these were used in the Behind featurette. Honestly, this time it was a bit of overkill, in my opinion.

Brodie is still saying  Ill see what I can do. When approached by folks who are concerned for their lives.  But we also get to learn a lot more about his relationships with women (past and present and of various ages) this time around. If you liked Series1, Im sure youll enjoy Series 2.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

5375266,5,B00A27OJ94,"CASE HISTORIES, Series 2, (2013).  This ITV-produced British mystery television series is set and filmed in Scotland.  The first series received its BBC TV debut in 2011, and was seen in the United States on PBS's Masterpiece Mystery. The second series aired in the U.K. on BBC in 2013, now makes its U.S. debut. Edinburgh-based private investigator Jackson Brodie, an emotionally-damaged former soldier and Edinburgh cop, finds himself tracking lost cats, wayward spouses, and killers on the run.  And he does a lot of running himself to escape the memories of his traumatic past.  The productions are based on the bestselling, award-winning novels by Kate Atkinson; the series was created for TV by Ashley Pharoah, (LIFE ON MARS). The box series consists of three episodes, totaling approximately 273 minutes or 4  hours, on 2 DVDs. It contains nudity, violence and coarse language and is intended for mature audiences only.  And, thank goodness and thank you RLJ Entertainment, it has subtitles, else viewers on my side of the Atlantic would be well and truly lost with the witty Scots dialog.

Brodie (Jason Isaacs, HARRY POTTER, THE PATRIOT) is just trying to make a living. He has a hard time collecting his debts and paying his bills, but no shortage of clients, since he can't overlook a wrong or say no to a person in need. This character-driven series also stars Amanda Abbington, (AGATHA CHRISTIE'S POIROT, SHERLOCK), as DC Louise Munroe, seemingly the last Edinburgh cop still talking to her former colleague, and Zawe Ashton, (FRESH MEAT), as Deborah Arnold, Brody's longsuffering assistant. Millie Innes plays Brodie's daughter Marlee; Kirsty Mitchell, ex-wife Josie, Natasha Little, (KIDNAP AND RANSOM), his ex-lover actress Julia Land.  Some of his clients are parents looking for children; some children, looking for parents.  Some are concerned with the past; some, with the future. The women in Brodie's life don't seem to offer him much peace, either. Series star Isaacs, a Golden Globe and International Emmy nominee, ably plays Brodie as a moody, damaged but still tough guy with a soft heart.  He carries the series with empathy, a realization of the terrible cost of violence to its survivors as well as its victims, and biting Scottish humor.

Disc 1
Episode 1: Started Early, Took My Dog
The investigator agrees to help a handsome young Australian woman.  She had been given up for adoption, has returned to Edinburgh to find her real parents. His investigation leads him to a 35-year-old secret; carrying it has troubled everyone involved. Brodie must decide whether to let the law take its course or do what he thinks best for a child.

Episode 2: Nobody's Darling
A pretty young nanny hires Brodie to see if her employer/fianc&eacute; is cheating on her. During his inquiries he is also hired by the man's ex-mother-in-law, who suspects the fianc&eacute; of having murdered her daughter. A straightforward investigation turns into a cold case.  Marlee, Brodie's pubescent daughter, moves in with him; his home life gets difficult.

Disc 2
Episode 3: Jackson and the Women
The women in Brodie's life give him a tough time.  He takes on two new cases. A teenage boy asks him to investigate the murder of his mother, killed on Christmas Eve when her boy was three. A family hires him to locate their missing 19-year-old daughter. What he discovers in both is painful for all parties, but particularly painful for Brodie. He makes  decisions that are costly for him but give the two young people a chance to move forward.

The characterizations are deep and complex in these three stories, as are their plots, yet the suspense never lets up.  The Scottish settings are occasionally tourist-beautiful, Brodie seems to do most of his running around Arthur's Seat or on the beach; but they are usually in gritty, little-seen corners of the country's capital.  Can the series be characterized as tartan noir?  I think so.  Sex, in your face violence, dark Scottish humor.  And what is tartan noir when it's at home?  Written by a Scot, of course, and containing the above-cited ingredients. At any rate, I found the series powerful, satisfying, surprising and gripping; involving in its emphasis on family relations, particularly those with/of daughters, as was the first series. And, as I recall, the Atkinson book on which the TV treatments are based, CASE HISTORIES.  (Oddly enough, I was given that book as a birthday present upon its publication, but remember that I didn't quite care for it, though I don't remember why. I certainly wouldn't consider the underlying books tartan noir, they're much too literary for that. )  Nevertheless, I quite liked the first series of this production, which I reviewed on its web site, and in this house, we love this one.",1404518400,5,4786,5.011363636363637
5375267,5,B00A27OJ94,"Not a conventional PI crime investigative series. Edinburgh beauty & magic. It is a bit absurd, a little action, a touch of humor, and lots of drama surrounding the characters. Focus is on individual's lives more than the getting to the end of complicated cases. Often it becomes multiple cases that end up intertwined due to character relationships. A recurrence of a season opening situation takes place in each episode. Aside from Brodie, `Case Histories 2' is defined by female characters. Episodes are 90 min rather than stories in 2 hour-long parts.
Jason Isaacs as Brodie, a push-over, ex-cop now PI, and domestically a train wreck. DC Munroe (Amanda Abbington -`Mr Salfridge) returns as romantic friction. Zawe Ashton as Deborah, gorgeous, capable, under appreciated, office-everything for Brodie. Millie Innes returns in first 2 episodes as Brodie's 12 yr old daughter and steals many scenes.

SDH SUBTITLES provided for features and bonus stuff.
1-Started Early, Took My Dog -the name of the adapted 4th book by Kate Atkinson. Adopted Aussie lady (Emma Hamilton) gets Brodie's help finding her Edinburgh parent roots. A 1/3 century old secret hinders progress as does Brodie's tag-along dog. Answers found but decisions to be made. Tracy Waterhouse (Victoria Wood) is a mall security guard with a child issue.
2-Nobody's Darling -Brodie looks into a cheating finance at the bride-to-be's (Michelle Duncan) request simultaneously as another person has him checking about possible murder. Same man? Daughter Marlee has moved in with Brodie as well. Domestic complexity, since he sleeps with Charlotte (Dawn Steele `Lexie of Monarch of the Glen'.) She appears in the next episode too.
3-Jackson and the Women -This episode like the last are not from Atkinson books but based on characters of the books. A teen's mother murdered on a past Christmas Eve is investigated at the same time as the case of a family's missing teenager. The latter is tied to Brodie's past. Deborah quits. Brodie bumps into ex-girlfriend Julia (Natasha Little) from series 1 who's displaying a bump, BUT Brodie's still sharing sheets with Charlotte. Agh, Brodie's women!",1403222400,2,2152,5.219653179190751
