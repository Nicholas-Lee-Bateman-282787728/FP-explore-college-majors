2099869,5,B0002JP568,My 2 1/2 year old son originally saw this movie as a rental from the library.  He loved it so much that we had to buy it.  He is a car/truck lover and thinks this movie is the greatest!  It will keep him hooked for the entire duration.,1127088000,4,235,3.8541666666666665
2099870,5,B0002JP568,"It is getting harder and harder to find video's to grab my son's attention through the entire DVD.  He's not so into Elmo and Sesame Street anymore.  He loves trucks, tractors, or anything else with Big Wheels.  He constantly askes to watch this video, and he actually does.  He's started saying ""I wanna ride in Daddy's Tonka truck"".  I hope they create additional DVD's as good as this one!",1121385600,12,392,4.6231884057971016
2099871,5,B0002JP568,"Great DVD!  As stated above, a little cheesy at times, but my 2 year old boy loves the sounds and action.  Very clean entertainment compared with today's ""gang style"", videos.  Hope another one is in the works...",1118275200,8,212,4.675675675675675
2099872,5,B0002JP568,"Like others, we rented this for our 3 1/2 yr old son - he loved it! So now we have purchased it.  Great story line for this age range plus cool trucks!!  You won't be sorry if you add this to your home library.",1117411200,7,210,3.75
2099873,5,B0002JP568,"We too, rented this movie, and my 4 and 5 year old boys absolutely loved the movie.  They watched it basically, non-stop, for 5 days!!  I enjoy the computer animation style, and it's a little hokey - but for the boys - it's good clean entertainment.  I really recommend this if you have young boys.",1109808000,14,298,4.381818181818182
2099874,4,B0002JP568,"We rented this movie and my 3-year-old boy loved it.  He keeps asking for it even after we had to return it.  I've heard him singing, ""Tonka, Tonka, Ton-ka!"" (Think conga line...!)  My one-year-old boy liked it, too.  Definitely a good little boy movie!",1107561600,2,253,4.681818181818182
2099875,4,B0002JP568,"I bought this on a whim, and my little boys, 2 and 4, BOTH love it.

Although it is a bit cheesy at times, in general it is good, clean, TONKA-TIME fun.  Perfect for little boys!!!

Yep, they will want to watch it once a day for a while, but it is a show you can let them watch with NO worries.",1099872000,12,294,3.7096774193548385
2099876,5,B0002JP568,My son's Godfather bought this for him a week ago.  We have to watch it at least twice a day.  It has a nice little story to it with lots of action.  Great for little boys.,1099785600,7,172,3.7222222222222223
2099877,4,B0002JP568,"I bought this for my friend's grandchildren.  The little 3 year old boy loved it, his 8 year old sister tolerated it, and the 10 year old boy liked it.  They all wanted to watch it again after it was over (always a good sign).",1098144000,5,226,4.0
2099878,5,B0002JP568,Every little boy should have this video... Gave it to my 2 grandsons and they still love to watch it.,1205625600,,101,4.1
2099879,1,B0002JP568,"I am surprised by all of the positive reviews for this DVD.  I found it appalling.  It's basically just an extended advertisement for Tonka trucks, with fetishistic close-ups of the logo every few minutes.  The part I saw showed gigantic cannons mounted on the roofs of monster trucks, blasting water in missile form at a raging forest fire.  It was intimidating and shallow, cheaply animated, with really creepy characters shouting all their lines.  After my son saw this (some relatives showed it to him without asking me), I wished I could rinse off his brain.  Thank god for Harold & the Purple Crayon, Gumby, Totoro, and all the other creative shows for kids that make this stuff unnecessary.",1200268800,2,697,4.864406779661017
2099880,5,B0002JP568,"These are the only words that come out of my 2 1/2 yr olds mouth these past few days.  Great action and cool animation.  It will keep your lil one busy for hours.  My kid watches this movie first thing in the morning and last thing at night. Addicting? yes, but anything that makes a lil boy this enthusiastic can't be a bad thing.",1198886400,,331,4.140625
2099881,5,B0002JP568,"My son, who is turning 5 this year loves this movie!  We have owned it for a couple of years now.  It is animated, fun, and teaches a some values.  The animation is very good, Tonka Joe, who is the main character, ""Has great hair"" as my son put it!  The trucks talk and the movie pokes a little fun at the ""bad guy""  Best of all it will teach your child to always tell the truth, and be good to other people!
We love it!!
I only wish that they would come out with another!",1189900800,,472,3.875
2099882,5,B0002JP568,"I originally purchased this Tonka Joe movie in VHS format for my 3 year old grandson.  But after watching the video 4 or 5 times a day when visiting me, I thought it best to purchase a DVD version.  My grandson just loves this movie.  I don't usually let him watch that much TV/DVD, but this is one thing that he insists on watching - over and over and over. I just love watching his eye light up everytime Tonka Joe comes to the rescue.  I just wish there were more Tonka Joe movies for him to watch.",1179100800,,501,4.081632653061225
2099883,5,B0002JP568,"I had no problem with the timliness of this movie, it arrived in the new condition it was supposed to. Thanks~",1178409600,,110,4.285714285714286
2099884,5,B0002JP568,Great Item for four year old and Dad.,1169078400,,37,3.75
2099885,4,B0002JP568,"This is a really good boys story for ages 4-7. My son loved it, now we just can not find the trucks!!!  I would not hessitate the give it as a present. It has some teachings of fair play, although I'm not sure if children can understand it. Worth the money!",1164758400,3,257,4.03921568627451
2099886,5,B0002JP568,"This video is great for little boys! Both my sons (ages 3 and 4) LOVE it! I have searched and searched for other Tonka videos, but I think this is the only one! I hope they make more! It was a hit with my children! It started their Tonka craze which has lead to the computer CD rom and many trucks! THanks TOnka for a great product!!!",1155600000,6,334,4.0

8028263,5,B0002JP568,"When you have a good idea of what you want to give for a gift, but don't feel like fighting the traffic or the crowds. just go to Amazon. You'll probably save time and certainly will save gas money by shopping online. You have a giant store at your finger tips. I have used Amazon and their sellers for years and can say with sincerity every purchase made through Amazon has been enjoyable.",1374364800,,390,4.3561643835616435

8028266,5,B0002JP568,"If your 3-6 yr. old loves trucks, this is a great video, teaching good values.  Mine asked for it non-stop for a week.  Joe and his team of super-tricked trucks saves others from natural and man-made disasters. Exciting but not too scary.",1248134400,,238,4.642857142857143
8028267,5,B0002JP568,My 3-yr old son loves this movie.  I was a bit skeptical at first but once the movie started I really liked it too.  It has a great story line also.  I highly recommend this movie!,1215820800,,180,3.9444444444444446
8028268,5,B0002JP568,"Our two year old son loves this video.  He was originally hooked on Barney, but after listening to several months of him chanting ""truck, truck"" and pointing out every truck he saw on the road, we thought we would give this a try.  It is his favorite video, hands down, and he will ask to watch it almost every day.  As another reviewer noted, the close up ""Tonka"" shots are a bit overdone, but the story and characters are actually pretty decent considering this was not a blockbuster Disney type release.  Overall we are very satisfied with this purchase and we hope our son continues to enjoy it for at least another month or so!  Only wish there were more in the series...",1211068800,,676,4.463414634146342
