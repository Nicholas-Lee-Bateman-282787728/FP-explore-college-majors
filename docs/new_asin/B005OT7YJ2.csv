This era of cartoons were great for watching on Saturday mornings, and now I have them for when I am working in my office (or on Saturday mornings) This has good little adventure stories and is the series you remember from the 80's I think it was.",1378425600,3,340,4.412698412698413

fun for all ages.",1372377600,,114,4.476190476190476
4854506,4,B005OT7YJ2,"I have always been a fan of classic cartoons, and I loved the video game, too. This is a good cartoon to accompany the series. The only problems I have is the fact that Dirk didn't have a squire, and Singe, the dragon, did not talk. I imagine they added these things to make the show more interesting. But, overall, it follows the general tone of the game, even asking viewers what Dirk should do in certain situations, and then showing the outcome of each decision. The video quality is outstanding. Either the show wasn't played very much, or Warner Bros. took great care to restore it. Either way, the picture looks fantastic. No complaints there. Even though the animation wasn't done by Don Bluth, it's still worth checking out if you're a fan of Dragon's Lair, or of classic cartoons in general.",1367366400,7,801,4.608391608391608
4854507,5,B005OT7YJ2,"It was great to watch and share the cartoons I was watching as a child with my nieces and nephews.
Dragons Lair is a fun and wholesome show for everyone. I was pleased with all thirteen episodes. The only thing you have to get used to is the mono audio other then that awesome!",1342915200,5,277,4.148148148148148
4854508,4,B005OT7YJ2,"In the early `80s, when arcades were the place to spend your allowance money and the Atari 2600 was the Xbox 360 of is day, Saturday morning TV sought to capitalize on the success of the first video game era. Even though that first wave ended up being more of a fad than a phenomenon (the crash in the mid `80s nearly killed the market altogether until Nintendo resurrected it in 1987 and never looked back), that didn't stop networks like CBS and ABC from launching cartoons based on ""Pac-Man,"" ""Donkey Kong,"" ""Q*Bert,"" ""Pole Position"" and ""Dragon's Lair.""

The latter made the most sense of all the games to adapt into a cartoon, since ""Dragon's Lair"" was no ordinary video game: it was one of several laser-disc games, fully animated by Don Bluth and an absolute pain in the behind to play (most of us kids would insert 50 cents and last about 5 seconds in a game that was all about memorizing moves as opposed to hand/eye coordination). Still, it looked cool with Dirk the Daring out to save Princess Daphne from the Dragon ""Singe"" in a colorful medieval castle - elements which animators Ruby-Spears wisely opted to retain in their brief Saturday morning adaptation, which the Warner Archive has brought to DVD this month.

The two-disc set includes all 13 episodes of the short-lived series in acceptable full-screen transfers with mono audio. John Debney scored the series, doing a nice job infusing the limited animation pallet with majestic orchestral tones.",1337040000,9,1467,4.817460317460317

8481812,5,B005OT7YJ2,"Dragon's Lair the TV Saturday Morning Cartoon Show continues the adventures of Dirk the Daring, with Princess Daphne, on their quest to thwart the evil doings of Singe the despicable Dragon and his giddy goons. The realm of Dragon's Lair is filled with danger and endless decisions that you and Dirk will have to overcome if he's to survive. While this is a TV show and not an actual game, the show does show the results of each step Dirk could have taken, first wrong, then the right choice and the animated results.
The show has good animation, voices and interesting stories for an 80's cartoon, and is remastered for this series on two discs. Disc two has a lot more episodes for some reason, but very welcome and it's an enjoyable extension of Dirk's adventures, even if this has been tamed down for kid's TV; so don't expect the violent sword slicing of the video game Dragon's Lair that sliced a Goon in two. Recommended for Dragon's Lair fans.",1454630400,,951,4.6

8481818,3,B005OT7YJ2,"If you know the original Dragon's Lair games then you know they were beautifully animated by Don Bluth, showed over the top action, death scenes and above all slapstick humor.

While the series tries its best to emulate the games it falls short in many places. The animation is well done but nowhere near the detail and luster of the Don Bluth game animation.

The action in the series is nearly constant as well as the slap-stick humor which is mostly provided by the hapless Dirk the Daring and his squire Timothy as well as the Giddy Goons employed by Singe the Dragon.

While the show's death scene aspect isn't nearly as violent or graphic as the games it still manages to make you feel bad or horrified if you chose the wrong course of action in the ""What should Dirk do?"" segments. Basically before each commercial break when the series originally aired on Saturday morning cartoons Dirk would find himself in a life or death situation and the narrator would ask you the viewer ""What should Dirk do?""

Most times the wrong choice leads to a horrific death or some sort of injury for Dirk. Many happen off screen so it's not too violent for younger kids.

Also there are some ""What should Dirk Do?"" segments where they don't give you the full choices of what he can do so no matter what you pick you lose which seems vindictive or at the very least poor planning by the creators.

As is typical with many cartoons of the 80s the show usually tries to teach a moral like lying is bad or stealing is wrong so it does try to balance out the violence with a moral.

Still despite its few shortcomings its a fun show full of quests, knights, magic and damsels in distress. I would recommend this to anyone who is a fan of sword and sorcery tales.",1397865600,3,1747,4.423676012461059
