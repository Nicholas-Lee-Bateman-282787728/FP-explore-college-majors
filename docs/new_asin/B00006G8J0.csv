7968590,1,B00006G8J0,"The Farrelly Brothers are perverted sicko degenerates. I had a sick feeling after watching ""Shallow Hal"" and ""There's Something About Mary"". Do not buy these sick movies and do not let your children or anyone else you care about watch them.",1102636800,2,240,4.878048780487805
7968591,2,B00006G8J0,"Dumb & Dumber??? KINGPIN????? How could you POSSIBLY call this a Farrelly Collection without these two gems- only the best two films they made! ""Mary"" had it's moments, but loses you towards the end. ""Irene"", aside from an occational laugh (the sons were HILARIOUS!!!) was average at best. And ""Hal"" was WAY too sweet for the likes of a Farrelly movie. I literally ROARED the first time I saw ""Dumb & Dumber"" & ""Kingpen"" and wore out several gears in my VCR from the constant rewinding to catch what I missed during the laughter. This box set makes as much sense as DVD box entitled ""The Ultimate George Lucas Collection"" with only American Graffitti & Howard the Duck. Too bad.",1038787200,7,678,4.658333333333333
7968592,5,B00006G8J0,"The trilogy you're  about to order is of utmost comedic genious.  Obove the master comedy touch of the great Farrelly bros., check out the smooth, suave and symbolic musical selections by the one and only Tom Wolfe. Who in their right mind would blend a samuri wielding dildo chopper with the melodic vibes of Steely Danesque riffs and Foo Fighter upbeat, core to the bone montrosity.  Oh, and then there's the sperm ridden do of Diaz whilst chords by Jonathan Richman entice the viwer/listener to ""relax and enjoy the symbolic climatic moment of the scene.""  Oh yes, Mr. Wolfe is a master of matching scene with melody, drama with c-chords, pinched weany heads with lemonHEADS.  Gotta appreciate the Wolfe touch which brings the comedic genius of the Farrelly's to life.  Go Tom go!!!!",1038614400,,786,4.87218045112782
7968593,5,B00006G8J0,"I have seen all three of these movies. And i don't think i stopped laughing during them. Here is why:
THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT MARY: This movie has so many sex related jokes, it's worse than High School. I think they tell 5 different names for ""cleaning the pipes"". or Mary using ""baby batter"" for Hair Gel. Then there is all the little things.
ME, MYSELF, AND IRENE: I mean no disrespect AT ALL toward those with schizophrenia, but this movie has Jim Carrey as one funny schizo. The funniest characters would have to be Carrey's sons. Their speech makes sailors look like nuns. then all the problems that happen to the duo are hilarious.
SHALLOW HAL: THis movie is funny. It may make fun of the obese, but it is still funny. But the real story is Hal gains the ability to see the inner beauty of a woman. Jason Alexander is a ""dog"" of a character in this movie (you will get the joke when you see it.) This is good, but could have been better.
OVERALL: The Farrelly Bros. are comic masterminds. I would buy this set if i didn't already have ""Mary"". Hope someone listens. Peace out All!",1031270400,4,1085,4.402985074626866
