Salman Khan is effortless in his role as Prem and he looked like he was having fun making this movie as there was a classic scene( plucked out of his other blockbuster movie) done tongue-in-cheek! All the songs were fabulous and absolutely addictive, especially Character Deela and Dinka Chika. The rest of the cast were great in their respective roles but I think this movie sells by the sheer force of Salman Khan's name alone,
never mind his superb acting and charm! While I find this movie wasn't as great as DABANGG,which I think it's pretty hard to beat,it's still a very enjoyable and watchable movie and definitely worth adding to your collection. Some jokes could go over your head if you're not familiar with some past Bollywood movies or the Indian culture for that matter as I was with a particular scene, with Prem making reference to almond tea??? in context with his bride to his father - just couldn't get that one! Anyway, enjoy this movie with some tandoori chicken.....",1312588800,10,1053,4.759562841530054
4592518,4,B0056L5T9A,"Ok so this movie moved fast and there was a lot of dialogue and even as a fast reader, i had a hard time keeping up with the subtitles, so if like me you have to read the subtitles, just read the first time you watch this don't try to watch it too because you'll miss stuff!! THis was the first movie i'd seen with salman as a more cheesy comedy type role and even this type of bollywood genre film and  i wasn't sure if i liked it the first time partly due to i missed things bc i was trying to read and watch it and bc i wasn't sure if i was supposed to take it seriously or not. Now that i've seen more of these kind of films i'm used to the humour and can appreciate how good this film really is! The songs are amazing and will be stuck in your head from day one! This is an action rom com so if that's your thing enjoy!",1398902400,,824,3.7906976744186047
4592519,2,B0056L5T9A,Salman is a hottie but this film is not too good. Move on to some of his more recent films as this one will leave you asking what happened?,1392854400,,139,3.8275862068965516
4592520,3,B0056L5T9A,"Have to say I was disappointed with this movie. Salman Khan is OK - he plays pretty much the same character in every movie. The story was weak, but then I suppose you don't expect Shakespeare. Where I was really disappointed was the over-reliance on body humor. Pelvic thrusts, urination, guys taking their shirts off. C'mon - if it's really funny material you don't have to reach for that. The songs were surprisingly poor as well. What was mildly interesting was the filming technique - not sure how they did it, but the DVD rendition has a surprisingly 3D feel to it, even on a 2D LCD with no glasses. What saved the movie was Asin Thottumkal. Definitely want to see more of her.",1366329600,,682,4.508064516129032
4592521,5,B0056L5T9A,First I I saw this was without English subtitles - but I got it and still laughed out loud.  With subtitiles it's even better - a different Salman - funny.  Music was fab great dance scenes !  Worth seeing !,1353801600,,207,4.125
4592522,2,B0056L5T9A,"I am sorry I wasted my money on this crazy movie.

It had a good plot of the accidental couple, but all the craziness in between
was absolutely unnecessary and awful.  It was most of the movie, while a
good script could have been written for this love affair by accident.

I look at Indie movies because they are 'CLEAN,NO CURSING, NO SEX, NO DRUGS'
NO NUDITY,yet in this one....THERE WAS OPEN URINATION BY THE STAR
THAT WAS DISGUSTING,AND THEN THE KIDS, BOYS WITH NAKED BEHINDS SHOWING
AND urinating on people.

How disgusting.  I was shocked and could not believe that they would put this
in their movies.  If you are going to get Westernized and put this garbage
in your movies, I willl stop buying. I don't want this FILTH.

And the gansters, mob, fighting, killing....and dress very western style,no good.
Please don't go American, it's not good. Be who you are and dress your culture.
American don't have a culture anymore, it's just crazy junk, wild styles.

The class has left the shores of America.  No more class, morals, values,
principles in America.  Just trashy ways by all you see on TV.

Please.  Wheee.",1340409600,4,1119,4.653061224489796
4592523,5,B0056L5T9A,"PURCHASED "" MEDIA STORE 1234..FULFILLED BY AMAZON"" .NO PROBLEMS SO FAR. 4/16/2012

Entertaining... FAMILY FAIR 8-10 YEARS OLD OR OLDER. LIGHT AND FUNNY...EVENLY MATCHED CHARACTERS ....BRIDE TO BE IN WEDDING DRESS FLEEING FROM CEREMONY  WITH MAFIA STYLE FAMILY IN HOT PURSUIT ,PRETENDS SHE'S THE GIRL SALMAN CAME TO PICKUP AT THE AIRPORT TO GET AWAY FROM HER PURSUERS ....

 This is a fast paced ,outwit the enemy comedy ...trouble is who is your enemy..  The RUNAWAY Bride that was being forced to marry the mafia guy is wily and resourceful.  She overhears Salman at the airport saying that the woman from america that he has never seen before couldn't be what he needed because he needed a woman to be such and such. She utilizes that info to pretend to be his perfect marriage candidate. She yells his name and says her name is the one on the sign he's holding . She ask's where has he been, was he trying to ditch her and claim she wasn't there (what he was just planning to do ). HIS intended nasty tempered marriage candidate that was coming to visit for mutual inspection is still waiting at the airport .She came to India from the U.S. to attend a friends wedding and was going to inspect Salman as a side trip first. When no one shows up to meet her, she calls the house and the impostor answers and pretends it's a friend of hers and they can't possibly pick her up at the airport . This is a Bollywood believable entry theme for the set up of the swapped bride ... leaves plenty of time for the sparks to fly with the runaway brides character. The truth and attraction to be uncovered in some hilariously fun moments and just the right amount of fighting . Fun supporting cast with personality quirks. Good plot progression didn't seem slow or too long. The things he comes up with to get her out of her families clutches are witty, well written and entertaining.  Only seen about 6 Salman khan films so far but will be looking for some of his better stuff. I Like light hearted comedy and also action with a brain or mix of both and some light amount of slapstick...prefer sitcom. It had it and more.

The plot has already been written out in great detail by the other reviewers. As always watch and judge for yourself. I bought this one off amazon and it was worth it. Feel free to spend some money. No flaws in the copy and it ran without a hitch. I MADE SURE TO PLAY IT OVER AND OVER TO MAKE SURE THE COPY DIDN'T HAVE PROBLEMS  . MEDIA STORE 1234 Fulfilled By Amazon. First purchase from them. Pleased so far....",1334188800,2,2527,4.417204301075269

4592525,3,B0056L5T9A,"well i was dissapointed, expected a little more action and some super - funny scenes. they weren't there. well, in the first 30 minutes, the movie is a bummer, only picks after the pee break , that was gross by the way.",1320364800,,219,4.238095238095238
4592526,5,B0056L5T9A,"Ready is one of the films which takes your brain on a holiday and you still have fun without. Ready is a remake of a Teleugu film of the same name starring Ram and Genelia D'souza. This film is a vehicle for Salman Khan and his antics, and it is a both a tribute and testimony of his star power. The most preposterous things are executed randomly and you will love all of them.
The basic story is about how Salman rescues a girl from the clutches of her evil fianc's family and manages to reunite a family of warring don's. Ready has one of the catchiest soundtracks of the year, you will want to hear 'Dhinka Chika', 'Character Dheela' and 'Meri Adaa' again and again.
Don't listen to anyone of the critics; this is a film that you would love to watch again and again. 5 stars. 9/8/2011",1316304000,9,787,4.2885906040268456
4592527,4,B0056L5T9A,"This was Salam at his most ""sweet and charming"". The story was cute, but did get a little wild and out there for a minute! This was a movie for the family. Salam works really well with kids. He should write a movie where he is in charge of kids in some way. Heidi Klum would be a great co-star. Her show with kids is really funny!",1316217600,,330,3.9402985074626864

8459746,3,B0056L5T9A,I would rate this 4 stars except the subtitles lagged far behind the words so that in a conversation you had to work to figure out who said what. In fact in some instances whole conversations would start and end before the words appeared on the screen.,1494720000,,252,4.382978723404255
8459747,5,B0056L5T9A,This was a good movie. Salman  khan has the charisma that fit perfectly in the movie. He's  a fun actor that can play many roles.,1493164800,,129,4.12
8459748,5,B0056L5T9A,"THIS MOVIE WAS SO FUNNY!!!! Oh my goodness...the part when Salman Khan was dressed up in the skeleton outfit ""badman"" and he scares the bratty kid into being good. I love when the kid is getting ready to be bad again, and then he has this black and white flashback of the roller coaster going up and Salman in the skeleton suit swimming through the air...I laughed so hard the tears where rolling down my cheeks, we had to stop the movie for awhile so I could get a hold of myself! Still laughing while I type this, very funny movie!",1491177600,,533,4.287128712871287
8459749,3,B0056L5T9A,"Asin plays Sanjama, a woman escaping from a marriage to a mobster's son.  She pretends to be the guest that Prem (Salman Khan) and his family are expecting.  Prem and Sanjama fall in love, and Prem creates an elaborate con to get the mobsters to let him marry her.

This comedy starts off poorly, leaving the viewer wondering just what kind of movie it's going to be.  After about 30 minutes, Khan becomes his usual charming self and the movie becomes more enjoyable.  The songs weren't particularly good, and the choreography was just okay.  I wasn't impressed with the physical humor, either, though most of the script was funny.

Overall, this is an okay movie, with some good scenes. However, I wouldn't recommend it to be anyone's first Bollywood (or Khan) movie.",1489795200,,768,4.7727272727272725
8459750,4,B0056L5T9A,"Yes, enjoyable movie. There were a couple of places in the beginning where it was like 'too much, to act this way with a woman pretending to threaten her'. Hated that. But then it got past that and it was a cute story and was glad I saw it.",1474588800,,240,3.9183673469387754
