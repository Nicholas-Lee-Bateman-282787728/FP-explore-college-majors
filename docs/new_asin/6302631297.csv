7828442,4,6302631297,"This tape lasts thirty minutes and is not a complete episode. However, it is well worth purchasing. It is unfortunate that the complete episodes are not available. This is surprising given the length of time the show was broadcast.",1473465600,,231,4.948717948717949

7828445,5,6302631297,"YAY! Bring on The Captain! GREAT video-- and how cool that my kids LOVE the same show I did at their ages! Wish there were more, and on DVD!",1238630400,6,140,3.8620689655172415
7828446,5,6302631297,"This video shows Captain Kangaroo going to different places and being placed in some interesting situations, including interacting with groups of kids and riding in a boat with a live Bengal Tiger!  Mr Moose and Bunny Rabbit are on hand, and the Captain cures their boredom.  Its fun for kids, and for the (very) young at heart.  I also love the fact that this video (and others in the series) keeps the memory of Captain Kangaroo [and the gentle genius Bob Keeshan who played the role to perfection] alive for one more generation. Too bad there are not more videos (or DVDs) of Captain Kangaroo!",1081036800,14,596,4.6571428571428575
