8745439,5,B019KDX7UM,"Hibito prepares for a test that will qualify him to return to active duty, while Mutta prepares for the possibility of being chosen for a moon mission!

This is it. The end. The last set containing the last episode. *cries*. Happily this is not the end of Hibito and Mutta's adventures! Sadly, in order to follow along with them, you will need to read the manga. The anime is over and there are currently no plans to continue (though we can always hope). The anime stops in sort of an odd spot, though thankfully without a cliffhanger or anything evil. I just wish they could have squeezed out another set or two or three and finished up the story properly.

This set contains episodes 88-99 (12 episodes) out 99 total, bringing our journey to a close!",1459814400,3,752,4.522058823529412
