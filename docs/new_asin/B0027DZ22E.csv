3866606,4,B0027DZ22E,"This biography was well written and the story, although well known, added some new faces to the dimension (interviews with her stand-in and other ""child"" actors).

3866608,3,B0027DZ22E,"There was no interview with Shirley Temple, only different former child actors who really didn't seem to know her all that well.  I would have preferred more clips.",1377216000,,164,4.857142857142857

3866625,4,B0027DZ22E,"There is no question that Shirley Temple was the most popular child actor of her time--and as far as I know, of all time. Her poise, her charm, her skills, bridge the distance between the 1930s and our times effortlessly, fluidly. A little girl with her sparkle would be as popular today as Shirley was during the Great Depression. Unlike most child actors, she managed a fairly successful transition to a life as an adult. She died of COPD in 1914, a consequence of the little known fact that she was a heavy smoker most of her life. The world still waits for another Shirley Temple, to charm us with her innocence and brilliance. 4 stars",1481500800,2,639,4.517241379310345

3866655,5,B0027DZ22E,"If you are a fan of Shirley Temple, or even watched a few of her films and liked them, then you will enjoy watching this. This documentary is pretty interesting and Shirley Temple herself, was a very talented actress. For me, everything in this documentary was new information to me, since I am not big on wanting to know of celebrity information/gossip. But this was well worth watching.

My mother was a fan of Shirley Temple and soon I became one as well. Her #1 Favorite was Heidi and The Little Princess followed. Those were the first two I knew of only to find out years later down the road she had so many more. I didn't spend a lot of time watching TV or keeping up with the stars of Hollywood, but if we had a family night or just a girls night with my mom, Shirley Temple movies were one of the top picks. My Mother soon collected more of her movies as the years went on. Though the two movies I stated above had been my prime favorites I soon fell in love with The Blue Bird. I kind of find it sad, that stated in the documentary, not as many people liked it. But to each their own. It was sad to hear when she had passed but sadly that is life. It is nice to know a little more about her especially now since I own my mothers VHS collection of Shirley Temple movies, after my mom passed away in 2015. I will have memories to cherish which each film I use to watch with my mother.",1473120000,2,1391,4.113970588235294
3866656,5,B0027DZ22E,"Shirley Temple entertained fans from different generations and was a multi-talented child star. Her story as an adult as an ambassador to
two countries was just as remarkable. It is extraordinary when you see the scandal and drug abuse among the survivors of a Hollywood
childhood in most modern times. Apparently, she was well protected and leaving for a private education in the teen years helped her to
survive. Leaving the environment of the show world and marrying her second husband helped her mature. She took the upbringing of her
three children out of the spotlight with seriousness
She was an adorable child and an exceptional adult.",1464739200,2,643,5.018691588785047

3866663,5,B0027DZ22E,"I have always loved Shirley Temple movies. She was simply an adorable and talented child actress who would tug at one's heartstrings no matter what the role. So, I looked forward to this overview of her life.

Tommy Tunes does the introduction, and this collection takes the viewer on a journey down memory lane. There are snippets of her films, as well as interviews with other child and adult actors and actresses who starred with her in these films and reflect on their interactions with Shirley . These reminiscences are interesting and often insightful. This collection also shows her transition from child actress to a confident and intelligent young woman who would go on to be a successful wife, mother, and diplomat in service to her country.

If you are a Shirley Temple fan, you will love this review of her life. If you are not a fan, you will soon be one!",1463616000,,868,4.666666666666667
