5878768,5,B00DYC63B6,Bill's Mountian is a profound and moving experience. A must see. I highly recommend it. I first saw it shortly after Dyanne finished it and I'm so happy to be able to do something for Bill. Dyanne has created an amazing piece of work and a labor of love and caring.,1374105600,,265,4.215686274509804
5878769,5,B00DYC63B6,This is a heartfelt and original film. Truly special. It shows a slice of life that has not often been presented.,1374019200,2,113,4.428571428571429
5878770,5,B00DYC63B6,I teach the Documentary Studies class at UNLV and I saw this documentary at the Singapore International Film Festival and immediately added it to the list of docs I screen for my students.  It was 12-years in the making and offers an insightful and humorous view of a local Laurel Canyon resident as he keeps the neighborhood together as everyone's gardner and handyman. Filmmaker Dyanne Asimow handles her material with keen intelligence and sensitivity which makes for a unique presentation of a rare and gentle soul.,1373846400,2,519,5.034883720930233

8599133,5,B00DYC63B6,"A good documentary takes us deep beneath the surface. In the case of Bill's Mountain, the surface is the neighbor from hell.  Bill Jackson owns a home in the lovely Laurel Canyon area of Los Angeles.  He collects massive amounts of combustible junk.  His driveway is littered with filthy old cars.  He shows up in your yard or your house at all hours of the day or night.  He cares for flocks of cats. He looks, talks, dresses and eats weird.  In fact, he's kind of frightening.  Beneath the surface, though, Bill is a kind and caring man who lives only to help his neighbors and save the lives of insects.  He cares tenderly for the father who threw him out to survive on the street when he was eight years old.  And many of his neighbors think Bill is a saint.  They write to the court asking for mercy when Bill is busted for failing to register his car.  They clean out his junk so the city won't have to.  It's an inspiring story of a community that embraces this sad and downtrodden man and appreciates the value lurking within.",1378080000,,1034,4.356020942408377
8599134,5,B00DYC63B6,"It's crazy! Anyone who's seen the R. Crumb doc (""Crumb"" 1994) will immediately relate. From a totally dysfunctional family on steroids who throw Bill away as human flotsam, to this humorous and endearing man who reinvents meaning in his life and ours. We are seductively sucked into the movie. It's a tribute to the surviving man. And equally it's a tribute to his sensitive videographer and spirited investigator -- Ms asimow! I'm all thumbs up.

8599135,5,B00DYC63B6,"Getting to know Bill through the sensitive lens of Dyanne's camera, reminds me that stray people have had multifaceted lives;  they didn't just ""appear"" today.  Dyanne also captured the candor of Bill's neighbors in their plight to help him.  Not only is this the story of Bill, it is a tribute to Dyanne and the the others on Bill's Mountain.",1376179200,,343,4.683333333333334
8599136,5,B00DYC63B6,Captures the true life story of one individual that surely represents many. Disturbing as it reveals what commonly occurs with parents that don't love their children in conventional ways. This film superbly documents what happens when we are not loved as a child and then seek love throughout our lives in often very destructive ways.,1375488000,,334,5.090909090909091
8599137,5,B00DYC63B6,"Scratch the surface and find a treasure underneath.  That's precisely what Dyanne Asimow has done in her patient, touching documentary about her neighborhood handyman.  The documentary accomplishes what other marvelous docs have done before--show us the human treasure we initially view - or profile - as dross.  Beautifully done.",1375315200,,330,5.6938775510204085
8599138,5,B00DYC63B6,Dyanne's documentary takes the viewer from fear and disgust to genuine appreciation of the soul of Bill.  She beautifully and unexpectedly peels away the layers of this genuinely worthy human being and cinematically takes our hands and leads us to our better selves.  This film is a must see for anyone who has judged the homeless guy we try to ignore in the street.,1374969600,,366,4.703125
8599139,5,B00DYC63B6,"Watching ""Bill's Mountain"" for the first time, I found myself transfixed. Maybe it's because I've never met anyone like Bill. He is utterly unique, and this film gives viewers an intimate look into his world in all its idiosyncrasy. From an artistic point of view, the filmmaking is simply superb. Told in non-linear fashion, ""Bill's Mountain"" unfolds in a way that feels both artful and organic. Though this is an unsentimental, realistic portrait of a complex and difficult person, Asimow's obvious affection for her subject bleeds through. What the viewer takes away is a sense of Bill's humanity and, in a larger sense, an affirmation of the many ways we are all connected.",1374451200,,677,5.0
8599140,5,B00DYC63B6,"This is an astonishing and moving film, a brilliant portrait that reminds us how precious each life is.  Bill shows us, by his very existence and his undefeated heart, the true value of what we sometimes throw away.",1374364800,,215,4.657894736842105
8599141,5,B00DYC63B6,This is a beautiful and heartfelt film that slowly works it's magic on you.  The film asks a serious of gentle questions from the viewer as it draws you deeper into the world of Bill and the canyons. Highly recommended.,1374192000,,219,4.475
