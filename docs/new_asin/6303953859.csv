7858901,1,6303953859,This movie is probably one of the worst movies that I have seen by Bruce Le. The plot seems as if it was wriiten by children. If you like a Bruce Lee impersonator who does nothing but over do it in a movie then this is for  you. I like watching and laughing at the funny face gestures.,945561600,3,285,3.913793103448276
