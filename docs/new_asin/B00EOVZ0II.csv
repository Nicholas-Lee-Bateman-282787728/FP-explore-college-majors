5931933,3,B00EOVZ0II,"It is not what I expected, and the funny not really good. The story line I don,t like, the fights are fairly ok I wish the story will be more direct",1393545600,,148,3.806451612903226
5931934,4,B00EOVZ0II,"This movie was hilarious, I really enjoyed watching it-I laughed all the way through the movie. All the actors and actresses did a good job.",1393286400,2,140,4.64
5931935,2,B00EOVZ0II,"The trailer and the synopsis on the box make this movie sound like a action packed cop thriller, but it's actually a comedy, and a really goofy one at that. The humor is extremely broad, slapsticky and cartoonish. You know that sound effect in scooby-doo cartoons when a character is going to run, and their legs are moving for a few seconds and it sounds like bongo drums before they actually take off and it sounds like a ricochet? Yeah, this movie actually uses that exact thing. The funniest gags in the movie will only be funny to you if you're very familiar with Chinese cinema. There are several references (mostly to Jet Li's earlier work), and puns (which don't really translate well, because they're only puns in Mandarin). The action is ok, but far too CGI heavy and, again, slapsticky. Overall, the movie is not TERRIBLE, I guess, but I certainly felt mislead. Several sources refer to it as a thriller, the descriptions on Amazon, wikipedia, and the actual packaging itself all paint this movie as something it absolutely isn't. I'd say it'd be worth pulling out of the $5 bin at walmart or something, but not worth the 15 buck I blew on it.",1392595200,,1154,4.606796116504855
5931936,1,B00EOVZ0II,"This movie was not in English and no subtitles were provided so you could follow the movie.  Watched 10 minutes then turned it off.

I do not recommend this movie at all.",1392163200,,170,4.28125
5931937,1,B00EOVZ0II,"looks like a serious movie from the front cover, turned out to be to much comedy for me,wasn't to happy",1392163200,,103,4.2
5931938,5,B00EOVZ0II,I like to order starring Jet Li. Jet Li is my favorite actor. I enjoy to watch movie with my hubby,1391385600,,98,3.7142857142857144
5931939,4,B00EOVZ0II,"It appears China has entered the comedy spoof genre with two cops named Wang and Huang, whose English meaning they appear to be aware. The cops are after the smiley face murderer. Huang (Jet Li) is the seasoned policeman while Wang (Zhang Wen) is the rookie. The comedy was all over the place. Some of the comedy was slapstick; sometimes cartoon noises; sometime it was ""Airplane"" style humor: sometime it was movie spoof. They are capable at laughing at themselves by creating overt anti-gravity fighting. In one scene they come to congratulate the officers for arresting someone who pirated a movie, a serious crime in China, he said with a wink and then flashes an MIB style camera.

Too much of the film is silliness that didn't translate well into western humor. I thought it was a good effort on the part of Chinese film makers and a step in the right direction. 3 1/2 stars.",1390089600,2,881,4.647435897435898
5931940,2,B00EOVZ0II,"Goofy Hong Kong action comedy about police investigating a series of strange murders, men who were all ex-boyfriends of the same actress and who all died in seemingly accidental ways where the police can't figure out how the men were killed.  This is extremely silly along the lines of early Stephen Chiau or Jackie Chan's Wong Jing movie City Hunter.  The fight scenes, strangely, seem to be heavily influenced by Scott Pilgrim Vs the World--characters hover or spin in mid-air like they are inhabiting a video game or cartoon rather than the real world.  Jet Li isn't really known for his comedy chops so he has very little to do in this other than a couple of action scenes.  This type of comedy appealed to me more when I was younger and first got into Hong Kong films--now it just seems a lot more silly than funny but if you like very broad Hong Kong comedies you might enjoy this.  Jet Li fans looking for an action film should stay far, far away.",1389571200,6,954,4.491329479768786
5931941,1,B00EOVZ0II,LOOKS LIKE IT WAS MADE IN THE 1970S. CHEAP PRODUCTION AND REALLY BAD SOUND. ALMOST LOOKS LIKE A REPACKAGED MOVIE EXCEPT JET LI IS ALITTLE OLDER,1388880000,3,143,4.538461538461538

5931952,2,B00EOVZ0II,"Dont expect something like Fearless simply because this movie has Jet Li as a star. Just about 80 percent of Badges of Fury (Bu er shen tanis) a comedy with lots of slapstick and references to Hong Kong films. Jet Li plays an eccentric police officer Huang Feihong  silly joke on Wong Fei-Hung, the character he played in the Once Upon a Time in China series.

Unfortunately Lis role is smaller than you expect, with only a few unmemorable (and too brief) action sequences, and worse, the jokes are not very funny. The film is actually about Zhang Wens character, a young bumbling police officer Wang Bu'er, who starts investigating Smiling Murder cases, to discover strange connections between victims and beautiful sisters.

Despite the impressive cast and cameo appearances including Collin Chou and Wu Jing, the story is too weak and boring. You don't get much action either, and most of the stunts are ruined by overused special effects. Leung Siu-lung (villain of Kung Fu Hustle) is wasted.",1420675200,,996,4.916666666666667

5931957,1,B00EOVZ0II,"I wish I could give this film ZERO stars! What was Jet Li thinking? I expect so much more from him and his films.
The acting is horrible, the comedy wouldn't entertain an 8 year old, and the fight scenes are far and few between.
I wish I could return this DVD and get my money back. It took me 4 sittings just to get through this garbage!
Save your money and save your time!
DON'T buy this DVD!

5931962,2,B00EOVZ0II,"Comedy is not Jet Li's strong suit. I couldn't get into this movie that much, and for me it was a one time watch film. Jet Li, while had good fights, I couldn't help but give props to the stuntmen that made him shine. The two, well three most memorable moments in the movie where Wang daydreaming about beating up the old school Shaw Bros characters like Leung Kar Yan and Hark On Fung, Jackie Wu reveiling that he was an insurance agent after his fight with Jet Li, and the infamous reenacting of the Once Upon A Time In China fight scene using the ladders. Other than that, this movie lacked any type of second time watch. Stick to what you know Jet, this doesn't suit you.",1404172800,,675,4.28125

5931964,3,B00EOVZ0II,"This movie would have been better if it had been directed by stephen chow because it was his type of movie. However this doesn't mean this is a bad movie or not worth watching it is. I just feel jet li's talent is wasted in this movie. or maybe he's ready to retire,or slow down like jackie has.",1402272000,,295,4.103448275862069

5931966,4,B00EOVZ0II,I understand some of the reviews saying this isn't your typical Jet Li movie but that's ok. It is still a fun movie to watch.,1400803200,,125,4.04
5931967,5,B00EOVZ0II,"Not sure why so many bad reviews, this was one great funny movie.  Yes, the trailer makes it look like another typical jet li martial arts film, but it is anything but a typical jet li film.  And that is half the fun, the action is a more over the top, but still well done and innovative.  For a person who's never done kung fu, the actor who played the young cop did a good job.  The story plot is easy to follow, but i seriously doubt that you would be able to guess the bad guy(s) before the movie is 80% over.  The girls are cute and play there roles nicely for a foreign film (do not expect them to be like american female comedians).  Yes, the dialog may be a little corny, but again, this is not an american film, you should know what you are going to get.  If you want a good laugh, while still getting a lot of martial arts action ... this one is for you.",1398038400,3,864,3.988372093023256

5931969,2,B00EOVZ0II,"I am a huge Jet Li fan and like when he does comedy as much as dram, BUT I could not get into this movie. The stylized action was great, but the story plodded along like a lame horse. BORING. Really unfortunate.",1394755200,,211,4.0476190476190474
5931970,2,B00EOVZ0II,"I expected an action movie, especially with Jet Li in the cast. What it is is a movie with some action in it (not so well staged) and some pretty silly comedy.",1394755200,,159,4.0
5931971,3,B00EOVZ0II,It was ok. Jet li not at his best but the fight scenes were good. Kinda funny and reminds me of kung fu hustle.,1394150400,,111,3.6666666666666665
8607659,1,B00EOVZ0II,"1.3 out of 5.0...The description is wrong! It's a cheesy comedy FIRSTLY, complete with 'cartoon-like' sound effects. I thought I was renting a straight up Jet Li action film. It's a comedy (a poor one) wrapped in a floppy 'cop drama.' Action? Loads of high flying wire work and superhuman agility based fighting. But not in a realistic (relative term) way like 'Kiss of The Dragon' or even 'Romeo Must Die' was... it's more akin to Loony Tunes, No BS. Obnoxious cartoon and slapstick sound effects; I found it to be a waste of time being that I wanted a gritty Jet Li Hong Kong cop movie. It's a comedy, if you can call it that.",1525132800,,628,4.422413793103448
8607660,5,B00EOVZ0II,I bought this because no one thought Jet li had a girl. Almost like he was just making it up. Well... he wasn't.,1517961600,,112,3.9130434782608696
8607661,3,B00EOVZ0II,A few entertaining fight scenes (one of the best fights featured some old school martial arts stars from the 80s but didn't feature Jet Li). A fun movie if your'e looking for light hearted action comedy but pass up if you want the hardcore martial arts that Jet Li is known for.,1492646400,,278,4.365384615384615

8607668,1,B00EOVZ0II,"This is the first Jet Li movie that I couldn't finish watching. I love you Jet Li, but this movie is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. But then again I didn't see too much of it because I turned it off. I just couldn't stand watching it. Maybe it's funny for Chinese people in China, but for me the humor was like something a 3 year old who doesn't understand humor yet would think is funny. And the action is mostly people suspended from the air for prolonged periods of time. The movie is choppy and not put together well. There's just nothing positive I can say about this.",1448582400,,582,4.205357142857143
