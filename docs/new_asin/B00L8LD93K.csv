6474354,5,B00L8LD93K,"Here we will see the release of Hawaii 5-0 Season Five on DVD.  But, I have already learned that it will be available in Japan on Blu-Ray, sometime in December. So, to me, it'll be worth the wait.

Here's the Amazon link from Japan.

My wife and I love the show, but we just don't have the time to catch it on television. And we certainly don't want to waste our money on the more inferior DVD release. I got Season Four on Blu-Ray from Germany earlier this year.  So, who knows, maybe Germany will release it on Blu-Ray again too.

Oh, and yes, both the German and the Japanese releases are region free.

UPDATE AGAIN: This Season Five on Blu-Ray will be made available from Germany in April 0f 2016 for about $40.
I've just placed my order.",1440288000,10,896,5.357142857142857
6474355,3,B00L8LD93K,"I have a couple of problems with this:
1. I don't like how the dynamic has been altered with Grover (or, as I like to call him, Mr. Flop Sweat).  I'd be fine if he were an occasional or semi-regular character.  When he was with SWAT he and Steve were sometimes at odds, but they respected each other.  They could agree to disagree, but now he's been neutered because Steve's his boss and now he's just a cuddly teddy-bear type--as if we don't have enough of those.
2. I understand what the producers are doing: they're developing the theme of family, but it's just getting to be too much.  Five-O works best when it's the tight bond among these 4 original characters.  They're ohana, but this constant adding of cast members is tiresome.  They have PROFOUND chemistry among the 4 leads.  Everyone else should just be supplemental.
3. I think that Kono and Chin are somewhat underused.  Even still, they are often relegated to sources of information.  Chin is a lieutenant, but he's still relegated to just getting info--even though he outranks Danny.  It's a waste of a wonderful character--and actor.  Daniel Dae Kim has serious chops and although he has performed the thankless task of making someone as good as Chin interesting--and done so with real originality--it would be interesting to see him come to grips with his dark side.  After all, his wife was murdered, he's been the constant target of official harassment by the powers that be in the HPD; that should realistically cast him adrift for awhile until he found his way back to the good man that he is.
4. However, it's the misuse of Kono that's almost criminal.  I understand that she's the junior member of the team, but her life outside of work could be so much more than being Adam's love interest.  Grace Park's Kono is a beautiful human being.  I'm not referring to her appearance (yes, she's gorgeous), but rather her soul.  This season we did get 1 episode where we see more of her spiritual side and character.  However, there are many more opportunities than the producers have explored.  I love the dichotomy of her being so spiritual and centered--an yet so deadly.  Having her as the team sniper makes perfect sense because she literally has the power of life and death that she can summon so easily.  It's a credit to Grace Park's acting and charisma that she can make these two seemingly incongruous characteristics work so well in one character.
5. Hawaii Five-O probably has the best action sequences on network television.  The stunt work is amazing and those gun battles are really well-done.  It's exciting.  However, sometimes it's like the sound and fury from Macbeth--it signifies nothing.  By that, I mean that it covers up some really dumb plots.  I'm so sick of the twist on the twist and these Rube-Goldberg plans that the super villains enact in that they seem to be able to predict everything that the police, etc. will do.  A corollary to that is, ""the plot to deliberately get caught so that we can enact our real plans.""  That horse may not be dead, but it's on life support and the HMO won't pay for any more treatment.  The joy of this show is the character interaction among the main cast, the stunning scenery (including all of the beautiful beach bodies) and the action.  Sometimes a twisty plot is fun, but damn, give it a break some time.  There have been a couple of times in which the crime has been resolved quickly and the denouement has been extended.  Those are some of my favorite moments because they're character driven.  I'm just saying a little more balance would be in order.
6. I think that Scott Caan has elevated Danny Williams above the store-bought Jersey attitude with which he was saddled in the first two seasons.  His character's evolution has been handled as well and Caan gives Danny a heart and vulnerability that speaks to his abilities as an actor, too.  I'd like to see a bit more of this, maybe with Chin and Danny having a case that features their dynamic.  What's interesting is that Chin and Danny have had a couple of rough moments, but that's it.
7. Steve McGarret is of course the leader of the team and the show's quarterback and Alex O does a fine job, too.  That's one thing that is utterly solid in this show: all of the leads are very talented actors.  McGarret could have been a one-dimensional, self-absorbed a$$hole like Jack Lord's interpretation, but in this iteration, everyone gets to shine and the leading actor seems to be very comfortable with this.  It's hard to make a hero interesting--especially over 5 seasons of network TV--but O'Loughlin keeps giving us fresh facets.  Maybe now we'll get to see him be interested in something else besides that baroque Wo-Fat subplot.  One thing I didn't like was how he was portrayed in the first couple of seasons; he was often the butt of idiotic jokes.  How is it that a Navy SEAL who trains religiously and is constantly in combat situations has trouble taking down middle-aged drug dealers in a foot chase?  How could he have been so easily defeated in MMA?  I know that worthy adversaries are interesting, but that doesn't mean that they necessarily have to pose a physical threat.  One thing I think they did right was the car jacking scene when McGarrett was on a date with Catherine.
8. It's kind of a slap in the face to American fans that we can't get the Blu-ray versions of the show any more.  We are either stuck with the DVDs--which is a shame, given the cinematography--or we have to order them from Germany, which is expensive.  Honestly, it's primarily for that reason that I won't be buying any season past 3.",1437091200,14,5622,4.650455927051672
6474356,4,B00L8LD93K,Good action - good plot,1436832000,4,23,3.8
6474357,4,B00L8LD93K,"""Hawaii Five-O"" takes on its fifth season with 25 action-packed episodes on and off the Hawaiian Islands. The returning core cast gets a full time addition in Jorge Garcia as Jerry Ortega. The show's basic case of the week premise gets boosted by some longer story arcs, including one in which Danny gets a very unfortunate trip to Columbia courtesy of his brother, the effects of which will last several episodes.  McGarrett has a long-awaited final confrontation with Wo Fat.  Kono will get a marriage proposal and, maybe, a wedding, if she can keep the expected guests alive long enough to get them there.  Chin gets enmeshed in yet another Internal Affairs tangle.  There's plenty of action, along with the tangled storylines fans have come to expect, and who would want to miss the priceless interaction between McGarrett and Captain Lou Grover (Chi McBride), two law men who just don't see eye-to-eye.

This reviewer really enjoyed a couple of the late season episodes.  In one, Kono is stranded at sea and must rely on survival skills taught her by her mother.  In another, preparations for Kono's wedding are interrupted by the frantic search for a missing tactical nuclear weapon.  Anyway, it's all good fun, and recommended to fans of the series.",1436745600,12,1256,4.919431279620853

6474392,5,B00L8LD93K,"This excellent remake of the original CBS crime drama ""Hawaii Five-O"" features Alex O'Loughlin as Commander Steve McGarrett, the head of the Hawaiian State Police Special Task Force known as Hawaii Five-O, along with Scott Caan portraying his loyal sidekick, Detective Danny Williams. This fourth season of ""Hawaii Five-O"" continues its depiction of the exploits of Commander Steve McGarrett, Detective Danny Williams, and the other members of the Special Task Force, as they valiantly battle the criminal element in the state of Hawaii. ""Hawaii Five-O"" is characterized by superb writing, acting, and development of its story lines, and the various crime capers are interesting and engaging. In addition, the beautiful Hawaiian scenery is absolutely spectacular. There is a strong camaraderie among the members of the Hawaii Five-O Special Task Force, and the conclusion of each episode with a team dinner on the beach serves to highlight their dedication to the overall mission, and to each other. This remake of ""Hawaii Five-O"" is a supremely entertaining crime drama, and I enthusiastically give it a five-star rating, along with my highest recommendation.",1485993600,,1160,5.45

6474395,5,B00L8LD93K,"You probably know by now, that the Blu-ray versions of ""Hawaii Five-O"" (since season 4) are not sold in the U.S. Go figure, an American produced show, mostly American cast, American setting, does not make the excellent Blu-ray format available to American consumers. Why it is, however, sold in places like Germany and Japan is quite puzzling and frustrating. Like, really, how large a Blu-ray market could the German-speaking population possibly be?

Anyway, I recently (December 2016) ordered season 5 from Amazon's German site (Amazon.de.  You use the same password, same payment information as on Amazon's U.S. site) for around $26, including shipping--it takes about 10 days to arrive. You have to be patient and wait for about a year for the price to drop to this level. The Blu-ray video and audio is excellent, as expected.  Best of all, the discs are region-free, so they will play on your U.S.-sold Blu-ray player.  Also, there are no forced subtitles. There is a language selection that you make upon inserting the disc. Choose ""English"", and everything is presented in English, no trace of German. The only place the German language appears is on the cover art of the Blu-ray disc. Any writing on the discs themselves are also only in English (no bilingual). A slipcover that fits over a slightly larger Blu-ray case was included.",1484179200,,1342,4.977678571428571

Although season 1 to 4 included the Spanish subtitle option someone on CBS thought that it will be a great idea to not include the Spanish subtitles (incredible that, however, they did include Portuguese subtitles when the population spanish speakers certainly is larger. Big mistery for me.)

They did the same thing with the fifth season of Blue Bloods DVD so it is very likely they will do the same on the sixth season DVDs for both shows.

Apparently, there more to say! Now that we've gotten into this season a little bit, I have to take one star of, because when the characters are speaking, it's very quiet in comparison to the music and action sequences! This means the music and action volume is just right and then they speaking is too quiet, or the soaking I'd just right and then your eardrums get assaulted with the music/action!

However, this season seemed to have watered much of this down. The addition of Lou Grover and Jerry, while 2 strong characters, seemed to be at the expense of the others. I felt Chin, Kono and Danny were under used.  Maybe the actors wanted it that way; maybe they wanted more time off the set to do other things  I know Scott Caan has other projects on the go  but, unfortunately, this made for a weaker season  and that is a real shame.  There is talk that Season 6 will be the last and I think that is partially due to this disruption to the chemistry the main four characters bring to the table.

6474503,5,B00L8LD93K,"A copy of this title was provided for review purposes.

Ive talked before about how many shows these days have become strong ensemble pieces, probably more so than at any time in television history. Now please understand, Im not saying that shows in the past didn't have a huge cast line up but that shows now tend to feature all cast members almost equally and have them relate to one another closer than before. HAWAII FIVE-O is a perfect example of this. Each member tends to have a storyline that runs through the entire series. In addition to that, the entire groups works as an extended family in many parts due to tragedies of the past that left each of them without someone. And here, that works for the better.

If youve not seen the show (its always best to start from the beginning) then here is the summation I use with each season. Steve McGarrett (Alex OLoughlin) is an ex-SEAL who now heads a special task force that answers only to the Governor in Hawaii. He continues his search into both the murder of his father and the disappearance of his mother (who we found out worked for the CIA in an earlier season). His sidekick is Danny Danno Williams (Scott Caan), a transplanted New Jersian who lives on the island with his daughter. Rounding out the initial team were Chin Ho Kelly (Daniel Dae Kim), a police officer wrongly accused of corruption and his cousin, new police academy graduate Kono Kalakaua (Grace Park).

There have been additions to this extended family that included Catherine Rollins (Michelle Borth) who was a romantic interest and naval officer involved with McGarrett but who left the series this season. The hole created by her leaving left an opening to include two new regulars. Lou Grover (Chi McBride), an ex S.W.A.T. team leader that the force let go in a previous season and Jerry Ortega (Jorge Garcia), a computer and research whiz who also happens to be a conspiracy fan. Both of these characters have been in the series off and on but this year they became full time members.

As I said earlier, all of these characters have been given storylines that took the entire team through the wringer in one way or another. This season Grover had a situation where a friend from his past come to the island with his girlfriend only to have her die an accidental deathor was it an accident? Discovering whether or not his friend could have come to where he lives to commit a murder made for an interesting show.

Jerry had his own hands full in several episodes that led to the discovery of a counterfeiting ring. Suspicious from the start he is unable to convince the team that an actual crime is being committed. Working on his own he ends up captured by the counterfeiters and the team must come to his rescue.

The longest running arc in this season involved Danny and his brother, a con man who stole money from Columbian drug lord, Marco Reyes. Holding his brother captive, Reyes demands that Danny return the missing money or lose his brother. The arc ran through several episodes resulting in both one taking place in Columbia as the situation came to a head and a second in which McGarrett and Danny were facing criminal charges for what occurred in Columbia. This arc was fantastic combining two of the things that make this series what it is, a high quality of familial emotion and blistering action that had you gripping the edge of your seat. Thats rare in a television series.

Through all of these episodes you witness the bonding that takes place between the characters. Whether its a hair raising scene that involves watching one anothers backs or the comedic verbal sparring that takes place every time McGarrett and Danny get into a car and drive somewhere (one of my favorite parts of the show), you know that these characters have a deep rooted love for one another. It may not be the Robertson family sitting down to pray with each other at the end of every episode but the care and safety that these characters place in one another makes this a series that is worth watching from season one on.",1443484800,2,4054,4.622222222222222

I felt like it got back to the spirit and form of the original show. I also feel like the series has taken a similar quality track. The original (in my opinion) started getting really good with season 4 and the new started getting good with season 3. For the fans of the new who haven't seen any of the original I highly suggest that you do in order to truly understand what makes the show so darn good. The original was the longest running of its kind until Law & Order overtook it. You can really tell that Alex studied Jack quite closely.",1442448000,,667,4.099236641221374

6474518,4,B00L8LD93K,"Season 5 of the show really follows the same formula as the prior seasons.  It is mainly a serialized case of the week show, that has elements from the larger story arcs intertwined throughout the season.  This season, of course, has the 100th episode of the series, that marks a big confrontation between Steve and Wo-Fat, and we finally get the entire story of their connection.

The rest of the season instead of concentrating on one long arc, develops more of the various character's back stories (or revisits older story lines), and sets up things for the 6th season of the show.  This includes a story involving Grover's old partner the death of his old partner's wife.  Joe White also returns for a couple episodes and ends up providing Steve with information on his mother, who is now off the grid, and the story involving Danny's brother comes up again.  There is also an episode that is a clear take off on The Hangover movies, which is quite entertaining.

To the extent that the season has a main bad guy, it is clearly Gabriel, who appears multiple times throughout the season to wreak havoc, mainly for Chin.  Toward the end of the season they start planning Adam and Kono's wedding.  As you can expect things do not go entirely smoothly and the season finale involves a bomb threat that the team has to deal with.

For those who get the DVDs, the extras are pretty similar to those in prior seasons.  There is a gag reel, deleted scenes and the main featurette is on the 100th episode of the show.  Okay for what is there.  There is, again, no blu-ray release, and the work into the A/V quality of the DVDs seem to be getting worse over the course of time.  It is unfortunately, just one of the shows that the studios do not see blu-ray as being a profitable format for, so it just gets a pretty lack luster DVD release.  That is what knocks the set down a star for me, because while I still find the show enjoyable, and do not think it has become stale at this point, the great blu-ray releases that the first few seasons got do not seem to be in the cards for any of the other seasons.",1442188800,6,2102,4.409326424870466

6474528,5,B00L8LD93K,"The O-Hana experience continues with Season Five.

Admittedly I remain partial to Season Four, having been an extra in its Halloween themed episode and I am not sure how the excellent Pearl Harbor episode could ever be topped, but Season Five continues to meet the high bar that had been set.

A key to the continuing success of the current Hawaii Five-0 is its included character development emphasizing the principles of O-Hana, or family. I believe it really starts with the way the show is produced and the way its producers, crew and actors themselves work together as a family in bringing the show to us.

As I mentioned in my review of Season Four in relating my own experience as a ""Costumed Party Guest with Upscale Car"" and my part exiting the Party Bus and being background at the Mansion Halloween Party, I also ended up interacting with actors Scott Caan (Danno) and Alex O'laughlin (McGarrett) on the Party Bus.  In the review I noted, ""The courtesy and respect that the two principal actors showed to those of us who were fans/extras remains memorable.  Likewise the crew, beginning with costuming and continuing all the way to shooting, treated us well and made us feel like an integral part of the show.""

A special treat in the Fifth Season Hawaii Five-0 DVD set is the feature titled ""Five-0 x 100"" which expands upon the 100th Episode that aired during the season.  Then too there are the deleted scenes, commentaries on selected episodes, and my favorite, the Gag Reel.

I am pleased to see the ""O-Hana"" emphasis continues into the present season as an upcoming episode has the H50 Task Force team enjoying a friendly competition dressed in their mud bath stained tops emblazoned with the words, ""Five-Hana.""",1441324800,,1729,4.797979797979798
6474529,3,B00L8LD93K,"The show is still going strong after five seasons, which is a testament to the cast and crew, as so many shows fail within two to three seasons. I would rate this seasons DVD release if not for two things: 1 - No blu ray release. 2 - The episode with Wo Fat is duplicated on the disc I received, so the episode after it is not on the DVD. Hopefully this is something that can be resolved soon. I would appreciate it if anyone who is also experiencing this would reply to this message.",1441238400,,484,4.105263157894737
