7507042,5,B017JGSUBI,"This is one of the best movies of its kind. Starting at the foundation of a movie and moving upward, the production values are of the highest caliber in exterior and interior settings, in details of costume and decor, in the realism of the world the story occupies; and the story, typical of this genre, is an intentionally complicated story of betrayals of friendship and tensions within a dysfunctional family, and unbelievably all the central characters turn out to be lost members of the same nuclear family; the director does a masterful job of both concealing and revealing plot elements, and at the end ties everything together with the skill Shakespeare displayed in ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL; The acting is very convincing with the young actress at the story's center, maturing from a careless teenager to an avenging angel capable of awesome acts of violence to redress ancient wrongs, and then at the very end confronting the futility of her deeds and staring into an abyss that the movie does not try to resolve; yes, the ending is downbeat, but this is an epic drama and the tragic loss embedded in every such story of the fate of a nation is honestly handled by the production and I felt catharsis and justice served at the end.  And much of the movie is much more fun than my emphasis on craft and genre indicates.",1473033600,4,1329,4.67948717948718

7507045,4,B017JGSUBI,"Really enjoyed this... ALL of the actors I love to watch. Why are the ratings are not higher?  Just read who was in this and purchased from Amazon Digita.l (yes, it has English subtitles),
And bonus.... the actors are so beautiful, Korean men are irresistible.",1464566400,,260,4.777777777777778

7507047,5,B017JGSUBI,Beautiful film and story. Very emotional! It's always the tragic and heart wrenching stories that stay with you and pierces deep into human emotion.,1461196800,,148,5.208333333333333
7507048,2,B017JGSUBI,"Did not pay attention, did not have English subtitles so I couldn't watch it.",1459468800,,77,4.571428571428571

7507050,4,B017JGSUBI,"Beware: In the streaming version there ARE subtitles in closed captioning so make sure it is turned on  BUT! the captions are many seconds behind and in conversations it gets hard to track who's saying what when (I had to rewind two or three times in maybe ten places to unwind what was said).

But it was worth it.  Well produced (cinematography, acting, sword play, martial choreography with flying, sound, sound track were best they can be).  As with so many oriental stories, put your heart seat-belt on.  Story is wrenching.",1459036800,2,529,4.769230769230769
7507051,1,B017JGSUBI,"It would be a great movie, but if you are streaming the movie, its horrible. Beginning of the movie the closed caption worked ok, but in the middle its completely ruined because of how bad its lagging behind. Would be 5 stars if this ever gets fixed, or gets embedded into the movie.",1458691200,,283,4.3584905660377355
7507052,5,B017JGSUBI,Good movie!,1457913600,,11,5.0
7507053,4,B017JGSUBI,"First, I've seen several reviews that complain about no English subtitles in the streaming version.  I watched the streaming video and it had Closed Captioning which is almost the same thing.  The closed captioning was poorly done but it served the purpose.
As for the movie it's self, I enjoyed it and more importantly to me my Korean wife really liked it.
As for the review saying it was sad. If you don't like sad moves stay away from Korean movies. I once watched a twenty episode series and at the end they killed off everyone you cared about.",1457395200,,548,4.525252525252525

7507056,5,B017JGSUBI,good,1456531200,,4,4.0
7507057,4,B017JGSUBI,"I'll start with the problems:

The fight scenes are AWFUL.  This is largely a problem because of the way they were filmed and the way they were edited.  They also relied too heavily on gimmicks and inappropriate wire-fu for a historical film, albeit historical fiction.  They're almost as bad as the fight scenes from 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon'.  They are not quite that bad because the underscoring doesn't turn them into ballet.

The other problem was huge narrative leaps.  Eventually I picked up on what was going on, but it shouldn't have required quite so much effort.

My personal and perhaps inappropriate/ignorant opinion is that the director should have spent much more time in Beijing than Taipei (this has a very Taiwanese directorial feeling to it).

Now for the good stuff:

When fight scenes aren't taking place (and they fortunately do not make up the bulk of the movie), the cinematography and art direction are exceptional; this is a truly beautiful movie.  The acting is at least adequate all around and Kim Go-eun is wonderful as the main protagonist.

The narrative is compelling, if occasionally hard to follow and the ending is very moving.

I'll definitely look at this one again, and soon.  Now that I know the fight scenes are going to piss me off, I'll just ignore them and enjoy the rest of this beautiful film.",1456531200,,1345,4.842105263157895
7507058,1,B017JGSUBI,"lost my money on this movie. Could not watch, it said english subs and didn't have any english translation at all very dissapointed.",1456012800,,132,4.782608695652174

7507062,5,B017JGSUBI,The cinematography was beautiful! The storyline heartbreakingly sad as the daughter has to kill her parents in order to avenge the death of the third swordsman.  It is bitter sweet as her mother truly loved the dad but feels she must atone in this way.,1455235200,,252,4.6
7507063,5,B017JGSUBI,ok,1455148800,,2,2.0
7507064,4,B017JGSUBI,"This movie is awesome!  As other reviewers have mentioned, it's beautifully shot.  The colors of the scenes and costumes are so vibrant.  As always Lee Byung-hun delivers!  Joen do yeon was good, but Kim Go eun was excellent!
Positives: Story was very good, acting was well done
Negatives: maybe some missing pieces, action sequences are not as fluid, maybe because the way it was shot or maybe it was intentional as these actors are not real martial artists...",1455062400,,461,4.871794871794871
7507065,3,B017JGSUBI,"It was an okay movie, but with a slightly off-kilter plot.  I don't know exactly where the story went wrong, but it lost me.  The action and fighting scenes were pretty good though, so it wasn't a total was of time.",1454976000,,215,4.219512195121951

7507077,1,B017JGSUBI,"The trailer is subtitled, which is deceptive, but the full-length movie was not. I would have loved to have given this movie a higher rating for the lush cinematography and well-done martial arts sequences. As it was, it was extremely frustrating to watch this movie without subtitles, and we didn't even get to half of the movie before we gave up. It was such a waste of money to order this movie on Amazon Video unless you understand Korean well. I would recommend spending money on the DVD instead.",1452988800,6,501,4.640449438202247

7507081,1,B017JGSUBI,They need to fix the subtitle problem if you stream it. The guy who is talking about menu and what not must own the DVD. I contacted customer service so hopefully they will fix it. The tech department just uploaded a new movie without turning on the subtitles. If not it would be a 4 or 5 but I quit watching because I want to watch it later with sub-titles.,1452816000,8,358,4.128571428571429

7507084,4,B017JGSUBI,Plot is a little silly here and there...but over all a beautifully made film with great sword fights and gorgeous cinematography.

8739495,4,B017JGSUBI,The cinematography is absolutely breathtaking. The film reminds me on some levels of House of Flying Daggers. Only issue is that the subtitles seem to be one a 3 second delay.,1520294400,,175,4.67741935483871

8739500,5,B017JGSUBI,"I will preface this by saying this: of you don't like subtitles, this may not be a movie for you. From what I read and my own experience with the anti-subtitle population is that movie like this one tend to be slow. However, if you are feeling froggy, then make the leap and watch this movie.

So i watched this on Netflix tonight while I was bored. I didn't expect much, but I do love foreign films so I figured why not? Well I am happy I watched this.

I love watching the growth of the characters especially the main protagonist. She. Kicks. Ass. But the movie reminds you that she is young and through in some really great moments that just make you fall in love with her.

The story. Wow. Where do I start? Well it evolves so whatever you think is going on probably isn't. When you see/hear/read the plot twist, your jaw will drop. Truly a beautiful story with great fight scenes. My favorite has to be the last ""battle"". It was EPIC!

I don't want to give too much away hence why my review is rather vague. If you like Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon...you will like this movie.

I just bought a copy after I finished it on Netflix. ",1495929600,,1138,4.294392523364486
