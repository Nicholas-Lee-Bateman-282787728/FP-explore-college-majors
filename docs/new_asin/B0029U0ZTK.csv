Sweet, touching, unexpected...

Actors were amazing and realist.  Words flowed naturally. Music very apropos.

I'd recommend this to anyone who still believes ... and for those that don't!!",1359590400,2,201,5.6
8609002,5,B0029U0ZTK,"I absolutely love Kenny Johnson, so any movie or Short that he takes his shirt off and gets into character is worth my time. And it was a good fantasy story that lingers long after. Thank you Kenny and Victoria for making this film.",1334275200,6,232,4.295454545454546
8609003,1,B0029U0ZTK,"The first time I opened this DVD and put it into my player, it was skipping. Just to make sure that it was not just my player, I checked it on 2 different computers and it still was skipping. I like the story and I love the two main characters but the dialogue is hard to follow since it is skipping.

Sadly... I would recommend not going for this and just downloading the instant video for this :(",1316736000,2,398,4.102564102564102
8609004,4,B0029U0ZTK,Gorgeous and lush photography combine with great settings and great acting.  This is a beautiful short film that takes advantage of its Santa Barbara setting and a complex but romantic script.,1277510400,6,192,5.193548387096774
