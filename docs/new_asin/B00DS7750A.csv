8596964,4,B00DS7750A,"The film is based on a real-life court-room drama which with many 'Mob' members
on trial at the same time became one of the longest-running trials in U.S history.
Most of what you'll see is based on a factual account of proceedings.
'Jack Dinorcio' (Vin Diesel) is offered, by the chief prosecutor a way-out if he
testifies against the members of 'The Mob' who he looks upon as 'Family' and 'Friends'
'Jack' refuses to do so.
Despite absolutely no legal or procedural knowledge or experience 'Jack' decides to
defend himself, all other members of the 'Mob' do have legal representation on board.
His decision often brings him in contempt of court during the early part of this
long-running trial, however his unorthodox approach does have an effect on the overall
outcome,
The film often intense, sometimes amusing, is a really enjoyable watch.
We are more used to seeing 'Vin Diesel' in movies such as 'Riddick' and the 'Fast and
Furious' saga, this film shows him in a completely different light however.
( Took a while to get used too seeing 'Vin Diesel' with hair)
A REALLY GOOD MOVIE.....Not to be missed.

8596965,5,B00DS7750A,"This is one of those ""based on a true story"" films that you wouldn't believe was real. The film involves a courtroom drama as a group of individuals are brought up on various mob charges. Each one has his own lawyer, which made the courtroom full. Jackie DiNorscio (Vin Diesel_ opts to defend himself to the dismay of everyone. He starts out as a buffoon against a confident prosecutor,  but as the trial drags on for over 600 days, Jackie becomes polished and the prosecutor unravels.

And of course with Vin Diesel, it's all about family (Fast and Furious mantra).",1435881600,,566,4.65
