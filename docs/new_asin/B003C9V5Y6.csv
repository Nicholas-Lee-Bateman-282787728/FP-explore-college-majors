The story is similar to Korean series Jewel in the Palace, although this one is more fast-paced and uses a lot more beautiful dresses/decoration. There are still many 'morals of the story' one can pick up here. The downsides: the performance of some actors/actresses are not as good as in Jewel in the Palace. The performance of the main character player of Sam Hao is still far below that of the main character player in Jewel on the Palace. In my view, the best performer in this series is the one playing General Ma. Definitely a series that is worth watching.",1421107200,,631,4.745454545454545
