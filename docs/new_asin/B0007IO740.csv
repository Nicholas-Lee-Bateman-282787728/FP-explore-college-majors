2213628,5,B0007IO740,"This film puts a great perspective on the inside happenings of two bands, The Dandy Warhols and the ever-so influential Brian Jonestownn Massacre. You see the highs and lows of both bands; while the Dandy Warhols rise to success is only hindered by a record deal with a record company who just doesn't understand, the Brian Jonestown Massacre is hindered by it's frontman, Anton Newcombe and his battle with drugs and his own creative genius, which subsequently leads to the demise of the band in its original form.",1108512000,2,515,4.863636363636363
2213629,4,B0007IO740,"Sure, ""Metallica: Some Kind of Monster"" got all the love in 2004, but my favorite rock-doc-as-car-crash of last year was this: ""DiG!""

Seven-some years in the making, it's director Ondi Timoner's crazy love letter to two men -- Anton Newcombe, leader of The Brian Jonestown Massacre; and Courtney Taylor, head of the Dandy Warhols.  Both groups ignited like Apollo 11's on the launch pad of the 1990s music scene but slowly sputtered back down to the ground just as spectacularly.

Newcombe seems like a musical genius who can't resist imploding at the worst possible times and places, while Taylor has the drive and accessibility to succeed without the crucial spark of crazed brilliance.  Their friendship/rivalry takes a lot of turns during the course of this film, which was mostly recorded on handheld cameras as the events unfolded.

Everything that's right and wrong with the music industry is here: the inescapable mechanics of the game; the perils of drugs, egomania, overambition, pride and possession of mass quantities of obnoxiousness.  Anybody who thinks they might want to make music for money should see this film first.

Plus, there's a lot of great, entertaining footage here: Newcombe's ill-advised handling of a Georgia roadcheck; a run-in with David LaChappelle; and especially the BJM's disastrous, Andy Kaufman-esque meltdown in front of record execs at the Viper Room (you gotta love any fight scene that ends with ""motherf----r broke my sitar, man!"").

The movie's only significant weakness the fact that Taylor voices the film narration.  Yes, he was there and can comment on the events unfolding with a distinct air of authority, but his reading also gives the lines an unignorable bias.  It's a regretable slip that tilts the movie to a slightly unfair angle, but it doesn't sink ""DiG!""

Plus, this movie had one of my favorite supporting ""performances"" of the year: long-suffering BJM sideman Joel Gion.  If he doesn't parlay this movie into a career as a comedy star, he's not trying hard enough.",1106784000,43,2026,5.106060606060606

It definitely has a huge bias to it but as long as you keep that in mind, it is definitely enjoyable. Since watching, I have become a major fan of both groups.

I would highly recommend this regardless of whether you are a long time fan or never heard of the group. As a movie, independent of the music, it tells a pretty interesting story.",1419811200,2,476,4.230769230769231

The relationship between Newcombe and Courtney Taylor is played out giving both 'sides' fair coverage, and never does it leave you with a bad taste regarding either band. If you are a touring band, or have been a touring band, this is a great doc to watch - especially if your formidable musician years were during the mid-90's.",1404691200,,595,4.730769230769231

2213677,4,B0007IO740,"This is an interesting film documenting a couple bands that represent different sides: The Dandy Warhols were seen as the commercially accessible band who were pushed by a major label and the Brian Jonestown Massacre were a rag tag gang of musicians who were lead by the talented, yet mentally unstable Anton Newcombe.

The timing of the film was when major labels dictated more of what artists were exposed to the public, which has changed a bit in recent years. There was definitely mutual admiration and competition portrayed on behalf of both bands, though comments on BJM's line-up changes and unstable relationships explains how creative people can be difficult to work with in a certain situation.

Anyways, the film itself is an interesting commentary, but the extras and performances are worth watching too. This is worth watching for fans of the bands (and the many bands related to them as former members and side projects). Some people felt the film was a bit skewed towards favoring the Dandy Warhols, but it's also possible they were just easier to work with.",1391904000,,1073,4.955555555555556

This however, goes way beyond the usual back-story hassles and drug abuse, which can wear on anyone's brain. Very compelling. ""Heroin Is So Passe"" was written for Anton Newcombe, who destroyed the band with his addiction to heroin....

2213692,4,B0007IO740,"It's hard to be in a band. It's rare to be friends with another band and cheer lead one another as it often erupts into petty jealousies  and this movie proves that time and again. I was only marginally familiar with The Afghan Whigs and The Brian Jonestown Massacre as artists and what I saw didn't really endear either group to me. Sure... both groups make good music, but it is not nearly as revolutionary as they want to pretend it is in their minds and their pretense makes what other wise would be just good rock (without knowing the performers so intimately) a little less palatable.
As a film though... it's damn good piece of work.",1359417600,,640,4.47008547008547

The story takes place in the early 2000's when the Dandy Warhols and the Brian Jonestown Massacre were coming up in the music industry.  The lesson you will most likely pull from this film is that talented artists won't necessarily ""make it"" in the music industry and only a certain level of crazy is acceptable.

2213699,4,B0007IO740,"DiG! is a documentary that focuses on two promising 1990s rock groups: the Brian Jonestown Massacre and the Dandy Warhols. Though the film ostensibly concerns whether these groups will achieve stardom, it is at its best when it focuses on Anton Newcombe - the leader of the Brian Jonestown Massacre.

As a portrait of an angry, talented young man (Newcombe), DiG! is a success. People in the music industry regard Newcombe as a savant, even though he does everything he can to sabotage his career - fist fights with band mates, arrests for drugs, etc. DiG! offers viewers some insight into the possible roots of Newcombe's problems when discussing his childhood. Though it is sometimes difficult to watch Newcombe destroy himself, it is always interesting.

The material about the Dandy Warhols is middling. The group achieves more success than does the Brian Jonestown Massacre, but their story is just not as interesting. Anton is the main draw.

In short, DiG! is a good documentary that any fan of rock music will enjoy.",1306972800,6,1024,4.941860465116279
2213710,4,B0007IO740,"DiG is a good, interesting, and intriguing documentary about two West Coast bands who never really made it.  The one thing the dcoumentary did for me was show me what a putz and ignoramus Antone Newcombe is.  The Brian Jonestown Massacre is a band that could never have made it.  The Dandy Warhols, perhaps.  Antone Newcombe is so self-destructive, selfish, egotistical, and maniacal that he is only capable of destroying whatever he touches. I was going to buy two of their albums, but when I saw DiG, I decided that there was no way I am going to give any of my money to such a dip-stick.  He doesn't deserve anything except an ass kicking.  The documentary, however, is very good.",1300406400,2,683,4.603305785123967
2213711,5,B0007IO740,"LOVE this film.

2213712,1,B0007IO740,"It's a shame that none of Anton's band-mates have the spine to properly put him in his place.  Instead they allow him to continually destroy everything they work for because he believes that he is such a scary genius.  This guy could use a few doses of humbleness as well as a good punch in the face.  I'm available to give him both.  Would Robert Plant act this way?  Not a chance.  Would any other human who has actual talent (and a brain) dare to act this way?  Not a chance.  This is a grown-spoiled-brat-baby-man that made me want to puke in his stupid mouth whenever he opened it.  Great film making, but I feel very sorry for anyone who had to be subjected to this loser-man-child's actions while they practiced their craft.  Anton, there is a pool of your own vomit somewhere waiting for you to drown in it.  Drink up.",1288051200,,826,4.368421052631579

Can't remember how i found out about this documentary but i had seen a clip on youtube of the band fighting on stage and managed to track down a copy of this dvd at the used store. This is a very in-depth look at the troubled mind of Anton Newcombe...Nothing is held back all caught live...All the inner workings of a band up's and down's good and bad... Knowing not much about the music or the members this movie moved really fast for me... Couldn't believe the roller coaster ride was over so quick!!!

2213716,5,B0007IO740,I can easily say this is one of my favorite documentaries. I've probably seen this movie over 20 times. If you're into 60s revivalist/psychedelic music you'll love this. If you're not into that kind of music you'll probably still like it - as the story of BJM is so totally engrossing. I HIGHLY recommend this movie to all music and film buffs out there.,1243036800,,354,4.546875
2213717,5,B0007IO740,"Let me state upfront that I am a huge Brian Jonestown Massacre fan, and not very knowledgeable about the Dandy Warholes. That cleared up, I don't know what it's taken me so long to see this movie, but I finally did, and it frankly blew my mind. This release comes with 2 DVD's.

DVD 1 (120 min.) brings the original film (107 min.), tracing the origins of both bands, and their respective band leaders/singer-song-writers, Aton Newcombe for BMJ and Courtney Taylor for the Warholes. The movie was filmed over a 7 year period (1996-2003) and showcases the struggles of both bands to make it 'big'. The main focus of the film is on Anton Newcombe, a brilliant musician, but a very troubled human being (and I'm being kind). Clearly having the talent to make it big, Anton simply self-implodes time and again. Whether this is by choice or not is probably a medical issue, frankly. Watch the LA Viper Room scene, when they all know there are a number of record executives in the room, wanting to sign the band, and the gig ends up incredibly in an all-out fight among the band members on stage. Unbelievable, but real. The movie comes with a number of ""linkouts"" (about 15 min. in total) that lead you to additional scenes (such as when the Dandy Warholes' drummer leaves the band, which then gives a interview with the guy after the facts, reflecting on it).

DVD 2 ( 65 min.) brings deleted scenes, videos from the Dandy Warholes, and several live clips from BJM, as well as a jam session between Anton and Courtney. But most interesting for me was the ""Where Are They Now"" sequence, as well as an extended interview with the film's director.

I had never seen Brian Jonestown Massacre live until last year at the Monolith Music Festival (at the Red Rocks near Denver) and their 60 min. tension-filled set was fascinating. Anton Newcombe berated both the audience and his own band members, walking out several times, only to return. Unforgettable. Earlier this year, both bands have released a new album (BMJ's ""My Bloody Underground"" is quite good actually). Meanwhile, ""Dig!"" is indispensable for any indie-music fan.",1224288000,2,2117,4.747282608695652

And then, I thought they were British only to learn (after this documentary) that they are from Potland, Oregon.  What I definitely did not know is all the rivalry between them and the other band ""Brian Jonestown Massacre"" that turns out to be a really fine band too.  Both bands are very talented but also very different too.  I wanted to see more videos and performances from both groups.  It is definitely not a ""Ramones"" movie - which of course is  a let down.

Next to the polished, even-keeled Taylor--a friend and supporter--Newcombe seems like an unhinged, tortured genius set to self-destruct. His fistfight with his own band members on-stage at an industry showcase is just the beginning of a long, slow ride to hell.

2213734,5,B0007IO740,"My opinion: if you are thinking about starting a rock band, WATCH THIS FILM. This is how it is. I think that Spinal Tap was a great parody, but this is riveting to watch.

It's great they were able to get as much footage as they did over the amount of time they did it in, and left all the warts and bumps and scrapes in. You needed the 7 years to make the story out of it. You see why a lot of bands don't make it... some aren't as volatile as BJM were, but they're not that far off.

You see what ""the industry"" is like and their POV is on there. You see what they have to deal with on their end.... the indie and major label POVs both represented.

You see egos, big egos. Drugs. Lots of drugs. Living out of the van, promoting... gigs falling apart, gigs going great. The hecklers in the audience trying to give Anton a meltdown..it's a joke by the end. It's almost like you pay to see how long it takes before he storms off. Changes in band personnel, watching people come and go...quitting or getting fired. To have that stuff on film is great.

The extras on the DVD are definitely worth checking out.",1182124800,4,1108,4.1395348837209305

It's like watching a train wreck in slo-mo as Anton drives both fellow band members and the Dandy Warhols away from him with his crazy behavior. I've now watched it several times and still get a kick out it, as have everyone that I've loaned it to.  I even bought the Tepid Peppermint Wonderland collection by BJTM for myself to have more of their music. I gave them both to my mate in Scotland for Xmas, too and he was blown away by the film. The director worked on this for about 7 years and won several awards for it. A hell of alot better than the We Rock Econo crap on the Minutemen!

2213736,4,B0007IO740,"A friend of mine once observed, partly from personal experience, that behind every great person there often lay a trail of human wreckage. In this energetic documentary about two 1960s-revivalist rock music groups--the Brian Jonestown Massacre led by Anton Newcombe, and the Dandy Warhols led by Courtney Taylor--that dictum proves true. Taken from over 2,000 hours of original footage, the resulting 107 minutes take you on the scene and behind the scenes of the bands, record executives, fans, roadies, drug binges, police arrests, and concerts across the United States, Europe and Japan. Newcombe in particular is a tragic mix of manic energy, musical genius, and abusive dysfunction. I could hardly believe it when the end of the film indicated he was still alive and had independently produced twelve CDs (no one would work with him). ""Linkouts"" on the main DVD allow you to view extended deleted scenes. This is a great film to view if you feel, like I sometimes do, that you are ""out of it"" when it comes to the contemporary rock music scene.",1169596800,3,1049,4.965909090909091
2213737,5,B0007IO740,"Dig! is simply one of the greatest and most ambitious documentaries of all time.  Ondi Timoner could not have been more brillaint in making this film.

It is amazing how it all self-evolved, originally just about various L.A. bands' conflicts with art and industry, it morphed into an expose of Anton Newcombe and BJM.  She stuck around for seven years and it eventuallty turned into this.

In my own meager opinion, Dig! is only the greatest documentary ever made.

True, there are a few flaws here and there.  Courtney Taylor's narration can be a bit cheesy.  And the endless line of record executives and artists pawning over Newcombe's genius (even the legendary Genesis P Orridge chimes in) can be condescending when the music should speak for itself.  But let's see YOU make a documentary out of 1500 hours of footage and do this good a job.  With that perspective in mind, the editing is brillaint.

This as close to capturing the soul of all rebellious art, the inner meaning of what is rock music, as is possible.  All the chaos and beauty and destruction and comedy and philosophy and hypocrisy is all there to be studied.  Personally, I could not imagine a better one of its kind.",1160524800,,1191,4.700483091787439
2213738,2,B0007IO740,"When I first saw this video, I thought the Brian Jonestown Massacre were a good band, and in all honesty, they are... for a cover band. After watching the video several times and listening to their albums, they're nothing more than a Primal Scream / Spacemen 3 / Spectrum / Stone Roses / Johnny Cash / Ride / etc etc tribute/cover band... I find it hard to see anything original about the band, and that goes for the Dandy Warhols too who are somewhat self-absorbed and unimaginative. This movie showcases their clashing egos and includes a bunch of P&R record company reps talking both the bands up and discussing their problems. The movie was doctored to work against Anton Newcomb and the narration is done by friend turned rival Courtney (of the Dandy Warhols). This works for and against Anton... It will make fanboys of the BJM, or it will work like Ondi wanted it to and make you hate them. It's not much of a rock documentary, it just showcases a bunch of would-be's.. and I say that with all due respect.",1158019200,5,1013,4.540983606557377

Still, the film makes for good viewing pleasure. You get to see semi-famous rocks stars do and say all sorts of silly things while drinking, smoking and snorting a plethora of drugs with reckless abandon. In particular, the portrait of Anton Newcombe, Brian Jamestown Massacre's lead singer, makes this film worth watching, if only for the sheer comic value of witnessing his messianic complex in action. For that, the film could also serve as a case study in unbridled ego. All in all, Dig! went down nicely with some wasabi-flavored peanuts and Asahi Super Dry.

2213750,2,B0007IO740,"I quite enjoyed watching this movie but really learned nothing new from it. That this movie follows the lives of two bands of minimal talent who display hardly anything resembling originality (both in their music and their behaviour) means that anyone looking for any artistry here will be disappointed.

The story of these two bands sounds promising but the outcome is so inevitable that there is no tension or surprises - one band milks it's 15 minutes of fame for all it's worth and the other self destructs.

There is no genuine humour or wit here - just drug inflated delusional egos congratulating each other, declaring each other geniuses when the world at large really doesn't care.

Ok so this documentary captures it all and captures it well but to me it just felt like I'd seen it all before and with much more interesting characters.",1154390400,7,845,4.773972602739726

Both the Dandy Warhols and Brian Jonestown Massacre lack any real depth or musical value.  The two things that are most interesting about the documentary are: 1.  The totally crazy Anton.  He alone makes the video worth buying.  He lives in his own world, populated with his own illusions of stardom and notoriety.  ; and 2.  A portrayal of the clueless record industry.  From this video you get an idea of why music that is put out by record companys sucks so much.  They employ people who are only interested in money and/or think they actually know something about music and have never played an instrument in their life.  No wonder about 98% of records fail.  Music is controlled by and large by people who nothing about music.

That last one is part of one of the funniest scenes I've seen in a movie in 10 years, maybe ever...

Also amazing: the demented look on Anton's face when he's looking into the club at Zia and she's talking about him not wanting to actually kill them... Precious.

There is consistently bad acoustic guitar strumming, trite comments about rock and roll, and a tambourine specialist, who not only changes his accent and voice every other sentence (interestingly, he never picks up on the fact that no one is laughing as he does this), but also demonstrates to the audience how outside of society's repressive mores he is by pouring beer down his backside.  Local 'musical genius' claims to be starting a revolution every two minutes, but no evidence for musical genius is shared in the first forty minutes of the documentary.

The reason the music is revolutionary, we are told, is because it is incorporating the music from the 60's. It would be interesting to consider how these bands would be received if they were playing at the same time that Love and Spirit were in operation. In such a situation, I would hope the cameras would have the good sense to follow Arthur Lee and Randy California: two musical geniuses.

Anton Newcombe looks like a jerk throughout the movie, but, as a previous reviewer wrote, he kept getting people to work with him, so he must have had some kind of charm. It hardly makes an appearance here, though. With all her access, did Timoner really not have any more footage of Newcombe that showed him in a better light? Not that that would excuse or even mitigate his well-documented violence and God complex, but in a movie that works best by drawing the viewer into the world of the bands, the lack of a more sympathetic side of Newcombe had the opposite effect on me, making me think too much about the choices made by the film makers, rather than just enjoying the movie.

But I can't fault the director too much for this. She makes it obvious from the start of the film who she is siding with by having Courtney Taylor of the Dandies do the narration. Keeping that in mind, it's still a good movie.",1132358400,,1038,4.51595744680851

However, the only thing in the movie that would lead you to believe that this guy even has any talent is because people (non-of-which anybody has ever heard of) say he does. The real story here is: Here's some guys on the cusp of the garage rock revival, watch as they blow every chance at success with every rock n' roll cliche you've ever heard.

They are about as similar as The Beatles and The Spice Girls, but the documentary works as a whole, as it would if nearly anybody, say, Billy Idol, walked in and joined the mix. Anton Newcombe, of The Brian Jonestown Massacre, is a bona fide eccentric, borderline nutcase rock star, and although it may be true, as Dandy Warhol's lead, Courtney Taylor says in the aftermath of the production, that he's really a nice guy, but a very bad drunk, he still looks like a total (any expletive word will do), as he kicks a fan in the head for a mild catcall during a show, lays claim and emotional fervor to a newborn son, kicks back on heroin highs, and chases The Dandys around in a revealing confusion of publicity and emotional longing. He is the single most fascinating aspect of the documentary, a reckless and unhinged true artist, and a very bad drunk, and without him there is a much lesser film. It's hysterical to hear the voice-over of Brian Jonestown Massacre's representative, as she explains the night she gathered top record company executives in a club to hear the band perform, and secure them a major recording contract, based on the positive industry buzz they were receiving. What happens after she says, ""it couldn't have been worse"", is the funniest thing I've seen in a movie in a long time.",1123286400,2,1600,4.5979020979020975

This may be the best music documentary I've ever watched.  Even if I wasn't into the music, it was just entertaining to watch these musicians (quite unique indivuals I might add) and see how they go about creating music, the relationships they have with each other as band members, the way the record industry worked out for each band, the take each band had on the record industry, etc.  If you are a music fan in general, seriously watch this DVD.  FYI, as with any documentary, it is probably skewed to lead you in one direction.

2213786,4,B0007IO740,"I lived in Portland saw the Dandy Warhols early on and thought that they were cool because they approximated a music I was always into, 60's psychedelia, and they brought their own sensibilities to it. I had the same reacton to the Brian Jonestown Massacre when I heard their early records. Anything that references that kind of 60's swirl in music is fine by me and I gravitate to it - Reasons I am fans of both bands -

HOWEVER-

I would never claim that either of these bands has a one up on the other one because I don't think either band is one of the alltime greats and I don't care how either achieved their musical goals concerning the reasons given. I don't care about b.s. arguments that claim ""hey, man BJM is great because they were prolific and didn't sell out"" or the Dandies were great because ""they found a way to make it work and that's what you have to do."" At the end of the day, all you are left with is the music and if you like it great, but the suggested argument that separates the two (one sold out, one didn't) is bogus. All the bands from the 60' sold out (whatever the hell that means) at one time or another and the ones who didn't wished they had. So what? Any entertainment deal involves a deal with the devil at some level and to suggest otherwise, or that the people who make ""unheard"" music are somehow ""more pure"" is nonsense. Why sign a record deal at all, in that case, if everything that comes from that intial decision is a frickin slippery slope to being compromised? IT HAS ALWAYS BEEN THUS.

As to the hyberbole of the movie as if it is pitting two super bands against each other, the ""5 years ahead of their time"" is good rhetoric, but nothing more. Supporters of both bands can claim the Dandies' or BJM influence on music all day long, but as both were so influenced themselves (and never sold many records) who can claim a rightful timeline as to their either band's influence on anyone, unless you're talking about the heirs to BJM, none of which has had that much success on the kind of level the film wants us to accept.

To stress again, I am a fan of both bands, and I loved the movie, but the resulting success vs. sell out argument is, ultimately, a tired and worn out cliche from an era that, ironically or not, had great influence on both bands.",1116720000,26,2300,4.304849884526559
2213787,5,B0007IO740,"Sometimes names fit so perfectly;  The Dandy Warhols were, well, just dandy, while the Brian Jonestown Massacre came pretty close to their suicidal namesake.  BJM and the DW were fellow travellers in the mid to late 90's;  West Coast bands in the psycedelic folk rock tradition.  Each were friends and fans of the other.  DIG chronicles their divergent career paths during this period.  The Warhols had great business sense (just like their namesake), were hard working, very talented and intelligent and able to put on great multimedia shows reminisent of the psychedelic 60's.  They produced wonderfully listenable music (though from what I heard lyrically ho hum) and to use an anochronistic term which seems apropo, they were thouroughly bourgeois.  They seemed to be very good and fun,  just not the stuff of legend.  Very few are willing or able to pay that price....which brings us to BJM, or more particular to Anton Newcombe, the singer songwriter whose disturbed genius is really the eye of the hurrican around which DIG revolves.  His songs seem to come from the Manson mermaids on the mothership, his inspirational conduit connects him to a netherworld where few dare to tread....but of course, like any crazy possessed artist he had no choice in the matter.  He is who he is and could be no one else.  Naturally, he has no business sense and only goes through the 'career motions' because greater forces lead him there.  All he really wants to do is make songs, no matter if he makes them in the gutter or on the big star-lit stage.  Alas, it's a tale as old as the hills;  The possessed neglected artist who can not be managed and is left to wither on the vine, and the good artists with good work ethics who find wide public appeal.
  BJM's shows, as depicted in DIG, tend to sputter and crash on the launch pad, often leaving one breathless for more (I wish DIG showed more concert footage)  One telling scene during their first American tour had some of their ten hour set played for ten people at the Communist offices in Cleveland.  If that isn't playing music for the pure love of it I don't know what is!  Meanwhile (although the timeline was unclear) the Warhols were playing giant festivals in Europe, though  Stateside, thanks to the deplorable state of our commercial radio industry et al.  they remained little known.
  I found myself greatly admiring both bands (both were lovable in their own ways) and rooting for both to achieve greater success in a cruel and fickle industry.  The myth of Sisyphus comes to mind.  But though I admired both bands I was really only interested in BJM.  The Dandies were nice but run-of-the-mill.  They were only interesting in that they provided a contrast to BJM.
  I wish the filmmakers had shown a bit more of BJM's creative side, when songs gell and performed well; rather than always showing their blow-ups and self-destructs ( and how much of this was shown out of context?)
  Ultimately DIG is a great document of the struggle of the creative spirit (in all its guises) in the modern world.",1116288000,3,3059,4.732954545454546
2213788,5,B0007IO740,"Shot over seven years, Dig! is a documentary that, at its most basic, chronicles the complicated friendship between two musicians, Courtney Taylor of the Dandy Warhols and Anton Newcombe of the Brian Jonestown Massacre.

The film goes deep beneath the surface to capture the funny, sad and compelling lives of these men and their bands, particularly the mercurial Newcombe. The Taylor-Newcombe friendship is fraught with jealousy, rage, admiration, love, hate and bitterness, especially as Taylor's Dandys achieve some level of commercial success while Newcombe's BJM self-destructs at every turn, mostly by Newcombe's own hand..

One important theme here is the concept of giving up or compromising one's vision and art for the almighty dollar. Taylor is  willing to take the risk (and succeeds), Newcombe isn't (and flounders). But that leads to another compelling question, posed by the Dandy's Peter Holstrom: what's the point of making music if no one gets to hear it?

Indeed. When BJM is given a second (tenth?) chance at getting signed with a major label, Newcombe again pisses it away as the band brawls on stage. The label rep was apparently not impressed.

There's no doubt that Newcombe is the ""star"" of this film. From his flashes of brilliance to his indulgent heroin use, the engaging and fascinating artist wastes his talent and creativity to fill a higher need, which apparently is a strong desire for attention. This becomes clear when we see interviews with his parents - a deadbeat dad who commits suicide on his birthday and an ambivalent mother who has simply given up.

Ondi Timoner captures some great moments on film, including all the amusing fights on stage, rants, raves and general madness. And she does a nice job of capturing it all without being a part of it or judging any of the motley cast of characters in the process. I loved this film.

Torn between the two he appeared to sabotage any chance the band had of possibly 'making it'. However, there are some hilarious (unintentional) comic moments - mostly involving the BJTM and the crazy mish-mash of personalities involved.

2213803,5,B0007IO740,"This interesting movie is about the vital history of two bands: The Brian Jonestown Massacre and The Dandy Warhols. Although it pretends to cover seven years in time, it is mostly about when these two bands were signed by major and indie labels in 1996 and 1997. People like myself who were journalists at the time, with Cups Magazine and Free Williamsburg Online have already covered most of the history of these bands. They were in magazines a lot. I interviewed Anton Newcombe back in 2001. That interview and others like it is perhaps all someone has to know about him. The music speaks for itself. I have seen this film twenty times now. I saw an early cut of it with Anton sitting next to me. First off I have to say that I have mixed feelings about it.

First off I think it is great cinema and must be seen. Anton Newcombe has been making music his whole life and has been able to revive the sprit and heart of bands like The Velvet Underground and The Jesus and Mary Chain. He was doing this music fifteen years ago. Today almost every garage band is making this similar minded music. Today a lot of bands are safe, polite, and business-like. Anton somehow has embraced the rock and roll myth and has updated it. His music, and not his behavior, is always the most important thing though.

Secondly I reject the whole Oprah-esque, pop psychology tone of this film. Director Ondi Timoner has suggested that Anton Newcombe is a product of a broken home and that is the reason why he seems so angry and uncompromising. The Dandy Warhols are portrayed as a bunch of well-adjusted post-hippies who get along with everyone and know how to succeed. Like their good souls and parents somehow relate to outward success. I have known Anton Newcombe for twenty years and have known nothing about his parents and his drugs habits. Anton has always been a person who liked to confront people. He likes to argue. That is his nature. Anton has always been a person who loves music. He is a songwriter above everything else.

It seems like The Dandy Warhols do just as much drugs as any other band. So much for their healthy habits. They don't fight with their audiences and fight with each other. They seemed bored most of the movie. They are like some spoiled privileged children who expect attention. Director Ondi Timoner has said, ""There are perfectly functional people that make great art, Like Courtney and the Dandys."" I think it's a little premature to say the Dandys have made ""great art."" They are not the Beatles, Brian Wilson, or Bob Dylan, who are really great artists. Anton himself has made twelve albums. You can't be dysfunctional and write that many songs. Who is Timoner kidding? The Dandys are not even selling as many records as Interpol, The Killers, or Green Day. The Dandys still play small venues in America that new bands with one album play.

I guess that Anton made the mistake of getting into a fight every time Timoner had the cameras on. I have seen Anton play twenty times or more and there were no fights. Some of the footage shot with hidden cameras is an evasion of privacy. On the other hand, according to Zia McCabe, Timoner deleted many stupid comments that The Dandys made. She made them look good always if she had the chance. The commentary by Ondi Timoner is a good chance to show off her baby and nothing else. Why that Nina A&R chick is in the film more than once is beyond me. I heard that she is Ondi's best friend or something. It would have been better to have other bands and fellow musicians talk about BJM and less A&R people.

Timoner is very dishonest about the origins of the film as well. She has said ""This project (was) about bands negotiating the route between art and commerce..."" That is a lame and vague description, and could be made about any film. As I have heard this film was originally about BJM and a few other bands, all of which are no longer together. Newcombe suggested that she should do a film about his band and the Dandys, because the rest of the bands she chose didn't matter. As can be seen in the film, Timoner tells Newcombe that she have never heard of the Dandy Warhols. How could she have thought of a film about these two bands if she hadn't heard of one of them before she started shooting? Now we can only wonder why Newcombe has dismissed the film as an exercise in Jerry Springer technique.

Newcombe has other points of the film to contend with. He thinks that not enough of his music is represented. Every song gets cut off after thirty seconds. There are a few live songs by BJM on the bonus DVD but not the great videos they have done. It's unclear to me what happens in Georgia. When BJM gets busted in Georgia, it was really Ondi Timoner herself who was alledgely busted for marijuana. Newcombe was only cited for an expired license. On the commentary all people are very quiet or edited out at this point. Police in Kansas stopped me once in 1996, so I know how it is. This is one of the main points of the film. BJM are so damn unlucky, while the successful and lucky Dandys only get a ticket in France. The other problem with the film is that Timoner just focuses on two years with BJM while she shows eight years of the Dandys. There is footage from a live performance in 2003, but it is only live footage of the Sunset Junction gig. There is not a lot of footage from the past three years. I guess Anton wasn't beating up anyone then, so it was not worthy of the film? People tend to act up when the cameras are running. If BJM had fifty members in its twelve years of existence we only saw about ten members. We only got 20% of the story.

Anton Newcombe has done his best work in the past three years. BJM has played hundreds of shows in America, Canada, and the UK. At the end of this film you get a feeling that BJM has broken up and Anton has died. This is not even close to the truth. Anton is not even on the DVD commentary (neither is Peter Hayes). About the DVD he is as silent as he was when listening to ""Junkie."" His band has been the launching pad for about artists such as BRMC, Miranda Lee Richards and The Warlocks. His influence is still enormous and inspiring. I don't really see the same inspiring hotbed of creative activity from the Dandy Warhols. They just seem like a bunch of smug, rich kids, or social climbers, who when they got in the door, using the BJM ladder, they just kicked the ladder away. This movie is just a weathermap. The real art is the music of Brian Jonestown Massacre and Anton Newcombe. That music written by Anton will be the only thing that will ever be considered art connected to this film. Even The Dandys agree with that sentiment in the film. The Dandys are nothing but a pop group. They are just another band.

People who see this film can only be more interested in BJM. People who like The Dandys are not going to think more of them having seen this film. It's sad to see Joel Gion on the cover of the DVD. I know that he plays the fool to Anton's tortured genius. But it's like seeing Jack Kerouac and Neil Cassidy on the cover of On The Road. The author is reduced to a supporting role in the book he has written.

I suggest getting some of the BJM CDs as well. They are wonderful.",1113609600,28,7230,4.385533184190902
2213804,5,B0007IO740,"This is quite possibly one of the best documentaries I have ever seen. Anton is hilarious and it gives a really interesting perspective on the music industry and the lives of pseudo rock stars. It is crazy to see what these bands have to go through, and it was filmed over seven years, so it covers a lot. I definitely recommend it if you are into either the Dandys or the Masacre...or if you are just a music fan in general.",1113436800,3,425,4.2592592592592595
2213805,5,B0007IO740,"All of the advertising for this movie and even the back of the box says that it is about The Dandy Warhol's and The Brian Jonestown Massacre and the relationship between them. One fiercely independent, the other just signed to a deal with Capitol Records, and the love hate relationship between the lead singers of the wo bands who are best friends. In truth that seemed to be a small part of the movie. It is really about Anton, the singer/songwriter behind the brilliant Brian Jonestown Massacre, and his self-destructive behavior over the course of 7 years. The Dandy's seem to only be in the movie to show how far and strange the behavior of Anton is.

The movie wa thouroughly entertaining, even if you have never heard of either band. I watched it with a group of friends and I was the only one who had heard of either band and everyone thought it was great. A must see for any fan of either band, rock'n'roll, or documentaries.",1113350400,,934,4.5266272189349115
2213806,5,B0007IO740,"This movie is great, except for the one very important case that Anton was shown the way he was. After you watch this movie go and research Anton and the BJM. You'll realize that after his breakdown he kept making amazing records. I got into a whole new world because of this film. I went in for the Dandys and got out with the BJM in mind, now my favorite band. Also theres an everlasting showing of drama and interesting scenarios in the movie. I assure your going to be entertained by the literally the Tambourine man. You will enjoy this and if you do research after; you will know exactly how honest this film is but never the less I enjoyed this greatly.

I have alot of ""you will's"" you will feel however you feel. Mostly likely good.",1113004800,5,741,4.330935251798561
2213807,4,B0007IO740,"...but really should.

Out of the death rattle of the grunge movement sprang the Cain and Abel of the American indie scene.  This documentary focuses on two ""can't-miss"" bands that have somehow managed to miss continuously, either through the incessant professional suicidal tendencies of this generation's leading ""tortured artist"" Anton Newcombe"" of The Brian Jonestown Massacre, or from a major record label's never-ending inability to properly market and/or promote the talent that they shelled out so much hard-earned cash to sign away from other labels in Courtney Taylor Taylor (don't ask) of the Dandy Warhols.

The documentary takes place from roughly 1995 through 2003, but the majority of time seems to be spent from 1997-'98, wherein the Warhols are signed to Capitol Records and supposedly find themselves on the inside track to success just as the Massacre suffres one wholly self-engineered debacle after another as Newcombe loses the plot and decides that the Warhols have somehow compromised all levels of their artistic integrity because they have actually gotten some (albeit too few) people to listen to them and actually buy their records.

Newcombe is idealized as the greatest musical genius since Bob Dylan and the Warhols are somehow shown as far lesser talents whose success would appear to be wide-reaching, but a review of either artist's career will confirm that this cannot be taken at face value.  Both bands have gifts for writing and arranging hook-driven pop songs that really are too good for today's commercial music scene.  The success of the Dandy Warhols lies more in their ability to market their music to film soundtracks and advertising campaigns (not covered well enough in this film, IMO) than as a result of massive record sales in their home country (although they are huge in Australia and extremely respectable in Britain and Europe).

This is a very entertaining and sometimes very painful movie to watch; it's not often you are afforded the chance to watch someone tearing the wires out of their career so publically (and for such an extended period of time), but although this film introduces two very talented bands (and hopefully will tap a heretofore unrealized fan base), I can't recommend it as truly indicative of the careers of both bands.

The bonus features included in the DVD make it worth the price of ownership if you happened to see the film in theatres.  Bonus live performances, extended scenes, even some promotional videos (not, sadly, for LaChappelle's work with the Warhols) as well as commentary audio tracks from both bands as well as the filmmakers are sure to offer additional insight (and possibly additional versions of the truth) as to what was filmed.  I'll be looking forward to this one in a big way.",1110240000,4,2781,5.078947368421052
2213808,4,B0007IO740,"DiG! showcases two bands and makes you believe that the Dandy Warhols were a sellout group, whereas the insane Anton Newcombe, leader of the BJM, is a misunderstood and cruelly ignored genius on the order of Artaud or Blake.  But when you get through the hype of the narrative, how much of this thesis holds up?  The documentary seems designed to argue a thesis, but viewers can't help wishing for a little bit of the other side of the story.  I think Courtney shows good manners throughout, even consenting to narrate a film that tries to make him look like a jackass at every juncture.

That said, the picture grows on you, and lets you into a number of secret places along the way.  Jeff Davies (of BJM) was born to play leading roles in front of the camera; his damaged, wounded face and his large kissable lips are like movie magic, he simply burns up the screen, and you don't even care what he's on half the time.  Miranda Lee Richards, who has a great LP of her own music, makes a fascinating impression as well.  She is enigmatic and naturalistic as Jeanne Moreau in an early Louis Malle movie.  She doesn't say a lot, but her gaze and her stance say plenty.  As for Anton Newcombe, the filmmakers do their best to paint him as the Beethoven of modern rock, but they give him enough rope to hang himself and indeed he does.",1109808000,5,1332,4.404081632653061
