8461290,4,B00587HI2I,"While not exactly timeless sci-fi, it was fascinating to see how primitive but naively sincere these shows were.  Plus seeing a very early performance by Ross Martin (one of my favorite, underrated actors of the 60's) in the first Johnny Jupiter episode had me grinning for weeks.",1394236800,,280,4.957446808510638
8461291,5,B00587HI2I,"I bought this because it has TWO episodes of Johnny Jupiter -- I already had only one. Tom Corbett is not one of my favorite 50s outer-space TV shows (I much prefer Rocky Jones and Dumont's Flash Gordon, as played by Steve Holland). But I leapt at the opportunity to own two Johnny Jupiter episodes. It's a simple and fun show! I wish all of its episodes were available! This DVD is well-packaged, and price/delivery were excellent!",1386288000,,432,4.623376623376624
8461292,1,B00587HI2I,Total let-down. I only ordered it because the shows are on my list of sci-fi programs from the past. Both shows are so dumb that we could have done without them. Save your money and buy the classics.,1361318400,,199,4.2631578947368425
8461293,4,B00587HI2I,This is a great example of the type of kid shows I and millions of other children watched in the 50's.  Funny but very nostalgic,1351555200,4,128,4.12
8461294,5,B00587HI2I,"Before the age of CGI toys, veggies, and cutsie animals, there was live television using, gasp, human actors! Such a time was the halcyon 1950s. Such a show was Tom Corbett. These kinescopes are testament to a time when science fiction dreams were produced on a shoestring budget. Watch Tom and his fellow space cadets battle a dangerous space pirate in a campy costume. For added fun, there's a couple of episodes of a very rare show called Johnny Jupiter, about a young man who contacts his puppet friends on Jupiter. Ah, fun times indeed.",1310256000,,541,4.705263157894737
