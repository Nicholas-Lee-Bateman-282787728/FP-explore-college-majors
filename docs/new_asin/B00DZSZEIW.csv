8599537,1,B00DZSZEIW,"What a disappointment! The Philippines has produced powerful martial arts (known variously as Arnis, Kali and Escrima), and Ruben G. Tansingco is clearly a great master of them. But neither he, these systems nor the viewers are well served here.

Why? Because there is absolutely no instruction on this DVD!

First there is an overly-long (six minutes) opening sequence showing students being tested by submitting to blows with a sword, with some spoken explanation about the history of these arts, Then come sections on topics like using angles, slipping and avoiding attacks,etc. But there's no actual instruction -- not by Mr. Tansingco, a narrator or even in written titles -- about just what he's doing and why. For example, there's not even any basic instruction on how to correctly hold the baton.

Yes, the sequences with Master Tansingco demonstrating both offense and defense, alone or with a partner, are often shown both at normal speed and slow motion, which is good. But there is no teaching of any points of technique.

Just as it's about impossible to learn guitar by just watching someone play (no matter how excellent that guitarist is), the aspiring student of Philipino stick fighting will make little, if any, progress watching these unexplained demonstrations.

Let me ctress -- I mean no disrespect to Master Tansingco nor to the excellent Philpino combat arts. But I must be honest in this review. The producers at Budo International could have served us all much better.",1520121600,,1495,5.060975609756097
