1404992,5,B000059H6J,"The Kenshin TV series fluctuates from some cheesy filler episodes to major, intense ones.  ""Shadow of the Wolf"" is, what I believe, the most intense of the series up to this point!  The battle w/ Jinei way back in DVD vol. 2 was also incredible, but this one is the closest to the ever-popular OVAs of Samurai X; Very dark, intense, and heated action.
The DVD also stands out to the earlier releases as it's the first to have an animated menu, the slickest CD-face print, different menu layout, and a darker mood overall.  This truly fits this, what I feel to be, motion picture, as this DVD is all one story though it encompasses 4 ""episodes.""
If you've dabbled into Kenshin a little but don't wish to purchase all of the series, GET THIS ONE, along w/ the OVAs ""Trust"" and ""Betrayal.""  Being the Kenshin fanatic, I'm collecting all of the TV series :-)",994291200,,854,4.490322580645161
1404993,5,B000059H6J,"Kenshin is one of the my favorite anime television series. While the animation quality may not stand up against the artwork of OAV works like Cowboy Bebop (which I recommend even more then Kenshin), Rurouni Kenshin has such a great story that it really pulls you in and holds onto you to the last second. The first several DVDs are really more character development (which IS important, don't get me wrong) they focus on the history of the characters surrounding Kenshin, and occasionally throw in a good bit of comedy. But this DVD is where all the exciting stuff kicks off! If you liked the first few DVDs, then you are gunna love this new story arc! Now that we've met the other characters we start to focus on Kenshin himself as his gloomy past comes back to haunt him. This DVD is the start of what is called the Kyoto Arc, from here Kenshin is challenged to face his inner self and deal with his bloody past. I warn you though, if you watch this DVD, you will be crying out for the next one as soon as it ends!",993945600,11,1016,4.324607329842932
1404994,5,B000059H6J,"This is a MUST have DVD for all RK fans. This DVD begins with the second season of RK, the Kyoto Arc. It includes the  Saito/Kenshin battle. This is the best fight in this anime. This is also when Kenshin leaves Kaoru and the others to go to Kyoto to fight against a guy named Shishio. The series has gotten a whole lot darker and serious now. The cheerful background music I loved so much has been replaced with mysterious and eerie music. Anyway, this DVD is great!",992908800,2,467,4.306818181818182
1404995,4,B000059H6J,"I wanted desperately to give this DVD a 5 star arting, but that would be saying that it is perfect, and *sniff* it's not.  The annoying way that Media Blasters has translated such great Kenshin sayings as ""Oro"" and ""de gozaru yo"" really gets on my nerves.  However, that does not mean that this is not one of the greatest parts of the greatest anime of all time.  Unlike the ...Evangelion DVD's, the picture quality of these DVDs is greatly improved from VHS.  When I first heard about the poorly subtitled Kenshin DVDs, I thought I wouldn't get them, but now I changed my mind, and have my eyes on the whole series.  Shadow of the Wolf will be my most prized DVD when it is released(along with my Kenshin OVA, gwahaha).  I absolutely have to have it, and I'm telling you, you should too.",991612800,2,788,4.4
1404996,5,B000059H6J,"The only advice I can give is, strap yourself in and pray to the gods that you aren't thrown off!
""Shadow of the Wolf"" is the first installment of Rurouni Kenshin's second story arc, what many have come to call the Kyoto arc. A remnant of the Revolution, long believed dead, has come back to haunt the world, and Kenshin is the only man alive able to stop him.
If you have, up until this point, classified ""Rurouni Kenshin"" as goofy and light-humored, then you're in for a very rude awakening! From here on out, things become very dark, very, very quickly. Many of the people in my anime club refused to continue watching, because it was so graphic!
But it is this segment that defines what Kenshin is about! So, unless you're simply in this for the laughs, you'd better prepare yourselves for one wild ride!",989280000,9,808,4.503401360544218
1404997,5,B000059H6J,"For those of you who have been following the Rurouni Kenshin TV series, this ONE DVD makes the rest of the series pale in comparison. Yes, this DVD is the start of the much renowned Kyoto Arc, but this is also the introduction of (in my opinion) the best character in the entire RK TV series. Well, short of a certain cape-wearing sensei. If you thought that Kenshin was only a decent series before, I dare you to pick this DVD up, and deny that this is one of the best anime series of all time.",986428800,4,495,4.166666666666667

If you think that kenshin was great fighting jin-e, the true hitokiri will come out on this one snd show you how bad kenshin was when he was a hitokiri.  I advise you to buy this vol and the volumes after this cause this is basically the best chapter of the series....saitoh is the only bad guy you will grow to like.....in other words this dvd is very zeeehhhhssteeeehhhh!!!!!",982627200,2,550,4.425742574257426

His name is Saito Hajime, and he is out to finish a job he started years ago as a member of the ""Shinsen Gumi"".  When this character arrives on the scene Kenshin's mood swings into a very violent stage, and the story of Ruroni Kenshin as you know it changes completely.  US fans have been waiting years for its domestic release.  This DvD is guaranteed to supply you with the most incredible fight scene ever witnessed in anime.",980812800,2,541,4.604166666666667
1405089,5,B000059H6J,"This is the rated the best Kenshin fight in the entire series, OVA, anime and manga. I hate reading reviews that don't give me information so I'm going to give you enough information for you to be satisfied. I havn't watched THIS DVD yet, but I watched this DVD at my friends house. It starts with Kenshin dreaming about his days as Hitokiri Battousai (Translation: Shadow assasin Manslayer) during the Ikedaya affair, when Ishin shi shi members (people who fought for the Meji governmetn) want to raise an army and set fire to Kyoto, which was the captiol of Japan. The Shinsengumi (an elite group of Tokyo swordsman who support the existing shogun government) find out about the plot and raid the inn the Ishin shi shi are in. The action starts when the door to the room the Ishin shi shi are in, and the man who opens it, is bleeding at the mouth and goes ""Meiboru!"" and dies. The Ishin shi shi fight it out with the Shinsengumi, and the Shinsengumi easily kills all of them. Then a building explodes, and two Ishin shi shi members try to get away when they are cornered by the Shinsengumi. They are saved by Kenshin, who kills 8 Shinsengumi. Then Saitou comes and does a gatotsu (left handed stab) on kenshin. Then Kenshin wakes up. Near the middle of the DVD, Saitou reappears and fights it out with Kenshin. This is the single BEST fight in Kenshin. Then the action diminishes. I recommend this DVD HIGHLY!!!!!!!!!",1066089600,,1420,4.572549019607843
1405090,5,B000059H6J,"Even though I don't own this, but it's the one I'm working on getting, I've been watching this on Cartoon Network, and I have to say, this is the one that starts it all. This DVD starts off Season 2 of 3 and a man from Kenshin's past as a manslayer(if you've seem Samurai X:Trust and Betrayal)comes back to take revenge on him. During the revolution, there was a group of warriors known as the Shinsagumi and in it was Saito. He is a well-skilled man and fights Kenshin in this DVD,which I think is one of the best I've seen thus far, up to episode 56, which is where I am on Cartoon Network. We're also introduced to a new warrior, who is known as Shishio, which is also in Samurai X at the end when he takes over Kenshin's job when he disappears and then is wanted as a killer. Along with him is a well-skilled boy known as Sojiro, which is in episode 54, you'll find out why he's always smiling, and why he's so skilled, because that episode is all about his past. One more thing(which I don't know if it's on here or not, and I don't spoil it for some)but Kenshin does leave Tokyo to go off and fight the fight that might mean he will have to kill. Well, all you Kenshin fans, keep watching and buying, because I will.",1063065600,9,1222,4.160337552742616

The DVD has some pretty funny outtakes and the Saito VS Kenshin battle is the whole reason for this DVD. This DVD gives you some knowledge of the Meiji era and its leaders. In the special features there is some information about the Meiji era and revolution. This DVD is really good and I recommend it if you have a basic knowledge about Rurouni Kenshin.",1055548800,,496,4.4021739130434785
1405092,5,B000059H6J,"Considering that your even reading this review you are desperalty trying to decide if this dvd is worth buying, right? Anyway i would highly recommend this dvd, it features the first four episodes ( 28-31) in the koyoto (sp?) arc in rurouni kenshin.  Full opening theme and ending theme songs with subtitles so you can tell what the song is translated in english.  In the extras there is out takes too.  I won't go into speculation on the episodes because i have a hard time with the spelling of all the names but episode 30 is just awsome!  It contains kenshin and saito fighting, kenshin reverting to his manslayer self.  And episode 31 will leave you crying for the next volume..Why Do You Ask? Buy the dvd to find out!
Note: not recommended for little kids, if you watch rurouni kenshin on cartoon network's toonami you will find out that this dvd is unedited.  Theres blood gushing, violence and the ocassional swear word.",1054771200,,927,4.656441717791411

Can Kenshin fend him off without breaking his oath not to kill? Saito Hajime is the coolest guy in the series. He is cleaver, cool, and a great swordsman. Gatotsu anyone?

1405095,5,B000059H6J,"This volume is the start of the Kyoto arc, and here the anime follows the manga more closely than it did in the beginning.  There are less filler episodes from here on in, which is always a plus.  These four episodes introduce Saitou, who is the last surviving Shinsengumi.  He appears to work for a corrupt politician, but later it is revealed that he is serving his own form of 'seigi' (justice).  In the fight between him and Kenshin, we see the true strength of the Wolf of Mibu and the legendary Hitokiri of the revolution.",1035936000,,528,4.46875
1405096,5,B000059H6J,"This starts the Kyoto story arc, which is the arc when Kenshin must become a Rurouni again and leave for Kyoto to stop Shishio Makoto.
An old rival from the Revolution, Hajime Saito, leader of Shinsengumi Squad 3 comes to fight Kenshin, hired by the government to test the Battousai's strength. They start to fight and Saito forgets he isn't supposed to be trying to kill the battousai, then the Police Commissioner appears and stops them from killing each other. The leader of the Meiji government then gets into recruiting Kenshin to fight etc. and Kenshin ends up leaving, saying goodbye only to Kaoru.
Unlike past DVDs this one isn't as funny, its much more serious, there is 1 or 2 parts that are humorous (like when Megumi slaps a collar onto Kenshin) but overall its lacking the humor in previous Rurouni Kenshin DVDs.
Id also recomend buying it with Ice Blue Eyes",1032048000,2,871,4.699346405228758

1405146,5,B000059H6J,This episode has some of the best sword fights I have ever seen Hajime Saito has sword skill equal to kenshin but he also has great skill in hand to hand combat like when he kick zanza's [butt] after his sword breaks! I say this DVD is the best kenshin episode that I have seen so far. All four episodes are excellent and extremely beautyful and sad at the same time as kenshin sets of to become a wanderer again.

1405147,5,B000059H6J,"Having seen every volume up to The Son of God, I can easily say that this volume contains the most interesting character intro (Saito), forshadowing of conflict (Shishio faction) and ironic alliance (Saito & Kenshin),  and profound thematic change. The fight between Saito and Kenshin remains by far the most enjoyable to watch than any other (including Kenshin/Saito/Sano/Aoshi vs. Shishio). I hope someone will produce the Revenge Arc where Enishi exacts justice against Kenshin for Tomoe.",1017878400,,491,5.4605263157894735
1405148,5,B000059H6J,"Of all of the Kenshin DVDs that have been released up to the close of the ""Kyoto Arc"", this is the greatest of them. This DVD begins the first chapter of the ""Kyoto Arc"", introducing Kenshin's old nemesis from the revolution, Saito, and foreshadowing the threat of Shishio Makoto (Shishio is the core villain in the ""Kyoto Arc""). If there is one Kenshin DVD that you are going to buy to get a taste of the series, this is the one. I rate this as the top of the bunch.",1011744000,,467,4.2
1405149,5,B000059H6J,"I gotta say, Rurouni Kenshin just keeps getting better and better with every VHS and DvD release. The dubbing gets better, and the plot thickens, and you just get sucked into the story. First of all, I have got to say Saito Hajime's english voice is very well done, he sounds like the typical ""I don't take any [thing]... from no one."" Also his fighting style is rough, the way he fought Kenshin was something else, and the music just boosted it even more.
If you buy this volume, your gonna end up getting the next one, and the one after that, and the one after that.",1010448000,,568,4.317757009345795
1405150,5,B000059H6J,"This is my favorite Kenshin to date.  It includes appearances of many important characters, such as a brief glimpse of Sojirou, the boy assassin, and the arrival of Hajime Saito, former leader of the Third Squad of the Shinsengumi and the Battousai's arch-rival.  The battle between Kenshin and Saito is awesome.  It is also the beginning of the Kyoto arc, which is where the story really takes off.",1005782400,,399,4.838235294117647
1405151,5,B000059H6J,"In a word, AWESOME!  This is the Rurouni Kenshin/Samurai X series at its best.  This is anime at its best. Himura Kenshin did not rank as one of my favorite anime characters until I saw Shadow of the Wolf.  Otaku and neophyte will be amazed by the depth of the writing and by the brilliance of the direction. We are allowed a glimpse of what Kenshin must have been like as the Battousai -- and he is not even close to what he was ten years ago!  The swordfighting sequences are an acrobatic thrill.  So, if you only watch one DVD of Rurouni Kenshin, do yourself a favor and watch this one.",1001721600,,589,4.223214285714286

If you love this show as much as I do then DO buy this!  It has one of the best fight scenes I've seen in a long while and a touching moment that left me in tears during the ending credits.

1405153,5,B000059H6J,"One of the best set of episodes yet in Rurouni Kenshin series.  It marks the opening of the Legend of Kyoto arc in the series and is one of the best in the entire series.  All the battles from here on out are intense, powerful.  The foes are large, fast, and incredibly deadly.  One of the best characters in the Kenshin series, Sojiro (spelling) makes his debut in this arc.  Saito, one of Kenshin's biggest opponents during the revolution shows up in the first of this arc, He's the one on the cover behind Kenshin.  You get to meet Kenshin's master.  You will also see the successor to the title of Battousai.
It has many things in it... and this time Sanoske isn't going to simply sit back and be worthless like he was with the pirates...  All the characters have some role or another, and they leave Tokyo, meet up with some gang members from a previous episode.  It is a great arc that is longer than the first portion of the series and is far more intense.  It's all out right now so you won't have to wait for the next and for the next.  Go ahead and get it, it's a must for any Kenshin fan, and it's a strong push into the serious side of Kenshin.",996192000,,1156,4.209090909090909

It becomes clear that the Past has cought up with Kenshin and that he can't bury his being a ""Manslayer"" any longer. This is a great DVD with good animation. The Characters have developed very good over the entire Story Arc. They've gotten more background (espescially Kenshin) and are able to show more emotions than in the beginning of the Series.

At the turning point something happened and he just vanished. 11 years later he encounters a girl named Kaoru while wandering through Tokyo. He saves her life just before she is killed trying to fight a notorious murderer. He begins living with her at her dojo. They gain new friends and have many adventures, but one day ghosts from Kenshin's murderous past come back to haunt him. His gentle nature gives way to a murderous side and Kaoru must stand by him to keep him from changing forever.

In this volume Hajime Seito, Kenshins strongest opponent ever, comes to call. He forces Kenshin to return to his murderous ways once again. Even though this man seems evil, he may prove to be one of the strongest allies and a true patriot in the future. The terrible battle for Japan is revealed now.

Rurouni Kenshin is an amazing anime series. Maybe even one of the best ever made. It has everything. Action, comedy, drama, suspense, romance, and mystery are all common themes in this anime. The amazing part is that it is based loosely on actual historical characters. The animation, voice acting, soundtrack, and plot are all very well done. There are dozens of great and unforgettable characters. This anime is a legend, and is a must see for any anime fan. It's also pretty family friendly. It has violence, but it's pretty conservative.

7933360,5,B000059H6J,"Contained in this DVD is arguably the most spectacular fight scene of the Rurouni Kenshin series. Although some might claim that the Battosai's later battles rival this one between Saitou and Kenshin, I do not share this opinion. Finally viewers get a glimpse of the real manslayer, not only through flashbacks to his revolution exploits, but more importantly with the masterful use of color, contrast, and motion in this, Kenshin's ultimate battle.
I am almost afraid to say too much, and spoil the surprise for you.
The fight begins in Episode 29 and is concluded in Episode 30.
I really cannot express in words how much I love the contract of color used in the fighting.
The shadowing affect obtained with the employment of various shades of brown and duskier, duller colors not only emphasizes the seriousness of this clash and the emotionless  stances of both fighters, but it gives incredible contrast to the bright scarlet blood, shining blades, and the hues used to paint the other characters aside from Himura and Saitou.
I urge you, if you want a taste of true anime greatest, no other DVD could be better to introduce you to this awesome world of Japanese animation.
If I was to buy only one Kenshin DVD, this would definitely be it. A true masterpiece of modern media, you will really be missing out on something great if you pass this up. Indulge a little and treat yourself to a great product.",1085529600,6,1407,4.742857142857143
7933361,5,B000059H6J,"This is absolutely, positively, no-doubt-about-it incredible! Saito is creepy and mean, but there is honor there, and a small bit of kindness. A former Shinsengumi leader, he is now a police officer, and uses his position (both of them) to his advantage. Of the ""bad guys"" Kenshin's faced so far, Saito is tied with Aoshi for number one on my list of favorites. I can't say I'd ever like to meet Saito in person, but as a character he is great!
Now, for the fight scene. I'm not kidding when I saw that this is the coolest fight so far. I'm not going to give anything away, but just let me say that this fight alone is worth the money for the dvd. I was blown away by it, and I think you will be too.
Voice acting is normal for this series. The subbed version is awesome, and the dubbed version needs to be destroyed as soon as possible. The English acting sounds stilted and the voices are wrong, especially Kenshin's. My God, I hate the dubbed version!
The art is gorgeous! I love how they did the fights. The animators did a terrific job with the Saito-Kenshin fight, considering that it was taking place at dusk and both characters move incredibly fast.
So, to sum it up--WATCH THIS! If nothing else, you at least need to see the Saito-Kenshin fight! I also loved the scene where Kenshin leaves. Now go WATCH IT!",1083283200,2,1316,4.397540983606557

We get more details about Kenshin's past than ever before, some beautiful artwork, incredible new characters, and some of the best fight scenes ever to be illustrated.
And luckily for the fans, the anime series brought the Kyoto Arc to life with style and substance to spare. The First volume, Shadow of the Wolf, starts the second season out with a bang, introducing both Kenshin's old rival, Hajime Saito, and his replacement-turned-renegade, Makoto Shishio, to name but two.
However, the real draw of this DVD is not the story, nor the character development (thought both are pulled off wonderfully by their japanese and english performers) but the deathmatch between Kenshin and Saito that stretched over two episodes. This is most likely the single best duel ever put to celuloid, bar none, and features not only insane acrobatics, but great detail, and a peek at the legendary Hitokiri Battousai.
The extras on this disk are fairly standard fare, but the main draw is the anime itself, and it doesn't dissappoint. A must own for any RK fan.",1070064000,6,1163,5.0
7933364,5,B000059H6J,"Every time I watch the opening credits for ""Rurouni Kenshin: Wandering Samurai"" in addition to trying to sing along with the original Japanese version of ""Freckles"" I note the irony that Himura Kenshin has not exactly been doing a lot of wandering in these episodes.  So when I suddenly noticed that the title of the series is now ""Rurouni Kenshin: Legend of Kyoto"" and ironically our hero might be returning to his wandering ways:
Episode 28, ""Prelude to the Impending Fight: The Shadow of the Wolf Draws Near"" begins with a scene from Kenshin's past, showing the Battousai earning his title of man-slayer.  One of the recurring elements of the series has been people from Kenshin's past showing up to pick a fight.  This time the visitor from the past is Saitou Hajime,  A former member of the Shinsengumi and his most formidable opponent form the days of the Revolution.  In his first effort to get the Battosai to resurface, Saitou attacks Sanosuke and wounds him the Gatotsu, Saitoh's signature attack.  From this calling card Kenshin knows that Saitoh has returned and the question is whether our hero still has the skills to defend himself and his friends.  This was actually the final episode of the first season, and since 28 is divisible by 4 you have to appreciate that they did not leave this as a cliffhanger ending to volume 7.
Episode 29, ""Strongest Opponent From the Past: Merciless Fangs Strike!"" has Saito biding his time before he faces Kenshin, allowing another assassin, the bully Akamatsu, to take his turn.  Meanwhile Kenshin's friends are catching on that someone is after him.  Akamatsu is not really a match for Kenshin, which means it is time for him to come face to face with Saito and for the battle to begin.
Episode 30, ""The Devil of Vengeance: Makoto Shishio's Plot"" continues the fight between Kenshin and Saito, while Kaoru worries she will lose Kenshin to the Battousai.  But at the height of the battle a new character arrives and changes everything as ""Rurouni Kenshin"" takes a dramatic turn towards an even larger story arc.
Episode 31, ""A Wish Unrequited: Kenshin Departs"" is where everything changes as an assassination attempt forces Kenshin to make a fateful decision.
The episode ends with a bit of text that had me panicing because I thought that I had reached the end of the series (I watched the end of ""Cowboy Bebop"" last week, so I would not have been suprised).  However, this is only the start of the second season of ""Rurouni Kenshin"" and the Kyoto story arc.  ""Shadow of the Wolf"" is actually the prelude for this epic story.  If you thought ""Rurouni Kenshin"" was good before, and that should be a given since you have made it to Volume 7, you should be impressed with how they have upped the ante again for Season 2.",1069027200,20,2769,4.719917012448133
7933365,5,B000059H6J,"This is the best Rurouni Kenshin DVD I ever got, because Saitou kicks alot of ... This was the greatest fight of all. Saitou is my favorite character of all! Saitou the third leader of the Shinsengumi could have whooped Kenshin's ... if he didn't turn into the battousai. But nobody won the battle. Theres a lot of violence here but too bad Cartoonnetwork only airs the edited version. But Saitou still should have won. I recommend you get this DVD. You don't want to miss the Kyoto arc episodes.",1068249600,,496,4.522222222222222
