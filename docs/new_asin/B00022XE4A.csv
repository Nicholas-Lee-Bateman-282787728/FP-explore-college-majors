2056883,3,B00022XE4A,"Well, this is not really my favorite Scooby movie. 2 1/2 stars seems more accurate to me, but I'll be generous. For those of you who follow my reviews, you know that I really liked ""Zombie Island,"" ""The Witch's Ghost,"" and ""Legend of the Vampire."" Now in all honesty this 7th chapter of Scooby Doo does have some good points. The animation is well done. And there is an interesting issue (fairly close to reality). I won't touch on whether the Loch Ness Monster really exists or not. But whether it does or doesn't, the situation is well drawn. Whenever there is a situation that involves some wonder that may or may not be, there are those in power who believe, those in power who don't believe, those who don't believe, but will use the possibility of it to make some money, there are the enthusiasts who believe with no ulterior motive, and there are the oppurtunists who are on the lookout for an oppurtunity to put something to immediate use. I can't call this 7th chapter one of my favorites. But I must admit it does grasp certain aspects of the unknown. That said, there is a fair amount of suspense. But the chemistry and flow of earlier movies like ""Zombie Island"" and ""Witch's Ghost"" just isn't there.  And the ending does lack the impact of earlier efforts. I can't say too much without ruining the movie. So, I'll conclude by saying it is at least an interesting watch. But it is not one of Scooby's better movies. Chapter 1 ""Zombie Island"" and Chapter 2 ""Witch's Ghost"" will probably always be the best. Chapter 8 ""Aloha Scooby Doo"" is actually a little better.",1114732800,5,1575,4.545774647887324
2056884,3,B00022XE4A,"Scooby Doo and the Monster of Mexico was no doubt the weakest of the modern Scooby Doo animated features. Loch Ness Monster is a considerable improvement.

This time the gang head off to Scotland to see the Highland Games and visit Blake castle, Daphne's ancestral home. And wouldn't you know, the castle happens to be in the 'quaint' fishing village of Drumnadrochit, on the shores of Loch Ness.

During their stay they meet a few interesting folks. First there is Fiona Pembrooke, a scientist who has drowned all of her money into finding the Loch Ness Monster.

Sir Ian Locksley, the boss of the National Heritage Museum of Scotland, he is staunch non-believer of Nessie.

The Haggarts, the own a cozy Inn on the shores of the loch. The sons are a couple of local jokers, always into mischief.

Del Chilman, a wild, paranoid hippie dude who is convinced the monster is out there and will stop at nothing on find her.

And finally, Duncan MacGubbin, the dock master who has seen Nessie too many times to count.

Most of these characters are stereotypes, which gets a bit annoying as this is teaching younger audiences a load of crap and giving the wrong impression. However if you can immune yourself to it you'll be alright. Being from Scotland I can't help but wince at the awfully mimicked Scottish accents. Fact: We DON'T sound like that.

Soon enough Nessie, looking rather more demonic than 'usual', shows up and causes havoc. Looks like the gang have another mystery on their hands. The usual chase scenes, clues and Shaggy's wacky disguises follow. There are plenty of laughs. The animation is splendid, with some atmospheric scenes and locations. And the plot a lot better than Monster of Mexico.

The only bad thing this time around is the music. I miss Louis Febre's scoring and the songs here are pretty rotten too. Where are the Hex Girls when you need 'em?

The region 2 DVD is in crystal clear 1.78:1 anamorphic widescreen (the region 1 ain't) with Dolby 5.0 sound. Some okay extras are included. Definitely worth getting.",1100304000,14,2039,4.7507082152974505
2056885,5,B00022XE4A,"This was the best Scooby movie so far it had it all action, adventure, mystery, and comedy! And most importanly it remained true to the original format with the monster being a fake, the DVD extras are also pretty good and it leaves you wanting to watch it over and over again! Trust me you will not be dissapointed. This is a definite have to buy film!!!",1092268800,12,355,4.313432835820896
2056886,1,B00022XE4A,"This one was really boring.  Only buy this if you are trying to collect all the Scooby DVDs or if you have a very young child.  Very young children might find this mildly entertaining.  This is not a movie for older kids/teenagers/adults who are fans of Scooby Doo.  I loved Scooby Doo: Zombie Island, Witch's Ghost, Alien Invaders, Cyberchase, and Legend of the Vampire.  If you want to get a good Scooby Doo DVD get those instead.  Scooby Doo and the Monster of Mexico was a huge disappointment too, but this was actually even worse.",1091923200,6,535,4.578947368421052
2056887,4,B00022XE4A,"Scooby and the gang go to Scotland to Daphne's cousin's castle at Blake Castle for the highland games.  The monster sightings in the beginning are very extravagant with it destroying whole sections of the castle as it chases Shaggy and Scooby when they look for a midnight snack.  Once the rest of the gang decides it is real, the sightings are a lot more normal.  My two year old asks for the ""bagpipe Scooby"" when he wants to watch it.  He and his little brother think it is a lot of fun to watch.  Other than the first sighting, it does not seem scarey at all.  It is perfect for the whole family.",1088640000,,600,4.265486725663717

They have watched it several times and keep asking to watch it more, but I don't want to burn them out on it so we moved back to some of the older ones to watch for now.  My kids really love Scooby Doo shows and are rarely disappointed so perhaps they are not the best ones to judge, but this one wasn't too scary and they watched it all the way to the end.  (My kids are usually pretty good about watching movies to the end, too, so if your kids have a tough time on a regular basis this one might be too long...)",1457049600,,653,3.9618320610687023

2056945,2,B00022XE4A,"Released in 2004, SCOOBY-DOO! AND THE LOCH NESS MONSTER is seventh in the feature length Scooby-Doo cartoon series created specifically for the home market.  This time around Scooby and the gang are in Scotland, where Daphnes cousin Shannon is hosting Highland Games at Blake Castle.  Unfortunately, the games seem to have attracted the interested of the Loch Ness Monster, which stages several attacks that threaten to derail the games.

I always like to point out that, while no one would accuse the Scooby Doo cartoons of being great art, they are usually well done and entertainingbut in this instance the operative word is usually.  MONSTER is a yawner.  The animation is mediocre, the pace drags, and the story is uninteresting.  One expects Scooby-Doo movies to be silly, but this movie is crammed with silliness without point or purpose, and when all is said and done SCOOBY-DOO! AND THE LOCH NESS MONSTER is easily among the worst in the series.  Unless you are determined to collect every title in the series, give this one a miss.

People always complain about the re-boots never meeting their expectations and how the classics are better but I'm just glad Scooby Doo gets the opportunity to resurface throughout the years and not fade away into history.

I prefer these types of cartoons compared to the new ones-which on TV are completely inappropriate for smaller kids.
