8217883,5,B000TPDKS0,"""Betrayal"" by Pinter is one of the finest, most informative and compelling films I have seen in my 40+ years of avid film watching.  The three principals, Hodge, Kingsley, & Irons, are among our very finest actors.  The production values are superb. It stands beside ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf"", ""Cat on a Hot Tin Roof"", ""The Little Foxes""  and ""All About Eve"" for detailed, complex rendering of difficult personal relationships.  Perhaps only John LeCarre has equaled it in recent times.  Every adult interested in intimate couple relationships, involving fidelity & betrayal, and personality evolution over time, will benefit from seeing it several times.
I have waited more than a decade for this film to be released in DVD format.  If someone or some company in its history will not lease their property rights to it, permitting it to be re-released, I hope they will come to their senses and act like a responsible adult, and allow it to be seen again as a DVD.  Anything less is immoral and a catastrophe to film lovers, another ""betrayal""!",1365811200,13,1051,4.903954802259887
