The hero carries one woman inside him, then another, and then, when he is with her, the first again. The film is compellingly acted and directed, the dialog so well written as to sharpen the mind, the score fabulously atmospheric. The result is hypnotic and poignant. Gobbi does some singing in mezza voce, something unusual for him. After I've seen the film, its story line, characters and music echo in me for some time. You can see Gobbi in a song from The Glass Mountain for free on the Bel Canto Society site--Stefan Zucker

Richard Fawkes, reviewing in Opera Now

"". . . the 1950 feature film starring Michael Denison as a composer who returns to Italy after the war to find inspiration. The film made an international star of Tito Gobbi who appears as an opera singing partisan. A wonderful, moving film.""",1336262400,3,917,4.654320987654321
8046516,2,B00079W8SG,"I bought this DVD with great expectations but came away feeling that I had been deceived by Amazon's description.  The firm turned out to be little more than an Italian ""soap opera"" of the type popular here at in that era.  The promise of an opera performance featuring ""...many well-known artists of the La Scala Opera House in Milan"".  I lived in Italy in the fifties and was quite familiar with the ""well-known artists"" who graced the stage of that historic house, as well known for the great artists who sang there are the unbelievably boorish behaving of the audience.  I did not recognize either voice or name of anyone in the brief opera scene, and not once did I hear the great Tito Gobbi sing anything resembling his reknowned operatic roles, either in the phony opera (allegedly based on Tschaikovsky's Fifth Symphony if you please or elsewhere in the film.  I felt that Amazon's description was intentially written to appeal to what the American audience would be attracted to and induced to buy the DVD.  In my mind, this is dishonest marketing, not worthy of Amazon.com.",1279324800,,1083,4.764705882352941
8046517,5,B00079W8SG,"First of all this film has the BEAUTIFUL ""Glass Mountain Theme"" by the famous movie composer Nino Rota.  The photography is beautiful with the scenes in the Italian Alps. The ""love story"" is very touching. The singing by Tito Gobbi is enjoyable also.  This old black and white movie is worth seeing.  The beautiful theme music plays a beautiful melody  while you see the skiers sillouetted on the white snow climbing the mountain searching for the lost hero;  this melody will stay with you for a long time after the film is over!
