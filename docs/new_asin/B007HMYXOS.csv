8516732,4,B007HMYXOS,"like the way how to do handle the veil step by step, I would like it more if would be more dances steps.",1423267200,,104,3.5652173913043477
8516733,3,B007HMYXOS,"I would give this video three and a half stars if I could. It runs for 137 minutes and only contains a brief performance, so most of it is dedicated to teaching. There is a nice warmup at the beginning, with some techniques I'd encountered before and a few new ones. The warmup concentrates on the arms and shoulders since veil work will exercise them a lot.

Sadie then demonstrates several different styles and types of veils. One nice thing about this DVD is that she actually uses all of them throughout the DVD. She explains here about how different fabrics-and different weights of fabric-behave differently, and about the advantages of having a veil with a distinct edge to grasp.

After that she covers some different veil wraps and several different ways of entering the stage.

The next several sections of the DVD cover basic veil work, spins and turns and two combinations. Most of them are based on swoops and figure 8s. She covers the chan turn with variations and the barrel turn. I thought the first combination was very nice and the second was okay, though I was able to follow along with it more easily.

There is a section on dynamic veil tricks which includes a small discussion on back bends, or rather pseudo-backbends, and finally the performance. The performance is rather short and, as one of the other Amazon reviewers pointed out, she wears the same fuschia practice outfit she wears throughout the DVD with the addition of a second hip scarf, so it is more of a demonstration of the basic veil principles she teaches.

I would say this DVD is best for beginners or advanced beginners with limited knowledge of veil work, or who want a veil instructional DVD for reference. Higher level dancers will probably find that they won't learn anything new from this video. A rank beginner could probably follow along pretty successfully since it doesn't really contain any non-veil-related belly dance moves and Sadie explains everything she does.
Sadie is a good teacher, and she is in front of a mirrored wall, which shows each move from both sides. She also turns to show the moves from other angles. Her instructions are clear and her lessons are designed to have students follow along with her.

The instructions don't cover all basic veil moves, especially with the dynamic veil tricks section. She covers a move she calls the ""Butterfly"" which I have heard called the ""Zorro"" elsewhere. There is another move I know called the ""Butterfly"" which involves using the veil like Isis wings. This move is not on the DVD.

Overall I would say this is a decent instructional DVD for students who want to learn the basics of veil work, but it is a little limited.",1362441600,3,2681,4.740343347639485
8516734,4,B007HMYXOS,I enjoy Sadie as much as many Belly dancers do.  I did enjoy the instructional video and how to use veils and her beautiful dancing.  My only complain is that for the price I paid for it the video should have been packaged in a plastic box rather than a thin cardboard box.  Other than the packaging it is great!,1348704000,,312,4.166666666666667
8516735,5,B007HMYXOS,"I think this is an excellent veil dvd for real practical veil work. I like it because it focuses more on ""dancing"" with the veil as opposed to learning tons of tricks or a choreographed stage piece. It does teach some great tricks and a short choreo/combo sequence, but I think it lends itself great to the dancer who works restaurants or improv dances a lot and just wants to be able to ""dance"" with the veil. If you want to learn a lot of stage worthy veil work, I recommend Sarah Skinner's veil dvd. Otherwise, this dvd is great for your everyday, veil work--improv, restaurant, for fun etc....Once again, a great dvd from Sadie!",1341446400,6,632,4.504347826086956

Performance:
I felt cheated with the performance section. The performance was too similar to the combination section and not really costumed like the dvd stated.  She was wearing the same outfit she used to teach only with an added hip scarf. I thought the performance would be performed by the outfit she wore on the front cover, with a complete new choreography.

  I got my dvd from hollywoodmusiccenter and the price was $24.99 +shipping and handling. I would say this dvd is for beginners and anyone who has not had any/little veil training. A lot of this information is covered in other DVD's. The background is the same background that she has been using in her other dvd's produced by hollywood musiccenter. She is front facing the viewer for a lot of the program. Sadie is an excellent teacher, every move and technique is broken down sufficiently. You can see her movement clearly, there are no weird camera angles, and the dvd is much like her other ones pretty straight forward and technical. If you order this as a beginner in veil work and work with it, there is no way you won't be proficient in the moves that were taught.

  The combo's were okay. I don't feel like it was to difficult to grasp and overall I felt the practice time on the dvd for each section was pretty decent. The dvd is over 2 hours of instructional length. Throughout the dvd she gives different pointers on dancing with the veil. Her combo's were a fairly good practice session of what she actually taught on the dvd. I like that she not only goes over a little of what she taught but she adds a few new moves in with the combo's. I do not own a lot of veil DVD'S and I would have to say that if you have a big veil dvd collection skip this. I have already ran into much the same material she presented on this dvd from those dvd's that I have.

Pro's
Decent practice lengths
Excellent break down of material

Con's
I cannot honestly say I learned a lot of new veil movements. The only new material I can honestly say I came in contact with, may have been a wrap or two and even those seemed to be variations of others I had learned. Everything else has been presented either in class or on dvd. Compared with the dvd's I do have this one is about in the middle range.
I felt like some of the veil work was a little frantic.
I was not a fan of a lot of the music that was used throughout the DVD, nor the ending performance.

This may be for you if:
You are new to veils
You want to clean up veil technique
You like Sadie's unique veil style
You wouldn't mind seeing some of the same material just taught in a different way.

This is not for you if:
You have a decent veil collection
You already know the basic veil movements
You want a more advanced veil DVD
You don't want to get a full DVD for one or two new veil tricks

Whether or not I think its completely worth it or not depends on the price, HMC offers through amazon and the level the dancer is at concerning veils. The DVD actually states that Sadie goes through veil basics to more advanced technique and I believe the DVD remained true to it intentions. I think this is an excellent DVD but if I had to choose between this and lets say Belly dance veil with Sarah Skinner I definitely would not hesitate in getting Sarah Skinner's.

Breakdown of material: 5
Utilization of time: 5

Content Compared to similar DVD's: 3
Content in general: 3 1/2

I really would like to give this DVD a 3 1/2. The content is not that original but I do like the practice session and material breakdown. Sooo.. is it worth it? Maybe!",1333238400,10,5144,4.497830802603037
