8264427,5,B00170IRXE,"Benigni made a wonderful exegesis of the Inferno, with a series of shows in a packed Piazza Santa Croce in Florence (it was also filmed on Italian TV). He made it very relevant to our days, and, being Benigni, very fun. The first 3 cantos are among the best.
I took an American college class on the Inferno, and I often shared in class Benigni's unique view (and well supported by the actual text). You have to know Italian because the show is really untranslatable.

Also, once I changed my computer to Region 2, it never let me again change to Region 1. I'll need to buy some other device to watch American stuff.",1419984000,,615,4.394736842105263

Roberto started some years ago doing appearances at universities etc and talking about Dante and pieces from the Inferno specifically - bringing explanations to Dante's Commedia that help people understand how amazing it is. I suspect that to many Italians being as they are force fed Dante in primary and secondary school, may not have that fond memories of him (a bit like Shakespeare in the English speaking countries). What Roberto manages to convey with his pure energy and sincerity of excitement and love of Dante is the beauty and mystery of the Commedia.

So in 2006 Benigni delivered on a nightly basis the first ten Cantos of the Inferno, 26, 33 and the final canto of Paradiso - to very large live audiences in the Piazza Santa Croce in Florenece - beneath the watchful eye of Enrico Pazzi's beautiful statue of Dante (love that eagle!).
If you understand Italian these are just amazing expositions on Dante's work and you can plainly see the audience's interest, respect and appreciation for Benigni's delivery.
Each DVD in the series is devoted to a Canto and runs for about an hour or so, most of the time is spent walking through the Canto line by line and unpacking the subtleties and references to mythology, the Bible, Virgil's Aeneid or whatever and ending with Benigni reciting the Canto from memory (they are meant to be heard in recitation!).  He brings alive Dante's incredible mastery of what is now really modern Italian, and his skill to beautifully capture images/ideas so succinctly (e.g. Amor, ch'a nullo amato amar perdona, Inf V 103)- see if you can unravel that one.

Benigni has followed through in 2012 doing up to Canto 22(?)in the same format but these are not yet available in a DVD format tho some are circulating on the net as they were all later televised by RAI2 TV.
He finished off the whole Inferno this year 2013, and as yet these have not been televised.

So Benigni has completed delivering his expositions on the entire Inferno. Some purists berate him for 'popularising' the work but its one man's view and by and large I think it's fairly true to the intent (but what would I know). I believe the Italians themselves are truly appreciative for his efforts - he is I think to them a living treasure.

This 3 DVD pack is the first part of the full 2006 cycle and the others can be found here on Amazon who organised delivery for me through an Italian outlet.",1379894400,2,2538,4.707207207207207
