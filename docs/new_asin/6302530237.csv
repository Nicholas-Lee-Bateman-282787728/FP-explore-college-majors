477816,4,6302530237,Good early 70's mystery thriller with amusing moments.  Has something of the look of a made-for-TV movie.  A racing car driver develops psychic abilities and a young woman with expertise in that area helps him interpret what the visions he has mean.  They end up at a mansion in England to save a woman being menaced by mysterious incidents.  The movie has some atmospheric moments.  The actors do an OK job.  Leonard Nimoy and Susan Hampshire do their mystery solving like they were an adult Hardy Boy and Nancy Drew.  Still pretty good film.  The Scorpion Releasing DVD has the US and the UK versions and is in excellent condition.  Recommended.,1400371200,,647,4.756756756756757

477818,3,6302530237,"TV movie about a race car driver who suddenly gains the power of ESP and gets involved in a murder mystery. Since it is a TV Movie, there is nothing offensive, even though Scorpion Releasing offers us the shorter British version and longer American version. I would like to see more early-70's TV movies get released, so buy this one and make it happen.",1396137600,,353,4.53125

477820,3,6302530237,"If you are a fan of 70s-era made-for-TV horror, this will fit the bill nicely. Nimoy plays a race car driver who inexplicably starts getting psychic premonitions, which lead him to mysterious goings on at an old English castle. He brings a plucky blonde paranormal expert along for the ride. A bit X-files meets Scooby Doo at the Night Gallery. And a GREAT atmospheric soundtrack. Unfortunately the transfer is a big disappointment. You'll see distracting, blocky MPEG compression artifacts frequently (even the highest setting of noise-reduction on my TV didn't help...) and occassional horizontal tracking lines, suggesting this was sourced from tape. That said, it is a WATCHABLE transfer... comparable to some of the crappy multi-disc/public domain box sets you might find in the bargain bin.",1391212800,13,796,5.325396825396825
477821,3,6302530237,"I love this movie, but not this version (Amazon instant Video).  I had it on video that I took off the TV and watched so many times I knew the dialogue by heart.  Having not seen it for many years (haven't had a VCR for many years), on impulse I decided to buy it to watch on my computer. So many scenes have been shortened that if I didn't know the dialogue, I'd never be able to fully follow the story.  So while its dated by the wardrobe, the movie has held up for me.  But not this butchered version.",1369699200,3,504,4.01
477822,4,6302530237,"Baffled! was a 1973 TV movie/pilot made in the UK distributed by ITC (The Muppet Show, Space:1999). It was also shown theatrically in some places. In the early 80's it was released to video by 20'th Century Fox video. Since then it was out of print until the mid 90's when it was released on another label recorded in EP. It also was edited compared to the 20'th Century Fox video version (I estimate the editing at about 5 minutes). That video is also now out of print. Now, Baffled can be streamed from Amazon, but alas has the most recent master which is the one that was used for that video and carries the edits. Still a worthy movie to check out, but I wish it was complete.",1333152000,7,680,4.27906976744186

477904,4,6302530237,"I ordered this right after Leonard died.......as a massive original Trek fan, it truly is hard to see him in any other role.  I can see why he was so frustrated in his career after Star Trek became legendary.  I immediately recognized during the movie titles of Baffled that it was a pilot for a proposed TV series, in which Nimoy would use his ESP powers to solve crimes every week, along with his British female sidekick.  The story wasn't bad.......but most of my enjoyment was due to the early 70's flavor of it all, which feeds me comforting nostalgia for my youth.  Anyhow, for whatever reasons, I liked it.",1426896000,7,613,4.545454545454546
477905,4,6302530237,Very enjoyable TV Pilot that ran as a TV movie on TV like so many Pilot's. Watch the UK Version that has been remastered. The U.S. version is longer but poor quality.,1420070400,,166,4.21875

477908,4,6302530237,"Great 70's tv pilot staring the one and only Leonard Nimoy.  A fairly preposterous plot, and though I can see all the flaws of this production I still really enjoyed it as I love shows from this era.  I'm a Star Trek TOS fan as well, so it's really fun to see Nimoy in a different role.  If you enjoy TV shows and movies from the 70's, I do think you will like this.  Enjoy some Nimoy!

477909,5,6302530237,"Just finished watching ""Baffled!""
""Baffled!"" was the pilot for a potentially great supernatural mystery series that was unfortunately never made.
""Baffled!"" centers around Thomas Chester Kovack [Leonard Nimoy], a race car driver who has a vision of an English manor house and a woman and her daughter who are in some kind of deadly danger after a nearly fatal wreck on a race track. Pronouced dead at the scene, Kovack surprises everyone by coming around and climbing out of his car.
Later on a late night talk show, Kovack disarmingly describes the vision he saw, which catches the attetnion of rare bookseller Michelle Brent [Susan Hampshire]. A student of the occult, Michelle is convinced that Kovack's vision is a real one and that its up to them to save the mother and daughter from harm.
Kovack, though impressed that Michelle tracked him down to his apartment - she called in a favor to get his address, thinks she's just a cute, but kooky chick - this is the 70s remember - until she convinces him to draw the manor house and when he does, she shows him a photo of the house from a book on English manor houses that she has in her purse.
Still unconvinced, Kovack wishes Michelle a safe trip back to England, and is just about to take a shower when he has another vision of the hosue and of him falling off a cliff into the sea - after he's released from the vision, Kovack finds himself on the floor, drenched in salt-water.
Now its Kovack who tracks down Michelle in England, and together they book rooms in the manor house, where Kovack sees the mother and daughter in the vision.
Kovack and Michelle unravel the mystery which appears to be motivated by money; but has ominious supernatural overtunes....there is a mysterious pendant that represents a wolf cult that would have been a major theme in a series that would have been spun off from this pilot.
PUN ALERT!
It's baffling why ""Baffled!"" was never made into a series. Kovack and Michelle [Nimoy and Hampshire] are a likeable team with believable onscreen chemistry. My suspicion is that it all came down to money - while there are no real special effects except for the psychic visions of Kovack - I suspect the European locations would not have made this a profitable television series for the bean counters at ITC.
""Baffled!"" could now be spun off into an audio series. My first choice; if someone would spin it off into audio, would be ""The Colonial Radio Theater. I can easily hear Jerry Robbins in the role of Thomas Chester Kovack.
HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!
A GREAT SUPERNATURAL MYSTERY!
FIVE STARS!",1408579200,2,2569,4.685840707964601

477911,5,6302530237,I remember  watching Baffled when it  appeared on TV. Great film. Its  clear that  this  was a pilot  for a series. One  has a choice  of  seeing  either  the  US (longer) or the British (shorter). I like the  movie and  recommend getting it.,1405036800,,242,4.325581395348837
477912,4,6302530237,"I enjoyed this for what it was: a failed television pilot from 1972. Taking into account the era in which it was filmed, it's quite fun.  Despite being a supernatural thriller, there aren't much in the way of special effects to be distracted by: most of it is make-up / in-camera effects. The most glaring ""wow, look how far we've come"" moments are when Nimoy is being the wheel of a vehicle (his race car at the start, and a nicely-restored oldster later in the movie) and when anyone falls out of a window or off a cliff (which, between visions and actual events, happens at least 3 times that I counted). Otherwise, the mood is set by the set lighting, the actors, the wardrobe and the make-up.  It's amateur-looking by modern standards, but I ignored that and just had a good time watching it.

Concept wise, I'm really surprised this concept hasn't been picked up for a remake in more recent years. Given the plethora of supernatural shows on television (mostly on the CW, but also on the major networks) as well as the number of ""charming lead man investigates crimes"" shows, I would think someone would have revived it.

Cast-wise: Nimoy is a charming and engaging leading man who despite the evidence around him is still not sure he's actually gained supernatural abilities until the very end of the episode. The visions are his only ability, so he still needs to think/fight his way out of tight spots the way anyone else would. Susan Hampshire is equally as engaging as Michele Brent, and there's a definite playful chemistry between the actors that makes the blooming romance between Kovack and Michele believable. The rest of the cast are listed as ""guest stars"" as they would be on a regular television episode. Vera Mills is perfect as Andrea Glenn, the US actress on British soil who is the intended victim of a convoluted scheme to kill her off and gain control of her daughter Jennifer (played with wonderfully eerie self-possession by Jewel Blanch). Rachel Roberts is great as hotel owner Mrs Farraday, just this side of over-the-top as she reverse-ages through the episode. And of course every British drama has to have a Grande Dame -- Valerie Taylor does a solid job as the mysterious Louise Sanford.

Plot-wise: Well, the show has a great concept but there are some unavoidable plot holes and otherwise cheesy moments. Italian houseguest Verelli's knowledge of the secret door to the wine cellar felt like it came out of nowhere, as did Michele's knowledge of the ""special sign"" Kovacks needed to use toward the end of the episode.  During Kovack's ""near-fatal"" car crash at the start, the paramedic's attempts at CPR, while Kovack is still in the race car in a seated position, are laughably fake. And just who was driving the beat-up old van that follows Kovack and Michele on their little afternoon joy ride? The director assumes we'll figure it out. There are some continuity issues with what time of day things are happening. And there's a great Mission: Impossible-like moment near the end as well that's just ... well, I laughed because it felt so out of place.

I watched the 89 minute ""UK Cut"" of the pilot. The disc also includes a US cut that is 10 minutes longer, but I haven't had time to screen that. If/when I do, I might come back and add some thoughts to this post. Especially if some of those plot holes are filled in.",1404086400,4,3358,4.68135593220339

I caught it when it originally aired and saw it maybe once again a few years later, and I remembered a lot of it as I was watching it, but not enough to keep it from being fresh. I watched the full US version. I think it's mostly Nimoy playing himself, his portrayal of Tom is like his portray of Paris in Mission: Impossible when the character lets his hair down. It's sad that this lovely man is gone from us, but I'm grateful for all his interesting roles and that he had happiness, lived long and prospered.
