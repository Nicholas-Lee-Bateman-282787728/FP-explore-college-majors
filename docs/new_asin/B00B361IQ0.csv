8562068,2,B00B361IQ0,"When it comes to wrestling, 1995 is often billed as the worst year in the WWF. Wrestlemania XI is a primary example of what made 1995 their worst year. The build-up for most of these matches was mediocre but the PPV itself was even more mediocre. Boring, vanilla, and whatever other synonyms you can think of for boring, describe this Wrestlemania to a T. Here's my review of a rather forgettable Wrestlemania

In the late 80s and early to mid 90s, WWF always had many guest celebrities appear at Wrestlemania but Wrestlemania XI had perhaps the most celebrities to date.  Pamela Anderson, Jenny McCarthy, Jonathon Taylor, Thomas Nicholas, Turturro, Salt n Pepa, Lawrence Taylor, Reggie White, Ken Norton Jr., Chris Spielman, Carl Banks, Steve McMichael, and Larry Young

1.) The Allied Powers (Lex Luger and The British Bulldog) vs The Blu Brothers (Eli and Jacob) w/Uncle Zebekiah

The competitors in this match moved around pretty slowly at times and there were a few sloppy moves here and there. Only noteworthy thing about this match is that Uncle Zebekiah (now today known as Zeb Colter) managed the Blu Brothers in this match. Bulldog wins the match with a sunset flip pin on one of the twins. I couldn't tell if it was Eli or Jacob. Both men had so much hair over their face and scraggly beards, I couldn't tell which one was which.

2.) Intercontinental Championship Match: Jeff Jarrett (c) w/The Roadie vs Razor Ramon w/1-2-3 Kid

Right before the match began, Razor's pyro went off late making things kind of awkward. The match overall was very decent. Ramon and Jarrett were technical grapplers who seemed to mix well in the ring. The match ends with Razor getting a DQ victory after The Roadie (aka Road Dogg) interfered and attacked him. This match was pretty decent overall, it felt a little overbooked at times. It did tell a decent story though with a solid pace.

3.) King Kong Bundy w/Ted Dibiase vs The Undertaker w/Paul Bearer

This was all a grudge match about a stolen urn. Kind of stupid, right? This was yet another slow moving match---as were most Undertaker matches that pitted him with giants like Yokozuna and King Kong Bundy. Kama (aka The Godfather) interfered in the match and stole the urn away from Paul Bearer, who had taken it back from Ted Dibiase, and said he was going to melt the urn into a chain. Undertaker gets the win around the 6 minute mark with a flying clothesline. No Chokeslam, no Tombstone Piledriver. I guess something like that would've been too believable, despite that Undertaker is supposed to be someone with supernatural powers.

4.) Tag Team Championship Match: Owen Hart and Yokozuna w/Jim Cornette and Mr. Fuji vs The Smoking Gunns (c) (Billy and Bart Gunn)

The basis behind this match was that Owen Hart had earned a Tag Team Title match against The Smoking Gunns but had a mystery partner. His mystery partner turned out to be Yokozuna. Owen's original partner was supposed to be Jim ""The Anvil"" Neidhart but he got released due to some heated issues he was having with himself and WWF at the time, so Yokozuna replaced him. This was a pretty enjoyable match to say the least. Owen and Yokozuna meshed well as a Tag Team, as did the Gunns who displayed a nice variety of Tag Team moves. Yokozuna ends up squashing Billy and Owen comes in, picking up the scraps and gets the pinfall win. Nice Tag Team match for the PPV. I think Owen and Yokozuna were a nice unit together

5.) I Quit Match: Bob Backlund vs Bret Hart

Rowdy Roddy Piper was introduced as the special referee for the match which was the second Bret Hart match for the second Wrestlemania in a row that Piper was refereeing. On to the match. Oh gosh, the match. Bret Hart dubbed this as being one of his worst matches ever. Seriously. Read his book and you'll see. It's easy to see why he said this. As much as they tried to make it work, the spark wasn't there. They both receive gold stars for putting forth the effort to give themselves and the fans a good match but it just flopped. Their Survivor Series bout was 100x better. As Bret also mentioned, it was funny to see Piper shove the microphone in their face whenever a submission was locked on asking ""What do ya say!?"" You could even hear a few of the fans sitting in the front row laugh at times. Bret ends up winning, using Backlund's Chicken Wing Crossface. I'm sure Bret, Backlund, Piper, and the fans were all glad when this one ended

6.) WWF Championship Match: Shawn Michaels w/Jenny McCarthy and Sid vs Diesel (c) w/Pamela Anderson

All night long, the question surrounding the PPV was, where was Pamela Anderson?? She ended up being found, escorting Diesel to the ring, although it was originally supposed to be Shawn Michaels. This was probably the best match on the card. Things started out fast-paced. Lets not forget about Shawn selling Diesel's moves to perfection! At times during the match they would show shots of Pamela and Jenny looking bored and not even remotely interested in the match. (McMahon must've paid them a fortune to make them sit out there). Things slow down mid-way and fans end up flip flopping on sides between Michaels and Diesel. Diesel ends up hitting a botched Jackknife, thanks to Michaels at the end, (which looked like Shawn purposely botched), for the win. After the match, Diesel brought Pamela, Jenny, Nicholas Turturro, and Jonathan Taylor in the ring to celebrate with him. It's ashame that this match wasn't the main event. It deserved to be.

7.) Bam Bam Bigelow vs Lawrence Taylor

This match certainly got a lot of media attention leading up to Wrestlemania and it would all pay off on this night. Prior to the match, Ted Dibiase's Million Dollar Corporation came down to be in Bigelow's corner, while the New York Giants came out to support Lawrence Taylor. I'm sure most people expected this match to be an utter flop but it surprisingly delivered in most aspects. Seeing Lawrence Taylor actually perform well in the wrestling ring was impressive. Both Taylor and Bigelow put forth a good performance and in the end L.T gets the win with a flying shoulder block off the turnbuckle. Some say it was the worst main event in Wrestlemania history (Hogan vs Sid anybody?) and others say it was good. I didn't think it was too bad but it definitely should not have closed the PPV over Shawn Michaels vs Diesel

__________________________________

Overall: 1 or 2 good matches is not good enough to put this PPV anywhere above 2 stars. Wrestlemania 11 turned out to be disaster. I'm pretty sure everyone sitting in the arena that night, regretted every buying ticket to go. I wonder how VHS sales did when the PPV came out. Taking place at the Hartford Civic Center in Hartford, Connecticut, Vince was probably trying to give something back to his home state, when in reality he probably should of just gave them a refund after it was over. Without a doubt, Wrestlemania 11 may be one of the Top 5 Worst Wrestlemanias of all time making it on either 2 or #3. Diesel vs Michaels and Taylor vs Bigelow save Wrestlemania XI from being 1 star rather than 2",1394755200,,7590,4.86811481768813
8562069,2,B00B361IQ0,"A couple of notes here in that this is the exact same version of this event taken from the WrestleMania Anthology set meaning that all references to ""WWF"" & various music has been changed to due the rights expiring but there is no blurring of the WWF logo since this event happened before the ""Attitude Era.""  It should be noted that the Salt-N-Pepa performance of ""Whatta Man"" has been removed.

WrestleMania comes from the home state of WWE Headquarters in Connecticut at the Hartford Civic Center.  Celebrities involved with the show included Larry Young, Nicholas Turturro, Johnathan Taylor Thomas, Jenny McCarthy, and Pamela Anderson while various football players were part of the All-Star team for the main event such as Ken Norton Jr., Chris Spielman, Rickey Jackson, Carl Banks, Reggie White, and Steve McMichael.  This event also featured the WrestleMania debuts of various superstars & legends like Sean ""1-2-3 Kid"" Waltman, ""Road Dogg"" Jesse James, Jeff Jarrett, and Billy Gunn.

Ten years after Mr. T was in the main event of the first WrestleMania, another celebrity steps into the main event looking for revenge for the disrespect shown to him by a WWE superstar in NFL legend Lawrence Taylor vs. Bam Bam Bigelow in a match that also saw Ted Dibiase's ""Million $ Corporation"" & L.T.'s ""All-Pro Team"" on the outside as well resulting in a match that was way better than expected going in.  WWE Champion Diesel faced off against the man who brought him into the WWE in Shawn Michaels who also had his new bodyguard by his side in Sid in what was definitely a ""Shawn Michaels"" highlight reel.  Other matches include Bret Hart vs. Bob Backlund in an ""I Quit"" match with Roddy Piper as the referee, Owen Hart & Yokozuna challenging Tag Team Champions Smokin' Gunns, Undertaker vs. King Kong Bundy, Razor Ramon with 1-2-3 Kid in his corner vs. Intercontinental Champion Jeff Jarrett with Roadie in his corner, and Allied Powers vs. Blu Brothers.

WWE has really in a slump during this period as they were heavily concentrated on making a new Hulk Hogan out of Diesel but it just wasn't working out as Shawn completely overshadowed him in their match while people had their mixed feelings on the heavy involvement of the celebrities including L.T. in the main event to draw an audience over the wrestlers themselves plus the undercard wasn't anything special or memorable with Bret vs. Backlund didn't come close to their previous encounters as was the same case with Razor vs. Jarrett when compared to their Royal Rumble match.  In the end, this was an easily forgettable WrestleMania when it was all said & done and should only be bought only if adding to your collection.",1364688000,2,2682,4.864035087719298
