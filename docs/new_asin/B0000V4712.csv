1948463,4,B0000V4712,"I had rather low expectations for this first-ever appearance of Horace Rumpole, but I was pleasantly surprised to see how well developed the Rumpole character was right from the get-go. Many of the hallmarks of the long running series are here: She Who Must Be Obeyed, the Penge Bungalow Murders, frequent recitations of Wordsworth, corrupt detective inspectors, and small cigars. Even son Nick makes an appearance (although he's in a bit of a foul mood). The only thing I found jarring was Rumpole's initial attempt to get his client to plead guilty, something the later Rumpole would never do. Still, Leo McKern nails the part right out of the chute, which makes this episode a fine introduction to John Mortimer's beloved barrister.
The ""special features"" on the DVD are mostly worthless, but the real reason you're buying this is to see an episode of Rumpole you've probably never seen before. That alone is worth the price.",1079395200,76,928,4.955128205128205

1948465,4,B0000V4712,"Not the best episode of Rumpole of the Bailey, but if you have the entire collection you should have this one as it is the pilot for the series.",1409529600,,144,4.0
1948466,3,B0000V4712,"For a long time fan of the Rumpole series, this ""Lost"" first episode is a great set completer. John Mortimer and the ""old Bailey Hack"" Horace Rumpole were made for each other. If this will be your first look into what became a winning BBC/Mystery lite entertainment, be aware. Do not let the uneven script and a too dark tone keep you from seeing how this, lead to the much better that. What you will see is the programmatic equivalent of peeking through the construction safety fence at an almost finished architectural gem.

Rumpole and the Confession of Guilt was originally broadcast in 1975 as a single production, in the Play for Today in 1975.  I agree with those who felt that this Rumpole was not ready.  The basic plot is consistent with the later broadcast versions. Rumpole is to defend a young black boy who is accused of an unprovoked knife assault on a white male. There is a signed confession but is it legitimate? Meantime Rumpole is worn down by a life in the criminal courts and is losing his relationship with his son, even as the boy is about to start graduate school in America.

John Mortimer was made to portray the aging, cynical defender of the minor league unsavory. In this version you can see the actor very nearing saving the script and the directing. It was not his fault that this episode suffers for lack of the Rumpole twinkle and the escapades of the supporting cast of Chambers that will enliven the later show.
Joyce Heron as ""She Who Must be Obeyed"", Wife, Hildegard, seems vague, possibly drink addled and hardly commanding. Their son, played by David Yelland is in this broadcast, sour and accusatory. Mr. Yelland will keep this role in future episode but loose much of the edge.

As suggested, this program is too dark, sour and unpleasant. The Rumpole most of us would come to enjoy took its shots at the ""Justice system"" and the cares of the old Bailey Hack. The difference is one of overall lightness of tone. Rarely laugh out Loud funny the mature Rumpole episodes could be wry and fun with just enough depth to appeal to a thoughtful viewer. Confession of Guilt is a valued completer for my collection, but newbies can consider themselves warned.",1391040000,2,2192,4.639175257731959

1948472,5,B0000V4712,A great addition to my Rumpole collection and makes it complete. The early Rumpole was a treat to watch and observe how it was the pattern for the series. Thoroughly enjoyable.,1360800000,,176,4.709677419354839
1948473,5,B0000V4712,"this so called 'lost episode' is in point of fact the Pilot to the tv series. Mortimer wrote this for Play for Today. it was later picked up and became a series. I highly recomend this for any true fan of Rumpole and Mckern.

now again when seeing this you must think of it as a pilot. Mortimer is still working things out. oh McKern and Rumpole is pretty much the same as we see in the series. he still quotes Wordsworth, smokes small cigars, and so forth. i would say the elements surrounding his life are slightly different here then in the series. Hilda, She Who Must Be Obeyed, here played by Joyce Heron. (later played by Peggy Thorpoe-Bates and also Marion Mathie). here she is a bit more of a shrew, at times not very happy, and seems to drink alot. she is, however, very supportive of Rumpole at the end. Rumpole's son, Nick, played by David Yelland, who would play the same role in the series, is in a foul mood in this outing. he seems to be unhappy with both family life and how Rumpole acts in court. somewhat different then the Nick we see in the series. now we do not get to see the whole crew at number 3 Equity court, that would come with the series. the closest thing is Rumpole's friend, named George, played by John Byron. There would be a George Frobiser in the series, played by Moray Watson. other then the first name and the love of crosswords the similarity ends there. it may also surprise some Rumpole viewers that he is willing to plead guilty.

again it must be remembered that this is just the first outing. the basics of Rumpole are pretty much set, so to the story and Mckern's acting. a few things are changed and altered when the series is in full swing. but this sets the stage. i would still recomend this to any Rumpole fan. it is the first outing and it's a good story. all the action takes mainly in the Old Baily here. but it's a good story and a nice little mystery. everything that you would expect from a Rumpole story. now this story takes place in 1974, as stated verbily by Rumpole. so if you must place it within the context of the series then i would say it takes place between, Rumpole and the Alternative Society set in 1970 and Rumpole and the Honorable Member set in 1974. it defitly takes place before Honorable Member as there Nick is engaged and prepared to stay in America. here he is studying in America and obviously not yet engaged.

all in all this is a fun first outing, well worth viewing. both for story and Mckern. a nice pilot for what would become a grand series.",1354233600,,2529,4.32
1948474,5,B0000V4712,"We love this series--fantastic!  The acting is supherb.  Such a cozy, intimate, well-written script with plots that twist and turn, dotted with comic relief interwoven throughout the scenes!  Received the DVDs with the speed of light and in great condition.  A touch of agenda would surface relating to the politics of the day in England, when the DVDs were being produced.  Rumpole of the Bailey is classic in every way.",1346371200,,421,4.957142857142857
1948475,4,B0000V4712,Being a big Rumpole fan I always wanted to see where it all started. This DVD is the first appearance of the old fellow and is more raw than his later TV series. It has Rumpole pretty much as he will be througout the series but his wife and son are different and not up to par as the actors who portrayed them later. Also the production values were a little weak and did detract somewhat from my enjoyment of the program.(that's why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5) That being said though it is still good entertainment and the writing is great. For any fan of Rumpole I think this is a must have to complete their collection.,1334534400,,625,4.1735537190082646
1948476,4,B0000V4712,"This one will be of interest to all fans of the Rumpole of the Bailey series as it was the pilot which initially introduced Leo McKern's interpretation of the character to the world. Although initially John Mortimer was not enthusiastic about McKern in the role, after watching him in rehearsal he became enthusiastic about the choice of Leo McKern as Horace Rumpole.

The stand-alone pilot which was presented on December 17, 1975, was such a big success that plans were later made to create a series based on these stories by John Mortimer. The first of the series aired on April 3, 1978 when a series of six episodes was broadcast with great success.

It is interesting to see how well developed the character is in this initial episode, many of the character traits we were to later associate with Rumpole are present in this pilot. One difference I noted was a more serious introspective Rumpole; the later series was lighter hearted and displayed a Rumpole that could find the humorous side of a situation with considerable ease. This was probably a wise decision in the characterization of Rumpole.

The story is well done and displays all of the ingenuity that was to become so typical of Rumpole's defense of his clients in the later series; a happy addition to the collection of any fan of Rumpole of the Bailey.",1317859200,4,1322,4.739130434782608
1948477,5,B0000V4712,"This dvd turned out to offer a far better story than my wife and I had imagined.  We always enjoyed the old Rumpole series when it was on TV, 20+ years ago.  So, when we decided to order the dvd anthology, this piece came up as an Amazon suggestion.  At first, I thought it a bit pricey but went ahead anyway.  I'm very glad I did.

The only downside of the dvd is that it doesn't offer subtitles so you can follow the British slang and idiom.  But the story and acting of this 1975 pilot for the Rumpole series (1978-92) are topnotch.  Beware to Rumpole fans.  This is not a comedy, although there are humorous and sardonic bits along the way.  When Rumpole's son, Nick, is introduced, we expect him to idolize his brilliant father.  But no, he disapproves of the way Horace argues cases to get criminals to go free. The only person who could write such a thing would be someone like John Mortimer who himself was a barrister in the Old Bailey.

Other reviewers have found fault with the actress playing Hilda, Rumpole's wife.  True, she is not as amusing and engaging as the two who followed her in the part.  But she does OK, as ""she who must be obeyed.""  Other characters are also portrayed well, including the uptight judge, police inspector, and public prosecutor.  These people just become putty in Rumpole's hands as he appeals to the jury to find his client innocent.  He does so in the end in a most unexpected way.

Summing up, this is a first-rate story of Horace Rumpole with all his faults and foibles.  But with his knowledge of the law and how to plead a case that no one can match.  If you enjoy the other Rumpole stories don't fail to get this one.  It has to be in his top five.  Highly recommended.",1317340800,2,1718,4.356466876971608
1948478,4,B0000V4712,This was the pilot of the later full TV series. Good but not as good as the series that followed which were pretty uniformly excellent. So if you haven't watched any of the Rumpole start with the main series. If you really enjoy Rumpole you will want to come back to this to see how it all started.,1316304000,,298,4.155172413793103
1948479,4,B0000V4712,Fascinating first invocation of Rumpole.  More stagey than the series; and She Who Must Be Obeyed is a lush ....,1309392000,,112,4.6
1948480,4,B0000V4712,"This 'lost episode' of Rumpole of the Bailey is an interesting prelude to the familiar series that followed.  Horace Rumpole has burst fully formed from the head of Justitia.  Leo McKern's portrayal was a fully realized creation from the beginning.
If this Rumpole seems a bit 'off' at times it is because the characters around him had not jelled in to the well-known portrayals we are used to in this show.  The wife in this episode is terrible, a real low-class shrew, unlike the endearingly  gruff Peggy Thorpe-Bates and the hilarious Marion Mathies later on.  Rumpole's son is on the scene as well in this early episode only his character is grumpy, judgmental and humorless.

The scenes down at the Old Bailey are best.  The minor characters he interacts with there are the usual high standard of character actors playing the Judge, the prosecuting attorney, the bar maids, police etc.  The script is good but not in the same league as the mainstay of the episodes over the next few years.  A fine start to a glorious career for Rumpole.

The sound is slightly dim but it always was.  People who have grown up with and are used to the blasting soundtracks in mega-complex theater barns probably will have a hard time hearing the words on this dvd.  But then, they probably have trouble hearing just about anything that isn't wall vibratingly loud.  The sound and the picture are vintage English television from the 1970s and are just fine.

Highly recommended for Rumpole lovers and appreciators of good television.",1288396800,5,1520,4.818532818532819
1948481,5,B0000V4712,"The viewers of the Rumpole series see a witty barrister who uses his tongue and his wit to defend underprivileged.  Rarely does he miss a beat.  Yet, the Rumpole we see in this pilot shows a vulnerability and a sensitivity that is masked in the regular series.  That is what makes this a terrific last episode to see.  In fact, the program is both an introduction and a summary of RUMPOLE, OF THE BAILEY.",1281139200,,404,4.418918918918919

1948484,5,B0000V4712,"One of the most influential and best television courtroom dramas of all time began with this story.  ""Play for today"" was a popular show in the U.K. for many years and each episode had a new story about various subjects and themes.  These weren't stage plays however and that may be misleading to some viewers; they were solid tv shows and that is what this was.  It introduced Rumpole to the world and it should have been put on season ones boxset because even if the show started later this is the real pilot for it.  This still fits in with the series which has better character development because it ran for more episodes. But many pilots are rougher and ideas , characterizations and  storyline direction don't gell perfectly until later.  This deserves five stars for Rumpole fans and four for those who haven't seen any Rumpole. Thankfully I got this off amazon.com where it's cheaper so that was a added bonus.  For those new to Rumpole you should buy season one and two in their boxset and then grab this pilot to see where it started.  The later episodes are much better but even a pilot episode like this is far better than many other series fare. And best of all we get to see the great Leo Mckern's first stab at Rumpole; a character he is so identified with but one should remember that he acted excellently in many types of roles throughout his long career.",1257033600,,1373,4.508064516129032
1948485,5,B0000V4712,Rumpole fans will like this lost episode. Both seller and movie are first rate. Highly recommended,1245715200,,98,5.1875
1948486,3,B0000V4712,"Lovers of Rumpole will agree that there is no such thing as a bad Rumpole story.  This, the first, is probably the worst.  However, we see that Leo McKern has already taken the measure of the character he portrays and made it his own.  John Mortimer wrote the rest of his Rumpole stories so that Leo was a perfect fit.

We expect to see Rumpole more rotund and with hair more gray, but we accept that here is a slightly younger, but still wise, version of our favorite barrister.

The price for the DVD is excessive; but what are Rumpole lovers to do?  We must pay because WE MUST HAVE IT!",1222992000,,589,4.261261261261262

1948488,5,B0000V4712,"When Rumpole of the Bailey was first screened on Australian television many years ago my partner and I thoroughly enjoyed the series.  I had been searching for any of the episodes for quite some time in Australian stores but never saw it on the shelves.  When I asked about the series, either the sales person hadn't heard of it or I was advised that it wasn't available.  So it was with great delight that I found I could order the series from Amazon.  It's a fantastic series - albeit some of the scenes a little ""dated"" in this day and age but Rumpole is a most intriguing and entertaining character.

1948490,5,B0000V4712,"The Rumpole series is a great example of British humor.  While it takes a little time and some effort to enjoy Rumpole, the effort will bear fruit after only the first few episodes.  Having all of the series in one package allowes the viewer to watch the actors grow into their roles.  Then, as John Mortimer points out, the roles begin to be tailored to the outstanding skills of the actors and the viewers experience becomes even more enjoyable.  The main benefit is having all the shows available and not having to wait a week between showns and months between seasons.  Well worth the price.",1143072000,8,595,4.628571428571429

Unfortunately, ""She who must be obeyed"" is barely recognizeable as herlater character; which is to the good. The element of saddness is that Rumpole is so wrapped into his own life at the Bailey that he is oblivious to the fact that his son not only does not share his interest but strongly resents the Bailey as a rival for his father' attention and love. The disappointment is that Rumpole who is so perceptive in so many areas of life (which revolve around the Old Bailey) that he is oblivious to his son's true feelings. Even when his son confronts him and spells out his hostility, Rumpole is able to go on and continue with the lie that he and his son are close.

It was a little more dramatic than the series episodes, and had a different actress portraying the wife (She who must be Obeyed).
