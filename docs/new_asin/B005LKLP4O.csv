8652608,4,B005LKLP4O,"I write ""affordable"" not in so much money terms but in time and your sanity. Trying to teach a 71 year old how to use Twitter and Facebook can be a challenge to say the least. This DVD (remember this DVD will only play on computers!!!) with its sister Facebook for Seniors is set up perfectly for elderly. It is set up with chapters like a book. One only has to click on chapter and it plays. All instruction is there. My mother learned the basics and more in an afternoon. She was very excitred. I took a star off because of DVD playing only on computer and I had to explain to my mother why she couldn't play in DVD player (that I spent an afternoon teaching her to use 3 years ago). DVD will save you lots of headaches. Over-all a good purchase.",1317427200,3,748,4.165517241379311
