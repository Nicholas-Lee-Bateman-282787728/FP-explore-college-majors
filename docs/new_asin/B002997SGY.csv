8357610,5,B002997SGY,"I use this DVD for lecturing purposes on universities for graduate and post graduate studies. As a member of an UNA I can highly recommend this DVD, it is naturally biased, but not as much as one might assume. It still is very critical about the UN procedures and shows a lot of the administrative work of the UNPKO as well as the field work and the greater political picture.",1264550400,4,376,4.385714285714286
