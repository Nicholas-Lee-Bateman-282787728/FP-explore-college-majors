When playing the movie it is clearly damaged as the video interrupts constantly, the image is hardy visible through the many bit errors.",1446595200,,249,4.813953488372093
8314004,5,B001JYBV68,I bought this because this was the only way to get my hands on this movie. I liked it very much. The plot was easy to follow and there were some funny moments throughout. The story is pretty strange but interesting. Ian McShane was also one of the main reasons I bought it. He gets most of the funny lines and it's just a good bank robbery movie. I don't really care for the politics but if you can ignore that and watch it for the bank robbery it works.,1343433600,,454,4.055555555555555
8314005,4,B001JYBV68,"PLOT: a mixed group of thieves gather for a clever bank job.

Brains is the clever planner of a bank job~ (IAN MCSHANE) who sets up the job~ no alarms in the basement of the bank in NICE so they use the SEWERS to gain entrance to the basement of the bank where there are lock boxes. Inside many lock boxes are cash and jewels where the WEALTHY Of Europe stash their cash TO HIDE IT FROM THE GOVERNMENT. Brains sets up the job but has terrorist leanings but settles on a group of greedy men to help him pull off the heist. (WARREN CLARKE & STEPHEN GREIF) with the aid of a look out they soon pull off the job less than a block from a POLICE barrack.  on the lighter side they complain about having to COUNT the loot which is boring. This is a very well done movie. BASED on a real event and lots of make belive added for drama. NICE IS VERY BEAUTIFUL and  the local shots are first rate. This movie is also known as SEWERS OF GOLD~ and was released on DVD under that title.

I GIVE IT 4 STARS FOR WELL DONE HEIST MOVIE, very good plot and fact based robbery that keeps you watching to see what will happen next.  made in 1979~ the actual robbery was done in 1976. McShane is good as the BAD guy we like even if he is a terrorist.",1334448000,,1228,4.016393442622951
8314006,4,B001JYBV68,"Of the four films about the ingenious 1976 robbery of the supposedly impregnable Socit Gnrale bank in Nice by Albert Spaggiari and his gang tunneling their way in through the sewers - Les Egouts du Paradis, Loophole and most recently Sans Arme, Ni Haine, Ni Violence - Francis Megahy's Sewers of Gold is by far the most compelling affair. Originally intended as a theatrical feature but debuting on television instead and going under a variety of titles (including Dirty Money and The Great Riviera Bank Robbery), it's blessed with a charismatic lead in Ian McShane and, without Spaggiari looking over its shoulder, able to take a far more critical look at the crime and its perpetrators than the cheeky romp he liked to make it out to be.

While it doesn't use real names (Spaggiari is simply referred to as The Brains here), it's a little less selective with the facts and it makes no bones about their motive - to fund the overthrow of the government - and even throws in some swastikas and a portrait of Hitler in one's apartment just to make sure that we don't mistake them for left wing idealists. The OAS, most famous for their bombing campaigns, indiscriminate killings and bungled assassination attempts on De Gaulle and successful ones on several of his ministers in the early 60s, had effectively been eliminated since the early 60s, but the gang was made up of a mixture of OAS die-hards and professional criminals, and the film doesn't sentimentalise them or gloss over the occasional tension from their clashing motivations. Coming from the British gangster tradition - the film is set in France but no one attempts any accents - there's no need to make either the OAS or crims good or bad guys, the film content to tell the story and let the audience judge. And it tells it surprisingly well and with an economy that doesn't outstay its 102-minute running time while never feeling rushed, in its own very professional way turning what could have been a good heist movie into a much better one that deserves to be much better known.

Network's UK PAL DVD includes a good transfer with stills gallery, 2 alternate title sequences (the same sequence with different titles) and trailer as extras.",1284940800,2,2207,4.774869109947644
