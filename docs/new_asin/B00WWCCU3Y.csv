8714511,5,B00WWCCU3Y,Very touching portrayal of an extraordinary man who established a famous Sikh social service organization called Pingalwara. This film will bring an emotional reality of Sikh history to all who watch it. I was moved to tears. The subtitles are well done. I can't wait to visit Amritsar to volunteer there.,1468454400,,305,5.0
