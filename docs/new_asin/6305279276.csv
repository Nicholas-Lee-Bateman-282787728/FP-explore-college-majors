7887330,3,6305279276,An enjoyable if somewhat silly 1981 action movie with plenty of action and the lovely Shawn Hoskins.,1490486400,,100,4.9411764705882355
7887331,5,6305279276,"This early 80's flick is very violent and has a compelling story. Max Thayer is very convincing as a down and out loser whose luck changes (for the bad) when he is recruited into the CIA. After learning his job will be assisting in kidnapping and murder, he bolts with an intended victim. Becoming a fugitive he ends up killing other agents on his trail and a lot of blood is spilled in this action/thriller. Regular guy Thayer is no martial artist but uses a broken bottle, gun, and some well aimed punches to keep alive against the well trained agents. The fights are many and are believable showing what could really happen. The Retrievers earns its ""R"" rating featuring some very graphic violence. Besides Thayer, the acting isn't too bad. The movie succeeds because of an interesting story, well choreographed kung fu fights, impressive gore scenes, Max Thayer's great performance, and a total absence of 80's goofiness. Fullscreen DVD picture and audio is not bad, I've seen worse.",1211932800,2,987,4.846153846153846
