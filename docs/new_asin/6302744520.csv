They left the screen for a trip to the bathroom when Madeleine and Bob engaged in some ""mushy stuff.""  That's just the way it was when I saw it in 1942. This Hope film provides a bonus which is the performance of Madeleine Carroll. Her acting skills are revealed in several scenes with Hope when she needs to save them by belting out several lines of American slang. Take it from my grandchildren; five years ago they would have claimed that MY FAVORITE BLONDE was a ""bad"" [super good]  movie.

Directed by Sidney Lanfield

Hope is his outstanding come and get it humor, with the wisecracks coming quickly throughout the film.  Carroll is classy, serious, and the character she plays is game for anything to reach her goal.

Loved the scene where Bing Crosby directs Hope to a bus, Hope starts to walk away from him, stops and says to himself, ""No. It couldn't be.""  Another classic scene is when Hope turns the radio to his own show and turns it off, commenting, ""I can't stand that guy.""

Enjoy those famous one liners and wise cracks from Hope. These are scripted well and the film manages to be very funny even more than half a century later.

""Lux Radio Theater"" broadcast a 60 minute radio adaptation of the movie on October 19, 1942 with Bob Hope reprising his film role.

502605,4,6302744520,"1942 was a disastrous year for the United States in the Pacific Theater of the War. At home, while the Great Depression had been alleviated by two years of ""defense"" production, the outbreak of a shooting war led to a great leap forward to levels never before achieved by any nation. With that good news of jobs for everyone who wanted to work, came the frightening enlargement of draft quotas as peacetime conscription had to be geared to fighting the coming land war in Europe while holding the line against a determined foe in the Pacific. As men in increasing numbers were drafted, women responded to the call to fulfill their obligation to their country by working as nurses, but also in every craft necessary to war production. Many families saw the departures of sons, husbands and fathers, hundreds of thousands never to return, and bore the weight of anxiety as to whether that would be the fate of those they loved or would it be the kind of crippling, self-destroying injuries suffered by those returning from the Great War, as it had been called.
Radio and motion pictures, the two great entertainment media of the day, rallied to the cause of raising morale and propagandizing for the causes for which we were told we were fighting. It was also a period of great wealth for those producing the product (although not for those on salary, since they were not permitted to keep more than 25,000 a year). Paramount had two of the top rated stars of radio and film to throw into their effort to help fight the war (and make the balance sheets radiate profits): Bing Crosby, one of the most popular of all men in the world, and Bob Hope, the upcoming film star at the top of radio ratings in those days when Comedy Was King (on radio). Already the team of Crosby and Hope had begun its eminently successful series of Road pictures and always popular guest appearances on the others' radio shows as well as unbilled appearances in each others films (where possible).
Star-Spangled Rhythm which showed both in cameo roles, was a type of film popular since the earliest days of the ""talkies"". Periodically, studios would throw every star available into a vaudeville type of movie, songs, comedy bits, dance and skits, sometimes bound together by a minimum of plot (as in this one) sometimes simply like a Broadway revue with a master of ceremonies, other times simply a succession of acts. With two of their brightest newcomers, Eddie Bracken and Betty Hutton, carrying the load of the plot (helped by an assortment of familiar faces), the stars do their turn. Some clicked then but don't now (after all it is now 69 years later for material not meant ever to be seen again save in one or two second runs and revivals), other bits and songs have lost little of their entertainment value. Overall, the film is sufficiently light-hearted and energetic to warrant seeing on an evening when sitcoms, police procedurals, amateur hours, and talk shows have left you jaded.
My Favorite Blonde is in the pattern of mystery-thriller-comedies that served Hope so well throughout his long career. Hope expresses his state of mind with what became a most familiar catalog of facial and bodily movements and, of course, gag and character establishing lines. Madeline Carroll, then a very popular star, serves as love interest and second banana, as did Lamour and a bevy of other fem-stars later. The supporting players, including the rather notable Gale Sondegaard (later blacklisted with her husband), do no more than is required of them....which is serve as villainous comedy foils. Having seen it many times since it first saw light in 1942, I am unable to judge how a younger audience will respond to these shenanigans, I found them enjoyable if not riotously funny (as I may have done almost seventy years ago).
All-in-all, I think both will entertain most older people; the young ought to take a look if only to see what their grand-and-great grand-parents were getting a kick from in those days when the casualty lists were still relatively light (as compared to when the losses for just one part of a campaign, a few months in duration, could number 80,000.",1302998400,4,4156,4.789693593314763
502606,5,6302744520,"""My Favorite Blonde"" is great Bob Hope in every sense of the word.  Nothing much else said would be necessary.

The real gem of this collection is ""Star Spangled Rhythm"".  Some may balk at this but pay attention, there's some really great gags, not to mention the songs and skits that all the Paramount stars put on.  You have to see to believe the bit with Betty Hutton and the two gents who try to help her get over the wall into the Paramount lot!

This film isn't an exclusive Bob Hope comedy except that he hosts the show for the Navy ship's crew and does one skit with William Bendix.  Make sure you take this show in the proper context of when it was made and don't put 21st Century ""values"" on it.",1295568000,,705,4.223880597014926

502608,5,6302744520,"Star Spangled Rhythm is noted for it's introduction of ""That Old Black Magic"" in a scene typical of wartime escapist movies. It's good to hear Johnny Johnston again and to see Vera Zorina trying to become a movie star.

Highlight however is Mary Martin, Dick Powell and the Golden Gate Quartet performing the outstanding ""Hit the Road to Dreamland"" one of Johnny Mercer's greatest creations. 40's music at it's best with a nice lilt and words that have meaning which we now only long for.

The disc also contains a second movie ""My Favorite Blond"" which is a spoof of Alfred Hitchcock's masterpiece ""The Thirty-Nine Steps"". Classic Bob Hope - where are you now that we need you?",1271635200,,678,4.737288135593221

A really fantastic funny film. Betty Hutton is at her best. Very enjoyable as a musical and a comedy.",1252713600,,258,5.0
502612,4,6302744520,"You can't go far wrong with the early Bob Hope films.  This double feature is misleading though because only one is a Hope vehicle.

""My Favourite Blonde"" is a spy comedy, a take off of ""The Thirty Nine Steps"", a famous book by John Buchan and British film starring the gorgeous Madelaine Carroll and Robert Donat. The gags come thick and fast and Hope is perfectly cast as a second rate vaudevillian with a performing penguin. He inadvertantly gets mixed up with British agent Carroll who is trying to deliver secret microfilm to her boss.  Their adventures take them from New York to Los Angeles, providing the script writers with endless opportunities for mayhem. It is a very entertaining film and Carroll surprises with her comedy technique.

""Star Spangled Rhythm"" was Paramount's entry into the all star ""putting on a show"" films which every studio produced during the war. It is one of the best. Betty Hutton stars as a telephonist at the studio and she is very funny. She has 2 standout scenes - when she greets boyfriend Eddie Bracken and a superb routine with 2 acrobats in which she is trying to get over the walls of the studio lot. The show itself has the usual mixture of acts - good such as Dorothy Lamour, Paulette Goddard and Veronica Lake sending up their images (Lake is inept) and Ray Milland, Lynne Overman, Franchot Tone and Fred MacMurray (his dead pan timing is impeccable) demonstrating if men played cards like women; very poor such as an inexplicable and embarrassing turn by the inert Alan Ladd and Susan Hayward overacting as usual in a skit about the wartime rubber shortage. There are also a couple of great songs - ""That Old Black Magic"" and ""Hit the Road to Dreamland"" for example. Ironically, for me the worst bit is the climax with Bing Crosby performing a patriotic song and showing absolutely zero involvement as usual.

The prints of the films are excellent but the extras only include the trailers of the films and some liner notes about the productions and the casts. One irritating constraint is that once you have selected a film, you can not return to the top menu to select the other film.",1182297600,4,2134,4.68
502653,5,6302744520,"This is delightfully hysterical film starring funnyman Bob Hope and showcasing the gorgeous Madeline Carroll. She really shines and gets to show off her comedic talent. Carroll did so many serious roles like ""Secret Agent"", ""Lloyds of London"", that it is refreshing to see her act in a screwball comedy while maintaining some sense of dignity. They have wonderful chemistry. I especially love the scene where Bob gets to ""rough-up"" Madeleine in order to have the police called to the scene to provide safe escort from the building. The villians are wonderful and Bob gets the best of them. My favorite Bob Hope film. Oh yes, the bonus Star Spangled Rhythm movie is a good look at Hollywood's morale-boosting war contribution. The skit showcasing the three gorgeous ladies from Paramount - Paulette Goddard, Dorothy Lamour, and Veronica Lake is hysterical.",1171411200,,855,5.114285714285714

502656,4,6302744520,"STAR SPANGLED RHYTHM has a good and inspiring plot and showcases Betty Hutton at her most likeable. Unfortunately, the Paramount stars aren`t as remembered today as the ones from MGM, Fox and Warner Bros.
But the film remains the best flagwaving vehicle from the studios 1942-1945.

The Goddard/Lamour/Lake number is a standout; I only look at Veronica Lake - her coolness is breathtaking. Other highlights are the Vera Zorina dance and when ""men play cards are women do....""

I will also give credit to Victor Moore, Cecil B. DeMille, Bob Hope and a script that never outstays its welcome... The finale is propaganda at its worst, but 1 have to remember why this film was made(to boost the morale and the boys in the fields)

The only thing this film lacks is the Busby Berkeley touch and some tapdancing by major stars.....

_

MY FAVORITE BLONDE is Hope at his best, but the female role should have been given to a blonde Vivien Leigh(but she left in 1940 to do her bit for the war-effort in native England)...

 That Madeleine woman simply isn`t good or pretty enough....

But the witty lines and (other) performances is a delight....",1165104000,2,1138,4.741116751269035
502657,5,6302744520,"This is a really fun 2-Pk. for Bob Hope fans. As mentioned by just about everyone, ""Star Spangled Rhythm"" is more of a screwball type comedy used as an excuse to parade many of Paramount's stars across the screen and give a patriotic boost to the country. It is a fun oddity with Betty Hutton and Eddie Bracken and, as mentioned, a big dose of Paramount stars putting on a show. Bob is here, of course, as is Bing, but the real Hope vehicle here is ""My Favorite Blonde"" with the lovely Madeleine Carroll.

Hope fans will have fun watching watching Bob and beautiful Madeleine Carroll navigate through this delightful romp about secret flight plans hidden in a gold scorpion pin. Hope gets off some good one-liners and there is even an amusing cameo from Bing. A better than usual screenplay by Don Hartman and Frank Butler, based on a story by Melvin Frank and Norman Panama, give Bob and gorgeous Madeleine plenty to do yet still enough time to fall in love.

Madeleine is Karen Bentley, a British agent trying to deliver top secret flight plans that German agents want to get their hands on at any cost. The plans are in code in a gold scorpion pin. When her partner is killed by enemy agents aboard the S.S. Aleria, the chase is on. Another British agent is taken down, this one a female, murdered because they thought she was Karen. She ducks into a variety show where Larry Haines (Bob Hope) and his penguin, Percy, are doing their last show before heading to Hollywood.

Larry is just thanking his lucky stars when Karen sort of falls into his lap and wants to travel with him. But she ditches him after planting the scorpion on him before boarding the train. He has a close encounter on the train with the group of enemy spies led by Mme. Stephanie Runick (Gale Sondergaard), but manages to escape with no idea what is going on.

Karen meets up with Larry in Albany, and though Larry isn't crazy about her hot and cold personality, she's a blonde and he can't say no. All she will tell him at first is that countless thousands will be affected and the map of the world could change if she doesn't succeed. Larry's a sucker for a pretty face, and keeps putting himself in greater and greater danger, until the enemy spies no longer believe he's a pawn, but the real thing.

There are some fun moments as Larry and his pajama wearing penguin, Percy, get caught up in the danger. When a third British agent Karen was scheduled to give the plans to is murdered, she finally comes clean with Larry and lets him in on what's going on. From there on it's one escape after another. There is one very funny moment when Larry and Karen are trashing a hotel room so the cops will come and arrest them, and Larry turns on the radio, then shuts it off quickly when that Bob Hope guy comes on!

When Larry becomes wanted for murder, they steal a bus at a picnic for the union, borrow a plane, hop a freight, and steal a car. Along the way, of course, they begin to fall for each other. Larry will end up in a coffin at a funeral home before the plans can be delivered. He has planted the scorpion on Karen this time, but the enemy agents, and the British, think he's swallowed them and want to cut him open!

Madeleine Carroll had a reserved type of glamour and was good here with Hope. Some did not find her as appealing as Lamour or Lamarr, who starred in the other two films of this Hope trilogy, ""My Favorite Brunette"" and ""My Favorite Spy,"" but she was simply different, and this is a lot of fun for Hope fans.

""My Favorite Blonde"" is a very good film to pop in on the weekend and enjoy. Hope gets to poke fun at himself, take a swipe at Crosby, deliver some zingers, and he even gets the girl in this one. What's not to like about that?

This is a nice addition to any film library and a real treat for Hope's millions of fans. It is also a chance to see many of Paramount's stars during the 1940's. A real treat.",1136851200,18,3913,4.334699453551913

502659,5,6302744520,"""Star Spangled Rhythm"" is a must see for anyone who wishes to visit or revisit the 1940's at the very beginning of the Second World War. It is a variety show with enough of a plot to lend continuity and some acts that are still entertaining today. So many of the Paramount stars participate that it is hard to single out any. It is wonderful to find this coupled with a very

good comedy, ""My Favorie Blond"", a very funny Bob Hope spy picture that gives an insighr to some almost forgotten aspects of his skill. As a frustrated vaudeville performer whose partner is a higher salaried penguin, the laughs start early on. Madeleine Carroll plays a British agent who serendipitously seeks refuge in Hope's dressing room. Hope thinks that Miss Carroll is deranged but she is very persuasive in asking for aid. They then are on their way to their destination, Los Angeles. Their odyssey across the United States includes an amusing homage to Miss Carroll's appearance in ""The 39 Steps"". They are always delightfully in danger from the likes of the sinister appearing George Zucco and the glamorous but also sinister appearing Gale Sondergaard

The Penguin scene with the monogram pajamas is classic.  Bob is not crude in this movie like he is in the road pictures.  He is very funny.  The part when they are on the bus is very funny.  If you want a good movie that is also funny, get this one.  You will find out why people thought Bob Hope was funny.  I still laugh at it and so do my kids.

502661,4,6302744520,"Bob Hope had for some time said on his radio show that Madeleine Carroll was his ""favorite blonde"". The actress called to thank him, and a movie pairing soon followed. A parody of spy films (most notably ""The 39 Steps""), the film delivers the laughs as British agent Carroll evades the Nazi bad guys with unwilling help from a penguin-toting vadevillian performer played by Hope.
Gale Sondergaard plays the spy chief with a prerequisite dose of iciness. Sadly, she isn't featured as much as one could wish, but her henchmen fit the bill as the heavies.
""Star Spangled Rhythm"" is a welcome, but odd inclusion on the disc. The story is a classic screwball comedy mixed with a dose of ""Stage Door Canteen"". Unfortunately, the numbers in the big show not only defy logic (the size and scope of the production is rediculously larger than believability can allow), but on top of that, they are mostly dull, overlong, and uninspiring.
The majority of the big names touted in the credits are more or less confined to appearing in the big morale show, save for two nice turns by Cecil B. DeMille and Preston Sturges. Bing Crosby is limited to what amounts to an extended cameo, while Bob Hope fares little better. Only two numbers really stand out from the show. One is a nice number with Paulette Goddard, Dorothy Lamour, and Veronica Lake in ""A Sweater, A Sarong, and a Peek-a-boo Bang"". The title refers to the famous trademarks of each star (Goddard's sexy sweaters, Lamour's island-movie sarongs, and Lake's vision-obscuring hairdoo). The other number is the balletic winter dance sequence in which a GI dreams about his girl back home.
""If Men Played Cards As Women Do"" is a Vadevillian piece that was first performed back in 1929, and unfortunately, shows its dated quality. By today's standards, the characters come off as simply ""femme"" given the subtlety of the act. The point of the skit is similar to that commercial where burly men say things like, ""Do these jeans make me look fat?"" Of course Ray Milland and Fred MacMurry, et al, are lots of fun, but the skit just doesn't hold up.
Back on the Paramount lot, however, there's a fun number about defense workers called ""Swing Shift"". And then there's an interesting scene where Betty Hutton tries to gain access to the Paramount lot by literally going over the wall, with next to no help whatsoever from a pair of helpful passerbys.
While Bob does emcee the big event, and helps Betty with some of her scheming, he isn't really the star here. As such, the film, while nice to have, is kind of out of place in the Bob Hope Tribute Collection.

7830243,5,6302744520,"This is a review of Star Spangled Rhythm, which is what I wanted (was cheaper to get this set than to buy it separately). This is a really fun entertaining movie from the 40's. Fast paced and upbeat with a few good musical numbers, but its not a musical. Its big selling point when it came out was the appearance of so many of Paramount Pictures movie stars. It's fun to see them but the star of the movie is really Betty Hutton in her first starring role. She is a blast to watch and easily eclipses the movie star cameos. Basically she plays a phone operator at Paramount whose Navy boyfriend ( Eddie Bracken,who is terrific) comes back from sea and wants to see his dad, who is really a gate guard at the studio but told his son that he was the head of the studio!!! The rest of the movie involves the efforts of Betty and the dad to promote this fraud on the son, including arranging a benefit for the sailors on the son's ship with all the movie stars because the dad said he could do that. So some crazy times ensue! This is Betty Hutton's movie. So much energy and heart and she gives it her all in every scene. I found her to be both endearing and a joy to watch. And boy is she funny. There's one scene where she tries to climb a wall to get back into Paramount after she's been fired that's one of the funniest things I've ever seen. It involves 2 guys who offer to help her and just mess things up! Its very intricate and just when you think its over they find a way to keep it going. Its just hilarious. So if you want to see a fun movie I really recommend this. I'm new to seeing Betty Hutton but now I'm a full time fan of hers.  So much life and energy that she put into this.(By the way,Bob Hope doesn't have a lot to do in this and was pretty corny).",1506902400,2,1767,4.063037249283668
