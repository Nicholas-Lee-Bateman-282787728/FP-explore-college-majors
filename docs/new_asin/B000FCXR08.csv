8153073,4,B000FCXR08,"Second entry in this sexy soft-core striptease series appropriately adds a 2nd camera for simultaneous rear views of the action. Considering the quality of premium posteriors on parade, its an excellent directing decision!

Overall, #2 has better video and audio technology, but unfortunately feels much more staged. There are seven young women, most of whom are quite pretty, plus a bonus yoga girl, all of whom boast tight natural bodies. But the only ""Best of on a franchise scale is the first segment, from a lovely long red-tressed busty bartender named Kelly Taylor (pictured), who almost gets up the will to walk out twice but finally gets an offer she can't refuse.

Two college co-eds, Kaylee and Kelly S., along with the bonus girl Erika18 y.o. fitness babe, woware highlights. But several of the young women are far too ""easy,"" and many of the performances are really bad. One good twist when a gal who works in a printing shop says No, but reluctantly comes back later.

A lower-tier entry in the series, but still worth seeing for the compelling scenario, the second camera and several of the bad actresses' assets.",1526169600,,1128,4.895287958115183

8153075,4,B000FCXR08,"I liked the first ""I'll pay you to get naked"" DVD. This is basically the same thing only somewhat improved. They invite unsuspecting pretty girls to their studio and see how much they have to pay the girls to strip completely naked. It's fun to see the girls get shocked at first, and then slowly change their minds as the bidding goes up.

On this second DVD, the sound is better. That might not seem so important, but it is fun to hear the dialogue more clearly. And the girls are even more attractive on this one. Plus you get a bonus girl. One difference that people might have mixed opinions about is that in vol 1 most of the girls strip in front of the camera. In vol 2 most of the girls strip behind a curtain and then come out completely naked. (Either works for me, I'll tell you.)

I haven't seen vol 3, at least not yet. But if you're interested in these DVDs you could start with this one.",1241654400,10,902,4.208092485549133
