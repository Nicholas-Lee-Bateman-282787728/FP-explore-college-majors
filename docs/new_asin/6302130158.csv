7822153,4,6302130158,"Although this is a fairly simple mystery to solve from the audience point of view, this made-for-TV courtroom drama is nothing short of entertaining. Linda Purl is great as the respected Atlanta defense attorney who goes home after several years to defend an obviously falsely-accused-of-rape teen. There, she rekindles an old relationship with a high school lover who turns out to be the D.A. who is opposing her. Mysterious coincidences and excitement ensues. A nice cast and witty script, filled with some audience involving atmosphere, etc. help to make this an excellent murder-mystery with a rather expected twist but still shocking nonetheless.",1082419200,,651,5.392156862745098
