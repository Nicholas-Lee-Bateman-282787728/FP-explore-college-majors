7821937,4,6302117038,"I'll be direct: It's an interesting movie to watch because of its premise.  It suffers from having Melody Anderson playing two distinct roles.  It is confusing, since it can lead one to think the two roles are the same person, and it would have an effect on the story.  There are some leaps in conclusions by the characters, and the ending is kind of an end run.  But if it was affordable and on DVD, I'd probably get it.",1417651200,,421,4.291139240506329

The story is not implausible. Spying, subversion is common to enemies. The dynamics between the three women is good and for a movie for television, reveals some of the real venom that can exist between competitive women often said to be nearly all-male: women do and compete very fiercely among one another, but it is seldom showcased or makes the headlines.
The is a good, ruthless movie. The George C. Scott look-a-like dispatches with one of his foes and this is a favorite scene of mine; wished the old  man had lived though.
The movie hints at things and I would recommend one getting familiar with Dave Emory and Veronica Clark. Emory, who believes there is indeed an underground Reich and Clark whose books are revealing aspects of Germany too hot or unknown for most historians, libraries, or political figures to handle.",1381881600,3,961,4.686390532544379
