2605116,4,B000GDIBSY,"I found this 1966 BBC television production of ""The Three Musketeers"" quite satisfying, despite its limitations.  The casting is good, and the acting is intense and energetic -- if perhaps occasionally a bit too much so -- and it's a real pleasure seeing Brian Blessed and Jeremy Brett (many years before his marvelous Sherlock Holmes) at the beginning of their careers.  The costumes are excellent, thought it's a shame that the modest budget prevented this from being a color production, and the ten 22-minute films hew pretty closely to Alexandre Dumas' novel.  Again, the biggest pity is the small budget, necessitating far from razor-sharp black and white photography and apparently no music allocation whatsoever -- though effective use is made of Berlioz's ""Symphonie fantastique"" in each episode (but couldn't they fade to black for a couple seconds before slamming us into the end credits?).  Still, this is a much more successful rendering of Dumas' peerless novel than many other big budget productions.  I recommend it for fans of swashbucklers, Dumas, Jeremy Brett, and Brian Blessed.",1291334400,8,1097,5.2457142857142856
2605117,5,B000GDIBSY,"These ""Three Musketeers"" have all the charm of the old english series. Young Jeremy Brett is absolutely dashing. I was astonished not to see his name on the DVD box. He PLAYS THE PART OF D'ARTAGNAN, the great and illustrious d'Artagnan! But we are used to see him underrated (those who want him awarded, at least, with a posthumous Bafta, may go to facebook:""posthumous BAFTA for Jeremy Brett"").Nevertheless, I'm very satisfied with my English musketeers! I'm french, I'm fond of d' Artagnan and I like to see what our foreign friends make of him. We can trust the skills of our neighbors from the United Kingdom.",1273017600,5,613,4.7924528301886795
2605118,3,B000GDIBSY,"In historical terms, this dvd is probably better sought as a sample of the home-movie quality of early British television than a glimpse of swashbuckling France. The production values are nearer to 1930's Saturday Matinee serials than American tv anytime after the early fifties. While the director tries manfully to be artful, he is time and again undercut by the ham-handed editing. And the music, which seems to be bits of classical music played on a victrola, winds up trying a little too hard.

Yet, that having been said, there's much to recommend it. An early glimpse of some of the actors who will go on to become mainstays of British tv, for one thing. For another the sheer joy of the familiar story of these brothers in arms who will draw the rapier and leap to the attack at the slightest provocation. The script is adequate, if unexceptional (George Macdonald Fraser's script for the early 1970's MUSKETEERS is to my mind the gold standard)and the acting frequently hits a fine, satisfying stride.
  If you can get past the production weaknesses, it's a pleasant few hours of historical romance.",1242345600,6,1108,4.851851851851852
2605119,1,B000GDIBSY,"The quality of the soundtrack is like AM radio. The acting reminds me of silent movies - overly melodramatic. I had to turn it off after about 15 minutes of the first episode. I just couldn't take it anymore. The high quality of more recent period dramas e.g. ""Cranford"",""Horatio Hornblower"", or ""Sense and Sensibility"" have, no doubt, spoiled me.",1231718400,,347,4.898305084745763
2605120,4,B000GDIBSY,"Good BBC production. If you like the three musketeers you'll like this.
The best is Jeremy Brett playing D'artagnan.
Of course a must have for any Brett's fan.",1216080000,11,159,4.714285714285714
2605121,5,B000GDIBSY,"I know it was in B&W, and looked like it cost next to nothing, but the script was good and the cast were fun, especially Mary Peach.",1183593600,7,132,3.925925925925926
2605122,4,B000GDIBSY,"Compared with some of the grandiose technicolored widescreen versions pf ""The Three Musketeers"" this 1966 black and white production looks cramped and primitive, but it has virtues  of its own: the acting is of excellent quality throughout the cast and the personalities of the  musketeers are more sharply defined.  What is wryly amusing is that even in the DVD version, Jeremy Brett gets only second billing; his name does not  even appear on the front cover of the box! Yet even in this youthful appearance the sensitivity and emotional range of this gifted actor are apparent. For his prtformance alone this set would be worth buying.",1167868800,18,638,4.990566037735849
2605123,5,B000GDIBSY,"In 1966, BBC unveiled The Three Musketeers, a television mini-series shown in 10 black & white episodes, each about 24 minutes long. This full-screen dvd release is certainly worth a look for all swashbuckler fans and, specifically, for readers of Alexandre Dumas. I'm not sure how many film adaptations there are out there about the Musketeers. Off the cuff, the versions I remember starred Douglas Fairbanks, Don Ameche (a musical!), Gene Kelly, Michael York (excellent!), and Charlie Sheen. There was even a crappy version a few years ago wherein D'Artagnan's fighting style combined elements of gymnastics and martial arts!

This BBC mini-series sticks pretty closely to Dumas's classic tale of love, honor, and swordplay. In ten chapters, we get to witness the high points of the book: our young Gascon, D'Artagnan, on his way to meet M. Treville in hopes of becoming a Musketeer, initially ruffling the feathers of Athos, Porthos, and Aramis, and consequently scheduling dueling appointments with them on three successive hours; D'Artagnan meeting and falling in love with Constance, the lovely but married seamstress and confidante of the Queen, who, unwisely but very Frenchlike, engages in secret liaisons with the Duke of Buckingham; D'Artagnan's heroic mission for his queen and his friends' noble sacrifices along the way so that D'Artagnan's mission is successful. And so on...

The cast is comprised of outstanding British actors. Athos, Porthos, and Aramis are respectively and vigorously played by Jeremy Young, Brian Blessed, and Gary Watson, who are all very, very good and passionate in their roles - in particular, Jeremy Young, whose tortured character has always stood out in my eyes. Unfortunately, Constance remains a tepid character, much like in the book. The villains are done a good turn by the wickedly good performances of Mary Peach, as the cunning and vindictive Milady de Winter, and of Richard Pasco, who plays Cardinal Richelieu with icy reserve and Machiavellian menace.

But, most of all, we get to experience a D'Artagnan who is disarmingly portrayed by Jeremy Brett. D'Artagnan, in Brett's hands, is earnest, noble, spiritedly idealistic, and fiercely brave. This is a very fine performance by Mr. Brett, who displays the intensity and class arrogance he would later hone to perfection as Sherlock Holmes. But, back in 1966, he was young enough (33 years old then) that he was able to bring zest and youthful energy into his iconic role. When his father advises him to ""never fear quarrels, but seek adventures"" and to ""fight on all occasions,"" we know Brett is up to the challenge.

Showcasing ferocious, energetic sword fights, ensemble acting done with panache and conviction, and a sincere commitment to do right by Dumas's greatest work, BBC's The Three Musketeers is an honest and true adaptation. With a budget commensurate to television, the production is modest but, nevertheless, admirable. The costumes, the settings, the texturing of the show are all exceedingly done well. No, it doesn't have the tongue in cheek flavor of the 1974 Richard Lester version or the Brat Pack casting of the 1993 offering. What it has, instead, is unassuming charm and loyalty to the spirit of Alexandre Dumas. Of all the Musketeer films I've seen, this one most closely resembles, believe it or not, the 1948 Gene Kelly film in its earnestness.

This series comes in 2 discs, with 5 episodes per disc. Here's the bad news: there are no special features included here. No behind the scenes featurette, no episode commentaries...nothing, nada, zipzoid. Which is why I'm rating the dvd as a four-and-a-half starrer, instead of the full five marks.

A year later, in 1967, BBC treated its audience to a follow up 16-episode serial, The Further Adventures of the Three Musketeers, which showcased Joss Ackland as D'Artagnan. Hopefully, there's a dvd about it in the near future, and with special features.

Hope this helped.",1157673600,80,3951,5.154446177847114

2605139,3,B000GDIBSY,"This was a serialized BBC production from the Sixties in black and white.  Except for Jeremy Brett at D'Artagnan and Brian Blessed as Porthos, few of the actors are well known in the States, but all are excellent.  Brett is well known to US viewers for his definitive portrayal of a nervous, edgy Sherlock Holmes.  As a young actor he was extraordinarily brash and vigorous heroic figure, so different as D'Artagnan from his almost frail seeming Holmes, as to be hardly recognizable as the same actor.",1370390400,,501,4.8023255813953485

8130818,4,B000GDIBSY,"Since I first read The Three Musketeers as a child, I have been hoping that Hollywood/BBC might make a version that comes close to the book. I fear that I will die of old age before that happens, but this version isn't bad. What I found most distracting was the glaring music that didn't seem appropriate for some of the scenes. All the various films over the years prefer to focus on action rather than on character development. D'Artagnan plays well enough & Athos grows on you, but Porthos & Aramis have almost nothing to do. Frankly, the actress who plays Milady is just not attractive enough to make one believe that she could get her way via seduction. The best of the lot & perhaps the most similar to Dumas's depiction is Cardinal Richelieu--this part & the actor who plays it is outstanding. There is plenty of action, but the series suffers from BBC-TV-1970s production values. Despite its shortcomings, (and I am a perfectionist where the D'Artagnan romances are concerned), I would rate this version second only to the Dick Lester Three & Four Musketeers films & far superior to the unadulterated crap that has been released over the past 20 years or so.",1444521600,5,1166,4.692682926829268

The films are black and white and show a bit of their age but none the less, they make for very good viewing enjoyment.  For Brian Blessed, it is an interesting view of him as a musketeer and then fast forward 20 years to remember him in Henry V.

I highly recommend it for fans of Alexandre Dumas.",1435363200,,414,4.215189873417722

8130822,5,B000GDIBSY,"I've read and enjoyed the Alexander Dumas novel twice but have been unable to find a movie that is true to the book - until now. While the story is compressed a bit it is very accurate in following Dumas' plot. The reall joy for me is the casting of most of the characters. I first thought Jeremy Brett played D'Artagnan too ""over the top"" but, after remembering the young Gascon in the book, I realized his emotional reactions to nearly every situation was perfect. He fought and loved at the drop of a hat. He was D'Artagnan. The portrayals of the Three Musketeers and other characters have been accurately reviewed already so I won't go into them.

Many others have said they prefered the Michael York version from back in the seventies (?) but I always thought it was far too playful, almost a comedy, especially the sword play. In this version our heros will fight at the drop of a hat (handkerchief?) but, when fighting, they are deadly serious (much like the book).  Frankly I always loved the Gene Kelly version, but mainly because I'm a Gene Kelly fan. What was not to like? Kelly's acrobatics, sword play, and pure ""likeability"", lots of action, plenty of beautiful people and very high production values. But sadly, not The Three Muskeers.

For me, the bad news is the video quality, which I consider to be, at best, VHS tape level. If you're watching on a smaller TV video would be marginal at best. On a big screen it's horrible (but watchable). The sound is below par also, and Berlioz' Symphonie Fantastique (which I love) seems inappropriate and even silly at times.

Nonetheless - you see I give five stars, because I loved the production and the fact that they stayed, essentially, true to the book. Add to that the great cast, their fine acting and reasonably good production values (for that era) and I ask, how could you not give it five stars?",1427241600,2,1865,4.591591591591592
