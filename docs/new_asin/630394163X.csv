7857140,5,630394163X,"Although the item I ordered never arrived, Mostly Media assured me that they had shipped it.  And so, to fix what was most likely a shipping company error, this super awesome company sent me another movie for free!! I didn't pay for the replacement movie or its shipping. What a stand up thing to do! I would recommend this company to anyone, and will most certainly use them again myself. Their costomer service and problem solving exemplify what we all hope for when shopping online.  Thank you, Mostly Media.",1394841600,,511,4.730337078651686
7857141,5,630394163X,My students loved this interpretation of classic literature.  The format is enchanting and delightful!  Wishbone is a wonderful edition to any parent or teacher's video library.,1246924800,,177,5.769230769230769
7857142,5,630394163X,"In this episode Wishbone plays the character Oliver Twist. Oliver is an Orphan and when he is kicked out of the Orphanage he meets a boy named the Artful Dodger and begins a life of crime. Back in Oakdale a new kid named Max (who is also an orphan) comes to town. When there has been a ""crime wave"" (said by Wanda Gilmore) the burglar steals Joe's baseball card from his house, and then Max becomes a suspect.

I have never really enjoyed the story of Oliver Twist and neither did my brothers, but in Twisted Tail it really makes the story fun to watch with Wishbone as Oliver Twist because the crew on this show combine Wishbone's personality and the Oliver Twist character to make it a little more fun and interesting for kids.

Well they struck gold on this episode because they made a story that I was never fond of fun to watch in Twisted Tail so if you like Wishbone as much as I do get this episode as well!",1243209600,,914,4.247126436781609
