I mean, they get caught and thrown in jail and the next episode they're magically out again. It gets tiresome. Otherwise, a wonderful, funny, highly entertaining show.",1406332800,,341,4.896551724137931
6332622,5,B00J44NW3U,"I completely agree with what the other two reviewers posted here on amazon. T.U.F.F Puppy is a hilarious,yet sadly underrated television show. The art style is very familiar to fans of Butch Hartman, but one of the aspects that I really loved about this series was the dialogue! The writers did an outstanding job providing many one liners, the double act of straight guy/stooge and banana man/comic and finally subtle (but not over the top) adult humor like what was found in the 1990s cartoons. Here is one of many examples:

Dudley: (In a helium voice) My name is little Dudley and I eat itty bitty waffles! Now you say something Kitty...

Kitty: (Helium voice as well) I hear a beeping noise...

Dudley (Still with helium ): I don't get it.

-Semi truck runs over Dudley and Kitty-

Dudley (Continued helium effect): Now I get it.

In the next scene Dudley continues to speak with the same high pitched voice to which an annoyed Kitty informs him that ""the gas wore off 20 minutes ago.""

The cast of characters, both good guys and bad guys, were very likable. From the gruffness of the Chief and awkwardness of Keswick, to the idiocy of Snaptrap and unhealthy desire for friendship of the Chameleon (the later one tends to poisons people and hates it when others touch his stuff; he is however a self-published author of pop up books)

I really haven't begun to go into detail about the many awesome aspects of this show. Grey Deisle and Jerry Trainor gave outstanding performances. It is truly a shame that nickelodeon  chose to end another highly entertaining show which had so much potential. First Invader Zim, now Dudley and company get the boot... Yet HOW many seasons of Spongebob continue to be churned out?? At least I can finally own these episodes and enjoy them anytime I want. Hopefully the other two seasons will be released as well.

If you haven't checked out this show and need a good laugh (kid or adult) then pick this up and be in for a treat! Hi-kee-kee!!",1404086400,,1980,4.631428571428572
6332623,5,B00J44NW3U,"Butch Hartman (creator of The Fairly OddParents) has done it again with his latest show TUFF Puppy! The show is about a Dudley Puppy, a not so bright dog who lands himself as a secret agent for TUFF (Turbo Undercover Fighting Force) and together with his partner Kitty Katswell battle evil doers like Verminous Snaptrap, The Chameleon, Bird Brain. If you like James Bond or Get Smart, I guarantee you'll enjoy this. Full of action, comedy, and heart, it's what makes TUFF Puppy such an awesome show. Once you start watching a few episodes, you'll grow to love it, trust me. Unfortunately, it only lasted 3 seasons (Nick being too blind to see how great this show was pulled the plug on it last year) and it's a very underrated show that luckily, has gotten a lot of love and a nice sized fanbase. So I highly recommend adding this show to your DVD/Nicktoon library.

Now some notes on the set:

-This is a MOD/DVD-R set which may or may not be a problem for some (I don't mind it is).
-You get all 20 episodes from Season 1 and 6 episodes from Season 2. This is because the set, like the Futurama DVD sets, go in production order and 6 episodes from Season 2 were from the original Season 1 production order line and it seems it will continue for the remaining sets.
-Unfortunately, the 6 eps from Season 2 are in a cropped full screen format. The first season was made in full screen (which all episodes from that season in this set are) but Season 2 onward, the show was made in widescreen HD. So again, fans will be slightly disappointed that the 6 Season 2 eps are cropped. And if anyone from Amazon, CreateSpace, or Nick/Viacom are listening or reading this, please have the next set feature the episodes in their original widescreen format.",1403913600,3,1746,4.487421383647798
6332624,4,B00J44NW3U,"After waiting forever, Nickelodeon has finally decided to release TUFF Puppy to DVD! For those who have never seen the show, it's full of wacky, off-the-wall humor and animation in the same style as a lot of old cartoons from the 1960s. The show is so funny, you need to put on a pair of Depends before watching it! Now I won't have to struggle to record all of the episodes myself!  :)",1403654400,2,386,4.287671232876712

8647888,5,B00J44NW3U,"HAA HAAA HAAAAAHH!  I'm a cartoon/animation fan, in my mid-40s and TUFF Puppy is one of the FUNNIEST [faced-paced] hilarious animated series-shows I have ever seen. It makes me laugh so much my stomach literally ACHES afterwards. I can only handle 1 half-hour episode at a time. GREAT COLLECTION! About 10[? -- I'm doing this from memory] episodes per disc with 3 discs. Sound is in STEREO [not 'MONO'. like some other Nicktoon DVDs]. It's so nice to see these shows ""complete"" WITHOUT all that on-screen pop-up ad-crap I saw when they showed these ON TV. You also get to see the ""actual END TITLES"" as well, that nowadays super-tight TV airtime doesn't allow anymore FOR ANY SHOW it seems[!!] One of the BEST ""newer"" cartoon series to come out in years and a GREAT DVD release of it....HAAAA HAAAAAH HHAAAAAAAHHHHH!
