8536201,5,B0095MYWQ2,Canon T3i Crash Course By Michael Andrew was bought as a gift for a friend.  I was very pleased with the Canon 7D course by Michael Andrew which was over three hours and covered setting up everything in the 7D and is indexed making finding something later very easy. Yes both the other course by Blue Crane and it was ok.,1362009600,3,321,4.262295081967213
