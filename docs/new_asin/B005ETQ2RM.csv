4667228,5,B005ETQ2RM,"By Darrell Stoddard, darrellstoddard@gmail.com

The Mormon Handcart story of 17 Miracles deserves an Academy Award, for cinematography, for best screenplay, for editing, and for best acting by many of the cast who didn't have to act because the role they played was more real than life.

My daughter and I had minor parts in filming 17 Miracles. We played the part of a father and daughter that buried my daughter's dead baby in a shallow grave in the snow. For whatever reason, God only knows, it was not acting, but was an out of the body, beyond the veil experience where we literally became the handcart father and daughter. Only one other time in my life have I experienced anything so ""real"".

When I placed the dead baby in the grave and cried out to God, words came out of me that I had never heard before, never even thought of before, because I was another man in another time burying a dead grandchild in a grave that we would have to leave forever.

Most of our life, in fact all of our life, ""We see through a glass darkly,"" if we see at all. (Brigham Young once said that his greatest wish for the Saints was that they would be able to see things as they really are.) While we were filming, the veil was parted for us, and for a short period of time, we saw and experienced things as they really were for the handcart pioneers. It seemed that we could see, experience, and live in, the past present and future all at the same time.

It was so hard for my daughter and I to leave her dead baby in the snow, even after the filming was done. Neither of us has ever wept like that, even over the death of a loved one in this life. I hope this will communicate on film and will be as ""real"" for those who see 17 Miracles. Others actors in the film, I am certain, had the same ""out of the body through the veil experience."" We didn't have to act because we literally lived the part. When the handcarts crossed the icy river, I believe some of the cast would have died, had they not been able to get out of their wet clothes and get warm.

The miracles shown in the film were true. I met a lady who was a direct descendant of the girl (who must have married after she got to Salt Lake) that left her fiance's body wrapped in her shawl in a tree; so the wolves wouldn't get it. It is as innocent and touching a love story as you will find in any film.

The husband, of the woman who was a descendant of the above girl, was a direct descendant of Francis Webster a member of the Martin Handcart Company who said, ""Mistake to send the Handcart Company out so late in the season? Yes! But I was in that company and my wife was in it....We suffered beyond anything you can imagine and many died of exposure and starvation, but did you ever hear a survivor of that company utter a word of criticism? Every one of us came through with the absolute knowledge that God lives for we became acquainted with Him in our extremities!""

An 18th Miracle from the journal of Henry Tempest:

Henry and his two sons, James and John, crossed the ocean on the Empire ship and on June 6, 1860, he left Florence, Neb., with a company of over 200 people to go to Utah. Only six of these people were fortunate enough to have wagons with oxen to pull them. Henry and the boys were thankful to have one of the 43 handcarts in company.

Everything they owned was packed in the cart. All the food, dishes, clothing and bedding for all three of them was in their two-wheeled handcart. They knew they would have to walk and pull the cart over trails, up hills and down, hundreds of miles to Utah.

They had not gone very far when Henry became ill. He was so sick that Captain Robinson thought it would be best if Henry and his sons went back to Nebraska. How disappointed Henry was! He begged the captain to let him stay with the company one more day to see if he would not get better. More than anything else in the world, he wanted to be able to pull his cart and go on with the others.

That night Henry prayed and explained just how much he wanted to be able to go on. He asked the Lord to help him get to Utah. The next morning he was much better. He traveled along trying to help James and John with the handcart. When it was time to camp that evening, Henry was very tired, but he was grateful that he had been well enough to keep going with the company. The pioneers took their things out of their carts. Each person had work to do. They started fires and cooked something to eat. They made their beds on the ground so they could rest and be ready to go on again. The boys worked; Henry rested.

That night a large greyhound dog came into camp. It ran from one group to another until it came to the little camp Henry and his boys had made. After it sniffed around, it lay down and seemed to be at home. The boys were delighted. They talked to it and petted it. No pets were allowed in the company. Food was too scarce to give to animals that did not earn it by working.

Henry had an idea, and it proved to be a wonderful one! He began to look around to find ropes and straps. Before long he had made a harness. The dog did not mind when Henry put the harness on him and hitched him to the handcart. He acted as if he had pulled carts before.

The next day the dog helped pull the cart. Now the large greyhound was considered a helper, not a pet, so he was allowed to stay. Henry Tempest and the boys divided their food from the cart with the dog. How they loved the big greyhound!

Day after day, whether the sun was hot or whether the wind blew, the dog helped. In fact, he pulled the handcart most of the way, hundreds of miles across the Plains. Henry was blessed with strength to walk along with his boys.

After nearly three months of walking and pulling the cart, they arrived in Salt Lake City. How happy they were to get to the place where they could start to build a home!

A few days after they arrived, the big greyhound disappeared and was never seen again.

FOOTNOTES:
It is through dramatic productions (live drama, theater, and motion pictures)  that we learn to ""see things as they really are."" We can vicariously experience life in another time or another place. Brigham Young said, ""If I had a group of people in a wilderness that I wanted to civilize, the first thing I would do is build a theater (for live drama not for motion pictures). And that is exactly what the Mormons did. In Salt Lake City, before the Temple, the Tabernacle, and the Assembly Hall were completed by the pioneers, a theater was built to ""civilize"" the people that had come through the wilderness. Indeed, it is in the Temples of the Church that we can vicariously experience eternity.

Another powerful example of how we can see or experience things as ""they really are"" (or were), see my review of ""Boy In the Stripped Pajamas.""

Satan also knows the power of drama, TV, and motion pictures to lead mankind by a silken thread or a flaxen cord, ""carefully down to Hell."" See my One Star Review of 'One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest'. The adversary 'takes in' and enslaves GOOD YOUNG PEOPLE in motion pictures like 'One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest', 'Love Story', and 'Grease'. What those films teach and MOST FIlMS TODAY, is that you must break free from the Ten Commandments, and the Judeo Christian values of parents and grandparents, to be liberated, happy, sophisticated, and popular.

DEATH:
After burying a dead grandchild in '17 Miracles,' I died pulling a handcart. Death can be a glorious experience. ""If in the pre-existence we looked forward to our life on earth, how much more so must we have looked forward to our mortal death.""

See all of my Reviews. I write only about books, events, or motion pictures that have changed the course of history or unforgettable books or motion pictures that will totally change peoples lives.

4667231,5,B005ETQ2RM,"Review summary:  If you have any interest in US history circa mid-1800s and/or handcart pioneers, you MUST see this excellent film! Heck, even if you're not specifically interested in those topics, go see it!

Plot: The film follows the journey of the Willie handcart company across the U.S. plains. The group left much later than originally planned and suffered well-documented hardships. This film depicts the hardships, but also focuses on the miracles that occurred along the way. (This part may be incorrect / unsubstantiated:  It's my understanding that the miracles occurred in both the Martin and Willie handcart companies, but for the purposes of this film they are depicted as all happening to the Willie company.)

Short note:  There are some scenes that young children may find frightening. A caution to parents that you may want to watch it first and just be aware of this.

Personal *opinion* of the film:  Certain other films (not to be named) related to LDS subject matters have mixed to poor quality -- acting, filming, etc. Not so with ""17 Miracles"". I found the cinematography / camera work, music, acting (for the most part) to be top-notch. The acting, especially, of Jasen Wade (central character of Levi Savage) was absolutely excellent. He nails his character. You see the emotion Levi must have experienced as he traveled, served, and suffered with this amazing group of people. (Jasen, you deserve a standing ovation in my book. WELL DONE! The same goes for the director, T.C. Christensen, and the entire cast and crew.) Our family watches many films, but we rarely spend the money to purchase a DVD. We loved this film in the theater so much, we have pre-ordered the DVD. Do yourself a huge favor and see this film if you can still find it in theaters, and even purchase the movie for your own family and to share with friends!

The incidents in the movie all depict actual events to actual people who were following their desire to follow Heavenly Father -- that makes it even more amazing. Because there was much suffering and hardship for these handcart pioneers, you need to keep some tissues ready -- this movie will touch you, but it will also uplift you.",1312243200,40,554,4.53

These people, many of whom probably did love Christ, were of simple mind and were lured into a savage wilderness to their deaths and those of thier loved ones. By wicked men who exploited the faith of the simple. It was only thier personal faith which they already had, before joining the mormons, that did them any good. There are many good hearted mormons who really belong to christ, but will need to sort out the difference between good doctrines and false doctrines of men.",1521244800,2,649,4.692982456140351
4667245,1,B005ETQ2RM,"I did look at this movie trailer for a possible watch. However it is very deceiving. Mormons are not Christian. I think people would do best to look up the truth about the religion. I will recommend Ed Deckers's website for you to get the real truth about Mormonism. He and his wife have exposed the false religion for decades, as they once were Mormon and God revealed to truth to them, so they left the false teachings of it.  It is actually the doctrine of demons. It is quite shocking sometimes how little discernment people actually have these days, especially those who call themselves Christians. I am sure people will get angry at this review because it seems no one really wants to know the truth about all the false religions out there now a days. Too much pride to go searching for the truth to see if they are wrong. Bible says ""we deceive ourselves.""",1521244800,6,863,4.496815286624204

What I got out of it was the true story of suffering that a group of people experienced during their OWN journey in their OWN faith.  I was not offended as some of the posts here.  I came away from the story in awe of the human spirit and fortitude.  It didn't deter my faith in any way. The end.",1521158400,5,529,3.8425925925925926
4667247,5,B005ETQ2RM,One of my favorites.  I think the acting and production was well done; love the historical vignettes that were gleaned from the journals of the pioneers who made the trek west in the Willie and Martin hand cart companies.  It depicts 17 miracles along the way but I always see 23.  A great family movie.  I like how it starts out with the discovery of the Donner Party in California and how it contrasts how the latter-day saints reacted under similar starvation situations - totally different..,1520985600,,495,4.72093023255814
4667248,5,B005ETQ2RM,At a time when the world is in denial of miraculous events. Mormon history is full of examples where God is not dead nor does he sleep. He hears the call of his children and reaches down from the heavens and from time to time makes bare his arm. These are not accounts of myth or legend but from eye witnesses.

4667260,1,B005ETQ2RM,"As others have already stated, the description for this movie is very misleading. The ""Mormon"" religion is not a ""Christian"" religion. Christians believe that God sent His only begotten son, Jesus Christ, to live a perfect and sinless life and die for the sins of all those who place their faith in Him (Gal 3:22). Christians believe that their salvation comes wholly from their faith in Jesus Christ as their Savior and is not a result of their good works (Eph 2:8-9). They believe that they are incapable leading a sinless life that would please God because of the sin nature they inherited from Adam (Jer 17:9, Ps 53:2-3...and others). Christ, on the other hand, led a perfectly sinless life (Heb 4:15, 2 Cor 5:21, 1 Pet 2:22, Rom 8:3-4) and did not deserve God's wrath. His sacrifice and the wrath that God poured out on Him at his crucifixion was an atonement for our sins (Heb 10:10, Col 1:22, 1 Pet 1:18-19, Ga. Jesus Christ was not created by God. He was a co-equal with God-fully God (John 1:1). He was also present with God at creation. In fact, He created all things (Col 1:16) and all things were created for Him (Rom 11 and Col 1:). These are things a ""Christian"" believes or the person is not a Christian in any historical of biblical sense whatsoever. Be honest, change the byline from ""Christian"" to ""Mormon"".",1519257600,9,1325,4.594936708860759
4667261,2,B005ETQ2RM,"This is not a Christian based movie. This is a Mormon based movie. It wasn't too surprising that in the opening scene the Mormons prayed for the souls of the dead people. The Bible is very specific in saying that once a person dies, the judgment follows right after (Hebrews 9:27). If you're a Mormon you will probably like this movie because it will pretend to show ""miracles"" done by your god. However, if you are a true follower of Jesus Christ, you should probably look elsewhere for a movie based on truth.",1518912000,5,511,4.505376344086022

Mormons do not believe in the Deity of Jesus Christ and this is where they become just like any other religion that does not believe in the Truth of the Bible.

If you answer yes then your path towards believing in God can commence and this film will help you on your journey. This is one of my all time favorite inspiring and uplifting films.  I believe in God and therefore get a lot out of this film. If you want there to be a God and have hope that he exists than I would highly recommend this film as it will help build your faith.

4667321,2,B005ETQ2RM,"Well, I was shanghaied into watching this last night, and can say with certainty, it knows its audience. This is pure wish-fulfillment fantasy for Mormons (women in particular), who love nothing more than to linger over the romantic notions of the rugged handcart companies trudging their way to Zion. The Mormon men are all stalwart, humble souls who yearn only to do The Right Thing. The women all love their rugged men with chaste admiration. The anti-Mormons (which, apparently, is everyone who wasn't Mormon at the time) are all cackling, liquored-up yahoos who drink the blood of children and play poker with Satan on weekends.

The titular miracles are either ""faith-promoting"" or ""groan-inducing"" depending on your POV. I wasn't counting and so can't tell which of the 17 miracles it represents, but when God apparently baked a family a shepherd's pie (I'm not even kidding) and plopped it down for them to feast on out of the blue, I about lost it. My thought was ""I wonder if any one of them, at any point while enjoying their magic meal, thought 'A little heavy on the Worcestershire sauce, Elohim!'"" There's a frozen kid raised from the dead, a ""fishes-and-loaves"" moment involving hard tack, and I'm pretty sure someone turned a tree stump into an apple pie at some point, although that may have been my subconscious bugging me for dessert. And . . again, I feel the need to promise you that I'm not making s*** up . . there's a adult Tiny Tim character that **SPOILER ALERT** ends up with the ""superb"" body he was promised by church leaders.

Oh . . there was actually what I believe the first ever poop-eating scene in Mormon cinema history. Sort of a John Waters/Farrelly Brothers meets Brigham Young moment. I admit I did not see it coming. There was also a ""humorous"" scene involving nose-picking. As far as seminary-ready, revisionist propaganda pieces go, that qualifies as edgy. If we'd seen a lady's calf or an actual kiss between the various would-be couples, I think the target audience mighta caught the vapors and lost ""The Spirit"".

To be fair, the film was well-shot and fairly well-acted, at least as far as is plausible in this sort of thing. As I said, it knows its audience, who will probably weep as openly after the 35th viewing as they did after the first. This movie is to religious drama as Nicholas Sparks movies are to romantic drama . . spiritual porn vs emotional porn. This review may seem cynical and harsh, but it's also honest, and I think anyone reading it will have a good idea as to whether or not you'll enjoy the experience of watching ""17 Miracles."" What has two thumbs and did not enjoy said experience? This guy!

4667360,3,B005ETQ2RM,"My husband and I watched the movie on Netflix last night.  We both love historical based movies and found this one to be OK.  The acting was good, especially the lead role.  Some parts were a little sappy...sort of reminded me of watching a musical where everyone breaks out in a song, while here they break out in another prayer.  There are some logical explanations of the 17 miracles but the pie in the desert made my eyes roll.",1405209600,,431,4.417721518987341
4667361,5,B005ETQ2RM,"I recommend this movie to anyone that wants to understand the true sufferings of the Mormon Pioneers. I read some of the journal books and accounts, and I don't believe the movie was quite there with the suffering they went through as reading the accounts seem to be much worse of what they went through. It's history that should be taught in schools. I really gave it a high rating because it was very well done and not a low budget film.

4667383,4,B005ETQ2RM,"This story taken from the experiences of early Mormon converts who were involved in the handcart companies caught on the high plains of Wyoming is excellent. It is well produced and performed, but has more historical interest than dramatic. The stories related are those actually experienced and while LDS critics will disdain the events as imaginary, far too many people have had experiences that lead them to believe in the spiritual path they follow.",1384128000,,453,5.135135135135135

4667386,5,B005ETQ2RM,Another faith promoting story of those in the past. It seems the world is still trying to say there is really no hope for us but that is a down right lie. We have all been given our own agency at birth and it is up to each if us to find happiness. It is not to anyone but ourselves to get on the right path. Just follow THE LORD ( that is too simple for some folk to see or do) but it is still true and everything will turn out right in the end no matter what occurs.,1382486400,,467,3.68

4667388,5,B005ETQ2RM,"This movie was one of the most inspiring I have seen. Sometimes we tend to deify the pioneers who crossed the plains. One of the underlying themes is that these were ordinary people who suffered through extraordinary circumstances. They were helped through those unbelievably difficulties with much divine assistance.

This is a faith-promoting film, not just for LDS audiences, but for anyone who believes that God sends angels to help us.

The casting and acting is above average for typical Mormon cinema.  (By professional standards it's about a B-)  Don't get me wrong, the movie is part of our permanent library, but in terms of mass appeal the universal nature of the story doesn't come through.",1358121600,6,526,4.673913043478261

When the movie finished, this proper English gentleman, World War II veteran and beloved great grandfather wiped the tears from his eyes and said, ""My goodness that was a powerful film, wasn't it? I say, a film like that leaves me in need a good stiff whiskey!""

I'm not sure that's the response the movie makers wanted to invoke in their viewers with this film, but it really is a powerful story well-told.

It's easy to forget how really blessed we are; this film gives us enough perspective to remind us that perhaps lost iPod ear phones and non-existant airplane meals aren't the biggest trials travelers have faced after all.",1338854400,14,728,4.635658914728682

2. The brother of all spirits born in heaven (including Satan) in the premortal existence.
3. One of 3 gods in the godhead.
4. The Trinity is three separate gods.
5. First one to receive a spirit body.
6. Atoned for sin on the cross and in the garden of Gethsemane.

Mormon Prophet Admits He Believes in Another Christ
Paris, France - In a surprising admission during last month's three nation European speaking trip, Mormon president Gordon B. Hinckley stated that the Christ he believes in is not the same Christ as the one followed by those outside the LDS Church.
It is interesting that Hinckley states that the beliefs of traditional Christians were so different than that of Latter-day Saints, that their traditional Jesus ""is not the Christ of whom I speak."" It is not just some different information about the same Jesus but a completely different Jesus.
Christians should ask, ""Which Christ?"" The Bible warns of false teachers who promote ""another Jesus whom we have not preached"" (2 Corinthians 11:4)

Polygamy:
Under threat of exile to Mexico the Mormon church officially abolished polygamy in the earthly realm in 1890. However, by virtue of secret temple ceremonies Mormon males like Joseph Smith, Brigham Young, as well as contemporary Mormon leaders remain sealed to multiple wives in the heavenly realm. Thus, the practice of polygamy promoted by Smith - who, by the way, had 27 plural wives, and Young, who had 55 wives and 57 children - was merely transferred to the Celestial Kingdom.

By relegating polygamy to the eternal realm Mormon leaders managed to comply externally with societal norms while still maintaining an eschatological basis for the subjugation of women. Such spiritual sanctioning of polygamy was not only an affront to the value and dignity of women, but stands in direct opposition to Jesus' teaching that at the resurrection people will neither marry nor be given in marriage.

The Mormon practice of polygamy finds its genesis in the teachings and practices of Joseph Smith who, in 1843, received an eternally binding revelation. According to Smith, apart from the practice of polygamy there was no hope of attaining to godhood. The everlasting commandment of polygamy revealed to Smith was considered so binding that Brigham Young ominously declared ""If any deny the plurality of wives and continue to do so, I promise you that you will be damned.""

And, of course, the Old Testament clearly reveals the strife and temptations that accompany the practice. Solomon, of course, is the quintessential example of one whose legacy of faithfulness was compromised because of his polygamous behavior. Despite world-renowned wisdom Solomon's peaceful and prosperous rule ended in idolatrous strife, scandal and in civil strife as well because the Bible tells us his wives turned his heart after other gods. There is, therefore, absolutely no biblical support for the Mormon practice of polygamy either in this life or the next.

Mormonism and the Claim to Restoration:

In response to this teaching, we should ask Mormons exactly how the church could manage to glorify God ""throughout all generations"" -- as the Apostle Paul clearly wrote in Ephesians 3:21 -- if they fell into total apostasy. We should also point out that Ephesians 4:11-16 talks about the church growing spiritually mature, not spiritually degenerate. The Bible does affirm that there will be apostates, but according to 1 Timothy 4:1 only ""some [not all] will abandon the faith."" This passage alone is enough to prove that Mormonism is wrong about the church falling away altogether.

Smith and other Mormons need to realize that they're teaching the exact opposite of what Jesus Christ of Nazareth proclaimed in Matthew 16:18 -- namely, that not even the gates of hell would prevail against the church of God. Furthermore, Hebrews 12:28 states that God's kingdom is unshakable, while Daniel 2:44 refers to it as indestructible. There can be no doubt that Mormonism contradicts what the Bible says about the perseverance of God's people -- the living church of God. Remember, it was Joseph Smith who attacked Christianity. He said that all their sects were wrong, their creeds an abomination, and their professors corrupt.

Other Doctrines:
1) God the Father is married and there is a Mother God (Answers to Gospel Questions, Joseph Fielding Smith, Vol. 3, pp. 143-144).
2) All men and women who have ever lived on Earth are the spirit offspring of Heavenly Father and Heavenly Mother. Every person was conceived and born in a pre-existent spiritual realm (Mormon Doctrine, p. 589).
3) Black people are black because of their misdeeds in the pre-existence (Three Degrees of Glory, LDS Apostle Melvin J. Ballard, p. 21).
4) The Bible is considered usable, but suspect due to its many errors and missing parts (Articles of Faith No. 8, Ensign January 1989, pp. 25, 27

Remember that it isn't the Christian church that is attacking Mormonism.  It  is Mormonism that has attacked the Christian church -- believing or stating that true Christianity disappeared from the earth for over 1800 years -- and let's not forget that. Contrary to biblical teachings they also believe in more than one God, that God is a literal man, that men can become gods, that Jesus was the spirit brother of Lucifer, not to mention salvation by works and not by grace (Isa. 43:10; Mark 12:29; John 4:24; John 1:1-14; Gal. 2:14-16; Eph. 2:8,9).

The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints
According to the official story of the LDS Church, in 1820 Smith was visited by God the Father and God the Son after praying about which church he should join. He was told by Jesus, he should join none of them for they were ""all wrong"" and all the Christian church's doctrines ""were an abomination"" (Joseph Smith - History 19, Pearl of Great Price).
DOCTRINES
TRINITY: Mormonism is a polytheistic religion. Joseph Smith declared, ""I will preach on the plurality of Gods. I have always declared God to be a distinct personage, Jesus Christ a separate and distinct personage from God the Father, and the Holy Ghost was a distinct personage and a Spirit: and these three constitute three distinct personages and three Gods"" (Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith, p. 370).
Mormon Apostle Bruce R. McConkie spoke about the Godhead in this way, ""Plurality of Gods: Three separate personages: Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, comprise the Godhead. As each of these persons is a God, it is evident, from this standpoint alone, that a plurality of Gods exists. To us, speaking in the proper finite sense, these three are the only Gods we worship. But in addition there is an infinite number of holy personages, drawn from worlds without number, who have passed on to exaltation and are thus gods"" (Mormon Doctrine, pp. 576-577).
GOD THE FATHER: Joseph Smith explained, ""I am going to tell you how God came to be God. We have imagined and supposed that God was God from all eternity. I will refute that idea, and take away the veil, so that you may see. He was once a man like us; yea, that God himself, the father of us all, dwelt on an earth, the same as Jesus Christ Himself did"" (LDS History of the Church, Vol. 6, p. 305).
