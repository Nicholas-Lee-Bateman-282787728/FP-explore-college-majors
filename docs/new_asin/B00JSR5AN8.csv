8653755,2,B00JSR5AN8,"This is a review for these films, not the DVD's quality; having seen most of these films either on DVD or online (either Hulu, Netflix or third party sites), I would say that this isn't that great of a combo being how most of them aren't Action films as promoted and less than half of them aren't truly decent). Buy if the price lowers, otherwise you realky aren't missing much.",1499385600,,378,4.414285714285715
8653756,3,B00JSR5AN8,"ECHO BRIDGE has really improved, quality-wise in recent years.
Gone are the scratchy public domain 16mm b&w films from the early TV era.
Also non-existent are persistent on-screen watermarks (as PLATINUM PLUS)
that drove some collectors to distraction.

Just purchased their BAD GUYS BITE THE DUST 9 movie pack frrom the 5 buck bin at WALMART.
Am currently watching film #1, FOREVER MINE (UK/Canada/USA-1999),
with Joseph Fiennes, Ray Liotta and Gretchen Mol. Writer/director is Paul Schrader.
The dub is widescreen and flawless, plus it has stereo sound. Excellent for a budget-priced product.

This is the story of a Miami cabana boy who has an affair with the wife of a very powerful man,
a liason that leaves him facially disfigured and believed buried under tons of construction site concrete.
The story's a bit soap-operaish, but not totally without merit.

As the above Product Details show, there are other known actors scattered throughout this set.
