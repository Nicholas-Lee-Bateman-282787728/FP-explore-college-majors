8661805,5,B00KUI4TV8,"Having already experienced Larry Kaye's Ultimate Guide to Surveillance DVDs and his Guide to Skip Tracing audio course, I can say that he's done it again: put together another great product, that any aspiring private investigator and/or process server, such as myself, would do well to acquire. (The course isn't specifically on private investigation, but as I've learned from following Larry's products and Youtube channel, process serving is a way to break into the private investigation profession, as it utilizes some of the same skills, and can count toward an experience requirement for obtaining a PI license. In my state of Indiana, for example, two years of PI experience are required to qualify for a license.)

Having recently gotten this Process Serving course, I've so far just gone through it once, but I look forward to reviewing the material, on an on-going basis, as needed. It's two discs and well organized into chapter divisions that are accessible from the DVD menu, making it convenient to go back and review whichever topic one might be interested in at that moment during his or her self-motivated process-serving/investigation training. Larry, as always, is an engaging speaking, and gets right down to nuts and bolts, laying out, comprehensively, the overall logic of what a process server needs to understand, as well as specific tips, tricks, and valuable lessons he's learned from years of experience.

If I have one criticism, it would only be that the Process Serving course didn't have the same cinematic quality of the Ultimate Guide to Surveillance: in the surveillance guide Larry took us on location in various ways: speaking about foot pursuit while walking outside, showing us an actually surveillance vehicle setup, demonstrating vehicle shadowing techniques with model cars, etc. Contrariwise, the process-serving guide, while well-presented and organized, is an engaging and very informative filmed lecture. But don't get me wrong: it's still a five-star DVD set, because, as I mentioned before, along with the overall explanation of how process serving works, there are tricks that Larry gives away in this DVD set that, each on its own, I imagine, would easily be worth the price of the course, and that I bet I will be using for years, when I get my process serving/investigation career started. Thanks in no small part to Larry Kaye, and this DVD set, I'm well on my way to making that dream a reality.",1413417600,,2447,5.115
