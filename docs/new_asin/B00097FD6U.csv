If you have no info on italy, then buy it if it's cheap.",1264291200,,129,3.7777777777777777
8057911,1,B00097FD6U,This is a very poor quality and one of the most uninteresting travel DVD I have ever seen! The picture quality is poor and material terrably outdated. It does not convey the true livelyness of Italy.,1122076800,10,199,4.555555555555555
8057912,3,B00097FD6U,"This was one of the better programs I saw to prepare yourself for a trip to Italy. That said, be prepared that the image quality of this feature looks like VHS from 1985. The feature remains pretty much on the surface of the tourist attractions, with some little historical extras, but it is not a real educational masterpiece.",1121299200,4,327,4.655172413793103
