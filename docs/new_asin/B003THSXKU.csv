4190398,5,B003THSXKU,"New and vintage interviews {along with countless clips from the franchise} highlight this loving tribute to ""The Master of Suspense"" and his 1960 masterpiece that started it all. How wonderful the filmmakers pay so much attention to its sequels, as well... especially the fine and underrated PSYCHO II. Superb Halloween month viewing, alright... but entertaining anytime of year! Highly recommended!",1289779200,,399,5.666666666666667
4190399,3,B003THSXKU,"Not a bad documentary and extras package but it's not as thorough as it really should have been. For example, there's no coverage of the Gus Van Sant remake of Psycho. Regardless of whether it was any good or not, it should have at least rated a mention. Also, there's no information about the failed tv pilot for Bates Motel which has only ever appeared on VHS as far as I know, and starred Bud Cort as an ex-mental patient who inherited the house and hotel from Norman. Like the Psycho remake this was also terrible but if you're going to make a documentary called The Psycho Legacy, it seems weird to leave out these two curios.",1289606400,5,631,4.401709401709402
4190400,5,B003THSXKU,"I shared the same opinion with the creator of this documentary. I got the Psycho sequels on DVD and was bummed that there were no special features. NONE! I have been following this documentary since it was an idea on Myspace and it's great seeing it being sold. The gist of it all, it's great for anyone who is a fan of the series.

4190401,4,B003THSXKU,"Fifty years ago, Anthony Perkins stabbed and slashed his way into the hearts of audiences in Alfred Hitchcock's classic horror epic, ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Psycho/dp/B001CC7PP8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Psycho</a>."" Aside from being a landmark for cinema, ""Psycho"" is notorious for having quite possibly the most consistent and most respectable set of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/sequels/dp/B000Q66Q8I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">sequels</a>, a fact often overlooked throughout the years. ""The Psycho Legacy,"" an in-depth documentary from some of the same folks who brought you ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/His-Name-Was-Jason/dp/B001L9EXNO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">His Name Was Jason</a>"" and ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Halloween-25-Years-of-Terror/dp/B000FC2GA0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Halloween: 25 Years of Terror</a>"", attempts to shed some light on this fact. By compiling interviews old and new with assorted cast and crew (as well as some long-time fans who have carved their own niche in the horror genre) ""The Psycho Legacy"" paints a colorful and informative picture of a franchise that deserves more respect beyond the usual praise garnered for its first installment.

The meat and potatoes of the feature-length documentary are broken down into five parts. Opening with a surprisingly brief (and somewhat shallow) piece on Hitchcock's original, the documentary spends equal time on each of the three sequels, wrapping up with thoughts on Norman Bates himself, Anthony Perkins. Incidentally, the documentary skips over the 1998 shot-for-shot remake, which is a bit of a shame as even if the film itself was a futile experiment in cinema, it is still rather note-worthy as a rarity in its own genre. While the bigger names such as Dennis Franz and Meg Tilly don't appear in the documentary, other key players such as Robert Loggia, Jeff Fahey, Olivia Hussey and Henry Thomas appear to be more than happy to show some love and support for their somewhat forgotten roles. Archive footage from Perkins, Janet Leigh, director Richard Franklin and others are intercut with the newer footage, while the documentary itself rejects the typical narration. Really, ""The Psycho Legacy"" is pretty much just a series of interviews pieced together to tell a story.

Since none of the releases for the three sequels were accompanied by any bonus material, it's quite a treat to finally have some light shed on these severely under-rated films. Those seeking the goods on Hitch's original would do better to look elsewhere, but for the rest of us, this documentary does the series justice. The 2-DVD set is rounded out with hours of deleted and extended material, which is actually just as informative as the main documentary itself, if not moreso. While one can't help but feel like more could have been done with this documentary (such as reaching out to bigger names or covering much more ground) it is a satisfying venture regardless. The bonus material is certainly worth a watch and even if you've seen the films multiple times and have read up on them as much as possible, you'll likely learn something new here. In essence, ""The Psycho Legacy"" is something us Norman Bates fans can go a little mad for.",1287878400,13,3389,5.914285714285715
4190402,5,B003THSXKU,"I have had the honor of watching some of this documentary being made and I can tell you first hand, that you won't find a more extensive look at the Psycho movies as a whole anywhere. The passion, attention to detail and interviews will get any horror or Psycho fan wanting more and more! Very well done!

4190403,4,B003THSXKU,"No film in classic Horror is more notorious than Alfred Hitchcock's PSYCHO. Likewise, no set of sequels are more notoriously overlooked, grossly underrated, and sickeningly scorned in their bare-bones video releases than the PSYCHO-sequels. Thankfully, writer/director Robert V. Galluzzo has set out to create the definitive documentary on the series by compiling years of behind-the-scenes photos and press cards with an extraordinary number of interviews, including such esteemed filmmakers as Tom Holland, David Schow, Adam Green, Stuart Gordon, Mick Garris, and countless others (many of whom have been intimately attached to the films). While Galluzzo falls just short of his ultimate goal, THE PSYCHO LEGACY does pull together an excellent assortment of entertaining stories, revealing facts, and reflections on all four entries, many of which have never been shared in the past. Rare footage of the late Anthony Perkins is also integrated into the feature, along with past interviews with co-stars Vera Miles and Janet Leigh. For the most part, the conversations are topical and are spliced together smoothly between interviewees, although the questionable choices in editing and computerized transitions cause minor distractions. In addition to the standard runtime, the Shout Factory! 2-disc release includes over 3-hours of bonus material, featuring Anthony Perkins' unedited panel discussion and footage from a recent PSYCHO cast reunion. THE PSYCHO LEGACY is an essential addition to any fan's collection that finally bridges the gaps left by the Universal releases.

4190407,5,B003THSXKU,"Interesting Psycho documentary, focuses more on the sequels, and has a lot of interesting insight and input into what it all means in terms of the legend and story",1357171200,,163,4.655172413793103
4190408,3,B003THSXKU,"The 2-disc Psycho Legacy (2010) examines Psycho I-IV (although the Psycho remake and TV Movie Bates Motel weren't included it isn't much of a loss). This is a welcome addition as the Psycho sequels were given limited coverage and extras by the studio in their releases. So there is some info in here that you don't see anywhere else because 3 of the films were released as a triple feature on 1 disc with no bonus material. Psycho Legacy is rather broad in scope as it tries to be complete but leaves some loose ends. Some additional cast and crew interviews would have been appreciated. The editing doesn't flow as well as it could and needs a polish. However, since the Psycho sequels are so good and so underrated it is a treat for fans of the movies to pick this up. Psycho 2 is a gem, Psycho 3 was directed by Anthony Perkins himself and Psycho 4 is unexpectedly good and works as a capstone to the quadrilogy. Perkins is in all of them so the Psycho canon is thankfully tight and focused. If you like the original the sequels are well worth watching.

There is also 3 hours of bonus material included on the second disc:
- 9 Extended Interviews & 8 Deleted Scenes from Psycho Legacy (Contained on Disc One.)
- Full Panel Discussion with Anthony Perkins (This is the best bonus feature.)
- Psycho Reunion Panel
- Tour of the Bates Motel (The most disappointing featurette because Mark Gatiss does it better in the BBC ""A History of Horror"".)
- Revisiting Psycho II (Psycho II writer Tom Holland goes through Psycho II director Richard Franklin's possessions.)
- Shooting Psycho II (Featuring cinematographer Dean Cundey.)
- Visiting Psycho Memorabilia Collector Guy Thorpe (Who has one of Mother's corpses.)
- Psycho on the Web
- Hyaena Gallery Presents Serial-Killer Inspired Art

There are interviews with many crew members such as Robert Loggia, Olivia Hussey, Henry Thomas, Diana Scarwid, Tom Holland, Hilton Green, Mick Garris (Psycho IV director) and many more. Anthony Perkins, Alfred Hitchcock, Janet Leigh and Joseph Stefano (Writer) are no longer with us so they don't appear in any new features. Surviving cast members from the original, Vera Miles and John Gavin, did not participate so don't expect to see familiar faces from the films. Meg Tilly and Dennis Franz are also absent. Psycho Legacy isn't comprehensive but few horror franchises get boxsets or deluxe treatment anyway (e.g. Halloween, Hellraiser) so I applaud the efforts of the team behind Psycho Legacy. Check out the Psycho Blu-Ray for more bonus material (on the original film only).",1351123200,,2567,4.8451025056947605
4190409,1,B003THSXKU,"The description of this DVD is amazing, sounds like everything you would want in a Psycho documentary, well, it isn't, nor is it anywhere close. All you get is poorly filmed and edited interviews with people's opinion that are of no interest.
No major actors from the first film, unless you count the shaky hand held camera footage of Anthony Perkins doing a Q&A at some convention, which might be the only entertaining part included.

I would have even accepted Meg Tilly confirming all the stories about how her and Anthony didn't get along, but nope.

The bonus disc is a bigger joke, 'The Bates Motel Tour', again, sounds great right? the director and some tour guide walk the around the front of the motel for about 30 seconds, that's it!!!!! they don't open a door, show cabin 1, show you the back and how it's a shell with nothing in it, just horribly lame.

The 'Psycho Reunion' as others have pointed out is just bad audio with pictures of the person talking, again a let down.

I honestly can write paragraphs on how pathetic this DVD is but I've already wasted the money on it, so I'm not gonna waste my time on it too.

Rent it, get it free, don't spend your money on it.

Sending it back to Amazon as a trade.",1342828800,7,1222,4.408888888888889
4190410,5,B003THSXKU,"It's a classic and it's Hitchcock at his best. A movie to be enjoyed alone and with friends and family.

4190411,4,B003THSXKU,"Psycho is arguably the greatest horror film ever made, and for my money, the best horror franchise. So, one could imagine the excitement and anticipation I had for Robert Galluzzo's feature-length documentary, The Psycho Legacy, which is now in stores by Shout! Factory.

So, how do Galluzzo and company fair with their Psycho retrospective?

There are certainly a load of interesting tidbits and anecdotes sprinkled throughout the entire 87-minute running time, and though Anthony Perkins is no longer with us, his presence is certainly felt. It's a fitting tribute to a wonderful actor that left us far too soon.

Another worthy addition to the proceedings is the musical score by Jermaine Stegall which incites the themes of Bernard Herrmman, Jerry Goldsmith and Carter Burwell. It really gives a cool vibe to the documentary as it starts with Alfred Hitchcock's classic, and continues on in chronological order. However, The Psycho Legacy is, at times, bogged down by some poor choices of guests. Does anyone really care about what a bunch of young B-movie directors think about these films? While it's not as excessively done as it was in His Name Was Jason, it's still an unwelcome addition to this documentary. Particularly when there's some real quality stuff relegated to the cutting room floor.

Another disappointing element is the absence of some key players like Meg Tilly and Dennis Franz, but more importantly, there is no fitting historian to be found here either. Instead of having the likes of Stephen Rebello or a Tom Weaver, we're stuck with Ryan Turek and Mike Cucinotta, who really don't offer much of anything of real value. Basically speaking, had the entire piece been centered on the cast and crew of the Psycho films, this would have been a knockout documentary. As it stands, it's good, just not great.

It's also unfortunate that The Psycho Legacy only includes information on the four Anthony Perkins movies. There is no time dedicated to the made-for-TV spin-off The Bates Motel or even the deservingly much-maligned Gus Van Sant remake. That, in itself, is disappointing. Coming off the heels of the terrific Never Sleep Again: the Elm Street Legacy release, one would have hoped for a more encompassing documentary for Psycho, as well. That said, what could one expect from an 87-minute long documentary?

As for the special features, disc 1 has some fascinating extended and deleted scenes that were somehow excluded from the main feature while Disc 2 includes a terrific forty-two minute panel discussion with Anthony Perkins. That is the obvious gem of this set. It's lively, engaging and for this Psycho fan, nostalgic.

The most disappointing extra feature would have to belong to ""The Psycho Reunion Panel,"" which is the result of over-dubbing the audio over a series of pictures of the participants. This is followed by a brief and uneventful `Tour of the Bates Motel' that was done for the film's Myspace page, and quite frankly, it's a missed opportunity.

We're then treated to the interesting ""Revisiting Psycho II"" featurette that includes writer Tom Holland and editor Andrew London delving through some promo material for the film. Its nothing earth shattering, but it is quite enjoyable.

""Shooting Psycho II"" is another keeper. Despite being absent from the feature-length documentary, we get a lengthy interview with cinematographer Dean Cundey. The only real downside is that there are some sound and editing issues.

From there we `Visit With Psycho Memorabilia Collector Guy Thorpe,' and while we don't get to see all that much, we do get a nice look of the corpse of `Mother' from Psycho II. It's a quirky addition, but not essential.
""Norman Bates in Print: Robert Bloch Author of Psycho"" is a decent entry that discusses the three Psycho novels that were penned by Bloch. The inclusion of this feature makes the omission of The Bates Motel and the Psycho remake even more glaring.

""Psycho on the Web,"" which talks with Jason Allentoff of thepsychomovies.com website, is surprisingly interesting while the two-disc set is rounded off with the unnecessary ""The Hyaena Gallery Presents Serial-Killer-Inspired Art"".

The Psycho Legacy, as a whole, could have been better, but when it delivers, it delivers. While it lacks the high production value of the aforementioned Never Sleep Again documentary, this is a project that was done for all the right reasons. It's obviously a labor of love, and despite its flaws, I'm glad to have it in my collection. A project like this was long over due, and luckily, it's well-worth the price of purchase. So fan-boy gripes aside, I am appreciative that there was a fan like Robert Galluzzo that was willing to do what Universal Pictures has not, and that is to celebrate the Psycho franchise.",1317427200,3,4784,5.0494296577946765
4190412,2,B003THSXKU,"Psycho Legacy is extremley weak when compared to other Ultimate Collections like Friday the 13th or Halloween.  There is no tour of the Bates Mansion or Hotel, just a walk by.  The audio is poor on most of the DVD.  I loved the Psycho movies but I'm so glad I didn't buy this.  Check it out at your local library.  You'll be glad you did.",1316390400,,338,4.138461538461539
4190413,3,B003THSXKU,"Firstly I must say that this documentary DVD was a long time coming. I personally love getting to hear 'behind the scenes' stories about classics like this and seeing interviews with cast and crew who were there to experience the whole thing. The person responsible for this documentary obviously put a lot of time, care, attention, and love into this project and it shows... kudos and many thanks for that. The only problem was for me, was that it kind of jumped all over the place when discussing each individual movie. Rather then being very precise and following some sort of well thought out outline in telling stories about the films, I felt that most of the time it was just people talking about their experiences and from one interview to the next, they didn't flow together as well as they could've. Maybe a voice over discussing certain aspects before the interviewees spoke may have pieced it together a little better, but then again, maybe not. Some of the extras that were included too were disappointing. The tour of the Bates Motel consisted of the filmmaker and a Universal Tour Guide just walking outside of the Motel and talking for a few minutes... having already seen this on the Universal Studios Tour, I was excited about the possibility of seeing inside the motel office and room #1. Alas, this was not to be. Also, the Anthony Perkins interview footage - as nice as it was in some ways - didn't really get too in depth with anything and was too little of an amount. I did enjoy the Robert Bloch documentary very much which discussed his writing and various Psycho sequels... that was very well documented and great to watch.
For the diehard 'Psycho' fan, like me, this DVD is definitely worth buying and honestly, as much as I was disappointed with certain things, I am glad that I have this in my collection... I got it on sale and spent only $7. For the average 'Psycho' admirers though, rent it if you can as after you have watched it once, you probably won't ever watch it again. I know I won't personally watch it again, but it definitely makes a nice companion piece with the 'Psycho' DVD's that I own. One last comment... if you are looking for any information on the late '80's TV pilot 'Bates Motel' which failed to become a regular series, sadly there is nothing here that talks about that (which I was really hoping for) or the Gus Van Sant horrid remake. I know that they overall didn't really add much to the 'Psycho Legacy', but they are part of the history and any information on them would've been great (especially on the TV series as most people don't know anything about it).",1293667200,,2618,4.584221748400853
4190414,2,B003THSXKU,"Here is a list describing all of the features of this two disc set and what I feel to be the pros and cons of each.

1) On the back of the box which houses two DVDs, at the top of the list of Bonus Features is listed ""Extended and Deleted Scenes.""  Wow!  I couldn't wait to see what extended and deleted scenes had been unearthed.  Afterall, if Mrs. Bates had been unearthed...why not additional and deleted scenes to one or all of the four movies in the Psycho canon??? That would be fantastic!  Alas, false advertising.  To my great dismay, I discovered that the ""Extended and Deleted Scenes"" was nothing more than footage left out of the main feature of this whole affair - and that is ""The Psycho Legacy,"" a ninety minute or so overview of the four Psycho movies that comprise the canon.

2) ""The Psycho Legacy"" is not a bad documentary at all.  It is just too fast and too caught up in being artsy with its constant barrage of cut-out visuals. And sadly, all of this is underscored by what sounds like Bernard Herrmann's magnificent music for the original ""Psycho"" and even Jerry Goldsmith's poignant, sorrowful score for the sequel, but apparently not having the rights to those scores, the makers of this documentary have come right to the brink of copyright infringement with music that ""sounds"" like the original, but sadly is not, and it ends up being quite annoying.  Also sadly, the original ""Psycho"" is surprisingly given scant coverage in this feature, with the majority of attention being paid to its follow-ups.  And if a viewer knew little or nothing about Robert Bloch or Ed Gein and their contribution to the story and film of ""Psycho""...don't seek any explanation here.  Blink and you will miss it.  Have your dog (or your Mother)bark in your ear and you won't hear it.  On the plus side, it was truly great to see cast and crew members talk about the making of the follow-up films. These comments are all of great interest. However, many of the main actors of those three films are sorely missed herein. Meg Tilly comes to mind first and foremost.  Vera Miles also - if she is still alive!

3) The ""Full Panel Discussion with Anthony Perkins"" is truly wonderful and runs about 15 minutes.  It is a Q & A with an audience at an unnamed and undated and unlocated convention.  Be that as it may, I was sorry when this part of the DVD ended.  One thing, though, that I never did understand - and Perkin's also said it on, I believe, Johnny Carson's Tonight Show - and in this Q & A he says it again and with great conviction...he claims that ""Psycho"" was meant to be a comedy and that the audiences of the premieres in New York, Boston and LA were laughing all through the movie!  He said that the dialog couldn't be heard - not because of screams of fright - but because of laughter!  I know that Hitch said that ""Psycho"" was fun - and maybe he even said it was meant to be funny - but I think that was the Master of Suspense's tongue-in-cheek approach to the dark subject of the film.  But Anthony Perkins insists that the film was greeted with gales of laughter at its premiere - and that is something I just never understood, why he said that and all.  I have always heard that the first viewing was a white-knuckled, fearsome experience in terror for those initial audiences.  Also, when someone in the audience asks him about Norman Bate's shouting out ""I'm Norma Bates!!!!"" at the climax of the original, when he rushes into the fruit cellar dressed as Mother, Anthony Perkins seems oblivious to this curious fact. Yet it is true - over the music and Vera Miles' scream one does, indeed, hear Norman Bate's perverse proclamation.

4) ""A Tour of the Bates Motel"" was completely disappointing.  Here I was expecting to be shown, by our guides in this 3 minute segment, the back of the false-fronted Bates house atop the hill...or the full-sets of the motel's office and its back room.  Alas, no such luck.  The tour is over before it even begins and we see absolutely nothing that we do not see in the movies.  A waste.

5) ""Revisiting Psycho II"" and ""Shooting Psycho II,"" are mildly interesting even though most of the points discussed are covered in the main feature.

6)  ""The Psycho Reunion Panel"" - another disappointing waste.  I didn't know what to expect, but my hopes ran high.  Did Perkins and Janet Leigh and John Gavin and Robert Bloch all gather and confer with an audience of fans at some point in time? If they did ever have a ""Reunion""...this ain't it.  This segment is made up of some of the creators behind ""Psycho II"" and features still photos of the speakers while their words are heard via audio only.  It lasts about 5 minutes and was completely disappointing.

7)  ""A Visit with Psycho Memorabilia Collector Guy Thorpe"" is another short and disappointing tidbit.  Okay, Mr. Thorpe has autographed pictures and posters and the Mrs. Bates' dummy NOT from ""Psycho"" (the first movie) but from one of its offshoots.  What I would love to know is - where is the real Mrs. Bates?  The dummy in the first movie?  In whose fruit cellar is she currently residing?

8)  ""The Hyaena Gallery Presents Serial-Killer Inspired Art"" is, sadly, nothing to rave about.  It is brief - and relatively painless, but likewise pointless - to sit through.

9)  ""Psycho on the Web"" is about a Psycho web-site.

Back to the initial documentary for a moment:  in its overly hasty approach to its subject matter, there is a rapid difference of opinion about the shower scene in the original film.  One commentator says that the knife is never shown penetrating Marion Crane's flesh - yet the next commentator talks about a prosthetic belly wherein the knife blade is seen entering the false flesh to a depth of about an inch with blood briefly escaping the wound.  This was a truly fascinating discrepancy that should have been fully addressed and finalized in the documentary - but it is not.  Hitchcock himself said that the knife never touched the body, yet anyone who slow-motions the sequence on their own DVD will see that the knife does, indeed, penetrate the body in the region of the navel and blood is seen at the point of entry.  Also, very-very briefly one sees what I believe to be are wardrobe stills of Martin Balsam as Arbogast...and I thought that brief glimpse would have led to further treasures from the original film (screen tests, outtakes, anything!) but...no.  Another thing about ""The Psycho Legacy"" is that it, in fact, does not have many scenes from the films shown at all.  Stills, yes, but actual scenes and in-depth discussions of scenes...no.  And, of course, as mentioned in other reviews, there is no talk (except very, very briefly) of the shot-for-shot color remake of ""Psycho"" by - what's his name? - van Slant or something.  That movie was completely ridiculous - yet it is part of the ""legacy"" of PSYCHO and should have been addressed a bit more - if only to savage it.  When I saw it in the theatre I couldn't believe I was watching it.  If ever there was a movie that had absolutely NO reason to be...this was it!

So - despite the above grumbles and disappointments, if you like ""Psycho"" and particularly its off-shoots, then this double disc set is worthwhile.  Just don't expect it to be the be-all and end-all it could have been.  But shining a light on the rarely discussed or noticed sequels and prequel is still an effort to be applauded - and welcomed.",1292976000,8,7416,4.581183611532625

Production values are not extremely high, so interviewees are poorly lit and sound quality is dubious at times.  Yet, if you are a fan and can't get enough tidbits about the legacy this film franchise has left, you will enjoy this effort.",1410048000,,399,5.107692307692307
8405118,5,B003THSXKU,"Very in depth dvd concerning all 4 Psycho movies. Interviews new and old with most of the cast and crew from all of the films. You find out behind the scenes stuff like how Perkins didn't really get along too well with Meg Tilly in Psycho II, and he actually tried to get her off the film. Little tidbits like that. Like a Q&A with Perkins probably a couple years before he died is intriguing. Definitely worth it for any Psycho fan.",1401494400,,433,4.2926829268292686
8405119,5,B003THSXKU,"Anthony Perkins was very entertaining, and this retrospective DVD set gives you a chance to listen to him reminisce about his 'psychotic' days in detail. This won't please everyone out there, but it was a good DVD set. Worth owning indeed. I have been a fan of ""Psycho"" for many years, and the sequels to the film aren't all that bad, certainly not heinous in the way that most sequels to major films are (the ""Death Wish"" sequels are especially nefarious). Thanks Shout! Factory! A",1390435200,,482,4.682352941176471
