4001550,4,B002VRNJQ2,"Though George Romero may be best known for his zombie-filled, post-apocalyptic Dead classics, The Crazies is one of those lesser-seen films of his (along with Martin and his team up with Dario Argento, Two Evil Eyes) that should definitely be seen today, and still remains effective as well.  Made in between his genre defining Night of the Living Dead and the even superior sequel Dawn of the Dead, The Crazies involves a small Pennsylvania town that becomes the breeding ground for a manmade virus that ravages the populace, which has a habit of turning its victims into homicidal maniacs in the process.  Loaded with an apocalyptic atmosphere, plenty of suspense, and enough political commentary that it even remains relevant today, The Crazies may not offer anything you haven't already seen before in 28 Days/Weeks Later, or even the upcoming remake, but keep in mind that back in 1973, what Romero presented here was something near revolutionary.  Blue Underground continues to release some wonderful Blu-Ray's, and things haven't changed with The Crazies, which deserves to be in your collection if you're a horror fan in the least.",1263686400,3,1139,5.112903225806452
4001551,5,B002VRNJQ2,"As soon as I Could snag a copy of this BR i was all over it

George Romero's The Crazies is by far one of  Romero's Most Under-Rated, Rarely Seen Film (Running neck and neck with Martin)

You might have seen the Homage to it known as  Danny Boyle's 28 Days Later

Like all of Romero's Films it has such a Layered Social Commentary on Humanity, Government Cover-ups, and The Break down of Modern Life

With a Re-make being Released soon  (Another George A. Romero Film being Re-Made Hollywood needs to Stop and come up with New Ideas, Stories, Ect. and Leave Classics ALONE!!!!)
The Original will be the Best way to Understand Romero's Vision
It has a Super Raw look and feel (Much like the Original TX Chainsaw Massacre)
With all the Craziness around the world  Involving  all types of Flu Strains, and Viruses right now in this day and age
Romero's premonition is Shocking to say the least

I Highly recommend this BR for All Horror Fans
Blue Underground does a FLAWLESS Job at  HD Transfers
All the Extras from the SD DVD will be brought over with BR Exclusive extras
Can't wait!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Get yourself a Hazmat Suit and Prey",1260144000,5,1130,4.544554455445544

8382437,5,B002VRNJQ2,"Great Romero Classic. I might actually like the remake a little better, but I truly felt the message was clearer and more powerful in this original. I really love George Romero's work. A lot of films today owe him a huge nod. Love ya George! Please make a couple more films while you're still able to. I promise, no matter what they are, or what they are about, I will support you for life. I hope he does do at least one more zombie movie, or at the very least, an apocalyptic movie!",1423180800,,484,4.21505376344086
8382438,1,B002VRNJQ2,"The Crazies is a pretty bad movie. Considering George Romero directed it, it's even worse. This movie is a NOTLD clone minus zombies. You would think that Romero (who also wrote the screenplay) would integrate a more interesting biochemical virus as the plot device. Like a mutated strain of Rabies that goes airborne for instance. 5-minutes into this flick you will notice that the ""infected"" look no different than the non, only they act nuts. It's here that your thoughts of this being an entertaining flick will be laid to rest.

Not much is explained about the man-made disease, except that it has infected the water supply of a small hick town. The area is quarantined and invaded by armed military decked out in paper-thin biohazard suits that lack airtight seals. They coral everyone into enclosed infected zones, and any peaceful attempt to do so disintegrates after shots are fired. The soundtrack plays 2 numbers on a constant loop: a military drum roll that's stolen from M.A.S.H., and some cheesy elevator music that could be lifted from 70's John Holmes porn.

The cast is throwaway There's not one character in this entire film that stands out, not even in a ""so bad it's funny"" way. They all suck. Each side, hack and civilian alike, adds another layer to how awesomely boring this movie is. The Crazies grinds to a premature halt before the credits roll, as if the director got too fed up to finish this mess and just decided to call it quits. The 2010 remake is 100X better than the original, while only being decent in the lineup of today's genre movies with a similar theme. Best to avoid at all costs.",1398038400,,1622,4.707746478873239
8382439,5,B002VRNJQ2,"From my perspective this is one of George A Romero's finest. Love the movie, and the blu ray format gives it a more clean screen view.",1389657600,,134,4.1923076923076925
8382440,5,B002VRNJQ2,great classic. good picture and sound. I like the older version than the newer movie. would recommend this movie to george fans.,1377043200,3,128,4.863636363636363
8382441,4,B002VRNJQ2,"A gem from the archives by George A Romero. It never caused much buzz on it's release, probably due to poor marketing.
It deals with a government project gone wrong. It deals with how the said government would act upon a catastrophe caused by their experimenting with lethal viruses.
It could be a movie about HIV but science hadn't created the virus back in early 70's when Romero made his movie.
A biological weapon gone awry.
As always the end justifies the means, so the scientists are like children afraid to get caught.
To a point where the crazies seem to be the normal ones and vice versa.
A highly recommendable movie about a future not too far away, or?

It's highly entertaining and a very good movie.
Yes it is a low budget movie but in no way a B-movie.",1348012800,,766,4.432624113475177
8382442,4,B002VRNJQ2,"Reading the one star reviews, it's obvious they're of the ""CGI effects are awesome and realistic (yeah right! ha!), film grain is bad, not-like-anyone-I've-ever-met facial mugging is the only real acting, short attention span, give me hyper-editing, lack of substance"" school of idiots.  Anyway, this film is a well made Romero film.  The acting is fine.  The video quality on this blu-ray is very good as it displays the original film quality correctly.  Amazon's official review actually got it right this time, so ditto to them.",1322352000,3,531,5.1395348837209305
8382443,1,B002VRNJQ2,"Should've stopped at ""Night of the Living Dead."" This was painful to watch. Terrible story, acting and video quality. Save your money.",1270252800,4,134,5.136363636363637
