8157083,3,B000KHX7JE,"These 3 tales are basically non-exploitive erotic tales that may disappoint some. The first tale is about a shipwrecked man on an island who finds some tribal women that includes Gemser. There's nudity, but you can't see any full frontal scenes. The sexual content isn't sleazy and is non-exploitive. The only exploitation element is towards the end; this is fairly gory cannibal scene. This tale has nice locations, is easy to follow, and is well directed. The second Japanese tale has some full male and female nudity, but the sexual content isn't exactly exploitive. It's a strange love story with some surrealistic and somewhat strange sequences. It has some nice scenery, but it does get a little talky. The directing is fine, but there's no gore. This is just basically a strange drama for those who want sophisticated Japanese cinema with a well written and different story. The last tale has no explicit sex and only a little full frontal nudity. There's no gore, and it's talky with no action. There isn't any atmosphere, and the scenery isn't really worth mentioning. The tale is just for those who want another non-exploitive love tale. The directing is Ok, but I personally thought it was boring and uninvolving. None of these stories are what I would call gratuitous, sleazy, or exploitive.

The DVD quality is very good. The interview extra is pretty good as well.",1389225600,2,1378,4.914163090128755
8157084,5,B000KHX7JE,"I see some harsh words about this film, and I must disagree. Three fantastic directors musing upon desire, death and obsession? Count me in!

Arthouse filmmaker Borowczyk confounded his high-brow audience who couldn't understand why the celebrated painter, sculptor and animator had turned to erotic themes. Here, surprisingly, his is the most gentle of the three stories, a beautiful adaptation of a guy de maupassant tale. My favorite of the three.

Just Jaeckin delivers a haunting tale of a French man stranded on an island with a tribe of strange women.

The Japanese one is the most surreal of all, with a plot hard to describe in a sentence. Gorgeous and haunting.

If you are looking for something interesting and intelligent, check this out. If you want sleaze or porn, look elsewhere.",1265068800,5,794,4.992424242424242
8157085,4,B000KHX7JE,"This really isn`t a bad flick - as reviewer Michael stated, I have to agree with him on almost all points, but here`s the dilemma for potential buyers - It`s too classy to satisfy the sleazemeisters out there looking for mere pulchritude, and it`s not deep or high-brow enough for the Arthouse crowd. As someone who appreciates both, and who has a fairly high tolerance for 70`s pseudo-sleaze AND esoteric arthouse in all their forms, I enjoyed it. Fans of Laura Gemser MUST have it, fans of 60`s Asian Arthouse flix will love the second tale, and just about no one will enjoy Walerian Borowczyk`s half-written saga, which could have been the best story of the three, if he would`ve just given a s**t. The cover is deceptive, as it leads one to believe it is exploitation, but it`s anything but. Blame Severin for this, as they are known for releasing tons of exploitation movies.",1251590400,6,880,4.683870967741935
8157086,2,B000KHX7JE,"The idea sounds great.  Get three directors, masters of erotica, and have them film three stories for one film.  One daring film for the international market!
The first story is by Just Jaeckin about a ship wrecked sailor which has an ending that was easy to see from a mile away.  So that was boring and not really sexy.  True, lots of nudity, but so what?
The second story is a tad more interesting.  A Japanese director, Shuji Terayama, tells the story of a man searching for the words of a song he heard as a kid.  A tad confusing, but kind of like a riddle that haunts you even while you try to forget it.  Sexy?  Well, once again there is nudity and suggestions of incest, but to call is erotica is still using a term that is too strong in this case.
Then the third film, by Walerian Borowczyk, was a boring story based on a short story that, for all I know, was just as boring.  While the ending was depressing it wasn't all that surprising.
So there you have it. Lots of nudity, two duds and an interesting short story.  Worth buying?  You be the judge.  Extras include talent bios and an interview with Just Jaeckin.",1186876800,6,1125,4.304761904761905
