8461462,5,B0058EASFK,"The only complaint I have is not covering the reason for the front fender covers.  What I mean is that while I understand that they are for paint protection, I am confused as to why they are color-coded to the cars.  White cars always get blue covers, black cars get purple covers, etc (I forget the exact colors, but there was no logic to it that I could find), aside from that, it is a very well thought out and informative video.  Very happy with this purchase.",1420761600,,464,4.310344827586207
