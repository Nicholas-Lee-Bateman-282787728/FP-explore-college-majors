8108487,5,B000EDWKTW,"This review is for Vol. 4 of HAKUGEI - Legend of the Moby Dick, and if you've seen the first three volumes you will know further inducement to watch this anime series to conclusion is not necessary.  If a miles long, planet-killing, white cyborg whale (with a plan) being chased across the galaxy by a Captain Ahab that has gone through the Long John Silver Charm School...and his extreme motley crew...doesn't hold interest, you must be dead.  Director Osamu Dezaki paints his episodes with a broad brush with highly abstracted sci-fi, great characters, action, humor, and stylized visuals that reminds you how great 2D animation could be in the hands of a master.  In volume 4 Ahab and his cohorts arrive at the killer whale's next target...only to find the remote colony planet already half-dead from war.  They make it worse, naturally.",1423872000,,840,4.894366197183099
