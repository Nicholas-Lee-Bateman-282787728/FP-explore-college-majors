2700896,5,B000L9S4GW,"It's DEFINITELY NOT for kids, but it's really funny.  Silly, and sometimes a little over the top, but lots of laughs nonetheless.  I've seen the first four seasons and haven't gotten tired of it yet which says something about a series that could easily lose its humor.  Well, actually, I can't say I was impressed with Season Three, but the amusing juvenile humor picked up in Season Four and thus, in my opinion, putting it back on track.  Though the characters don't have much new to say, the writers are giving them fresh and funny news ways to say the same o' thing.  You're not gonna find the meaning of life here, but I can think of worse ways to spend an hour.",1236729600,12,667,4.390243902439025
2700911,5,B000L9S4GW,"If you are a halo fan, this is totally worth watching! It may be dry at first, but like any series, it gets better with time. I listen to red vs blue every day while I work, and it never gets boring. You may think of me as being obsessed with the red vs blue sega, but I really don't care. It's totally worth every star it gets!!",1445558400,,329,3.8529411764705883

2700972,2,B000L9S4GW,"SPOILER ALERT!!!
 This is just a video game.
Like watching them and listening to horrible writing being read, then this is your 5 star cup of tea?
 Wasting my movie space on prime so I am writing a review hopefully this kinda poop will stop being placed in the same category as a movie.",1424131200,,286,4.277777777777778
2700973,5,B000L9S4GW,"Love it great series that just gives some good laughs.  Yes a little juvenile, but that is the whole reason for the show can't wait to watch more.  The whole family loves to watch.  For those so upset about the language, it just that words, that were created and given meaning by humans.  They are just words. Humans give them there ""supposed"" bad definitions.",1424044800,,360,4.578125
2700974,5,B000L9S4GW,The guys and gals of RoosterTeeth cannot be beaten. This is my favorite of all 13 (so far) seasons.,1419379200,,99,4.2631578947368425

2700991,5,B000L9S4GW,It's action packed. My son loves it.,1406851200,,36,4.285714285714286
2700992,1,B000L9S4GW,I watched for about 10 mins. Seemed like it is a recording of couple of guys playing the game. Couldn't take it anymore.,1401926400,,120,4.260869565217392
2700993,5,B000L9S4GW,Always love the classic seasons to this hilarious  series. Anyone that wants to laugh there butts off and loves halo will love this,1400976000,,131,4.695652173913044
2700994,1,B000L9S4GW,I think it was just one of those shows that took off when it shouldn't have because of the poor comedy,1399334400,,102,3.9047619047619047
2700995,5,B000L9S4GW,I am a big fan and this is exactly what I needed at this point.  Can't say enough about the series but it would be nice if we could get the extras on the streaming side also.,1398729600,,174,3.7027027027027026
2700996,2,B000L9S4GW,"Poor sound, very amateurish still, if they would take their time, have a plot, and maybe not so dull, maybe just maybe it would be fun...4 movies of this???",1394582400,,156,4.413793103448276
2700997,5,B000L9S4GW,Great series. Very funny and well scripted. Lots of hidden halo and military jokes to complament the more noticeable ones.,1393372800,,122,5.15
2700998,5,B000L9S4GW,"Going back to the tone of season 2 towards the end, this season will remind you of the shows early days.",1390521600,,104,4.0
2700999,5,B000L9S4GW,Loved the first three volumes of this series and couldn't wait to watch this one.  Just as good as what's come before and and very enjoyable.  Can't wait to watch Volume 5!!!,1390435200,,174,4.40625
2701000,5,B000L9S4GW,"I have been watching Roosterteeth and specifically Red vs Blue since high school. They are so entertaining and funny, you won't regret watching. Burnie Burns cracks me up and the Caboose character omg hahaha. Great stuff! See for yourself!",1387497600,,239,5.153846153846154
2701011,5,B000L9S4GW,"This show is great! I cannot get enough of them. This show takes essentially 2-D characters with limited interaction ability, and transforms these through verbal cues into fairly robust, and funny, characters. Well worth the watching - particularly if you are a Halo fan. Not for children due to language.",1380412800,,305,5.12
2701012,5,B000L9S4GW,"Ended up buying the 10th anniversary box set for the first 10 seasons. Caboose is the best, hands down! Don't just buy one of the volumes because you will be so upset you don't have the others to follow up the crazy, stupid, awesomely humorous story!!",1380067200,,251,4.478260869565218
2701013,4,B000L9S4GW,I watch this to get things out of my brain. I get tired of the day to day bull. I can sit down and watch these shows and my wife says I go into trance and don't here a thing around me Love it,1376092800,2,191,3.3636363636363638
2701014,1,B000L9S4GW,"I keep hearing the foulest phrases flowing out of my kid's mouth and when I ask him where he heard it, he says, 'Red vs. Blue."" It's all my fault for letting him watch it, but Halo products are marketed to 8 year olds and I assumed the movies, because they're animated were targeted toward the same age range. Stupid, stupid me. The animation is horrible, the content is terrible and, well, the dialogue is atrocious.",1376006400,,417,4.5
2701015,5,B000L9S4GW,This is a great escape. The characters are funny and the story is good. Sarge and caboose are hilarious. A must watch,1375056000,,117,4.363636363636363
2701016,5,B000L9S4GW,"This is a great series, and is well worth buying on DVD.  Burnie Burns and Crew just kill it with the humor.  It is a non stop laugh riot.",1371081600,,138,3.7241379310344827

2701018,5,B000L9S4GW,"I watched the series up to number 4. Hard to describe but like chinese food, after a 1/2 hr you feel the need to wach another one.",1363305600,,130,3.8518518518518516
2701019,5,B000L9S4GW,"The Red vs Blue series are some of the best animated Halo inspired showed ever!  If your a Halo fan, all of the Red vs Blue series is a must see!!!",1362096000,,147,3.7419354838709675
2701020,4,B000L9S4GW,Fun Series. I just with the language was toned down a bit. If the language wasn't so rough I'd give it 5 stars.,1362009600,,111,3.869565217391304
2701031,1,B000L9S4GW,"Where to begin, this movie had no plot, storyline, and the animation was childish at best.  Bottom line this movie was a total waste of my time.",1357084800,,144,4.333333333333333
2701032,5,B000L9S4GW,"I LUV THIS FREAKING SHOW I POOPED MY PANTS WATCHING IT

but in all seriousness this show is amazing and u should definitely check it out",1349222400,2,136,4.230769230769231
2701033,5,B000L9S4GW,"Red vs Blue is the quintessential comedy web series. From fast moving irreverent humor to perfectly placed visual gags, Rooster Teeth's magnum opus delivers some of the funniest content to come from new media. While not breaking any ground by using video games to act out the show, RVB demonstrates how a different level of creativity is required in writing for the fairly constrained medium of machinima. This shows primarily through how each character has unique quirks that have to be portrayed almost entirely by the voice actors.

While Season 4 isn't my favorite standalone RVB season, the Blood Gulch Chronicles as a whole are amazing. Definitely start from the beginning.",1341532800,,679,5.117117117117117
2701034,5,B000L9S4GW,"This little thing is funny, even if you aren't a fan of video games.  In fact, personally, I hate Halo, and find this stuff hilarious.",1337385600,4,134,4.36
2701035,4,B000L9S4GW,"R v B is mainly, but not exclusively, for people who've played first person shooters and thought about how crazy their world's are.  It's also a great satire of leadership.",1336780800,6,172,4.733333333333333
2701036,1,B000L9S4GW,Honestly there are million others things to read watch or do on the net and this is the bottom of the barrel,1331164800,,108,3.9545454545454546
2701037,5,B000L9S4GW,This is another great addition to the R v B series.  To really appreciate this series you need to watch it from the beginning. Being a Halo fan is optional but it does help.,1328572800,5,173,4.088235294117647
2701038,1,B000L9S4GW,"I only watched the trailer, but seriously, what is the point of this? It wasn't funny, it wasn't entertaining, and it doesn't look to me to be worth the money. I wouldn't pay 5 cents to rent and watch this primitive garbage.",1325462400,2,224,4.357142857142857
2701039,4,B000L9S4GW,"You have to be a ""follower"" of the show and a fan of Rooster Teeth in order to enjoy this. Being a HALO fan doesn't hurt, either. A good demonstration and execution of machinima. Sure, the jokes and situations are often juvenile, but that's really the point of the show.",1314316800,8,270,4.42
2701040,1,B000L9S4GW,"This is just some guys gone crazy with a screen capture card and an old video game.  They use the video game characters to ""act"", but there's really no acting here besides the voice over, and the dialog could have been written by 12 year olds (who knows, maybe it was).  Definitely not worth any actual money to watch.",1312243200,,318,4.372881355932203

8160383,5,B000L9S4GW,hilarious great show and I suggest watching it it's asvab improv using a game and it's got some story holes but if you played halo you'll understand it,1454976000,,151,4.428571428571429
