8594131,5,B0016HIO9U,"I love this DVD.  These performances are fun to watch and convey the mood of live, up close belly dance that lovers of the art particularly enjoy.  The dancers are at ease, uninhibited and comfortable with what they're doing.  They connect with the audience and genuinely seem to be enjoying themselves.  Theyre beautiful to look at, and they reflect a warmth and beauty from inside.

This is a 2003 performance DVD by the same produces of the Belly Dance Stars DVD.  There are six performances by six dancers, five of whom were on Belly Dance Stars (Azziza is the additional one here).  I would say similar things about this DVD that I said about Belly Dance Stars, except that the camera work is not nearly as bad.  With only six performances, each dancer is able to take her time in developing the dance.  You get to see shifts in mood and rhythm that don't develop in shorter performances.  The result is that kind of mesmerizing effect that belly dance is famous for.

Some highlights for me:  a fine wings if Isis dance by Shahira and a sword dance with belly rolls, this time by Natalia.  I enjoyed all the performances however and highly recommend this one to any lover of belly dance.",1362787200,,1193,4.570754716981132
