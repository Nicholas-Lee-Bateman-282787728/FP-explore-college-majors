8136001,5,B000H29D3Q,"We all grew up with T-Rex being portrayed as the apex predator in the dinosaur world.  In Valley of the T-Rex, paleontologist Jack Horner makes a compelling case that T-Rex was a scavenger, not a hunter.  Many T-Rex anatomical features point to this controversial conclusion.  Valley of the T-Rex features spectacular film footage from the Hell Creek formation in Montana.  Step back in time and enjoy a provocative documentary.",1432166400,,428,5.159420289855072
8136002,4,B000H29D3Q,"Well done semi-documentary which combines computer animation with real life scientists on an archaelogical expedition in Montana to dig out t-rex fossils. Most of the info surmises that the legendary t-rex was more of a scavenger than a predator. Excellent video to start the discussion, whether you believe that to be true or not.",1233100800,2,331,5.148148148148148
