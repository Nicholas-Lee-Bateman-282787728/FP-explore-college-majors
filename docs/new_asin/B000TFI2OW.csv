2896983,5,B000TFI2OW,"At its best, Moonlighting channeled the scenes from His Girl Friday where Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell famously smart talked right over the top of each other for line after line of dialog. Moonlighting became famous for that, as well as other bizarre but interesting and amusing behaviors from the leads and the agency staff.

At its worst, in the last couple of seasons, Moonlighting became brooding and somewhat depressing. Of course, as with many shows like this, the never released sexual tension between the male and female leads (David and Maddie) was what drove the show. The show ""Jumped the Shark"" at the same time the writers made the mistake of letting David jump Maddie. It was all downhill from there.

But the first seasons were glorious and inventive, some of the best TV series entertainment ever.

Gobble them up when you have the chance.",1285113600,25,858,4.863013698630137
2896984,5,B000TFI2OW,"I loved this show as a teen, and I am so happy to be able to share one of my favorite shows with my kids.  Plus I get to reaquaint myself with some of my old favorite episodes, that haven't been seen in years, because no one shows their re-runs.  Now I get to zone out on the ""Moonlight"" whenever I feel like it!",1283558400,6,312,3.859375
2896985,5,B000TFI2OW,This is a great series in the 1990's.  Highly recommended.  I received the set (5 years worth)in great shape.,1268524800,2,109,4.684210526315789
2896986,5,B000TFI2OW,"This is the Moonlighting TV series season one to five.  I bought this for my brother for a Christmas present.  I order it on Dec. 11 and paid extra for the ""fast"" shipping so I would recieve it before
Dec. 20.  It finally came in Jan.  Shipping should have never been this slow.  I would buy elsewhere.  No one seems to be responsible for making the customer happy here.  I could not even find a site to post a complaint to.  The DVD's are good qualitity, but buy eslewhere!",1265414400,2,474,4.247191011235955
2896987,5,B000TFI2OW,The five seasons are great. It reminds me of George and Gracie Allen with the Honeymooners thown in for good measure.  Well written and perfectly casted.  Good for an evening of fun enjoy.,1265328000,14,188,4.666666666666667
2896988,4,B000TFI2OW,"The video quality is stunningly poor (was it all like that back then?), but the stories are light-hearted and wonderful fun.  Well worth the cost.  My kids (who weren't born til after the world of Die Hards and have only known a smooth-headed bruce willis) are LOVING the show...",1261526400,22,279,4.673469387755102
2896989,5,B000TFI2OW,WHY CANT WE JUST RATE THE PRODUCT AND GET ON WIHT OUR DAY. IT SHOWED UP FINE AND I AM SURE MY MOM LOVES IT.  EVERYTHING I HAVE ORDERED HAS BEEN GREAT AND I AM NOT GOING TO RATE EVERYTHING.,1359331200,,188,3.7
2896990,5,B000TFI2OW,"I was a big fan of the show when it was on the air, and now that I can watch it anytime I want...love it even more.",1358812800,,115,3.2962962962962963
2896991,5,B000TFI2OW,"This was/is one of the best shows ever on TV. The writing was funny, witty and clever. It was nothing short of brilliant. Cybill and Bruce were so good together, they complemented each other so well. They looked hot together, too. I'd say one of the best romantic/comedic pairs on television and film. The episodes were never boring. There's always something to look forward to in each episode (but it's really Bruce and Cybill's characters that intrigues.) It's very well made--it's shot very beautifully. The actors were excellent and it's a treat to see famous and not-yet-famous-then actors as guest stars. Also, I have to say, Cybill never had a bad hair day in any episode of this show. Ever. It's amazing. She looked so good.

Although the writing kinda went off track in the last two seasons, I'd say it's still worth it to get the complete set. It's a shame the show didn't run longer. And it's brilliance was sort of overshadowed by some bad press and internal conflict. I think it still had a lot of life left in it but sadly it got cut short. Some compare this series to the other detective shows that were ubiquitous during that decade, but i think that is not accurate. Moonlighting is not a detective show per se. It is a romantic comedy with the mystery/suspense storyline as backdrop. The main characters' relationship was the real focal point of the series, as you will learn if you watch the whole thing from the pilot to the final episode.

I'm very happy I bought this pack. The DVD format is not very intuitive and the packaging is rather flimsy, but I can overlook that because the bonus features more than make up for it. Hopefully they do a proper boxed set/blu-ray pack because this show deserves it.",1353801600,9,1726,4.618892508143323
2896992,5,B000TFI2OW,Moonlighting is a classic. This DVD bundle is wonderful. So much fun to watch. Makes me feel young again. Five stars all the way!!,1336003200,8,130,4.458333333333333
2896993,1,B000TFI2OW,"I ordered Moonlighting Seasons 1-5 and before I realized there was a problem, it was too late to return it.  Here's the story:  WE thoroughly enjoyed seasons 1&2, which came together, but when it came to the other 3 seasons only half the shows listed were actually available to watch on the DVD's.  I would not reccommend buying the Moonlighting bundle and encourage you to cautious when aquiring seasons 3-5.",1330473600,26,409,4.814285714285714
2896994,5,B000TFI2OW,"The 1980's are perfectly preserved in the series I missed amid diapers, lunch boxes, soccer practice, and Scouts.  Now I have time to sit and enjoy the terrific humor and style of Moonlighting, while I crochet for the next grandbaby.

Maddie and David are two people I would love to have known.  Their personalities and experience are very different but they balance each other like evenly matched boxers- both win the title of most entertaining.

There are so many younger versions of the faces I know now as seasoned stars.  I laugh out loud at the some of the sequences- like Maddie in the postal bin, and David on the run.  Who knew they could both sing and dance?

The interviews are also worth watching- to ""meet"" the minds that created Blue Moon.  I listen to Al Jarreau all the way through the rolling credits.  Bruce Willis with hair and Maddie with neverending legs and Quarterback shoulder  pads.  I missed it then, it seems, and so am glad they are captured for me now.  Worth every penny to have the whole set.",1330214400,8,1023,4.56043956043956

2896996,1,B000TFI2OW,"I order this set based on discription, and recieved 4 individual DVDs, repeat this is not a true box set.
If you want a complete boxed set, this is not the one. DVDs have the usual extras, but nothing special. Although fullfilled by Amazon, not sold by Amazon, and thus Amazon will not stand behind the product.
The 4 DVDs are the same individual ones sold all over the web. If you want the Boxed set, this is not the one.",1323388800,14,422,4.222222222222222

8208843,5,B000TFI2OW,"Yes. This is the series that defined ""don't get the main characters together"" but all is forgiven in light of groundbreaking treatments of what a 1 hour prime time dramady was capable of.",1444780800,,187,4.696969696969697

8208846,2,B000TFI2OW,"The set contains all five seasons with all of the CD's but all of the episodes are not present. For example in season five, disc one has episodes 1 and 2. Disc two has episodes 5 through 8 and disc three has episodes 9 through 11. Episode 10 states that it is a two parter and will be continued but there is no second part to it. There are similar problems with season 3 and 4. Seasons 1 and 2 do appear complete.",1382832000,5,413,3.9879518072289155
8208847,4,B000TFI2OW,"I love this show. I love Bruce Willis the most. His character was so loveable as opposed to Cybil's that was so hard to love at times. It is what made the show, How much you loved him and how much she confused you. Their adventures were fun and comical at times. The DVDs were excellent quality and arrived quickly.",1364083200,,315,4.266666666666667
