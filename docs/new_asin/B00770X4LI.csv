This is one of the best circuit workouts I have ever done.  It is the perfect blend of cardio and weights with a tabata edge.  The scale will move after just one workout.  If this doesn't blast the fat off you nothing will.  She offers low impact options which I always appreciate.  You don't need a lot of space or fancy equipment.  You can do this with a step or without (I don't use one).  You will need dumb bells.  My body changed within weeks i follow weight watchers this was exactly what i needed to get past a plateau.

You will be left breathe less and thoroughly worked out.  I just wish she had a part 2.  It's tough so if your a beginner go at your own pace.  The warm up will have you breathing heavy.  Buy this and keep doing it.  You won't be sorry.",1371945600,,996,4.302702702702702
