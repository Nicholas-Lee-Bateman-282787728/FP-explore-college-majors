8394490,3,B0011B9W1U,"Trophy hunting flicks normally stink. They're either ultra-slick product placement frenzies or amateur attempts to show off safari vacations and exotic game that you will never afford. Quest for the One is a notable exception. It is themed around the pursuit of ""perfect"" game -- the biggest, the fastest, the best in the water and on land. Don't let that put you off. Bill Urseth and Trevor Gowdy use that pretense skillfully and likeably enough to deliver a series of cleverly planned and surprisingly informative hunting and fishing videos in locations that you will not mind watching, even knowing that you will never visit or experience most of those stunning locales and reserves.

Urseth in particular packs a lot of veteran advice into his sequences, but you have to pay attention: he doesn't suffer fools and he doesn't point much out. He does include a generous trove of how-to in his offhand comments and narrative context. He is also mature enough to show you the hunts that don't work out and the points where he has to get help, and those moments include great lessons in ethics and conservation. Sure, some of his setups are conspicuously scripted -- he stumbles across a 300+ pound Eurasian wild hog after a fifteen minute stroll in unfamiliar country? -- but just go with it. The point is to show you methods, game and locales you dream of, and to do so in a way you will use in real life. Urseth accomplishes that. (Example, Texas hog: http://youtu.be/LJcEgvb1pV8 .)

Gowdy, to his credit, is a skilled angler and brings genuine interest to one of the most notoriously tedious outdoor sports ever filmed. His field narration is interesting and easy to follow, although he has difficulty with studio narration. Like a high school student doing a bad Christopher Walken impression, he reads baffling commas and periods into sentences that could, and should, make perfect sense otherwise. But that's a quirk, not a detraction.

In sum, Quest looks like a slick superficial commercial piece, perhaps to get the viewer's (or a broadcaster's) attention, but delivers much of what you'd hope for in half-hour episodes of three distinct parts. More often than not Urseth and Gowdy do take perfect game specimens, but for once it really is the hunt itself -- and not the head on the wall -- that's the trophy.",1403827200,,2318,4.8632911392405065
