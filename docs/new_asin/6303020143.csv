This proves to be quite a challenge, inasmuch as virtually every frontier bad man has converged upon the territory. Led by the surly Sundance Kid (Robert Ryan), the rogue's gallery includes the Younger Brothers (Steve Brodie, Richard Powers, Robert Bray), the Daltons (Lex Barker, Walter Reed, Michael Harvey) and Billy the Kid (Dean White) --- The genesis of this film can be traced to the success of 1947's ""Badman's Territory"". RKO Radio decided to assemble another western about famous outlaws and this film was the result. The film posted a huge profit, spawning yet another famous outlaws western from RKO, 1951's ""Best of the Badmen"" --- Director Ray Enright keeps the film moving with plenty of action, including a final shootout involving a burning cart of hay ---  George ""Gabby"" Hayes is a good-hearted leading citizen standing up for law and order, this time he helps Marshal Scott, and not the usual thorn in his side --- this oater is exciting and should please fans of B westerns of the 1940's along with any collectors of Randy Scott films

Special footnote, George Randolph Scott better known as Randolph Scott, was an American film actor whose career spanned the sound era from the late 1920s to the early 1960s ... his popularity grew in the 1940s and 1950s, appearing in such films as ""Gung Ho""! (1943) and ""Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm"" (1938); but he was especially famous for his numerous Westerns including ""Virginia City"" (1940) with Errol Flynn and Humphrey Bogart, ""Western Union"" (1941) with Robert Young and ""Ride the High Country"" (1962) with Joel McCrea (a coin was flipped to see whether Scott or McCrea would receive top billing, and Scott won despite having a slightly smaller role) ... his long fistfight with John Wayne in ""The Spoilers"" (1942) was frequently cited by critics and the press as the most thrilling ever filmed; they were fighting over Marlene Dietrich ... another smash hit film together that same year called ""Pittsburgh"" (1942) once again with Dietrich, Scott and Wayne --- Daniel Webster defines ""Legend"", as being a notable person, or the stories told about that person exploits --- well by the time Randolph Scott made his best films he had long established himself as a legend in the film industry --- they say practice makes perfect, if that is true by 1958 at 60 years of age he was the master with these oaters from the 50s ... ""The Cariboo Trail"" (1950), ""The Nevadan"" (1950), ""Colt .45"" (1950), ""Santa Fe"" (1951), ""Sugarfoot"" (1951), ""Fort Worth"" (1951), ""Man in the Saddle"" (1951), ""Carson City"" (1952), ""The Man Behind the Gun"" (1952), ""Hangman's Knot"" (1952), ""Thunder over the Plains"" (1953), ""The Stranger Wore a Gun"" (1953), ""Ten Wanted Men"" (1954), ""Riding Shotgun"" (1954), ""The Bounty Hunter"" (1954), ""Rage at Dawn"" (1955), ""Tall Man Riding"" (1955), ""A Lawless Street"" (1955), ""Seven Men from Now"" (1956), ""Seventh Cavalry"" (1956), ""Decision at Sundown: (1957), ""Shoot-Out at Medicine Bend"" (1957), ""The Tall T"" (1957), ""Buchanan Rides Alone"" (1958), ""Ride Lonesome"" (1959), ""Westbound"" (1959), ""Comanche Station"" (1960) --- Scott's age seemed to matter little, they only came to see another Randolph Scott film and always got their money's worth --- Scott's films were good and getting better becoming classics --- so if you wonder ""What Ever Happened To Randolph Scott"", just rent or purchase one of his films and you'll see he's never left us.

8217918,4,6303020143,"Billy the Kid, Bill Doolin, the Younger Brothers, and The Sundance Kid team up to rob Gabby Hayes' bank. They're seated in his office when the picture opens and Gabby doesn't recognize any of them. Randolph Scott does and is he mad when he finds out they've been to his ranch and murdered his foreman! Sundance (Robert Ryan) is the vicious dude who did the deed. He's ready to cut down everybody, including Billy. Tom Tyler and Robert Armstrong are supporting players, but its hard to take your eyes off Ryan, he's that terrific in this western. Where were the Oscars when he was around? Come to think of it, why were B-pictures snubbed by the Oscars? They were the studios' big money-makers.",1109894400,9,692,4.634146341463414
