7818277,5,6301971132,"You can't go wrong with Peter Sellers as Inspector Clouseau!  Funny, enjoyable, it's this era's Laurel & Hardy.  If you want a good laugh and several of them get this movie.  My husband and I have seen them before but not for several years..and we both laughed throughout the film.  I got another copy for a friends birthday, who also enjoy's the Inspectors humor.  ""It is fix-ED""  No one does it like Peter Sellers, so if all you have seen is the new version don't judge it by that.  Peter Sellers is the best.  While Steve Martin is great in many films he doesn't come close to Peter Sellers as Inspector Clouseau.
Enjoy!",1309305600,,623,4.451327433628318

Lom and the castle bit is a bit much! I can

see how Dreyfuss would crack up in MY chief

7818279,5,6301971132,"The fourth installment in the immensely popular ""Pink Panther"" series is definitely one of the funniest.  It also shows just how talented  the great Peter Sellers is.  Sellers is a comic genius, talented not just  in physical comedy but verbal as well (one of the best examples of this is  his ""interrogation"" of the staff at the professors home).  He  excells in his portrayal of Clouseau and his ability to always maintain a  high level of dignity no matter how silly he looks (after falling down the  stairs he gets up and exclaims ""That felt good"").  Everything  from his goofy accent to his hilarious interactions with the other  character's (especially Kato and his ""former chief inspector"")  are enjoyable.  Any fan of the series will love this installment.",966211200,2,764,4.913385826771654
