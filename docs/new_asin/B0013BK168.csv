3102717,5,B0013BK168,"The routines on this dvd are harder than ones on another yoga dvd for ""normal sized"" people at the beginner level! I just started doing yoga again after a break of 6 years, and I have been very sedentary during that time. This dvd kicks my butt! It's done by an instructor who is more than just plus size, so no matter how fat you think you are, the forms are demonstrated in a way that takes this into account. If I weren't in such poor shape, I would have a much easier time of it, so it will last me a while! It was a very good purchase!",1237939200,23,540,3.963302752293578
3102718,3,B0013BK168,"I did find this yoga video helpful. Especially for me and my 'plus sized shape'.  However, the instructor and her comments I feel are not necessary, and gets on my nerves. My goal is once I learn all of the movements and streches, I am going to mute my TV and listen to music instead. The Video I LOVE is the Plus Sized Pilates, the instructor is professional and it is VERY nicely done.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Look-Great-Feel-Great-Plus-Size-Pilates/dp/B0011Z1SK4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Look Great, Feel Great: ""Plus Size Pilates""</a>.",1236902400,21,592,6.132530120481928
3102719,5,B0013BK168,I agree with all the positive reviews for this DVD.  The DVD programming is the best I have seen and is very easy to use.  I love Abby's self confidence and obvious love and acceptance for the body she has.  Using this DVD often can't help but make my thoughts about my own body more encouraging.  She has a very soothing voice and gives thorough and excellent instruction throughout the workout.,1236902400,14,396,4.535211267605634

3102721,5,B0013BK168,"Abby Lentz's DVD is a wonderful way to bring yoga into your life and at your own convenience right in your own home.  Abby is a superb teacher who explains everything in a calm and reassuring way.  You will really cherish having her as your guide.  I really like Kripalu yoga, which emphasizes doing yoga at a slower pace to reap the benefits of the breath and all the stretches and poses, rather than a more rapid, aerobic type of yoga.  You will finish doing yoga with Abby and feel really refreshed.  I really also like that the DVD has several different options for the type of class you want to build for yourself, depending on the length of the class and the amount of time you have or want to devote.  Whether you are a beginner or more experienced, and no matter your shape or size, this DVD is incredibly accessible and worthwhile.  You will be so glad to have made Heartfelt Yoga a part of your life.",1224806400,18,910,4.349112426035503
3102722,5,B0013BK168,"Regardless of size or if you're a beginner this DVD is an excellent way to learn the proper technique when practicing yoga. I recommend taking the time to first view the entire CD before actually going thru the motions. Also, really listen to your body as you're going thru the workout. I know mine speaks to me differently everyday! On those mornings when I can't get to an entire workout - I love doing the stretching portion of the DVD. It's a perfect way to start or call it a day. It simply puts me in a relaxed state that I look forward too.
Thank you Ms. Abby for a job well done!",1220918400,22,587,4.20353982300885

3102724,5,B0013BK168,"The instructor is probably considered obese by medical standards, yet she provides a great example of how a heavy person can also be fit and flexible. Her instructions are clear and practical, even to the point of demonstrating how to move a large belly out of the way to get the best stretch. This video is obviously designed for overweight people, but it would be equally useful for normal weight beginners or seniors.  The introduction is a little bit amatuerish, but don't get discouraged.  The instruction portions of the video are excellent.",1212192000,146,547,4.934782608695652

I would highly recommend Abby's DVD for anyone interested in learning to do yoga for their individual needs. Her instructions are very clear and easy to understand. Abby's explanation of using props, and her demonstration of postures make yoga accessible to those new to a yoga practice or familiar with yoga.

After trying to learn on my own, then trying to take a Bihkram yoga class and failing at both, I thought I'd have to give up.  Then I heard about this DVD, and thought I'd give it one more try. This DVD understands my unique needs, says yes you can, and here's how.  I suggest watching all of the instructional segments first, otherwise some of the details like fan folding the blanket for starting the warmups will be missed.  The verbal instructions are thorough, but I'd encourage watching the long session entirely before attempting to do it. That makes it easier when the DVD is hard to see because of the position we're in. Abby doesn't move too quickly, and although it's challenging to hold some of the poses at first she encourages us to be as kind to ourselves as she is to us.  It's an awesome DVD.",1204502400,283,896,4.373493975903615

3102730,4,B0013BK168,"I love this yoga DVD. I would love to give it 5 stars but there were a couple things that could be explained better for example the breathing exercises during the warm up. She explained how to do a breath pattern but never showed how so I'm still not sure if I am doing it. Don't get me wrong though, this is a great DVD. Whatever you body type you will be able to do this program. She explains how to modify each position to work for your own body and mobility.

I'm almost 50 and obese and I found this DVD to be just my speed, not too easy, not too challenging.

You will need - a yoga mat and a strap, or something you can use as a strap, I've been using the tie for my robe. And a blanket. In the beginning she explains the props you will need and suggests alternative things you might already have. I appreciated this because I didn't have a strap or blocks and didn't want to wait to try the DVD.

For the price you can't go wrong. Yoga has many health benefits. I had tried using some free online yoga classes before I purchased this, this DVD is much better.",1463875200,10,700,4.132352941176471

3102735,2,B0013BK168,"Abby Lentz is an experienced yoga teacher and explains the movements and the process very clearly, and she herself is a heavier person, so she demonstrates the idea well. This might be something to work up to, if you are determined to start yoga. But as a beginner, I found the positions and the stretches impossible to do and she doesn't give many alternatives for beginners. For example, during the warm-up, she includes sit-ups from a lying position. I couldn't do those even when I was young and fit. VERY challenging.  I got frustrated and gave up and now I do only part of her warm-up session when I need a good stretch.",1457568000,3,626,4.539823008849558

3102743,5,B0013BK168,"Such a great workout if you are unable to do other beginner yoga videos. She modifies yoga for obese and even extremely obese bodies. What's so great about this dvd is that she has a great menu with several 20 minute workout options. There is a 20 minute warm- up and stretching segment that is a good place to start if you are just beginning. There are also two posture series and a final section with seated breathing and relaxation. The menu has some pre-designed classes as well. One has everything. One just the warm-up and seated relaxation segment, and two others with warm-up, 1st and 2nd posture series, and seated relaxation. Oh, and the root menu has sections with more information about things like if you can't come to the floor and tools you may need for the class. These dvd's are more expensive but to me they offer a lot. The only downsides I see to this program is that some of it was hard for me to do even with the modifications. Breathing isn't emphasized as much as I would have liked either. The final section could have been seated and then lying down, to me that would have been better.

One of my favorite things about this video is that she treats it mostly as a form of relaxation and exercise so Christians or people of other faiths should not be offended.",1447286400,,1285,4.444915254237288

3102753,5,B0013BK168,"I'll be honest, I'm 30 years old, weigh 355lbs., and outside of working, I have never exercised regularly. I chose the first class to start, which is a little more than an hour long, but I couldn't finish it, which is ok to start, and I feel like Abby was suggesting that as well, it's ok to do as much as you can do, and stop if you're feeling any pain. Some of the warm-ups in that set were also difficult for me to do, one I had to improvise more than was shown in the DVD. I have never done Yoga before, but I like it. It seems to be a lot about finding your center and balance, which is very helpful, especially for a larger person.

The exercises/stances/poses: For the most part, if you are an active person, this probably isn't the right DVD for you, even if you're just beginning Yoga I'd suggest something else. I've seen other Yoga DVDs, and this one does go a little slow, allowing you a bit of freedom or 30 seconds to readjust (which as my size I *NEED*). If you are like me, relatively inactive, do not know much about Yoga or have never practiced, I think you'll love it! ESPECIALLY if you're heavy.

Abby Lentz: Is very encouraging, realistic, and doesn't make you feel like a big fat cow. She's heavy herself, and sometimes needs to put her foot down for stability, as well, and that just feels more real than a model or sports type teaching me. Abby speaks in a soft, easing tone, giving you all the instruction you need through her calming voice, reminding you to do the most basic things you might forget otherwise. Abby has an amazing range of movement, and appears to do most poses with such ease!

DVD menu and choices: The menu itself is easy to use, I suspect that anyone with a DVD player would be able to make their way around, especially because there is a video of Abby describing the usage and ways to put together your own class rather than use a preset one. There are many to choose from, as well.",1433462400,87,1930,4.282191780821917

Some of the others I've tried are too easy or so incredibly slow or randomly organized that they don't give you anything to work towards.  Abby shows each position clearly, emphasizes a gentle approach to yourself, and provides good suggestions for dealing with a big body.  The program is adaptable enough to allow for increasing challenge as you improve your strength and flexibility.  A genuinely good product.

One suggestion I would make (in the hopes that she puts out other DVDs) would be to include a track that is just her going through the asanas, without the instructional pauses, etc, in between.  This would extend the usefulness of the DVD by giving those who have learned the asanas and are seeking more flow and meditative rhythm to continue to use her as a guide without having to stop and wait for the instruction to finish.",1420156800,10,919,4.748427672955975

3102768,5,B0013BK168,"*****
I hesitated whether to give this DVD 4 or 5 stars and decided on 5, because the instructor is just so affirming and the DVD is incredibly versatile. It is not without its weaknesses, however: the DVD is very slowly paced (although this helps those of us who need things to go slowly), and there are sometimes few or no modifications given at the time of the pose. However, the instructor urges the viewer to constantly be aware of their body and to only do what they can. The DVD is very inexpensively made, too. These are the negatives I saw in what I think is an overall fantastic DVD for those of us new to yoga with large bodies. The instructor teaches ""yoga for the body you have today"" and models herself not waiting until you have a perfect body or a smaller body in order to begin.

On the positive side, I have to rave! Abby Lenz is so affirming. She says that her goals are to help the viewer to develop awareness, acceptance, and affection for themselves, and I do believe that she was successful with me in fostering these feelings as I participated in the different parts of the DVD. This is a hard thing to achieve, and part of why I felt that I needed to give the DVD 5 stars instead of 4. You just feel so good after doing it!

The DVD is organized into segments so that you can use it depending upon how you feel and how much time you have. You can assemble the segments into a custom workout on any given day, or alternatively you can do one of the four series that the instructor has already arranged together that range from 36 minutes to 72 minutes. The shorter segments that you can pick on your own include include a 25 minute warm-up series, two different posture series of just under 20 minutes, and a cool-down segment for 14 minutes that is really just some instructions and breathing to some serene photos and ocean sounds.

There are instructions for props (including modifications for these--lots of household items until you decide what you need to buy), instructions for those people who cannot come to the floor and for those people who are bed-bound, and then bonus materials which include instruction on breathing, using a chair for downward facing dog, using a chair to get to the floor, and getting comfortable in the cool-down meditation.

Overall this is a terrific DVD for aspiring yoga practitioners who have larger bodies.

Highly recommended.

Abby's routine worked for me, and I feel as though my strength and flexibility have improved in only a few weeks.  I look forward to the routines and actually feel good after finishing.  Some postures are still not possible for me, but I think I am improving.  Abby is a wonderful teacher, and I love her gentle, encouraging manner.
One note for future DVD's.....I would like to see the instructions and advice for alternate postures seperated from the main yoga routine.  So after working through the instuction segment, we can move through the regular routine without the stops and starts for extra instruction.  Otherwise, love HeavyWeight Yoga and plan to buy the 2nd DVD in the near future.",1395187200,5,808,4.735714285714286
3102771,5,B0013BK168,"I've been trying to get my foot in the door with yoga for the last year. I've been trying several different Yoga DVDs, all with little success. Being an overweight person, I struggled with the issue of going to a gym or class and wanted instead, to flail through learning yoga in the privacy of my home with my cats--where no one will judge me for flopping around on a mat like a confused baby seal learning warm ups and poses for the first time.

Many of the DVD's and programs I purchased were...not right for me. Some of them treated the viewer as if they assumed they were pro and moved through poses with confusing or brief instructions that, as a beginner AND an overweight woman, left me floundering to keep up or even try. Some of them had little or no advice or instructions to beginners at all and went into complicated poses best for people with body types that are already fit and trim, leaving me feeling more embarrassed that I couldn't reach a pose or learn it because my boobs or belly were in the way. I knew the point of doing yoga was to MAKE those parts better--but I needed a program that understood that they were there. And that I need to work with what I have to improve it.

Then, I found this DVD.

First: let's just point out that it's not flashy. It's very down to earth. The instructor is a wonderful, soft-spoken, calm voiced lady with a round body herself. The music (which can be turned on or off), is also very relaxing. Crickets and soothing water, soft tones to get your mind to focus. She uses many wonderful phrases that puts me at ease right away--speaking about body parts that get in the way, how to move your belly for more comfortable positions. Her flow from one pose to the other is very steady but slow enough that I don't feel harried or rushed. There's a lot of encouragement, using good language like, ""If you can't reach,"" or, ""If you can't stretch all the way that's ok,"" which plenty of suggestions on what to try if a pose is too hard at first.

It's very comforting to see a woman with a body that isn't flawless carrying my own flawed self through my journey of getting fitter and better.

It's also not intimidating for me trying to work into the moves and looking at a thin model in a second-sking leotard.  That's just the appearance of the workout...the actual workout is doable and motivating.,1380672000,4,350,4.8

She's not here to peddle products, her movements ACTUALLY fit my body size right away - so I'm not in constant "" you can't do this land"" and even bedridden/chair bound people can practice yoga.  I've been in classes where either the teacher said they would modify a move and ignored me or gave me a move that was equally taxing.  Along with being heavy, I have a triple spinal fusion.  I practice this with my friend with arthritis and a rod in her spine. I'M NOT A DOCTOR, NOR GIVING THE ADVICE OF ONE, however seeing both of us do this and having fun is priceless.

And standing hip-width apart......as my hips got bigger, did that mean so did my stance? Abby helps the rest of be able to have a relaxing wonderful workout just the way we are.

My legs have never been so stretched out before. And I didn't know how to use the yoga products (like the block or the strap) before I did these.

I highly recommend this DVD, especially if you are a newbie.

The only complaint I have is that sometimes she doesn't explain the modifications until you do the second side....and it sometimes would be helpful to hear it the first time.",1348185600,18,848,4.382165605095541

I was very surprised to find that the  instructor is a real overweight large women. When I seen her do the yoga exercises easily, I said to myself, if she can do it I should be able to do it ..... overtime. The DVD also has relaxing sessions and instruction for people who cannot exercise on the floor and for people with restricted movements/disabilities.

That is where I feel the video falls short.  The poses are relatively easy, but adding a chair, the wall, etc to make it do-able for some folks would have made this a 5 star video.",1297641600,37,502,3.99

3102790,5,B0013BK168,"First, I have to say I love this DVD. It's adaptable, gentle and if you are truly a larger person, it will even be challenging. I came into this with no yoga experience and at a large size with limited flexibility. I carry most of my weight in the midsection so many of yoga's poses are impossible for me without modification. I also have so little flexibility in the backs of my legs that just straightening my leg burns. That being said, I learned enough watching it through the first time to understand that eventually, I could learn to be at peace enough with my body to work around its limitations. So parts of it were challenging. But I felt amazing the next day. And then I couldn't wait to get home and do it again and by the third day I developed a rhythm. I expect if I stick with it this will end up improving the the impediments I thought were standing between me and yoga. So I recommend giving it a shot.
The only things I could ask improvement-wise are a better showcase for Abby's warmth and intelligence. I know the budget has to be kept in check, but the quality didn't feel as good as the content demanded. And a bit more instruction about working with a real belly. The kind of belly ladies with PCOS or ""apple"" shapes have. Some poses verge on pain and I wasn't really sure how to get similar effects while modifying the pose.",1296172800,71,1347,4.32806324110672

I will not join a gym to do Yoga because, as we plus sized women know, we don't quite fit in and I am embarrassed to go.  So, I thought that it would be fun to see if they had any plus sized DVD's that I could do in the privacy of my own home.  I can not praise this DVD and Abby enough !  I have been doing the warm up and now the Session 1 for a week now and I can already notice a change in my body.  My abdominals are strengthened and I have more energy.

I used to do yoga when I was younger and loved the way it made me feel, more balanced and lighter. I have done 3 international moves and had 2 boys, not to mention my husband deployed to Afghanistan twice, and have put on a ton of weight in the last 8 years.  I still wanted to get back into yoga. I tried a few videos and classes  unsuccessfully because of my weight, I thought they were physically impossible... Abby proved me wrong! With something called the belly well Abby proved there is no excuse for not doing a pose. However this is no lightweight yoga. She really kicked my but on some of the poses, and I loved it!! Doing day two was easier and so on. The other thing that I love is the format of the DVD is so that you can custom build your class based on the amount of time and energy you have. She also shows modifications for people that have a hard time getting on the floor or cannot get there at all. Some of the reviews say that she is really chatty... well she is teaching something and goes into detail explaining it... once you have the moves down you could turn the sound off and turn on some music or better yet, pass the DVD on to a friend and help them start their yoga practice. I however wouldn't call her ""chatty"" I find her voice calming and encouraging. Thanks so much Abby for what you do... Namaste",1264636800,65,1412,4.130909090909091

Abby is a superb teacher who explains everything in a calm and reassuring way.  You will really cherish having her as your guide.  I really like Kripalu yoga, which emphasizes doing yoga at a slower pace to reap the benefits of the breath and all the stretches and poses, rather than a more rapid, aerobic type of yoga.  You will finish doing yoga with Abby and feel really refreshed.  I really also like that the DVD has several different options for the type of class you want to build for yourself, depending on the length of the class and the amount of time you have or want to devote.

This DVD understands my unique needs, says yes you can, and here's how.  I suggest watching all of the instructional segments first, otherwise some of the details like fan folding the blanket for starting the warmups will be missed.  The verbal instructions are thorough, but I'd encourage watching the long session entirely before attempting to do it. That makes it easier when the DVD is hard to see because of the position we're in. Abby doesn't move too quickly, and although it's challenging to hold some of the poses at first she encourages us to be as kind to ourselves as she is to us.

You will need - a yoga mat and a strap, or something you can use as a strap, I've been using the tie for my robe. And a blanket. In the beginning she explains the props you will need and suggests alternative things you might already have.

There are also two posture series and a final section with seated breathing and relaxation. The menu has some pre-designed classes as well. One has everything. One just the warm-up and seated relaxation segment, and two others with warm-up, 1st and 2nd posture series, and seated relaxation. Oh, and the root menu has sections with more information about things like if you can't come to the floor and tools you may need for the class. These dvd's are more expensive but to me they offer a lot. The only downsides I see to this program is that some of it was hard for me to do even with the modifications. Breathing isn't emphasized as much as I would have liked either. The final section could have been seated and then lying down, to me that would have been better.

One of my favorite things about this video is that she treats it mostly as a form of relaxation and exercise so Christians or people of other faiths should not be offended.",1447286400,,1285,4.444915254237288

3337250,5,B0013BK168,"I'll be honest, I'm 30 years old, weigh 355lbs., and outside of working, I have never exercised regularly. I chose the first class to start, which is a little more than an hour long, but I couldn't finish it, which is ok to start, and I feel like Abby was suggesting that as well, it's ok to do as much as you can do, and stop if you're feeling any pain. Some of the warm-ups in that set were also difficult for me to do, one I had to improvise more than was shown in the DVD. I have never done Yoga before, but I like it. It seems to be a lot about finding your center and balance, which is very helpful, especially for a larger person.

The exercises/stances/poses: For the most part, if you are an active person, this probably isn't the right DVD for you, even if you're just beginning Yoga I'd suggest something else. I've seen other Yoga DVDs, and this one does go a little slow, allowing you a bit of freedom or 30 seconds to readjust (which as my size I *NEED*). If you are like me, relatively inactive, do not know much about Yoga or have never practiced, I think you'll love it! ESPECIALLY if you're heavy.

Abby Lentz: Is very encouraging, realistic, and doesn't make you feel like a big fat cow. She's heavy herself, and sometimes needs to put her foot down for stability, as well, and that just feels more real than a model or sports type teaching me. Abby speaks in a soft, easing tone, giving you all the instruction you need through her calming voice, reminding you to do the most basic things you might forget otherwise. Abby has an amazing range of movement, and appears to do most poses with such ease!

DVD menu and choices: The menu itself is easy to use, I suspect that anyone with a DVD player would be able to make their way around, especially because there is a video of Abby describing the usage and ways to put together your own class rather than use a preset one. There are many to choose from, as well.",1433462400,87,1930,4.282191780821917

Abby shows each position clearly, emphasizes a gentle approach to yourself, and provides good suggestions for dealing with a big body.  The program is adaptable enough to allow for increasing challenge as you improve your strength and flexibility.  A genuinely good product.

One suggestion I would make (in the hopes that she puts out other DVDs) would be to include a track that is just her going through the asanas, without the instructional pauses, etc, in between.  This would extend the usefulness of the DVD by giving those who have learned the asanas and are seeking more flow and meditative rhythm to continue to use her as a guide without having to stop and wait for the instruction to finish.",1420156800,10,919,4.748427672955975

I hesitated whether to give this DVD 4 or 5 stars and decided on 5, because the instructor is just so affirming and the DVD is incredibly versatile. It is not without its weaknesses, however: the DVD is very slowly paced (although this helps those of us who need things to go slowly), and there are sometimes few or no modifications given at the time of the pose. However, the instructor urges the viewer to constantly be aware of their body and to only do what they can. The DVD is very inexpensively made, too. These are the negatives I saw in what I think is an overall fantastic DVD for those of us new to yoga with large bodies. The instructor teaches ""yoga for the body you have today"" and models herself not waiting until you have a perfect body or a smaller body in order to begin.

On the positive side, I have to rave! Abby Lenz is so affirming. She says that her goals are to help the viewer to develop awareness, acceptance, and affection for themselves, and I do believe that she was successful with me in fostering these feelings as I participated in the different parts of the DVD. This is a hard thing to achieve, and part of why I felt that I needed to give the DVD 5 stars instead of 4. You just feel so good after doing it!

The DVD is organized into segments so that you can use it depending upon how you feel and how much time you have. You can assemble the segments into a custom workout on any given day, or alternatively you can do one of the four series that the instructor has already arranged together that range from 36 minutes to 72 minutes. The shorter segments that you can pick on your own include include a 25 minute warm-up series, two different posture series of just under 20 minutes, and a cool-down segment for 14 minutes that is really just some instructions and breathing to some serene photos and ocean sounds.

There are instructions for props (including modifications for these--lots of household items until you decide what you need to buy), instructions for those people who cannot come to the floor and for those people who are bed-bound, and then bonus materials which include instruction on breathing, using a chair for downward facing dog, using a chair to get to the floor, and getting comfortable in the cool-down meditation.

Overall this is a terrific DVD for aspiring yoga practitioners who have larger bodies.

Highly recommended.

Some postures are still not possible for me, but I think I am improving.  Abby is a wonderful teacher, and I love her gentle, encouraging manner.
One note for future DVD's.....I would like to see the instructions and advice for alternate postures seperated from the main yoga routine.  So after working through the instuction segment, we can move through the regular routine without the stops and starts for extra instruction.  Otherwise, love HeavyWeight Yoga and plan to buy the 2nd DVD in the near future.",1395187200,5,808,4.735714285714286
3337268,5,B0013BK168,"I've been trying to get my foot in the door with yoga for the last year. I've been trying several different Yoga DVDs, all with little success. Being an overweight person, I struggled with the issue of going to a gym or class and wanted instead, to flail through learning yoga in the privacy of my home with my cats--where no one will judge me for flopping around on a mat like a confused baby seal learning warm ups and poses for the first time.

Many of the DVD's and programs I purchased were...not right for me. Some of them treated the viewer as if they assumed they were pro and moved through poses with confusing or brief instructions that, as a beginner AND an overweight woman, left me floundering to keep up or even try. Some of them had little or no advice or instructions to beginners at all and went into complicated poses best for people with body types that are already fit and trim, leaving me feeling more embarrassed that I couldn't reach a pose or learn it because my boobs or belly were in the way. I knew the point of doing yoga was to MAKE those parts better--but I needed a program that understood that they were there. And that I need to work with what I have to improve it.

Then, I found this DVD.

First: let's just point out that it's not flashy. It's very down to earth. The instructor is a wonderful, soft-spoken, calm voiced lady with a round body herself. The music (which can be turned on or off), is also very relaxing. Crickets and soothing water, soft tones to get your mind to focus. She uses many wonderful phrases that puts me at ease right away--speaking about body parts that get in the way, how to move your belly for more comfortable positions. Her flow from one pose to the other is very steady but slow enough that I don't feel harried or rushed. There's a lot of encouragement, using good language like, ""If you can't reach,"" or, ""If you can't stretch all the way that's ok,"" which plenty of suggestions on what to try if a pose is too hard at first.

It's very comforting to see a woman with a body that isn't flawless carrying my own flawed self through my journey of getting fitter and better.

3337287,5,B0013BK168,"First, I have to say I love this DVD. It's adaptable, gentle and if you are truly a larger person, it will even be challenging. I came into this with no yoga experience and at a large size with limited flexibility. I carry most of my weight in the midsection so many of yoga's poses are impossible for me without modification. I also have so little flexibility in the backs of my legs that just straightening my leg burns. That being said, I learned enough watching it through the first time to understand that eventually, I could learn to be at peace enough with my body to work around its limitations. So parts of it were challenging. But I felt amazing the next day. And then I couldn't wait to get home and do it again and by the third day I developed a rhythm. I expect if I stick with it this will end up improving the the impediments I thought were standing between me and yoga. So I recommend giving it a shot.
The only things I could ask improvement-wise are a better showcase for Abby's warmth and intelligence. I know the budget has to be kept in check, but the quality didn't feel as good as the content demanded. And a bit more instruction about working with a real belly. The kind of belly ladies with PCOS or ""apple"" shapes have.

I have done 3 international moves and had 2 boys, not to mention my husband deployed to Afghanistan twice, and have put on a ton of weight in the last 8 years.  I still wanted to get back into yoga. I tried a few videos and classes  unsuccessfully because of my weight, I thought they were physically impossible... Abby proved me wrong! With something called the belly well Abby proved there is no excuse for not doing a pose. However this is no lightweight yoga. She really kicked my but on some of the poses, and I loved it!! Doing day two was easier and so on. The other thing that I love is the format of the DVD is so that you can custom build your class based on the amount of time and energy you have. She also shows modifications for people that have a hard time getting on the floor or cannot get there at all. Some of the reviews say that she is really chatty... well she is teaching something and goes into detail explaining it... once you have the moves down you could turn the sound off and turn on some music or better yet, pass the DVD on to a friend and help them start their yoga practice.

8249710,1,B0013BK168,"I have been doing Yoga for nearly 4 years and bought this DVD to introduce my wife to the practice. It left her frustrated, sore, and discouraged. Which is the exact OPPOSITE of how one should feel after doing Yoga. This DVD is just terrible. The quality of the recording and presentation is very poor. The audio is very difficult to hear clearly. And, the instructor's speaking skills are not good. But, the main reason for my low rating is the lack of insight and explanation provided. There is no review of what the key tenants and goals of practicing Yoga are. There is no mention of how to compensate for weakness or how a pose should feel. There is not a proper gradual progression for those who are brand new to Yoga. And, no details are given as to what each pose is meant to accomplish.",1519516800,3,795,4.414965986394558
8249711,3,B0013BK168,The pace is a little too fast for me.  It seems like you need to know yoga beforehand to follow along.  I ended up reselling it.,1516060800,,128,3.8846153846153846
8249712,5,B0013BK168,Very much enjoy the instructor. Very realistic for a person with higher weight or limited mobility,1512864000,2,98,5.1875

8249714,5,B0013BK168,"I love this DVD!  I am a larger woman and was very intimidated with other yoga videos led by women who were in shape, thin and not at all like me.  With Heavyweight Yoga I felt more at ease knowing I would be able to follow the process more easily.  To my delight not only was I able to follow along and do the various poses but I have become hooked on yoga!  I do some form of the yoga poses and stretches on this DVD at least three times a week.  It's a great way to lower my stress level and I am feeling stronger every day!",1504742400,2,527,3.8425925925925926

8249716,4,B0013BK168,"I ordered this DVD a long time ago, but used it for the first time yesterday.  It is great that you can customize your workourts.  I chose to use one of the preprogramed workout though.  It was very easy to do and my six year old joined me.  I will say that I felt the stretches!  I am very inflexible and obese.  I am hoping this will help me get into shape.",1498176000,3,359,3.9166666666666665
