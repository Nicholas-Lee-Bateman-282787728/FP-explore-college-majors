2194922,5,B0006TPDQ6,"Michael Fischa, director of this joke, was a pioneer of 80's film making.  I watched this movie with my cousin drunk and unintentionally, but the first 5 minutes of the movie were pure magic... captivating our attention for the duration of the film.  I say this is necessary garbage because it is indeed something every American should watch, but at the same time is indeed garbage.

This movie is meant to be dramatic, representative of the drug infused neighborhoods of southern California - what it became instead was the most hilariously bad movie I've ever seen.

Everyone do yourself a favor and at least rent this piece of s***.

2194923,5,B0006TPDQ6,"This film was uplifting and fun! Uplifting? No. Fun? Yes! A great b movie from the 80's video store era. Friday night, you'd pick up a top new release, a good category title, and if you were out of options, ""Crack House"". It was very thin story wise. I'll always remember Jim Brown, growling into the camera, ""you're my b@@@h now!  It's fun.",1331164800,3,341,4.412698412698413
2194924,5,B0006TPDQ6,This movie is freaking hilarious.  I can't believe I could still find a copy of this movie on DVD anywhere!,1310515200,3,107,4.35
2194925,5,B0006TPDQ6,Received movie a week after ordering.  Great service.  This was a pretty good movie although I didn't like seeing Jim Brown as a bad guy.,1291161600,,137,4.44
2194926,1,B0006TPDQ6,"I purchased ""Crack"" (the movie of course) right here on Amazon partly because of my fascination with drug movies. Well, this movie rates with ""Glen or Glenda"" as the worst movie of all time. Incredibly, unbelievable bad complete with stock footage! And, it had nothing to do with crack cocaine at all! Not one single scene!

I scaled my DVD of ""Crack"" over the rooftops never to be seen again. I hope nobody found it and actually watched it.",1160179200,,441,4.582278481012659
2194927,5,B0006TPDQ6,"when i first saw this movie i didn't know what to think of it.

i didn't know it was about crack, i didn't even know what crack

was. i was in junior high when i first saw this movie so i was

a little nieve about some things but when i saw this movie i understood what people were talking about when they said that drugs were bad. i think this movie should be showen in schools

at lease junior high and high school because there are kids who

are doing drugs and they should see this movie so they could know that crack and any other drug isn't cool.

i had a friend in junior high who said she tried crack and i think if she had seen this movie she wouldn't have done it. when

i see this movie i often think about her and wonder if she is still doing it. i am glad that some one was brave enough to make

a movie like this because people need to see what crack is all about and then maybe they wouldn't do it or if they are already

doing it then they will go get help to get off of it. who ever

doesn't like this movie is crazy because it's true, this stuff is really happening to teenagers and adults out there and people

need to see what it is doing to people. i know people would say

that it's not a good thing to be showing this movie in schools because of the nudity and bad language but i think if they showed this in junior high and high school's no teenager will ever try crack.",1130889600,6,1394,3.921708185053381
