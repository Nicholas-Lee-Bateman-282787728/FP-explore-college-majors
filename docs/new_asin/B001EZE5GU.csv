3558647,4,B001EZE5GU,"This wasn't the right movie. I mean, I bought it thinking it was the movie that my boyfriend wanted but it turns out that it wasn't the one he wanted.

3558649,5,B001EZE5GU,"I was searching for 'Mississippi Burning', which were all either over-priced or out-of-stock.

3558653,5,B001EZE5GU,"I have always liked Gene Hackman's acting, and I really liked the powerful Mississippi Burning. A friend recommended Hoosiers as I coach.

3558655,5,B001EZE5GU,"I really wanted the movie Mississippi Burning but when I seen this triple feature with Hoosiers and French Connection and the price was not much more I jumped on it. Ms. Burning was a great movie like I remembered it , Hoosiers I have not seen since it came out years ago and was still good but not like I remembered it. And French Connection I seen also back when it came out and this time was very good but it seemed a little hard to follow. But I would recommend it if you are looking for one of these movies why not get all three they all have some value for entertainment.",1344902400,,577,4.115044247787611

8300046,5,B001EZE5GU,"I bought this set of dvds just to get Mississippi Burning because it was cheaper to buy it in this set that it was as a stand-alone disc. I'm glad that I did. It's nice to see the French Connection again without interruption and Hoosiers, while not something I'd go out of my way to watch, is actually a pretty fine movie. Hackman is great in all of these, but he's superb in Mississippi Burning. Any time that you think a film is too expensive on dvd, be sure to look and see if the star has any boxed sets out--often they are the real bargain.",1430697600,,545,4.150943396226415

Connection but not Hoosiers yet.
Gene Hackman is a great actor",1410912000,,215,4.684210526315789
8300049,5,B001EZE5GU,This movie pretty much said it like it was back in Mississippi back in the 60's.  Gene Hackman is one of my favorites.  I have never seen a bad movie that he was in.,1401840000,,165,3.823529411764706
