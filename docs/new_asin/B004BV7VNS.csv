8422355,5,B004BV7VNS,"yikes, quite poignant but disturbing.  G8888T acting.  I think I'd better read the book cuz there are some holes that needs to be filled.  I don't understand what make Poppy become a ""nutter"" from a sane person.  Mmmmm.",1429920000,,219,4.684210526315789
8422356,2,B004BV7VNS,Tedious to watch but interesting because there was a star in the movie before she became a star. She had a minor role.,1420502400,,118,4.173913043478261
8422357,4,B004BV7VNS,This story was so heart wrenching. The acting was very good; but the story of how deceptive people can get with one another over money and position is so disturbing.,1414368000,,165,4.533333333333333

8422359,5,B004BV7VNS,"Brilliantly acted, and such a poignant, thought provoking portrayal of the handling of mental health issues. I saw this on Hulu, and am a little shocked that this is priced so high.  It's definitely worth seeing, but not at almost $50.",1387756800,3,235,4.7317073170731705

Of mental health institutional abuse grounding the modern UK's very functioning as ones could see from Australia a thorough Mother-country follower in social engineering etc., a story tells about two she-Brits, Caucasian and Afro, and their ways to a better life closed subtly by feasting on others' hardness arranged artificially too frequently, intentionally.

It is not so simple movie also has been presented with a lovely understandable natural accent, not much characters' lines to follow.",1326067200,3,770,6.767676767676767
