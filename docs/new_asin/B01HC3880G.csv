7781641,1,B01HC3880G,"Another desperate Hollywood squeal. Too many characters, too many sub plots, no creative foreshadowing, no weight to help everything sink in, bad acting, nothing but CG battles, only thing worth a star was Jeff Goldblum and some good funny jokes. Overall just a frustrating and annoying film to watch. Case example of Hollywood needing to bring in new creative minds and stop washing, rinse, and repeating old successes hoping to make more money.",1466899200,7,446,5.123287671232877
7781642,1,B01HC3880G,"And also, one of the worst sequels ever to be made. The truth is, like some other films, Independence Day: Resurgence didn't have to be made. Why it was made, I can't tell. Perhaps 20th Century Fox needed a to resurrect this brand to compete with other studios. And as the ending makes sufficiently clearly, there's more coming (please, spare us from it!). There's truly nothing to be recommended here: the story is dumb, the script very poor (some lines or scenes are unintentionally laughable), every single joke falls flat, the characters are one dimensional, the performances from the veteran actors could have been phoned in, and those from the young ones are rather stiff and uninspiring. Relationships have no chemistry and one doesn't really care for anyone. Boring is a good word to describe what happens on screen at every turn. There's never any real tension built, nor there is ever a sense of urgency. And they make the mistake of merely making the threat merely bigger (absurdly so; then again, Star Wars has recently stumbled upon that same rock). The film boasts a democratic, all inclusive, multicultural, globalist vibe. It also features a very prominent same-sex relationship from a significant, albeit secondary, character. It may be a SJW dream of a movie, since every requisite box of social justice is checked. In this sense the movie turns out to be quite lofty. If it proves anything, it is this: than the inclusion of such topics, or their filmic depiction per se do not better a film. It may just have the opposite effect, since all felt rather tiresome and fabricated. The movie fails in every department: story, script, acting, soundtrack, editing. But also in special effects. Imagine that! One of the main draws of the original ID4 was, precisely, its SFX. This one also boasts special effects galore, but they aren't of very good quality. It looks like everyone is in front of a green screen all the time. Objects don't have weight to them and all the presentation feels very cartoony. If you stay away from this movie, you will have made yourself an enormous favor. You won't have wasted any money nor two precious hours of your life.",1466899200,8,2167,4.827956989247312
7781643,5,B01HC3880G,"This is a great sci-fi movie with better, more thought-out plot points. While not quite as good as the first one (ID4), it's still great and really enjoyable to watch. I even found myself giving is several military salutes at various points in the movie. A high point, for me at least, was the use of real strategy, and not a computer virus, to fight the aliens. I can't wait for the sequel to come out.

Note: When watching, try not to overthink this movie, the plot or climax, as many reviewers have done so far, as it will be far more enjoyable.",1466899200,17,548,4.320388349514563
7781644,3,B01HC3880G,"Theatrical review.  Possible spoilers.  A mere 20 years after the so-so original ID4, Roland Emmerich returns to direct the second chapter.  And so much for originality.  While this isn't a shot-for-shot remake, its close enough to be unnecessary.  Aside from some better CGI and a few more aliens, it doesnt add anything to the original story.  The president, now fittingly a woman (Sela Ward) is surprised again by those not so friendly neighbors from a galaxy far, far away.  And while Earth (particularly America) has learned a few things from the remnants left behind by the invaders from 96, so have the aliens.  But its the same old battle.

The Earth has remained relatively peaceful, having banded together years ago.  Well except for some tribal warfare evidently still raging in somewhere, Africa.  The jaunty, jocular Marine pilot played by Will Smith in the original movie is replaced by a similar wise-cracking pilot named Jake Morrison (Liam Hemsworth) who is assigned to the Moon.  Smiths character, Lt. Hillers step-son, grows up to be a Marine pilot (Jessie T. Usher) as well, but without the wit.  Bill Pullman returns as the former President Whitmore, who is still experiencing those brain rushes he gets from the aliens.  Remember his cute daughter, Patricia in the original movie?  She was played by Mae Whitman who actually grew up to be a good actress (TVs Parenthood and The Duff), but is replaced as a grown up here by Maika Monroe (It Follows).  Im guessing, taller and blonder, not to mention, shes a spitting image of the Oscar winning Alicia Vikander.  Also missing from the first film is David Levinsons (Jeff Goldblum) first wife, Constance who isn't even mentioned in passing.  Not to worry, he has a new romantic interest in a French psychologist named Catherine (Director Lars von Triers muse, Charlotte Gainsbourg).

The film has many of the same issues as the first and most of the same attributes.  That is, a poor script, illogical coincidences, too many clichs to mention and characters in which were not invested.  Even the characters seem to take catastrophe as a brushed off event.  As in the first film Goldblums David gets the best lines including one where he says essentially (the aliens) like to take out the landmarks as the Golden Gate Bridge is being demolished.

One of the criticisms I had about the new Star Wars film was the seemingly thousands of fighters flying around the sky, in close proximity to each other.  ID:R doubles down on that idea.  Resurgence is a decent popcorn movie and nothing more.  But I don't think it ever tries to be.",1466812800,5,2597,4.85876993166287
7781645,3,B01HC3880G,"The Good:
Whether you decide to see this in 3D or not, it's fair to say that the visuals and action carry this movie more than anything. The level of destruction is taken up a few notches compared to the previous Independence Day (1996). The stakes are certainly raised and the threat of the alien attack no joke. It was intriguing to see the damage the aliens caused to the planet and the entire human race.

Credit goes to Jeff Goldblum ( played ""David Levinson"") and Bill Pullman (played former President Whitmore) for being probably the best vets from the previous movie. This may have been Liam Hemsworth's best performance to date. (Don't get too excited. This is more like an ""Effort Award"") However, my absolute favorite was Deobia Oparei (who played ""Dikembe Umbutu""...or the badass with the double machetes) Both his character and story were soooo much more interesting than almost the entire movie. The entire time I wanted to know ""How did he learn that?"" ... ""He did what to those aliens?""....""Why aren't more people asking Umbutu more questions?"" Personally, I think that given the big time gap between the previous movie and this sequel, I think Umbutu's character's story arc would've been a great one to do a mini solo film. (Especially to get us all up to speed.)

I did appreciate what this movie set out to do, and the direction it's headed. I won't go into more detail than that to avoid any spoilers.

The Bad:
The movie spent maybe 30 mins too long consistently trying to play the ""You Remember When"" game. They were referring to characters and their past relationships as if we, the audience, were supposed to remember it all like it was yesterday (or 1996). For the most part, I really didn't even care about the nostalgia at all. It probably could've been easily summed up in one of those fake news reports in just 5 mins. Instead we're re-introduced to (literally) old characters who you may not even recognize unless you watch Independence Day (1996) right before seeing this sequel.

Furthermore, I wasn't sold on the character development of the new characters either. Liam Hemsworth and Jessie T. Usher didn't really seem to have the best on screen chemistry. Their backstory seemed random and just thrown in last minute just to give them an excuse to interact or have a past.

Other characters seemed unnecessary as well. Judd Hirsch, who plays Jeff Goldblum's character's dad, seem by far the most out of place. His attempt of being the comic relief barely even got a chuckle out of the audience at my showing. (It felt like maybe if you could identify from the Jewish parent stereotypes, then maybe the jokes will resonate more with you than others.)

Lastly, there were very little, if any, surprises in the plot. This was pretty predictable. If you pay attention and listen closely, you'll probably guess the direction of the movie's ending very early on. You still want to see how it plays out, but it just takes a little bit of the edge off in terms of the climax.

The Reason:
Had this sequel came out in 1998 (with Will Smith) it would've been an AWESOME film. Had it came out in 2006 (with or without Will Smith), it would've been a pretty good film. Coming out 20 years later put a little bit too much of a strain on this film. It's now just a ""Very Okay"" movie. A lot of this stuff we've seen, and only some of it we haven't in other films. You could probably think of this sequel as ""Aliens + Starship Troopers"".

Despite the visuals, I think you'll be fine if you skipped on the 3D. The 3D doesn't make or break the movie. I think this is worth seeing just because they do throw a lot of action your way and it is very nice to see it all on the big screen. I'd probably go in with low expectations. I don't think there's anything in this movie that will blow you away or having you leaving thinking it was ""epic"". As I said, it's a good movie that's just a little too late to the party.

The Rating: 7/10",1466812800,234,3949,4.5273492286115005

7781648,2,B01HC3880G,"The movie felt painfully rushed. The dialogue scenes go by so fast and leave no impact. The characters have no chemistry. For some reason, most of Jessie Usher's scenes were cut. The trailers make him appear to be more important than he actually is in the movie. Roland Emmerich should be ashamed. The whole movie is just awkwardly paced.",1466726400,3,338,4.745762711864407
7781649,3,B01HC3880G,"The movie isn't bad but by the end it just felt like Independence Day: Descendents.  Where it's just about introducing all new young heroes with two of them children of characters from the original. With some of the new additions kind of annoying. With the exception of Deobia Oparei as a sword wielding bad ass alien killer.
  The original cast doesn't have as much to do as I would have liked. They all slip back into their roles well though. Spoiler Warning: Brent Spiner (Star Trek: The Next Generation) as the Area 51 scientist who appeared dead after an alien tentacle choke in the first film; is back. He apparently survived no one feeling a pulse and was in a coma for 20 years. Spiner has fun being back even if him back is one of the flaws.
Otherwise Independence Day: Resurgence wasn't that bad and made a pretty good popcorn flick. Some would say Roland Emmerich is a worse director than Michael Bay but I think his direction wasn't too bad here at all. The script with bad pacing was mostly the problem.
  Judd Hirsch traveling with kids who want to be reunited with their family goes nowhere. Spoiler Warning: by the end they don't even care anymore if they see their parents; they can just live with an old man they just met... Them being reunited with their family probably should have been in the movie.
I just don't think it will go on to be as memorable as the first though 20 years from now. There is some fun and nice visuals so I would recommend it anyway. The movie's lowest review should be **1/2 but critics are enjoying throwing it *1/2. Turn your brain off and just accept it as a big dumb fun Summer movie and you should enjoy it more.",1466726400,6,1663,4.421568627450981

I guess I must have forgotten it because it took watching them both in a row to realize how TERRIBLE the sequel was. The original is one of my favorite movies - the sequel tried to cover all the same plots, cliches  and similar type characters - it failed miserably. The character development was non-existent and I didn't care at all about who lived or died. The special effects were so over the top that they had no realistic semblance at all. A good special effect shouldn't look like a special effect - otherwise what is the point?  I felt truly sorry for the stars who repeated their characters in this one - they must have really needed the money.  Toward the end I began to wonder if Roland Emmerich had actually directed this. I am thinking that it may have been directed by a space-alien in a Roland Emmerich costume. To the reviewers that gave this a 4 or 5 star rating I suggest watching them together.

There is an ""alien queen"" invading Earth. The humans get support from a super intelligent orb. This film is visually stunning and action packed. Casey Messer has a nine second cameo as a TV reporter. I think Roland Emmerich and Dean Devlin were passionate about making this film. The aliens that survived the first film are locked up in a giant prison. The late Robert Loggia has a brief cameo. He was so good in Psycho II(1983) as a bleeding heart liberal that tries to help Norman Bates. I like the subplot with the nerdy guy that has a major crush on a pretty Mainland Chinese girl(played by ""Angelababy""). This ID4 sequel was not a big hit in 2016.

7781766,1,B01HC3880G,"This disc is not 4K rez. It could be a rip-off by the studio, or a bootleg copy, or that is just the way it is (hopefully not)?
This 4K picture quality is no better than standard 2K blu-ray. Don't waste your money on upgrading from 2K to 4K. Or when purchasing a new movie, buy the 2K and save. There is no difference.

And don't listen to the other reviews (from the studio shills) that say this picture rez is ""great,"" etc.

Blu-ray.com is useless for your evaluation of 4K quality. No correlation to real world rez.

My expertise? I have been an audio/videophile for many decades.
My AV equipment I use for evaluation follows: Oppo UDP-203 4K player, Marantz 8012 11.2ch  AVR, LG 4K OLED TV.

My previous 2K TV was a Pioneer 60"" Kuro - the reference standard for 2K. Note that going from the 2K Kuro to the 4K LG OLED was an extreme disappointment, but that story is for another time and place.

FYI, the best reference level 4K I have seen lately is the movie ""Justice League."" It was beyond words! Even better than the 4K Star Trek movies.

 The majority of the human race lives coastal so wouldnt they have been wiped out , from New York to Johannesburg to Beruit to Wellington NZ ?
 I remember reading that the last ice-age caused an ice shelf to cover most of the northern hemisphere that was so heavy that he Earth itself actually started to change shape from on 'sphere' to more of an ovoid and this mothership would have been about as heavy and since the crust of the Earth was only seconds away from being punctured....wouldnt the pressure exerted by the mother ship cause the eakend drill point to spew pressurized magma? like popping a zit.

7781810,2,B01HC3880G,"It was as if they had two weeks to create this entire movie instead of the twenty years between Independence Day and 2016's Independence Day: Resurgence. When the film starts, we learn Aliens captured from the first movie are still imprisoned on Earth. We really learn nothing about them, only seeing them in cages from a distance. We do discover a giant 'queen' alien, who is 5 times bigger than the normal, human-sized aliens (according to Google, she is 138 feet tall), we do see her but there is no real communication. Between the two films, we're left to assume their behavior is something like that of terrestrial insects. The scene in the previous film, where one alien is captured and says, ""We want you to die"" and the president of the US declares, 'I could see in its mind. They are like locusts, spreading everywhere, consuming everything', says more about the aliens than this entire film. That long scene may be more entertaining than this entire movie.

The previous film had a lot going for it. We visit area 51 and find scientists (Brent Spiner in particular) working underground on an alien ship held there that has crashed to Earth. We get to see the 'war room' and the president and his generals behind the scenes. We meet a man (Rany Quaid) who had been abducted by aliens and let go. In the film, 'The Wild Life' Quaid plays an extremely disillusioned Vietnam vet. When the neighbor kids come over he warns, ""One day, they'll come for you, and it won't be 'bitchin'"". He probably earned his role in Independence Day with this scene. When the kids leave, one says to another, 'How cool'! Quaid gets to use the phrase 'payback is a bitch' in Independence Day. Independence Day is filled with subtle pro-family messages. One of the more impressive scenes in the film, to me, is when late in the film, as the aliens ships are finally being defeated and crashing to Earth, it felt like that was us. That our future lay in space. An interesting concept in the film is that the aliens don't seem to live on planets at all but on their self-sufficient spacecraft. I gave the original 5 stars.

There are yet more aliens in Independence Day: Resurgence (the way we are able to defeat the hive/insect aliens). We are visited by an automated intelligence that seems to be all that is left of a superior race that lost in their war taking place over many millennia in the Milky Way against the hives aliens. They try and save a few survivors from among the intelligent species the hive aliens are about to destroy. We only see the automated robot. In fact, it's trapped on Earth, in danger of being destroyed itself. At the end, after we defeat an even larger (than the original mothership) Hive Ship that is sent out to destroy Earth, the alien or 'good' robot declares that a 'hive ship has never been defeated before' and that we are a very interesting race. It seems interested in starting up military resistance again with us in the role of the military. It's kind of creepy. What about all the other races it has been saving? In any case, It is all less interesting than the description here.

Some of the dumb things about the previous movie that could be overlooked seem magnified in the new one. Apparently, when the queen dies, the 'workers' or whatever they are, are no longer able to function. This seems to explain how we are able to defeat them. Since this is a major plot point in both movies it could have used a bit more exposition rather than being something that, after the fact, one must guess about. One of our strategies to defeat them involves our flying aircraft into their main ship and then detonating nuclear bombs inside. But no, it's a trap. They are allowing us to fly inside, allowing us to sacrifice our aircraft by blowing themselves up. They're using their shields again. In fact, you can see small devices (presumably carrying the shields) flying down from the inside of their spaceship, attaching themselves to our invading aircraft. That ruins the whole plan, causing us to lose the aircraft we send out on this mission. Here's a tip, why not detonate the bombs as soon or right after they get inside before these shields attach themselves? Why would they let enemy ships (perhaps even carrying nuclear bombs, as ours were) get close to their ship at all, letting them inside? Wouldn't it be better to keep them out in the first place, if possible? In this movie, they're going to let Luke Skywalker right inside the Death Star.

Anyway, we get to see a giant queen monster, and see some of the new aircraft we have, built with the help of technology from the aliens we defeated in the earlier movie, it just doesn't quite come together all that well and there isn't really all that much that is uncovered. There are a couple of places in the film where the intent is to create a scene and not tell a story? I'm tempted to give this one 3 stars (and I am a generous reviewer) but only give it 2.",1515628800,,4941,4.548314606741573

This movie knows that it's a bad movie and is just completely off the wall which is a large part of what made Resurgence such a good time. That and Brent Spiner, who was a delight.

7781902,2,B01HC3880G,"I didn't have high hopes for this going in, but I suppose I expected a little more than a sad ""greatest hits"" collection. Not only does it fail to recapture the charm of the original, it actually undermines its memory by dragging our beloved heroes through a tired rehash of the original plot before killing them off in a various contrived, meaningless, and utterly forgettable action sequences.

The writing is outright atrocious (not that the original was exactly a screenwriting masterpiece)... every character is reduced to a flat stereotype with all the appeal of a wet newspaper and all the exciting chemistry of water mixing with more water. There's also the frequent nods to China that come on about as subtly as a sledgehammer to the face... a painfully obvious ploy to pander to the Chinese market, almost as if the producers knew this trainwreck was going to bomb in the Western world, so they hedged their bets on a Chinese release to pump up those ticket sales.

To sum up, it would have made a fantastic B-grade sci-fi movie under its own IP, but to call it a sequel to ID4 does nothing but tarnish a fantastic old movie.",1503273600,,1135,4.67

When the original came out, I thought it was visually amazing, but the plot was ridiculous.  WAY too many unrealistic premises, like why do the super-advanced alien ships have such an obvious flaw that allows one jet fighter to take them out? Why do the alien ships, which have travelled light years from other stars to reach Earth, take so long to move from one city to another? Etc.

This film was way more visually impressive than the original. A lot more ""sci-fi"" and futuristic. I also thought that the plot, while a bit overboard at times, actually made sense, in contrast to the original.

The only downside for me was there was a lot of corny cheesiness in the dialog, which kind of takes you out of the movie. I still think it was great and deserves five stars.",1500163200,,966,4.502857142857143

7781982,2,B01HC3880G,"Generally speaking, the movie achieves what it set out to do albeit with bad acting, bad screenwriting, and bad one-liners. This movie could've been great but it tried to strike too many similarities with the first one to get the same tone/reaction from the audience.

The movie is essentially the same, to fight the same aliens, win and save the day - which is, of course, Independence Day. After a ""Harvester"" ship lands to take the molten core after a distress signal reaches them, they show up on Earth and cause insurmountable damage across the coastlines of the Pacific Ocean. During this, similar characters walk the same line as the previous film and try to save the day... which of course happens.

The movie tries to brush over so many storylines, backstories, and events that it doesn't give any one of those the time they deserve. It quickly goes over the distress signal, an enemy of the aliens (which turns out to be friendly to humanity, even after being shot down by them), it briefly talks about Will Smith's character and how he died, what everyone is currently up to, and all the little things in between the action scenes.

Speaking of which action is fun, but ruined by the acting and the screenwriters, it's definitely a fun movie to SEE. That being said, the main characters deliver lines half-heartedly and with so little emotion it's ridiculous. I can't care anymore about the characters any more than a dog that shows up later in the movie (presumably to replace the dog in the first). I couldn't stand to see where they were going, the absolute insanity of the things they were doing and yet, respectable actors like Jeff Goldblum and Bill Pullman they couldn't save the movie. They too, given crappy lines and delivered them without the same emphasis as the first film. The one-liners are hardly funny, most characters are annoying, even the so-called comedy relief character was pathetic. I don't know how else to put it, it's just a badly acted movie, with bad screenwriting.

The biggest issues I have is how many things it copies from the original. Alien comes from space and tries to destroy humanity is one thing, but when you have so many parallels to the first it feels excruciatingly unoriginal. Bill Pullman gives a stupid ""inspirational speech"" not quite on the same tone as the first, and haphazardly thrown into the movie as a last thought. After that the President gives another one to all the people that apparently still have old radios all across the world, ie - Asia, Middle-East, UK etc. Unoriginal. Same kind of chase to leave an alien mother ship after hijacking alien ships. Goldblum's father character helping kids out amidst a worldwide crisis. It cannot be stressed how unoriginal this movie really is. It's that bad. The plot is too similar.

One last complaint, why would the President of the United States walk out into the Salt Flat Desert, by the recently deceased Alien Queen to thank soldiers/pilots for their duty when they have no idea really if it's over, alien ships come crashing down from the sky and everyone just stands there and watches. Breaks the suspension of disbelief when characters act so idiotic. A close family member dies and 10 minutes later they're absolutely ok. Father dies? No problem. Mother dies? Easy livin'. Spouse dies? That can wait, while I look into all the new things the enemy of the aliens is so easily willing to divulge.

There may be a third movie based on the ending, however unlikely based on how this movie went. It's an interesting start to a third movie, would be nice to watch if the acting, storytelling, writing, and screenplay are done better. It could be amazing, but I doubt it will see the light of day. I couldn't wait for the movie to end.

Again, visually the movie is fun, but anything beyond that is really going to be up to the viewer. The acting and screenwriting/screenplay are just poorly executed and the story aligns too closely with the first movie. Doesn't stretch it's legs to be something greater, just walks in the same trench as the original and doesn't deviate from the path. Hopefully (maybe) the 3rd installment can change the course, but as far as I see it, this one is lost in space.",1498435200,6,4215,4.71875

Despite a decent cast (Jeff Goldblum, Liam ""The Hemsworth Brother Whose Name I Never Remember"" Hemsworth, Vivica A. Fox, Bill Pullman and the unhinged version of his character from the first ID4,ect.) it is this obvious attempt, along with the performance of the guy playing the grown son of Will Smith's character from the 1st film - the nicest thing I can say about his performance is that it was cringe worthy (it is that bad / makes you wonder how he got the role in first place) - that makes it difficult for one to want to finish the movie.",1497657600,2,788,4.3175675675675675

7782035,2,B01HC3880G,"So, it's not good, but neither is it irredeemably awful. It's more just kind of meh. It clearly wants to be the first movie but forgets that storytelling has evolved a bit since the 90's and so trying to emulate that original feel isn't always a good thing. A few scenes feel just thrown in to remind us that these scenes once existed in the original. I'm sure there are fans out there this will appeal to. Not every movie has to be deep and sometimes a shut your brain off and watch the explosions movie can be fun. This one wasn't really that fun though. It just felt kind of bland. I mean it's not a bad choice if you're working on something and want something playing in the background just to have some noise without being interesting enough to distract you. Even with that though the movie has one major flaw. None of the techniques presented here are even remotely useful for fighting aliens in real life. It turns out when aliens invaded my town they didn't send their most vulnerable member who upon dying would cause the entire army to fall apart straight to me. Instead their commanders stayed safely out of our range and sent a bunch of unmanned drones to fight us instead. We couldn't even try to hijack the drones and fly them ourselves because there weren't any cockpits or room to put a pilot. Now my entire hometown is doomed to tyrannical alien rule because this movie couldn't teach us any practical alien fighting techniques.

Ah well. It could be worse. At least the aliens believe in universal health care. Turns out they can't harvest our bodies if we're all dying of illness. So you know progress.",1494633600,,1621,4.51360544217687

7782038,2,B01HC3880G,"The acting is terrible throughout and the storyline could have been much better. Usher was by far the worst actor in this one, he almost ruins every scene he is in because his acting is so forced and inauthentic. In one scene he watches his own mother die and expresses the fakest and worst display of anguish I've ever seen. Oddly enough I want to see the next one, and yes it appears this will be a trilogy. It seems like it will have a better story line and hopefully they kill ushers character in the opening scenes so we don't have to endure his terrible acting again.

The amount of storyline errors made it hard to watch too. In one scene the sphere thing says, ""your species is primitive, we shared a common ancestor several thousand years ago"" and two seconds later she says, ""we have been fighting the intergalactic war for thousands of years.""
So.... When they we're primitive, like us, they fought an intergalactic war? How did someone not catch that, both phrases are seconds apart in the movie. There were several other instances where I went, ""wtf, thats counter intuititive to what they said earlier"". Felt like next to no effort was made to keep facts in order. If a movie has one of these oddities or out of wack, counter to one another phrases, its bearable. When they happen every 15 to 20 minutes its maddening.

Honestly, its not a waste to watch this but keep your expectations low. The CGI is okay and the aliens look cool but the acting is comparable to a low budget scifi network film. Just don't expect much.",1494460800,3,1535,4.49820788530466

If you're thinking this is going to be a deep, thought-provoking cinematic experience, I'm actually judging YOU more than the movie.  That being said, ID:R is a typical sci-fi action apocalyptic shooting fest with recycled dialogue, a plodding and predictable plot, and few (if any) surprises.  Some of the scenes and dialogue are fun for nostalgia purposes, riffing off of the original in an amusing way, and the Harvester Queen is interesting to see even if it IS lifted straight from a certain other Aliens movie I could mention.  It's a big-budget B-movie....honestly I can't say anything better or worse than that about it.  If you like hokey sci-fi, you'll probably love this.

It was a wonderful popcorn flick full of humor and great one-liners. It had excellent pacing and great well-timed action. You developed an affection for the characters throughout the movie.

This move is none of that. It felt as if the big name actors like Jeff Goldblum were phoning it in for a quick paycheck. The callbacks to the original movie are extremely forced and half-hearted. The lack of Will Smith also hurt it in a big way. The younger cast members are entirely forgettable. The vague barely there love stories are an annoyance. The pacing/editing is terrible. The best thing I can say about this movie is that most of the CGI work is impressive. Even if it struggles with uncanny valley at times.",1492473600,,824,4.682758620689655

The worst part was simply my high expectations for the movie. While not terrible, Resurgence, (despite its $165 million budget) turned out be like the original movie: just another apocalyptic B-movie.

With the history of the first invasion to support the story, I really thought Resurgence would attempt to flesh out a more dire and/or different situation than the first. In some ways, the movie succeeded in that area, but the action following the second invasion really fell short of satisfactory. Despite that, I enjoyed the intervening scenes describing the events after the 1996 invasion. I'm sure those interstitial years will be revisited at some point. Who knows if the creators will want to do that after Resurgence's underwhelming performance at the box office, but it could be a jumping point to revitalize the story.",1491609600,,1174,5.178947368421053

7782115,2,B01HC3880G,"Released in the summer of 1996, ""Independence Day"" benefited a great deal from a lack of competition. It helped that the big-budget alien invasion flick boasted a great cast and even greater special effects. Its many plot-holes and inconsistencies were easy to forgive in the face of the pure eye-candy and unadulterated sci-fi action at hand. Fast forward 20 years later. We're all a little older, but maybe none the wiser. Likewise for the characters in the film and the creators behind what is now being loosely called a franchise. ""Independence Day: Resurgence"" attempts to bring back the glory days of the '90s when disaster flicks ruled the realm. It's a return to a dumb but fun style of cinema (emphasis on the dumb). Hey, can we get a ""Deeper Impact"" and maybe a ""Return to Dante's Peak"" while we're at it?

Director Roland Emmerich clearly has eyes bigger than his stomach. The destruction is bigger and badder this time around, but it just ends up looking like a SyFy original movie on steroids. A yawn-inducing over-saturation of just barely passable CGI, the mayhem that ensues carries virtually no weight. Even less impressive are the film's antagonists, given more screen-time here than in the original. The film culminates in a final showdown between the Queen alien and the human resistance in broad daylight that, quite frankly, looks sloppy even by 1996 standards. Like ""Jurassic World"" a few years back, it's shocking how the special effects in these sort of big-budget blockbusters is regressing to the point where the older clearly looks better, even to unbiased eyes. Whereas the first film wisely stuck to practical effects with the alien creatures and used them sparingly, the sequel tries to James Cameron the heck out of them, but feels less like ""Aliens"" than it does ""Piranha II: The Spawning"" in its execution.

The new characters that are meant to serve as the centerpiece of the story are as lacking in charisma as the script they are following is lacking in logic. Liam ""Lesser"" Hemsworth sure looks good but offers virtually nothing of interest below the surface. Likewise, Jessie Usher -- playing Will Smith's character's orphaned son -- is so bland in his delivery and so under-written, he might as well have been excised from the film's already overly bloated cast entirely. Most of the ensemble cast from the original return (hey look, it's Robert Loggia!), with those who couldn't be bothered or bought being hand-waved away with minimal explanation. Jeff Goldblum shows up to give the film just enough credibility in a performance that can only be described as Jeff Goldblumian. Bill Pullman, meanwhile, brings back ex-president Whitmore as a psychologically scarred headcase. Pullman's arc hints at one of the film's few interesting elements, but the character is quickly side-lined and essentially relegated to Randy Quaid status. Probably the brightest spot then would be Brent Spiner's reprisal of the Dr. Okun character. Presumed dead following the events of the first film, Okun springs to life to drill ample amounts of b-grade flair into the proceedings, just enough to keep the audience from nodding off completely.

To their credit, Emmerich and his writing/producing partner, Dean Devlin, do a a pretty OK job of stuffing the film with new ideas and concepts that, unfortunately, don't quite gel. There's the typical world-building that has come to be expected from any summer blockbuster, but no connection whatsoever to the real world. The film takes place in an alternate version of 2016 where a woman is president (salt, meet wound) and, presumably, 9/11 never happened. In this re-imagined world, we have advanced light-years ahead of where we currently sit, technology-wise. Meanwhile, the Earth is unified, with warring nations having finally put aside their ""petty differences"" (hey, these are the film's words, not mine). It's fun to imagine, sure, but in today's toxic environment, its less assuring and more insulting. Likewise, ""Independence Day: Resurgence"" is a barely redeemable assault on the senses will ultimately leave you feeling short-changed and all the dumber having sat through it. But hey, blue laser beams destroying stuff! Pew pew pew! Go America, GO!",1491609600,,4229,5.126086956521739
7782116,3,B01HC3880G,"In todays climate of constant reboots and remakes, theres enough visual spectacle and 90s nostalgia to justify this sequel. Much like the original, it is a summer blockbuster and yes, it does require you to switch off your brain and enjoy the destruction without evaluating the silly plot. The biggest problem with the film is the addition of a new generation of painfully plain characters led by Liam Hemsworth, who unfortunately (SPOILER ALERT!) survives this adventure just so we can have another sequel. What a surprise.

We really enjoyed this movie and recommended to all our family and friends despite the negative reviews.  I found the fact that they waited 20yrs for a sequel refreshing as it added depth and character to the storyline that other wise would have felt forced or contrived.  Even better, it opens the door to increase the franchise, which I hope they will.

Again, this genre of film is expensively produced pure escapism, as its number one goal, and then how artistically, or intelligently rendered it is, are items two and three on the list of criteria for a film of this sort. I'm giving it 5 stars because of the generally low ratings of many.  4 stars would be plenty, and maybe to some 4+, and others slightly below 4, (trying to judge what some hypothetical group of action/sci-fi/thriller/pulp fans might generally rate it).  it is no (as in original version 1982) ""Blade Runner"", which would probably be a ten on a scale of 1-5 for this genre, as maybe ""The Big Sleep"" with Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall (1946) would have rated (my silly but significant ""10 on a scale of one to five"" rating, i.e., The Big Sleep would get a 10 as an Escapist Film Noir Pulp Film.  Whereas Pulp Fiction, i would give a 5 on a scale of 1 to 5 under the same category.. Film Noir Pulp... i mean it's titled that, even....  anyway, a perfectly enjoyable, very expensively made, escapist/sci-fi/thriller/(pulp) film is what i think of ""Independence Day: Resurgence""... it also wouldn't hold up with the Matrix (if you don't mind the sometimes self-indulgent spiritualism of the latter film... none of that in ""Independence Day: Resurgence""... just straight out, special effects and thrilling waz-gonna-happen plot....  there ya go!!!

Hollywood Pro Tip: if you want to make video games, please go and do so, but leave the rest of us who actually want to see movies out of it.

If you insist on trying to make insanely dreadful sequels and cannibalizing comic books, for the sequel at least, please force everyone involved in the movie to sit through a crash course in the original so that they actually understand why it was a real movie that held peoples' interest.

Further Pro Tip: it wasn't just throwing out special effects to cover black hole sized gaps in the script or any kind of character development.

Wonder why your revenues are going down? Look no further. I am done giving these kinds of movies a chance, no matter how much I liked the original.

You won't get the roughly 900 references to the original and it will look like a big cheesy fight the space aliens action movie. It will look like that because...it's a big cheesy fight the aliens action movie.

It just happens to be a big cheesy fight the aliens action movie that appeals to big fans of the original Independence Day.

This is a typical sequel. The aliens are bigger and badder and scarier. Most of the iconic moments from the first film are referenced or outright reused. It's got every cliche of sequels you can think of. That includes the dumbing down of the plot. Where the original contained a dramatic message about the will of humanity to overcome all odds mixed in with it's fight the aliens action movie theme, the sequel is all about fighting the aliens and the message about humanity is superficial and corny. It's what 2010 was to 2001:A Space Odyssey. A wonderful film made into a sci fi fight the bad guy flick.

But as a huge fan of the original Independence Day who saw the movie in the theater 6 times and has the original theater poster from 1996 professionally framed on my living room wall, this cheesy fight the aliens action movie was a fun 2 hours that referenced all the things I loved about the original.

I'll probably never rewatch this. It's certainly not worth buying on Blu Ray. But it was well worth 2 hours to run through it 1 time. Sort of like Star Wars Episode I.

This had such great potential but it's as if they put a bunch of 8 year old's in a room to story board this GARBAGE asinine script.  My God it's so cornball at every junction of the story you keep asking yourself who the hell are these people.  Been viewing Scifi for 60+ years but CGI without an ounce of believability is a Cartoon not a Scifi picture.  This movie is so ridiculous you may find yourself sticking with it to see can it can it get any worse? It DOES!  Over and Over - As an example - ""it's a Bigger Ship"" and @3,000 mile diameter - a ship that large cruising into the earth would destroy it without using any weapons.

What's happened to all the good stuff from Outer Limits and Twilight Zone where the story had to carry it CGI is sprinkles on a sundae but meaningless without believability and the ludicrous cornball dialogue for 8 year olds and younger.

This is a smarter film than ""Independence Day"" and, not being scientifically inclined, I enjoyed the science behind the motivations in the plot, whether or not they are valid.",1490486400,,497,4.767441860465116

7782173,3,B01HC3880G,"I enjoyed this movie.. I love movies about the end of the world , life and death, apocalypse type things. I saw the first one and yes, it wasn't an intellectual feat. Thats what books are for- films get some leadway. I don't watch movies to sit in a classroom. I watch movies to be entertained . The first movie did it's job. I was expecting a really terrible movie because of the ratings and the reviews and I was pleasantly surprised to find that this movie was a perfect sequel. Same exact quality all around. Yes it does try to make everyone happy, and that's really ok, in my book. It brought back all the great characters from the first movie that we didn't see enough of and gave them a sort of spotlight here .. it was nice to see the old characters ... also Jeff Goldblum is in this one too, and he just won't go bad movies. Ask his agent. He is one of those guys who has to have a certain level of entertainment for the movies he is in. This movie was also exactly what I thought it should be , which is always cool. It did everything I wanted it to do, which is cool. So if you need a mindless romp , with mild and surface character development and a feel good type of action movie, don't miss this. It was all that. A great movie and to keep your mind off of things. It does the job and makes you smile.",1490486400,2,1315,4.061538461538461
7782174,2,B01HC3880G,"I've never seen a movie that made an alien invasion seem so tame and boring.  This is because Independence Day: Resurgence relies heavily on overblown CGI special effects that, from my point of view at least, make it look like the alien ships and the people are never in the same location.  This is the same problem that makes Jurassic World mediocre.

Also the adventurous orchestration takes away from the suspense in a huge glaring way and the writing fails to make us care about any of the characters.  The first 35 minutes does nothing.  Nothing at all.  Oh sure these actors are introduced, but they never say any interesting lines so it's hard to care about them.  Only seeing Liam Hemsworth get smacked in his pretty boy mug did anything for me.  Of course the explanation behind why wasn't answered until later.  I thought an interesting story was developing between Liam and the commander (Ng Chin Han) but I was wrong.  Ng's pretty much written out of the story.

It's a long time since I watched Independence Day (the first one) but I strongly think it was a bad idea for this sequel to be made.  Leave well enough alone.  The movie teases an appearance by Will Smith in the beginning when we see his picture hanging on a wall, but it turns out to be Jessie Usher's character when the face is revealed.  Brent Spiner as a doctor tries to be funny and bring some life to a poor cast of characters, but that backfires in a big way.  It's really hard to care about his character.  At least he has personality.  Bill Pullman what are you doing in this movie!  He's forgettable.  I mean he does nothing noteworthy at all for the entire 2 hours.  He shows us that distinct smile of his at least.  Yeah.

As for the actual aliens, besides the scene near the end when the harvester queen chases a school bus across a desert, we only see the other aliens briefly.  It's almost comical that the aliens have a language translation device (a floating sphere?) with a female voice that enables them to communicate with the humans.  But I'm getting too far here.

Even when Liam Hemsworth and Jessie Usher are are up in the sky chasing and shooting the alien ships down, the over reliance on the orchestration makes what is supposed to be an alien invasion with destructive consequences seem like a friendly encounter with the unknown.  The writing had potential after the 35-minute mark when the cities were being destroyed and taken over by the aliens.  They had quite the arsenal, but it was never used enough to be terrifying.  Sure it's cliched by this point to see cities being destroyed since we've seen it a million times in other films, but those special effects sure made the humans look like they're somewhere else.

Then you have Travis Tope who's the young guy desperately wanting to hook up with Grace Huang's character.  She of course declines politely.  This kind of playful writing only makes the alien invasion less intense.  The little conversation between these two is uninteresting, and hilariously tries to take the viewers attention away from the approaching aliens.  Acting is okay, but on the weak side.  The aliens couldn't take out the White House for some odd reason.  They got ever so close though.  The story tells what's going on just enough to understand (eventually that is) but not enough story overall.  We needed more story to make the movie more interesting.

Then we have characters like Maika Monroe who are thrown into the story for no clear reason other than she and her brothers/sisters are driving to Florida to see their grandfather, but they happen to get caught up in this alien invasion mess and pick up a stranger who can guide them to a better destination.  I swear the dog in the backseat either was wearing make up over his eyes or looked drunk.  Strange.

I can't recommend this movie I'm afraid.  The short appearances by the aliens is one thing, but the CGI effects are really too much to take and drag the film down.  It's not good when you can clearly tell the aliens and the people aren't in the same location and yet, the movie hilariously tries to make it look like the aliens are straight ahead of the humans in the sky ready to destroy.  Ironically the visual effects make the movie look low budget even though it's supposed to be going for the exact opposite.  Perhaps if the characters actually showed more concern for these approaching alien ships it would have translated into a better, more suspenseful movie.  As it is, really bad.",1490400000,,4496,4.619949494949495

7782178,5,B01HC3880G,"....SIGH....Geez, out of all the reviews I read maybe a  dozen or so I only saw 2 maybe 3 good to excellent reviews.  I'm no movie critic, I buy/watch movies for their entertainment quality.  If it isn't entertaining I'll say so, likewise if it is entertaining I will say so.  That said, I found as did my family that Independence Day Resurgence to be AS entertaining as the original Independence Day.  Hell we liked the original so much we bought it, so the same can be said with Resurgence, when done with this review I'm gonna drop it in my cart and we will have both Independence Day movies.
  I don't know about the bad acting that was so much a part of a lot of the reviews; I can't say there was any really horrible acting, or for that matter really bad acting.  Could it have been done better....without question. However I don't think that a little lackluster performance from the actors should prevent anyone from watching this movie. I would in fact tell anyone and everyone to please watch this movie!  It is supposed to be entertaining, if all you're gonna do is pick apart a character's performance to say how bad he/she did in a role does in my opinion a disservice to not just the cast & crew but to anyone who might think they want to watch this movie.  Reading all these bad reviews will prevent those who were on the fence about watching this movie will in fact lead them to believe this is a horrible movie when it is not!
  Please don't take my word as the end all, just take all these poor reviews with a grain of salt, hell take all these reviews with a grain of salt, watch the movie and then, and only then make an informed decision about this movie, personally....myself and my family found it to be a very good, very entertaining movie damn near as good as the first.  Wish they would have had Will Smith back as a bird Col, or maybe a 1 star.  Just my opinion.  This movie though leaves it wide open fo another movie in the same genre maybe only going on a tangent from Independence Day.",1490400000,,2015,4.321808510638298

7782249,1,B01HC3880G,"I loved the first Independence Day movie. It was a lot of fun. This sequel is a huge let down. They got poor acting results from the few veteran actors that made the mistake of reprising their roles, and almost no acting from the new cast. It is a crappy attempt to cash in on the Independence Day name.

Snazzy CGI graphics do not make up for poor directing and lackluster acting. The story is simplistic... the aliens return, start wrecking the earth, the wacky scientists come up with a hair brain way to fly a single ship loaded with ""cold fusion bombs"" into the alien mother ship. Yeah pretty much the same plot as the first movie, without Will Smith. There is currently no accepted theoretical model that would allow cold fusion to occur, but thats what the writers went with. The bomb destroys the alien mother ship... but somehow the Queen survives and charges across the desert looking for a little payback on Area 51. Meanwhile a bus load of idiots is right in the Queen's path... being driven by Jeff Goldblum and his father. Of course the alien is destroyed (cue the scenes of people all over the world celebrating). But wait! There is more cheesy badness to come... because the alien device that the wacky scientists have is full of new weapon plans and a plot to take the war into space.... yes a badly conceived third sequel.

There just seemed to be very little originality in the plot.  There really wasn't much new information on the Aliens other than the super large Queen Alien.  The supposed new Aliens who were supposed to have caused the first Aliens much fear, really did very little to help the people of Earth.  So very disappointing.

Will Smith is not in this movie which is disappointing. In my opinion he was one of the main standouts of the 1996 film. Jeff Goldblum and Bill Pullman both return for this film. So do Vivica A. Fox (Who plays Will Smith's wife in the first film's character) dies early on in this film, Judd Hirsch and the guy who plays Dr. Okin (I can't remember his name). There are also some new characters in this film. Jeff Goldblum's ""David"" is once again the films genius. There are lots of special effects in this film which seem very over the top. The aliens are even scarier this time around. Though this film wasn't near as good as the first it will keep the viewer on the edge of his/her seat.

It does lack the original 'Tension' and the humor that attracted me to #1. Brent Spiner is brilliant in his role as the Mad Science Professor that is awakened when the next Mothership appears. Of course there is a 'countdown' to annihilation, plot twists are tame and the ending is as expected.
CGI is well done, the aliens are well done but would have liked there to be a bit more 'Plot', rather than action. Still, I enjoyed it and would recommend it to those that wish to continue the story...

I could withstand a direct hit from a Michael Bay movie, but this hurt like a lie from a friend.  Hell, I liked Pacific Rim better than this, and I don't think I can level a more scathing comment.  I couldn't care about the way certain characters cared about each other.  The actors seemed to have no idea what actions the graphics were portraying them doing.  The writers seemed to have concussions and I like to think they could have done better had they worn helmets.  They leaned hard on the old material to clumsily establish the backstory.  They leaned hard on the graphics midway through to establish the conflict.  They leaned hard on a crate full of stupid to resolve it all, and then lots of pretty people pretended to be happy.  I failed completely to care about the valedictorian felt about the Chinese top-gun character with the cosmetic surgery eyes.  There was a lot of budget and effort here and I hope somebody had some kind of explanation for what went wrong.  I'm at a loss to explain.  When it was over I noted the 1hr 59min runtime and maybe making that happen was the real problem, but as an excuse or explanation that doesn't really help much.

7782350,2,B01HC3880G,"I was a fan of the original. Not so much with the new and improved. First off this movie had absolutely no story telling, it goes from everyone on the planet is at peace to the enemy is at our front door within twelve minutes. Not only at the front door but kicks down the door even though they have the exact same technology! They could have played to the effect that it was a challenge and that the aliens weren't expecting a real fight. For god sake earthlings have been preparing for 20 years for their return, and get spanked in minutes?! But, instead they went with the exact same thing in the previous move, oh but wait they through in a twist the queen didn't die...oh noooo!

The acting was ridiculous, and emotionless as if they studied Kristin Stewart acting guide. The relationship between Liam Hemsworth and the girl (sorry don't remember her name) was a pathetic attempt to make this a love story like the original movie. Then there is the intense dog fight for survival, that you could not tell was happening by the pilots faces. It almost looked like they were having fun, even though they were out numbered out gunned and friends being blown out of the sky. As, if that wasn't enough it felt they had to hire the father of Jeff Goldblum, he played no significant role at all, his role in the move goes like this: Talks to the elderly in a senior citizens home about his failing book, on a boat sees the mother ship, found on the boat by kids driving a car after the alien ship creates a tsunami, finds a school bus, drives in the desert and stumbles upon his son, THE END pointless. Will Smith's son in this movie rushes home to save his mother only to find her on the top of the building, within seconds is able to get someone to rescue her but she falls to her death, he was sad for maybe 5 minutes then doesn't mention her ever again and is smiling at the end as if he didn't just lose his mother like 2 hours ago (their time)! The ex-president is clinically insane and has super powers, on a cane he is able to hobble away in a blink of an eye without anyone noticing, override security codes (because they kept everything the same), stepped into a chamber and sent for a captured alien, that scene blew my mind. Let me set up another scene for you. Your an ex-president who has lost his mind and now is a alien whisperer, and is sporting a full homeless man beard, you have decided to use the same plan as before to kill your enemy and you have less than an hour to do it. Did the ex-president prepare and strategize with a team? Nope, he disappeared again and came back freshly shaven wtf!

Triva Question: Who are pilots in this movie? Answer: Everyone! the ex President is a pilot, his daughter is a pilot, Will Smith is dead, his son's a pilot, Jeff Goldblum is a pilot, a one time Pilot in the service almost kills his friend. Gets kicked out of service, still becomes a pilot. His buddy a technical specialist, becomes a pilot at the end of the movie flying advanced alien aircraft. In the future everyone becomes a pilot. The new sworn in president an ex-pilot. This is like a show on Oprah, ""you're a pilot, you're a pilot, you're a pilot, every one is a PILOOOOT""",1486425600,3,3194,4.330550918196995

He really seems to be going through motions these days --- so much so that it's easy to imagine him punching a time clock to collect his 7 figure directing fee. Such a shame.

7782436,1,B01HC3880G,"I liked the first Independence Film, this one is terrible.  This review contains spoilers. First off the acting even from the big actors was bland and lacked any real emotion.  The action scenes that involved cockpit scenes of flying aircraft and dog-fighting was missing the intensity of danger and risk. Did the producers forget to mention to their actors, ""Hey you need to act like your scared and brave at the same time"". The love interests between Liam Hemsworth and what ever her name is, is well maybe they were seeing some one else, on the verge of breaking up or maybe one them was secretly gay and waiting for the apocalypse to arrive to break the news.  Anyways the romance between these two was as emotional as watching Kristen Stewart act.

The absolute coincidence of scenes is ridiculous.  I'm going to un-dock my space craft, fly into earth and see my mother on a rooftop in a major city, call in a Helicopter, that incidentally gets there within 5 seconds but that wasn't fast enough she falls to her death....NOOOOOO.  Hey look a another major actor I find a bus at a gas station filled with kids, I get to be the hero today. Nope. Why in the hell, I magically ended up driving in the middle of the desert and find a military convoy and just happens to be a decoy powerful enough to kill the Hive queen.  Oh snap, the decoy fails, the queen wants to kill me now, because im in a big yellow bus.

Or we find out at the end of the movie, that the first alien aircraft we shoot down was actually an ally that came to provide far more advanced capabilities that will help destroy the alien that's incoming right behind them.  Good thing.... because that Ally is so advanced it came with no defensive abilities what so ever which is how we shoot it down so easily.

Oh yeah, the ex President is a pilot, his daughter is a pilot, Will Smith is dead, his son's a pilot, Jeff Goldblum is a pilot, a one time Pilot in the service almost kills his friend.  Gets kicked out of service, still becomes a pilot.  The new sworn in president an ex-pilot. His buddy a technical specialist, becomes a pilot at the end of the movie flying advanced alien aircraft. In the future everyone becomes a pilot even the janitors.

There's barely more than 2 sentences of dialogue between two people at any given time.  Honestly the amount of dialogue you could probably write on one side of college ruled paper.

I love sci-fi movies and easily overlook flaws for good story or exciting scenes.  If it wasn't for major Actors, this movie easily could of been marked as a B-movie.  This is Hollywood big budget at its worst.",1485561600,3,2614,4.457983193277311

7782438,3,B01HC3880G,"I did like the new special effects. Liked that very much actually. Really liked the fact that some of the original characters returned. And that new alien spaceship is AWESOME!

However, there is just so many things that I didn't care for. The new characters, for example. Most of the new characters had little to no backstory (this lead to me not caring if a character lived or died). And there was a few scenes that just screamed 1996 Independence Day (I won't say which ones, though). And some scenes that seemed very corny. And I'm confident that a certain silver ball was thought up at the last second to give it a plot twist (Seriously? THAT's why the aliens attacked in the first movie?).

Yes, some of the points were forced (I agree with one reviewer that couldn't understand why they bothered with a history between Capt Hiller and Lt whatshisname- it added nada), maybe even a little heavy handed, but it was in the first one too.

If there's one thing we've learned is that these government types just don't listen. You know, this whole thing could have been avoided if those governmental authorities had been more reasonable.

Of course there are some nits to the story. You know, an alien invasion that promises to become an extinction event is NOT the time to kindle a romance -- it just isn't. One would expect with such extreme danger that people would get down to business and save the planet and not act like they were about to go on Dr. Phil or the Jerry Springer show. It's dangerous behavior, considering. Losing is not an option. Stay on focus, people!

Nevertheless, the plot, though somewhat obvious was somewhat convoluted, some characters got better, others got worse and some never seemed to progress.

It was reported that Will Smith demanded fifty million dollars for the next two sequels.  He ended up a picture on a wall and a heros fate.  I think he should count his blessings that he wasn't in this film.
Not much can be said about the simplistic plot.  Its a wonder the aliens waited 20 years to retaliate and then we learn they only needed to use this planet for refueling purposes!  How ignominious.  The dialog was sparse, the usual claptrap, macho jingoistic clatter.  (They even tossed in that horribly overused clich that was my bad.)  I cringed a lot.
They manufactured tension, a history of no substance, between the two main characters.  None of it was necessary nor did it make any sense.  In the end, this was just a lot of cardboard people flying fancy space craft.
Another sequel is contingent upon the box office returns of this bedazzled monstrosity.
This pile of space debris cost them $165-million.  They reaped a bit of chump change with $398.7-million.  Enough to support a third installment?",1484179200,,1288,4.678571428571429

Why does this movie suck?? Zero character development. Plot is super rushed. The risks taken by some of the protagonists are so outlandish and unfounded, I found myself rolling my eyes more than actually looking at the movie.

As in most sequels they pathetically  drag out some original cast for cameos in an attempt to give it  authenticity.  They sadly are the only true actors although past their prime in the movie. The purpose like many plot thin movies seems to be solely to highlight low budget animation with most all scenes being blatantly artificial. I enjoyed the original which was a fun movie and was not expecting something thought provoking or deep. However this was so thin in everyway except highlighting Hollywood's love for overdone animation. Although I unfortunately purchased for a low price it was a total waste of money and time.

surround channels effectively and noticeably. The set designs are
beautifully rendered whether in the Area 51 bases or the alien mother

nice touch, well done!), the examples of alien technology transforming
the world was very well done, the mention of anti-gravity space crafts,
and architecture is thought provoking, well done for giving us
something to ponder. I would love to see more CGI in the next film,
although the CGI in this film was money well spent and is glorious to
look out (compliments to all the parties responsible, fantastic job!),
The story line is very good, new twists and elements that I did not
expect (and believe me I have seen just about everything and read
everything so for you to surprise me is definitely a good thing, this
is regarding the special surprise in the film, the rest of you will
have to see the film to find out I am not going to tell you what it is
but its good!)

Okay this part for the Director Roland Emmerich please take note:

As I mentioned the dialogue that the presidents make are cheesy, corny
and propaganda-ish, please for part 3 while writing the screenplay with
Woods, Devlin and Vanderbilt just take a closer look at how the real
politicians, presidents talk regarding real world crisis and conflicts,
its all pretty serious and straight forward, when inspirational
speeches are made they touch on real issues and to the heart of the
people. Besides that the story is well put together Goldblum's
character mentions ""We're taking the fight to them"" Wow!, I look
forward to part 3 and the element I spoke about above needs to be fully
explored by Brent Spiner's character is very promising. I do hope you
will get rid of that long hair, have him, Goldblum, Hemsworht, Fichtner
and Pullman as well as Monroe's, and Jessie Usher's character's make
the journey to battle the aliens. Do have Spiner's character be more
intelligent and show us a more serious analytical scientist as he make
his theories and test them, you can keep the goofiness but please just
execute it intelligently to guarantee chuckles or laughs (he can pull
both the intelligence and humor off, after all he was data in Star trek
next generation). Fichtner and Pullman were both excellent please have
Pullman somehow return in part 3 yes, and also the neurosis or anxiety
can be handled better, with more finesse it will improve the
presentation. Fichtner also handled his role excellently he needs to be
leading the charge to battle the aliens, steals the movie with his
performance. Sela Ward makes a great Madamme President,she has a
presence that is compelling and interesting, bring her back in part 3.
She also holds the key to exploit a very important part of the film
that the world has come together and works as one to improve the human
condition and to touch on how important and great such an event is and
how it can lead to the next stage of human evolution, its a familiar
theme in famous sci-fi stories but can be expounded on here, especially
in part 3. Consequently there seems to me to be enough here if very
carefully and artfully done, for a part 4! Goldblum, Hemsworth and
Hirsch's characters and performance are great. I would love to see
Hirsch's character interacting in more significant and meaningful
situations, yet with that witty humor of his, to explain the human
reaction to the aliens, or other situations with the kids from part one
and making significant discoveries, Goldblum's character is his son so
he has been exposed to special knowledge no one else has, this can make
his role better. Do keep the humor between Goldblum and Hirsch's
characters it works, just ensure that it's smart, witty humor to keep
us chuckling, even if in part 3 it may have to be done over video
conferencing, since Goldblum's character will be on a spacecraft and on
the front lines as he needs to be, along with Hemsworth, Pullman,
Fichtner, Spiner, Monroe and Jessie Ushers characters. I would love to
see the rivalry between Usher's and Hemsworth characters be resolved
and a strong teamwork between them, Monroe, Angela Yeung Wing, Fichtner
and Pullman's team as a squadron should be electrifying. Hemsworth
character needs to show us why he's the hero by leading the charge, put
him in situations where he has to lead a small group of elite fighters
into the enemy stronghold along with the other characters mentioned who
are all an excellent group and have him share screen time in such a
situation with Fichtner, Pullman and the others, on the ground on one
of those excellent alien spacecraft sets looking for whatever they need
and a throw down battle scene with many of these elite fighters under
Pullman, Fichtner's and Hemsworth lead both on ground and leading
aerial attacks, this is pure thrills and excitement if done carefully
with great attention to details, lines and tight, choreographed battle
scenes as you had in this movie. You are definitely on the right track,
there is tremendous potential you have here, make it happen! see you in
ID3!  p.s. Will Smith's character was missed. he should be in part 3 even as a clone or a hologram where he shows up a few times with important information.",1483833600,,5569,4.698055271238485

Just like those other really horrible sequels out there that NEVER SHOULD HAVE BEEN MADE and therefore don't exist in the minds of the faithful, there is no, and never has been, a sequel to the 1996 movie ""Independence Day.""
Save yourself the money and don't buy this. If somebody offers to lend the movie to you, save yourself the time. Don't watch it. Yes- it really is that bad. You will never get that 120 minutes of your life back.

The movie did have three redeeming features: 1) the special effects (except the obvious green screen in the last scene) were fantastic; 2) half way through this train wreck of a movie, we started just laughing at how stupid it was. We had a good bonding moment because my girlfriend and I both thought it was so stupid we just had to laugh. It was either that or get angry at the wasted time and money; and 3) it can be held up to all aspiring movie professionals (yes- pretty much all of them) as a prime example of what not to do.",1483747200,,1128,4.295774647887324

It is contradictory to the original in many ways and it does make you wonder if the person who wrote this was at all familiar withe the original movie.  Minor Spoiler alert....

This movie is completely unbelievable.  Twenty years after the near total destruction of all major cities on earth, human civilization is not only enjoying all the pre-war benefits of our modern world, there is now a militarized moon base and a lot of alien technology on hand.  Oh, and major plot twist, those aliens that were defeated in the first movie, you know the ones we were led to believe represented their entire civilization?  They weren't.  They managed to get off a distress call (was it after the mother ship was nuked or did they guess our dastardly plans and the terrible outcome?) that only took 20 years to be received and acted upon.  Not only did their contingency in the original movie not represent the scope of their species, it was just a small segment.

Yes, I was a lot younger back then and more easily impressed by movies, but there is no cohesion to this film.  The film jumps around from random plot to random plot.  And honestly, the people in the film should stop using countdowns before they fire their weapons because the aliens seem to blow up the human weapons multiple times before the countdown is over.  This film felt like a bad sci-fi movie with no real connection to the first film.  If you rent it for a couple of dollars, you will probably be ok.

7782717,1,B01HC3880G,"The first was so amazing! What could possibly go wrong with a sequel?

I was so naive. Apparently everything can go wrong.

The storyline of the first movie is completely invalidated by this one. Why invade a planet in a costly war to exterminate the surface life up close if all you intend to do is plant a ship on it so large that the act of landing would snuff out the entire atmosphere like a cheap match?

Why rig all of your technology to shut off when the commander is killed?

Why would a biologically advanced species be limited by the evolutionary anchor of a giant queen they make no effort to protect, even in her final moments fighting for life?

Whereas the book and first movie established the biology of this species as a parasite that invades a host (the so-called suit), this movie pretends that that was never the case and even the queen has an impossible large suit

The method of killing the queen is soundly established by the movie's own plot as being non-lethal. Attacking from behind was shown to be a method for disabling the suit and forcing the alien to emerge. Once emerged it is vulnerable and weak. Somehow all of this changed with the queen and the non-lethal act was suddenly lethal.

And can someone tell me why everyone and their dog knows how to ""override"" every critical and classified system in a modern sci-fi flick? Decades of exposure to advanced technology and dual-authentication is still beyond their grasp? PLEASE hollywood get a clue

Each movie likes to have a rousing moment where the protagonist makes a speech, but this movie had that moment at least 4 times and it was done wrong each time.

No fewer than 70% of the characters, dialogue, scenes, and plot, could be completely removed from the movie and have no impact on the quality of it.

If the aliens that were captured were catatonic in the absence of a queen, how could there have been 10 years of ground war in Africa, fighting off the surviving aliens?

Strategically outmatched and outgunned at every turn, the human race is toast. All the queen had to do was sit her Aliens-ripoff butt in her chair and keep the shields up outside and she would have been unstoppable. Superior intelligence? Go fish

In the interests of brevity, absolutely no regard for science of any kind was taken in the making of this movie

They should have focused on the African tribes and their ground war as the backstory, and had the aliens sending a more experienced invasion force with a vengeance as the round two. The African warlords who knew how to fight them would be called on to lead the battle for earth and train a new kind of army with their alien arsenals, knowledge of the alien language, and link to the aliens' collective intelligence.",1483401600,2,2740,4.590163934426229

7782759,1,B01HC3880G,"Okay, let's try this again as Amazon bounced my first review.

I really wanted to watch and like this movie.  I loved the first one, and having read about the premise of this one, I was looking forward to it.

And yes, I read the reviews that panned it, but I generally don't bother with that.

So let me start with the good.  It is a really good sequel story idea.  The general plot idea is excellent.  The actors (both the returning ones and the ones for the new characters) do a fine job (especially Bill Pullman doing his ""speech"" this time, much more subtle, but still very moving, and Jeff Goldblum and Brent Spiner are always great).  And the backstory for the characters was really great as well.

Now the bad.  Which is the execution of all those ideas.  Bad.  I mean very bad.  The end result of those great ideas, and good individual performances, is a movie that is so disjointed that it makes a group of drunken monkeys flinging poop at each other look organized by comparison.

Pity Hollywood doesn't get that it takes more than some likable characters and a bunch of CGI to tell a good story.  And more's the pity they did it with this story.

OK, rant over.  And yes, your local mileage may vary.",1483315200,,1212,4.387387387387387

I appreciated the tie-in to the original movie as I had specifically watched the original Independence Day two days before the new one was supposed to come in. I enjoyed the new characters and felt a connection to the older ones who were carry overs from the first movie.

I see the door has been left open for a sequel which may be interstellar in scope and that's all right too. In summary the movie is entertaining and well paced and left me looking for more.",1482883200,,606,4.269565217391304

7782869,3,B01HC3880G,"Well most of us know how sequels go. Sometimes we're surprised like most of the Alien series of movies I liked the sequels just fine, except for number 3. It helps to have the same stars in the sequels instead of expecting us to associate a new face with one we've already come to identify in the show. We were lacking Will Smith's smiling face in this one, with pictures of him haunting the shadows in pictures in  government and military buildings in this one. Most of the original cast was still in this one, I guess Mr. Smith didn't want to lower himself to a repeat performance with a different title? No matter, Jeff Goldblum pulled off his character just fine as did the rest of the returning crew. Okay so this part of the movie is pretty good in my book. Good enough I wasn't gonna go all waaa haaa over a few missing faces.

My main complaint with this entire film is that it's difficult to follow. The producers throw tons of special effects at us right from the get go, the show doesn't drag it's heels and for that reason most of us that are more used to a leisurely segue into the the action sequences may be a bit taken by surprise at how this thing blasts off. There a sequence with some lunar based technology that's being installed and almost winds up falling over even in such light lunar gravity still has us holding our breaths.

I was wondering what I had just seen when the show was over. I was pretty confused by all the different scenarios all erupting one after the other without too much explanation or introductions as to what we were seeing or were starting to see? Lucky for me that I bought this movie on Amazon streaming as I went back in a few days later and re-watched it. My girlfriend also made me feel better about myself because like me she too was a bit confused as to the what she saw as well. The second time around I paid much more attention to the barely noticeable hints or clues as to the coming events, and was able to navigate the scenes much better. I don't feel the audience should have to study a movie to understand what's happening. If it's directed correctly you should get all or most of what's going on without having to go to ""movie studyhall"" to get extra credit for something someone else didn't explain worth a hoot.
  All the special effects are good, all the aliens are still just as creepy if not more so in this version, there is some funny dialog too, and there's lots of ""Oh wow!"" scenes .
  I'd recommend watching this movie especially if you saw the first one? Would I recommend buying it? Only if you didn't pay attention when you watched it the first time.",1482796800,,2625,4.344897959183673

I was disappointed to not see Will Smith involved but with the others in it was enticement enough to give it a shot. The visual effects were stellar, of course, but I thought the plot seemed a bit contrived and predictable. I really also expected the President's daughter to have more of a central role in this one, and not under-utilized as a supporting character. There are didn't exist the same amount of humor in this one, so in general the writing just wasn't up to the caliber of the cast talents.

The script tells me that EACH of the former stars returning from the original must have needed the money they were paid. I hope they got a boatload because between the terrible script what was perhaps worst was the fact that this movie MUST have been filmed entirely on a set in from of a green screen. NOTHING appeared realistic and it must have cost TOO much to put these folks on a better set with decent CGI and special effects.

This is complete garbage and it was easily seen with in the first 10 minutes of film. Nothing but stupidity and forced relationship and family crap shoved in your face. The characters have zero depth nor remember what happened in the original film. You don't like these people and you don't want to. Why Brent Spiner was in this is beyond me. Especially since he died in the first. Plus he comes out of a 20 year coma on the exact day the aliens return?  No, I don't think so. I didn't buy it and neither should you.  This movie could not be any better if you were stoned. It was a big budget straight to video. I see that Emmerich and Devlin are planning to remake the Stargate franchise. If it's anything like this, then I'd ask they please don't. Don't ruin my happy memories of the original film or my beloved t.v. show. The time for these sequels was 20 years ago.

Instead, Brent Spiner (AKA Commander Data) as Dr. Brakish Okun did a brilliant job of keeping me smiling. And at the end of the movie, his comic rantings made me realize there will be another sequel.

7783171,1,B01HC3880G,"I truly think this is the most disappointing film I ever viewed. Well, viewed about half that is.  I just couldn't watch any more.

The characters were its first flaw.  Teenagers in semi-adult bodies -- and not the type of teen that make an older person yearn for the vitality of youth,  More the type one occasionally hears in the food court at the mall. Vapid. Mindless. Genital brained.

Then there was the world they inhabit.  Supposedly now one world. But with a stereotypical exception.

Watching as much of it as I could stomach it seemed that the writers were in direct and constant communication with the marketers.

And then there was that script itself.  Largely a series of ""cute"" one-liners that reminded me of a poor stand up comedian's supposedly tested laugh lines. And the uncomfortably silent room that follows.

In a sense all of these formula pieces were in the original Independence Day too. But there they hidden by a good plot and performances that, if not of Academy Award level, at least created real characters that a viewer could relate to and come to care about.

""Nice try""  -I wish I could say that.  But nope. This film is a total loser. And with the feeling of something written and produced by a committee.",1481414400,2,1239,4.654377880184332

I have bought 5 remakes (?)  this year seems they all were written by people who forgot to go to school  or suffer from the same affliction/ head trauma  I do.  Actually no they do not since I am still very smart just gets scrambled . This movie shows No signs of any intelligence in the script from the writers. I have to say they 2 stars i give was out of respect for the actors who showed up to play in the sequel, and that is about it . Will Smith was smart in not coming back to be in the movie . since it tended to be so stupid, it truly makes me wonder if the Hollywood ""click "" are making Remake  movies this year  insult the people of the USA make political statements , try to tell the rest of the country and world just who out of touch they really are with reality.
I have to tell you any one who is over 30 seen the original Independence day . then views this movie,will scratch their head with a the ? are the Writers/actors/ Hollywood establishment  for real trying to pass this movie off as a honest true effort try at a sequel to a great Block buster movie!!!  Instead they give you a movie that is shallow lacks any good script story line the name actors could not even save it as hard as they tried or did they ? instead some passed on Political statements of their own agendas  .
Not only did this movie but every one of the Big major Remake movies this year use them to promote some kind of Political agenda from gay rights to climate change. Take my advice if you do not already have Prime save your money get Prime or a Netflix scrip with the money from the cost of this years Remakes it will get you at least 6 months scripts . Where you will find some great smaller lesser known movies That Hollywood is not promoting for Political reasons and showing just how far they are out of touch with the country and can screw up a great movie  or 5 -6 of the best classic films made  . They only reason I gave this 2 stars was the special effect camera people since they did work hard at what they did here on the other movies .
One movie that has had a different reality went to great lengths to bring the original story into play with the first two films keeping it true as it has always done to every TV series as well threw it all away this year with the third movie with a fictitious ship in the fleet that never existed and a romance that gave a son to him in the original series. the  3rd movie the women just vanished  from the crew  from the second movie to 3rd .

But the movie lacked that campiness that the original had.  It wasn't really as funny as the original was despite how much it tried.  The movie's greatest weakness is it's writing.  I was ok with the alien's return; but, I found it hard to accept the resistance that the sphere spoke of.  I feel like there were several scenes that were missing that could explain why Goldblums character would question destroying the sphere.  Perhaps this was the movie we needed, Earth discovering the resistance.  But, we got a movie that tried to do and explain too much.  The relationships were not developed as well in this iteration as it was in the original.  We were told too much and not really shown it.

This movie is GARBAGE! It looks like it was something done by High School or first year Movie students! You can tell the actors are standing in front of a green screen,the special effects are something you see from a low budget movie,there was even a time they were shooting the ""alien guns"" and you can see the FX crew missed adding the laser trails from the gun because all you saw was a light blinking on the gun. The acting was HORRIBLE! Almost like know emotion behind it,like the actors were reading from a script while shooting. Overall I had high hopes for this movie but was severely let down.

I missed Will Smith's character, maybe he could've brought something more to the table. There were a good number of new characters, maybe too many with too much going on.

7783500,4,B01HC3880G,"am a big fan of the original Independence Day and I saw it four times in the theater and at least 3 times a year ever since. I understand that the sequel was not liked by fans and critics alike. I did enjoy Independence Day Resurgence but my feelings are mixed. I have watched it several times to sort out just how I felt about this movie. First of all, I JUST love alien invasion movies and that on its own will already earn some praise from me.

One point I want to make is that if a person goes into this movie expecting it to be similar or just like the original ID4 then they are bound to be disappointed. If, however, you approach this with an open mind and accept the movie for what it isa lighthearted science-fiction action and adventure movieI think there are things in this film to enjoy.

I will review the movie by revealing my pros & cons. Remember, not all pros and cons are of equal value. I will start with the cons first.

1). Too many characters. Its not that I wasn't able to keep track of them, its just that there were too many to keep track of and that bogged down the story.

2). Not enough tension. I think with the concentration and focus on the many relationships the movie lost a sense of dread and immanent danger annihilation the first movie had. I never had that sense of tension that our characters were in real trouble.

3) Poor pacing. The original was well paced and I think the poor pacing of this movie is due to trying to cram the stories of all the characters within this movie.

Now for the pros.

1). I liked the focus on the original characters and it was good to see them back! I specifically liked the performances of Jeff Goldblum, Judd Hirsch and Brent Spiner as Dr. Okun. Spiners character had much more screen time and did provide comic relief and was just a hoot. For those who think his character died watch the original once again. As the alien is using him to speak through, Okuns fingers are against the glass and are moving showing he is alive. Plus, when we first see Dr. Okun in IDR he is shown moving his fingers before he awakes. That is a nice subtle touch!

2). Great Special Effects. I am unapologetic about my love of eye candy known as special effects. This movie was a delight on the eyes and senses and for me that was very entertaining.

3). The Alien Queen. I am also a lover of Kaiju movies (giant monsters) and the Alien Queen was just great as a giant monsterLoved it!

4). More Science-Fiction. i loved how they showed how much the earth has changed due to the incorporation of alien technology on the human race. Although this could also fit under the special effects reasons why I enjoyed the movie, I single this out because it was done so well and it is what made the movie different from the original (in a good way).

5). Action and adventure. This had a lot of action, more aliens, great battles and ton of destruction porn!

6). Decent story. Despite the character overload the story is pretty good. I did care about the characters, I hated to see Jasmine Hillers character die, and it was interesting and entertaining how they all got together to save the Earth once more.

Sure, I don't exactly enjoy it as I did the original but this movie does have a lot going for me. I am very certain this alien invasion movie will have repeated viewings in my house.",1480377600,5,3336,4.326923076923077

It is very hard to get our entire family together to see a movie, but tonight we were all home. So we decided to see Indepence Day: Resurgence on Amazon. I even paid an extra buck for HD, which I rarely do.
Independence Day: Resurgence is an American teen drama ........ sorry that is from the description of Beverly Hills 90210 but it fits parts of this movie. There is a group of 20 somethings and a group in their 60's and 70's that survived the first movie. (but about a third of them don't make it thru this one). Really the only interaction between the two groups of 90210 wannabees and the first movie survivors is between the former President Whitmore and his daughter.
I did enjoy Dikembe Umbutu. His country had fought a long ground war against the only alien ship to land safely back in 1996. And Brent Spiner (Data) came out of a coma.
But my recommendation is to watch the first one again. Maybe someday they will re-edit Independence Day: Resurgence into a comedy.",1480032000,,1152,4.438679245283019

7783569,3,B01HC3880G,"As ""flaming zoomies"" go it  is not a bad film - NOT as good as the original but watchable. It felt as if they worked too hard  trying to get all the characters into it from the first film in the series.  It was fun to see how they aged in 20 years but beyond that --meeh --  Goldblum is a good actor  but without Will Smith to play off of  he was out of place and much of his lighter moments fell flat.

Somehow I think the studio had a meeting where the decision was:

lets get as many of the original actors as we can
add a countdown to destruction
throw  bunch of special effects at the audience

and

cash our checks.

I give it three stars solely because I like ""flaming zoomies""",1479859200,,684,3.9851851851851854

Homosexual action scene and main character placed to empower their community.

This is no exception - it was really good to see Jeff Goldblum and Judd Hirsch again, but the film overall feels like something entirely different than the original. If you separate it as much it's not so bad; if you're expecting an epic follow up to the movie my family makes sure to watch every July 4th, then you'll find yourself disappointed. My main complaint would be that they turned Bill Pullman's character into a blathering idiot and opted to replace Mae Whitman as his daughter with a less believable and all around basic actress.

If you have seen the first one, then you see the many limitations on this one. How about: let's hit all the highlights and plot devices of the first one, only with characters we don't really care about. Let's make it a hodge-podge of scientific inaccuracies also and plot holes so large you could drive an alien spaceship through them. To start at the beginning, we see sophisticated joint alien-current technology flying machines and advanced weaponry. Now let's go to the desert in 2015 vehicles with no improvements whatsoever? Huh? No fusion mini-reactors for cars? Oh and there's an intact alien ship from the first war that Area 51 has not investigated. Please, world scientists would have been all over that bad boy - instead it sits abandoned in a 3rd world African country ruled over by an African tribal chief. Haha Totally unrealistic and unbelievable. Who writes this crap anyway, teenagers? This movie gets the Bozo award for scientific stupidity.

What was even more awesome is that most of the original cast was returning!  So we got to see Judd Hirsch, Vivica Fox, Bill Pullman, Jeff Goldblum, and Brent Spiner again in their same roles.  That was awesome!  And Brent Spiner?  You wouldn't think a day had passed the way he easily slid back into the roll of Dr. Okun!

I am also glad they stuck with continuity where the actual aliens themselves were inside bio-mechanical suits and when they opened, you could see what the real aliens looked like.  It was also good to see that we had used the alien technology to improve our own defenses and upgrade our military.  The only things I think they should have addressed in this movie that they didn't was, what happened to David's wife, and what happened to the children of Russell Case from the first movie?

time the World had come together as one to rebuild and indeed prepared for a possible return.
When an unidentified ship appears near the Earths -Moon-defence-base alarm bells ring among the authorities, though it's
not like the alien-ships that attacked in years past it is attacked and shot down.
The ship as it happens had come to warn of an imminent attack from those that had come before.....of course it does, only this
time the mother-ship is much,much bigger 3000 miles in diameter.
The Earths defenses though hugely updated are no match for the Alien-Invaders who quickly set about causing death and destruction,
though their purpose is to extract the Earth's-Coreas a power-source for their ships, if they succeed it will truly be 'end-of-days' for
mankind.
Only the skills of young-gun figher pilots 'Jake Morrison' ( Liam Hemsworth) - 'Dylan Hiller' (Jessie T. Usher) son of one of the heroes
of twenty-years past 'Steven Hiller' (who was played by Will Smith) with the guidence of those that had played a part in the Alien-
Attack's downfall twenty years ago Scientist 'David Levinson' (Jeff Goldblum) - Former-President 'Thomas J Whitmore' (Bill Pullman)
who's daughter 'Patricia' (Maika Monroe) is 'Jake's' finacee...along with the eccentric and excitable 'Dr Brakish Okun' (Brent Spiner)
who for the past 20 years has been in a coma assisted by the sphere of virtual-intellegence which was removed from the ship shot
down on the moon earlier, indeed stand between survival or extinction.
I have eagerly awaited seeing this follow-up to the ground-breaking spectacle of 1996 however, sadly was disappointed some, it lacked
the excitement and action we remember from the first offering.
This i found somewhat predictable with many of the characters failing to match the performances  of the 1996 film.
Of course the C.G.I in this version was outstanding...stunning at times which is in my view what makes the film worth viewing.

The studio kept it from being viewed by critics before the opening day and it is apparent why. It's a mess. The film and Emmerich were both nominated for Razzie awards.

The basic plot is that aliens have returned 20 years later but Earth has been preparing. There are too many characters, few of them believable. The plot was incoherent. The acting was wooden, Charlotte Gainsbourg needs to find another career. I did not care about any of the characters, especially the new generation.

The story is set 20 some years after the first one and Earth is like one big country all working with each other and using the old alien technology. Mama big alien still is pissed at earth and is coming back to kick it's ass for what it did 20+ years ago.

The story is predictable, some of the actors that are generally good are horrid here. Goldblum's acting is far better on the apartment.com commercials and Pullman's overacting is embarrassing. Vivica A. Fox is seen briefly before she's killed off (she was a doctor now. I guess she saved her stripper money from the first movie?

7783760,4,B01HC3880G,Not as good as the first one. The movie is somewhat distracted with the introduction of a different alien that some how wants to help us but do not have the power to do so.

7783776,2,B01HC3880G,"I am not sure why you would make a sequel to a movie 20 years after the first other than for a money grab, which seems to be the case here.  Unfortunately it seems to be the trend to make big budget movies, especially in the case of sequels, with some special effects and lots of actions and forget about making a story that gives you anything of substance to hang onto.

Other than the obvious omission of Will Smith, I could barely remember the other characters and the roles that they played in the original.  To me, this one of major issues with the movie as it spent a long time early on trying to reintroduce the premise of the first movie and reacquaint you with the old characters and introduce the new.  I found that part to be slow moving and frankly, boring.  With the exception of a couple of the returning characters, most of the acting is flat and not good and there is very little character development with the new characters.  There was nothing to make me care or like the main players.

The story is essentially a repackaged version of the first with new effects and CGI.  Maybe Smith was wise to bow of this much too late sequel. This movie was trying really hard to be an 80s or 90s action sci-fi movie with its corny acting and basic story and it succeeds in doing that.  If you like mindless popcorn movie action, then this might work, but to me, this is a case of a sequel that should have never been made.

7783883,1,B01HC3880G,"Okay, I was really looking forward to this one because of the catchy trailer and the fact that I totally loved the first movie.

I had quickly come to learn that this movie was a complete and utter disappointment. There was some action but I didn't get any thrill from them.

I don't know if I was biased about the fact that they killed off Will Smith or the fact that this movie was just downright boring...

Okay, there is a Queen Alien and she is bloody pissed off - why did she wait 20 years for her revenge? Also, that old scientist, (the one the alien spoke through in the first movie), he is bloody mental but I loved it!

Then there's Bill Pullman and he was in desperate need of a bloody shave - he looked very much like Robin Williams -_-

As for Liam Hemsworth - I felt as if he could have been better at his role - he behaved like he was stupefied and it really annoyed me...

If you want to make a second movie 20 years later, then try and make something waaaaaay better than the first one - this one proves that original is always best!!!

This movie I rented on Amazon for 48 Hours expecting nothing and actually found myself completely caught up in the excitement of the story. Maybe helped by low expectations I grant you but I thought this was pretty good. There are a couple of stupid character developments for example the ex President going from ""we have no chance"" attitude to ""we can beat them with spirit"" ten seconds later with no discernible reason for his sudden optimism. Also everyone seems to be rushing to sacrifice themselves every 2 minutes in a ""let me die"" and then ""no let me die instead"" way. Also the way everyone has to pair up with another character suddenly and find love is ridiculous.

7783939,4,B01HC3880G,"This is the sucessor to Independence Day and you can consider this review equally applicable to both films in the franchise  ( ok,ok, a 2 product franchise , probably should be called a 'budding' franchise) well, anyway, both used decent actors, skilled cinematographers,  editors, as well as production crews. That said, the lack of a decent screenplay usually results in a product that resembles a 2 hour slow motion self-imolation. Normally ,in order to deliver an exceptional blockbuster requires that the final draft of the screenplay is a stellar product. In all due fairness, even the best screenwriters can lay an egg. Its art afterall. Pretty sure they cannot summon superior writing at will. As i said ,even top tier writers can lay an occasional egg, only to be salvaged by a script doctor. They are the film industries equivalent to the real brains behind many corporate  CEO,'s who , for whatever reasons, operate out of the limelight. Similar to those who give meaning to the proverbial  ""who is the man behind the curtain"" ... But occasionally the entire writing process implodes. Even script doctoring under strict budgetary & time constraints , suddenly becomes akin to 'polishing a literary turd' on the fly.  So that is the feel i get from this flick. With not much conversation of merit amougnst the characters onscreen,,  they insert some over-used clichs,  again...and again.... interspersed with a backstory , romance, and predictable puns. Of course, all is not lost when suceeding Independence Day..... afterall , who needs a script when you have TWO alien races, cool ships making and causing crashes and explosions... and the Father of every Mother-Ship in cinematic history: an alien ship parasiticly attached to our planet and its 3000 miles in diameter. Given alien 'one upmanship'  i don't consider this a spoiler....or even a suprise. I will keep you in suspense as to the victor in the ongoing Man vs Alien battle for supremacy. I suspect my review sounds negative, , and while the aforementioned  flaws normally would delegate a movie as unwatchable-- but i found it charming in some quirky indescribable way...this is not the typical disposition you would expect from a self-professed science fiction junkie. and yet it is so. . Get it, don't take it too seriously and i think most people will find some charm in it as well... i am sporting an ear-to-ear grin as i conclude this review.",1478822400,,2421,4.9727722772277225

The storyline in the movie was smooth going and it kept my attention.  The character development wasn't that deep but I think in a movie like this, the choice to just tell you who is who was a good idea.  The movie is fast moving, there's a lot going on and it flows through each piece of the event very well.

The choice of actors for this movie was really good.

7784059,2,B01HC3880G,"Like the newest Star Wars... by bringing back old characters they destroyed the movies. This is a function of Hollywoods poisonous core themes and players... .
The screenplay is simply dull and in the face of newer concepts of the psychic meaning of aliens and so forth... this seemed dated and not intellectually interesting. The first... was light but had some interesting ideas.
This is suppose to be an Earth that has to a major degree re-engineered alien technology but somehow has not gone aboard the huge crashed ships or at least they if I recall... give a lame excuse for that.
What would have been very interesting was to get rid of all of the comic stuff at least mostly and all of the Neocon lets carry the Israeli flag... deep programing and blood lust and get on to really what would happen if... the Earth were traumatized by an invasion like this.

That is, how, the technology was re-engineered, what the assumptions are about the other race and so forth. But in the movie they are paying for EFFECTS... so lets get to them!

Science fiction is really about the possible given technology's potentially fast revolutionary changes in human perspective and what... might an alien intelligence be like.
The upcoming Arrival at this writing appears to try to deal with that but... it looks like the wrong casting for the hero.

Money and propaganda goals drive ""Hollywood"" really a narrow atavistic core group of 2000 year backward thinkers who think themselves the most modern of humans, they are the most primitive.
Wouldn't it be a novelty to hear asked on the screen the questions that are really on humanity's group mind like: is light speed really a cosmic jail, is everything printed and broadcast nothing more the emotional and mental control, why are there no courageous voices stating the facts about history that are obviously a lie? That is, why the heck... can't we as a species get on with it to the stars and drop the atavistic domination narratives and really think without bounds?

This movies is very narrow and a huge disappointment compared to the first which was, yes...  full of jingoistic prep for the wars already scheduled... ... but was fun and posed some good questions with some very good characters although, the Jewish theme was over the top in Independence Day.

How about a SiFI movie that proffers brotherhood and looks back on the NWO and Zionism and racial obsession and political parties... as silly? We got that with Interstellar, we need more.",1478476800,,2493,4.799533799533799

It is supposed to be a sequel to the 1996 film of the same name, 20 years later, but the technology shown in this film is at least 200-300 years in advance of what we have in 2016. Apparently the insatiable greed for money in Hollywood knows no bounds when it comes to stupidity and absurdity. This movie could have been set in the year 2216 and the technology shown in the movie would be believable, but my suspicion is that the greedy in Hollywood are already planning another sequel and pushing the time period too far in advance might affect their box office receipts. It's a shame because the original Independence Day was an excellent movie.

7784189,3,B01HC3880G,"We saw this yesterday, November 4th, 2016 (rented it on Blu-ray) and I was so disappointed in the acting by the 'younger' stars in this movie.  While I LOVED the 1st Independence Day, this sequel doesn't even come close in action or any other way.  Sometimes TOO many visual effects will ruin a movie and I am afraid that this is clearly what happened here.  I won't be buying the movie until it comes down to $5 for the BD.

ACTING:  if a movie cannot DRAW you into it and make you forget 'time', then it has failed its audience.  The acting in this movie was absurd, as if they only rehearsed 2 days.  AND, there was so much silliness in it that was supposed to be comedy, that IT FAILED miserably.

I was so disappointed.  BUT, IF YOU REALLY LIKE VISUAL OUTERSPACE EFFECTS, ETC. THEN YOU WON'T BE DISAPPOINTED, although it did leave me puzzled at times as to where the fighter jets actually were in a particular scene.  I had to rewind to see scenes again to determine this, but only twice.

WRONG PEOPLE FOR THE ROLES OF THE YOUNGER STARS, but the older and more seasoned actors/actresses were 'okay'.  But, I got the feeling that these seasoned stars were not fully engaged in their roles.

The movie was lucky I gave it 3 stars and that was only because of the majority of visual affects.",1478304000,,1294,4.38655462184874

The first sign that this move should not have been made was the fact that Will Smith was not cast in it but all the others were (they even replaced the president's daughter with a different actress from the first one). Although consistent with the first film in its nonsensical reality of how we humans could defeat a far more technologically advanced alien species with our own technology and sure grit, this was a waste and I'm glad I rented it for $4 rather than paid $10 or more to see it in theatres. Jeff Goldblum was the only redeeming piece of this and even that wasn't enough to pull it off.

Who wasn't rooting for Brent Spiner's (""Data"" : aka Dr. Okun) ), President Whitmore, and their ""decedents""

Jeff Goldblum is so talented and I hope he got a big paycheck, but there was nothing fresh from him in this. This movie should have been enjoyable for the special effects alone.

*****SPOILER*****

Some good action, but someone please, PLEASE tell Hollywood writers to do better writing than ""If we kill the queen bad guy than all the other bad guys stop fighting and die"" because honestly... that is lazy writing.  Stupendously lousy stupid writing.  Like, if I were to close up a bunch of first graders to write a sci-fi adventure and floated that idea out to them, they would tell me how stupid that sounded and that no one outside of kindergarten would come up with such a dumb concept.  I'm not even kidding a little, here.  I want the US Government to ensure that we put more money into colleges so that we finally get decent writing of alien invasions.  These lousy writers currently in Hollywood must be forced back into internet troll communities where idiot ideas abound and they will not be able to cause any damage outside of 4chan ever again.

The stuff that bent science fact--I can live with it, we're telling a story after all.  I get that.  And I liked the acting, the general direction of the film, but this cheap, knock-off writing hack of making every single alien race under the control of a queen who--if she dies, they all die--come on, man.  I know you Hollywood writers are doing this to cover each other until you can make real money as a call-taker at a PBS fund-raiser, but at least TRY something different.  This trope is the Wilhelm scream of the writers guild.  I'm beginning to think that the guild literally has 4 or 5 story concepts and no one is allowed to deviate from it, and as a result we see this trope over and over and over again.

In short, decent action, some fun seeing the world 20 years later, but lackluster writing brought about something that felt like canned vegetable soup--it lacked flavor, originality, sophistication, and relied on a premise so over-used in Hollywood, I'd be surprised if it isn't old enough to qualify for Medicare yet.

In any case, since I was stuck inside a plane for 2 hours so I thought I'd watch it particularly for the special effects.  After finishing the movie, I can say that my low expectations were met.  Unexpected was the nauseating feeling I got while watching the movie.  Aside from the performance a few of old actors like Jeff Goldblum and Brent Spiner, the acting of most of the actors was pretty bad.  Chinese actress Angelbaby was terrible and her character could (should) have been completely left out.  It's quite obvious the studio included her to lure Chinese audiences to see the movie, a tactic being used quite often now.  She should be definitely nominated for a Razzie award.  The story was pretty much non-existent, but that could be forgiven in my opinion if the movie was still enjoyable.  However the action sequences got to the point of being ridiculous.  You knew that the heroes in the end would survive the CGI maxed out fight sequences, so there was no sense of suspense.  The main battle sequence toward the end was a like a joke and you literally could not see what was happening due to visual sensory overload.  Had I not been stuck in a plane, I would have felt this was a waste of 2 hours of my life.  Will Smith made a wise decision to not be part of this wreck.

Seems like technology involving the ability to extract molten core energy may also involve biological capacity to eradicate an infestation before landing to drill. Would certainly make for less risk. I'm thinking sequels could be interesting in terms of the destruction visuals - but ridiculous in terms of spins. Pure arrogance to think Data will be in charge of the resistance. Humans 2. Aliens 0.

7784409,1,B01HC3880G,"Wow. This movie was terrible. The only way to enjoy it is to imagine that it is a parody end of the world B-flic. Do not under any circumstances believe that this is meant to be an actual movie. No substance, rehash of original plot line, rephrasing or outright copying of original dialog quips but with 2-Dimensional juvenile versions of the original characters, and dare I say it, retarded physics.

Spoiler alert:

A mothership that's quoted as having a diameter of 3000 miles and it just has to land on earth which has a diameter of 7915 miles. Why would it need to land? Why does it need a molten core when there are plenty of empty planets with molten cores? It was pretty ridiculous. Characters were able to take top level aircraft and come and go as they please with no clear chain of command or restrictions. I can sometimes forgive these kinds of things in movies but put them all together and just grab a bunch of characters that are just there as an homage to the originals (or worst a series of dynasty kids) and well it simply sucks.

I wanted to like it, I tried to like it , I love the original, but oh this is just terrible. Save your money and stop praising Hollywood for the production of these kinds of movies so that they stop making them. To the Hollywood producers: Are you even trying anymore or is there a computer algorithm writing a recipe for movies. All the recipe calls for is to add up the top moments of the original, combine it together with cheesy plots and scenes straight out of a soap opera, mash it together, and then bake and hope that what comes out is at least edible and if you're lucky, maybe even palatable.",1477785600,,1651,4.388888888888889

Amazing CG effects for sure, but the story is choppy, not progressing natural enough to rein you into the plot.  It seems to lack the cohesive energy that drives the viewer to be a part of the story, and is kind of predictable with little unexpected action sequences.  Attempting to link the original with this sequel, characters are brought back, with the notable exception of Will Smith, of course, who decided to pass on this I guess, since he's only mentioned in passing as being killed as a test pilot some time ago.  So, Judd Hirsch and Jeff Goldblum, Sela Ward, Brent Spiner, and Bill Pullman simply couldn't ""pull"" it out of the predictable story line.  With such amazing computer-generated imagery, it's a shame that the story and the acting are simply not ""up"" to the challenge of combining with those effects to make this a satisfying sequel.

There was a bit too much sacrifice of some of the original cast being turned into single dimensional caricatures for the sake of comedic relief, which I feel wasn't necessary or desirable. I did enjoy the plot of the alien agenda this time around and the expansion of the ID universe. Like many movies that cross generational lines, I find millennial type characters a bit hard to watch, such as Dylan Heller who just appears to be an empty vessel and can't seem to develop a meaningful reason for me to care about him. Thankfully, the actors you expect to perform do so(Liam Hemsworth, Bill Pullman, Brent Spiner), which saves the movie and adds stars to my rating.

The plot its plagued with a lot of ""convenient moments"" as the USB drive on the mothership from the first movie. But you can enjoy it.

Liam Hemsworth tries to sell you the movie as a reformed rebel who is willing to go beyond the line of duty. On subplot that is very VERY similar to Macross Plus. The President's daughter is not very believable, but well... Jessie T. Usher is a good actor that doesn't get the movie he deserved to shine. Some of the Original cast return, but its like a LOT of characters that get their moments forced upon each other.

It takes place 20 years after the first battle. The aliens have returned with a vengeance and stronger than before. The world must unite of they are to defeat them.

7784596,1,B01HC3880G,I enjoyed the first Independence Day movie as it was much more realistic with technology we have today and in 1996.  This movie was totally unrealistic with what we have in 2016 (20) years later and the writers did a poor job of combining the first movie with the second movie. I was totally lost throughout the entire movie &I still lost while writing this review.  Save your $ this movie is bad.,1477526400,2,397,4.424657534246576

The style, pace and feel were spot on the original.
It felt and looked like they made this sequel 2-3 years after the first- a positive for continuity.

As a sci-fi action flick, it performed well.  The queen and scale of the new mothership were fine upgrades.

The return of Brent Spiner was a surprise to this Trek fan :)

The first one has that feeling of bei g our world, our reality. You know what I mean? I guess that's why it was such a cool movie. As a kid at the time, it left me with that feeling ""holy S*. What if that happens?""
But then in the beginning of the sequel we are introduced to a different world. Sort of a futuristic feel to it. It didn't matter what year it was. Even if it was supposed to be in 2015, it just didn't have that real feel to it. So it was different going in.

Sure it all made sense in the story. And I get it. So passed that first weird impression the movie was pretty interesting. Of course IF you like that kind of movie of course. Nice to see old characters and what came to be of them in that world.

7784705,2,B01HC3880G,"I'm not a fan of this movie.  The action side of things was relatively ok but that's really the extent of it.  Before I say anything more, let me first just say, if you're going to tackle a sequel to a fantastic classic like Independence Day, you better have a damn good script, plot, and actors to take it on otherwise you're gonna flop.  I feel that's exactly what happened, they wrote a script, hired a few actors, brought in some actors from the first movie (the only redeeming quality of this film) and said ""eh it's good enough"".  In my opinion this was a total flop and here's why.
The plot was stupidly shallow, there was nothing to it.  It's like the writers wanted to take the first film and just turn it into a shooter/explosion movie and nothing else.  It wasn't suspenseful, it wasn't interesting, the new characters that were introduced were incredibly lame and once again it was the people from the first movie who came up with the ideas necessary to win the day while the new characters just pulled triggers the entire time.  There weren't even any memorable lines.  I'm so sad they came out with a sequel and this is all they did with it...

I was really looking forward to it even if Will Smith was missing because I really like and enjoy all the other actors and I LOVE the first movie. But a lot more than just Will Smith was missing....Like decent dialogue. This one is missing the wit and heart of the first movie.
 Everything was just so completely disjointed when it came to the subplots and never followed through enough to get you to care about the new characters. And what they did to the returning characters was depressing, not believable and out of character for them.....Example...SMALL SPOILER ALERT...Is it really likely that David (Jeff Goldblum) would have disappeared out of his father's life except to visit every other Thanksgiving after all they had been through together and how much they had grown together? This is just one small thing, there are soooooo many others.
It's as if the subplots were throw together just so some of the actors could reprise their roles with no thought whether it made any sense or not...which it didn't...and it could have made sense because they WERE great characters in the first movie and they had great actors to work with again and they blew it.
The producers and director was so worried about the special effects that they forgot what made the first movie so great. It wasn't all about the aliens and effects, it was the friendship, the love, the humor and courage of the main characters and the unity of the entire world coming together as one to save humanity. All of that is missing in this movie.
I became so completely bored with it that I shut it off halfway through but I decided to give it a second chance and watched the rest of it a few hours later. I should have left it off.

Speaking of which, he suddenly wasn't killed in the first movie? Ummm.....right. The alien killed EVERYONE in the room, used Spiner as his personal, ""hand puppet"" and he lived? Then the alien life that showed up to help the humans turns up just before the second attack? What were they waiting for? They couldn't have showed up ten years sooner?

7784752,3,B01HC3880G,"In Mad Max: Fury Road, Immortan Joe is known for his one liner Mediocre! Well Independence Day: Resurgence is also exactly on that wavelength. As I like to do quick reviews for folks with a lot on their minds and proverbial plate, ID4.2 does a nod to the original with some of the same jokes and lines. The movie also features just about everyone from the original minus Will Smith whose been killed off. ID4.2 tried to be too funny when it really wasn't necessary. It was also way more cheesier than ID4. In short, Dylan (Jesse Usher) is now #1 ace in the Legacy Squadron. He has some beef with Jake (Liam Hemsworth) who is stationed on the Moon doing Tug work (literally flying tug boats to help install weapons of war on the surface of the Moon). Jake's fiance Patti (Maika Monroe - President Whitmore's daughter all grown up) is also a fighter pilot who flew with Dylan at the Academy. Roland Emmerich could have just brought on Mae Whitman in the film to reprise her role as Patti. The movie would have been exactly the same. Throw in some new faces like Jake's buddy and comic relief Charlie (Travis Tope) and his girlfriend to be and nod to China's rising film industry, Rain (Angelababy) playing another Ace for the Legacy Squadron and you have the new generation of ID4.2. President Whitmore (Bill Pullman) and David (Jeff Goldblum) are also back as well as Dr. Okun (Brent Spiner) who wakes from a 20 year coma when the cavalry arrives from the Alien Homeworld through a wormhole. In a race against time and odds, all the actors have to do exactly what they did in the original film (seriously I don't even have to type it up if you remember the first film). Apparently in Hollywood, a land of no new ideas, much to my dismay with Star Wars: Ep 7, ID4.2 also falls into this hole. If it worked the first time for moviegoers, then just regurgitate it, for a new generation of moviegoers. If you loved the original ID4, then you'll certainly like the sequel but it's nowhere as great. Some cool ideas are represented for ID4.3 which should take place primarily in space/exo-planets.

If you are a fan of any or all of these gentlemen, you will enjoy the film for their performances. I don't have much else nice to say about this one. Wouldn't a three thousand miles wide spaceship latched onto Earth like a leech cause some catastrophic axial issues? Coring to within seconds of Earth's molten core with a one mile wide plasma drill would also cause some catastrophic issues, I would imagine. Like the Atlantic draining and/or the molten core leaking. I wasn't a fan of Liam Hemsworth before this and I'm really not one now. His character was a douche, and I'm angry they didn't cast Mae Whitman to reprise her role as Patricia Whitmore. Jessie T. Usher was pretty good as Dylan Hiller. Nobody could replace Will Smith but he did okay. Did we even need Hemsworth? Couldn't Patricia and Dylan have been the couple? It makes sense after what they lived through together while their parents battled the aliens twenty years ago. And where the heck did Connie go? Connie, who David pinned for throughout the entire first film and got back together with at the end. Suddenly there is this Token Woman for David who isn't Connie. Stripper Jasmine is now an esteemed doctor? The world has set aside its differences after the first attack in 1996, yet we still have a massive arsenal of alien technology weapons. Also, if the world set aside its differences and there has been peace on the planet for twenty years, wouldn't that mean that greed has disappeared too? Even maybe money in general? What's up with the greedy treasure hunters? Sigh. I didn't expect reality from this, obviously-the first film was incredibly hocky- but the first film was still awesome.

Poorly produced/ edited and overstocked with enough tropes for six films, this highlights another example of Hollywood attempting to recreate the sense of awe when enjoying the original or the first film which inspired it's sequel. This film moves at such a fast pace that it prevents the secondary characters from the first film and newly introduce characters very little time for development or memorable moments. I for one can enjoy films for their entertainment value (popcorn flick) and their production (script, casting, effects, music, ect.) value & in my opinion this film lacks either. If you're craving an action film involving earthlings that take on an invading army of highly advanced and/or dominating aliens, stick with ""Battle: Los Angeles"", ""Battleship"", or even ""Starship Troopers"".

The plot itself, and the attempt to create continuity with the first film was very sloppy. For example, we all saw Dr. Okun die in the first film, but now, in a desperate attempt to recycle his character, we are led to believe that he was really only in a coma for the past twenty years. In the first movie, Jasmine was a stripper. Inexplicably, she returns in the sequel as a Pediatrician. Bill Pullman is convulsing and shrieking every five minutes, the aliens have a ship 3,000 miles in length (mm hmm) and an alien pod with a sexy female voice is engaging in banter with Dr. Okun, etc. For me, the basic elements of the plot are very shaky and just don't seem to work.

7784895,2,B01HC3880G,"Lets be honest here. I enjoy big budget Si Fi, with great effects, decent acting and at the least an acceptable script. I can suspend disbelief to enjoy it too. Unfortunately this is not the case here. It seems that the prime driver for the director and producers here is ""bigger has to be better"". That is so wrong here. First, the picture quality and 3D effects are real good. Thats where it ends. I will not bother to reveal plot lines and other unnecessary facts, but this is simply a huge waste of time. The acting was terrible, almost a complete lack of any character development. The preposterous science aside, (a scientifically unrecognizable earth after only 20 years, This time, an alien space ship the size of the entire North American continent), This was worse than even ""Jupiter Ascending"". and a script worse than ""San Andreas"", which you must admit, was pretty bad.
The Emmerich group used to make pretty decent Sci Fi, but each new movie is never up to it's predecessor and they have run out of fresh ideas. At the end of the day, this is 10 lbs of stink in a 5 lb bag.
I now understand the Will Smith story. I heard he wanted 50 million to return to the franchise.

I think it falls in line with the classics of sci-fi action/comedies. Great action sequences, moments of dramatic connection and of course a few classic and corny comedy lines that bring it down to earth.

7784944,3,B01HC3880G,"Mr. Smith is NOT in this second installment of the Independence Day movie franchise. Rumor has it that he demanded a whopping 50 million dollars to reprise his famous role. Apparently Willy forgot just how much his credibility and star power have dropped thanks to his other movie flops like Hitch, Men in Black 3, Hancock, and of course After Earth. Also, he forgot just how much the original Independence Day launched his career. So much for loyalty.
Okay, enough said about him. Independence Day: Resurgence is a direct sequel to the original movie taking place 20 years later. Everyone is back, well almost everyone, for a new fight the aliens adventure.
Is it good? Yes, it is good. Is it great? Better than the first? No. Lots of great moments, amazing special effects, and expected humor.
I didn't give it a higher rating because of some huge story issues. How can someone who was in a coma for 20 years just wake up, hop out of bed, and get back to work? Also, there is a complex sup-plot that is clearly setting up a third movie that just feels forced and contrived. And you can feel the producers pushing a new generation on us. Priming them to take over. Again, this feels forced. And, while the bulk of this movie does focus on the new blood, much of it feels like a family reunion, seeing old friends and relatives again after being away for 20 years.
Would this movie have been different, better if ""you know who"" was in it? Yeah, I'd have to admit.

There is much to like about this movie and there are things that I found to be a bit ""glossed over"" like the attack [?] on the Saturn defensive site.  Nevertheless, much fun, great CGI, the ""characters"" are both compelling [especially the ones from the first movie] and a little wooden [the younger people] in this movie.  Given the situation it is understandable that this is an ""open ended"" movie in that there is a need for a ""sequel.""

Will I watch this again?  You betcha.

If, like some people, you gripe about the lack of ""reality"" in this movie, may I ask why you are watching this movie?  There are no ""hidden"" messages about how the aliens are a ""metaphor"" for ""illegal immigrants"" nor is there a hidden message about anything else.  It is just fun and going a hundred miles an hour.

I wish I had had the chance to watch it in the theaters.  But the negative reviews made it seem to be boring and now I will NEVER read another ""professional"" review of any movie.  They are all frustrated intellectuals who don't have a clue.

The aliens come back because the last group sent out a homing signal or something.  At the same time another alien group show up.  There is much shooting, much destruction, London is in for a very nasty time, and much angst.  But what do you expect after 20 years?  The White House was rebuilt, looks good, but ain't gonna last.

7784989,2,B01HC3880G,"I think ID4 Resurgence had a lot of potential, but in my opinion it fell flat due to rather dimensionless characters.  While it was good to see so much of the returning cast, it would have been nice to be ""reintroduced"" to them after 20 years.  Some more fleshing out of what their lives have been this whole time, especially President Whitmore and David.  What happened to his wife?  The new characters were not really developed at all, so it was hard to connect with them.  They spent a lot of time in the first ID4 developing the characters and their relationships, which gave the film more substance, and it would have been nice to see that with these new ones.  For example, what was the backstory of the kids who picked up Judd Hirsch?  They just seemed to come out of nowhere.  It would have been nice to see more of them and their family life from the beginning, much like the first ID4 did with Randy Quaid's character and his kids.

7785012,3,B01HC3880G,"It's so bad. It's so hilariously, wonderfully bad, and it's exactly what I wanted.

So the people saying it's worse than the original ... yes, that's true. The original takes a lot of heat, because of the dialogue, and the acting, and the things that don't really add up, but in terms of storytelling it was effective, right? July 2 is this great crescendo culminating in the disaster scenes we all came for, while setting up characters we like despite ourselves because they're Jeff Goldblum and Will Smith. July 3 you get planes vs. spaceships, Will Smith being a badass, and they actually develop the characters in ways we care about. Then July 4 sets up a great showdown. It's a well constructed movie despite its flaws.

This is the opposite. There is absolutely no sense of pacing or structure or build. Things just sort of happen, one after another, wherever the plot needs them to. The movie doesn't obey real world logic, or even disaster movie logic, or even its own internal logic, at pretty much any time. In one scene Bill Pullman's in the room chatting with people, the camera cuts away for one shot, and then cuts back to the exact same shot except Bill's missing, and they all say, ""Wait, where did Whitmore go?"" like he snuck out in that 1.5 seconds. Characters have love interests - like literally every character including Dr. Okun (he actually has the best one) has a love interest, except for Dylan -- why doesn't Jessie Usher get a love interest?? -- but of course that never actually motivates any character to do anything. Jeff Goldblum's love interest shows up in the beginning, hangs out at his side the whole movie, and is there at the end. Sizzling romance!

But NO ONE CARES AND NEITHER SHOULD YOU. Because Jeff Goldblum is being Jeff Goldblum, Brent Spiner's enjoying himself immensely, Liam Hemsworth is fun to watch even when he's just watering his money garden, the special effects are of course fantastic, and there's an alien-hunting warlord with multiple machetes. This is the show that the actors put on for the patrons who hang out after curtain goes down, where they just ham it up and have a good time. If you walk in expecting a B movie with a tentpole effects budget, you'll have a good time too.

Of course the other side of the coin is that there are some missed opportunities for real cinematic moments. Humanity's been prepping for 20 years - why not kick off the fight with humanity giving them a shiner? Like Rocky knocking down Apollo Creed, that moment when the enemy realizes, oh, this is actually going to be an even fight. The dynamics have changed and they could have played with that. But instead it just copies the original (alongside other sci-fi movies you love, and I mean shamelessly), so again mankind is caught off guard and steamrolled and sends out space planes with no shields that get destroyed. Oh well. Still fun.",1477094400,31,2881,4.665354330708661

7785020,1,B01HC3880G,I can't believe how bad this movie was.

This movie couldn't make me care about anybody and anything that happened and anything that was said. Save your time! Watch ANYTHING else.,1477008000,,338,4.745762711864407
7785021,1,B01HC3880G,"Look, I wasn't expecting a good movie but I was expecting a competent one with a little fun and at least a creative moment or two. It's embarrassing. There are some spoilers here, but the movie is pretty spoiled from the get go.

The acting was bad, and the script took the Michael Bay approach ensuring most dialogue is people stating what's happening on screen. ""The door is closing!"" (as the door closes). ""We're ready to deploy."" (As the troops are deploying.) The characters were reduced to locker room tropes and narrowly misses reducing itself to fart jokes (narrowly though, because Data does scratch his butt while wearing grossly transparent underwear) and the writing was likely supervised by a middle aged man who only knows how to have a male and female character interact if there's forced and outdated sexual tension.

Anytime anyone flew a plane there was a lot of un-compelling yelling. ""AHHHHHH. WOAHHHH"". First of all, if you're a trained pilot do you yell every-time you make a tight maneuver? No, these were not battle cries. Second. I highly doubt you're having emotional back chatter with your estranged friend while trying to escape enemies and shoot a laster. I mean maybe some pilot somewhere can pull that off, but certainly you can't if you the type of guy who screams every time there's a ""controlled fall"".

Art direction is lazy as can be. It looks like the big bad Queen (ALL) was modeled after an awkward baby giraffe running to escape a Lyon with one dash of HIM from Power Puff Girls. The messiah savior race is literally a white cue ball, and based on how impressed it is by human behavior I am not surprised it's the last of its race. (Small detail, how did the aliens extinct you when you have no biological body? You were advanced enough to transfer your entire civilization to a post-bio matter virtual computer, but not enough to set up a T1 line to transfer the hell out of there? Why did you choose to have physical computer bodied to begin with. I'm pretty sure the invasive alien race can see data. Go in the cloud!)

Plot holes are more like plot craters. So deep, the aliens could have just read the script and created a whole the size of earth instead wasting time with all that drilling. At least 1/3 of the characters had no impact on the plot in even a small way so that already sets up a rock road, but here's one: Killing the queen automatically deactivated the entire core-mining ship because all the aliens automatically die, but it also automatically triggers the ship to leave earth unmanned and go.....somewhere. Yet we know this is a race that mines the core of multiple planets and it was apparently 30 seconds from reaching the core so wouldn't it just complete that, the auto-pilot away with the core for another ship to pick up? Last time all of the ships were left on earth but this one has got auto-retreat pilot. I can't even go into more.

Worst of all there were just tons of technical problems with the sound editing and CGI that shattered and remaining piece of suspension of disbelief. Overall a terrible effort that clearly had a big budget without the right experts to guide the story, script, acting, editing and overall experience. There would literally be moments when it would go from ambient sound to a sound booth mid conversation which is really jarring, and pretty lame.

The only other movie I've seen in 2016 that was THIS bad was the third installment of Divergent where I literally didn't even finish because I just didn't care what happened. Again there, the sound editing was a huge bummer.

I'm embarrassed for everyone who agreed to work on this project. Especially Data and Jeff Goldbloom. Luckily America forgets pop culture gaffs pretty quickly. But, don't you dare make a third movie. I know you tried to kick the door open with the premise in the last two seconds, but if anyone ever tries to green light it be smart like Will Smith and just force them to put an oil panting of you up in the whitehouse.",1477008000,2,3997,4.621126760563381

a huge, epic doo-doo of a film... i tried watching it in its entirety but could only do so via 3 separate sessions ranging from about 20 minutes to 40 minutes and in my final one it annoyed me so much i deliberately turned it off for the final time with still another 20 minutes or so left, rental fee be damned... a piece of garbage such as this doesn't even deserve to be seen to its end...
by then i was cheerfully rooting for the freakin' aliens to annihilate with full malice every single human doofus on that screen, but starting with the unbeliveably talentless director....

the directing along with editing was amateurish, way below a b-level movie... acting was equally atrocious as was the entire script/story...
won't even go into the numerous plot holes and goofs...
a prime candidate for the raspberry of the decade award....

the only cliche they forgot to put in was the 'slow hand clap', otherwise it pretty much covered every worst juvenile film cliche in existence; it also has campy, john williams-esque, over the top, music soundtrack which - for the most part - sounded like it was simultaneously running along to a video track from a completely different movie...

judd hirsch' character is beyond annoying and goldblum's is almost at the similar level.... as in just about every action/adventure flick goldblum played, his character makes a series of random unsubstantiated observations/assumptions which of course constantly prove to be accurate, yet he pulls them out of thin air [i'm trying to be rated 'pg' here so let's stick with thin air] without evidence of any logical process by which he'd arrive at it .... that's very annoying to any potential viewer who hopes for movies' plots - and characters' actions - to be at least marginally realistic wiith regards to how people act/think in real life....

however, the absolutely worst performance belongs to the dude who plays will smith character's [from previous film] son, who's now a fighter jockey just like his old man was in the original film... he's sort of an anti-actor....
i have seen junior high stage play student actors sell their role to viewers with far more conviction....that is NOT  a hyperbole on my part either....

i've already given it far more time than it deserves so i'll just end it here but wanted to warn others from completely wasting 2 hours of their life on this calamity..... cheers....

The first movie was funny, suspenseful, and at times a could be emotional. The first movie had a better script and the actors elevated it because they were charismatic. Will Smith and Randy Quaid were sorely missed.  However, I will say that I liked the mythology this movie sets up for future sequels that sadly Fox probably won't fund. I think future movies could be a lot if fun and the potential also exists for a guerrilla warfare movie in Africa.

AND, you do not want to purchase a dvd...then, at least, wait until the movie comes out in the Redbox and the other ""boxes,"" and invest less than two dollars and decide. This ""remake.;"" The Ghostbusters ""remake;"" The Terminator ""remake;"" And, The Thing ""remake,"" (which is not a remake of John Carpenter's The Thing--it is an ongoing legacy of the original--That is why John Carpenter put his name on his ""remake"" of the original)... All of these reboots and ""remakes"" do exactly what they are supposed to do. They drive the movie forward, with the technology available to them today, and the filmmakers, in turn, make a really good movie that is worth the effort for those watching to allow these NEW MOVIES to stand alone and be judged based upon what is on the screen now, not what was years ago!!! Independence Day: Resurgence is WORTH THE FIVE STARS, and worth your time as a viewer. I highly recommend!",1476748800,4,1590,4.408163265306122

7785159,1,B01HC3880G,"I liked the 1996 Independence Day, at least until September 11th when my copy when right into the trash.  But that's neither here nor there.

This version has many of the same cast, the same premise and the promise of modern special effects but somehow it falls completely flat.

There are many reasons for this, one is the complete contempt the writers had for their audience.  Saving a school bus full of kids is apparently not heroic enough.  So the bus being driving by the hero's estranged father so they can also have a heartfelt reunion!  And there's a cute dog!  Rescuing a patient and doctor from a hospital as the city is bring destroyed isn't enough, she's also the pilot's mother!  What are the odds?!  Saving a fellow pilot is not enough, so she's also the hero's fiance, AND the president's daughter!  Again and again they up the stakes throwing in more connections and more coincidences until it's almost parody (I am your father's brother's ex-roommate!) but it's treated deadly seriously.

Another effect is while millions if not billions of people die, we're apparently not supposed to care unless they're related to a main character.

Then there's new leads, the heroes of Legacy Squadron who are almost all sons and daughters of the main characters.  But while I have strong memories of Jeff Goldblum or Brent Spinner or Bill Pullman in the first film, this group are all blandly good-looking in that  California sort of way and have nothing behind them.  I saw this last night and I can only remember the main characters as Captain Heroguy, Not-Will Smith, Token Chinese Girl and The Other One.  Oh and President's Daughter.  There's just five of them and I'm already forgetting.

The pandering to the international box office is apparent as well.  A Chinese pilot is introduced and given a big build up, but then does nothing.  I think she has 3 lines.  It's obvious she was included to appeal to the Chinese box office (or more importantly the censors) but is treated as a token.

And finally there's the Deus Ex Machina brought in just to set up a sequel which will probably never happen.

The original film combined an epic attack with characters I cared about.  This has an even more epic attack but I didn't care.

First, if you haven't seen the first movie, you will completely miss the significance of much of what you see (I didn't have that problem). Besides what you needed to know from the first movie to appreciate, the rest of the plot(s) was so superficial and the character development was so slight it was as if amateurs wrote and directed it. I have to wonder if the person responsible for writing the human part, the human interactions and dialogs, was either found deep in the jungle and raised by cute rodents, or someone whose contact with others consists mainly of twitter, Facebook and Xbox.

Something other than blasters. What killed it for my son - all of the President's line of succession were located in one place, and thus all killed.  We all know that none of the administration is never in one place at one time altogether.  Will Smith is not in it - turns out he wanted 50M large to do it. So much for the art aspect unless green is Will's favorite color.  I hear they are planning at third.  If so, they can put a lot more time into script development, get a better director and let's not try to repeat some of the same lines and story from the first one.

The other negative reviews from rotten tomatoes and other sites do not portray this movie well.  I gave 4 stars because for the most part the movie is great. I did take a break fro the first day I watched and and began watching the second part a second day because it is very long.

I thought it was innovative to see how the human race would have progressed after gaining the alien technology. The only issue I had was there was to much emphasis on story lines such as David's dad that really had no relevance to the overall plot and kind of was a waste of time. Like just because you have a sequel doesn't mean all of the original characters need to return. Will Smith was missed but him not being in the film didn't hurt it at all.

I watched to first 40 minutes of it and thought that despite the reviews it was ok enough to spend $14.99 to watch the rest at home. Boy, was I wrong! The plot was plausible enough in that 20 years later the aliens return to earth bigger and more powerful than before. The story line starts out by bringing you up to speed as to where each of the characters lives have come to over the past 20 years and introduces you to the new characters as the plot develops. I would say that it starts to get bad when the aliens attack and the battle begins then an hour later you are asking yourself ""when is the going to be over?"". They seem to go through great lengths to replicate scenes from the first movie so much that it becomes somewhat ridiculous. It was almost like the writers quit half way thorough the movie and someone said let's just copy the old movie to finish this one. Will Smith was wise to stay clear of this one.

And most of the entire movie is in shades of black and gray; even if the characters landed amid plants andgook suddenly everything is varying shades of the same blue-green.

That said It wasn't completely boring and I actually had fun watching it, to be honest since its a remake maybe they wanted to make it a little cheesy but maybe people didn't catch onto that idk.  The plot where we have taken their technology and have become more advanced is pretty cool and while it may annoy some people there is really no other place they could of logically gone with the movie after the first one. I had a lot of fun watching it but don't expect anything that makes you think and don't expect much replay value I feel really bad about laughing when one of the characters mom dies but it was so stupid it was hard not to laugh. youll know what part i'm talking about when it happens lol. I don't want to spoil it though so won't go in to details about who and when just keep your eyes out for some cheesy death scenes.  You got to take this movie with a grain of salt to agree with me giving it four stars, I was so close to giving it 3 but decided it deserves a little love. I love Dr. Okun, Jeff goldblum and his dad but other than them the movie really blows talent wise.

7785216,2,B01HC3880G,It's boring.  It lacks all the things that made the first one great.  The people are humorless and boring.  The only thing I did like was the way the ex president showed a spark of the person he was as president when he was talking to some of the young people who would be fighting the aliens.  The young ones stopped and listened.  They looked at him with reverence like they really appreciated who he was and what he had done before.  It was faint compared to his stirring speech in the fist movie but still it caught my attention.  the rest was just boring hog wash.

7785219,2,B01HC3880G,"This sequel is a real disappointment. The best part of this film obviously ended up on the cutting room floor. All character development is reliant on people having seen the original Independence Day movie.  The new characters added to the story line are like cardboard cutouts of the original characters. You see them, but you really never get to know anything about them that would make you care whether they live or die in the movie. This film makes you very aware of how much a good director adds to the overall story telling aspect of a production; since it is totally missing here.

If you want visual effects, there are plenty to keep you happy. Unfortunately, here too things are so clipped together you sometimes confuse the ""good"" guys with the ""bad"" guys. You are just left with the feeling of a series of independent events just being strung together to make a movie.

I don't think it was the intent of the producers to make a farcical movie, but that is what they presented. It was a waste of $15.",1476316800,,1011,4.543956043956044

7785286,2,B01HC3880G,"What happens when a bunch of millennials get ahold of a classic sci-fi popcorn-munching masterpiece? Well, this convoluted, CGI heavy, story-less piece of nonsense. The first was a fun joyride into alien invasion mayhem. This was a trope-heavy, action-less, actor-less, load of crap that only the most masochistic dullard would find any entertainment in. The tension between the protagonists is only the mind-numbingly petty stuff a child would whine about.

This had the potential to be a masterful tale and exploration into the intricacy of alien invasion. Instead in devolves into a heap of one-line, emotionless dialogue, burdened by overacting and self-indulgent verbal vomit. For the record, they are not ""easter eggs"" if you smack the viewer over the head with them. Then they are just forced nostalgia that are neither missed nor wanted.

So why the two stars you might ask? Well, if you turn off the volume, you might, just might, have a watchable film in the same class as a bad Starship troopers sequel (of which there are plenty). I've seen and felt more drama in a foreign weather report. I've felt more weight at a pillow fight. Quite frankly, I do not think I've ever seen so much green screen.

I wanted to love this film. I remember waiting in line to see the original. This is just a disappointment on more levels than I can accept. The best part (and another reason it gets two stars) is because it does not have Will Smith in the film (thought their explanation of him dying in a training accident/flight was LAME beyond beliefor was it).

Admittedly, we get some cool alien scenes this time around (which were lacking in the first film). However, they do not even remotely make up for the fecal-spawn which is this movie. The systematic killing off of everyone from the first film was somewhat fun, but stupidly predictable. BTW, as much as I love Jeff Goldblum, I really think it is time that he stopped playing Ian Malcolm in all his films.

Finally, I simply have no fear of an alien queen who cannot disable or defeat the technology of a Bluebird school-bus. I know those things are state-of-the-art awesome, but I had no idea of their intergalactic defense possibilities. Also, since when did all military transmissions broad over all frequencies to all troops simultaneously? I guess it really helps in those times of spontaneous celebration. It is also a good reminder to all female war-fighters to make sure you strip down to your t-shirt immediately following any armed conflict situationnot sure why, but I guess it advances the plot.

In the endwell, the end is not even explained. They did what? But why? And who made them do that? Interstellar? On whose authority? I just don't understandoh, forget it. If you watch this thing to the end you'll be left with more questions than answers and more than that, you'll just be glad it's over.",1475884800,,2870,4.799595141700405

7785288,5,B01HC3880G,"I am genuinely mystified by the negative reviews. I mean, this was an updated carbon copy of the first: it had a lot of visuals and tons of FX shots. Similar dialog and identical structure. Don't fix anything if it ain't broke! I thought the ante was nicely upped in all areas.

Being a sci-fi junkie, maybe that's why I was able to enjoy it. I took the most delight in seeing the alternate reality of 2016 and the advancements they took after the invasion of '96 - which were few (their precautions didn't crystalize beyond a short scene of an interstellar defence system).

I will admit that the lack of Will Smith was a big blow to the credibility of the film. No allusions to him beyond some photos and name-dropping. They managed to bring everyone else back, so I guess it must've been some trite, contract negotiation thing. As far as R.O.I. for the film, it would've been HUGE to include him!

Again, we see an unnecessary sequel that stands as more of a cash-grab. The '96 version was ground-breaking in its visuals and offered us all a scene we will always remember. See? I didn't have to say anything for anyone to know which scene I speak of.

Maybe it's hard for me to look at this in a positive light due to being a kid when the original was released, but this movie is a fine use of two hours on its own, and also sets the stage for the advancement of a story a lot of us liked. Hopefully Emmerich does a better job with the proposed Stargate reboot. ID4:R had the potential to be great, instead it is just a fun flick.",1475798400,9,633,4.154471544715447

I had to stop the movie and do a search for the second in the series, thinking that I obviously missed one.  I must agree, the CGI is tops and the premise of the size of the mother ship and how they destroy and pillage to create such a thing is inspired; the movie is a worthwhile see for that. Now, Sela Ward as the President is baffling; then again no acting on her part is required; the role calls for nothing and she gives nothing and no great loss.",1475798400,11,524,3.9904761904761905

Yeah, a queen!  Because why actually be creative or have any actual threats?  And, okay, I guess she's got to be stupidly huge, because, apparently if writers have no imagination whatsoever, they just make something bigger and actors younger.  Or they really wanted Indominus rex to star, as though that wasn't already stupid in Jurassic World.  And how do we kill her?  Um, just keep hitting her and hitting her and eventually she'll go down.

Completely boring.  Completely awful.  There are no threats.  There's nothing to care about.  Nothing at all.

In ""Resurgence"", however, we're not provided with much we can identify with except on superficial levels. That appears to have made a major difference in the over-all quality of the movie in general.

The producers went into this project knowing it was a sequel that would naturally be compared to the first film, and they should have realized what made the first film work so well.

7785478,3,B01HC3880G,"I went into this movie totally blind. Reading reviews before seeing a movie tends to spoil things a bit for me, because no matter how hard reviewers try (and many of them do a fantastic job) some spoilers always leak through. Going into a movie blind means that I can thoroughly enjoy every surprise. For example, I was pumped to see Spiner return; I had thought he was a goner in the first movie. I loved the original and I could not wait to see the sequel. But I was sadly disappointed.

CGI was top notch. I love special effects and this movie delivers in a big way. So that was fun. But my problem lies - as it seems to with so many others - with the characters and their development.

First, there were just too many characters thrown at me to be able to care about any of them. I spent half the movie saying ""Wait, who's that?"" ""What's their connection?"" Who was the President and was she related to Pullman's daughter? Who was the nerdy guy, and why do we care? Who is the kid who hero worships Helmsworth? Are THEY related? Then I just gave up. I grabbed gratefully onto old timers like Goldblum and spent my care factor on them.

Secondly, the Hillers. We came to love Will Smith and Vivica Fox in the first movie, and so much more could have been done to give a nod to that. Instead, we're treated with laughable idea that Smith's character died in a training exercise (given his skill level in the first movie, somewhat hard to swallow) and just as we're cheering for Fox's ability to rebuild her life, she gets dropped into a fiery, crushing death. The Dylan Hiller character could have been given so much more fleshing out just by delving a tiny bit into his background.

Third; suspension of disbelief. Now I get it's a movie and I don't mind suspending belief a little bit, but when it goes so far outside the realm of probability it's just jarring:
 ""Suddenly"" the bus with Goldblum's father conveniently aboard shows up with a handful of children. Why? Who knows? Maybe it's the secret route to Area 51.

""Amazingly"" this one boat survives to closely monitor the aliens' drilling process and is left entirely unmolested.

Don't even get me started on the giant orb that apparently holds the secrets to the universe as well as the technological know-how to defeat these aliens but yet sits there like a lump when it's picked up by the queen. Maybe it needed to be charged? Devices these days, always running out of battery right when you need them.

Some other scenes just didn't make sense to me either. Who was the doctor that Spiner was so close to? Where did he come from? WHO ARE ALL THESE PEOPLE?!

The potential was there for a really great movie. They needed to trim back the cast so that backstories and characters could be fleshed out, enabling us to care more about them. I think most of the actors/actresses in this movie are great - they just never had a chance to BE great because they had to share their time with so many others. Kind of a bummer. One of the reasons I love the first movie so much is that I felt that we were given time to connect with all the characters involved. This one? It ended and I still don't know who the heck is who. To be fair, I'll watch it again and possibly catch some nuances that I missed. I sure hope so.",1475020800,3,3270,4.373970345963756
7785479,3,B01HC3880G,"The original film brought audiences from all movie preferences together to enjoy a film ment for all not just sci fi fans.

Many complain about will smith not returning but let's face it. Propelling the son from the first movie to fill his fathers shoes would still have made an excellent story had they actually writen one.

Honestly just in the quick referenced dialog and glossed over subtext of what's been going on the last 20 years could have easily turned this movie into several sequels pleasing the fans far more then some rushed job attempting to propel humans to the for front of some intergalactic war in which were left to just accept.

Honestly the fans looked forward to a sequel to the original film and have waited patiently for far to long to just be given basically the middle finger and left with a film solly standing on graphics and action sequences.

There are plenty of emotional ups and downs -- even an unexpected finishing twist.

I haven't read the other reviews here, but the errors were so glaring, I'm betting they were all dissected here already.  I'd have advised myself to wait for it to hit Netflix, but I know I wouldn't have listened.  Offer me CGI and I'm spraining a wrist whipping out my wallet.

Best part was they didn't try to jam Randy Quaid into this mess.  Ugh.

2nd viewing:  Ugh.  This time, without the CGI having freshness, I could pay more attention to the writing and the utterly unreal characters.  So bad.  I'm telling my future self -- no way you watch this again. NO WAY.  The CGI is not enough when everything else is such a silliness that only a 7 year old viewer could enjoy it.  Less than comic book plot -- totally arbitrary actions.  And so much time wasted with the tender-feelings and family values.

His son is feeling sorry for himself. Then, the other guy(the movie is so bad, I don't even remember the characters names.) comes looking like he broke his mom's vase. He speaks with no emotion and says something like "" my parents died too. I'm sorry."" He speaks with ABSOLUTELY no emotion.  When they try to add humor to the movie, it doesn't work. For example, when those guys are trying to do who knows what to the aliens, the other guy gets up and says "" You killed my parents! So, I am going to pee!""

7785518,4,B01HC3880G,"As an old friend of mine used to say, ""I hate when people get to the point where they just don't get it.""

I avoided seeing this in a premium theater and instead caught it in a budget theater because I caught wind from all the critics and viewers that apparently it was terrible (which was upsetting because I REALLY wanted it to be good, and was really hyped up and excited until that point). When I finally DID see the film I was expecting it to be awful and hoping for a ""so bad it's good"" kind of experience (I happen to love the Sharknado series and Mystery Science Theater). What I saw kind of shocked me...in a good way.

Okay, first I'll say that I loved the original Independence Day when I saw it in the theater as a teen (because it was stupid and adrenaline-charged like I was and yeah who didn't love Will Smith and the special effects?), but as the years went on I realized what a thin, corny, cheesy, stupid, boring movie it was when you stripped away the over-the-top performances and (at the time) sweet special effects. Just the same though, it had a nifty musical score, some decent actors, and a story that's basically pretty fun so I had high hopes that a sequel could improve upon the elements which were lacking (less stereotypical characters, better editing, less annoying performances, better dialog, less predictable plot). I am happy to report...

More of Same, but Better

I sat in the dark theater watching the beginning of the film unfold and kept asking myself, ""Okay, where does it get bad?"" As the movie went on and on I realized that it wasn't a bad movie at all. And while not perfect, I'll definitely buy it on Blu Ray when it's in the bargain bin. For starters, this is a continuation of the first film complete with lots of dialog referencing the first film in ways that consistently made me smile because it was so wonderfully over-the-top and silly. All my favorite characters were back save Will Smith (which might actually have helped the film because 1. He's been terrible in movies lately and 2. He tends to steal the spotlight in whatever film he's in and this film didn't need that), and every single one of them is the same as in the first film or better in their characterization (only with MUCH better dialog).

Anyone who criticizes Jeff Goldblum in this film ""just doesn't get"" his acting style. He's a wonderfully understated actor who always says his lines in every film like he's a super-mellow guy who is in on a secret joke. He is a little more mellow in this film than the first, and not quite so stressed out, but no one is except for a few over-the-top performances which add enormously to the fun factor. The actor who plays his father shocked me by being lovable and hilarious in every scene he was in. He's warm, friendly, and kind in his role, and just...awesome. He had killer lines in the first film but his performance in better in the second and his character more developed as a person (not in backstory, just in kind things he does).

The returning crazed scientist from the first film played by Brent Spiner is more developed as a character this time around, and he has way more jokes (and they are much funnier). I figured he's just be stupid comic relief like the first film but instead making him even more over-the-top just added to the fun factor of this movie.

Liam Hemsworth is in this film and honestly if his incredibly likable character here doesn't cement him in your mind a swashbuckling hero NOTHING will. I mean seriously, from all the negative heaped on this film I thought his performance would be wooden with bad timing, and instead he's PERFECT in his role. Seriously, I'd want his autograph on a copy of this film or it's poster and he should be proud of what he did in this film.

Hemsworth's sidekick is consistently funny and (yet again) lovable and my wife quickly decided he was her favorite character. He's got all the typical sidekick stereotypes (in love with the first unusual girl he sees, totally awkward) but the actor NAILS it and makes you immediately love him. The token Chinese actors added so this film would have appeal in China don't bother me except that they ARE token (in the same way that there's Chinese milk on the space station). Just like Transformers:Extinction, I enjoy the whole international feel, I just very much wish that these foreign characters were better developed with more personality (heck I don't care if it's all in Chinese with subs). That is one of the few downsides to this film.

The other downside is that the film draws out its climax a bit too long (that's not unique, a lot of modern films like X-Men:Apocalypse and Man of Steel do the same thing). It the final battle had been just a BIT shorter and the Chinese characters had been more than tokens you'd have a five star movie right here.

Okay, you need more reasons?

The special effects are better than the first film (duh), and the alien tech has been assimilated by humanity, giving us a world that feels like the closest we may ever get to a Robotech movie (woohoo!!!!). The air/space battles are WAY better than the first film and a lot more exciting. The movie is FUN. Possibly the most fun film I've been all year. Hemsworth has never been better looking in a film that I can recall. The music is pretty good. There's an African Warlord who fights aliens with swords (yeehaw!!!). The film is bright, and colorful, and ,moves at a good clip.

Yes there are some big plot holes (how the planes weren't destroyed on the mothership and their pilots weren't captured, or how using an alien ship's boost drive cuts the mind control of an alien queen I'll never know), but come on! There's an alien ship that's so big you can see it FROM SPACE WHILE LANDED ON EARTH! This movie is wonderful silly fun.

Oh and Why People Don't Like It

I figured who why people don't like it. You see it's been 20 years since the first film came out, and people have fond memories of it which has distorted their ability to see what a terrible film it is (I suffered from the same for years when that film first came out). They have forgotten WHY they liked the movie in the first place. And the truth is, the film-makers style did not change, viewer preferences did. If you liked the SPIRIT of the first Independence Day, and ""got"" what it was all about, you logically will love this movie if your tastes haven't changed.

It's just like the first film. It's similarly shot, has similar style of acting and dialog, similar style of special effects, similar plot and story, similar types of actors... The difference is that it's a better film. It's sad that it will probably not get a sequel (because boy does the ending leave it open for one, and man would it ever be a fun movie). Fortunately people tend to realize that movies are good in retrospect, and I'm sure the Blu Ray will be nice and cheap so I can watch in on my projector with the sound cranked up for good cheesy sci-fi fun.

7785522,2,B01HC3880G,"Independence Day: Resurgence? Meh, you could do worse, but it's certainly not the summer's best. Considering Hollywood's had 20 years to work on this and the studio clearly hopes to do a sequel on this, you'd think they'd put some real effort into it, but it just ain't so.  Jeff Goldblum is still a lot of fun to watch in this as is Bill Pullam and then of course there's Brent Spiner doing his 21st century Rip van Winkle, having gone into a coma at the end of the last film only to wake up when he's most needed for round 2. But the new characters are pretty flat.  One had real potential as we have an African hero, who's been fighting it out in the bush against stranded aliens, and he's very good with knives. In realty though, we learn next to nothing on what that was all about or how he made it through or learn why the rest of the world didn't just pitch in and hunt them down like so many mad dogs. He might have been really interesting, but the film makers don't spend the time or energy to make him so. If you're going to see it, go 3D, if you can. That certainly helps amplify the special effects. So, 2 1/2 stars, maybe. Don't hold your breath for a sequel though,",1470614400,7,1179,4.166666666666667
7785523,1,B01HC3880G,"This might be the first 1-star review I've ever taken the time to write, but this really was one of the worst movies I've ever sat through. (A tip of the hat to whoever cut the misleading trailers for this movie, because they took a steaming pile of cheese and actually made it look like a bad-ass movie.) I was 11 when the first one came out in '96 and it really was the movie event of the summer (if you were 11, anyway). It was cheesy then and some aspects haven't aged well, but it still holds up as a fun movie. Watching this one felt like watching one of those awful SyFy channel movies if one of them managed to get a theatrical release. The decision to have the military integrate the aliens' technology might have been an interesting idea on paper, but now everything is so cheesy and futuristic (our ships and guns now fire green plasma crap too, we have a full military base on the moon, etc) that it completely takes you out of the movie. At least the first one tried to be grounded in reality, but now everything takes place in some weird alternate universe. Why care that the Earth is under attack again if it hardly resembles real life? Other bizarre choices include the introduction of a rival alien race in the form of a robotic sphere that sounds like the woman on my GPS, an African warlord who kills aliens with swords and then tags along without doing much else, and a gigantic mothership that hovers next to Earth the whole time and then just leaves at the end when the alien queen is killed.

Will Smith not returning wasn't exactly a deal breaker, but the characters that do return hardly resemble themselves anymore (and not because they're 20 years older). One critic pointed out that Jeff Goldblum's portrayal of David in this one actually seems more like Ian Malcolm, his character in Jurassic Park. He seems nonchalant and detached the whole time, whereas in the first one he was always on edge and slightly neurotic. Bill Pullman plays the ex-President, only now he's a bumbling, paranoid lunatic for two-thirds of the movie, and closer to Randy Quaid's character in the first one. Brent Spiner is back, bizarrely, as Dr. Okun, who we find out was just in a coma for the past 20 years, even though in the first one they clearly showed one of the secret service guys check his pulse and then leave his colorless and very dead body. And Vivica A. Fox is in this movie for about two scenes, totaling maybe a minute of screen time. The newer characters are as vanilla and cliched as they come, and you'll spend some of the earlier scenes with them just hoping the scene will end and go back to whatever the original characters are doing. I guess we're supposed to care because two of them are grown versions of the Presidents' daughter and Will Smith's stepson from the first one, but that doesn't work when they're played by different actors.

A waste of two hours, a waste of money, and a waste of the handful of times I spent reading about the on-and-off development of this sequel over the past 10+ years.",1470528000,11,3035,4.4765342960288805
7785524,3,B01HC3880G,"What's the one thing everybody still remembers about Roland Emmerich's Independence Day, now twenty years later? No, it's not Will Smith; it's the White House being blown to smithereens by a giant alien laser beam. The sight has pretty much defined Emmerich's career as a master of disaster, and honestly few can create the kind of havoc he regularly dreams up.  While the White House is mercifully and knowingly spared this time around, Independence Day: Resurgence is every bit as fun, every bit as silly, and every bit as destructive as the original.

Independence Day really helped define what our expectations for a summer blockbuster is supposed to be. It was simple, mindless entertainment; point the heroic humans at the invading aliens and have a ball. 'Resurgence' doesn't change the formula much, if at all. It's sill one gigantic war between us and then, and most of the characters we remember from the last battle are back, only a bit heavier and definitely more grey.

While there's no Will Smith this time as his Captain Heller character died in some freak accident, his son Dylan (Jessie T. Usher) is the new hero pilot in the family. A flurry of new characters are introduced in rapid fire succession; so many that it becomes overwhelming. But many of them have connections to the original crew which makes it worth it once things settle down.  There's heartthrob Liam Hemsworth as Jake Morrison, a skilled but reckless pilot who nearly got Dylan killed. Maika Monroe ( It Follows) plays Patricia, the daughter of former President Whitmore (Bill Pullman) who has lost his marbles since the first alien encounter.  There's also the surprising and unusual presence of Charlotte Gainsbourg as a scientist and love interest for neurotic activist David Levinson, played by a returning Jeff Goldblum who hasn't skipped a beat. This is just the tip of the iceberg, and this doesn't include Sela Ward as the current President of the United States, Brent Spiner who is back as Dr. Brakish Okun, Deobia Oparei as Dikembe a machete-wielding African warlord, plus William Fichtner, Judd Hirsch, Joey King, and other notables either return or debut. There's even Vivica A. Fox, back as ex-stripper Jasmine Dubrow-Hiller, but we only get a glimpse of her new life as a doctor (!?!?) before she's saying farewell to her son, Dylan.

It's all a bit daunting, and as the screenplay by Dean Devlin (and multiple others) skips around like a hot potato we're able to pick up a few things. The upshot of the previous invasion is that humanity set aside its differences and came together as one. There has been global peace ever since, real ""We Are The World"" type stuff, but that hasn't stopped them from using recovered alien technology to craft high-tech weaponry and space ships. But there are signs that the enemy is returning. Those who have had prior contact with the aliens, such as President Whitmore, Dikembe, and Brakish are receiving ""messages"" that the aliens are coming back, and this time they're being led by the powerful queen.

But there is more than just one extraterrestrial race to contend with this time, and when an unknown spacecraft arrives it's us war-like humans who strike the first blow. That sets off a chain of events that leads to much earthly destruction and much alien butt being kicked. Emmerich is at least self-aware enough to have a little fun with the genre and his ""bigger is better"" reputation. One alien spacecraft is so big it practically engulfs the entire planet. The odds are so stacked against humanity that it's a little ridiculous anybody survives, but then that's part of the fun, isn't it? Audiences rallied around the patriotic underdog spirit before and while the flag-waving is kept to a minimum this time it's still all about American exceptionalism. It's no coincidence the other world leaders are seen on tiny video screens while our President seems to be calling the shots for every nation.

Emmerich continues to have a skillful hand juggling numerous subplots at once, although some could have, and probably should have, been dropped altogether. The return of Hirsch as David Levinson's father is especially egregious, and his storyline is little more than a distraction until it miraculously converges with the final battle against the alien queen. With so much going on there isn't much room for any particular star to stand out, but if there had to be an MVP it would be Brent Spiner as Brakish, whose nervous, excitable energy is infectious. He overshadows Goldblum who is surprisingly reserved even though his character is given a serious bump in stature. The rest of the young gun cast performs well, in particular Monroe, but they're best when in the cockpit gunning down enemy ships. The upgrade in human technology helps the aerial dogfights resemble something from out of Star Wars, a progression that feels natural and sets up some interesting things for the future.

Speaking of which, there is clearly the expectation of more movies to come. Emmerich had originally planned this as a two-parter (titled ID Forever) and the door is left wide open for a sequel. Given the way he was able to make Independence Day: Resurgence fresh for old fans and new, let's hope it won't be another 20 years before the next one.",1470182400,8,5279,4.9091928251121075

Doctor Okun surviving was stupid and poorly executed. The shields eventually fall after shooting them, totally undoes the point of the first film when the heroes use technology against theirs to lower them.
The alien queen ripoff can't  chase a bus but can shoot down human/alien hybrid planes with pinpoint accuracy. Why the heck was it even going after the bus?

There was no reason why Miller hated the male ditz played by Liam Helmsworth, who is a terrible actor.

7785528,1,B01HC3880G,"Independence Day: Resurgence? Better yet, ""Regurgence."" Hmm. Thats not even a word, but it fits, because this movie swallowed up elements of Star Wars, Godzilla, Aliens, Predator, Star Trek, and Top Gun, (to name a few) and then regurgitated them back up on the screen, resulting in one heck of a clich&eacute;-ridden movie  one that comes close to ""Battlefield Earth in its awfulness.

The first Independence Day movie was somewhat mindless fun when it came out 20 years ago  a good popcorn movie. Here we are 20 years later. We find out through a comment made in passing that Will Smiths character died as the result of an accident during a test flight. In his place we have his son, Dylan (Jessie Usher), whos more reserved and disciplined and not a carbon copy of his father. That honor goes to Jake Morrison (Liam Helmsworth) the movies lovable beau hunk who attempts to fill the void  left by Smiths character as the smug and reckless (but gosh darn it -- lovable) hotshot pilot whos engaged to the retired presidents daughter.

Synopsis -- Twenty years after the first attack on humanity, earth has been able to beef up its defenses, benefitting from the technology recovered from the left behind from the battle 20 years ago, Yes, the aliens are back seeking revenge and to finish what they started, that being sucking out the earths core for its energy purposes. The Earth must pull together its resources and fight the alien menace. The current president (Sela Ward) mobilizes Earth forces with the help of other world leaders when a mysterious spherical spaceship materializes in Earths orbit. This craft represents a symbol people have been seeing in dreams and graffiti across the globe. Earths leaders decide to fire on the spacecraft, against the objections of Jeff Goldblums character, and it crash lands on the moon. A recovery effort by Jake Morrison  characteristically defying his superiors orders  leads to the recovery of various elements from the crashed craft. Ultimately, this craft is followed by the much larger invasion craft, spearheaded by the alien queen, very similar in appearance to the queen alien in James Camerons Aliens. Panic ensues as the craft takes out Earths communication satellites, plunging us back to the 70s and 80s where things had to be done manually. The alien mothership lands in the ocean to begin drilling for the Earths core and wiping out humanity.

Will out heroes band together to vanquish the alien foe? Will Jake and Dylan let bygones be bygones and patch things up? Will a school bus full of kids outrun a rampaging alien and somehow evade her expert marksmanship? Youll have to watch to find out...but in the end, you'll probably wind up asking yourself why...why did I waste my time on this?

There are some familiar faces from the first movie  Bill Pullman is back as the now-retired-president (exhibiting the same headaches and unkempt beard as Randy Quaid did in the first movie); Jeff Goldblum reprises his role as David Levinson (the all-knowing scientist), and Brent Spiner (Star Treks Data) as Dr. Brakish Okun, whom we find waking from a 20 year coma. Theres also Taxis Judd Hirsch reprising and overplaying his role as Goldblums father. Theyre all back, but just like every other character in the movie, were they were beyond irritating. The plot was by-the-numbers, there were no surprises, and the actingugh. There was no middle road; either it was bland or over-the-top hammy from some normally good actors. Some of them  Hirsch and Spiner kicked their acting into hammy overdrive, to the point where you watch and just shake your head at what you're seeing.

I wasn't expecting Interstellar, but I'd hoped the writers at least assumed I'd finished elementary school.

If you can completely disconnect your brain and just accept that the plot makes little sense then you'll likely enjoy it.

Will Smith is not in this film, so they killed hm off as a test pilot and his son Dylan (Jessie T. Usher) has no sense of humor. Mom (Vivica A. Fox) is back for what amounts to a cameo and is no longer a pole dancer. They did resurrect Dr. Brakish Okun (Brent Spiner) who apparently wasn't killed by the alien behind the glass. Bill Pullman returns as the retired President who initially comes off as senile. His daughter (Maika Monroe) is also a pilot.

The hot shot maverick pilot is Liam Hemsworth pretending to be Tom Cruise, but coming off more like Val Kilmer.

The story feels superficial. It was not iconic like the first one which built great characters we all loved and slowly went into the action. In this episode, the idea to harvest the earth's life and elements has changed to taking its core, something they could be doing to uninhabited planets. Pac-man is on our side and this leads to a sequel...if they decide to make it. Maybe they can find a way to knock off Liam Hemsworth and resurrect Will Smith.

A giant single alien? really stupid it was like watch godzilla the alien run around. This movie was designed as a filler to transfer you from the original to the future space interstellar war sequels that are intended to come after this movie. The reason the first movie was so good was because it seemed to be happening in a world that was not unlike our own and that made it seem all the more plausible. This sequel has all this ridiculous technology that was taken from the aliens and perfected in 20 years all without being able to read the alien language or turn on the ship that didn't blow up since it had landed before the first movies' successful alien attack. It took 20 years for the aliens to get the distress message and arrive back at earth and they managed to install these laser guns on their ship in the process.

Personally it kinda sucked that the son of Captain Hiller (Jessie Usher) gets usurped by Jake (Liam Hemsworth) in leadership in the movie.  Booo!  Everyone gets the girl in the end except for young Captain Hiller... Booo again!  Why is that? Rain, the female pilot, should have been his love interest for this popcorn fest.  That's one of the reasons I felt let down.  Perhaps he will meet his inter galactic love in the next installment... if they make part three.

If they do decide to make a part three it could redeem itself by not trying to so hard to fit in every thing from past films.  This could be a little annoying for those who've seen the first one.  However, when I took my camp kids they had not even seen the first one so I guess they had to do a little retelling of the story for new fans.  Most of my kids liked it but they missed out on originality of the first film.  Maybe they waited too long to make this next installment.  Maybe this movie should have come out 10 years ago.

There are some other things about the movie I thought were forced but overall I guess you'd say it's a good popcorn flick. Not much new in the realm of Sci Fi movies.  If they do decide to make part 3, it will go cosmic and expect the characters to travel across the universe.  This could be a great opportunity for visual effects when the people of earth meet other aliens who are fighting against the horde of bad aliens who are taking over planets across the universe.  Hopefully young Captain Hiller will find his love interest and be the heroic lead he was meant to be.

Good enough for the matinee.  I'm curious what they will do with part 3 even though it will be predictable... the good guys will win but the remainder of the old cast will probably die in some sort of self sacrificing way like some of them did in this installment.",1468108800,3,1901,4.2745098039215685

It also crowbars other old characters into the film.  Especially the old Jewish dad.  What was that all about?  What a waste of time.  (Spoiler) He drives a school bus to Area 51.  For no reason at all.  It's supposed to be funny? (End Spoiler)

That said, this movie twists and turns and surprises you MUCH more than Independence Day.  The good guys fail a lot, and that is entertaining!  It throws all its characters into new predicaments which they probably won't make it out of.  That kind of writing I appreciate.

It's a solid alien invasion movie with great special effects.  Yes, there are illogical parts--(Spoiler) like when humans can fly alien ships for no discernible reason (End Spoiler)--but, if you forgive some nonsense, you will get a mediocre action flick which looks pretty and has a few cool monsters.

The ending sets us up for a continuance of the series.  (Spoiler) A bombshell of information is dropped by a Pokemon ball alien-robot. (End Spoiler)  Not sure if anyone can write that nonsense, but Hollywood is good at nonsense.

7785550,4,B01HC3880G,"Very good sequel to the first movie by Roland Emmerich.  I am glad he decided to take control for the followup. I would have liked to see Will Smith for the screen presence alone, and I think that hurt the movie a little bit, however,  Bill Pullman, Liam Hemsworth, and Jeff Goldblum do a great job carrying the film.

(Story and some spoilers): Twenty something years after the failed invasion, the aliens  are back after receiving a distress call  from the first mothership. The earth has updated its defenses, but they are still not ready for the aliens and are committing the same mistakes from the first battle. That pretty much sums it up, Bill Pullman and Jeff Goldblum reprise their roles and act as the voice of reason throughout the movie. Pullman  as ex-President Whitmore is an older and wiser man, but isn't taken seriously even by his own daughter (played well by Maika Monroe) when he starts to ramble that he sees the aliens in his dreams coming back for revenge(like in the trailer). Goldblum as David Levinson is taken a little more seriously, but when when it comes down to making intelligent decisions by high ranking government officials, his opinion is merely cast aside.

Its a good movie loaded with action and special effects like the first movie,  so you are going to get your moneys worth at the theater. Its also filled with a familiar story  with the typical conflicts and battle of egos that one would expect in this scenario.  They added some nice surprises in the end as well involving the Queen which made things pretty interesting at the end. Overall, just a very entertaining movie.",1467763200,119,1617,4.702127659574468
7785551,4,B01HC3880G,"I had pretty modest expectations based on the reviews and the usual let down that sequels tend to be but despite these, I really enjoyed this film! I was quite a fan of the first film which was really spectacular, especially the way the alien ships blazed through the lower atmosphere. I recall thinking it was a bit like Star Wars meets Top Gun. This time around Earth has utilized the technology captured after the initial alien attack and developed better weaponry. Everyone's quite confident, but of course, the threat this time is much worse and once again, all seems lost. Fortunately, as in the first film, brave people combine for the sake of humanity and show the necessary resolve.

One of my friends observed it was a bit of a remake of the first film. I can see what he meant (and it worked for Star Wars Ep 7), the basic plot is certainly similar but there is a lot of fresh material here. The aliens are out to quickly destroy us this time. The attack is more ferocious and there is a key player for them who was very spectacular. We see a lot of characters in Earths response, including quite a number of survivors from the first film. Again, not everyone makes it through, which is fair enough. There is no one with Will Smiths presence though, so the action role is spread around a bit more. This worked ok for me. Again, happily, despite the incredible destruction and violence, there are no graphic deaths, sex or obscene language. Well done on this Hollywood!

Sure, there were plot holes, unlikely co-incidences and a need for more development in places but nothing that I couldn't shrug off.  On the credit side, there was some interesting attention given to what had happened since the previous attack and the special effects were great. There was also an intriguing development that points to a very different third film if it goes ahead. All up, I was very entertained! 4 stars",1467763200,20,1902,4.6047197640118

7785554,3,B01HC3880G,"This movie is just ridiculous. In an incredibly, mind-numbingly stupid way. It's almost, like, a parody of itself and the first Independence Day. And all of this would've been fine... in 1998 or '99. However, in 2016... not so much.

This is hard to describe. It's either a REALLY bad movie, by 2016 standards... or a really FUN movie by late 90's standards. Lots of ridiculous, almost fourth-wall-breaking quips and puns and dry humor from Jeff Goldblum while cities get destroyed around him. Video-game-like boss battles against alien ships, and a 100-foot tall ""final boss"" of the Harvester queen. And speaking of aliens, they sort of stole the entire third-act plot from Mass Effect in which a peaceful alien A.I (the Prothean A.I, Vigil, in the Mass Effect game) helps assist Earth in stopping the Harvesters from drilling to the planet's core and she even tells Earth the entire backstory of the Harvesters, how they wiped out her species, and how they can stop them. Yes, there's a *literal* Deus Ex Machina in this move!

This movie also doesn't work because it seems to have absolutely NO heart or soul in it. It feels SO cliche and hammy. Like that feeling you get watching a Syfy movie with a budget way too big for Syfy. There's no one to root for, except for MAYBE Patricia Whitmore, the somewhat-protagonist of the movie and the kind and heroic daughter of the former president Whitmore played by Bill Pullman. Maika Monroe is the one actor in this movie that didn't suck and to her credit, acts a lot more mature and intelligent than the usual everyday 23 year old. Everyone else, though... pretty lame and forgettable, including the originals they brought back for this. Obviously, not having Will Smith in this movie hurt it, but the movie never seemed to replace him with someone else, so there is literally no protagonist in this. Just a bunch of different characters we never really get to care for. Dylan, the air pilot son of Will Smith's character, *might* be considered the main protagonist, but not really.

And another issue, is the pacing of the movie. The beginning starts off SO slow! You'd think here would be the time they'd use some time-saving forced exposition, but nope. And what's worse is, in all this extra set-up, act one stuff, they don't even make the audience CARE about any of these new characters, or the old ones. Then, about half an hour into it, the Harvester mothership, the size of China that has its own plot-convenient gravitational pull that works only when it wants to, comes in and wrecks some city (Tokyo, maybe? I dunno) for a CGI circle-jerk They skip to the space parts in act two this time, but that just leaves act three to have the climax happen on lame old Earth (because the Harvesters are too clever to get tricked twice and brought Norton Anti-Virus with them, this time!). This means, the pacing of the movie feels like it's gone in reverse of the first one, where they slowly built up to going out into space. But in this high-tech, post-invasion version of Earth, humanity already has space flight due to reverse-engineering their technology.

Meanwhile, at some point after ID1 and before ID2, the peaceful alien chick A.I. computer sphere comes to Earth, but gets shot down in Africa and deactivated. During crisis invasion mode, Brent Spiner's Area 51 doctor character, manages to wake up from a coma, and bond with the sexy-but-snarky alien A.I. who knows perfect English and American accents and thinks of humanity as ""primitive and foolish, but brave and courageous"" and we're told by her how to stop the Harvesters, the warrior race that wiped out her species, and are basically space pirates and warlords who don't have their own planet anymore (thus, the giant mothership), and that they plan on using the Earth's core to fuel their ship and take the planet's resources for themselves. You'd think the sun, or any random unoccupied star, would make for a way more efficient energy source, or that a species this advanced would've developed solar power millennia ago, but whatever. So this drilling-into-Earth's-core plot device creates a forced countdown clock, where humanity has to beat the aliens before the country-sized mothership drills to Earth's core and that will kill all of us... for some reason... somehow.

So that leaves act three to have a REALLY hamfisted plot device of Judd Hirsch's character (Jeff Goldblum's dad) pick up a bunch of kids in a school bus, after somehow surviving a giant tsunami out at sea, that involves a subplot with some pre-teens, for some reason, that serves ONLY to set-up some really horrible forced tension, when the 100-foot Harvester queen comes to Earth to kidnap and destroy the alien A.I. sphere girl robot thing because it poses a threat to her empire, and then we get the queen wanting to kill the kids in the bus... for *reasons*, all while kidnapping the A.I. sphere, and this leads to the climactic final showdown video game boss fight... thing. In the same desert as ID1, no less.

Sigh. This movie must go through every cheesy 90's clich in the book. It might not have even been good in 1998, actually, since Will Smith isn't in this and probably would've been doing Wild Wild West or some garbage. Depending on how snobby of a movie goer you are, you will either LOATHE this movie with a passion, or like it as the dumb, fun, Bay-esque popcorn flick it want to be. Let's put it this way: if you liked ""Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice,"" you'll very much like this movie. And if you like movies like ""Transformers"" or the ""Fast and Furious"" franchise and miss late 90's science fiction summer blockbusters filled with ridiculous and painfully outdated movie clichs and plot devices we've all grown out of, as a society, you'll LOVE this movie.

So it all depends on how much you can suspend your disbelief and not roll your eyes into the back of your head until they come close to getting stuck that way. Independence Day: Resurgence is a film critic's worst nightmare. But a 'dumb popcorn flick loving movie goer's' dumb, fun, action and explosions, CGI-filled, dumb, ridiculous, over-the-top, cheesy, hyper-clich, DUMB, over-budget summer blockbuster popcorn flick. Watch it if you can put your brain and common sense on vacation. Otherwise, skip it altogether and save yourself the eye rolls and groans from the number of cheesy, overused and outdated clichs used in this movie to basically re-tell an inferior version of the same story.

Oh, yes. And the hamfisted sequel bait at the end. Coming June 2018: ""Independence Day: Retribution! ...In Space! ...In 3D!""

7785555,3,B01HC3880G,"Twenty years ago, in 1996, we were treated to the greatest B movie of all time. Well, now twenty years later its back with its first sequel, Independence Day: Resurgence. Most of the original cast along with writers Dean Devlin and Roland Emmerich have returned. Some have only minor roles but they are in there connecting the two stories together. Each of them a full twenty years older without the need for makeup creates a realism that would be impossible otherwise. Emmerich who directed the original ID4 released in 1996, also directed this sequel.

The only one who refused to sign on from the original cast was Will Smith who wanted $50 million for whatever role he would be called on to play. I guess 20 or 30 or 40 million was just not enough for the big rich Hollywood star who is just that way, too good to do something for us little guys out there who enjoy these movies. But then again isn't he one half of the dynamic duo that wants to change the Academy Awards to be based on race and ethnicity rather than talent. So, what else can you expect?

I was really excited when I heard that most of the original cast was back twenty years later to do the movie. Considering most sequels come shortly after successful films, creating movie franchises, it appeared to me that Emmerich and company was really on to something. At least that is what I first thought before I saw it. New characters need to be introduced but if the stars of the other movie don't play central roles it becomes a bit of a let down. And, that is what happened to Emmerichs direction. It was forced, contrived and at times didn't make sense. Either make the characters central to the story line or eliminate their part altogether.

Im still not sure what Vivica Fox, a stripper in the 1996 original was doing in this movie. What was she? A doctor? A nurse? Something medical anyway but couldn't figure out the light weight dimension that was laid out for her. It was not by design but rather the inability of Emmerich and Devlin to come together to tell a tale that would be equal or surpass the first film.

The story basically is that the killer aliens come back for a second try to destroy humanity. After the first try our own industriousness had us take the alien technology and build a defense that would prepare us better for another invasion. It helps, but of course, there would be no suspense if earth didn't need the genius of Jeff Goldblums David Levinson to figure out once again a weak spot and exploit it to destroy the big bad ugly aliens. And, I do mean ugly.

There is also going to be another sequel planned to be released by 2018 according to Wikipedia and there was some hint of what course the franchise will take as the story continues.

This sequel, like most sequels however, fell short of the original. Scenes were too fast and frantic at times to figure out all the action taking place making it hard to follow. Lighting was dark maybe on purpose so that the audience would have to use more of their imagination. But, that is not what we go to see a movie like this for and why green screens and computer graphics were invented.  Action, suspense, and violence in this movie, so exciting in the first round of ID4, was remarkably disappointing.

Emmerich, who has racked up some of Hollywoods greatest fantasy/disaster movies in addition to 1996s Independence Day, Godzilla, The Day After Tomorrow, 10,000 BC,  fell far short on this one, not hitting the high mark of those other productions. Independence Day: Resurgence had a convoluted story line, it didn't connect to an overall plot which would bring the movie to an intersecting climax like at the end of the first Independence Day after the president said, We will not go quietly into the night. Much of the added scenes could have been deleted, other sub plots could have been better developed.

Actually Im not sure exactly what Emmerich did wrong here, that he had done so right in most of his other movies but when you see it you will understand why it just didn't gel.

I don't know maybe I was expecting too much. Maybe Ill like it better when it comes out on Netflix next year and can watch it on the small screen. It was a disappointment for the follow up to the greatest B movie of all time.",1467417600,2,4267,4.5
7785556,2,B01HC3880G,"This isn't just Independence Day without Will Smith, which would be bad enough. Its Independence Day without the humor, wit, suspense and entertainment; a sequel so lackluster it feels more like a TV knockoff than a sequel. Most of the main characters are back, but the nostalgia is wasted. Rain, the token Asian, is cute, but the new people are just cardboard cutouts.

The plot, which introduces an ally alien sphere, is surprisingly stupid. Even worse is the dialogue, which goes from just being flat to laughably awkward as it wedges in quick-cut plot points. Can you believe it, a hospital worker says to a patient who appears to be sleeping, Youve been in a coma for 7300 days. One more day and he couldve slept thru this cinematic disaster.

Now with more advanced technology, Independence Day: Resurgence attempts to outdo the Oscar-winning visual effects of the original by adding quadruple the visual effects shots of what the original had. Almost all these effects are done with computers, but it still adds tremendous scale appropriately matching this newly arrived mother ship that took 20 years to improve for the next pursuit. This time, the ship is the size of the entire moon, and not even two decades could prepare our newly changed society for this.

Most of the original cast is back in action, and that old mixture of humor and disaster returns with the same nostalgic undertones of the original. There are many calls back to the first movie, and there are numerous subplots that span across the world, also like the original. Although theres nothing as memorable as the shot of the White House getting blown to smithereens, there are still plenty of satisfactory images that can help you to forgive the piss-poor efforts of everything else.

It all begins with the alternate 2016 from the world of this film series, where the current president is now a woman. Mankind now has a new meaning, for it took so much to recover from the war of 96. But its paid off: they now have an international moon base where half-trillion dollar weapons are stationed in case of another invasion. Down in the state of Nevada, Area 51 is established as a grounds where they imprison the aliens. Over in Central Africa, the Rebel Forces now have high-advanced armory, and are working with America to analyze a mother ship that has rested there since the war. These newly established relations suggest how the world is no longer consumed by petty differences, but rather united in common interests.

This future is a pretty cool alternate reality, if only the characters lived up to it. Jeff Goldblum is back as the co-lead, and he is doing just about everything youd expect Jeff Goldblum to do. As for the other stilted actors, Liam Hemsworth plays a new pilot on the moon base, and of course has some sort of love story with the typical female side character. Vivica A. Fox plays a potential love interest for, and I could barely understand her half the time because of her accent. Jessie T. Usher is rather interesting as the son of Captain Hiller, but he mostly reminds us how much better this movie could have been with Will Smith.

But the focus isn't on the acting. Its on the intense, horrifying imagery that makes big summer movies so amazing. Its on the cinematic presentation of everyone fighting for their freedomnot from tyranny, oppression, or persecutionbut from annihilation. When the mother ship first arrives on Earth, genuine fear is felt as Britains major monuments burn up in the apocalyptic red smoke, ascending into zero gravity from the impact.

Then from there, the mother ship launches its plasma beam into the earths core through the Atlantic Ocean. Its obviously done with computers, but the shadows the ship makes over the sea makes us terrified for our right to live, to exist.

Off in the US, places are flooded, leaving a bunch of possibly orphaned siblings to drive off with another man they rescued from the debris. These little personal elements add to the personal at-home feeling of how doomsday affects the entire world.

So sure enough, hundredsliterally hundreds of jets are sent out to fight the mother ship in an overwhelming blizzard of lasers. Its spectacular to watch on a large screen, and may just as well be worth watching in 3D, if you don't mind the overcrowding of things to look at on screen.
Although, I wonder if maybe the suspense could have been greater if we never saw the aliens. Its not just that they were the worst special effect in the film, but because they simply did not add much to the enjoyment, and made the films overall impact less meaningful. But it is still nice to see the turquoise tint of the ships inside with the aliens simple design, just like old times.

I will admit, Independence Day: Resurgence doesnt quite step it up from the movie we all grew up with. Its attempted message of worldly union is entirely forgotten by the last few moments, making this film go quietly into the night, vanishing without a fight. But guess what else? The attempted message is still true: No matter what nationality we are, we are all one people. We should be united as a world, not putting up walls or voting against the union with another continent. Maybe this movie didn't do it exactly the way it needed to, but its message still needs to be communicated now more than ever, if we wish to live on and survive.

7785559,3,B01HC3880G,"Roland Emmerich returns twenty years later in the much-anticipated sequel to the 1996 Sci-Fi blockbuster.  With him, much of the original stars make a determined appearance, minus Smith whose absence is remarkably apparent.  With that said, the younger cast is unable to capture the genuineness, wit, or affection of their predecessors as any real character development is sorely lacking.  Hemsworth is not his brother's equal in presence or talent, and Jessie Usher feels utterly lifeless as a replacement to Smiths iconic portrayal.  The remaining newcomers fare just as disappointingly, with their collective, unmistakably stale performances.  However, Goldblum, Paxton, and Spiner steal the show, reliving their leads with a renewed zeal, with Spiner as the undisputed standout in his extended role.
Where Emmerich fails is in his reliance on CGI over the heart that made the first film so very special.  The effects are stunning, but the lack of the soul of the original eclipses their massive presence.  Add to that some glaring plot anomalies, a predictable ending, and a lack of the feeling of real danger, this second falls monumentally short.  Even the emotion and humor are forced, as the script drags through another orgy of global destruction.  What a shame.  Of course, they leave open the possibility of a third, which, depending on revenues, may or may not happen.  Still a cosmic sized joy ride, but after two decades in the making, they should have delivered another modern day classic instead of an inferior counterpart.",1467158400,3,1539,5.215447154471545
7785560,3,B01HC3880G,"The Movie Review by Andy McKinney
Independence Day: Resurgence
 The twenty years of waiting for the sequel to what in 1996 was for a while the second highest grossing film of all time has come to an end.  We have ""Independence Day: Resurgence""  in our theaters now.  I thought that it lacks the magic of the first film but I still enjoyed it, just on a lesser level.  If this $200 million gigantisourus of a film makes money we have confidence that more will follow.  Why not?  Star Trek and Star Wars franchises still draw crowds into the multi-plex theaters across the globe.
 Like many extremely high budget films these days this one puts more emphasis upon the special effects than upon the characters.  We loved the first film so much because it took the time to develop the often odd ball characters.  We in the seats embraced them.  We still have quirky characters but we don't have as many of them nor are they given the same length of time to show their natures.  Not a good thing.  The alien invasion seems very much like a re-tread.  The big difference this time amounts to simply a bigger alien space ship.  The new alien ship reaches 3,000 miles from rim to rim.  Even the destruction of the alien ship has no novelty.  The writers use the same technique which actually shocked me when I saw it.
 So, the balance between exciting special effects and odd ball or heroic characters does not hold up as well as the first film.  What do I like?
 I like the returning cast members.  Brent Spiner (who once we knew as Data, a human shaped android in Star Trek) comes back as the hippie sounding and looking scientist at Area 51.  He has a larger role this time and makes the most of it.  Jeff Goldblum and Judd Hirsch both return to their roles as loving but prickly son and dad.  Vivica A. Fox returns as a former stripper.  Bill Pullman's stresses and strains from his job as president in the first film have been hard on him, but the ex-president still has a heart for the fight.  Robert Loggia has what is almost a cameo to relive his role as a leading general.  Liam Hemsworth, lately serving in the vastly successful ""Hunger Games"" films, I think firmly establishes himself as a heroic leading man in this film.  When he swashes or buckles we believe him.  A Chines actress has a small role as a fighter pilot in the nationality neutral Earth defense forces.  Her screen name is Angeliababy.  She is as adorable as her name.
 German born director Roland Emmerich also directed the first film along with other very good movies like ""The Patriot"" and ""White House Down"" but also some big budget disappointments like ""10,000 BC"" and ""The Day After Tomorrow"".  He and four others have a hand in the script.  This number of pens in the inkwell often results in a muddy, less focused story.  I think that theme holds true here.
 I can only muster an average three saw blade ranking for this big budget sequel to one of the most beloved films of all time.  The PG-13 film runs for exactly two hours.  Ticket buyers world wide have ponied up $140 million in the first few days of release which suggests a profitable if not spectacular pay back for the producers.
 In this movie and in many other space epics the battles between advanced space fighter craft seem like the movies we have seen about WWI and WWII fighter planes.  We know, or speculate at any rate, why this happens.  Naturally, in very advanced fighters the speed of the craft and the very advance weapons preclude the old style dog fight with blazing machine guns.  Why do movie guys continue to put this antiquated fighting style on the screen?  Us.  The viewers can understand the twisting, turning planes in a visual way.  We would have less understanding of and interest in fights that happen over a span of many miles where the opposing fighters never even see each other.  Besides, the sound effects are cool and we like the streams of lazer light pouring from the fighters.  Not realistic but we like it.",1467072000,13,3981,4.518934081346424
7785561,3,B01HC3880G,"On day two after Independence Day: Resurgence opened, I was just bored enough to take in a movie.  Now I should say at the onset that I was not a fan of the original Independence Day.  A totally contrived script, combined with clich characters, plot points that stretch incredulity to the breaking point and way too many pointless cameos do not a great film make.  Now I concede that suspension of disbelief is required for most science fiction films, but for my money, the unbelievable plot points in the original Independence Day simply broke the camels back.  In 1996, we were asked to swallow the idea that the President of the United States volunteers for old-times sake to lead a squadron of air force pilots against the alien enemy (Holy Mission accomplished, Batman!), while coincidence after coincidence assails the viewer from one end of the screen to the other.  Meanwhile, Jeff Goldblum hits on the brilliant idea of giving the enemys computer a virus (were the aliens running Windows Three, one wonders?) and actually manages with the help of Will Smith to blow them up AND escape alive.  I could go on and on about the tackiness and schmaltzy narrative of Independence Day, but this is a review of the sequel, so let me to it.

I will keep plot points to a minimum, as I do not believe in including spoilers in reviewing films of this genre.  Suffice to say that all your favorite clich characters are back in abundance, except Will Smith.  For whatever reason, Mr. Smith passed on this film, and he certainly dodged a bullet.  Not to fear  Jeff Goldblum, Bill Pullman, Vivica A. Fox and Judd Hirsch, to name just a few, are all back.  As about one quarter of the earth seems to be destroyed in Independence Day Insurgence, at least one of these will die tragically trying to save an uncredited actor.  The film includes the compulsory hero hunk (Liam Hemsworth), Madame President (Sela Ward), lots of starry-eyed kiddies and another hackneyed, clichd (sorry but there is no other word) performance by Jud Hirsch, who sets caricatures of elderly Jewish matriarchs back to the nineteen-thirties.  In a phrase, this film shall forever be known (to me anyway) as Independence Day: Regurgitation.  Of course the ending smacks of yet a third incarnation, that is, if the box-office does well enough to justify Independence Day Three.  Hopefully they will have the good taste to wait another twenty years for the third one; at that point I should be safely buried in my grave.

What more can I say?  If you loved the first film, you will undoubtedly adore Independence Day: Insurgence.  If, like me, you considered Independence Day a waste of two hours, avoid this sequel like the plague.

8764937,2,B01HC3880G,"I saw the first one and I loved it. I watched it at least a dozen times.  This one, even though some of my favorites were back, was not up to par. The plot was bad!!!!!  I never like sequels but I thought this one might be a good one to watch
WRONG.  If you want to spend $3.99 go for it but I could have had a Mocha Latte with that $3.99.  It just wasn't worth it.",1538006400,,365,3.641025641025641

8764944,5,B01HC3880G,This movie was amazing! I loved how so many people came back 20 years later. The action was great and new characters were introduced well. I'm so heartbroken about the cliff hanger and well never know what happened because of the bad ratings. I wish they would make one more just to complete the story. Just let it go syraught to dvd like the tremors franchise,1536278400,,360,4.46969696969697
