4099585,1,B0039ZF864,"Yet another movie by the Suicide Girls who only focus on the skinny drugged out bad attitude ones. Only giving a glance or two toward the thicker more curvy ones. This movie sucked, horrible acting.",1295654400,2,198,4.685714285714286
4099586,1,B0039ZF864,"This pathetic non-movie was only made to shamelessly promote the websites of these tattoo-riddled burned-out punk junkies who can't even get decent work doing fetish videos. It's disgusting that the self-loathing charlatans have now resorted to  blatantly ripping off horror fans by promoting this thing as 'horror'! No blood or gore, no suspense, etc. It's basically one LOOOONG photo shoot with unattractive and just plain nasty punk chicks resorting to the only card in their deck...getting naked. How can a movie with so many naked girls be boring? Well, this one damn sure is! The 'models' embarrassingly try to imitate every reality show you've ever seen by subjecting viewers to lengthy interviews with themselves as they bitch endlessly and have an arrogant attitude toward those who don't 'understand' them! These 'women' are destined to live sad and angry lives (due to their own bad choices), hating the world because it doesn't give a damn about them. This is really pathetic stuff.",1281571200,8,994,5.173913043478261
4099587,3,B0039ZF864,"If you like girls with tattoos and body piercings, and want to see T&A of them, you will like this movie.
Average to pretty looks for the girls, with a wide range of breasts, and semi-good bodies.  As interesting as they are to see, you will feel a compulsion to kill a few of them yourself while watching the movie.  Without spoiling the movie or the ending, these girls haven't taken many acting lessons.  But they do have that womanly naturally ability to slowly drive a sane man crazy.
Did I watch the whole movie? Yes.  Would I use the fast forward next time? YES.  Any screen worth pausing? Yes.  How often would I re watch this movie? About once every 5 Years.  Teenagers will re watch it more often.  This is not hardcore, nore is it going to win an Oscar.  Its an excuse for the Suicide Girls to show off their T&A.  Old Goats like Me who don't know much about ""Suicide Girls Groups type"" such as I just watched need to watch this so you know what others are talking about. That at least sounds like a good reason to see this if you get caught watching it.  It might seam like a better movie after the first six pack or a couple of straight ups.  Unless you wife or girlfriend has tattoos and body piercings, don't even think about asking her to watch it with you.",1279152000,17,1273,4.258333333333334
4099588,5,B0039ZF864,"This 'mockumentary horror' calendar shoot was awesome, the fear and horror the girls displayed was real. this goes to show that the suicide girls are human, and have a full range of emotions from love to fear. and as for the shoots them self, they are true to the suicide girl repertoire of being not just another nude shoot. they are artful...",1353888000,,344,4.564516129032258
4099589,1,B0039ZF864,"They may have joined the group however their personalities just don't fit with the whole concept of the family at all. The original SGs would never have done this catty, trashy vid. Don't buy it even if you are a fan of the concept of being a part of close knit group of like-minded people.",1351987200,,290,4.290909090909091
4099590,4,B0039ZF864,"A review from a female, for once...I love SuicideGirls. I love the ladies, the idea, the message, all of it. I think they're a great company. I bought this DVD expecting something completely awful yet somehow decent because it features hot naked chicks. What I got was a reality horror movie, a look into some of the girls' real personalities, and a sort of behind the scenes look at how photos are taken. The plot was pretty decent. The girls were not good actors because as they said, it's a REALITY horror movie. The SG that was really whiny the whole time was pretty annoying and honestly they didn't choose the hottest of the pack to have in the movie, but it depends on what you're in to. You see what you want to see and get a movie to go with it. For what it is, it's pretty rad.",1332633600,,787,4.253333333333333
4099591,3,B0039ZF864,"Nothing outstanding here.  A couple of the girls are attractive, all would be better looking without the tats and piercings.",1326240000,,124,5.2
4099592,5,B0039ZF864,"I expected this movie to be ok, with a moderately lame plot and gratuitous nudity. It is a reality horror movie - the first of its kind. I got the unrated version deliberately to ensure having something to watch (worried too much would be cut for the R-rating). I was pleasantly surprised - the plot was actually believable. The girls are NOT actors. It is shot mostly from POV handheld cameras, although there were camera people involved. The girls are a little wild, ranging from cute and pretty to drop-dead knockout. Their reactions and emotions seem authentic. All-in-all, I was thoroughly entertained by this move.",1316304000,,620,4.914285714285715
4099593,4,B0039ZF864,"If you don't find girls with tattoos and piercings attractive, you probably won't like this movie. The premise is simple - a dozen or so girls from the SuicideGirls.com website go to an isolated house to shoot a nude calendar. As the shoot goes on, strange things begin happening, girls start disappearing, etc. Simple, really. So why are there so many negative reviews here?

Because the girls aren't actresses. Here's the thing, though - most of the girls really thought it was just a photo shoot. They're not acting at all. Do they get whiny and argumentative? Absolutely - wouldn't you be in a bad mood if your friends disappeared without a trace?

All in all, I liked the movie. If you take it for what it is - *not* a professional studio movie - it's quite entertaining. And the girls? They're constantly naked, and gorgeous. There's a reason these girls are on the website and have such devoted fans.

So, to recap: If you're expecting a Hollywood-quality slasher movie, this isn't it. If you find girls with lots of tattoos and piercings unattractive, or you don't want to see copious amounts of female nudity, find a different movie to watch. But if you think the SuicideGirls are beautiful, and you want to see how they'd react in a real-life horror movie, this is the one for you.",1313539200,9,1291,4.6535087719298245
4099594,3,B0039ZF864,"I was watching Showtime and came across what I wasn't sure was a reality show or a really bad movie. I checked the info and it only had the title, 'Suicide Girls Must Die'. I thought it was about girls who had tried to commit suicide....I was wrong. They fought just like VH1's reality show girls fight...over the dumbest things or things they just make up. It was almost over and I was curious to see if it was real or not. When I saw the blonde with the leg brace with a fake ax in her, it was too stupid to even laugh. And then there are 5 or so girls on an island, half naked acting retarded. I read someone write it's not about their physical beauty, it's about what's inside. But most don't seem to care about anything but trying to show off some naked part of themselves. Maybe it's only me and everyone likes something different, but I was shocked at how much extra fat was on most of their bodies. If someone is just watching to see a naked girl, because there's no point to anything else that happens, they're wasting their time...better off watching Playboy, etc. And if none of them have ever really tried to commit suicide, that is a disrespectful title for them to use against people who really have attempted suicide. These supposed 'Suicide Girls' should watch their horrible film and try slashing their own wrists.
Edit on 12-13-13 I haven't seen this again but I think my first impression was based on all the reality shows I saw at the time. Once I read more about 'The Suicide Girls', I realized it wasn't just some wanna be movie/reality show. These girls are talented in their own way and especially in the way they express themselves. They are not just the normal pin-up girl but are actually art themselves.",1303344000,2,1731,4.446540880503145
4099595,1,B0039ZF864,Pornography is ubiquitous. Good slasher films are many and often contain gratuitous nudity. The idea of combining a slasher film with a softcore porno is like putting a bunch of tiny grilled cheese sandwiches on top of a pizza. A pizza is nothing but dough and cheese. Slasher films guarantee gore and pornography. Why water down both genres as this plotless poor cousin to a film does? Either watch a real slasher movie or get a girlfriend.,1301616000,4,441,4.740259740259741
4099596,4,B0039ZF864,"Its not a bad movie. It's reality TV meets horror. The first I have ever seen of its type and I think they did a good job, yeah the nude shoots went on a bit long, but thats TSG for you, their about showing their tats, piercings and body, but its a new twist to the whole Reality TV phenomenon  I think the girls played their parts well. Looking back there are somethings that don't make sense, but in order to convince the viewers they had to do it. I say give it a try but keep in mind its a reality movie. Don't expect it to be The Texas Chainsaw Massacre.",1298419200,,559,3.9910714285714284
4099597,1,B0039ZF864,"I paid $14 at Best Buy just out of curiosity. It was like a pathetic attempt at the Blair Witch Project type of movie. The girls are skinny, trashy, foul-mouthed, tatooed, druggie looking that offer nothing to the human race. I guess there will be enough dumb like me that purchase crap like this on a whim without reading reviews that they will actually make money off of this tripe.  SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!",1296086400,3,404,4.534246575342466

They do a photo shoot where the girls go FF naked. Don't worry if you want to see the photographers' tatas there is a hot tub scene.

8392638,4,B0039ZF864,"Think ""Blair Witch Project"". ""Paranormal Activity"", or even ""Cam Girls"".
In the ancient days of the 60's, we called these type movies ""cinema verite"".
But with the internet has come 1000's of amateur videos which try to be ""real"",, which even include ""actors"", but never come close to anything professionally produced.
""Suicide Girls Must Die"" (the unrated edition) is about a group of girls (from NYC?) who travel to remotest Maine to do a photo-shoot for a sexy (mostly nude) calendar.
Some other reviewers seem to know who the ""suicide girls"" are.
I'd guess they're like a segment of the goth-punk-gen X crowd.
They're heavily tattooed (some really artistic & colorful!) and wear nipple rings and such.
The movie starts off with the trip to Maine, where they've apparently rented a cabin for a week.
They go out daily on photo shoots, usually just 5 or 6 of the dozen or so girls at a time.
Much time is spent with the camera slowly ogling the naked bodies of these very attractive, curvy women.
Very enjoyable, I must admit, for this old horny fart!
But suddenly, one by one, the girls disappear.
And no one knows where they went to, and don't seem to care.
Well, a couple of the girls care, and become more stressed and scared as the group becomes decimated.
There's an old groundskeeper with a rifle, but he doesn't seem to be a killer.
There's a squatter on this remote island they go to for a shoot, but when the police come to investigate, they confront the guy, and declare him innocent.
The tension mounts, with no explanation for the girls' disappearances.
I won't reveal the ending, but it's a real shocker.
Were all those girls murdered by zombies risen from a small cemetery nearby?
Was it one of the girls who wasn't who everybody thought they were?
I'll just say the ending is a total surprise.
In my opinion, it came with too little explanation, with not enough lead-in.
Overall, this was one of the best ""amateur"" movies I've ever seen.
And not just because of all the naked girls!",1409616000,2,2000,4.636619718309859
