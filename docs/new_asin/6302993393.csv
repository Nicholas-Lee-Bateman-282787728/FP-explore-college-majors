8221018,5,6302993393,I have been looking for this VHS of Magic Kid for the longest. I am very pleased with seller and shall be back for more buys in the future!,1369699200,,139,3.8275862068965516
8221019,3,6302993393,"In 1993, the world of B-movies was introduced to PM Entertainment's belated answer to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ralph-Macchio/dp/B0008JIJ2E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ralph Macchio</a>: martial arts prodigy Ted Jan Roberts, making his feature film debut in the first of the two ""Magic Kid"" flicks (more aptly known as ""Ninja Dragon""). It's a bit of a weird vehicle that's not nearly as funny as it seems to think, but is still a decent slice of nostalgia from the 1990s and paved the way for more TJR vehicles with a wider appeal.

The story: whilst visiting their screwup Uncle Bob (Stephen Furst,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/National-Lampoon-s-Animal-House/dp/B0000A02TZ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">National Lampoon's Animal House</a>), 11-year-old Kevin (Roberts, actually 12 or 13 at the time) and his sister Megan (Shondra Whipple,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Family-of-Spies/dp/B003JLL2R2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Family of Spies</a>) get caught up in their uncle's bumbling dealings with the local mafia, necessitating Kevin to employ his uncannily developed martial skills.

A preteen beating up mob enforcers? Yes, it's as weird and unbelievable as it sounds. Many of the nine fights approach&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/3-Ninjas/dp/B00008979O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">3 Ninjas</a>&nbsp;territory of implausibility, though admittedly Ted is friggin' amazing for his age when it comes to fight choreography (more on that in a bit). His character is a bit annoying for his nonstop sanctimoniousness towards his goofy uncle,  his endless references to his ""ninja dragon code,"" and his hero worship of Don 'the Dragon' Wilson (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bloodfist/dp/630582469X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bloodfist</a>&nbsp;series), who performs a couple cameo fight scenes for the flick. Along with his sister, Kevin's also pretty damn whiny and demanding, insisting on eating at famous restaurants and visiting the Universal Studios theme park whilst knowing that their uncle is wanted by the bad guys. Then again, this uncle isn't exactly the sort of guy you'd have a lot of respect for: Stephen Furst is a comedy regular, but his performance here is overdone, awkward, and consists mainly of mugging for the camera. The act is merely sparingly funny.

With that said, Furst puts his all into this performance, playing up the clumsy adult shtick until you can't help but be intrigued by all the weird things he says and does. Much of the movie is like that: it's full of beach bums getting beaten up with their own surfboards, violent costume parties, extremely questionable language and behavior exhibited in front of children, and 90s pop culture galore - all awkward, but generally inoffensive and interesting to watch. And one thing no one can fault the film for is Ted Roberts' karate moves. The kid is amazing. Despite their goofiness, it's impossible not to enjoy his fights, which are for the most part smoothly filmed and show off all the moves this guy had to offer, including surprisingly proficient weapons-handling. He doesn't have any particularly interesting opponents to go one-on-one with, but the eventual team-up between him and Wilson to take on a group of thugs is definitely cool.

I've watched most of Roberts' other vehicles and enjoyed them, and while I can say the same for this one, the cutoff point for viewers' age is pretty low by comparison. Some parents may be disgruntled at all the violence and alcohol consumption and the occasional naughty language, but this one's still meant mainly for kids. But hey, if Roberts' in-movie character was allowed to watch Don Wilson movies at his age, there are probably parents who'd let their 11-year-olds watch this one.

8221020,3,6302993393,"Awesome price. Item arrived promptly and appears to be new.
However, I'm unable to watch the movie due to the lack of closed captions. Being deaf/HOH, captions are a necessity.

Not only is CC not an option (Despite Amazon and the boxcase indicating captions are included), the movie plays with embedded Spanish subtitles!?
Amazon makes no reference to this!

Sadly, I'll have to return the item.",1358553600,,396,4.984848484848484
8221021,5,6302993393,I got this movie for a boy's birthday and they just run on and on about it.  They loved it.  I doubt if I would but I'm old.,1232841600,,124,3.392857142857143
8221022,3,6302993393,"Why oh why didn't this kid become the next big martial arts movie star? It's beyond me, but he clearly SHOULD have. I watched Magic Kid for the first time in 1999 and I absolutely loved it's simply themed premise and lighthearted plot. It was perfect for what it was: a movie about a kid who happens to be a black belt fighter with moves to baffle everyone around him. Though this movie doesn't show his true talent to the degree that A Dangerous Place does, it is a movie with a lot of heart and just-sit-with-the-kids-on-a-saturday-afternoon-and-enjoy a better-movie-than-the-traditional-kids-section-fodder kind of mentality to it. If you want an intricate story, look elsewhere, but if you want to see a boy with some true talent in a movie that doesn't insult kids' intelligence, see Magic Kid. 3.75 stars",1134691200,3,810,4.91970802919708
8221023,4,6302993393,"This movie is a very good movie.  I watched this sometime ago probably 7-8 years ago.  And I just watched it again couple days back.  And after I watched it again couple days back, I was like ""This really is a good movie"".  To be just a average movie, nothing big class, its a very good movie.  Actually, better than a lot of higher class movies.

This movie is about a kid with some good Martail Arts movies, and I do mean some good ones.  Its just like a Karate Kid all over again, but with less training and more action.  I really injoyed this movie.  Was my 1st movies watching T. J. Roberts in action, and I really liked this upcoming Martial Arts star.  But now in 2005, he has done nothing for a long time.  And he was a very good star at that, just hated to see him disappear just as quick as he appeared.  Would have been a awesome Martail Arts star to this day.  He is one hell of a good martail arts kid.  Love this movie, and all of his 4 other movies.",1118880000,6,964,4.031746031746032
