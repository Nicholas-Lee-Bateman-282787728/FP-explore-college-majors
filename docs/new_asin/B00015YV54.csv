8007076,5,B00015YV54,"I highly recommend this series, WIRE IN THE BLOOD.  This series keeps you interested and each story keeps you on the edge trying to figure out the villian and how to capture him/her.",1305072000,,182,4.515151515151516
8007077,4,B00015YV54,"While maybe the episodes just a little padded, this dvd is still a stunner.  Robson Green and Hermione Norris manage to pull off that difficult job of tightly leashed sexual attraction in a story that revolves around a pedaephile's return to the community and a mysterious series of deaths.

The story never lets down it's emotional high pitch whether it is the police dealing with one another or the community demanding justice or Robson's character, a psychologist working with the police, working out the feelings of the killer in his own mind.

The suspense is sustained and Robson and Norris' characters are fascinating if off kilter.",1094342400,3,639,5.009433962264151
8007078,4,B00015YV54,"I find it really irritating that, after I buy the first Wire in the Blood DVD, that they release all three in a set - at a much cheaper price than if bought individually.
The show is really great but I am really unhappy about the way the DVD's were released!!",1081209600,6,259,4.098039215686274
