8172385,5,B000MU0634,"This tape series is great!  Try to get ALL FOUR tapes if you can.  There should be  at least one set of four in the used sales.  This way of learning Geometry is the best.  I am a homeschool mom who didn't remember much about Geometry and this series saved all of us!  Very logical and complete, moves forward one step at a time.  Get ALL FOUR tapes if you can, it is worth it!",1284508800,,377,3.9466666666666668
