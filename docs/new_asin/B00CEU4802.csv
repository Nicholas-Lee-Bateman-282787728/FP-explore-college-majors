5720872,4,B00CEU4802,"Typical story of a boy who becomes a man and after spending some time in prison becomes better than bruce lee..

Idont know about all that but was a pretty sound story even though the fighting looked like a wiff a wheel .. you know people going in a circle and swiping a bat at the hero untill its their turn.

still tho i liked it.",1376956800,,332,4.015151515151516

5720875,4,B00CEU4802,I enjoyed this movie as far as the fighting scenes but I hate watching movies with subtitles.  I wish they had a dvd that I could change the language to English because the subtitles were coming so fast I couldn't finish reading what they were saying and I'm an excellent reader.,1407456000,,279,4.470588235294118

5720879,1,B00CEU4802,"I love the way the movie started an torwards the middle, but the end was the worst I've seen in years. A bad ending to a good movie.",1387929600,2,132,3.75
5720880,3,B00CEU4802,"When it comes to martial-arts movies, theres not much that hasn't been done.  As a result, some of the fight scenes in newer movies come across as bland and, in some cases, even cliche.  This is not to say that these movies are not worth watching; on the contrary, some have excellent drama to fill in the gaps.  Such is the case with THE KING OF THE STREETS.  While its fight scenes are mediocre, the drama that surrounds them is definitely worth the watch.

Now, don't get me wrong:  this movie is not bad by any means.  It is shot well, looks great onscreen, and the acting is good, too.  But the fight scenes are just sorta blah.  They are ok for the most part, but the don't bring anything new to the table.

THE KING OF THE STREETS has a great story and is all about a man on his quest for redemption after taking the life of another fighter eight years before.  Personally, I think the death was justified, since his opponent pulled a knife and tried to stab him with it.  But, I guess there wouldnt have been a movie without it.

Yue Feng and his inner-dilemma as to whether or not defend the orphanage is the true gem of this film.  Whereas the fight scenes are bit lackluster, the turmoil involved with his decision is what makes for good entertainment.  Actor Yue Song gives an excellent performance in this role and makes the movie for me.

THE KING OF THE STREETS will probably not win any awards, but its worth checking out, especially if you are not looking for a traditional martial-arts film.  But don't go into this one looking for amazing fight scenes.  They are decent but not enough to carry the whole film.",1386288000,,1628,4.3879598662207355
5720881,5,B00CEU4802,"This movie is the exact reason I've stopped watching most everything that is out of American Hollywood. This movie makes all of the so called ""blockbusters"" or ""epics"" look like high school class projects made by people who are afraid to just grow up.

If you've never seen today's asian cinema, or think that all Chinese, Thai, and other asian films are just Kung Fu flicks with bad dubbing, then you are in for an amazing treat.  These films look very real.  No glorified and overly exaggerated the way american films do it.

This is better than Crouching Tiger, House of Flying Daggers, or any of those other pansy-looking ""flying in the air like fairies"" -types of current asian entertainment.

Check out the film releases coming from Well Go Entertainment or Magnet. They seem to get most of the best of today's asian films.

After this film, I suggest you check out, Bangkok Revenge, and Red Cliff. For twentieth century war dramas, check out Warriors of the Rainbow, My Way, Tae Guk Gi: the Brotherhood of War, and Back to 1942.

You'll be hooked on asian films before you know it. Look into the trailers on the films I've mentioned above.",1383264000,5,1146,4.6716417910447765
