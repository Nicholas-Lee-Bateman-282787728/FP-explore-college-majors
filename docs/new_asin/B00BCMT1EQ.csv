8566121,5,B00BCMT1EQ,"A pair of Geographic documentaries, both concentrating on the ancient world. The Noah's Ark documentary follows Robert Ballard on the Black Sea, looking at evidence of a massive flood that may have inspired the folk tales that eventually led to a biblical tale. The Egyptian documentary studies various aspects of ancient Egypt, including archaeological discoveries and the process of making a mummy in the present day. Both documentaries are insightful, particularly for those with an appreciation of the ancient world.",1369699200,,520,5.5125
