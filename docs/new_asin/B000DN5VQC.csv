8102578,4,B000DN5VQC,"You might look at this as the B-movie version of the classic ""It Happened One Night."" This time around, it's the tale of a G.I. (Dave O'Brien, probably best known for his B-westerns) and a rich girl engaged to the wrong man (Kay Aldridge, a lovely model probably best known for
her work in movie serials). It's a simple, light-hearted story as the mismatched duo gets in one scrape after another and, even if you know how
it's all going to turn out, getting there is a lot of fun. The movie also shows an unexpected comedy side to the two lead actors. Fun stuff!",1428019200,2,562,4.3619047619047615
