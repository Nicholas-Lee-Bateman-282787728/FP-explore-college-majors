4652685,4,B005CFC04W,"Brief (as possible)10 movie review here.  First, it is worth actually, more than I paid, but I got it really cheap, $8 and change shipped.  So it is worth that or more if you're into sci-fi.  I'm comparing this to modern B movie style films.

I'll award up to 1 star for each - acting - directing - story/plot/writing - interest - and, since it's sci-fi, creature/special fx

Also, so you will know (because Amazon often gives no indication of this) thought I'd include a legend so you would know the basic content.  V = violence and terror  AS = adult situations  N = nudity  BN = brief nudity  AL = adult language  SS = sexual situations,  and Gore.  I'll note if any of these are explicit.

Disc 1;

Monster - I really wanted to like this one.  Billed as a Mockbuster from Asylum as it is a low budget Cloverfield type offering.  It, unfortunately failed.  The borrowed home movie style, jerky camera work and simulated video camera cut-out/malfuntion to the next scene was taken to extreme.  Many won't like this and it could make those sensitive to motion sickness unhappy campers. The acting is actually good (1 star) it is fairly interesting so 3/4, story was workable (1/2). Directing is up to opinion, I would award something if it were not for.... Any director who is making a monster movie should make sure there is a MONSTER.  You see an occasional tentacle, but never a monster.  Sorry to ruin it for you but still worth a watch to see what could have been if you liked Cloverfield.  I'd still give it 2 1/4 stars with that warning.  Incidentally, I thought it was odd that director Erik Estenberg (or his camera man)seemed to be infatuated with the home movie jerky camera work but it always seemed to land on the breast butt or crotch of someone,.  Usually one of his two young ladies (Sarah Lieving & Erin Evans) who portrayed sister reporters interviewing global warming experts in Tokyo when an earthquake/monster attack occurs.  No nudity,mind you.  V, AS

Apocalypse - 1 star for story (and that is a stretch) because the basic story is good science fiction fare.  Coming asteroid induced end of the world sort of thing.  Truly B A D.  Can't really put a legend on this 1 because I could only stomach 30 minutes tops. Waste of electricity so Go Green, don't watch it.

Invasion of the Pod People - Another Asylum mockbuster spin of Invasion of the Body Snatchers.  B movie that wanted to B better.  Acting was, for the most part good, Story and plot (early on) were good with some writing short-comings, Actually was fairly interesting but tended to wane a little later on because the whole thing went a little south at about mid=point.  Directing was decent.  Alien spawn carried to earth via seeming meteor shower intent on replicating people and ...having sex????.  If you are interested, it does have a interesting lesbian scene that is not explicit, I guess the aliens are horny after their long space flight. At the introduction of horny comes corny, made no sense.  lost at least 3/4 stars as a result.  Became a 2  star offering.  N, AS, SS, AL, V

War of the Worlds 2 - C. Thomas Howell backed sequel to War or the Worlds version he stared in, not the Tom Cruise blockbuster.  He stars here also.  Pretty fair offering.  Decent acting, decent story (fair writing), fair directing, and moderately interesting.  Some of the graphics are pretty good, some aren't.  Scores at 2 3/4.  The martians return for some payback but Earth fights back.  V, AL, AS

eXistenZ - Last and Best on disc one and the set.  Jennifer Jason Leigh and Jude Law scifi offering about acheiving Nirvana thru the utilization of your very own Pet/Parasite.  Futuristic, and IMO, well acted, & directed with a good story line.  I thought interest level was very good.  Pace slowed a bit at times.  Very little cheese in this one.  Give it 4 stars.  I really don't think this qualifies as a B movie, it's better overall.  V, AS, SS, BN

Next Disc (they really aren't dubbed disc 1 and disc 2)

Killer Deal - made for TV movie with descent acting, directing, and plot.  Fairly interesting.  Note that the picture quality on this 1 seems a little off (may just be my disc though).  After the 2009 financial crisis the rift between rich and poor widen and an organ buying/selling opportunity presents itself.  Of course harvest time is alot of work and you can get pretty darn nasty.  Complete with the classic corruption which accompanies cash. 2 1/4 stars. V, AS

Convict 762 - Spaceships and sadistic killers, what better marriage can there be.  An all female crew of a spaceship are forced to refuel at a penal colony.  Not so smart.  They do figure that out.  Has some really cheesy graphics and sets. Not real bad,  but not far from it.  Has some laughable scenes. Billy Drago stars, and always makes a pretty good bad guy,  but everyone has a little off day, and guess what.... this was his and he's the psycho but,then, is he the real bad guy?  2 Stars V, SS, BN, AS, AL

Adrenaline, Fear the Rush - Christopher Lambert, Natasha Henstridge, I cannot, in my right mind, give this more than 2 3/4 stars and I may not be in my right mind.  A disease is unleashed by accident that threatens the world.  A cannibal killer is on the loose and the hunt is on, but who is the prey??  Has the most gore of all on the set.  Takes top billing on 2nd disc too. V, Gore, AL, BN (No, not Miss Henstridge)

The Cyberstalking - made for TV movie - dance yourself to death.  Dance club utilizes computer generated fantasy world but things go wrong. There is a dark figure in the machine, a menacing dark thing.  Wanted to be a good movie. 1 1/4 stars AL V AS

Final Encounter - Acting on this one is pretty good, plot and directing were acceptable even if the writing left a little to be desired.  Graphics were under par in many scenes and OK in others.  It to, was moderately interesting.  It's another 2 3/4 star flick.  Basically 2 colonies on an Earth like planet that were supposed to be the hope of humankind have digressed into warring factions against each other for 100 years.  They are mostly down to fighting with children and some war by holograms.  Descent action and pace.  Worth a watch anyway.  V AL AS

This is a good multi pack offering worth the meager price it usually goes for.  Existenze being top shelf here, followed by Adrenaline Fear the Rush (cool title, don't you think?), Final Conflict and War of the World's 2.  all of these except eXistenZ suffered from their low budget mainly in the graphics dept. but films like Invasion...Pod People really needed a larger cast of extras and bit roles.  I think you'll be happy with your purchase.",1352678400,39,6653,4.521885521885522
4652686,4,B005CFC04W,"Just received this movie pack and very happy, received a lot sooner than I thought, I haven't watched the movies yet but I paid about five dollars for ten sci-fi movies and many of these were either on t.v. or in the movies, all pretty recent, so a great deal for the buck.",1338768000,6,273,4.169811320754717

4652688,5,B005CFC04W,"This is a collection of science fiction B Movies that are made more to be fun than serious science fiction.  What makes some of the movies funny is the very fact they take themselves very seriously.  These are movies you watch on late nights with someone you love.  You watch these movies when you have that itch to do something weird and a video game just won't do.  the video quality is not first rate because; they attempted to put too many movies on too few disks.  The movies are for the most part watchable but, video and sometimes sound is problematic.  The plots are often paper thin some of them are well done.  the sets in some cases are cheap in a funny way.  My friends like picking out continuity errors and if you are good at it these movies seldom dissapoint.

This 10-Movie Sci-Fi Pack earned my five star rating. So long as you buy these movies in the certain knowledge they are more comical than sci-fi and the bad audio video quality is in part of what makes them funny you won't be disappointed.  I will actually buy bad movies just to see for myself how bad a truly sci fil movie bad can get so I am not disappointed at all in this 10-Movie Sci-Fi Pack set.",1403222400,,1178,4.289592760180995

4652694,2,B005CFC04W,"I wasn't expecting too much except for a mix of B-grade sci-fi movies, and in that regard I wasn't disappointed.  The noteworthy exception was ""eXistenz"" starring Jude Law, which was a really good, thoughtful and exciting thriller!  ""War of the Worlds 2"" also wasn't too bad, just a little slow moving.  The rest had production values similar to a sy-fy movie of the week (the recent ones that are quickly and poorly made).  ""Invasion of the Pod People"" was an especially bad rip off of  ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"", and was so pornographic I thought I had ordered the wrong genre!  The producers copied a news flash bulletin on two different movies, and the background music on most of the films were so slow and boring, it could easily been used as background to a funeral procession.  Not too bad of a deal though, as long as your expectations aren't too high.",1389571200,3,868,4.633986928104576
4652695,2,B005CFC04W,"Let me give you a quick run down here: there are only two movies here that are sort of worth watching. The first is Existenz, an OK but strange effort from Cronenberg, not his best. Then there is Adrenaline: Fear the Rush, which is borderline watchable. At least these two movies have recognizable actors. The rest are pure trash. movies you might watch if you were stranded in a small town, in a cheap motel, on a rainy day, and there was absolutely nothing else to watch on TV...then you might watch them...or you could just stare at the wall.",1381795200,,545,4.46

4652697,3,B005CFC04W,"Contents range from about 4 thru the hypothetical 0 but the totality is worth the five bucks from Amazon Prime. You should also, of course, check to see that you don't duplicate too many from other collection disc sets. As most know, issuers put out various packages containing films that appear in other collections. For those with defective hearing note that none of the movies have subtitles. Like me you just have to do the best you can with headphones.",1374796800,,457,4.725
4652698,1,B005CFC04W,"I was very disappointment in the pack.  It had only one movie that I had ever heard of and the rest were B (C,D,F) movies.",1373846400,,122,3.88
4652699,2,B005CFC04W,"the old adage you get what you pay for is definitely true in this case.  existentz was very good, but the others were terrible, many of them i couldn't watch, as the plots made no sense and the acting, well lets just say b grade they weren't!!!",1371427200,,244,4.191489361702128
4652700,4,B005CFC04W,"This is a set that contains 10 different Sci fi movies.  I bought it specifically for Adrenaline: Fear the Rush because I wanted that movie in my collection.  The price I paid is reasonable for that one film.  But I get 9 others along with it.  If I like just one of them I've gotten a great deal.  Of course there are no special features with these movies, no director's commentaries, no interviews with cast/crew, no production photos.  But hey, ten movies for the reasonable price of one, you can't complain.  Especially if you know ahead of time you want at least one of them.

I will now list the movies with a very brief synopsis.  I'll try not to give any major story points away:

1) Adrenaline: Fear the Rush - Two cops chase a murderer and an infectious disease
2) Existenz - a virtual reality game run amok
3) Final Encounter - Two space colonies battling each other
4) War of the Worlds 2: the Next Wave - The aliens return and mankind is forced to make a desperate last stand
5) Convict 762 - A killer is loose on a penal colony and terrorizing a crew of astronauts
6) Invasion of the Pod people - Aliens invade and make clones of people
7) Cyberstalking - More virtual reality, this time at a high tech dance club
8) Monster - Japan has trouble, but it wasn't an Earthquake.  Something is out there.
9) The Apocalypse - A giant asteroid is hurtling toward Earth and a couple must find their only child who is missing before all hell breaks loose
10)Killer Deal - People's internal organs are being harvested without their consent

Granted these are not blockbuster films, but if you enjoy a good B movie, or ten, this two disc set is for you.",1371081600,18,1656,4.375816993464053

4652702,4,B005CFC04W,"EXISTENZ
A virtual reality game's designer is violently attacked and real-life dangers begin to merge with fantasy.
My review: Jennifer Jason Leigh and Jude Law star in this film and, despite it's slow-pacing, I thought it was a good movie. I'm quite surprised that it was included in this collection as I wouldn't have considered it a B-movie but that's just me. One of the better offerings in this collection.

FINAL ENCOUNTER
Two human colonies on a distant planet are locked in a brutal hundred-year war until a group of brave soldiers decides it's time to end the fighting.
My review: Decent sci-fi movie starring Dean Cain. I liked it. Action was good. Worth a look.

WAR OF THE WORLDS 2: THE NEXT WAVE
When the aliens return to complete their plan of human domination, mankind unites in one last stand.
My review: Way better than the first film, in my opinion, even though it did poorly when it was released. It was more upbeat and expertly paced. Better acting, as well. Loved it!

CONVICT 762
A spaceship crew comes face to face with a methodical killer at a penal colony.
My review: Not too impressed with this movie even though I'm a fan of Billy Drago's work. It's not too bad but there's too much cheese and not enough substance. Meh!

INVASION OF THE POD PEOPLE
After a woman's closest friends undergo extreme personality changes, she begins to suspect that they have been replaced by alien invaders.
My review: Pretty good take on Invasion of the Body Snatchers. Great acting, great direction, good pacing. My only gripe? Needless sex scenes. Didn't see the point in them as the movie was good enough to begin with. Worth a look.

THE APOCALYPSE
A mother and father search for their only child as a giant asteroid headed for Earth triggers a series of apocalyptic events.
My review: Excellent movie about the coming of the end times. Similar in tone to the Left Behind series but not quite as deep. Cameo from up-and-coming actress Sarah Lieving. Loved it!

ADRENALIN: FEAR THE RUSH
A hard-edged veteran and a rookie cop must quickly track down a savage murderer who threatens the world with his contagious disease.
My review: Christopher Lambert, Natasha Henstridge star. Excellent movie even though it slowed down to a crawl for me a time or two.

CYBERSTALKING
A high-tech dance club that uses software to create a virtual fantasy world becomes a deadly place when one of its performers goes missing.
My review: Meh. So-so for me.

MONSTER
Footage of a catastrophic event in Japan reveals that it wasn't actually an earthquake...it was something else.
My review:Another Sarah Lieving effort. Loved it! Course, I could of did with a little more monster and alot less running around.

KILLER DEAL
A detective attempts to expose a corrupt organ harvesting ring.
My review: Descent acting, directing, and plot. Good watch. However, this one just wasn't my thing.

Overall review:Sound and picture quality for this collection is outstanding. 8 movies that are great out of 10 ain't too shabby. Definitely a good buy for those of you out there that LOVE sci-fi movies. I really enjoyed it myself and feel it is a good buy for my hard-earned buck.",1367280000,2,3158,4.788602941176471
