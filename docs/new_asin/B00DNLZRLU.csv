5836791,3,B00DNLZRLU,"Loved watching these movies on The Hallmark Channel so why I ordered them for my collection as well as them being a good price and was shipped very quickly too.  When I first opened them up there were some scratches and marks on all of the  discs.  So I wasn't very happy about that as they were secure in the holder they came in.  Then while watching ""The Most Wonderful Time of Year"", there were 4 times when there was nothing on the TV for a few seconds.  Thought that was odd as I never watched any movies with pauses or blank spaces in them and don't think that this is normal as I'm watching the movie after that one and so far this one hasn't done this.  Okay it paused and did it too!  Ugh, kind of annoying!  Not sure if I will be sending these back or not because of these odd glitches to get an exchange or a refund.    Somewhat disappointed and what's worse is that they're made in Mexico and don't recall seeing that either or any other reviews reporting this!  ",1495411200,2,975,4.205405405405405

5836796,5,B00DNLZRLU,"Wow, this is a truly outstanding collection of Hallmark Christmas movies! I had heard for years how great the Hallmark holiday flicks were as a whole and I believed everything I heard, but never really took a glance at them. I guess I was just never felt a great lack of Christmas movies in the past, already feeling so content with the various holiday 'classic' DVDs that kept me feeling festive all through the season. =)  However, this past Christmas, I found myself especially looking forward to seeing a couple of my newer ABC Family Xmas movies that I had recently added to my collection. Therefore, after reading some reviews, I decided it was time to place this 10-movie set on my Xmas list, especially since it came at such a great price on Amazon ($16.99 when added). It took me well into January to finish watching them all (since I received them as a Christmas gift), but I'm so pleased to report that to me, these movies were thoroughly enjoyable, each with their own special charm, and there wasn't a single dud in the entire set! I look forward to enjoying this collection each year!

I know that when I was looking through all of the different collection options as a newbie to the Hallmark Xmas Flick genre, I appreciated reading synopsis' of each film without having to visit the separate DVD pages, so here's my breakdown of the movie plots in case they're helpful to you. I recommend each movie and I tried to include just a few personal comments about each too.

Disc 1:
-The Most Wonderful Time of the Year-A single mother's simple approach to Christmas is rocked to its core when her uncle (Henry Winkler) brings home a passenger he met on the flight over to stay with them. She and her son, who's starting to doubt his belief in Santa Claus, are given new reasons to open their hearts and believe in the spirit of the season again in this sweet comedy.
-Moonlight Mistletoe-Candace Cameron Bure plays a daughter that grew weary of Christmas in her teens after working at her family's Christmas theme park for too long. She returns as an adult to help her widowed father save his business and encounters a lot of bumps along the way. Can she accept help from the right people and reconnect families to their long lost favorite Christmas destination using what little Christmas spirit she has left in her own heart?
-Holiday Engagement-After a sudden, unexpected breakup with her fiance, the main character desperately offers a free vacation to someone online who'd be willing to pretend to be her fiance for Christmas with her skeptical family. The actor she chooses to help her wants to use the free vacation to win back the heart of his ex-girlfriend, who cheated on him. Two broken hearts come together in friendship to get through their sad holidays together and when each are given the chance to have exactly what they want again...will their desires still be the same? I loved this one-well-written, comical, and heartfelt; it's definitely one of my favorites in the set.

Disc 2:
-An Old Fashioned Christmas-A spirited, aspiring writer travels to Ireland with her strong and affluent grandmother to meet her favorite poet and also in a secret attempt to meet her paternal grandparents. Partially held to the confines of the time and especially in her desire not to hurt her loved ones, she spends the holiday balancing her hopes and dreams for writing, family, and love, along with comically sparring wittily with her unruly, male housemate. One really great thing about this one is that there are two very different love interests and for quite awhile, I had no idea which way the story was going to go with its message about which man was best for her. Well done!
-Three Wise Women-Actually, this one is about one wise woman. A guardian angel has one chance to discreetly help an Irish girl to change some decisions that she's about to make in her 20s/30s (sparked by a heartbreaking event in her childhood, though you really can't tell that the decisions she's making are particularly bad ones) that ultimately leave her bitter and alone, using the judgement of her older and younger selves to guide her. I found this one to be thoroughly original, charming and funny, with an amazing and wise ending.
-Mrs. Santa Claus-A musical with the great, Angela Lansbury, Mrs. Claus goes out into the world to contribute to Christmas and regain some of her self-worth. Temporarily stranded in the mainland, she attempts to liberate a band of mistreated child workers in a toy shop. It's so funny, but I absolutely love the bad guy on this one too-he's really hilarious and awesome (not that I condone his behavior, mind you, the actor just did a great job with the part). ;)

Disc 3:
-A Christmas Kiss-An overworked interior design assistant shares a spontaneous and incredible kiss with a stranger after a frightening encounter on a broken elevator only to find that he's the boyfriend of her influential and demanding boss. When the time comes to assist in the designs of a Christmas party at his home, she challenges his misconceptions about what love truly is. This was another of my favorites, though I didn't imagine how I'd ever come around on his side of the predicament. :)
-A Boyfriend for Christmas-A little girl wishes Santa for a boyfriend for Christmas and he makes a special promise to her that when two hearts are ready, he will deliver on that gift (but that it might take 20+ years, which she is dismayed to hear). Now grown-up with a failed relationship behind her, can she start to believe again in Santa and that her Xmas wish from him could finally come true?
-Single Santa Seeks Mrs. Claus-The joyous son of Mr. and Mrs. Claus learns that he needs to find a wife in a hurry in order to inherit the family business. This one was fun and adorable (and different enough from 'The Santa Clause 2', though the premise sounds similar), plus it was so great to see Steve Guttenberg again!
-A Carol Christmas-After her aunt builds her up to be tough and look out for herself to succeed, a famous talk show host (Tori Spelling) has to re-learn the importance of doing good for others by re-examining her life 'Christmas Carol'-style. I was a little nervous about this one at first, but it managed to differentiate itself enough from the other adaptations of the story, it was filled with many nice moments, and it left a good feeling resonating after it was finished.",1490486400,3,6405,4.704991087344029

Trust me watching something that is ""Happy"" changes things!  This is a solid collection.  All of them are worth watching more than once.  They are family safe.  My personal favorite is ""The Most Wonderful Time of the Year"".  Do yourself a favor and buy this set.  You won't be sorry!

5837008,5,B00DNLZRLU,"I was very happy to find a copy of ""An Old Fashioned Christmas"" which could be played on an American DVD  player.  The quality of the DVD is excellent.  I'd seen this movie on TV and liked it very much.  It is a period movie that takes place in America and Ireland.  The scenery is delightful as are the costumes. Jacqueline Bisset is cast as the proper and cultured grandmother who would like her grandchildren to benefit from her cultered & wise ways.  That includes marrying well.  She asks her American grandaughter to accompany her to Ireland where she can learn something about her heritage.  The grandaughter, is already engaged to Gad, a well to do and very kind gentleman farmer from America.  The grandmother is delighted with this match.  Her grandaughter has some reservations.  Gad follows her to Ireland so he doesn't have to be separated from her at Christmas.  The grandmother is delighted but the grandaughter not so much.  An attractive and carefree Irish lad is trying to woo the grandaughter. He is soon to be an Earl.  His family is hosting the grandmother and grandaughter.  The grandaughter has a talent for writing which the present Earl encourages. The story continues with the grandaughters heart  in a quandry as to who she should be with.  She loves Gad but he isn't as exciting as the Irish lad.  The Irish lad flatters the grandaughter who thoroughly enjoys the flirtatious repartee between them.  His downful is he enjoys a pint or two or three on a regular basis down at the pub.  He also has an eye for the barmaids.  I don't want to spoil the ending but I will say it is a delightful movie, well acted, visually generous and not to be missed.",1463097600,3,1676,4.613559322033899

5837110,5,B00DNLZRLU,"I've seen all but one of these movies, half of them multiple times.  I like all of the ones I've seen so far, and can recommend them to anyone who likes a little variety in their holiday viewing for a very good price.  All of these movies are well-made and enjoyable.

They run a wide range from a Christmas celebrated in Victorian times (""An Old Fashioned Christmas"", which is a sequel to ""An Old Fashioned Thanksgiving"", which is also very good) to very modern romances set in the present day (""A Boyfriend for Christmas"", ""The Most Wonderful Time of the Year"" for example.  There is a modern retelling of Dickens' Christmas Carol (""A Carol Christmas""), a glimpse into the life of Santa's better half (Mrs. Santa Claus, a musical).  And more.

If you like Christmas movies, these ones are good family entertainment.",1451520000,2,817,4.71830985915493

This is the only reason I gave this 4 stars - because no subtitles or close caption.
