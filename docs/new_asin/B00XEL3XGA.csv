7167539,5,B00XEL3XGA,Fabulous and insightful looks into a great band,1439164800,,47,5.0
7167540,4,B00XEL3XGA,A very entertaining and informative history of the police as seen through the eyes of Andy. Would love to see a more all inclusive biography made someday.,1439078400,,154,4.7407407407407405
7167541,4,B00XEL3XGA,"This is a biopic of guitarist Andy Summers, personally and professionally, based on his memoir -- but also reviews the career of the Police in some detail. It features Andy's voice narrating and covers the period from his beginning as a teen musician through his 30s (the decade of the Police), and then a little bit after the band's sudden disbanding at the peak of fame. Also included is on-stage and behind-the-scenes footage from their 2007-08 reunion tour. For those offended by artfully-done nudity, be forewarned that Andy was an avid photographer during his days of touring.

It is an interesting view from the inside of rock stardom, but here are my reasons for deducting a star:
* It appeared there were no interviews done specifically for this film, although existing clips of interviews new and old were used.
* Andy's narration was somewhat monotone.
* While not a surprise, the focus on Sting was heavy and it would have been nice to have a little more discussion of drummer Stewart Copeland.
* The random cuts between the 1970s/80s and 2007-2008 could have used some on-screen labeling. While you could tell which is which, it would have been helpful to flash the date and location on clips to allow the viewer to easily keep up with what's happening. Location was often a mystery.

Certainly recommended for any devoted fan of Andy or the Police.",1438560000,2,1362,4.816239316239316
7167542,5,B00XEL3XGA,"Great movie, super rare footage, especially 83 synchronicity tour old.sox park;) good stuff, worth the rental for sure..police.in their prime 78 83...",1438214400,,150,5.863636363636363
7167543,4,B00XEL3XGA,"Andy seemed a bit drab and the narration might have been better by someone upbeat, the documentary gave me some inside looks at the boys back when.",1438214400,,147,4.481481481481482
7167544,3,B00XEL3XGA,"So many of these new ""documentaries"" and ""autobiographies"" are shells of what they could be. Based on Andy Summers' book, the entire DVD feels like a single chapter or two. So much information is missing! So much about Summers himself, let alone specific moments of the Police history. No real information on how anything happened. Everything is glossed over with little voice-overs and lots of unexplained photos. No depth at all. Made them all look like a bunch of brainless twits. Maybe that's what he was after.",1437955200,8,515,4.931034482758621
7167545,5,B00XEL3XGA,"My kids bought this for my birthday and it arrived yesterday! I love Andy's perspective and the footage used/edited in this documentary. After seeing the trailer and realizing that some of the RARE MTV footage from the Comiskey park show, I was at July 23rd, 1983 was included, I became excited! In fact, I can see where I was sitting :) I had the pleasure of meeting Andy on his THROB tour in 1983/84 and on his XYZ tour. The extras on the blu ray are wonderful! I have all of the documentaries on the band and love them all, but I have to say this is my favorite. I like how it keeps going between the reunion footage and back to the archival footage. It mixes well. I liked hearing the rehearsal of ""Murder by Numbers"" and some of the other musical tidbits. The karaoke footage of ""Every Breath You Take"" makes this film :)  This is a fresh look back at their career in what I feel, is the best way possible. It's based on Andy's book ONE TRAIN LATER and this film really delivers on his book and gives great insight to his life. Now, if THE POLICE could reunite privately and create a new album...it could inspire real musicians everywhere, without corporate involvement.",1436918400,13,1175,4.414746543778802
7167546,5,B00XEL3XGA,"This is a terrific documentary. lots of great concert footage.
Looks and sounds great.",1435190400,3,86,5.214285714285714
7167547,4,B00XEL3XGA,"I loved Andy's book, so a video was welcome.",1475366400,,44,4.0
7167548,5,B00XEL3XGA,Interesting documentary. Based on Andy Summers book.,1473552000,,52,6.571428571428571
7167549,3,B00XEL3XGA,OK MOVIE  MR.B,1468972800,,14,3.6666666666666665
7167550,4,B00XEL3XGA,If your a big fan of the Police you'll probably like this movie .If your not a big fan you might be less of one after  watching this movie ... I still love the Police...,1466208000,,169,3.8285714285714287
7167551,5,B00XEL3XGA,"Wow. This film took some guts to make. Andy's account of his experiences is quite touching, and the glimpses into his life, past and present fascinating.",1465776000,,153,4.923076923076923
7167552,5,B00XEL3XGA,Always worth the read!,1465689600,,22,4.75
7167553,3,B00XEL3XGA,"Fair. Timing and service was outstanding. I was hoping for a little bit more from the DVD.
Thank you.",1462838400,,101,4.368421052631579
7167554,5,B00XEL3XGA,"Good footage in this DVD, I don't think any rock & roll DVD will cover everything for everyone but if you are a fan you will enjoy it. I agree with previous reviewers that chronologically the clips don't match the timeline which is slightly annoying. I think the underlying theme was Andy was on the loose while touring with The Police evening though he was married with a young child, eventually losing them & then after the group broke up & time passed on he ended being back with his beautiful wife. I loved his book so the DVD is a visual attachment to it.",1461888000,,560,4.3428571428571425
7167555,1,B00XEL3XGA,Rubbish. It's just old clips mashed together in a different order. No real insight and no new footage. There is better footage on the Internet. Waste of money !!,1460419200,,161,4.586206896551724
7167556,5,B00XEL3XGA,"Andy Summers gives us an insightful and entertaining film about his background before The Police. (I didn't know he was in The Animals!) And gives a great summary of travels, performances, and struggles of The Police. I also enjoyed seeing his family included. It is a very enjoyable movie!",1456531200,,290,4.938775510204081
7167557,5,B00XEL3XGA,"A must have for fans of The Police. Loved the movie! Andy, Stewart & Sting RULE!!",1455235200,,81,4.125
7167558,5,B00XEL3XGA,A must watch if you like Sting and the Police,1454716800,,45,3.6
7167559,5,B00XEL3XGA,Very good documentary. A must see for fans of The Police or Andy Summers.,1453593600,,73,4.285714285714286
7167560,2,B00XEL3XGA,"Do yourself a favor and read Andy's book while you listen to the Police in the background.  All this video contains is Andy reading highlights from the book while some clumsily edited footage plays.  There's almost no new material here and Andy hardly ever speaks on camera.  This video is a waste of time unless you can't, or won't, read.",1453161600,4,339,4.616666666666666
7167561,5,B00XEL3XGA,"Great job Andy. Very honest and insightful. I was sad to see you and your wife were split up due to the obvious demands, but that you're together again, and such mini me's  in tow, it was a please to the final outcome, that you're back together. Once the music dies, there's family, friends, and memories, and you have that to be proud of. I became a lead singer in a band, a musician, a songwriter because of The Police, as I was the only kid in my group of friends at the time Roxanne came out,  who could hit the notes, ""Roxanne"". You three have a made a great impact on my life and I'm forever grateful. As this is somewhat of a more intimate look at your career, I soaked up every crack and crevasse. I saw The Police perform when I was a freshman at Arizona State. Thompson Twins and Madness were openers. It was a night I'll never forget. I soon was fronting my own band, belting out Message In a Bottle, So Lonely, Driven To Dears, and yes Roxanne at frat parties with my band. That was 1984. Come full circle to 2007, the year of your reunion tour, and there I am with my new Bride, front and center at Dodger Stadium, ever the loyal fan, screaming my head off once again to Roxanne....and as you pan the audience....there we are, front row....I guess being a loyal fan, one day you get your just due....needless to say Andy, it was a thrill to see your lovely documentary, as it basically took me through my whole musical journey as well..i.e. Your Documentary, double thumbs up!  Your Career, legendary! Seeing my wife and I front row at Dodger Stadium, priceless!
Thanks Brotha, job well done. Seeing your film was a timeline for my life, as file brought my journey with The Police all into focus and left me no doubt I wasn't blind...you guys will go down in history as one of the greats of all time.......Cheers!!",1452902400,,1827,4.351906158357771
7167562,4,B00XEL3XGA,"Probably a great film for hardcore Police fans. Better than average rock'n'roll doc. As a casual Police fan, I really liked the stuff with Police in the early days (live footage of performances and early MTV stuff), as well as the elements documenting the genesis of the band. The focus on Andy ""the quiet one"" Summers makes this perspective into the band dynamics interesting. But man, Sting sure comes off as an unlikeable character.",1452038400,,435,4.891891891891892
7167563,4,B00XEL3XGA,"This documentary gives an intimate look at rise and fall of this great band from Andy Summers' point of view, and how it effected his personal life as well. His perspective is an interesting one, because perhaps unlike the feelings of Sting and Stewart, if Andy had his way the Police would have never ended.",1451779200,,308,4.618181818181818
7167564,5,B00XEL3XGA,A very good look into what was the reunion of The Police. The tensions were not left in the past. At least Andy had a great time. Sting looked pained throughout!,1451088000,,161,4.225806451612903
7167565,4,B00XEL3XGA,"Too short! I get the feeling that Andy was trying not to step on too many toes. A smart move to leave the door open for future possibilities, but it doesn't get into the real dirt. Other than that, it's quality stuff without being catty.",1449446400,,237,4.288888888888889
7167566,5,B00XEL3XGA,Great honest history of the Police. Lots of old clips and pix wrapped into one cool blu ray.,1448928000,,92,4.166666666666667
7167567,5,B00XEL3XGA,Great buy !!!,1448409600,,13,3.6666666666666665
7167568,5,B00XEL3XGA,A must have for Police fans.  Contains great footage of both the past and their last tour.  Made me wish for another tour.,1447459200,,122,4.260869565217392
7167569,5,B00XEL3XGA,"If you are a Police fan, or a fan of musical documentaries, this is a must watch.  ""I Can't Stand Losing You"" is an intimate self portrait of guitarist Andy Summers, highlighting the very human personal struggles he faced in his long career in the music industry, and as 1/3 of The Police.  BE WARNED:  This documentary is NOT about ""The Police"" - it's about Andy and his own journey.  It's a personal story, of which The Police just happened to play a part.",1447286400,,458,4.416666666666667
7167570,5,B00XEL3XGA,"Excellent video, thanks, smooth transaction",1446422400,,43,7.8
7167571,1,B00XEL3XGA,"I love music most music documentaries/retrospectives...........but in this case I should have spent my time listening to the music, the ""story"" was all about egos, excesses and how the proper English lads got along,

It was sad to see and feel how much these guys genuinely dislike each other.  It made for uncomfortable watching....told from guitarist Summers point of view he was honest about his experience but that did not make for an engaging viewing experience.......

I watched until the end thinking ""this is has to get better soon"",  no such luck...........

That and the fact that while the story was mostly linear the ""DIRECTOR"" randomly interspersed old footage with newer footage bank and forth that was visually confusing....... It would have been better to see the old guys at the end and the young guys at the beginning.....they all aged very well but clearly still cannot stand each other...... do yourself a favor and listen to the music.............",1445817600,4,968,5.062893081761007
7167572,4,B00XEL3XGA,"Great documentary on Andy Summers and his history with the Police.  Selfishly as a guitar player I wanted more ""guitar"" content but the other material carried the movie",1444867200,,168,5.0
7167573,4,B00XEL3XGA,"I had already read ""One Train Later"" so I was partially prepared for what was covered on the DVD.  I was actually hoping he would expand more into the topic of The Police and the reunion tour.  It was nice to see his perspective towards the band but it felt limited, like it only covered a chapter or two and not the full history of the band.  It's just to quick and each album/tour is quickly glossed over.  I still give it a 4 because I am a huge Police fan and really appreciate Andy's work as a musician.",1444348800,2,508,4.101010101010101
7167574,4,B00XEL3XGA,"Actually, I have but a brief mildlty laudatory comment to make. Can't Stand Losing You will appeal to Police fans. They should see it. The documentary will not overstay its stay at 1h 23m. The informational journey is somewhat to very interesting throughout.",1444176000,,258,5.023255813953488

7167579,5,B00XEL3XGA,"Well done, well worth watching and provides a different perspective (andy Summers) on the history that some of us think we know. Take a look, you won't be disappointed.",1442620800,,168,4.827586206896552
7167580,5,B00XEL3XGA,Great DVD and wouldn't hesitate to order with them again,1441411200,,56,4.7
7167581,5,B00XEL3XGA,"Another engaging film with more behind the scenes footage of my favourite band.  Spoiler Alert: the bummer being that the film begins with an ending.  It compliments Stewart Copeland's ""Everyone Stares"" perfectly ... but I won't hold my breath waiting for Sting's chapter in what would make a perfect trilogy for this self-confessed Police tragic ;)",1440892800,,349,5.214285714285714
7167582,5,B00XEL3XGA,"just what I expected, thank you",1440374400,,31,4.333333333333333

7167584,5,B00XEL3XGA,Aw,1440201600,,2,2.0
7167585,5,B00XEL3XGA,"This is a fantastic documentary of Andy Summers life and involvement with the Police. Some of the most interesting parts of the film are actually Andy Summers photographs especially from the days before he was in the Police. Even long time collectors of Police video and music will find things in this documentary they have never seen before. There is great video of the Police's New Years Eve Concert at Wembley Arena on the Synchronicity Tour as well as video from the opening show of the Synchronicity Tour at Chicago's Comisky Park on July 23, 1983! There are interesting never before seen interviews and Andy Summers makes some comments about the recording of the Synchronicity album that I had never heard before. Every Police fan should have a copy!",1439942400,2,756,4.868217054263566
7167586,5,B00XEL3XGA,"Duh, it's the Police, through Andy's eyes. If you're a collector, it's a must have.",1439510400,,83,4.6
8715817,5,B00XEL3XGA,"I liked Sting's bass playing, and the Synchronicity album when it came out, but other than that, I have never been into The Police that much.  That said, this is a really good flick.  I like Andy Summers' storytelling.  Even if you are not a fan, it's worth watching if you are into music docs.",1533945600,,294,4.3090909090909095

8715820,5,B00XEL3XGA,"I have been a fan of The Police since my teen years and was bummed when they broke up. After purchasing Stewart Copeland's documentary (another very good documentary) about the group it was nice to see Andy's perspective, history and life outside of the band. Andy was an inspiration to me growing up with his cool take on guitar playing. Great to be able to have seen the band back in the 80's as a teen, screaming my head off to get a quick wave from Andy. Who knew there was so much going on behind the scenes.",1504310400,,513,4.244897959183674
8715821,4,B00XEL3XGA,"I so remember remember riding my blue schwinn 3-speed to middle school whilst humming Roxanne.  It was the late 70's.  I remember my sisters 'weird' friend with a Police concert shirt 'zenyatamedatta' and 'outlandosdaimoure'. I was a sophomore.  I remember purchasing the 'ghost in the machine' cassette from cactus records and playing over and over on my Sanyo component deck as it played though my ECI 3-way speakers.  I remember watching the Syncronicity tour in the Houston Summit (now Joel Olsteen's Lakewood Church) and having crummy seats on the lower level behind the mixing board... and having an incredible time.  I remember buying the reunion tour concert tickets from the Best Buy website and showing them off to my co-workers whist they gleam with envy!  I remember that concert - great seats - lower deck, 2-rows up, 70 ft from the stage.  The Police was and continues to be a soundtrack to (a portion of) my life.
I watch this on Netflix DVD - most of the info presents the well known facts; the ego three-some; the dysfunctional trifecta; and the well-self-centeredness of an incredible artist, Sting.  I liked this documentary due to the odd, less understood, perspective from Andy Summers.  Most of what we know from the Police is (of course) Sting... and Stewart Copeland a distant second.  But Andy is never the centerpiece - until this film.  The back history of Andy, his rise in the rock-scene and his collaboration with the 2-members.  It was a very interesting piece.  The only dislike, which prevents the 5-star tag, is the editing.  Although presented linearly, as most documentary would have it, the shots keep going to/fro the 2007-2008 tour along with Andy's narration - at time was a bit off and confusing. Was he talking about the past or the current present - the reunion tour.  Besides that - it's worth watch if your curious rock music fan.  It's must for Police fans.  Enjoy!",1501286400,,1911,4.848765432098766
8715822,3,B00XEL3XGA,"Being that I am a huge fan of rock-docs, the Police, and especially Andy Summers, this should have been a slam dunk for me.  It did have a nice bunch of clips and photos from yesteryear, but my main complaint about the movie would be the splicing in of newer footage from their reunion tour in with Summers telling his story.  This was terribly disruptive to the flow of Summer's narrative.  Save that for the end or put it at the beginning, but not in between a chronological retelling of his life.  (Yes, I got that most of the songs stayed with the theme of what he was talking about, but I would have appreciated older, rarer clips of the same song if they insisted on putting in a song to represent each period in his life.)  Also, in general I would have loved to see more old footage, not the newer tour - you can find that anywhere online.  So, pretty interesting information (even though very little was new to me being that I have followed Summers for over 35 years), but unfortunately it was not laid out well and the gratuitous newer concert footage put a damper on what could have been a much better rock-doc.",1499212800,,1122,4.3701923076923075
