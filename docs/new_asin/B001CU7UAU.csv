8289425,5,B001CU7UAU,I am an Environmental Science teacher.  I am always trying to find ways to engage my students to the the material I am lecturing about. This video is for season 10 Ep 53 of Modern Marvels.  It is an excellent source for reviewing the impacts of humans are having on the planets oceans.  It covers quite clearly all of the types of fishing methods and how quickly we are depleting the worlds fish supply.  This is 45 minutes long which is the fits perfectly into one classroom period.  There is almost no filler here and is a very effective way to cover the fishing industry in a short amount of time.  I highly recommend it!,1478044800,,624,4.3826086956521735
8289426,1,B001CU7UAU,The video I ordered has a run time of 100 minutes. The one I received is for 50 minutes. It was not the documentary I was expecting.,1390176000,,132,3.925925925925926
