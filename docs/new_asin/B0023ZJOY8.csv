8350171,3,B0023ZJOY8,"Got this 2006 concert DVD with high hopes, but ultimately let down. The set runs under one hour, and while the song selections are good, the venue/stage is so small that you can't help but feel the band was restrained. The picture quality is poor, and there is a TV ROCK icon in the lower portion of the screen which takes up so much space it becomes annoying very quickly. Their best live DVD is still the SLANE CASTLE show. Back cover has a picture of Dave Navarro, but John Frusciante is the guitarist. Cover also lists SEX RAP in set list, but it's not included.

SET LIST:

CAN'T STOP
CHARLIE
SCAR TISSUE
TELL ME BABY
ME AND MY FRIENDS
HOW DEEP IS YOUR LOVE
