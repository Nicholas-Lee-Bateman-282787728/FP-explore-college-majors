There are a few wheelies in one section of the film but they're not spectacular like the wheelie pros are capable of by a long shot ( guys like LVX or the StarBoyz ) . It is a nicely shot well put together video of your more every day local sportbike riders have'in fun , a sportbike riders lifestyle film is how i'd describe it. Also it has realy great sound track of little known bands that compliment the action perfectly....I'm actualy as much or more of a fan of the sound track as i am the rest of the film.
Please give this video a chance ....sit down and realy watch it ...watch it a couple of times ! ...Maybe it'll get under your skin like it did mine .",1196467200,,713,4.028169014084507
8458235,1,B000050934,"I went to the exitlight website and viewed the 2 trailers. WOW! Lots of wheelies and tricks. This made me want to see more, so I bought this video. Little did I know, the trailers  I saw were for 'Las Vegas Extremes' NOT for 'Open Throttle'. Do not make this mistake. Skip this video. It is a wet noodle. Jump right to Las Vegas Extremes.",981849600,,338,4.2
8458236,1,B000050934,"I just wasted $15 on this video. This is the worst amateur video ever...The Blair Witch Project of sport bike riding. It makes a feeble attempt to showcases sport bike riding, but instead focuses on the antics of a group that would give any sport a bad name. It reminds me of the videos my 16-year-old shoots of himself and his friends on in-line skates. Skip it.",978480000,,363,4.432835820895522
8458237,4,B000050934,"As a motorcycle rider for over 37 years, I like the Open Throttle video!  It is the first video I have seen that shows what really goes on in the sport bike riding world on a nice weekend in the Pacific Northwest.  Yes, I know that passing on a double yellow line, doing something in excess of 3 times the posted speed limit, pulling wheelies and a lot of other things shown in this movie are against the law on public roads and you and I may never do that.  However, this video shows riders having FUN with their sport bikes and their friends while doing some rather extreme riding.  Yes, there is a rather severe price to be paid for screwing up, as also shown in this video, but you have to admire those who are good enough and lucky enough to get away with it.
I know I am keeping this video on the shelf close to my VCR for those times when I need to get a quick reminder of those good feelings I get riding my sportbike with my friends.  Watching this video always gives me those goose bumps and puts a smile on my face.",972000000,6,1026,4.11
