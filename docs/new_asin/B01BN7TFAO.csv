8750813,5,B01BN7TFAO,"Part travel guide, part history lesson, part Fourth Way concepts teasers, this DVD offering from William Patrick Patterson comes off as something between an invitation and a direction to go on an actual embodied journey to the burial site of Gurdjieffs father in Armenia. He makes his case not only by sharing footage and impressions from his own 21 day pilgrimage but also by showing us many of the brilliant and highly regarded people who studied with Gurdjieff, and building up our appreciation and sense of indebtedness for not only Gurdjieff, but also his father.  We come to revere his father as a wise and honorable progenitor who set conditions that helped create and influence him. The pilgrim sees things vividly, taking note of old carvings, symbols, noticeable coincidences, opportunities to engage with and learn from people he meets along the way.  There are some very moving scenes such as Gurdjieffs funeral and in the ruins of an ancient cathedral that predated the Gothic that seemed to set my body vibrating with hauntingly beautiful music and heartfelt reverence. I agree with one of the earlier reviewers who suggests that this is a film worth seeing again. My experience was that it improved with repetition and became even more evocative.",1467936000,,1261,5.028708133971292
8750814,5,B01BN7TFAO,"Spiritual Pilgrimage: Mr. Gurdjieff's Father's Grave is the most moving, heartfelt film I've seen recently. It traces the life and travels of the spiritual teacher G.I. Gurdjieff through France, Turkey, Georgia and Armenia. I would recommend it for everyone, from those who have no exposure to Mr. Gurdjieff to those who are involved in the Teaching he brought. I've studied Mr. Gurdjieff's Teaching for years and this film opened me to many questions and perspectives I had never considered. There were many moments in the film when the combination of Gurdjieff's piano music, and the images and ideas presented left me in tears.",1465516800,,630,5.12621359223301
8750815,5,B01BN7TFAO,"Patterson understood Gurdjieffs request in ""Meetings with Remarkable Men"" that to journey to his fathers grave was to fulfill a sacred obligation. He honored that request, filming the pilgrimage with the wish of inspiring Gurdjieffs sons and daughters in spirit, to seek outthis solitary grave, to make the pilgrimage.  Pattersons wholehearted dedication to Gurdjieffs Teaching lifts the heart. Hes given us many books and films in his unstinting efforts at making the Teaching known to those with a spiritual hunger, and who wish to overcome what it is in each of us that prevents the development of authentic essence. This film is a clear and stirring call.",1462320000,2,659,5.158878504672897
8750816,5,B01BN7TFAO,"The latest Gurdjieff Legacy video takes us on a reverse journey of Mr. Gurdjieffs travels, that is, from West to East. William Patrick Patterson makes this journey as a spiritual pilgrimage to the man who brought the Fourth Way teaching to the West and the man who brought into the world the man who brought the teaching to the West, Gurdjieffs father. Compelled by a wish from Gurdjieff that his children, both blood and of the spirit, visit his [Gurdjieffs] fathers grave, Patterson accepts this calling. In fulfilling it, he retraces parts of Gurdjieffs life and gives some aspects of the Fourth Way teaching as he makes his three-week journey beginning in France, ending in Armenia at the fathers grave, with stops in Turkey and Georgia. For Patterson this is a sincere and heartfelt journey, and the video presents very interesting material regarding the Teaching, Gurdjieffs life, his students as well as general historical information about the areas visited, often put into a spiritual perspective. At times there is a touch of travelogue lightness, but in the context of a Fourth Way Pilgrimage, this seems quite appropriate as Gurdjieff certainly was a man who enjoyed ordinary life and used ordinary life to come to real life. This is indeed a unique and well-crafted Fourth Way offering; and when you buy it, watch it more than onceits impact grows.",1457308800,2,1361,4.973684210526316
8750817,5,B01BN7TFAO,"So vividly is Gurdjieff's life from death in Paris to birth in Armenia retraced that I felt at times I was reliving it, too. Especially the time spent in Ani, the ancient Armenian Capitol and site where Gurdjieff first discovered mention of the Sarmoung Brotherhood. The depiction of the ruins and even the vivifying duduk music used in this scene readily communicates something deep about the soul-ful existence of this ancient Christian center. Once again, Patterson displays his deftness at communicating on multiple levels, especially to those who have ""ears"".

Of course, the apotheosis of the journey is the actual visit to Mr. Gurdjieff's Father's grave in Gyumri. Here the journey takes on the full significance of fulfilling a sacred obligation; though the plaque with the requested prayer has already been laid, the grave has suffered the effects of the passing of time, and many more ""sons"" and ""daughters"" will be needed to maintain it in a state of sacred reverence.

A fitting culmination to the earlier trilogy The Life and Significance of George Ivanovitch Gurdjieff, this latest film reveals many new impressions and glimpses into the extraordinary beginnings of a truly Remarkable Man.",1456444800,2,1203,5.195876288659794
8750818,4,B01BN7TFAO,"Spiritual Pilgrimage: Mr. Gurdjieffs Fathers Grave, is a new documentary by William Patrick Patterson. Shot on location, the film tracks G.I. Gurdjieffs life backward. The film features Gurdjieffs establishment of The Institute for the Harmonious Development of Man, known as the  Prieur in Avon, France and Gurdjieff's nearby grave. We travel to  Kumbaraci and Yemenici streets in Istanbul, where Gurdjieff and his students lived; Prinkipo Island on the Sea of Marmara, where Gurdjieff often visited P. D. Uspenskii and on to Tiflis, where Gurdjieff opened his Institute at 22 Nikolas Street and first named it the Institute for the Harmonious Development of Man.
Continuing to time travel, Patterson tours Kars, Gurdjieff's home in the medieval quarter and the Kars Military Cathedral where he sang in the choir. Patterson shows us Ani, the ancient city where the Sarmoung manuscript was discovered and visits the Sanahin Monastery, Armenia, where Gurdjieff served as an acolyte. At last we arrive in Gyumri, Armenia, where Gurdjieff was born in the Greek Quarter at 222 Matnishyan Street. The 21-day pilgrimage reaches Gyumri's Old Cemetery and we with Patterson, discover Mr. Gurdjieff's father's grave.
 Of note, Gurdjeiffs father was slain defending his home from invading Turks. All other family members where safely traveling with Gurdjieff, considered one of the preeminent spiritual leaders of the 20th Century.
Readers of  Gurdjieffs book, Meetings With Remarkable Men, may recall that the first chapter following the introduction is simply titled My Fatherwho  was known throughout Transcaucasia as Ashokh Adash, a bard and poet. Gurdjieff closes the 18-page chapter on his father with this injunction: Owing to the circumstances of my life not dependent on me, I have not personally seen the grave where the body of my dear father lies, and it is unlikely that I will ever be able, in the future, to visit his grave. I therefore, in concluding this chapter devoted to my father, bid any of my sons, whether by blood or in spirit, to seek out, when he has the possibility, this solitary grave, abandoned by force of circumstances ensuing chiefly from that human scourge called the herd instinct and there set up a stone

According to Patterson, he first read these words 50-years ago and has read and studied it countless times since. However, reading it more recently he said Gurdjieffs admonition resonated deeply and I knew I was being called to seek out his fathers grave, to make a pilgrimage. And this reviewer is grateful he did. The Armenian landscape is as mythic as the effort Patterson made to get the details right in this thoughtful richly shot documentary. William Patrick Patterson truly is one of Gurdjieffs spiritual sons.",1456444800,3,2751,5.170786516853933
