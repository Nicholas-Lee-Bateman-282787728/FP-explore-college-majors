Globe Trekker seems to go out of its way to find fun young people to act as its hosts. Zoe Palmer is no exception. Even in the midst of a downpour, she never loses her sunny smile.

After watching this video, we concluded that we had no interest in visiting these particular islands in the Caribbean, but we found it quite interesting, particularly the segments dealing with volcanoes (the area has had some spectacular volcanic eruptions, one emitting several times the power of the atomic bomb dropped at Hiroshima).

All in all, a pleasant way to spend an evening.

NOTE: The one Globe Trekker host I found to be offensive was Justine Shapiro. I routinely avoid her programs.",1359676800,,680,4.697478991596639
