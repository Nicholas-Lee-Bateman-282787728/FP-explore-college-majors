8248685,5,B0012ZLYVG,"His Last Bow is a playful adaptation of Sherlock Holmes which has fun with the turn of the century inventions.  Mycroft's office is abuzz with sounds of beeping and ringing.  In my mind, Vitaliy Solomin is the very best Watson.  What a feat of acting just lighting a cigar, and his past scenes fearlessly consuming a meal.  He is appealingly subtle and warm, and brings a very human dimension to the role.  The Russian sets are intriguing -- not necessarily perfect reproductions of the British, but lovely, elegant homes and backdrops have been incorporated.  The camera work is superb and the subtitles work well enough.  This is overall delicious, essentially a comedy with wonderful music.  To possess the entire series is a joy.",1507939200,,733,4.902439024390244
