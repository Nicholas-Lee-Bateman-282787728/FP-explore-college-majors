8091289,3,B000BR9S2S,Fun got a bit boring at times but still it was fun.,1417478400,,51,3.3333333333333335
8091290,5,B000BR9S2S,"Philly, star of ""Once and Future Queen"", blazes her way into your mind and heart as flaming red-haired post-punk Diva Anti-Matter. Her performance will make you laugh, break your heart, and even feel anger at times towards her character. Inventively directed by Todd Verow and written/produced by Philly, James Derek Dwyer, and Verow, (costumes by Philly & Verow) this film is a powerful experience - for it's humor, drama, and colorful characters. Philly is completely her own person; absolutely unique.

This movie from 2000 is shot and edited digitally, like the majority of Verow's movies. It does not have the soft look of celluloid, nor the grainy look of video. Shot mostly with available light, the visuals are sharp and clear, the colors vivid. Please note ""Once and Future Queen"" is unrated, and was not made with the Mega-plex or most cable tv in mind. It is a document of a woman beyond the edge. For those who'd like to know or others who need to be ""warned"" (?!), Philly shows some above-the-waist nudity, one male character shows maybe a total of 7 seconds of frontal nudity, and another male in a semi-dark bedroom, lies asleep facing the camera, with about 10-15 seconds of dimly-lit frontal.

Philly's character, Anti-Matter, is the vocalist front-woman of a punk-funk-no-wave, (or other, you decide) group named Eager Meat (love that name!). Jose A. Valdez has written online that Eager Meat's music is ""pop music from hell"" - as their guitarist, he should know. The actors playing Eager Meat are also musicians: Jose A. Valdez - lead guitar, Rich Fowler - bass, Bill Dwyer - drums. They play a few complete songs which are full of anarcho-energy and very enjoyable - some clips can be seen online. Anti-Matter's flaming orange-red hair and stage attire go right along with her more-than-ample bosom (see the cover). As Anti-Matter, Philly shouts / screams / sings her lyrics, which are both personal and confrontational. The main male eye-candy is Bill Dwyer, drummer for Eager Meat. Not just man-candy, he's a fine actor who also plays in other fascinating Todd Verow films such as A Sudden Loss of Gravity, and Shucking the Curve, both also including Philly.

Two other wonderful actors who are Verow regulars of this period are handsome Eric Sapp (against) and beautiful Brenda Velez (The Final Girl). In a darkly hilarious scene, the consistently drunk and/or high Anti-Matter is a substance-abuse program ""sponsor"" to Eric Sapp's character, Aaron. Aaron calls Anti-Matter for support, as he is tempted to drink. Anti-Matter arrives on the scene and - well, wait and see. Brenda Velez plays Anti-Matter's well-intentioned therapist (good luck!). Jennifer Blowdryer as Jennifer, and ""Nick"" as Gladys both briefly play hosts to homeless Anti-Matter, who steals cash, the contents of their medicine cabinets, and (hilariously) anything else she can carry away. Also in the cast are Sara Blasi (photographer), Jonathan Gerstad (John), Kid Congo Powers (Joe), Tia Sprocket (Stella), Dave Vulcan (Death Nurse), and Lee Whittier (Slimeboy).

As good as the supporting cast is, this is definitely Philly's showcase. Her voice-overs describe experiences of sexual and psychological abuse. Anti-Matter sleeps with several men and women, sometimes for attention, sometimes for a fleeting sense of security, and other times just to have a place to bathe and to sleep. There is a tragi-comic scene in a laundromat where Anti-Matter strips to the bare necessities as she washes and dries the rest of her very meager wardrobe. Another good scene that blurs the line between film and reality is when Anti-Matter's 3rd ex-husband visits to deliver some funding. Ignoring ex-hubby, Anti-Matter/Philly declares that this documentary was being made with his money.

If you like different, experimental film and outrageous characters and situations, and you don't need twelve more years of critical acclaim and film-fest showings to convince you, grab this DVD while you can. Extras include the trailer and a ""making of"" feature. If you're really REALLY excited about the latest multi-million-dollar CGI-3D animated Hollywood flick being advertised everywhere, well maybe get ""Once and Future Queen"" anyway and expand your film horizon!

""Once and Future Queen"" is also included in the Verow boxed set Trilogy of Addiction: A Sudden Loss of Gravity/Once and Future Queen/Little Shots of Happiness, which oddly, Amazon does not include in their Verow section.

This is really a very talented group of people. Philly also stars in Verow's Take Away, has major roles in XX: Where The Heart Should Be, ex-votos, and at least 8 other Verow films. She has also appeared in films by Mike Kuchar, Sean Durr, Xan Price, and Ned Ambler. Both Eric Sapp and Brenda Velez have each appeared in about 7 other Verow films. Jose A. Valdez and Rich Fowler were also in the '90s punk rock band Who Killed Bambi? Bill Dwyer now fronts the Boston-based, aptly-named Bill Dwyer Band, who have many online clips. James Derek Dwyer has co-authored 13 Verow films and written music for 7. His soundtrack for Verow's Anonymous - DVD is available online. Dwyer also wrote the novel The Boy With The Sun In His Eyes, on which Verow's film of the same name is based.",1322524800,,5241,5.080139372822299

Definitely see the DVD extras in ""Behind the Scenes"".  It includes a portion of CBS' ""48 Hours""'s report on Verow and this film, footage from a Time Magazine photo shoot, 30 seconds of Eager Meat's 'Fetus' video, the cast on the road promoting the film, and a touching look at Philly visiting her childhood home.

8091292,1,B000BR9S2S,"This movie seems to have no point. It follows around a character called Antimatter that lives in the gutter and between drinking, drugging, and playing in her band she manages to find people to sleep with and steal from. Really not amusing or entertaining in the slightest. Available on Netflix if you really feel the need to torture yourself but you'll never get that hour plus back. Also be prepared for full frontal nudity.",1298678400,3,426,4.77027027027027
