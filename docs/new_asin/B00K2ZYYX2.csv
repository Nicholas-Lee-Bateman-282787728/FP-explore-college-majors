6401709,5,B00K2ZYYX2,"Great film! Being from Clearwater, I was able to recognize some of the places they were filming at. It's a comical movie that does well showcasing a pawnshop's crazy moments. The acting was great and it was just an overall fun movie to watch.",1408060800,,242,4.5227272727272725
6401710,5,B00K2ZYYX2,This movie is very well written. The music is spot on and up to date. The actors are all very professional and easy on the eyes. I laughed all the way through.  I am looking forward to the next N-take and Inspiration film collaberation.,1408060800,,236,4.363636363636363
6401711,5,B00K2ZYYX2,"First off lets be honest, if you are going into this film expecting an Oscar winner you have come to the wrong place. But if you want a light hearted movie with lots of laughs then you are in the right place.

This film was well put together and the cast was very funny. The video quality and sound is awesome! if you watch indie films as much as I do then you know how bad the quality can be, this film really surprised and just looks and sounds fantastic. The acting was great as well! Lauren leech was very enjoyable (why isn't she in more films lol?). Jay did a great Job telling customers what I feel we all really want to say.

All in all I highly recommend this movie if you want to laugh!",1406246400,2,696,4.072992700729927

8655487,5,B00K2ZYYX2,"I like the fact that this movie has frames that move. Its pretty cool. You have actors, you have sets, you might of had a script and of course you have that sweet sweet trailer for refreshments available for you. When I was on set filming this movie I couldn't stop thinking about the beauty of the camera its self, so sweet lusheous and alluring to my eyes.
I fret that would be the last time I saw the camera though, and It was really the last time I could have some sort of sense of self, as life went on the days kept drifting further and further from me. One day I'm buying and oven, the next day I'm buying a stove, finally settling on a dryer and wondering why I cant get any further in life. Its not the globalists like my mom tells me. My sweet sweet young boy father tells me that globalisation is just a product of a vast technological growth for all of gods children.
I weep into the chest of a dragon
I wonder who can I be, what will I be
When will I find the truth. Please
sow my seeds I cast to you into the earth brains of all the young ones
let my butter grease the grill of life, and let my mind crumble away for thoughts of a better day only bring me hope of and impossible escape.

8655488,1,B00K2ZYYX2,"Should be a zero star class for this stinker, The writing, plot, acting, characters and any thing else about this movie stinks, It was stupid, and not one laugh. There are several reviews saying this was a good movie, I can tell that they are insiders trying to boast this up. probably from some of the bad actors in it. The name should be changed from ""Pawnz"" to ""Poopz""",1472860800,,371,4.391304347826087
