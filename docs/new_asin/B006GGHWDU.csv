8497537,5,B006GGHWDU,Wonderful show! Extremely interesting.,1444608000,,38,8.75
8497538,5,B006GGHWDU,"Whether you agree with him or not, Buckley and Firing Line are great viewing.

Highly recommended.",1438992000,,98,5.125
8497539,5,B006GGHWDU,Another gem from Firing Line.  It is sad that no one has yet to fill the void left by Buckly's Firing Line. Dr. Hayek is one of the most influential people in the political-economic area.  A must see for all business students and interested parties.,1438300800,,249,4.511111111111111
8497540,5,B006GGHWDU,"This is the great Hayek at age 78 still brilliantly articulating his ideas and responding, sharp as a tack, to Buckley's nimble questioning.  Buckley is quite a good devil's advocate here, asking Hayek the difficult questions from a perspective that probably isn't native or natural to Buckley.  Wonderful program.  Why is Roche here?  No idea.",1390003200,,344,5.2
8497541,5,B006GGHWDU,Bill Buckley was the best at participating in and moderating highbrow debates.  Where are these types of in depth discussions today?  There is a reason that Firing Line was on the air for so long.  It was consistently wonderful.  I miss it and him greatly.,1371168000,9,256,4.622222222222222
8497542,5,B006GGHWDU,"Go get 'em Bill.  He is the very definition or erudition.  I now own more than a dozen individual episodes and will, no doubt, purchase more.",1369872000,2,141,4.384615384615385
8497543,5,B006GGHWDU,"I almost fell off my chair when around minute 13 Hayek started discussing JMK's theories and the fallacy of the so called general theory that rules the world of economics till our times! This is a must watch for anyone who has ever had any doubts about Keynesianists' theories - Hayek bursts their bubble very eloquently indeed. Must see, highly recommended to any PhD student/professor of Economics or in general anyone interested in the true underpinnings of economics as practiced by our central planners.",1357257600,4,508,5.059523809523809
8497544,5,B006GGHWDU,"Hayek spells out his views of business cycles, inflation, unemployment insurance, the minimum wage, and the 'safety net' in an excellent conversation with Bill Buckley.",1348272000,6,168,5.76
8497545,4,B006GGHWDU,"Hayek was a genius, and it is worth the less than ideal audio (a problem, given his accent) to get to hear him.  George Roche, here a young man who hadn't yet been driven into seclusion because of the scandals at Hillsdale College, is OK, but is so out-classed by Hayek that it is mildly embarrassing for him.",1333843200,,309,4.327586206896552
8497546,5,B006GGHWDU,"Everyone needs to buy this show.  Among other interesting things, Hayek explains why Keynesianism swept the world:

Hayek:  ""You see, another political element was that, of course, politicians just lapped the argument and Keynes taught them if you outspend your income and run a deficit, you are doing good to the people in general.  The politicians didn't want to hear anything more than that -- to be told that irresponsible spending was a beneficial thing and that's how the thing became so influential.""

Both the video and audio quality are excellent. Buy it now.",1331769600,9,568,5.0
