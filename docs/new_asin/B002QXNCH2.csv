8378103,5,B002QXNCH2,We found this DVD to be very insightful and informative. The narration was great. It has convinced us to visit Vancouver in the very near future.,1267920000,,145,4.615384615384615
8378104,5,B002QXNCH2,"The DVD on Vancouver and Victoria was educational, informative and entertaining-the perfect trifecta when it comes to travel guides.  As a student of history, I really enjoyed the historical background that was presented.  It added depth to the presentation.  The sites of Vancouver and Whistler were laid out in a fashion that will fit well with my planning.  As a parent of two children, I found many activities and sites that can be enjoyed by our entire family-at the same time, I got a good idea of the things that may be a little dry for the short attention-spans of our kids.  Having a Canadian narrator was a nice touch as well.  Hearing ""Sothe"" instead of ""South"" gave the DVD more credibility.  Production values were such that the story moved along at a brisk pace, yet not an information overload.  I look forward to GCG's future productions!",1264896000,3,854,4.761904761904762
