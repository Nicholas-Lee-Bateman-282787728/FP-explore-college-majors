3791601,5,B001TKNWV4,"I am currently receiving Hercepton for HR2+ breast cancer. I had no idea how important the IV medication is until I saw this movie. I believe it should be watched by everyone receiving Hercepton and their families and love ones. Harry Connick, Jr. was great as were the women in the movie. My friend said she cried when she watched it with her daughter. I cried and cried, for about a half hour after the movie was over, because for the first time I realized how lucky and blessed I am to live in a time when this medication is available. This is not fiction. It is a dramatization of real events. It also makes you aware of how important medication trials are and how brave the participants are. I purchased 3 copies to be certain all my loved ones watched.",1252022400,26,758,4.382978723404255
3791602,5,B001TKNWV4,"This movie was wonderful.  It is especially poignant for those of us who are HER 2 positive because many of us would not be alive today without the the tremendous research and tenacity of the scientists involved in the creation of Herceptin.  Although it took a lot of work to convince Genentech, it certainly put them in a better light in that they finally did take a chance on Herceptin.

3791603,5,B001TKNWV4,Interesting and well acted from beginning to end. Uplifting story! So glad to have this DVD in my collection.,1250294400,2,109,4.7894736842105265
3791604,5,B001TKNWV4,"To clarify some assertions made above:

1) Herceptin (trastuzumab) works on the sub-type of breast cancer tested and shown to be ""HER2 positive"", NOT ""anyone with Stage 4 breast cancer"".  A person can be Stage 4 but not HER2 positive.

2) And then within that group who have HER2 positive breast cancer, Herceptin doesn't work on everyone, or in some cases, it works but over time it stops working for unknown reasons.

3)  If you think the U.S. federal government would research, develop, test on patients, and get such a novel drug approved faster and better than private industry, think again . . recall how fast, efficient, caring and ""cost effective"" Amtrak, the U.S. Postal Service and the Veterans' hospital/clinic systems are . . . and then read this article in The Atlantic, March 2009 issue:  ""My Drug Problem"" by Virginia Postrel:

3791605,5,B001TKNWV4,The movie is moving especially if you or someone you know is affected by breast cancer.  Service from this vendor was excellent.  Quick turnaround time.,1244073600,2,152,5.04
3791606,4,B001TKNWV4,"This Lifetime made-for-TV movie is well worth seeing for those who know anyone with stage 4 breast cancer.  While the story focuses mostly on the impressive persistence and commitment of Dr. Dennis Slamon to get Food & Drug Administration approval for Herceptin, a revolutionary treatment for stage 4 breast cancer, this tele-drama manages to pack a strong emotional ""punch"".

The movie portrays the life and/or death plight of the women who undergo Her-2 treatment (short-hand name for the drug), and that's where the story packs its emotional wallop.  The accomplished & little known actresses playing these women (Bernadette Peters, Regina King, Amanda Bynes, among others) bring to life the heartbreaking issues that late stage breast cancer victims experience, and those who were included in Dr. Slamon's research.

The angst of the patients and their families is intensified in the movie by 2 factors .  Genentech, the drug company that initially funds Dr. Slamon's work, can't seem to sustain their support for his research.  The internal friction among their Board members delays Dr. Slamon's progress, and, thus, exacerbates the emotional turmoil for cancer victims and their loved ones.  Added to that are the constraints that the FDA trials placed on the availability of the HER-2 drug to women who might have benefitted from the treatment but who were excluded to maintain the integrity of the scientific trials and results.

Those who minimize the dramatic value of made-for-TV productions might give this one a try because of the social importance of the subject matter.

I highly recommend LIVING PROOF.",1243555200,29,1618,5.264591439688716
3791607,5,B001TKNWV4,"I saw ""Living Proof"" when it was first shown on Lifetime cable and found it a good portrayal of what reseachers have to go through to get funding for their research.  I admire the brave women who at the final stages of their cancer were willing to trust the doctor and give themselves to be in his trial program.  As I had just been diagnosed with stage 4 breast cancer, I found this movie full of hope instead of despair at my condition and thank God every day for his research and persistance at getting the funding necessary.",1240099200,41,528,4.377551020408164

The struggles this Doctor and these brave women went through to get FDA approval for Herceptin are almost unbelievable. The movie shows the determination and dream of this remarkable Doctor to find an effective treatment for this very fast growing cancer that had taken so many lives.

3791664,5,B001TKNWV4,"This movie is called Living Proof about a targeted medication that was developed by Dr. Dennis Slamon from UCLA. This medication is  called Herceptin for people who are HER2 Positive. (type of breast cancer).  This medication  was tried in  3 phase trials to see if the medication Herceptin could be tolerated in people like it was in mice.  I was in phase 3, and  it was to prevent a  delay a reoccurrence or  a reoccurrence all together. I received this drug in phase 3 trial, and have remained cancer free for 14  1/2 years. This is a powerful movie that you do not want to miss seeing. This movie was dedicated to all  the brave women in 1, 2 and 3 phase trials, and I was proud to be one of them.  An excellent movie that is also educational. This is to remember that Herception is not a chemo therapy, but a targeted treatment that effect 30% of  some women. There is also a book called the making of Herception that is also informative. Harry Connick Jr. played Dr. Dennis Slamon very well. You could feel his emotional response to his work, and really felt for his patients in this movie.  Don't delay get this movie.  Thank you",1462752000,,1136,4.399038461538462

3791724,5,B001TKNWV4,"It is a movie of the story behind the research into discovering Herceptin, the targeted treatment for the HER2 Breast Cancer which I was diagnosed with this year.  Previous to Herceptin, one usually had around a 2 year prognosis, which consisted of heavy chemo, surgery and radiation.  Those only prolonged the disease process.  Since Herceptin, many women have greatly prolonged lives.  My cancer 100% responded to the Herceptin and the doctors call it a cure.  The research scientist overcame many obstacles in well over one decade, to getting it available and able to pass the strict protocols to be approved.  The film is pretty consistant with the book ""Her2"".

It was the copy that I wanted, and it arrived well within the time frame that I was notified of.  It came in perfect condition and as I will be using it for a gift, I was very pleased.  Thank you.",1442534400,2,863,4.7

Harry Connic, Jr. was entertaining and compelling to watch.  In real life, he had performed for the first fund raising gala for this effort, he must have had high motivation for performing in this movie.  My 'hat's-off' to the many real heros who came to the plate when needed to keep this research moving forward. I have been disappointed by the seemingly slow progress in curing cancer, but this real episode helps explain why dramatic change is fundamentally slowed and even stopped in some cases.

3791782,1,B001TKNWV4,"Today I go for my first infusion of Herceptin, the drug featured in this movie. Having breast cancer causes one to do a lot of research and seek truths. The movie stretched truths to sensationalize the drama. The presence of falsehoods and trivializations of the scientific challenges and the doctor visits don't help those facing cancer.

I like the idea of increasing awareness of the struggle researchers and drug companies face, balancing good science, the need to remain profitable to stay in business, and the needs of the customers. But the movie sadly did not deliver as it portrayed many in an unjust light.

Time to get ready to face day one of my long chemotherapy. I am thankful to the many researchers and good science under the FDA requirements since I can face my treatment bravely.",1394582400,,797,4.810218978102189

This also reminded me that it takes brave people to be willing to actually become the FIRST people to take the drug.  And it takes someone who is passionate and tenacious about the cause, in this case Dr. Slamon, who gave up many years of his life to push this drug (Herceptin) through the research, testing and trial phases.  He worked tirelessly and fought hard with the drug company to continue to fund his efforts.  And today I am one of the people who benefits from his work.  I am taking Herceptin and I'm thankful for Dr. Slamon and his work.  But I'm also thankful for this movie which gave me a better understanding of the process of getting a drug into production and through FDA approval for certain treatments.  While it doesn't change the fact that chemo and other treatments can be uncomfortable, to say the least, it does make me pause and be thankful for those who did so much to get us to the point where breast cancer and other cancers are more treatable and survivable.

First, the movie suffers from the usual weaknesses of medical stories: artificial setup dialogue, a too-bad-to-be-true villain to provide conflict, and too many tear-jerking moments. Second, it verges on being propaganda for drug companies. The general view taken by the writer is that drugs and Science offer the only path to healing; one cancer patient who dabbles with alternative therapies is presented in a decidedly negative light.

3791847,5,B001TKNWV4,"LIVING PROOF is a biographical account of Dr. Dennis Slamon's discovery and invention of a new class of oncology drugs and, in particular, trastuzumab (HER-2).  Trastuzumab is an antibody used for curing breast cancer.  First, let us look at the regulatory aspects of this film.  Then, let us look at the emotional aspects of the movie.

REGULATORY ASPECTS.  The viewer will learn about inclusion criteria for a clinical trial.  We learn that a subject must have breast cancer, and that the tumor cells must be HER2 positive.  We learn that the goal of Phase I trials is to characterize safety (""side-effects"").  We also learn about exclusion criteria from this movie, for example, the exclusion criterion of the study subject having had too many rounds of prior chemotherapy.  This movie shows one of the characters being refused entry into the Phase II trial because she failed to satisfy this particular criterion.  Also, we learn that funding for any particular clinical trial can be a start-and-stop activity.  In this movie, we learn that where GENENTECH decided not to fund the study, another company, REVLON stepped in and provided money.  Another take-home lesson, is that clinical trials require regulatory approval from the FDA, and that clinical trials need to be designed by physicians who actually have experience in trial design (just because you are a doctor who discovers a new drug does not mean that you have the slightest clue in trial design).  The movie shows Dr. Shamon being told that ""his"" clinical trial will be taken over by physicians who actually have experience in trial design.  Also, relating to concept of regulatory approval, we see a cancer victim who had been approved for entry into a Phase III trial, begging a receptionist to be given drug right away, ""I only have a day to live, I need the drug right now, I can't wait until next week.""  We learn of the concept ""quality of life,"" which is an issue for most clinical trials for chronic, debilitating diseases.  Quality of life in these clinical trials is always measured by a special questionnaire called, ""Health Related Quality of Life instrument.""  LIVING PROOF teaches us all of these lessons.  These lessons, as taught by LIVING PROOF, can be understood by children of the ages 8-12, by teenagers, and by adults.

EMOTIONAL ASPECTS.  To cut to the chase, this movie requires a collection of Kleenex tissues or handkerchiefs.  We see various examples of emotional dispair, where is woman is being denied entry into a clinical trial, because she does not meet the entry criteria (inclusion criteria). The result is that she dies leaving behind a family and children (Kleenex #1).  Another character turns down a marriage proposal, because she believes that she will eventually die of her breast cancer (Kleenex #2).  There are other scenes of emotional triumph, which also require the handkerchief.  One of the characters has reached the point of despair, and decides to live out her final days in Mexico, sipping margueritas on a relaxing beach, instead of vomiting from chemotherapy.  But then, she gets persuaded to enter Dr. Slamon's trial, and at the end of the movie, she is declared totally cancer-free (Kleenex #3, #4, and #5).

THE BAD GUY.  One unusually interesting theme in this story concerns an employee at Genentech known as ""Reinhart.""  He is portrayed as the bad guy in this movie, apparently because of his expertise in trial design, in contrast to Dr. Slamon's lack of expertise in this skill.  Even though it is not certain why ""Reinhard"" is the bad guy, any viewer of this movie will sense that something good has occurred when Reinhard is taken off of the trial.  While I do not know if ""Reinhard"" corresponds to a real person, it is often the case that, in management, people with Reinhard-like characteristics are encountered.  This particular Reinhard had characteristics that were both good and bad.

SUMMARY.  The movie sticks to events relating to the various phases of this drug --  research, funding, regulatory approval, enrollment, adverse drug reactions (""side effects""), trouble getting enough patients enrolled, and efficacy.  The movie does disclose some of the outside activities of all the characters, for example, a courtship between an African-American woman and a Caucasian man (happy ending), Christmas party not attended by dead mother, and fact that Dr. Slamon did not have time to be a devoted ""family man,"" that is, to attend school functions of his daughter.  But these outside activities merely act as a cementing substance to the ""bricks"" of this movie, namely, the steps required to get regulatory approval.  The movie emphasizes the issue of femininity, for example, where the soundtrack plays Dionne Warwick's, ""I SAY A LITTLE PRAYER,"" at which point the film dwells on each cancer victim, that is, on her activities in grooming, lipstick, womanly shoes, skirts, and so on.

CRITICISM.  I only have one critisism.  The movie does not mention that Phase II trials and Phase III trials are usually randomized (placebo versus study drug).  However, it is quite possible that the HERCEPTIN clinical trials only contained one arm (study drug only).  But it is also possible that the movie failed to mention randomization, in order not to scare away the viewers of this movie (to scare them away from participating in clinical trials).  FIVE STARS for LIVING PROOF.",1289520000,10,5404,5.031496062992126

3791849,4,B001TKNWV4,"Living Proof was written for and shown on cable, and while the message and story was great, it suffered from the inherent cost limitations and abrupt editing cuts for a TV movie with time constraints.  The Harry Connick Jr. portrayal of the researcher's struggle, stress and frustration with limited, funds, legal hurtles, FDA requirements that cost lives was portrayed well and many a tear could fall as he struggled to save the lives of victums of a fast growing and unique form of stage four cancer. The doctor/researcher followed the rules to insure success for the masses while the rules cost the lives of many. His nemesis, all real live must live with, appeared to have no feelings for those who suffer was portrayed perfectly.  As an engineer in the medical field I felt the pain he felt.

3791853,5,B001TKNWV4,"This made for TV movie is based on the book, HER-2, which is the story of Dr. Dennis Slamon's passionate pursuit of a cure for breast cancer. It is essentially the battle between Slamon and Genentech, the company that owns the rights to Herceptin. Slamon is the lead research doctor on the drug and believes with all his being that it can give new life to at least 40,000 of the 200,000 new breast cancer cases each year. Genentech does not believe it has the potential to be financially successful, which is their definition of a successful drug (at least how it is pictured in the film). At a point in the development of the drug, Hollywood friends come to the rescue and raise the money to keep the project going. It is clearly Slamon's drive and passion that is keeping the research alive. It is also the general story of what it takes to bring a new drug to market through the FDA approval process-no insignificant task no matter how great your drug is. The film becomes very emotional as he finally wins approval to begin testing on women in stage IV breast cancer-those that are considered without hope from any approved treatments. Because of the extremely tight restrictions put in place by Genentech, he must exclude some women who are desperate for any hope of a cure. Even more heart wrenching are those who are helped in the Phase I testing but are not allowed to move to Phase II because of the Genentech restrictions. He also discovers that it helps some but not others which is powerfully visualized in a scene where the treatment room is shown full of the test patients that started and one by one those who have died disappear. The film is a testimony to the belief and perseverance of one man who was determined to make a difference against great odds. Where might that apply in our lives? While the drug is not without controversy today, it has saved thousands of lives and fulfilled Slamon's dream of making a difference in the battle against breast cancer. The one shortcoming in the movie is the depiction of Genentech as, more or less, the evil enemy of this dedicated doctor (which they may very well have been) but there is another side to every drug story. And that is that there are hundreds (maybe thousands) of potential drugs out there to cure all kinds of diseases and some are worthwhile and some are not. There is not enough money to find out if they all work and someone has to make the decisions of which ones to pursue and they all sound great in the development stage. Making those kind of life and death decisions requires the wisdom of Solomon, something very few people have. These decisions will only get more difficult as our population ages and the money shrinks to provide treatment for everyone for every disease. This is a wonderful, inspirational film worth watching.",1261785600,,2815,4.609561752988048

Lilly Tartikoff is another name to remember as a tireless promoter and bridge between Max Factor/Revlon and the financially blessed individuals who donated millions of dollars into breast cancer research and finally to Fran Visco President of the National Breast Cancer Coalition who professionally and seamlessly brought common sense and compassion to the Herceptin clinical trials that opened up this treatment to all individuals with the Her2+ breast cancer gene.
And finally to all the woman who were part of the clinical trials and those who are no longer with us (in body) your courage, strength and legacies are the shoulders upon which survivors stand.  You will never be forgotten.",1485648000,2,966,5.1075949367088604
