8487850,5,B005W7QSDE,"This DVD offers wonderful, hands-on instruction in proper lighting for a number of different ""interview"" scenarios. The content may be a bit basic for the experienced videographer, but it's an excellent primer for someone fairly new to lighting interview subjects.",1370908800,,264,5.625
