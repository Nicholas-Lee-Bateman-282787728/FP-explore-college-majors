When I watch Amazon VOD thru my Roku or TIVO on my TV at home the quality is excellent. The first show I downloaded to my laptop was recalled by Amazon because it was not watchable at all, the replacement download was ok. I will continue to use Amazon VOD to watch at home on my tv but won't spend any more $ to watch on my laptop while traveling until the watch on the laptop Unbox video/audio problems are resolved.",1280361600,2,577,4.207207207207207
4086100,5,B0038M2AOQ,"""Mad Men"" . . . I download it like those heroin addicts who can't get the tourniquet on their arm quickly enough.  Just get it pumpin', man.  Just shoot me up now . . . ahhhhh.

This has gone bleak.  The Scotch is down to Canadian Club, drunk from an ordinary glass.  Bland, black-and-white, like 1964.  And great.  I loved every moment of it and anticipate the color explosion.  Bring on the '60s, man.

The scariest part is the ex-wife.  And the little girl never fails to amaze.  Can't hardly wait for her to turn 16 and blow up the local post office, ""American Pastoral"" style.  I used to want to buy a ""Cross My Heart"" and a girdle after watching this.  Now I want to swear off buying anything.

4086102,5,B0038M2AOQ,"Matthew Weiner is the creator and writer of this show.  He oversees every aspect of it, from having personally found Jon Hamm (Don Draper) to every piece of memorabilia used on the show.  When Don's kids are watching tv, it was as if I were a kid again watching those shows and on that kind of early tv (which looks very strange nowadays).  There are two aspects to the opening season: the new ad agency painfully finding its niche AND Betty and Don in their new personal lives.  They are equally fascinating with perhaps Thanksgiving Dinner at Betty's new mother-in-law's table the best scene of the first episode.  I have seen Jon and January (Don and Betty) on other tv shows and you would be hard pressed to tell that they are even the same people.  Physically they look very different, which again shows Weiner paying obsessive attention to detail in recreating looks which resonate with 1960s icons.  I don't want to ruin this for everyone by saying more.  Let's just conclude with the observation that the show is perfection and a must seel.",1280102400,14,1048,4.657608695652174

4086130,4,B0038M2AOQ,"Mad Men's 4th season continues to deliver the goods in Matt Weiner's capable hands.  The breakaway ad firm Sterling, Cooper, Draper, and Pryce is up and running though a bit tenuously.  Jon Hamm is superb as gifted creative director Don Draper the show's pivotal character.  Having grown up in this era and living in Fairfield County, CT some of my father's friends could have been the template for Don.  They were successful, some even worked in advertising, commuted to NYC everyday, had affairs with secretaries, got divorced, 3-martini lunches, the whole bit. I feel like I know Don personally.  The attention to detail in wardrobe, music, and set dressing is incredible and the each episode is like opening a time capsule to the 60's.  This season sees Don bottoming out, frequently drunk, burning through women unable to sustain a relationship,and ultimately having his work suffer.  Other supporting characters continue to develop; Joan and her husband (off to Vietnam) struggle, Roger's still not happy and remains a spoiled child, Pete is maturing and now a partner in the firm, and Peggy keeps gaining confidence but feels the need to court Don's approval.  I'll admit on the face of it Mad Men shouldn't be that captivating but it truly is engrossing.  Looking forward to Season 5!",1476144000,,1292,5.0

4086146,4,B0038M2AOQ,"I was surprised by how much I enjoyed this show but the one thing that stood out during all the seasons is how black people were treated by whites, especially the way white females treated the black women. They would smile and pretend to respect them (like Betty, Don's first wife) and as soon as they did the least little thing, they would throw the black employee under the bus. Like firing a ""nanny"" who neglected her own family and children for years just to serve a lazy white woman too neurotic to raise her kids and clean her own house, only to be denied a reference so she could get another job.

And the other mistreatment, like the white employees having a party and tearing up the office and the black elevator operator and cleaning man, who weren't even present, getting fired.  And the head of the agency not wanting a black person out front, and the total lack of acknowledgement of any sex appeal by the black females as if it were nonexistent (although I'm not complaining that there wasn't any interracial sex escapades).

At least this show was at least honest about how pervasive racism was then and how insensitive and insincere the whites who dealt with the blacks actually were.

Too bad this kind of honesty is totally absent in today's phony movies and TV shows where, if one was truly naive, would think racism had gone the way of the Volkswagen Beetle, but those of who live with it everyday know better",1467936000,,1429,4.54863813229572

4086299,5,B0038M2AOQ,"There are so many ideas on managing clients and staff available in this series. As an editor for a technical journal, I think I'll extract a few for my column.

I especially liked the episode where Draper threw out Jansen, a client who wanted to sell bikinis but not show skin. Don called them prudes and idiots! I wish more engineering firms understood that the client-firm relationship is very delicate: it requires patience and honesty on both sides. Many a time, I have wanted to fire the client; instead, we build the process and it was either a nightmare of corrections or a product that limped out the door.

As drama, the series is excellent. Draper and company could have been my father and grandfather. These were tough men who didn't talk about their feelings, at least not in public. It was nobody's business.

Season 4 starts up where Season 3 left off. The only Season that is a little iffy is Season 1, in which the actors were still exploring their roles. We saw the same thing in Breaking Bad and House. By Season 2 Mad Men had a clear message and direction.

You should stack Mad Men in the shelf with Breaking Bad and House, MD and entertain yourself and your family for decades to come.

4086368,3,B0038M2AOQ,"Occurs in the Fall of 1964 and goes into 1965. About an aspiring ad agency. Mostly about a supposed ad guru Don who is a drunk and can say/do what ever he wants with gals and say he does not remember. He hooks up with any/many including a waitress.

He is separated from his wife and three children and his daughter has issues. Clients include Lucky Strike, face cream, a ham company, and possibly Honda.

While the look of the era is good I could find no character to care about. Depressing. Don never really does anything besides smoke and drink except to leave. He has another life where people call him Dick. Flashbacks to when he was hired, he appears interesting then. A surprising amount of door opening and closing, ugg. People hook-up, pictures of bare skin. Surprising amount of women with red hair. A racist rant, again, ugg. They spend a surprising amount of time scheming.

Extras feature comments about leadership, divorce, 1964 Pres. ads, and Mustang ads. Avoid.

The acting is just as good as everything else, and that shows with all the awards they have won doing the show.

4086375,5,B0038M2AOQ,"After the three season arc of Don hiding his identity from his wife ended, i felt at the time that the 4th season was somewhat unfocused as to where it wanted to go. Rewatching it however I now see it as a successful extension of Don's self-exploration and am convinced more than ever it should have ended here. The succeeding seasons have dropped off one new cliff after another in terms of dramatic quality and cohesiveness. I'm still startled that Weiner is the showrunner because season 5 to 7 seems to have been written by someone who didn't see the first four season much less co-write them. So watch seasons 1-4 and marvel at the artistic achievement and pretend the last seasons didn't happen.",1426291200,,701,4.661290322580645

As we learn more about who Don Draper ""really"" is, you might expect the show to become more interesting. But since the premise is that it's all a shallow world in which women are exploited and men are jerks, the revelations about his identity lead to an escapist fantasy-type story strategy instead of anything truly engaging.",1407196800,,616,4.820754716981132

4086583,5,B0038M2AOQ,"We don't subscribe to any cable station for TV but we do love movies and have begun to buy some DVDs. My son told me  how good Mad Men was and said that I would probably enjoy it. The first season took us a while to enjoy but once we began watching the 2nd season and the 3rd season, we really wanted more. In Season 4 we see the main characters start their own company and come together to support one another. It feels as if they are finally working together. We had not felt that Don Draper's character was very likeable but in this season we discover a lot more about why he is like he is. He has to deal with more loss and we see him go through the motions of grief. Peter's character seems to soften a little and in this season, his wife is pregnant, and there are moments when this pregnancy is seen with a backdrop of Peggy's pregnancy. Peggy and Don have some fascinating conversation and although we sense they will never be good friends, they are somehow supportive of one another, and each others' quirks. The dynamics between them, boss and employee are very interesting and show really good writing. The best scene we think (not to be a spoiler) is when Don seems to be having a real panic attack. It was so good. I had not thought of him as an actor before, he always seemed so ""wooden"" but this scene towards the end of the season shows a depth to his character and he opens up his ""soul"" to a new woman (and there have been many as we all know!!!!) I am told the next season isn't so good but this one was really great. I await the next season which I have just purchased..",1400284800,,1590,4.17915309446254

Spoiler Alert:  If you haven't yet watched season 4, read no further.
I think that the end of season 4 would have been a satisfying place to end the series.  Don Draper has achieved quite a bit of self-awareness through an accumulation of numerous mental flashbacks.  He has formed a stable relationship with a mature woman who understands him.
I could only get through 5 episodes of season 5.  I found that in season 5 ""Mad Men"", one of the best shows in the history of tv, had become reduced to soap opera.  The main subject was no longer the self-awakening of Don Draper.",1393200000,,634,4.431034482758621

4086637,5,B0038M2AOQ,"Without the usual shenanigans, this would not be Mad Men. In line with the times, smoking is occasional, not as all-consuming as in the 1st Season.

This season is more brooding and introspective, with some much needed hilarious black humor thrown in as counterbalance. Don visits his namesake's wife Anna, with whom he has become very close, but not intimate - Don's only true friend who knows and loves him as he is. Faced with terrible news, we see a different and more human Don who now thinks and reflects, instead of constantly projecting an impenetrable facade.

The fate of Sterling Cooper Draper Price teeters, as always, from one crisis to the next. But there is a different feeling in this Season, bringing it back from the doldrums of Season 3.

Specifically worth mentioning is Randee Heller's re-appearance as Cooper's ex secretary Miss Blankenship, hauled out of mothballs to replace yet another of Don's fired secretaries. Uncharacteristically, Don tolerates her. Her tactlessness and pithy comments are a breath of fresh air. There is a scene involving her removal from the office (no spoilers) that had me laughing out loud. Refreshing asides to lighten sombre moods, temper tantrums and the like.

More and more, this series belongs to Don, Peggy and Joan. Pete's slimy character just gets more unlikeable, although he does take the fall for Don. One wonders how the vain, cold and superficial Betty, could ever have ignited Don's passion, let alone Henry's. Little wonder that Don played the field.

Roger is unravelling, probably due to his recent folly, while Cooper wanders around aimlessly, lost without his own office in which to cogitate. Rich Sommer's Harry Crane, despite featuring in almost every episode, is unmemorable. Lane Price becomes less stuffy, dropping a clanger when his father visits. But young Sally, having proven herself in the previous season, is masterful at conveying a casualty of divorce.

The excessive drinking in previous seasons is more credible now - the drinkers are drunk, hungover, maudlin, which is more believable than their previously sober personae.

season ownership did not show up like it has many times previously.  (but then it wasn't HD or Blueray, which you apparently care more about promoting then my regular copy anymore)

This I find upsetting.  How hard is it, and what type of ethics does Amazon to alter their search from keeping their good customers away from what they already have paid for?  Isn't what you already own, something you might want to visit?  Aren't searches
for many categories used to get back to a place you've been.  Or are you under the immature and unrealistic impression that
people know exactly where something is, as opposed to just how to get there?

4086723,5,B0038M2AOQ,"I have been watching the first three seasons of ""Mad Men"" on the Polish TV and got so much involved in the life of its heroes that when the third season came to its end, I started to look for the fourth one at Amazon. Wow! There it was waiting for me in the company of the fifth one! Thanks Amazon!

Click! I bought it and in two weeks the discs safely arrived to my doorstep. Now, I am watching the consecutive episodes enjoying their unique atmosphere.

Why do I like it?
Mostly, because it is an honest, realistic description of the tough but optimistic life in the USA at the time when in the Eastern Europe we were fed with illusion of the social justice. The ""Mad Men"" heroes are far from being ideal, still one may and does like them. I am observing their life recognizing in its background the echoes of the contemporary cultural and political events such as the assassination of John Kennedy and Martin Luther King or the birth of the legend of the Rolling Stones.

If you like life, if you like real life, watch ""Mad Men"". You will be not disappointed. I promise :-).",1378512000,,1077,4.348258706467662

DVD arrived quickly and the quality was great. I would recommend it.

4086742,5,B0038M2AOQ,"I was very late to discover MADMEN, and didn't know what to expect. I certainly didn't expect to be captivated by what is IMO, one of the finest shows to ever be televised. I've been watching the ""vast wasteland"" for nearly 60 years, and MADMEN was worth the wait. My only regret is that while all good things must end, crap goes on forever. So I'll stay to the end, savoring each glorious moment, and take consolation in the knowledge that such things are still possible. God bless AMC!  While I'm at it, I should probably say a few words about the Blu-ray disc I purchased. We finally bought a 55"" plasma set, along with a rather pricey sound system to complete our home theater. MADMEN  arrived just in time to put it to the test. I had expected a spectacular picture, and was not disappointed. I remember the sixties, but not looking this good.  But it is the audio that I find the most remarkable. The DTS HD Master Audio, playing through nine good speakers, is  truly stunning.

4086857,5,B0038M2AOQ,"Season 4 remains my favorite of the 5 so far. The only season where Don is single offers more information about Draper personally than ever before. Don starts a diary and Jon Hamm doing a narrative is easy on the ears. In this season, he mentions that he should have finished high school and tells someone else where he went to college. I'm tickled by the idea of Don Draper in college. I hate to give away much but this season also has my favorite moment were Draper's secretary makes an awkward exit during a critical meeting. The firm loses their biggest account and when the firm can't get arrested, Don does a Jerry Macguire; writing a manifesto dismissing ever bringing in more cigarette advertising. Draper doesn't tell anyone else in the firm that he pays the New York Times to publish the manifesto as a full page ad. Romantically, Dr. Faye Miller is a perfect match for Don except for one obvious fault, she's not 25. A couple of other notable visits from old characters: Duck Phillips and Freddy Rumsfeld return in grand awkwardness. I really wish that they would bring back Salvatore Romano, the original art director. For DVD and Blu-ray releases, I wish they would have more gag reels and ""making of"" features as the history documentaries are interesting but not always specifically tied to events on the show.",1361577600,,1324,4.711206896551724

4086949,5,B0038M2AOQ,"When things get bad, we tend to look to the past. And the bleaker the future looks, the further back we search for comfort. As the new millennium keeps disappointing us, TV shows set on the 50's and the 60's (once a rarity) keep growing in numbers. Many have tried and failed. MAD MEN tried and closed the deal. And have been doing so for 5 seasons now.

Meet Don Draper (Jon Ham), a Madison Avenue water-walker (and based on real life ad-man, George Lois). He is an enigma wrapped in a mystery. He is brilliant and secretive. He wants to keep walking the tight rope with no safety net. And definitely no contract. He is a chain-smoking, hard liqueur guzzling, womanizing alpha male. He is a loving father of three, married to a picture-perfect ex model. He has it all. And yet he cannot find peace. Because he learned early on that the world is always yawning at your heels, eager to yank everything you love away.

From bursting with joie-de-vivre Roger Sterling (hilarious John Slattery) and ever scheming Pete Cambell (baby-faced Vincent Kartheiser) to the gorgeous women (such as barbie January Jones and refined Jessica Par as his first and second wife, respectively), the cast is one perfect pick after another. And the writing is brilliant, reproducing the tastes and smells and nuisances of the era around Camelot, while drawing you in to the personal stories of characters polished yet inevitably flawed.

The 50's and the 60's were before my time so it is not nostalgia that makes me love the show. Yes, I find the era mesmerizing and (probably undeservingly) less complicated. If nothing else, though, back then they knew how to dress. Women looked feminine and men looked manly. You see January Jones on the red carpet, for example, all dressed up and groomed for a Hollywood function - and that modern image cannot hold a candle to herself dressed for everyday(!) life in the 50's. When did we loose it? When did we decide men should stop wearing suits and hats and women should start wearing sweat-suits outside the house? I, for one, blame the hippies!

This is one of the best TV shows ever and this box-set includes season 4. There is one more. Season 6 is eminent whereas season 7 has already been green-lighted. As I have said again before, good TV is best watched on DVD. Make weekends out of it. It is much more enjoyable to watch an entire season in a couple of days than having to wait week(s) between episodes. And (quite ironically, in this case), you will not have to suffer the...commercials.

HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.",1353715200,,2541,4.688340807174888
4086950,1,B0038M2AOQ,"The show deserves five stars, but Amazon gets one for the problems I've had with streaming.  Sometimes it's OK, but on evenings and weekends, which no doubt are peak usage time, the program stops and starts constantly.  I'm confident the problem isn't my internet service--I never have this problem with Netflix, for instance--so I figure Amazon simply hasn't invested adequately in server capacity or some other resource to support the amount of streaming they're selling.

The present opinion goes for all four seasons that I have had the privilege to see up to now. This being one of the best tv show ever. I can't believe the quality, the cripsness of the dialogues and the well inspired scenario. So good, the last, that a lot of the episodes could make it into a worth while movie by themselves. So many great ideas. As for the acting, it is superb and I mean all the cast.  It is so much better than your average saturday night motion picture in a theatre at the nearest mall.

4086964,5,B0038M2AOQ,"So interesting to see the first inklings of the anti-smoking crusade in this episode. Although they are almost never seen on TV now, the 1960s anti-smoking commercials were very graphic and very dramatic. One in particular involved William Talman, who played Hamilton Burger on the hugely popular ""Perry Mason"" series in the early-mid 60s. He was was visibly dying of cancer and made several anti-smoking commercials, to great effect. We just don't see those anymore, probably this is the compromise with big Tobacco.

Poor Dr. Faye, she sealed her fate when she said ""Have your girl make the reservation"" at some fancy French restaurant. Don already has his eye on younger and prettier (and less ""professional"") Megan, his secretary.

The Betty/Sally conflict is brewing but slightly boring. Has either read Betty Friedan?",1348790400,,823,5.2272727272727275

The clothing, hair styles, the behavior of men and the women's role in the workplace are all exactly the way it was.  In many ways it brings back bad memories and in other ways great ones!  The casting and set design is fantastic!  Once I bought the series it was hard to do much else except watch it.  It's addictive. Drinking and smoking were HUGE in the 50's and if you didn't smoke, you simply did not fit it.
If you are interested in authenticity in films or in a made for television series production, this is amazing.  I am glad I bought it.  I will watch it again in the future.  It's THAT good!

Season 1, 2, 3, 4 are wonderful. Such great acting! I did not think John Hamm did much ""acting"" in the first 2 seasons but he has grown into the role. The constant smoking and alcohol consumption by EVERYONE is disturbing but that was how things were at the time. The episode covering the murder of President Kennedy was the most riveting. Now I am viewing season 5, which I do not think is as good as the prior ones. But that is just my opinion.",1347408000,,622,4.235294117647059
4086969,5,B0038M2AOQ,"Yup, it's all about women again in this episode, from little Sally to old Ida Blankenship (who comes out with some doozies in this episode). Some women are stuck in their type-cast roles (Betty, Joan the office sex-pot, Megan), others are trying to break free (Peggy, Fay and Sally), but no one seems very happy in either role. Fay realizes she is especially doomed; immediately after sex with Don, he's only interested in her business dealings, and when she clams up, he leaves. Later, he puts her through a humiliating personal-relations test to see if she's ""mother material."" The men on the show, Roger especially, continue to be users.

4086970,5,B0038M2AOQ,"I think the series is always at its best when it's centered on the advertising agency and not sidetracked in NY suburbia or the characters' personal lives. This episode proves that most ""original"" advertising work is pilfered from other sources. Don revels in his award for the Glo-Coat ad when in fact it came from Peggy (or at least that's her version) who is excluded from the awards luncheon. And then there's the Life ad.......Show's how little ""inspiration"" really enters into the creative process at SCDP.

The Dr. Faye character is interesting although ultimately doomed, as Don doesn't respect her work or approach and only regards her as prey for his sexual desires. And his appetites are on full display in this episode. Does divorce really do this to everybody?

The constant parade of new secretaries (Miss Blankenship lol) at Don's desk reminds me of the running gag on the old Murphy Brown series where Murphy kept getting a new crackball secretary only to fire her/him at the end of the episode. One episode near the series end featured a reunion of all her fired secretaries who got their final revenge. If only this would happen to Don!",1346630400,,1154,4.8232323232323235

We see the introduction of the lesbian character Joyce who takes Peggy to counter-culture parties in mid-1960s New York and there she enjoys the recognition of being a professional and not ""just"" a secretary. Yet, Peggy still recognizes that it's a man's world. Don can sleep with his secretary and thereafter ignore her until she has a near breakdown, and Pete can bask in the glory of being a ""first time father"" without having to acknowledge his previous child with Peggy. (BTW whatever happened to that baby? The last I remember of him he was at at an Easter egg hunt at Peggy's church).

It starts a bit slow, but after a few episodes, you are captivated by the strange, misogynist yet infuriating compelling world of Don Draper, a charismatic and mysterious creative director at an ad agency, and his wife Betty. I can't say I love it as much as some of my friends do (maybe it's because I'm a woman, and sometimes the misogyny gets to be too much) but this is definitely a smart and well-written show.

Not with Mad Men - In my opinion, this was the most compelling season yet (I haven't seen season 5). On most shows, they give you a character with a flaw he/she must overcome - they always do, and thats the end of the story. How often does that happen in real life? Never. Most people constantly struggle with their flaws and are always working on them. That's something that makes the characters in Mad Men so believable.

Don is now a divorced man with a love of drink and an amazing number of women.  He has a variety of female relationships while Betty has chosen to try to continue her life as is with another man.  Neither is quite content, Don does miss the family relationship he has lost and Betty is no freer and happier than she was before.  Her life is stagnating in a pitiful direction.  She is so unhappy.  Don is luckier in that he has an ability to travel and socialize with people at work and in the world.  The company tries to move on and develop a solid clientele but old habits and the past seem to keep up with the group at every turn.  The elder men of the company are stagnating and somewhat harmful to the company as they have developed habits that don't quite help the development of a new company.  The younger employees, Peggy and Pete, are the people who seem to be creating the most work and are freer than their elders to relate to a changing 60s world.  Youth is the new attraction in this period of time with a baby boom and Don discovers a nice way of accessing youth for himself and his children.  Betty chose an elder man who is wonderful but is increasingly irrelevant to her happiness especially when she has chosen him to be a Don substitute rather than a real man.",1333324800,,1458,4.258181818181818

4087112,5,B0038M2AOQ,"Yes, this season is about Don Draper's low points as he struggles to adjust to divorced life.  But it's really Dr. Faye Miller who drives this season.  Her character foreshadows the powerful educated, confident, assertive woman that will likely be a force as Mad Men transitions to the late 60s.  We all thought it was Peggy who has been making this transformation in front of our eyes, but Dr. Miller is already there.

There are some other ""modern women"" starting to evolve in this season: Joyce, who works for LIFE magazine and Stefanie who goes to Berkeley.  However, it's Dr. Miller who commands the attention of the SCDP employees and eventually Don.  She has to adjust to get respect - like wearing a wedding ring but, like so many others, she eventually falls for Don.  That's likely given her occupation as a psychologist: we all know Draper is the most fascinating character in the office.

I loved a later episode how the director parallels Dr. Miller with Sally's child psychiatrist and Don' new secretary.  Masterful writing and directing.

Dr. Miller's overall fate is hinted in the subtext of the episode ""The Rejected,"" but it's still much more complex than that.  Highly educated women in a world still dominated by men have made many sacrifices to get to the top.  Admittedly, it's impossible for me to relate to that.  But her circumstance is metaphor for the times and even today.  We root for her character, even more than Peggy.  I stopped rooting for Don a while ago.  In that sense, I found Dr. Miller's fate only semi-tragic, but for various reasons that I don't want to write as to avoid revealing too many spoilers.

I hope the writers of Mad Men find a way to feature Dr. Faye Miller in Season 5; her character is what made this my favorite Mad Men season so far.",1323388800,,1791,4.6528662420382165

Choosing relative unknowns, excepting John Slattery as Roger Sterling proved a wise choice. These actors inhabit these characters unfettered by past roles or even a congnicence that these ARE actors.

Perhaps the best part of the season is the attention paid to Sally Draper's character. She really grows up and comes into her own this season. I think she is a lot like her father and it's very interesting to watch what happens to her.

The other seasons had nifty unique boxes, this one is the quad fold out plastic, which is fine for the innards. It is the cardboard sleeve without a bottom that bothers me. As soon as I took it out the quad the dvd holder slid out and hit the floor. I have other movies like this and they do the same thing. You take it off the shelf and the DVD holder falls out.

How I have fixed this is take a business card and cut it in half (business cards work well, being heavy stock). I lay the business card that has been cut in half (longways) and line it up with the bottom lip with the business card laying out of the sleeve but snug against the bottom, to create a sort of hinge. Then I fold the card back towards the front to make a bottom so to speak for the DVD's not to fall out. Then I put a piece if tape over the closed end on the backside so it doesn't look too shoddy.

4087241,5,B0038M2AOQ,"*** THIS REVIEW IS FOR THE BLU RAY ISSUE ***

Most other reviewers have picked up on the fact that is probably the Best Season so far in a series that has been superlative from the start. And while ""Mad Men"" has been accused of being too detached in One, Two and Three (all style and no substance) - this Season has seen the hugely watchable cast and their slowly fleshed-out characters all get to really shine. The writing is brilliant, it's very funny, it's effortlessly chic and well dressed - but it's also very poignant and touching too. It's a job well done. But I'd like to talk more about the PICTURE QUALITY...

Filmed entirely on 35mm stock (as HIGH DEF as it gets) - ""Mad Men Season Four"" has picture quality that rivals benchmark stuff like ""Band Of Brothers"" and ""The Pacific"". No episode is ever less than beautiful and at times - absolutely breathtaking. Episode 7 is a good example - called ""The Suitcase"" (a Samsonite advert campaign dominates the program), it's where Don and Peggy get really close and Don's drinking is really getting out of hand. There are scenes in it when your jaw drops to the floor at the clarity. You notice the luminescent Sixties glow of garish ashtrays on tables, the old labels on bottles of Canadian Club, the shape and colour textures of boxes of tissues on toilet cisterns, the speckled weave of finely tailored suits - the detail is awesome.

There's also some great extras - one in particular about the advert campaign for the Ford ""Mustang"" car which is pure Don Draper.

Our home has taken the plunge and bought all 4 Seasons on BLU RAY rather than DVD - and I have to say they're keepers.

""Mad Men"" may be cheaper on DVD - but don't be tempted - BLU RAY is the only way to see this exceptionally classy TV show.",1306195200,4,1766,4.455108359133127
4087242,5,B0038M2AOQ,Season 4 of Mad Men is every bit as good as the previous 3 seasons. The storylines are riveting and the production values are as strong as ever. We learn more about the main characters episode by episode but it still leaves us thirsting for more.,1306108800,,246,4.369565217391305
4087243,5,B0038M2AOQ,"You just have to have it. Nothing better. Sarcastic. Sardonic. Sad. Exuberant. And all with a deceptive sence of humor. You must buy and revel in this title. With a glass of single malt Scotch, of course.",1305936000,,204,4.54054054054054
4087244,5,B0038M2AOQ,"One of the most time-honored movie cliches involves the inevitable success that follows starting a new venture.  A hero or heroine opens the movie in a soul-crushing job or relationship and struggles to break free.  Invariably the movie includes a heartwarming montage of taking the first steps in the new venture - set to inspiring music.  The movie then closes with our hero(ine) triumphant, reinforcing the notion that simply following your heart will result in financial or romantic success (often both).

Season 4 of AMC's ""Mad Men"" was set up for just such a cliche.  Not only was our hero, Don Draper (Jon Hamm), divorced from the icy, brittle Betty (January Jones), he had fled the confines of Sterling Cooper for the plucky start-up, Sterling Cooper Draper Price.

But Season 4 includes nary a montage and (thankfully) refuses to tie everything up in a shiny happy bow.

Season 4 sees our favorite bunch of boozers and philanderers coping with dizzying change.  Not everyone is prepared.  And these changes come fast and furious.  As crises are won't to do, they pile on.  The discombobulation comes from more than just the immediate lives of the cast - this season is set in 1965, a year where the counterculture made great strides toward the mainstream at the expense of rigidity of the Eisenhower years.  Vietnam, civil rights, and feminism - each unsettling forces for a Manhattan advertising agency - loomed on the horizon.

All in all, there is plenty to keep the viewer entertained during these razor-sharp episodes.  Indeed, so much is crammed into this season that the finale feels more disappointing than usual (that, along with the news that Season 5 won't be out until 2012).  If you've already watched Seasons 1-3, Season 4 is officially can't-miss TV.",1305849600,2,1774,4.945945945945946
4087245,4,B0038M2AOQ,"The fourth season of MAD MEN, the best American dramatic television show of the last decade, begins with Don Draper (Jon Hamm) and his ex-wife Betty (January Jones) both allowed what seems to be a fresh start: newly divorced from Don, Betty has married the handsome politico Henry Francis, while Don has started a new upstart advertising firm headquartered in the Time-Life Building with his old bosses at Sterling-Cooper. Yet neither Betty nor Don finds themselves able this season to make the break with the past they might have hoped: Betty insists on keeping her children in the old home in Ossining, while Don's shame over his divorce brings him further and further down as he drinks more and more heavily, as his new firm struggles to find its feet.

MAD MEN is so much better written (and filmed, and acted, and designed) than other American television shows today that it seems almost wrong to complain, but even so the fourth has been the weakest of the seasons so far. Individually some of the episodes are absolutely first-rate (particularly ""the Rejected,"" a superb episode focusing on the aftermath of Don's drunken amorous tumble with one of his secretaries), the characters' cynicism and sourness begins to wear a bit, particularly in the case of Betty Draper Francis, whom series creator Matthew Weiner seems to have it in for. Even if Betty's constant bullying fights with her daughter Sally (the excellent child actor Kiernan Shipka) are realistic, they wear out their welcome pretty much, as does Don's constant nastiness towards his creative staff at the new firm. The introduction this season of two sunny major new characters, a research specialist (the warm and intensely likable Cara Buono) and a beautiful French-Canadian secretary (Jessica Pare), is a tremendous help, but even so you can't help hoping Weiner decides to take the character of Betty in an entirely new direction because it seems to be bringing the whole series down (and January Jones's one-note acting in the role isn't much help).

The DVD set is perhaps the most horribly designed of all the series' badly designed DVD sets (it's very difficult to reassemble after you've opened it up, and the plastic cases the DVDs snap into keep coming ungummed). It comes with some fine features including a study of bourgeois divorce in America in the 1960s; there's lots of commentary, too, although be warned that when Matt Weiner is joined by his directors and editors and advisers he almost completely drowns them out with his own ideas, and they are of course too cowed for the most part to get a word in edgewise. (Fortunately, he has much intelligent to say.) One of the nicest surprises of this set is that John Slattery's commentary for the episodes he directs is much more thoughtful and sober than his wearying fratboyish commentary turns as an actor in other seasons.",1305504000,4,2862,4.923395445134576

4087249,4,B0038M2AOQ,"MAD MEN rebounds from a lackluster season. 3 with a satisfying, if at times frustrating , season. 4.
The world of Don Draper and 1960's NY & LA is once again re-created with loving, breathtaking, authenticity and detail. Watching MM is an immersive experience. The viewer really feels as if he or she is living in the era depicted. As this is my favorite time in history , it is oftentimes an amazingly enjoyable program. Last season was a bit disappointing after the phenomenal seasons 1 & 2. The pacing was at times glacial and the balance between the boardroom and the bedroom tilted too far towards the latter.  This flaw is mostly corrected in season 4. Mostly. The producers still seem to think, erroneously, that bed-hopping makes for interesting storytelling .In fact, it  gives off a sense of laziness and desperation from the writers. The endless kissing scenes can be unbearable and come off as filler (had the show contained nudity at least the simulated sex would be more palatable). The relationship between Mr. Sterling and Joan still seems forced and is unpleasant to watch (everytime Sterling  puts the make on Joan I want to hit the fast-forward button). Peggy Olson's sex-life never seems believable- sleeping with Duck? C'mon! Lane shacking up with a black Playboy bunny comes out of nowhere and also does not ring true. Young women in that era did not go for middle-aged men.
However,just about everthing else is fantastic. I never tire of the scenes dealing with the ad agency and their clients. The trips to California are entrancing and moving. The acting is superb as always. The costuming, music, cinematography are top notch. This is still one of the greatest shows ever to be aired on commercial television.

The four season is just what i expected and a little more , all the characters in some way suffer by differents situations but at the end all of them are involved for the same company and that means everything.
The character of Don Draper oh gosh i just loved him, sometimes is arrogant,others times a genius, lonely, scared for his own past, always drunk, selfish ,merly lost,  but at the end everyone has a light.

Since I like the show no matter what, I sometimes focus on the more subtle trappings included on the dvd. Like how they change the little intro setups from disc to disc each season. Disc one starts off with the main characters just in black and white then adds hints of color as the discs progress bringing the 4th disc into full color. Also I like the change of music on each disc. I'm not too crazy about the commentaries though, for some reason it's like listening to a lecture.

All in all I think it's a great dvd, interesting season with changes for a lot of characters. I just hate that it will probably be 2013 before season 5 will be released.",1304553600,,870,4.364197530864198

Whatever you thought about her in previous seasons, her character development this season explores many sides to her.

Things don't help much when the company is threatened by something really big and Don faces a shattering reality mid season.  As this season takes place at the height of the 60s we get to see Don's generation versus the younger crowd.  But one of the real heartbreaking performances is done by the actor playing Sally, who has to deal with all the fallout of divorce and living with her narcissistic mother.  Peggy and Joan deal with their own challenges but let me avoid giving spoilers and leave it at that.  Arguably the best drama for TV in the last several years though BREAKING BAD and some others are close contenders.

WHen I see Draper arriving home, I cringe.  When he arrives at the office, I sit back and enjoy the show.  The sit-com stuff is begining to take over the entire show, and the show will sink of its own weight. ""When it's good, it is very very good; but when it is bad it is horrid.""

4087421,5,B0038M2AOQ,"Season 4 of Mad Men has taken a quantum leap over Season 3 when it comes to intense and intelligent story lines, beautifully scripted and brilliantly acted.  Jon Hamm has become, finally, a great actor in this show.  In the past he was hamstrung by the character's current dilemma which centered around the telling of his sad past.  That, along with establishing, and pruning, the other main characters and watching them bud, kept the stew on simmer for 3 years.  In Season 4 the pot boils over and it is wonderful to behold these main characters un-peeling the layers of their personalities before us.  This is one of the elements that makes this show an outstanding television drama, one of the greats.

I don't have cable or satellite and broadcast no longer exists, so I had to wait until the dvds came out last week.  I wondered what it would be like without some of the old mainstays like Paul Kinsey, who I hated as a character but I guess we were supposed to, and the old Sterling Cooper office staff.  I needn't have been concerned.  The new Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce offices are even more interesting because they were decorated at the start of the Op-Art craze which began in the early 60s as desirable and chic for homes and offices.  Roger Stirling's new office is outrageous, a fore-echo of some of the sets you will remember from the original Star Trek or even 2001: A Space Odyssey.
I love Don's bachelor apartment in the Village.  I don't think its squalid at all, it was New York City gothic; dark, noisy and typical of the times.  Now Don's place is probably an over-priced condo, painted off -white and full of designer bounce.

I love Roger.  He's such a rat but John Slater makes you love him.  He's suddenly growing old after this season, losing American Tobacco, losing Joan... he had bags under his eyes in his last scene, very sad.  But he'll be back!  I miss his daughter, played by Elizabeth Rice.  Hope they bring her back again after she divorces that gay man that she married on the weekend following JFK's assassination.

I like all of the new characters, especially Jay Ferguson's oddball art director Stan Rizzo.  He's a perfect foil for Elisabeth Moss's Peggy Olson.  Stan has many facets besides being goofy and quick off the mark with clever retributions.  Stan is the prototype for the masculine (he's hunky in a chunky way) yet sensitive, as in vibes, urban man.  He's probably gay but not as obvious as poor old Sal Romano.  Joyce, Peggy's lesbian friend, has a wry ironic twist to her face which keeps her from being simply a smug village suffragette.  I'm not sure about Peggy's new boyfriend, though, Abe I think his name is.  She's having great sex though, which is what she wanted.  I can't help wondering if Peggy will go for one of Joyce's galpals she keeps presenting to Peggy.  That's one of the minor cliffhangers for Season 5 to resolve.  I won't miss Dr Faye Miller.  It was right that Don should cut her loose, there was something automaton-esque about her.  No heart, just neurosis.  And Bethany was too young for Don.  Megan is perfect for him.

All thirteen episodes are first rate, A+, and that hadn't been the case in the first 3 seasons which wavered wildly in the quality of the scripts.  Old characters who we liked, like Francine Carlson and even Midge, come back for a scene.  Poor Midge, remember Don's first village romance that started the series off, is now down and out, but I won't give out any more spoilers about events that take place.  Even rotten old Duck Phillips returns for one last drunken turn.

There isn't as much comedy in Season 4, no fat jokes or leering tribes of junior execs zeroing in on the new secretary.
This season is extremely adult, dramatic and moving.  The music is as great as ever and the sets are evolving with the times.  We are now done with 1964 with Don triumphant, and beautifully in love with a wonderful woman and poor old Betty spitting nails.  She got just what she wanted.  I have to say I love the way Betty insists on seeing a child psychiatrist.  She's not nuts, nor is she a hopelessly embittered little bitch.  She's evolving too and I started to see some of her early vulnerable sweetness again in the last episode of this season.  I didn't hate her like I have done for the past 3 years anyway, though she's thoroughly obnoxious through most of the Season 4  shows as well.  And Henry is turning out to be something of a fraud, we could'a told her that.  What a class A creep that guy is.  I mean seducing a 6-month pregnant married woman!  He's scum and there doesn't appear to be much depth to him.  I think maybe, I  hope, we've seen the last of that character.  Next time we see Betty she'll probably be living in elegant squalor in her father's house, like Grey Gardens in better days.

In spite of the wrenching stories being told in Season 4 it ends on a very high note of love and absolution.  All is not perfect, though.  Bert Cooper has a snit fit and stomps out, but he'll be back.  The show is greatly enhanced by the presence of Robert Morse.  There is much to look forward to with Season 5, and beyond.",1301702400,,5135,4.507592190889371

His miserable American Gothic childhood, where lying and punishment are common currency, sets up the entire show's basic thesis: America is about duplicity.  Don is the product of a series of lies: the extraordinary early episode ""The Hobo Code"" seems central. Don's neurosis, his alcoholism and self-destructive drives as well as his failure to create stable relationships all flow from this. In some ways, Mad Men is like a classic Freudian outline of the shaping of personality.  It may be that the series revealed too much too soon, but I hope we get back to the ""origin story.""

4087472,5,B0038M2AOQ,"Though Season 4 petered out a bit at the end with a few too many plot mechanics and a distressingly predictable and repetetive finale, the first 10 episodes were, all in all, sensational. The Season 3 finale, ""Shut the Door. Have a Seat."", set up a delicious situation which was a chance to reinvent all the characters and storylines. Matthew Weiner and company took advantage of the plum they handed themselves and got the new firm set up in cutting edge digs and managed to weave old characters in and out as needed. Overall, the show was fresher, more focused, and more streamlined. This season really did trace the trajectory of Don's downfall from booze and buried sorrow--which culminated in a hit-between-the-eyes moment in episode 6, ""Waldorf Stories"". It was so perfectly set up that when you got the impact of it, it was truly stunning. (January Jones as Betty Draper was in this episode for one brief scene, but she delivered the three-word line that made Don realize he'd finally hit rock bottom. Interesting the connection those two still have.) From there, we began to follow Don as he made the first real attempt we've ever seen to take control of his demons. This led to what may be the best episode the show has ever produced, ""The Suitcase"", episode 7. (Or at least equal to Season 2's phenomenal finale, ""Meditations in an Emergency"".) Primarily a two-character piece for Don and Peggy, it was the episode the entire series had been building to, if only we'd known it. The two had to work overnight on a Samsonite presentation and various demons and frustrations finally escaped and Don got some bad news from California that at last led to a needed breakdown. Written by creator/executive producer Weiner, ""The Suitcase"" is television at its very finest and may well win Jon Hamm and Elisabeth Moss those elusive Emmys come this summer. (Weiner, at least, is basically assured another writing Emmy for this masterpiece.) From this point, the financial woes of the newly-formed Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce take center stage and involve a fascinating examination of women's roles in the '60s workplace, as well as a life crisis for Roger Sterling, which provides John Slattery the chance to do career-best work. The final few episodes don't live up to the start. They're well-crafted, but it's distressing to see the plot wheels turning a bit obviously and watch Don appear to begin repeating familiar patterns. However, we never know what Season 5 will bring us.

Other delights from #4:
--Pete Campbell becomes a man with a backbone and a conscience
--Don gets saddled with battle-axe secretary Miss Ida Blankenship, who constantly spouts wildly inappropriate comments and is played to delightful perfection by Randee Heller; this humor is much-needed as a juxtaposition to some of the darker goings-on
--Roger writes his memoirs!
--Joan leads a conga line!
--Some Japanese businessmen are quite impressed by Joan's, er, assets
--John Slattery directs a couple of episodes, ""The Rejected"" and ""Blowing Smoke"", and proves himself as capable behind the camera as in front
--Episode 5, ""The Chyrsanthemum and the Sword"", features a hilarious caper played on a rival agency and a truly good performance from January Jones. She sometimes gets some flack, but I think she plays an incredibly complex character with just the right touch of lacquered veneer over raging internal chaos. In this episode she ranges from near child abuse to breaking our hearts talking to a child psychologist with a thinly-veiled desperate need to be heard. This episode won the Writers Guild award for outstanding single episode of a drama series. (The series, incidentally, won the award for overall drama series as well.)

In all, this was a fascinating season exploring the difference between a character's appearance and their reality. Everyone in a large cast got chances to shine--and they still made room to incorporate some historical happenings which are skillfully woven in.",1296172800,9,3979,5.036418816388467

This season is the most enticing from its queezy beginning, to an earth-shattering end. You will see most complex character development in this seasons then others and bigger dilemmas, dramas and setbacks...this is a must have for Mad Men lovers, and a must see willing to give Mad Men a second (or fourth) chance",1295222400,24,520,4.602150537634409

4087475,5,B0038M2AOQ,"Don Draper is (spoiler alert) doo dooing where he eats and not just once, but every time I turn around.  The first episode was one of my favorites, it's full of so much hope and possibility and as the season ends, you realize that first episode is what Don Draper (and maybe all Type A men) want 24/7.  Whereas, Betty's descent into bitterness is so real, you can't help but hate Don for ruining what could have been magnificent.  If you've ever made choices of the heart without thinking through the ramifications, only gleaming the surface, you know the consequences are huge.  I love the scene where Francine warns Betty as she spews her hate for Don, that Betty is the one (and the only one) who has everything to lose.  Don may self destruct, but Betty seems unable to think two steps ahead.  Season 4 was a great ride, I can believe I have to wait until Summer of 2011 for Season 5.

I love Amazon's Video on Demand feature.  I gladly sat at my computer to watch Season 4, night after night and before the DVD was released!  This is the reason why I have always been loyal to Amazon.  They do it first and I stumbled across it, which makes me feel like I found that quarter bottle of vodka in the back of the freezer on a bad night.  I had never even heard of paying for episodes before, much less a season.  10,000 points amazon for getting it to me first (and not clubbing me over the head with it).",1293926400,3,1407,4.2679245283018865

I'll never use this viewer again and will recommend those I know to avoid Amazon on demand videos like the waste of time / money / credits they are. ""

As for the season, it lacks the depth of the characters and the social analysis of the previous seasons.  It is degenerating into just another alcoholic soap opera and it is easy to predict exactly what will happen to particular characters with respect to the war and the cultural transformation of the coming years-in a cliche manner that has been done to death.",1293840000,4,679,4.408
4087477,4,B0038M2AOQ,"Although not necessarily the best season of the four Mad Men seasons that have aired, this is definitely one that will keep you at the edge of your seat as much as a good drama can.  This is primarily because there are so many ups and downs in almsot every episode that at some point you say to yourself ""how much worse can it get for Don"" or towards the end of the show ""wow--it seems like things have turned around in a real positive way for Don.""

The show continues to address many of the difficult issues of the 1960's in a very sensitive and smart way.  The two that are addressed most prominently are smoking and racism.  Smoking is addressed and dealt with in terms of the account management at the agency. I won't spoil the episodes but suffice it to say there is a good episode where they are forced to determine what sort of clients they represent moving forward.  In terms of racism, this is addressed throughout but most prominently towards the end by Betty and her housekeeper of many years.

The new firm goes through many ups and downs in this season. They celebrate some successes together and definitely many failures--some of which take them right to edge of the cliff.  To see if they fall over it, you'll have to watch the season and find out.  Also a huge surprise with Don at the end you won't want to miss.

Will Don go through with secretarial nuptuals? Why do I think not.

Great writing. The best on televison and might be the best ever. Mad Men is truly an art form. And should be staged as opera!! And I don't mean soap.",1289520000,3,555,4.475247524752476
4087501,5,B0038M2AOQ,"The excellence continues with this fourth season of MAD MEN.  Matthew Weiner, its creator, was one of the writers on the SOPRANOS. He hovers over every detail of MAD MEN, getting it absolutely right, just as creator David Chase did for the SOPRANOS.  The first choice he made was absolutely insisting that Jon Hamm had to play the lead.  Everyone thought Weiner was crazy insisting on an unknown.  Result?  Jon Hamm is now a major tv star and probably going to be a major star period. Next bit of historical marvel was that HBO turned this show down so that Weiner took it to an upstart cable channel, AMC, and ended up putting AMC on the map.  For those of you who don't know it, this show IS Weiner and this was nowhere more evident than at the 2010 Emmy Awards show where he walked up to the stage to receive Emmy after Emmy including the best drama show one, the big one.  I am dwelling on this point because often viewers do not realize that it is one person off camera who is making the whole thing happen.  That is certainly the case here.

Don Draper (played by Jon Hamm) continues to be the fulcrum for the show; everything pivots around him.  However, it is a very rich band of characters indeed who do that pivoting. In season four, everyone is coming into his or her own, whether for good or ill. Draper himself goes through a huge melting down crisis post divorce, flailing around now that what little identity he had seems gone. His entire identity now comes down to his job, which is finding a way to brilliantly project falsity, which is a metaphor for his entire life.

Betty, his ex, is becoming more of what she has been in the prior three seasons.  More brittle, more vicious, more intent on achieving her ever elusive goal of perfection.  This becomes so paramount that one scarcely notices her Grace Kelly like appearance anymore.  Her new husband belatedly realizes what a morass he has gotten himself into by marrying her.  Her relationship with Sally becomes one of the best of the show. There is a boiling point coming between the two of them which I am awaiting more eagerly than any other plot development,

Don Draper's secretary also becomes a pivotal force.  For half of the show it is an old battleaxe who is just fantastic and then we get a very attractive, very maternal young French Canadian woman.  As the show gathers steam towards its end, it becomes apparent that this is a very important character to watch.

Peggy and Joan also remain big characters.  Rounding them out as the women of the mid 60s in the work force, is a woman who is the harbinger of things to come.  She has her doctorate in psychology and is using it to measure and predict consumer acts in the advertising world.  She begins dating Don and Peggy sees her as a role model for herself, a woman much further up in the business world model. Joan is still mired in the head secretarial world and also is stuck with unfinished business with her major weasel of a boss, Roger Sterling.

Don Draper's nemesis Peter becomes no longer his nemesis but now a comrade in arms.  Where once these two were at odds, they now need one another, more than even they realize as Roger Sterling gives them only half the tale of a major crisis.  Pete Campbell has changed a great deal as a character and is now a force for stability that once seemed impossible.

The only bad thing about season four is that it ended.  For those of us who are in its thrall, that we have to wait until next summer to delve into season five, is a very sad state of affairs indeed.

4087502,4,B0038M2AOQ,"This season was definitely a mixed bag, with several high points and low points.  Don Draper, in particular, showed marked changes in character and demeanor.  Apparently, he's showing his ""true inner self"" and is no longer the ""Be all/ Know all"" whom we've all come to expect.  The other characters continue to grow and develope as well, and there is enough residual suspense to heighten our anticipation of next season's offerings.  Overall, this season wasn't quite as good as Season 3 --down from 5-Stars to 4-Stars.  But it was still a heckuva lot better than a lot of the other stuff found on TV.",1288656000,8,601,4.740384615384615
4087503,5,B0038M2AOQ,"Some viewers were surprised by some of the twists in this season's MAD MEN.  Having grown up in Don Draper's 1960s era, I think his character is utterly consistent with his time and place in America.  Draper often tries but there is only so much he can overcome. He's creative and talented.  He can be audacious in his ideas and his work.  However, he is always a prisoner of his past and forever on the run from it.  Hence, I am not surprised that his two closest people at the end of this season are women who appeal to the feminine side of his own creative nature. That one is superbly maternal would be an incredible draw to someone with his childhood always dragging along behind him. The other, Peggy, is what is best about himself, unaccompanied by the worst of himself.

I was very interested to also see how thin things are wearing between Betty and her new husband.  Increasingly, he finds her doing one vicious or despicable thing after another.  This brittleness in her nature is also becoming more and more apparent in her every scene.  I wonder if this guy can survive another five years with her.

I also think Sally is becoming a major character and I can hardly wait until next season to see if I am right.  Sally did well in her therapy with the psychiatrist but, predictably, Betty refused treatment for herself when the psychiatrist suggested it.  I am just as interested in seeing the fireworks with Sally and Betty next season as I am anything else.

Also, that weasel Roger Sterling has some big surprises coming his way.  I see fireworks in his future too.

In conclusion, sigh, I can't believe I have to wait a year for season five!

4087504,5,B0038M2AOQ,"When I think about Season 4, one word comes to mind -- ""dark"".  This is the season of Don's discontent -- indeed, his comeuppance, if you will -- and as the season opens we find him living in a seedy Greenwich Village apartment, where his rendevous with the ladies end all too often in rebuffs rather than ravishings.  On the work front, Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce has all the trappings of success.  They have nice offices, a corral of secretaries, and a big client list.  Don is being interviewed by a magazine asking the question ""Who is Don Draper?"" and further on into the season, we see him accepting a Cleo for his talents.  The only problem is, he's drunk when he's accepting it.  In fact, he's drunk most of the time.  Dead drunk, and his decisions and fine-honed genius with words suffer for it.

Of course, being Don, he looks good.  Hard to believe a man can drink that much and still not show the wages of sin.  But as the season progresses, we see him losing his grip more and more, on the business as well as the personal front.  He blows up at clients, neglects his children, and uses his women to get what he thinks he wants.  At the same time, he is watching himself, from a distance, deconstruct.  He starts keeping a journal and swims every day to clear his mind.  You keep thinking he's going to get a grip on it.  He has to.  He's Don Draper.

The supporting staff is suffering too, all the with exception of Peggy, who seems to have really come into her own this season.  She is confident, perky, and looks great.  She's even dressing the part.  Joan Holloway is given more to do this season, thankfully, and her character only gets more intriguing.  There's really no telling what Joan can pull off, because no matter what happens to her, she keeps on going.  As for Betty Draper, she isn't present too often, but when she is, she is still very much the Mom you love to hate, and she doesn't seem to have learned a thing.

I can't reveal too much more without spoiling the season.  In fact, I probably should have put spoiler alerts in the beginning of this, but I don't think I've ruined anything for anybody.  This is great stuff, amazing stuff for television, and no matter how painful the journey, you've just got to watch Season Four.  All of it.",1286928000,186,2276,4.4110576923076925
4087505,5,B0038M2AOQ,"First, of all, I love the entire series.  It is excellent. In all categories.  The storyline, the set, the  wardrobe; the casting; the references of the era (circa 1960-64).  I worked in advertising on Madison Avenue in my early 20s.  I was one of the secretaries portrayed; I lived it first hand.  I remember the cocktails were mixed  on Fridays, at 4:00 pm.  The heavy smoking and the cads all over me with what we called today; 'sexual harrassment'.  I can also identify with Sally's character and Betty too.  Being ignored as a wife by a selfish controlling husband; and the indifferance of my Mother towards me as a little girl.  I laughed the hardest when Dan Draper comes home and quickly reaches out for a whiskey and a cigarette.  Those two children; sent upstairs to their rooms the moment he steps in.  But, unfortunately, it was accurate.  Our parents, ignored us and had no clue as to our needs.

I was a 10 years old who lived terrified of being bombed by the Russians and had no idea what the 'Bay of Pigs' was.  My parents did not explained; just like Dan Draper would say, 'nothing' when Sally would ask.  ""Daddy what's wrong.""

Luckily, the character was taken to a psychologist; not as easy for me.  I just chewed my nails; and worried all the way to adulthood.  Then I had to deal with the 60s; women rights and sexual harrassment at work; equal pay for equal work.

I truly reflect back each and every time I watch.  I will order Season 4 this week.  And, I will re-watch each and every episode over and over.  As, there is nothing on TV today or theatres that would keep my interests.

But Peggy is a small stakes deceiver.  Roger Sterling descends to his lowest level ever in this episode.  Loathsome is the best adjective for summing up his character. And except for the recently deceased woman in California, Don Draper has yet to meet a woman he can't two time. But he's not loathsome.  He's a much more complex character than Sterling.

She hates living with Betty and I can't say I really blame her.  Sally is bold and fearless.  So by the end of this episode I am picturing Sally being a member of the SDS or Weathermen some years hence.

4087611,5,B0038M2AOQ,"I notice there is a negative review on this page regarding this episode so I am going to be a bit more expansive in comment than usual for an episode. What the other reviewer is mentioning is that Don and Betty's daughter Sally plays with herself at a PJ party while she is watching tv in the dark and the other kids are asleep.  She is caught by a parent and everyone goes ballistic. I'm not sure this would be considered a major psychiatric event in today's world, one warranting that the daughter have her own psychiatrist for four days a week of analysis, as it warrants in the mid 1960s.  To me the real minefield is her mother Betty and the increasingly hostile relationship between Sally and Betty.  I can't believe after interviewing Betty, the psychiatrist didn't want to put HER on the couch four days a week, instead of Sally.  That is what I would want to do.

There were a lot of Betty Drapers back in that time period.  She married extremely well both times because she is physically lovely. However, the husbands don't even seem to notice that there are some major components missing from her personality, like empathy and compassion, to name just two.  Betty is also tightly buttoned down, acutely aware of her reputation in all respects, and is seemingly obsessed with obtaining the perfect life straight out of an upscale American woman's magazine of the time. She is brittle and even increasingly vicious.  Only her new mother-in-law seems to notice that Betty's children are terrified of her, bringing it up to her son who instantly dismisses such an inane notion.

There were a lot of daughters of Betty Draper like women back in this era and many of them did develop serious problems needing psychiatric attention.  One could read this that Sally is increasingly acting out in rebellion towards a mother she already mostly hates and resents.  Sally now has an absentee father and a stepfather who couldn't care less about her.  Thus, the ingredients are well in motion for a major disaster to occur.

The rest of the episode concerns courting Japanese clients not long after winning a major world war against them.  WWII is only two decades in the past.  Silver haired men like Roger Sterling fought that war and haven't forgotten their prior attitudes about the enemy.",1282608000,11,2291,4.73551637279597
4087612,2,B0038M2AOQ,They could have had the character who played Betty's daughter Sally doing something much less embarassing at her friends sleep over. Having her even imply that certain action trashed that little girl actress at a very tender age!! I was appalled!!! Mad Men had so much more dignity & class before it sunk so humiliatingly LOW in this 5th episode of Season 4. I was definately NOT expecting this!!,1282608000,2,396,4.753623188405797
4087613,5,B0038M2AOQ,"Many people keep complaining that this may be the worst season of the series.  I must say that they are completely off their rocker.  No other show on television today has such complex and developing characters, and the end of each episode keeps me coming back for the next.  The first episode of season 4 may very well be one of the best episodes in the history of the series.

Mad Men blends historical events of the time period perfectly within the show itself.  Not to mention many of the behaviors and social environments that people had to deal with in this time period.  The constant smoking, the unacceptable (by today's standards) drinking habits, and the religious and business related beliefs are accurately portrayed and give us a glimpse of what life in 60's New York was actually like.  There is no better show on television today than Mad Men.  The high quality actors, paired with the compelling plot and character developments, rank this show higher than any televion drama airing today.",1282348800,,1004,4.796511627906977
4087614,1,B0038M2AOQ,"Another episode that is dribblish.

Have had friends in advertising in the 60s and see little resemblance......as for Peggy's getting cozy with some beatniks, it would seem to me that they were not working in some prestige office building doing their weed, but more like in parks in San Francisco.

I just don't know why I continue to watch this .....loved it last season, but it has definitely gone down hill since then....new writers???  There isn't a hint of a story line...the suits and hats and drinking I get...but little else.  Since women during this period went to college to get their M.R.S. degrees, I also get the ponds 18 year olds bemoaning their man problelms.....and here again, Peggy and her abortion....it keeps coming up, with no mention of it per se, so people who didn't see the episodes that contained this bit of sorrow are in the dark....

Not happy with this seasons' efforts.",1281916800,2,901,4.787096774193548
4087615,2,B0038M2AOQ,"The only real drama from this episode was from my worrying that Don/Dick hadn't taken down the curtains at his ex's house before slopping paint on the wall.

I strained to discover any subtleties within the episode (because I really wanted to find some) but was left empty and wanting.

Weird and hopefully, just a hiccup in the series.",1281830400,,336,4.677966101694915
4087616,2,B0038M2AOQ,"My apologies to Matt Weiner, who has created one of the most interesting TV series in Mad Men in years. Some parts of this series are magnificent.

But this episode should never have been written and never have aired. Most of it seems to comprise characters getting drunk and behaving irrationally and out of character. Getting drunk may well be enjoyable, but it's extremely boring to watch drunk people talk like idiots for 40 minutes. Furthermore, they aren't actually talking about anything - it's one of the ""relationship"" episodes where characters moon (drunkenly) about their latest relationships.

Matt, there are literally hundreds of TV series we can watch if we want to see people whine about their relationships. Mad Men is interesting because of the ads, the intellectual striving, the irony. Enough with the alcoholic mooning about!",1281398400,2,846,5.1678832116788325
4087617,1,B0038M2AOQ,"What a piece of dribble.,,,....this episode stunk to high heaven.

The secretary with the Dr. husband bit is totally lame.
Who IS the gal with the broken leg who has the secret cancer?

So Don, who is being called Dick throughout, and his partner get a couple of prostitutes on N.Y.'s eve.....who cares?

Very badly written piece of material....hope the rest of the season is better than this piece of crumpet.  I'm being nice.",1281312000,,427,4.72972972972973
4087618,5,B0038M2AOQ,"Last season the owner of Lucky Strike made the agency fire Sal because he was gay.  This season the owner comes to the office Xmas party and flexes his control over the agency some more (problem is that he is about 70% of their business).  He is even more obnoxious and particularly takes out his desire to control and ridicule on Roger Sterling. Don, drinking heavily post divorce and now in the xmas season, also makes use of anyone he can to get him through the xmas season.  This episode increases the already palpable tension which opened the first episode of season 4.  I think things are going to get very ugly between Lucky Strike and the agency and Don and Betty.",1281052800,,672,4.483606557377049
