7616336,4,B01AZDMOM8,I will not say it was the worst movie. I think it could have been better but you have to start somewhere! I always try to support lower rated movies. She will get better with time....,1520726400,,183,4.111111111111111
7616337,1,B01AZDMOM8,"Terrible acting, horrible music, the fire scenes were clearly digital..The gay repo guy with the herpes on his lip was way over exaggerated. This was a freaking train wreck! All the women's hairstyles and weaves were worse than low budget. It was just terrible! I kept watching, hoping it would get better, instead it got worse. This was a TOTAL waste of my time and data even though I have free unlimited data. My advice to the director and actors in this movie; Do NOT quit your day job!!",1520726400,6,490,4.51685393258427

7616342,5,B01AZDMOM8,"Stepping into your craft is always a plus and 5 stars in my eyes. However, work could be done to make it smoother. Too many characters to keep with so at first, it was hard getting into. The scenes happened too quick and the characters showed little to no emotion. I enjoyed the moral of the story and the message it gave.",1516492800,,322,4.209677419354839

7616348,1,B01AZDMOM8,"This has to be one of the worst movies I've ever watched. And I happen to enjoy low budget films. It seems as if they spent $50 to create this disaster. I love Pokey Bear's music but he does not need a career in film. With the message of the movie, I believe it could have been better with better acting and a higher budget. But this looks like a movie a middle schooler may have designed. And the fire scenes were hilariously bad.",1515024000,2,431,4.142857142857143

7616351,1,B01AZDMOM8,This movie was horrible. I continued to watch because I started. I hate viewing something and not watching all the way through. The way the actors responded to the situations was so unrealistic and the damn soundtrack got on my nerves. Really it deserves 0 stars.,1514073600,,263,4.739130434782608

7616357,4,B01AZDMOM8,Let me say this is not a bad movie. It isn't the best but it was actually a good movie because it was trying to tell a moral story. It was trying to show how good women and men get hurt when they try to do the right thing. But I think the overall moral of the story was even though good men and women get hurt; the people that hurt them end up regretting their mistakes. There were some parts in the movie that wasn't very strong but overall it was a good moral message in the movie and for that I gave it 4 stars.,1512000000,2,514,3.8130841121495327
7616358,1,B01AZDMOM8,"This was the lowest budget movie I think I've ever saw. These stupid mofos even had the nerve to allow the fake corny a** actors to wear mirror shades. Like WTF who made this dumb shyt. You could literally see the camera and directors through the reflection of the shades. I've seen plenty of B rated movies but this was by far the worse ever.. this had to be like a D- rated movie. The girl who was pregnant wore the same nappy a** weave the entire movie went on shopping sprees and all yet the dumb whore bish never got her hair done...they had 3 ppl at the funeral.. Like wow was the budget that low ...couldn't even afford extras..LMAO  Who paid for this bullsh*t a$$ ""movie"" Target or Best Buy??? Cause I'm guessing that's where they got the cameras from to make this cheap a** film.",1511913600,,788,4.324324324324325
7616359,2,B01AZDMOM8,This was indeed a low budget movie the special effects where a joke. Yet the story line is what got me sucked in. This happens all the time in many different communities. The most funniest part to me was the gentleman whom was the lawyer and the repo man. Yaasss messy. He had me rolling.,1511827200,2,288,4.254545454545455

7616369,1,B01AZDMOM8,"This was literally the worst movie I've seen in a long time. The quality was super low-budget. You could even hear the sound equipment in the background making noises. Don't waste your time and watch this movie. From the bad acting to the even worse wardrobe, I wish I could give this movie a negative star.",1509148800,,307,4.5

7616371,1,B01AZDMOM8,"I'm so mad at myself right now, I knew this was garbage from the beginning,  yet I kept watching to see if it would get better and guess what, spoiler alert, it did not. Sound quality F-, Acting F-, Story line F+ it was all over the place, took more than half the movie to even understand what the heck was going on, even then most of it didn't make any sense.  The music drowned out the voices at times to where you can't hear the dialog, and you can actually hear the video camera zooming in and out in scenes. You can jump from the first 15 minutes to the last 10 minutes of the movie, and still would not have lost, or gained, any understanding of this movie.",1508630400,3,663,4.092307692307692

Second y'all may need to try and target acting schools when it comes to you picking your actor or actress. The story line was all over the place and needs to stay consistent. The special effects  yall need to leave alone until you can pay for good quality. It was funny, but y'all need to keep working.",1506556800,,447,4.137931034482759

7616378,2,B01AZDMOM8,"The movie was tolerable, but the plot was all over the place. The graphics were so elementary and amateur-ish; and the acting was terrible. The sound kept fading in and out, so it was hard to understand what was happening in a scene because of that.

7616382,1,B01AZDMOM8,"i sometimes will watch a ratchet movie knowing I am in for extremely low budget quality, but honestly that is not the reason for the low stars. I purposely watched it until the end to try and connect the synopsis of the movie to the movie. The summary is very off from what the movie was actually about, mystical and karlie may be the biggest known names but surely not the stars or centers of this movie. The movie was literally all over the place and nothing really developed or ended well, S#^! just happened.",1504915200,8,512,4.4

7616386,1,B01AZDMOM8,I don't know how I managed to get through the whole thing. Mystikal was the best actor in the whole thing so what is that saying. Not to mention I have made better videos and graphics on my iPhone. I am ashamed for them..

8748966,5,B01AZDMOM8,"This movie is beyond bad. Its one of those movies that is so bad...its still bad and then you have to give up any expectation of a movie and its becomes good enough...to laugh at. Karlie Redd is surprisingly good in this though. Helen Mirren  herself couldn't save this dumpster fire...but if you enjoy bad movies you will enjoy watching the flames.

Oh yea........the A.J. Wright wardrobe and home decor and treating Michael Kors like some super luxurious brand was enough to make me laugh alone.",1533945600,,497,4.767441860465116
