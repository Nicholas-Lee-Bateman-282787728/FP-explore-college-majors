8104628,5,B000E33VYK,"All Dogs Go To Heaven: The Series is a really pleasant show filled with lovable characters, cute light hearted stories, and lots of great humor. I know the DVD boxsets of this show have recently come out, but I would like to review this 4 episode DVD because I've had it for a while.

This DVD of All Dogs Go To Heaven: The Series contains 4 great episodes. The episodes are the following.

La Doggie Vita: Charlie meets Belladonna who tries to make Charlie turn bad.

Magical Misery Tour: Charlie, Itchy, and David find a magic box that can multiply anyone who goes into it. Charlie tries to use it to get through all his noon appointments.

Fearless Fido: Charlie and Itchy are at a carnival/fair, and they meet up with Itchy's girlfriend Bess. They soon get harassed by the boxer named Manfred. Manfred is a bully who often tries to scare and intimidate Itchy. Manfred also tries to flirt with Bess, but she dislikes him a lot. Charlie tells him off, then Manfred leaves temporarily. Later, Itchy watches a Hypnotist show, and he becomes hypnotized into thinking he's a superhero.

The Big Fetch: This episode is hilarious. Charlie gets knocked on the head, and the whole episode takes place in Charlie's dream. He dreams that he is a detective in a 1930's setting. This episode is hysterically funny, and I laughed out loud many times^^.

The complete series of this show has recently come out on DVD. If you find this DVD in stores, you can buy it, or you can just get the seasons on DVD instead. This is a really fun and lovable show.",1387152000,2,1540,4.541516245487364

8104632,3,B000E33VYK,"Considering there were over 40 episodes, MGM were miserely in randomly picking 8 episodes from 3 seasons spread over 2 DVDs. Of the two this is perhaps the better, since it's a little more creative and also features Belladonna, unlike 'Friends to the Rescue'. This is an undiscovered, unremembered series from the later 90's which, despite its low budget, remarkably managed to retain almost all the voice talent from the movies (Dom DeLuise, Sheena Easton, Ernest Borgnine, Bebe Neuwirth, Charles Nelson Reilly, and an amazing cavalcade of famous supporting voice actors if you read the end credits). Please understand this rather lowly 3 star is no reflection on the series; just on MGM's penny-pinching and random release of just a fraction of the series. Here you have 89 mins which could have been 240 mins if they could be bothered  making a dual-layer disc. Instead they released two of these, then nada (apart from some slightly different earlier VHS's). You have no choice. Snap these both up (if you just want one, I suggest this). But still a sad swansong for an underrated series.",1336694400,,1092,4.934782608695652
8104633,5,B000E33VYK,"love the movies and the show and i'm just grateful that at least 8 episodes were released on DVD. 4 on each DVD isn't bad, especially for the time. it'll just feel like watching a full movie, in a way.
i say any ""All Dogs Go To Heaven"" fan should own this DVD and add it to your collection!
these were the good ol' days!",1311033600,2,320,3.9384615384615387
8104634,5,B000E33VYK,"i absolutely love Charlie and Itchie (or Itchy?) LOL
