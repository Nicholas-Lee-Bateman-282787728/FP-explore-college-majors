8433897,5,B004L5VOJQ,"I showed this video to my Wife whose Dad had been with the 34th in WWII Italy as a draftee. Especially since her Dad had never talked about his time in Mr. Roosevelt's Army & she wanted to know more. To say that she was really shocked by what she saw in this film would be an understatement. (The Army having pulled no punches in this film to its credit & showed what the war back then was really like) As she had no idea what the old boy went thru during his tour of duty. I think that she has a lot more respect for him now. Pity that he is not around to enjoy it.
  All in all I highly commend this film. Especially to all those folks who are always talking about why is it that we have the best military and never use it. They of course as always doing something else that is just as important when the deployments come up.",1444694400,,827,3.9759036144578315
