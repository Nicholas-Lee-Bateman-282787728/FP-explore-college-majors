8434818,5,B002LCTRX6,This video gives an account of forgotten history of the Acadians.  It is well done and present a great deal of information.  I was fortunate to go to Nova Scotia and find it.  It's a shame it has has not been put on DVD.  It's a great video for a history class.  More people should see it.,1353628800,,289,4.0
8434819,1,B002LCTRX6,"This is a very moving depiction of the attempt of the British
to exterminate the Acadians from Nova Scotia in 1755. This
film won the 1994 Silver Screen Award.

This is a ""must see"" if you are of Acadian descent. It shows
the tragedy of a people that endured and brought their simple
way of life, and amazing ingenuity to America and the world.
It has now become a historical lesson that the whole world has
learned and benefitted from.
