4048761,1,B0031DRVRI,"To say this is a ""documentary"" is to use the word very loosely. I expected this film to be about why humans are innately drawn to listening to and creating music. The reality is that it's just 74 minutes of musicians (some good, some extremely poor) rambling on about their vague notions of what music ""is"". You will learn nothing from watching this, and if I can save you $17 with this one star review then I feel like my job has been done.

However, it is almost worth buying for the 40 minute uncut interview with John Frusciante included as a bonus feature. If you're a fan of John then you will really enjoy that part. It's quite a unique and raw insight into his mind.",1271548800,15,674,4.307086614173229
4048792,4,B0031DRVRI,"A lovely blend of thoughts on music - what it means to different great musicians, how they view it and what are the common threads that run through all kinds of music. A documentary from the heart. Do not buy if you are looking for a music video or a movie with a storyline, but for all people who like music and are moved by music, it is a delightful DVD.",1369180800,,356,4.028169014084507

4048794,5,B0031DRVRI,Never thought that I would enjoy a documentary but this one spoke to me!  I am definitely an Audiophile so this one is right up my alley,1327622400,,136,4.037037037037037
4048795,5,B0031DRVRI,"this is simply a must see for anyone who appreciates listening to sounds. Funny at times but also incredibly insightful into the world of music. It is a magical thing. Alive, if you will. It exists and musicians simply translate the feelings to us.",1324944000,,248,4.659090909090909
4048796,1,B0031DRVRI,"I guess that having a large mix of Artists will tickle some people in wanting to watch this documentary, but it seems to switch between the science of music and Artists trying to express themselves and what music means to them the whole time. A good premise, poor execution and a waste of money.",1308873600,,295,4.481481481481482
4048797,3,B0031DRVRI,"I usually love just about any kind of music documentary, but this was nothing but a whole lot of short interviews. There's a couple of short explanations on sound and the human ear and the gold record they sent into space. But other than that it's just a long string of people's opinions on what music is.",1300492800,3,305,4.368421052631579
4048798,2,B0031DRVRI,"I wanted to like this documentary, because I am a passionate lover of music, and I appreciate, and feel an automatic kinship with anyone driven to make documentaries about music. But this one really missed the mark, and for me this is noteworthy, because I love music so such a degree, that it rarely takes very much to hold my attention.

The movie opens in a compelling enough manner, with some artistic imagery and an intriguing soundtrack, reminding me of cool science shows from the 70's that I really enjoyed as a kid.  The opening scene segues into short 15-45 second clips taken from interviews with various people, musicians and actors mostly, providing commentary on what music 'is' to them.  After ten of these interview clips, I found myself thinking ""okay, I get it, now when does the documentary really begin"". After twenty more of these clips, I was beginning to get impatient ... and after thirty more of them, my wife and I were resigned to staring at the screen blankly.  How many different interpretations of 'the meaning of music' can one endure?  It turns out, if wishing to get to the end of the DVD, one must endure about 74 minutes worth.

Occasionally peppered between these snippets were slightly longer scenes (maybe 2-5 minutes each) ranging from a very funny comedic analysis of contemporary music, to a woman describing her and Carl Sagan's 1970's mission to hurl a time capsule full of music into space.  As interesting as some of these scenes were, it wasn't abundantly apparent how they tied in to the overall theme, which was, I think, that the human heart beat is the fundamental basis for all things musical.  Maybe true, maybe not, but as a thesis, I didn't find this idea compelling enough to justify the dedication of an entire documentary.

I suppose all of these artistic statements would have better held my attention had they been profound, moving, and beautifully poetic in the way so many artists can be. Indeed, some of the artist commentaries fit that description, but most unfortunately did not.

The cover of the DVD advertised some musical heavyweights, such as John Frusciante, George Clinton and James Maynard Keenan, but their appearances were limited to one or two of the many 15-45 second snippets that made up the bulk of the movie.  Their contributions didn't seem to warrant their prominent position on the DVD cover.

I have to admit, quite sheepishly indeed, that we watched the last third of the movie on fast forward.  At risk of sounding too harsh (and that is not my intent), this documentary felt as though it had been swept together from the scraps on the floor of the editing room. Scraps that arose from the editing of some other, better documentary. Okay that does sound a bit harsh, but I really don't mean it to be.

When it was over, I was delighted to find that the DVD extras included an interview with John Frusciante.  ""Aha"" I thought ... ""my evening can be salvaged yet!"" ... But, sadly, even this failed to delight.  I am forever grateful to John Frusciante for his musical genius ... just the thought of his brilliance can move me to tears. However, as much as this is true, I am also aware that verbal communication is not among his higher skills.  45 minutes of unedited interview with John was enough to make even a devoted fan drift off into oblivion (no disrespect intended here John. I love you.).  An edited 15 minute interview would have been soooooo much more rewarding.

Despite my negative review ... I still feel thankful for the DVD. In a time when the mainstream is digesting meal after meal of irrelevant musical fodder, any documentary on music is better than no documentary.",1291852800,11,3670,4.733124018838304
4048799,5,B0031DRVRI,"Are you kidding me....!  The talent in this film is amazing.  Red Hot Chili Peppers, The Flaming Lips, Jimmy Eat World, TOOL, Elijah Woos, Juliette Lewis, JAson Schwartzman, and Fairuza Balk...and thats only like a few of the DOZENS of artists.

If you want to see into the hearts and sould of artists, scientists, actors and musicians, and ask them why we all have a soundtrack, and how music is a vital and necessary part of EVERYONE's life, then you MUST buy this movie right now!

Amazing from beginning to end. LOVED IT.",1282262400,2,525,4.612903225806452
4048800,4,B0031DRVRI,This movie will captivate any music lover from the start.  Some great interviews from some very respected people in here.  This film deserves more credibility.  Highly recommended!,1275955200,2,180,5.592592592592593
4048801,3,B0031DRVRI,"I got this because I'm a fan of Maynard James Keenan; he doesn't even speak during his interview though. I'm not sure if this was an artistic choose or if he merely charged more to contribute a speaking interview. That aside, his philosophy on what motivates him to create music is very interesting.
Tim and Eric make an appearance and they are, of course, hilarious.
The rest of the movie is filled with various artist who attempt to explain how music makes them feel and why they create it. Some are successful. Others sound as if they were caught off guard; their explanations are littered with words such as ""like"" and ""it""(""it"" being the unexplainable feeling music provokes in an individual).
There are also some interesting scientific theories: comparisons between music and the human body and how music affects the brain. Most of which I can't remember at the moment because I haven't watched it in over a month.
Overall this movie is less informative than it sets out to be and more of a conformation that you are not the only one who has trouble describing why music makes you feel the way it does.",1274918400,2,1108,4.658163265306122

8386910,1,B0031DRVRI,"Painfully boring and lacking focus.  I ignored the bad reviews because a couple of the famous, talented musician names were enough to make me curious to hear their perspective.  Well, some of those musicians are on air for approximately 10 seconds and the context of what they are saying is completely edited out.  I get that music appreciation is a varied subject that's not easy to explain, but please, a child could organize this into a more interesting arc than what was done here.  Plus, it annoyed me that medical or scientific researchers were given more time for their ideas than actual musicians as it's misleading from what the cover artwork says it delivers.",1484006400,,669,4.842105263157895
8386911,1,B0031DRVRI,"OMG  can I give this one negative numbers???  An hour plus of my life wasted.  Duh wow man like music is like a pizza, cuz you can get different topping and crust andget it delivered or pick it up.  Good Grief Charlie Brown don't waste your time or money on this one.  They should pay you big money to watch this nonsense.  Some people like the extra interview but I thought it was not any better than the movie.  If this crap would fit in the toilet I would most certainly flush down.",1471392000,,485,4.150537634408602
8386912,2,B0031DRVRI,It is just a bunch of people talking and I did not find it interesting. I got it from our local library and am glad not have paid money to see it.,1468454400,,146,3.59375
8386913,1,B0031DRVRI,"It's amazing that they managed to have so many voices and so few perspectives. There isn't really any story here. It's loosely strung together testimonials of person after person expressing very similar views on music.. which would be fine if it really dug deep and figured out how so many people can have such a similarly rich relationship to music. Instead it continued to skim the surface. It is by no means a long film but It took me three sittings to get to the end because it was such a bore.

I give it 1 star because an unfocused story and bland production fell way short of a compelling question and impressive cast of interviews.",1448928000,,639,4.508620689655173
8386914,4,B0031DRVRI,Best part of this is the bonus interview at the end with John Frusciante. 44 minutes long or something. Super interesting if you're a fan of John.,1386547200,,146,4.444444444444445

8386916,5,B0031DRVRI,"If you're interested in artists talking about their art, you'll love this doc.  The special features (or feature I should say) is the full interview with John Frusciante which was well worth the cost of the disc alone.  Highly recommended.",1380844800,,239,4.95
8386917,5,B0031DRVRI,One of my favourite music appreciation Documentary !!! Honest and pure interview from some the best Musician's of our generation.,1379635200,,129,5.5
8386918,5,B0031DRVRI,"I thought I didn't like this. I thought I hated it actually. Then I remembered the part of me that used to listen to music. I got it on with my favorite artist. My very favorite artist. This group of people are trying to say something that really can't be said. OMG. I love music. It sucks I have to go back to the grind this weekend where music is something other than enjoyable. Anyway, this movie is mostly just short bits of recognizable musicians and music appreciators. There is some interesting stuff, like facts about music, too. It is really pretty good if you try it with an open mind. Or if you hate it and then go back after you listen to your favorite artist whose album was totally collecting dust.",1376265600,,712,4.360902255639098
