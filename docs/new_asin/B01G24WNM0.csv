7753531,4,B01G24WNM0,"When Dean Whitman (Eric Roberts) kills himself and his soul is transferred to a 12 inch clown doll. He vows to kill everyone at the Delta Pi sorority. We get to meet the various girls at the house and I missed twice on guessing the Final Girl. The plot has a little complexity centering around Allie (Jessica Morris) who dabbles in the black arts wishing to contact the Dark Lord to raise havoc on Eastern Europe and maybe England.

The film is more comedy than horror. The lines are corny and cliche and at times spoofs the idiotic idea of a 12 inch anything being a killer. The humor is sexual. Bobo the clown talks and has a sense of humor. The film over does the suspense/thriller music rather loudly. Eric Roberts has a rant about sorority girls in the beginning that made me laugh. A fun film.

Guide: 1-2 F-bombs/ sex heard and not seen/ no nudity...all tease.",1474675200,2,867,4.446540880503145

8762057,5,B01G24WNM0,Jean Louise O'Sullivan and Jessica Morris are the main reasons why I watched this and they're funny and just good together. I wish they'd do more movies together.,1534118400,,162,4.821428571428571

8762059,3,B01G24WNM0,"Any time eric roberts is in a movie it's usually bad. This one is no exception. The movie as a whole is ok. His acting is horrible as always. No nudity at all in movie, and to be honest thats why we watch low budget horror movies. The story is ok thats why I gave it 3 stars.",1499126400,,275,3.7586206896551726

8762061,1,B01G24WNM0,"I no longer fear Hell after the inane claptrap that is this movie. Fails as a horror movie, epic-ally fails as a comedy, who is the audience? People who like their sex comedies with no sex and jokes that don't even make sense. I love bad moves, this is something altogether different... avoid at all cost.",1480032000,,305,4.464285714285714

8762066,4,B01G24WNM0,"If you're a fan of horror movies that are more funny than scary, then Sorority Slaughterhouse might be up your alley. There's not a scare to be found in this movie, but plenty of laughs and eye candy. No nudity, but there are women in bikinis. There's gore, but nothing really disturbing. I was surprised that there was blood in this movie, considering director David Decoteau usually shies away from the red stuff. I also must note that while most of Decoteau's recent movies are homoerotic in nature, this one is not. This one is aimed at heterosexual males, I think. There's even a lesbian kiss. My favorite actress in the movie is Jessica Morris. She looks a lot like Jenna Jameson when she was younger. If you're in the mood for some lightweight horror fun, then you should check out Sorority Slaughterhouse!",1474934400,12,813,4.6923076923076925
