8239149,4,B0010X8NKA,"Glass Fleet is the story Michel and Cleo trying to free the galaxy from the tyranny of the empire. It's kinda like star wars. If Darth Vader were gay and had braids there wouldn't be much difference. There a lot of interesting characters in this anime. There is a good mix of action and drama. The most impressive aspects of this anime are the animation quality and the space battles. It's a unique anime series and there aren't too many other series that are all that similar. I really enjoyed watching this anime. As I said the characters are the best part of Glass Fleet. The bad guy is so bad that you'll wanna fight him yourself, and the heroes will make you wanna strap up and go to bat with them. Overall Glass Fleet is a solid anime. I'd say that my only complaint is the sick little pervert that always follows Vetti, the bad guy, around everywhere. He's pretty sickening. Glass Fleet will probably be a good addition to your collection. It's not a bad price either.",1355270400,,975,4.4525139664804465

While this series lost me fairly early, the inclusion of new characters and development has created new potential. With the second half building to a new climax, audience members do have some kind of hope that the series will provide something worth the long drawn out build up. While this series has always strived to be the big anime space drama, all it's managed to be so far is pretentious.",1217980800,,447,4.730769230769231
