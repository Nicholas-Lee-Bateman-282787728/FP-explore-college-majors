8498426,4,B006HH61DA,"Andy Hardy (Mickey Rooney) has just graduated from high school in hometown Carvel.  Andy's father, Judge James K. Hardy (Lewis Stone), would like Andy to go off to college to study pre-law in the fall.  Since Andy's ex-girlfriend Polly Benedict (Ann Rutherford) is moving away, Andy is free to consider what he would like to do for the summer.  The answer is to move to New York City, find a meaningful job, prove that he can stand on his own two feet, and then decide what to do with his future.  A side benefit that his enthusiastic friend Betsy Booth (Judy Garland) will be in New York too.

Despite some nervousness in his family and proclaiming his adulthood, Andy drives away with Betsy and moves into City House - A Residence for Young Men.  Andy meets the previous resident of his room, an unemployed dancer, Jimmy Frobisher (Ray McDonald), who gives Andy a tip on a job opening at Consolidated Stocks & Bonds.  While waiting for his interview at CS&B, Andy meets an alluring switchboard operator, Jennitt Hicks (Patricia Dane).

During his stay in New York City, Andy is exposed to a wider range of behavior than one saw in Carvel.  Andy gets to see the effects of unemployment, the difficulty in getting a job, the subterfuges used to get by, a coded view of the gay sub-culture of the time, a despairing suicide (amended by the censors to an unlikely heart attack), gold-digging, and infidelity.  Betsy does keep trying to help Andy.  By the time Judge Hardy comes for a visit, Andy has a greater appreciation for the simplicity of Carvel life and for the value of steady work.  (The movie came out in 1941, just before Pearl Harbor, after which there was lots of work to go around.)

The Warner Brothers DVD-R has a sharp picture for the black & white MGM film and a clear sound track.  Judy Garland does not sing this time.  There are no sex or skin scenes, although Andy and Jimmy Frobisher do appear in their underwear.  The language is squeaky clean.  Judge Hardy gives a concise speech on the value of pre-marital abstinence.  Lewis Stone and Ray McDonald had the most memorable performances.  The movie times out at 101 minutes.  The only extra is the film's trailer, which calls this the best of the Andy Hardy series.  ""Life Begins for Andy Hardy"" certainly relates well to the current economic condition and has probably aged better than most of the series.",1336867200,4,2378,4.641148325358851
