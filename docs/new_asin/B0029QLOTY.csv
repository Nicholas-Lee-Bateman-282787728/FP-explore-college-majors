8358058,1,B0029QLOTY,"The over $50.00 asking price for this VHS Video is a joke.

I have already purchased Volumes one to five for $5.99 each.  A Google Search will provide numerous titles with prices ranging from $14.99 to 19.95 for both the VHS and DVD versions.  The content of the Barrett Back Shop Videos should not be disregarded because of these ""Rip Off"" merchants who seek to overcharge a buyer.

The Barrett VHS Videos are clear and concise for those who want to learn how to repair Antique Trains.  Go to Google or E Bay for a much better price.  Jim Barrett's own web site sells these VHS and DVD videos NEW for about eighteen dollars. E Bay from time to time has some volumes listed for as little as $1.99 plus a nominal shipping charge.

It's too bad Amazon tolerates this kind of gauging by its sub merchants.",1349568000,,802,4.414965986394558

JIM BARRETT IS ONE OF THE BEST LIONEL TECHS IN THE BUSINESS.

This issue includes: MU YOU'RE LIONEL DIESELS, STOP SLIDING SHOW CARS FROM DERAILING ON SWITCHES, MAKE SLIDING SHOE OPERATING CARS OPERATING WHERE YOU WANT THEM, TUNE UP LIONEL SMOKE UNITS, REPLACE WORM ZW ROLLERS & POWER CORDS, 60 MINUTES IN LENGTH.

I found it very interesting even for topics I was not interested in, this is a great video for anyone planning to buy old Lionel trains, repair them and sell them for profit. (I repaired a ZW I found at a garage sale and sold it for 100 dollar profit, THANKS JIM!!)",1244160000,2,618,4.558558558558558
