8541586,1,B009H3LOFQ,The question is what does tarantino's movies have to do with the real DJANGO (Franco Nero). tarantino was a fan of the real django and other spaghetti westerns. Tarantino made 2 movies with Django in the title TSUKIYAKI WESTERN DJANGO and DJANGO neither having anything to do with the original. Im pretty sure there are 2 original DJANGO movies with FRANCO NERO. NONE OF THESE LOOK LIKE IT.,1370908800,10,390,4.75

There are some films that are so badly transferred that you cannot literally see what is happening. BOOT HILL is one of the worst distributers of films on DVD!!! Don't waste a penny on any of their products!!!!",1361923200,16,363,4.870967741935484
