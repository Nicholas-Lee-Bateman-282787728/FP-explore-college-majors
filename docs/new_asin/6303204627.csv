606475,5,6303204627,"This is one of my all-time favorite mini series. The cast is first-rate and the story is classy, heart-felt and poignant. I dare anyone to watch this and not think of people they grew up with. It is all about thanking the ones that influenced us along the way. Sometimes it takes growing up to really appreciate our childhood and the unsung people who made an impression on us back then and even now. The fact that this is out-of-print is a tragedy. Everyone should be able to experience this masterpiece.",1270512000,5,505,4.56043956043956
606476,5,6303204627,"But in the meantime this can ONLY be found on a Out Of Print (And expensive) VHS (Video Tape). Like the Movie ""Sparkle"" there was NEVER a Soundtrack Album released???? BOTH would be nice (Even in CD Format). A First Class Movie that is well deserving of being released on DVD Format. Strange there wasn't even a sequel....It's still not too late to gather these great actors to do a 2010 sequel.....Something SOMEONE should think about. This is worth hunting down...Just make sure you save your $$$$ because the one's (VHS Videos) that's floating around are NOT cheap (Even in used condition).",1194825600,11,593,4.823529411764706

7841748,5,6303204627,"This mini series was based on the novel by John Williams, a native of Syracuse NY. Melvin Van Peebles adapted it into a screen play that was turned into the mini series. Long story short, Mr. Van Peebles took a few liberties for dramatic purposes, by changing the characters around. I know this to be true because Mr. Williams was wrote the novel based on his relationship growing up, and being mentored by my father. While the family enjoyed the series, but my father didn't like the fact that he was portrayed as a drinker and womanizer. Especially since he and my mother were married nearly 56 years until her death in 1990. For years I've tried to find this on DVD, VHS, etc. so I can pass it down to my children and grandchildren. If anyone knows where I can find it at a reasonable cost, let me know.",1422316800,,806,4.38
7841749,5,6303204627,"Why, why, why isn't this movie available in a DVD???  I saw this when it first aired many years ago and loved it.  A great story acted by attractive, talented actors.  Seems to me that someone owns the rights and for whatever reason is refusing to allow a DVD.  Very sad, because I know I would buy it and judging by comments here and on imdb others would also buy.  Keeping my fingers crossed that someone will come to their senses and release the DVD SOON!",1404604800,,458,4.27906976744186
7841750,5,6303204627,"I first seen this movie when I was very young and I thought at the time that me and my friends would grow up and be just like these guys because we all played on a football team together like the guys in the movie did as kids. Years go by and I didn't think much about this movie nor do I remember seeing in rerun on television...at all. One day I was at a book store and I bought a book called  THE JUNIOR BACHELOR SOCIETY BY JOHN ALFRED WILLIAMS....and while I was reading this book I realized that it was made into a movie. So after I finished the book I went a hunt to fine the DVD or Blueray. But that hunt ended really quick after I realized that it was never released on DVD or Blueray. Still I wanted to see this movie so I looked for it on the internet first and then at a LOCAL GOODWILL STORE.  The funny thing is...on the internet it was almost $40 plus for a VHS, but I found it at the GOODWILL for $0.49!!!!! for both VHS cassettes!!!

The story is pretty much simple, friends as kids, friends grow up and lose touch with one another, friends grow up to lead very different life styles and careers, friends decide to get together and honor the coach who was like a dad to them years later, friends stand together to help one of the ""Gents"" out.

For this to be a early 1980's released move, the storyline was still pretty relevant to relationships and friendships of today so don't be surprise if it makes u want to call up some old friend (or look for them on facebook) and catch up.

The greatest part of this movie is all of the actors/actresses in this classic mostly African American cast. It was amazing to see whom would pop up on the tv screen next.  Some of which are no longer with us, but I remembered them from other movies/tv shows that I've seen them in.

So if you can't find it on the internet or at a resale shop......you can always just read the BOOK!!!",1385078400,7,1884,4.145205479452055
