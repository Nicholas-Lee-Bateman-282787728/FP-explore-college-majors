5738452,1,B00CT1MJHU,"Since this doesn't include the original music it's a complete deal breaker. I can't imagine how the creators, producers, and editors feel about the soul of their show being sucked out of it. Yes, less money. Less entertainment too. Why bother?",1378425600,29,243,4.951219512195122
5738453,1,B00CT1MJHU,"Every once in a while a TV program comes along that stands out, way out, from the mediocrity of normal television. This was one such program. When this series first aired I made a point to not miss a single episode, it was that good. It was and still is a breath of fresh air in a world of mindless/mediocre TV programming that seems to be getting worse and worse as time goes on. I was greatly disappointed when the series was canceled after they had just started a new storyline. Even if the series were to be revived now it would probably be dumbed down to meet executives demands of what the American public should be allowed to see. It seems that the vast majority of TV is made to appeal to the lowest common denominator of society and the rest of us are left out. Consider the world of 'Idiocracy', harsh but that seems to be the way entertainment is going in this country.

  Northern Exposure deserves a 5+ star rating but I give this PARTICULAR collection one star because of the decision to replace the original music. As another reviewer noted the original music gave the series a soul that was as much a part of the show as the storyline was, and I agree wholeheartedly. I was hot to purchase this set but canceled it after reading about this issue. People who go ahead and purchase this collection won't know what they are missing and that ignorance is what the executives are counting on to sell an inferior product.

  Update: I decided to take a look at the Individual Season sets and it seems that they too have had their music scores ""castrated"" because of outrageous music royalty costs. We can thank the music industry greed for that. One person who reviewed Season 1 & 2 (Robert Moore) noted that to include all the original music in the episodes would probably drive the cost of just one Season to $100 or more. I guess for me the original series will just be a fond memory unless those royalty fees are brought down to a more reasonable level. But the music industry lobbyists will make sure that doesn't happen. And the Government will say ""Yes Sir, anything you want Sir!"". The show just isn't the same without the original music.",1378425600,75,2156,4.473282442748092
5738454,1,B00CT1MJHU,"The original Northern Exposure was a wonderful series that transported the viewer to a fully realized, truly original, charming and quirky world.  But the Northern Exposure depicted in this DVD set, with the original music replaced by royalty-free muzak is like entering an elevator in a medical building - sterile and soulless.  The original music was a vital component in bringing Cicely, Alaska to life, it's what gave the town its quirky character and atmosphere.  By replacing the original music with generic, royalty-free muzak, that atmosphere has been muted, that quirky feeling is no longer there and a great deal of the show's charm is missing.  As another reviewer stated, the re-built DVD set is missing its soul.  As much as I loved the show, I can't recommend this castrated version.  Much like The Wonder Years, they ruined the DVD set with muzak.",1378425600,46,862,4.993006993006993
5738455,2,B00CT1MJHU,"I was happily planning to order this set until I found out the music is not the original.  Darn, no complete set for me.  If a reasonably priced set with original music is ever offered, I'll be happy to purchase.",1378425600,25,212,4.275
5738456,2,B00CT1MJHU,"(I have been reading other posts, and doing some searching - Some of the songs ARE intact - I wanted to post this at the front of my earlier posting.)
I was ready to purchase this new all-in-one collection of one of finest television shows ever.  Despite the plot games played after Joel left.  (Thought: why didn't Maggie follow him in an episode as well constructed as the one where Joel found his desired dwelling place?  Answer: because the actress didn't want to leave the show.)
The reviewer SG makes all the cogent points.  The music WAS a character in the show, and, for those who saw the show when it debuted its partial deletion (and reduction to muzak) is too low a blow to overcome.  Some viewers won't feel this way of course.
When season one came out 10 years or so ago the cost for that season was $60.  Royalty fees are high.  After that release royalty-free music replaced all those well considered songs that made the show so rich in character.
I don't think we will ever get the show at its best unless we vote with our dollars.  Maybe the bluray can get it right.  Hope so.",1378425600,46,1093,4.398009950248756
5738457,2,B00CT1MJHU,"I personally find these 'rebuilt' shows off-putting.

If it is labeled from the start what it IS and IS NOT, at least there is honesty--then you simply decide for yourself.

But this practice of removing original music and subsituting something else is simply deceptive.

And in a show such as Northern Exposure, the simple fact of the matter is the soundtrack is practically a character in the show.

Would 'Miami Vice' be ok if they swapped out all the Jan Hammer music for a Kenny G clone and Phil Collins', 'In the Air Tonight', was substituted with Bobby Goldsboro singing, 'Honey'...?

I mean, obviously, it's not the End Of The World.

But it's wrong, it's deceptive, and for me it ruins a great deal of the mood of the show as I know music was--in the original broadcast episodes--as carefully selected as the wardrobe.

I loved every episode of that show until Rob Morrow left. But I won't buy it in a CENSORED version.",1378425600,101,928,4.621951219512195
5738458,4,B00CT1MJHU,"If you spend time on amazon you know they love to do collections like this. They take all of the DVD seasons currently available and they strap them together to give you every episode ever at a pleasantly discounted price.

Pros
- all content from the previously released seasons are here
- picture quality is excellent
- despite their only being 5 boxes you will get all six seasons ( seasons one and two are in one DVD set)
- the biggest and most obvious pro is that you get to watch all 110 episodes
- no known issues related to double sided discs
- all extras from original season are included such as deleted/extended scenes. There are even some extras highlighting lot lines that were dropped from the show. Also expect the occasional gag reel.

Cons
- ****the biggest and most noticeable con is that with this set you will NOT get the original music from the series. The music has been switched out for royalty free music. This is not the end if the works but you will real a lot of negative reviews due to this. It kinda feels like the soul has been sucked out if the show. If you watch a lot if old shows you will be used to this. See the Wonder years on Netflix for similar disappointment.
- the fluffy parkas are included. This was only part of the original separate season 1 and season 2 separated sets.
- the messenger bag packaging is not included
- small con episodes are on double sided discs. I have not head of any issues with this particular set but double sides discs in the DVD community can sometimes lead to issues from cheap production.

This is a fantastic collection and is far cheaper than buying the individual seasons. If you know you love this show then you will love this bundle. If you have never watched this show then you will hopefully enjoy the quirky look at a small town.

If stock, royalty free music turns you off you might not want this set but this may be your only chance at ever owning these episode as it appears unlikely that universal is going to pay out for the complete original music. Happy viewing.

Edit: after rethinking it I have lowered my review to 4 stars. I have been swayed by others and I feel they are right that the music Is important to the main storyline of the show. I couldn't stand to give this less than 5 originally because the core product is so good. Four stars does seem fitting as some of the emotional weight of the show as the radio portion is stunted to the point where you are likely to have less enjoyment of the product.",1378425600,232,2499,4.342612419700214

5738475,4,B00CT1MJHU,"For years I avoided buying this series on DVD because of the very kinds of people and reviews you see listed as ""most helpful,"" meaning, people who complain about some of the music being different for the DVD release than the original TV episodes, and who make it out to be the biggest deal in the world, or at least a deal-breaker. How many of these people have even seen the DVD episodes?? Anyway, at some point, this set went on sale, and I decided to just go for it. I am into Season 4 now, and can say with utter confidence that the music changes do not negatively effect the show enough to avoid watching it on DVD. Not. Even. Close. I think there has been maybe one scene in the whole series thus far that was a little weird, and it wasn't even that big of a deal. Here's the truth: after finishing almost every episode, I say, ""I can't believe I waited so long to get this on DVD!"" I am writing this review for the people out there who, like me, have been avoiding buying this, and, if they actually got it, would be happy they did.

If you're the kind of person who believes in throwing the baby out with the bathwater, then, by all means, keep complaining, keep turning people off from this DVD set, and avoid it to your own detriment. But if you are able to chill out about a few scenes (out of hundreds?) being slightly different (and many of us might not even remember what the exact original music was anyway...), then just get it and enjoy. The video quality isn't stellar, hence only 4 stars, but it's WAY better than the bootleg copies floating out there with the original music. Having seen both, I'd take this DVD set over those copies any day, no hesitation.",1406505600,4,1678,4.310126582278481

5738479,5,B00CT1MJHU,"I watched the series as it came out, then watched it again on Netflix, so decided to go ahead and buy whole thing when it was on sale.  Can't wait to watch it again.  I'm not a huge fan of Rob Morrow, but the combination of actors playing the characters is perfect.  Most of the characters are so lovable and easy to relate to.  The inclusion of Native American characters and their culture is refreshing.  The scenery is fantastic.  Lots of pine trees, mountains, weather, rundown old buildings, small town life in the rugged northwest.  The plot, interaction of characters and life twists and turns involve one from the very beginning.  The intro  music and scenes are addictive.  Great stories.",1392681600,,697,4.733333333333333

The intelligent yet quirky characters and their antics will make you laugh, and the scenery is absolutely gorgeous (even though the show wasn't actually filmed in Alaska).

5738536,5,B00CT1MJHU,I have to say that I fell in love with this show a long time ago. Haven't watched all the episodes but I will now. I know that some of the original music maybe missing from the DVDs but to be honest the story lines and episodes/acting just can't be missed and I really appreciate the opportunity to spend $60 bucks in exchange for hours of entertainment and feel good story lines and enjoyment.,1378771200,6,394,4.337837837837838
5738537,5,B00CT1MJHU,"I have the earliest edition of the NE bundle, and I have to tell you that the music issue everyone is having is not an issue for me, and all my discs play the music. Fact is, by the time I get to the third season, the music drives me up a wall!!! I immediately grab the remote control to fast forward it. Think about it, folks. What catchy song(s) play on in your head for hours, sometimes days after hearing it a few times?

That being said, I am extremely happy about the bundle, it is intact in every other way. When I saw that cheezy bag they were selling, the first thing I thought was, ""Oh geez, they've probably cut the show up bad."" Yuck. The only time I ever wanted a cheezy cover for my DVD bundle was for Ed Wood's set of ""Plan Nine from Outer space"" and ""Glen or Glenda."" It came in a bright furry, hot pink box! I loved it.:)

So here's the point. It's not Amazon doing this, it's a choice made by the companies that lease the license from the original entertainment corps that make the shows, in this case, Universal is selling off the leases. To whom, I don't know, but my set came intact, so it must have happened a few years after. I'm sure you know this isn't the only time it happens. It's happening all over. ""Bosom Buddies"" ""Wonder Years,"" 3rd Rock from the Sun,"" (The companies purchase the rights for the songs for the length of their running, but then they pass that charge on to the DVD mills and THEY choose what they want to pay for.
They're also the movie hacks who cut minutes out of the show so it'll cut costs on copying and distribution.

Then you have great movies like ""Love at First Bite,"" where it never occurred to the movie makers that a particular song could actually be the driving force behind a movie. Then the singing artist says, ""Hey, we need to renegotiate,"" but the industry says, ""Nah, bite me."" I hope enough people don't buy the DVD, or that someone will figure a way to put it back on there. I've been checking to see if any of the VHS's have the original song on it, but haven't found it yet.

So, what I do now is check out how many different distributors are selling or have sold a particular show that I really want, and then I compare the DVD's minutes to each other and the original. And I'll even go so far as to call them and ask, because sometimes they tell you. If that doesn't work...go to your search engine and type, ""Has such-n-such dvd or bundle been altered since syndication (tv). Because if it has, then you can be sure there going to be something missing on the DVD you want to buy. Meanwhile, for the ones that need to be captured immediately, like ""Community,"" I didn't hesitate. I know what's coming, and so I bought each season, and will continue to do so, because 1) they're pretty inexpensive, and 2), once they get to the third and fourth leasing, it's gonna suck bad. I shutter to think what they'll do to ""LOST"" in about 3 years, which is why I'm probably going to take the hit and buy whole thing this Christmas.

Oh, btw, don't forget that you can sometimes buy the original from the original creator website, but anymore you'll have to ask the same questions.:)

Sincerely,
One of the few who managed to grab a truly complete set.

P.S. Still trying to find the truly COMPLETE WKRP in Cincinnati, but I'm losing hope.",1378684800,,3299,4.302737520128824
5738538,5,B00CT1MJHU,"I give my stars based on the quality of the show that I remembered.  I just ordered this today.

I wanted to address the song issue though.  I can understand, and respect, the point of view that not having all of the songs (from what I am reading most are there, but a few have been replaced) is a deal breaker for them.  Everyone is entitled to an opinion and personal taste and I am not going to judge.

But some of the comments, like calling the companies unethical or greedy or similar because of this is crossing the line.  If you want to blame anyone look in the mirror.  The companies would gladly include every single note if enough of us would pony up the difference that it would cost to make up the difference of what this set costs and what it would cost if they included every song.  But obviously not enough of us would buy the thing if they offered it to make it worth their while to do that.

The set is pretty expensive as it is.  Retail is $180, it normally is $130, and for today it is a bargain at under $10 a year, a penny under $60.  Instead of celebrating we hear about how greedy and unethical the company is.  Personally I had been wanting this set for a long long time.  They do not even show this here on reruns and I like watching series like this in order anyways.  But at even the amazon discount prices it was costly.  If they shaved a few songs off to keep it affordable, Hallelujah.  I could care less, because if the regular price at $130 was pricy I can only imagine the price with all the original music.  $200?  $250?  Might as well be a million, as no way I am paying that for this.  Is it perfect?  No.  But it is good enough for most of us.  For those of you who have $250 or so to blow on perfection, well congratulations, but you are not the majority of us.  Obviously.  Because if you were then I have no doubt that $250 'perfect' set is what we would be offered.  But for me, I am happy with my $60 set missing a few songs.  Honestly, I doubt that I will even notice the difference.",1378425600,10,2026,4.1020408163265305
5738539,5,B00CT1MJHU,I can't believe all the negative comments about the music? I usually skip the beginning anyway. They didn't cut any of the show out and that's all I care about. It's still a wonderful show.,1378425600,4,189,4.428571428571429
5738540,1,B00CT1MJHU,"Deal breaker for me on the soundtrack.  I would want the original, each season on a disk and of course the original soundtrack. Nothing more to say.",1378425600,16,148,4.481481481481482
5738541,5,B00CT1MJHU,"C'mon people.  A bad review for virtually a handful of songs replaced?

I admit.  The soundtrack to Northern Exposure is important.  In some scenes, vital.  But the majority those scenes actually have the original music intact on these DVD's.  Off the top of my head I am thinking of Ed driving Joel to his first glimpse of Cicely to Richard Berry's ""Louie Louie."" Fleischman's dance with O'Connell to Etta James' ""At Last.""  Ed basking in the glow of possibly finding his estranged father while Nat King Cole sings ""When I Grow Too Old to Dream"" on KBHR.  The ice melts to the tune of ""DW Suite"" by Lindsay Buckingham.  Maurice and Hollings' Jack London-esque jaunt up to the mountains to bury an old deceased comrade, wrapped up with Willy Nelson's ""Hands on the Wheel."" ""Common Threads"" by Bobby McFerrin plays while a group photo is taken at a party Joel throws.  Maggie, recovering from an illness on her 30th birthday, accompanied by ""Happy  Birthday"" by Stevie Wonder.  One of my favorite scenes, the crane dance with Chris and Ed with a backdrop of Brian Eno and John Cale's ""Lay My Love.""  Chris Stevens' ode to light and Enya's ""Ebudae.""  I could go on.  All these songs remain intact on the DVD set.

The brilliance of this TV show was unprecedented, and in my opinion, we have not seen anything better since, well, season five.  It's worth buying, even with the few replacement songs.",1378425600,27,1396,4.679012345679013
5738542,5,B00CT1MJHU,"I am a huge collector of old and new shows on DVD. I know there are sometimes issues with music changes due to royalty rights which is really dumb in my opinion. OK I agree (Like these people did not make enough money on the show) but seriously does it really matter that much that all you people give negative reviews for such an issue. I mean first off do you all have such a memorable life that you remember what theme music was played in a show dating back 20 30 years. I just cant gather this. is it not fine we get the shows at least uncut and not chopped with different music? Who cares! I don't remember music played in the background for a show I watched last night
Why is this such a huge issue with everyone!!!!!!
Because of this and the negative reviews the companies releasing these shows see a lack of revenue from people not buying the sets because of music issues that the full series of certain shows or long lost never made it to DVD shows are not released because of this. I know I would rather have the show with different music than not have it at all !!!!",1378425600,18,1077,4.1826923076923075

I would rather just not see it again with my fond memories of how perfectly the music was chosen to match this quirky show than to watch it and be annoyed at every new music choice.

5738547,4,B00CT1MJHU,"This show popped in my head a few weeks ago and I actually did a search to see if it was on Amazon or Netflix streaming. Amazon must have remembered my search and tipped me off to todays gold box deal. It has unfortunately suffered the same fate as my favorite shows of all time ""The Wonder Years"" in that the soundtrack has been replaced with cheaper royalty music... however prior to the new music the wonder years was not available at all for the past 20 years other than brief showings on Ion so I was grateful to have them at all even with the new music and still enjoyed them. Yes its a bummer that the original music has been replaced and its not the same but its better than nothing...And at todays deal for about $.55 cents an episode you may regret not buying it... If you are feeling nostalgic for the music go buy the soundtrack for under 6 bucks...Would you rather the show vanish into oblivion? C'mon people!

8586003,5,B00CT1MJHU,"One of the best written series of the 90s.  Whenever I start to watch it, I can't stop till the last episode with Rob Morrow midway through the last season.  Then I have to stop, because the nose dive it takes after that boggles the mind.  His departure episode is brilliant, but it seems that after that the writers were lost, and instead of either closing up shop or allowing the show to find it's direction organically, they forced it in ways that felt unnatural,  Still worth the 95% brilliance.
As far as the complaints people have over the music changes, if you didn't take notes during the original run, you are not likely to notice.  The replacement songs may not be quite as perfect, but they are still very good under the budget restraints that affect many moves to DVD.  Number one, this show is about it's writing, acting, and stunning landscape; and all of those you still get along with a solid soundtrack.",1425772800,11,920,4.545454545454546
