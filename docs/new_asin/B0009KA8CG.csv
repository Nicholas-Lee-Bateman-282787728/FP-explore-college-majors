8443616,5,B0009KA8CG,"I watched this many years ago when I was about the same age as the kids in the show.  Sure, some of it is pretty awful and it loses itself back and forth between being a kids show and an adult's, but it's a fun, campy romp with some pretty original ideas and a certain faithfulness to the original story by Stoker and European vampire mythos.  Geordie Johnson makes for a very handsome Dracula, IMHO, and the location where it was filmed couldn't be more beautiful.  I would love to see this picked up again with Geordie back in the lead and a more focused script team behind the wheel.",1179360000,2,586,4.3090909090909095
