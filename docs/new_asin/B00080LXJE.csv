8055018,3,B00080LXJE,"While clearly not Elvis' greatest film, there are some nice moments with Mary Tyler Moore playing a modern Catholic nun. The action is supposed to take place in lower Manhattan, New York, but it was filmed creatively on the studio backlot (several street scenes look authentic but are faux). Elvis' song ""Rubberneckin'"" had been mostly lost to public view since 1968; only until its remixing and modernizing in 2002 did it reach a large audiencelong after the singer's death. I gave it a personal ""3 stars"" although probably it's a film that only hard core Elvis and Tyler Moore fans will enjoy.",1399939200,,595,4.8431372549019605

8055020,5,B00080LXJE,I saw this movie many years ago and have been wanting to own a copy ever since.  I have always loved Elvis Presley and like Mary Tyler Moore also.  The movie is a refreshing change from today's movies and was a refreshing change in acting for both of these people.,1357171200,,264,4.26
8055021,5,B00080LXJE,"If you know Elvis movies, you know they were exploitation vehicles. If you know the Elvis cult, you know there is the good or bad Elvis. But if you know film, you would know that ""Change of Habit"" is a unique Elvis movie in several ways, including the fact that -- having expired his contract -- Elvis had a lot of latitude to be who he really was, and to be supportive of causes (sociological and otherwise) that he really hadn't had the freedom to do in the past. In this movie, if you want to look for a change agent, see Elvis supporting Mary Tyler Moore in her role as a nun. Not many nuns have the chance of learning how to play the guitar to the tune of ""Lawdy, Miss Clawdy."" Elvis' humor is ever-present for those who wish to look.",1288656000,,739,4.174825174825175
