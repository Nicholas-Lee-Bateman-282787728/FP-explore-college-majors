7799943,5,1598034200,Wonderful look into a very difficult area of mathematics by a very likeable Professor.,1525132800,,86,5.214285714285714
7799944,5,1598034200,Well done.  It opened my eyes to see more when dealing with numbers.,1490227200,,68,4.230769230769231
7799945,4,1598034200,"Love the excellent and articulate content. I am a fan of Dr. Burger's many math videos (I'm a math teacher) but in this series, he is so obviously reading the material, it's a bit distracting to watch -- I think I'd prefer just reading the finely crafted text.",1438992000,5,260,4.4375
7799946,5,1598034200,"Loving math as I do, these lectures were a fascinating journey for me.  They were math intensive of course,  but told in a way that a non math person could enjoy and shows the breakthroughs in this field that we take for granted in our everyday life.  If you love numbers, then this is or you.",1411862400,6,293,4.196428571428571
7799947,5,1598034200,"If you have an interest in Number Theory and even if you think you do not, you should watch this series.  Assuming basically no math knowledge beyond elementary school, Professor Edward Burger will lucidly and excitingly, even sometimes humorously  gently guide you thru number theory. For example what do the music scale, Towers of Hanoi, beautiful rectangles, and computer encryption  have in common ? They are all part of number theory. Become amazed at  mind boggling and unbelievable hidden structure in numbers. It will be proved to you, you will see it demonstrated with actual numbers, yet it is so magical you may not still believe your own eyes or be able to wrap you mind around it. Thank you so much Professor Burger for enriching my life.",1330905600,8,751,4.84375
7799948,5,1598034200,"This course is presented from the very basic number theory fundamentals to the more advanced concepts.  It is extremely well done and has enhanced my understanding of the subject condsiderably,",1319673600,7,193,5.433333333333334
7799949,4,1598034200,This is a fascinating Teaching Company offering. It is structured more as entertainment than as teaching a specific subject. I recommend it highly. It may pique ones interest in learning more about the subject.,1269734400,5,210,5.205882352941177
