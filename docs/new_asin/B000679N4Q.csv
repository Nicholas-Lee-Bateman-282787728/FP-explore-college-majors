We were inspired to do so, after learning that Trey Parker and Matt Stone did something similar when their commentaries were not included on the SOUTH PARK DVD.  We believe it'll be worth the trouble,CHUD.com had this to say about our tracks:

""This is one of the better commentary tracks out there. The uncomfortable pauses that usually plague these things are almost nonexistent and what these gentleman have to say is actually interesting.""

We hope you enjoy the film.",1104192000,19,692,5.026315789473684
8039546,5,B000679N4Q,"Still trying to figure out why I enjoyed this film so much. It dealt with some pretty heavy issues. But while the film certainly stayed with me, I found the subject matter thought-provoking rather than distasteful. Inheritance explores an extreme--what happens to a pair of siblings who suffered child abuse and who did not get any help--and it considers how the effects of that abuse might trickle into their adult relationships and how they would have to work to overcome them. That it dealt with such an extreme made it fairly gripping. I felt like Id journeyed into a dark underside of the human psyche and reemerged with a more empathetic understanding of what it would mean to be an abuse survivor. I found it intriguing, psychologically rich and arresting. It reminded me of The Celebration, that Vinterberg classic, but with a better setting. The visuals and the score were outstanding and the acting was convincing.

Im confused . . . some of the reviews on here seem to be for a different movie--a sci fi horror movie.",1524614400,,1028,4.775280898876405
8039547,5,B000679N4Q,"All the previous comments are for a different movie. 'Inheritance' by Laura E. Davis and Jessica Kaye (also starring) is a masterpiece of incredible intensity and power. Raw, erotic, violent, uncompromising - the kind of film that should win all the awards instead of Hollywood drivel celebrated today.",1515283200,,302,5.3125
8039548,1,B000679N4Q,Don't waste your money on this movie . BAD,1512345600,,42,3.7777777777777777
8039549,2,B000679N4Q,"Don't waste a Netlfix spot for this one. If you catch SyFy or Chiller on a slow Saturday, give it a shot. The acting, for the most part, is more than decent, especially the two leads (Jen Taylor and Carter Roy) but the film is really, really brought down by the terrible music. The real star of the film is the gorgeous home that's the primary set. Just beautiful. The movie isn't complete turkey, though. More like squab sized.",1304035200,,428,4.430379746835443
8039550,2,B000679N4Q,"I found the movie to be rather slow and boring.  The possession of the girl wasn't horrifying or even creepy.  Infact, I must say I preferred her new hair style to the old.  I didn't find her visions of ghosts creepy but rather cheesey; that is if she was really seeing them.  From the back of the movie box it is stated is she really being possessed or is she just insane...so I guess it depends on which way you want to view the movie.",1294444800,3,437,4.105882352941176
8039551,5,B000679N4Q,"I just watched ""Inheritance"" this evening and really enjoyed it. I was surprised at the beginning due to there being no lens filter (it felt strange) but oddly enough, I started to enjoy the stark look - it was quite out there and actually made the film scarier.

If you decide to see this film, it would be unfair to judge it against big production movies. This is an independent film and I think it does a great job for what it is. Marjorie Nelson's character was positively creepy and Jen Taylor was believable and likable.

If you want something fresh, different and definitely scary, then you can't go wrong with this film.",1263340800,,628,4.548672566371682
8039552,5,B000679N4Q,this was pretty good ghost story i liked it a lot.no amityville horror but still worth  a watch. has its moments..,1233532800,,114,4.428571428571429
8039553,3,B000679N4Q,"""Inheritance"" is not a great horror movie.  At all.  The "" impressionable young woman inheriting the mantle of the demented old evil coot in the musty house"" motif has been done much better in many different films.  (""Burnt Offerings"", a neglected cult classic, comes to mind).

On the other hand, there's nothing wrong with watching a director pull off some really creepy moments now and then: in this genre which has nearly been buried by special effects and remake after remake, it's mildly entertaining to see someone go for something homegrown and sort of original.

As well as being a curious kind of warning to the young about the elderly, the psychic terror wrought by the cruel old Mrs. Baker (played with a gleaming, believable ferocity by Marjorie Nelson) on Jen Taylor's ever suffering Abbie Nelson is something to see: in the end, it is Abigail's good will which damns her and has her dressing up like Mrs. Baker, talking like Mrs. Baker in most inappropriate settings and times; eventually even getting in the most imprudent habit of sleeping with Mrs. Baker bedside doctor, whom Mrs. Baker found ""handsome and striking"".
The best part of this film is the ending, which I won't reveal: let's just say the director did not ruin the film entirely and throws a punch of excellence by not taking the easy way out.  Worth a rental for starved horror fans, definitely.",1218931200,,1376,4.809322033898305
8039554,3,B000679N4Q,"I don't understand the high ratings for this film. It reveals its low budget although the acting is acceptable, the directing okay, the story is alright... but in general that's all it is, this film is ""OK"", not great or wonderful. Maybe those who don't watch the better horror or suspense films are awed by this one but in context I'd rather see the third Exorcist film.  This film is categorized as horror but is only a mildly-interesting suspense story.  It doesn't compare with other B-grade films such as the second Blair Witch, or Ginger Snaps, or Uncovered.  Or for a more direct comparison, The Innocents. I should give this film 1 star in an attempt to bring down the overall rating but instead I will give it what it deserves, 3 stars.  Recommend that you only rent it and save your money.",1176854400,4,799,4.566433566433567
8039555,5,B000679N4Q,"I thought it was thoughtful and imaginative...an overall really good movie. It was also nice to see Jen Taylor competently flex her acting ability beyond voicework for a certain AI construct xbox owners know and love. A must see, and a must own for fans of the genre.",1105660800,6,267,4.583333333333333
