8266328,5,B0017L50EM,"This is an awesome example of a slammin F5 show! It was recorded at a club called ""The Haunt"" in Ithaca, NY. One great thing about this band is that they are very approachable from a fan's standpoint, I was at this show and got to meet the whole band. It may be around the 5th song or so, that my own reflection is caught on David's mirror pickguard...that is unreal considering I've followed his bass style for over 20 years.",1208131200,,426,4.271604938271605
