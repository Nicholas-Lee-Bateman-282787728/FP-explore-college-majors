8387422,5,B0032EFQRI,"I gave this Collectors DVD 5 stars mainly for ""Razor Eaters"" and ""Hindsight"" ""Night of the livind Dead"" you should already have or seen, you already have your own opinion on that, ""Cruel World"" was your typical crazed slasher movie, but some how it was as cheesy as I thought it would be, and Jamie Presley.....  Well I don't have to say anything else, even tho shes not in it the whole movie.  But over all its a good DVD to add to the collection.  Be Easy",1283040000,,457,4.2298850574712645
