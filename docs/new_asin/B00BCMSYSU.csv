5578526,1,B00BCMSYSU,"I'm sorry to say, but the video was awful.  I knew the picture quality would be bad and expected as much, however the disk was bad and would freeze with multiple colored lines in it.  At first I thought it was the disk player, so I tried it on a different system and it did the same thing.  I was extremely disappointed as this was a gift for my father.  He is disabled and the only enjoyment he gets would be from listening to the radio and/or watching TV.  Verfy disappointed.",1416614400,14,478,4.208791208791209
5578527,4,B00BCMSYSU,"Was given to my father for his birthday. We watched some of it with him, and it's good but not terrific. Arrived in good condition.",1415491200,6,131,4.28
5578528,5,B00BCMSYSU,For a birthday present,1407110400,,22,4.75
5578529,5,B00BCMSYSU,"I was a very small kid when I first saw Red Skelton on our television set.  I giggled at his funny faces and even as a child, I understood his humor.  His performances are timeless and worth a watch whenever you want to giggle and laugh.  Next comedy DVD I want is the Carol Burnett show.  Enjoy!",1395360000,5,296,4.140350877192983

5578543,1,B00BCMSYSU,"Avoid this.  It's very poorly mastered and transferred.  Audio quality is very lacking.  The picture has a good deal of jutter, and very little effort was done not only to remaster/clean up the originals, but just to do basics like luminescence balance.  Some scenes are so dark and muddy you can't make out Red's face.  Or cropping (some scenes have a 5-10% black strip on more than one side, or show the edge of the original filmstock--that's an easy fix that just shows the laxity and shoddiness of the digital producers).  I also don't like how they replaced his original music with a silly banjo tune.  I understand why they did (content licensing), but it really does detract from the Red Skelton experience.  The DVDs are also mastered at very low quality, and a good deal of digital noise and compression artifacting shows up.  Really poor job.  Not worth even the little money I paid for it.  Spring for the more expensive TIME-licensed collections.  It's worth it.",1482624000,,974,4.766467065868263
