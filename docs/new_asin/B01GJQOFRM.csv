7761975,4,B01GJQOFRM,"Silly little piece of nothingburger owned me.  Hate to confess on this one -- how low of an achiever can a film be and still get over my ""enjoyed it bar?"" This one gets four stars for dragging me along for the whole thing.  Seen on Netflix dvd.  It had enough budget to suss out the production to a decent B movie level.  If all B movies were this nicely done, the A films would lose business.  That said, there's not much that's original in this film's anything from plot to costuming.  CGI was high schooler in his basement level.  Actors did their jobs as did many other departments.  There's hundred million dollar films that didn't grab me as well.  So I tip my hat to this one.

But oh boy it's 99.% trite -- everything stolen and not re-done as well.  Jokes were dead on arrival.  Plot was a 4 minute SNL skit stretched so artlessly that it could be reduced easily back to a four minute skit by even a writer of a failed infomercial. Okay, it was many failed infomercials.

But I watched it.

I'm sure everyone associated with the film made their parents proud.

But I watched it.

Gotta bow.

I really should rewrite this review to make it a five star rated film -- so that they're encouraged to do a sequel.  Which would be an especial treat not yet seen in all of history.

7-14-17 2nd viewing because I forgot to check to see if I'd reviewed and did remember anything about it.  My bad.  Big bad.  This thing's not worth that 4th star.....I'll leave it, but I got bothered so much by the stupidity of every single character.  The aliens were hardly any more ""sentient.""  Yes, I watched the whole thing again, there's that, but I took one for the team in order to give this film it's proper due.

Don't suggest this for anyone, but I watched it twice.  I haz confuz.",1472515200,,1776,4.306060606060606
7761976,3,B01GJQOFRM,"Lazer Team is a science-fiction comedy about four small-town Texas guys called upon to save Earth from alien invaders. When they stumble across an alien crash site containing an amazing battle suit, they realize it can be a formidable weapon against the enemy. With this new equipment genetically bound to them, and the government after them, the quartet have little choice but to work together as one to save humanity. All they have to do is learn to use a battle suit intended for one person, train to vanquish a powerful enemy, and not kill each other in the process. They are not strong and certainly not smart, but the hope of the world rests on their shoulders.

Herman (Colton Dunn) still holds a grudge against Hagan (Burnie Burns), that goes back to their high school football days. Hagan, now a local sheriffs deputy, is hostile toward Zach (Michael Jones) because Zach is dating his daughter. Woody (Gavin Free) is simply a general-issue nincompoop. Mutual cooperation is essential if they are to save the world.

The movie reminded me of the original Ghostbusters, but in that film, you had very talented comic actors with terrific chemistry and a good script. In Lazer Team, the personalities and talents of the four leads simply aren't enough to sustain the ha-ha factor. There are some mildly amusing scenes but too often the actors try too hard to milk laughs that never materialize.

Bonus features on the widescreen DVD release include deleted and extended scenes and bloopers. The film is also available in the Blu-ray format, with the same bonus features.",1471564800,,1575,4.891385767790262
7761977,5,B01GJQOFRM,"This movie is unexpectedly really funny.  Five guys who stumble across and alien ship crash, then try on separate pieces to a suit that goes on one person.  Together they have to learn how to work together.  It is pretty comical.  A sci-fi movie, but well worth the watch for a good laugh.  And, it is not packed with cuss words, only a few.",1471392000,2,341,4.265625

7762050,4,B01GJQOFRM,"Great movie, lots of potential for rewatches.

I'm a huge Rooster Teeth fan and have been trying to find time to watch this since it came out. Having finally done so, especially with Lazer Team 2 on the horizon, it surpassed my every expectation to the point that I plan to buy it on Dvd in addition to this digital version.

The movie is, obviously, a comedy and a somewhat campy one, but the production level is amazing given that it is the company's first full-length movie. If nerdy, funny, sci-fi is your thing, then this is definitely worth checking out.",1502409600,,560,4.534653465346534
7762061,5,B01GJQOFRM,"Well, bust my buttons! such a pleasant surprise. When four small-town losers stumble across an alien crash site containing an incredible battle suit, they soon find themselves responsible for the fate of the entire planet. What they didn't tell you in this brief description is that they caused the UFO to crash and the battle suit was supposed to be worn by Alan (the Perfect) Ritchson who has been trained literally from birth to handle the suit. Now the 4 miscreants each hold a piece of the suit and it has bonded to them. The 4 incompetents are Burnie Burns, Gavin Free, Michael Jones and Colton Dunn and they are terrific all of them. This is a Red Tube production and trust me when I say that I laughed a lot and enjoyed it tremendously, such silliness has to be rewarded. I really recommend this to any an all who love a good laugh and silliness.",1500508800,,854,4.480769230769231

7762063,5,B01GJQOFRM,"Great movie. Love RT.
but a lot of the scenes sounded too much like the actors had a script in their hands and were just reading from it, didn't sound fluent and normal.",1495670400,,169,4.151515151515151

7762066,5,B01GJQOFRM,Burnie Burns is the man he is a great actor and writer.  It may have got me hooked but the RT podcast watching Burnie Burns talking and seeing how he is down to earth and hasn't let success go to his head.  I can't wait for Lazer Team 2.,1492473600,,237,3.816326530612245
7762067,5,B01GJQOFRM,Great movie! I have been a fan of Rooster Teeth for a while and had to see the movie. It was funny and had a goofy spin to it which is what they do as well as what I like. Can't wait to see Lazer Team 2!,1490140800,,203,3.3404255319148937

7762081,5,B01GJQOFRM,"Being a Rooster Teeth fan, I love this movie! I was a little weary about it when they first came out with it but it worth a watch. It is definitely a funny movie and you don't have to be a fan to enjoy the movie.",1484611200,,212,3.630434782608696

7762084,2,B01GJQOFRM,"Another one of those false hero misleading hero movies. As soon as the army was waiting for the alien & fireworks going off, it was predictable of who our heros were, a cop, two douch drunk bags and a cocky teen, a parody movie stealing the choosen heros fate by four idiots
One has the glove, the other a arm cannon, not a sword. A helmet and boots
The movie then decides to trick us into thinking alien will fight them but instead we get yeerk like mind controlling things instead
Stupid corny jokes ruin the movie
They randomly decide the aliens want the armor instead of fighting, thats wrong
It came to fight
Not have a relationship
How they got famous online is super fake
Would never happen irl
The guy with the arm cannon can type perfectly
The army acting like jerks crushing a car
Not really mature or army like
Armor not working in stealth mode is a fail
At the end these losers win",1477267200,,893,4.321428571428571

7762087,3,B01GJQOFRM,"Lets get this out there first...this movie was made for the Rooster Teeth fans. Hell, they are the ones who backed this movie on Kick Starter. I myself am a RT fan but didn't back this movie. Not a fan of KS. If you are a RT fan then there is a good chance you will enjoy this movie and watch it again. I myself thought it was an ok movie. I don't plan on watching it again tho. My problem is the casting. Half the cast are professional actors the other half are part of the RT cast. And thats my problem, the RT cast isn't that great at acting. I couldn't buy who they where playing as cuz Ive seen them in so many RT videos that it was hard for me to buy into their acting. Once again, ok movie with ok acting. There will be a part 2 coming in the future and to tell the truth I won't be watching it.",1474502400,2,802,3.8373493975903616

7762090,4,B01GJQOFRM,"My son is a HUGE Rooster Teeth fan.  This means that he's subjected us to every season of Red vs Blue and all other Roost Teeth titles over and over and over.  Still, he was excited about this, the first live-action full-length Rooster Teeth movie.  I cringed.  However I must admit I was pleasantly pleased that this was actually a very enjoyable and re-watchable film, amusing and well done.  I particularly enjoyed trying to identify the actors by voice from their roles in Red vs Blue, and seeing the unexpected cameos (one of the band members from Barenaked Ladies plays a newscaster, and does the music for the credits).",1473638400,7,626,4.706422018348624

If you have a nice, calibrated theater, watch this film there.  Don't use your computer.

This is extremely impressive visually, with extremely subtle nuance.  You may be streaming, which isn't ideal, but at least use your good stuff to watch it.  I don't know if this movie is good or bad, but it gets five stars from me right off the bat, whether I enjoy the actual story or not.

There are hundred million dollar productions out there that don't manage light and shadow this well.  You're going to want to use your best display, and certainly your biggest.  I've got a calibrated 34"" ultrawide monitor attached to a computer with a $300 imported sound processor and 400 watts of amp, and I'm STILL bringing this to the theater room to watch.

Don't make the mistake of not using your best gear.  You know how you feel when you stream something you should have bought on disc...  Don't make the mistake of streaming this to a computer, when it could be sent to gear that can make the best of it!  Trust me on this.
