8307554,5,B001H03IZG,"This is one I have tried to find for years. Finally I did. To me it is excellent and science fiction at it's best. The series has many twists and turns what effects are used are done so very good and from the first episode until the last, each and everyone are excellent and at the end you are disappointed that it is not more to watch. If you enjoy Science Fiction then this is a must see. Every time I view it I see something I missed from the times before and I am not bored if viewing the series in it's entirety several times each year. Of all movies and seasonals of science fiction I have in my collection Charlie Jade is one which I would never part with. Watch it and post a review. I loved it and believe you also will if science fiction is what you enjoy. It is a must see. For me a must own.",1437264000,,803,3.962962962962963
8307555,5,B001H03IZG,"Charlie Jade is an awesome Sci-Fi movie. I firmly believe the reason is turned out so well is because Hollywood wasn't involved. Heck, I don't think Hollywood would have dropped a dime for this awesome series since it requires a good bit of thinking and paying attention to detail.",1384905600,2,281,4.755102040816326
8307556,4,B001H03IZG,You'll need an all region DVD player.  This one played fine on my computer.  It's more like a long movie divided into episodes than a TV series.  The actors are very convincing and it's surprising that Jeffrey Pierce and Michael Filipowich have not had more successful careers.  The ending is pretty weak; I heard an interview of the producers who said they ran out of money toward the end and did what they could on a shoestring budget.  But overall I would say it's a sci fi classic and belongs in any enthusiast's collection.,1373241600,,528,4.574468085106383
8307557,5,B001H03IZG,"You would not be reading this if you did not already know the story line, so just a few words on the quality.  I have a OPPO 95 but the video side is the same as the OPPO 93.  the conversion from pal to ntsc was seamless and the dvd played with no problem right out of the case.  The color and surround sound are really, really  good.  If you watched this on the SCi Fi channel you will be shocked at the vibrancy of the dvd, its almost like watching a new program.",1333929600,4,465,3.904255319148936
8307558,5,B001H03IZG,"Most people don't think of South Africa when they think of SciFi, but Charlie Jade, like the film District 9, is shot in S. Africa with excellent acting by both American and South African actors and good production values.  The story is very plot and character driven, and while the end of the season leaves you satisfied, it also leaves you a bit sad that you will not see these characters again- the show had one run back in 2005 and that was it.

The story revolves around a P.I., Charlie Jade, who is from a Blade-Runner-esque version of Cape Town called ""Cape City"" in the ""Alphaverse"".  After an incident with a corporate experiment to join the various parallel universes, he ends up in the ""Betaverse"", which is modern day Cape Town. The story follows his efforts to get back to his (stunning) girlfriend/concubine back home and his run ins with the coproration, Vexcor, that is responsible for the experiment.

I would have to say that the only SciFi TV series thats done better in terms of story in recent memory is Battlestar Galactica, so if I were making a top 10 SF TV list for the last decade, BSG would be #1 and Charlie Jade would be #2.",1315180800,9,1153,4.502392344497608
8307559,4,B001H03IZG,"Three universes are about to destroy each other, but Charlie Jade doesn't look like he can stop them as he doesn't have clue what is going on - luckily he's an extra tough PI who doesn't like being in the dark.  Having watched all of Charlie Jade on DVD I can see why it may have lost a lot of viewers in the rather chaotic first 8 episodes. However, past that point this series morphs in to very good viewing as the story starts to come together.  By the end of the season I was really sorry to know that there wouldn't be another season.

It's an odd series in that it is set in Cape Town in South Africa and must be the first African SciFi that I've seen.  Jeffery Pierce as the lead character Charlie Jade is both very watchable and charismatic.  He has the world weary PI down pat and I'm honestly surprised I haven't seen him more on TV.  Michael Fipowich  as 01 Boxer is a truly crazy-scary psycho and for most of the series the only world-walker  with a connection to all 3 universes that that form the background plot to this series.  He's someone who you go from hating to respecting (sort of) to wondering if you first impressions were correct after all. One of the more unlikely characters you'll meet on TV.

I recommend this series if you are interested in alternative universes or like movies like Blade Runner.  It's a shame there will never be a season 2 and season 1 does not wrap up all its plot threads completely but it's still a very interesting TV experience for those who like SciFi TV.",1247356800,11,1510,4.319148936170213
8307560,5,B001H03IZG,"This show is even better than when I viewed it on SciFi channel.  One of the few storylines meant for only a one season run.  Excellent in every way possible.
  You must have an all region dvd player to view it tho,  But the investment in said viewer will be worth it.",1246147200,4,268,4.076923076923077
8307561,5,B001H03IZG,"I took a chance on this DVD because i saw parts of it on the Scifi channel.
This is a totally awesome series with an actual end ( a rare thing!) The acting and effects (everything is good in it!) This is well packaged and of course you need an all region DVD player (I bought one because it plays all my DVD's better!) This is a great DVD to have in your collection.",1239062400,10,366,3.9594594594594597
