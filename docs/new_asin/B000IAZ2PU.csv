Is this DVD an introduction to tonal drawing ? No,  basics like tone, tonal scale, mid tone, tonal drawing, etc. etc. are not explained, within no time, a start is made with life model drawing, a portrait, with charcoal, behind an easel.
Is this DVD an introduction to life model portrait drawing ? No, there is no introduction on proces to draw a portrait, how to draw the parts of a portrait, etc. etc.

Anita just goes along doing her thing, not giving any real instructions, murmuring along the way, struggling with a tonal drawing, which in my opinion doesn't succeed. I think the tonal relationships are not correct, the likeliness it at best mediocre, the texture is off, etc. She works a very long time, the whole DVD, on just this one drawing, which isn't great.
All life model portrait drawing teachers I've had up till now, draw considerably better tonal portrait drawings and a lot faster.

If you have done an introduction to life model tonal portrait drawing before, you will probably already draw better then the drawing you see on this DVD.
If you haven't done an introduction to life model tonal portrait drawing up till now, then this DVD definitely is not the place to start.
In my view this DVD is a complete waste of time and money, I've kicked it into the bin.",1329955200,,1546,4.4522968197879855
