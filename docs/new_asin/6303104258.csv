7839259,4,6303104258,"Ok first off, this is a hentai. This show is about solving lifes little problems with adult relationships. I would like to say teen relationships, but this show is on adults. There are three episodes with 3 different situations. How to cope with finding a your first love, how to get back your boyfriend from a 20 year old so she says 'virigin' and how to settle a matter between multiple relationships. Some might not like the way in which these situations are carried out (I can't blame you for hating the first episode in which a 20 year old guy has his way with teenage girls), but what I love so much about this tape is that it is so close to the real world situations. The artwork isn't any Wings of Honneamise, but its ok. One of the main charcters in episodes 2-3 is Toyamo no Benbei. Boss/Game Freak/Fixer of Realtionships/BMW owner. Quite a guy. He basically helps out with all these relationships. If your struggling through a relationship in your life and need help on handling it, pick up this tape. It might give you some answers.",979948800,,1044,4.5
