7752181,4,B01FXM6VL6,"Great anime from the makers of, Black Lagoon. Although the story is a little dragged out, I'd still recommend it. The animation is up to par and the main character DOES carry the story but, what ultimately keeps it from achieving perfection is, the story never goes anywhere. Each episode is like a little chapter instead of one continuous story.",1473724800,3,346,4.783333333333333

8761777,5,B01FXM6VL6,Series does an excellent job of covering most backstory and has a non-cliffhanger ending.  Story is gritty and morally ambiguous but wonderful at the same time.  Similar to but not the same as Black Lagoon.,1507334400,2,206,4.857142857142857
