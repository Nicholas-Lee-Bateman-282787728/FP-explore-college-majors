Normally we don't watch the Extra Clips or Trailers after viewing a DVD, but in this case we did, almost as if in hopes to ""see more - see more"" - lol !  Definitely not a movie to watch with children...but I knew that when I purchased it, which made it even more of a treat for us adults to view.  I'd rate it an ""R"" and highly recommend it to open-minded adults who like a good laugh.",1368144000,4,563,4.008928571428571
5683393,5,B00C0KKJV8,"This movie has comedy and horror all mixed up in one! The characters are completely original and great!!! Had a party and we watched this movie as the highlight and all of my friends including me loved it! You can watch this movie over and over again! The acting was excellent and the picture quality was crystal clear! A very well done movie.  If you want to know how to make a delicious chocolate pudding pie, rid the world of child abusers, handle hypocritical frenemies than you must watch this movie! even if you don't want to learn any of the above and just want a great laugh watch this movie!!!",1367712000,4,602,4.423423423423423
5683394,5,B00C0KKJV8,"Trashology is a John Waters homage that gets it right. Funny, trashy, and unpredictable, this will remind you of films like Pink Flamingos, Female Trouble, and Desperate Living, with maybe a little Sordid Lives thrown in too. Beatrice was my favorite character. I'd like to see a crossover film with her as the lead character. If you are a fan of trashy independent comedies, definitely buy this one!",1366588800,3,400,4.897058823529412
5683395,5,B00C0KKJV8,"Nothing will be spoiled by reading this review. I mentioned scenarios and not actual scenes.**

Trashology is a tribute film to the man who gave us Hairspray and Pink Flamingos...Mr. John Waters,it isn't making a false claim. IT is what it says it is and so much more. Another reviewer has said that ""John Waters would be proud"" and yet another said it is a ""Love letter to John Waters"", these are not false statements to build hype...TRASHOLOGY is the MOTHER OF ALL TRIBUTE FILMS to the ideals and wicked sense of humor of Waters.

A would be ""Trash Cinema"" student filmmaker discovers a book called, ""Trashology"". The books consists of three short stories, that are brought to life by director Brian Dorton and cast of characters that will tickle your raunchy funny bone with hilarity,sex offender killers and so much more.

As soon as Trashology is released on DVD, I cannot urge you enough to rush out and buy it. For an Independent made comedy film, it is the best of its kind I have ever come across. It has a little bit of everything to make you gag and gasp for breath whether the use of a scent, devise, smothering or just walking in on a one legged woman having sex with a sex offender. It is a total shock n' awe film, that may not be for anyone offended by men dressed as women with huge boobs, oh and if talking about lesbian sex over ice cream offends you, then forget watching the making of the secret ingredient to Claudia's casserole, you won't be able to handle it. However, if you think you can hang with this unique and shocking film...grab your copy as soon as you can. If you have to have one guilty pleasure in life, let it be Trashology...it is totally one of mine! -Char Hardin/[...]",1364428800,3,1708,4.467948717948718
5683396,5,B00C0KKJV8,"Trashology is a new movie from director Brian Dorton, and what a fantastic FIRST feature film to start your filmmaking career with! Trashology is being labeled as a tribute to cult filmmaker John Waters. This movie is an anthology and it is made up into 3 stories if you don't count the wrap around segment.

THE VAT: segment one, is about a couple of elderly women. When a religious fanatic preaches her godly ways on the women, something happens, one of them dies, so they decide to bring them back. This segment was a riot! I absolutely loved the dialogue, score, and color scheme in this story.

BIG DEBBIE: segment two, is about a woman, Debbie, who is left at the alter on her wedding day. A couple of horny bastards see her, and pick her up for the wildest ride of her life! This segment has it all; squashing, oral sex on a coffee cake, murder, blackmail, and even a fantastic beheading!

INGLOURIOUS BITCHES: segment three, is about a quirky pair of female vigilantes, that use an app on a cellphone to track down and murder sex offenders. This story was by far the most trashy of the bunch, and it perfectly ends the film on a good note!

REACH AROUND: wrap around segment, is about a college student named Tracy. She has just received an assignment to write a report on her favorite film genre. In her research she discovers a book, now Tracy is taken into three interlocking tales of the unexpected.

I love how the stories tie into each other, and make references back and fourth. Definitely checkout Brian Dorton's Trashology! You won't be disappointed!

8576047,5,B00C0KKJV8,"I have to say, this movie is deliciously offensive. To me, it was funny on so many different levels. The type of humor ranges from shock, to slapstick, to clever, to disgusting and outrageous, and everything combined at once. It's just plain fun! I loaned my copy of Trashology to a guy at work & the next day asked him if he had watched it. He said ""Yeah, I watched it twice already."" He loved it! I was with a friend I hadn't seen in 23 years this past weekend & we watched it together & laughed so hard!! He thought it was brilliant, just like I did and do! I laugh just as hard no matter how often I watch it. You have to have a sick and inappropriate sense of humor to really enjoy this like I did but, if you do, you're lucky because this is messed up funny!",1487894400,,764,4.032894736842105
8576048,4,B00C0KKJV8,"This movie is fun! I loved the actors in their portrayal of their characters, very funny stuff!  I'm looking forward to more from this crew :)
Check this one out, people!",1463788800,2,170,4.483870967741935
8576049,5,B00C0KKJV8,"I like trash movies but you better be ready because this one is at the edge of disgusting! Not a family movie and not for all tastes but the nuggets make it worth watching! WARNING,some made need their air sickness bag nearby",1453939200,2,225,4.380952380952381
8576050,2,B00C0KKJV8,I just couldn't get into the movie. Acting was not good and it was cheaply made. Some Nudity is involved but I have to say overall for me it was Boring and not that shocking.,1448841600,,174,4.0
8576051,5,B00C0KKJV8,"The story for ""Trashology"" is genuinely well written and brilliantly executed. It is wicked sick how all the characters relate to each other in all three stories, that shows a true passion for this genre from Brian Dorton. It gives the film a slight seriousness which rocks, because to make so many characters intertwine in a anthology either takes one heck of a vision or a true psychotic view of the world, with some yarn and a white wall. (The walls are almost always white! well white-ish) Anyway ""Trashology"" is so much more than a love letter to John Waters, it is hope - hope for a subgenre that almost never gets respect or appreciation yet makes some of the best written and most hilarious cult films evah! It is also a film that is epically hilarious. I MEAN THIS FILM IS SICK! I think I will need an exorcism and enema just to get regular again. Okay I am lying! Those things are for funsies I was never regular to begin with. Thank the gods of the bowels of cinema neither is ""Trashology"".",1382054400,,1001,4.445652173913044
8576052,5,B00C0KKJV8,"If you haven't check out Brian Dorton's Trashology then it's a must for John Waters fans and movie buffs who love fun, cheesy, and most importantly trashy cinema. Great acting, great and clever writing, awesome stories which are The Vat, Big Debbie, and Inglorious Bitches. Plus! A lot of enjoyable moments and laughs. I highly recommend it with a nice cold slice of chocolate pie!!",1379635200,,382,4.892307692307693
8576053,5,B00C0KKJV8,"This movie is so very funny and given the budget, done very well also. Lots of laugh out loud moments make this worth a watch. I have watched it twice within 2 months and it was even funnier the 2nd time. Slasher video also did a very nice job with the dvd itself. If you like campy, corky films (john waters shit)then you will enjoy this wonderful little gem:)",1375747200,4,361,4.246376811594203
8576054,5,B00C0KKJV8,"Very well written, acted and very fun!  Brian Dorton and Douglas Conner have created such a crazy and imaginative film. I would recommend this film to anyone!",1374192000,4,158,4.851851851851852
