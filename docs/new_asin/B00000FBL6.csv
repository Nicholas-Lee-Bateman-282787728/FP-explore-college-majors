7908020,5,B00000FBL6,"A excellent and very kind movie for the right man who was selected for roll of being the ""FIRST"" man on the moon. MR. Armstrong has never been very sociable even when he was young. MR. Armstrong was never an arrogant person either. He lived his life the way that best worked for him. He loved to fly and he had his pilots license before he had his drivers license. He never would swagger around after his many accomplishments either. To mister Armstrong, the things that he did was his job and he did them to the best of his ability with complete confidence and coolness.

MR. Armstrong was never condescending to others about what accomplishments he achieved. To him he was just the average guy who was no different than the rest of us. He chose not to live off of his fame, he was never like that and did not let his place in history change him. Many years ago, my dad worked at N.A.S.A. during the Gemini project, and he told me that the question had come up about,"" somebody has to be 1st"". They at N.A.S.A. had to be sure it was somebody of a hummble nature. The last thing that they wanted was a swaggering arrogant ""YOU MAY TOUCH MY SLEEVE"" test pilot/astronaut to be the first to set foot on the moon. Being that MR. Armstrong was a very hummble and reserved person who was not seeking fame but rather there to do a job that needed to be done and he knew that he could do that job extreamly well, they at N.A.S.A.  knew that MR. Armstrong was the perfect person who had both the skill, ability, and hummbleness to get the job done with out staining his or N.A.S.A.'S image.

MR. Armstrong is truly a man who by his actions and disposition is to be admired. The world could use an entire population of Neil Armstrongs.
