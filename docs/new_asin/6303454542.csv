649070,5,6303454542,"Ok, I just had to write a review of this movie, since it is one of my most favorite all time horror films.  As a child this deeply affected me. I loved the atmospher and the mood of the film. I was only 4 years old when NBC showed this on television, and I wish they would rerun it again in primetime like CBS did with Dracula, back in '92.  First a lot has been made of the title of this film. Critics thought it was deceptive, because they expected to see a faithful adaptation of Shelley's novel.  This is certainly a reasonable expectation, and I can surly sympathize with anyone wanting to see a faithful adaptation.  I am one of those people.  The only film in history to come close to the novel was a Swedish movie called ""Victor Frankenstein"".  Many say ""Mary Shelley's Frankenstein"" was the most faithful version, but that was not true.  The Swedish film mentioned above was.  The title of this film is not so much insinuating truthfulness of plot and events of the novel, but more so the spirit of the novel.  It retains the moral lesson of the novel that monsters are made, not born.  And to take responsibiitly for what you do.  Most movies stress the ""man should not play God"" moral, but Shelley's messages was not so much that as it was the other moral.  Also most movies have the creature as being evil from the start, or evil by some other folly, such as a criminal brain being put in instead of a normal one.  This film attempts to make the audience sympathize with the creature, as the novel did. It seeks to show that the creature was not really the monster, but that Victor was the true monster in this tale.  Now normally, I hate movies that don't stick to the letter of the novel, but I was not bothered by this one's approach, because it got the main spirit of the novel right.  The production values are top knotch for a tv film, and the actors are first rate.  Leonard Whiting  makes a perfect Victor Frankenstein and James Mason as Polidori was brilliant casting!  His lines are some of the best in the film. When Victor is sewing up the female creature, Mason quips ""and to think this afternoon you were cutting a wedding cake!""  Jane Seymore plays the second creature to perfection. She is creepy and downright cruel and manipulative, but also beautiful.  Her polar opposite is the Creature, played with sensitivity by Michael Sarrazin.  He is gentle, kind, but alas, his features are deteriorating and he has been rejected by Victor.  Victor was quiet happy with him until the process by which he brought him to life (solar engergy in this film) starts reversing itself.  I was also intrigues by the homosexual undertones of this movie. All the strongest character bonds are between the males, and all the female characters are either portrayed as bitchy, dense, nosy, or evil. There is even an homosexual undertone to the relationship between Victor and his Creature, while he still retains his handsome features.  This is probably due to the script being written by Christopher Irshwood and Don Barchardy. Irshwood, a gay playwright, also wrote Cabaret.  This film is also the first Frankenstein film in history to actually use the Arctic for the setting at the end of the story.  This is most important because Shelley's Arctic setting was to parallel the Creature's plights, alone, desolate, cold, and unfeeling, much like Victor.  They need to get around to releasing the FULL 4 hour version of this great movie on tape.  It is better seen in it's entirety.  I am so glad the SciFi Channel showed the complete version a couple years ago. My brother taped it for me.  And for that, I am grateful to him.  See this film.

Much better than you would expect, but also somewhat distant, as if everyone was in on a secret they weren't going to tell the audience.

not real fans of true classic horror. I was only 1o when this first aired and I loved it and now finally getting to watch again it's as good as ever.
Despite some of the reviews it has great acting and directing and moves at a fast pace and the sets and costumes are all great. There isn't
much blood and gore which I never like anyway. This was a TV movie which like many of the TV movies of the era were better than the
garbage they make now and better than any version made after this one. David McCullum is great as the doctor who trains Frankenstein
and Michael Sazzarin and the 'monster' is wonderful and a young Jane Seymour who I didn't even recognize has a small role is very good.
The ending is done great and I can't understand anybody not liking this movie. It's much better than the William Hurt version which is awful.",1491091200,,976,4.309782608695652

I saw it a second time when I was 50 but only with a passing interest. I just re-watched this film and must say that I have a different opinion about it. It is based upon Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley's novel with a lot of gory additions. In truth, the handsome cast is wasted in this uneven production. I do not know what the producers were trying to make: a gothic English horror movie; a gory send-up of Frankenstein; or a horror film with moral lessons for all.

649707,1,6303454542,"Once again, I've found myself ripped off by glowing five-star reviews on Amazon.  I'm an old movie lover and am always on the lookout for a new hidden gem.  Unfortunately for me (to the tune of $8.82 paid to Amazon), this one is anything but.  Actually, it's HORRIBLE.

Where do I start?  Just picking things on the fly, we have Michael Sarrazin playing the monster who looks like...well...Michael Sarrazin.  They kept plopping goo on his face to try to make him look scary, but he never was the slightest bit scary.

Then there is the absolute comedy...how can one not laugh out loud as I did?...of the monster...er...Michael Sarrazin first trying to kill himself by jumping off the top of the Cliffs of Dover, only to recover, dust himself off, and go for a stroll on the beach.  Kinda reminded me of Burt Reynolds in the comedy, ""The End.""

Oh, yes, then there is the moment (actually there are TWO) where a double barrel shotgun is fired at him at point blank range, hits ""the monster""...aka Michael Sarazen...right in the chest...and it doesn't faze him.  This happens again later when the ""monster"" gets blasted with two pistols, again perfect shots to the chest, that have no effect.  Now, folks, I realize this is supposed to be a ""monster,"" but did I miss something or didn't I see this ""monster"" was created out of dead human bodies?  So how then are these human bodies able to withstand four shots to the chest?  Yes, and our ""monster"" even escapes from a building not only set afire into a colossal burning inferno, but even explodes high into the sky.  Yes, more of the human body supposedly made superhuman...but with no explanation, nor therefore believability as to why.

Speaking of human body parts sewn together, why do we never see any scars on this ""monster?""  The movie makes a big to do about the female ""monster's"" sewing scars, yet leaves Sarrazin alone.

But the crme-de-la-crme OF WRITING STUPIDITY is the closing film sequence.  Dr. Frankenstein and his wife SECRETLY hop on a ship to escape to America (and the ""monster"") only to find out the this ""monster"" was able to deduce their secret travel plans and stowed away aboard!  If you believe this, you'll believe anything.  But our beautiful dreamer script writers weren't done.  No, the ""monster"" reads a nautical chart and decides to hijack the ship himself and sail it - by himself! - north from the Atlantic (after murdering Dr. Frankenstein's wife and unborn child) into the ice of the Arctic.  Why the Arctic? No explanation is given, nor is any explanation given as to the nautical sailing prowess of our ""monster.""  Once the ""monster"" gets the ship locked up in the ice, he leaves the ship to head for a cave in a nearby iceberg (how convenient) only to be followed there by Dr. Frankenstein who then thanks the ""monster"" for killing his wife and child!  Ah, now that's loyalty.

These are just a few of the silly and stupid plot lines that come out of this DISASTER.  Don't be fooled by all the five-star ratings (who are these people that write them?), and don't be fooled by the all-star cast (John Gielgud appears for just five minutes, in a scripted moment that undermines his talent when he capitulates to Frankenstein's wife's in-your-face blackmail effort).  DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY.  DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME.  ONE OF THE ALL-TIME STUPIDEST MOVIES I HAVE EVER SEEN.  STAY AWAY!",1445817600,,3370,4.720890410958904

649709,5,6303454542,"There are many features of this production which hardly qualify as true, based on one's reading of Mary Shelley's Frankenstein.  However, the film includes Dr. John Polidori (played by James Mason), who was an early vampire novelist and one of the people with whom Mary Shelley spent a weekend on Lake Geneva when she conceived of the idea of Frankenstein; he is nowhere in the novel.  David McCallum , a doctor who influenced Victor Frankenstein and convinced him that he could create life, is also not there.  I do not remember that Mary Shelley's creature was nearly as refined and capable of being educated as he is portrayed by Michael Sarazin.  Finally, Jane Seymour becomes the ""bride"" of Frankenstein, and her creation is depicted.
I will say, nevertheless, that the film does depict an ending that is ""true"" and faithful to the spirit of the novel.  The whole production is highly entertaining and beautifully filmed; I do recommend it heartily.",1444521600,2,954,4.9375

649712,5,6303454542,"I saw this movie for the first time on a grainy black and white TV set when I was in seventh grade. I fell in love with Michael Sarrazin. I already knew about Leonard Whiting (who isn't too bad looking now, by the way). The whole story is by turns eerie, cynical heart-breaking (Agatha's death), and scary. It's all done in a veddy English way. The movie looks like most of it was filmed on location for a song. The cottage where Agatha and her husband live is a very pretty place with climbing roses and low ceilings over everything. Elizabeth's family live in a beautiful Geogian mansion with an oval ballroom with French doors.

But the movie's story isn't pretty. It isn't scary in a way like an action movie is, or even in the way that we expect Frankenstein movies to be, for it's about hubris, and its consequences. The writer of the script was a man of letters. The action here is in the heads of the actors, all of whom, with the exception of Elizabeth's parents and Dr. Frankenstein's landlady, are either possessed of hubris or seduced by it.

The only thing that isn't likeable, though, is that women here are portrayed as being in the way of male bonding. The closest, most intimate relationships are between Henry Clerval and Dr. Frankenstein, and then between Frankenstein and his monster, who die together, it appears, at the end. But the monster can't die. He's tried to kill himself several times. The movie ends with a mass of snow and ice cascading on them, so you wonder, does the monster dig himself out? What does that say about us? Is Henry Clerval the Id and Dr. Frankenstein the Super Ego? Does the monster represent the degeneration of the Id?

The script, written by Christopher Isherwood, is wonderfully paced, with rich, quirky, full-bodied characters brought to life by the a fine cast of actors including James Mason, David McCallum, Michael Sarrazin, and a very young Jane Seymour.

649948,5,6303454542,"Frankenstein: The True Story was an inventive, fresh, and original retelling of the Frankenstein legend that adhered to some of original author Mary Shelly's basic tenets (e.g., Initially, the creature was aesthetically attractive and intelligent; as portrayed with pathos and sensitivity by Michael Sarrazin). The performances by David McCallum and Jane Seymour were admirable; although, I felt that David McCallum and Jane Seymour's respective characters were eliminated from the story/plot line too soon. Especially, in consideration of the fact that the portrayal of David McCallum and Jane Seymour's respective characters were both fascinating and appealing. Leonard Whiting was quite good in his own right. The production values and script still hold up by modern standards. Moreover,the mini series/movie was so fascinating and well done that it's almost inconceivable that Frankenstein: The True Story is known only to the esoteric few (e.g., movie buffs and film critics). Moreover, Frankenstein: The True Story is one of those films that merits repeated viewings and the viewer doesn't become easily satiated; especially, since top notch performances by iconic film legends including James Mason, Sir John Gielgud and Sir Ralph Richardson were surprisingly good. Although, Mason, Gielgud, and Richardson were in the twilight of their respective film careers they exhibited the superior acting skills that had made them legendary film icons throughout the years. Essentially, these iconic film legends gave their respective performances their all and didn't attempt to ""phone it in"" or ""rest on their laurels."" It begs the question, ""Why isn't this cinematic gem more widely known and acknowledged among those; including, the general public who appreciate and enjoy well crafted cinema?"" For example, James Mason was in rare form as the delightfully michievious, nefarious, and eccentric Dr. Pollidori. Well worth the price of the DVD.

650194,5,6303454542,"The title notwithstanding, this isn't a faithful adaptation of the novel.  It is, however, a sumptuous, well-acted, well-written film, one of the better ""Frankenstein"" movies.  Originally broadcast over two nights on NBC, this version survives intact minus the ""recap"" that NBC ran at the beginning of Part 2...and even for purists like me, that is no great loss.

The story itself is complex and as full of intrigue as it is horror.  Added treats are bravura performances turned in by people such as Agnes Moorehead, Sir John Gielgud and David McCallum in supporting roles.

The one curiosity in the film is James Mason's present-day introduction, in which he explains ""Frankenstein""'s origins in the Mary Shelley novel.  Included in this introduction are preview scenes of the film to come, which are, frankly, something of a waste of time.

When this movie was made, however, there was also a screenplay of the film published in paperback form.  In this screenplay -- an earlier version, obviously -- the story begins and ends quite differently.

The alternate screenplay begins with Mary Shelley, her husband Percy Bysshe Shelley, Dr. John Polidori and Lord Byron all picnicking at a lake.  Polidori is off by himself, sulking.  Polidori's colossal vanity is hurt because he's at wit's end for funds and must serve as Byron's personal physician, a position he considers beneath him.  But he's also offended because the entire group had agreed to each write a horror story, and Mary laughed at his.  (This has some historical basis, by the way.  Look it up.)

Mary then proceeds to tell her own story, assigning each of her colleagues a role as characters.  Her husband will play Victor Frankenstein.  And as she tells the story, it begins to come alive.  A surprised Shelley/Victor looks out at the lake and actually sees Victor's brother drowning in the water.  Declaring Mary to be a sorceress, he nevertheless rushes off to rescue him.  And from there, the story proceeds as seen in the film.  (If you notice, in the actual film, ""Elizabeth"" has a sly look on her face while Victor's brother is drowning, and this explains why.  She is actually Mary, watching her friends around her merge into her fantasy.)

SPOILER WARNING.  The movie also ends differently.  When arctic summer comes, the ice begins to thaw, and the creature's hand reaches out toward the sunshine.  END SPOILER WARNING.

Despite James Mason's warning at the beginning of the movie that ""Frankenstein"" is not a Hollywood creation, bits of Hollywood do creep in...especially when Polidori decides to make his own ""monster"".  Prima, his creation, definitely has echoes of ""Bride of Frankenstein"".

The characters are all richly drawn.  Polidori is urbane but highly manipulative, and it is he that keeps the wheels turning behind all the plot convolutions.  Victor is enthusiastic but naive for all his brilliance; and Prima wears a sweet and cultured mask that betrays a feral, homicidal nature.

This may not be the ""true story"" of Frankenstein, but in the end it is a highly entertaining one, so that despite the misleading title, one can't help be satisfied with it.  DVD quality is on a par with the original broadcast.",1353110400,4,3198,4.984877126654064
650195,1,6303454542,"Do not let this one fool you.  This NOT a faithful adaptation of Mary Shelley's novel.  The very idea that the Frankenstein creature is decomposing contradicts that the creature was given life.  He's alive, not just reanimated dead tissue, that's a major point in the story.  It's a disappointing and senseless twist that is completely unnecessary.  If you want a version of Frankenstein that actually follows Mary Shelley's novel check out the version produced by Hallmark and released to DVD by Lion's Gate starring Luke Goss as the creature.

Jane Seymour is pure, wicked (but beautiful) evil as the ""perfected"" model of the experiment executed perfectly, I loved watching her. This is long, so I had to watch it in parts. People that want a lot of guns blasting and explosions and loud, obnoxious music blaring in their ears will hate this...it's Shakespearean acting and low-budget, yet I was amazed at some of the sets.

I still believe that this is the best of ALL the Frankenstein movies, and that's saying quite a bit, not just due to the sheer number of remakes that exist, but it's also remarkable because this one was actually made for the small screen.  You'll forget this after you see how top notch the production values are.

A word for the people who dislike ""THE TRUE STORY"" simply because it was unfaithful to the book... That's an unfair assessment because after all, do you seriously expect a 100% faithful adaptation each and every time you watch a Dracula or Frankenstein movie?  That would be ridiculous!

650389,3,6303454542,"For those of you who have read some of my other reviews, you can tell that I have a vendetta against Universal Home Video Productions of television series. As this is one of my all-time favorite TV mini-series and that I am also a fan of classic horror and supernatural TV anthology series, I purchased Frankenstein--The True Story when the DVD was first released. However I just recently watched it again and realized that this release is on thesame (low) par with other Universal Home Video television series releases.

This is a great production, so I won't discuss anything about that, except to say this would otherwise be a five-star review.

But in this day and age of HD-TV, I've seen better remastering work and digital transfers from Warner Brothers, Anchor Bay, MGM and others on classic horror (such as the excellent Hammer Horror catalog--even Universal's Hammer collection).  Of course these were mostly theatrical material, there's still no excuse for the sub-par quality of this Universal television DVD release. This production is long, just over three and a half hours. It probably should have been a two-disc set.  That, however, still probably would not have atoned for the somewhat overall grainy picture with occasional uneven, washed-out color, and sometimes sharp, but other times hazy images. However, in the final twenty minutes of the feature on my DVD, there are some noticable glitches such as momentary picture freezes (not due to dual layering), plus some pixeling and shaking of the images.

Needless to say, this great production needs some work in the remastering process and, above all, a Blu-ray release!",1288742400,,1640,5.0817843866171

It was surprisingly dark and graphic for early 70's TV--bodiless limbs, a head being ripped off, a nude woman's body floating in a tank. Watching it again as an adult, I see it's flaws, but it's still a fun, creepy, campy take on the Frankenstein story. James Mason is a hoot as Dr. Polidori. With his smooth voice, nobody could deliver a droll, sarcastic line like him. Jane Seymour is also good as the monster's ""bride."" Her sinister giggle and cruelty toward cats made her a memorable villain. If you've never seen it, it's worth renting.

Although, it is wildly different from Mary Shelly's version it is more true to her then Kenneth Branagh's mess.  It's best just to watch it as a movie, and not a faithful re-creation (bad pun).  The writing is top notch, it is very well acted with an amazing cast.  James Mason has the best throw away lines.  ""Violence is understandable, but clumsiness is not"".  The best scenes, are the ones with Michael Sarrazin as the monster.  He doesn't need to say much, just his expressive eyes do the talking.  Yes, it is campy at times, but I think that is deliberate, to add humor.  The story resonates on many levels...playing God, responsibility for what we have created..no matter it's outward appearance, euthanisa and the right to die.  This show introduced me to the actual novel Frankenstein.  The reason I only give it 4 stars is the quality of the DVD, especially watching it on a blue ray is good, but not great.

Despite an Imperial Cast, including James Mason, Margaret Leighton, Agnes Moorehead, John Gielgud, and Leonard Whiting, the plot is oddly uninvolving and fuzzy. The most interesting aspect is the homoerotic chemistry between Dr. Frankenstein and his creature Adam. They look lovingly into each others' eyes, similar to Colin Farrell and Jared Leto's loving glances in Oliver Stone's equally bad ""Alexander."" The women in this film are portrayed as bitchy, campy vixens: Frankenstein's wife Elizabeth and Dr. Polidori's creation ""Prima"" exchange catty remarks and dirty looks a la Linda Evans and Joan Collins in their ""Dynasty"" prime. Agnes Moorehead, in one of her final roles, is wasted. Her campy performance in ""Hush Hush Sweet Charlotte"" was a gem, and some of that energy could have injected some life into this story.

650397,5,6303454542,"Around 1993, due to the upcoming release of Kenneth Branaugh's Mary Shelly's Frankenstein,a whole slew of documentaries were released to coincide. I was only a child at the time, but already a fan of the Monster and the story and this one was the one that dented my young mind the most.

Produced by A and E, this is one well researched and fine looking documentary that explores the Monster's impact on popular culture. From the genesis of the classic 1931 film, through the making of the novel that inspired that and the tragic life of it's author through contemporary productions made by Universal, Hammer and various low budget companies. There's even discussions of the 40s/50s Spookshows that played such a large role in popularizing the face of the Monster and the various stageplays, including the lavish 1981 Broadway adaption, the most biggest financial disaster in Theatre history.
Mel Brook's Young Frankenstein(1974) has an entire section, and of course so does, that 1994 production.

The film is narrated by Roger Moore and he does a good job, bringing a humor and dignity to the proceedings and is supported by a number of interesting people that have been involved with the legend.
There's a strange sentimental quality to this film and one feels somewhat indebted to the Monster for letting us recognizing our humanity time and time again through page and screen. Definitely in need of a DVD release. The serious Horror and cinema fan needs this in his/her collection.",1238889600,,1486,4.963855421686747

The end result is a guy with clay on his forehead.  Stay away, do yourself a favor cause its terrible.  Run time is like 3 hours of BLAH!",1235520000,,443,4.544303797468355
650473,5,6303454542,"By no means the ""True""story the title informs us it is,rather a different and well written,lavish televison production of the Mary Shelly classic.

Over three hours long,this version takes a completely different turn than previous(and many) future versions,by starting with Victor Frankenstein losing his little brother in a boating accident,and striving to make it so man may obtain immortality. However,it's not Frankenstein that is working on bringing the dead to live,but Henry Clevral,who was Victor's best friend in the novel.
Henry dies before his monster is brought to life and Victor finishes the experiment. The monster is not horrorific,but actually handsome,but soon begins to deteriorate and attempts to destroy itself only to discover it's immortal!

This version is very dark with some fine performances by Michael Sarrazin as the sympathetic and increasingly hideous Monster,James Mason as the villianous Dr. Polidori and the lovely Jane Seymour as the female Monster,""Prima"" who meets an interesting demise.

Very well done with a terrific epic scale and beautiful locations,this is a must for the Frankenstein and Horror film and is one of the best made for television Horror films ever made.

This DVD release is a fine release,but has no features and has an introduction to the film that can act as a spoiler for first time viewers,so be warned.

I bought this VHS and for years it was a treasure as it was the only version available other than off cable full length bootlegs. When I saw they were going to finally release this gem uncut, well I was giddy. I guess we could split hairs on the details compared to the actual Shelly novel, and argue the video transfer was not what it could be, but I won't. It wasn't that long ago that video collectors scrounged everywhere the could just to see hard to find titles like this, so DVD is really the golden age for collectors because it's only though this format we even get to now collect such titles at all.

650476,3,6303454542,"I remembered watching this when it was first on television, back in 1973 or '74.  I was a kid then, but certain scenes 'stuck' with me -- the violent ends of Jane Seymour's character (both as Agatha and Prima), the pitiful condition of the Creature, the menace of James Mason as Polidori... So out of curiosity I thought I'd get a copy and watch it again as an adult.

I'm not sorry I did.  This was a top-notch production for its day, with plenty of attention paid to accurate historical detail.  (There's just one exception: the men's hairstyles --these are all somewhat 1970's.  But the sets, the carriages, and the clothing are marvelous.)

The acting is generally superior with the disappointing exception of Leonard Whiting, whose character could have been played by a block of wood for all the depth he brings in portraying Dr. Frankenstein.  If only Whiting could have shown more of Frankenstein's inner torment or regret regarding his part in the creation gone so tragically wrong.  Instead, all we get from Whiting is a kind of prissy disgust and anger with the Creature, when the Creature begins to become physically repellent.  Frankenstein should have been angry with himself, not the Creature.  Frankenstein's total rejection of the Creature; his failure to take responsibility toward him, and the 'why-me' attitude he displays, are really annoying.  It's a pleasure when James Mason's character calls him out on this, too!

I read the review that talks about a gay subtext in the story.  This isn't something I picked up on at age 11, but viewing it now, I guess it's there - if you're looking for it.  Certainly Frankenstein and the Creature have an affectionate bond before the Creature begins to disintergrate - and there is just that one small bed in Frankenstein's rooms...  But, no, I really didn't get the vibe that Frankenstein's feelings were 'that way' about his creation.  No, Victor Frankenstein is the Creature's friend, his guide, his brother -- all of these things much more than merely a lover, which makes Frankenstein's rejection of the Creature all the more heartbreaking.  Frankenstein mentions that the Creature is in a 'state of childhood' just after his rebirth, and that was more the impression I had:  that the Creature loved Frankenstein like an older brother or a father, and was dependent on him like a child is dependent on a parent.

James Mason steals every scene he's in.  I'd forgotten what a great actor he really was.  Nicola Paget does what she can with the somewhat thankless role of Elizabeth, Frankenstein's wife. Women are somewhat superfluous to men in Frankenstein's world, except for Jane Seymour's Prima {Frankenstein and Polidori's successful creation} who is desired by all.  Michael Sarrazin (whatever happened to him?) gives a superb performance as the pathetic Creature, and almost totally mute.  Jane Seymour is absolutely beautiful-looking as Prima, and like Sarrazin's, her speaking performance is minimal, yet she manages to convey Prima's soulless character with gestures and glances.

The production is somewhat slow moving and too melodramatic at times toward its end.  Perhaps it's better to say 'gothic' instead of melodramatic, given the time period in which the story is set.  But I still enjoyed it very much, despite some creaky sections.  It's held up well for a 35-year-old television production, and I'd bet there are very few lengthy TV productions being made today that will hold up nearly so well in another 35 years.",1212969600,15,3500,5.010380622837371

The creature moves subtly from perfection to grotesque, from innocence to degenerate showing the viewer the many faceted human (or non-human) emotions driving the creature along the way.

While this movie lacks the gothic atmosphere of some of the older, classic `Frankenstein' adaptations, this film delivers splendid production values, a stellar cast, a well conceived storyline and a profoundly intelligent, ongoing dialogue examining the nature of God, creation, the existence of the soul and the every blurring line between enlightenment and damnation. Such a rarity, a horror film offers depth and the opportunity for some afterthought after its conclusion. All that and the ravishing Jane Seymour too! It's almost too much to ask for.

The True Story is different from Karloff's, but as gorgeous as a Gothic film from the 70's could be! (And the Creature, Frankenstein and Clerval were all hot! At the age I am now, I find James Mason extremely dishy as well--but not when I was 10.)Like many of the reviewers, I saw it when I was about 9 or 10, and was absolutely overwhelmed by the music, scenery, beautiful actors, and chilling scenes that burned themselves into my memory (crawling hand.

James Mason also gives a very good performance as Dr. John Polidori.  Considering that this was originally aired as a miniseries it holds up pretty well.

Take this Dr. Frankenstein dude for instance. He is a dapper, upper crust man of the world. His hair is long and impeccable, he is snobby, and he believes he is superior to his fellow human beings. You can almost see him writing in his journal ""I have decided to do the world a favor by creating a man in my own image. A man without body odor, bad manners, and whose poop has the fragrance of roses.""

When the 'monster' actually arises, it is almost laughable. This is not Colin Clive meets Boris Karloff folks. This is more like two homosexuals getting ready to embrace. The monster looks VERY gay. It was almost as if they made him look that way on purpose. Dr. Frankenstein's first words were ""You are beautiful"". The monster mutters ""beautiful"". I swear I thought they were going to embrace and make out.

And what's up with the solar power? When did Mary Shelly ever mention solar power in her novel? It was hilarious when the lab began to explode. Everything is very clam, quiet, and very warm when the solar cells light up, and then for no reason at all, it looked like someone set off a hydrogen bomb. I know this was done for dramatic effect, but the explosions looked totally out of place.

Now the highlight of this flick was the female monster. Man she was a hottie. Those stitches around her neck were very erotic. I wouldn't have minded making her for myself.

The monster starts to look like a real monster once the process starts to reverse on itself. No longer is her the pretty man, now he is a beast. The best scene of the whole flick is when he storms the ball and rips the head off of the female creature.

Now we got some weird characters in this. We got a dude with no hands, he is a master hypnotist. That is probably how he controls his two Chinese man servants. I could imagine them holding his penis as he went pee pee.

Dr. Frankenstein didn't even start this whole mad dream. In this version there is another mad doctor who was 80% ready to create his creature by the time Dr. Franky came along. Frankenstein only got involved because he was distraught over his brother. His brother was a wimp and fell out of a row boat and drowned in under two seconds.

The climax of he movie is almost like Mary Shelly envisioned. They did end up in the North Pole, but in this movie they travelled together in the same boat!!! So anyway they share a good laugh just as an avalanche crushes them both.

Mr. Fetzer seems slightly under whelmed by the ""camp lunacy"" of Frankenstein - The True Story. Now, I love movies, and I love reading about the movies. I have read a ton of bad reviews in my day, some I thought missed the boat - some just obviously biased, but Mr. Fetzer's review of this film deserves some sort of prize. Normally, this kind of ignorance is easy to ignore, but to call this film ""camp lunacy"" is so very far off the mark, one has to wonder if the reviewer understands the meaning. Allow me to give a reference: Mel Brooks' Young Frankenstein would be an example of ""camp lunacy."" The film under discussion here is more a Gothic horror with a Bronte sense of drama and style.

Like several reviewers here, I saw this film when it first came out, as a two-part mini-series. I was then a sophomore in high school. This many years later, I still remember it and can bring up the thrill it gave me. It remains my favorite retelling of the Mary Shelly classic.  I can still remember the effect it had on me, this many years later. I actually thought about it and looked forward to it all the week long between parts one and the broadcast of part two.

Sure, it's highly stylized, dialogue is arch, and there are scenes so horrific and perversely odd as to be almost funny...but that's part of the Gothic form. Watch Young Frankenstein (1974) for a ""camp"" treatment of the Frankenstein story. Tonally, this movie is dead serious and pure Shelly.

Okay, having said that, how does this movie compare to the other treatments of the Frankenstein story? Even though I love the Universal/Karloff films, I actually believe this version is the best adaptation of Frankenstein ever filmed. Make no mistake, as with Karloff, this movie takes liberties with the original book. But it does so to better illustrate key themes. Having the monster start off as beautiful (he even thinks ""Beautiful"" is his name) and accepted by Dr. Frankenstein and society is a master stroke idea which evokes even greater empathy for the creature when he finds himself suddenly rejected as he starts to develop tissue degeneration (no more ""beautiful""). Everyone loves a child, but then... I also love that in this version the Bride is given substantial screen time beyond her creation. Here Jane Seymour gives us a fascinating version of a  ""female monster"" -- vain, attention starved, manipulative, sexually predatory (she's Paris Hilton!). And the meeting between monster and bride...probably one of the best (and, yes, Gothic) moments in all of horror history.

Also, the production values are so high it's hard to believe this was made for TV. But, remember, this was made in the era of TV movies like ROOTS, etc. So not only is this is an example of just how good a Frankenstein movie can be, it's also a shining example of just how excellent television can be.

(One quick tip on viewing -- skip the James Mason prologue at the start. It's cool to have this included, but the clips give away too much of the plot.)",1165017600,36,2310,4.900255754475704
650641,5,6303454542,"For years I have been waiting the re-release of this 1970s classic. I'd seen it as a teen-ager and waited long for the home release with great anticipation. As a made-for TV film the quality of this production leaves a lot to be desired if you have been spoiled by Hollywood's growing special-effects productions. However, the script is remarkable, and, as I seem to recall, the story and not the special-effects or the production value are the reasons why I have waited hopefullyand expectantly for three decades for this movie to be released for the home consumer market. This film beats the Boris Karloff version into the ground with a big stick. Michael Sarrazin's performance was exemplary as the creature. The excellent casting of well known British actors made this production  superior to almost any other dramatic piece from the period.",1163030400,3,845,4.99290780141844
650642,5,6303454542,"Victor Frankenstein may very well be literature's most famous (or notorious) negligent parent. The tale of a man who creates a living being from corpses and then, horrified by what he has done, abandons it and lives to regret it, is one of the great tragic stories in English literature. The creature, seeking understanding and love, is reviled by society, becomes bitter and vengeful towards its creator, and then punishes him, ""big time"", again and again, for giving him life.

To readers weaned on the likes of Stephen King, Dean Koontz, or Clive Barker, Mary Shelley's ""Frankenstein, or the Modern Prometheus"", is a bit of a letdown. It isn't really a ""horror"" novel at all, but more a very moral tale in which some horrific and fantastic things occur.

""Frankenstein"", in its innumerable cinematic incarnations, had pretty much left Mary Shelley far behind,  the moral lesson of the tale eradicated, and the horrific elements of emphasized and often overemphasized, rendering it merely a grisly ""shocker.""

In 1973, openly gay writer Christopher Isherwood and his longtime companion Don Bachardy scripted a literate, disturbing, and more-than-slightly homoerotic adaptation of Mary Shelley's novel for a made-for-TV movie entitled ""Frankenstein: The True Story"". The original screenplay even had a prologue featuring Mary Shelley, Percy Shelley. Lord Byron, and Byron's personal physician Dr. Polidori, each character having an internal conversation about themselves but alas, did not make into the final film. ""Frankenstein: The True Story"" is certainly not the letter of Mary Shelley's novel, as some characters were eliminated, some changed or combined, and even some new ones created, but, in this viewer's opinion, comes very, very close to the spirit of the novel, and touches on some pretty disturbing subjects, not the kind of stuff that was seen on prime-time television in the early 1970s. Implied homosexuality, misogyny, necrophilia, along with a generous knock at religion, were some of the topics in this handsome production. The film does borrow from the Universal ""Frankenstein"" films, most notably ""Bride of Frankenstein"", and from some of the Hammer ""Frankenstein"" films, most notably ""Revenge of Frankenstein"". Incidentally, the film's makeup artist, Roy Ashton, had been Hammer Films' primary makeup artist.

Leonard Whiting, who had starred in Zeffirelli's ""Romeo and Juliet"" plays medical student Victor Frankenstein, whose chance meeting with fellow surgeon Henry Clerval (David McCallum) leads to a collaboration that, in Regency-era England, was the ultimate blasphemy: the creation of a living man from corpses. Clerval and  Victor's fiance Elizabeth (Nicola Pagett), (who Clerval finds pious and meddlesome and an obvious threat for Victor's affections), dislike each other intensely. Clerval suffers a fatal heart attack, and Victor transplants his brain into the head of the creature. The creature (Michael Sarrazin) is brought to life and is stunningly handsome, but the very process which brought it to life (solar energy is introduced into the tale), begins to reverse itself, and the creature begins to become ugly. Victor begins to treat it with disgust and contempt, and the creature, realizing that its beauty is gone, tries to kill itself...but fails.

A longtime rival of Clerval's, the sinister and effete Dr. Polidori (James Mason) enters the picture, and  plans to create his own creature....a woman. Using the head of a dead peasant girl (a very young and luscious Jane Seymour) provided by the creature, the newly created woman, christened Prima, is breathtakingly beautiful...and as cold and calculating as a serpent. Polidori tries to destroy the male creature, but the creature escapes and exacts his terrible revenge, culminating in the deaths of Prima, Polidori, and the increasingly hostile Elizabeth. Both creator and creation end up at the North Pole (as in the novel), and Victor begs forgiveness from the creature, then an avalanche buries them both, putting an end to their misery.

As I stated earlier, liberties were taken with the novel, but the basic story of a creature that is rejected by its creator and society, its subsequent bitterness, and the tragedy that befalls all concerned, was brought to this production which, I'm sure, touched (and surprised) many who may never have even read the original book, or understood Mary Shelley's intentions. This was no mere ""shocker"", but a whole other kettle of flesh.

The supporting cast boasts cameos by several legendary performers, such as Margaret Leighton, Agnes Moorehead, Sir John Gielgud, Sir Ralph Richardson, Michael Wilding, Tom Baker (TV's Dr Who), and Clarissa Kaye (Mrs James Mason), handsome Regency costumes and sets, and particularly memorable performances from Michael Sarrazin and Jane Seymour, who really make one reexamine the nature and definition of beauty, which in many cases, may be only ""skin deep.""

The picture and sound quality are merely OK (this really could have benefitted from remastering and restoration, as some scenes are downright grainy), but it's certainly better than the prints that had been shown on TV in previous years. On the plus side, the film has been restored to its original running length (it had been edited down to 2 hours for theatrical release in the UK, and that version was the only one commercially available on VHS), and much of Jane Seymour's role ended up on the cutting room floor. And there are no extras on the DVD (I would have loved to have seen a ""making of"" featurette or a commentary), but at least this viewer is happy to see this long-awaited release finally become available on DVD.",1162771200,4,5668,5.2727272727272725
650643,2,6303454542,"I'd like to admit here from the start that although I grew up loving the horror genre, that since last midcentury up through the 70s, it went from good B-film status to low-grade garbage, only getting all the worse since that time. I admit that there are those seldom-made fairly impressive works since that time, but very few-and really none adapted from the Mary Shelley book. Technically, then, this would be one of the few decent Frankenstein films I've seen in recent years. Also, having viewed it on TV in the 70s(I was just a child at the time) and now seeing it here on DVD, I was surprised how well a TV film from that period holds up. Jack Smight may not be David Lean-or James Whale, for that matter-but if one goes back to view TV entries for this time period, this is not at all a bad-looking production, whatsoever.
As far as Universal's restoration, well, I'll give them an inch more than other reviews here. First of all, these TV prints were not as protected as the more important cinematic films of the day. I, actually, don't find the print all too bad, considering this fact. I admit, though, that it's not perfect and, as many have noted here, the sound is far too low. Anyhow, if Universal didn't want the complaints, they'd start restoring their archives better in the first place(which they've only just barely begun-far too late, if you ask me).
  As others have remarked here, James Mason is quite good, Agnes Moorhead is fun, and both creatures, portrayed by Michael Sarrazin and Jane Seymour, are worth mentioning. However, as also was mentioned here, Leonard Whiting, as Dr. Frankenstein, is not all too interesting, which is definitely a debit early on. I do disagree, though, with one person's critique of the film's first hour. I feel that once we get past the dually boring family of Elizabeth, Frankenstein's fiance, and meet the all-too-mad Henry Clerval(David McCallum) within the first half hour, the movie begins to move a bit. In fact, the final hour of the first half is pretty much the best of this whole series, ending with a great 'cliffhanger'(for those of you who have-or will-see the film, pardon my pun).
  Sarrazin, Moorhead, and Mason have a lot to do with part one's benefits. Sadly, after the opening of the second half, things slow down quite a bit again(this was originally shown, with commercials, in two 105 minute segments-in those days, there was approximately four or five minutes of ads every half hour, and TV movies would end on the quarter hour, with some 15 minute 'filler' stuck between it and the next broadcast, such as an old 'behind the scenes' of some late 60s, early 70s film). The classic British actor Sir Ralph Richardson enters here and, along with Sarrazin, carries the next twenty minutes or so, but then things become more and more ambiguous and less and less interesting. It's true that Mason and Seymour add some spice, but the script takes a sharp turn for the worse.
  Perhaps Isherwood's script is homoerotic, but, if so, that doesn't do anything positive for this film. After all, if Frankenstein's fiance Elizabeth is written as an obnoxious battleaxe(as she is here), then from the very first, he becomes an obtuse, illogical character. Of course, he'd end up hanging with the creature, then, who happens to be good looking, thus assisting Frankie in bagging some babes(okay, maybe this isn't actually in the script, but it can be just as inferred as anything else). If that's homoerotic, I've definitely gone gay, then. The real problem, though, is how the later creation occurs, the science of which is never explained-outside of not using electricity, as with the previous one. The female creature is just seen in a mass of colors, with wind blowing through her hair, more like a James Bond title sequence than a Whale lab scene(this is all the more ironic given that Seymour had appeared in Roger Moore's first Bond only a year or so before this).
  Also, why are 'certain' stitches slower to heal than others. I mean, both creations were supposedly stitched together. After all, we see Frankenstein about to dissect his first creation to add a 'better' brain. Yet, no stitches here, where the second creation has one very prominent 'secret stitch'-???? Wat up wit dis? Anyhow, although half the cast tries, the story really ends up going nowhere fast and then receives a quick, tacked on finale at sea, with admittedly dated, inexpensive TV effects to boot(which may have been excusable if not for this laborious part two). Overall, 'Frankenstein-the True Story' is definitely not frightening whatsoever(especially as it had seemed for an eight year old so many years ago-okay, it was a more innocent time). The telefilm is for certain increasingly illogical, though, leaving it for diehard 'Frankenstein' buffs only. For others, stick with the James Whale films, the first three sound versions of the neverending tale, encompassing the 1930s: 'Frankenstein', 'Bride of Frankenstein'(the best adaptation ever of Shelley's novel), and 'Son of Frankenstein'. These are the classic Universal Boris Karloff pictures, with the famous Jack Pierce makeup. For those who like Mel Brooks' 'Young Frankenstein', you'll only get more out of it after seeing these three films.",1161907200,3,5254,4.902137232845894
650644,3,6303454542,"Anyone who has read the actual novel will immediately seen that, for whatever reason, this is not the true story of Frankenstein--which in my opinion has never been presented on screen.  However, this version has some really sound ideas--Frankenstein's rejection of the creature, his Adam, not because he was ugly, but because he was beginning to rot--at least that is how I look at it--being one of them.  It does salute the earlier Universal films by using the electronics to bring the creature to life--nice effects for the time the film was made. The best point is that the female creature--destroyed by Victor in the novel--is the true monster from hell. Jane Seymour shows an evil side that one rarely sees in her (except for the TV remake of ""East of Eden"").  When I saw the miniseries in the '70s, her end horrified me--it is still a scene that gives me the willies.

  The film isn't for everyone.  It is dated and has been surpassed by Kenneth Branaugh's filmed version (again in my opinion) but for those who collect Frankenstein films, it will be a needed member of an often abused tale.",1160870400,2,1099,4.692708333333333
650645,2,6303454542,"Frankstein, the true story, is one of those movies that is better as a distant memory.  I remember watching the original mini-series in the early 1970's and being captivated by the ""twists"" in the story. But the mini-series does ""not stand the test of time"".  The biggest weakness is the pacing.  The pace is glacial (perhaps inspired by the closing scene).  This is especially a problem in the first hour.  Dr. Frankenstein is played by Leonard Whiting who is best know for his role as Romeo in Zefferelli's R&J.  Leonard looks very pretty with his ginger hair but is rather bland.  Things pick-up a little with the appearance of the ""beautiful"" monster played by Michael Sarrazan.  But there is a flaw in the doctor's process and Sarrazan begins.... I won't divulge the whole story but Sarrazin becomes less beautiful as the story progresses.  Sarrazin is slender and is never menancing as the monster.  Although not explicit, the ""beautiful"" monster concept also introduces a gay subtext to Dr. Frankenstein's relationship to the monster.  The screenplay was written by Christopher Isherwood and Don Bacardy so this gay subtext may have been unavoidable.  The story picks up quite a bit in the second half with the introduction of a very young and truly beautiful Jane Seymore in her due rolls of Agatha and Prima.  Her performance is what makes this TV movie worth seeing.  Agnes Moorehead is good in a small role in the first half, and James Mason is quite good a Doctor Polidori in the second half.",1159747200,4,1504,4.82421875
650646,4,6303454542,"Every film version of FRANKENSTEIN has taken tremendous liberties with Mary Shelly's celebrated 1818 novel, and although it retains the core idea of the book this one is no exception.  Produced for television by Universal Studios in 1973, the film contains a host of characters and ideas that draw more from previous film versions than from the original novel.  More interestingly, however, it introduces a number of distinctly original concepts as well.

Simply stated, the film has a highly disconcerting and surprisingly overt homoerotic edge.  Instead of the inevitable ""mad doctor"" typical of films, Victor Frankestein is a remarkably handsome young man in the form of actor Leonard Whiting, a performer best known as Romeo in the famous 1968 ROMEO AND JULIET.  He is seduced into the experiment by the equally handsome but distinctly odd Henry Clerval (David McCallum)--and not only do the two actors play the relationship in a disquietingly touchy-feely way, Clerval takes exception to Victor's fiancee Elizabeth (Nicola Pagett) and she returns the favor, demanding that Victor choose between them.

Lest any one miss the implications, the creature is played by none other than Michael Sarrazin, and while many men may be described as handsome, Sarrazin is among the few who can be justly described as beautiful.  He arises from the laboratory table barely decent in a few strategically placed bandages, and when his facial covering is pulled aside by the eager Dr. Frankenstein we are treated to a lingering image of glossy black hair, pale complexion, remarkably liquid eyes, and lips that would make Vogue model weep with envy.  Dr. Frankenstein takes him to his own apartment, where he educates this child-like innocent and very generously allows the creature to sleep in his own bed.

But, as in all FRANKENSTEIN movies, the experiment goes awry, and when it does the same disconcerting homoerotic overtones take yet another turn. Due to some unknown error in the creation process, the creature begins to deteriorate in appearance--and instead of continuing to treat him kindly, Frankenstein keeps the creature locked up, becomes verbally abusive to him, and no longer allows the creature to sleep in his bed, relegating him to a cramped mattress on the floor.  At the same time, Frankenstein is approached by the mysterious Dr. Polidori (the legendary James Mason), an oily scientist with a flair for hypnosis who claims to know what went wrong.

Polidori insists that they abandon the creature and create a new one: a woman, and when this new creation emerges from an entirely different process she too is remarkably beautiful; indeed, she is none other than Jane Seymour.  But whereas the original creature was a gentle creature who only learned violence from Frankenstein's hateful rejection, this new entity is strangely icy, almost snake-like from the very beginning--and the male creature, now both vicious and wildly jealous, will exact a horrific toll upon all concerned.

It is worth pointing out that the script for this version of FRANKENSTEIN was co-authored by Christopher Isherwood (1904-1986), one of the few openly gay writers of his era.  Sexuality in general and homosexuality in particular forms a theme in many of Isherwood's works, so it would seem reasonable to assume that he was responsible for the homoerotic elements of the film.  Jack Smight's direction does not offer anything nearly so interesting as the script, but it is workman-like, and while the production values tend to be a shade too baroque for their own good one never lacks for something to look at on the screen.

The cast is also quite good.  At the time, the film was looked upon as a ""television event,"" and it drew a host of noted actors, including John Gielgud and Agnes Moorehead.  No one would accuse Leonard Whiting of being a great screen talent, but he acquits himself very well; so too does David McCallum, Nicola Pagett, and the always memorable James Mason.  But the real knock-out performances here are by Sarrazin and Seymour, who truly blow the lid off our ideas of what a FRANKENSTEIN movie should be--and when they square off the result is unsettling in a truly unexpected way.  In terms of the DVD itself, the film quality is considerably better than the rare late-night showings I've occasionally seen on television, but I would not describe it as pristine, and I found I frequently had to bump up the volume on the soundtrack.

If you are looking for something with which to scare yourself silly, you might want to give this version FRANKENSTEIN a miss; although it has a few visceral moments, the jolts involved are largely psycho-sexual.  But if you are open to the sexually subversive, which is particularly unexpected in a made-for-television film from 1973, you couldn't make a better choice.  Recommended.

For it's time ""Frankenstein: The True Story"" brought wit, style and a visual flair missing from much of what was available on TV at the time.

The quality of the DVD isn't as good as it could be. The colors have faded and there's noticeable print damage throughout the presentation. I'm very very disappointed that Universal hasn't attempted to spruce this up more for its only probable incarnation on DVD. This is an excellent film with a terrific script that deserved the full restoration efforts of Universal.  This was a top notch film that deserved to have all the respect of a theatrical film. Audio is OK but presented with such low levels you'll have to pump up the volume a bit for the film.

The original prologue featuring James Mason is included but not as an extra. Instead, it's presented at the beginning of the film just as it originally aired. On the one hand I like the fact that it is presented the way it originally appeared on the other I had forgotten how much of a spoiler this was showing scenes and presenting major plot points from the film. You may want to skip this chapter and go to the start of the film if you haven't seen the film in a while as it might spoil your enjoyment of the film.

As mentioned previously the film doesn't have any extras beyond the usual previews. A featurette on this pivotal and important film would have been appropriate. With the quality of actors in the film as well as the setting and budget spent on the project I would have hoped for some extras.

The supporting cast includes Baker, Sir Ralph Richardson, Sir John Gielgud, Agnes Moorehead, Margaret Leighton, Michael Wilding, Nicola Pagett and other top notch actors in supporting roles. The performances are dazzling throughout. Although it might not have the gore and rapid pace editing that contemporary audiences are used to it has a terrific and suspenseful story.

**Minor Spoilers Ahead**

Driven to search and question the limits of life and death by his younger brother's death, Victor Frankenstein makes a perfect pupil for fellow doctor Henry Clerval (David McCallum, ""The Man from Uncle"", ""The Outer Limits""). Clerval and Frankenstein (Leonard Whitting from ""Romeo and Juliet"")collaborate on creating life from the dead. Victor is driven to science and the mystery of creating life by the death of his brother. When Clerval dies shortly before their experiment is complete Frankenstein continues on without him.  Victor transplants Clerval's brain into the creature. Clerval discovered that his process was flawed but was unable to communicate this to Frankenstein before his death. Frankenstein succeeds beyond his wildest dreams creating a ""human"" creature (Michael Sarrazin)who is handsome, a brilliant mimic and extremely bright. Things go awry when the creature begins to disintegrate becoming a ""monster"" and treated with scorn by those around him. This makes the creature bitter and angry particularly at Victor who tries to destroy it.

Clerval's rival and former teacher Professor Polidori (James Mason)comes across the creature and approaches Frankenstein with a new proposal; Clerval's methods were flawed according to ""Poly-Doly"" (as Clerval called him)but Polidori can create life with a different techique and superior outcome for the ""human"" female Agatha(Jane Seymour)he plans on creating. The creature discovers Victor's plans and havoc results. To tell more would spoil much of the plot.

The screenplay by playwright Christopher Isherwood (""Berlin Stories"" the basis for both ""I Am A Camera"" & ""Cabaret"" and ""The Loved One"")and Don Bachardy is marvelous taking some of the best elements of Shelley's story and giving the story a unique new twist as well. The TV film was nominated for a Nebula Award (writer's award from the Science Fiction Writers of America)and nominated for several Emmys. Directed by film & TV director Jack Smight (""The Twilight Zone"", ""The Alfred Hitchcock Hour"" and the Paul Newman film ""Harper"")""FTTS"" features strong performances from the veteran cast.

While I am disappointed at the quality of the presentation, I'm happy the film is finally available I just wish Universal had given this the budge necessary for restoring the film.

That famous feature, with Boris Karloff, is discussed relative to its casting (Bela Lugosi refused the part of the monster because the script denies the character any possibility of engendering pathos, as he saw it as strictly a killing machine; Bette Davis was offered the female lead by Whale but she was denied the role by Universal Pictures kingpin Carl Laemmle, Jr., since he believed that she had too little sex appeal; conversely, Laemmle wanted Leslie Howard to play as Doctor Henry Frankenstein, but here Whale opted for Colin Clive); cutting (shown are the notorious excised unintended death by drowning of a young girl at the hands of the monster; Henry's statement ""I know what it feels like to be God"", considered by censors to be more than slightly sacriligious); design (notably the startling electrical devices created by Kenneth Strickfaden, utilized again 43 years after in Mel Brooks' YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN, the equipment still in perfect working order.  The process by which Shelley wrote Frankenstein is treated in an interesting manner, and includes an overview of the literary circles to which she and her talented parents belonged, with her most renowned achievement resulting from an 1816 ghost story ""contest"" that Mary and her friends held in a snowbound Geneva, with her ingenious effort being stimulated by the newborn scientific discipline of electricity that obsessed the callow 18 year old authoress, isolated by severe winter weather in a region remote from that of her former home.  From the printed page to the theatre and on to cinema, Shelley's tale has been altered in many ways, as over one hundred versions have been penned for the stage by as many dramatists and there have been many motion pictures, the initial three featuring Karloff and these, in addition to subsequent entries, form the largest body of filmed works of those with a specific plotting subject, many of them sampled here including those with Lugosi, Lon Chaney, Jr., Glenn Strange, Christopher Lee and others as the monster, and there is also footage of somewhat unappealing interpretations, even these serving to emphasize the durability of the original.  Moore and others consistently point out that, in spite of an appearance that is not likely to bring an affectionate reaction from most viewers, Doctor Frankenstein's creature becomes a sympathetic character for some, as he is plainly a victim of his maker's ego, one of numerous Jungian/Adlerian/Freudian analyses that mark this documentary, most coming from American professors of English.  The act of cloning that has generated widepread public anxiety is discussed amid the large amount of Frankensteiniana that includes the monster's filmed appearances for advertising, popular music, television comedy series, and additional manifestations, in this valuable compendium that showcases what Kenneth Branagh refers to as ""a primal myth"" i.e., when man is tempted to exercise his will toward being a god.",1130025600,,3394,5.336448598130841
650717,5,6303454542,"I remember watching this movie on TV when I was a little kid.  Me and my sister were glued to the TV because it was such a good story.  We felt so sorry for the monster!  Over the years I thought of this movie and just the other day my daughter said she wanted to see all those old classic horror movies.  I said I have a really good one to start off with but when I started calling around to local video stores I soon realized it hasn't been in circulation.  They really should release this movie on DVD because from what I read here and from the people I know that would like to see it, someone has some hot movie rights in their hands.  Oh and I ordered the VHS copy but after reading it was chopped down a couple hours worth I cancelled the order.  I felt bad to do that but that's not what I want.  I want the full UNCUT version of Frankenstein The True Story!",1129766400,9,865,3.988372093023256

650719,5,6303454542,"I won't buy the VHS version that has cut out the most important scenes from reading all the reviews. When this comes out on DVD with all 4 hours intact then I'll consider it.  I read one review that says the same thing I've been thinking about for over 31 years that this movie made a big impact on me and I've had recurring dreams over the years of this spectacular Movie called Frankenstein: The True Story.  The Horror scenes stuck with me for years especially the scene where the Arm with Hand still attached starts moving by itself even though it's not attached to a human being. Yes, I was a impressionable 8 year old girl who if watched a Horror Movie had nightmares for weeks afterwords. The Scenes with Michael Sarrazin though didn't scare me even when he started to degenerate because I felt so sorry for him.  Jane Seymour's scenes should not have been cut out from this VHS version because she played a crucial role in the movie and played it fantastically(even when her head roled,YUK!) One of the English actors(David McCallum) in the Movie even went on to act in other U.S.A. T.V. Science Fiction Shows(Space 1999) and I had a longtime crush on him...Michael Sarrazin wasn't bad either(like yum!) When Amazon.com goes out of their way to put all 4 hours of the mini-series on DVD in it's full screen glory then I'll consider buying it.  I've got my Memorys and I guess I'll have to keep them until Amazon.com does something about this tragedy.  When it comes out on DVD in it's entirety all of you will want to buy the DVD believe me and chunk your VHS's.",1097798400,19,1570,4.494736842105263

was in my twenties in the 80's , ive had the biggest crush
on Jane Seymour espeically when she was queen of the mini series

650802,3,6303454542,"I had waited over 20 years to finally obtain a copy of this 2 part TV movie I saw as a child--the main reason I wanted it, is because I am a Jane Seymour devotee and I could recall that she did a wonderful job in her role as a ""Frankenstein creature"" in this movie. Seeing on the video carton that it was put on tape in 1995, at the height of her ""DR. Quinn"" popularity, I felt safe in assuming her scenes in this movie would be untouched and intact, despite the fact that an hour had been cut from this film when released on video...Boy was I wrong and what a terrible disappointment it was. There must have been a half dozen scenes focusing on her character, the resurrected Prima, that had been given the axe......ruined this great scary movie by pushing Jane's role to the side or should I say by leaving it in Prima's reanimation tank...",1047859200,4,842,4.26875
650803,2,6303454542,"This film was pretentiously promoted as a ""faithful adaptation"" of Mary Shelly's novel. What this is is a film that is just as far removed as most versions (perhaps even more so) with a few more elements of the original story than other films contained.
I find it pretty stupid that a ""Frankenstien"" film, especially one that claimed to be ""true to the story"" would have Frankenstein's friend Clerval (a rock climber in the book) as the scientific genius who discovers of the secret of life. This should have been called ""Clerval"" if he wasn't killed off so soon. All Frankenstein did was put his brain into the monster's body... and this is the ""True story"" ?! Also in the book, the creature is hideous and discusting to look at. Here, his starts of as very attractive and even attends operas and mingles in society before degenerating and becoming a little weird looking (never hideous). The addition of dr. Polidori (a name taken from Byron's physician and given to the Pretorius character borrowed from Bride Of Frankenstein) makes this film even more ridiculous. And once again it is HE that creates the bride, rather than Frankenstein. All Frankenstein does is brood over the fact that the creature turned ugly. Then the scenes where the monster is hypnotized and Clerval's personality comes out makes it almost unwatchable. This is indeed one monster of a film. It made no sense in it's entirety and in this condensed version it's almost random. I would hesitate to call this a true frankenstein movie. If you want a film that truly captures the spirit of the original novel, try Mary Shelly's Frankenstein, and Terror Of Frankenstein on DVD. (The latter is almost an exact enactment of the novel)Or stick with the 1931 version or The Curse Of Frankenstein.",1045094400,,1764,4.8250825082508255

650805,4,6303454542,"Probably the very best of the MANY Frankenstein films I've ever seen...and I've a LOT of them.
A more realistic take on the old story makes it all the more tragic as we watch the creature shunned and deteriorate before us. That kind of psychological and physical scarring combine to make a creature whose anger we all can relate to. You really feel for him.
Masterful work by all.
Please! A DVD soon!",1031875200,2,400,4.493150684931507
650806,5,6303454542,"Hardly the ""true"" story, but the best movie made from Mary Shelley's original classic and probably the truest to its spirit.
This video suffers from two things:  an overinflated cost, and the shortening of its total miniseries running time by about half.  Aside from that, it's great.
The elements and nuances in this script are more based on the true personal dynamics between Lord Byron, the Shelleys (Percy Bysshe and Mary) and Byron's personal physician, John Polidori, than on Mary Shelley's book.  Shelley becomes Dr. Frankenstein (playwright Christopher Whiting) and Byron becomes the brilliant clubfoot Henry Clerval (David McCallum)  -  who later becomes the monster (Michael Sarrazin)  -  with Polidori appearing in a role Mary Shelley never wrote, an alchemist bearing Polidori's name (James Mason) whose ideas for the animation of dead tissue Clerval steals and Frankenstein utilizes.  Mary herself appears as Frankenstein's wife (Nicola Paget), who despises his playing God and connivingly works toward the ruination of Frankenstein's handiwork but ultimately undoes only herself.  Even Byron's lover, Clare Claremont, seems to have been partly adapted into the monster's sociopathically soulless mate (Jane Seymour), a creature the monster itself finally dismembers in a memorably chilling scene.
The script is frankly brilliant, the performances (from an all-star cast) uniformly excellent, and the production  -  especially for a T.V. movie  -  lush and absolutely incredible.  The period sets and costumes and location shooting are worth the price of admission, alone.  It's intensely dramatic, highly suspenseful, stunningly original and darkly atmospheric.  The full version of this remarkable film occasionally makes the cable rounds, and if you can manage to see that one, by all means don't miss it  -  but this video is available until you do, and even at half the original running length, it's still the best Frankenstein ever committed to film.

A bad substrate will cause your player to hang and skip and quite often lock up when the disc itself has no dirt or scratches or any damage at all.
I was never able to finish watching the movie.

I have purchased 3 copies and not only do all fail, but they all fail in the same place.
Read that again...ALL FAIL IN THE SAME PLACE (between scene 6 and 7) virtually on the same frame.
This means.... it is a source problem.
A 3 hour movie on DVD requires a dual layer disc.

It is not your player or a dirty disc, this is a huge batch of badly produced DVD's.
