5674910,4,B00BUDDOAO,"I am one of those that really love Space: 1999 and had bought season 1 on Blu-ray.  When I saw this edition of season 2 and the words on the front saying ""remastered"" I had thought that all of the episodes had been remastered onto DVD.  This is not true.  All the discs are the same as you would have bought in the older separate sets, with the exception there is a bonus disc with three remastered episodes from season 1.  I was quite disappointed at this, though I am still glad I got the set overall.",1373846400,4,503,4.154639175257732
5674911,2,B00BUDDOAO,"What probably sunk this series is the changes Gerry Anderson and new producer Fred Freiberger made to the show after Season 1. For me, the changes were dramatic and not in a good way.

Season 1 established a strong set of regular characters and contained interesting, thought provoking science fiction. Artificial Intelligence, Birth of Mankind, the downside to immortality. I read once that these shows are a good example of where space based sci fi was going after 2001- A Space Odyssey (and before Star Wars which dumbed it back down again IMO). Black Sun, Collision Course etc. These shows were heavy on story but light on action. Not all of them worked because not all of the stories were interesting enough to maintain interest. Lose the strength of the story and what do you have left to fall back on? Another channel.

The second season replaces about half of the original cast members. Imagine if Star Trek had pulled this in the 60's. Characters Prof. Victor Bergman, David Kano, Paul Morrow, Dr. Bob Mathias (who vanishes after the first couple episodes in season two) leave without any explanation. They're replaced with Catherine Schell as the metamorphic Maya and Tony Verdeschi. While you know why Maya is there (explained in the first episode), you don't know why Tony Verdeschi is there. I think this change over didn't go so well at the time because they ended up bringing back character's Sandra Benes and Alan Carter who you will find absent during several of these early episodes. Later in the season, the main characters appear and disappear randomly. Maybe they could only afford Nick Tate or Zienia Merton or Tony Anholt for these episodes but not two or three at the same time. Even Landeau misses a few episodes in the final season. Sometimes, the stories don't even explain where his character is (see Dorzak). In the later episodes, Landeau also appears with a complete cast of unknowns seemingly at the expense of all of the other regulars who aren't in that particular story. At times he looks like an acting instructor surrounded by students (see Devil's Planet)

Also subplots of romance are more pronounced. These appeared on the fringes in the first season when it made sense to the stories but in the second season, they're just thrown into the script. Humanoid aliens turn up from pods floating in space and this leads to a scene with Commander Koenig kissing Dr Helena Russell and Maya disguised as Russell then asking him if he can tell the difference (see The Exiles). This may have worked in context to the story or even in the epilogue, not just sitting in the story. There is that and moments of light comedy. You'd think as they spend more time hopelessly wandering through space, they'd be a little more down. Many of the stories also ignore the search for a new home. The marooned on a moon crew of Alpha are simply mixing up with aliens, looking for rare metals, or going to asteroids, or avoiding collisions, etc. One episode is based around the settling on a new planet(see The Seance Spectre).

The second season also looks cheaper than the first. The design of the Alpha bridge is cheaper, the rubbery monster suits were also out in force this time around too. For the first time, the show is shot on location instead of a set (Journey to Where). Perhaps the reason this season looking cheaper is because it probably was cheaper. I can imagine the budget for the show being slashed after season one because the show mayn't have caught on yet in its present format.

Second season attempts to reach a younger audience with younger looking guest actors as aliens (not hard to do when you had Christopher Lee, Peter Cushing, Peter Boyles, Joan Collins, Brian Blessed and Leo McKern guesting in the first season) This may also be a budget issue for the show. Younger actors, subpar (in comparison to the established stars) acting equals cheap, affordable casting. In fact, save only for the first episode with Brian Blessed and the last with Patrick Troughton, I hardly recognize any of the guest actors (though you'll see a young Sarah Douglas in ""The AB Chrysalis"") in the second season and unfortunately that goes also for much of the crew. Even worse, the majority of the supporting crew are never given any time to develop their characters. They're just there facelessly serving to further to story of the four leads and the two supporting holdovers from season one.

What you get with this second season is basically, a completely different show from the first. The differences are so pronounced that you might even think it better as a weak, cheaper spin-off of some kind. I guess Gerry Anderson, and Fred Freiberger along with trying to broaden the market for the show may have run out of good stories from their staff of writers in the first season. They really did cover so many of the bases of Sci-Fi in the first season that it had to be difficult to come up with more.

These differences are a matter of personal preference. If you prefer action and find sci fi stories to be more than a little dull, watch this set. If you prefer in depth, interesting (most of the time) stories and don't care for rubbery monster masks and bad action sequences, then watch&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/SPACE-1999-Season-1/dp/B00BUDDMGU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">SPACE 1999 Season 1</a>.

If you're like me and are discovering this show long after the fact (it was already cancelled before I was born), then you should know these differences.

If you grew up with these shows then you'll want this and the first season for nostalgic purposes and for the quality of the sound and vision for each show on the DVD and Blu-Ray discs which is very impressive.",1371254400,10,5744,4.835198372329603
5674912,5,B00BUDDOAO,Just like the first season. It's a great classic. Sit back on a weekend and watch an episode or two. This show was done when good stories were the main goal. The special effects are cheesy but it's still cool old television. Glad I got it.,1369872000,,239,4.217391304347826

I later found out that the same people were involved on this as were principles in the series I rememberedl=.  Loved having this available to watch through Amazon streaming service.  Always foved the main characters when I saw them in Mission Impossible.  They are great actors in my opinion, and even seem believable in thiese roles where they are thrown into a pretty implausible plot structure where an explosion that is large enough to shift our moon out of orbit does not at the same time blow it to smithereens..  It then seems to travel out of our solar system at faster than light speed because it only took two weekly episodes to travel out of the solar system.",1435190400,,780,4.542857142857143

There are cheesy (Not back in the 70ies) space ships, aliens and lots of explosions as the moon hurdles through space! Also if you like Star Trek Next Generation you'll find that ""Resistance is futile"" was said on here long before the Borg got a hold of it.

5674944,3,B00BUDDOAO,"Grew up watching this... best Sci-Fi drama/adventure thing out there for a few years, and then in 1977, everything changed with Star Wars.  For it's time, it was hip, cool, and very low-budget.  That last part isn't always a bad thing if you have some good writers stimulating your imagination.  Unfortunately, some of the plots were not very thick, and the musical experimentation... the producers were firm believers that it is better to try and fail than not try at all.
Just when you got used to the Command Center in Season 1, they redesigned it in Season 2 without explanation.  Also, a main character was completely removed and another (besides Maya) added, again with no explanation.  The cool computer gizmo of the now-gone character, became the new character's beer-making machine.  It's almost as if nobody was steering the ship making this season, which is fine as long as you don't plan on a 3rd season.  Kudos to the actors and actresses that may have been under some recreational influences while attempting to work in this season.  A great effort.",1422489600,,1063,4.866666666666666

I was around 10 when I first saw the show, and yes, I loved it. Season 2 has a special place in my heart because of all the tweaks they made from season 1, as if they could improve on something so bad. Yep, they made it even cheesier. I'm a huge fan of both season 1 and 2 soundtracks - dramatic wind instruments and strings, driven by 1970s guitar riffs!!! They don't need to reboot or remake this one. Please. Let Alpha rest in peace. They never made it back, ok? Well then, may be a new show wouldn't be so bad. Hm, assemble a decent cast, writers, bring in some killer CGI to rip the moon from Earth orbit.

5674957,5,B00BUDDOAO,"Season 2 features the revamped, more colorful Main Mission as well as a few casting changes.  Don't expect big budget special effects; this was 2 years before Star Wars and made for TV, not the big screen.  You will I hope appreciate the incredible detail on the Moonbase and Eagle models.  Martin Landau I have liked better in other shows but I do love Barbara Bain as Helena, and I enjoy the banter between Maya and Tony.

5674958,5,B00BUDDOAO,"The  remastering of the  chapters is awesome. It is a very nice item  for collectors and fans of Space 1999. I never saw tthe end of  the second season  so  I  was expecting a better  final  chapter  for the second season ""The Dorkons"".  Actually, I am  a little disappointed  with it, since  the script is  very silly. Anyway, now it is history and  if  we take into account  that  Space 1999 was a science fiction series  of the 80's and one of the  best of its time,  actually it is not too bad.
What is important  is to  understand  that  this series  was  produced  more  than  30 years ago. Now  we  have  a better special effects and possibly better scriptwriters. That's  why  sometimes  the  special effects  seems to be  very silly and the  performance of the actors  sometimes  pretty bad.

Takes me back to my high-school scifi obsession.  Always a fan of Martin Landau in any role, he and his then wife Barbara Bain made a good pairing for the series. Made in the late 1970's you have to suspend disbelief for some of the special effects for what we are used to now with CGI, however, that being said, the models for the ships, the space station itself, along with alien visitors were well done and believable.  While there ma be a bit of overly dramatic acting, that's ok when you are rocketing through space torn away from planet earth with an uncertain future.  They certainly have their share of weekly adventures that usually have some morality based theme.  Not preachy, just pro-dignity.  It's just fun to watch and one of the series pioneers in the realm of scifi space travel.  Great gift for your scifi collector or yourself.  I like watching the series on my iphone on long plane flights.  Oh the wonders of technology.  Crazy how far we've come since 1999...Enjoy",1482192000,,1141,5.259668508287293
