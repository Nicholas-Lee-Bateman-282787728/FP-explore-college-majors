I like the fact he has also trained outside wing chun, this gives him a much better and balanced view / perspective on wing chun.",1448928000,,276,4.8936170212765955
8319768,2,B001LTZ5P4,"I have bought other instructional videos by Benny Meng and I do have to give him credit for his detailed information on Wing Tsun. I am a student in the Leung Ting lineage, and I realize there are going to be differences in how the different forms are taught in the different schools. I an currently without an instructor so wanted to move on in my studies to the third form until I had someone who could correct me.  Sadly when I compare what Sifu Meng teaches as Biu Tze, vs how Grangmaster Ting demonstrates it we are talking about two completely different systems. As I continue to learn the form, I think there may be some value in how Sifu Meng teaches some of the applications, but overall if you are looking to learn without an instructor I would skip this DVD and look elsewhere.",1448841600,,788,4.397260273972603
8319769,5,B001LTZ5P4,"Although, Im new to Wing Chun and studying under my female sifu gave me on how to properly execute the way how Ip Man does it the traditional ways. I hope there will be more videos that could be fairly affordable like these. I'm very glad I bought it. Hopefully I will get to the stage that someday I might teach with God's help and also very good for maintaining everyone's health.",1349049600,,382,4.319444444444445
8319770,5,B001LTZ5P4,"I hold a black belt in Goju Ryu and have studied martial arts for a few decades now. I own a great number of instructional DVDs about various martial arts. This DVD on Biu Ji by Benny Meng is one of the best I've come across (as are the first two in the series covering the first two forms in the Wing Chun system)!

It has the essentials, good clear filming of the form, well lit, and professionally done. Benny Meng obviously has the physical skills to do what he's doing.

But what makes this video stand out from many others is the quality of the verbal instruction that accompanies the demonstration of the form and the techniques that are shown. Benny Meng spends a lot of time explaining exactly what the point of each movement of the form is and its relevance within the philosophy of the Wing Chun system.

Many other instructional DVDs on martial arts will just show you the form or some techniques, and leave you to figure out what it means or how it fits within the system, or at best they will give you a very superficial explanation. But this DVD by Benny Meng is a step above many others because of the quality and thoroughness of the accompanying verbal instruction.

Excellent!",1262649600,,1194,4.463302752293578
