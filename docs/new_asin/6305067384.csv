7882171,3,6305067384,"Stanwyck plays the above character in a rather untypical role: that of a happy college girl who gets romantically involved with the now-forgotten Hardie Albright - who has been seduced by Communist propaganda....  Because of its anti-Communist theme, RED SALUTE was so notorious in 1935 that it occasioned a riot by leftist students when it opened at New York's Rivoli Theatre.  More than 150 students demonstrated with many being arrested.  Constance Cummings was originally to play the Stanwyck role in this variation of the IT HAPPENED ONE NIGHT theme. Without the anti-red preaching, it would have been a pretty decent comedy: it was re-released as RUNAWAY DAUGHTER with some cutting of the controversial theme, and was shown on TV entitled HER ENLISTED MAN (!).",1032825600,5,766,5.161290322580645
