8633152,5,B00HJUV48Q,"I have watched a lot of great TV series in my day.  The Sopranos, The Killing, Breaking Bad, Walking Dead, and Rectify I consider to be the best that TV has to offer.  I was introduced to Hell on Wheels from a coworker of mine who insisted that I would love it.  Originally, the name and the time period turned me off.  After an attempt at Dead Wood, I had no interest in watching a western series again for a long time.  Out of boredom, I began watching Hell on Wheels.  Admittedly, I felt it was a little slow compared to the others I mentioned above, but yet I still found it interesting.  As the show progressed however it got better, a lot betterso much so that I would say it deserves to be included with those series I mentioned above.  If you have a little bit of historian in you or if you are interested in knowing how the railroad was built and subsequently how our country was built than watch this series.  The detail put into this series is amazing and some of the views you will see are spectacular.  This series accurately portrays the hardships of life in 1865.  Beyond that, there are a lot of twists and turns, personal drama and shocking events that will keep you engaged throughout this series.  I find it hard to watch only one episode at a time. This is truly a magnificent and entertaining series to watch.",1441411200,,1330,4.340080971659919
