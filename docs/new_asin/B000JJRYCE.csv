8151053,5,B000JJRYCE,I've been away from ballet from some time although I am physically in shape from cross training. Being that my posture has become more slumped over the years I wanted to improve my posture as well as my flexibility and balance. I had my misgivings about trying this at home but I bought the barre and this DVD and started. WOW!  Finis is better than any dance teacher I ever had and prompts you in all the right places. I have seen a difference in just two weeks with overall flexiblility. I'm so inspired I'm going to order the floor work and my goal is to get on pointe in a year. Thank you Finis for waking me to the joy of ballet again!  The music is also wonderful. I can see myself purchasing all these DVD's.,1488153600,,715,4.211678832116788
8151054,5,B000JJRYCE,Great instruction by Finis Jhung.  Love it.,1469577600,,43,5.142857142857143
8151055,5,B000JJRYCE,"I rarely write reviews, but this DVD series deserves accolades.  Finis Jhung is a truly gifted instructor and the DVD series comes as close to a classroom experience as a DVD can get.  Not only is Mr. Jhung's understanding of technique (and how to achieve it) exceptional, but he also understands the best dancing comes from the energy inside you.  Even after a lifetime of ballet instruction, there are so many layers to his instruction that I feel like I learn something new each time I use these DVDs.  If there were more stars I would gladly give them to this DVD series.",1456272000,3,575,4.553398058252427

8151057,5,B000JJRYCE,"The other reviewer is right (and thank you so much for writing such a great review). This is a perfect video for people who just want a basic, old-school barre session with no flash. Finis Jhung has a pleasant demeanor and gives helpful, down-to-earth instruction, reminding dancers to maintain correct form, not force turnout, stretch, reach, etc. The demo dancer is excellent and easy to follow. It's just hard enough for me (a returning, rusty 40-yo dancer (in decent shape) with many years of classes as a child and teen)... and it's basic enough, so you can really concentrate on balance, strength and flexibility-building and form. I just got my copy in the mail yesterday and did it on my new free-standing barre today -- am very happy with it. And very grateful to other reviewer who took the chance on ordering it and then recommending it, as I think a good barre video might be hard to find. Looking forward to working it for awhile and going to the next level!",1325289600,6,971,4.651162790697675
8151058,4,B000JJRYCE,"I'm thrilled to be able to review this; I got this today and am so happy with it.  There are no previews that I know of available of this product, so I took a real chance. I could tell from youtube previews of Barre level 1 that it was too easy.

FJ Technique Level 3 Barrework is really for folks who 1) started as adult learners and have had adult learning classes for some time now and are looking to advance their skills to the advanced intermediate level; and 2) people who have had extensive dance training previously who are looking to refresh their skills and conditioning.  The key here is form.  A certain level of dance comprehension is presupposed. If you do not have a dance vocabulary, you might end up hurting yourself with bad form and poorly executed rond de jambes, tendues, etc.

This is not a snazzy, hip or 'cool' production; it is rather old school with the camera in a stationary position at an angle and never moving.  You do not get zoom ins though the camera is close enough to see detail and FJ is excellent at describing things like turnout and placement.  The footwork is not fancy; these are barre combos.  This is meant to mimic a real, quality ballet class barre component.  As such, it is true to life, and very very slow.  Any non-dancer or absolute beginner will look at this and think, ""piece of cake.""  However, if you pay attention to form, and you really must, you will benefit from extreme strength training and conditioning.  The attention to detail FJ provides his students is quite good, he is encouraging and really pays attention to form.

As with all true ballet classes, this class is anything but fast paced. It is slow, steady and precise.  All as it should be.  This DVD is clearly not for everybody; it is really geared towards people who are concerned with form.  If you are looking for a cardio experience, this is not it.

I highly recommend this DVD for serious students of ballet who want to perfect technique and advance their skills at home.  I would give 5 stars, but the production quality could have been better.  However, in the end, this is not a huge problem; the form and content are excellent.",1251331200,18,2159,4.518041237113402
