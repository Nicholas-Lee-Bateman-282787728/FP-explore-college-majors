8340659,3,B001T6KWA2,"There are good Peach DVDs out there...I've seen a lot of them. This isn't one.

In fact, this one is about as bad as they come. The only thing that redeems it are two really hot vignettes with the really hot Jana Jordan, which are part of this dumb NFL football trivia game, one of the extras. They are the most explicit things presented and before I found them on here, this review was going to get close to two stars.

Besides the stupid game, there is absolutely nothing about this DVD that fits with the football theme implied by the name (and on the cover), so I don't know why the producers went with that. Out of ideas, I guess.

The vignettes all are recycled from other Peach releases, and I swear it seems that they took the worst cuts from several of them, edited out the best parts of those and then stuck what was left on this DVD. Most of these girls are in the bottom third of Peach models. If you really like plastic-looking, unnaturally-round, unmoving breasts--and if you do, what is wrong with you??--you'll probably love it. Otherwise, go somewhere else. Shay Laren, one of the hottest women in the world, can't even save this because her vignette, a three-way with two other attractive models, is totally insipid. Unsatisfactory exposure, lame interaction, boring boring boring. I actually fast-forwarded.

Bottom line: Don't bother.",1359417600,3,1354,4.70042194092827
8340660,1,B001T6KWA2,"Miss Laura Lee is gorgeous, but the DVD does not do her justice.  She appears in the first vignette then is absent. If you're looking for large breasts look elsewhere (Danni Ashe DVDs). This is very tame stuff.",1268697600,3,210,4.526315789473684
