Noonbory is an AWESOME kids show with lots of upbeat music and easy to understand lessons. Even in my 30s, I was super bummed when they cancelled it on our Saturday morning cartoon station. I always enjoyed watching this cartoon although I can't stand most others! My toddler to school age children all very much enjoy this show and I'd highly recommend it. The characters are based on ""senses"" (the regular five plus common and non sense) - this adds a delightful cast of ways to explore the world and help each other out from various perspectives. It's really a great educational series on character formation for children! Check it out.",1349568000,2,884,4.8933333333333335
8389907,1,B0036EH3ZC,"Based on the series, this is not a Toon I would let my grandchild watch. I my opinion sets a bad example. Most of the time their eyebrow position denotes a ""Mad Look"". The big white blob throws temper tantrums and the super 7 seems to cater to his whim. So he gets rewarded for tantrums. This holiday version may be different though. I have not seen it but like I said I've watched the regular series and that is what I base my views on.",1290297600,,437,4.093023255813954
