3462281,4,B001AQT10I,"While it is missing the star Roy Scheider most of the time, he does do some episodes, and the changes kept things from getting stale.  However it appears that season 3 after years of waiting, is not going to come.  Still amazes me that we can get unlimited copies of the Beverly Hillbillies but not one release of this final season.",1267056000,2,332,4.426229508196721
3462282,4,B001AQT10I,"I watched this partial season, there are only 13 episodes, through Netflix.  And I'd really like to add it to my collection.

They were starting to go back toward the beginning of the show here but they axed the show mid-season.",1234137600,,228,4.536585365853658
3462283,3,B001AQT10I,"Seaquest 2032 - ""Season 3"" - Does have Sea Life, Scientific Research, and the Preservation of the Seas & Oceans in it.  Though not to the great extent that the first 2 Seasons of SeaQuest DSV had.  And to the development of the characters goes, I would suggest that Reviewer 232629 look back at the connection between Bridger/Westphalen & Krieg/Hitchcock in Season One and O'Neill/Henderson & Bridger/Dr. Smith in Season 2.  I don't think that the connection between Commander Ford and Helmswoman/Ensign or other Officer Rank Henderson should be BOOed because of the previous examples.

As for Lucas' development I beleive that it was okay because it shows that Lucas can't stay a kid forever and gives him more depth in that people have to change/evolve as needed to their situation.  The same for Dagwood and Tony Piccolo who both grow as characters.  Piccolo goes from being a misfit to ""An Officer and A Gentlemen.""  Dagwood has gone from cleaning SeaQuest/Childlike attitude in Season 2 to actually having a Grown-Up attitude in Season 3.

For Captain Nathan Hale Bridger (played by Roy Scheider) to leave SeaQuest was heart breaking but he did return in at least 2 other Episodes after the Season 3 Premiere.  As some would say, ""When you feel that it is time to leave, then it is time to leave.""  The same can be said for Lt. James Brody (played by Edward Kerr).

Though some changes to the show were not well recieved, that I'll grant, the changes to some the characters were well done in my opinion.",1230854400,47,1508,4.739463601532567
3462284,1,B001AQT10I,"Season 3 isn't a continuation of Season's 1 and 2. It's focus is on military sea control and nothing to do with sea life, scientific research, or the preservation of seas and oceans. Even the dolphin, Darwin, is written out. No Darwin, Capt. Bridge, or Dagwood by the end of the season. Even Lucas has turned from Science to Military service.

It pushes a personal relationship between Officers (Lt. Henderson and Commander Ford), which is ironic as it is improper in the military. The whole season is far removed from original story line as possible and twisted 180 degrees. It is awful!!!",1228780800,5,590,4.784313725490196

They can produce it in French but for we English speakers across the globe ( a much larger market and no need for the expense of dubbing or texting) we're given the cold shoulder. I realise it wasn't as good as its first two seasons but hey, it was far better than many SciFis on TV today and surely it has a strong market. So get on with it, cut the indolence, and release the product to DVD",1314662400,7,526,4.27

3462494,4,B001AQT10I,"I am not shocked that the studious will not bring out certain tv shows any more or even seasons, there are so many great shows that come out and only then you have to wait forever for the rest of the seasons, Like this season 3 I will be waiting a long time, Sad really that the people had to go or did not want to stay on but that goes with doing shows.
Here are some great shows that don't come out hart to hart seasons 3 and more.
Chips seasons 3 and more
and so many more why are you doing this companies come on
No wait until blue ray then you will bring it all out while the rest of us have to wait.
TO me it really stinks that if you own 1 and 2 of any season and have to wait years for the rest of the shows that is booooooooooo and more
TO me with shows like Hawaii five O coming out with almost every season soon like season 10 is out come on 3 more left then the seasons are done it went on for 1-12 years
I SAY BRING BACK THE SHOWS NOW, STOP MAKING US WAIT
BOO
BRING IT ALL OUT ALL THE SEASONS",1292716800,,1005,3.723004694835681

As a teen i did not get to watch season 3 when it was tv and am waiting anxiously for the release of Season 3. I too am hoping that it will be VERY soon.

3462496,5,B001AQT10I,I ordered this from JB Hi-Fi Online(google it) in Australia (kind of a national Best Buy there) and paid (current exchange rate then .97 American to 1 Aussie dollar) just under $40.00 (24.95 + 12.80 shipping before currency conversion via paypal...came out to 39 something - don't have it right in front of me) but it was worth it.  The set is NTSC and is region free. It is an official Universal Studios release of the season for those of you who are picky...it is not bootleg...it is released through ViaVision their official distributor in Australia.  It was supposed to take a month and I did have to wait a week while they got new stock from their supplier (and customer service is great!) but once it was shipped I had it in just over a week.  The set was in good condition and I was overjoyed when I found it would play in my USA DVD player!  So if you're willing to pay forty dollars and wait a bit to get it you can stop waiting on Universal to get off their collective behind and order this one (I didn't see any added bonus content noted on the box but I'll settle for the final 13 episodes and maybe add a US release later...and that's a BIG maybe).  I checked other outlets in Australia before settling on JB Hi-Fi because of their size and reputation down under and because the prices I saw elsewhere were way higher for the same thing and since I knew there would be a sizeable shipping charge I went with these guys and I don't regret it for a second. I've watched ten minutes of the first episode to make sure it's playable and excellent picture and sound quality (it is) and if there are any problems I'll come back and tell you.,1281571200,14,1647,4.31715210355987

8278755,4,B001AQT10I,"Even though there are several reviews saying the Australian release can actually be played in the U.S., I was still reluctant to buy it. I kept checking anyway & noticed jbhifi.com.au had it on sale so I decided to buy it & give it a try. I got it in 2 weeks from Australia to Michigan. On the back cover it says Region 4 & NTSC format, & Holy S**T! It plays on my Region 1 dvd player!! I love that I can finally watch season 3! The only thing that I think would make it better is if there was an episode list with summaries included with the dvd's.

8278758,5,B001AQT10I,"Lots of people talk badly about this season of Seaquest.  It was different from the other two seasons.  Season 1 did have the best crew and premise, but really, even then some of the stories were real stinkers.  It had promise and a lot of good moments, but it was still rough around the edges.  Season 2 had even less good moments, but still some, but was so very, very painful.  The stories were TERRIBLE.  But I remember reading an article in the summer of 95 about how, after watching Crimson Rage (submarine movie), the producers saw the error in their ways and decided to keep Seaquest in the water (as opposed to flying to other planets).  So I thought season 3 was like season 3 of Star Trek TNG.  There was finally some depth to the characters.  The stories were a bit more real (for science fiction). And season 2 had been so awful that almost anything would have been an improvement.  I think Michael Ironside was a great captain and he brought a nice new feeling to the show.  Watching the ""lost"" unaired episodes on Netflix, though, I was disappointed with the fate of Fredericks in the last episode.  She was an interesting character who could have been developed more.  And Lucas, of course, could have been developed less.  But all in all, it was a good season, and it should be released on DVD.  Soon.  Please.",1393113600,4,1327,4.489539748953975

8278762,5,B001AQT10I,I purchased Season 3 online through pointeighteight.com.au. It was the cheapest online that I could find of an official release. I tried it in a 10 year old dvd player and on my new bluray player and it works on both. It took about 7 days to get to me. I have the whole series now and couldn't be happier about it. My advice is to just get it from a retailer in Australia because I don't think that Universal will ever release it in the US. It wouldnt make them enough money considering that you can get season 2 now for about $8.,1362787200,2,530,4.105769230769231
