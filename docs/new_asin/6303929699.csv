7855533,5,6303929699,"Much Abu About Something: The citizens of Ziggerock are frightened by the thunder lizard, Tyrannosaurus Rex!  So they send a plea for help, & Aladdin & his friends come flying!  Little do they know only Abu holds the power to liberate the city!  This was a good episode.  Not fantastic, but it had good action, good humor & brought something to my attention:  How come there are so few dinosaurs in fantasy series?  B

The Day The Bird Stood Still:  Abis Mal wants control of Agrabah, & concocts a curse that will turn the Sultan into stone by sunset!  Except Iago becomes the victim of the curse, & the only way he can save his own tail is to sacrifice Genie!  Or will he?  I have to admit, Iago is one of my favorite characters in the series, despite the fact that he causes trouble.  His cowardice & greediness cracks me up, & this was a good spotlight on him.  Oh, & Abis Mal is funny as always.  A-

I still recommend getting this tape, especially if you see it at a thrift store (which is how I got it).",1365465600,,1009,4.2368421052631575
