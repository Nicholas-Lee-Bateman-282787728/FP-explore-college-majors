3435506,1,B0019F02U8,"I, like many others, was dazzled by Jaa's amazing athletic gifts, especially in the first two OngBak films. ""The next Bruce Lee, the next Jet Li, etc."" He certainly looked like the Next Big Thing in martial arts films, and we can always use one of those, right?  Well, if you're a Tony Jaa fan, then STAY AWAY from both of these films. They are not only AWFUL in themselves, but the brief scenes with TJ only serve to emphasize how lame, muddled, mindless and utterly BORING the rest of the films turn out to be.
Sorry, but neither film qualifies as ""watchable.""

And, by the way, how is it that some of the most intelligent and well-written films with gay and feminist themes have recently come from Thailand -- e.g., Beautiful Boxer -- while these two cinematic attrocities manage to pile on heaps of homophobic ""humor"" at every opportunity? The ""filmmakers"" appear to have been transplanted from another culture, far less sensitive and sexually sophisticated than Thailand.  Perhaps the US Bible Belt?  Hey, do yourself a favor, save the money.",1293667200,,1047,4.767955801104972
3435507,5,B0019F02U8,"I absolutely loved these movies.  I should warn everyone, though.  Tony Jaa is NOT starring in either of these movies.  He DOES, however, have a short cameo in each where he comes in, goes Muay Thai all over somebody's butt, and leaves.  It was awesome.  Also, the lead role is a fantastic actor and these movies are hysterical.  Another warning: the subtitles are REALLY BAD.  I thought it was really funny, because I love poorly subtitles foreign comedies.  Some of my peers thought it took away from the movie though, so be forewarned.",1289952000,,538,4.709677419354839
3435508,4,B0019F02U8,"It is rare that a sequel will out shines the first film, but the Bodyguard2 does that. Great action sceens and a lot of laughs.",1273449600,,127,4.12
3435509,4,B0019F02U8,"Bodyguard (4 stars out of 5)
*Was surprised to learn that this was less of an action movie and more of a strange comedy.  But it turned out to be rather fun.  The story and characters were simple and great.  The comedy was funny at times (even if it was strange), and the action scenes were slick and fun.  Altogether, it's quite entertaining.
*The movie has pretty good video/sound quality, but at times, seems to resemble a made-for-TV type of movie.  It has both English and Thai dubbing, and extras include a 30-minute making-of featurette.

Bodyguard 2 (3 stars out of 5)
*Although this film has bigger and crazier action scenes, the comedy seemed to fall short than expected.  And the story was quite different.  It still entertained, and would be good fun for those who enjoyed the first film.
*It has better video quality than the first film, and pretty good sound.  It has both English and Thai dubbing, and extras include a 30-minute making-of featurette.

They may not be masterpieces, but both films present a good array of action and comedy, and are generally fun.",1221523200,2,1077,4.711229946524064
3435510,4,B0019F02U8,"Not to be confused with the Kevin Costner/Whitney Houston schmaltzfest of the same name, this Thai action film is one one of countless gun-happy Asian action films that have come in the wake of John Woo's 1989 masterpiece, ""The Killer."" But 2004's ""The Bodyguard,"" directed by Thai comedian Petchtai Wongkamlao, is a goofball gunfest that owes as much to teen parody flicks as to Chuck Norris and Bruce Lee. While the bullets fly, minor characters crack jokes and various assassins emerge as bullies and buffoons -- the film plays it straight for only a second or two, and the rapidly rising bodycount is only half the fun.

In the first film, ""Bodyguard,"" Wongkamlao (an improbably nebbishy action hero) plays a personal bodyguard who fails to save the life of his billionaire employer, despite having annihilated the dozens of killers sent to attack. Disgraced, he is fired by the victim's son, a feckless playboy whose life is now in danger as bad guys try to take over his father's kazillion-dollar business empire.  (Don't worry too much about the plot, though: it won't get in the way for long...) The comedy keeps getting more and more outrageous: in the first half of the film, Wongkamlao streaks naked through downtown Bangkok, shooting at his pursuers while holding a cereal bowl over his privates... and that's just the beginning of the film!  In the 2007 sequel, we get the origins of the bodyguard character, in his younger role as a government secret agent uncovering corruption in the Thai record industry. (Again, don't worry too much about the plot...)

Both films, in addition to being entertaining and goofy, give interesting glimpses into modern Thai society -- ornate temples and shiny skyscrapers set next to ramshackle slums and vast junkyards filled with bony, desperate rag-pickers.  It's the kind of social commentary that works best because it isn't actually commentary at all -- it's just a simple presentation of life as it is in modern-day Southeast Asia. And meanwhile, the bullets fly, the bodies fall and the laughter rises... (DJ Joe Sixpack, Slipcue film reviews)",1218412800,6,2098,5.017241379310345

8273747,5,B0019F02U8,"These movies were great.  First off I was glad to watch a movie starring Petchtai Wongkamlao.  He was great in The Protector movies, and in Ong-bak, and now to see him in the lead role, was awesome.  Secondly the movie surprised me.  I bought this thinking I was getting an action movie, but this was genius.  I loved these movies, and have watched both numerous times.  They have become a classic go-to movie on rainy days, and one that will have me laughing, and quoting it for days after.  I highly HIGHLY recommend it.",1402185600,2,522,4.48936170212766

8273749,1,B0019F02U8,This was terrible!  Don't even bother! Tony Jaa makes a 10 second appearance so don't be fooled thinking he's in the entire movie.  He's not!,1371081600,,141,4.6
8273750,2,B0019F02U8,"I had some trouble following this. Normally I cut much slack for genre movies, but this one was just bad. The advertising that it features Tony Jaa. Tony is in the film - but not much.

Silly flick, bad acting and bad writing. It had some humorous moments. Better luck next time...",1361232000,,281,4.403846153846154
8273751,5,B0019F02U8,"A must see! Please watch in order though, i.e., The Bodyguard and The Bodyguard 2. The fact that Tony Ja  makes a cameo in both adds to the excitement.",1355443200,,151,4.206896551724138
