8677277,2,B00NBNS6JK,"I'm a huge wrestling fan and really enjoy watching independent films made on professional wrestling/sports entertainment. My opinion on this DVD is it's lack of talent/wrestlers. This felt like watching a home video of your friends uncle talking about the business and why they do it. There is no big names besides The Iron Sheik & Bullet Bob Armstrong (who in my opinion isn't a superstar). It's a long documentary, but is just very boring to watch. Long story short is if your looking for a good underground wrestling documentary, or good interviews done by past stars, this DVD isn't it. This is a documentary on small towns throwing on a show. Cheaply made and straight up sucks.",1436659200,2,683,4.796610169491525

8677279,5,B00NBNS6JK,"This is as real as it gets!  It was over 100 degrees in the Saks High School gym when ""The Maim Event"" was filmed.  Real journeymen professional wrestlers, some on the way up, some on the way down..  The crowd paid their money and expected a great show.  That's exactly what they got!  Wrestlers you know and some you don't know, but every one of them giving their all to entertain the crowd.  If you want a real look behind the curtain and inside the ring, I highly recommend ""The Maim Event"".",1416960000,4,494,4.315217391304348
