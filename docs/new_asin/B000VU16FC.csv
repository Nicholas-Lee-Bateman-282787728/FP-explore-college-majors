8219951,1,B000VU16FC,"This video is only TEN MINUTES long and looks like it was shot on worse video quality than old VHS.  It is like old home movies filmed in 60's or 70's.  Definitely NOT DVD picture quality!  But the shocker to me was the extremely short length.
How abusive is that to charge $15 USD for a ten minute video of poor picture and just OK sound quality.
I could kick myself for not reading the fine print technical details.
SAVE YOUR MONEY. There are other much better titles on Bali to choose from made by better production companies.
I intend to write a letter of complaint to the produce of this DVD that has their own website selling their travel videos. Boy, they sure sold me against buying any other of their products.

8219952,2,B000VU16FC,Amost takes longer to read the description than to view the DVD.  Sound & video quality low (probably shot on Super 8mm about 20+ years ago).,1198454400,,141,4.423076923076923
