8505688,1,B006WN5WW0,"I bought this version of Don Quixote, to compare with the Baryshnikov, from the Met. there is no comparison, this is a movie not a stage production which would make no difference if it was don properly, I was so disgusted with this performance I threw the disc in the trash, where it belongs",1506729600,,291,4.407407407407407
8505689,5,B006WN5WW0,A wonderful record of the great Rudolf Nureyev's great roles.,1427673600,,61,5.2
8505690,3,B006WN5WW0,Quality of the first act was very good but from the second act on the restoration becomes inconsistent. There are prominent 'cigarette burns' as well as scratches.,1397088000,2,163,5.074074074074074
8505691,3,B006WN5WW0,"While I am generally pleased that I replaced my earlier DVD copy of this work with the latest Blu-ray version (especially for the sharpness of the image and the improved color rendition), I am surprised that nobody has mentioned the Dolby 5.1 sound option. I have set the sound level of my LFE speaker to provide an acceptable level of bass response for my quite extensive disk collection that comprises a complete cross section of classical music and action/adventure movies, both in regular DVD and Blu-ray format. Unfortunately, when playing this disk at a `normal' listening level the bass response is so overwhelming as to be annoying and unbearable. It is really unfortunate that this disk can only be viewed  with the soundtrack set to Stereo.",1387497600,,750,4.9523809523809526
8505692,4,B006WN5WW0,I saw the current Australian Ballet performance before receiving this disc and was not at all impressed. I rather regretted ordering this disc a few weeks earlier. What a mistake it would have been to cancel it. The video very much shows its age but the performances are fantastic. Brilliant dancing with Nureyev in his prime. My wife and I quickly forgot about the video quality and were held spellbound by the dancing. What a gem! All ballet lovers should see this.,1365465600,3,467,4.7073170731707314
8505693,5,B006WN5WW0,"A worthy program to be given the Blu-ray treatment.  Somewhere between the story by Cervantes, and ""Man of La Mancha"", there's the ballet of Don Quixote with the music of Ludwig Minkus, and the choreography of Petipa.  At the height of his powers, Rudolf Nureyev came back to Australia in 1973 to serve not just as a performer, but choreographer and co-director of this filmed version.  Going through their paces on the large stage built in an aircraft hangar, Nureyev, Robert Helpmann and Lucette Aldous are all wonders to behold.  As you would expect with a dancer as one of the directors, the camera follows it all with just the right touch and without any gimmicks...we won't count the crane camera following Don Quixote riding the windmill blades back and forth.  As for the picture, the scenes in the marketplace in particular are outstanding, with the red, yellow, gold and orange shades looking even better than they did after the original restoration (shown in a bonus feature).  This is indeed a worthwihile addition to a performing arts Blu-ray library.",1335312000,3,1064,4.916201117318436
8505694,5,B006WN5WW0,"This 1973 film was an excellent candidate for remastering and Blu-ray enhancement, having a freedom of movement and spaciousness that astounds in this newest version; I believe it was originally filmed in an enormous aircraft hangar. Many agree that Nureyev was at his peak during this time, and his charismatic brilliance is most apparent here, backed by a superb cast. Nureyev closely oversaw all aspects of the filming; it bears his stamp. Not many films merit the trouble and expense of conversion to blu-ray; this performance however is one for the ages. Excellent bonus features as well.",1335225600,8,593,5.123711340206185
8505695,5,B006WN5WW0,"I'm not sure what the issue is with the other reviewer's comment about ""wrong speed""; my copy plays perfectly. I'm guessing it may be the wrong region for the reviewer's machine? For me, this was one of my first Blu-ray purchases, and I enjoy the colors, perspective and sound tremendously. Visually it is a delight; the colors and depth are far superior to regular DVD, while the performance itself is extraordinarily polished and professional. Great costumes and sets, pretty flawless dancing.",1335225600,7,495,5.1234567901234565
8505696,1,B006WN5WW0,"THIS PRODUCT IS A TRUE SCANDALE : THE PICTURE IS TOO FAST ? IT DOES NOT RUN IN THE GOOD SPEED . I would like to have my money back , because this product is very expensive .ROBERT CATANIA",1335052800,,187,3.8205128205128207
