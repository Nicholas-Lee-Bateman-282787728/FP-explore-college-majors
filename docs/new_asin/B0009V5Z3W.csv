8067235,5,B0009V5Z3W,"What I liked about this tape is the wide selection of disasters compiled together in one 45 minute show.  Star Trek's George Takei hosts with a vinatge introduction from little Shirley Temple from a classic Red Cross promo.  The old black and white footage that follows includes the explosive crash of the Hindenberg dirigible; the Lusitania and the Titanic; the astounding undulations of the Tacoma Narrows bridge as wind gusts at it's resonant frequency (I first saw that on in Physics class);  the San Franciso Earthquake and fire; various floods, early aircraft tests, and other spectacular disasters culminating in the vast devastation of the atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki.",1185235200,,695,5.243243243243243
