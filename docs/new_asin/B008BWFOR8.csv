5147202,5,B008BWFOR8,"""Lisa and The Devil"" (1973) was one of Mario Bava's last films and is one of his best, although ""The House of Exorcism"" (1974) which the producer Alfredo Leone made by re-hiring the cast and shooting additional footage to re-edit into ""Lisa and the Devil"" to make the film a kind of European competition for ""The Exorcist.""  It was a very poor decision, and one that seems insulting to Bava's superior knowledge of art and film-making.  And it is truly a testament to those misunderstood artists who are continually prompted to re-edit or change their works to suit a modern age that is shortly outgrown and a newer or wider audience is still on hand to appreciate one's initial rendering.  Elke Sommer and Telly Savalas star, Savalas used to peak effect, Alessio Orano, Sylva Koscina, Alida Valli and Gabriele Tinti star in the beautiful color film photographed by Cecilio Paniagua with a wonderful music score by Carlo Savina.  The excellent Blu-ray by Kino Lorber presents many extras for both films and is part of the International Media Films, Inc. Mario Bava Collection.  You couldn't ask for more.

5147206,3,B008BWFOR8,"I gave it three stars because I actually wanted ""The House Of Exorcism"" after seeing it at the old World Theater in Hollywood back in the day. I guess this also came out as ""LIsa and the Devil"" as well. They decided to give us both versions of the same movie, but with a different title. It was cheap enough, and I love this ridiculous movie.",1356912000,2,342,4.196969696969697
5147207,4,B008BWFOR8,"I originally got this on a PD version from Cheezy Films - and knew, immediately, that I had to own a good print of it! One of Mario Bava's (BLACK SUNDAY, DANGER: DIABOLIK, PLANET OF THE VAMPIRES) most surreal movies, LISA AND THE DEVIL tells the story of Elke Summer's Lisa, on a guided tour in Italy, who sees a portrait of Satan on the wall of a church - then meets a man who looks just like the portrait (Telly Savalas, a year or two before KOJAK) carrying a man tucked under his arm - or is it a mannequin that looks like that man? Lisa misses her tour bus, and accepts a ride from the aristocratic Lehar couple in a decrepit touring car which breaks down in front of an old, seemingly deserted mansion - and runs into the Satanic man again! He introduces himself as Leandro, the butler to the Countess and her son Maximillian who live there, and invites her and her companions inside. Once inside, it seems everybody mistakes Lisa for Elena - a woman it turns out the Countess's late husband and Maximillian had been the lover of! Leandro, meanwhile, provides comically put-upon, often snide running commentary of all the goings-on, including Sophia Lehar's affair with George the Chauffeur, Francis Lehar's murder of George and later Sophia and subsequent death, Maxmillian's obsession with Lisa who he insists is Elena, the man Leandro was seen carrying at the start of the film who turns out to be the Countess's late husband who's also obsessed with Elena, and so on. It all ends, either as Lisa's tragic damnation - or a sick joke depending on your point of view.

Savalas's Leandro, the butler who may be Satan, is the undoubted highlight of the film. Alternately cunning and downtrodden, obsequiously offering cake ""with chocolate sprinkles"", trying to sneak a smoke and having to quickly replace it with a lollipop(!) whenever the disapproving Countess comes by, ranting as he stuffs his face in an empty dining room after the meal in a scene both hilarious and chilling, he delivers what should have been a star-making performance a year before his first appearance as Kojak. Nobody else touches him in the acting department, though all are capable enough.

The original film was re-cut with cheap ""exorcist"" scenes to remake it into HOUSE OF EXORCISM after some unsuccessful screenings in Italy and at Cannes - which either was a financial success (according to Producer Alfredo Leone, who'd shot much of the replacement footage) or as big a financial failure as it was a creative one (Wikipedia). I'm not sure why the original did so poorly - it's a brilliantly subversive, darkly humorous supernatural thriller that I really think needs to be reassessed as the lost classic it is.",1355616000,4,2697,4.760683760683761
5147208,5,B008BWFOR8,"Mario Bava's Lisa and the Devil is, out of the 7 or 8 Bava films I've seen, my favorite.  It casts Elke Sommer as a young American tourist who is visiting a busy Spanish town with a friend.  After encountering a mysterious man in a shop, who it is suggested is the devil, she suddenly finds the town practically uninhabited.  After she hitches a ride with a rich couple and their chauffeur, the car breaks down outside a mansion.  After this point, the film becomes increasingly enigmatic; however, it is mysterious in a way I find fascinating and not frustrating.  In addition, the film's considerable visual beauty, haunting ending and the charismatic presence of Telly Savalas (as the devil) add to its appeal for me.  The Blu-ray looks very good overall, with some speckles I noticed occasionally being the one negative.  I haven't watched The House of Exorcism (also on the Blu-ray), which is reportedly a butchering of Lisa and the Devil made to capitalize on the success of the then-popular The Exorcist.",1353974400,7,1011,4.809248554913295
5147209,5,B008BWFOR8,"The story of ""Lisa and the Devil"" is the stuff of movie legends: riding high after the success of Baron Blood and A Bay of Blood, the iconic horror director Mario Bava was given free reign for his next project: the surreal ""Lisa and the Devil"". Sadly, ""Lisa..."" flopped at the box office in Bava's native Italy and desperate to sell it overseas, the film's producer basically butchered the film in an act of cinematic murder. The film's ending was removed, new footage of lead actress Elke Sommer was shot with actor Robert Alda, that basically turned the film into bastardized rip-off of the Exorcist, with the remaining footage recast as an extended flashback sequence about Sommer's characters being possessed.

For decades, the removed footage was considered destroyed until they resurfaced late in the 1990s, at which point the restored ""Lisa and the Devil"" was resurrected. The film's reputation, having grown over the years due to the butchery done to it in the name of making it more ""commercial"", was reappraised and it has since been seen as one of Bava's best films.

The Blu-Ray includes both cuts of the film, but trust me when I say you should stick to the original cut and shun ""House of Exorcism"".",1353456000,20,1213,4.7990430622009566
5147210,2,B008BWFOR8,"My purchase of this movie was like an impulse buy of chewing gum at the grocery store. The major difference between this movie and gum; There's a brief moment where I enjoy the chewing gum.
I first watched ""Lisa and the Devil"" and it was your typical B Movie from the 70's. I then watched ""The House of Exorcism"", which is pretty much ""Lisa and the Devil"", with deleted scenes thrown in to make it a tale of exorcism as a post-thought. If you're looking for a thriller that somehow missed MST3K's radar, you're in the right place. I'm giving this movie two-stars, because watching Telly Savalas offer a grown woman a lollipop is one of the creepiest things to come out of the 70's (aside from Pasolini).",1348272000,13,703,4.5

8526677,5,B008BWFOR8,"Slightly weird, moody Italian-made horror film.  Filmed by the great Mario Bava in the early 70's in glorious color.  A young woman (Elke Sommer, at her most beautiful), on a sightseeing vacation tour, is distracted by a mysterious man and ends up lost.  She is picked up by a power couple and their chauffer and end up in a mysterious moldy, decaying mansion occupied by the blind lady of the manor, her mama's boy son (who immediately becomes smitten with Elke), and the family retainer (the mysterious man), played by lollipop-sucking Telly Savalas.  Numerous violent murders ensue and it turns out that Telly is the devil and, with look-alike life-size manikin dummys, is manipulating the proceedings.  A classical piece is played throughout, adding to the doomed atmosphere.  Beautifully filmed, with lovely locations and sets.  Sylva Koscina is also on board and, though past her first youth, is quite beautiful still.  Some slight nudity is seen (the women of course).  None of it makes much sense, but is worth watching.  The House of Exorcism is Lisa and the Devil with different scenes thrown in and demon possession the theme.  I personally didn't like it.  Lisa and the Devil stands quite well on its own.  The Kino Lorber DVD is excellent quality with some extras.  Far better than the Image Entertainment DVD.  The Kino version is highly recommended.",1516492800,,1364,4.9734513274336285

8526680,3,B008BWFOR8,"being anti-religious and anti-Zionist in particular I find this type of movie comically insulting. Like The Exorcist which was a blatant Zionist propaganda flick attempting to once again scare idiots into worshiping Jews, this film isn't much better. Bava always achieves a level of stylish camera work utilizing decent sets, locations, lighting and color but this movie is a joke unless you're some servant of Zionists and actually believe in such nonsense. There isn't one modern HD video footage of some 'demon possessed person' levitating above any bed, with their heads doing 360 degree spins and waling on the ceiling etc... just Zionist propaganda to frighten idiots into obedience to elitists.

This movie is basically Elke Sommers acting possessed writhing around spewing obscenities at a stupid priest character, and Telly Savalas standing around supposed to be Satan in the background throughout most of the film.",1492387200,,924,5.372413793103449

Telly Savalas was good you're never quite sure if he's totally in on it or what the 'in' being the issue. I'm still not 100% sure what the movie is about but hey it looks good so there's that.

Also my BR copy includes 'The House of Exorcism' so will have to give it's 'sister' movie a go sometime soon too.",1463702400,,481,4.228260869565218
8526683,5,B008BWFOR8,"...don't bother with 'The House of Exorcism', it's terrible! but it is interesting to see how it was altered to be more ""commercial"", with awful results. 'Lisa and The Devil' is one of my favorite Bava films. It has a great cast, Elke Sommer is beautiful as always, Telly Savalas is fantastic with his lollipops and clearly enjoying his scene stealing role as a (satanic?) butler who tinkers with a heap of mannequins (or are they?) and eventually, dead bodies. Alida Valli and the gorgeous Alessio Orano are perfectly cast as mother and son, and Alessio's performance of a lonely, love sick, insane man is one of his best. I wish i knew why he wasn't in more films. Anyway, this is a surreal horror film with a twisted family and some unfortunate people who wind up at their estate, one bearing a striking resemblance to a woman who caused this family to fall into misery and madness. It has a beautiful soundtrack and is visually beautiful as well. The blu-ray quality is excellent, no complaints on that from me.
If you are a Mario Bava fan, this is one you should definitely check out!",1460160000,11,1089,4.589743589743589
