The film mirrors any developing society, a truly exceptional film. Well written and acted. A film worth collecting. BRAVO!",1468108800,,275,5.133333333333334

8615274,5,B00FFKBQPI,"Released in Serbia where it was made as `Parada', `The Guardian' called it `a cheeky crowd pleasing comedy' and I have to agree, but it is also much, much more. It features a gay couple Radmilo and Mirko. Radmilo is a veterinarian and Mirko is a designer and wedding planner, he is also a gay rights activist and wants to put on the first ever `successful' Pride Parade. When it was attempted in 2001 there was bloodshed and the police failed to act to protect the paraders.

A decade later little has changed and both men face homophobia on a daily basis, there is a bit of information at the start of the film listing some derogatory terms in Serbian such as `Peder' which is a pejorative term for being gay. This will come in handy as Radmilo drives a very pink Mini Cooper which is continually being vandalised by graffiti. Then he is presented with a gun toting thug whose pet Bulldog has been shot and ordered to save the mutt or he too will not survive. This is Limun (Nikola Kojo `Pretty Village, Pretty Flame') and he is also getting married to high maintenance Beauty parlour queen - Pearl. Only she wants everything to be done her way and that means hiring Milo.

Well to cut to the chase she threatens to cut off the wedding unless Limun and his ex war veteran mates provide the security for the gay marchers. Despite his misgivings he agrees and that is where the fun really starts - especially the constant references to `The Magnificent Seven'. That was one of the things that likens this to an Emir Kusturica film, who I think writer and director Srdjan Dragojevic must have been influenced by and I am all for that.

This is a laugh out loud movie that tackles homophobia, the scars of civil war and crime head on. It is done in such a way as to make all the characters endearing and plausible. There are loads of comic asides and buckets of well placed irony, keep an eye out for details in the background as nothing has been left to chance. This is also a very moving film, and had me all moist eyed by the end, even though it is gay themed there is no bedroom scenes as Serbia is still not ready for that by all accounts. This film was a complete joy and hopefully will get the recognition and accolades it richchly deserves.",1388448000,2,2245,4.391826923076923
8615275,5,B00FFKBQPI,"This is a terrific film that blends comedy with the truly deperate situation the LGBT community in Serbia, Croatia etc. are facing.  The cultural issues that stand outside of the LGBT theme come into full play and the viewer is left wondering trulu how has this happened to a group of people that essentially come from teh same roots.  This is a must watch!",1385942400,,357,4.5625
