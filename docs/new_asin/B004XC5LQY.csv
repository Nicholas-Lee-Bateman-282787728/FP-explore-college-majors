8446706,3,B004XC5LQY,"Fun movie, although the sex scene between the two leads Gloria Guida and Lilli Carati has been edited out. You really wonder why considering how much is out there now. Face it, it was kind of the lynchpin of the whole movie. So to cut it is stupid and offensive. Interesting to note that while Gloria Guida went on to make many more fun romp comedies, and a have solid career on Italian television, Lilli Carati on the other hand branched off into hardcore.",1523404800,3,457,4.4523809523809526
8446707,3,B004XC5LQY,"Here we have a 1978 film originally entitled to as Avere vent'anni, and directed by Italian director Fernando di Leo. The main characters are Lia (Gloria Guida) and Tina (Lilli Carati) who feel liberated from the traditional culture in their home towns and decide heading together to Rome. There, they join a communal home where they stay for free and have all the sex they wish. Things don't end as they have planned though after they leave this community and then met an aggressive gang.

This is an unusual film, even by Italian movie standards during the 1970s. After watching this film a first time, you may feel nothing really important is going on, not until you get to the very nasty end. The issue is that you may need a second watch to really begin making sense of the whole thing, including how the society at that time was extremely closed to free sex (particularly if practiced by women), and drugs. In case you still don't get it, you will have Fernando di Leos interview on the extras to get it for you. So, on the one hand, this is not a very entertaining movie, and not an easy to get and make sense. Yet, this is probably an interesting piece of film that matches the social and political context of Italy during those years and Fernando di Leo is quite critic about it.

If nothing of the previous information matters to you and you are trying to decide whether you should give it a try, I guess the abundant nudity of Gloria Guida and Lilli Carati may turn the tide. Both actresses are sexy and very attractive.

Technically, this Raro Video DVD release provides a good widescreen transfer. The important issue here is that this release comes with both the theatrical, censured version of the film (85 minutes long), and the uncut Italian version (137 minutes long). I think you need to go with uncut version to get what the Director meant. Extreme violence was an important element to this Director. This is a regular, NTSC, region free release. For those who care about the audio language, the movies come with Italian audio and English subtitles. That works fine with me. Extras include an interesting interview with director Fernando di Leo, and a nice illustrated booklet.",1485043200,5,2197,4.657216494845361

Picture quality is okay, sound is good, format is view-able. Not the original film so for my money not worth the purchase price.",1337644800,19,309,4.636363636363637
8446711,2,B004XC5LQY,"Daryl Loomis, DVD Verdict --If nothing else, To Be Twenty shares one thing in common with essentially every Italian comedy I've seen--it's not funny. I'm sure there are cultural things at play that I don't understand, and the Italians take the classical comedy/tragedy dichotomy much more seriously than other countries do, but I still didn't laugh a single time, not even the briefest of chuckles. In fact, there are only two reasons to watch this movie and their names are Gloria Guida and Lilli Carati. It's not for their acting skills, though, far from it, but they have plenty of other attributes which help to pass the time. They are truly a formidable duo of Seventies hotness, but beyond that, we're left with Italian men in bad pants and a disco soundtrack that's amusing in how it grates on the ears.

The fact that Raro included both cuts in their two-disc package does make for an interesting comparison, even if it does force multiple viewings of the film. When To Be Twenty had its original theatrical run, people weren't exactly expecting the film to pan out as it does. They left the theater unhappy and did not return, despite its popular and marketable stars. It was almost immediately pulled from circulation and returned to the editing room where they stripped off the ending, repurposed some footage from the middle, and pulled some film off the cutting room floor to make a new, altogether bland non-finish to end the film. Ten minutes shorter, they returned it to the cinema where, go figure, it still made no money. This shows that, while audiences may not like to have their expectations for a genre defied, they also won't take badly assembled, incoherent garbage. As a result, with nothing but its hot stars to sell it, To Be Twenty was left in Nowheresville.

But now we have Raro to thank for pulling it from the depths and releasing it in a very acceptable package. The two versions of the film look very similar and show a fair amount of restoration work. They aren't perfect, with the occasional bit of print damage and some dirt to work through, but the colors are quite good, especially for the indoor scenes. Outdoors, the prints look a little washed out, but it's more than many similar films receive. The sound is nothing special, although I would have appreciated the customary English dub; the translation is terrible and you're often left with four or five lines of dialog that go untranslated. It's not like the Italian track isn't a dub, but it's possible that an English dub was never made for the director's cut, so I suppose I can understand. Aside from the inferior theatrical cut of the film, extras include a very decent half-hour featurette on the history of the film and all its problems, which features the director, a few stars, and the son of one of the producers. They try really hard to justify what they made and it doesn't really work, but it's a well-intentioned piece. Lastly, we get to look at the original screenplay (since it's so fantastic), a photo gallery, and some biographies to close out the set.
