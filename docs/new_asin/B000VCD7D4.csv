8218017,5,B000VCD7D4,"My 5 year old son and I love the dialogue and action in this show. We look forward to it each week. Good plots, good humor, not too violent.

The episodes are available on Prime 1 day usually after they originally air. Would be nice if it was same day.",1462924800,,252,4.04
8218018,3,B000VCD7D4,"I ordered the season so I could watch the season. Then episode 2 was missing. Now its in the season and you want me to pay for it separately.
 Why would I do that when I own the season it self and episode 2 is part of the season. That makes no sense. Other than that I have no problem with the season. The kids and I love Transformers but don't want to pay extra for something I already paid for. Please fix this issue.",1460160000,,419,3.929411764705882
8218019,4,B000VCD7D4,"So far so good. Except for the Amazon mistake of placing ""Overloaded Part 2"" in the first season instead of where it belongs in Season 2. ***AMAZON ---PLEASE FIX THIS!*** I bought Season 2 sight unseen for my son, I thought I was buying a complete season (25 episodes) and then realized that the full season wasn't available yet. So I've paid $20.00 for 5 episodes (including episode 6 just released)....and I'm still short episode 2. Come on Amazon...this is an easy website programmers fix..move Episode 2 where it belongs!",1459123200,3,525,4.844444444444444
8218020,5,B000VCD7D4,"This review is for the show. The series is great, second season is picking up right where the other left off. With a fuller team than when the series started things have shaped up quite a lot.

Looking forward to the other episodes as they come out.

As for the 1 star reviews on this. I feel it's a little unfair to 1 star the show based on a mistake that Amazon has made.",1457481600,,373,4.027027027027027
8218021,1,B000VCD7D4,"This review is regarding Amazon cust.service and not the show. This is the 4th time in two weeks that I have contacted Amazon either by message or phone about the problem. Episode 2 (Overload part two) is listed under Season 1! That means if you purchase the entire Season 2, as we did, the only we to get Season 2 Episode 2 is to purchase it separately. NOT!  PLEASE, move this episode into Season 2 where it belongs!!!",1457308800,4,420,4.384615384615385
