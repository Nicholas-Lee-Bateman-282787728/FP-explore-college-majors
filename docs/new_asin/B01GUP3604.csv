8763588,3,B01GUP3604,"An OK movie with a young and likable Robert Wagner about Greek Sponge Divers from Tarpon Springs! The movies' geography is a little off (they have the Everglades as just a short boat ride away when it is about 200 miles away) but that's part of the storyline here. By all means get it. It's very entertaining and has a great cast that includes Gilbert Roland, J Carol Nash,Teri Moore and Richard Boone and great underwater photography!",1523750400,,435,4.662337662337662
8763589,5,B01GUP3604,"One family Greek the other WASP compete in the sponge industry off the western cost of Florida in the 50's. They have an unwritten law as to here they can fish for sponges. The heads of each house are proud and there is more than a casual rivalry among them.

Due to hard times the families cross paths resulting tin the son of the Greek family Tony Petrakis (Robert Wagner) and the WASP daughter Gwyneth Rhys (Terry Moore) falling in love their parents' chagrin. To really stir thing up Arnold Dix (Peter Graves) who also has eyes for Gwyneth is unscrupulous and does nefarious acts agent the Greeks.

I know you have herd the story before and probably saw Romeo and Juliet or ""Westside Story"". However, the story and actors make it worth revisiting.

The film has been remastered and looks great on large screen height definition televisions. The music of Bernard Hermann works as a subtle character its self adds to the mood and not overwhelming the story or dialog.

Gilbert Roland is the proud Greek patriarch that makes a sort of John Wayne entrance at the beginning of the movie. Richard Boone, a very diverse actor plays the girls father.

This is the first underwater adventure shot in CinemaScope.",1518998400,,1207,4.701421800947867
