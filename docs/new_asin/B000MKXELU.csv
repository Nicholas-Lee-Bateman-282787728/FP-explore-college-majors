8169505,5,B000MKXELU,"Well..this review is for the entire kyou kara maoh series not just for this volume. Very interesting plot..you won't get bored, probably one of the few animes that made me laugh in almost each episode. Highly recommended. Buy the entire series.",1185235200,2,244,4.975609756097561

The plot develops and the relationships grow stronger.  This volume of Kyo Kara Maoh had episodes that were side splittingly funny, and others to bring tears to the eyes.  The character development is superb and everyone is back where they belong.  There is a lot more background on Yuri, his family, and Ken Murata.  You also see some scenes from the past of the characters in the Great Demon Kingdom.  I look forward to the next volume.",1179100800,6,650,6.247191011235955
