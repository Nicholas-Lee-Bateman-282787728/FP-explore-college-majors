8255697,3,B0014H2RO0,"This is a movie about 2 female pool hustler's, an older more experience Elizabeth (Madison), and a younger Jordan (Grace).  The storyline and acting was reasonable. (This is not Macbeth.) They did there own shots in the movie, the pool playing was acceptable.  Early on we see that Elizabeth is the more experienced player who loves the game.  The problem I have with the movie, is that while they show a lot of pool shooting, they never develop it.  You never see Elizabeth showing Jordan how to practice or do shots.  You see a lot of developing hustles and bets.  The shots they do are reasonable, but there are a lot of set-up banks, with the object ball ""hanging"" close to a pocket.  Early on they are always playing on bar tables (small size), and only playing 8 ball.  The tournament comes around, and they play 9 ball.  The movie never explains the difference between 9-ball, and 8-ball.  I know the difference, but most viewers, won't know that when someone sinks a 9-ball on a combination, the game is won.
  It's a decent movie to watch but don't expect too much from the pool playing.",1482192000,,1096,4.564102564102564

8255702,3,B0014H2RO0,"Okay, I bought this movie imagining it would turn out completely different than what it really is. When I first watched this movie, I hated it. 2 days after watching, I kept thinking about it. I kept playing the scenes over in my mind and repeating the dialogue back and forth many times. There is soooo much I want to bag on this movie for. But... I don't want to because it is really a pretty good film, that from the looks of it was made with a zero budget. But all of the lighting in the film is great. The camera isn't wobbly like you would think. It is a very well put together film. This is definitely a memorable one!!",1264550400,3,626,4.139344262295082
