699855,5,6303674585,"The archeologists in this special are interested in the Bible as a book of history. They find it interesting to see if they can prove it to be a reliable source and apparently they have concluded that in most cases it is.

You will see places where Abraham walked or see the remains of the destruction of the walls of Jerico. This is worth watching to see the ""Mona Lisa of Galilee."" The pictures I've seen online are fine, but they don't quite show the beauty like this video does.

Eric and Carol Meyers also found a ""religious"" descendant of the original ""ark"" at the same time as the ""Raiders of the lost Ark"" came out. Coincidence or fate? Perhaps a private joke enjoyed by God?

Then we have the mystery of Masada which only gets more mysterious because the historical account points to a mass suicide, while not that many bones have been found.

This is perhaps the most captivating of the ""Mysteries of the Bible"" series.

699856,5,6303674585,"This is a documentary series of seven videos each of which features a different Biblical story:  ""Queen Esther, Far and Long Ago""; ""The Apocalypse, The Puzzle of Revelation""; ""The Execution of Jesus""; ""Arch Enemy, The Philistines""; ""Abraham, One Man, One God""; ""Prophets, Soul Catchers""; and ""Joseph, Master of Dreams.""
Balanced, thought-provoking, and informative is how I would describe each of the seven presentations.  The multimedia approach to telling the stories and in discussing their significance is both entertaining and engaging.  The use of art, video, and interview adds dimensions that are rarely expressed in Sunday school, church, or other settings.
Presented in historical context with the benefit of modern scholarship, the series describes the stories with their textual difficulties and their timeless core of truth.  Each of the presentations draws the viewers attention to the central mystery of faith and invites a closer look.  In brief, each of the stories comes to life to challenge the viewer in the same way as they must challenged their original hearers.",971827200,18,1084,5.428571428571429

Having studied the commonality of ideals of capitalistic democracy, communism and religion worldwide its disconcerting to find throughout the ages the majority of resources serving extravagance, hierarchy and consolidation of power often achieved and maintained through the exploitation, depredation and ignorance of the common man  - Not to mention the persecutions and ravages caused by related warfare.
Such social entities go great lengths to create the perception of order from chaos, then fill in the discontinuities with canned patriotism, the requirement of faith to obtain eternal life, or worse avoid eternal hell.
It seems many people need structure, ritual, definition  ...an iconic supernatural entity to embellish, plead their cares to, worship And integral reward system to derived security from being destined for eternal life.
Although within all creeds and religions there are exceptional individuals with characteristics and values worthy of emulation, its common to project lesser human qualities unto the character of the divine and worship, cater too and regulate others accordingly while depending on divine intervention instead of taking personal responsibility to create a sustainable world and purifying ones motives while realistically aspire to whatever brings about the greatest possible harmony for all things.
Must we subscribe to exclusive assumptions without reservation and continually seed the beds of worldwide ecological disaster, convolution, divisiveness and strife?
... And why not goodness for its own sake? What could be simpler, more purifying, self-affirming, divine in character ...and to the point!

Religions with by far with the greatest following are those having integral reward systems i.e. those that promise eternal bliss and other incentives for adhering to an assumed supreme doctrine. Though there are those of religious orientation with admirable motives, many delude themselves of having genuine love/devotion, the real fascination and motivation deriving primarily from celebrity like status and power of religious figures and promise of an eternally blissful after-life. Take away the embellishments: Business-as-usual insurance policy.

 Secure in being raptured and eternity bound beliefs based on faith rather than proven fact manifest into serious threats from a third of the world not sharing fully responsibility for critical issues such as over-population, environmental degradation and general long-term planetary sustainability.

 Personally I find the conventional Christian concept of salvation and crucification baffling. Was Christs sacrifice originally divine or necessary could such a love for humanity been demonstrated inspiringly yet in a less harsh, debt laden manner?

Unlike Christ with decisive foreknowledge of knowing where he came from and going Im didn't submit being born into a world of contradiction, confusion, injustice and chaos. I just want the opportunity to be accepted as an imperfect work in progress and live modestly in peace and harmony - Which should be an inherent birth-right for all things ...so is there a logical reason to be beholding or saved?

 If there be a divine entity he would not have the petty traits, egotism, subjugations, and inflexible technical judgments projected onto him by people, but qualities of compassionate commonality.

Regardless of orientation it would seem cultivating an open heart, mind, progressive nature and aspirational focus on whatever brings about the greatest possible harmony to all things without further expectation of reward the more essential integral qualifying, comprehensive, and purifying essence of spirituality and human potential.

Devastating Perfection: Many find reason to question the existence of an all-powerful God with so much suffering having occurred to the innocent throughout the ages. Was Jesus wondrously delusional in a beautiful way? Did his disciples pass on biases or exaggerate to have a personal sense of power, security and everlasting future or many thereafter delete, distort embellish to feel special, superior, exploit otherwise? Bearing in mind faith is just that; faith not fact, leaves one with the premise that if there is some kind of divine order then lifes primary purpose is to learn and evolve to interact harmoniously. Though there can be no doubt for those of progressive inclination living is a great character building, many experiences seem pointless and even cruel still there is hope: For just as its unreasonable to assume the existence of the divine, its also to conclude its non-existence, for as myself, many people around the world regardless of religion or otherwise have had similar miraculous experiences with a common thread with no other possible explanation other than being of divine origin (i.e. see oberf.org). Having exhausted logical explanations, could inexplicable chaos and confusion serve a greater purpose of purification of motive and goodness for its own sake in other words regardless of what the future may hold aspiring to whatever manifests the greatest harmony for all things and therefore our greater and truer salvation as a planet, race and individual?

Antidote for what may be a godless world: If we find transcendent beauty and compassion in ourselves and examples elsewhere then surely in the vastness of the universe are evolved worlds, dimensions and beings of empathy that have manifested such benevolent harmonious qualities sustainably.

Such certainty assures great possibilities here and beyond for beings throughout the cosmos of progressive inclination.",1428451200,,5705,5.634032634032634

7852564,1,6303674585,"What an incredible let down this video was. I was hoping to hear some mysteries revealed that have swirled around the Bible's Book of Esther. Nothing new here. It seemed that the narrative had so little to offer that it often repeated itself. Very boring stuff. I love a good documentary that's chocked full of interesting facts. This video doesn't even come near. As much as I like Jean Simmons, I can't recommend this video to anyone.",1224892800,,436,4.675324675324675
7852565,5,6303674585,I have always been a big fan of this Mysteries of the Bible series with Richard Kiley and Jean Simmons since it used to air on A&E.  I am very happy they made these available on DVD.  The series is very well done.,1209254400,2,213,3.9302325581395348

It doesn't have any performances appart from the intervewed persons. It becomes really dull after presenting one classic painting after another. I'm living abroad and wanted to have some of the same programming I had at home, but this definetely doesn't do it.",1172102400,5,410,4.871428571428571
7852567,2,6303674585,"Yuck! It would be so nice to see a balanced perspective. It's not apparent in any of the series out there on cable tv that they even try to get other opinions. This one especially. I trust and believe the Bible is accurate. This series does not. Buy ""The Stones Cry Out"" DVD from World of the Bible Ministries and ""The Second Great Battle of Jericho"" by The Associates for Biblical Research. Then you will get another perspective.

Haven't those in the media ever heard of The Near East Archaeological Society, The Associates for Biblical Research, The Institute for Biblical Archaeology, World of the Bible Ministries? Here is a list people that unfortunately many in the media forget about.
