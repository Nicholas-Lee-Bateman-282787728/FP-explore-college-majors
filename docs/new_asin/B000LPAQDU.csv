8505633,4,B000LPAQDU,"Donald Johnson and Kasia Kozak are EXCELLENT instructors.  Their dance DVDs are excellent.  My experience has been, so far, that the ""Anyone Can Dance DVDs, are very easy to follow and learn from.  Be careful though because some of the Latin DVD's are taught with the International style.  I'm a very frugal buyer, and I don't like paying $19.99 for this DVD, but I did and probably would again.  This is an excellent Samba starter package!  It is what it's titled ""Absolute Beginners"". This is an excellent DVD for beginners!",1237161600,2,526,4.788888888888889
