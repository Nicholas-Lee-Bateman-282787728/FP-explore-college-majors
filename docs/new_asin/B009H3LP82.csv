5335209,4,B009H3LP82,"Ok, this is obviously a low - budget type, made for Lifetime movie, which already puts this new spin on an old classic at a disadvantage.  That being said, I really liked it, and I'm in my 40s, not some lovesick teenage girl. This retelling has the quintessential perfect daughter - a staight A, headed-for-Princeton, everything in ziplock baggies, getting stranded on a Caribbean island with the brooding rich kid with a chip on his shoulder who keeps getting busted for flashing his pocket knife at school.  Classic opposites attack.  They go to Trinidad on a school trip to build a school, but one night end up on a party boat that gets busted by the police.  She falls overboard, he rescues her, and they end up in a dinghy.  He cuts the tether to the main boat to avoid getting in trouble with the police, and they are sent adrift.  They spend 100 days on an island before being rescued, so of course they fall for each other during this time.  However, it's not cheesy or forced, and it's actually a nice love story the viewer watches unfold.  Unfortunately, once they are rescued, both fall back into their stereotypical high school roles, with the male character incredibly hurt by his new love's rejection.  Will she come around and keep their love alive, or will she slip back into old habits of only liking boys her posse approves of.  Hmmm. ...you already know!  Thankfully, the beginning of the movie before they are stranded is brief, and the end before they reconcile doesn't make you suffer too long waiting for the happy ending.  Those parts are filled with supporting characters that add little to the story, and are simply used to get us from point A to point B.  The 2 main characters only interacting with each other is well cast and beautifully portrayed by 2 good actors who are also easy on the eyes. The movie in it's entirety moves pretty briskly.  The soundtrack is pretty good too, especially the song 'I Do.'  Loved watching this, and recommend it if you're looking for a love story to kill some time with.",1483488000,3,2035,4.598337950138504

5335212,4,B009H3LP82,"It took me long enough to watch this movie. I had actually bought it almost 2 years ago. I get that it was a made for ftv movie and you can kind of tell too but nevertheless, I still enjoyed it, particularly because of Brenton Thwaites, This kid has got to be going places, I have seen him in other things and he always comes through. Give him the part and he will nail it. Needless to say this is a very simple story and I don't remember enough of the original way back to make the comparison but to me this is a stand alone type movie. The story is what it should be the very popular girl and the not at all popular boy on the island and trying to come to terms with what has happened, and let's not forget what may happen if and when they get rescued. Indiana Evans as Emma, well she needs to get better at her chosen craft but she is tolerable. If you want some harmless and not obnoxious fun and viewing....here you go.",1478995200,,924,4.054644808743169

5335432,2,B009H3LP82,"Wow. Pretty bad. I would have given this movie one star, but it was at least enjoyably bad. That is, I didn't hate it.

The film snob part of me thought the actors weren't very good, and the screenplay and dialogue kind of sucked except for a few nice one-liners. But the realistic part of me found it hilarious how UNrealistic the setting, the circumstances, and even the storytelling was. As someone who knows a lot about useless wildlife facts, watching these two survive on a deserted island near Trinidad that somehow managed to be inhabited by hibiscus flowers (native to Hawaii), aloe (native to Africa - the medicinal ""vera"" kind being nearly extinct in the wild), plus orchids, jaguars, and capuchin monkeys (all residents of South America) not only showed the film's inaccuracies with regard to setting, but also suggested the ""deserted"" island must have been somewhere near a mainland for these species to travel there... anyway, production design definitely didn't do their job.

But even with nitpicking aside however, the story itself seems to fall much flatter than even the source material did (the original Blue Lagoon, which wasn't that great either, but was still leagues ahead of this film). The characters themselves are about as reliable as shaken-up soda cans, constantly jumping from one emotion to another. When they're not having sex, the remainder of the film is consumed - not with fishing or hunting, or you know, SURVIVING - but with weird slo-mo jumping scenes where the male character just... hops around to irrelevant music. Usually followed by another makeout sesh.

Needless to say, this movie is a lot of fun to laugh at. Of course, I wasn't expecting greatness out of a TV program, but it was enjoyably ridiculous. Definitely a great flick for gathering up some film friends for a night of WTFs. All in all, a very good bad film!",1448150400,3,1866,4.8801261829652995

I watched this only because it was available with Prime with no extra fees. If you're looking for a movie with depth and originality then you will be in for a boring cliche movie. There are some funny and sad moments throughout the movie. It does make you wonder how you would be able to survive on a deserted island in real life.

I find it funny how there was just one panther, monkey, and of course coconuts and bananas. The producers also didn't bother to give the guy a beard or the girl hairy legs. For me it made it somewhat less believable, but I wasn't expecting anything going in.

5335818,3,B009H3LP82,"This was an okay movie if you suspend your belief for awhile. It does NOT show how they survived on the island.  Things are shown, well, I'll put that at the end under spoiler alert.  My main goal in writing this is to comment on the Australian actress, Indiana Evans. Yes, I understand that's her real name. I was a huge fan of Cindy Mancini (the late Amanda Peterson) in Can't Buy Me Love and thought I'd never see a girl with those qualities again. But I was wrong. Emma (Indiana) looked amazingly like her (Amanda). Didn't anyone else notice that? Watch this movie for Indiana Evans but don't expect a believable story.

Spoiler Alert: They survived 3 months with a jaguar close by and they never ran into it until the end? How did the boy kill the jaguar. With his bare hands? Not possible. And that monkey at the end? Where was he the rest of the 3 months? They got water by filling a plastic bottle all the time? She kept wanting to brush her teeth but they looked awful clean. Thei hair was always combed and their clothes (especially that skimpy bikini) never frayed or looked dirty? Sunburn? Remember the monkey stole her sun cream. They slept together the entire time but she was sure she wasn't pregnant, how could she know that? Her mom and his dad stayed out there and searched like forever but when they were found they waited until they flew back on their own? They had bananas and coconuts but never saw them on the trees. Besides those bananas were not the wild kind. They has a spear  (?) but never saw a fish. They swam all the time and never ran into a shark? Okay, I've just scratched the surface but that's enough.

5335878,2,B009H3LP82,"This movie is ALL fantasy, which I guess is okay if that's your cup of tea, but I like for movies to be at least somewhat realistic.  Fantasy is two good-looking teenagers with knock-out bodies, falling for each other on a deserted island.  Her hair is perfectly curled every day, and he has zero problems staying clean-shaven -- not so much as a little peach fuzz, let alone a beard.  Fantasy is these two teens having unprotected sex for three months and her not getting pregnant.  Fantasy is these two teens being able to stand being near each other without deodorant and toothpaste for three months.  What I really want to know though is how the hell this girl survived without a razor, toilet paper, tampons, soap, and shampoo?!

Reality is being stuck on an island like Tom Hanks' was in Castaway, where his hair morphs into a bleached curly mop on his head and he loses like 80 pounds and thinks a volley ball is his friend.  Reality is making fire the old fashioned way, having to use an ice skate to knock out a bad tooth, and growing a long straggly beard.  Must be nice to live in the fantasy world!  Poor Tom Hanks.

Blue Lagoon:  The Awakening is pretty cheesy, but I guess it is sort of a cute love story, even if it does promote per-marrital and unprotected sex -- without the nudity, of course.  The acting was just so-so.",1436918400,2,1338,4.438524590163935

Both actors are not big stars, Brenton just recently being in The Giver, and Indiana only being in H2o. I can say this plot had multiple climaxes, which made me more into it.

I actually think the acting is as good or maybe better than the original.  It has no explicit nudity or sex and no bad language; does have implicit nudity and sex.  It also has implications about family love. It is about a boy who is unhappy because he thinks he is responsible for something bad.  He is concidered nice by the only girl that knew him before his bad experience.  He is nice and thoughtful; but troubled and a loaner.  He is considerate, too.  The girl, who he refers to as prom queen, Emma, is one of the most popular girls at school and prom-queen material; but unlike a normal prom queen, she is nice and thoughtful.  She does not look down on Dean; but is nicer to him than he is to her; because he expects her to be the normal prom queen type. These are complex characters.  The story is good and believeable.  The dialog is good.  The delivery and acting are excellent.

In addition to the romance issues, it dealt with how grief can disable, and the process of recovery, developing your own values, and the biggest surprise for me was the issues of survival and how it effected their relationship.  She always had a plan and part of the plan was keeping her partner functioning.  The ending was good.  She decided that the relationship was worth keeping alive.  The adults do not dominate the script, but the parent child issues, and coming of age are really well done.  What values do you accept and what values do not fit.  The romance was great, the leads worked, and the movie is re-watchable for me because of all the side issues in the film.  I watched on prime.",1428019200,,746,4.56390977443609

The story and scenes and chemistry between the two leads are wonderful. *Slight Spoiler* The guy and girl feel that attraction to one another throughout the movie which is a nice touch, from beginning to end. What frustrates me is the fact that after the two are left together on the raft you would think that he'd be directed to be a tad more kind. He wasn't a jerk, but you got the impression before that he wasn't going to come off as that kind of irritable. There is irritable done right and wrong, this wasn't as great as I'd hoped for in that scene. There were wonderful scenes, but at the same time you'd think someone would take their chemistry into account. If they had gone heavier, the two of them could have handled it. Believe me-the guy could have handled the maturity that he seemed to have a lot of the times and she could have handled her softness and not being so abrupt at times. I would have enjoyed more flirting, more long looks. It came off at times as slightly choppy. Even at the end when he shows up at the dance they could have made it more climatic.* Please, we've all seen teen dramas. Roll your eyes if you will, but people aren't stupid-give us more depth, you'll have us hooked that much more. Like I said great movie-I just wished that they could of used what they had and given us more angst and a smoother flow. They had all that they needed-they just needed to use it better. But I am glad that I bought it. Even if it weren't ""related"" to the 1st two Blue Lagoons, I would have still been glad that I bought it and plan on watching it again.

5336347,4,B009H3LP82,"In the third outing in the Blue Lagoon film series, the producers have given this fresh eyes and written a romantic film that's neither dumb nor a titillating romp but quite satisfying as a teen love story.

Aussie actor Brenton Thwaites is Dean the school's bad boy while Indiana Evans is good girl Emma. While on a school trip to Trinidad to build housing they join the other students on a carnival boat party - she falls overboard, he follows and they get stuck in a dinghy before floating to an uninhabited island where they remained marooned. The two opposites (she's straightlaced and organised, while he's impetuous and wilder) have to survive and learn to support each other. Naturally romance follows!

As said, there's plenty to enjoy here. Thwaites is a total natural - he has terrific energy onscreen and looks downright handsome. Evans is a stunning beauty and plays up Emma's cautiousness well. The scenery is truly beautiful and there's plenty of light and shade as we watch them gather food, build a shelter and enjoy themselves. I liked the fact that there's no nudity (obvious as it's made for American TV) and it doesn't exploit the young characters. The sex scenes are suitably romantic but it's not all about the love story here - Dean's carrying some serious baggage from his mother's death and Emma learns to step out on her own and embrace life.

It falls over a bit with the one-note supporting characters. Denise Richards and Patrick St Esprit are the parents gravely searching the Carribbean for their kids and fearing the worst. The supporting cast of teenagers is particularly bad her annoying bestie Lizzy who harps on about her screwing the uninspiring quarterback and her truly annoying little sister just grates on you but hey it doesn't really matter as we're not too far away from our leads most of the time.

One of the best things about this? The music! It's truly killer! Acoustic pop songs to sweeping romantic numbers - just check out the youtube fans to see how they excelled with the soundtrack.

I realize that he probably won the part largely for his looks, but his acting was 100% above and beyond all the others in the cast. He was 100% believable for the role.  At the end, when the girl Emma with whom he shared his life for 4 months stranded on the island returns to her family and friends and  apparently backs away from/rejects Dean, the hurt and depression Brenton Thwaites shows as Dean is awesome....thtoally believable.  One can actually feel the hurt and rejection coming from hm.  That's a sign of a good actor.  No wonder he now is in Maleficent, The Signal, The Giver, Ride, etc. (all in one year).  He's a young man who very well may be the new Tom Cruise.  Awesome.

Now these savvy kids just know they're in trouble, maybe someone will come looking for the blonde valedictorian whose family has money, but almost less certainly so for the troubled rebel loner whose family also has money.  Well, Mr. Ripley it ain't.  But for about half an hour in the middle, the young stars carry off a pretty cute and entertaining little pas-de-deux that sacrifices neither the erotic lushness of fantasy or the realist perspective of modern media kids suddenly cut off from media and doing a fairly good job of saying and doing the right things anyway as they go along.

It was truly heartwarming and it was so different from the 1949 original and the sequels of 80 and 91 that it really shouldnt be considered a sequel at all!  In fact, I actually preferred this modern story to the original one.  I even liked the soundtrack and Im disappointed that none of the songs seem to be available for purchase.  I also liked that Indiana Evans characters name was Emmeline which was entirely consistent with both the 49 film with Jean Simmons and the 80 sequel with Brooke Shields (and, like Simmons, Evans was around 20 when this was filmed rather than a prepubescent teen a la Shields and Jovovich).  Giving her the last name Robinson was a cute reference to The Swiss Family Robinson and Robinson Crusoe who were both stuck on desert islands.  The only thing I didn't like was the vast majority of the dialogue during the last 8 or so minutes of the film;  it was ridiculous!  Is that the best they could do?  They should really consider dubbing something else in and risk having it look like some 70s Chinese Kung Fu movie rather than leave it the way it is!  Any mention of Steven the Quarterback after they made it back to civilization, especially the I told him Id think about it regarding the prom, was patently absurd!

5336391,2,B009H3LP82,"I give this two stars because Christopher Atkins has a cameo appearance in it as (surprise!) a high school teacher!  Otherwise, it would have been even better if Brooke Shields had made a lightening quick appearance in this movie.  I am glad that Atkins has a sense of humor about his past and doesn't make a big deal out of his former teen idol status, in fact it's kind of sweet that he takes the time out to appear in just such things that share the names.  But those are the only two good (or one good and one potentially good) point I can give for this movie.  Otherwise, this is some teen drama that uses the title of Blue Lagoon which really doesn't have much to do with the original save for a few cosmetic features.

The two teens (gorgeous and nubile) are on a class trip to Trinidad when they get separated from their group and end up stranded on a desert island together.  While the whole time I was betting that they were actually on the empty side of the island and they would find a Holiday Inn complete with pool and bar on the other side, this is predictable and kind of annoying.  They are, naturally, from different crowds in their high schools and have a resentment towards one another.  Then when the days start to drift by they realize they have to put that angst aside and work together in order to survive.  And then they do what comes naturally.  Denise Richards as the gal's MOM?  Well, she is a mother in real life who could, possibly, be Em's mother in real life, but she comes off as far too bitchy and stiff to be liked at all.

As I said, the only positive about this is Christopher Atkins's appearance to give those who remember a little smile.",1379980800,,1676,4.319488817891374

5336466,5,B009H3LP82,"I thought the actors did a pretty decent job when you compare them to the other versions.  I know you had to suspend belief for much of what happened on the island but I was OK with that.  It is a tv movie after all.  I liked how they showed the differences in Emma and Dean's personalities.  She is more practical, goal oriented, have a plan, organized, worrier, social butterfly.  He is more carefree (with those he cares about), aloof with others, naturally positive thinker.  He reminds me of my cocker spaniel.  That dog loves me and my other dog Juli.  He tolerates other dogs but isn't really interested in playing with them at the dog park or day care.  He pretty much ignores them because he only wants to be with Juli.  To me, Dean was like that.  I think he enjoyed being on that island with Emma, just living free.  He was interested in her before and on the island he had her all to himself.  I think after they returned to the world, he just wanted to be with her- no welcome back parties, no prom.  She played the waffling teen girl role well.  She got back to her life and tried to recapture what she had before, without him.  I could see a teenage girl being like that (Oh, he's not so popular, we never hung out before we were on the island, he's kind of an outsider, and we're not on the island anymore, and I'm kind of liking being the popular center of attention right now, but I care about him, but what would everyone else say, he's cute and we did stuff on the island and now I'm confused).  I liked this tv movie.",1361318400,14,1538,4.230240549828179
5336467,2,B009H3LP82,"Let me say this first, there's no violence, nudity, or bad words. It's all pretty much PG to maybe PG-13.

This movie is everything you expect it to be. There are two young people stranded on the island, old news. They fall in love, have sex, and do the whole survival thing - way old news. The sex isn't where you see it, but after they're done.

If you seen the other movies, then there's nothing really new about this one that is a must. You can either watch it or not and it won't matter because everything is too predictable in the whole movie. Sometimes it gets kind of irritating to watch the two on the screen because it all just seems too stupid to watch.

What's the difference from this and the other two movies?

Spoilers below.

----------------------------------

Spoilers below.

Well this time, it's more of a modern movie and the setting is in the year 2010s. These two young couple have parents and when the kids get lost, the parents keep on looking for them during the movie. There's no one on the island but those two lovers. There's not even natives on the island. There are no visitors that goes to the island - until they are rescue. When they do return home, the two slowly learn to live in society again, but the two don't exactly know how they feel about each other yet. But, at the end, of course, they fall in love with each other again.

5336470,4,B009H3LP82,"Granted this is definitely not one of the best made-for-television movies that I have seen but it is a lot better than the one made decades ago with Brooke Shields in it.  Unlike that one this movie actually has a plot.
  It is about 2 teenagers from 2 different groups in high school who are attracted to one another but never speak.  Emma is super organized and never questions anything.  Dean is a loner who is left alone by his father more often than not.  Both are fairly nice people.  Then, of course, they trapped on an island together.  While on the island they fall in love.  Dean opens up to Emma and begins to get over his mother's death.  Emma learns to loosen up and to take things as they come.  Both teenagers mature a great deal.  Once they get rescued Emma is uncertain of how to deal with home.  She and Dean sort of go back to being the way they were before, but they can't change the fact that they've both grown up or that they still have feelings for one another.  Emma goes to prom and takes her little over-looked sister as her date.  Dean, with his father's encouragement, shows up.  Dean stands out in the rain.  Emma comes out and they get back together and end up having their first dance at home in the rain.
  The acting is not so bad.  The setting is beautiful.  All in all this is not a bad film.  I would reccommend it to anyone who likes made-for-television films and who likes romantic movies.  But for anyone who wants more than that, this is not a good idea for them to watch or buy.",1356480000,8,1520,4.256140350877193
