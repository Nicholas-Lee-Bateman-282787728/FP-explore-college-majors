This particular disc looks at three sculptural masterpieces: Michelangelos David, Degas The Little Dancer, Aged 14 and Rodins The Kiss.  As usual in the series, we have three works of art, each analyzed separately for approximately 45 minutes by art critics and historians.  The commentary is geared to what is particularly interesting in the work.  In the Michelangelo, e.g., the artist is working with an awesome piece of marble, a piece of stone so vast that it was attempted by two previous sculptors.  By the time Michelangelo got his chance the marble slab had been sitting around, waiting for him, for some thirty years.  Originally intended to sit upon the Duomo in Florence it was actually appropriated for the city center by the powers that be.  It was hidden during the war and eventually reinstalled.  Copies are now made, using power tools; the process takes about a year and requires the work of multiple artisans.  Michelangelo did it himself, in two years, using three chisels.  I would have expected more discussion (there is some) of the fact that the arm/hand are out of proportion to the rest of the body.  It was fascinating to learn that the sculpture was physically positioned, in Florence, to suggest Davids role as the defender of his people.

The Degas Little Dancer is discussed in the context of the world of the dancer at the Paris Opera.  These girls were often taken as mistresses by season ticket holders and they were associated with experience rather than with innocence.  The girl is identified and some of her personal history detailed.  The original work was done in wax and the commentators discuss Degas reason for that, along with the important differences between his actual work and the bronze casts that were done later.  The shape of the little girls head, particularly the forehead, is discussed in the context of contemporary views of evolutionary advance.  The artists intentions (to the degree that they can be determined) and the reception of the work in contemporary Paris are both quite different from the modern responses that one usually sees.

Rodins work is probably very personal, since he commonly socialized with his models.  The work is discussed in the context of Dantes Inferno, since the sculpture is a representation of Dantes Paolo and Francesca.  Particular attention is given to the many copies of the work and the fact that its iconic status has made it omnipresent.

These presentations are simply fascinating.  Bravo to the BBC; this is the sort of thing that they do brilliantly.",1506988800,,2613,4.958620689655173
