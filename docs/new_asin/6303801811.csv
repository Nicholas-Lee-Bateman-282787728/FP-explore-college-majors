8184059,3,6303801811,"Not the worst way to spend 90-ish minutes.  Lots of very nice girls take their clothes off with a plot a see through as your Grandma's pants.
The highlight of the film (for me) was Julie K Smith.  She does about three sets, which is about a billion too few.  With short blonde hair and full breasts, the girl just steals the show.
Would I buy it?  I already have.
If you want acting and story like The Shawshank Redemption, you'll be dissapointed.  If you want gorgeous women with very few clothes on, you should buy this.",1006560000,6,522,4.34020618556701
