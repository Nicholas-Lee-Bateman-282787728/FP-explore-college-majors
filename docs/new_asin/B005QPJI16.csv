This is probably one of my most favorite movies and it is shown only rarely on TV.  This was the only vendor I could find to purchase this movie.  Unfortunately, about 30 minutes in, the video stopped working.  The sound stopped too.  I tried a few different things to see if I could get past the problem but nothing worked.  Fast forwarding made the problem even worse.  It is so unfortunate that these classic films aren't more widely distributed; they really are treasures.  Perhaps the problems I experienced were an isolated incident.  It's a shame because this is a really great movie.",1405123200,3,733,4.708661417322834
8483545,5,B005QPJI16,"This great movie stars Rosalind Russell playing the boss to Fred MacMurray who takes the job of secretary to Rosalind Russell who is really hiring as her date/partner to land big business account. One account shes trying to get is the account of actor Carey MacDonald who is off women. Russell hires MacMurray as secretary and use him as bait for Carey's sister who is his partner. Russell plays hardball but likes MacMurray, he tells her he cant fall for her because a brain with no pulse (no feelings).  Carey falls for Russell while Murray trying to
stir up feelings in Russell using Carey's sister to make her jealousy. So the games of emotion begins. Great movie and plot a must see as one of the classics.",1400889600,,711,4.5984251968503935
