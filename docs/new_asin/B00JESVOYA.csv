8650335,5,B00JESVOYA,"Excellent live action version of Steins;Gate! Great choice for the characters. I purchased this knowing there were no subtitles. I have watched the anime of Steins;Gate 5 times, twice in Japanese with subs and 3 times in English plus I've been studying Japanese, so I have been able to mostly understand what was going on in the play.

A few things about this DVD:
As I mentioned earlier there are no subtitles.
It is region 2 so it won't work in Region 1 DVD Players, If you watch DVD's from Japan this is a worthwhile investment.
It doesn't follow the exact storyline of the Anime Series, but still makes sense.

All in all this is an great product. The picture is very sharp with close ups where needed. I would recommend it for any Steins;Gate fan.",1508889600,,752,4.522058823529412
