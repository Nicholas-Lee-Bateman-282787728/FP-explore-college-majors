7955358,2,B00005UQTW,"It was a great idea that needed more added to it.  With only one ending it wasn't worth the money we paid for it.  It took my spouse and I less than one hour to figure out who did it.  When we realized that was it, we were very disappointed.  Now we are finished with it and will not watch it again.  If it had alternate endings it would be worth the money we paid.",1109376000,3,365,3.8133333333333335
7955359,2,B00005UQTW,"Don't get me wrong.  This is a very cool idea, and a well done DVD.  Yet, with the capabilities of DVD, I expected something a little more complex and a little more of a movie to watch.
The concept of mystery DVD is exciting!  I was thrilled at the idea, but was let down upon receiving the DVD.
In essence, there isn't much there.  A few short clips to watch and some evidence and reports to read.  An interrogation of 6 suspects takes place, which I thought would be really cool, but you don't participate.  You hit play, and watch.
It is a complicated mystery, but there is no audience participation at all.  Just up to you to sort out the evidence and arrest a suspect.
The main thing that I would have liked would have been a set-up movie.  A back story.  Get to know the characters and see some sort of short movie.  That doesn't happen, instead you READ a report that gives you a back story.
The concept is awesome.  Hopefully, somebody will take this idea and build upon it.  DVD is capable of storing at least 10 hours of information, yet STAB IN THE DARK has less than an hour of things to keep you busy.
Once you figure it out... it's a coaster.",1019088000,4,1156,4.252293577981652
7955360,3,B00005UQTW,"This is a fun DVD, it really makes you do the police work. However, once you have solved the mystery, you are done with the DVD. There are no alternate endings, so really, it is just a play-once game.",1017964800,3,200,4.153846153846154
7955361,5,B00005UQTW,Cool new way of looking at DVDs. More people should do this.,1010448000,,60,4.083333333333333
7955362,5,B00005UQTW,"We sat in front of the screen, not knowing what to expect. It seemed appropriate for an Interactive Mystery Game that we should feel unsure about what was going to happen next.
And then we got the DVD menu. So simple to use. Intuitive. Each click through the menu gave us additional information about the murder and who was involved. The evidence mounted ever so slowly. Along the way, there were plot twists and turns.
The humor is dry and quite witty. The storyline is interesting and not predictable.
Some of us were able to guess ""whodunnit"". But the plot twist at the end was quite unpredictable and well done.
""Stab in the Dark"" is the first truly interactive murder mystery. The DVD medium gives Mr. Landau the tools to spin a wonderful tale while involving the audience in every step of the investigation and discovery.
""Stab in the Dark"" is appropriate for teens through adults. Kids will enjoy it, too, but they need to have the attention span and ability to solve mysteries. I think kids would have fun doing this as a family activity, and I do believe it is a very good teaching tool for analytical thinking.
Enjoy this DVD. We certainly did!",1008720000,2,1154,4.606796116504855
7955363,5,B00005UQTW,"A first of its kind DVD Stab in the Dark brings new light to the murder mystery genre.  As an avid reader and critic of the Murder Mystery field, it is my opinion that ""Stab in the Dark"" is a 5 star must buy for any mystery lover or movie watcher for that matter.  Not your typical DVD Stab in the dark investigates a murder of a Alledged Hit man turned informant who was murdered hours before he was to turn himself over to the authorities.  With a Strange and Comic cast of characters, there is good humor in the interrogation aspect of the DVD.
The bottom line is David Landeau brought something new to an old and stale genre and hopefully will make more in the future.  A MUST BUY for anyone with a good taste in movies and who likes to have fun",1008547200,,749,4.144827586206897
