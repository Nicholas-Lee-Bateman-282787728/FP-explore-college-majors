The  film is directed by Chester M. Franklin based on the novel by William Makepeace Thackeray. This is one of the Pre-code's that is an absolute joy to watch full of wicked amoral behavior & plunging  necklines.

Loy's Becky is much nastier than Miriam Hopkins' version 3 years later in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Becky-Sharp/dp/B00022LJ7O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Becky Sharp</a>. Easily you can imagine Jean Harlow or Clara Bow in this role, not the future MGM's Miss Goody Two Shoes; which  is who Myrna Loy became. Yes, before Myrna  Loy became MGM's Miss Perfect Sweetness America - she was actually  an actress!!; which makes her ""Vanity Fair"" & ""Emma"" MUST-SEES!
VANITY FAIR was Loy's follow-up film to EMMA, in which she played a bratty and greedy daughter who almost destroys the loyal housekeeper (played by Marie Dressler).

What makes Loy's fallen character so tragic is that she's supposed to be ""genteel"". Loy is the focus of all scenes & she has many outstanding/memorable scenes, such as the gambling scene in the casino where she tries to steal another woman's winning roulette bet! The more Loy's Becky loses her morality, the more beautiful she gets until she is finally ""caught."" Watch out for a rather shocking ending.

Myrna Loy is absolutely stunning and gives a very solid performance.

3169191,3,B00176X81O,"The draw to this film was that it was Myrna Loy's first starring role. Loy's acting presaged that of a class actor. The supporting cast was sufficient. Film quality left something to be desired, close caption saved the day. The movie was after Thackery's Vanity Fair novel, and to be fair I have not read it. Many times novels don't transfer well to film. The story is set in England, perhaps early 1920s. It concerns a young woman (Loy) who enters into the child care aristocratic world really as a pretense for finding a sugar daddy. As the movie progresses she moves up the societal ladder. As she says in the film, ""men want one thing from me...sex, and I want one thing from them...money."" As years go by she gradually runs into hard times and as the movie ends she is older and penniless staring into a vanity mirror. Probably the best outcome for her. This was a precode film. It served a good lesson for adults about the possible ravages of promiscuity. Ironically, had this been a code film it likely would have been unequivocally morally correct; she probably would have ended up in prison, a suicide,or murdered.

3169198,5,B00176X81O,I loved seeing this movie and miss Loy did a great job in her acting. Of course times were different in those days. And technology was so very different back then. This move shows how people or folk are into getting rich and will do anything to achieve it. Even to loose the best thing they ever had. And in the end even to hitting rock bottom and losing friends by using deceit. If miss Loy we're alive today she would have been considered a Conservative. Even though she was a liberal and she says so in one of her interviews. She would be shocked at how liberalism has changed. There was some tech issues but if resolved. It would be worth seeing it again I saw a short piece of it on youtube and I must say it was much better. And I must say I love all her movies. This is the first time I saw it I hope maybe some day there will be a remake of this movie. I would buy this movie if the issues we're fixed. Just to have it in my movie collection anyway thanks for sharing. This movie had some good morals like character and integrity and loyalty and value if one looks for them.
