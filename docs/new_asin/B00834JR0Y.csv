5124298,5,B00834JR0Y,"Finally, the movie industry has given us a film worth watching. For years we have been watching movies with mediocre acting and with repetitive plots and predictable story lines. This movie defy's all of its predecessors it is intriguing and will keep you on the edge of your seat the entire time. Nowadays it is very uncommon to see an effective villain in Hollywood, not only is he effective but he has a very convincing and moving partner. Together they bring a darkness and depth to this movie. All of the protagonists in this movie show self sacrifice and learn to care deeply for one another. At many points one persons sacrifice saves the rest of them. Survival is what they strive for and they undergo many hardships and emotional turmoil. Their battle for their lives is intense and moving, only their teamwork can save them. At some points in this movie there is scenes that may be suggestive and crude, however they are brief scenes that are quickly passed over. Many movies don't put out a real effort when it comes to the computer animation, this movies graphics are amazing. The sharks are so realistic they jump off the screen. Whoever created the graphics for this movie should receive awards and heavy applause. My hope is that hollywood uses this film as an example and creates many more memorable and fantastic movies.",1397865600,4,1337,4.742489270386266
5124299,5,B00834JR0Y,"I have to say aside from it's overly serious tones and mature themes this movie is one of the best I have ever seen. The actors were well chosen from probably the most prestigious acting houses in London. There was a bit of nudity but you expect that in a film that pushes the envelope. The special effects were so realistic I had a hard time believing that this was just a movie. The plot was well written  which is something you just don't see these days in Hollywood. The dialogue was very natural and scenes progressed in an organic manner. Sometimes it was hard to tell just who was the villain, the protagonists made some morally ambiguous choices and the ""bad guy"" was very likeable even if his goals were in the end evil. Overall this is a great movie, I can see why TV channels would try to cash in on it by naming their shows after it (Discovery Channel).",1397865600,4,865,4.339506172839506
5124300,4,B00834JR0Y,This was a good movie  but too bloody. It is adventurous and suspenseful.  It keeps you interested; it isn't a boring movie.,1390262400,2,124,4.590909090909091
5124301,3,B00834JR0Y,"This show is for the shark-completest only!  Definitely worth a watch (just keep in mind, this is from the asylum!)  Asylum junkies, like myself, will eat this up!  The price is right, the quality . . . , and the shipping/arrival time was quick.  I'd say, go ahead and get it!",1389657600,,276,4.352941176470588
5124302,1,B00834JR0Y,"This movie is truly bad. The story doesn't make much sense, the acting is really bad, the CGI is really bad, and the ending was the worse of them all.

I the story could had been good. A drug lord goes crazy after seeing his son die. Now he wants to kill everyone that was ever involved with the case to die. He kidnaps 8 people go to his island and put them in a survival game against different species of sharks every day. He would give the survivors little help ever day for killing a shark and moving on to the next day and event. What I didn't like about the story was the ending and how it was done, but more on that later.

The acting in this movie is terrible. The actors are unrealistic and don't make me believe in what they say. The story was written were you don't really connect with each survivor or learn too much about them, so you don't really care for them when they die. Also, the actors don't read their lines that well and they are reading some really bad cheesy lines too. When they pretend to fight the CGI sharks, they don't look like they are really into it and it's hard to believe that they are actually fighting anything at all. Furthermore, they always look dumb and puzzle when a shark appears.

Now for the CGI. This is one of those movies that doesn't have any good CGI at all. Yes, all the sharks do look like sharks, but you can tell very easy that it is a CGI creation and they don't look real at all. Some people that say bad about good CGI don't know anything until they see Shark Week's CGI, they will flip out and praise good CGI afterwards.

Finally, I want to talk about the ending. This ending has to be one of the worse endings that I have ever seen. Yes, one person does make it and that person does get their revenge by ending the bad guys. What doesn't make sense is how he/she does it. You would think that a drug lord would have guns, body guards, or some kind of protection huh, well towards the end that just doesn't exist and it is thrown out of the window.  The drug is taken down in a ridiculous fashion and doesn't even put up a fight. Also, where the last fight was, just was too dumb. That for me it, this movie is a 1 star movie!

Save your money and time and never watch this movie. If you watch it, I hope it is just to learn how bad this movie is.",1377820800,,2307,4.092920353982301
5124303,1,B00834JR0Y,Worst purchase I've made in a long time.  Predictable story with horrible 'special' effects (if you can call them that).  Don't waste your time or money and just watch Jaws...again!,1364342400,,181,5.0
5124304,2,B00834JR0Y,"SHARK WEEK is yet another in the endless list of SyFy's sharkoramas.
This time around, a psychotic drug lord (Patrick Bergin) and his sadistic girlfriend (the always laughable Yancey Butler) drug and kidnap the people Bergin holds responsible for his addict drug dealing son.  The usual suspects:  the son's best friend who was supposed to handle the sale; the undercover cop who managed the raid;the addict girlfriend; the judge and prosecutor; the investigative journalist who covered the story, and even the EMT who couldn't resuscitate the boy!
SHARK NIGHT goes on forever with sappy dialogue and poorly staged shark attacks.  Bergin's vengeful scheme is a game pitting the victims against various species of sharks from vicious pups (a hilarious scene) to the infamous great white.
SHARK WEEK is interchangeable with all SyFy killer shark flicks and is barely watchable.  But rest assured, there'll be more sharkfests coming!",1344124800,,930,5.3061224489795915
5124305,2,B00834JR0Y,"There are several so-called facts that surround the eight characters in this horrific predicament and one thing that was actually quite cool was that they use these facts to fight these sharks as they pick them off one by one. In some ways you could totally tell this was directed by Christopher Ray (Director of Mega Shark vs. Crocosaurus and 2 Headed Shark Attack) because, well.... for one when the sharks attack not only do they use the same sound effects in a few sequences but they show them charging at the people and taking bites out of the non-existing human (well only in the CGI shot they used) The sharks do look really cheesy but at least they made them look accurate you see they used several kinds of sharks in this movie (everything from two month old sharks to the fearsome great white shark) and tell you the truth I did feel a genuine suspense when they entered the great whites domain.... something about being a wicked small boat in the ocean where a twenty something foot great white is stalking you just made me feel uncomfortable or maybe it was just some of the CGI they used in that scene... I don't know.

Plot:  A mad man named Tiberon is hosting a deadly game of life in death and the eight contestants quickly find out that they are being hunted by no man, but a series of sharks (new ones attack everyday for seven days hence the title.) Soon everything is considered a weapon and they have been promised a single better weapon every time they kill a shark. Can anyone survive a week filled with a lot of resting and deadly sharks!

Review: now when I say a lot of resting I meant it. It seems every one or two scenes the people need to rest and I understand that it is to make character development but seriously they can't be that tired from walking a few hundred yards (I'll let it pass when after they fight a shark.) Now I will admit that the plot could've been better and in some ways it did seem like a bit of a rip off the Shark Night 3D cheese fest but unfortunately this film was worse than that. Some of the special effects were just bad. I mean did you see them jump off the edge of that rock (it looked like.... well... really bad CGI) There practically was no gore, just a lot of blood in the water where as  two headed shark attack people were getting torn apart like crazy. This time it does munch, munch, and bleed. Also some of the dialogue and lines in the movie where just ridiculous such as ""I already killed your who*e"" and then follows ""The who*es are replaceable"" There were a lot of problems I had with this movie Patrick Bergin wasn't one of them though. This movie made him look utterly psychotic. And don't even get me started on the climax it was like ""Oh we're running out of time and this movie still need an epic end"" and then it most likely followed with ""Just end it"" All in all this film felt overly rushed.

Acting: Hey, it's David Arquette.... oh wait, no, it's just some guy named Frankie Cullen who was actually my favorite character... I wasn't sure if he was really part of the survival test or just another one of Tiberon's (Patrick Begin) Men. As goes for the acting... it was passable

Gore: None, just red water.... unless you count non-shark related deaths, that's when you get an exploded body and a stabbing.

Bottom Line: It was definitely a little under decent sorry to say... I tried to take it seriously in the begging then just tried to have fun with it the other half but it never ended up being superb in any sort of way.

Suggested MPAA: Rated R for violence

Is it worth the Buy on a scale of 1-10: 3
For the Movie itself on a scale of 1-5: 2",1344124800,2,3630,4.318649045521292

8524285,1,B00834JR0Y,"How this movie got more than one star eludes me. I have seen some pretty bad B movies that still hold true to some form of entertainment, but this one shouldn't even qualify as a ""B"" movie.
The story is about several strangers who are brought together on a an island owned by a wealthy, psycho millionaire who all share a common bond (which is revealed throughout the movie). They must try and escape the island which is full of booby traps and sharks, which i thought would be very interesting, and could have been if it was written and performed correctly(which in my opinion was NOT).
Here are the cons: The acting was just flat and uninteresting, the shark attacks were silly and unrealistic, the characters were unbelievable(they seemed bored by their own lines). I am not just trying to bash this movie because I really wanted to like this movie...it was just too corny.
The pros: The location was beautiful! Had the acting and special effects been better this movie would have been AWESOME!
I did laugh some, but it was inappropriate, it was usually when someone was being ""attacked"". I was so embarrassed during  part of the movies because it was almost like the actors just gave up trying to pull off certain scenes...
This movie is for the faint of heart who really don't want to be ""thrilled"" , but rather slightly( I use this term lightly) amused...maybe.",1452556800,,1367,4.648760330578512

My little cuz is a huge fan of shark movies, I am a huge fan of Asylum movies, this was perfect for us. Now I knew nothing going into this about the flick other than it was about sharks eating people. That was enough for her so my brother came over [he loves horrible movies as well] and we put it in. turns out it was exactly what we thought it would be, your average Asylum movie.

A group of people are abducted from their normal lives only to end up bound and standing in front of a billionaire with a pool behind them. Turns out this man wants them to play a game, and each game involves killer sharks ready to tear into these people. What was the reason behind all of this, well they will have to play to find out, and to make it off of the island.

This was your typical Asylum flick which is to say it has bad all over it but that is also the charm of it. The sharks and kills are cool but silly which made my cuz love it even more. The acting is horrible for the most part; there are a few good performances. The story is cool although it has been done before just this adds sharks. Writers H. Perry Horton [who has written many Asylum films including a few more shark ones] and Liz Adams [who has done a few Asylum flicks herself] have done much better on their own so it is surprising that this wasn't as good as other efforts.

The film was directed by Christopher Ray who has directed some other Asylum films including two other shark ones. I think he kept things moving nicely but he has made better films. You get behind the scenes and a bunch of Asylum trailers as is the norm. if you like bad movies like I do or shark flicks like my little cuz then this may be for you.",1399420800,,1699,4.062686567164179
