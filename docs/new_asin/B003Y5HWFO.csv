4225567,5,B003Y5HWFO,"I have to admit that I got hooked on this series during Season 1.  Nothing more entertaining that watching a group of guys (mostly professionals), and their adolescent behavior over fantasy football.  Taco is a high-point of the series.  Talk about blind luck.  Sometimes I'll just sit down and watch the entire series start to finish.  Always makes me smile no matter what has happened to me that day.",1319760000,,402,4.768115942028985
4225568,4,B003Y5HWFO,"Patrick Bromley, DVD Verdict --Like the majority of sitcoms in their sophomore years, The League has only gotten better in Season Two. The characters are even better developed, and the ensemble is even tighter. There's really not a weak link in the bunch, though it could be argued that Jon LaJoie's Taco exists on a different show; The League takes place in recognizable reality, but Taco doesn't live there. I recognize that's the joke of the character, but it doesn't quite work. LaJoie is not to blame. Season Two also sees the addition of Jason Mantzoukas's (Baby Mama) Rafi, a horrible human being who gets laughs every time he's on screen. Still, many of the same problems present in season one haven't yet been worked out. While writer/director/mumblecore founder Mark Duplass remains one of my favorite actors on the show, his Pete still isn't much of a character--he's just the resident smartass. At times, the episodes strain too hard to pull all of the various story threads together the way that Seinfeld used to do so well, and there's a tendency to do too many variations on the same joke as though the editors couldn't decided which one to use and instead just kept them all. But these are minor complaints, because the show is consistently funny and fun to watch.

The League continues to look good in HD, with a 1.78:1/1080p transfer that's bright and bold and solid. Detail is strong throughout, skin tones look natural and the overall quality represents an improvement over season one. The DTS-HD audio track isn't called upon to do much, but handles what is required of it very well: dialogue is clear and the (brief) theme music packs a punch. Being that the whole show has kind of a low-fi charm, the Blu-ray looks and sounds good enough that it's actually overkill in some ways. Still, it's nice to view the show the best way possible, and this disc allows for precisely that.

In addition to the option to view ""extended"" versions of several episodes, The League: The Complete Season Two comes with a modest but not terrible offering of bonus material. There are roughly ten minutes of deleted scenes included, which offer exactly the same kind of laughs as are present in the show and were likely just cut for time. Perhaps more enjoyable is a compilation of alternate jokes improvised by the cast (a good deal of the show is improvised), many of which are funnier than what made it in but couldn't be used because they're way too dirty. A gag reel is also amusing, once again demonstrating that watching funny people make mistakes is generally more entertaining than not-funny people, if only because they know how to build on the error. An option called ""Taco Tones"" allows for the viewer to jump right to Jon LaJoie's songs, which basically play out like music videos. They're funny enough, but always feel way too produced and out of place, especially given the way that LaJoie's character has been written; they're shoehorned in because, you know, LaJoie is known for writing funny songs. A five-minute faux commercial for Taco's notary business goes way past overstaying its welcome. Lastly, there's a bit with Paul Scheer doing a Bob Ross impression and showing how to paint a ""Kluneberg."" It has very little to do with the show, but it's a funny diversion and a chance for Scheer to be silly.

4225569,5,B003Y5HWFO,"So I was very reluctant to watch a show based on fantasy football.  Netflix kept coming up with it as a recommended show for me every time it refreshed.  Finally one night I had nothing to do so decided to give it a shot.  All I got to say about the show is WOW.  The writers are brilliant, great character development and interactions.  Seriously one of the funniest shows I've ever seen.  It can get a little crude and raunchy at times but that's what I like.  The first season although only a mere six episodes was very well done, and left me wanting more.  Seeing as netflix had not put the 2nd season on the streaming option and their lack of bluray rentals had me opt to purchase the 2nd season.

Starting from the first episode it was brilliant and everything I was expecting after the first season.  Very intelligent yet immature at the same time.  It is rare to find a show where one character doesn't stand out from the rest as a ""favorite"".  From Taco's ignorant way of thinking to Dre's horrible taste and awkwardness.  The show just keeps the laughs coming and coming.  Highly recommend to anyone with a crude adult sense of humor.",1318464000,,1144,4.4375
4225570,5,B003Y5HWFO,"This is the type of series that will make you laugh! Whether it is the true belly laugh that you just love to experience or the chuckles from inane antics of the characters in the show, every episode will have you coming back for more in the end. What I like about the show itself is that each episode can stand alone, you are not to have been required to have watched all of season one to understand what is happening in season two or even to watch season three at this point, you can simply pick up this DVD and watch all and just enjoy! For me, it is the characters that make this show memorable and this season's episodes were just amazing! You will think so two when you get the chance to watch this too!",1318291200,,709,4.144927536231884
4225571,5,B003Y5HWFO,"The League returns for a second season of fantasy football hilarity.  For those who do not know, The League focuses on 5 guys from Chicago who play fantasy football together.  While fantasy football pervades nearly every aspect of their lives and the show, you do not need to know anything about fantasy football to enjoy the show.  There are plenty of people, men and women, who love the show and don't play.  Everyone can relate to the characters in one way or another, whether it is Ruxin getting caught in a lie to his wife and turning to his friends to cover for him, or Andre trying to fit in with a group that mercilessly teases him, everyone can find something to like in these characters.
One of the great things about the show is that it is only loosely scripted, which means that most of it is improved and you never know what you will get.  While you can follow the show if you haven't seen season 1, I'd highly recommend watching it first as a few things that happen this season will make more sense if you do.  However, it isn't necessary to do so.

While the extras aren't amazing, the show more than makes up for it.  If you enjoyed the show the first time around, buy it on DVD so you can watch it over and over again.  The extended episodes (about half of the season) and the few great extras make it a must have!

Disc 1
EPISODES
1. Vegas Draft - As new league champion, Andre plans a trip to Las Vegas for the draft at the MGM Grand.  One of the ""out of town idiots on auto draft"" quits the league and the guys must decide whether to fill the spot with Jenny or Ruxin's brother-in-law, Raffi, whom they all hate. Guest stars Chad Ochocinco
2. Bro-Lo En Cunado - Kevin tries to make up with Jenny by having an adult weekend with his boss when Taco appears at the function with one of Kevin's overzealous coworkers.  Ruxin attempts to give Sofia her monthly ""terrific lady day"" and Pete and Andre go to a party with Raffi.
3. The White Knuckler - Andre expands his medical practice by forming a partnership with an African-American plastic surgeon and throws a party to celebrate the merger; Ruxin volunteers to fulfill a sick child's wish, but hijacks the wish for himself; Pete dates someone who has slept with Kevin and feels awkward about their intimate past.  No extended version. Guest stars Josh Cribbs and Terrell Suggs.
4. The Kluneberg - Andre buys an expensive painting and is mocked by the guys for it; the guys try to get Raffi out of the league; Jenny meets up with an old friend that Kevin suspects is a sex addict.
5. The Marathon - Andre signs up to run a marathon, which prompts Pete to say he is going to run it too; Taco becomes a notary; Jenny and Kevin seek to balance family life when they go head-to-head in this week's matchup.  No extended version
6. The Anniversary Party - Because of Taco's meddling, Ruxin throws Sofia an anniversary party on the same day as Jenny's birthday that all of the guys attend, including someone from Pete's past who shows up with a ""plus one.""  No extended version
7. Ghost Monkey - Kevin tries to create an adult Halloween for the guys and Jenny, but his idea doesn't go as planned; Taco steals a monkey and fears that he killed it and is being haunted by its vengeful spirit; Pete dates a witch; Ruxin and Pete go head-to-head and Pete lets Ruxin set his line-up - a decision that Ruxin agonizes over.  No extended version

EXTRAS
Deleted Scenes - Deleted scenes from the Vegas Draft through the Ghost Monkey episode.  The deleted scenes are hit and miss.  Some of the are absolutely hilarious while others barely garner a smirk.
El Notario! - This is Taco's advertisement for his notary services South of the Border.  This skit was absolutely hilarious!  Make sure you watch the Marathon episode before watching this one.
Kluneberg Paint by Numbers - Andre as Bob Ross in the ""Joy of Painting Stuff""  This skit makes fun of those old PBS painting shows.  Worth watching once, but not particularly funny.
Taco Tones Productions Presents - This is a collection of all the music videos and Taco productions from the season - I'm Inside Me, Naginta!, Sofia & Rodney's Wedding Video, and Vinegar Strokes.  I would've loved to see extended versions of what actually made the show and a full version of the Pete's Tiny Little Erect Dick song.

Disc 2
EPISODES
8. The Tie - Andre and Ruxin complain about a tie prompting Kevin to quit as league commissioner and leaving the guys to come up with alternative ways to break the tie.

EXTRAS
Delete Scenes - Deleted scenes from the Tie through the Sacko Bowl finale.  Like the ones on disc 1, the deleted scenes on disc 2 are hit and miss too.
Alt Nation - Since the show is improved there are a lot of takes of the same scene to try out different improvised jokes.  Here is where you will find them.  Like the deleted scenes, some are hilarious while others fall flat.
Gag Reel - All the mistakes that the guys made.  Pretty funny.",1317686400,10,6178,4.436781609195402

4226906,5,B003Y5HWFO,"I was turned on to this show by my college freshman son.  As a fantasy league player, I was interested thinking it would be funny because of all the inside jokes and observations about having a fantasy team.  While it does serve as the basis of the show and certainly is referenced on occasion, fantasy football is not the primary driver.  The humor is universal.  It is more about following the character development and the relationships and interactions between the primary characters.  In short, this is one of the funniest shows I have ever watched.  The humor is not for everyone, but for those who are not easily offended by bathroom and sexual innuendo topics, this show is mostly unbeatable.",1417478400,,700,4.791666666666667

4227314,1,B003Y5HWFO,"Why is this show rated so high? I like Nick Kroll so thats why I started watching.  The first episodes are amusing, but the show fails to gain momentum.  I'm surprised this show has almost 5 stars! Am I missing something or is this really what people think is funny?  Mediocre at best.",1397952000,,285,4.339622641509434

4227318,4,B003Y5HWFO,"This is a really funny show. Almost every episode has something hilarious happen, and the great majority of them will have you laughing uproariously. I don't have a fantasy league, and I don't really keep up with other teams besides my city's team. However, this show requires little to no knowledge to appreciate the ridiculous humor. The only thing keeping this from a 5 star rating is that the show will occasionally slide into unadulterated potty humor. It's just that the humor usually is so clever or shocking that I didn't think they need to rely on immature humor.",1397001600,,572,4.787878787878788

4227323,4,B003Y5HWFO,While season 2 of The League has lost some of the humor from the first season (due to repetitive jokes) the hilarity remains. A constant state of uproarious situations and actors hitting the mark every time this season should not be missed.,1396396800,,240,4.738095238095238

4227367,4,B003Y5HWFO,"The show definitely peeked with season 2. Season 3 and 4 are utterly lame by comparison - and filled with annoying ""celebrity"" cameos and NFL promotions. Do yourself a big favor - watch the first two seasons and quit while you're ahead.",1388361600,,236,4.642857142857143

4227395,5,B003Y5HWFO,"Some of the hardest laughs I've had in quite awhile.  I was laughing so hard I missed some of the jokes.  I also was forbid from watching this while The Wife sleeps as I kept waking her up with my giggling.  This show hits my sweet spot between FFL and marriage/relationships.  I'm also a big fan of Pete Holmes podcast and just about all comedians running through this show have been on the podcast.  In particular, Jason Mantzoukas was hilarious in Season 2.

My only slight beef is this is kind of pricey for what you get.  Like many people, I love to gang watch shows.  Typically it's the quality dramas (Mad Men, The Wire, Deadwood, Six Feet Under, etc.)...with those it's 42 or 55 or more minutes an episode.  Here we're talking about 21-22 min an episode.  I basically watched this entire season in part of a day.  I guess this is nit picking.  I'll definitely watch this again.  Perhaps it's just different with comedies.",1380844800,,929,4.524096385542169

4227398,5,B003Y5HWFO,"The League never disappoints.  It's always funny, always borderline insane, but never dull.  The characters are all guys that we've known before (except for maybe Taco) and at some point, secretly wished we were.  Between the endless jokes about Kevin and Pete, Dr. Andre No- (you can finish the rest) and Taco's hilarious parodies you always feel like you're in the league.  Season 2 has some of the best episodes and the Blu-Ray transfer is great.  Tons of extras, deleted scenes and full versions of Taco's songs make this a no-brainer for any fan of the show or someone looking to get into a hilarious comedy.",1373500800,,613,4.745283018867925

The writers are a husband and wife, the husband was affiliated with Curb your Enthusiasm. So the writing is spot on, and of high quality.

4227467,5,B003Y5HWFO,"I have been a fan of It's Always Sunny In Philadelphia for a long time, so I saw the ads for this show quiet a bit. I am not into football at all, so I usually ignored the show and went to bed. But I liked Jon Lajoie's comedy, so decided to watch it one night. I bought season 1 and loved it. So I HAD to buy season 2. I watched the entire 2 disk set it one sitting. It is very rare for me to laugh alone. But I was howling the whole way through.

The characters are all horrible, self centered people. Then there's Taco, the 30-something ""self-employed,"" pot-smoking friend who never knows whats going on. On the rare occasions when the show gets dry, they shove Taco it the scene for completely not-related hilarity. In one episode, he showed up at a children's playground with a 6 foot long spear and showed it off to his friends by swinging it around. In another [SPOILER ALERT], Taco took a toilet seat from a dumpster and got addicted to sitting on it, realizing the seat was made of cocaine.

All the characters bring something unique to the show. They each insult each other in their own way, but still hang out all the time. The dialog makes the show. It is all very natural sounding, like they improvise the script. I would give It's Always Sunny 5 out of 5 stars, but The League is even better. It's one of the best, most consistently funny shows I've seen.",1353196800,,1368,4.257692307692308

The characters are interesting, but the plot lines are terrible.  Definitely not what I was expecting, being a fantasy football playing 30 something.

I made my purchase quickly and easily. The package came very quickly in perfect condition. Great service!",1325894400,,432,4.345679012345679
4227503,5,B003Y5HWFO,"Season 2 of The League is funny as hell!  Lots of laughs. You don't have to be a guy or into football to like this show. My sister in-law is a huge fan herself.  She enjoys the comedy factor on its own. Anyone who gets this dvd/bluray will have a blast watching all 13 episodes.  Grab a drink and some chips and get ready for hours of fun! Deff a good grab for under $25.00, but wouldnt pay more than $29.",1325030400,,405,3.9753086419753085
4227504,5,B003Y5HWFO,"The League is still going strong after 3 years. I almost didn't give it a shot after seeing some of the other garbage that FX put on after earlier seasons of IASIP. This is the real deal, though. Great cast, hilarious characters and story lines - gets me LOLing every episode. This has catapulted over IASIP as one of my favorite comedies on TV.",1324339200,,345,4.40625
4227515,5,B003Y5HWFO,"If you're a fantasy football player, you MUST watch this show.  So funny and so many parallels (yet exaggerated) with real life leagues.",1324166400,,136,4.913043478260869
4227516,5,B003Y5HWFO,"This is the funniest show on TV. I ordered the DVD, it came promply and we enjoyed it very much.",1323561600,,96,3.85
4227517,5,B003Y5HWFO,"The show continues its very unique humor.  I don't really know what else to compare it to and the show is definitely not for everyone.  But if you liked season 1, you will almost certainly like season 2.",1323388800,,203,4.315789473684211
4227518,5,B003Y5HWFO,"Almost as good as Season 1 of The League, Season 2 manages to remain very entertaining and humorous. If you are a fan of over the top dirty and crass humor this is one for you.  The acting is very solid overall, and the humor seems very spontaneous and genuine in this apparently ""semi-scripted"" comedy.  If you are not a football fan, they do not spend an inordinate amount of time talking about the intricate details of their fantasy football league.  Overall a very funny, loose-flowing comedy.",1322179200,3,497,4.689655172413793
4227519,1,B003Y5HWFO,"The only reason that I continued watching this garbage was because I paid for it.

This was the worst series that I have ever seen, and please note that I have been forced to watch Desperate Housewives and Go Diego Go with my wife and daughter and to tell you the truth, I would have preferred watching the garbage known as the Twilight series than another stupid second of this TV show.

How the hell is it possible that this SHOW is on TV?

The thing that makes the Second Season of The League more infuriating is that Season One had potential and that is why I decided to purchase Season Two, but the writers decided to have a loose bowl movement than to actually THINK of where they wanted to take the characters and the series.

The show was so awful that I needed to vent and write a review, and I do not write reviews.",1322006400,4,825,4.235668789808917

Thought of buying these at BestBuy but opted to get it at Amazon instead for a great deal.

Thanks...",1320710400,,173,4.548387096774194
4227521,5,B003Y5HWFO,This season of the league is twice as long and has impressed me every step of the way. Watch out for dirty randy!,1320624000,,113,3.9565217391304346
4227522,5,B003Y5HWFO,"The League is seriously one of the funniest shows I've seen on television - it's definitely a must-watch for anyone who plays fantasy football. My husband and I watch this together every week. Season 2 does not disappoint - while the extras aren't anything special, it's great to be able to watch several episodes back to back to get the full effect of Taco, Ruxin (aka Ruspin), Kevin/Jenny, Pete, and Andre.

The season kicks off with hilarity at the Vegas Draft, and has fantastic cameos from players like Ochocinco.

Highly recommended.",1320451200,,539,4.912087912087912
4227523,5,B003Y5HWFO,"This was a great second season of The League, every bit as funny as Season 1!  The Blu-Ray is great quality with lots of great features.  I'd highly recommed for anyone who loves fantasy football and trash-talking with friends!",1320451200,,227,4.794871794871795
4227524,5,B003Y5HWFO,"Funniest show on TV right now, HANDS DOWN.!!! If I could I would give it 6 stars.!! Hilarious character interaction, smart and witty humor. Can be raunchy though, that's what I love about it. These guys rip each other at every opportunity..as good friends should!

Their Fantasy Football Competetive spirit knows no bounaries as they will stoop to any level to, 'one-up' each other(like ""trade-raping"" ea. other)on their way to the Shiva-Bowl(Their Fantasy-League Superbowl)!

Excellent guest stars from the NFL throughout the series, like Chad ""Child-Please"" Ochocinco, Ladanian Tomlinson, and Terry Bradshaw, among others. If ur into NFL Football at all, you've got to get this show on DVD..! Best new show in a lonnng time!",1320192000,,726,5.25

8408830,5,B003Y5HWFO,Funniest show in the history of television. Jumps the shark somewhere middle of the 4th-beginning of 5th season but I'm here to tell you the 1-2-3-4th seasons of this show can hang head-to-head with any other television show ever made.  Season 2 is probably the funniest block of eps this show ever put out- only possibly matched by season 3.,1506643200,,342,4.7
8408831,5,B003Y5HWFO,I absolutely love The League. It is a hilarious show about some horrible people with some football thrown in. I watched the entire series multiple times on Netflix and has now been removed. I decided it was time to buy it.,1504569600,,222,4.439024390243903
