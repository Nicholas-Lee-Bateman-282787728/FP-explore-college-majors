938462,4,6304909764,"Forgotten Silver is a little gem of a mockumentary.  Unlike other films in the genre such as Waiting for Guffman or This is Spinal Tap, a true documentary tone is maintained throughout the film.  It's only as one hears that the subject of the film, Colin McKenzie, developed the first tracking shot, the first color film, the first close-up, the first feature-length epic, the film of the *real* first human flight, etc. that one becomes suspicious .... who *is* this guy?!  Did he really get arrested for stealing 2000 eggs?  After all, it *does* take 12 eggs to emulsify one minute of film ....

He took what was done before with Spinal Tap (an over the top and completely OBVIOUS film from the get go) and went forward by actually daring us to  believe him.  Many did.

938576,5,6304909764,"To fully appreciate this film, you must consider two things.  First, this is a MOCumentary.  It is not a real story, but instead something created through the imagination of a very rich storyteller.  Second, this film was released to the general New Zealand public without them knowing that this was a mocumentary and they completely felt that it was a real occurrence.  They took the bait ... hook, line, and sinker.  It reminded me of the fear that Orson Welles was able to conjure when he did ""The War of the Worlds"" broadcast in 1938.  Welles was able to create a mythological occurrence that was packaged so well that audiences bought it.  This is the same with Peter Jackson's creation, Forgotten Silver.  Jackson's attention to detail and excitement behind this project is seen with every digitized photo, every sound bite, and every word of the story.

The great idea behind mocumentaries is that you have the opportunity to create a world from the ground up.  I think this was an aspect that I thoroughly enjoyed about this picture was every creative angle that Jackson took with his characters.  They were flawed, but in a good way.  They were real, yet in a sense very cartoonish.  They gave you this dream about life that is normally missing in most films, yet these guys were never alive for you to believe in.  It was funny how deeply rooted you could become with this film until you had to pull yourself away and say that it was just a work of fiction.  For anyone to say that about a film means that the filmmaker is doing a spectacular job.  The only director that I can think of that closely able to pull this off today is Christopher Guest, but even in his work you can tell that it is a mocumentary from the beginning.  Jackson never gives you the opportunity to find the truth.  Everything he hands to you has been researched and tested giving us the chance to believe in our man Colin throughout all of it.

Perhaps what I am trying to say here is that Jackson doesn't just create a story, he creates a world filled with emotion and chaos.  It is easy to create a story, books are released everyday, but to put visuals with this story AND build a main character that the average Joe can relate to is much harder.  While only pushing 60 minutes, Jackson had quite a bit of work on his hands.  This was not an easy project.  Jackson not only had to play director, but also put himself into the film that I think only helped build the mirage of truth.  You kept forgetting that he created this story, yet was in it himself.  It honestly takes away that feeling of cinematic rubbish that Hollywood releases daily and builds a true story.

The interventions between Harvey Weinstein, Sam Neill, and Leonard Maltin only help build more of that ""truth"" to the film.  You hear these men from the industry talk about this fictitious man named Colin McKenzie, you begin to believe that perhaps he was alive and Jackson is just trying to tell the truth.

While I have spoken heavily about the amazing fake factoids that Jackson disperses through the film, what I found funny was the type of humor that Jackson placed intermittently throughout the film.  The idea of Stan the Man is brilliant and his ""Rodney King"" moment proved that it is always possible for history to repeat itself.  The jail time that Colin faced due to his ""smut"" film had me rolling in my seat.  The exuberant size of the extras needed for this film kept me smiling throughout.  There was just something about this humor that made me excited about my educational background.

Finally, I would like to say that the fact that the New Zealand public never realized that it was a mocumentary should already prove the worthiness of this film.  I do not see why it didn't receive more press than it did, but this has been the biggest film enjoyment of the week.  I remember a line from a film that went something like this, ""The greatest trick the devil ever pulled was convincing the world he didn't exist"".  Think of this line as you witness Jackson's film Forgotten Silver.  It will make you curious.

Overall, I thought that this film was beautiful.  Midway through this film you will loose track of reality and think that you are watching a true documentary, and that is when you can realize that you have a master director giving you a perfect ""gem"". This was not a film filled with violence and annoying Gollems, but instead cunning wit and satire.  Jackson continually proves that he can handle so much more than just The Lord of the Rings with this film.  No CGI is needed to see the imagination and brilliance behind this visionary.  For those of you that are huge Lord of the Rings fans, you may not enjoy it as much, but for me this was Jackson in his truest form.

Bravo!

938578,5,6304909764,"Watching this mockumentary, it isn't hard to see why the New Zealand public thought it was for real when it was first aired. Peter Jackson, the endearingly hobbitlike director of fantasy epic ""Lord of the Rings,"" tried his hand at something a bit different aside from his splatter-gore horror films, and the eerie ""Heavenly Creatures."" Okay, more than a ""bit"" different.

 It documents the discovery of a film by the cinematic wizard Colin McKenzie, who was born in New Zealand in the 1800s, died in a somewhat deteriorated state, and made amazing breakthroughs in filmmaking in the early 20th century, that were never seen for various reasons... until they were unearthed in a shed. Specifically, the epic ""Salome,"" which had some rather odd financial backers (mobsters and a clown, for example) Now there is a documentary being filmed, with interviews and pieces of footage from the ""forgotten silver"" of Colin McKenzie, the most brilliant filmmaker who never lived!

 Jackson himself is in this in more than a cameo appearance (in all his films, he appears for at least a few seconds), as the filmmaker; Miramax big man Harvey Weinstein, actor Sam Neill, and critic Leonard Maltin also appear as themselves, which makes the film seem even more real. (Especially when Weinstein claims he'll be distributing ""Salome"") If I hadn't known that this WAS a mockumentary, I might've thought it was for real.

 Even though the tongue-in-cheek attitude marks this as a mockumentary, it's very well-done and detailed. The way Jackson fake-aged the footage from the old films, it's totally believable that these have been sitting in a shed for decades. The details show some of the reasons why Jackson did ""Lord of the Rings"" so well: careful attention to costuming, particularly in the ""Salome"" film, detailed camerawork, and a lot of affection for the inspiration for the film. Jackson himself is never more likeable than he is here, and it seems like he's having a good time.

 This is another, not-as-well-known-as-it-deserves example of Peter Jackson's incredibly skilled direction. He is a brilliant director, and this is an uproariously funny and well-made mockumentary. No wonder the audience thought it was real. Funny, cute, detailed and a must-have for fans of Peter Jackson and of all ""forgotten silver.""",1090972800,11,2307,5.117021276595745
938579,5,6304909764,"Forgotten Silver is one of those films you've probably never heard of but once you see it, you'll wonder why. This mockumentary produced in the late 1990s for broadcast on New Zealand television is funny, clever and thought-provoking -- one of the true cinematic pleasures of the past 10 years, blending wit, technology and the products of a relatively little-known culture.
The film is the creation of Peter Jackson, best known today as director of The Lord of the Rings, and actor Costa Botes. Jackson, playing himself in the movie, claims to have discovered a collection of old films in a neighbor's shed, revealing that New Zealander Colin McKenzie (Botes) invented motion picture cameras, color film, sound technology and other landmarks of cinema in complete obscurity before others who are regularly credited for doing so. His ultimate achievement, a biblical epic called Salome, is the lost treasure of film history.
Jackson enlists the aid of other well-known film personas, including critic Leonard Maltin, to explore the life of Colin McKenzie and reveal just how sensational this discovery is. Most of the humor is subtle and tongue-in-cheek, as it is in Peter Jackson's other films. However, the subject matter is treated with the utmost seriousness and therefore hard to discern from fact. Similar to the effects created by Woody Allen in Zelig, Jackson creates extremely authentic-looking black-and-white nitrate footage in which Colin's achievements are well documented. A sequence in which the filmmaker sets out in search of the ruins of the Salome set feels like an episode of ""National Geographic Explorer."" In fact, the overall film is so utterly believable that it caused a minor scandal in its native land upon its original airing. The populace of New Zealand demanded to know why one of its native sons had never received the recognition he so clearly deserved.
The DVD's special features serve to enhance the already-convincing documentary aspects, even though they open up the whole bag of tricks like magicians revealing their secrets. In addition to a commentary audio track by Jackson and Botes, the DVD includes interviews detailing the production of the film and the controversy Jackson and Botes created by doing their jobs so well. What truly enhance the overall viewing experience are the inclusion of footage outtakes and a demonstration of the special-effects test shots. The outtakes invigorate the film's impressive mystique, and the test shots are illuminating inside looks at the tools of the film trade and the progress that has been made.",1081468800,6,2580,5.204326923076923

938581,5,6304909764,"Continuing my quest to screen all of the films of director Peter Jackson, in order to see how a guy who started out making bloody zombie flicks in New Zealand eventually got to be a three-time Academy Award nominee for best director who is the favorite to finally bring Oscar home for ""The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King,"" I have come to ""Forgotten Silver,"" the 1997 mockumentary made by Jackson and Costa Bostas.  The obvious comparison is to the work of Christopher Guest and his cohorts, who brought us ""This is Spinal Tap,"" ""Waiting for Guffman,"" ""Best in Show"" and ""A Mighty Wind.  But given the dry wit that runs throughout ""Forgotten Silver"" the film that springs to my mind is Woody Allen's ""Zelig.""
How dry is the wit?  Well, when ""Forgotten Silver"" aired on New Zealand television it convinced quite a few Kiwi that they had a new national hero in Colin McKenzie, the lost film director who is the topic of this effort.  This happened even though McKenzie is played by Thomas Robins, a New Zealand actor who was the original Host of the New Zealand, Saturday morning Breakfast show, ""Squirt"" (his only other film role has been as Deagol in ""The Return of the King"").

There is fun to be had in showing ""Forgotten Silver"" to unsuspecting friends, family and people dragged in off of the street, to see at what point they catch on that there is something amiss here.  The idea is that Collin McKenzie was a cinematic innovator who came up with the first mechanized camera, the first full-length feature film with sound, and the first color film.  Unfortunately while doing these things he forgot to invent subtitles and accidentally invented the porn film.  Hopefully these people will be amused by what happened and not end up being outraged like the New Zealand viewers who bit hard on the proceedings and complained bitterly to the network and the press afterwards (excerpts are provided on the DVD's feature).  But then I recall having to inform my oldest daughter that ""The Blair Witch Project"" was not ""real,"" so I know you how dicey these things can be.
The hoax works for several reasons.  First, nobody ever winks at the camera, including talking heads Sam Neill, Leonard Maltin, Harvey Weinstein.  Their remarks are skewed only slightly and if you are not in on the gag you might not get it (How many of you got the joke of the Russian woman named Alexandra Nevsky?).  Second, the documentary weaves in real history and historical footage from the start of the 20th century.  Talking about the Battle of Gallipoli is always going to resonate down under.  Third, all of the footage for ""Salome,"" Colin McKenzie's lost silent classic, is done ""straight"" (an idea that has to be taken with a grain of salt when you are talking about acting in silent movies).  Finally, Jackson and Bostas do the entire production from start to finish in true documentary fashion.  If it looks like a documentary and it sounds like a documentary then chances are you have the audience hook, line and forgotten silver.",1076803200,13,3025,4.71157495256167

938583,4,6304909764,"Peter Jackson, he of Lord of the Rings fame, filmed this sharp as a razor, short (50 minutes) mockumentary about Colin MacKenzie, New Zealand's first great film maker, in 1994. The script was co-written by Jackson with Costa Botes, another New Zealander, and the two have a ball chronicling all kinds of fictional events that are so skillfully interwoven with real ones (e.g., New Zealand's participation in WW I) that it really does seem to be the case that MacKenzie did exist and did make his epic film Salome in the New Zealand jungle.
The frequent interviews with and sound bytes by Leonard Maltin, Sam Neill, MacKenzie's ""wife"", film archivists, and others contributes to the feel of authenticity which, of course, only adds more to how much fun this all is. Especially interesting is the featurette ""Behind the Bull"" in which Jackson and a host of others talk about how the film was made--in particular, the lengths to which the filmmakers went to make ""archived"" footage look as old as it does.
This, along with Heavenly Creatures, stands as Jackson's best work and should be seen by those who really love a good pulling of the leg. Recommended.",1036713600,4,1153,4.828282828282828

7879237,5,6304909764,"This hilarious mockumentary is one of Peter Jackson's early works, a TV movie released in 1995 after the release of ""Heavenly Creatures"" earned him some academy award nominations.  The DVD appears to be scarce and very expensive so I was very happy to find a used copy at a price I could afford.  I found the story to be quite engaging and was happily entertained throughout the whole film.

No one has mentioned it in the extra material, but my guess is that ""Forgotten Silver"" was yet another great learning experience for Peter Jackson which helped to prepare him for ""The Lord of the Rings.""  Jackson and Costa Botes had to shoot a wide variety of situations in different styles to get it all on film, and they accomplished this feat with the same thoroughness and attention to detail that we've come to know as hallmarks of Peter Jackson films.  Public reaction to the film, where many folks were upset to learn that it was a hoax, was no doubt a major learning experience in the importance of being open and honest in discussing his work, when a joke will work, and quite significantly when it will not.

(And, sadly, I suspect that the response on the World Wide Web to his Hobbit films, released during the Age of the Troll while the Lord of the Rings films came before that horrible phase of worldwide culture which continues today, was later to be equally significant in negating his experience with being honest about his experience in making films.)

PJ is always fun when he's in front of the camera, too, and he's really the star of the show as the investigator who discovered a treasure horde of film in the long-forgotten work of a (fictitious) New Zealand filmmaker.

There are fun cameos with Sam Neill (of Jurassic Park fame) discussing his recollections of the legendary filmmaker, Colin McKenzie, and Leonard Maltin reviewing McKenzie's (fictional) work.  The part of Colin McKenzie himself is portrayed by Thomas Robins, whom we would see again playing the role of Deagol (who is murdered by his cousin Smagol when he finds the One Ring) in a flashback in The Lord of the Rings.

I gave it to my parents to watch, saying nothing about it and was rewarded with a hook, line and sinker reaction. They even had the case to look at. My mother started to tell me all about how fantastic Colin McKenzie was and what a shame he wasn't better recognised. It was almost a shame to have to burst their bubble.

I was even amused to read that in one of the reviews on this site the person still doesn't realise they've been hoaxed.
