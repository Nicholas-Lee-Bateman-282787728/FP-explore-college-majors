8287520,5,B001CFQNV2,"The anime is very similar to the manga, however episodes are swapped and things like music licenses were not obtained.... So in the first episode when Revy is kickin butt, they did not have the song playing that was noted in the Manga. Whatever.... Still very entertaining; cuss words everywhere, violence, crude activity while maintaining some moral standards. The characters interact well and the first few episodes, like most Anime, is sort of directionless. Character introductions really. If that doesn't get better, I'll comment so on the second volume!",1304985600,,559,5.292134831460674
8287521,5,B001CFQNV2,"Like any other artform, not all Anime is good Anime. But what keeps the genre alive? Series like ""Black Lagoon""! Like ""Cowboy Bebop"", Black Lagoon has all the action, gunplay, fisticuffs and rawness of a good adult feature film. But what sets Black Lagoon (and Cowboy Bebop, for that matter) apart is its sophistication. Both series are politically, culturally and socially concious. Black Lagoon delves into ""exsistential"" issues, such as: Communism, child abuse, corrupt government, political oppression, etc... While not taking sides nor being too preachy. the action gets your attention. But the issues and character depth KEEP your attention. Definately worth owning.",1262822400,,672,5.533980582524272
8287522,5,B001CFQNV2,"Thank goodness FUNimation decided to pick-up this title (although Geneon still holds the license).  This series is one non-stop shootfest!  Revy is as sexy as she is cold-blooded, and WILL perforate you if you look at her the wrong way!  However, the one calming instance is Rock, with his almost-innocent view of life.  I should've read the description of the order though, since I thought I was getting the complete series, not just volume one and the steelbook.  However, I've completed collecting the entire series and am working on the second season (one disc left).",1242432000,,571,4.968421052631579
8287523,5,B001CFQNV2,This is an excellent anime series full of action laughs and tears.  The reason why this limited edition is priced at 34.99 is because this looks like an original Geneon manufactured DVD which Geneon is out of buisness so its hard to come across this item at actually a low price.,1230681600,,279,4.470588235294118
8287524,3,B001CFQNV2,"It is a good series, but honestly - why so pricey? HBO doesn't even charge $9 an episode!",1219622400,3,89,4.0
