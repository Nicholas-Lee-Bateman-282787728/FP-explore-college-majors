3053157,3,B0010X8NNC,"Negima is another harem comedy by the creator of Love Hina and this time dressed up in Harry Potter clothes.  Negi is the star of the show, a ten year old boy who is a genius and magic user (though restricted to not use his magic, something that fizzles alot of the fun out of the first dozen or so episodes).  He's also now a teacher at a school and his class is a 30 odd bunch of teenage girls, all who find him irresistable (stars in their eyes romantic notions all around, I'm afraid).

Watching Negima felt like a huge chore.
This is a cleaned up version, but the animation is still substandard, the music forgettable, and the whole bit of having a 10 year old boy for a teacher, trying to teach a class full of teenage girls (who dream of him as some kind of romantic paragon) is downright creepy.  The many excuses to kiss him are ridiculous and get more grating as the show wears on and girls are chasing after him relentlessly.  It's uncomfortable, not particularly comedic and completely forgettable.  That is, until the studio decided to do *something* about trying to wrap up the plotline.

Negima was still being churned out in manga form and thus did not have a complete story when this series was being made (something that happens quite frequently).  So instead of just leaving it hanging, they decided to put together a final arc that would bring some sort of closure to the series.  This made the fanboys (and fangirls) FURIOUS but I applaud their decision.  The last arc gives weight and substance to a series that was otherwise harem fluff in Harry Potter clothes.  The final arc brings everyone together and fleshes out the relationships a little more solidly.  It's good stuff, that keeps you on the edge of your seat with emotions at stake.  Something the series kept free from, til that point.

What else does Negima do right?  It has a HUGE cast of characters (there are over 30 students in Negi's class alone, not to mention other teachers and other characters as well).  Through clever selection and varied plotlines we are introduced to the majority of these students and really get to know them.  This is a feat that seems overwhelming impossible at the beginning but its done with amazing ease and no force feeding of characters and their quirks.  By the end of the series, you feel as if they are real fleshed out characters, and not just cardboard cutouts.  The personalities are so diverse too and you even get to meet a robot, a vampire and a ghost (among others, ninja twins perhaps?) The colors of many of the girls' hair was changed from a sea of plain browns to a crayon box of crazy dyes.  This does help to identify them and was a nice idea (even if the fans, again, didn't like it...I can imagine the confusion that would have lead if they had stuck to the manga on this).

The English dub is also quite nice, with Greg Ayres even squeaking out a bit of an English accent for Negi himself.  This boxset is rather unappealing to look at (the colours!  agh! my eyes!) but you get all the discs and a little booklet so it's a good choice for the price.

There's even a cheaper version coming too, so you might want to hold out for that one.",1225065600,3,3178,4.458477508650519
3053158,3,B0010X8NNC,"Negi Springfield is often touted as Japan's answer to Harry Potter, although in personality he's a bit more like Hermione.

And while the wizard prodigy isn't quite shown to his full potential in the anime adaptation ""Negima,"" where stretches of fluffy harem comedy are speckled with serious magic and action. While it starts slowly and relies too heavily on semi-nudity and slapsticky antics, the more wizardly adventures end up keeping it worth watching.

Middle-school student Asuna is desperately hoping that her crush, Professor Takahata, will be teaching homeroom at Mahora Academy this year... and her mood is further soured by a preteen boy who tells her, ""Not everyone can be lucky in love.""

Turns out the boy, a Welsh prodigy named Negi Springfield, IS the new teacher. Most of the girls immediately love him, but Asuna is enraged by Negi's ""weirdness"" -- when she glimpses him magically saving a student, his secret comes out: Negi is a wizard, and if Asuna reveals his secret he'll be turned into an ermine. Fortunately, Asuna agrees to keep his secret... if he makes a love potion for her, with predictably chaotic results.

And soon Negi is faced by a creature from his family past -- a vampiric student who is determined to drain his blood. And he has to deal with myriad other troubles -- web idols, vicious volleyball teams, kiss contests, spying cheerleaders, a timid ghost, and a scheming ermine. And when Negi's job hangs on his class's bottom-of-the-barrel test scores, Asuna organizes a trip to the mysterious Library Island to get a magical book that can make even the Dummy Force smart!

But things take a dark turn near the end of the series -- a trip to Kyoto goes awry when Konoka is threatened, and the mysterious sword-wielding Setsuna reveals her true identity. And upon returning, Asuna becomes increasingly ill -- leading Negi to discover a horrifying secret in her past, which links the doomed girl to his vanished father.

Ken Akamatsu's original manga is pretty much balanced out -- part of it is slam-bang magic'n'action, while the other part is kooky romantic comedy and crazy slapstick. And for the anime, ""Negima"" serves up an incredibly heavy dose of the kooky comedy/crazy slapstick, with an emphasis on busts, robots, superpowered kicks, ninjas and the occasional skyscraper-sized demon.

In fact many episodes are nothing but poor Negi getting swamped by his high-spirited students and the devious ermine Chamo's manipulations (which involve awkward kissing). Lots of skimpy clothes, confessions of love, bear panties and kooky dialogue (""Side effects may include dry mouth, nausea and loss of about a million brain cells...""). It's like an amped-up romantic sitcom with some magical trappings.

While the comedic stories are fun in a disposable way, what makes the series truly watchable is the magic-oriented episodes -- aerial battles with tiny blonde vampires and playing chase with a giant stone golem amongst them. The end of the series is when the magical adventures really take front-and-center: though the whole trip to Kyoto rushes by way too fast, the final bittersweet arc is nothing short of brilliant.

It's icky to see teenage girls pursuing a ten-year-old, but Negi is a likable little hero -- he's earnest, unselfish, and completely devoted to his students even if they're insane. Asuna is his opposite -- brash, temperamental, unexpectedly warmhearted -- and serves as a mildly violent big-sister type, although their roles unexpectedly switch near the finale.

Surprisingly the rest of the cast plenty of fleshing-out as well -- sweet Konoka, mysterious Setsuna, the antisocial web idol Chisame (""This is CHIU's world and all you bimbos are mere tenants!""), serene ninja Kaede, and the loopy princess Ayaka (who has a surprisingly tragic past). Most memorable is the prepubescent vampire-mage Evangeline (""It's enough to make ANYONE CRAZY!""), and her cat-loving robot Chachamaru.

The complete ""Negima"" season is a bit too heavy on the fluffy comedy, and too light on the magical adventures. But it's still worth watching for those who need a bit more Magorum magic.",1224892800,,4129,5.120356612184249

This is the exact same box set as the 1st release. Only this one comes in a smaller box and probably maybe paper packaged like the other viridian releases with no individual plastic cases. I actually purchased mine on AMZ cheaper then this 2nd box set price. I don't see the purpose of these multiple box set releases unless there's a huge price difference. Knowing anime fans people will just run out to purchase this thinking its season 2 or something. Overall this is a cute series, nothing groundbreaking. Its like Harry Potter going to school of wizardy but with girls.",1224115200,,717,4.565891472868217

Now this is kinda upsetting coming from Xebec who also did the animation for Love Hina. Akamatsu was even disgusted with the anime and how it turned out.

So check it out and watch out for the biggest ending twist ever! it will have you crying and jumping out of your seat!",1204329600,3,419,4.25
3053164,5,B0010X8NNC,"I'm a huge fan of the Negima Manga series and have read all 16 current manga books released in the U.S. to date. The anime does not disappoint. Let me break it down for you like this.

1.) The story is based on a Welsh 10 year old boy who happens to be a wizard and a teacher of English at Mahora Academy, girls junior high section, in Japan. There are a whole lot of them, ranging from a traditional Japanese swordswoman, a vampire wizard,a robot, an otaku, the emo pensive one, the brilliant scientists, the artist, the musicians... the list goes on. They each have their own personalities and are very faithful to their portrayals in the manga, at least in terms of their actions and personalities.

2.) While it has a lot of the lovey dovey goofy awkward situations and some rather tame sexual overtones (nothing worse than you'd see on Prime Time TV), it has a deep magical undertone with plenty of action. Martial arts, wizardry, technology and everything combines here. You'll get it all no matter what type of anime you are into.

3.) The story changes throughout the 6 discs (which I believe only cover the first 6 or so books). It starts with getting to know the girls and Negi. Then you move into who are the bad guys (or girls in some cases) and the plot thickens. This 26 episode set doesn't get all the way into the details (specifically about Negi and Asuna's past ... but I will not spoil anything). Let's just say the 26 episodes lay the foundation nicely.

4.) The voice acting... how to say it...
For having to rely on my own mind to fill in the voices previously I was kind of puzzled at first. Negi sounds way smaller than 10 years old, but that was because he is new and didn't know anyone in the first episodes. He fills in nicely and it fits well with his character. Asuna's voice is perfect. Feminine like a Jr. high student, except when she's mad ""A violent ape woman"" as she is described in both Manga and Anime is well performed by the voice actress (Luci Christian, she's in many other works). Her friend and rival, Ayaka, is the perfect snob/rich girl and their dynamics in the manga are spot on to the anime. So basically besides getting used to it in the first episode (or not at all if you never had a prior impression from the manga), you will be happy with the voice work. The music and sound effects are great too.

5.) The plot from the manga is followed quite well as I have said, but a few liberties are taken. Specifically more background is filled in, and you meet some of the girls earlier than you would have in the manga (heck, you barely see anyone talk to this one character even up to book 16). These fill in little details you never got in the manga. I didn't know that Shizuru-sensei was the school nurse, I didn't know Asuna's eyes were blue and green, or the Mahora Girls School uniforms are purple/magenta. Little things like that are nice, and it really fleshes out the interactions that are static in the manga.

6.) Finally, if you are familiar with the work of Ken Akamatsu (Love Hina for instance), you won't be disappointed. The artwork is a traditional style. Not too esoteric, not too bland. Just right. A very beginner friendly art style with lots of cheerful colors and quality animation.
From the art style to the music to the sound effects, this set is an amazing buy for any anime fan.",1202428800,2,3350,4.421393841166937
3053165,5,B0010X8NNC,"The premise of the story is this: A 10-year-old boy, who happens to be a prodigy and a wizard, goes to teach at a girls-only junior high school. As you might imagine, having a teacher that is younger than the students makes for some strange situations. The fact that the students are all girls makes it even more strange. This story line holds out through the first 18 episodes and is funny without being tiring and makes you know the girls and Negi - the teacher.

Episode 19 starts a different story line. This story is touching... very much a U-turn from the previous episodes.

However, another story line, which appears starting in episode 20, is much more serious, and is likely to turn you into a crying, blubbering mess. I literally couldn't stop watching from episode 20 through 26.

HUH!? An anime that is both funny and serious? It will truly make you laugh out loud and cry. Really. It's a great story, if a bit unbelievable near the end, but excellent entertainment.

I highly recommend it if you enjoy anime with frequent misunderstandings, funny and awkward situations, touching moments, and learning to ""connect"" with the characters in a show. Oh, and just enough magic thrown in to make things really interesting.",1201737600,14,1230,4.76056338028169

The girls of the high school go crazy for Negi( the young boy) and only one knows that he is a wizard and she has to decide to keep it a secret or tell the world and make Negi lose his magical powers and be turned into a ferret. This shows main storyline has to do with Negi trying to find his father that everyone tells him is dead but he somehow knows that his father is alive.

A humorous note:  The English subtitles appear to be a direct translation of the Japanese dialog, and at times have no bearing on the English language dialog.

This is perhaps my favorite Anime series.  If you've seen ""Love Hina"" you will definitely see parallels between the two stories, which is not surprising as both were authored by Ken Akamatsu.

You can buy this set from resellers for $10 new. [ EDIT: This is no longer true. I can not fathom why anyone would pay $200 for this set, especially when you can watch it online for free ]",1276992000,2,659,4.413223140495868

The first release of this boxed set you can still find dollars cheaper on ebay along with the special features on the discs, unlike this horrible second release of the series.

People think it's cheaper, but you aren't really the kind of people who care to save money and look around for good deals.

3053176,5,B0010X8NNC,"It is easy to call ""Negima!"" the anime equivalent of Harry Potter, but it just isn't so. You have two young boys who can do magic, and there the similarities end. Harry Potter was never chased around romantically by thirty-one junior high school girls each trying to steal a kiss. With&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Love-Hina/dp/B001M6SHD8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Love Hina</a>&nbsp;creator Ken Akamatsu at the helm you know you are in for a good time.

You have to accept this basic premise of ""Negima!"" before you can enjoy the series. Negi Springfield is a ten-year-old wizard-in-training from Wales, with dreams of becoming the Magister Magi (Master Mage). In the meantime, he has been hired as an English teacher for the Mahora Girls Academy in Japan, as well as being the homeroom teacher for class 2-A. The Mahora Girls Academy is not all it seems at first, as its students include vampires, ghosts and robots, although all the normal students never seem to notice this. Of course, all the girls develop crushes on the cute 10-year old, and hijinks ensue.

The ""Negima!"" animated series follows the first volumes of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/the-comic/dp/034547046X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">the comic</a>&nbsp;for the most part, and then suddenly veers away. The reason for this is that the anime eventually out-paced the comic, and so a new storyline was invented. This storyline, showing up around episode 19 or so, is quite different from the comic and might come as a shock to some. However, it is very well-handled, and I appreciate having two versions of the story.

This ""Negima!: The Complete Series Box Set (Viridian Collection)"" is the third 26-episode complete boxset release from Funimation. The set was previously released as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Negima-Box-Set/dp/B0010X8NNC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Negima! Box Set</a>&nbsp;and as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Negima-Complete-Collection-Viridian-Collection/dp/B001GT9DQQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Negima!: Complete Collection (Viridian Collection)</a>. This third boxset is essentially a re-release of the original ""Viridian Collection,"" and is a stripped down and less expensive version of the series, presented in slim cases and without extra features. I personally really appreciate the thin cases, as it takes up less space in my ever-increasing DVD collection.  The only real difference between this Viridian release and the previous one is the cover art, and an additional five minutes of running time, 630 minutes instead of 625 minutes.  And it is cheaper!

All three box sets have revised and re-drawn animation, as the animation from the original TV release in Japan was notoriously terrible. The animated series is also much more ""family-friendly"" than the comic. Most of the fan-service is implied rather than directly shown, so if you only read ""Negima!"" for the panties you might be a little disappointed. The English-language script takes the ""family friendly"" approach even further, and is slightly different from the Japanese. Many of the ""double entendres"" and sexual humor has been removed.

And while I am not usually a fan of dubbing, a special shout out needs to be done here for Funimation's English-language cast. They have done a great job, even going so far as to give Negi a Welsh accent. This is one case where they might be better than the Japanese original cast. Listening to the ""Native Speaking"" Negi doing English dictation during his English classes is pretty funny.",1249344000,7,3674,5.960151802656546

I love the way she acts, the way she handles everything. to me the most important character in the whole story was her more than any other character. saying these it means that i rate these show a 5 star show out of all the shows i own. as soon as i saw it i had to buy it.

3053178,3,B0010X8NNC,"Negi Springfield is often touted as Japan's answer to Harry Potter, although in personality he's a bit more like Hermione.

And while the wizard prodigy isn't quite shown to his full potential in the anime adaptation ""Negima,"" where stretches of fluffy harem comedy are speckled with serious magic and action. While it starts slowly and relies too heavily on semi-nudity and slapsticky antics, the more wizardly adventures end up keeping it worth watching.

Middle-school student Asuna is desperately hoping that her crush, Professor Takahata, will be teaching homeroom at Mahora Academy this year... and her mood is further soured by a preteen boy who tells her, ""Not everyone can be lucky in love.""

Turns out the boy, a Welsh prodigy named Negi Springfield, IS the new teacher. Most of the girls immediately love him, but Asuna is enraged by Negi's ""weirdness"" -- when she glimpses him magically saving a student, his secret comes out: Negi is a wizard, and if Asuna reveals his secret he'll be turned into an ermine. Fortunately, Asuna agrees to keep his secret... if he makes a love potion for her, with predictably chaotic results.

And soon Negi is faced by a creature from his family past -- a vampiric student who is determined to drain his blood. And he has to deal with myriad other troubles -- web idols, vicious volleyball teams, kiss contests, spying cheerleaders, a timid ghost, and a scheming ermine. And when Negi's job hangs on his class's bottom-of-the-barrel test scores, Asuna organizes a trip to the mysterious Library Island to get a magical book that can make even the Dummy Force smart!

But things take a dark turn near the end of the series -- a trip to Kyoto goes awry when Konoka is threatened, and the mysterious sword-wielding Setsuna reveals her true identity. And upon returning, Asuna becomes increasingly ill -- leading Negi to discover a horrifying secret in her past, which links the doomed girl to his vanished father.

Ken Akamatsu's original manga is pretty much balanced out -- part of it is slam-bang magic'n'action, while the other part is kooky romantic comedy and crazy slapstick. And for the anime, ""Negima"" serves up an incredibly heavy dose of the kooky comedy/crazy slapstick, with an emphasis on busts, robots, superpowered kicks, ninjas and the occasional skyscraper-sized demon.

In fact many episodes are nothing but poor Negi getting swamped by his high-spirited students and the devious ermine Chamo's manipulations (which involve awkward kissing). Lots of skimpy clothes, confessions of love, bear panties and kooky dialogue (""Side effects may include dry mouth, nausea and loss of about a million brain cells...""). It's like an amped-up romantic sitcom with some magical trappings.

While the comedic stories are fun in a disposable way, what makes the series truly watchable is the magic-oriented episodes -- aerial battles with tiny blonde vampires and playing chase with a giant stone golem amongst them. The end of the series is when the magical adventures really take front-and-center: though the whole trip to Kyoto rushes by way too fast, the final bittersweet arc is nothing short of brilliant.

It's icky to see teenage girls pursuing a ten-year-old, but Negi is a likable little hero -- he's earnest, unselfish, and completely devoted to his students even if they're insane. Asuna is his opposite -- brash, temperamental, unexpectedly warmhearted -- and serves as a mildly violent big-sister type, although their roles unexpectedly switch near the finale.

Surprisingly the rest of the cast plenty of fleshing-out as well -- sweet Konoka, mysterious Setsuna, the antisocial web idol Chisame (""This is CHIU's world and all you bimbos are mere tenants!""), serene ninja Kaede, and the loopy princess Ayaka (who has a surprisingly tragic past). Most memorable is the prepubescent vampire-mage Evangeline (""It's enough to make ANYONE CRAZY!""), and her cat-loving robot Chachamaru.

The complete ""Negima"" season is a bit too heavy on the fluffy comedy, and too light on the magical adventures. But it's still worth watching for those who need a bit more Magorum magic.",1247184000,3,4129,5.120356612184249
3053179,3,B0010X8NNC,"Negima! The Complete Collection is a four-disc DVD set that includes all twenty-six episodes of the original Negima! series.  The set is packaged in two thinpack DVD boxes, and each thinpack box includes two DVDs.  The first two discs include seven episodes, while the third disc contains six episodes, and the final disc includes six episodes and the special features.  For special features, there is a textless version of the opening, textless versions of both endings, as well as trailers.

When you start watching the set, Negima! comes off as a rather light-hearted show.  But as you progress through the series, the tone starts changing.  The tonal change becomes a bit more noticeable on disc three, and the tonal shift is completed on disc four.  By the end of disc four, expect to see some pathos, and you might need a handkerchief while watching a couple of the episodes.

In some respects, I'm disappointed at the relative lack of effort FUNimation put into this set.  While it was nice they could fit an impressive number of episodes on each disc, this seem to come at the cost of a lack of special features.  I'm also a little disappointed with the fact that the ""Episodes"" menu is not a ""scene selection"" menu.  Even with its flaws, this set is still a worthwhile addition to your anime DVD library if you're a fan of the original Negima! series.",1243900800,,1360,4.720338983050848
3053180,5,B0010X8NNC,"It is easy to call ""Negima!"" the anime equivalent of Harry Potter, but it just isn't so.  You have two young boys who can do magic, and there the similarities end.  Harry Potter was never chased around romantically by thirty-one junior high school girls each trying to steal a kiss.  With&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Love-Hina/dp/B001M6SHD8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Love Hina</a>&nbsp;creator Ken Akamatsu at the helm you know you are in for a good time.

You have to accept this basic premise of ""Negima!"" before you can enjoy the series.  Negi Springfield is a ten-year-old wizard-in-training from Wales, with dreams of becoming the Magister Magi (Master Mage).  In the meantime, he has been hired as an English teacher for the Mahora Girls Academy in Japan, as well as being the homeroom teacher for class 2-A.  The Mahora Girls Academy is not all it seems at first, as its students include vampires, ghosts and robots, although all the normal students never seem to notice this.  Of course, all the girls develop crushes on the cute 10-year old, and hijinks ensue.

The ""Negima!"" animated series follows the first volumes of the comic for the most part, and then suddenly veers away.  The reason for this is that the anime eventually out-paced the comic, and so a new storyline was invented.  This storyline, showing up around episode 19 or so, is quite different from the comic and might come as a shock to some.  However, it is very well-handled, and I appreciate having two versions of the story.

This ""Negima!:Complete Collection (Viridian Collection)"" is the second 26-episode complete boxset release from Funimation.  The set was previously released as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Negima-Box-Set/dp/B0010X8NNC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Negima! Box Set</a>&nbsp;The ""Viridian Collection"" is a stripped down and less expensive version of the series, presented in slim cases and without extra features.  I personally really appreciate the thin cases, as it takes up less space in my ever-increasing DVD collection.

Both box sets have revised and re-drawn animation, as the animation from the original TV release in Japan was notoriously terrible.  The animated series is also much more ""family-friendly"" than the comic.  Most of the fan-service is implied rather than directly shown, so if you only read ""Negima!"" for the panties you might be a little disappointed.  The English-language script takes the ""family friendly"" approach even further, and is slightly different from the Japanese. Many of the ""double entendres"" and sexual humor has been removed.

And while I am not usually a fan of dubbing, a special shout out needs to be done here for Funimation's English-language cast.  They have done a great job, even going so far as to give Negi a Welsh accent.  This is one case where they might be better than the Japanese original cast.  Listening to the ""Native Speaking"" Negi doing English dictation during his English classes is pretty funny.",1240358400,25,3056,5.482905982905983
3053181,5,B0010X8NNC,"This series is about a boy who is VERY intelligent, but still prepubescent. Meaning, he doesn't think of girls like most anime protagonists do. He is also a wizard and a sharp one at that. His final lesson to becoming a top wizard, like his father before was. Is to become a teacher at an all-girls dormatory in Japan.

The series is the same makers of Love Hina. In both studio and author. Which means a couple of things: The plot is funny and deep, the girls are gonna be sexy and strong in personality, and that the main character is react in very funny way.

Those who have seen Love Hina know what I'm talking about! Negi is a little from Keitaro, but he still is a good guy. But Negi is almost instantly liked by all the girls. All except the main heroine.

26-episodes long, this story only covers the initial plot lines, which makes it a stereotypical harem anime, with some nice differences, but it doesn't cover the best parts of the manga.

One of the best things about it is the character development. I love all the little quirks that make the characters unique.

3287654,3,B0010X8NNC,"Negima is another harem comedy by the creator of Love Hina and this time dressed up in Harry Potter clothes.  Negi is the star of the show, a ten year old boy who is a genius and magic user (though restricted to not use his magic, something that fizzles alot of the fun out of the first dozen or so episodes).  He's also now a teacher at a school and his class is a 30 odd bunch of teenage girls, all who find him irresistable (stars in their eyes romantic notions all around, I'm afraid).

Watching Negima felt like a huge chore.
This is a cleaned up version, but the animation is still substandard, the music forgettable, and the whole bit of having a 10 year old boy for a teacher, trying to teach a class full of teenage girls (who dream of him as some kind of romantic paragon) is downright creepy.  The many excuses to kiss him are ridiculous and get more grating as the show wears on and girls are chasing after him relentlessly.  It's uncomfortable, not particularly comedic and completely forgettable.  That is, until the studio decided to do *something* about trying to wrap up the plotline.

Negima was still being churned out in manga form and thus did not have a complete story when this series was being made (something that happens quite frequently).  So instead of just leaving it hanging, they decided to put together a final arc that would bring some sort of closure to the series.  This made the fanboys (and fangirls) FURIOUS but I applaud their decision.  The last arc gives weight and substance to a series that was otherwise harem fluff in Harry Potter clothes.  The final arc brings everyone together and fleshes out the relationships a little more solidly.  It's good stuff, that keeps you on the edge of your seat with emotions at stake.  Something the series kept free from, til that point.

What else does Negima do right?  It has a HUGE cast of characters (there are over 30 students in Negi's class alone, not to mention other teachers and other characters as well).  Through clever selection and varied plotlines we are introduced to the majority of these students and really get to know them.  This is a feat that seems overwhelming impossible at the beginning but its done with amazing ease and no force feeding of characters and their quirks.  By the end of the series, you feel as if they are real fleshed out characters, and not just cardboard cutouts.  The personalities are so diverse too and you even get to meet a robot, a vampire and a ghost (among others, ninja twins perhaps?) The colors of many of the girls' hair was changed from a sea of plain browns to a crayon box of crazy dyes.  This does help to identify them and was a nice idea (even if the fans, again, didn't like it...I can imagine the confusion that would have lead if they had stuck to the manga on this).

The English dub is also quite nice, with Greg Ayres even squeaking out a bit of an English accent for Negi himself.  This boxset is rather unappealing to look at (the colours!  agh! my eyes!) but you get all the discs and a little booklet so it's a good choice for the price.

There's even a cheaper version coming too, so you might want to hold out for that one.",1225065600,3,3178,4.458477508650519

3287661,5,B0010X8NNC,"I'm a huge fan of the Negima Manga series and have read all 16 current manga books released in the U.S. to date. The anime does not disappoint. Let me break it down for you like this.

1.) The story is based on a Welsh 10 year old boy who happens to be a wizard and a teacher of English at Mahora Academy, girls junior high section, in Japan. There are a whole lot of them, ranging from a traditional Japanese swordswoman, a vampire wizard,a robot, an otaku, the emo pensive one, the brilliant scientists, the artist, the musicians... the list goes on. They each have their own personalities and are very faithful to their portrayals in the manga, at least in terms of their actions and personalities.

2.) While it has a lot of the lovey dovey goofy awkward situations and some rather tame sexual overtones (nothing worse than you'd see on Prime Time TV), it has a deep magical undertone with plenty of action. Martial arts, wizardry, technology and everything combines here. You'll get it all no matter what type of anime you are into.

3.) The story changes throughout the 6 discs (which I believe only cover the first 6 or so books). It starts with getting to know the girls and Negi. Then you move into who are the bad guys (or girls in some cases) and the plot thickens. This 26 episode set doesn't get all the way into the details (specifically about Negi and Asuna's past ... but I will not spoil anything). Let's just say the 26 episodes lay the foundation nicely.

4.) The voice acting... how to say it...
For having to rely on my own mind to fill in the voices previously I was kind of puzzled at first. Negi sounds way smaller than 10 years old, but that was because he is new and didn't know anyone in the first episodes. He fills in nicely and it fits well with his character. Asuna's voice is perfect. Feminine like a Jr. high student, except when she's mad ""A violent ape woman"" as she is described in both Manga and Anime is well performed by the voice actress (Luci Christian, she's in many other works). Her friend and rival, Ayaka, is the perfect snob/rich girl and their dynamics in the manga are spot on to the anime. So basically besides getting used to it in the first episode (or not at all if you never had a prior impression from the manga), you will be happy with the voice work. The music and sound effects are great too.

5.) The plot from the manga is followed quite well as I have said, but a few liberties are taken. Specifically more background is filled in, and you meet some of the girls earlier than you would have in the manga (heck, you barely see anyone talk to this one character even up to book 16). These fill in little details you never got in the manga. I didn't know that Shizuru-sensei was the school nurse, I didn't know Asuna's eyes were blue and green, or the Mahora Girls School uniforms are purple/magenta. Little things like that are nice, and it really fleshes out the interactions that are static in the manga.

6.) Finally, if you are familiar with the work of Ken Akamatsu (Love Hina for instance), you won't be disappointed. The artwork is a traditional style. Not too esoteric, not too bland. Just right. A very beginner friendly art style with lots of cheerful colors and quality animation.
From the art style to the music to the sound effects, this set is an amazing buy for any anime fan.",1202428800,2,3350,4.421393841166937
3287662,5,B0010X8NNC,"The premise of the story is this: A 10-year-old boy, who happens to be a prodigy and a wizard, goes to teach at a girls-only junior high school. As you might imagine, having a teacher that is younger than the students makes for some strange situations. The fact that the students are all girls makes it even more strange. This story line holds out through the first 18 episodes and is funny without being tiring and makes you know the girls and Negi - the teacher.

Episode 19 starts a different story line. This story is touching... very much a U-turn from the previous episodes.

However, another story line, which appears starting in episode 20, is much more serious, and is likely to turn you into a crying, blubbering mess. I literally couldn't stop watching from episode 20 through 26.

HUH!? An anime that is both funny and serious? It will truly make you laugh out loud and cry. Really. It's a great story, if a bit unbelievable near the end, but excellent entertainment.

3287665,5,B0010X8NNC,"I really enjoyed this series it has alot of rather funny lighthearted moments, but at the same time it can be a little sad.  For me thats what makes animes like this memorable.  I would like to stress that to me it's not really intended for very young children because it is very suggestive in nature.
All in all, I would highly recommend this one.",1300406400,,348,4.338461538461538
3287666,5,B0010X8NNC,"I was about to send this back because I missed the fact that it said english only and I prefer to watch in Japanese with subtitles. However, when I opened the box, it said that it had both english and Japanese stereo and english subs. I am impressed. Great series too.",1289779200,,268,4.2745098039215685

3287668,5,B0010X8NNC,"This product is worth the price! The storyline of a young boy only 9 years old becoming a teacher at an all girl high school just has to be enough, but the writers of this fiction went one better and made the young boy a magician! Now this show is gonna be great(not just good). The girls of the high school go crazy for Negi( the young boy) and only one knows that he is a wizard and she has to decide to keep it a secret or tell the world and make Negi lose his magical powers and be turned into a ferret. This shows main storyline has to do with Negi trying to find his father that everyone tells him is dead but he somehow knows that his father is alive. This show will bring all the joys and tears of a great anime and should be written down as one of the best in the world. And yes there are vampires in this and other paranormal creatures, for you mythology buffs. I fully reccomend this anime and if this isn't your cup of tea then allow me to reccomend Full Metal Panic!, or Fushigi Yuugi (Both are in fully voiced English).",1277596800,,1033,4.068627450980392
3287669,4,B0010X8NNC,"I found the original series to be much more satisfying than the so called ""Season 2"", which isn't a season 2 at all.

A humorous note:  The English subtitles appear to be a direct translation of the Japanese dialog, and at times have no bearing on the English language dialog.

This is perhaps my favorite Anime series.  If you've seen ""Love Hina"" you will definitely see parallels between the two stories, which is not surprising as both were authored by Ken Akamatsu.

You can buy this set from resellers for $10 new. [ EDIT: This is no longer true. I can not fathom why anyone would pay $200 for this set, especially when you can watch it online for free ]",1276992000,2,659,4.413223140495868
3287670,5,B0010X8NNC,"I made a mistake when I ordered this collection. I saw an episode on Youtube but it was Negima!? which should be called Negima redone and uncut instead of season 2. So when I put it on I was like ,what the heck is this. I was kind of bummed so I took it out and let it sit , until the other night I started watching it because nothing was on tv. I was on the verge of giving it away , now I'm glad I didn't, this ones a keeper. Negima has won me over. The cast was great and varied with a rich girl , a vampire , a robot , ghost , tough girl , genius inventors and more. The story was great with plenty of chuckles and some seriously weepy parts. The only complaint I might have is that the first few episodes were kind of slow, but after that the show takes off. You should try this collection you won't be disappointed.",1273017600,,821,3.892857142857143
3287671,1,B0010X8NNC,"I find this second boxed set of the series a complete waste of money and cheaply made. I myself hate slim cases and when they combine episodes packed onto one disc. I like when there is more discs to a set and when the box has more features to it.

The first release of this boxed set you can still find dollars cheaper on ebay along with the special features on the discs, unlike this horrible second release of the series.

People think it's cheaper, but you aren't really the kind of people who care to save money and look around for good deals.

I wouldn't even give this set a negative star...but I have to at least give it one since this site makes you do it!!!",1266019200,,667,4.1953125

3287673,5,B0010X8NNC,"It is easy to call ""Negima!"" the anime equivalent of Harry Potter, but it just isn't so. You have two young boys who can do magic, and there the similarities end. Harry Potter was never chased around romantically by thirty-one junior high school girls each trying to steal a kiss. With&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Love-Hina/dp/B001M6SHD8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Love Hina</a>&nbsp;creator Ken Akamatsu at the helm you know you are in for a good time.

You have to accept this basic premise of ""Negima!"" before you can enjoy the series. Negi Springfield is a ten-year-old wizard-in-training from Wales, with dreams of becoming the Magister Magi (Master Mage). In the meantime, he has been hired as an English teacher for the Mahora Girls Academy in Japan, as well as being the homeroom teacher for class 2-A. The Mahora Girls Academy is not all it seems at first, as its students include vampires, ghosts and robots, although all the normal students never seem to notice this. Of course, all the girls develop crushes on the cute 10-year old, and hijinks ensue.

The ""Negima!"" animated series follows the first volumes of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/the-comic/dp/034547046X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">the comic</a>&nbsp;for the most part, and then suddenly veers away. The reason for this is that the anime eventually out-paced the comic, and so a new storyline was invented. This storyline, showing up around episode 19 or so, is quite different from the comic and might come as a shock to some. However, it is very well-handled, and I appreciate having two versions of the story.

This ""Negima!: The Complete Series Box Set (Viridian Collection)"" is the third 26-episode complete boxset release from Funimation. The set was previously released as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Negima-Box-Set/dp/B0010X8NNC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Negima! Box Set</a>&nbsp;and as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Negima-Complete-Collection-Viridian-Collection/dp/B001GT9DQQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Negima!: Complete Collection (Viridian Collection)</a>. This third boxset is essentially a re-release of the original ""Viridian Collection,"" and is a stripped down and less expensive version of the series, presented in slim cases and without extra features. I personally really appreciate the thin cases, as it takes up less space in my ever-increasing DVD collection.  The only real difference between this Viridian release and the previous one is the cover art, and an additional five minutes of running time, 630 minutes instead of 625 minutes.  And it is cheaper!

All three box sets have revised and re-drawn animation, as the animation from the original TV release in Japan was notoriously terrible. The animated series is also much more ""family-friendly"" than the comic. Most of the fan-service is implied rather than directly shown, so if you only read ""Negima!"" for the panties you might be a little disappointed. The English-language script takes the ""family friendly"" approach even further, and is slightly different from the Japanese. Many of the ""double entendres"" and sexual humor has been removed.

And while I am not usually a fan of dubbing, a special shout out needs to be done here for Funimation's English-language cast. They have done a great job, even going so far as to give Negi a Welsh accent. This is one case where they might be better than the Japanese original cast. Listening to the ""Native Speaking"" Negi doing English dictation during his English classes is pretty funny.",1249344000,7,3674,5.960151802656546
3287674,5,B0010X8NNC,"The series started out a bit awkward, but as th story started to develop the show got so interesting i went to bed at 5am every day so i could view more and ore episodes. i love it how the story developed; the character that mostly caught my eye was Asuna Kagurazaka. I love the way she acts, the way she handles everything. to me the most important character in the whole story was her more than any other character. saying these it means that i rate these show a 5 star show out of all the shows i own. as soon as i saw it i had to buy it.

Now i have seen these show over 3 times and it hasn't arrived yet. i can wait until it gets here. LOve it.",1248220800,,649,3.843283582089552
3287675,3,B0010X8NNC,"Negi Springfield is often touted as Japan's answer to Harry Potter, although in personality he's a bit more like Hermione.

And while the wizard prodigy isn't quite shown to his full potential in the anime adaptation ""Negima,"" where stretches of fluffy harem comedy are speckled with serious magic and action. While it starts slowly and relies too heavily on semi-nudity and slapsticky antics, the more wizardly adventures end up keeping it worth watching.

Middle-school student Asuna is desperately hoping that her crush, Professor Takahata, will be teaching homeroom at Mahora Academy this year... and her mood is further soured by a preteen boy who tells her, ""Not everyone can be lucky in love.""

Turns out the boy, a Welsh prodigy named Negi Springfield, IS the new teacher. Most of the girls immediately love him, but Asuna is enraged by Negi's ""weirdness"" -- when she glimpses him magically saving a student, his secret comes out: Negi is a wizard, and if Asuna reveals his secret he'll be turned into an ermine. Fortunately, Asuna agrees to keep his secret... if he makes a love potion for her, with predictably chaotic results.

And soon Negi is faced by a creature from his family past -- a vampiric student who is determined to drain his blood. And he has to deal with myriad other troubles -- web idols, vicious volleyball teams, kiss contests, spying cheerleaders, a timid ghost, and a scheming ermine. And when Negi's job hangs on his class's bottom-of-the-barrel test scores, Asuna organizes a trip to the mysterious Library Island to get a magical book that can make even the Dummy Force smart!

But things take a dark turn near the end of the series -- a trip to Kyoto goes awry when Konoka is threatened, and the mysterious sword-wielding Setsuna reveals her true identity. And upon returning, Asuna becomes increasingly ill -- leading Negi to discover a horrifying secret in her past, which links the doomed girl to his vanished father.

Ken Akamatsu's original manga is pretty much balanced out -- part of it is slam-bang magic'n'action, while the other part is kooky romantic comedy and crazy slapstick. And for the anime, ""Negima"" serves up an incredibly heavy dose of the kooky comedy/crazy slapstick, with an emphasis on busts, robots, superpowered kicks, ninjas and the occasional skyscraper-sized demon.

In fact many episodes are nothing but poor Negi getting swamped by his high-spirited students and the devious ermine Chamo's manipulations (which involve awkward kissing). Lots of skimpy clothes, confessions of love, bear panties and kooky dialogue (""Side effects may include dry mouth, nausea and loss of about a million brain cells...""). It's like an amped-up romantic sitcom with some magical trappings.

While the comedic stories are fun in a disposable way, what makes the series truly watchable is the magic-oriented episodes -- aerial battles with tiny blonde vampires and playing chase with a giant stone golem amongst them. The end of the series is when the magical adventures really take front-and-center: though the whole trip to Kyoto rushes by way too fast, the final bittersweet arc is nothing short of brilliant.

It's icky to see teenage girls pursuing a ten-year-old, but Negi is a likable little hero -- he's earnest, unselfish, and completely devoted to his students even if they're insane. Asuna is his opposite -- brash, temperamental, unexpectedly warmhearted -- and serves as a mildly violent big-sister type, although their roles unexpectedly switch near the finale.

Surprisingly the rest of the cast plenty of fleshing-out as well -- sweet Konoka, mysterious Setsuna, the antisocial web idol Chisame (""This is CHIU's world and all you bimbos are mere tenants!""), serene ninja Kaede, and the loopy princess Ayaka (who has a surprisingly tragic past). Most memorable is the prepubescent vampire-mage Evangeline (""It's enough to make ANYONE CRAZY!""), and her cat-loving robot Chachamaru.

The complete ""Negima"" season is a bit too heavy on the fluffy comedy, and too light on the magical adventures. But it's still worth watching for those who need a bit more Magorum magic.",1247184000,3,4129,5.120356612184249
3287676,3,B0010X8NNC,"Negima! The Complete Collection is a four-disc DVD set that includes all twenty-six episodes of the original Negima! series.  The set is packaged in two thinpack DVD boxes, and each thinpack box includes two DVDs.  The first two discs include seven episodes, while the third disc contains six episodes, and the final disc includes six episodes and the special features.  For special features, there is a textless version of the opening, textless versions of both endings, as well as trailers.

When you start watching the set, Negima! comes off as a rather light-hearted show.  But as you progress through the series, the tone starts changing.  The tonal change becomes a bit more noticeable on disc three, and the tonal shift is completed on disc four.  By the end of disc four, expect to see some pathos, and you might need a handkerchief while watching a couple of the episodes.

In some respects, I'm disappointed at the relative lack of effort FUNimation put into this set.  While it was nice they could fit an impressive number of episodes on each disc, this seem to come at the cost of a lack of special features.  I'm also a little disappointed with the fact that the ""Episodes"" menu is not a ""scene selection"" menu.  Even with its flaws, this set is still a worthwhile addition to your anime DVD library if you're a fan of the original Negima! series.",1243900800,,1360,4.720338983050848

3287678,5,B0010X8NNC,"This series is about a boy who is VERY intelligent, but still prepubescent. Meaning, he doesn't think of girls like most anime protagonists do. He is also a wizard and a sharp one at that. His final lesson to becoming a top wizard, like his father before was. Is to become a teacher at an all-girls dormatory in Japan.

The series is the same makers of Love Hina. In both studio and author. Which means a couple of things: The plot is funny and deep, the girls are gonna be sexy and strong in personality, and that the main character is react in very funny way.

Those who have seen Love Hina know what I'm talking about! Negi is a little from Keitaro, but he still is a good guy. But Negi is almost instantly liked by all the girls. All except the main heroine.

26-episodes long, this story only covers the initial plot lines, which makes it a stereotypical harem anime, with some nice differences, but it doesn't cover the best parts of the manga.

This boxset doesn't contain the extras the old DVDs had, but you still get quality anime with each disc, besides who cares about extras, when you have an anime as good as this.",1239235200,,1128,4.382775119617225

One of the best things about it is the character development. I love all the little quirks that make the characters unique.

8238945,4,B0010X8NNC,"I'll say this right now. Negima is my favorite harem series and that's only because Ken Akamatsu had the guts to change it from a romantic comedy to an action despite the higher ups wanting to cash on the success of Love Hina. As a result, this series was able to attract a large demographic of both genders and ages despite the heavy fanservice (and as a result, a lot of gay jokes were added later to appeal to us ladies~)

The manga is the best. This anime is the first adaption of the series and is the most faithful until the OVA. As a result, the anime only followed up to the Kyoto arc before going its own way. As a result, we get a disappointing ending to a great series that is known for the genre shift into the action. You only get a few battle scenes in this series and more fanservice episodes. This series slowly tried to develop the characters but given how the series ended, only a few of the girls got the spotlight.

The Kyoto arc in itself was rushed largely so there was no hope of characters like Kotoro to make an appearance or Fate to be threatening.

So in the end, I give this series a 4 stars mainly because the ending was lame for me and the fact that it could have followed the manga way better.",1362009600,2,1224,4.177966101694915
