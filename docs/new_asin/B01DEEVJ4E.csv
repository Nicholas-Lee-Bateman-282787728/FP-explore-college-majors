7712016,3,B01DEEVJ4E,"I found  this movie to be rather dull.  John  Payne  is  much  older  in  this  film  than  previous  ones he  made  at the peak  of  his  career.  Also,  the  music  seemed  loud  and  discordant  at  times  with  the  plot being  somewhat  confusing.",1467244800,12,252,4.285714285714286

8755718,1,B01DEEVJ4E,"A real stinker -- no wonder nobody's ever heard of it. Endlessly plodding, so badly mastered that it needs subtitles, this tedious bore is, naturally, set in Europe's dullest capital. I like Payne and DeToth a lot, and I love late '40s, '50s and early '60s crime flicks and film noir. This is neither. I tried watching it all the way through about six times. When I wasn't nodding out -- no shmeck involved -- I was trying to figure out what was happening. Something about the main character's sister accused of murder. At one point, she screams at her brother -- Payne -- ""OK, I'm a tramp. But I didn't kill him."" That's the best line around here. Avoid this one -- and see ""Crime Wave"" instead.",1477008000,9,696,4.4453125
