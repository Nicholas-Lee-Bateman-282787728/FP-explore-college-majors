8008318,5,B00018U99I,It shows some good rope work a little and the movement of the glacier is very interesting.  I wish the movie was two hours long instead of only one.  It's very good tho.,1364688000,,169,4.090909090909091
8008319,2,B00018U99I,I expected more from a broadcast with such a flashy title. All you see are some divers going down into an 80 feet deep well in murky waters. That's the whole descent! Over after five minutes! The rest is interesting but nothing really exciting.,1200614400,,244,4.568181818181818
8008320,4,B00018U99I,"Although beautifully made this movie will only be interesting for people who are in love with glacier stuff. A team in search of lakes hidden under the glaciers of mount blanc of Europe is depicted in this movie. A great deal of information on how do they go inside the glacier, what equipments are used, how the blockage of water is detected from top to bottom flow of water by adding colour to it and all that stuff. Watch worthy and value for money for those who are interested.",1111795200,6,481,4.415730337078652
