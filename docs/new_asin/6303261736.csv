This isn't just another sword-fight movie; this is a deep moral reflection on the choices that all  soldiers must make in fulfilling their duties. The beautiful imagery,  acting, and ironic twists are high art. The influences this film must have  had on Anime are unmistakable.

611613,5,6303261736,"So much has probably been said about this movie that I don't know what I can add to it.  First, this might be the best movie from Masaki Kobayashi who directed many a great film.  Second, the writing from Shinobu Hashimoto is tight and very smart, and ranks right up there with his best, which is saying quite a lot.  Thirdly, there's Tatsuya Nakadai, who delivers an amazing performance, both pitiable as his family struggles to survive and unnerving and fearsome as he takes his revenge.  This all adds up to a classic of Japanese cinema that is absolutely essential as it is watchable.",1436400000,,588,4.625

611620,4,6303261736,"Film = four (4) stars; restoration = five (5) stars.  This is a melodramatic tale set in Japan's early 1600's.  It was a time of major societal disruption when unemployed samurai (known as ""ronin"") became a major problem with the ""peaceful"" unification of Japan under one emperor.  Ronin lacked few (if any) skills transferable to civilian life.  Their rigid adherence to the ""samurai code of honor"" did not help matters.  They become dependent on handouts (sometimes coerced and gained by trickery).  The director spins a story to illustrate how a military honor code ingrained over hundreds of years can rapidly become dysfunctional and of little practical use when the zeitgeist changes.  The point being that outside of military life and its sponsors, the samurai code is really a ""facade.""  Direction is seamless and creative:  most of the film uses a single set, but the viewer scarcely notices this and is rarely bored (the movie, however, is a bit too long).  Acting by Tatsuya Nakadai is a wonder to behold, and arguably the best brought to the ""classical"" Japanese cinema.  The score is stark (mostly consisting of what sounds like a single gottan), but effective.  Cinematography (black and white, wide screen) is excellent with scene lighting adding much to driving the film's theme home to the viewer.  Set decoration is appropriately sparse with many interiors either shot on location or carefully recreated in a studio setting.  Subtitles leave a lot to be desired.  They are usually too long with the title writer taking great liberties when translating line readings.  Once again Criterion restoration engineers seem to take delight in harassing the viewer when s/he tries to turn on/off subtitles (you never know what to expect until restarting the film).  Highly recommended!  WILLIAM FLANIGAN, PhD.",1417219200,,1818,5.146757679180888

611704,5,6303261736,"This might be the greatest Samurai film ever made; tied (in my opinion) with the Seven Samurai, and while it's not action-packed like Seven Samurai, the story is so well told, the plot so expertly crafted, I still had no idea what to expect even in the last moments of the film.

The whole movie has the main character in a fatal situation you know he can't escape from and yet he still manages to get the upper hand on everyone. The story is, in a way, very much like that of Ulysses in that you're forced to get to know the story of an average, down on his luck nobody most people wouldn't give a second glance to on the street. And the lord of the keep, well, he's such a puffed up 'powerful man' that he takes no half-measures with anyone, he takes no pity on anyone, and he claims no honor for himself.

What I found most interesting, however, was that this was a film about the honor of Samurai living during a time of relative peace who can find no way to live without war. There's one scene where the son-in-law is refused work because he is, in fact, a Samurai and they don't want a sword mixing with a spade and he's turned away. We are made to empathize with a man whose job is to kill people, to be the a weapon of strife, to bring war when there is no peace. That, more than anything else, was unsettling and makes this film a towering masterpiece of storytelling.",1405209600,2,1377,4.212121212121212

It tells of a time when samurai were losing their masters and how they survived, but that is only the background as it has a GREAT plot that builds to the final minutes where it all comes together.  Told in flash-backs which makes the movie all that more complicated and interesting.  When it is done in this way and done well it can be powerful.

611709,4,6303261736,"The Newbury_comics/Amazon delivery was flawless, but the film fell short of perfection. I like the story very well - even more so since I am a man or honor living in the DC area - the US Capital of posturing and hypocrisy.  The epilogue of this film includes what politicians would call ""spin control.""  Like reviewer Nicholas Roach, I found this film slow in parts, and I think some characters would have benefitted from a little more development. While Tatsuya Nakadai was good in the lead role, I would like to have seen a bit more athleticism and energy in some scenes.  This film is understated even compared with the films of other Japanese directors.

This is what I would do differently. I would visually provide just a little more development for several characters, including Motome and Miho. A close-up, or perhaps a practice swing to say goodbye to his sword, to show how Motome felt when he pawned his sword would have helped. A 30 second character shot of the second Iyi warrior would have added a lot.  In addition, the scenes in the courtyard were essentially static; more camera motion, at least, and more angles, would have added to the visual interest, especially in the scenes with Tsugumo Hanshiro.  Those scenes, because the repeated the appearance of similar scenes with Chijiiwa Motome, could have been shortened by 2-4 minutes, with good effect.  More variation in the camera angles would also have helped. The climactic fight sequence would have benefitted from more variety in moves and pacing, in order to enhance its kinetic excitement, and to vary the pace somewhat.  I would only think such things about a film that I like very well, so I do recommend this film.",1389484800,,1693,4.793814432989691
611755,5,6303261736,"This was not my first Masaki Kobayashi film, rather it's actually one of the last of his films I've viewed.  I fell in love with his films after watching the excellent Criterion Eclipse series:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Eclipse-Series-38-Masaki-Kobayashi-Against-the-System-The-Thick-Walled-Room-I-Will-Buy-You-Black-River-The-Inheritance-Criterion-Collection/dp/B00B2BYXYA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Eclipse Series 38: Masaki Kobayashi Against the System (The Thick-Walled Room, I Will Buy You, Black River, The Inheritance) (Criterion Collection)</a>.  Once I saw Kwaidan, I decided it was time to find Hara Kiri and watch it before tackling the 9+ hour Human Condition Trilogy.

Like most of Kobayashi's films, the surface is rather straightforward while the meaning is buried in layers of metaphor and situation parallels.  This film is a thinly veiled critique against the feudal system of 17th century and beyond.  The date takes place sometime following the Battle of Sekigahara which many of the samurai lament as one of the last battles of their time.  The film shows the hypocrisy of the feudal lords and can be easily be applied as a critique against modern (post WW2) Japan and Capitalism (he was a well known pacifist and extreme leftist).

The film stars Tatsuya Nakadai, a Kobayashi and Kurosawa regular, in one of his best roles.  Nakadai has a talent for the sarcastic, hopeless and yet honorable ronin role that he portrays beautifully in this film.  As a viewer, one is compelled to listen to his story, as the Ii clan are compelled to do as well.  We become enveloped in his tale and we genuinely feel sadness for the events that transpired after the disgrace and dissolution of his master's clan.

There is one scene which is quite well shot, but is very uncomfortable for the viewer: this is when Chijiiwa Motome is forced to commit seppuku (also known as hara kiri) with a bamboo blade.  Though not technically graphic (no bowels being exposed), the use of black and white filming has quite a dramatic effect on the blood and it is quite horrifying and yet oddly surreal at the same time.  Granted, Yukio Mishima's short film 'Patriotism' was MUCH more graphic (and quite prophetic), but it is still shocking and the viewer should be warned that this is really the most graphic part of the film and be encouraged to not be turned off.

I received this film as an inter-library loan from Evergreen College (thanks guys!) and it included the additional disc of bonus features as well as the excellent companion booklet with a 1972 interview with the director.  A stunning film and a wonderful restoration and presentation by Criterion films!",1389052800,2,2711,5.390995260663507
611756,5,6303261736,"Ever find yourself  up watching a foreign film? Well, this classic Japanese film will not let you down. This is one of my favorites, and you will enjoy it.",1386979200,,155,4.344827586206897
611757,5,6303261736,"In C.S. Lewis's classic The Screwtape Letters, one demon says to another demon that ""It will be an ill day for us if what most humans mean by 'religion' ever vanishes from the Earth. The fine flower of unholiness can grow only in the close neighborhood of the Holy. Nowhere do we tempt so successfully as on the very steps of the altar.""

Kobayashi's Harakiri demonstrates this unpleasant truth articulated by Lewis with a power rarely seen in any work of art, and a work of art this film is.

In the film, a wretchedly poor, old, and useless ronin (a samurai without a master) named Hanshiro Tsugumo travels to a flourishing, large samurai clan's temple so that he can commit ritual suicide there, the only way under the samurais' Bushido code that Tsugumo can die honorably given his current terrible circumstances. The samurai clan's members, led by a particularly vicious and intelligent samurai named Saito, cynically think that Tsugumo's plea to kill himself at their temple is merely a desperate job application to join their clan (after all, other down-and-out samurais have tried this tactic before). Because these ""job applications"" are starting to become common (times of relative peace are really hard on samurai warriors), Saito decides he is going to send a message to all other jobless samurais who are thinking of trying this gambit in the near future. Saito grants Tsugumo's request to kill himself at their temple, expecting Tsugumo to be struck with terror and try to backpedal out of his request. But Tsugumo doesn't. In fact, Tsugumo not only isn't afraid; he has the gall to look peaceful, even serene, as a slight, amused smile creeps onto his face. Saito quickly realizes that there is something seriously wrong with what has just transpired, but he can't put his finger on it. And if Saito knew exactly what he had just agreed to, he would be the one scared to death.

Are you one of those people who has been told you can't see the forest for the trees? Do you slavishly follow rules even when you can't understand the rule, or, if you understand the rule, do you still follow it even though you think it's terrible and should be abandoned? If you read Hugo's Les Miserables, did you root for Javert instead of Valjean? If any of these descriptions sound like you, you would do well to consider Mark Twain's wisdom - ""Loyalty to petrified opinions never yet broke a chain or freed a human soul."" You would also do well to watch Harakiri, and maybe then you would stop being such a scourge to the rest of us. For ""the rest of us,"" please watch Harakiri. You will enjoy it immensely.

I love samurai movies, and this movie is definitely about samurais, but to call Harakiri merely a good samurai movie is a serious disservice to the movie. It would be like calling Star Wars a good sci-fi movie or Raiders Of The Lost Ark a good adventure movie. Harakiri transcends its genre and is simply an incredible movie, no qualifier necessary. More a battle of wits than it is a battle of swords, Harakiri is brilliant, beautifully shot, suspenseful in ever-increasing intensity, and extremely well-acted. You will not forget this film once you see it. And you'll never look at bamboo in the same way again.",1386028800,7,3222,4.707446808510638

More importantly, it moved me very much and made me think. It may be a samurai period piece, but the basic story applies to us all, especially in these hard times when unemployment is so high all over the world. I dare say for many people, the film will stay with them for a long time, if not the rest of their lives.

Harakiri is an amazing anti-establishment study of all that is wrong with ideology, law and rulemaking untempered with humanity, grace and justice.

Set in the early (Tokugawa) Shogunate period, Hanshiro Tsugumo, through his final act in life, forces the guilt, shame and disgrace of a compassionless adherence to Bushido Code back onto the Iyi clan. The Tsugumo character gives a palpable contrast through a perspective that reveals Bushido only has true meaning through compassion and grace.

By extension, this is a powerful message that we must live life as humans cognitive of our full humanity and not as mindless cogs in our social, corporate, political and institutional machines. One of the greatest condemnations of blind obedience to an ideology ever put to film.

This is one of those rare gems where a truly powerful and universal message meets up with great acting and story telling. The screenplay carefully lays out the drama, dialog and character motivation reveals so that, inch by inch, yard by yard, the depth of depravity of the Iyi clan becomes apparent. The unbelievable outrage and shame of the Iyi clan with their version of a mindless and empty Bushido grows to reveal the monstrosity it truly is.

Visual metaphors abound as well, the most notable being their clan-master's empty samorai armor, stuffed with straw and hair, that sits on a throne representing the ever-absent head of the Iyi clan (presumably perpetually at the Tokugawa court in Edo). The clothes have no emporer, a metaphor for their empty idology, an icon mindlessly venerated as they live out their mindless existence without a master present to mitigate their lost humanity.

As usual, Criterion has created a marvelous transfer to DVD.

Masterfully conceived, written, filmed and edited, Harakiri is a shining example of how powerful films are made.",1353196800,3,2033,5.032738095238095

is spare and effective.  There are twists and turns wherever you look but everything seems completely natural and the camera work and editing are sublime but extremely effective.  This is a Japanese masterpiece you won't forget!

611862,5,6303261736,"I have to say that Kobayashi is one of the greatest filmmakers I have seen for. Though Kobayashi is a recent discovery to me, I have already seen three films by him: Harakiri, Samurai Rebellion, and The Human Condition. I have also ordered Kwaidan and I cannot wait for it to arrive to watch it.

Because Akira Kurosawa is my all time favourite director, Masaki Kobayashi has to come second. That's because I love Kurosawa more : )

To be quite honest, I have never ever thought that I would watch films for a filmmaker that can contend with Kurosawa. Not until I discovered Kobayashi. One of the things that made me love his films is the sheer power of his films that captures you right from the very beginning to the extraordinary execution. I have never felt bored, not for a second, while watching this film along with the other two films I mentioned above. The other thing that I really admire Kobayashi for is his ability to convey his message especially that of the individual's constant struggle against the cruel authorities with so much force and seriousness that is rare in many other films out there. It's really unique and makes you respect the mind and soul that created that idea.

This film has lost the Palme d'Or to the Italian film The Leopard. I have seen both films and in my humble opinion (and I am not a film critic) Harakiri is far better and it should have grabbed the first prize at Cannnes. Some people might not agree with me but I would suggest you watch both films and then you decide for yourselves. I have seen the Leopard once and I am not planning to watch it a second time soon, however, I am willing to watch all the three films I have already watched for Kobayashi a second time including the nine and half an hour long film, The Human Condition which is an epic achievement in every sense of the word.

The only thing I can say for certainty now is that Kobayashi never disappoints.

As for the Criterion treatment of the film, I would say it's superb 10/10 : )

(OFF-TOPIC) In my country, Oman, such films are hard if not impossible to find and that's why I have to purchase many of my DVDs at amazon. It makes me sad that so many people in Oman are not quite familiar with great artists. Therefore, I decided to talk about such films with my friends and encourage them to give them a go. It's working. I have lent my colleagues at my work place some DVDs of foreign films that I watched and liked. Films by some of my favourite directors such as Akira Kurosawa, Masaki Kobayashi, Emir Kusturitca, Ingmar Bergman, Federico Fellini, etc. It's my ultimate wish that one day such films become more widely available in our country and be shown on our national TV!",1344729600,3,2699,4.442424242424242

The implication in the use of this word in the title of the movie is clear, for the director uses his story to strip away the romantic facade of a bygone era so common in historical tales, exposing the pain and oppression that is so frequently at the heart of any system in which the individual is secondary to the social code that prevails.  There is no shortage of films that rely on the romance of Japanese feudalism, but this one is, rather, about the human cost of that system.

A timeless ordeal that has marred humanity since our infancy is brought here (in HARA KIRI) to the most stunning, effective and thought-provoking representation I've ever witnessed on film.  The premise and the narrative are simple enough for anyone to comprehend, yet wrought with limitless subtlety to keep the thinker thinking for a very long time.  This film will infinitely test the Draconian thinker as it's difficult for the rationalist to bend under passionate distress.  But when humanity presents itself naked and powerless, even Samurai code is put to the test.  This film is a terrific representation of both sides of a uniquely human equation.  On one hand, we are bound to the authorities which we invent.  On the other, we are bound to the humanity with which we are born.  As honorable as it is to remain tenacious for a belief, it's just as honorable to fight relentlessly for survival.  It's just plain wrong, however, for authority to manipulate the very honor for which it is regarded in order to spite or punish those who struggle to live.  I can understand and respect punishment, but I will never respect or agree with punishment that is handed out fraudulently.  An early character is this film commits hara kiri, believing that given his present circumstances, hara kiri is the most honorable and respectable way die.  Unbeknownst to him, however, his superiors are using hara kiri as a means of punishment, made all the more brutal and inhumane through the use of a bamboo blade.  Had the character committing hara kiri disclosed his situation to his superiors, or had his superiors asked the character to disclose his situation, the hara kiri and ensuing revenge plot might have been avoided entirely.  But unfortunately, our unwavering fortitude under invented systems of belief and authority can and will inevitably lead to tragic ends.  As far as the picture is concerned, Criterion nails it.  Unless you're a raging cinephile, ignore the cropping criticisms.  The experts at Criterion wouldn't crop unless it were absolutely necessary to improve the overall aesthetic virtues of the transfer.  Regardless, the cropping is insignificant; the cinematography remains among the best ever.  I was floored by some of the close-ups; they're really shocking.  It's obvious after seeing this film where modern Japanese filmmakers find their inspiration.  This is about as beautiful as black and white gets, the most beautiful b&w film I've seen being THE WHITE RIBBON on BD.  This transfer comes pretty darn close to that, and this film is how old again?  Criterion are good at respectfully handling grain.  So, no issues there.  There are spots and scratches every now and then, but they're extremely few and insignificant.  If it weren't for their occasional appearance, it would be difficult to discern the age of this movie.  The audio is mono.  What more can be said about it?  Yes, it's as true to the source as you're going to get, and it's extremely clean, but it's still mono.  I hope you enjoy this film as much as I did :)",1343606400,,3176,4.971537001897533
611983,5,6303261736,"This movie is a classic and well worth adding to your personal collection if you enjoy Japanese cinema. If you have a blu-ray player and don't already own it in any format then blu-ray is highly recommended. This review is for those who already own the Criterion DVD and are on the fence about upgrading to blu-ray.

I purchased the Criterion DVD set several years ago and have enjoyed it over many viewings. Recently, another seller ran a 50% off sale on Criterion releases; I picked up Harakiri on blu-ray and watched it last night. This morning, I popped in my old DVD to compare the differences, and have come to the following conclusions.

Film grain was more pronounced on the blu-ray disc, but that is an inevitable result of converting an older film to high definition. The grain is always present in a DVD release, but not as visible as in a high-definition transfer. The positive trade-off is an overall MUCH sharper picture, and, in my opinion, Criterion has done a fantastic job in converting this film to blu-ray. I'm glad I did the blu-ray upgrade, and will enjoy this film for many years to come.

Highly recommended...4.5 stars.",1342915200,,1144,4.71
611984,5,6303261736,"The film that Harakiri shares the most cinematic DNA with is Kurosawa's The Bad Sleep Well. In a sense, that film is the modern retelling of this film, wherein a vengeance seeking hero plots to destroy his tormentors, only to have him end up dying, as well as having the real truth expunged. But, along with that film, Harakiri never errs by making its politics lead its art around. From the almost exact repetitions of the early actions of Chijiwa and Tsugumo in the Iyi house, to the repetition of the samurai armor to start and end the film, there is no doubt that politics is merely a weapon in the artistic arsenal; it is not its raison d'etre. But, the film also shares much artistry and narrative technique in common with Kurosawa's more placid Ikiru, which also has a large portion of its ending consist of characters relating flashbacks of what happened to the film's lead character. That this dialogue intensity occurs in a samurai film is unusual, but only at first blush, since Harakiri is, in reality, as much of a samurai film as Stanley Kubrick's Paths Of Glory can be called a `war' film. And, like films like The Wild Bunch and Once Upoin A Time In The West, Harakiri ends with a symbolic foreshadow of the future of the nation it's set in. It is no happenstance that the rogue ronin Tsugumo is not felled by another's sword, but only by guns, for that was the way the Tokugawa Shogunate, the ultimate bad guy in this film, was to fall almost 240 years later.

  The Human Condition ultimately missed out on greatness because of its length and overarching ambition, which sometimes obfuscated points that should have rung clarion. Harakiri does not suffer that ill. It is a deft lightning strike at its target, and as such delivers a killer blow. It also shows that Japan's filmic legacy, in the 20th Century, was more than its Big Three directors, Kurosawa, Yasujiro Ozu, and Kenji Mizoguchi. Masaki Kobayashi seems to be every bit their equal, and, along with Kon Ichikawa, Hiroshi Teshigahara, Shohei Imammura, Nagisa Oshima, and Mikio Naruse, the middle part of the last century seems to have been, for Japanese film, one of the most Golden of Golden Ages any country has experienced in any art form. Bravo!",1339027200,,2228,4.678571428571429
611985,5,6303261736,"One of the most unique of samurai tales, this is a movie that is a worthy addition to your classic film collection even if you are not a huge fan of the genre. Despite all of the blood on the cover, the fight scenes are at a minimum and used only for specific purpose. The film focuses on the fact that for many the ""samurai code"" is overly romantacized, hijacked, and used for evil purpose. Just as the greatest threat to the church is from false prohets, ""false samurai"" likewise do a huge disservice to a historically evolving Japan in search of a new identity and direction.

Without getting into spoilers, the movie uses one such aspect of the samurai code, ritualistic suicide, and turns it inside out. Often times, it's the ones watching the death that should be dieing, and not the other way around.

The movie is perfectly executed with the exception of one portion of the film that moves somewhat slow. This is as much a plot device as anything else however, an example of the care that director Kobayashi puts behind the characters. When a noble ronin is forced to act in a manner that makes him look dishonorable, you almost sense the director knew how pure his motivations were, and so he intentionally draws out the deplorable conditions that lead the ronin to that point. In this way the viewer understands the motivation without a shadow of doubt as to the character's true nature. There will be no mistaken dishonor here.

Even if giving this slow section of the movie 4 out of 5 stars, the other portions of the movie more than make up for it with brilliant set-ups, a stunning conclusion, excellent filming, and a unique, non-formulaic, and well acted script. Everyone throws around such accolades as ""one of the best films"" all the time, but in this case it's really true. Powerful and highly recommended.",1328918400,,1825,4.643962848297214
611986,5,6303261736,"This could be an alternative title for this masterpiece. Few films ever made me such an effect as ""Harakiri"" and made me so much think about human life and how fragile it is as well as about happiness and how precious - and always too short - are the moments we enjoy it. I will not reveal anything about the story, but I think it is worthy to describe the first 30 seconds, which immediately nailed me to the seat by making me realise that I was watching a unique master piece.

So here they are: it begins with an old book in Japanese being opened somewhere in the middle and a calm voice reading: ""This day of year 1630, in the morning, men came from the village to present gifts of fish to the castle. No other official business occurred. However, later that day, a well spoken and polite although clearly malnurished and poorly clothed ronin presented himself at the gate with a most unusual request...""

What follows is the story of a tragedy so heartbreaking that even Victor Hugo in ""Les Miserables"" didn't manage to equal it. It is also the story of an unjustice so disgusting that it would probably make Dickens and Zola weep like teenage girlies... And finally it is the story of a vengeance so mean and terrible that it makes ""Death Wish"" series look as a Disney movie in comparison -and even more remarkable is the fact that this revenge doesn't include ANY deaths and, still better, not even one drop of blood is spilled... Curious, isn't it? Well, the only way to find the solution of this riddle, is to watch the movie...

What was written above doesn't mean that this film is easy to watch - the title is not metaphoric, so be prepared to at least one scene that is purely horrible! Some swordfighting is also involved, but if this is what you are looking for in samurai movies, don't bother even beginning watching this one - the sword fighting is so much NOT the point here!

Masaki Kobayashi is one of the major Japanese movie makers and ""Harakiri"" is his masterpiece. It easily matches every Kurosawa movie, and - I hardly can believe that I am writing it - it can be even better than ""Seven Samurai""! Both movies are of course very different, but if I had to choose only one to preserve for posterity from certain destruction, I would face a really tough choice. And all my life I considered ""Seven Samurai"" as THE perfect movie - until I finally saw this one...

All actors are doing great in ""Harakiri"" but it is of course Tatsuya Nakadai who has the greatest responsability and plays the hardest part as (yes, you guessed right) this mysterious ""well spoken and polite although malnurished and poorly clothed ronin""... This kind of acting is clearly inspired somewhere very high (or somewhere very low) but clearly it is not permitted to regular earthlings to reach such level of perfection... At every minute of the movie Tatsuya Nakadai could spoil it by any kind of little mistake - but he never made one.

I really do not see what else could I tell, so just one little warning. This is not a movie for a friday evening with your girlfriend. First, she will probably run away after first 30 minutes to cry in her room (if she doesn't, dump her - she is certainly not a human female at all and probably devours males after mating). And if by any miracle you manage to watch this movie together until the end, you can certainly expect that she will need lot of cuddling later, but that will be it. I can not imagine any romance developping in the 24-48 hours following the watching of this movie... ""Harakiri"" will give you a great satisfaction (pun very much intentional), but not one of Friday evening variety...

This is an important and unique movie. At least once in a lifetime everybody should watch it.",1328572800,,3735,4.516272189349112

Some have begun to appear on the doorsteps of powerful clans, asking the right to commit ritual suicide within but actually hoping that their show of devotion will inspire some act of charity.

The stage is set for reversals, surprises, and revenge.

Director Masaki Kobayashi created a masterpiece.

I have also added two comparison images to the Amazon Product photo gallery at the top of this page.

In the stereotypical Japanese movie, everyone dies at the end; in this case, the villain doesn't. He invents a cover story that protects his interests. That's one of the twists that makes this film a comment on WWII. It's a pacifist statement of post-war Japan, set in medieval times. It also makes the point that defiance of custom is sometimes justified; for the Japanese, this was a significant cultural development, still going on in ""Bleach,"" where it's a central theme.

612056,5,6303261736,"Seppuku, or Harakiri, is a form of ritual suicide by disembowelment, reserved for those who would rather die with honor than live with shame. Originally reserved for Samurai, it later crept through many other parts of Japanese culture-even though it may have fallen out of popularity(is ""popular"" the correct label for suicide?), due to the rise of easier methods for ending one's own existence.

Due to the peaceful times of the film, samurai are left without Lords or Houses to honor and defend which has led to them being unemployed. In such unfortunate times samurai are forced to participate in menial tasks just to feed themselves. These conditions have obliged disgraced samurai to approach certain Houses for aid in committing seppuku-for every person committing this act requires a second to behead him after disembowelment. As daring as samurai may be the Houses are not enthusiastic to grant such a wish, and to avoid such commotion have on many instances offered aid to the distressed samurai in  return; however, many have taken advantage of this situation to garner money as an excuse for seppuku.

 The story of Harakiri is set upon an accomplished samurai, Hanshiro Tsugumo, who in dire straits want to commit seppuku within at the house of a Lord, Kageyu Saito. Kageyu admires Hanshiro's composure, determination, and honesty and is more than welcome to grant his service to such a deserving samurai. However, before he grants him his wish, he tells a tale of a man from the same House as Hanshiro Tsugumo, named Motome Chijiiwa-whom Hanshiro denies remembering. Kageyu tells of this foolish young samurai's attempt to commit seppuku with a bamboo sword, and the pain and anguish that the process carried for him and the onlookers. Hanshiro assures Kageyu that he will not back down from his decision, regardless of the pain and misery that will undeniably follow.

 As the clan readies itself to see such an honorable samurai commit suicide, Hanshiro asks the Kageyu if it is possible to choose his own second. He recites name after name, but unfortunately all his choices have taken leave of absence for one reason or another. Kageyu respectfully sends a messenger to see if it is possible that any of Hanshiro's desired seconds attend the ceremony. In the meantime, to engage the samurai, Hanshiro chooses to tell the tale of his daunting life which turns to be a stimulating experience and shocks Kageyu who ends up with more than one dead samurai on his hands by the time Hanshiro's suicide is complete.

 Harakiri is in its true form an anti-authoritarian film, which vivid symbolism such as a hideous complete set of samurai armor that displays the honor which is so dearly  held by all samurai; such a piece of honor freezes the entire army of samurai as they feel this set of armor is threatened. Harakiri, however, is not about honor, as much as it is opposed to honor, displaying the utter sham that it is, and the lives that such an unnecessary concept destroys.

 The beauty of Harakiri lies in the fact that it simply allows the audience to infer its philosophy rather than enforcing it upon the audience. Hollywood films such as Clint Eastwood's The Unforgiven could be classified as having similar anti-authoritarian, anti-violence, peaceful messages as Harakiri, but with a more obvious and enforced personality. . The film gains its edge by always challenging us, and making the audience wonder what other trick could Hanshiro have up his sleeve? The films relationship with samurai is quite brutal, labeling their attitude and antics as excessive, unordinary, and simply barbaric.

 The blatant force of Harakiri lies in its surprise, condemnation, and provocation that it lends toward its subject. Director Kobayashi shows his resent and distaste for the samurai way, its acceptable violent nature, and its delusional code of honor that not only makes the life, and death of a samurai, a surreal experience, but it asserts possession over the samurai's individual life in a way that he is not his own man even in death; even at the last moment of death, he is prisoner to his Lord and his House. Harakiri condemns the institution for degrading the samurai to such a condition that even in peaceful times he cannot be responsible for his eternal end; but further so, criticizes the samurai for allowing the institution of feeding him such empty concepts. Hanshiro's suicide is not a mere disembowelment, but a noble mission that tears open the defected heart of the seemingly noble duties that men swear to protect, respect, and admire.

 In addition to its philosophical beauty, Harakiri is masterfully acted by a group of talented actors, among whom Tatsuya Nakadai's portrayal of Hanshiro Tsugumo, known for his long relationship with Akira Kurosawa and Kobayashi himself, leaves the most impression; as he says himself, in the bonus interview segment-offered by the Criterion Collection-Hanshiro seems to be automatically fit a method actor such as Toshiro Mifune, but Nakadai pulls of his job with great compassion for the main character. Besides the flashbacks of the past, that dominate much of the film, the rest of the film is set in the open boundaries of the House, with Hanshiro placed in the center of the field while all the samurai, including the Lord are seated in a distance, almost forming a fence around him to insure that there is no chance of escaping the conditions set for him. Considered a front runner by many, including the cast members, for the Palme d'Or, Harakiri rightfully garnered the Special Jury Prize, as the top prize went to another masterful film, Luchino Visconti's The Leopard.",1276041600,4,5653,4.98619957537155

612059,5,6303261736,"The retainer log book for the Official Residence of Lord Iyi reports that at midday on an otherwise uneventful day on the thirteenth of May 1630, during the absence of the Honorable Heir Bennosuke, a gaunt, former retainer of the Lord of Geishu arrives at the mansion gates and is granted an interview with the Iyi clan elder, Saito Kayegu (Rentaro Mikuni). The solemn and enigmatic ronin (masterless samurai), Tsugumo Hanshiro (Tatsuya Nakadai), has led a dire life of poverty since the abolition of the Geishu clan in 1619, and now expresses his desire to die with dignity and commit harakiri (ritual disembowelment) in the sanctity of warlord grounds. However, in an era of peace with few employment prospects for samurai in the dwindling local feudal clans that were allowed to remain after the centralization of power by the Tokugawa shogunate, the request has become commonplace. Spurred by reports of generosity and benevolence towards the destitute ronins among the surviving clans, many desperate samurai have insincerely requested admission to commit harakiri with the expectation of being turned away with a small pittance. Saito cautions Tsugumo against making such a request, citing a pathetic and tragic incident involving another Geishu retainer, Chijiwa Motome (Akira Ishihama), who insincerely threatened harakiri as a ruse to obtain charity, and was compelled by the Iyi retainers to carry out the agonizing ritual using only a bamboo blade - the empty tokens of his privileged class pawned long ago to provide for his family. Undeterred, Tsugumo reaffirms his determination to perform the sacred act of seppuku (the disembowelment ritual performed in the presence of a second officiate swordsman who carries out the final head cutting), and requests the services of swordsman, Omodaka Hikokuro (Tetsuro Tamba), to act as his second officiate. Upon learning that Omodaka has taken a leave of absence, Tsugumo names two other Iyi retainers to carry out the task, Kawabe Umenosuke (Yoshio Aoki), then Yazaki Hayato (Ichir Nakaya), to no avail. As Tsugumo waits for the indisposed retainers, he proceeds to recount the story of his disillusioned life that led to this fateful day.

Based on a novel by Yasuhiko Takiguchi, Harakiri is a scathing indictment on the hypocrisy, repression, and barbarism of codified behavior. Using rigid rectangular framing against fluid tracking shots and exquisitely composed long shots that delineate class station and social disparity, Masaki Kobayashi visually reflects the oppressive confinement and regimentation of the samurai bushido (code of conduct): the title sequence presented against shots of the empty passageways that lead to the sacred chamber of the Iyi clan's ancestral armor; the isolating, diagonal shots of Saito's interviews with Tsugumo and Chijiwa; the repeated image of Tsugumo on a ceremonial mat encircled by retainers. By illustrating the class stratification and imposed social conformity fostered by the Tokugawa shogunate (1600-1867) as a means of retaining and centralizing authority, Kobayashi presents a harrowing indictment of the ingrained cultural legacy of coercive, outmoded rituals, chauvinism, and blind obedience that resulted in the inhumanity and senseless tragedy of the Pacific War.",1262736000,3,3275,5.472332015810276
612060,5,6303261736,"(Note: All names are in Western order, given name then family name. Now, on to the review...) This is probably the finest chambara film you'll ever see, or at least that is my humble opinion. When I decided some time ago to go on a binge of watching so-called ""samurai films,"" I did a small amount of research and decided to see this one first. I had previously only seen Kurosawa's films, and, in my humble opinion, he did not make optimum use of the great Tatsuya Nakadai the way that Masaki Kobayashi has in this film and others. I think Kobayashi/Nakadai is at least as powerful a collaborative combination as Kurosawa/Mifune. What is more, the film is a visual and conceptual masterpiece, symmetrically drawn by meticulous master Kobayashi (like Kurosawa he trained as an artist) and scripted by Shinobu Hashimoto, who also did great service for the more well-known (in the West anyway) Kurosawa.

This film concerns the happening (as shown at the beginning chronicled by the scribe of the House of Ii) in the case of a middle-aged ronin, Hanshiro Tsugumo (Nakadai, at age 29, playing age 50), who requests the use of the clan's forecourt so that he may commit seppuku (hara-kiri as it is also known) to end his days honorably, for he is starving in this post-Warring States economy. As a samurai warrior in peacetime, his services are no longer in demand, so he is forced to take piecemeal employment, observing all the prohibitions inherent in the Japanese class system (for instance, a samurai may not make footwear because of a sandal's proximity to the ground--thus only lower class craftsmen may do this). Clan Councilor Kageyu Saito (Rentaro Mikuni) hears Tsugumo's request and proceeds to tell him what he considers a cautionary tale of another ronin who had earlier made the same request. Mikuni is appropriately reserved, soft-spoken and serious; these requests have caused the Ii and other houses serious problems, because many ronin have been given a few coins to hold them over and told to go away, or in other cases, they have been given low-level employment because the appeal was so audacious and extreme. This has caused a problem, and Saito as representative of the powerful Ii family must address it.

What follows is the slow unfolding of the sad tale of Tsugumo's fallen fortunes and the uncovering of the Ii's conception of samurai honor. Kobayashi called it an ""anti-samurai film,"" and indeed it is. Tsugumo, by slow recitation and careful maneuvering, presents his appeal and the reasons for it in a manner that builds a powerful and scathing indictment of what officially passed for ""honor"" in the days of the Tokugawa Shogunate. We are treated (if you can call it that) to a graphically horrible scene of ritual disemboweling at which the honorable swordsman and loyal Ii retainer Hikokuro Omodaka (Tetsuro Tamba in fine restrained form, the very picture of the ideal samurai swordsman) presides as kaishakunin (the ""second"" who performs the decapitation, which ends the ceremony). Omodaka recites the traditions of the ritual and takes care to project the image of the Ii clan as one who is the pinnacle of adherence to traditional honor. He is a true believer.

Presiding mutely over the entire formalized stageplay atmosphere is a symbol that might as well be the meat of the Ii's code of honor and the message of this film--it is an empty set of armor, the master's armor, which is set up and revered beyond measure. If it is disturbed or threatened, the retainers must defend it as if it were the most important of living beings. And yet it is empty, having not been required since the closing battles of the last era of warring states (relatively recent though they were in this setting). This is Kobayashi's message--the notion of honor as codified can only be an empty platitude in the face of the true human condition as represented by Tsugumo, who makes sure that Saito and the full measure of attending retainers are completely aware of that fact and its ramifications. Tatsuya Nakadai was trained as a stage actor primarily, and his resonant, very loud declamatory tone as he addresses the assembled Ii retainers is evident and creates an effect that rivets all watchers, both on-screen and in armchairs at home. This film was my first real introduction to just how powerful Nakadai is as a personality--he is at least Mifune's equal, although they are characteristically quite different (thus making films in which they clash with each other ultra-enjoyable, but I digress...) .

This film can be called a jidai-geki, as it is set in historical times, but more properly it is in the tradition of the chambara, the swordplay film. It is a fictional account in specifics, but set in 1630, not terribly long after the forces of Ieyasu Tokugawa united the bulk of the country under his rule. Basically, Ieyasu had consolidated his victory, and his grandson Iemitsu reigned. Many institutions of the Shogunate were still in their formative stages at this time; samurai who had previously been active were decommissioned and idled. Many more were disenfranchised or unseated due to having been aligned against Ieyasu as well.

Tsugumo is shown in a flashback (a device used a lot in this film) repairing the battlements of Hiroshima Castle with his good friend Jinnai Chijiwa (Yoshio Inaba, one of the original Seven Samurai), a fellow samurai (on the orders of his lord at the time). This seemingly innocent action was taken by the Tokugawa to be a possible threat--the act of preparing for hostilities by getting a castle into order. (The repairs to Hiroshima Castle were an actual piece of history, having been undertaken in 1619 by Lord Fukushima after damage from a flood; he was stripped of his lordship by the Shogun for this action). Thus, in our story, Tsugumo's lord comes to the attention of the Shogun, and the domain is seized, and Tsugumo and many thousands of samurai are set adrift to become ronin (literally ""wave men"") who had to seek their own way in life and secure whatever employment they could to survive. The lord is forced to commit seppuku, and some of his samurai would follow him in death (the practice of junshi, which was outlawed later by the Tokugawa). That action, too, had consequences, as it set the survivors of these samurai adrift without their family head, often at young ages.

The House of Ii, on the other hand, is one of those fortunate houses that was allied with Ieyasu and thus given the honor of being named fudai (major domain, given active roles in the Shogunate administration). To indict Ii in the manner Kobayashi has done is to indict the Tokugawa system itself, for the Ii are full beneficiaries and representatives of the ruling elite.

Kobayashi's style of visual blocking will be obvious in this film. The courtyard at which much of the exposition takes place is symmetrical and neat, the interiors spare. However, when it comes to the living space of Tsugumo the ronin and his house, the spare quality is darkened and cramped. We see Tsugumo receive an unexpected visitor while he is plying his typically ronin-practiced trade of crafting umbrellas. There is only enough room for Tsugumo, the skeletal unfinished parasol and the stooping visitor. The message is obvious. Although this is chambara, the mood is patient and the progression slow and formally stylized; those watchers who hunger for sword action will have to wait, but the wait and build-up is well worth it, making the denouement eminently satisfying and appropriate. Kobayashi has a framing device of the scribe for the House of Ii which encapsulates the event and makes an even more scathing statement about history and those who write it. This device is also used to great effect in Okamoto's ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Samurai-Assassin/dp/B0006N0E4S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Samurai Assassin</a>,"" but I think it has even more effect here as a punctuating end note. (That movie, interestingly, concerns one prominent member of the House of Ii as well.)

One aspect I have failed to mention is the score, which is spare and quite appropriate. Toru Takemitsu's music uses traditional Japanese instrumentation, achieving auditorily what Kobayashi achieves visually with his carefully symmetrical and spare sets. It is an auspicious collaboration; the two masters of their crafts blend in perfect harmony in this film.

I watched the Criterion version on DVD, and the interviews on the second DVD are most illuminating as well. Shinobu Hashimoto tells how he came up with the idea for the story; Tatsuya Nakadai reveals that they used real swords for the action and that he was rather frightened by this aspect. Tetsuro Tamba had previous training in sword arts, whereas this was Nakadai's first attempt in the genre (apart from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Yojimbo/dp/B000K0YLZ0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Yojimbo </a>&nbsp;a year earlier, but as we remember, he carried a gun in that one). (Also I don't think we can count his 2 second walk-by in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Seven-Samurai/dp/B000G8NXYG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Seven Samurai</a>&nbsp;that you will miss if you blink....)We hear from an interview with Kobayashi about the reception of the film at Cannes, which was quite extreme, and the introduction to the film by Donald Richie, which appears on the first DVD, should not be viewed until later if you want to maintain the surprise. I don't think I've revealed too much here in this review, although I did want to clarify some historical and thematic notes.

Seppuku as a thematic element is thickly marbled in the fabric of the tale: Tsugumo's disenfranchised lord, other ronin in his situation, samurai who have failed their lords in important tasks--all these merit this ""punishment,"" and yet it is counted an honor afforded only to the samurai class and those above. It is a means of control but also a special privilege; therein lies its uniqueness and its status as a sort of double-edged sword, so to speak. Just as with the sword itself, the way in which this ritual is utilized is key to whether a character or institution is honorable or not, and it can be used to make a powerful statement for good or ill.

612132,5,6303261736,"I hesitate to add my two cents to this collection of excellent reviews. I have long been a fan both of Japanese cinema and Sword films, as well as a life long student of Zen. Samurai culture has roots in Zen traditions, and the most sophisticated Sword films address this spiritual context. These principles are illustrated profoundly in the famous Samurai Trilogy, by Inagaki&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Samurai-Trilogy-Box-Set-Criterion-Collection/dp/B0001UZZT0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Samurai Trilogy Box Set - Criterion Collection</a>. It is said that the soul of a Samuai is his sword. To approach a craftsman and request that he polish your sword is a form of metanoia, the surrender of a student to the guidance of an expert. So, if the sword IS the soul of a Samurai--what does it mean to polish the sword? This is the essence of Zen--the Sword of Discriminative Wisdom. How does one polish the sword of discriminative wisdom, which separates truth from illusion, or right Being from wrong Being?

Of course, mastery of swordsmanship, commitment to tradition, even sitting Zazen, is no guarantee of right understanding. Social status and pride is no certification of right understanding. Neither is adherence to custom and convention. The essence of the film reminds me of the admonition by Paul in his letter to the Corinthians: 'We are all qualified by the Spirit to minister the new covenant, not in the written word, which kills, but in the Spirit, which gives life. If it is possible to describe right understanding in Zen, this comes very close to the target.

Here is a Clan who misunderstood their moral imperative, and must accept a brutal lesson from a man they regard as worthless--but who demonstrates he is more worthy than the lot of them put together. The heart of Buddhist teaching is compassion. Compassion is identical with the recognition of the law of interdependent causation. The pursuit of the Noble Eightfold Path is no slight undertaking. A man who comes to your door requesting to commit suicide on your doorstep deserves special consideration. His situation is dire by definition. Why condemn him out of a rigid adherence to a sense of duty? Why condemn him just to send a message to other would be deadbeats? What would Buddha do? Why not lift the veil for a second and discover what brought him to your doorstep? Thing are not always as they appear. Not always as they seem. ""Is that so?"", asks the student of Zen with a smile.

This is a compelling, challenging film--a great lesson in moral obligation, in the inviolate supremacy of compassion as a guiding principle in the pursuit of justice, in the false aspects of presentation, and how the truth is often more concealed, and deeper, and more profound than you are capable of imagining.

I cannot recommend this film highly enough. It is comparable to Shakespeare in its depth, scope, and elegance. A true classic.",1218499200,3,2956,5.113871635610766
612133,5,6303261736,"""Rage when FOCUSED on a Single purpose is a very powerful weapon...""

HARAKIRI (1962) (aka. Seppuku) is the award-winning film from Masaki Kobayashi (Samurai Rebellion, Kwaidan) and has been pronounced as Kobayashi's masterpiece by his mentor Kinoshita and as one of the TOP Five Greatest Japanese films ever made. The film was originally titled ""Seppuku"" in Japan which translates into ritual suicide. Western audiences are more familiar with the word Harakiri; Hara means belly and Kiri means cut. The two kanji (Chinese characters)are reversed to form ""Seppuku"" a more formal term. In the full ritual, the samurai would cut his belly open and then the ""shakunin"" (second) would behead him. During the Tokugawa period, the Shogunate ordered quite a large number of lords to commit ""seppuku"" to curb the number of Daimyos to avert disorder and possible challenges to the rule.

1630. Following the collapse of his clan, unemployed samurai Hanshiro Tsugumo (Tatsuya Nakadai) arrives at the manor of Lord Iyi, begging to be allowed to commit ritual suicide on his property. Iyi's clansmen, believing the desperate ronin is merely angling for charity, tells Tsugumo the tale of another samurai who they forced to commit Seppuku after they had determined that his intentions were only for show. The Iyi clan have greatly underestimated Tsugumo's honor and his past--who is this stranger and what does he really want?

An empty suit of samurai armor opens and closes the film, it represents the samurai of old as an active warrior  who fights for his Daimyo who after the Tokugawa era is reduced as a wandering Ronin. While it has all these connotations; Harakiri's focus is its emptiness. For this film is a scathing, devastating indictment of the hollowness and hypocrisy of the way of Bushido, the warrior's code. The colliding characteristics of giri (the duty to Bushido) and ninjo (human feelings, compassion and conscience) are the central themes that Kobayashi has incorporated into his film. If you saw his ""The Human Condition"" trilogy, the director was highly critical of the Japanese martial condition; whether in the olden samurai traditions or in the modern Japanese army. Kobayashi's thesis expresses that such systems are inhumane and such inhumanity are only hidden behind such noble sounding rules that are hypocritical and meaningless. Of course, it was extremely easy to see which side the filmmaker comes down on. Kobayashi's rebellious themes portrays the samurai code as superficial, that after all the rules and supposed nobility exuded by retainers; he delves into the rotten core of the system that reveals naught but cowardice among certain clansmen.

Kobayashi's direction is flawless; the film depicts its social themes through allegory. He is more an expressionist than a realist. The contrasts of black and white depicted by Tsugumo's black kimono against the white matted platform on which he tells his tale, represents the Iyi clan's intransigence. Kobayashi sets the mood for the film successfully as the lead character unveils his tale, the proceedings are extremely intense and immersive. I have never been so engaged in a film as much as I've been with ""Harakiri"". Even during that time, Kobayashi exhibits excellent film techniques. He uses the widescreen format with such skill that signifies the endless horizontality of the feudal period. Kobayashi's frames and cuts are examples of more a modern film style that solidly defies the rituals of the past; that expresses his stance that society mustn't be destructive in the face of authoritarian power and that such things, however may seem permanent, is not invincible to the ""rivers"" of change.

It was no accident that Kobayashi had picked Tatsuya Nakadai as the lead. Kobayashi chose him because during that time, the actor had embodied postwar individualism and youthful culture as an actor of modern Shingeki. Nakadai has a very clear enunciation and a powerful deep speaking voice that expresses all the emotional aspects of his character. With almost an uncanny quality, the actor expresses his soul with his body movement, facial mannerisms on behalf of the outworn notion of samurai dignity. Also worth mentioning is the performance of Rentaro Mikuni as the clan elder, Kageyu Saito. His performance has the outward appearance of an individual so engaged and committed in the system, that while he sees what is happening he is so dedicated that he incapable of doing the right thing. Another very human flaw is shown, indifference and that some individuals are so used to their ways that they would do anything to prolong it.

While Kobayashi's masterpiece is so gripping and truly engaging, the film also has its share of realistic swordplay that contains a lot of violent intensity and visceral attitude, that almost look like a ""Ballet"" of eventual destruction. The dialogue by Shinobu Hashimoto (Samurai assassin) in the hands of Kobayashi, becomes a meditative, brooding play that creates an intimidating aura that is very menacing and that exudes the strong hand of fate as an inevitable doom. Strong and powerful with its expressions, Tsugumo`s disrespectful treatment of the empty armor was meant to express pure disgust of such pretentious nobility and cowardice in the Iyi clan. This film truly hurts and quite painful in its expressions of social and political ways.

Dark, moody and gripping, Harakiri remains as a perfect example of excellent Japanese filmmaking. It is a very POWERFUL expression of Masaki Kobayashi's beliefs that human feelings and consideration must take precedence to superficial rules and beliefs that merely beautifies the surface. It is a vibrant depiction that Injustice must be confronted with unrelenting force and single-minded purpose that is worth sacrificing one's life for.

HIGHEST POSSIBLE RECOMMENDATION! [5+ Stars]",1212796800,7,5858,5.25
612134,5,6303261736,"This film was released around the same time (1962) as Kurosawa's ""Sanjuro,"" the sequel to ""Yojimbo"" from the previous year.  Being a Kurosawa fan from way back and wishing to see more of his classic films, Netflix recommended this one to me as well, so I gave it a whirl.

I'm glad to say I was not disappointed in the least.  While Kobayashi's directorial methods are different from Kurosawa's, he ultimately delivers a payoff every bit as dramatic and satisfying as those Kurosawa was known to deliver.  ""Hara-Kiri"" is ultimately heartbreaking and, like Kurosawa, Kobayashi does not shy away from showing the darker aspects of feudal Japan.  Tatsuya Nakadai (who has also worked extensively with Akira Kurosawa on such films as ""Throne of Blood,"" ""Kagemusha"" and ""Ran"") plays a middle-aged samurai in the early Tokugawa period who is down on his luck and offers himself to the house of a powerful shogun to commit ritual suicide in the only honourable manner left to thousands of dispossessed samurai of the time.  The shogun lord doubts his intention, as apparently many other samurai have come before him seeking a handout, and tells him as much.  He soon finds out that his son-in-law, a younger warrior, came seeking the same destiny some time earlier; what follows is a wrenching look at desperation and revenge.

612135,5,6303261736,"This just might my be my favorite samurai film of all time and one of the best I've ever seen. Harakiri is based during the Edo period around the early 1600's. A man named Hanshiro Tsugumo apears infront of the house of Kageyu Saito to commit Harakiri, also known as seppuku, which is the Japanese ritual for suicide. To discourage Hanshiro from doing so, Kageyu Saito tells the story of another samurai, Motome Chijiiwa.  Moteme is actually Tsugumo's son-in-law, he tells the story of how hard the struggle has been in the past months for the poverty stricken family. While watching this retelling you start to understand how hard it was for this mans family.

Tsugumo's friend, also a samurai committed seppuku and left Tsugumo to look after his son. It turns out that his son was Motome Chijiiwa. While looking after Chijiiwa and also his own daughter Miho, Hanshiro is unable to choose the ""honorable"" way to end his life so he has to live in poverty and work degrading jobs in order to support his family. When the children got older Tsugumo wanted his daughter to marry Motome. Motome wanted to but didn't think he could support anyone else in such hard times. The two ended up getting married and having a child. As the story goes on and Tsugumo keeps talking you and the samurai start to realize what's really going on but you'll have to watch to find out.

One of my greatest concerns with a film made long ago is the quality of the picture and sound and both are as good as you are gonna get them but it's decent. Everything else is perfect; this film has some of the best samurai action scenes you'll see. Tatsuya Nakadai is amazing making this film feel real, like he was actually a samurai and this character. The way the story builds up suspense is perfect; it grabs you in more and more as it goes by. First Tsugumo's telling this heartbreaking sad story and then his story gets faster. More action is added with revenge and courage. It's filmed in a stylish and realistic beginning, middle, and certainly the end. This is an amazing movie that can never be touched, anyone who loves samurai films I would definitely recommend this for you.",1182902400,21,2155,4.577720207253886

612137,5,6303261736,"I've said it once about another movie, incidentally by the other great Japanese director as well and I want to repeat my words in regard to ""Harakiri"": ""There are good, very good, and even great movies. But among them there are just a few that go beyond great. They belong to the league of their own"". Masaki Kobayashi's ""Harakiri"" aka ""Seppuku"" is one of them. The film of rare power and humanism, of highest artistic achievements, profoundly moving, tragic like the best Shakespeare's plays, universal and timeless even if it takes place in the faraway country of 1630, by the words of one of the reviewers ""Harakiri"" ""is to cinema as the Sistine Chapel is to painting. Unsurpassable!""

The film grabbed me from the very first shot, from its opening credits with their perfect harmony of kanji (I believe it is correct word to describe the writings) characters, with the unusual disturbing score and with the dark beauty of the images. And then the story begins that centers on Hanshiro Tsugumo (Tatsuya Nakadai), one of hundreds or maybe even thousands unemployed lord less samurais, ronin, that in the blessed times of peace had not many choices to adjust to new life and often preferred to commit a ritual suicide, hara-kiri or seppuku on the property  of the wealthy estate owners. According to Bushido, the way of the samurai, ""One who is a samurai must before all things keep constantly in mind, by day and by night . . . the fact that he has to die. That is his chief business.""

At the same time, samurai and anti-samurai film, ""Harakiri"" offers the masterfully screened scenes of swordfights, not plentiful but exquisitely choreographed, perfectly paced and unbearably intense but the film is much more than that. It is also a gripping court drama where the truth is unfolded in the flashbacks.  The viewers are allowed to look closer at the noble Samurai code of behavior and to reflect on how its abuse impacts the fate of an individual and the society in general. Compelling, poetic, and tragic, the movie has one of the most pessimistic endings ever that makes you wonder how the history is made, how the historical events are interpreted and who decides what would be written in the chronicles and important documents and what would be left out.

A Masterpiece, one of the best movies ever made, ""Harakiri"" deserves all its praise. It is not in my nature to force my opinion on anyone but if you call yourself a movie buff or a movie lover, you MUST see this film.

612139,5,6303261736,"""Hara-Kiri,"" is an absolute classic. It is also one of the 3 greatest [if not greatest] Samurai films of all time. Not only is this a great Samurai film, it is also an outstanding drama. In fact, director Masaki Kobayashi stated that this film was more of an anti-samurai film, and he is correct. I must tread very carefully with this review, as to write too much of this film will destroy it for those of you who have not had the opportunity to see this MASTERPIECE of cinema. Directed by Masaki Kobayashi, the film deals with ONE individuals attack against the corruption and arrogance of the state. And in particular, one clan known as the House of Iyi, which is representative of the new unified state of Japan.

This is one of those films that transcends borders and nationalities--for it is universal. By this I mean that the films main protagonist, Hanshiro Tsugomo (Tatsuya Nakadai) represents the individual against the powers that be who are in charge. And in Hara-kiri, Hanshiro is about to give this House of Iyi a costly lesson in humility, with a touch of vengeance thrown in--that this clan's own arrogance has brought upon themselves. The period that this film takes place is circa 1630: not too long after Lord Tokugawa has established the Shogunate as the supreme power in the now unified Japan.

However, unification comes with a price. In order to consolidate his power, Tokugawa has purged many of the clans spread throughout Japan of their status. Therefore, many clans begin to fold up, and their Samurai must eke out a living within the confines of a profession befitting a samurai. This was very difficult to do, as farming was not acceptable to their Bushido code. Therefore, many of these former samurai found themselves starving since there were very few occupations they were allowed to do. The now masterless samurai are referred to as Ronin. Without the clan, and near starvation, many samurai wandered the country in search of work with another clan in the hopes of securing employment.

Yet, with so many ronin roaming the country, and many clans now purged by Tokugawa, work was a near impossibility. Which brings us to our main protagonist in the film: Hanshiro Tsugumo (Tatsuya Nakadai) in his most celebrated role to date. The films narrative begins with Hanshiro Tsugumo coming to the gates of the House of Iyi. Hanshiro Tsugumo is a proud man, yet something has occurred recently that brings him to this particular clan which boasts of its honor and courage. He has asked for permission to commit Hara-kiri in the courtyard of this House. It is here that the Counselor of this clan, Kageyu Saito (Rentaro Mikuni) proceeds to tell Hanshiro Tsugomo of another samurai who also wanted to commit Hara-kiri in this courtyard.

But there is something very different about this ronin Hanshiro Tsugumo. As the Counselor relates his story of this other ronin, Hanshiro listens intently---for Hanshiro too has a story to relate to this Counselor in charge of the House of Iyi. Hanshiro has not just come to this clan to commit Hara-kiri, there are more profound reasons why he has come to this House. And it is here that film begins with the telling of a story of poverty and sadness which has occurred in Hanshiro's life. Hanshiro Tsugumo has come to the manor of the house of Lord Iyi, not only to seek permission of this Counselor to commit Hara-kiri on this clans property, but to lecture this clan.....and WOW, how he lectures them.

The Counselor of the Iyi clan, Kageyu Saito, is in charge--as the Lord of this Domain is away on business. And it is here that Hanshiro Tsugumo recounts a tale to this Counselor on the fate of his beloved son-in-law, daughter and grandson. You can sense the resentment of Hanshiro Tsugumo as he sees the hypocrisy of those around him. Hanshiro understands that the Bushido code, like the samurai, have changed. And with this, the film builds to an ever greater climax. I don't wish to spoil this film for you, so I will not go any further, other than to write that this film belongs in EVERY cinema lovers collection.

Whether you like samurai, or foreign films in general, this film is POWERFUL. I have seen this film more times on the big screen, and video, than any other I have seen. And I NEVER tire of viewing the film. This is a MASTERPIECE of a film. As a warning to viewers who have not seen this film--DO NOT view the Donald Richie interview in the beginning of the film, as he gives away important parts of the film. Also, there is a terrific booklet that comes with this film, and you should read it---but only after you have seen the film. Once more, this is one of the GREATEST films in cinema. And it is one of my personal favorites. The film is a must see. Highly, highly recommended. [Stars: 5 plus infinity]",1167609600,84,4793,4.68646080760095

612194,5,6303261736,"Harakiri deals with the samurai in Japan in 1630.  The Tokugawa shogunate is in control in Japan a several families have been removed from power.  Because of this, many samurai have been forced to become ronin because of how peaceful Japan is.  These ronin are doing anything to survive.  Including going to the families in power and asking to commit ritual suicide (seppuku, better known in western cultures as hara-kiri) in hopes of being offered a minor job or some money to hold them over for a few days.

In this film, Hanshiro Tsugumo (played by Tatsuya Nakadai) is a ronin who arrives at the Iyi house requesting permission to commit ritual suicide in their house.  The Iyi clan has a strong dislike of the growing number of ronin making this request try to persuade Hanshiro from doing this.  This film tells the tale of a previous ronin who requested to committed seppuku at the Iyi facility and how the Iyi clan handled it.  Once this is completed, Hanshiro tells his reasons for wishing to commit seppuku at their facility.

The movie is fresh, exciting, and strongly told.  The opening is a little slow, but that's to set things up and to permit you to learn the situation.  The plot takes several twists that aren't readily noticeable.  Kobayashi's story telling is as good as Kurosawa's in his better movies.  Tatsuya Nakadai's performance compares very favorably to Toshiro Mifune's performance in Yojimbo.  The rondori scene is fabulous!  Because of the strength of the acting and story telling, I give this a strong 5 stars!",1157414400,4,1541,4.806083650190114
612195,5,6303261736,"The samurai code as everyone who has some acquaintance with Japanese culture knows is a severe code in which ritual suicide called hara kiri is the mainly the punishment or even expiation for any kind of dishonor.  Numerous examples of this ritual suicide were taken note of by so many Allies during the last World War.  In this wonderful, yet unsung masterpiece of a movie we see two terribly tragic examples of hara kiri, or seppuku as one hears it referred to in the movie.  The last one is a daring, yet strangely just and convincing way of sending a message to the unjust.  The first is the one which is the cause of the great buildup to a very dramatic fight scene and the last example of hara kiri.

The problem begins when a certain young samurai looking for employment is inextricably caught in a web of misunderstandings concerning honor.  He presents himself as someone who wishes to commit hara kiri merely as a pretext to join a clan.  Despite his positive outlook and tell tale signs he may join he is taken up on his offer by the chief of the clan.  He has no intention of following through with this offer, nevertheless he is forced into committing seppuku with a bamboo sword -- a truly heart-wrenching scene!

Now all of the above-mentioned is told from the point of view of the clan chief who ordered the swordless samurai to commit ritual suicide as he is speaking with another ronin who interestingly enough is the father in law of the young samurai who had been forced to kill himself with a bamboo sword.

The father in law a very unsung, yet wily samurai recounts his own tale and what led to his son in laws unfortunate end.  The movie from this point is clinching because of the tension now stirred between arrogant and cruel samurai daimyo and the ronin that has come to ""discuss"" the issue once more.

This is the whole crux of the story.  The arrogance and complete lack of pity on the less fortunate is the problem; and such an honor as bushido has caused it.  A family trying to save its honor, or image, deals a cruel blow to a poor aspirant and feels no pains of conscience because of it.  Is that honor?

As the story leads to its bloody climax the daring father in law reveals that he has taken the top-knot of three samurai who directly handled his son's execution.  From there he proceeds to take on his own method of hari kari by creating havoc in the midst of the guilty and returning the pain that was caused by such a cruel system of thought.

The film brings the ultimate question: what is real honor?  It is the ability to stand and fight for what is truly just instead of taking on the hard facade of honor which is merely punishing those who are not as strong or as proud as you are.  This movie unsung as it is has been from the moment I finished my first viewing will always remain as a counter beacon, if you will, against all types of fraternities which hold only pride and strength as its mottos and not justice.",1155168000,7,2962,4.3901098901098905
612196,5,6303261736,"Some good reviews and good attempts to summarize the plot. I urge that no one be put off by the anticipation that it will be confusing or overly complex. The story is told largely in flashback, and somewhat out of sequence, but it makes perfect sense to tell it that way, somehow. It is in no way hard to follow, and the exposition unfolds perfectly.

This movie is very strongly made up of Japanese cultural influences and history, yet the themes and underlying conflicts are universal. This is a human drama, told through strong empathetic characters. Hanshiro is one of the most admirable characters I have ever seen depicted...from his (anecdotal) heroism at Sekigahara, his honorable action when the clan is disbanded, raising his son, to whom he exhibits great love and loyalty, to the fact that when reduced to making umbrellas, he seems to be a painstaking and diligent craftsman. AND he gets to be a doting grandpa, babytalking and mugging to his little grandson.

Then when he has lost it all, he acts, again, with honor, in the only way left to him. Much is made of Kobayashi's undeniable attacks on authoritarianism, but it is also undeniable that to the end Hanshiro is the MOST honorable and the MOST true to the ideals bushido would have an individual uphold. The failure of bushido, as with any system of ideals, is in the imperfect humans who try (or do not) to uphold them, not necessarily in the ideals themselves.

This is a wonderful film, beautifully composed and well-acted. The actor portraying the Chamberlain does a fine job, in particular. Hanshiro's rebellion is directed fully at him, and in the end, it is difficult to tell what effect the exposure of so many dishonorable actions has had on him.

SPOILER!!! (as if you don't already know...)

One thing that has been little mentioned is the bleakness of the ending...in the end, the scribe notes only that on that date, one samurai committed honorable bushido in the House of Iyi, and a large number of retainers died of illness. Indeed, the narrator records that publically, the Iyi clan got away with everything, covering up the truth. The last shot, of the armor restored, soulless and imposing, is chilling. The more so noting the date of the action was 1630, and the code and society that drove Hanshiro to his desparate action was to continue for over two centuries.",1153180800,9,2353,4.771498771498772

The rules and nothing more the rules, when the pretended and always well prominent honor sense has to face against a ethic crossroad that will arise a mythical revenge.

I am absolutely convinced there has not been until this date any other film that had narrated with such crudeness a moral dilemma like this one. The mystery will be increasing and the generated violence alike the seminal roots of the Greek tragedy is a way and not a task by itself. The cathartic experience will surround you at the end of the film.

The dramatic parallelism between our tragic hero raiding in the Holy Room and demolishing the symbol and Achilles outrage destroying Apollo statue is breathtaking.

Masaki Kobayashi (Kwaidan) built a bravura script, a cinematographic avalanche of violent outburst of historical resonance in the universal cinema.

612199,5,6303261736,"Every so often someone asks me, what is the best film ever made.
My answer to this common question - Director Kobayashi's film Harakiri.  This film is beautiful, powerful, poetic, unforgetable.  It is a samurai film, not an epic, about the meaning of justice, compassion, and humanity. Although there is very little action of the type that one expects in Samurai dramas, the tension mounts to an explosive climax.  Every gesture, every sound reinforces the themes of the film.  This movie is to cinema as the Sistine Chapel is to painting. Unsurpassable!",1138060800,11,554,4.989130434782608
612200,5,6303261736,"The story has everything in it, including tragedy and dark humor. The main theme is revenge, but also apotheosis: a Samurai breaking with the definition of his life to be true to his inner self. He calls the Samurai code a ""facade"", and then proves it by kicking butt in the most realistic one-man stand I have ever enjoyed in movies. This film has the most realistically correographed sword fights I have ever seen. None of the fashionable flashing swords and furious (jiggly) camera work that typifies filmed sword fights, especially in recent years. Even in 1962, this was a uniquely faithful depiction of kendo - the discipline of the ""perfect cut."" The fighters like to stay well out of range until they can attack or counter attack without getting hurt! ""No duh."" But how many movies really show this natural caution in fighters? No others that I can think of off-hand.

This masterpiece blows away Kurosawa's stuff, which I also enjoy a great deal. Harakiri is just as artfully done, both the cinematography and the direction, but it is far more realistic visually. (I am glad it was in black and white!) It is very tight and fast-paced, despite a lot of scenes where people are just looking at each other and talking. I wish more films were this balanced, instead of the steady move toward more gratuitous action and less drama that feels connected to real life.

The characters are alien in the way they act, to American eyes, but their emotions are completely reachable. Harakiri is a perfect reminder of why I enjoy foreign film so much: it puts me in touch with humanity from another place and time. And being in touch, I know that we are at the core always the same. Tradtion and culture do not change our emotions or desires for happiness. And family lies at the very center of achieving it, or becoming so grief stricken that we welcome death.

(A technical observation about correography of sword duels in films: this film has the right feel about what we see. I think that depicting a sword and shield duel in Viking Iceland would, if authentically portrayed, show the same thing: a lot of long range circling and feinting, with constant eye contact, and a few bursts of attack and reaction.)",1132704000,8,2209,4.688144329896907
612241,5,6303261736,"Bushido, the way of the samurai, in theory, provides a noble idea, but like all ideas, some change to fit personal goals and agendas.  Derived from four major philosophical and spiritual sources (Buddhism, Confucianism, Shintoism, and Zen) the samurai generated the Bushido, as the samurai had to be fearless, enlightened, and reflective while displaying both compassion and self-control.  The samurai sought the true way to become the ultimate warrior where he displayed respect and reverence for both friend and foe.  For centuries, the samurai had sought an inner path to enlightenment, righteousness, and dexterity while serving a clan with their skills in swordsmanship.  Here Masaki Kobayashi, a proponent against authoritarian power, directs a samurai tale that illustrates how the concept of the Bushido transforms into a self-serving design.

In the year 1630, the island that now goes under its native name, Nippon, also known as Japan to westerners, was only in its beginning of the Tokugawa shogunate, which lasted for some 250 years.  The major difference with the Tokugawa compared to previous military leaders was that they unified their powers while exterminating smaller and less prosperous clans.  It left numerous samurai without masters, as they had to drift into an unemployed existence also known as ronin.  In Harakiri, known as Seppuku, in Japan, the audience learns about the socioeconomic and political changes that a ronin faced after the loss of a position while suffering from poverty and hunger.  This story is set within the walls of the Iyi clan's stronghold.  The audience should also know that the Iyi clan was a supporter of the Tokugawa shogunate.

Images of the Iyi clan's traditional armor open the film with a hauntingly stark presence, as the dark background contrasts the armor while fog drifts aimlessly around the armor.  Analogously, the opening imagery presents a notion of a dark, resistive, and hollow presence, as no human fills the armor.  It also provides the impression of lacking compassion while this clan's symbol represents the clan's merciless power and might.  Eventually, the imagery forcefully fades into reality where it sits on the clan's high seat overlooking the clan and its fiefdom.

Out of the Iyi clan's log, a narration informs the viewer about a samurai and former retainer of the Fukashima Clan that arrives to the Iyi clan's grounds, which brings the audience back in time through a flashback.  This man is Hanshiro Tsugumo (Tatsuya Nakadai). Hanshiro requests to use the Iyi clan's forecourt of the Iyi's stronghold for a ritual suicide (harakiri) where the samurai cuts open his own abdomen in order to uphold his honor.  Before the clan approves of his request, the senior counselor of the house of Iyi, Kageyu Saito (Rentaro Mikuni) meets with him.  In his meeting, Kageyu informs Hanshiro about a recent incident where another man arrived who made a similar request.  Together with Hanshiro the audience learns that other ronin have made the same request in the hope of obtaining a position, or getting a little money.  However, the Iyi clan does not deviate, as they will make sure that the ronin executes harakiri by following the rules of Bushido.  The story does not deter Hanshiro who remains steadfast in his decision of performing harakiri.

Well spread hearsay has reached Hanshiro's ears that the Iyi clan possesses a number of terrific swordsmen, as he requests one to be his assistant.  The assistant's sword skills will serve the purpose of decapitated the Hanshiro's head when the pain of gutting himself becomes too painful, which in a way helps save face, no pun intended.  However, none of the men that he requests are present, as they all are absent for the day due to illness.  Yet, Hanshiro requests one of these men, as he wants the job done properly.  Consequently, Kageyu sends for them, and while they wait Hanshiro begins to share his life story for Kageyu and the present samurai.  Hanshiro's story is a perplexing and mesmerizing tale that will pull the audience in several unexpected directions, as director Kobayashi portrays a strong criticism of authoritarian rule of Iyi clan and their abuse of the Bushido.

Kobayashi's vision does not only reflect of historical incidents several centuries ago, but also, he freely criticizes the abusiveness of despotic power which shows complete disregard for the individual.  This is something he personally experienced as a private, even though he was offered an officer position, in World War II, a war he referred to as, ""the culmination of human evil.""  Now less than two decades after the war, Kobayashi ironically sets the tale during the Tokugawa shogunate, which we now know exists no more.  This knowledge serves an intentional reminder that despotic rule never lasts, as people eventually will always overcome the oppressiveness, as they did after World War II.  In regards to the aftermath of both World War II and the Tokugawa shogunate, Kobayashi points out that the individuals of the lower socioeconomic levels suffer far worse than those in power, as those in power always find away to bend the rules to their favor.

Harakiri offers much more than mere sword fight, as Kobayashi allows the audience to reflect over the social application of the Bushido and the abuse of the samurai code.  In addition, Kobayashi playfully applies masterful symbolism that intentionally criticizes the political perspective of totalitarian rule in a jidaigeki (also known as chambara, or sword fight in a period film that takes place between 1600 and 1868.)  This is why Harakiri emerges as one of the bewildering cinematic masterpieces that compares with Rashmon (1950), with its mysterious element, and Seven Samurai (1954) by Kurosawa and Miyamoto Musashi's samurai trilogy with its social impact in the shadow of Bushido.  Lastly, through the combination of brilliant camerawork, a clever script, and terrific performances by the cast all are come together under Kobayashi's skillful direction that leaves the viewers with a lasting and truly amazing cinematic experience.",1128816000,13,6120,5.171399594320487

612244,5,6303261736,"What a haunting, searing film. It is my favorite film, of all genres including modern. And I do watch a lot of films.

The film was made in 1962 and it features people who lived in 17th century Japan. And yet here we are in the 21st century, still discussing the still-relevant issues that the film raises, and also the compelling, human people who are shown in the film.

The film starts calmly, with Tsugumo Hanshiro (masterfully played by Nakadai Tatsuya), a middle-aged ronin who once served a clan that has been abolished by the Shogunate, appearing at the gate of the Edo headquarters of the Ii clan.  He requests a spot within their mansion to commit seppuku, as he no longer wishes to live in the extreme poverty that he has lived in for the past years.

In the course of the film, details are given about 17th century Japanese history and society, so that a viewer does not have to have studied extensively to know of the situations confronting the characters. To sum up: thousands of samurai retainers had been thrown out of their positions, made into lordless ronin, by the wholesale abolishing of clans by the bakufu government. In the rigid class system (samurai, farmers, artisans, merchants) that had been set up by the bakufu after the Tokugawa shoguns had established their reign, these displaced ex-retainers had no place at all; they were forced into marginal modes of subsistance -- either as outlaws or into very low-paying teaching or artisan trades.

The film unfolds after its stark beginning. In his inner headquarters, Saito Kageyu (Mikuni Rentaro), the chief retainer of the Ii clan, bemoans the fact that hordes of starving ronin have been making similar requests at various clan gates; most have wanted handouts rather than to actually commit seppuku, and Kageyu suspects the same of Hanshiro. But he agrees to meet with him.

Kageyu attempts to discourage Hanshiro with a tale of another ronin, a younger man from the same abolished clan, Chijiiwa Motome (played poignantly by Ishihama Akira). Motome had appeared at the clan's gate a few months earlier, requesting to commit seppuku for the same reasons. Kageyu reveals to Hanshiro that this younger man had been discovered to be carrying sword blades of bamboo (he had pawned his real swords) and tells of the outrage that his clan members had felt when a man requests to commit seppuku but does not possess the weapon for carrying out this request (a wakizashi made of metal, not bamboo) -- so it had been obvious to the Ii clansmen that Motome had wanted to extort the clan for a handout and had no intention of committing seppuku. So as an example to other scrounging, poor ronin, particularly those who don't carry real blades, the Ii clan members had decided to make an example of Motome. They had forced him to commit seppuku with his own bamboo wakizashi.

What happens following Kageyu's tale told to Hanshiro will tear your heart and drive you to view the film over and over. The story proceeds onward, toward its inevitable end, playing out like the best of Greek or Shakespearian tragedy.",1123804800,8,3081,4.80188679245283
612245,5,6303261736,"""Hara Kiri"" is directly translated as ""belly cutting,"" and is the name best known in the West for Seppuku, a traditional act of suicide that was considered an honorable method of death amongst the Samurai of medieval Japan.  To die by Seppuku was a privilege reserved for honorable men, and was formal and ritualized as is common in Japanese tradition.  It was an extremely painful way to die, and required absolute will and self-control.

Kobayashi Masaki (""Kwaidan,"" ""Samurai Rebellion""), a master director of Samurai films,  uses this ritual as the focus of his film ""Hara Kiri"" (Japanese title ""Seppuku."")  The stage is set in the late Tokugawa period, a time when centuries of peace had rendered the warrior class moot, and Samurai without a rich lord to serve had nothing but their honor to sustain themselves.  Forbidden by law, culture and training to seek their substance through less-honorable means such as farming or trade, the lordless Samurai were expected to starve and die with no word of complaint.  One day, a hungry Samurai by the name of Hanshiro Tsugumo arrives at the gate of a local lord, requesting permission to perform Seppuku and end his suffering poverty through honorable means.  And then the true story unfolds.

Probably his greatest film, Kobayashi dissects what it is to be ""honorable,"" and who is the true possessor of this abstract concept.  The rigid code of the Samurai is symbolized through the relentless use of straight lines, as hard and unyielding as the swords which are the supposed soul of a Samurai.  The code has long outlived its usefulness, and is a contradiction in the world of peace.  Both the code and the men are dinosaurs, needing to either change or die.

Hanshiro Tsugumo is played by the legendary Nakadai Tatsuya (""Sword of Doom,"" ""Yojimbo"").  He is incredible as Hanshiro, being both the ultimate Samurai ideal and at the same time one who's wisdom and compassion far surpasses those who  speak of ""honor,"" relaxing comfortably behind their money and position.  Hanshiro's surface is one of acceptance and resolve, a man who has accepted his fate, but underneath is rage and righteous action, hidden and waiting to explode.

The pacing is typical of a Kobayashi film, and follows his pattern of a slow, slow build up that explodes with a violent and unexpected climax.  ""Hara Kiri,"" like other Kobayashi films, is a slow fuse leading to a large bomb.  Hanshiro's story is complex, and he unfolds it delicately, so that all points are clear to the Lord and his men, as well as the viewers.

Criterion has recognized both the importance and the excellence of ""Hara Kiri,"" and put forth a DVD worthy of the film.  Aside from a beautiful transfer and improved English subtitles, they have assembled video interview with Nakadai Tatsuya and scriptwriter Hashimoto Shinobu, as well as an introduction by Japanese-film expert Donald Richie.  In print, there is an essay by film scholar Joan Mellen and a re-print of her Kobayashi interview.

612247,3,6303261736,"Kobayashi's film features (at least) three depictions of samurai ritual suicide practice (hara-kiri --> properly called seppuku); originally, I viewed part of this film for a Japanese Civilization class -- and the film is rich in detail.  Like the recent 2002 film ""Twilight Samurai"", ""Harakiri"" shows that life as a samurai was not as glorious and idealistic as one might expect from a Kurosawa movie (not to diss Kurosawa).  It is not as gritty as ""Twilight"" and instead artfully weaves in-and-out of a series of narratives (not unlike Kurosawa's ""Rashomon"").  ""Harakiri"" is less about samurai sword action and more about talking.  Samurai fanboy:  buyer beware.

The movie hinges on the defintion and re-definition of samurai honor.  Like the ""Lone Wolf and Cub"" franchise, it has a cynical view on what the Tokugawa shogunate did for Japan.  We see the dark world of samurai bureaucracy and the cover-ups (where are the black helicopters?) involved in maintaining the myth of the samurai:  who suffers and who profits from it?

One thing to note:  the film takes place in the first half of the 17th century; Tokugawa's shogunate has made the samurai's role more of an ideal than a practice.  Ritual suicide was originally performed in the previous Warring States period (16th century) to cut open one's belly, pull out the guts and show one's anger (the guts) to  one's opponent:  though beaten in battle, the samurai is allowed to display his warrior resolve and discipline.  By the time of the film, this anti-authority display is curtailed and it's abbreviated into a short routine of making the gesture so the executioner can cut off one's head bringing the ritual to quick close.  Nakadai Tatsuya, the main character in the film, makes his ritual suicide as long as possible perhaps for this reason -- to painfully display his contempt for his enemies.  Thankfully, we see less of his intestines --we get the contempt through his stories and mocking laughter.

A curious film indeed.  3 stars (the film is a bit long and the middle/end pacing cannot match its incredibly well constructed 1st third).",1115769600,8,2108,4.988538681948424

(Forget the cheap eulogy of samurai-death in the recent Last Samurai.)
 This is a film-making elevated to the realm of art. The serenity of a Noh play and the theatrical panache of Kabuki are combined to create this absolutely engrossing masterpiece. This is arguably the finest Japanese film ever made. It is perverse that this work, perhaps outshodowed by numerous Kurosawa films, is almost never talked about in Japan.

I was not disappointed. This is a rare film that succeeds on all levels, as a character study, as pure cinema, as a social commentary, and as one hell of great story.
This is one of the most intense films ever made, despite the fact that the basic narrative unfolds in one spot, the courtyard of a Japanese estate, with the characters arranged in nearly ritual tableau. The tension builds almost unbearably as the retainers--a squalid crew hiding a casual sadism behind the bushido code--realize who the vagabond ronin in their hands is, and begin to grasp what he's there for. The climax, one of the finest examples of Japanese swordsmanship ever filmed, fulfills the film on each level of execution, with the 'samurai's' dishonor rendered complete as they call for guns to defeat the intruder. I was as shaken seeing the complete film as I'd been thirty years before.
This is Nakadai's finest performance in a long and distinguished career, a tour de force of naturalist minimal acting. As in most Japanese films, the camera work and cinematography are magnificent, carried out on a level only rarely achieved in other countries. The transfer is excellent, made from a first-class print. Why this film (along with most of the Japanese cinematic canon) isn't on DVD I'll never know.

The established, codified order, with all its smoke and mirrors, must be preserved at all costs, and nothing must be allowed to come in its way. It is the duty of each member of any government, organization, church, or brotherhood not to spare any effort and to go to any length to protect the appearances and status quo, to achieve this essential goal of survival. The end justifies the means, and no lie or deceit can be eliminated if this survival is at stake.

In Japan, Seppuku is the formal term for ritual suicide by disembowelment. Harakiri, as it is known in the West, is the common term, which literally means ""stomach cutting."" It was an integral part of bushido, the code of conduct of the samurai warrior class. Seppuku was ordered by a superior as punishment to redeem some offence, or chosen over a dishonorable death at the hands of an enemy. In both cases, it demonstrated the honor, courage, loyalty, and high moral character of the individual. Except when performed on a battlefield, it was a very formal ceremony, requiring certain etiquette, witnesses and considerable preparation.

Harakiri is a particularly painful and rather messy way of ending one's days. In this ritual, the ""performer"" opens his abdomen, starting from left to right and then finishing from top toward bottom. But there is so need to be left for hours contemplating one's entrails. Another swordsman acting as a ""second,"" called kaishakunin, is standing by to decapitate the departing at a pre-arranged moment in the ceremony. Lord Ieyasu Tokugawa, who founded Japan's last great shogunate dynasty in 1603, ordered the practice of harakiri to be discontinued by both secondary and primary retainers. Later on, in 1663, a stronger edict from Lord Nobutsuna Matsudaira of Izu, put an end to the practice altogether. By that time, the ritual had become an idle formalism, and the ""performer"" was decapitated at the instant he took his sword out of the scabbard, thus avoiding a painful death. In some instances, the sword was replaced by a fan.

Hanshiro Tsugomo (Tatsuya Nakadai) comes to the castle of the Iyi Clan to seek revenge for the humiliation and cruel death of his son-in-law, Anjiwa Motome (Akira Ishihama). Kobayashi is a superb storyteller, and in a slow and deliberate rhythm, he develops his story, which could have been taken from the pages of the Iliad or of the Mahabharata. The tension grows, as the Clan members slowly realize that they are in turn being humiliated by this stranger who truly believe in the samurai code of honor: he must be terminated to prevent him to broadcast his truth.

The final duel with the master swordsmen of the Clan, Hikukuro Omodaka, on the Plains of Gojin-in, is like a meditation, a ballet of death. The film ends in a spectacular combat, and the coup de grace to Hanshiro Tsugomo's seppuku is fittingly not applied by a gallant swordsman, but a cowardly platoon of muskets. Even to the end, the samurai honor code has been violated by the Clan.

The screenplay by Shinobu Hashimoto is based on a novel by Yasuhiko Takiguchi. The cinematography, by Yoshio Miyajima, in black and white, is gorgeous. Many on the shots are haiku-like in the imagery. The musical score, written for an ensemble of ancient instruments and percussion by the renowned classical composer Toru Takemitsu, is used sparingly throughout the film. The music speaks as the dialogs sing.

As Toshiro Mifune has long been associated with the success of Kurosawa's films, so are Kogayashi's films enhanced by the brilliant interpretation of Tatsuya Nakadai (also staring in the leading roles in Kurosawa's Kagemusha,and Ran). This outstanding actor contributed further to the success of this director's films, Kwaidan and the Samurai Rebellion.

Although taking place almost five centuries ago during the Tokugawa Shogunate, this film is also a strong denunciation of the entrenched cultural legacy of coercive rituals, blind obedience, and chauvinism that resulted in the tragedy of the Pacific War.",1049760000,9,4305,5.011188811188811
612362,5,6303261736,"After Japan emerged from its civil wars in the early 17th century, many clans were banned by the victorious Tokugawa Shogunate. Thousands of samurai warriors who knew the arts of war but precious little else suddenly found themselves thrown out onto the street.
HARAKIRI tells of the chain of events set into motion when a destitute samurai goes to one of the remaining clans and offers to commit suicide according to the harakiri ritual. His real intent was to get a handout once the Iyi clan elder had seen his determination. This clan, however, had been hit up by other samurai in similar straits. The elder praises him and immediately has him prepare for suicide by disembowelment. When the young samurai requests a delay, the elder insists he begin immediately.
I do not want to ruin the picture for anyone by giving anything away. Some time later (though earlier in the film, which skips around with the chronological story), the young samurai's father-in-law -- also a samurai -- shows up at the gate making the same request. This time the samurai is the redoubtable Tatsuya Nakadai. His intention is revenge, and he damned near lays waste to the entire clan to attain it.
Kobayashi's direction of this elegant wide-screen epic may seem to be stodgy and talky at times, but the tale it tells will curdle the marrow of your bones. There is relatively little swordplay until Nakadai produces three small items from the folds of his kimono resulting in an all-against-one battle royal.
This is one of the greatest of all the samurai films. No Jacobean revenge tragedy by Cyril Tourneur or John Webster can hold a candle to it in its ferocity. Kobayashi's film is Shakespearean in its breadth and holds up well to multiple viewings. This is a letterboxed print, so you see ALL the action.",1022112000,78,1791,4.799352750809062
612363,4,6303261736,"The story begins towards the end. The lead character begins his tale as his so-called end draws near. Slow at first, the story picks up as the tale goes in depth into the psyche of one of the main characters, Chijiiwa, the lead character's son-in-law. As the end draws near,the ex samurai, set to commit harakiri or ritual suicide, states that the house of the current lord is just as hypocritical as certain unemployed samurai; they must maintain a standard yet do not. In the end, Motome Chijiiwa, is avenged by his father-in-law. The movie deals with issues that individuals, families, groups, and corporations do; what is right and what is wrong and where does one cross the line into the other to save face. An excellent movie concerning issues we all deal with near or far, in any language or country, regardless of time or space. The movie would get 4 1/2 stars but they do not have the 1/2 star graphic. My only minor gripe that prevented the 5 stars was the slightly overdrawn sword fight towards the end.",1020816000,5,1014,4.607734806629834

612366,5,6303261736,"While Kurosawa was settling back into commercial comfort, making samurai comedies, Masaki Kobayashi was approaching the genre with more serious intentions.  A ""glorification"" of feudal values was defintitely not Kobayashi's concern, having been a survivor of Imperial Japan's violent and, luckily, abortive bid to dominate Asia.  Kurosawa was too sickly to serve in the Imperial Army, or so the legend goes.  Kobayashi focuses directly on feudalism precisely because he realized that it had never been completely eradicated.  The same values that had driven Japanese soldiers to commit atrocities throughout Asia were still principally intact in postwar Japanese society.  Feudalism was tacitly alive and kicking, and Kobayashi knew just how to expose it.  'Seppuku' (the original title) is a frontal attack on Japanese institutionalized feudalism, as expressed in its inherent cronyism, its stupid adherence to the samurai ethic.  Although the last fifteen minutes of this film are electrifying, wherein a lone, masterless samurai is set against a mob of lesser swordsmen (by now a familiar scenography in Japanese film), it is his selfless revenge on the clan that forced his impoverished son-in-law to commit seppuku with a bamboo short-sword that lays waste to the very root of Japanese feudalism.",970272000,13,1301,5.540404040404041

Some may think that this is an indictment of standards ...  but I think not.  I found it an indictment of hypocrisy.  The  ""lords"" believe they have found a hypocrite ... yet the  father-in-law of this supposed hypocryte is like a mirror revealing the  true hypocrites.

I first watched this movie  in 1973 and immediately was convinced this one is the best Japanese movie  ever made.  Only Akira Kurosawa's movies like Rashomon, etc. can match with  Harakiri's depth and enlightenment.  A  must see  movie, it makes you  think,  and realized that many of the glorified- virtures the society  adores and admires  are actually nothing but sad lies.",943142400,24,712,5.241071428571429
