Two prospectors are camping out and remembering the past. One survived a shooting twelve years ago. His younger brother disappeared at the time. He and Dusty see a man suffering from poisoned water. [Some pools have a high level of arsenic from minerals.] A letter contains information on a wanted murderer. What is Gentry up to? He wants to buy a ranch that has good water. This area is still wild, rustlers abound. Mr. Winters won't sell the land, but do sell cattle. Gentry talks to his boys, he tells them about the money that will go to the bank tomorrow. ""Don't harm the girl."" Miss Winters rides to town unarmed. Two men follow. Can they catch her? Two men fight, one shoots his pistol. Miss Winters is wounded by a stray shot! Those first two men bring her to town to see the doctor, this saves her life.

The doctor called Mr. Winters to tell about his daughter. [$3,000 was a lot of money in those days.] ""Gat Ganns"" meets Gentry, the wanted poster is his introduction. [Fortunate resemblance?] Gentry wants to make a man disappear. Is there something familiar about Butch? Gentry will steal Winters' cattle, then ""Ganns"" will take care of Winters. Gentry will take care of the daughter. A dog scares the horses on a wagon, ""Ganns"" rescues Spud. There is a fight with Butch. Can they warn Winters? Cattle are driven away. Faye reads the warning note. But they can carry through. Gentry tells ""Ganns"" to apply for a job with Winters to follow the stolen herd. It works. They confide in Winters. Spud takes Butch's gun and switches bullets! ""Ganns"" reports to Gentry. Gentry will double-cross ""Ganns"" to collect the reward! Spud warns ""Ganns"" about this. An old letter has important news from Aunt Martha.

The Sheriff is told about this. Gentry takes that poster to Faye and tells about her father. Ted Hayden confronts Gentry. ""Call the Sheriff."" There is fight with Gentry in the Winters home. [Recognize that wooden bridge over the gully?] Gentry escapes through a window and rides away. [A stunt double crashes through another window.] Gentry's men fire at the men who comes out the door. Poetic justice? Will there be a happy future for Faye and Ted?

Aside from the implausibility of some of the story, this is a very good movie. It combines many themes (property, love, revenge) into an interesting drama.",1511481600,,2352,4.7153284671532845
