5181813,5,B008U0XK3G,"This film has Minnie Driver at her best, a charismatic maverick producing a new twist on Shakespeare as a school play. The odd hip-ness of the 70s, the music, the social clashes and colorful sets are rich stuff. Adolescent tantrums and romances occur onstage and off; and are not limited to the adolescents. What a delightful surprise!",1364169600,15,335,4.894736842105263
5181814,5,B008U0XK3G,"We discovered this movie on Amazon and it was great. We loved it. It was funny, heartwarming, charming, and inspiring. Fabulous cast. If you are looking for a good movie, this is it!",1363910400,6,182,4.545454545454546
5181815,4,B008U0XK3G,"Many folks in the 2012 Seattle International Film Festival audience likened this one to ""Glee"" which they have seen on television. As a ""Glee"" virgin, I can't say one way or the other, but this entry from the UK was interesting, involving and sported a few youngsters I'd like to see again. In addition it's directed by Marc Evans (""Snowcake"" and ""Patagonia""), and he's always someone to watch.

We are in 1976 Wales. The UK is in a decline, the Falklands are still in the future, and some high school students are in a funk. An enthusiastic young teacher is inspired to adapt current popular music (David Bowie and The Beach Boys) into an accompaniment for Shakespeare's ""The Tempest,"" using school talent. Many of the students are low income and some of the teachers see that as a sure bet for failure.

Be sure to suspend disbelief before you see:
  * Minnie Driver (""Conviction"") as a fairly non-traditional teacher. She runs a loose ship, but the students seem to learn, although some of us cringed when she shared a cigarette with one of her kids. Remember, it IS 1976 before smoking got such a bad name!
  * Aneurin Barnard (""Citadel"") had me asking, ""Who IS this guy?"" Handsome, capable and talented (he sings), I can promise you, we will see more of this hunk! Oh yeah, he's one of the students and he plays the irresistible Ferdinand.
  * Robert Pugh (""Robin Hood"") is the school principal, enlisted by our teacher to take on the role of Prospero.
  * Haydn Gwynne (Lots of TV) is the teacher we love to hate. She is venomously class conscious, teaches by the book, and hasn't a warm drop of blood in her veins. She brings out the worst in our heroine, AND her students.
  * Tomos Harries in his first role, is a tousle-haired blonde, cast as Ariel. His character has a sweet arc as a lad not quite sure of his sexuality.
  * Darren Evans (""Submarine"") is the angry misfit student cast as the angry misfit Caliban. He is suspected of arson.

Driver is Great Britain's answer to Meryl Streep when it comes to accents. I've heard her speak like a native from Ireland, ""Bahston,"" Appalachia, Detroit, and now Wales. There are many more, but I haven't the space.

To my great delight, at the end they provide ""the rest of the story"" much as they did in ""American Graffiti,"" with history and a touch of humor. Amazon has it in Region 2 only right now, but I have my fingers crossed.",1352505600,,2387,4.529137529137529
5181816,5,B008U0XK3G,"This brilliant film from Wales is set in the long hot summer of 1976, when we had it like the Mediterranean every day for months (except in Ireland where it pelted down and I had to go for a `holiday'). We meet Vivienne May (Minnie Driver) who has returned from a failed career in London to become a teacher at a not so progressive South Wales school. She is one of those teachers who feel you should get more from education than just a tick box mentality to passing exams. And as such she wants to encourage the kids to `express' themselves.

In order to help in this process, she intends to put on the school musical, and she chooses Shakespeare's `The Tempest', but with up to date and `with it' music such as Bowie, Roxy, Music and ELO. I was intrigued straight away especially with a very school like version of `Life on Mars' with a xylophone and jars filled with differing amounts of water - brilliant. Well her efforts are received with mild disfavour to outright hostility. The rugby coach says acting is effeminate and won't let his `boys' take part, the splendid Hayden Gwynn as Mrs Valentine, is a sublime cow in her efforts to undermine Vivienne, who seems to let herself down through being caught at being pally with the kids, smoking, drinking, swearing and getting stoned.

The kids themselves are all played brilliantly especially the lad who plays the only gay in the village/ school. Then there is Davy who has a crush for Miss and more mixed hormones than most of his age, but he can fair belt out a tune. The arrangements and treatments of the songs are all at the high end of excellent especially a fairly obscure Roxy number. They are also rubbish at turning up for dress rehearsal and more akin to bunking off down the Lido than learning their lines. Well as the heat rises, so do the hormones, jealousies and the accusations which will all lead to an inevitable clash, albeit with a load of laughs along the way.

To say I enjoyed this is an understatement akin to saying Stalin might have been a bit naughty, it is just great, funny, human, and entertaining and it's Welsh. This is the best Welsh film since `Twin Town' and I have seen a fair few. Minnie Driver is not only great she is totally lovable and not any of the supporting cast puts in a bad performance. Special mention to the headmaster played by Robert Pugh (`Master and Commander' and `Robin Hood'), he plays the bumbling but kind hearted teacher in a virtuoso performance of under statedness. If you loved the seventies, you will love this, if you love musicals then look no further and if you want to see some life affirming cinema then, with this you have struck gold.",1351296000,13,2661,4.516597510373444

5181838,4,B008U0XK3G,"I liked very much the film's portrayal of a caring teacher with integrity who put her students first in her life. She cared about all the students, and that is what good teachers do! The language and accents were lovely!

Certain aspects of the film are a bit unsettling, however. As a teacher, I disliked her relaxed attitude toward the student who had a crush on her. In spite of my own very structured classroom environment, I appreciate that the film makes a case for a less structured one in the arts, such as drama.

I was a bit confused about the origin of the story. The end of the film tells us what happened to the main characters later in life. Yet the film claims to be fictitious. I could find no sources to support either claim. Was it based on a true story?",1419638400,,772,4.317241379310345

5181840,2,B008U0XK3G,"This film tries to be too many things, and nails none of them in a disjointed story. It attempts to be a musical but has too few songs too poorly done. It touches on teen angst, class warfare, liberalism in the 60's, sexual orientation, bullying, English culture, divorce, race relations and if that wasn't enough it takes a stab a being a character study. It does not succeed in capturing any of those subjects and is oddly paced and jumbled, very difficult to follow. I am a pretty forgiving film lover but this one is hard to like.",1417737600,,534,4.459183673469388

5181844,4,B008U0XK3G,Suspend disbelief and this movie has a nostalgic feel. The story is set in a cleaned up version of 70's Britain (except for some language). The music is some of the better tunes you heard on the radio. The acting is nice and understated. Nice parallel with Shakespeare's Tempest. I would watch it again.,1414540800,,303,4.62962962962963

5181853,4,B008U0XK3G,"This is a very good movie. Minnie Driver is great in it as are the ""kids"" who star in the high school musical. Other adult actors are good, but are portraying stereotypical characters. Once again, like Smash, you are left wishing you could watch the entire musical, as a production of its own, because the staging and singing are really unique and well done.",1408060800,,358,4.609375

5181869,4,B008U0XK3G,"Hunky Dory takes place in the 70's in a working class secondary school in Wales. The trials and tribulations of teens finding themselves take place within the framework of an original musical based on ""The Tempest"". Minnie Driver is young, hip teacher Miss May, who writes and directs the show and takes a personal interest in her students. Mega-talented actor, singer and major looker Aneurin Barnard (Richard III in Starz series ""The White Queen"") is Davy, who is nursing a broken heart after being rejected by his classmate, Stella. Other teen characters are facing crises of one sort or another, and are given believable portrayals by a fine young cast.

While I liked it, I sometimes found it difficult understand some of the dialog due to the Welsh dialect. Also, while the story is about teens putting on a musical, the movie itself is not a musical. Musical numbers are given short shrift until the end, when Davy puts out a rock star worthy performance in the play's finale. (A complete version of the songs should be available on iTunes and/or Amazon.)

5181870,4,B008U0XK3G,"This movie is basically ""High School Musical"" without the antiseptic Disney treatment. The kids are real, working-class teenagers from Wales. The politics is from the Thatcher era and the music from the ""Glam rock"" period.

I never - and I mean never! - turn a movie off in the middle even if I don't really like it much.  THIS was the exception - I simply could not get through it.  Was it Minnie Driver's horrible British accent?  Maybe - that, and all of the above.  Don't waste your time or money on this movie.",1390521600,,381,3.896103896103896
5181872,4,B008U0XK3G,"This is fun and quirky and all that good stuff. For a Londoner, Minnie Driver squares away quite a decent Welsh accent - to my ear, at any rate.  There's a fair bit of the f word in here, so if you're adverse to that, this may not be your cup of tea, but in all other respects, it's winning and heartlifting and all that.  It was sultry that summer instead of raining - even in Wales.  I think they capture the mood and the time rather nicely, but it's not supposed to be taken seriously, is it? I mean it's a musical.  The singing is sweet and there's a fair bit of ohhhh, isn't that luverly, camaraderie. And - and this is a big and - they even manage those what-happened-to-everybody-after-leaving-school snapshot montage things at the end.

The main flaw I could see was trying to cover so many of the young peoples lives made the plot a bit confusing.

If you want something that isn't too deep, or too funny, or too dramatic, or too unique, and you like movies where someone is trying to encourage an openness for art (and I'm a big fan of many forms of art, btw...) then it's possible you might like this movie a lot and worth a try.

I was a couple of years younger than them but could relate to some of the stuff they were going through even though theirs was much more dramatised than my life. The film was great and I loved Minnie Driver and Aneurin Barnards standout performances. I had no trouble with the accents of course, and was disappointed to see people mark down the film because they had trouble understanding them, Welsh accents are really pretty and not hard to understand if you listen to them for a bit as are other regional British accents, standard english can be so boring and a good dialect can broaden viewing pleasure so much, try it? Overall a sweet film about a time past well captured, even if they did get a few of the styles wrong, I forgive them for the Adam ant faux pas as Aneurin Barnard looked ""well fit"" in it, as we say where I hail from!",1377043200,3,1034,4.3076923076923075

5181887,4,B008U0XK3G,I watched the movie because I like Minnie Driver.  It was a very enjoyable movie.  Loved the music the students sang.  Not the typical slick Hollywood production.,1375056000,,162,4.925925925925926
5181888,1,B008U0XK3G,"Was the language in english?, because it definitely needed subtitles, after the first 30 minutes I gave up and fast forwarded to the songs, geez just dreadful. BTW, we didn't like it",1374796800,2,182,4.71875
5181889,5,B008U0XK3G,"Minnie Driver and Aneurin Barnard are mesmerizing in this movie. I haven't been so pulled in by a movie, especially a musical, in ages. The soundtrack is fantastic with Bowie, Drake, ELO, Beach Boys, etc. I loved the innocence of the story and the talent. I see big things for Mr. Barnard in the future. His voice was just wonderful. If you are looking for a simple, enjoyable little indie musical, this is the one.",1374278400,7,415,4.546666666666667
5181890,5,B008U0XK3G,I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. Minnie Driver gave a great performance. Loved how the teacher got the headmaster involved in the play. A real treat to watch,1374105600,,157,4.851851851851852
5181891,4,B008U0XK3G,Enjoyed and recommend viewing. The vocabulary of movie versa USA use is very interesting. With Minnie Driver as primary character elevated my enjoyment. I do not think I have seen her play at any level less than 100%.,1373760000,,217,4.7368421052631575
5181892,5,B008U0XK3G,Love this coming of age story ... Music brings back memories while the performance of each song is spectacular.  Had to order the soundtrack.,1373760000,,141,4.875
5181893,4,B008U0XK3G,Great slice of Wales high school life back in the 1970's. Minnie Driver and cast of actors gels together for a wonderful and tense look at growing up and onward.,1373760000,,161,4.4
5181894,5,B008U0XK3G,"Loved, loved this JEWEL of a film.  The kids were all so real, the musical numbers, inspiring.  The problems and growing pains the kids are facing are universal, so I don't know of any group or demographic that would not be able to relate to this slice of high school life piece from an albeit more innocent time.  This Aneurin Barnard kid blew me away.  His voice is sublime.  I bought the soundtrack too, and his rendition of The Who's Love Reign O'er Me is chilling; although it was left out of the film, it's the best track and those vocals are in another stratosphere.  Minnie was her usual adorable, sassy self.  Evocative cinematography, you really feel you are in the midst of a heatwave ca. Summer of 1976.  I just loved the kids singing The Man Who Sold the World too (Bowie).  OUTSTANDING.",1372982400,14,800,4.5
5181895,4,B008U0XK3G,One of those films that makes you want to see the ending.  Acting was pretty good but if you are looking for excitement you won't find it.  Gave it 4 stars because of the acting and interesting story.,1372982400,,200,4.2368421052631575

5181899,5,B008U0XK3G,"Minnie Driver excels as the hip high school drama teacher trying to instill values to her working class students. The musical numbers are a delight. I really enjoyed this British import. From the folks that gave us Billy Elliot, if you liked that movie you will probably like this one.",1372550400,3,285,4.72

5181901,1,B008U0XK3G,"We tried watching it because the preview made it look promising. It was just not good though. I wish we had not spent money renting it just because it was new (I know better!) but - oh, well.",1372118400,,191,4.052631578947368
5181902,3,B008U0XK3G,The was an enjoyable movie. A nice story but somewhat predictable. Worth a view on Prime but I wouldn't recomment paying $5 to watch it.,1372118400,,136,4.48
5181903,3,B008U0XK3G,It did not seem to be professionally done. It certainly did show a nice picture of school and the kids and teachers at the school. At times the people were difficult tl understand.,1371513600,,180,4.484848484848484
5181904,5,B008U0XK3G,Cute film and better than I had expected. Minnie delivers a solid performance and who doesn't like to see kids succeed in school.,1370476800,,129,4.6521739130434785

5181906,5,B008U0XK3G,"I'm guessing this film isn't for older Americans since, from the other reviews, they couldn't understand Welsh accents or a modern musical format. I thought Aneurin Barnard was wonderful (what a voice!) and I loved the way 70's rock was incorporated into The Tempest. If you didn't like ""Billy Elliot,"" perhaps you won't like this either.",1369699200,4,338,5.053571428571429

They are all loved at home, but don't have a sense of being, so she gives them that, through a musical.  They are given their own choices for music with a Shakespeare play.  It's set in Wales, and the end musical is a magical masterpiece.",1367625600,,345,4.276923076923077

5181911,1,B008U0XK3G,"I love Minnie Driver, she's such a great actress and she can really sing. I wanted to love this movie. I ended up shutting it off about 20 minutes in. I am a huge fan of British TV/movies, so I have a pretty good ear for the accents and usually no trouble following along. I could understand maybe every 10th word of dialog in this one, and it was usually a swear word. Frustration won out. This movie was not for me and I would not recommend it to anyone else.",1366675200,2,461,4.076923076923077

8530332,5,B008U0XK3G,"Stick with it, very worthwhile.  A dirty, chaotic, volatile, emotional mess of characters meet their artistic muse.  The Tempest - a fit choice for this teenage storm of emotions, yet a good story with surprisingly creative, soaring moments, as well as the rougher ones that remind you who the teens are and the harsher realities of their lives and the miserable fates that seem to await them.  It's devastating to think how they would otherwise have been ignored by the school system, and yet they are mostly unappreciative and oblivious to what they're part of.  One teacher sees something in the individual, in the group, as capable of more.  Maybe she's chaotic, unprofessional and inappropriate, but she's all they've got.  I liked that the people in this film were not idealized for film, they were both fun and hard to watch.  I love live theater and found this more interesting and relevant than most of the plays I've seen.",1526256000,,932,4.823899371069182

Throw in a dash of Rock 'n' Roll High School, and add a pinch of American Graffiti and you'll have Hunky Dory. As others have said, the lead character's morals/boundaries are very much in question if not a bit insane, but this is a likable and enjoyable film that ends on a high note. Ultimately, it misses the bullseye, but still hits the target solidly enough for 4 stars - 3 stars if you're not a huge fan of the music.",1512432000,,492,4.24468085106383
