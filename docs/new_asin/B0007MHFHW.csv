2220059,3,B0007MHFHW,"""Ghost of Dragstrip Hollow"" looks like ""Leave It To Beaver"" with souped-up jalopies. Square, brainy teens into automotive combustion lose the lease on their hang-out but quickly acquire new digs--but it's haunted, dig? A few funny double-entrendres(and a sassy parrot)keep this thing watchable, but it's really no better than your average sitcom. The nostalgia is amusing, what with clean-cut kids facing off at the weekend slumber party, but it's too short--and when two feuding girls duel it out with their racing cars to settle their differences, we aren't even privvy to the match! The music is OK, but the awkward, self-conscious teen-nobodys that dot the cast are unintentionally funny.
""Ghost in the Invisible Bikini"" has Tommy Kirk, Deborah Walley, Harvey Lembeck, Nancy Sinatra, Susan Hart, Patsy Kelley and Boris Karloff--and still it's a dud! American International was apparently hurtin' for one last 'Beach Party' and this is the best they could do. Why Sinatra's boyfriend Goo-Goo keeps ditching her for that shapeless redhead is more a mystery than why Susan Hart(as the ghost)is donning the dopiest-looking blonde wig in B-cinema history.
Both films contain a completely different song each entitled ""Geronimo"" for reasons I can't fathom, although Nancy Sinatra's entry wins(and she looks cute shimmying poolside!).",1125705600,6,1331,5.466019417475728
2220060,4,B0007MHFHW,"The first film,""GHOST OF DRAGSTRIP HOLLOW"" is a little slow and corny with square teens hanging out at there local malt shop.

The fun begins when they have a girls pajama party and then go to a spooky old house to have a costume party. And that parrot{the comedy relief} with the punch lines is funny and annoying at times.

The ,""GHOST IN THE INVISIBLE BIKINI"" is the better of the 2 films!

Borris Karloff plays a small role but it's fun seeing Borris in anything. The kids aren't as square in this film and the Haunted House is kool!!

This film reminds me a lot of the tv show the MONKEES.It would also be fun to watch at your local Drive In theatre on a stormy summer night with the gang ,a few beers and your sweetie on your arm!",1123545600,15,736,4.198581560283688
2220061,5,B0007MHFHW,"If you like teen classics, with ghosts than these 2 movies are great for you.

SIDE A: Ghost Of Dragstrip Hollow. Roadster members of the famous drag-racing Kenith Club have blown a gasket since they wern't able to pay the rent and were thrown out of their groovy garage hangout. But luckily for them, a sweet old lady benefactor will let them user he house... only one problem though, it's haunted, and the only way to get rid of those eveil lil ghosts is to scare them out. Count on these Dragstrip racing teen's to get rid of the ghosts, in this pedal-to-the-medal thriller comedy. That really separated the chicks from the chickens!

SIDE B: The Ghost IN The Invisible Bikini. Poor dead Hiram (Boris Karloff)... he only has 24 hours to do a good dead or he won't be able to go to heaven! Happily, help arrives in the forum of a bikini-clad, vixen (Susan Hart)! Together, she and Hiram try to foil the plans of a dastardly lawyer (Basil Rathbone) hellbent on doing away with Hiram's teenage heirs and their entourage of Watusi-dancing, and singing friends before the reading of his will! From beach house to house of horrors, this fast and furious beach film will delight you, and startle you.

These are 2 Great Teen Flicks finally on dvd, if you want something fun to show the family, put this dvd in tonight, your whole family will love these 2 great films.",1123459200,17,1363,4.555102040816327
2220062,5,B0007MHFHW,"Don't let the colorized cover fool you; ""Ghost Of Dragstrip Hollow"" (1959) is filmed in black and white.  The first half of the movie is a teen comedy about drag racing.  The twist is that the only ones who race in the movie are two chicks!  You know that the movie is set in squaresville when the rival drag-racing gang wears suits and ties.  The second half of the movie is a real gas, daddio.  The gang can't raise the bread to keep their old clubhouse, so they're given an old, haunted house to fix up.  These rock and roll ghostbusters drive the ghost out of the house with their swinging costume party.  And the lingo the teenagers use in the movie is a blast, man!

I've been waiting for ""The Ghost In The Invisible Bikini"" (1966) to be released on video for years.  This is the final film in the Beach Party series.  In fact, the only characters from the series to appear in this film were Harvey Lembeck (Eric Von Zipper) and his motorcycle gang, the Rat Pack.  The roles intended for Frankie Avalon and Annette Funicello were played by Tommy Kirk and Deborah Walley.  In addition, instead of surfing and dancing on the beach, they had to settle for having a pool party next to the haunted house.  Movie veterans Boris Karloff (Hiram Stokely) and Basil Rathbone (Reginald Ripper) hammed it up for all they were worth.  Nancy Sinatra and the Bobby Fuller Four provide the music, while Bobbi Shaw and Quinn O'Hara provide the pulchritude.  A gorilla named Monstro, rubber-suited monsters, and a ghost with an invisible bikini (the sexy Susan Hart) are more silly than scary, and keep this colorful motion picture moving at full speed!",1111708800,59,1641,4.59106529209622

2220069,4,B0007MHFHW,Late 50s AIP film has a certain charm to it. In a way it serves as a bridge between the 50s teen flicks  that came before it and the 60s beach party flicks that were to come. An ending right out of Scooby Doo and slang that one needs a dictionary to translate all add to it's charm.,1469923200,,282,3.8620689655172415

2220072,3,B0007MHFHW,"The ""gang"" is pretty tame. My kids are an archaeology major, a sociology major, and a theater kid in high school and they're bigger delinquents than the kids in this movie. There is no discernible plot that I can tell, they don't get to the haunted house until the movie is more than half over, we never really know why it's haunted, and the climatic drag race happens off screen. So why give it 3 stars? It's a simpler time. The kids are pleasant, the music is fun (if not very memorable), and it moves along at a decent pace. Even the parents are decent people-- a rarity for this type of flick. If you're bored and want to kill an hour, watch it. Looking for any depth, don't.",1468886400,2,679,4.271317829457364
2220073,1,B0007MHFHW,"Not even a ""B"" movie and I have terrible taste. The introduction/setup alone took over half the move before a recognizable plot even developed. So if you like any reason to watch kids dance, listen to simplistic dialog, stop now and watch this movie. If bad acting is your thing, you're in luck, there's a lot of it. If a barely recognizable plot is beyond your grasp, then it doesn't get any better than this. If abrupt endings are your thing, Woo Hoo, you can watch it again, or not, it doesn't make any difference as you still won't know what is going on like why THIS house was haunted in the first place, and there were two haunters to pick from.

2220086,4,B0007MHFHW,This movie is free on Amazon Prime.  The Basic premise is you have a group of Fast & Furious drivers in the more innocent times of the latter 1950's.  A group of young car enthusiasts lose their garage they use auto club.  So they move their base of operations to a spooky broken down manor type of house on the outskirts of town.  They are being observed by a reporter studying the car scene. This movie is a comedy that I found funny but the humor is different from what is made today.  There is lots of innuendo but yet it is far more innocent than the spoof movies of today.  This makes the movie kind of weird to watch.  I liked it.,1463356800,3,637,4.130081300813008
2220087,4,B0007MHFHW,"Released in 1959 and shot in B&W, Ghost of Dragstrip Hollow chronicles the events of a group of hot rod drag racers who are forced to move into a deserted mansion as their new headquarters, which appears to be haunted. To celebrate their new home and make money, they throw a Halloween costume party. The festivities are interrupted by a monster who's hogging the dances with the best-looking gals!

This is an eminently entertaining 50s hot rod/non-horror movie highlighted by petite cutie Jody Fair as the main protagonist and, believe it or not, one of the top hot rodders; not to mention the stunning statuesque beauty, Sanita Pelkey, who appears to be around 62. Several of the girls have a slumber party at one point. As for the horror shenanigans, they're essentially the blueprint for the Scooby Doo, Where Are You! cartoon, which debuted a decade later.

The film runs 65 minutes and was shot in Southern California.

2220102,5,B0007MHFHW,"..than an actual review,but let me start by saying this double feature is great fun. I first saw TGODSH on our local late  night monster movie program as a little kid. Even as a child I found it charmingly naive as film making goes. This is a must have double feature. My question is.. Why is this title going for over $40??.. This title is within the top 10 of the Midnite Movies Double Feature series,but there are at least five to six other titles in the series going for dirt cheap prices which are much more superior to this release. TALES FROM THE CRYPT/VAULT OF HORROR or THE THING WITH TWO HEADS/THE INCREDIBLE TWO HEADED TRANSPLANT.. THE DR. PHIBES DOUBLE FEATURE?? or WILD IN THE STREETS?.. I picked up THE GHOST OF DRAG STRIP HOLLOW/GHOST IN THE INVISIBLE BIKINI at a local used shop for $3.99 perfect condition. Were fewer copies of this double feature manufactured?... Making it harder to find?.. If not,there is no reason for the ridiculous asking price.",1391040000,,968,4.627906976744186

The stupid parrot is a huge deterrent of this movie, extremely annoying and not funny. Overall this campy film is still to banal for me to recommend. Ghost in the Invisible Bikini: GODAWFUL. Shame on Karloff for doing it. This one has more of a 60s feel, which I can't stand. I veer away from 60s films because I find the film industry really undermined the intelligence of the general public at that time, portraying them as knieve and ignorant. I understand campy films are meant to be fluff but this movie is seriously meant for 5 year-olds, not adults....and even 5 yr -olds may find it stupid.",1313712000,,768,4.453900709219858

2220109,5,B0007MHFHW,"I have seen ""Ghost of Dragstrip Hollow"" dozens of times, but have yet to sit through one screening of ""Citizen Kane.""  What does that tell you?  Anyway, as ""Dragstrip Hollow"" opens, the Zenith Car Club is facing eviction because they have no money to pay rent.  This is rather surprising, since club members include ""TV"" Tommy Ivo as himself, a current world record holder in several dragster categories (""world's fastest unblown gas engine,"" etc.), as well as the Renegades, a really great core rock 'n' roll band, that should be in the Rock 'N' Roll Hall of Fame.  Alfonso, a talking parrot, eventually becomes an unofficial member.

Anyway, the gang gets evicted and sets up shop in a haunted house.  The unveiling of the ghost is as non-essential as it is anti-climatic, and the bad guys--""Tony and Anita and their creep friends""--are always impecably dressed.  But so what?  This movie is all about hot rodders in sport coats, dancing, respect for parents, soda pop, and the great rock 'n' roll of the Renegades.  And let me tell you, the Renegades steal the show.  As far as I know, they are the only group to use guns as musical instruments.  If you haven't heard jams like like ""Geronimo,"" ""Charge,"" and ""Ghost Train,"" now is your chance.
