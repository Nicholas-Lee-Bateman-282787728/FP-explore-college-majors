8053192,5,B0007XBMDO,"This is a great DVD for getting started on the guitar.  John Doyle covers a LOT of ground on just one DVD including scales, a lot of chord work, rhythms, and great theory.  Unfortunately, the notation booklet that accompanies the DVD is far to small to be easily useable (it was made to fit inside the DVD case).",1193616000,,312,4.362068965517241
