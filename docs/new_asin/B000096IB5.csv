Such snootiness was probably justified for the below-average Olivier Gruner vehicle&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Circuit/dp/B000067DJN/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Circuit</a>, but less so when it comes to that ones sequel. The Circuit 2 makes a genuine effort to address the shortcomings of its predecessor and is definitely the better movie, though its considerable faults will probably make it a waste of time for viewers who aren't already fans of the low-budget fight scene. Gruner fans ought to definitely investigate.

The story: When his significant other pays dearly for investigating an organized prison fighting circuit, the returning Dirk Longstreet (Gruner) goes undercover as an inmate to break the secret to the worldand exact revenge.

As far as prison flicks go, this one is pretty tame, with minimal exploitation and even a noticeable lack of outright brutality when it comes to the brawls. The utilization of the cast is likewise a soft touch: in addition to Olivier, the lineups comprised of B-grade butt-kickers Lorenzo Lamas, Jalal Merhi, Michael Blanks, Shaun Benjamin, and Gary Hudson, and while Lamas, Blanks, and Hudson mix it up physically, they're definitely not being used to their fullest extent. Blanks involvement is particularly disappointing, because hes set up as a strong supporting character but ends up not doing more than fighting. The storyline is straight-forward but still has time for the occasional fruitless detour and goofiness: warden Benjamin impresses on Gruner his need to have a dominant white champion to appease the supposedly racist audience, but this never seems to be an issue, and later theres an unintentionally humorous scene wherein Gruner engages in an hours-long foot chase with the main fighter (Jim Shagen).

Theres a *lot* of fighting in this movie: only counting the fights that last at least ten seconds brings me to 21 separate brawls. Their quality is a major step up from the abortive scraps of the original feature, with an admirable variety of fighting styles on display, some choreographic highlights, and a satisfying scene wherein Gruner and Lorenzo Lamas team up to fight some thugs in a parking lot (its a funny juxtaposition wherein Olivier is clearly giving his all but Lamas dispatches opponents with customary ease). Gruner looks legitimately skilled and powerful, like a UFC competitor, and faces a unique roster of opponents including a high-kicking Larnell Stovall and a whip-wielding Robert Chapin. Nevertheless, I cant point to a single encounter as an objectively great fight. Many of them are one-sided, and even moments of directorial ambitiousness are diluted by poor camerawork and editing. The film climaxes with a tournament, but its meaningless because most of the matches are over so quickly that you hardly have enough time to distinguish between the fighters.

Still, I give the cumulative package a passing score, and with the final installment to the Circuit trilogy unlikely to receive a North American release, we can at least say that the wests exposure to the franchise ended on a decent note. Fight fans can easily bear it on a slow night, and fans who enjoy Oliviers work mainly for the kickboxing ought to be happy with this. Dont go out of your way for this one, but don't give it the cold shoulder, either.",1453161600,,3787,5.745098039215686

7990070,3,B000096IB5,"Overall, this sequal to the first Circuit movie falls a bit short to its predacessor, but for what it is - a prison fight movie - Circuit 2 is better than expected.

The main reason I dislike prison fight movies are the limits and confinements of a prison for the movie, with little exciting scenery.  Most of the Circuit 2 takes place in a typical prison, with plenty of fights set up by the warden for its inmates, but eventually there is a tournement that expands later in the movie to a beach at night.  I love this tournament, mainly because you can hear and see the ocean waves crashing in the background while some decent fights are going on, in front of a small audience.  Just when you think the film has reached its final fight, more action continues and at dawn, the Olivier Gruner character and main villain fighter duel out in the ocean water for a few minutes.  Its a pretty cool fight too.

Overall, Circuit 2 is not as exciting as the first in terms of story and development.  There are more fights that the first, though, and Circuit 2 still delivers above average quailty for a B-grade movie.",1159228800,,1110,4.438423645320197

7990072,1,B000096IB5,"As a fellow reviewer lamented, this is one bad movie.  Olivier Gruner is passionless and boring.  Gary Hudson as the bad prison guard is offed by a prisoner (I think)--editing problem # 1 out of several.  Gail Harris as the girlfriend is in a coma, then someone tries to kill her, she's okay and next thing you know, she's dead???  Where did that come in?

Pointless, trite, definitely not worthy to inspire another sequel.  Yuck!",1096675200,,430,4.666666666666667
7990073,1,B000096IB5,"If you want to see the worst movie ever made, rent this movie. I've seen better acting in elemetary school plays. The plot has holes so big that you could fit the new planet Sedna through it. When the main character's girlfriend is attacked and beaten, we never find out her fate, and characters refer to her as dead AND in a coma. Come again?
Also, Michael Blanks, who was in the first movie, plays a different character in the sequel. Like viewers aren't going to pick up on this? Add to that a scene when prison guards open fire on innocent spectators for no reason. This movie has no brain.
I had to review this movie for a DVD web site and I want the hour and a half of my wasted life back!!!",1079395200,,697,4.17037037037037

Good acting by Oliver Grunier, I looked him up to see what other movies he has been in, mostly smaller BBE names.",1058140800,,304,4.428571428571429
