5994696,2,B00FKGP4K0,I saw this short short film - years ago at a theatre. At that time this short was a as prelude to a feature length film and it was unique at that time and thus enjoyable.  Recently I this film on video on both a regular 27 inch TV and wide screen TV connected to a powerful audio system.  If you do not have the wide screen TV and great audio system do not bother.  The quality of this film is quite poor compared to the crystal clear clarity of most Claude Lelouch films. Plus it just does not work on the small screen.  Bigger the viewing and hearing platform that more enjoyable the viewing.  Au Revoir!,996105600,6,606,4.145299145299146
5994697,5,B00FKGP4K0,"this was a completely amazing movie, everything about it was great. The second you start watching you can't turn away, you start thinking that he might wreck or something will happen and you will miss it. This is an amazing display of what you can do with one reel of 16mm film.",994118400,,278,4.365384615384615
5994698,5,B00FKGP4K0,"A thrilling, High revving, fast drive through Paris at dawn in a 275GTB Ferrari. The camera is strapped right to the front of the car so you're almost in it! A great nine minutes of intense driving as LeLouche tears around Paris screeching the tyres and driving his Ferrari as it was made to be driven. An absolute must for Ferrari enthusiasts and sportscar enthusiasts alike. A great film to view and worthwhile purchase even if it is a little expensive for 9 minutes of viewing. Great stuff!!!",987984000,7,495,4.636363636363637
5994699,5,B00FKGP4K0,"This movie is simply stunning.  I first saw it in 1989 and it has stayed in my memory ever since as one of the best and most exciting sensory rushes ever.  If you want to get the adrenalin running.. this is it.  What differentiates this from other "" speed "" movies is, that this one was not choerographed in any way.  He just did it! and its stunning!",977011200,6,351,4.117647058823529
5994700,5,B00FKGP4K0,"I've not seen the video, but nearly 30 years ago I saw the film on 35mm, and it was so intense, that the memory of it has never left me. It's like watching Leo Kottke in full flight on his 12-string; you see it, you hear  it, but nonetheless your mind refuses to accept that it's possible.
Buy  it.
Buy it now.
And while you wait for it to arrive, practice holding  your breath for 9 minutes, as you'll need that ability.....",959126400,15,425,4.158536585365853
5994701,5,B00FKGP4K0,"Without a doubt the most intense 9 minutes you will ever experience!  Witness what you always wish you could do-driving full-bore through early-morning streets heedless of personal safety (and the safety of those  around you!), ignoring traffic laws and the laws of physics, on your way to  meet a beautiful woman in your own Ferrari!",943747200,9,334,5.036363636363636
5994702,5,B00FKGP4K0,I love driving fast and I also love the sound of high revving Ferrari engines. This terrific 9 minute film comes as close to both without  actually driving yourself. Every time I turn it on I end up watching  mesmorized for the entire 9 minutes.,940982400,3,245,4.4222222222222225
8616289,5,B00FKGP4K0,"Finally, C'etait un Rendezvous on Blu-ray! Way better than the original DVD in full frame, now you really feel like you're in the car. If you're familiar with this film, grab it on BD. If you don't know about it, it's ten minutes long and a piece of history, so it would help if you're a car guy...",1449014400,,298,4.155172413793103
8616290,5,B00FKGP4K0,"I use to love the Nissan 350Z version ""The Run"" of this video until I saw the real thing. Once you see this video - you won't look at ""The Run"" again. It is awesome.",1418947200,,165,3.742857142857143
8616291,5,B00FKGP4K0,Loved the video and the legend behind it.,1411516800,,41,4.25
8616292,5,B00FKGP4K0,"Yes a restored DVD version is available at SpiritLevelFilm.com, unfortunatly it is only in PAL format at this time.  Hopefully a NTSC version will be made available in the near future...",1049760000,,186,5.0
8616293,4,B00FKGP4K0,"The reviewers that lamented about speeds not exceeding 70 have obviously never driven really quickly on anything other than an arrow straight expressway. Lap records for street car based racing cars at the average sports car track rarely exceed 80. This guy was flying and if the doubters don't believe it, try averaging 70 on a narrow twisting road. Great flick and a real rush if you really know driving.",1032307200,3,406,4.814285714285714
8616294,5,B00FKGP4K0,"If you read the review from Mr. Square from Germany, you find the words of a frustrated man who cannot appreciate experience without having to take out his analytical tools to measure things.  What matthead fails to see is that Lelouch had imagination and courage by doing what many of us dream of doing through the streets of our metropolis.  If you haven't seen the film and you still have blood pumping through your veins then take this film for a test drive.  As for matthead, please put your measuring tape away.",1028851200,,517,4.5978260869565215
8616295,4,B00FKGP4K0,"Have you ever recorded the sound of your car at the exhaust pipe and listened to it with great thrill on your stereo system? Do you own a copy of ""Mecanic Symphony"" (No, not spelled wrong) and occasionally flip it in your car's CD player and enjoy the sound of an F1 flying down the straight at full throttle?
Then the overpriced, disappointingly short but sweaty-palms intense ""Rendezvous"" is an absolute MUST-HAVE.
I see it again and again. Unlike other reviewers I pray it does not come in a DVD version as I shall feel compelled to invest also in that edition if for no other reason then at least to get some audio commentary by Lelouch and hopefully clear up just exactly WHAT vehicle he or whomever it is, is driving? Since there are several seemingly unfounded opinions then I shall submit with great certainty that it is indeed a Lamborghini Miura and the driver none other than Patrick Stewart.
Being a father of 3 I must admit that I can no longer condone the sort of driving which is completely irresponsible and sociopathic. So unlike other reviewers, and while I do believe there are no camera tricks, I think Lelouch staged the shoot and blocked off streets just out of view - by believing this I can go on and view it again and again without a guilty conscience.
A great excuse towards your spouse is that this movie doubles as an intense lovestory. You can view it purely as a carnut flick,  focusing on the engine sounds and screeching tires; or you can look at it as a guy who so desperately longs for his loved one whom he has just promised to meet, that he drives full throttle risking own and others limbs to meet her AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.",1010275200,2,1659,4.457236842105263
8616296,1,B00FKGP4K0,"Lelouche's ""Rendezvous"" movie is IMHO an overrated joke.
I watched an AVI, and figured out the timed needed to drive down the Champs Elysees from Arc de Triomphe (timecode 1:32) to Place de la Concorde (2:48): about 70 seconds in a straight line.
By measuring the distance on a map of Paris (about 2000 meter), you'll get the average speed: about 64 mph or 102 km/h.
Certainly not a Ferrari (nor a Le Mans sportscar!) at full speed, but probably an ordinary car driven somewhat faster than allowed.
In twistier parts of the city, the sound often goes through all gears into 5th, while the visual speeds don't change much. For example at around 05:40, when he is forced to pass a parked truck slowly.
It's hard to believe that people get fooled by that.
At the beginning, it is stated that ""the film was produced without photographic tricks nor changes in camera speed"". That is IMHO true. The film is right, but the sound is fake.
IMHO, everyone could produce such a flick by recording a normal trip through the village on video, and then adding some exciting sounds generated by a computer racing game.
Search the net for onboard videos on the Nrburgring Nordschleife to get real speed!",1010016000,4,1187,4.6571428571428575
