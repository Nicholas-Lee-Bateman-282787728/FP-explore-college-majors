I think I am the ONLY adult that likes Barney.  Can't help it, the shows were great and very age appropriate.  My other favorite is the one with Ricky Racoon.",1380067200,,329,4.174603174603175

316159,5,6301218809,"Along with Three Wishes & The Backyard Gang, this was my favorite barney video as a kid. In fact, I grew up on the backyard gang and was fond of them more then Barney & friends, there really needs to be a DVD release for these videos for longtime fans and to introduce them to a whole new audience as well!!",1324857600,,307,4.049180327868853
316209,5,6301218809,"Barney Goes to School video has been very entertaining for my daughter.  We lost our original and everyday, she asked if she could watch it.  I caved and purchased this off of Amazon at a reasonable cost.

Barney and his friends use their imagination and wish it was school on Saturday.  They play in centers, sing all types of songs, go over their ABCs and are actually in a real classroom.",1323388800,,391,4.464788732394366

316211,5,6301218809,"This is a wonderful Christmas tape for any parent whose child loves Barney.  I purchased this tape years ago for my older son who is now 19 and he was the one that reminded me that my younger son who is 2 would certainly love it.  Unfortunately, Amazon delivered the wrong video tape. While the box was Waiting for Santa, the tape was completely different.  I was extremely disappointed.",1291593600,,387,4.579710144927536

316213,5,6301218809,"""Rock with Barney"" is delightful.  An early tape in the Barney series, it projects a happy, positive outlook, with pleasant singing, dancing, and smiles by the children, which both entertain and teach the pre-schoolers and also their parents!",1259539200,,242,5.368421052631579
316214,5,6301218809,"Barney's Waiting For Santa video has to be one of the best Barney movies ever. Several other reviews complain about the ""production"" and ""vintage Barney"". This movie is 20 years old, what do you expect? This is a timeless classic that I still enjoy and I highly recommend it to others. I wish I had the soundtrack on my Ipod! If you love your kids buy them this movie! You won't regret it!",1244246400,,389,4.342465753424658
316215,3,6301218809,"I bought a video for my son for Christmas.  The video plays fine, but the cover which was described to be ""rough around the edges"" was totally trashed.  Bent, crinkles,ripped, etc.  I was glad he's only 2 1/2 and could care less and my older kids knew I bought it used and it wasn't from ""Santa"".  I would have liked to know how damaged it really was, but video played well, and that's what's most important.",1231372800,,408,4.328947368421052

316314,4,6301218809,"Three Wishes is one of the Barney and the Backyard Gang series of the '80s and early '90s.  It features Michael, Amy, Tina, Luci, Jason, and Adam.  The songs were catchy and fun, especially Mr. Knickerbocker (only in this series would you see Barney breakdance).  While it's not THE best BG show, it certainly beats the drivel we're stuck with nowadays.  I'd suggest this for children whose parents grew up watching the BG.  It's fun, and it doesn't ""talk down"" to children, as do the new episodes of Barney and Friends.

I also include Barney's Campfire Singalong and A Day at the Beach as my top recommendations for the BG series.",1163116800,,632,4.648648648648648

316357,5,6301218809,"I sing the tunes all year through and it brings me back to when my now 18 year old was singing and dancing as a five year old in front of the T.V.  How I miss those days and how I have been looking for this GREAT CHRISTMAS CLASSIC according to my family.  As sung like a true kid...here comes Adam looking oh so fine, Now it's more like Christmas Time!!!  I loved that part!",1135382400,3,374,3.96
316358,5,6301218809,"This video continues to be one of the most-requested by our daughter, and it's no surprise why --- it keeps to a basic formula to which younger children can relate.  You will find no fancy dance numbers here; it is pretty basic stuff for the kids who were not yet polished performers.  The singing is rough-hewn and occasionally off key, as it should.  The songs are (for the most part) easy for the children to recognize and learn.  The setting is one that most daycare children will recognize, and enough of the performers are younger so that the pre-school viewers have a recognizable peer group on the screen.

It fascinates me that, by loving this video as dearly as she does, our daughter is following in the footsteps of her older brother, who also embraced this video as his favorite a decade earlier.  Despite newer Barney videos which are much more slickly-produced but which often fail to hold the interest of their audience, this video continues to please consistently.",1131580800,,981,4.775147928994083
316359,4,6301218809,"Nobody will mistake this for anything other than a very early effort.  Barney sounds like James Earl Jones at times, and is far more menacing than the later version.  The kids plow through their lines, frequently sing off key, and stumble through their dance moves.  It looks like Amateur Hour, but in many ways that is the charm of it.  In later years, the kids got more polished & practiced, and the franchise acquired a slick professionalism that leaves me and my daughter cold.  Give her a choice between the later Barney & this early, rough-hewn effort, and she will choose this video every time.",1126051200,2,601,4.685714285714286
316420,5,6301218809,"This video is one of my favorite Barneys....my granddaughter likes it too. The part about using seat belts has made it easier to get my toddler granddaughter to willingly sit in her car seat. If Barney says that she should use a seat belt, then she will. The songs and the children are delightful!",1123977600,,297,4.518518518518518
316421,5,6301218809,"I remember this movie but I don't recall watching it. I remember going to the movie store and my dad would have to get the right barney movie for me because I was scared to death of the way barney looked on the video case, so that leads to one of my questions. Question 1: I don't understand why barney used to be dark purple and had a deeper voice, it even shows a lighter colored barney in the top left corner on the box, so this confused me.

Question 2: What role did sandy duncan play on these barney movies?  What did she do? Was she a mother of one of the kids?

 Please, if anyone knows answers to my questions, please respond to me. Thank You! (sorry if this wasn't really a review)",1119052800,,691,4.0962962962962965

316423,4,6301218809,"When I was in kindergarten, I remeber watching it.  I remember making clay pies (if i recall, there was a song called crocodile pie during that time) I also remember them doing the pledge of allegiance, and, a hamster escaping from it's cage (Barney probably scared it! -just kidding-) Luckily, barney and the gang find the hamster.  It was the best one I can remember.",1118361600,,369,4.661538461538462
316424,3,6301218809,"The only thing I remember is barney getting stuck in the fireplace at the begining. I don't know if there was a fire or not. It scared me.  His deeper voice and deeper shade of purple that was different from the new barney is the reason why I was scared.  Maybe your kids might like watching it, I don't know, but if it's for kids than thats good enough for me.",1118361600,,361,4.070422535211268

316467,5,6301218809,"I am in college now, but I still have the guilty pleasure of watching this movie before every school year.  I love how it depicts the kids loving school.  I always see cartoons with kids hating going to school, but I am always happy to hear when Tina would sing ""I wish there was school every day"".  For parents with kids getting ready for their first day of school, this is the perfect tape to show them, to let them know that school can be fun and exciting, and they may just be sitting around on a weekend singing the song I mentioned above.  You never know!",1097366400,,561,4.214953271028038
316468,5,6301218809,"I taught pre-school for over 10 years.  My Barney Goes to School tape was replaced 3 times.  When my daughter was born, I had to go to e-bay to find another one.  Before she was three, she knew the days of the week (and that there were 7) what colors mixed together made other colors, shapes ect.  She began to read at 4, and now at 6 reads on a 4th grade level.  I have to give a lot of credit to Barney for her love of learning. Now, my younget is a big Barney fan.  I will be getting this tape for her also. We have had a lot of Barney tapes, but this one is by far the best!

I highly recommend this video because of the fun and catchy songs that the group sings while they play in the Movie Studio.  5 stars for Rock With Barney!,1009756800,3,471,4.043478260869565
316587,3,6301218809,"This is one of the very early Barney videos with the original Backyard gang, Michael, Amy, Tina, Lucy, etc.
They introduce Derrick in this episode, who has just moved into the neighborhood and doesn't know if Santa has his address.  So Barney takes the kids up to the north pole, where they meet Mrs. Clause and confirm that Derrick is on the list.
Overall the songs are OK, but if you are used to the current Barney, you will find a few things jarring.  For example, Barney's eyes are wide open, rather than sleepy half shut as they are now.  This gives him a somewhat manic and (IMO) scary look - Note - my 3 year old son does not find him scary, in fact he loves this video.  Oh well.  Barney is a slightly different shade of purple, and in one song the kids do a ""disco-y"" hip thrust that rather surprised us.",1003190400,5,813,4.253246753246753
316588,3,6301218809,"If your kids are fans of the older Barney kids, i.e. the original ""Backyard Gang"", they will like this video.  The plot is probably the most realistic of all the subsequent Barney videos and the songs are cute.  It's got a nice cozy feel to it, although the original Barney looks much different than his current version.  Worth a view.",998179200,2,335,4.55
316589,4,6301218809,"This is an older version of Barney, but my 2 yr. old LOVES IT!!  She will sit still the whole time the video is playing.  I'm trying to locate another copy of the video, as our copy is worn out!",976579200,,194,3.825
316590,3,6301218809,"The backyard gang Barney looks and talks a lot different then the Barney from the last 5 or so years. The songs are fun, the kids are good, but my toddler doesn't seem as attracted as she is to other Barney videos",973555200,3,213,4.095238095238095
316591,3,6301218809,"I purchased this for my 3 year old a year ago and sat down to watch it with her.  I was disappointed when I realized  it was a very old version of  Barney, obviously one of his first videos.  Barney is not as soft and  cuddly looking as his outfit needed some fine tuning.  Still, my daughter  didn't notice and she still likes to drag this video out and watch it.  I  am buying the new Christmas Barney and will be expecting better things!",941068800,6,440,4.142857142857143
