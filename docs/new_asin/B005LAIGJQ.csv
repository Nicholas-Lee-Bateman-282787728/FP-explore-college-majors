4719663,5,B005LAIGJQ,"There hasn't been one comedy that I've watched with Eddie Murphy that I did Not find very funny and entertaining. This one is no exception. Eddie is introduced to a magical tree as he is convinced to believe that he only has one-thousand words left or else! From start to finish, his facial expressions, combined with a turn of events as he becomes silent is laugh-out-loud entertainment right to the end. The acting performance of a great cast adds the finishing touches. If you love Eddie Murphy comedy, you made the right choice! Highly recommended.",1339891200,3,552,4.821052631578947
4719664,4,B005LAIGJQ,This was not your typical Eddie Murphy movie. It was funny but had a serious note to it about appreciating life and the power of words. This movie did not have enough romance to build the relationship between the husband and wife but it showed how the man got wrapped up in his work and using words to deceive and get whatever he wanted. It was funny for the first half but not one the kids would really enjoy like some of his other movies. There was no nudity but there was some strong profanity and some violence. Not a movie to watch over and over but worth a viewing.,1339545600,3,571,4.2

4719667,3,B005LAIGJQ,"Eddie Murphy has been making kid's movies for so long he has forgotten how to make them for adults. Eddie plays Jack McCall, a literary agent who has signed a New Age guru, and has agreed to following the guru's ways in order to get the contract. A tree suddenly appears in Jack's back yard, one that loses a leaf every time Jack says speaks or writes a word. The presumption is that when all the leaves are gone, the tree dies and so does Jack and the movie. What happens to the tree, happens to Jack.

The humor is how Jack, a constant talker, now has to be silent as if his life depended on it. It has that ""Liar, Liar"" feel to it, it just isn't as funny.

It is a yawner that might work for the 14-16 year old crowd. The movie has some heart warming redeeming value to it, you just have to wait for it until the end. If you want to see Eddie Murphy in his street smart role, try ""Tower Heist.""

Adult language, no nudity, no real sex.",1333843200,,938,4.059459459459459
4719668,2,B005LAIGJQ,"MOVIE REVIEW #22: "" A Thousand Words""

Directed by Brian Levin better known for his executive Producing of TV series One Tree Hill, Smallville and What I Like About You - Brian needs a little direction himself. The film itself - which is  often slower in pace in parts and not really `flowing' from scene-to-scene - seems to take its' time to get where its going. Probably from a simple and mundane script from Steven Koren who amazingly also wrote such scripts as Bruce Almighty, Evan Almighty, Click and was a regular writer on SNL.

The most interesting part and most pleasing thing about this film was Eddie Murphy himself. Unfortunately , even with a bad script and poor direction, Eddie could only shine on a gag-by-gag basis and does have some good physical comedy moments. Not worth the theatre price but definitely a good `catch on cable' or DVD rental show.

The concept is simple. Eddie gets `magically' connect to a tree that literally pops up in his backyard. He learns from a famous Indian `Guru' played by Cliff Curtis (Training Day, The Last Airbender) that with every word he says a leaf falls off this tree. When the leaves are gone, he dies. Yawn. But again, Eddie is an amazing physical talent and he just hasn't found his right material to match his talents in a long time. (See him in Dreamgirls - he was amazing).  There are literally some laugh outloud moments due to Eddie's performance, but he wasn't supported byt the direction of the movies important message.

However there were great standout performance by some of the cast including Ruby Dee who plays his Alzheimer's diseased mother and Allison Janney his advertising firms boss.

Way too simple, way to long and way to dull. The message of the movie is excellent and quite important in todays world - listening takes a lot of work and is most important in all relationships - but too bad the script wasn't better and the direction more dynamic.

4719784,3,B005LAIGJQ,"A Thousand Words
 This lukewarm comedy/drama can best be enjoyed by fans of Eddie Murphys classic, manic comedy style.  As a Murphy vehicle it works better than some of his duds but is not a patch on his best work, say the first Dr. Doolittle film or his voice of the Donkey in Shrek.  I myself do like the classic, manic Murphy style very much and enjoyed the film because Director Brian Robbins allows Murphy to run lose on screen for extended periods.  The recent Tower Heist had Murphy doing improvisational comedy for about one minute, the best minute by far in the film.  A Thousand Words has Murphy contorting his face and talking fast for a lot of the movie.  Good.
 There is a side story about the importance of family to a persons ultimate personal happiness that also worked for me.  I won't spoil it for you but there is a complicated and very touching exposition of the Murphy characters relationship with his father and mother that caused my tears to well up if not actually leak out.
 The story is a journey into Magical Realism in Twenty First Century American Cinema but lets just say a magic tree is trying to kill Eddie Murphy.  The magic tree loses a leaf for each word Murphy speaks-Murphy is an agent who makes his living by talking.  When the tree becomes leafless, Murphy becomes lifeless.  This gives Murphy a chance to be funny without speaking, which he does.
 All in all, this is only average or a little less.  We should think of A Thousand Words as a mathematically average two and a half saw blade film.  This is just about average for Director Brian Robbins. Robbins has directed a number of real Hollywood films including Good Burger and The Shaggy Dog.  Eddie Murphy once had enough star power to command more original directing talent but this is no longer the case.
 The people are never wrong (although critics are often wrong).  The optimistic producers spent a whopping $40 million, somehow, on making this film.  Wise members of the viewing public have squandered a mere $18 million in five weeks at the box office.  I think the public wants to see genuinely good films and is prepared to pay for the privilege, but won't put out much cash for the mediocre.
 This amiable PG-13 time waster runs a short one hour and 31 minutes.  We are in the doldrums of the movie year but if we are patient huge big budget blockbusters will come our way.  At least the special effects will be diverting.",1469836800,,2428,4.543778801843318

I remember seeing previews of this movie and it didn't look interesting, so it would be a waste of money for me to buy it.

4719989,4,B005LAIGJQ,"The movie was good. I hate that there was no special features included in the Blu-ray disc.

In this movie, Eddie Murphy played a character who had to limit the words he speak or else he would die based on the tree in his backyard.

There was some parts of the movie I did not like. One of them, of course, was the awkwardness when he had to go to a meeting with some associates/employees. However, I did like the parts when he went to a cafe and told the cashier (Jack McBrayer) what he wanted nonverbally.",1423353600,,507,4.216494845360825
4719990,4,B005LAIGJQ,"Inside of this mediocre movie, is a good story.  This seems like a movie that began with a simple script and a premise that was on the existential side, and perhaps required a metaphorical leap by the audience, and then some studio head said ""make this zany Eddie Murphy movie, make it silly"" and they screwed it up.  Its kind of like Liar Liar.  Beneath the silly Jim Carrey schtick was a sweeter tale.

The basic premise - After slick talking a spiritual guru during a book deal, a literary agent finds a Bodhi tree in his yard. Eddie finds out that the words he speaks will cause the tree to lose leaves.  When the leaves are gone, he will die.  And while the easy part of this is the silly troubles his conservation of words will cause, the deeper meaning is the journey of the soul he is forced to take as he evaluates how those words are used, the importance of each one, and finally coming to terms to say the things he never could.  What begins as a restriction, actually ends up liberating him.

To be honest, its kind of a messy movie, but its heart is in the right place, and I do feel the last 20 minutes redeems it.  Worth a view.",1418256000,,1143,4.2304147465437785

The guy had been an awesome comic and had SUCH amazing potential for his career's diversity form his stand up on SNL and his other appearances in films like Boomerang. But then... Raw.

Where this movie came from was a HAPPY blindsided slap I NEEDED from Mr Murphy. Not only has he once again proven that he can be masterful with his acting by choosing amazing roles, but he engages your imagination and his own uncanny wit even in a role that's mostly serious.

I'll say this. I was pleasantly delighted when this movie came out, and I had seen it in a dollar theatre DESPITE the dismal ratings on rottentomatoes.com. I had intentionally selected the 'worst movie out' right now, and this came in at 0%, and you know what. I did NOT get what was expected and had a GREAT time with this movie.

The title of this movie is very interesting for what would you do if you only had a thousand words to talk to a family member or an acquaintance.  Makes you stop and think about it doesn't it.

Cool little story - it's got comedy AND...you get to see the sexy, HOT Kerry Washington in a sexy, HOT outfit. That right there should make ya wanna see it - - AHHH...if you're into that kind of stuff. (lol)

4720455,1,B005LAIGJQ,"What sad commentary that a movie this bad can get made.  Every scene when Eddie Murphy (Jack McCall) tried to be funny was pathetically contrived, forced, and plain stupid.  Murphy has either totally sold out and just looks to get paid, or he no longer can spot a good script, good writing, and decent plots.  If this movie was on Pandora, I would have hit thumbs down instantly, along with never play this again.

But since I am an eternal optimist and forever hopeful, I kept watching it, hoping for Beverly Hills Cop Eddie Murphy or Trading Places Eddie to come out, but instead it became more nauseating with every scene and every turn.  I realize it was a comedy/slash romantic comedy, but it did neither very well.  The entire movie insults the audience's intelligence and the funniest guy in it was Jack McBrayer (Starbucks employee).  Comedy classics like Hangover, Something About Mary, Vacation, Airplane, Superbad, The 40 Year-Old Virgin, etc. are not just above it, they are leagues apart from it.

If this is as good as Eddie Murphy can get today, he should retire.  Then again, may be he needs money badly because he agreed to star in this total waste of 91 minutes of my time and of film.  I never thought Adam Sandler's ""That's My Boy"" would have company so quickly as worst comedy ever made.",1367798400,3,1308,4.647826086956521

4720458,3,B005LAIGJQ,"Jack McCall (Eddie Murphy) is a literary agent who will do whatever it takes to make money. After a conversation with Dr. Sinja (Cliff Curtis), a magical tree appears in Jack's yard. With every word spoken a leaf falls. It will not be good for Jack if the tree becomes bare.

""Don't talk for three days. How hard could it be?"" Jack had to come up with ways to communicate in person and on the phone without words. Eddie Murphy is very good at using facial expressions and other body language to get points across. I don't think he was as funny as I've known him to be, though. There were parts that made me laugh a bit, but there were also parts I'm sure were supposed to be funny but didn't make me laugh. Everything that had to do with Jack's family life - those were the scenes (except the one in the hotel room) I liked best. Clark Duke did a good job; I liked his character best. And Murphy's performance near the end really touched me. I'd love to see him in more dramatic roles.

When I saw the movie trailer a while back, my first thought was 'this movie has a New Age theme', but that didn't keep me from checking it out because as a Christian I know what I believe; not every movie I watch is Christian-based.

Death - we all know it's going to happen one day, but many take life and other people for granted. A Thousand Words wasn't as entertaining as I thought it'd be, but this film gives viewers a few things to think about.",1363219200,3,1438,4.221818181818182

His antics and timing are right on and he manages to rescue this film from obscurity. I took off one star for the New Age gobbledygook that has little to do with the real world and detracts from the story. Another star removed for the basic concepts of this film being repeats of Jim Carrey's ""Liar Liar,"" ""Yes Man,"" etc., and one more star for the notion that a father raising a child with his male partner could ever be considered cute. How could denying a child the love of a mother be in any way humorous?

Enjoy the flim, then rent ""Beverly Hills Cop""...",1360454400,3,724,4.2086330935251794

However, this turned out to be a movie that I really love and cherish.  There are a lot of good, funny lines in it, but as the movie progresses, there is also a deep thoughtfulness to it about personal authenticity and how it can make a real difference in your relationships.  This is not at all a preachy movie, which makes its message that much more enjoyable and accessible.  This movie makes you laugh and think at the same time.",1360195200,,595,4.472222222222222

4720525,3,B005LAIGJQ,"This is a fantasy movie about a man, Jack McCall, played by Eddie Murphy, to whom truth is an expendable and frequently abused quality who twists and distorts it in pursuit of his personal goals. Unfortunately, for him, fate, karma, or whatever you may call it, steps in and changes everything. A mysterious tree suddenly appears in his yard and starts dying.

The life of the tree is tied into Jack McCall's abuse of words; when he speaks leaves fall off the tree and when they are all gone something terminal may happen to Jack.

The movie is full of Eddie Murphy humor and he exhibits his amazing talent with his face and body to communicate with the audience. If you're a fan of Eddie Murphy you'll love this movie. I'm not sufficiently dedicated to his type of humor so I found some parts of the movie somewhat tedious and repetitive.

The movie is rather predictable and has the expected happy ending as you've probably already guessed; it is rated PG-13 and is generally inoffensive. I would suggest you watch it first; I will probably not watch it again.",1359849600,3,1062,4.608465608465608

4720654,2,B005LAIGJQ,"You tried with this movie and I really appreciate that. You've made some stinkers and you've made some that had moments but never fully delivered. A Thousand Words is like that, albeit a mixture of your raunchy self with the Daddy Day Care part. It's not a great mix. You've either got to do one or the other. You make a nice but trite point about spirituality and finding inner peace and a whole lot of stuff that your character denounced as New Age garbage at one point, quite correctly, I might add, but it's not enough to elevate yet another pedestrian effort. If you're going to make a movie that touches my heart and has some profundity, go all the way and don't try to Eddie Murphy it up with your shtick because you end up pulling a Bill Murray trying to do The Razor's Edge, and it just doesn't work. I appreciate the effort, but it ends up being another in a really long string of duds. I'm sorry man, but that's the way I feel.

You're so talented, Eddie. I mean, seriously. They should've created a special Oscar just for The Nutty Professor so you could've won both Best Actor and Best Supporting Actor all-in-one. There is no one in Hollywood who could've pulled those movies off, and that's no lie. But since then....what? Okay, Dreamgirls, but that was a supporting role in a Broadway hit. So, what's going on? Is it you? Are you hard to work with? Is it your agent? Is it that you simply don't care and only want to collect a paycheck? I wish I knew. I wish you knew so you could correct it. In the end, you know I'll watch your next movie because I still believe you have another home run inside of you. Don't give up and don't throw your talent away, Eddie. I'll be cheering for you.

4720660,4,B005LAIGJQ,"I went in seriously worried that Eddie Murphy lost a few steps thanks to the disaster that is Tower Heist, but the reality is that Eddie Murphy is a more suitable and hilarious comedian when the attention is on him moreso than anyone else.  Or perhaps my hatred for Ben Stiller played a part in my dissatisfaction for that movie.

What makes A Thousand Words so wonderful is the subtle approach to comedy.  It doesn't seem subtle at first and in fact, initially seems like another pitiful attempt at humor that misses the mark (just like Tower Heist unforgivably proves).  However as soon as Eddie visits the spiritual guru and especially when the mysterious tree of life forms in his back yard one evening, this is when the introduction to the storyline gets underway- that being, Eddie quickly finds out that he's not allowed to speak more than a thousand words or he will... I guess die.  I don't remember if that was ever stated outright or not.

Another funny element (and this is surprising to me) is one of Eddie's workmates who's a dorky, talkative guy with a big mouth who happens to always find himself in hilarious situations with Eddie which especially become evident as soon as Eddie is forced to go through his 3-day period of using as little words as possible, so Eddie's facial expressions become a focal point.  More humor follows whenever Eddie communicates with his wife as they (or rather, she) discusses marriage and home problems.  Again, Eddie has to keep quiet!  The way he orders food at the uptown restaurant provides additional humor as the cashier guy has to figure out what Eddie's trying to order through hand movements and facial expressions, lol.

With a really creative way of slowly building the humor through interesting storytelling, perhaps I shouldn't be so shocked that the ending -the part where Eddie visits his mom who happens to have memory loss problems and insists Eddie is actually her husband- is so effectively moving.  I was *almost* in tears in one particular spot.  I won't reveal what it is that makes it so moving, though.  Great writing there.  I also felt sadness whenever Eddie was forced to speak and leaves would fall off the tree in his back yard.  The writing makes it sad, not funny.

Overall, Eddie rebounds after the pitiful Tower Heist with a really great movie.",1348358400,,2326,4.748756218905473

4720894,5,B005LAIGJQ,"I don't think anything could quite have prepared me for this movie. For Eddie Murphey to have done this type of movie I think I am still stumped. It definitely makes you think about your time here on earth and to definitely choose your words alot more carefully. Just think. 1,ooo words is all you have to say before you die, that is 10 words to only 100 people. It does not seem fair when it is broken down like that does it. Imagine if our lives were really ran like  that. Its unthinkable for me to even fathom.",1344902400,,514,4.191919191919192
4720895,4,B005LAIGJQ,"I think a lot of other reviewers have hit the nail on the head. This movie has a lot of potential. It's got some humor, as well as some surprisingly heartwarming moments. Eddie Murphy is past his prime, but he still manages to give enough to make the touching scenes work. The conclusion is as surprising as it is useful to remember.

However, the final product is a 3.5 star film rather than a 5 star one. The humor sometimes just doesn't work. Much of it is Eddie Murphy going over the top, which doesn't really work as well when you're trying to combine humor with a heartwarming story. However, what really undermines the film is that too often too many of the characters make ridiculously stupid choices. If you really only had 1,000 words left to speak before you die, wouldn't you use a few of those words to immediately tell your wife what's going on? Wouldn't you call in sick for work? The whole plot seems poised to put Eddie Murphy into silly situations, but with a bit more creativity the scriptwriters could have written a more compelling and believable story.",1344816000,,1074,4.564766839378239

Yes, the plot is somewhat poignant and trys to get a little deeper towards the end, but I felt this movie fell short of what I expect from Eddie Murphy. Also, it amazes me the language that passes for PG-13.

This was brought about because we recently read where, I believe his name is Mr. Boce (Amazon CEO), came out in support of gay marriage and backed it up by contributing several hundred million dollars to this cause.  Since we cannot and will not support this behavior, and since Mr. Boce gets his funds to do this from us, we are exercising our freedom of speech and our religious beliefs to no longer support Amazon.",1344297600,2,698,4.387596899224806

But the writer and director have shown us how do we mind our words when silence is golden and there is some cost attached to the words spoken even in anger, sorrow or happiness. I liked this movie not because of the cast or the laughter, but for the simple concept of silence and be controlled in all situations that change mercilessly. Eddie proves his talent once again in this movie and made me laugh aloud in some scenes Ex: the Starbucks - Extra Milk conversation.

I enjoyed this movie and started thinking, what if god counts my good words and bad words and punish me as appropriate. Sounds funny and weird but again, this is just a thought!",1344211200,,693,4.372093023255814

4721005,2,B005LAIGJQ,"I looked forward to this movie when I heard about it but now that I've seen it, I'm sorry to say that it was a waste of time. Eddie Murphy basically played himself as usual, complete with melodramatic Jim Carrey-like hysterics that detracted from the story. Chris Curtis played a condescending, New Age guru whose smugness made me want to punch him out. The only likable character was Eddie Murphy's nerdy, awkward assistant Erin Wiseberger who was played by an admirably awkward Clark Duke.

More importantly, the plot was completely unbelievable. Why would Murphy and the tree die? Wouldn't the tree simply grow more leaves?

Unfortunately, the director, screenwriters and Mr. Murphy wasted  a golden opportunity to make a funny and poignant film about listening and finding inner peace in a hectic and rushed world. Much better movies that explore these themes are Robert Redford's The Horse Whisperer, co-starring Robert Redford and Kristen Scott Thomas and Iain Softley's K-Pax, co-starring Jeff Bridges and Kevin Spacey. I highly reccomend these beautiful and powerful movies over this failed attempt any day.",1343692800,,1115,5.217877094972067
4721006,2,B005LAIGJQ,"The movie was just ok. It had too much profanity and adult innuendo to be considered a family movie. Which confuses me, since the message at the end was positive. There were only a few funny parts. It was definitely more drama than comedy.",1343692800,2,239,4.454545454545454

4721008,2,B005LAIGJQ,"Though I like Eddie Murphy, unsurprisingly,  A Thousand Words is not one of Eddie Murphy's classic roles  that left me laughing.  It has a laugh here and there, but for the most part the movie fails on comedy. Overall, the movie did have a a powerful message, but the sudden shift from  comedy to drama made me wonder if the movie would not have been better suited as a drama .",1343088000,2,377,4.267605633802817
4721009,5,B005LAIGJQ,"This was a very hilarious movie
I guess for those who rated it lower just weren't in the mood for a funny,
but in my opinion its a Great Movie.",1342828800,,143,3.8
4721010,4,B005LAIGJQ,"In my opinion good comedians always seem to get themselves into movies that don't really show just how funny they are. Leaving them to take on roles that just leave you bewildered. From ""Norbit"" to ""Daddy Day Care"" to ""Dr. Dolittle"" Eddie Murphy has taken on a string of movies that didn't do a good job of exemplifying his comedic value. A Thousand Words, in my opinion, is a breathe of fresh air compared to some of Eddie's other works.

This is one of those movies where the overall message can be different for each viewer. For me the overall message was not only to watch what you say, but to fully understand how powerful words can be. Jack McCall (Eddie) has no grasp of this concept, he talks continuously constantly trying to manipulate people to do what he feels is best for him, and in the end it winds up being his downfall.

One thing that really bothered me while watching this film was Jack's wife Caroline (Kerry Washington.) Everything about her character just irritated me. Jack was unable to talk so she automatically took it as he didn't want to talk to her and went to the conclusion that he didn't love her. Then when they were in the hotel and she was trying to find the ""spark"" in their ""broken relationship"" she tried to get him to talk. It was clear he wanted to talk and it was clear he was having some sort of internal struggle regarding it, but she paid all that no mind and walked out with his clothes. I don't know why it bothered me so much, it just did. Probably because I know there are some women out there who do in fact react like that.

I did feel they pushed the limits regarding the PG-13 rating. The profanity is a little more frequent compared to some other PG-13 films, you see Jack flip off the tree, and you see his wife dressed in a sexual role-playing outfit. Some material parents might find inappropriate for their young teens.

Overall Score: 7/10 - As I said compared to some of Eddie's other works this is pretty enjoyable. It's not perfect, and some parts do come off stale, but overall it's a good comedy film. As a stand-up comedian I feel Eddie is hilarious, but he always seems to come up short when he's in a movie.",1342569600,,2173,4.384615384615385
4721011,5,B005LAIGJQ,"There is a lot more to this movie than just comedy. Yeah, there are a few scenes that could have been cut a little shorter...the silent movie feel...but those scenes are there to exaggerate the feel of how difficult it can be to change ones ways. Jack must find a different way to express himself and approach life.

He is a fast talker (a B.S.er who can sell any idea). He has not really changed or grown up in life and it shows in the way he relates to those closes to him.

He lies to the spiritual teacher Dr. Sinja in order to be his book agent. A Bodhi tree suddenly appears in Jack's backyard once Dr. Sinja agrees to let him be his agent.

The connection between Jack and the Bodhi tree? Think Tree of Life or his soul. Whatever happens to the tree happens to Jack. When Jack carelessly runs his mouth the tree loses its leaves.

Jack is desperate. Jack sits under the Bodhi tree.

There is a beautiful Dharma story here. Yes, its a movie with a message. And if you can get pass just a few tiny awkward scenes of silence...very few and small, it really is a beautiful film and worth watching and enjoying.

You will laugh. You will be touched. And if you are lucky you may come away a bit more thoughtful.",1342396800,,1213,4.229437229437229

4721089,4,B005LAIGJQ,"I just RedBoxed this movie on the strength of the previews and at first it was not looking like it was going to be very good.  No I did not feel like I was going to turn it off but I was not getting very amused either.  Some of what was supposed to be funny amounted more to Murphy's character making a fool of himself in a way that made my viewing experience awkward.  I actually felt embarrassed for the character.  There were some funny parts but the movie takes a turn into some very emotional tear-jerking territory that overshadows the comedy element.  Another reviewer compares this movie to Adam Saddler's ""Click"" effectively beating me to that comparison.  With a little editing, this film could easily be made into a Family Movie as it explores the elements of ""finding oneself"" and finding what really matters before it's too late - not necessarily actual death but losing out on what really matters but yet is taken for granted until it's gone, you know, the ages old ""You never know what you have until it's gone"".

A pet-peeve of mine was the dumb Starbuck's Batista being a huge Beatles fan but even this becomes part of the emotional element of this movie when Jack McCall, who is normally 100% self-absorbed and not able to see a foot ahead of his own hide, is moved to find and buy an original pressing of the White Album on vinyl - possibly a pretty penny.  For McCall, this would be akin to ""Hell freezing over"".  As the few remaining leaves fall away, Jack is coming to value what he never gave as much a parting glance prior to the ""curse"".  We see how time wasted on petty things such as cutting ahead in a long line for coffee, fighting to keep the house of his dreams or not getting his car parked under a tree come back to haunt him and become sources of regret that may very well be etched in stone.  The tree ends up losing all of it's leaves.  Of course this has to be a funny movie with a happy ending.  However, we know that reality does not usually afford us that luxury!!!!",1341187200,4,2006,4.360215053763441

And then we proceeded to write the words that best describe the movie.

Happy Words: hysterical, funny, insightful, forgiving, silent
Sad: death, silent, unhappy, alone
Mad: yelling, furious, angry

I have always been a big Eddie Murphy fan and I was looking forward to this one. I was surprised at how heartfelt and emotional this movie turned out to be. While this is a definite comedy and is very funny the real heart of the movie is the emotion that Murphy shows during his change. On that note, while I'm not saying this is an Oscar worthy performance this is his best acting since ""Dreamgirls"". Seems like just because it is a comedy the acting gets overlooked which isn't really fair. Murphy's performance was so perfect for this movie it took a movie that could have been very cheesy and fluffy and turned it into something so heartfelt and emotional that I actually got choked up a few times. For that to happen during a comedy is a testament to his acting. Overall, a very funny movie with a ton of heart that deserves to be seen. I really liked this one.
