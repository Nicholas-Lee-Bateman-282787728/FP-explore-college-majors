Not only does it reveal how our dollar bill came about, but it identifies all the key figures involved! Those included are some of the most famous of American history taught to us in grade school!  On top of that, it reveals the true intentions of our politicians and those that influence America's policies, and takes it all the way to present time, to where our most powerful leaders intend to take us! Without a doubt, mind-blowing!!!! An absolute must-see for anyone who cares about our country and our future!",1237766400,16,604,4.864077669902913
3771547,5,B001QXWFMQ,This DVD does reveal some little-known history apparently involving mystics and high-level politics. It will be up to the viewer whether the connections are all that sinister or just politics as usual behind the scenes. A very interesting documentary nonetheless.,1237420800,3,263,5.6
3771548,5,B001QXWFMQ,"When I watch a Chris Pinto documentary, I'm often reminded of James Burke's ""Connections"" TV show.  Previously unseen dots begin to connect until a vivid picture is formed.  As he has in previous series, Chris has presented ""Eye of the Phoenix""  by drawing out elements obscure to the layman.  Each element is sequentially building upon the previous until the obvious is revealed.

 And I think ""revealed"" is the appropriate word.  Too often documentaries force evidence upon the viewer.  Pinto, however, in his wise manner lays the information out on the table, but leaves the conclusion for the viewer to self-construct.  Perhaps a risky formula save for his extensive research that all but eliminates the ""Yea, but.""

 ""Eye of the Phoenix"" is the third installment of a successful series.  It continues to sift suppressed information and blend it with that which is so obvious - yet unseen.  Challenge your intellect, discover, connect the dots, and draw your conclusion. With such a wealth of information, I'm sure you will view it numerous times. Each viewing confirming the next as you absorb the fruits of an earnest labor.

  I'll not speak so to give the story away.  But I will encourage you that there is a STORY to be heard - for sure.",1236816000,22,1247,4.8619047619047615

3771550,5,B001QXWFMQ,"Once again the people at Antiquities Research Films and producer Christian J. Pinto have put together an incredible and compelling documentary revealing stunning facts about the history of our American currency, specifically the dollar bill. From the background of those intimately involved in the design of the dollar bill, to the hidden symbolism found within its design, and their meanings, you'll be intrigued by the thorough fact-finding mission that takes you on the journey of the dollar's inception to what is currently in circulation today. You'll hear expert analysis and testimonies which thoughtfully lend credibility to what some believe to be a well thought out agenda within our country's borders.

3771565,2,B001QXWFMQ,"Typical immature interpretation of History, found among fearful and ignorant fundies.

This film (and many others like it) attempts to attribute dark and sinister motivations behind the founding of this country's governing structure and the exact opposite is true. To understand the regalia, symbols, esoterica and hidden meaning behind those symbols requires decades of study, not a few months or years working on a book (or video) bent on convincing consumers that Freemasonry or other similar groups are somehow ""hiding something""; ever the puerile agenda of uninformed and uneducated reactionaries who fear what they do not properly perceive.

Regardless of who influenced (and continues to influence) the evolution of our great American society, the Founding Fathers were absolutely resolute to prevent any sort of religious domination within US governing structure. Every western country on earth before that was poisoned with religious domination (primarily foisted by Rome), and today fundies and dominionists would take us right back to the middle ages if they could.
The Constitution prevents them from doing so.

The Constitution is NOT ""Christian"", never has been. It is designed to protect ALL religions and to preserve any one's particular belief system from being overrun by those like the producers of this film, who attempt to make it appear as if our government was once ""Christian"" and is now ""secular"".

It was ALWAYS secular, and regardless of how many of us hold precious PRIVATE religious beliefs, our government always will be secular
This protects those very religious beliefs.

Thank God for Freemasonry and the Founding Fathers, and those who continue to discipline, reprimand and rebuke the childlike reactions of the fundies, who think that anything non-Christian is demonic and who all share the great weakness of needing their particular religious beliefs enshrined into public law because they each do not have the strength to stand alone in their convictions.",1449100800,,1992,5.412903225806452

3771572,4,B001QXWFMQ,"I have been a Mason for 40 years (a good move) and found this interesting although some of it I had certainly never heard of such as the grand plan of Masons to build another King Solomon's temple though l certainly can't say it isn't true I don't think it is going to happen.

The main lesson in Masonry revolves around the building of King Solomon's Temple and why it wasn't finished.

  As far as the stuff about the dollar bill is concerned I don't doubt but what is probably largely true but I think there is some theorizing involved there, too.

  Masonry nearly a hundred years ago was far different than it is now. Masons were everywhere in government, local and federal, and wielded a lot of power. This of course no longer nearly as true.

The reason I give it a 4 is because it could have been an hour shorter even though most of it was interesting it got a long ways from the subject of the dollar bill in the title. They discussed the stone and cornerstone far to long as far as I was concerned but of course that is because it didn't particularly interest me.  I would have sure liked to see a lot more of the interior of that building.

In the end I was really not sure about what is so terrible about the dollar bill, in fact I find they are pretty handy to have around so I'm going keep on spending them and at times collecting them.

 I wish that is was possible to do true documentary of what is going to be left of the world in a 100 years at the rate they going which is barely the length of time covered by this film. On the other hand I guess I really don't want to know, sort of like I really don't want to know what moment I am going to expire.",1441238400,6,1669,4.101538461538461

You could disagree with it and say it is just a coincidence, but if you believe in biblical prophecy, you should see that this is no coincidence. We can see that these useless symbols were paramount to the FDR whitehouse and FDR himself were passionate about their use in the print, but why? Then it explains the origins of the symbols which means FDR and Henry Wallace were passionate about the meanings of the symbols. It also ties into the forming of the United Nations and all of the problems in the world today will make perfect sense when you see what is leading it. Remember, the most evil one works in deception,  not in plain site. To say the least, this little piece of history does well to support the book of revelations without referencing the bible at all, unless my memory has failed me.

But, please, let me be an example to all who read this review. Don't stop with this video and accept all that is says because they seemingly have proof and put together a well done documentary (which it is and then some). Do the research for yourself, without believing every cornball conspiracy theory out there, and believe me there are a WHOLE LOT out there. Eat the meat and spit out the bones as a friend from Nigeria told me so many years ago. most Importantly, you HAVE TO weigh everything in light of God's word, the Bible. Without that, you will just have another tale to spin with no real hope in the end. Jesus is that Hope.
Col 1:23  If ye continue in the faith grounded and settled, and be not moved away from the hope of the gospel,......
Col 1:27  To whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles; which is Christ in you, the hope of glory:

3771625,1,B001QXWFMQ,"I was very surprised when I actually sat down to watch this. It not only goes into the occult's ""history"" with the dollar, it goes into the stories and beliefs of those who supposedly changed it. The problem is with the proof. A huge amount of this DVD is based off of ""this might have been where they changed the dollar bill"" and ""could this have been how this happened?"" Most information is based off of facts that can be proved, but the theories about the facts are where things start to get obscure.

Fact: Roerich was the ""spiritual guru"" of Roosevelt and Wallace, even though they rarely met or communicated.
Pinto's Theory: This means that Roerich MUST have been involved in the design of the dollar bill, regardless of having no proof for this claim. And since we are supposed to buy this theory without question, Pinto also wants us to believe that they must have done it in Roerich's personal shrine at his place at the top of the Master Building.

Another reason why I gave this DVD a bad rating is because I think the information given about the markings on the dollar bill is a little silly. Doc Marquis is known for being a very eccentric when he speaks about secret societies even among hardcore conspiracy theorists, and he is the guy who was chosen to show the marking on the dollar bill. He certainly shows markings that are there, but it's pretty obvious that he added some markings that he thinks are there. Searching and searching and searching for hidden markings will only lead you to hidden markings, and I think that he showed some things that aren't really there. However, Pinto did give a sort of disclaimer that ""there is no way to prove what Marquis is saying,"" but it's pretty obvious that Pinto and the producers of this DVD take every word of Doc Marquis as fact.

The first two parts of this serious were pretty good, but this one was based on mostly unprovable theories and certainly misrepresented facts.",1339718400,3,1939,4.582132564841499

3771627,2,B001QXWFMQ,"Using the innocuous cover of Antiquities Research, a fundamentalist Christian group examines the dollar bill and the symbols on it and the signs it contains. This carefully directed but at times ham-handed documentary ends with the claim that the Illuminati founded by Adam Weishaupt in 1770s and other occultists determined what was to go on the US dollar bill. That dollar is purportedly loaded with satanic/Luciferian imagery imbedded there as a kind of self-congratulatory, ""Ooh, look what we are getting away with"" secret code. The New World Order will arise like a phoenix from the collapsed United States, a collapse planned and guided by the satanic world leaders behind the scenes in league with their demons. The DVD maintains that the leaders of Theosophy, namely, Blavatsky and her disciples, especially Nicholas Roerich and his wife Helena, were used by a demon Morya [mispronounced `mor-eye-ah' in the DVD] to influence VP Henry Wallace and Pres. Franklin Roosevelt to put the great seal along with other Masonic symbols on the dollar bill. The implication is that mere human fantasy and folly coupled with big money could not have pulled this off. There not only had to be a demon behind it but ones named by the producers as Lucifer and 'Mor-eye-ah"" ---give me a break. I have been tracking the Morya character since ""he"" appeared out of Madame Blavatsky's occult imagination in the late 19th century. Morya is no more a demon than are Bambi and Tinker Bell.

I think the point of the film is to alert a cult of evangelical Christians that their interpretation of Revelation and prophecy is true, that as a result of forces predicted in a particularly vain reading of the New Testament, Jerusalem will indeed become a bloodbath at Armageddon, and that in the end their version of Christ will reign in heaven and hell. The film wants us to surmise, as is usual with these biased, predictive attempts [Left Behind series anyone?] that the ""end times"" will happen within the lifetime of the producers and preachers that promote the book or film. How self-centered is that?

The Eye of the Phoenix: Secrets of the Dollar Bill is a testament to nothing more than the simplemindedness of producers David Bay and Christian Pinto and their cohorts. As a Christian, I feel sorry for Louis Buff Parry, the Jewish scholar and code breaker who provides much of the accurate narrative weight for the film--he appears to have been used [tricked?] into supporting this specious agenda. I have a long running interest [not as a devotee] in Nicholas Roerich [who is centrally featured] and Theosophy, since 1975 to be exact, so I found Parry to be dependable enough on most counts regarding Roerich. He seems to have some confusion however as to who painted certain portraits of Nicholas Roerich when he names wife Helena instead of their fine artist son Svetslav who did the work.",1277078400,5,2880,4.91170431211499

3771629,5,B001QXWFMQ,"This is the third volume in series. It deals for the most part with the occult history surrounding Great Seal on the dollar bill.
While there is lot of new information presented, some stuff you probably already know. For instance, even though the dollar bill says 'In God we trust', the question is: of which 'God/god' does it speak? Of course it is plainly evident that pyramid with an all-seeing eye is NOT a Christian symbol. So, the Christian origin of the seal is ruled out.
Well, if you interested in this subject, and especially if you seen two previous films in the series, you might want to see this one as well.

Of course, you will have to make your own judgment about the information presented. It may be true, partially true, or mostly false. I don't think I am qualified to say much in regard to the information presented, but some data is simply historical and deals with geography and specific people. For instance, a person still can visit a museum of Roerich, and they do affirm that Roerich had his part in designing a dollar bill. For instance, a person at museum said "" ... to have that Mason symbol put on the dollar bill, so that every resident of the US is connected to Rorich through the dollar bill."" So, there is no hidden conspiracy or anything about that. It is plain and simple.

Generally speaking, it was informative even though I recognize that there is a room for dispute on some topics presented. I recommend you to take it with a grain of salt, but nevertheless to watch it (if this sort of material is of interest to you).

3771630,5,B001QXWFMQ,"Eye of the Phoenix gives information on the dollar bill that you will not find in any other documentary.  Incredibly, this film refutes ideas that the symbols on our currency are not based in the occult, proving that they were put there by men who saw them as Satanic/Luciferian icons.  I don't want to reveal too much, but this is proven beyond any doubt.

FDR and his Secretary of Agriculture, Henry Wallace (both 32nd degree Freemasons at the time) surrounded themselves with a collection of Theosophists, Masons and Rosicrucians -- among whom was Russian mystic, Nicholas Roerich.  Lots of info. on Roerich and his ecumenical paintings which were designed to introduce Eastern Mysticism to Western culture -- to promote universal archetypes that would inspire a global consciousness.  The film also reveals how Roerich was the one who, as the ""guru"" to Henry Wallace, influenced the placement of the Great Seal on the back of the dollar bill.

""Phoenix"" is the third part in the documentary series, ""Secret Mysteries of America's Beginnings"" -- and many are saying this is the best of the three.  This is partly because the film also addresses our current economic crisis, something predicted by researchers for years, long before anyone even knew who Barack Obama was.  The film suggests that the symbolism of the eagle is really a cleverly disguised Phoenix, the ancient mythical bird that destroys itself by fire.  Strong evidence is presented that this symbol implies the intentional destruction of the U.S. dollar by secret societies, who plan to use the collapse of our currency as an opportunity to create a global economy, in order to further the New World Order.

Also fascinating is the research into the Stone of Destiny, a legendary artifact that Roerich claimed to have in his possession, and which Henry Wallace wrote about.  In the occult, the stone is said to have come from the crown of the archangel Lucifer, and is supposed to empower world unity.  Some occultists claim that Roerich gave part of the stone to the League of Nations for this purpose.",1238112000,9,2072,4.956647398843931
