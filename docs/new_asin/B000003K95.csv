7902567,4,B000003K95,"The war with the Dominion has started, so it is time at DS9 for Constable Odo (Rene Auberjonois) to fall in love with a mysterious woman on ""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine,"" Episode 115, ""A Simple Investigation"" (Written by Rene Echevarria, March 31, 1997).  Odo meets Arissa (Dey Young) in Quarks and is impressed by her powers of observation (it is all mental with the Constable) but surprised when she is arrested for trying to break into the station's computer.  She spins a sob story about trying to find the daughter she gave up 15 years earlier and then her contact shows up murdered.  By now the pattern should be clear, because this episode is in the great tradition of ""The Maltese Falcon,"" which means Arissa's story changes every five minutes with each new development.  This woman might lie with every breath she takes, but Odo is attracted to Arissa and if you have been wondering what a Changeling is like when making love, then this episode is going to give you a chance to find out (sort of).
There is a nice twist with Arissa's character in regards to a data crystal that keeps coming into play in the developing mystery, but the chief attraction here is supposed to be the idea that Odo, who has been pining for Kira lo these many years, suddenly falls hard and fast for a bad woman from the wrong side of the Alpha Quadrant.  Clearly, I do not buy this, and if it were not for the aforementioned twist, I would have rated this a star lower, because if we are talking about heartbreaking moments with Odo we have already done this a couple of times with Kira and once with Lwaxana Troi, so this one just suffers in comparison.",1073433600,2,1641,4.493288590604027
7902568,4,B000003K95,"We all know one of these episodes about Odo was coming for along time now. I'm a sucker for these kind of episodes where a character that we all love falls in love with someone who actually loves them back and this episode is a good example. In the first scene between Odo and Arissa in Quark's is where we learn alot very qucikly,that Arissa is attracted to Odo,with a hint with comment about his ""bedroom eyes"" and that she's impressed because unlike everyone else in Quark's,Odo isn't trying to pick her up. Later,Odo is peering at his reflection to see whether or not Arissa's statement is true and I found it a really sweet scene. In the later scene it made perfect sense that Odo would be really shy and hesitant when he and Arissa kiss for the first time(and we all know what happened during the break).We see them later in bed together talking and Odo is trying to figure out what makes Arissa so different enough to take his feelings to the next level. It's here that Arissa learns that Odo just gave her his virginity. I really loved Odo's question whether she could tell if he was a virgin or not. After that,the episode kinda goes downhill when we find out who Arissa really is and poor Odo has to suffer his first(or second)broken heart. The chemistry between Rene Auberjonois and Dey Young was wonderful. My favourite DS9 episode.",1038787200,4,1344,4.534979423868313
7902569,2,B000003K95,"This is a love episode, booooo, with Odo, booooo, yes those crazy folks at Paramount have decided to give Odo a touch of solid-love, and it doesn't  look pretty. On his way out of Quark's Odo meets a woman at the bar, wink  wink, she is called Arissa. But like everything related to Odo she is a  criminal. Basically our Changeling has to protect Arissa from some other  criminals and love blossoms - they even sleep together! Ahhhhhh!
Odo  loses his virginity! Ahhhhhhhhhhh! This episode is awful, there is a nice  scene where Kira and Sisko discuss Odo's new found love in which Kira comes  across as being very jealous but all in all a pretty lame attempt.",966729600,5,659,4.533898305084746
