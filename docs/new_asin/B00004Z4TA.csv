7928155,4,B00004Z4TA,this is kind of a weird movie but well made for the time. It's more artistic than a scary movie. There is no dialogue in the movie except some narration from a young McMahon. Some people will probably hate it and some people will think its pretty cool.,1513123200,,252,4.270833333333333
7928156,4,B00004Z4TA,"I had never heard of this movie then stumbled across it thru a review on a movie website.  After watching it, I was impressed, and it felt ""fresh"" to me. Is it a Lost Classic?  I'm not sure. It's GOOD. It's also an under-your-skin type of film. It's a pretty compact piece of expressionistic horror. It's shot great. It's focused. It makes you wonder what directors might have originally seen it. David Lynch? Guy Madden?

As a mid-century film, I'm surprised at how firmly this sits between a real silent horror classic like The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari and later horrors like Repulsion and Blue Velvet. It's really creative. I can actually see why it was censored at the time. Also, as a gay man, I'm not sure if anyone might notice the blunt undercurrent of the sexuality running thru the piece - but this Gamin, though nominally inferred to be a prostitute or someone stumbling into a night of exploitation, is played by the actress with unrepentant dykeiness!  Her demeanor, backstory and seeming contempt for the perverse male characters surrounding her - play that she is actually a wayward lesbian. There's lots of subtle details in the film. Being shot almost entirely on-loction, it's also a nifty time capsule, feeling more authentic to encapsulating the 1950s than a popular film noir.

I'm a fan of Pandora's Box, Night Tide, Carnival of Souls and film noir. If you like anything like that, this is a great film to see.",1499126400,,1431,4.730923694779117
7928157,4,B00004Z4TA,"Avant-garde, unusual film. Interesting amateurish early 1950's attempt at psychological filmmaking, but Antheill's music, Shorty Rogers with his jazz group, and professionally done eerie vocals by Marni Nixon are world-class and as far from amateurish as you can get. If you want to go ""off the rails"" for a while, or if you are just a fan of avant-garde filmmaking, view ""Dementia"". Good extras are included on the disc.",1430956800,,421,5.115942028985507
7928158,1,B00004Z4TA,"With all due respect to the others who have reviewed this movie and given it very favorable ratings - WHAT????? As stated, though made in 1957 this movie is entirely without dialouge. Some VOICE OF DOOM inserted narration is interspersed through out. The direction is bottom of the barrel, the acting horrible. The plot.... what plot???? I understand that the movie is an on going dream (nightmare) but still, that doesn't give it carte blanche to be idiotic. Then of course the twist (bend/fold/mutilate) ending. How shocking (sarcasm). All in all, this would have been a terrific selection for Mystery Science Theatre to spoof, it's just so pretentious and awful. My recommendation - skip the movie and spend that hour shampooing your carpeting instead. Dementia/Daughter of Horror gets my vote as the worst movie ever made.",1290211200,4,826,5.080882352941177
7928159,5,B00004Z4TA,"A film so rich in history and music that it's mandatory viewing for any educated person! You might get 187 channels on your satellite receiver, but none of them are showing anything this cool!!!",1229212800,3,194,4.735294117647059
7928160,5,B00004Z4TA,"Like others, I had read about this film for years, and seen the clips in The Blob, but never actually saw the whole movie until buying this DVD. It's such an anachronism, coming from the early 1950s, that it took a couple of viewings for me to be able to be objective about it. Compared to 99% of movies of its time it's quite avant-garde, from it's lurid content to its circular, dreamlike story structure, its complete lack of dialogue, expressionist use of photography and locations, Freudian symbolism, etc. There are moments of brilliance, and comparisons to Bunuel, Cocteau, Lynch, and Welles are not wholly unwarranted. (Is it possible that David Lynch never saw the 'chicken eating' scene?) On the downside, it suffers in some of the same ways that other low-budget indies of the time do, particularly in the pacing and the acting. The female lead in particular (the director's neice) just doesn't have any charisma whatsoever, and she and others mug broadly at times, attempting to convey emotion and plot without words. This could have been a landmark film with a capable actress in the lead. As it is, it's an extremely interesting experiment that also holds up to multiple viewings. John Parker definitely gets an A for effort, daring, and vision. The execution's just a little uneven.
Kino's DVD presents both the silent, unedited Dementia and the minimally narrated, edited Daughter of Horror. I found the narrated version not necessarily much worse (except of course for the cuts) but just different in tone, more 'campy.' Purists will probably stick with the original cut. The supplements include a trailer (for Daughter of Horror), still gallery, and detailed production history. The prints show some light speckling, but otherwise exhibit very good tonal values, sharpness, and detail. This movie is not for everyone, but if you're into avant-garde, film noir, B&W 50s indies, exploitation, or offbeat horror you'll probably find it rewarding.",1005350400,18,1961,5.093167701863354
7928161,5,B00004Z4TA,"I purchased the DVD of DEMENTIA expecting campy fun and came away genuinely moved. DEMENTIA is much more than a bargain-basement horror film; it has those elements to be sure, but it is also a legitimate heir to German Expressionism, from its Freudian psychological symbolism to the chiaroscuro lighting and the stylized gestures of the actors. The film has no dialogue, only sound effects and a music score--not unlike the soundtracks made for late silent-era films such as SUNRISE. The characters are nameless types: the ""Gamin,"" who appears to be a prostitute; ""Evil One,"" the pimp and nightclub owner; ""Rich Man,"" and so on. The film, however, is Expressionism as filtered back through Film Noir visual and narrative devices of the time.
While watching it, I noted a little sadly that few ""independent"" filmmakers today would be willing to take such creative risks. Compare this to recent films like THE BROTHERS MCMULLEN and tell me which director has more imagination and style, which director can do more with a low budget!
As much as I love it, DEMENTIA is not perfect. The actors, especially the lead, are not always up to the unusual task of expressing everything through pantomime. The music score, while it's often eerie and effective, can be repetitive at times. But the director, John Parker (his sole film), compensates with sheer force of imagination and clarity of conception. The story is tightly structured and moves briskly during the film's 60 minute running time. The black and white cinematography is beautiful and atmospheric, making full use of the seedy storefronts in Venice, California--before Welles' TOUCH OF EVIL, as the supplemental materials note.
My five star rating is for the total DVD package. The transfer of DEMENTIA is suprisingly crisp and detailed for a film of its age, budget and production history--indeed, better than I could have expected. DAUGHTER OF HORROR, the censored and re-worked version, is included as well, making for an interesting comparison. Bret Wood at Kino deserves kudos for the censorship history and press clippings which he put together for the DVD.
DEMENTIA is a unique film; if you have a taste for offbeat fare, it will satisfy your appetite in ways you never imagined! This is easily one of the most rewarding DVDs I have purchased in quite a while.",987552000,16,2320,5.0285714285714285
7928162,5,B00004Z4TA,"This film is one of the strongest works of dark, horror-tinged surrealist cinema you will ever see, done with a startlingly powerful night-time evocation of the seedy backstreets of Los Angeles. It is the artistic equal of Luis Bunuel, though due to its low-budget exploitation-film origins does not have the respect it immensely deserves.  The low budget only serves to improve the disturbing, grimy quality of the desparate lives depicted in its stark story. I have watched this film repeatedly for its ambience and atmosphere, as well as its purely cinematic use of images. It is certainly one of the purest ""nightmare"" films ever made, partly because it uses only images and no words at all to create a shadowy and frightening world. Also, the film score is by one of the most talented composers of the 20th century, George Antheill, who was a serious modernist classical composer. The music is continuous and perfect from beginning to end - a feat rarely matched by any other film composers. For people interested in film noir, horror, or surrealism, you must have this motion picture!",983836800,13,1090,4.956284153005464
