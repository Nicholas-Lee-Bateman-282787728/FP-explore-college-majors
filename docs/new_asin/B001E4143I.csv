8296235,5,B001E4143I,"I could not be more pleased with this set.  Daniel Boone was always a favorite of my family when I was growing up.

I would recommend that anyone that enjoys good family entertainment should buy this set.

I look forward to many more pleasurable hours of watching these movies, several times over.

Keep up the good work of making this type of movies available for the next generations to enjoy.

If kids had this stuff to watch on network TV, the country would be in better shape.",1263600000,,130,4.24
8296237,5,B001E4143I,"This series is great. Just as I remember them as a boy. Now my son and I enjoy watching them together. He can't get enough of D. Boone. He has a coon skin cap that we wears while watching. I'm not big on allowing him to watch a lot of TV, but these shows are a lot better than the garbage that kids watch today. All the episodes have a story line with a moral dilemma, a choice to act responsibly or selfishly. I recommend them for an adventurous youngster, or an old guy like me.
They arrived promptly from the seller as promised. Good Service",1258416000,,544,4.1415094339622645
8296238,5,B001E4143I,Daniel Boone is a good family movie.  I have a 12 and 9 year old that can't wait to watch Daniel Boone each night.,1254787200,,114,3.75
8296239,4,B001E4143I,"With the exception of Disk 4 - Season 3, I have had no problems.  I am unhappy with this particular disk as When a Pawn is a King and Craw Greene is on there and those two stories do not play on my DVD player, nor on my computer.  The only story that I can view is The Symbol.  I am disappointed regarding that particular DVD.  I don't think that Liberation will replace the DVD however.",1252281600,,387,4.052631578947368
