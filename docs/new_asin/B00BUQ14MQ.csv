8574153,4,B00BUQ14MQ,"The 2 most exciting fights in this DVD are: Johny Hendricks vs Carlos Condit, and Jake Ellenberger vs Nate Marquardt. They are equal in skill and strength. So, the fights are well paced and interesting in all rounds. As for the fight between Hendricks and Carlos Candit, one of them kept got kicked in the head but he kept coming and punching. It's incredible.

All the other fights are one-sided. That makes them boring. The main event between Georges St Pierre and Nick Diaz is exactly like that.

It's better to watch it on Netflix or borrow the DVD than buying it.

In short, it's worth 4 stars.",1375142400,,599,4.527777777777778

8574155,1,B00BUQ14MQ,"I would've given this event two stars because of the Johnny Hendricks/Carlos Condit fight, but I could not in good conscience label the dvd as anything other than a one-star stinker full of human you-know-what.

-no behind-the-scenes feature

-no countdown show

-Didn't even include the walkouts for the main event

-didn't even include the post-fight interviews for the main event

Just an all around god-awful shell of a product, given what we've come to expect in the past.

The event itself, quite frankly...sucked. There's one fight on the entire card worth watching and that was the co-main event. I used to be a big GSP fan and still root for him in most of his fights, but I can no longer in good conscience recommend purchasing his events to anyone who expects to receive any sort of bang for their buck. He hasn't finished a fight in almost six years and most likely never will again for the rest of his career. Even when fighting a man whom he despised for insulting him on just about every personal and professional level possible, he was still unable or unwilling to come out of his protective stylistic shell and go for the kill. He's just content to dominate in safety-first fashion for five fairly monotonous rounds of repetitive jabs, evasive footwork, double leg takedowns and positional ground control.

At this point it just is what it is.

This event can be summed up with one simple statement: Mike Ricci vs. Colin Fletcher was the opening bout on the MAIN CARD.

And that's all I have to say about that.",1371772800,5,1527,4.689138576779026

8574157,4,B00BUQ14MQ,"UFC 158, thus far, is the best overall card of the year.  With the spectacle of a star studded Welterweight main card as the big draw of the evening it was highlighted by the personal matchup between champion Georges St-Pierre and Nick Diaz.  Not to be overshadowed though there were plenty of ranking and title implications in the co-main event and the fight beforehand.

First thing off the bat, I would like to make special notice of the prelims on this card.  A number of the prelims had amazing knockouts as well as what I thought at the time as a ""fight of the night"" contender in Cote/Voelker.  Watching the prelims live were great as this was the first time all year I was left with a firm impression on the beginnings of the night and the fighters that participated before the main card.  It's worth mentioning that over half of the fights are good crowd pleasers for various reasons and should be checked out if you get this set.

Unfortunately the main card started off with two fights that, while alright, didn't leave a memorable impression in my mind.  Both fights ended by decision and while they are certainly not bad fights they are overshadowed by the main fights of the night in terms of quality and excitement.  It may be due to the excitement for the coming fights but these just lacked the enthusiasm I thought they needed for the card to start off with a bang.

In the first big fight of the main card Jake Ellenberger welcomed returning Nate Marquardt back to the UFC.  Jake Ellenberger is one of those scary welterweights who I feel not enough people know about.  He has got dynamite in his hands, a trait people more readily attribute to fellow welterweight Johny Hendricks.  It may be hard to notice if you haven't followed him during his UFC career but more often than not he puts people away and in devastating fashion.  A good point, he's only the second man to ever finish current middleweight fighter Jake Shield, something not even Dan Henderson was able to pull off in his bout with Shields.  The man has devastating power and good wrestling, which is a typical nightmare for any fighter.  Marquardt was at one point a man many people believed would eventually challenge Anderson Silva for a second time before running into a roadblock known as Chael Sonnen.  Since then he never found the same success that made him a number one contender.  He eventually left the promotion then went to compete in the welterweight division of Strikeforce where he became the champion.  It looked like he was going to return to the UFC, following the announcement that the Strikeforce roster would be absorbed into the UFC, with a lot of momentum as their champion until he lost it to Tarec Saffiedine.  So, fresh off a lose Marquardt had a lot to prove in his return while Ellenberger was looking to solidify his place as one of the top of the division.  The fight itself is short, barely over the halfway mark for the first round.  Funny thing, not a whole lot of action to go off of really but boy when that finish occurs, damn.  Definitely one of the nastiest knockouts of the year, which is pretty impressive given the knockouts in the prelims.

I think it's worth saying that the co-main event was the fight a lot of hardcore fans had their eyes on.  Granted, St-Pierre/Diaz was the main draw but when it came down to what could be a damn good fight I'd like to think I wasn't alone in keeping my eye on this fight.  Carlos Condit is fresh off his loss to St-Pierre and while he didn't capture the title he gave the champion the hardest fight St-Pierre has had in a good long time.  Personally, I feel like he came off that fight strong in the same way Jon Fitch did years ago but in a much better way as he looked like a major threat for any welterweight in the division.  So, looking to get right back in title contention Condit takes on Johny Hendricks, a fighter most people believe is the true number one contender to the title.  He's a great wrestler but as I mentioned earlier he has become known more for the power he possesses in his hands then his wrestling pedigree.  If you don't know what I mean just watch the (short) fights with Jon Fitch and Martin Kampmann and you'll know what I mean.  So, you've probably heard that phrase, ""styles make fights"", right?  Well, this is definitely one of those cases.  Not only is this the ""fight of the night"" but I'd say that at this point it's the ""fight of the year"".  If there's someone reading this who has also seen the fight you may have a better sense of why this fight needed to be five rounds.  As much as I loved the action this fight certainly warranted another two rounds but I guess that's just my personal gripe as there were a number of technical details that I think are worth debating.  But, back to the main point, the fight is worth watching and the best reason for buying this DVD set.

In the main event we get the culmination of two years of back-and-forth.  Nick Diaz has spent the better part of two years calling out St-Pierre and most fans were clamoring for the fight.  Diaz had secured himself as the Strikeforce champion and wanted to cement himself as the best in the welterweight ranks by taking on the champion.  After a great performance against BJ Penn it looked like the fight was going to happen until St-Pierre went out with ACL injury.  Then when the interim title went to Carlos Condit Nick Diaz tested positive for marijuana use and got suspended for a year.  So, a successful title defense after returning for injury St-Pierre actually goes to Dana White and requests for this fight to happen, even though Diaz hadn't fought in a year and his last fight ended in a loss.  Most fans are able to recognize the professional that St-Pierre is so I think it was pretty evident just how badly he wanted this fight when he went out of his way for it to happen.  After what was a pretty heated pre-fight buildup fans were finally treated to the fight and the fighters wasted little time in going at each other.  The fight plays out fairly one-sided with one fighter looking pretty dominate for most of the fight.  Maybe it's due to the action in the co-main event but this fight didn't have the same kind of excitement I thought it would, but does show how good the victor is given the technical domination he demonstrated.  It's not a bad fight but far from the most exciting bout of the card.

Given how good two of the main fights were and how well the prelims played out I was pleasantly surprised by the play of the evening since it could have gone in an entirely different direction.  The event is worth a buy in my opinion, even though the main event wasn't everything fans were hoping for it was still a good main event to cap off what I think is the best card of the year thus far.  Hopefully this signals the kind of balance and quality we can expect to see for the rest of 2013.",1364601600,4,6898,4.453025477707007
