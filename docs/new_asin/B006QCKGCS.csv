8502971,5,B006QCKGCS,"If you want to see dharmendra in another james bond movie, then keemat is the one to see because it has him playing as a private investigating officer. The story is really interesting because it shows us almost everything about woman slavery and how they are illegally sold abroad in hopes of a more glamorous life. Overall I give this movie a two thumbs up if you're into action mixed with real emotions.",1325376000,,405,4.561643835616438
