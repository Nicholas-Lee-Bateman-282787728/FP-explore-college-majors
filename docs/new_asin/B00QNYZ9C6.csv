6877268,5,B00QNYZ9C6,"For those who couldn't afford to spring for the Deluxe Box Set of the Complete Series back in Fall 2013, here we have the Sixth and Final season of that guilty-pleasure treasure MAMA'S FAMILY. StarVista should be commended for releasing these single sets in such a timely manner following the big box set. It's been less than a year-and-a-half and all the stand-alone volumes are now available for those who want them.

The cast of MAMA'S FAMILY are still in top-form this final go-round and the consistent plot threads include Naomi and Vint's impending parenthood and Bubba's college antics. Some of my favorite episodes this season include MAMA'S MEDICINE SHOW in which Mama bottles and sells Miracle Tonic (watch for the scene at Church where Iola extols its' virtues); Mama becomes a radio consumer advocate to hilarious results in MAMA FIGHTS BACK; attends her High-School Reunion in A BLAST FROM THE PAST; and tries to impress a bunch of snooty society ladies in THERE IS NOTHING LIKE THE DAMES (which features Bubba in drag--sort of).

The final episode wraps things up nicely as Mama becomes a Grandma again to baby Tiffany-Thelma. It's a shame the show ceased production because the baby could have opened up new plot possibilities for another season. But perhaps it was for the best since this show NEVER Jumped the Shark. Although I prefer the crankier Mama of the early NBC era over the more hip, with-it, happy Mama found here, I highly recommend this season to complete your collection if you don't own the box set.",1422835200,21,1530,4.85823754789272
6877269,4,B00QNYZ9C6,"I was a little disappointed because this was not the entire season. Otherwise, it was fine. Mama is always a scream to watch and the theme song sticks in your head.",1495670400,,164,4.32258064516129

6877274,4,B00QNYZ9C6,"The Mamas Family Favorites Collection features highlights from all six seasons of Mamas Family, which originally aired from 1983 to 1990, first on NBC and then, after a two-year hiatus, in first-run syndication. Mamas Family originated on The Carol Burnett Show, which lasted 11 seasons on CBS. On the Burnett show, the sketch was called The Family and featured the ever-squabbling Harpers, getting into snits about mundane matters. Vicki Lawrence was transformed into Mama Thelma Harper, a blue-haired, irascible 65-year-old widow never shy about speaking her mind, no matter how inappropriate her comments. Her quick temper, abrasive retorts and smart-alecky wisecracks contributed a large portion of the shows laughs.

Vicki Lawrence initially turned down the offer to star in the series because of misgivings about playing the role without Harvey Korman, who played Mamas son-in-law Ed Higgins, and Carol Burnett, who played Mamas daughter, Eunice. After encouragement from Burnett, Lawrence eventually agreed to play Mama in the spin-off series.

Lawrence herself selected the 37 shows featured in this collection. Episodes feature Rue McClanahan as Mamas uptight sister, Ken Berry as her slow-witted son Vint, Dorothy Lyman as his bubble-headed girlfriend (and later wife) Naomi, and Betty White as Mamas snobbish daughter Ellen. Carol Burnett, Harvey Korman, Alex Trebek, and Imogene Coca also make guest appearances.

Stories include Mama ghost writing an advice column, helping spring a cousin from a retirement community, winning the jackpot on Jeopardy, chewing out a radio stations consumer watchdog on the air and getting hired as his replacement, and getting bopped on the head by a pot while making gooseberry jam.

There are no bonus features in the 6-disc DVD box set.",1488931200,,1785,5.456521739130435

6877277,5,B00QNYZ9C6,"Of course I love Mama's Family. ""Who the hell doesn't!?!""

It should be noted here to consumers that THIS SET IS NOT THE COMPLETE SERIES. With that said, it's not supposed to be. It's intended to be highlights.

Too many people could mistake this for all of the episodes so I thought it would be helpful to reiterate this so nobody gets disappointed.

It's totally worth your money to shell out a bit more for the complete series. This set may be for the casual fan or for collectors to have all MF releases.",1486598400,2,508,4.382978723404255

6877279,5,B00QNYZ9C6,"Seems like they stopped relying on Carol Burnett, Rue McClanahan and Betty White after season 2, and reached the pinnacle with season 6.  The actors were really into their roles by this point, and it's interesting to note that this show actually lasted all the way into the 90's.  This was the perfect length of a show's run.  It didn't really need to go beyond six years.  Ending with Naomi having a baby was a great way to close out the series.  It wouldn't have had the same dynamic if a baby was added into the storylines.  I have fond memories of watching this season in first run syndication back in '89 & '90.",1484179200,,616,4.359649122807017

Other noteworthy episodes include ""Take My Mama, Please"", where Mama takes on amateur comedy at the Bigger Jigger; and ""A Blast From the Past,"" where Mama goes to her school reunion, only to be horrified upon discovering an embarrassing rumor is still alive and well about her.

Besides the episodes, this box set also includes fun and informative interviews with the cast.

Although the show may have ended after six seasons, it'll be a long time before viewers forget the Harper family!",1440374400,2,749,4.881889763779528

6877320,5,B00QNYZ9C6,"""Mama's Family"" - Season 6 is the final season of this childhood favorite of mine. I grew up watching this show in syndication, and watching these episodes on DVD all these years later brings back wonderful memories. Who doesn't love Vicki Lawrence?! What a gifted comedic actress. There are some superb episodes like: ""Mr. Wrong"", ""Pinup Mama"", ""Guess Who's Going To Dinner"", and the hilarious, ""Look Who's Breathing"". This classic show is the perfect way to escape the stress of everyday life. It's good-clean fun and an absolute riot! The final show is both hilarious and incredible touching (Naomi gives birth in a run-down RV parked in Mama's drive-way). Get ready to laugh and then some.

Naturally the content of the show is dated, with references to things that a lot of younger viewers might not get, but there is still a lot of universal appeal! Takes me right back to my childhood to watch these episodes.

To those who complain about certain things being edited out... it's nothing substantial and does not affect the viewing experience. Only die-hard fans will probably notice, but I would rather have slightly edited versions of my favorite show than no show at all!

8692215,5,B00QNYZ9C6,"I'm so glad that I finally was able to snag the last season of this excellently hilarious and classic comedy to complete the series. I remember watching this show when I was in school at 6:00 a.m. on TBS and getting up super early just to watch it. Now I can watch it whenever I want to (over.. and over.. and over again). Even though I thought the price was a touch high for a comedy that's been out for three decades, it was kind of worth it since it had been out of stock for a decent amount of time. I'm very happy with this purchase and enjoy every laugh!",1528156800,,560,4.054054054054054

8692222,5,B00QNYZ9C6,"To paraphrase What About Bob? There are those people who love the syndicated episodes of Mamas Family and those who dont. Its more of a style of humor that can related to broadly rather than the smart, witty, intellectual humor. The laughs are easy, driven by the actions of characters and the situations are sometimes, okay often, off the wall. Its a style of comedy that I actually wish existed more today as opposed to cheap jokes about certain human activities.

This really feels like an ending. Although there has been reports that a 7th season was planned. It would have been a different show with a baby, which was born in the final episode of the series. The season still has standouts such as when Mama tries to sell her cure for the cold to everyone in town or when Mama domesticates a hard rock band Bubba has booked for his college dance. Some of the stories ventured into the downright ridiculous, even for Raytown. Im thinking of the Mama detective fantasy, though there could be others. Like other season sets, you get writer/producer commentary, which while nice tends to alternate between discussing Mamas Family to the Family sketches that aired on Carol Burnett.",1500681600,,1182,4.765853658536585
