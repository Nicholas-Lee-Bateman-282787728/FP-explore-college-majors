1641720,4,B00005OSL3,"He enjoys all the songs and images.  We have him brush his teeth to the toothbrushing part, and he is learning to sing along with the lullabies.  I wouldn't consider that this video is supposed to PUT HIM TO SLEEP, but it does put him in a bedtime frame of mind, and I use the lullabies (""Pretty Little Horses"" is his favorite) when I do rock him to sleep after we watch.

I myself think it's sweet.  Yeah, some parts are a bit over the top (e.g. Rosebud is quite annoying).  The black mom and the curly haired mom aren't THAT over the top compared to what's seen in many other children's videos--I think they're both sweet and it's obvious they enjoy being with their kids.  The other mom (older, short haired mom of 2) is a little strange--she is so sedate compared to the other two moms, and she LOOKS and SOUNDS like an exhausted mom of a relatively new baby, LOL!  Don't know why they didn't let her sing her own lullaby as the other 2 moms did--when she gets to sing a few snatches she has quite a nice voice.

The only part I really don't like is the cartoon ""snoring"" sequence, LOL!  And I would agree that if you're trying to get your child in a quiet mood, Rosebud yelling ""Camptown Races"" could DEFINITELY break the spell.

One strange thing--the song subtitles are triggered by the ""ANGLE"" feature on my DVD, not the ""SUBTITLE"" feature!  I've never had that happen before!

Overall, my little one requests the ""lullaby show"" and he and I both like it!  It creates a nice little bedtime routine--wash, toothbrush, story, lullabies--and shows nice, happy interactions between moms and their obviously loved little ones.

I never thought of ""You Are So Beautiful to Me"" as a lullaby or a love song to a child--but it is perfect and I sing it to my little one now.",1150070400,3,1772,4.429012345679013
1641721,2,B00005OSL3,"My daughter, who just turned two, has never liked this DVD, and neither do I.  It scares her-especially the creepy flower played by Caroline Rhea.  The moms are annoying, the songs are unimaginative, and it just drags on and on.  The worst part is that, everytime the DVD almost succeeds in putting a child to sleep, it screams them back to consciousness!  It does this twice, after nice, quiet parts: my least favorite is after the singing of the lullabies, when Caroline Rhea suddenly starts screaming out ""CAMPTOWN RACETRACK FIVE MILES LONG, DOO DAH, DOO DAH""!
Homestly, don't waste your money, especially if you're wanting to use it at bedtime.  It's annoying, ineffective, and just downright ""weird"", for lack of a better word!",1054771200,11,732,4.91869918699187
1641722,5,B00005OSL3,"My boy/girl 13 month old toddlers find this show fascinating.  They are learning to brush their teeth and wash their face before bed.  They listen to the story and love the music.  Best of all, they are ready for bed when we are through!",1043798400,4,237,4.340909090909091
7949023,4,B00005OSL3,Both my children loved this dvd and they would calm down as they heard the beginning to the end.,1515369600,,96,4.105263157894737
7949024,5,B00005OSL3,Love this. My grandmother had on a old vhs and we needed a dvd for the little one. He watches it evernot before bed it helps him to go to sleep. thank you so much for helping us continue our bedtime routine.,1430524800,,207,3.9523809523809526
7949025,5,B00005OSL3,Excellent and relaxing and bonding for my daughter and me when she was 3 years old up til now at 10,1412121600,2,99,3.761904761904762
7949026,5,B00005OSL3,"Before you read someone's bad review check to see if they review others in negative lights.  Honestly, I really found this a real tool for bonding with my boys when they where little.  I loved the Tim Conway and Carolyn Rhea (flower in a pot puppet) far from scary. More like any Sesame Street character or Disney style.  I liked this as it encourages Mommies to participate versus sitting kids in front of the TV and this really is nice.

At the end is a relaxing aquarium with soothing classical music and fish I can resist.",1397433600,,526,4.447916666666667
7949027,5,B00005OSL3,"We liked it because it not only got the kids ready for bed each night by washing, brushing their teeth, cute stories and fun winding down activities WITH parents versus sticking your kid infront of the tube alone.  Beautiful music and a nice
Peaceful way to end the day with an aquarium full of fishes that will slowly drift your kids off to sleep.

I'm sorry, nothing creepy about Tim Conway or Carolyn Rhea.  As characters.  I prefer them to the Baby Einstein series as this is interactive with child and parent and assists with developing a healthy bedtime ritual that when followed would reduce stresses for parents in future.",1397433600,,630,4.7
7949028,1,B00005OSL3,Movie was scrarched and the case was not wrapped and was broke when it arrived. now they have no case,1390780800,,101,4.1
7949029,1,B00005OSL3,The picture on the front doesn't match with how tacky this low budget DVD is. For kid friendly but just poor acting.,1386374400,,116,4.318181818181818
7949030,4,B00005OSL3,"My 16 month old just loves this movie. It was given to him as a christmas present on VHS, and I am currently buying it on DVD so it can play in his own room. He falls asleep to it every night, and you never here a peep out of him while it is on. I think it is a great movie!",1200096000,,274,3.435483870967742
7949031,5,B00005OSL3,"Mommy and Me was a great series-- until they sold to (I think)Disney. And, believe me, I'm the biggest Disney fan out there, but this time, they ruined something wonderful.

Anyways, Lullaby and Goodnight, Splish Splash, and Fun and Friends are the first three.  After that, they changed formats and casting methods and all of the series took place in an ugly daycare type room.  But, these three dvds I've just mentioned are before those drastic changes and they are phenomenal.

My daughter's favorites, in order (and my husband's and mine, too) are Lullaby and Goodnight, then Splish Splash, then Fun and Friends.  But, they are all wonderful.

Each episode takes place in a warm and cheerfully decorated home.  Lullaby and Goodnight is a slumber party, where several moms and their kids of different ages are having a sleepover.  They sing songs, brush their teeth and wash their faces and get their pajamas on.  Then they hear a story and go to sleep.  They also have a talking radio, voiced by Tim Conway (who's very likable here) and a talking silly flower voiced by Caroline Rhea.  She's good, too, but they weren't necessary because the stars of the shows are the moms.

They aren't glamorous, but they are all attractive mothers with very nice personalities and voices.  They take turns singing and speaking and do a wonderful job.  They are very professional, but seem like moms rather than actors.  Each episode has a mom that is in the spotlight more than the others, but they all take their turns.  Lullaby and Goodnight's mom  is on the front cover and she has an adorable personality-- very likable, very sweet and engaging.

Splish Splash's episode is about water play-- the stories involve water, the songs involve water and the kids play outside in the backyard pool.  The main mom here is also sweet and very upbeat-- you have to smile while watching any of these dvds.

Fun and Friends' theme is friends (as are all the others, too), and is also charming and great fun.

When my daughter watched these, she wanted to play them CONTINUALLY.  She learned how to press play on the dvd player while watching these.  Even now that she's four, she'll request one or two of them sometimes.

They are great fun and I really wish they would have made more of these dvds.  The quality is wonderful and each dvd has some extras including parental advice, etc.  Kind of boring run of the mill stuff, but I bought the dvds for the kids, not for the advice, so I'm very happy with them.",1199836800,2,2493,4.660550458715596
7949032,5,B00005OSL3,We tuck in with this every night!  She loves it.  I only hope they will make another one for nighttime so I can get some variety.,1153353600,,129,3.923076923076923
