It's interesting and has some great footage but , crucially, ignores several important periods and players in the Damned story. Focusing far too much on certain albums leaves a taste of 'the history according to' rather than the history of the band. Essential for casual or new fans of the band, for the die hards there is way too much missing to call this a complete story. Not so much an opportunity missed as an opportunity not fulfilled. Good effort but let's hope somewhere down the line the bands story is told in more detail.",1466640000,11,697,4.5396825396825395

Ive always loved Damned Damned Damned but found the changes in lineups and musical direction confusing. The doc helps with that but I almost need to watch it again to get it all straight.

Pioneers of British Punk
Amos Lassen
The Damned are British punk pioneers who get a little help from their famous friends to make this documentary or rockumentary, if you prefer.

The Damned were trailblazers on Londons mid-1970s punk rock scene, but never fully capitalized on their early notoriety. They were the first British punk band to release a single and in 1976 the band released New Rose. They also were the first British punksters to release an album, and the first to tour the U.S. and it was here that they left a lasting musical legacy. They never were able to achieve, however, the critical adoration that contemporaries like The Clash and Sex Pistols managed to do. This was probably because they preferred goofing around in silly costumes. The Damned were brash and juvenile. Nonetheless, they have outlasted most of their rivals and have survived despite many breakups and restarts. More than forty years to be on the circuit is quite an achievement.

Director Wes Orshoski shows the bands importance in this film that is funny, fast-moving and fan-friendly. The title comes a Damned song lyric and brings together chaotic archival material with firsthand footage that was shot on recent tours. The bands classic late-1970s lineup consisted of singer Dave Vanian, bass player turned guitarist Captain Sensible (aka Ray Burns), drummer Rat Scabies (Christopher Millar) and guitarist Brian James. They share their stories with Orshoski, despite the bitter fights that have split the band into two camps. In the current lineup only Vanian and Sensible remain.
Orshoski also interviews friend and fans from the rock world, including Chris Stein and Clem Burke of Blondie, Nick Mason of Pink Floyd, Mick Jones of The Clash, Duff McKagan of Guns N Roses, DJ and filmmaker Don Letts and founder of Dead Kennedys, Jello Biafra. Pretenders singer Chrissie Hynde and Culture Club drummer Jon Moss both played in early lineups of The Damned, and both are seen in the documentary. The film comes across like a personal passion project for Orshoski. He followed the band around the world over a three-year period with one camera. This is not a neat rock documentary narrative because the band has had a messy history and went through many changes of musical style and personnel.

Orshoski struggles to impose dramatic shape on a sprawling subject, but at least he finds an emotional hook in the decades-old rift between Sensible and Scabies, a disagreement over unpaid royalties that is now beyond repair. Scabies dismisses the dispute as ancient history but his tearful, agitated interviews tell a different story. This sad little subplot leaves a bitter aftertaste, but does not dilute the films overall take-home message that The Damned were the live-wire jokers of the London punk scene:.
Orshoski charts the bands trajectory from the toilets of Fairfield Halls where Sensible says, One day, I found a turd that just would not flush, through the earliest days of punk. The picture that we get is one of chaos and the band seems to thrive on it. Orshoski does a good job outlining the UK punk scene for US audiences and he helps illustrate just how out of step with their contemporaries The Damneds activities were.",1463443200,9,3267,4.988990825688074
7666797,4,B01BSW1NR2,"Dont You Wish You Were The Damned?

New documentary The Damned: Dont You Wish We Were Dead? chronicles the seminal UK punk outfit from their early years through today, with warts and all. The eccentricities of Vanian, the unique guitar sound of Captain Sensible, the years without the Captain, the post Rat Scabies years, the tumultuous relationships, their friendship with Lemmy and Motrhead (including the year he played bass for them), the times that Chrissie Hynde and Mick Jones covered for missing members of the band its all here.

It all starts in 1977 and follows the rollercoaster that is The Damned all the way through today. For casual fans of The Damned, like myself, this is a fascinating look at a band who meant a ton to the musical genre that changed our lives. Without The Damned, so much of what is now punk may not have been. In 1976, they were the first UK punk band to release a single. In early 1977, they were the first UK punk band to release a full length. Later that year, they were also the first UK punk band to tour the US. And, whats more is that they are the only of the original 1976 punk bands to still be touring the world today.

Diehard fans likely know much of the lore of Dave Vanians antics and the numerous everpresent internal feuds throughout the bands history, but even those diehards have never heard the members of the band and the folks closest to them speak so candidly about their takes and feelings on what really happened. There are many compelling moments throughout the film, notably whenever any of the core members take center screen to share their parts of the story. From Sensible admitting he cant help [himself] because hes just an a*****e to the happy nostalgic stories, there is a ton in this doc to enjoy and discuss.

For this weeks New Music Monday, I submit something not so new, but perhaps new to you, The Damneds Smash It Up (below). The Offsprings cover of the classic tune was featured on the Batman Forever soundtrack, but many people in todays world don't likely know the original.

As the band begins their 40th anniversary tour on May 20th, the new documentary becomes available worldwide.",1463184000,5,2163,4.622395833333333

7666805,4,B01BSW1NR2,"A copy of this title was provided for review purposes.

Having been in my late teens/early twenties when punk rock first took off you would think I would have been into the whole scene back when it was in its heyday. Truth be told I was one of the few that even listened to it having bought the first Ramones album after finding it in the bargain bin for $1. At the time I listened and thought it was one of the worst records Id ever heard, laughing at its simplicity and ridiculous lyrics. Here I am 40 years later and a convert, enjoying everything they did.

But it was my son that got me to actually listen to punk music over the past few years. Im still not a fan of it all but I do enjoy some. But thats because punk music is meant for young people. Its intended for an angry youth unhappy with the way of the world, the politics, economics and the rest. The fast rhythms and percussive beats are intended as a release of energy, a big F you to the world and the regular music that most enjoy. But beneath all of this rage and protest there is a certain musicality to punk music as well. While some bands were promoted solely on their outrageous behavior (see The Sex Pistols) there were other bands who could actually play and play well, who wrapped themselves in the punk scene and yet still preformed as an actual band. Such is the case with The Damned.

THE DAMNED: DONT YOU WISH WE WERE DEAD is a documentary look at the band that takes us from their early beginnings through their latest incarnation in 2014 when the movie was shot. We get a look at the fact that the bad was actually made up of some very talented musicians who wanted to make music but who also felt the same pressures of the world that the punk scene gravitated towards at the same time. That combination of actual musical ability and punk energy combined to make a band that many pure rock and roll fans would find easy to access if they get around to giving the band a listen.

The film makes clear that the band was the first major band to come out of the punk scene. They released the first album of the many major bands. They had the first large fan base. And their popularity caused managers from other bands (notably Malcolm McLaren as seen in the DVDs extras) to attempt to damage their career while promoting their own bands. That The Damned never achieved the same financial success of their counterparts was in part due to this as well as due to their own inner turmoil, the same behind the scene problems associated with nearly ever band ever formed. Personal and professional jealousies, claims to song rights, treating each other poorly and too many days on the road took their toll on the band. The end result was to see the band fall apart and reform time and time again. The original line up hasn't played together since 1999.

At the same time while the band was together and apart and together again they adapted. They retained that same essence of punk, that same raw edge, but matured in their styling as well. The atmosphere was retained in each incarnation of the band and because of that the fans have remained loyal.

The movie takes us from those early days through current times and talks with each member of the band from the original members through new members. Of course the main focus remains with those early members, the core group, some of whom remain with the band to this day. Its interesting to watch them change over the years, to see them still enjoying making music after all these years.

The presentation here is well done with just enough extras to add to the story and yet not so many as to overshadow the film itself. The extra concerning McLaren feels more like it should have been included in the film as it presents an important part of the bands story. Thank goodness it was included here. Perhaps my only complaint with the film was the lack of subtitles, in part because there were moments when I was watching with the sound low here and then because at certain moments the accents of those being interviewed were so thick I had difficulty understanding. One other quick note is that while watching it is best to keep the remote handy since names of those being interviewed at times flash by the screen with such speed that you have to back up or freeze frame to see who they are.

On the whole this is not just an entertaining documentary but a movie that captures the spirit of the band and its members as well as the punk sensibility of the time. Not the manufactured scene but the real one. There is a good chance that after watching youll go out in search of some of the music that you hear from the band. I know I raided my sons collection after watching it to listen. This is a must have for punk fans, for music fans and for those who enjoy a well-made documentary about a culture that only now is being recognized for its influence.",1473811200,,4874,4.383849557522124

Despite having released whats considered to be the first UK punk rock single, New Rose, and the first full length punk LP,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Damned-Damned-Damned/dp/B01D0H3FI8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Damned Damned Damned</a>, their legacy remains one known mostly by music aficionados, and their music by fans. But over the course of their forty years, through numerous musical and personnel changes, the bands output has remained surprisingly transcendent. The fractured relationships, legal rifts and innate tensions of working together for four decades hasn't dimmed the musics resonance, nor the bands live appeal. Even when that live act only includes two original members. This is the story of a marathon, rather than just an initial sprint of brilliance.

Weaving together archival footage with interviews with the band, their contemporaries and those they influenced, the documentary tells several stories at once. At its heart is the story of the Damned as a seminal influence, whose chaotic, satirical style overshadowed their messages, and whose career failed to garner the lasting headlines of bands who wore discontent on their sleeves. That failure haunts the band members to this day, with drummer Rat Scabies sarcastically wondering if the Damned were just also there while the Pistols and Clash were changing the world. Interviews with Chrissie Hynde, Steve Diggle, TV Smith, Clem Burke, Chris Stein, Glen Matlock, JJ Burnel, Billy Idol, Dave Robinson and others testify to the Damneds place in punk rock history, while Ian MacKaye, Jello Biafra and Buzz Osborne testify to their influence.

Unsurprisingly, the intra-band arguments often centered on money (particularly Scabies purchase of the bands early albums out of a bankruptcy sale) and bad behavior. Forty years of on-again, off-again groupings seems to exposed all possible conflicts. Whats amazing is that through all the turmoil, the band outlasted their peers and successfully navigated transitions from punk rock to goth to prog-rock to new romanticism. They may not get the commercial placements of the Clash, Buzzcocks or Ramones, but the live clips show them still to be a potent stage act thats beloved by their fans.

Luckily, there is plenty to like in the Damned documentary and joyful moments, particularly from Vanian and Sensible.
