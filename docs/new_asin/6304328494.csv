7868607,4,6304328494,"The alliance of the mid-90s between director Tibor Takacs (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Gate/dp/B002I41KNC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Gate</a>) and martial golden boy Mark Dacascos was one that didn't always pay off, but did so resoundingly with this film. ""Sabotage"" is an action-thriller that emphasizes the latter but actually works, so much that you wonder why it never got more than a direct-to-video release. Well-cast, strongly acted, and impressively written, this is a hidden gem of its genre that deserves greater recognition.

The story: an ex-Special Forces soldier (Dacascos,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mortal-Kombat-Legacy-II/dp/B00LLV9XHS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mortal Kombat: Legacy II</a>) teams with an FBI agent (Carrie-Ann Moss,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Matrix-trilogy/dp/B0002Y69NG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Matrix trilogy</a>) to investigate an intricate case involving the assassination of a senator.

The film was co-written by Michael Stokes, a scribe who's won awards for his work in children's fare but who's capable of penning a sound thriller, like 2006's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Marsh/dp/B000MTFDBK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Marsh</a>. Though there are some moments of goofy machismo (e.g. Dacascos' character refuses to wear body armor for no apparent reason), Stokes takes a sober tone to the mystery, which reveals multiple layers of intrigue and literally drops surprises on the viewer until the very last scene. Whereas other DTV thrillers repeatedly need to fall back on action scenes to keep the intrigue going, ""Sabotage"" relies to a much greater extent on the strength of its story and the viewer's investment in the characters - characters that are, for the most part, superbly acted.

Dacascos performs well enough in his ronin role, but it's the others who stand out. Carrie-Ann Moss, regularly mocked for her performance under the Wachowski Bros., is pretty strong in portraying both a government agent and a mother. Stronger still are Tony Todd (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Man-from-Earth/dp/B000UYX4Q8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Man from Earth</a>) as the malicious assassin, Graham Greene (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Skins/dp/B000087F0X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Skins</a>) as a conniving government agent, and John Neville (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Adventures-of-Baron-Munchausen/dp/B0011E5M66/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Adventures of Baron Munchausen</a>) as the hero's ex-military adviser. While not necessarily cast against stereotype, these are actors who can deliver good performances in their sleep, but they're all definitely awake here, with Todd and Neville making particularly lasting impressions.

The action content is fairly strong, despite its meagerness: had there been more of it, it would have pushed this rating up another star. The one real drawback of casting Mark Dacascos in the lead role is that a lot of martial arts are expected from him, but the movie limits it to only two (and only one of them is actually good). There are some shootouts and car crashes, but my favorite scenes of the lot are the long-range sniping segments.

It gets to be kind of irritating how Moss' character, despite her screen presence, is consistently portrayed as less professional, more prone to mistakes, and inferior in general to Dacascos' character. But, chauvinism aside, this really is a great little movie. There was no reason for Tibor Takacs to not have been making bigger-budgeted features, but the level of the production values ensures that you won't know the difference when it comes to ""Sabotage."" Check it out!",1410220800,3,3943,6.738703339882122
7868608,3,6304328494,"This is an enjoyable movie, a different sort of 'who-dunnit'? a movie that you come away from not feeling as if you have just wasted an hour and a half of your life. Carrie Anne Moss is good in her role of an FBI agent, she is not yet, I don't think, an 'A' list actor though I think she should be, she has a way of engaging the viewer that draws you in and is  believable in the way she portrays her role. The Balkens conflict (or was it really a war) is the back drop to this political thriller though the movie quickly skips past this into the 'here and now'. The start is a little bit violent for those who consciences have not yet been seared, and the acting around this part of the movie is well below parr - quickly though it moves into a higher gear and grabs the viewers interest. Overall the movie is somewhat 'stayed' compared to more higher budget movies and it is quite clear a movie from more than a decade ago, putting that aside, along with not too a high expectation of a gripping thriller, the viewer will most likely enjoy this over the more repetitive offering seen today. The ending has some sweet satisifaction to it, not too unpredictable, and who gets to kill who is 'fun' to watch so all in all its not 'too' bad of a movie to watch, the acting does let it down a bit (Carrie Anne Moss shines and carries the movie though)but putting all of that aside, and that it is a 'dated' movie, it is one that can be enjoyed when you have watched most of anything else worth watching. I'd give it a 5.5 - 6 out of ten and by the by - I am glad I purchased it for my collection, it is worth watching again sometime down the track - but thats just my opinion!",1299196800,3,1672,4.097560975609756

very weird casting and some acting not a family movie but ok for big kids.",1281484800,,150,4.206896551724138
7868610,4,6304328494,"Sabotage came as a bit of a surprise to me. Instead of kicking evrybody inside Mark Dacascos actually plays a reasonably good role, without his usual overacting. The supporting cast does a serious job instead of just  fooling around as often happens and the plot may not be very original, but  the details have been worked out quite well. This is not a movie everybody  will enjoy, but if you like action movies, I think you will find it quite a  pleasure to watch.",951177600,7,465,4.5
