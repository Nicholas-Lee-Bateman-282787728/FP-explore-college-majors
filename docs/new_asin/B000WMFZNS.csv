2985781,2,B000WMFZNS,"Samuel Bronstein's El Cid is the epic to end all epics Released in 1959, it tells the story of the famous 11th-century hero who fought to unite Spain. Clocking in at just over three hours, it is sumptuous beyond description the cities and plains of Spain---with lush costumes and an even lusher  Miklos Rozsa score, it becomes almost too much of a good thing. With Anthony Mann directing, the audience is given not only the enormous spectacle of history parading across the screen, but also Mann's incredible ability to capture the intimate and personal drama of every day life. The drawback, and the only thing that makes this less than a perfect movie, is the two stars. Charleton Heston and Sophia Loren may be lovely to look at, but 180 minutes of alternately bad (read: wooden) acting gets a little tiresome. More than any other film genre, epics require special handling, as filming larger-than-life creations frequently bleaches all life out of the character. This is very much the case here, where the two leads are simply not equipped to deal with the scope or the reality of the characters. The supporting cast, including Herbert Lom, Raf Vallone and Hurd Hatfield, is quite wonderful---or at least serviceable. This new ""Limited Collector's Edition"" ---clearly grammatically challenged, or how many ""Limited"" collector's do you know?---comes chockfull of commentaries, still galleries, filmographies, trailers and ""bonuses""  reproductions of original souvenir programs, comic books and window cards.

2985782,5,B000WMFZNS,If You are a Charlton Heston Fan or a Sophia Loren Fan You need this movie in Your collection. It was long over due that they put this movie on DVD. I Hope You will enjoy it as much as I did. Enjoy,1208563200,,197,3.604651162790698
2985783,4,B000WMFZNS,"Finally and at last a quality dvd version of this excellent ""knight in shining armour"" epic spectacular starring the late Charlton Heston in one of his very best and most memorable roles. And of course the same can be said for the very beautiful Sophia Loren in one of her very best roles. They both give excellent, believable performances in this tale of heroic idealism that was so very typical of the President John F Kennedy era. Indeed it is said that this was one of President Kennedy's favourite films! And yet despite their utterly convincing performances it is also said that Charlton Heston and Sophia Loren privately intensely disliked if not hated each other even though they respected each other's talents. Great acting indeed!

This was producer Samuel Bronston's biggest box office success (1961) coming within months of the qualified success of his previous production ""King of Kings"" with Jeffrey Hunter in 1961 (King of Kings was not as popular as EL CID but still a substantial enough success after a while). EL CID was both a critical and commercial success perfectly encapsulating the idealism of the President Kennedy era in this tale of a chivalrous knight who risks his wife, his position in society and his loyalty to his king by putting his greater loyalty to his country above all else. This was a role perfectly fitting the acting talents of Charlton Heston as he had established a reputation for playing such larger than life characters (eg. Moses, Ben Hur) and he is reported to have very enthusiastically wanted to play the role. Strangely, in his autobiography, he admits that whilst he was very proud of the film he was unhappy with the editing of the finished version stating that the battle scenes weren't edited vigorously enough, the drama tends to drag at times and that Sophia Loren's character does not age like she's supposed to as his character ages throughout the film (maybe part of the actors' reported mutual dislike of each other). He also speculated that EL CID could have been a slightly better film if William Wyler of ""Ben Hur"" fame had directed El Cid and Anthony Mann (El Cid's director) would have produced a nearly as successful version of ""Ben Hur"" if Mann had directed ""Ben Hur"". Heston was a veteran of these epic spectacular films so his opinion is very interesting indeed.

However most people regard this film fondly because of its idealistic heroism and its very spectacular settings. I suspect that there is a fond nostalgia for this type of heroic idealism that typifies the President Kennedy era. Producer Bronston wanted absolute accuracy mainly in the locations but there is speculation that most of the scripts for his movies contain historical inaccuracies and EL CID is no exception. He did however strive for geographical & architectural accuracy in most of his productions but this was especially necessary with EL CID as General Franco's government in Spain wanted him to make an epic film in Spain about Spain itself and indeed Spanish characters. He did build large, impressive, architecturally & historically accurate sets in Spain but was also able to use the actual castles of Spain to great effect and shoot on location as these settings were virtual perfect replicas of the original settings where the events took place (eg. the city of Pamplona in Spain  was a virtual carbon copy of the medieval city of Valencia where the final sequences of the film are set). Director Anthony Mann was renowned for his directorial technique of integrating his characters into very spectacular natural landscapes and also handling personal relationships sensitively and he was the ideal director for this film.

In short, a great, spectacular historical epic with believable, human characters that appeals to most people due to its idealistic hero but perhaps not for all tastes as the idealism of the President Kennedy era has long since vanished. I only give it 4 out of five stars because of some of the story's historical inaccuracies and Sophia Loren's hollywood film star youthful appearance throughout the entire story when her character should have aged somewhat when the story moves forward several years later. These however are only minor criticisms of a truly great film.

By the way this film & ""The Fall of The Roman Empire"" LIMITED COLLECTOR'S EDITION versions are THE DEFINITE VERSIONS to get as all the extras in these LIMITED EDITION versions (lobby cards & reproductions of the original souvenir programs) are sure to be worth much, much more as movie memorabilia once the LIMITED EDITIONS sell out.

I agree with Maltin, one of the finest performances of Charlton Heston. It`s a shame that in the time of producton of the movie was not recorded in Ancient Spanish, the only one civilized way to listen to it, or at least spoken in spanish of Spain, NOT the latinamerican spanish, that will not work for this particular movie. BUT the movie by itself, it`s magnificent, the extra features of the DVD well produced, the package of the Deluxe Collector`s Edition beautufully done, lobby cards included.

2985809,5,B000WMFZNS,The obviously digitally remastered DVD is just great. It's even better than the original...the sound and clarity are terrific. Heston is still Heston - but seeing Sophia as she was in her 20's makes the cost of the DVD seem trivial. This is a wonderful fairy tale version of the story of Spain's champion.

2985811,4,B000WMFZNS,"Well I have been waiting a long time to see this movie on DVD and I enjoyed just as much seeing it recently as I did years ago.  It is not historically correct that is true but I could not wait to join in with the ""CID, CID"" calls.  Great movie and Sophia Loren is stunning",1203724800,,273,3.857142857142857
2985812,5,B000WMFZNS,"El Cid has been one of my favorite films, man and boy, for 47 years. It is the story of Roderigo Diaz of Bivar, destined to unify medieval Spain, both Christian and Moor, under the leadership of a single king, in order to protect her from the depredations of a tyrannical invader. It is also a love story as Roderigo loses the love of the ""beautiful Chimene"" to protect the honor of his family, and how she rediscovers her love when he loses all for the honor of Spain.

Charlton Heston stars in the title role, whose stature and sincerity easily transition into the mythic finale of the film. The ageless Sophia Loren plays Chimene, whose character is as proud and powerful as that of her lover. The rest of the cast is filled with the best film and stage actors that Europe could produce: Gary Raymond, Herbert Lom, Genevieve Bujold, Raf Vallone, John Fraser, Michael Hordern and Douglas Wilmer.

It is refreshing that, in an age of Computer Generated Imagery, this film chose locations and built sets that matched the grand background of this Spanish legend. The castle of Belmonte, that provides the backdrop to the tournament at Calahorra, blends seamlessly with the sets of the throne room at Castile and the cathedral at Burgos. There is no fakery here. The sets constructed, the costumes, armor and weapons manufactured are all real and as authentic as historical accuracy would allow.

This two-disc Collector's Edition has many special features. Along with the digitally remastered feature, it also has an insightful ""Making of . . ."" featurette and a short film on Samuel Bronston, the film's producer. Samuel Bronston was a maverick independent producer during the waning days of the Hollywood studio system, who specialized in making epic films. Among his films are John Paul Jones, The Fall of the Roman Empire, King of Kings and 55 Days at Peking. To this day, Jeffrey Hunter and his striking blue eyes is still my vision of Jesus. It also provides stills from the film, a facsimilie of the souvenir program and the Dell comic book (I still have mine from 1961). My favorite feature is the one on Miklos Rozsa, the film's composer, whose canon of film music has never been equaled in breadth, scope or quality.

This film still stands the test of time and is well worth the asking price and the time spent wandering through its wonders. I hope that you will journey with me through medieval Spain. I have never been disappointed. I know you won't.",1203724800,2,2462,4.7453271028037385
2985813,5,B000WMFZNS,"I really loved this movie since I saw it on its original release. It was amazing how much of the dialogue I remembered - probably because it IS so memorable, unlike so many scripts today that try so hard for realism they lose all poetry. Sometimes, though, we revisit the epics of our youth and find in them only nostalgia and melodrama. This is not the case here. This is an intelligent epic - mythology rooted firmly in history, and with a heft and sweep impossible to computer generated epics. The scenes are almost stately, yet the human emotion keeps them riveting. No hand-held cameras, quickly cutting from one instant to the next - just characters greater than life, in gorgeous settings, presenting all the drama and sweep of action one could wish for. It didn't matter that I knew absolutely everything that would happen - the joust for Calahorra was still agonizingly suspenseful, and one of the great action sequences ever filmed. Now that I'm old enough to know what really goes into filmmaking, the battle for Valencia was even more staggering in its size and complexity - not just soldiers on walls, but rank upon rank of real people, marcing on a real beach, standing on real walls, in hand-sewn costumes (village women for miles around were kept stitching for months). The landscapes are gorgeous. And above all, there is Miklos Rozsa's music, which is the heart and soul of this epic - you simply cannot imagine ""El Cid"" without it.",1203292800,,1450,4.735177865612648

Yes, there were some great movies that year, but how did ""Flower Drum Song"" get more nominations than ""El Cid?""

My siblings and there kids are all excited about this coming to DVD and yep, I have ordered the Limited Collectors edition.  For tidbit more info in case it is not easily  provided: I read that this movie had a well known historian inputting for historical accuracy.  Apparently a huge concious effort was made so it would be historically accurate and even the costumes are all accurate and also were all made using real leather etc.  This film was definitely one of the biggest budget films as real castles were used, and buildings were constructed to hide architectural inaccuracies for the period.  In other words, this film is worth watching and educational too.  If you re not excited, you may not have seen the film back in the first realease in 1961 like me.  It made such a deep impression that I today am writing this comment with such excitement.  This is a ""must have"" for even the smallest collector.  Christmas is coming twice this year! yeah.  As my title indicates...this dvd is produced from the orignal 70mm  remastered film.  As you might have read, the earlier laser disc was produced from 35mm film, so this  DVD is as good as it gets!

2985843,5,B000WMFZNS,"After years of waiting, the epic 1961 film El Cid has been released on DVD. This film depicts the life of Rodrigo Valdez de Bivar, also known as El Cid, the national hero of Spain who led the revolt against centuries of Moorish rule. It tells a story of a reluctant hero, someone who does not wish to fight the Moors at first, but who becomes a revolutionary after suffering betrayal and personal loss.

Produced by Samuel Bronston, directed by Anthony Mann, and starring Charlton Heston, this film is anchored by people who knew what it took to tell a grand, majestic story. This film is entertaining and enjoyable as an action adventure epic, as a historical film, and as a romantic movie.

These kind of movies should never go out of style. Regardless of liberties taken with the facts or any other entertainment license, we are much poorer when we don't have movies like Braveheart, Gladiator, Spartacus, Taras Bulba, and El Cid. They thrill, entertain, and enlighten, and cause us to focus on ideals and principles greater than ourselves.

The Criterion laserdisc has the best look (better than the French PAL DVD), but it used a 35 mm print, not the original 70 mm print, as its source.  Does anyone know if the forthcoming DVD from Miramax uses the 70mm print?",1197763200,3,307,4.116666666666666
2985846,5,B000WMFZNS,"Finally the film El-Cid comes on dvd.

I sincerely hope that they have done a better job with the restoration of the movie when it was first released on laserdisc by the Critirion collection. The picture quality is not very good some dirt and scratches are clearly visible here and there. The sound is not good either and the intermission card is not to be seen. Lets hope that the Weinstein company is wiser to correct all this, then the above mentioned company . I believe, and not very sure they will use most of the extra's taken directly from the laserdisc version, but still a treat for everyone who has never seen it before.
The interview with Sophia Loren is not to be found on laserdisc at all, that's great news for people who love this picture.

I have however one point to consider, on the laserdisc version the son of Miklos Rozsa tells the viewer I quote: ""even we go to the deepest archives the music is married to the surround channels"". In other words, there are no original mastertapes of the music recording available after the film was released. I wonder if the Weinstein company did find (somehow) the orginal music tapes and have corrected this mistake.

In his book ""A double life"" of Miklos Rozsa tells his readers that his music was cut several times during scenes and that the music was put back in volume in favour of the soundeffects. The sound was edited by Vera Fields, who happens to be later the film editor of ""Jaws"" and won a oscar for it. Mr. Rozsa was absolutly not pleased what they had done with his score on his almost last big epic movie. Lets hope that they have solved this problem as well.

This movie was shot in 70mm technirama technicolor process, the film runs through the filmprojector almost the same as 35mm but was projected horizental. One frame has 8 sprocket holes.

Anyway, I'm looking forward to see it as soon as it's released on dvd. It includes also ""55 days of Peking"" ""The fall of the Roman empire""and ""Circus world"" in the near future.

It stands alongside BEN HUR and A MAN FOR ALL SEASONS as an example of history-as-entertainment. The age-old legend of the Spanish hero known as ""El Cid"" has come down to us in poems and plays, and this film presents us with the best distillation of fact and fiction drawn from those sources.

Director Anthony Mann assembled an impressive cast, gorgeous locations, and awesome battle scenes to tell the tale, but he and his colleagues did not forget the most important elements--a strong script and a touching, believable love story. Charlton Heston has never been more impressive than he is here, and Sophia Loren's Chimene is one of her finest roles. The two stars are perfect together, with able support from an A-list international cast.

2985850,5,B000WMFZNS,"It has been a very long wait indeed for a proper, high resolution 2 disc anamorphic DVD of this epic medieval tale of passion and chivalry. The final results are breathtaking. The transfer is stunning and the sound is rich and full. This is rousing entertainment on the grandest scale.

It's hard to understand why this film took so long to arrive on DVD. Perhaps, as some have suggested, the subject matter has been an issue in our over-sensitive, shrinking world of religious violence. Or our discomfort with nebulous concepts of love, forgiveness and peace. But most likely a matter of rights and licensing issues.

The relevance of this extraordinary film remains current and is a monumental artistic achievements of world cinema. On a personal level, this terrific film provoked me into thinking about how belief systems -- especially about the nature of God (or Allah) -- benefit or harm our world.

The essence of the conflict between warring Castilians and Moors and an invading Muslim threat is unflinching in the opening scene as the North African holy warrior Ben Yussuf quotes ""the Prophet"" as promising to conquer the world in the name of Allah.

But the real conflict is the idea that there can be peace -- and perhaps even love -- between those who hate. This is exemplified in the troubled and intimate story of Rodrigo (Charlton Heston) and Ximena (Sophia Loren). It begins simply enough with a knight on his way to meet his bride when destiny forces a detour.

El Cid, the legendary hero of Spain was a real person named Don Rodrigo Diaz de Bivar. He lived around 1035 A.D. Although he spent much of his time fighting on the side of the Moors, he became identified as the best incarnation of the true Castilian Christian spirit. His name came from the Arabic ""sayyid"" meaning ""lord"" or ""chief.""

Charlton Heston and Sophia Loren are perfectly cast as larger than life figures of flesh and blood. Their reported confllcts on-set probably added a degree of on-screen realism. They are wonderful together. Too bad Heston and Loren were not able to do a full, shared commentary at the time of the transfer.

Anthony Mann's direction is robust and true to the theme. The movie has a fine sense of composition that the terrific on-location cinematography only enhances. Numerous action-filled vistas fill the screen, richly detailed and beautifully photographed. No CGI elements can rival the texture of a real place captured on celluloid.

The incredible flow of stunning images and the magnificent Miklos Rozsa score are a reminder of what movies can do when they tackle a worthy tale and go all the way.

EL CID is about a real hero who selflessly followed his moral compass. It's also a reasonably true adapataion of the essence of the numerous medieval tales, plays and poems -- unlike the mangling of both poem and hero ""Beowulf"" in the recent movie of the same name.

Amazing that this magnificent paradox of a tale -- after all, El Cid was a warrior and peacemaker -- continues to be told for a thousand years.

The extras on the second disc include interesting featurettes on producer Sam Bronston, director Anthony Mann and composer Miklos Rozsa as well as vintage radio interviews with Heston and Loren and a ""making of"" documentary.

The last scenes are a fitting epitaph for Charlton Heston the man and the actor. His passing is truly the end of an era.

This great movie deserves a place in any digital library. Don't miss it.

Highest recommendation.

3220278,2,B000WMFZNS,"Samuel Bronstein's El Cid is the epic to end all epics Released in 1959, it tells the story of the famous 11th-century hero who fought to unite Spain. Clocking in at just over three hours, it is sumptuous beyond description the cities and plains of Spain---with lush costumes and an even lusher  Miklos Rozsa score, it becomes almost too much of a good thing. With Anthony Mann directing, the audience is given not only the enormous spectacle of history parading across the screen, but also Mann's incredible ability to capture the intimate and personal drama of every day life. The drawback, and the only thing that makes this less than a perfect movie, is the two stars. Charleton Heston and Sophia Loren may be lovely to look at, but 180 minutes of alternately bad (read: wooden) acting gets a little tiresome. More than any other film genre, epics require special handling, as filming larger-than-life creations frequently bleaches all life out of the character. This is very much the case here, where the two leads are simply not equipped to deal with the scope or the reality of the characters.

3220280,4,B000WMFZNS,"Finally and at last a quality dvd version of this excellent ""knight in shining armour"" epic spectacular starring the late Charlton Heston in one of his very best and most memorable roles. And of course the same can be said for the very beautiful Sophia Loren in one of her very best roles. They both give excellent, believable performances in this tale of heroic idealism that was so very typical of the President John F Kennedy era. Indeed it is said that this was one of President Kennedy's favourite films! And yet despite their utterly convincing performances it is also said that Charlton Heston and Sophia Loren privately intensely disliked if not hated each other even though they respected each other's talents. Great acting indeed!

This was producer Samuel Bronston's biggest box office success (1961) coming within months of the qualified success of his previous production ""King of Kings"" with Jeffrey Hunter in 1961 (King of Kings was not as popular as EL CID but still a substantial enough success after a while). EL CID was both a critical and commercial success perfectly encapsulating the idealism of the President Kennedy era in this tale of a chivalrous knight who risks his wife, his position in society and his loyalty to his king by putting his greater loyalty to his country above all else. This was a role perfectly fitting the acting talents of Charlton Heston as he had established a reputation for playing such larger than life characters (eg. Moses, Ben Hur) and he is reported to have very enthusiastically wanted to play the role. Strangely, in his autobiography, he admits that whilst he was very proud of the film he was unhappy with the editing of the finished version stating that the battle scenes weren't edited vigorously enough, the drama tends to drag at times and that Sophia Loren's character does not age like she's supposed to as his character ages throughout the film (maybe part of the actors' reported mutual dislike of each other). He also speculated that EL CID could have been a slightly better film if William Wyler of ""Ben Hur"" fame had directed El Cid and Anthony Mann (El Cid's director) would have produced a nearly as successful version of ""Ben Hur"" if Mann had directed ""Ben Hur"". Heston was a veteran of these epic spectacular films so his opinion is very interesting indeed.

However most people regard this film fondly because of its idealistic heroism and its very spectacular settings. I suspect that there is a fond nostalgia for this type of heroic idealism that typifies the President Kennedy era. Producer Bronston wanted absolute accuracy mainly in the locations but there is speculation that most of the scripts for his movies contain historical inaccuracies and EL CID is no exception. He did however strive for geographical & architectural accuracy in most of his productions but this was especially necessary with EL CID as General Franco's government in Spain wanted him to make an epic film in Spain about Spain itself and indeed Spanish characters. He did build large, impressive, architecturally & historically accurate sets in Spain but was also able to use the actual castles of Spain to great effect and shoot on location as these settings were virtual perfect replicas of the original settings where the events took place (eg. the city of Pamplona in Spain  was a virtual carbon copy of the medieval city of Valencia where the final sequences of the film are set). Director Anthony Mann was renowned for his directorial technique of integrating his characters into very spectacular natural landscapes and also handling personal relationships sensitively and he was the ideal director for this film.

In short, a great, spectacular historical epic with believable, human characters that appeals to most people due to its idealistic hero but perhaps not for all tastes as the idealism of the President Kennedy era has long since vanished. I only give it 4 out of five stars because of some of the story's historical inaccuracies and Sophia Loren's hollywood film star youthful appearance throughout the entire story when her character should have aged somewhat when the story moves forward several years later. These however are only minor criticisms of a truly great film.

3220309,5,B000WMFZNS,"El Cid has been one of my favorite films, man and boy, for 47 years. It is the story of Roderigo Diaz of Bivar, destined to unify medieval Spain, both Christian and Moor, under the leadership of a single king, in order to protect her from the depredations of a tyrannical invader. It is also a love story as Roderigo loses the love of the ""beautiful Chimene"" to protect the honor of his family, and how she rediscovers her love when he loses all for the honor of Spain.

Charlton Heston stars in the title role, whose stature and sincerity easily transition into the mythic finale of the film. The ageless Sophia Loren plays Chimene, whose character is as proud and powerful as that of her lover. The rest of the cast is filled with the best film and stage actors that Europe could produce: Gary Raymond, Herbert Lom, Genevieve Bujold, Raf Vallone, John Fraser, Michael Hordern and Douglas Wilmer.

It is refreshing that, in an age of Computer Generated Imagery, this film chose locations and built sets that matched the grand background of this Spanish legend. The castle of Belmonte, that provides the backdrop to the tournament at Calahorra, blends seamlessly with the sets of the throne room at Castile and the cathedral at Burgos. There is no fakery here. The sets constructed, the costumes, armor and weapons manufactured are all real and as authentic as historical accuracy would allow.

This two-disc Collector's Edition has many special features. Along with the digitally remastered feature, it also has an insightful ""Making of . . ."" featurette and a short film on Samuel Bronston, the film's producer. Samuel Bronston was a maverick independent producer during the waning days of the Hollywood studio system, who specialized in making epic films. Among his films are John Paul Jones, The Fall of the Roman Empire, King of Kings and 55 Days at Peking. To this day, Jeffrey Hunter and his striking blue eyes is still my vision of Jesus. It also provides stills from the film, a facsimilie of the souvenir program and the Dell comic book (I still have mine from 1961). My favorite feature is the one on Miklos Rozsa, the film's composer, whose canon of film music has never been equaled in breadth, scope or quality.

This film still stands the test of time and is well worth the asking price and the time spent wandering through its wonders. I hope that you will journey with me through medieval Spain. I have never been disappointed. I know you won't.",1203724800,2,2462,4.7453271028037385
3220310,5,B000WMFZNS,"I really loved this movie since I saw it on its original release. It was amazing how much of the dialogue I remembered - probably because it IS so memorable, unlike so many scripts today that try so hard for realism they lose all poetry. Sometimes, though, we revisit the epics of our youth and find in them only nostalgia and melodrama. This is not the case here. This is an intelligent epic - mythology rooted firmly in history, and with a heft and sweep impossible to computer generated epics. The scenes are almost stately, yet the human emotion keeps them riveting. No hand-held cameras, quickly cutting from one instant to the next - just characters greater than life, in gorgeous settings, presenting all the drama and sweep of action one could wish for. It didn't matter that I knew absolutely everything that would happen - the joust for Calahorra was still agonizingly suspenseful, and one of the great action sequences ever filmed. Now that I'm old enough to know what really goes into filmmaking, the battle for Valencia was even more staggering in its size and complexity - not just soldiers on walls, but rank upon rank of real people, marcing on a real beach, standing on real walls, in hand-sewn costumes (village women for miles around were kept stitching for months). The landscapes are gorgeous. And above all, there is Miklos Rozsa's music, which is the heart and soul of this epic - you simply cannot imagine ""El Cid"" without it.",1203292800,,1450,4.735177865612648

Apparently a huge concious effort was made so it would be historically accurate and even the costumes are all accurate and also were all made using real leather etc.  This film was definitely one of the biggest budget films as real castles were used, and buildings were constructed to hide architectural inaccuracies for the period.

This film depicts the life of Rodrigo Valdez de Bivar, also known as El Cid, the national hero of Spain who led the revolt against centuries of Moorish rule. It tells a story of a reluctant hero, someone who does not wish to fight the Moors at first, but who becomes a revolutionary after suffering betrayal and personal loss.

Produced by Samuel Bronston, directed by Anthony Mann, and starring Charlton Heston, this film is anchored by people who knew what it took to tell a grand, majestic story. This film is entertaining and enjoyable as an action adventure epic, as a historical film, and as a romantic movie.

These kind of movies should never go out of style. Regardless of liberties taken with the facts or any other entertainment license, we are much poorer when we don't have movies like Braveheart, Gladiator, Spartacus, Taras Bulba, and El Cid.

3220343,5,B000WMFZNS,"Finally the film El-Cid comes on dvd.

I sincerely hope that they have done a better job with the restoration of the movie when it was first released on laserdisc by the Critirion collection. The picture quality is not very good some dirt and scratches are clearly visible here and there. The sound is not good either and the intermission card is not to be seen. Lets hope that the Weinstein company is wiser to correct all this, then the above mentioned company . I believe, and not very sure they will use most of the extra's taken directly from the laserdisc version, but still a treat for everyone who has never seen it before.
The interview with Sophia Loren is not to be found on laserdisc at all, that's great news for people who love this picture.

I have however one point to consider, on the laserdisc version the son of Miklos Rozsa tells the viewer I quote: ""even we go to the deepest archives the music is married to the surround channels"". In other words, there are no original mastertapes of the music recording available after the film was released. I wonder if the Weinstein company did find (somehow) the orginal music tapes and have corrected this mistake.

In his book ""A double life"" of Miklos Rozsa tells his readers that his music was cut several times during scenes and that the music was put back in volume in favour of the soundeffects. The sound was edited by Vera Fields, who happens to be later the film editor of ""Jaws"" and won a oscar for it. Mr. Rozsa was absolutly not pleased what they had done with his score on his almost last big epic movie. Lets hope that they have solved this problem as well.

This movie was shot in 70mm technirama technicolor process, the film runs through the filmprojector almost the same as 35mm but was projected horizental. One frame has 8 sprocket holes.

Anyway, I'm looking forward to see it as soon as it's released on dvd. It includes also ""55 days of Peking"" ""The fall of the Roman empire""and ""Circus world"" in the near future.

Director Anthony Mann assembled an impressive cast, gorgeous locations, and awesome battle scenes to tell the tale, but he and his colleagues did not forget the most important elements--a strong script and a touching, believable love story. Charlton Heston has never been more impressive than he is here, and Sophia Loren's Chimene is one of her finest roles.

3220347,5,B000WMFZNS,"It has been a very long wait indeed for a proper, high resolution 2 disc anamorphic DVD of this epic medieval tale of passion and chivalry. The final results are breathtaking. The transfer is stunning and the sound is rich and full. This is rousing entertainment on the grandest scale.

It's hard to understand why this film took so long to arrive on DVD. Perhaps, as some have suggested, the subject matter has been an issue in our over-sensitive, shrinking world of religious violence. Or our discomfort with nebulous concepts of love, forgiveness and peace. But most likely a matter of rights and licensing issues.

The relevance of this extraordinary film remains current and is a monumental artistic achievements of world cinema. On a personal level, this terrific film provoked me into thinking about how belief systems -- especially about the nature of God (or Allah) -- benefit or harm our world.

The essence of the conflict between warring Castilians and Moors and an invading Muslim threat is unflinching in the opening scene as the North African holy warrior Ben Yussuf quotes ""the Prophet"" as promising to conquer the world in the name of Allah.

But the real conflict is the idea that there can be peace -- and perhaps even love -- between those who hate. This is exemplified in the troubled and intimate story of Rodrigo (Charlton Heston) and Ximena (Sophia Loren). It begins simply enough with a knight on his way to meet his bride when destiny forces a detour.

El Cid, the legendary hero of Spain was a real person named Don Rodrigo Diaz de Bivar. He lived around 1035 A.D. Although he spent much of his time fighting on the side of the Moors, he became identified as the best incarnation of the true Castilian Christian spirit. His name came from the Arabic ""sayyid"" meaning ""lord"" or ""chief.""

Charlton Heston and Sophia Loren are perfectly cast as larger than life figures of flesh and blood. Their reported confllcts on-set probably added a degree of on-screen realism. They are wonderful together. Too bad Heston and Loren were not able to do a full, shared commentary at the time of the transfer.

Anthony Mann's direction is robust and true to the theme. The movie has a fine sense of composition that the terrific on-location cinematography only enhances. Numerous action-filled vistas fill the screen, richly detailed and beautifully photographed. No CGI elements can rival the texture of a real place captured on celluloid.

The incredible flow of stunning images and the magnificent Miklos Rozsa score are a reminder of what movies can do when they tackle a worthy tale and go all the way.

EL CID is about a real hero who selflessly followed his moral compass. It's also a reasonably true adapataion of the essence of the numerous medieval tales, plays and poems -- unlike the mangling of both poem and hero ""Beowulf"" in the recent movie of the same name.

Amazing that this magnificent paradox of a tale -- after all, El Cid was a warrior and peacemaker -- continues to be told for a thousand years.

The extras on the second disc include interesting featurettes on producer Sam Bronston, director Anthony Mann and composer Miklos Rozsa as well as vintage radio interviews with Heston and Loren and a ""making of"" documentary.

The last scenes are a fitting epitaph for Charlton Heston the man and the actor. His passing is truly the end of an era.

This great movie deserves a place in any digital library. Don't miss it.

Highest recommendation.

Charlton Heston and Sophia Loren, although in real life were not fond of each other, put on a good show of 11th century lovers in the turmoil of the Christian and Moor wars in Spain during this period.

8224004,5,B000WMFZNS,"Watching this most inspiring Golden Globe winning epic movie is sublime. This is the confession of a producer's more or less aging son.  Everyone should submit at least once, for it will sweep you away in scenarios of unparalleled feeling, magnitude, forcefulness, and technical movie making mastery.  Yet, what is most interesting apart from the almost flawless artistry of the project, is its double transformative historical reality.  Then, in its 11th Century context, the struggles between the competing poles of Christianity with its richness and power craven aristocratic advocates versus the evolved, indigenous, Islamic society, cruelly forged the wrenching transformation of Spain and much of Europe. Those fierce battles purged a dual richness of culture whose amputation still haunts and deprives Europe of a great possible ecumenism. We see every day the dogmatic legacy of a millenieum of internicine conflict.  It's emulation is animated her in ""El Cid"". What is equally dramatic is the role the making of this movie, centuries later, had in transforming the image and economy of Spain again in the 60s when Spain was marketed and perceived in its utter cliche form as a culture of castanets, flamenco gypsies and, bull fighting.  With the making of El Cid, Spain's image changed profoundly.  So powerful was the influence of the movies' production on tourism, commerce, and diplomatic relationships, that the pall of Axis ally that hung over the Franco Regime was virtually erased and again a paradigm shift occurred.  There are so many levels the magnificent Weinstein remastered DVD package offers to a critical viewer.  It is hard not to focus on the artistic brilliance of the all real production and its gargantuan management but, in another viewing, ponder the political influence this project had in its time reveals whole other exercise in critical awareness to move the repeat viewer.

I have seen it three times, first when it was released in 1961, then at an ""arts"" theater in Houston, TX in about 1990 and just recently as I viewed the DVD version that I purchased on Amazon.  I highly recommend this film, especially for those who remember and relish how movies were made a few decades ago.

Admittedly, I have not yet reviewed all of the bonus features on the second disc, so I won't comment on their quality at this time.",1259971200,,478,4.173913043478261
