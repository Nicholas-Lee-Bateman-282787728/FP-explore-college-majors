When the order arrived, I noticed there was no list of her music video's on the back cover.  Odd, though no big deal, until I removed the saran wrap and found there was no listing on the inside.  Also, once you insert the DVD, there is NO menue to guide you along, so you just have to sit back and see what happens. Good luck, because music video #4 brought about a great deal of grief!

The first video was a live performance of *I Will Always Love You*.  Not quite sure which concert it was from, the location and/or year. Whitney's vocals are not all that great, and from her outfit and hair style, I think it may have been round the early 2000's.  However, that is only a guess.  Whomever was responsible for transfering this on to the DVD made a right hash of it. ( Downloaded from YouTube perhaps)?

*I Want To Dance With Somebody (Who Loves Me)* was only so-so.  A bit out of focus, but not too bad.  *I'm Every Woman* brought about A LOT of stalls, skips, and mini freezes.  *I'm Your Baby Tonight* totally froze midway through.  I was uable to fast-forward, reverse or eject the DVD.  I had to unplug the DVD player in order to reset it, finally allowing me to eject it.  As a test, I inserted the *Whatchulookinat* and the *Greatest Hits* DVD's.  Thankfully, they both played well, so I know the problem was not with my DVD player.

Needless to say, I am not at all pleased and hope that sometime soon the powerers that be, that were responsible for the release of her *Greatest Hits* DVD, release a professionally made *Part Two*.

Whitney was a great performer, and the Music Video's that Music Choice, VH1, Fuse, and a couple of other stations carried (via my cable provider), showed this to be true.",1333065600,4,1930,4.447293447293447
