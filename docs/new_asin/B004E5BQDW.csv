4335996,5,B004E5BQDW,"I am so grateful to have this set of the new Outer Limits on DVD. I don't care that the nudity and foul language was cut out, as seems to be a hang-up here. All the better, I feel. I'm not sure why such a negative response for the edits; editing is a pretty common practice for different reasons.  It's not really all that weird or unusual.  Perhaps the Canadians were just shooting for a newer, younger (as well as the former, older) audience.  Anyway, with the edits, then I don't have to worry about anything when any of the kids is wandering about the room. I suppose, if I really wanted to see these girls' nude bodies, I could go elsewhere.  Perhaps a solution would be to offer two versions to make everyone happy.  But enough of that.  Cheer up; it's not all that bad.  We're lucky, I feel, to have what we have of them.

I would have loved to have seen the quality in Blu-ray, but perhaps that's for another time. All in all, this is a wonderful buy. I've been wanting it for years, but never had my opportunity until now. And $200 was reasonable for all seven seasons on DVD. I remember when one Fuji VHS blank tape was $20, so this is very good. I did once manage to find the entire series, but after having received it, found it was squashed onto only 9 discs! and came from China (another warning flag!). The quality was pretty horrible and the menu system so deep that it wasn't worth having. As I remember, it also was some horrendous amount of money, $150-$200, or something like that.

Well, I'm happy to have the series back and don't mind the minor edits. Thanks for bringing the new Outer Limits back to us!

The season 2 - 7 DVD's only contain the edited versions of the show. Alliance did a pretty good job with the edited transfers. They don't look like the DVD's were copied from the VHS tapes any more. (A friend of mine has a set of those). But, Sadly. The original airing of this GREAT show seems to be relegated to history.

The show does appear to be as advertised. The video quality is as you would expect from a show of this time period which is to say ""Good for the time it was made"". They also appear to be uncensored but I'm not sure about unedited. I watched the show so many years ago I couldn't say for sure. The problem is the cases that hold the videos. They are the worst cases I've ever seen. Specifically the mechanism that holds the discs in place and in order doesn't do it's job. There are seven boxes with seven seasons of the show. I opened the first season to find that all the discs had come free from their place holders and stacked themselves on top of each other. Everyone of them were horribly scratched. I've wanted this series for so long I find myself torn. I know I should send them back because they are damaged but I'm tempted to keep them and forgive the scratches if they work correctly.

I'm disgusted that I paid 129 dollars US for a bunch of scratched discs. I'm very careful with my media and it sickens me that the worst looking discs in my collection are brand new. Once again though I am certain that all discs in these holders/boxes will be damaged. If I reorder the next set may be worse. For now I am keeping them. Not because they are the cream of the crop as they should be but because they are cream of the crap and I won't do any better reordering.",1488153600,5,1538,4.1925675675675675

This one is not just a remake (although they do re-do a few of the original series' episodes), it is very high-quality TV from any perspective, excellent science-fiction and drama with amazing variety -- intelligent, frequently surprising, generally satisfying.  Some stories are not the best, but the quantity of true original gems merit 5 stars!  Of the 7 seasons I originally followed on broadcast TV, I missed probably 60% of it, so this is mostly delightfully new to me.  I don't get the complaints about omitted nude scenes (which is not my purpose for buying this anyway) -- seems to be more than I imagined in this set.  In some episodes the video quality is a bit rough in places yet not enough to spoil the viewing.  The plastic-case packing is just fine (so far).

The edits and censoring in this Canadian version are minimal and don't interfere with the stories. The audio and video are good within the limits of pre-digital TV. The technology and special effects are about at the level that you would expect for a 20 year old TV series. My three favorite episodes are ""Glitch"", about an android who successfully embodies a scientist's best ethical self, ""A Stitch in Time"" about a scientist who uses a time machine to stop serial murderers and ""Valerie 23"" about a murderously jealous android. One downside of the series is the consistently negative and unfair portrayal of people in the military and their ethics and motivation.",1418515200,3,857,5.085106382978723

4336037,3,B004E5BQDW,"I bought this set on another site, but since there is so much controversy and confusion concerning censorship, picture quality, and packaging, I decided to post a review treating of each season alone with regard to these issues.

Season 1: I own both the earlier MGM release and this one.  The content is identical, particularly regarding ""Valerie 23"" and ""Caught in the Act.""  Digitally remastered; picture quality is a solid 8.5-9/10.  Standard issue and quality of DVD case; discs arrived unscratched; easy to remove and replace the discs in and out of the case w\o damaging them.  Off to a good start.

Season 2: ""Paradise"" edited for nudity.  All other episodes uncut, uncensored for nudity; digitally remastered.  Picture quality a solid 9/10.  Standard type and quality of DVD case; discs arrived unscratched; easy to remove and replace the discs in and out of the case w\o damaging them.  Still happy.

Season 3:  Now I know what the gripe is about.  DVD case is poorly designed; discs difficult to remove and replace without scratching.  Picture quality appears to be direct transfer from VHS with no digital enhancement; near bootleg quality; 6-6.5/10.  Heavily edited for nudity/language, esp. disappointing in the first regard is ""Bits of Love.""

Season 4:  New, good packaging, but the problem of poor (VHS) picture quality persists; 6-6.5/10.  Heavily edited content; in particular, if you are looking for the unedited version of ""Lithia,"" you won't find it here.

Season 5:  They did such a good job of restoring the picture quality of the first two seasons that I have to ask myself again why they stopped there; again a disappointing 6-6.5/10.  Heavily censored for nudity/language.  If you are looking for the uncut version of the ""Human Operators"" et. al., I hope you copied it off of Showtime.  Good packaging.

Season 6:  Ditto season 6.  Picture quality an abysmal 6-6.5/10; this, as seasons 3-5, almost unbearably bad to watch in terms of picture quality.  Nudity/language, completely censored.  Good packaging.

Season 7: Digitally remastered.  Picture quality 8.5-9/10.  Episodes content is unaltered from the original showing.  This is because the SciFi channel took over production of the 7th season and produced a nudity/obscenity free final season of the series.  Good packaging.

The series was apparently assembled carelessly, with terribly uneven product quality and censorship.  I suppose Alliance feels that it has its audience and will get its numbers regardless of the attention it devotes to providing its customers with the very best product.  Unless you are a true devotee of the Outer Limits then, I would hold off purchasing all but seasons 1, 7, and perhaps 2, until such time digitally remastered, uncensored versions are available.",1405814400,131,2775,5.171171171171171

4336040,5,B004E5BQDW,"I love the show awesome.

th eonly concern I had with this product, was that the first season disks appear to be of lower quality than the rest. They were scratch right out of the package. I'm not sure if the one i recieved was a return that had been repackaged or not.",1397692800,2,269,4.0754716981132075
4336041,5,B004E5BQDW,"I was skeptical of buying this dvd pack. I had it in my cart and wish list for months and never went through with the purchase. When someone said ""censored"" my immediate thoughts were the Tom & Jerry cartoon dvd pack that took out content in fear of racial stereotypes. I figured that these dvd were somehow altered to be politically correct.

After doing some heavy research, I'm not convinced all the negativeness for this dvd are well placed. Reading over the history of how these dvds came to be, MGM first attempted to release season one to test the market to see if the sales were going to be good enough for further releases. The sales failed to meet their expectations and they decided to not release any further seasons. What you have to remember is that this series first aired on Showtime and like other hit Showtime and HBO shows, they managed their way to TV throughout North America. One such place is our nearest neighbor in the north, the Canadians. This series was aired on their TV for quite some time and they have similar rules to our cable TV shows in that they can't show explicit contents. With that in mind, like other TV shows, a Canadian company decided to release this similarly to how a TV show is released on DVD here in the USA. So the reality of it is that The Outer Limits is not really aimed at the American audience. It's a ""foreign"" region one DVD release aimed solely to Canadian viewers who will view the series just like how they remembered and in what you could call in their entirety as they had seen. It just so happen that we, citizens of the USA, get to purchase these thanks to the internet. You will not find any other seasons beyond season one at any retail stores here in the states.

With that fact in mind, I never seen the Showtime showing of this series. Remembering back to my to my childhood viewing of these shows, I only ever watched them on SciFi channel every so often. The one episode that made me want to buy this dvd pack was season three Dead Man's Switch. This episode had a lasting impression on me and after years of forgetting about it, I happened to stumble upon this again.

Like I said earlier, season one is like the Showtime release in that it has nudity and other adult content. Oddly enough, Canadian has a weird rule for their television. Depending on the time of day, nudity can be be shown on TV so long as it's not sexual in nature. With that in mind, depending on when the episode was aired, you might see some nudity on the other seasons. Bad languages and other TV disapproved items are removed from season two and beyond. One thing you'll notice is that every so often the film fades out or cut as if it is going to go into a commercial break. This is the proof that the seasons were once shown on TV.

As indicated, I never seen this on Showtime. So while I dislike the idea that I'm not seeing the entire series as it originally aired, I can't really say that it negatively impacts my viewing of the show. Also keep in mind that while nudity and other adult content are in this series, that doesn't mean that the show was somehow altered. The nudity and languages are rare and you can follow a guide online that explains what content each episode would have. Also, there is a separate DVD release that aims at showing nudity and adult content. The DVD is called ""Sex & Science Fiction"" and you can order it right here on Amazon as well.

If this is released in its original content, I will no doubt buy that to compare with this. However, at the current state of the release, I am happy with it. I do have to agree with some reviews that indicate the DVD were poorly packed. The dvds are held onto notches on the sides of the dvd. As such I could never latch it on correctly and in fear of breaking the dvd, I will pack it in a dvd case book that I have.

Also negative is that I'm very hard of hearing. I can't hear very well and luckily I have head sets to watch tv. Problem with these dvds is that it doesn't have close captioned or subtitles. So keep that in mind if you have a HOH or deaf person in your house. I know some people like subtitles to pick up some dialog as well so watch out for that fact.

Thus far I am loving this series. There are some really good episodes and watching them randomly is really nice. I personally like the series and in the future I hope the original Showtime episodes come out. However at this point and time that is looking very doubtful (MGM attempted to release the series in 2005 and in 2010 the Canadians decided to release) since it's been nearly 9 years since the first season was tested in the market.

Overall if you viewed this show on TV or if you really want to watch this series again, this is the best format you can get it in. I heard there are some online airing of it on popular streaming services but I cannot locate them on it anymore. With that in mind, this is the permanent way to watch the series. Just keep in mind that this isn't a USA release and that only season one is the original Showtime release. If you are happy with that, and then you'll be happy with this series.",1390089600,31,5120,4.287487073422958

All of the episodes were Canadian productions for original screening on SHOWTIME uncut in the USA.
I believe Sci-Fy (?) was handed the seventh season and it was cut or produced in a shorter format
for the inclusion of commercials. The original 6 seasons were then syndicated in cut versions to remove
scenes of sexual intimacy ('LITHIA')and other scenes which would not have gone over on commercial cable
TV. I look forward to eventually seeing the entire uncut versions of all episodes on DVD.",1363996800,37,558,4.822916666666667
4336046,1,B004E5BQDW,"These are heavily edited versions for general television consumption. The original series aired exclusively on Showtime network.

When those are released I will pay two or three hundred dollars for them.

Nobody should waste their money on this piece of crap.",1358812800,135,259,5.2926829268292686
4336047,4,B004E5BQDW,"This is a good set to have all seven seasons so that you can enjoy them now, since only the first season and themed sets are available in the original Showtime length. This is a product of the original studio (Atlantis Cananda which was bought out by Alliance)so it surprised me that they had the abbreviated versions which aired on Sy Fy. But I would suggest going ahead and buying this, then buying the original seasons as they come out in the unedited versions. I bought this set used for much less, so I won't have any trouble getting my money back out of this when I have all the unedited seasons.",1355788800,3,602,4.383928571428571
4336048,1,B004E5BQDW,"I was excited to finally have received these DVDs last night but inspected them [especially the cases] before doing anything. The reviews that I had read were full of complaints about the quality of the cases. The cases for seasons 1 thru 3 were OK. But the rest were damaged. It's ironic because the packaging was as close to perfect as I had ever seen and there were NO indications of ANY shipping damage. I can only assume that the product was treated roughly before shipping because the damage was ALL HIDDEN! Since there were so few of these COMPLETE SETS of THE OUTER LIMITS [new series] left, I attempted to play some of the DVDs. After trying [3] DVDs with no success on [2] players, I finally decided to return the shipment to AMAZON for a refund. I'm really disappointed!!!",1349136000,46,783,4.560283687943262

8426474,1,B004E5BQDW,"These do not have subtitles, nor closed captions.

Some (not all) of them are edited, since the original Showtime release had a little nudity.

But, Alliance chose to save a few pennies by leaving out the subtitles and captions!",1517702400,2,228,4.82051282051282
8426475,3,B004E5BQDW,"As many reviewers have already stated, these are the edited for television versions. But a lot of folks are a little misinformed. These were produced in Canada for Showtime. Showtime has the exclusive rights to the unedited versions. And for some unknown reason they have only released Season 1.

The Canadian company releasing these DVDs can only legally release the edited versions. While its a shame that Showtime gave up on this show, these DVDs remain the only way to get Seasons 2-7. Do what I did, buy the Showtime Season 1 release. Then get the remaining seasons from the Canadian version. While not ideal, until or if Showtime ever releases the remaining seasons, this is better than not having the show at all.

Final thought: while Im no prude and I definitely want the unedited versions, a little nudity or language removed does not ruin the episodes.",1517270400,5,863,4.824324324324325

8426478,3,B004E5BQDW,"Overall, I'm pleased to have this in my collection. Brings back memories. I clearly missed some episodes when they originally aired. My concerns are that since it was filmed in the mid '90s, and not remastered, the picture quality is not the best on most episodes so far. Also the volume is pretty low and there is no Closed Captioning available so I have to crank it up to about 80% to not miss anything. I'm finding myself skipping back to pick up the dialogue. Normally I have CC on all the time, except sporting events.",1506816000,3,523,4.458333333333333
