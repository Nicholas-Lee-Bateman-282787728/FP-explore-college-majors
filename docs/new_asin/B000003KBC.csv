1179016,1,B000003KBC,"With this third entry in the heretofore entertaining series, THE BAD NEWS BEARS franchise really struck out.  While the first had the blessing of Walter Matthau and Tatum O'Neal and the freshness of the little hellions trying to be champs, and the second at least had the Bears finally winning, this third entry is so bad that there's nary a chuckle in sight---and the ball players play very little baseball.  One has to wonder why Tony Curtis signed on for this one.  The writer also made the mistake of focusing too much on Curtis' role as the sleazy promoter/hustler and let the kids merely form a background ploy for Curtis' illwritten character.  The boys make the mistake again of not having a coach; they play ball awful; and by now their once humorous hijinx are merely annoying.  Trying to mature Jackie Earle Haley to an amorous love interest for a young Geisha girl also misses the mark.  In all three movies, we've watched this near juvenile delinquent smoke, drive illegally, drink beer and act basically obnoxious...fortunately, he's not in this one too much, but his mere presence only serves as a reminder to the real fault of this franchise:  bratty kids can only be funny for a short time and then they are merely brats.  Fortunately, this third entry pretty much ended the series, even though a short-lived tv show followed and this year's remake with Billy Bob Thortnon.  Let's hope the latest remake doesn't inspire any more insipid sequels.",1124409600,3,1462,4.816
1179017,1,B000003KBC,"There is an entity all child actors fear.  A malignent, evil force that will hunt them down, destroy them, leave them desolate.  It is (gasp of gasps!) PUBERTY!!!

Yes, puberty!  That irreverible right of passage that will turn their voices squeaky, their general appearance awkward looking - in short, it destroys them!  The smart movie producers realize this, they do not try passing, say, a sixteen year old off as a ten year old, it just does not work.

Unfortunately, though, some try.  The end result is usually disastrous, silly looking, mediocre at best.  With this in mind, I give you a classic casualty of puberty - The Bad News Bears Go To Japan.

The movie is based on a true story.  During the seventies, the little league players from Japan were so good the United States little league decided to pull out of the competition.  Based on this, you have the Bears, determined to play anyways, who go to Japan.  There are the usual hijinks, promoters want to make money at their expense, and so on.  It is meant to be funny, and has some amusing moments, but it just doesn't work out - the kids are too old!  The cutness is gone, the whole thing is stale, the movie degenerate into a farce.

There was some talk of still another Bears movie being made, in which they go to Cuba.  Fortunately, common sense (and the desire not to make what would have been a Bad News Turkey) prevailed, and the Bad News Bears were laid to rest.",1122508800,3,1436,4.486486486486487
1179018,3,B000003KBC,This movie rounds out the three Bears movies and helped pave the way to the short lived tv series of the same name. While there is very little baseball in this film (the filmmakers get to caught up with the idea of being in Japan and forget who the film is about) and Tony Curtis is not Walter Matthau (but who is?) the film still has its moments and isn't without the smallest of pleasures. A perfect film for kids around 7 years old who like baseball. All others need not bother.,1028678400,4,481,4.239130434782608
1179019,2,B000003KBC,"Oh CRUD!  Is this a baseball movie or a Japan documentary? If this was supposed to be a baseball movie of little league kids, they should have put a little more baseball in it. I like the humor however. But without Tanner and Lupus, the humor is dry.  It's just plain garbage!  I wish that they would get the TV series out on video too!!  It beats the crud out of this one!!",1007596800,7,374,4.082191780821918
1179020,1,B000003KBC,"""The Bad News Bears Go to Japan.""  After all, where else could they go after playing in the Astrodome?  Unfortunately, a movie series that started with a movie that really didn't need a sequel, much less two, ends down by a run, two men on and a two-out pop-up in the bottom of the 9th.  Or 10th... or 15th... Another one of these movies and we're gonna have to get the commissioner's office involved.
 Tony Curtis strains mightily to get laughs out of some paper-thin material, and Jackie Earle Haley is way too old to be playing in this league.  The film involves his character in a cross-cultural romance, and pits the Bears against the Japanese national team, but the novelty has worn off.
 You're just going to be left wondering, ""Why did they bother to make this movie?  Free trip to Japan?""  If you're interested in how our national pasttime is played in the OTHER country where it's the national pasttime, check out the passable ""Mr. Baseball"" instead.  At least Tom Selleck has some believable moves.",981504000,2,1009,4.655367231638418

Loved the originals with Walter Matthau, et. al. especially because watching them is like time travel to a politically incorrect time that makes the 70s look like a foreign concept.",1370044800,,394,5.15625
1179259,1,B000003KBC,"After the first two movies in the series, which were pretty decent, I thought that was all there was. Howver, sometime later, I discovered that there was another film made, this one. However, I never had the chance to see it, either on tv, or on dvd.

Now, I know why. This piece of garbage is horrible! Save yourself the money and time and just skip it. Little action, insipid humor, just plain BAD!",1349222400,,400,4.405405405405405

Its humor and understanding of Japanese culture during 1970's Japan is interesting especially when Japan began to restructure 30+ years after WWII while modernising once again to help pave way to the electronic boom that the country has today!

Tony Curtis does a tolerable role as the manager for the Bears and Japanese Pro Wrestling legend Antonio Inoki makes a rare appearance outside Japan's culture setting to take part in the movie!

So if your interested in little league baseball, retro Japanese culture, and enjoy watching a good fun movie for you and your family, then this film is just what you have to see!",1340928000,,778,4.7555555555555555

1179262,1,B000003KBC,"There is one thing good about the second sequel of ""The Bad News Bears""; it was really shot in Japan. You shouldn't expect anything more than that in this horrible film. I was amazed that Paramount actually released the film back in 1978 in USA (in Japan next year).

The story is disjointedly told, making no sense at all. Led by a greedy entertainment mogul played by Tony Curtis, the Bears fly to Japan where, instead of playing baseball, they are seen fighting a pro wrestler in the ring. I am not kidding. Well, the fact is, there are two baseball game scenes, but they are so bland and insipid that I fell asleep during them.

In the poorly written sub-plot Jackie Earle Haley comes on to a young Japanese girl in kimono, following her everywhere. Some may call it stalking, but apparently the film couldn't come up with a better idea to tell a story. The main story's ""climax"" involves a sandlot game in Shinjuku, downtown Tokyo. Did they travel all the way from America for THIS?

Still I tried to find something positive about ""The Bad News Bears Go to Japan."" OK, here is the list, which is understandably short. 1) You can see young Rorschach of ""Watchmen""; 2) you can see young Antonio Inoki, a famous pro-wrestler; 3) and you can see young Kinichi Hagimoto, popular comedian of Japan (the TV show he hosts in the film really existed). Oh, and the film will also show you that they could eat McDonald's hamburgers in Japan. Yes, I know, for most English-speaking people, 2) and 3) mean nothing. As to 1), you may watch the first ""Bears"" film instead. The first installment has Walter Matthau and Tatum O'Neal, too.

The terrible story made me think the filmmakers just shot whatever they thought was interesting in Japan and put the footage together disregarding any logic or coherency - bullet train, Mt. Fuji, Kyoto (Heian Shrine, also seen in ""Lost in Translation""), pachinko parlor, karate, TV show and so on. Perhaps ""The Bad News Bears Go to Japan"" works better today as unintentional documentary.",1241481600,3,2015,4.68361581920904
