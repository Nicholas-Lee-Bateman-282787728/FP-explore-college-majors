8362380,5,B0006VMS6C,"This DVD teaches the 60 movement ""Yang Short Form"".  It shows the entire form once and then breaks down each movement into classroom training.  It seems like it was taped during classes at the teacher's school.  The best part of this program is that it shows students making mistakes and being corrected so you can be aware of the mistakes you, too, might make.  Each movement is also shown from a rear and side view with instructions on sinking and rising, and when to breathe in and out.",1147824000,7,489,4.5227272727272725
8362381,5,B0006VMS6C,"I found this a very helpful tape, even though I've taken some T'ai-chi.  This tape teaches you the finer points about how to use the body so that is moves smoothly and effortlessly, as you are supposed to do in T'ai-chi.  I  had memorized a series of movements (a form) but my body didn't flow.  With  this tape I now understand the details.  I actually apply the principles to  a different Yang style form than is shown in the tape.  You can simply use  the principles and apply it to any form (even though a particular form is  taught here).",959299200,5,543,4.34
