469145,5,6302453267,"The often sited deficiencies of Until the End of the World may be justified if you're a critical student of film.  However, it seems that such critics are so busy deconstructing the film that they miss the great  passion and humanity that Wenders has expressed.  Until the End of the  World defies many conventions, it's true.  It is peculiar.  But it's also  charming, beautifully shot and thought provoking; with the  authentic feel  of a true artist's  passionately realized vision.  It is one of those films  I regularly return to and appreciate more and more with each new viewing.",930441600,2,586,4.86734693877551

Many of my favourite movies I own as VHS tapes, and I love how they never skip like DVDs do after a while. Wenders is a mystic, and you get transported with this film. It is long and moody, and if you allow yourself to feel it, you will be changed by it. I put it in with my other favourites of his, as they are all tied together with many of the same actors and even playing the same characters (Winter, for example, is in at least two of his films). Of course his girlfriend, the Goddess Solveig shines as she always does. This is also William Hurt in his prime.

I immediately went out and bought the soundtrack also. I loved the idea that Wenders asked the artists to speculate and record what they thought their music would sound like in 9 or 10 years. Brilliant. So I've been a fan of the film for a long time and when I saw that his original vision was available on DVD a few years back I immediately went out and got an all region player (I live in the U.S.) so I could purchase and view it.

469289,5,6302453267,"What a truly amazing and beautiful film.  I bought the five plus hour Director's Cut (for $60 here!, but that's the lowest I could find anywhere) after seeing the shorter American release through Itunes, and really enjoyed seeing all the extra footage and missing scenes that Wenders was forced to snip in order to satisfy Hollywood.  The shorter version does have its merits, namely being a tighter streamlined sci-fi story, but it left me confused and lost.  The Wim Wenders approved Director's Cut is a whole other animal.  Here I discovered many scenes and dialogue which filled in all the gaps of confusion.  They're really two different films, and in the longer version one gets a clearer understanding of the nature of the love triangle between Claire, Gene and Sam.  Secondary characters like Philip Winter, Chico and Mario, and David and Burt (the Aboriginals) are allowed time and space to breathe, making them come across more fully rounded and interesting -- they each have their own compelling stories which I would have liked to seen even further developed actually.  The many subplots in the story are more fully explained than in the edited version and thus, more meaningful (some reviewers disagree and think there is already too much digression and not enough focus on the central characters, but this is Wender's great art experimentation and I think it should be viewed as such).  And not any less importantly or interesting, the travel scenery is expanded.  The main themes of over-reliance and personal obsession with technology couldn't be more prescient.  I love how Wenders takes Claire, and us, from our watery origins (Venice), to the city (Tokyo), to earth (Australia), and finally, into outer space -- with several excursions, some more purposeful than others, in between.  The amazing futuristic proto-I-pod dream reader that Dr. Farber creates is, symbolically, produced within a cave.  Mankind's foundational womb and nest; artistic and creative beginnings, and end.  Not only that, but the Aboriginal community they're hiding out with -- far away from the nuclear contamination that was (and is) a consequence of (American) military/technological man's arrogance -- are well represented as an entity in and of themselves by Wenders.  Their traditional speech, way of life, music and culture are a fascinating counterpoint to the more ""progressive"" side of mankind.

There's just so much in this movie that I for one would be very excited and interested in seeing Wender's intended nine hour version come to life.  Yes, nine hours!  In fact, I think I think I read somewhere that he intended more.  And yes, the five hour version here does drag in places, but again, this is a film where I enjoy being able to space out for a bit and just enjoy the ride -- like taking a train across Europe and just looking out the window.  Until the End of the World has a delightful and eclectic balance of drama, sci-fi, romance, travelogue and fun silliness to it like no other movie I can think of.  I like that Wenders manages to infuse a little slapstick comedy and fun at just the precise moments when the film might become didactic or too serious.  That said, I think it is a very profound movie.  If the acting isn't always moving or convincing that's because I think this is at heart an experimental film with an unwieldy scope that might actually benefit from even more time, but most certainly, a tighter script.  I do like it as it is, but one of my criticisms is that the writing and dialogue is  superficial or vapid in some spots, and the actors therefore aren't always convincing, or ""in"" character.  Claire is especially difficult I think because she's so ambiguous.  On the one hand she's this superficial, depressed party-girl running from party to party to punish her chating boyfriend/lover, and then after a seemingly inconsequential encounter at a phone/video/""Facetime"" booth with Sam, she's suddenly captivated enough by him to want to stock him around the world.  But on the other, she's this complex human being with emotional needs and a desire to understand herself and what she wants, for after all, she's still a young woman who doesn't really know what she wants to do with her life or who she is.  At times there seems to be some confusion as to how she's supposed to be played.  Likewise with Sam Farber.  So I think both Solveig Dommartin and William Hurt, both of whom I both like and dislike in these roles (leaning on the side of liking), could have benefited from even more space to develop their characters with more complexity.  That said, Max Von Sydow is the perfect Henry Farber, Jeanne Moreau is beautiful in her role as Edith Farber, and both Ernie Dingo and David Gulpili are perfect in their roles.  But now we're getting into War and Peace territory . . . and as it is, this Director's Cut is far and away superior to the commercial version which lacks crucial scenes and dialogue that take place between Claire and Gene, and Claire and Sam which adequately explain their individual personalities and self-interested motives.  For example, in the shorter version it's near impossible to understand why the hell Claire is partying solo in Venice to begin with, or why Gene would continue to follow her after she's left him (it's because Gene had cheated on her with her best friend Makiko but still loves her and is writing his story, this story, about her), or why in the hell Gene would manage to get along with Sam later on.  It's weird, I know, but the funny thing is that truth is often stranger than fiction and these kinds of odd trysts and emotional attachments (in the movie, it's all about obsession and personal interests), as most of us know from experience, are indicative of the awkward realities we sometimes find ourselves enmeshed in without knowing how we got there in the first place.  Wenders shows all this ""nuclear fallout"" as stemming from the nature of our twisted dreams and our incapacity, and unwillingness, to confront them.

Wow, I don't know where to start or end with this epic film!  You'll just have to find this longer version for yourself, which by the way, works very nicely on the used $20 Philips DVP 5990 DVD player I found at Goodwill (find instructions on internet for how to easily unlock region coding), because unfortunately, it is STILL!? unavailable in the good old US of A, nor are there any independent movie theaters out there that seem willing to show it -- very, very sad but who knows, maybe one day it'll happen close to you.  I for one would just love to see this on the big screen with an appreciative audience.  I'm so happy to have finally discovered this movie and am glad I purchased this German 3-DVD set.  It plays in English and there are some out-takes too, possibly scenes from Wender's original nine-hour plan, but also some amusing little bloopers.

Lastly, did I mention the amazing soundtrack?  Absolutely way ahead of its time and one of the best, with pop music, of any film I've ever seen.  There's some confusion from older comments here surrounding Peter Gabriel's Blood of Eden track and the airplane descent scene.  In the shorter, commercial version the track begins earlier, I think, and some people think it's missing altogether from the longer version.  Not true at all!  In fact, virtually all of the song -- all five or six minutes of it -- is played here.  Same with many of the other tracks throughout the movie.  Not only that, Wenders chooses to give us a few eerie moments of hearing nothing but the wind as the plane slowly glides down into the Australian desert just before softly introducing the ecstasy of Gabriel's Blood Eden.  It's far more delicate and smooth than the shorter version in which many pieces of the ensuing, iconic desert trek are also cut out.",1404518400,11,7817,4.79776119402985
469290,5,6302453267,"Wow, this movie was purchased as a laser disc from a friend and enjoyed it, when it saw was available as an extended director's addition on DVD, I had to have it; what a surprise on how much was cut out. It's an intellectual Science fiction film you truly need to pay close attetion to with all the twist and turns and jumping from country to country along with a Didgeridoo performing segment in the film which was not in the American release.

469291,5,6302453267,"Watching this movie is much like the road trip taken by Claire (Solveig Dommartin) as she globetrots after Sam (William Hurt) who is either a criminal or mysterious do-gooder. Don't be fooled by the thought that this movie is what you think it's about until you get to the point where you understand the purpose of the mysterious invention for the eyes and how it survived the end of the world. Once you get there, just like a road trip around the world, you'll end up discovering deeper mysteries which finally drive up what the real conflict in this movie is: Claire confronts her greatest weakness at the end of the world in herself.

Just a note... Max Von Sydow and Jeanne Moreau turn in wonderful performances that are long enough to enjoy. Additionally supporting performances are very well done and the soundtrack for this movie is legendary as it was created by acts who were hot in the 80s and were meant to be music as it would be in the future. For a 1991 movie about the future, it had a lot right about it but laughably some things that were wrong.

I haven't seen the director's cut, and maybe that was the problem. I thought both William Hurt and Solveig Dommartin were abysmal in this, I felt no emotion whatsoever for their characters. I thought Dommartin was so sublime and beautiful in Wings of Desire, so I can only assume that this disaster was a result of poor editing, or possibly because her presence was not especially compelling when she worked in English; her acting was really vacant in this thing. A friend warned me that this movie was deeply depressing, but I honestly couldn't muster up any sadness for anyone. It wasn't that the story moved too slowly, either, I just felt that pieces--some kind of crucial chunks of character development, maybe--were missing. To be honest, I felt like it was too rushed. I would gladly have sat through a much longer version if I could have been given reasons to care about anyone in it.",1354838400,,1021,4.806818181818182

But if you thought that the theatrical release let you wanting to know more about the stories of this collection of characters then you will be very happy. The story is spread out and all the scenes are allowed to develop more organically.

But if you've enjoyed the shorter version of the film, you owe it to yourself to see the whole thing.

Story:
A brunette meets Jeff Bridges and falls in love. She becomes a blonde in order to follow him around the world until he agrees to take her home to meet his parents in Australia. Daddy is an inventor and mummy is blind, but that's ok, because mummy dies and everyone goes insane .. except that is, for the stalker  who follows the girl who is following JB. Her stalker boyfriend rescues her from her insanity and she becomes an astronaut.

4.5 hours of nicely shot scenery and overacting break-up the story line.

If you watch movies for their 'artistic' value, you might like this. If not, I suggest taking a few drugs before tackling this movie. The movie breaks-down nicely into 2 parts .. chasing people around the world and Australia. You could stop when they arrive in Australia and pick it up again .. say .. 10 years later and not miss anything.

469443,2,6302453267,"I stumbled on the existence of this movie as I was reading the Depeche Mode entry on Wikipedia. Apparently the soundtrack is quite the 90's time capsule. What I had read of it online (including here at Amazon reviews) intrigued me. Being a technology geek, the added prerequisite of tweaking a DVD player to be region-agnostic only added to the appeal.
I watched this expecting a quirky but somehow deep and involving experience. Unfortunately the film barely registers on that level. The titular premise - the impending possible end of the world - is set up quite well early on, but it doesn't figure nearly as much into the story as one would think. A great many potentially interesting characters are introduced, but it seems the filmakers run out of things to do with them and they just kind of hang around as the ""main"" characters do their thing.
The performances are mostly sub-par - there are too many occasions where I can imagine the director's instructions to the actors, with the actor not being entirely convinced of their motivation. The editing is very bad - poor continuity and flat-out sloppyness abound.
The interesting ideas the film brings up might redeem it, if it weren't so long and slow. Scenes are drawn out so much it seems his real motivation is to break a Guinness record for longest film. I knew it was long and had no problem with it - but the length just isn't justified by the content.
On a positive note, I was quite impressed with the vision of the future in the movie. Released in 1991, it depicted events of 1999-2001. It did a pretty good job anticipating many of today's technologies.
All in all, I had a very open mind going in and came away very disappointed. I don't expect to try and watch this again - maybe I'll try to sell it here at Amazon.",1292112000,6,1785,4.56386292834891

I've been looking for that Wim Wenders' masterpiece in DVD and it was not easy to find outside Amazon. The 3-DVD box set is in a marvelous hard-paper designed box, excel printed, there is also a small booklet included with a brief explanation about the film production, signed by the director himself and the director's filmography released in DVD editions. That great 3-DVD box set is also the DIRECTOR'S CUT edition dated 2005, so I consider it a ""must have"" edition for Wim Wenders collectors! The DVD film quality is fantastic, the sound is really stereo and I could feel the surround sound effect(I've watched it on an ordinary LED TV-Monitor with 2 small speakers plugged in)and the soundtrack is a reunion of top singers and music players. Important note: it is a German edition, so everything is written in German, there is only subtitles in German. I was a little bit disappointed because I thought it would have subtitles in other languages too, like French or English. The language of the film is both English and French or dubbed in German. There are scenes in French too, so you shall know a little bit of French to have a better comprehension of the film story...  The total time of the film trilogy is about 279 min. Screen format 1,78:1(anamorph) DVD region 2/8 color system PAL (you must have a DVD player able to play all regions with double NTSC / PAL color system).

469450,5,6302453267,"This film, Until the End of the World (UTTEOTW), has long been called the ultimate road movie or even the greatest road movie ever made. Sometimes when I read stuff like that I cringe and think that this film is far greater than that and calling it a road movie does it a sort of disservice. I've watched this film probably hundreds of times (hate to admit) and in every different format available and have weighed this film, measured this film and only found myself wanting to see it again.

Sure, the film spans 15 cities and 7 different countries and has more story arcs than Los Angeles has McDonalds but the more I watch the film the more I feel that this is less of a road movie and more of a biopic of the fictitious would-be scientist, Sam Faber and his over-bearing family.

I feel that UTTEOTW is a much greater contribution to modern film then most are willing to admit and could quite possibly be one of the greatest films ever made. This film has the same kind of public ground swell audience that Casablanca, The Wizard of Oz and Blade Runner have. All these movies preformed badly in the box office but are seen as some of best cinema that man or woman has been able to bring forward.

UTTEOTW has been seen by many to be a failure of sorts because of the immense runtime and the resolution set in Australia that is almost an entire third of the film, in all versions. It seems, historically now, that the studio execs thought that it would be inappropriate to subject any audience to five hours of film and that the American audience was too daft and wouldn't buy the whole concept, thus kicking off the mess that the film has gone through for almost twenty years now. Yes, it has been almost that long now.

The film in different edits, according to lore, has gone from a 20 hour version, that Wim Wenders had vehemently held position on for almost six months before acquiescing to releasing a `meager' 8 hour version and then later produced a 5 hour version. He was horrified when the studio forced a 151 minute version that he looks back at in complete disdain and refers to as the `Readers Digest version' and has stated that it is `unwatchable'. I don't know about the 8 and 20 hour version and which is better, because I and many others have not seen it, but I have seen the 5 hour version many times and now look at it as vastly superior (in presentation) to the theatrical release, but the theatrical release is far from unwatchable and is actually the version that the majority of the audience is familiar with and enjoy.

Wenders suffers from the same ills as Ridley Scott does, as he sees his films his way and not the way the world sees them, and that's perfectly fine. Ridley Scott doesn't like the Harrison Ford `Philip Marlowe' narration while an immense group of the fans loved it, myself included. Wenders doesn't like the theatrical release while most of the world is awed by it.

So, when the audience did see this film, it was the beginning of a new decade and Wenders, like Werner Herzog or David Lynch, had built up a core audience of supporters worldwide that appreciated his films for storytelling, the movement and the sheer reverence that seemed to manifest on screen. UTTEOTW came out at probably the very beginning of the emergence of the modern independent film movement that has now firmly taken over the industry. Even though they had budgeted $23 Million dollars for production, a lot of the funds came because of the acclaim given to Wings of Desire again with Solveig Dommartin, but the money didn't necessarily make this film the typical large-budget studio film that others were producing around the same time for the same funds when this came out. A quick search of movies released in 1991 shows an abysmal year aside from Jonathan Demme's masterpiece `Silence of the Lambs'.

This movie is undoubtedly Wenders greatest work, and I have watched every film he's put out - before and since. Sometimes I see glimpses of this film in his other works and can tell that this film's reception in the world still weighs heavily on his mind. Like Al Gore, he's traveled the globe giving lectures with his film and has his own ideas about its impact and what more can be done. It seems that some of the legal battles may never go away, specifically the ones that are associated with Warner Brothers.

Recently, a Region 2 PAL version was released into the market, and when I watched it I could tell it probably didn't have the stamp of approval from WB. The quality shows it to be almost a straight VHS transfer from a low-end computer system which puts a lot of visual noise on the screen and in the audio. Some people who have purchased this version have complained, but really I don't see anything wrong with it as it's just a full-frame DVD that will suffice for now for those looking for the 158 min on DVD.

My recommendation when it comes to versions is to purchase the 3 Disc Director's Cut set from Amazon.co.uk and just live with the fact that the first fifteen minutes of dialogue that's had with Solveig and Chico are in French with no subtitles. If you watch the film you can pretty much get the gist of what's being said anyways, Chico needs more beer, he likes the Beatles, sex and Solveig tells you how much you can buy a goat for in Ethiopia.

I had read in January of 2007 that Solveig had died of heart failure and was deeply saddened as I found her to be an incredibly unique talent and hypnotizing to see on the big screen. I would have loved to have seen her star in a few more films and even break back into the American marketplace. What a shame she's now gone, she'll be missed for sure.

I've put a list of all the different versions below, that are available and that I own, so you could get an idea of what's going on with this movie and its debacle of a distribution:

1991 VHS Tape Theatrical Release 158 mins
1991 R2 Samsung Japanese Laserdisc 179 mins
2004 PAL R2 Italian 3 Disc Set 280 mins
2004 PAL R2 UK 3 Disc Set Director's Cut 280 mins
2007 PAL R2 UK 1 Disc VHS Transfer 158 mins

Regarding the last release, I recently discovered that the difference in the run-time is due to PAL speed-up adjusting it 4%, from 158 mins to 151 mins.

For those in America interested in seeing these films but are worried about the DVD Regions / PAL difference. Don't fret because there are some very easy ways to set your DVD player to Region 0 which will make your player Region free and you can watch all movies from around the world. Videohelp dot com has most players remote codes which will help you easily make the adjustment. I've changed all my players this way and have been happy ever since.

469451,5,6302453267,"At its core, this is a film about the sometimes-destructive nature of obsession - the central character's obsession with the object of her desire, her former lover's obsession with quantifying their relationship, the obsession of bounty hunters with their quarry, the obsession of a son's desperate hope for his father's approval and that father's obsession with cutting-edge science taking precedence over any interpersonal considerations - with the exception of his obsessive love for his wife. This film is an epic, dream-like study of the human cost of all-consuming passion.

It's also a lot of fun. Wim Wenders was smart enough to place the timeline of events in this film no more than ten years on from shooting, thus taking advantage of newly-emergent technology showcased in ingenious ways as well as avoiding the dated look that plagues many science fiction films a decade or two after their release.

The soundtrack is amazing. I have personally worn-out or loaned-out seven separate cds and cassettes. It has been the soundtrack of my life for the better part of 15 years.

As a final word I would like to add that this film resembles a lucid dream state, one of those dreams you awaken from and attempt to describe (""...Well, then I was in Australia, and there were these guys chasing me so I got in a plane and then I was in a laboratory, except it was in a cave..."")

This film begins with a dream and it ends with several recovering dream addicts adrift on a planet which appears to be recovering from a nightmare, a nightmare they seemed to have missed entirely in the all-encompassing pursuit of their heart's desires.",1220400000,6,1636,4.853046594982079
469452,2,6302453267,"There's a curious symmetry to seeing a film set eight years in a future that's now eight years in the past, but the 279-minute director's cut of Wim Wenders' Continent-hopping sci-fi road movie Until the End of the World feels more like a notebook with the odd doodle in the margin rather than a clearly thought-out film, never getting to grips with any of the themes or ideas it throws up and casually abandons along the way. Words versus images (surprisingly Wenders comes down firmly on the power of the word), art versus technology, impulse versus commitment, the struggle to find meaning in the places you find yourself and people's ability to constantly start over, be it in art, science or life - none get much more than a cursory once-over as it becomes ever clearer that Wenders' destination is more geographical than thematic.

Set in a still far-off 1999, when America's plans to shoot an out of control nuclear satellite out of the sky lead to mild economic and social chaos as the possibility of a chain reaction and the end of the world looms, it's something of a shaggy dog story following Solveig Dommartin's bored party girl across four continents. Surviving a car crash, she looks for a mission in the new life she has been given and finds it in the form of William Hurt's fugitive, who steals some stolen money she's holding for Chick Ortega and Eddy Mitchell's robbers. Following him across the globe with the aid of Rudiger Vogler's private eye and followed herself by her ex and the film's narrator (Sam Neill) and Ernie Dingo's bounty hunter, several countries and a couple of aliases later she discovers he's recording images of his family for his blind mother (Jeanne Moreau) with a camera that allows the blind to see that was developed by his father (Max Von Sydow), in hiding from the US government in Australia...

As long as the film is moving from city to city, Wenders is able to sustain some semblance of the illusion of forward motion, but the film stops dead in its tracks when it reaches Australia, which is a big problem. Not only is the end of the world still a long way off, but so is the end of the film - with more than two hours to go it's hard to disguise the fact that there's not much to show for all the mileage covered. If anything, it feels a bit like a long business trip to a place you've never been with people from your office only to find that your appointment's been postponed once you finally arrive, but since the hotel room's already paid for you find yourself sticking around for a day or so anyway killing time. The film does get back on track in the last half hour as the characters become addicted to their own dreams and become completely unable to cope with reality, but you can't help feeling it could have got there a lot quicker.

While Neill, Vogler and Hurt fare well enough and Von Sydow has one good scene, co-scenarist and leading lady Solveig Dommartin makes a poor focus for such a sprawling endeavour. Another in that long line of muses - Catherine Hessling, Cybill Shepherd, Sondra Locke - luring once great directors onto the rocks with their siren call of mediocrity, she's not much of an actress with little screen presence to compensate, while her English delivery doesn't do her many favours. It's telling that one of her best scenes is a (presumably) deliberately awful but surprisingly charming rendition of Thank You For the Days accompanied by piano, drums and didgeridoo that makes up with enthusiasm what it lacks in ability. Still, compared to Adelle Lutz's horrendously awkward phonetic delivery as her best friend Makiko, she's Sarah Bernhardt.

But no film with a hero called Trevor can be all bad, and for all the self-indulgence there are enough good points to keep you watching. Some of Neill's narration is rather good (possibly down to co-writer Peter Carey), there's an eclectic soundtrack that takes in Peter Gabriel, Talking Heads, Lou Reed, Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds, R.E.M., Elvis Costello and pompous soft-rockers U2 among many others, Robby Muller's cinematography is typically impressive and the film makes the outskirts of San Francisco look like a Third World shantytown. Some of the predictions were at least in the right ballpark - satnav systems, the Americans shooting a rogue satellite out of the sky and a joke about the Rolling Stones' 'last' concert - and it only gives into outright xenophobia in a horribly misconceived comic scene in a Japanese hotel. Yet the film is definitely less than the sum of its parts, with Wenders all too clearly going all Hearts of Darkness as he constantly seems to rework the slim premise into whatever latest brainwave has just struck him - with an African epilogue unfilmed, if the producers hadn't pulled the plug he'd probably still be shooting to this day. (As it is, the German DVD has another half hour of deleted scenes and outtakes and it wouldn't be entirely surprising if Wenders delivered an even longer cut some time in the future.)

469504,4,6302453267,"Wim Wenders established himself as the quintessential art house foreign film director in the 1980s.  He had his critically claimed road movies and the well loved ""Wings of Desire"" under his belt.  His style is hard to pin point, but if there is one word that could be used, it is exploration.  Whether it be in travels or in the human condition, it is something that his characters do.  ""Until the End of the World"" epitomizes exploration, and consequently, begs for repeat viewings.

The title itself holds so many meanings.  There are two literal ones.  The first being that the film involves a chase around the world for the elusive William Hurt character.  The second being the fear that the world would end at the turn of the millenium.

But that doesn't even begin to scratch the clever layering of meaning within the film.  Wenders loves exploring the depth of the characters, even after the chase is over, he lets us visit with them a little longer.  While we're doing that, the characters are going deeper and deeper in trying explore themselves through the use of devices that allow people to see their dreams.  And we do get to see this in the American 158 minute version.  Although this is regarded by the director as a heavily truncated version of his vision, it's still highly watchable and entertaining.

The film is also notable for it's interesting look and concept.  Wenders isn't venturing too far into the future here, but places subtle glimpses of what he felt it might look 9 years from when the film was made in 1991.  He actually does a credible job and shows a genuine curiosity for science in this film.

This also boasts one of the best soundtracks period.  Wenders has had some allegiances with some great bands or artists over the years.  Included here are prominent Wenders collaboraters U2 and Nick Cave as well as a number of alternative icons like R.E.M., Elvis Costello, and the wonderful score by the nearly infallible Graeme Revelle.

The structure of the film can be very off putting for the regular film goer and I must admit that when I first watched it, it through me for a loop.  Wenders is not satisfied with giving you merely a human drama or action story and is known for shifting gears in his films.  What starts as cat and mouse chase story shifts into an exploration of the human condition through the use of dreams, looking into people's obsession with them.  It makes for an odd watch that if you are pleased with, you might have another go round.

This is an excellent movie surely worthy of another look and possibly a DVD release.  It wasn't well understood when it came out and Wenders grand idea probably wasn't ready for the US quite yet.  I'd be willing to give this film another while, be it the 158 minute version or 280 minute trilogy version available in other regions.  While many may disagree, I do think Wenders succeeded in creating his ultimate road movie - and a little bit more.",1202169600,,2945,4.624277456647399
469505,5,6302453267,"I am writing this review on January 27, 2008, on a day on which the newspaper headlines scream about a hazardous US spy satellite which will crash to Earth some time in the next 30 days. Of course, my first thought is: ""Man, I've got to watch Until the End of the World. Wim, you're a prophet!""

But now I am struck with the dilemma: do I watch the 5-hour version I have on DVD, or do I watch the 2 hour version I have on a scrappy old VHS tape? I didn't need to consider it very long; I much prefer the 2-hour (short) version, and here's why.

There is one scene which I consider critical to the mood and poetry of the film. It is possibly the greatest, most emotion-evoking scene I have ever witnessed. And inexplicably, it is missing from the 5-hour (long) version. If you've seen the theatrical (short) version, you know what I'm talking about; it's the climactic ""end of the world scene"" with Peter Gabriel's 'Blood of Eden' playing. I get chills just thinking about it. And this scene exists only on the short version.

Wim Wenders has harshly criticized the short version, calling it ""unwatchable"" and ""the Reader's Digest version"". But I believe he is swayed by artists' arrogance. Apparently there was a bitter feud surrounding the cutting of his 5-hour epic, and Wim resents it to this day. But to us, the objective audience, we can see that the short version came out much more lucid, focused and poetic in its simplicity. And, whether by serendipity or unconscious design, certain scenes like the ""end of the world"" scene were ironically augmented by their edits.

I could ramble on longer about how brevity is often superior to verbosity, but that would clash with the verbosity of my post which I admit is already too bloated and overinflated with redundant phrases like ""bloated and overinflated."" Heh.

I wish someone would edit this post down to a manageable 2 paragraphs, condense it, distill it, focus it and make it more powerful in its simplicity. And it would be nice to add some Peter Gabriel, too ;)",1201392000,15,2023,4.592797783933518
469506,5,6302453267,"This film, Until the End of the World (UTTEOTW), has long been called the ultimate road movie or even the greatest road movie ever made. Sometimes when I read stuff like that I cringe and think that this film is far greater than that and calling it a road movie does it a sort of disservice.  I've watched this film probably hundreds of times (hate to admit) and in every different format available and have weighed this film, measured this film and only found myself wanting to see it again.

Sure, the film spans 15 cities and 7 different countries and has more story arcs than Los Angeles has McDonalds but the more I watch the film the more I feel that this is less of a road movie and more of a biopic of the fictitious would-be scientist, Sam Faber and his over-bearing family.

I feel that UTTEOTW is a much greater contribution to modern film then most are willing to admit and could quite possibly be one of the greatest films ever made. This film has the same kind of public ground swell audience that Casablanca, The Wizard of Oz and Blade Runner have. All these movies preformed badly in the box office but are seen as some of best cinema that man or woman has been able to bring forward.

UTTEOTW has been seen by many to be a failure of sorts because of the immense runtime and the resolution set in Australia that is almost an entire third of the film, in all versions. It seems, historically now, that the studio execs thought that it would be inappropriate to subject any audience to five hours of film and that the American audience was too daft and wouldn't buy the whole concept, thus kicking off the mess that the film has gone through for almost twenty years now. Yes, it has been almost that long now.

The film in different edits, according to lore, has gone from a 20 hour version, that Wim Wenders had vehemently held position on for almost six months before acquiescing to releasing a `meager' 8 hour version and then later produced a 5 hour version. He was horrified when the studio forced a 151 minute version that he looks back at in complete disdain and refers to as the `Readers Digest version' and has stated that it is `unwatchable'. I don't know about the 8 and 20 hour version and which is better, because I and many others have not seen it, but I have seen the 5 hour version many times and now look at it as vastly superior (in presentation) to the theatrical release, but the theatrical release is far from unwatchable and is actually the version that the majority of the audience is familiar with and enjoy.

Wenders suffers from the same ills as Ridley Scott does, as he sees his films his way and not the way the world sees them, and that's perfectly fine. Ridley Scott doesn't like the Harrison Ford `Philip Marlowe' narration while an immense group of the fans loved it, myself included. Wenders doesn't like the theatrical release while most of the world is awed by it.

So, when the audience did see this film, it was the beginning of a new decade and Wenders, like Werner Herzog or David Lynch, had built up a core audience of supporters worldwide that appreciated his films for storytelling, the movement and the sheer reverence that seemed to manifest on screen. UTTEOTW came out at probably the very beginning of the emergence of the modern independent film movement that has now firmly taken over the industry. Even though they had budgeted $23 Million dollars for production, a lot of the funds came because of the acclaim given to Wings of Desire again with Solveig Dommartin, but the money didn't necessarily make this film the typical large-budget studio film that others were producing around the same time for the same funds when this came out. A quick search of movies released in 1991 shows an abysmal year aside from Jonathan Demme's masterpiece `Silence of the Lambs'.

This movie is undoubtedly Wenders greatest work, and I have watched every film he's put out - before and since. Sometimes I see glimpses of this film in his other works and can tell that this film's reception in the world still weighs heavily on his mind. Like Al Gore, he's traveled the globe giving lectures with his film and has his own ideas about its impact and what more can be done. It seems that some of the legal battles may never go away, specifically the ones that are associated with Warner Brothers.

This review is for the above product as well, the Region 2 PAL version which was recently released into the market. When I watched it I could tell it probably didn't have the stamp of approval from WB. The quality shows it to be almost a straight VHS transfer from a low-end computer system which puts a lot of visual noise on the screen and in the audio. Some people who have purchased this version have complained, but really I don't see anything wrong with it as it's just a full-frame DVD that will suffice for now for those looking for the 151 min VHS version on DVD. I recently discovered that the difference in the run-time is due to PAL speed-up adjusting it 4%, from 158 mins to 151 mins. The supposed essay that accompanies this DVD is on-screen text about the film which is basic information about the film.

My recommendation when it comes to versions is to purchase the 3 Disc Director's Cut set from Amazon.co.uk and just live with the fact that the first fifteen minutes of dialogue that's had with Solveig and Chico are in French with no subtitles. If you watch the film you can pretty much get the gist of what's being said anyways, Chico needs more beer, he likes the Beatles, sex and Solveig tells you how much you can buy a goat for in Ethiopia.

I had read in January of 2007 that Solveig had died of heart failure and was deeply saddened as I found her to be an incredibly unique talent and hypnotizing to see on the big screen. I would have loved to have seen her star in a few more films and even break back into the American marketplace. What a shame she's now gone, she'll be missed for sure. If there ever was a audio commentary made with Solveig, I would sure like to hear it, so there's always reason for another release.

I've put a list of all the different versions below, that are available and that I own, so you could get an idea of what's going on with this movie and its debacle of a distribution:

1991 VHS Tape Theatrical Release 158 mins
1991 R2 Samsung Japanese Laserdisc 179 mins
2004 PAL R2 Italian 3 Disc Set 280 mins

Don't fret because there are some very easy ways to set your DVD player to Region 0 which will make your player Region free and you can watch all movies from around the world.

I'm only through the first disc, but I can say, the color, sharpness, and over-all quality of the transfer is stunning, even when converted from PAL back to NTSC on the $20-after-rebate RCA DRC2479N (occasional scenes show some jiggling in the detail, but otherwise, this transfer is so sharp it makes me wonder why anyone bothered to invent artifact-filled HDTV).

Slightly annoying is the lack of English subtitles on the French-language scenes.  So far the main French scene was familiar enough from the US-theatrical version, but for new viewers who don't speak French, this is a slight but serious disadvantage.

469541,5,6302453267,"Back in the early nineties, I used to rent this at least once a year. Recently, I finally gave up waiting for the DVD and got a used VHS version. Although it shows its age in certain respects, it is still one of the most extraordinary and moving films I have ever seen.

Given when it was made (pre-Windows, pre-Internet), it's not surprising that some of the future technology shown appears a bit dated. A surprising amount, however, is still ahead of its time - including the centerpiece of the whole movie, a camera that can record its user's experience of seeing and convey it to a blind person. Things that are familiar TV standbys today, such as being able to search a facial database, or track credit card use around the world, were ahead of their time, and are used to great effect. There is one particular animation that plays during a search (The Bounty Bear) that still beats anything I've seen on a search engine.

A thoroughly international film, the first half moves at a pretty fast pace, involving a chase that goes around the world, from Europe across Asia, to America and finally to Australia. The second half changes theme and slows down considerably, which can take some getting used to. It also, however, gives a chance to explore the capabilities and implications of the 'camera for the blind' to great effect - especially when it starts to be used for recording people's dreams.

There are some great supporting characters (especially Chico and the German detective Winters) in addition to the leads. The film also incorporates Australian Aborigines in an essential way as a strong counterpoint to the (ultimately) out-of-control explorations of technology.

The soundtrack is amazing in its own right, ranging from a wonderful recording of pygmy children singing to Peter Gabriel's 'Blood of Eden' (sadly missing from the sountrack album&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Until-The-End-Of-The-World-Music-From-The-Motion-Picture-Soundtrack/dp/B000002LQZ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Until The End Of The World: Music From The Motion Picture Soundtrack</a>), U2's title track and many others.

It's on my short list of actually good cyberpunk films (Blade Runner, Strange Days, and this one).  It is epic-length, to be sure, even on the cut version I saw in the US, but Wenders manages to hold your attention through an atmosphere which is dreamlike and hypnotic (in keeping with the final goals of the protagonists).  It is just this strange quality which makes the end portion of the film as effective as it is--you begin to question how much of a grasp on reality we have in the first place, let alone how much value it is to lose ourselves alone in technological coccoons made of dreams.

Throughout Solveig Dommartin's pursuit of the elusive Sam Farber/Trevor McPhee (William Hurt), Wenders examines how technology invades our privacy, making it nearly impossible for Hurt's character to slip Claire's grasp. In this seemingly Utopian vision of the future, all movements are traced with GPS precision, and society's citizens are little more than thrill-seeking voyeurs. Then, in the final episode, after the world has ""ended"", the director asks the crucial questions he has been leading us toward: What happens when technology finally invades and distorts our memories? What becomes of privacy when even our dreams are subject to public -- and to our own -- scrutiny? More than our latter-day cinematic obsession with serial killers and increasingly bizarre horror stories, Wenders considers one of the most urgent philosophical challenges facing 21st Century humans: How do we distinguish ourselves from the technology that both serves and enslaves us? How do we prevent our becoming merely a cog in the wheel?

From the brilliant cinematography to the haunting soundtrack (that works well on its own -- AMG says it is perhaps the best of the 90s), this is filmmaking at its finest. It's a shame Americans can't see it on DVD.",1173139200,5,1502,5.080971659919029

469548,4,6302453267,"The 158 minute US Video version features some fine moments, but you cannot help but feel that this is a ""reader's digest"" version, as the director Wim Wenders calls it in the extras of this expanded, nearly 5 hour cut of his epic.  Homer is explicitly alluded to in both versions of the film and certainly the length of the director's cut broadens and deepens the epic feel.  However, much of the new narration by Sam Neill is rather poorly written and overly descriptive.  In the 158 minute version it was rather more understated and effective.  The 3 part version of the director's cut is perhaps best expanded in the first and third discs, while the second disc features the least amount of change and possibly the most disappointing of changes: the use of Peter Gabriel's ""Blood of Eden"" (strangely missing from the soundtrack CD and only available on long out of print CD single import) during William Hurt and Solveig Dommartin's flight in Australia.  Most of the new footage involves Dommartin, whose less than effective performance shows even more warts in the expanded version.  There's not much new for William Hurt, whose equally ineffective performance hurts no more than it does in the 158 minute version.  There's a rather silly addition of an impromptu musical band in disc three, as well, that was best left on the cutting room floor.  Watching all discs at once is best avoided as the films drags a bit in the third act, despite an excellent performance by the always outstanding Max Von Sydow.  There's more of the supportive cast here, as well, which is a benefit: notably Sam Neill and Rudiger Vogler as the ubiquitous Philip Winter.  Despite Wenders' sloppy extended version, the film remains one of the more interesting foreign films from the early 90s, certainly has one of the best soundtracks in movie history.  All in all, I give it 4 out of 5 stars given its comfortable mix of genres: road movie, detective movie, sci-fi movie, romantic comedy, good performances from Jeanne Moreau, Sydow, Neill and Vogler, and some memorable footage of the underfilmed Australian outback.  For the novice, I would still suggest the 158 minute version which, despite its ""reader's digest"" feel, which in a number of spots seems somewhat superior to this ""director's cut"" .

469588,5,6302453267,"At its core, this is a film about the sometimes-destructive nature of obsession - the central character's obsession with the object of her desire, her former lover's obsession with quantifying their relationship, the obsession of bounty hunters with their quarry, the obsession of a son's desperate hope for his father's approval and that father's obsession with cutting-edge science taking precedence over any interpersonal considerations - with the exception of his obsessive love for his wife. This film is an epic, dream-like study of the human cost of all-consuming passion.

It's also a lot of fun. Wim Wenders was smart enough to place the timeline of events in this film no more than ten years on from shooting, thus taking advantage of newly-emergent technology showcased in ingenious ways as well as avoiding the dated look that plagues many science fiction films a decade or two after their release.

The soundtrack is amazing. I have personally worn-out or loaned-out seven separate cds and cassettes. It has been the soundtrack of my life for the better part of 15 years.

As a final word I would like to add that this film resembles a lucid dream state, one of those dreams you awaken from and attempt to describe (""...Well, then I was in Australia, and there were these guys chasing me so I got in a plane and then I was in a laboratory, except it was in a cave..."")

I'd like to gripe about the fact that the soundtrack, although impressive, was not remixed to keep the vocals either subdued, or more preferably removed completely. It causes some aggravating moments where you're not sure what you're supposed to be focusing on, and makes this seem even more removed from conventional cinematography.

The VHS version available for years simply does not do justice to the film, as it cuts out much of the film.

Shot on at least 4 different continents, this movie takes you on a glorious ride across numerous plots and subplots.  Where you end up at the end of the movie is so far removed from where you begin that you almost think you just watched 3 or 4 movies.  Some might use this as a major criticism, but I enjoyed that aspect of it.  But in fact, one of the underlying themes of the movie is the journey that all of us must take in our lifetime.  Our own lives have individual subplots taking place while the outside world spins out of control.  And our own subplots sometimes become intertwined with the lives of others - forever changing both of us.  Wim Wenders even describes it as ""the ultimate road movie"" ...
Sam Neill, William Hurt and, in particular, Solveig Dommartin, turn in great performances.  If you are a William Hurt fan, you will especially like this movive.  Personally, he's not one of my favorites, but he seems the perfect match for his role in this movie.
Also, don't be turned off by the sci-fi tag on this movie.  I suppose it is technically in that genre, but the sci-fi aspects are not at all extreme.  The primary sci-fi feature is...
One aspect that others have commented on is the fact that this video is only 3 hours long while the director's cut is nearly 5 hours.  Unfortunately, I have never seen the director's cut.  I suspect that some of the criticism that the movie is disjointed or jumps around too much is, in part, due to the shortening of the movie from its intended length.  In any event, I have heard rumors that the DVD will be out in 2003, and that the DVD may include a 5+ hour version.  I can't wait!",1027987200,7,1746,4.40625

He did not consider research what would happen until the real 1999. And what was that thing about the atomic satellite? It wasn't mentioned so much in the movie. You can see that the Soviet Union is actually still intact, even though it ceased to exist the coming year. Secondary, much of the picture was too much centered on Clarie (Solveig Dommartin). You do not get to see the plot real close. And what IS the plot? A man who invent a machine that can record real life and insert it's memories into another human, and the US govenment trying to find it? For their own purposes?

The plot is more than a little confusing, but essentially deals with Solveig Dommartin's character searching for William Hurt, who could (or could not) be an international industrial spy.  Sam Neill plays Dommartin's boyfriend, and to say that their relationship is an open one is an understatement...  The last quarter of the film drags...

I was looking for a unique film that I hadn't seen before, and from the glowing 5-star reviews throughout this page I thought this would be such a film.  Unfortunately, it doesn't even come close.  Long and boring with improbable  (no, impossible...no, incredulous) situations, this mess never made me care  for any of the characters, especially the two lead characters.  Did I  mention that it was loooonnnnnggggg?
To say that this isn't my type of  movie would be a gross understatement.  Everything, and I mean everything,  seemed contrived to the point of being ridiculous.  As the title indicates,  this story is based upon everyones' fear of impending doom as a nuclear  platform's orbit decays.  Funny thing is, except for the narrator stating  this on several occasions, no one in the film really seemed to care one way  or another (nor did I, since it wouldn't detonate the nuclear warheads  anyway).  Add to that, the impossible crossing of paths of cardboard  characters, and one is left with nothing but a jumbled mess.  How probable  is the following?:
1.  Two cars crash on an empty, open road (going in  the same direction, no less) and immediately the occupants become so  friendly that they trust each other and an oddball woman with millions of  dollars of stolen loot.
2.  Two strangers meet at a line of telephones  and there is immediate attraction...to the point that the female follows  this guy all over the world (this is where the travel log comes in).
3.  Two of the characters are hunting the protagonist (bounty hunters?), but  both are so comedic that the viewer feels absolutely no threat from either  of them (actually, I was hoping they would kill the protagonist, but  alas...).
4.  The future (uh, 1999) looks like 60's plastic  art-deco.
5.  The continuous narration was as mindless as the film.
I  could go on and on, but this film doesn't merit any more wasted time.  The  only positive note is that some of the locals were quite nice, and Max von  Sydow is always solid.  If you want to see this film because of all the  positive reviews, I suggest that you rent it first.  Between 1 and 10,  ""Until the End of the World"" gets a marginal 3.
I understand that the VHS  version I purchased was a shortened version (hard to believe), and because  of this the plot lines may have become jumbled, but in all honesty, I don't  think adding more minutes to this movie could possibly help it.",953337600,4,2483,4.669767441860465

Sony just released a Vid Phone, Duhhhhhhhh I am sure it  wouldn't be hard to get it hooked up by wireless internet, Duhhhhhh Well as  much as the producer knew in 1991 about the future, they came as close as  possible as anyone else. Today we do have a majority of the technology  displayed in the movie.  If anyone deserves to take credit for inventing  the internet, it is these guys. I think, the movie is really a rememberance  of what happened to each character rather than a third person version, as  noticed by the end of the movie.  We remember in levels of excitement and  suffering, so that is how this movie was constructed.",944956800,,866,4.283950617283951

This Wim Wender's epic has long been included in any of my Top 5,10, 50 etc lists of movies. Not only because it is a beautiful trip around the world circa 1990, a wonder-filled display of excellent acting, and a very interesting story; but the timeless exploration of the human condition revealed by our obsession and compulsions once the noble purpose of the sight for the blind becomes the navel-gazing stuff of dream addiction. This is truly a great film worth the effort required to find a copy and the time it takes to experience.",1515974400,,711,4.5625

7826218,5,6302453267,"Fascinating, especially part 3.  Without any spoilers, the one of the protagonists' father has invented a machine that helps the blind see.  It records the brain waves of a seeing person looking at something (say a relative the blind person hasn't seen for a long time).  Then the blind person plays it back and ""sees"" the image (I don't remember whether the sound.  I guarantee you will *not* predict the unexpected outcome(s), despite how predictable they appear after you see them.  (And giving any hint about that outcome *would* be a spoiler.)

The 7 hour director's cut (and presumably the 5 hour one) aren't any more interesting, but they have finally been released and you'll want to see them if you're a fan of the movie.

They both travel around; Google could probably help you find one of the occasional showings.",1485561600,,824,4.801418439716312
