8439357,5,B004RV0CL0,This is basically a korean version of 3 Men & a Baby. However I find this more entertaining to watch than that. Just watching this makes me feel alot better at the end of the day. The cast is a perfect blend of funny & dramatic. The plot is well thought out & the english translation is perfect. This in my case is a must have.,1381449600,,327,3.9696969696969697
8439358,5,B004RV0CL0,This Korean tv show was wonderful. A man tricks his best friends into donating sperm for him. He then mixes all three sperm samples together and then uses it to get his wife with child. The husband then dies leaving a video that tells what he did. The three friends found the video and had to tell his wife what he did. The rest of the show is about the three dads raise the child.,1352592000,,381,4.093333333333334
