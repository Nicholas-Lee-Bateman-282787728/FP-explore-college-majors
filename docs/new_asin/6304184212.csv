7864082,4,6304184212,"I was expecting this video to be a condensation of the Sanctuary manga, but it's tough trying to compress 9 volumes into 60 minutes.  Basically this anime covers the first part of the manga, I forget how far.  The uncanny thing is that it almost follows the manga shot for shot.
The story itself is unchanged form the manga, mainly because both are published by the same publisher, however the atmosphere is not as dark as the manga leads you to believe.  I also found that, that the flow of the dialogue was fragmented in such as way that it was almost like bad acting had these been real actors.
Despite all this, I gave this a high score because the story is good, good art, and a good introduction to the story.  It may even spur people who have not read the manga to go and read it.",980121600,2,787,4.261744966442953
7864083,4,6304184212,"The story of two life-long friends who make a vow to always aid each other in their paths to power.  One chooses the Diet, (Japanese Parliament) the other chooses the Yakuza.  As the two maneuver their way up their respective ladders, they find their paths aren't that different after all, as both take on a world where the young are kept powerless by their elders. An extreme departure from the usual children's fare we've come to expect from Takahashi Rumiko (""Ranma 1/2,"" ""Maison Ikkoku,"" ""Those Obnoxious Aliens""), I enjoyed Sanctuary a great deal.  Those looking for sex and/or violence WILL get it, but not in the John Woo or Quentin Tarantino vein.  Rather, this film evokes more of a Coppola feel, with it's subtle turns and quality, not quantity style.  If Mario Puzo was Japanese, he'd have written this story.",970531200,3,820,4.828571428571428
