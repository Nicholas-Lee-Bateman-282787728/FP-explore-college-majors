2168404,5,B00064WBDY,This is Eddie young wild & crazy. I love the VHS version because in the DVD thing where cut out that is classic 80's stuff and I couldn't take that so I got the VHS.,1216857600,,165,3.742857142857143
2168405,5,B00064WBDY,"There is a DVD out of his best stuff from SNL, but it doesn't have it all - and this video does! If you want Eddie doing Richard Simmons, White Like Me, Toof Fairy and a whole lot more - get this video - the DVD doesn't have any of it!",1213401600,2,235,3.627450980392157

2168409,5,B00064WBDY,"Unfortunately, the DVD version pales in comparison to this original unrated version. Lorne Michaels took out so much great skits from the original compilation.",1388016000,,159,5.666666666666667
2168410,5,B00064WBDY,"In fact, this is the second review I've written for this tape.  Amazon rejected my first one, and I didn't use any naughty words.  I simply described, accurately, some of the skits that Eddie Murphy performed in this comedic tour de force.  Let's see if my second attempt succeeds.  By the way, don't bother with any of the dvd versions, as this one is far superior.

You'll get to see Eddie Murphy with a reggae band, in front of an all white audience, sing a song called ""K-ll the Wh-te People.""  You'll see him imitating Jessie Jackson, singing a song called ""Don't Let Me Down, H-mietown.""  You'll see him in a skit called ""Cotton Land,"" along with Stevie Wonder, brilliantly mocking liberal wh-te folks' demeaning patronizing of bl-cks.  You'll see him playing James Brown, who is in turn playing Little Orphan Annie on broad way.  You will see all these things, and much more.  If you were offended by the Chappelle Show, chances are good you'll be offended by this tape.  So, of course, I gleefully recommend it.",1380499200,2,1019,4.668539325842697
2168411,5,B00064WBDY,"Eddie murphy in his heyday was extremely funny. James brown hot tub, merry christmas dammit, white like me, mr robinson's neighborhood omg",1368576000,,138,5.318181818181818
2168412,5,B00064WBDY,The best of Eddie Murphy will have you laughing out loud!  This is a true classic by the one and only Mr. Eddie Murphy.  I love all the skits from the good old days of Saturday Night Live especially Buckwheat!,1363478400,,209,4.2
2168413,5,B00064WBDY,"I love this, watched it many times.........but my VCR was history years ago, so out went all my old VHS tapes. I just don't understand how hard would it be to make this available on DVD. Boo.",1302566400,2,191,4.1891891891891895
2168414,5,B00064WBDY,"Eddie Murphy's recent movies (apart from his Oscar-nominated turn in ""Dreamgirls"") almost make you forget the comic brilliance of his ""Saturday Night Live"" period. Regrettably out of print, this compilation includes many of Murphy's funniest sketches from the 1981-84 seasons. Buckwheat, Velvet Jones, Mr. Robinson and Little Richard Simmons are back in all their glory  not to mention Eddie's on-target impersonations of Bill Cosby, Stevie Wonder and Jesse Jackson. The ""James Brown Celebrity Hot Tub"" skit is priceless, but there's no Gumby, dammit! Still, the Paramount video remains far superior to the botched DVD version.",1235001600,8,627,5.6
2168415,5,B00064WBDY,"Eddie is soooo funny as Buckwheat, James Brown as Annie, etc. I owned it on VHS when it was first released back in the day, this tape is just ""Old School"" funny. D1027 MI.",1232668800,4,171,4.0588235294117645

8038652,5,B00064WBDY,"I purchased this VHS tape years ago (not from Amazon). It's absolutely hilarious. The only thing missing from this version is Eddie Murphy as Gumby, which you will find on one of he DVD versions, but not here.",1466553600,,209,4.526315789473684
8038653,5,B00064WBDY,"Awesome!! I Had This And Lost It In The Process of Relocating Years Ago,And Have Been On The Hunt Since Then.! It's Pure Hilarity,Worth The Wait, It Arrived On Delivery Date And In Perfect Condition!!",1461369600,,200,4.742857142857143
