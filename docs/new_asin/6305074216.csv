958968,4,6305074216,"To start off, I am not a Steven King fan. I very rarely like any of his movies, and I to date have not read any of his books. But this movie really knocked my socks off. Needfull Things is one of those guilty pleasures in  life, a strictly fun movie. I thoroughly recoment this to anyone just  looking for a fun movie. But, alas, it is pan-and-scan. If you can look  past this horrible mistake, especially for DVD, or just don't care, give it  a spin. You won't regret it.",917136000,,472,4.153846153846154

Really the only reason anyone would want to to get this is if you were in my position: You don't own it but you like the movie and want it on bluray.  The only special feature is the original trailer.

As far as the movie itself.  It's not for everyone, even if (especially if) you have read the book.  The script writers took some liberties, and I can't be mad at them for it.  I have read enough King to know that it is almost impossible to make a movie that will stand up to the book.  SO, if you watch it as an individual work of fiction (detaching it from the book) it is a fun stupid movie for afternoons with nothing better to do. I't not mind blowing, but it's something fun to turn your brain off to for a couple hours.",1490572800,,872,4.023255813953488

959306,4,6305074216,"When a mysterious man comes to this small new England town and open up a shop called ""Needful Things"" The townsfolk eat the place up but can't afford much at all and so the owner Max Von Sydow has them play ""pranks"" on each other and these pranks escalate to all kinds of damage and bad feelings. These bad feelings were always there, though, I believe. Ed Harris is the town Sheriff and Bonnie Bedelia is his gal. The rest of the cast are all very familiar faces and this becomes a very entertaining movie as time goes on. My one real problem but I think you always need this type of character is Danforth ""Buster"" Keaton. Loud dad a bully and you really want to punch him out something fierce.

959440,2,6305074216,"They should have let King write this one.  The story lacks essential plot elements and characters that make the novel so chilling -- Ace Merill, the suicide of Brian Rusk as witnessed by his younger brother Sean, the Catholic/Baptist war about Casino Night, the way Gaunt moves from selling needful things to selling arms.  The ending is so stupidly melodramatic that all of the chilling evil King built into the novel trickles away like water draining from puddles after a storm.  The original King plot bears a lot in common with ""Storm of the Century"" in terms of an evil that comes to a small town.  The original King story has some weight and authority. This filmed version really doesn't.  Were it not for strong performances from Ed Harris, Max Von Sydow, and Bonnie Bedelia, the entire movie would be a complete waste of time.",1479859200,3,834,4.724137931034483

959588,4,6305074216,"Once again Steven King causes us to think about the reality of evil, and the hate and loathing the evil one has for each human.  In the story titled, 'Needful Things'  it suggests than humans are needful, and we foolishly seek valueless possessions and so endanger our eternal souls.  Leland Gaunt's little black book will be used on the day we die, to argue why we each should spend eternity in the unrelenting agonies of hell with the demons who despise us and have always sought our destruction.  I love the demon telling each of his victim's, "" No one will ever suspect you did anything "", as if any sin ever goes unpunished, or gets blamed on the wrong soul.  Jesus told us that the Ruler of This World is the father of all lies, and Mr. King gets that more forcefully than most people.  Leland Gaunt destroys, souls, the town, and even the churches with nothing more than the covetous nature of people, and the lies he spews. Evil is, of course, far more invisible, and subtle in reality, it is all around us and prepared to engulf us at every moment.  Only God stands in the way, for even evil can only act when given license by each of us through the free will God gave us, and then God stands back, though HE would prefer to shield us from our vile choices. It is this cooperation with the evil that seeks our eternal destruction, which makes Needful Things truly frightening, because we each have already been seduced by evil, to gain the rubbish of this vile and depraved world.  In making us look at ourselves, Needful Things is a story that many a preacher and priest would do well to show to their congregations with a follow up of how it is a tale no man or woman hasn't experienced first hand, with a less obvious demon than Leland Gaunt, played wonderfully by the very talented Max Von Sydow.",1469318400,,1809,4.411411411411412

959590,5,6305074216,"The story is as old as time itself. What happens when Satan comes to town? The town of Castlerock Maine and sheriff Alan Pangborn learn the hard way. The Devil, Leland Gaunt, opens up a curio shop called ""Needful Things"". When customers come to buy what they 'need' they become part of Satan's spell. They begin to HATE each other. The peaceful town turns into a massacre of death in a matter of time as the townspeople begin listening to the lies of Satan. The people begin destroying themselves. (This theme is very familiar to a Twilight Zone episode 'The Monsters are Due on Maple Street'.) One thing to learn from the film is that Satan cannot make you do anything. It is always your choice but He lies in order to get you to do what seems to be the right thing. I understand that this movie does have a longer extended edition. As I watched this for the first time I thought myself that it needs to be a miniseries. There is plenty of plot to develop. I now would also like to see an extended edition. The ending was a little disappointing...not that Satan was finally driven away but just HOW it happened. It would have been much better to me if the townspeople began to fall on their knees in prayer rather than just a pep talk by the Sheriff. But, hey, it was a good story for me to remind me that this kind of thing really does happen every day because so many of us do exactly what Satan wants us to do (including myself). But it is constant prayer that He has no power over. I really enjoyed the story on this level. I hope that it does the same for anyone who watches it.",1466812800,2,1584,4.248344370860927

959657,5,6305074216,"Great for what it is though it's missing a great deal of the context that really makes the characters work.
Author Stephen King goes to great trouble to illustrate to us how these characters can be manipulated to do what is expected of them (trying not to spoiler, here), and how they cling to what they get for it. The film seemed more focused on the smash-em-up outcome at the end, which is really such a small part of the story. It misses King's point:
Gaunt is not creepy because he looks creepy: Gaunt is creepy because of what he knows about the human condition. Gaunt and the subject(s) of his interest is the 'thing'. This interplay is set up with a complexity in King's writing that the film could not match.

The shallow context of the film is its negative. The positive is that casting is STELLAR. I read the book a few times... once for myself and many times for friends in hospital. These actors are the perfect fit and the casting director should be recognized for some great work, here. Production value is median to good: it has its moments but good enough. Cinematography is excellent, directing is fair (seems like the actors have to do some of the lifting, here). Overall a good film... again: for what it is. It does tell part of the story, after all.
But I'm sure others have told you that if you haven't already, you should read the book. Enjoy the film then get the better version on paper.",1463011200,6,1413,4.455598455598456

959753,4,6305074216,"From the mind of Stephen King comes this harrowing and devastating film with a life lesson to give us. Do you remember the last clue sentence pronounced by Al Pacino in The Devil's advocate (1997) ? : Vanity is my favorite sin, he says.

Well this sentence fits perfectly in this motion picture. When Leeland Gaunt comes in to this quiet town Castle Rock and settles with a agllery called ""Needful things"", he will just push forward the dark side of the human soul through these little wishes out of the past or unsaid details that feed our greed. Well this film is about. When Leeland triggers his Pandora's boxes, all this quiet town will become a helish mess.

The rest runs for you. Watch it because Max Von Sydow is in the top of the game as The Devil in question. Wonderful directorial debut from Charles Heston's son . Fraser Heston.

Ed Harris powerful character, plus J.T.Walsh and the alluring beauty of Bonnie Bedelia and a series of magnificent special effects make a well- rounded film.",1451520000,,999,4.632768361581921

959807,1,6305074216,"Extremely poor rendition of the original Stephen King story.  The number of changes to the original story, both large and small, would take pages and pages to document, and many of them were done for no apparent sensible reason.  (ex.  Bryan Rusk breaking the windows in the house with apples instead of rocks.  They couldn't find any rocks for the movie?)  Many of the changes were very major, including the location of the store itself, Polly's amulet and what happened with it,  no mention of Bryan Rusk's little brother and his role in the story, etc. on down to the ending, which was in no way similar to the original story.  The characters in the Stephen King novel were very well developed, unlike in the movie, where virtually every single one is a disappointment.  Sheriff Pangborn, who comes across in the story as being a very nice man, is almost cold and a bit unlikeable in the movie, and his loving relationship with Polly is barely touched on.  I watched the movie just a couple of days after finishing the novel, and I was a bit horrified, but for the wrong reasons.  It was as though, from the very beginning of the movie, someone had intentionally tried to destroy the storyline, and the story itself was condensed and rushed along in some sort of mad race, throwing in as many changes as possible along the way.  I can't imagine Stephen King being happy with the final product in any way.  My excitement in looking forward to viewing the movie turned to sad disappointment within just a couple minutes of the beginning and it was downhill from there.",1447891200,2,1569,4.624548736462094

959896,1,6305074216,"Love the movie, loved the DVD and HATE the KL Blu-ray: Needful Things was shot by Tony Westman, who would team again with director Fraser on the feature film Alaska. Kino's 1080p, AVC-encoded Blu-ray has been made from a well-preserved source, probably an IP, that is relatively clean, with only minor scratches, dust and other occasional blemishes. The colors, especially in the ""vision"" inserts, are strong.

However, there a number of issues, some of them serious. Black levels are inconsistent, with blacks sometimes slipping into dark gray, and overbrightening is frequently evident, which is especially a problem in a film with many shots where haze, smoke and/or fog are used to supply atmosphere. The image has been heavily filtered, resulting in a loss of fine detail. Even worse, the image is often flat and at times has the slightly ""smeared"" appearance that is the byproduct of aggressive grain reduction; the effect may not be obvious on screens under 50"", but it becomes more pronounced as screen size increases. Moreover, the film's grain pattern is virtually invisible for large stretches of the running time.

Even with the grain reduced, the image suffers from noticeable compression artifacts, no doubt as a result of Kino's decision to release a 121-minute film on a BD-25, resulting in an average bitrate of 20.94 Mbps. With a 1.85:1 film containing this much activity and complex imagery, that is simply insufficient, and shifting backgrounds can be readily observed in the quietest scenes, which the compressionist probably starved for bandwidth in order to preserve as much as possible for the action highlights. The effect is similar to what used to be called ""posterization.",1434931200,6,1700,5.178181818181818

960295,4,6305074216,"My personal rating is 3 1/2 stars but I'll grant it a 4 since it's more that than a 3. This 1993 adaptation of Stephen King's book was originally 3 hours long when it first appeared on cable television (for which it was made) and then was edited into this 2 hour theatrical version. It works well enough but you can tell that there are parts missing especially at the end when the townspeople confess to things we haven't seen. No matter. Although all the performances are fine notably Amanda Plummer's and J.T. Walsh's, the movie belongs to Max von Sydow as the Devil which it should. He gets the best lines and the best make-up and seems to be enjoying himself immensely. Director Fraser Heston (Charlton's son) does a workmanlike job in presenting the movie and I mean that in the best possible sense of the word. Well made with story and character first but when effects are needed they do not disappoint. I don't know who's responsible (writer or director) but THINGS noticeably draws on 4 other movies; FROM BEYOND THE GRAVE (1974), SOMETHING WICKED THIS WAY COMES (1983), THE DEVIL & DANIEL WEBSTER (1941) and the TV adaptation of Stephen King's own SALEM'S LOT (1979) which only adds to the fun if you know those films.

Castle Rock is a sleepy little New England town about to be turned upside down by a series of sinister events. Sound familiar? An antique black Mercedes drives into town and soon a new curiosity shop called ""Needful Things"" opens up. The townspeople who visit it soon discover items that are their heart's desire. They are ridiculously cheap. All the proprietor Leland Gaunt (von Sydow) asks in return, aside from a pittance, is that the person in question do him a favor. This favor involves doing something to another townsperson without their knowing it so that they'll blame somebody else. The local sheriff (Ed Harris) tries to keep the peace while everything starts to go wrong around him. Little things balloon into big things and then erupt into brutal violence. Once he figures things out, can the sheriff stop the vicious retaliations? All the while Gaunt relaxes to the strains of Schubert's AVE MARIA while sipping brandy and smoking cigars. When he looks over his little black book of souls, he has quite a devilish look to his face and hands. There is some choice dialogue including von Sydow's last line. There's also some excessive violence but it's the characters and their deeds that will stick in your memory. I would love to see the full version someday.",1389052800,,2503,4.727688787185355

Like most reader's of countless other books, I unrealistically expected a film adaptation to ""wow"" me to the same degree as the book did. Unfortunately that was not the case.  This movie has three major obstacles which prevent it from fully immersing the audience.
1. The simple fact that the movie was filmed decades ago poses limitations on the amount of gore and unabashed flare that was societal norms allowed in a theater had this film recently been filmed i feel more of.the essence of the story could have developed through the use of shock value.
2. The length of the movie was surprisingly short, character development and suspense did not properly reach a climax. Rather it prematurely spilled the plot and effectively spoiled the essence of the original version of this story.
3. The quality of the picture was not what I expected, for obvious reasons this movie was not shot in HD. Unfortunately, i have grown accustomed to high resolution and this movie seemed to have a highly grainy cast over the entire length of film.

Obsessive and overly analyzed bs aside , the movie was a good watch, and i was glad Amazon had this movie on file. I doubt i could find this movie at my local redbox.",1365897600,3,1277,4.696428571428571

960678,4,6305074216,"Castle Rock, Maine has a new store in town and once business starts it booms.  It has something for everyone, from young to old.  The prices are really low and fair and shoppers just seem to always leave happy.  The store's proprietor Leland Gaunt ( Max Von Sydow) seems like such a nice man and all he asks for when he sells his goods is a fair price and a little favor.  The buyer has to pull a prank on one of the town's other residents.

Sheriff Alan Pangborn (Ed Harris) doesn't like Gaunt.  The sheriff also has his hands full of problems trying to settle the town down with all of the violence and hatred that has erupted. Gaunt just seems to know what to ask for to stir up the most trouble and vicious behavior.  He knows that people will pay almost anything to get their wishes, dreams and desires.  Ultimately many towns' people sell their souls for Gaunt's goods and it is up to Pangborn to try to save their souls and the town itself.....

This is an excellent book but only a good movie.  Stephen King understands what it takes to get people at each other's throats with vengeance in their eyes.  In this story he creates a demon in the guise of an old gentleman who collects souls.  Only the sheriff with his bravery can save what is left of the town.  I loved this story and it is much better as a book than the movie that was later released.  The movie failed to follow the book and is different in the end and it detracted from the story line in my opinion.  The movie softened some of the demonic aspects of Gaunt and as a result, to me, took some of the terror out of the story.  The supernatural aspect of the movie was what made it creepy for me.  The acting in the movie was good and it had a strong and talented cast of actors.

I recommend that you read the book and watch the DVD and judge for yourself.  If you are a Stephen King fan, like I am you, will find yourself liking the movie and enjoying both forms of entertainment to varying degrees.  I recommend this movie to you as a good story but do yourself a favor and also read the book!",1344902400,,2068,4.187341772151899
960679,4,6305074216,"I saw this movie when it was first released in '93 and again recently and I liked it both times. Like all Stephen King films based on his books, ""Needful Things"" takes place in a small town and has a cartooney air.

What would happen if the devil literally came to town? In this case it's a small New England coastal village (shot in British Columbia). Ed Harris plays the main protagonist while Bonnie Bedelia plays his girlfriend, and Max Von Sydow plays the mysterious shopkeeper who comes to down and causes havoc by selling the villagers their most deepest desires for the price of a ""deed.""

So, what would happen if the devil came to town? Would he make it a paradise? A fun hedonistic haven? Not bloody likely.

Since the movie utilizes Christian themes I'll consider it from that perspective for the sake of reviewing. According to the Bible, the blessing of the Lord produces the qualities of the Garden of Eden, that is, paradise, which is why it says that the kindgom of heaven is a matter of righteousness, peace, joy and power. By contrast, the devil's kingdom produces un-righteousness, strife, war, anxiety, depression, misery, bondage and helplessness.

The fictitional town of Castle Rock was a veritable haven before Leland Gaunt (Sydow) came to town. Sure, there were the typical petty dislikes and rivalries, etc. but, generally speaking, it was a nice place to live, a small coastal paradise, which is what motivated the Ed Harris character to live there. Of course, Gaunt is intent on changing all this.

I just find it interesting the way the new shopkeeper slowly turns the town into a literal living hell. He utilizes the people's petty dislikes, paranoias and jealousies against them.

""Needful Things"" may not be great and it's definitely not scary, but it's effective in a theological sense as a creepy Satanic take-over through simple manipulation of human nature.",1340841600,4,1894,4.8847352024922115
960680,4,6305074216,"I first read Needful Things about 20 years ago, not long after it was published. One thing I like about Stephen King's stories is how familiar the worlds seem. Then he changes one or two small details and introduces a supernatural element. We still relate to the story because we identify so strongly with the setting he establishes. Like many of King's books, Needful Things is set in the fictional town of Castle Rock, Maine.

The movie is not an entirely faithful adaptation of the book, but that's partly due to the length of the original story. A few details are changed to help the story along and other elements are completely omitted. The remaining story still works well as a movie, but it could have been even better.

What would you do if The Devil lived in your town?

Leland Gaunt (von Sydow) opens a store in Castle Rock. Needful Things sells all manner of antiques and collectibles and Gaunt initially appears to be a friendly old man. His first customer is a young boy, Brian Rusk, who has a large collection of Topps baseball cards. After Gaunt asks him to wish for any item he can imagine, Brian thinks of a 1956 Mickey Mantle Topps card. When Brian closes his eyes and touches the card, he can see Mantle playing in a game from decades ago. The card is worth hundreds of dollars, but Gaunt asks for just 95c. The other part of the price is a deed.

The deeds are tricks played on other people. Brian is told to throw turkey droppings at freshly-washed sheets hanging on a neighbor's washing line. He barely knows the woman and so there's almost no chance she will find out that it was him. Gaunt uses this tactic with everyone who enters the store. He somehow has an item that each covets, whether it's sunglasses worn by Elvis Presley, a first edition of Treasure Island signed by the author, or a toy horse-racing game that accurately predicts winners of upcoming races. People are willing to perform tricks to acquire items they desperately want.

Most people don't have a clue what is going on, but Sheriff Alan Pangborn (Harris) sees what Gaunt is doing. The tricks start to become more cruel and dangerous, and some ultimately become fatal. Gaunt apparently travels from one town to the next and feeds off the evil and negative energy.

The biggest flaw in the movie adaptation is a speech designed to give the story a typical Hollywood climax. It seems out of place and unrealistic, but I understand why it was added. That aside, it's one of the best King adaptations. The acting is strong for the most part, with good performances from Amanda Plummer, Bonnie Bedelia and J. T. Walsh supporting the excellent work of Harris and von Sydow.

It's fascinating watching how a few evil deeds can impact a friendly small town. The story is simple, but it seems so plausible.

960724,1,6305074216,"Stephen King's Needful Things, is truly one of the finest, and most memorable books that I have ever read. One of his very best. He proves himself over and over again, with his amazing abilities, by giving birth to this chilling, and very detail laced saga, of a small town in Maine, whose inhabitants are wily and unknowingly coerced, to do seemingly petty and harmless acts of low level mischief to one another, in order to gain access to certain items for sale at the new store, that has just opened up in town, (Needful Things). But as the story continues, the envied baseball card, or the picture of Elvis, etc, seems to take on a more and more obsessive consuming of the owners lives, as everything else's importance seems to just fade away, as if one were a worthless street bum, infatuated with a brand new bottle their favorite poison. The seemingly insignificant deeds, done at the shop owner's requests, bring on a much more foul and bloody result from their doings, than anyone would ever dream or imagine. Soon the whole town is in disarray, as once best of friends, or neighbors with small grievances with another, are now at each other's throats, and behind it all, is a plot that will take castle Rock off any map that they may have ever found themselves on, in the first place. This should have been made into a top quality 5 part TV mini-series. Instead, it was butchered in the movie house, like a fine filet mignon, that was tossed on a BBQ in the middle of a grease fire, caused by last night's burger party, and pushed onto a plate, a la carte, covered with a nasty ketchup sauce of violence and explosions, never giving a chance to the viewer to savor the subtleties of the ""tenderness and juiciness"" from the build up of the characters, and their intertwinings with each other, before the whole town starts to go to pot! I was left feeling raped of my cash, both from the movie, and the 1000% mark up on the popcorn, as I departed the theater, wanting to go  home and pen a nasty letter to the person who did the screen adaptation work, and the director, for doing more heinous violence to this great book, on film, that all the bloody goings on in the movie itself.

His other movies `Storm of the Century' and `The Stand' are great too,as are most of his movies, but this one stands out to me. Max VonSydow does a very nice job as Leland Gaunt, because he read the book before doing the role. You can hate his charecter, but not his performance, much like Al Pacino in Devil's Advocate.

The film by far does not go into the depth of the intricate web that Leland Gaunt has spun around the town with his tricks but you definitely get the idea and many of the actors certainly do a wonderful job at portraying the after effects. The scene with the two women fighting from room to room while 'Ave Maria' gently plays in the background has to be one of the most brilliant and unforgettable scenes in a movie i have ever seen.
That and other very well done parts of this movie, a wonderful score by Patrick Doyle and not to mention Max von Sydow's brilliant portrayal of the devil make this one of the few movies I like to watch at least once a year!

Where this version fails is that the character development is rushed and they focus more on the ""deeds"" than what the book does.  The novel itself is very excellent and the first part allows the characters to be developed.  Part two of the novel is left to the ""deeds"" and part three focuses on the chaos that results and the aftermath.

However, in the movie, the ""deeds"" and the chaos and not on the characters nor the aftermath.  I think that ""Needful Things"" could be put on film, as long as it's a three part miniseries and not just one movie.

However, this film does have some good things about it, the main good thing is Max von Syndow's performance (although when I read the book I imagined someone like Christopher  Lee).  Another good thing is how accurate to the book that the ""deeds"" were carried out.

Max Von Sydow barely managed to save this mess from being a complete disaster. It's an extremely watered down retelling of a great story about a man/demon named ""Leland Gaunt"" (Sydow) who opens up a new store in the town of Castle Rock, Maine. He calls the store ""Needful Things"" and In it he sells you things that grant you your wildest dreams, but of course there is a shocking and terrible price to be paid for such items.

The script is so haphazardly thrown together, tamed down, and rushed that it will probably seem incomplete even to those people who haven't read the book. The movie doesn't go into nearly enough detail in regard to the extent to which Gaunt goes to pit the towns citizens against each other. Several characters are combined or just plain left out. Biographical facts about certain people are changed, or omitted. Sheriff Alan Pangborn (Ed Harris), for example is a widower in the book. In the movie, however, it is suggested that he is just a bachelor. His lover, Polly Chalmers's (Bonnie Bedelia)  true reasons for leaving, and then moving back to Castle Rock aren't even hinted at.  The book actually takes time to build up to it's explosive climax. The events in the novel happen over the course of a month, whereas everything in the film takes place in less then a week. Give me a break, will ya?

Overall this was a big disappointment for me. The only real redeeming quality of the whole miserable mess was Max Von Sydow. He was perfectly cast as the demonic store proprietor. I think this would have made a better HBO miniseries to tell you the truth. There's only so much from a 700+ page book that you can squeeze into an hour and 45 minutes.  Not that they couldn't have simply made the film longer or anything.  I guess making people sit in the movie theater for more than two hours would be tantamount to asking people to get off their lazy asses and pay attention to something for a change.

While in the book, King destroys the dreamy little town, it just gets blown about a bit in the movie version.  As usual, they couldn't get all the good stuff in the film version (noticeably absent is the woman who has a thing for Elvis carried to a fatal climax), but writer W. D. Richter captures the essence of the book and with von Sydow's tongue in cheek performance helming the film, I enjoyed it.  Ed Harris seemed a little out of place, an actor who felt he needed to bust out of the constraints of the character and become Jack Nicholson; Bonnie Bedelia was rendered pretty ineffective in trimming down Polly's role; Amanda Plummer and Valeri Brumfield as Nettie and Wanda were viciously effective, and JT Walsh did a nice over the top job in his role as the gambling fool.

Yep, that's right ... von Sydow is Satan, and his customers pay for ""needful things"" with their souls.

Lots of stuff gets blown to bits, by which time this movie has long since worn out its welcome. Harris and von Sydow do their best to liven up the dreary scenario, but this is strictly for die-hard King fans, and even then the recommendation is marginal. Not one I'd recommend. It's bad, real bad, but funny. A good laugh is all that this provides, but then again most King adaptations usually end up bad.

The movie itself is... just okay. Max Von Sydow turns in a good performance as Leland Gaunt, the chilling shopkeeper who is more than he appears, Ed Harris is pretty much always good and makes for a good cop caught up in circumstances beyond his control. For about the first two-third of the movie, in fact, the story follows the book in a quite satisfying fashion.
For about the first two-thirds.
Hollywood seems so intent on changing the endings of Stephen King's books when they make them into movies, and I have yet to see an improvement. I am in the minority of people who hates Stanley Kubrick's version of ""The Shining"" because of how he takes a story about redemption and makes it bleak and hopeless. I have almost the opposite complaint here -- the filmmakers took an ending that was satisfyingly dark and made it uncharacteristically upbeat and chipper. It just didn't work.
The movie is mildly entertaining, worth a rental if you're a King fan, certainly worth catching on cable -- but as for the DVD, I can't recommend it.",1035504000,6,1302,4.54468085106383
960865,2,6305074216,"The movie was quit different from the book, but with that aside the movie still wasn't that good.  The movie had a certain childish quality towards it.  I also found it a bit slow especially the first half.  The way people acted and thought were sometime unrealistic. Although this movie was made in 1990 or so, maybe it might have been more popular back then.  I was dissapointed in it.  Unfotuantely a lot of King's movies are far different from the book and a lot of the good stuff is missed.  The only one that goes against this that I know of so far is the Green Mile.  But if you're bored one day you might as well rent it if you can't find anything else, it is entertaining to an extent.",1027987200,3,694,4.212121212121212
960866,3,6305074216,"A gleefully macabre movie that dances quickly through its devilish plotting like a reveller upon a tombstone. The Devil is once again given the wryly omnipotent treatment, this time by Max Von Sydow, and the Stephen King characterization does shine through in some of the homespun acting. The script does allow the viewer in on the naughty relishing of, say, winding up and letting fly with apples through a local's window, or hacking apart someone who harmed your dog. The Devil can make you do it.",1013126400,,499,4.813953488372093
960867,1,6305074216,"The screenplay is a far cry from the original novel.  First of all, many of the book's main characters are completely missing.  Where's Ace Merrill?  Replaced by a one minute extra character (the Treasure Island book guy.)  The book is also much more suspensful and has a lot more dark humor buried in it.  I didn't expect the film to be as elaborate as the book but this film just simply is a poor cinematic work all around in addition.  Cheap.  Incomplete.  Bad effort.  Read the book and watch something more worthwhile.",1003017600,4,523,4.5978260869565215
960868,5,6305074216,"There are already plenty of reviews, so rather than bore the reader with my interpretation of the entire film, I wanted to focus on a portion. Stephen King is Stephen King and he has kept me up many a long night for my entire adult life. The formula of these stories works well (although I much prefer the Dolores Claiborne stuff as I age along with King), but the fight scene between Nettie and Wilma in ""Needful Things"" reigns supreme in the annals of cinematic cat fights. This is no grappling match between two well endowed bathing beauties wrasslin' around in the mud. Two middle aged Yankee broads, each holding a misplaced grudge due to a shopping spree at the local antique and ""thrift"" shop, engage in a second story battle royale using every household weapon they can grab and culminating with a spectacular airborne climax. I never miss this film when it's on, due to the wry and sadistically bawdy screenplay and this particular stunt sequence. The flick gets a four, the fight goes the distance.",998006400,,1008,4.700564971751413

Just one problem:The owner is actually the devil,and he only trades in souls. He turns the locals against each other,setting off a chain reaction of murder and mayhem that culminates in an explosive final between evil and the law. Viciously tongue in cheek. Rated R for strong violence and adult language.",996192000,,428,4.958333333333333
960920,2,6305074216,"Eventhough others have liked this movie, I have found it to be quite boring. The acting was okay, but the film itself was just displeasing to me.
I thought it at least deserved two stars, because the movie kept me wondering what was going to happen next. It was a good thing I got this video at the library for free, other than paying $2.29 at my local video store.
Max Von Sydow's role as Lucifer was weird. That's another reason I gave this movie two stars. I never thought that a man more powerful than the President would have listened to the people and leave their town. You would've at least figured he'd turn out to be some horrifying creature. But I guess when Stephen King wrote the book he wanted to add some realism to it.
If you're going to rent this movie, it should be on a two-for-one night. Just so you know you haven't wasted your money.",994636800,,854,4.3105590062111805
960921,1,6305074216,"The original Needful Things was an hour longer than it appears on this DVD.  Also, there is no widescreen version that is produced.  This is probably the best adaptation of a Stephen King book ever brought to film, but it has not yet been deemed profitable enough to put any effort into the produciton of the DVD.  The movie itself is superb (for its genre), 3 and 1/2 stars easy.  However, this is one of the most shoddily made DVDs that I have ever seen.

The story about satan (Max Von Sydow) who opens a  store in a small town (CAstle rock) and started to create war among the  town people. Too bad this movie has not been given good treatment on DVD.  The picture is a little bit dark and not in widescreen. The sound is also a  bit soft and no 5.1 audio. I wish a long version will appear on DVD soon.  But if you can find a copy of this DVD, grab it. I like the movie enough to  buy despite the shortcomings of the technical quality.",967161600,4,652,4.134920634920635
960924,4,6305074216,"In the first month of 2000. I saw the Director`s Cut of the film adding one hour of additonal footage, it had one character, we saw her in the 120 mins version needful things, but only briefly as Brain Rusk Mother played  by Lisa Blount as Cora Rusk. Inculding a different opening, a car chased  scene with Ed Harris and Max Von Sydow. For sure they cut a few gory scenes  but is worth it waiting for a Widescreen Director`s Cut on DVD, also i  wish, they add Audio Commentary, that will be great for a Stephen King Fan.  Who Knows, they show it on television. I seen it on TBS SuperStation. That  Version earn 4 Stars Or maybe  Five Stars, if i seen it again.",952041600,15,660,4.190476190476191
