773746,2,630401838X,"Attorney Elaine Taylor (Jennifer Grey), early in her career, is chosen by circumstance to represent a presumptive serial slayer, George Kendall (Costas Mandylor), a well-known photographer of prostitutes, some of whom happen to be the murder victims, whereupon Elaine becomes attracted by her client's possible innocence (as well as by his maleness), complicating affairs for all concerned since evidence to be exhibited by the local district attorney's office is purportedly enough to indict Kendall. The film is hampered by a confusing screenplay that confounds a fairly routine storyline, resulting in scenes being disunited and lacking in suspense, but Grey is always interesting to watch and performs creditably here, as does Currie Graham as procurer for the slain ladies of the evening, while cinematographer Curtis Petersen adds interest to the undertaking despite the script's flaws of continuity.",1102896000,,906,5.669117647058823
