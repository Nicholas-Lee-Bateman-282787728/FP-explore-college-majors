8096223,5,B000C7PZM4,"This documentary, made three years after the most lame-ass attempt to film an ultra-low budget feature film imaginable, is vastly entertaining and instructive. It is a black humor look at more wrong decisions, piled on, one after another, when a novice tried to make a 95 page script in 6 days, without using any self-discipline, common sense or flexibility. The narrator/filmmaker salvages his scraps of footage in the most poorly planned and executed movie possibly ever seen. This is why it is instructive, and the reason why it is entertaining is the filmmaker/narrator's awareness, perhaps more so now than then, and complete honesty in his poor choices in trying to make the original film. He rents the equipment the night before, doesn't know how to use it, is one big lesson.  Then, to try to use his two yahoo drinking buddies as actors is wrong at a glance to anyone, yet he wastes a day on them, and days later, goes back to give them a second chance, wasting more days/time/footage. He even takes a depressed day off to
just drink (drinking and filmmaking go together as well as you'd think).  Where this documentary fails, and it may be something the filmmaker, Chris, still doesn't understand is that with an ultra-low budget film (besides limiting the number of actors and locations!) is that you need to plan out everything carefully -- yet when filming starts, things will go very wrong and you need to be flexible. Yet on one of his days in the middle of his film, the documentary establishes that he knows at this point, he will not get his planned fictional movie made at all, no chance, yet he has an experienced actor, an experienced actress, and a literal day at the beach, all day. What he CLEARLY should have done, once he knew the planned pages being filmed were worthless, no movie to put them in, was to quickly come up with a boy meets girl love story at the beach that day, quickly -- he has to get a whole ad-libbed movie made in one day! -- have boy meet girl, give them some quick characters, conflicts, and race like hell to cobble together a guided improv story, the goal being to have the couple in this instant story either hold hands at sunset and leave together, or sadly say goodbye, whatever, but AT LEAST he'd have some kind of story to try to edit together. But no. He has them film their scenes as he wrote them -- for no purpose at all. No flexibility. He has two giggling twin girls who set each other off giggling, ruining take after take. But does he quickly jettison his concept of twins, and send the one home who never read the script, and get that scene done? No. He lacks all flexibility, which you need for ultra-low budget filmmaking. So his wry look at his mistakes is funny, he feels sorry for  himself about how his fictional movie turned out much more than I do. But this documentary remains an entertaining, cautionary tale for novice filmmakers. John Hill Hillwithit@aol.com  P.S. to this day, my best friend, an indy filmmaker and I, greet each other always by saying ""Ack Ack!"" like the goofballs in his documentary. We don't want to, we have to.",1378425600,,3109,4.586330935251799
8096224,5,B000C7PZM4,"Never have I laughed so hard at a film!! I had tears running down my face and eyes of other theatre-goers on me. It was worth it though. I first saw this film at the Phoenix Film Festival and have been waiting anxiously for it to be released to DVD every since. This movie reminds me of Meet the Parents in a way. This guy, who wanted nothing more than to make a quality film, has the absolute worst luck ever. He is stuck with actors who can't get it together or just don't show up, missing equipment, and a total lack of experience when it comes operating his equipment. His commentary of the events as they unfold is priceless. His dry humor and incredible sarcasm lead you along the journey as his film takes shape, or completely comes apart, depending on how you look at it. I won't spoil the movie for you, but between a dog with a serious humping problem, twins with one hell of a cackle, friends who only want to drink, some seriously flaky actors, and a mom who thinks he is crazy how can you go wrong!  Get ready to laugh so hard you'll need a tissue!",1133395200,8,1061,4.226600985221675
