1853009,5,B00008N705,"Before The Office made uncomfortable humour hip again, Knowing Me Knowing You was on British TV and quickly developed a cult following-enough to spawn several additional series and a one-off special. The show was created by talented comedian Steve Coogan for a BBC Radio 4 comedy show called On the Hour in 1993. This was successful enough to spawn Knowing Me in 1994 as Coogan and co-writer Armando Iannucci skewer British talk shows with its hopelessly inept host, Alan Partridge (Coogan). Like The Office's David Brent, Alan is a legend in his own mind. He's also an arrogant git who is useless at hosting a chat show.

Most people know Steve Coogan from either 24 Hour Party People or Coffee and Cigarettes-or, heaven forbid, Around the World in 80 Days-but his claim to fame in England came from Knowing Me. He is perfect as the selfish, self-absorbed Alan. Unlike David Brent, there is little redeemable about Alan but Coogan does give him a shred of sympathy and maybe even pathos. Coogan looks the part with his shellacked helmet of hair and has all of the chat show host mannerisms down cold. Alan wants desperately to be a big time talk show host but is unable to get any celebrities to come on and is therefore doomed to the margins. He is hopelessly and terminally unhip but doesn't seem to ever realize this fact. In some respects Alan is Rupert Pupkin from The King of Comedy if Scorsese had decided to make a TV show spin-off.

Some of the best moments of Knowing Me come when Alan loses his cool, like when Roger Moore fails to show up and the talk show host unleashes all of his frustrations on his guests after they complain and criticize him. Knowing Me is the kind of talk show we'd all like to see. In this day and age when talk shows are carefully scripted and staged, there is virtually no spontaneity anymore. And so, to see Alan insult and often lose control of his guests and, in the process, his show, is akin to driving by an accident: it is painful to watch but you can't look away.

The first disc features audio commentaries for all six episodes with writer/producer Armando Iannucci, actress Rebecca Front, writer Patrick Marber, actor Steven Brown and a couple of the ""guests"" from that particular episode. These are fairly amusing tracks that spend a lot of time slamming Alan (and rightly so). In fact, every commentary begins with Alan not being able to join the other participants because of some embarrassing ailment.

The second disc begins with ""Festivalan"" a.k.a. Know Me Knowing Yule made two years after the first season. Alan somehow survived the devastating last show of his first season for a Christmas special complete with ski lodge dcor perfect for that faux-intimate feel that eventually degrades into a naked appeal on his part for a second season. Also included is an optional commentary by Iannucci, Marber, Front, Doon MacKichan, David Schneider and Steve Brown. There is lots of dry humour as they make fun of Alan once again.

""Originalan"" features test footage shot for the pilot episode that was never aired and done for little money in order to see if the concept worked. This is the show in its infancy. Alan's hair looks even more artificial (if that's possible) with a glistening plastic sheen.

""Ruralan"" features Alan rambling through the northern English countryside. He skips stones across a pond (and promptly loses his watch) while pontificating endlessly via voiceover.

""Alan Aid"" sees Coogan reprise his character for three segments for the U.K. version of Comic Relief in 1995. As usual, Alan makes a mess of things and is even humiliated in one segment by some locals.

Finally, there is ""Additionalan"" that includes nine promos for the show, a stills gallery and biographical sketches for the cast and crew with one for Alan that is quite funny.",1128470400,30,3819,4.775757575757575
1853010,5,B00008N705,"Partridge is hysterical wherever he appears, and while I agree that KMKY isn't quite up to the hysteria of the later ""I'm Alan Partridge"", it's still superb. From eating the testicles of a bull to accidentally blowing away a guest with an antique pistol, Alan is constantly out of his depth and completely unaware of it. I've loved this programme since it first came out, I just wish Steve Coogan would revisit the character more often rather than appear in crap Disney movies. Alan Partridge is the man you love to hate, and nobody does it better than Steve Coogan. A-HA!",1125532800,18,572,4.673267326732673
1853011,5,B00008N705,"There's no reason why Alan Partridge couldn't have been as popular in the US as ""The Office""...however, BBCAmerica insists on burying the show in late-night, so it remains a cult favorite. This DVD has the talk show ""Knowing Me, Knowing You"" which isn't quite as good as the later sitcom ""I'm Alan Partridge"" but it's still brilliant. Partridge (played by Steve Coogan) is a great character, completely obnoxious, but you can't help but cheer for him as he annoys his guests until they beat him up. This set has the 6 episodes of the show, a Christmas special, and lots of extras, like commentary and extended episodes. If you like modern British comedy like the Office/Little Britain/etc, you should pick this up (even if you haven't seen it due to BBCAmerica's bad scheduling). It's worth paying 20 bucks to see something decent on TV.",1124841600,14,837,4.819444444444445
1853012,5,B00008N705,"The reviewer, whom Virginia Bottomly described as 'that little turd' , has shown his alleged age.  This series is ball-bouncingly funny and so successful in skewering the then-and-now trend for allowing no-talents to host their own shows, and fill them with mindless, untalented guests.  Alan Partridge is the fore runner to characters such as David Brent in 'The Office', and Larry Saunders in 'the Larry Saunders show (Alan Partridge radio 4 show pre-dates LS by several years, fact fans).  This series also sets up what might be the funniest sit-com in British TV - 'I'm Alan Partridge'.  As for Marber and Co. Well they helped write it, and appear in the commentary.

1853019,4,B00008N705,"This is quite possibly one of the best fake talk shows ever produced. Coogan's boorish Alan Partridge is a perfect mix of arrogant and petty, essentially torturing each guest in a new way. As Chapter 1 in the Partridge saga (followed by I'm Alan Partridge, a must see,) it is the perfect beginning to a character that's already become a cult favorite.",1255046400,2,351,4.67741935483871

1853023,5,B00008N705,"Great DVD set. Although I prefer 'I'm Alan Partridge' this is a must have for any Coogan fan. The extras are complete, although the absence of Steve Coogan on the episode commentaries even leaves the other commentators questioning their relevance! The Knowing Me, Knowing Yule Christmas special is even sharper than the original series.",1193788800,4,336,5.2407407407407405
1853024,5,B00008N705,"The original Alan Partridge show is as good as the Travel Tavern series and 13 years later remains as funny as when I first watched it. Never has a chat show host been so rude, humiliated so many people and been humiliated by so many people in the history of television.

If you've only ever seen the two later series, or if you managed to miss Alan Partridge completely you really do need to see this. As previous reviewers have said it has some of the same cringe worthy elements that make The Office so brilliant. Imagine combining the the characters of David Brent and Gareth together (from the original British version) and it'll give you some idea just how dreadful Alan Partridge is. Dreadful he may be but its very very funny. Partridge is mainly self-obsessed and hates being upstaged by his guests, even though in some cases he worships them (Roger Moore for example). Roger Moore of course never appears on the show.

A particular favourite moment of mine is when Alan gives his three guests a chance to complain about the show, which inevitably has been a complete disaster.
Alan: ""If you've got any criticisms I can deal with them""
All three guests then complain vehmently for a minute or so.
Alan: ""UP YOURS"" (sticking a single finger up at his guests)

Subtlety is not Alan's strong point.

This is endlessly watchable, with some very funny extras, which makes the DVD a great purchase.",1188000000,5,1401,4.659919028340081

1853026,5,B00008N705,"Watch Alan Partridge as the chat show host you'll love to hate as his ""moribund"" chat show spirals further and further downward.  During each episode, Alan's guests of C-list celebrities become harder and harder to control.  But funniest of all is Alan himself as the self-absorbed, arrogant host who can't help but speak his mind when he should not.

For all of you who are tired of all the political correctness so replete in today's world, you'll love to see Alan's complete lack of tact or understanding as he says the things we all wish we could say at times.

In short, this show makes fun of the all too prevalent chat shows of today with their overly staged perfection.  This is the chat show you've always wanted to see but couldn't seem to find.

This set contains all six episodes of the series plus many fabulous extras involving Alan including the side splitting Christmas special, ""Knowing Me, Knowing Yule,"" which degenerates into Alan's shameless begging for a second series with the BBC.  These special features are not to be missed.

Also of note, if you enjoy this show, don't miss the hilarious sequel, ""I'm Alan Partridge,"" due for release on October 24, 2006.

This is truly one of the funniest Britcom's available on DVD.  So don't miss the opportunity to own it now.

1853027,5,B00008N705,"Steve Coogan's toothy, self-satisfied Alan Partridge gives Ricky Gervais's David Brent a serious run for his money as one of New Britain's most smarmy upwardly-mobile creations. Coogan's got Partridge's class position down pitch-perfect: Norwich wine bars, childhood vacations in Spain, two A-levels, a disdain for Oxbridge liberals, and an instinctive ""little Britain"" conservatism that's quite happy to grab all the goodies a burgeoning Europe offers. The show's funny, but I found myself less interested in the laughs than in the world Coogan builds around his character, so that you feel you know him much better than you should after six short shows. The skits are also clever in a low-key offbeat way, like the recurring segment where Alan Partridge interviews other people with the name of Alan Partridge. ""Knowing me Alan Partridge knowing you another Alan Partridge, A-ha!""

The thing about Partridge, like Brent, is that as loathsome as you're supposed to find him, you end up kind of pulling for him. They're basically overgrown boys, not vicious so much as clueless, British lads baffled by a PC world. The historians of the future will have a field day working out why post-Thatcher Britain turned to characters like these, and why they play so funny over here.",1147996800,7,1274,5.154589371980676
1853028,5,B00008N705,"""Whenever you hear the word A-HA, you will become a little scary monster!""

This is one of countless classic moments in this hilarious series which showcases the further broadcasting adventures of the Alan Partridge character. KMKY combines a wickedly hilarious script, superb comical acting and a knack for making the viewer feel silly, uncomfortable and ready to burst with spontaneous fits of laughter all at once.

I watched one episode of this series on BBC America and instantly became hooked. Having watched several cheesy talk shows in my time it was refreshing to watch a character like Partridge successfully spoof the genre as a whole. Steve Coogan's portrayal of Partridge is performed with a whole-hearted dose of comical cheese, ignorance, stubborness and cluelessness. From his silly grin and 70's sportscaster wardrobe to his plastic like hairdo, Partridge epitomizes, again, the schmaltzy ""I think I'm larger than life"" attitude of all the Regis Philbins, Geraldo Riveras and Jerry Springers put together.

Lots of great extras are included on this 2 DVD set, including a test pilot which is every bit as funny as the series itself and the KMKY Christmas Special.

After KMKY ended the Alan Partridge character continued in a series of his own (which also airs on BBC America) called ""I'm Alan Partridge."" Hopefully the BBC will give that series a proper DVD release in North America as well so those of us across the pond can fully enjoy the genius of Coogan's comical mind.
