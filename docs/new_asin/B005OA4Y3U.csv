4851545,5,B005OA4Y3U,"To have a great video, which is clean, fun and keeps kids engaged is excellent! I'll definitely order more LazyTown videos for her.",1354406400,5,131,4.739130434782608
4851546,4,B005OA4Y3U,I bought this dvd because my daughter likes lazytown episodes. I think its very funny. i would buy another dvd for her,1353888000,,118,4.409090909090909
4851547,4,B005OA4Y3U,"LazyTown: One of the most positive and creative children's programs ever. Don't hesitate to get this DVD, the Amazon 6.99 price is right.

Widescreen versions, English language.

The cast and the visuals and music are all enchanting. LazyTown was recorded in a custom-designed studio for incorporating live actors, masked actors, puppets, props, and the animated backgrounds. Very energetic and all synchronized perfectly.

This DVD has 3 episodes, with no menu. The ""next chapter >|"" button on your remote will advance to the beginning of the next episode. There are no credits at the end of each episode: Robbie Rotten has the ending scene, and the next episode starts. After I inserted the DVD it played the warning, other brief product ads, then the program of 3 consecutive episodes began.

The DVD has no captions, which is an awful shame for a 2012 PBS Kids Sprout affiliated DVD, or for any company. I hope NCircle Entertainment sees this review. Missing subtitles, no menus, 3 random episodes per DVD package: these are all negatives on the re-issuing of LazyTown. You should be doing better. Thanks for the widescreen versions, however there is no DVD Content technical listing on the back of the box, or anywhere, just a note of 75 minutes long. The box gives the ""Stories included"" episode titles.

The 52 regular episodes of seasons 1 & 2 will cost over $120.00 at the rate of 3 episodes per DVD @ 6.99 each if you want the beautiful widescreen episodes.

Welcome to LazyTown (Episode 1-01), Dr. Rottenstein (1-11), and Sports Day (1-03).",1343174400,13,1551,4.923371647509579
4851548,4,B005OA4Y3U,"This DVD contains 3 previously released episodes:  Welcome to LazyTown, Dr. Rottenstein, and Sports Day.

This appears to be a repackaging effort by NCircle. These were originally issued on other multiple LazyTown DVD's offered by Nickleodeon several years ago.

I took a chance on this DVD because I did not know what was going to be on it.  My daughter likes it just the same.  But, in the future, I would like to know exactly what episodes will be on each DVD before I pre-order again.",1337212800,21,488,4.627906976744186

4851554,5,B005OA4Y3U,"My grandson watches this on Netflix and loves it. For 4yrs old, he tries to act like Sportacus. I found this so we can watch it at my house. The story line is a great concept. I wish this was a regular tv program. Its about a town that the mayor wants everybody lazy and not do anything. Then Stephanie(girl in pink), tries to get the kids to play and when mayor interrupts, Sportacus comes save the day. The music is fun, the plots are fun, I can't give it enough good reviews. This show also got my 4 yr old to eat ""sports candy""-which is fruits. He loves apples and calls them sports candy.",1388448000,2,593,4.165217391304348
4851555,5,B005OA4Y3U,"My boys LOVE Lazy Town, and the Welcome to Lazy Town dvd did not disappoint.  We watch it once or twice a week, and it gets the kids off the couch and jumping around.  It's great for those rainy days when you're stuck inside!",1386028800,,225,4.090909090909091

4851558,5,B005OA4Y3U,This show is great for young kids. Great message and great cast of characters!  Sportacus and Stephanie make a great team and are fun to watch.  My 3 year old loves dancing to the catchy tunes.,1377129600,,193,4.333333333333333

4851560,5,B005OA4Y3U,">I got hooked on this show as I baby sitted 5 kids, ages 3-6.........they absolutely love it and watch it every day......as do I! So, as they prepared to leave for Florida today from Kansas, I bought this for them to watch in their van as they traveled. They are so excited......they had to watch one episode yesterday just as a preview.

  The series is actually quite entertaining.........I love Robbie Rotten and can't wait to see how he is foiled by the host of characters! But, from time to time, even this man is shown to have a soft side.

  Most importantly, the series focuses on certain values: for children to be happy and healthy, obey, learn and to be kind. All the live and puppet characters convey these things to the children.

  As a person who grew up on ""Howdy Doody"" in the 1950's, I like that quality of this show......values are extremely important.",1372118400,,871,4.567741935483871
4851561,4,B005OA4Y3U,"My daughter with a huge sweet tooth really got the message of ""A Sugar Meltdown"".  An Olympic Athlete slumping to the ground after someone slips him sugar disguised as an apple - powerful image.  And for Moms, the energy of the flips and one handed hand stands - makes me think I should step up my game when playing with kids.  The big puppet heads of some of the characters is a bit odd, but it is easy to get used to.",1364860800,,419,4.085365853658536
4851562,5,B005OA4Y3U,"Amazon barred me from posting my original review, so here goes another try. I will keep in mind that amazon is preventing simple great detailed reviews from being posted to avoid competition. This is a great series and I love these episodes. The stories are simple and the music and dancing is timeless. Your kids will beg to watch these over and over. I noticed that the series is getting airtime on tv again too. It would be great if they found new actors to make a new series, but we just have to live with this until that day comes. The complete series is on another site that is similar to orange (compare that to something), but I can't name it here or I get censored.

review edit
Seems my review made it past censors, so here goes more info. Season 3 in 2013 is now up on the lazytown site (just use the name). I hope amazon gets this available on its cloud service. I like the new actor Chloe, she's got a great future ahead for her. Michelle Obama did a spot with Sportacus ! (see it on the official site)",1363478400,4,1029,4.276923076923077
4851563,5,B005OA4Y3U,My three year old loves to dance and sing along with Stephanie and Sportucus.  Plot lines are simple and easy to follow. Sets and costumes (and characters) are brightly colored and fun to look at. The overarching message is to eat healthfully and stay active.,1360540800,,259,4.7555555555555555
4851564,5,B005OA4Y3U,"My kids used to watch this show, we love that it promotes activity AND learning moral lessons. The kids were really into the songs and fun. I purchased this DVD for my 1 year old nephew, he might be a little young for it yet but, I think he'll get a few years of enjoyment out of it.",1360108800,,283,3.896551724137931

4851567,4,B005OA4Y3U,"My son loves this program on Sprout, and after seeing the ""one where Stephanie comes to LazyTown"" on live TV, asked repeatedly to see it again. Alas, I had not DVRed that one. This DVD contains the first episode as well as two other. The show is an excellent show for kids with a healthy message. Further, there are parts even I as an adult find humorous; so it's not irritating for grownups to watch. My only complaint, and the reason I didn't give this product five stars, is that there is no main menu to select each episode. I just start it and it goes. Because there is no main menu, the DVD will simply star over by itself if left to run. It seems to me that making a menu wouldn't have been too much trouble or expense...",1357171200,,728,4.207142857142857

8481009,5,B005OA4Y3U,"Good show for kids to exercise and eating healthy. Also it has catchy songs like ""Have You Ever"", ""Good Stuff"", ""Energy"" and the popular ""Bing Bang"" ending song. This DVD unfortunately doesn't offer a menu. 'Welcome to LazyTown' and 'Sports Day' episodes has never been release in the US from the previous Nickelodeon sets. 'Sports Day' is an exception because Kmart gave out a LazyTown Limited Edition Kmart Exclusive DVD with one episode and 2 music video when they carry LazyTown merchandise back when Nickelodeon aired the show. This DVD is not widescreen which I was hoping for and it's actually full frame. Hopefully the 1st two seasons with Julianna Rose Mauriello gets the blu-ray treatment from NCircle Entertainment (if they still have the rights for the show) or another company with bonus features and including all the episodes from LazyTown Extra.

LazyTown is not the same with the new girl. My youngest sister keeps re-watching the old episodes with Julianna Mauriello and she tells me the songs aren't catchy like the first two seasons.",1427068800,2,1053,5.017142857142857
