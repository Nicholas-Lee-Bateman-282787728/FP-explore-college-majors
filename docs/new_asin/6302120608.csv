425839,5,6302120608,I love Doris Day Movies and I own all 39/39 of her movies but I have to say that this is my favorite one. Doris was so magical in this role as Miss Georgia Kent and Who can forget Jack Carsons fantastic Role as the Detective. Elvira Kent (Janis Page) thinks that Her Husband is being unfaithful and her husband thinks the same about her. So they both make the other one think they are going on their honeymoon so they each send a spy but they don't know that the other one didn't go. Well Georgia uses the name of Elvira Kent and The Detective thinks she is Elivra Kent and they go on a merry little chase. This movie was Doris's Film Debut and she sings my personal favorite song in this movie It's Magic. And who can forget the catchy tune the Tourist Trade. What a beautiful movie. This is a great movie for the whole family to enjoy.,1089417600,11,837,4.172839506172839

425841,4,6302120608,"Doris Day began her long and phenomenally successfully screen career when she arrived on the Warner Brothers lot in 1947 to begin filming ""Romance on the High Seas"".
The project had been kicking around the lot for a while and there had been, at various times, talks about borrowing Judy Garland from MGM or Betty Hutton from Paramount to star in it.
At the time Doris Day was a recognized singer with a very successful six year career as a top big band and solo vocalist to her credit, including a couple of Gold Records. She had no interest in pursuing a film career but was heard singing at a Hollywood party, was screen tested, and the rest is cinema history.
""Romance on the High Seas"" is a glossy, bon-bon of a film, decked out in lush settings, with a lot of nice-looking people, pleasant tunes, and wrapped up in some breathtaking technicolor.  It's irresistable.
The plot involves a married couple who don't trust one another. The husband hires a private eye to follow the wife on a cruise she is taking to find out if she is being faithful. In the meantime, the wife hires someone to take her place on the cruise so she can remain in New York City to check up on the husband. The private eye falls in love with the woman who is purporting to be the wife and by the closing minutes of the film all of the confusion has been settled to everyones' satisfaction, especially the audiences.
Thanks to the skill of Director Michael Curtiz, who keeps the proceedings moving along smoothly and the attractive cast making the improbabilities rather believable, it works much better than it sounds.
The husband and wife are played by Don DeFore and Janis Paige. It's clearly evident why Defore's movie career was never stellar. On television's ""Hazel"" he was more at home.
Miss Paige handles her limited screen time with grace and charm. She wears a stylish wardrobe attractively but displays not one iota of chemistry with DeFore.
Jack Carson, as the detective, tends to overact in a number of scenes but in his scenes with Doris Day there is genuine warmth and, at times, subtlety.  This was the first of three films they made together and it is clear that their personal friendship contributed to their on-screen playing.
Although billed fourth in the credits, Doris Day stole the picture and received the lion's share of acclaim from critics and moviegoers.
She is a natural, and it's difficult to believe that this is her first film. She has a natural affinity with the camera and it has a love affair with her. In color, she is a radiant dream, genuine, sincere, unaffected, and heartfelt. There are already traces of the comic timing and skill that would serve her so well in her later box-office blockbusters in the 1950's and 60's.
As a ""dreamer"" who hangs around a travel agency wanting to go someplace, there are traces of Betty Hutton in her style, but once she gets her chance to masquerade as Paige's wife, she develops her own unique personality that has the audience clearly on her side.
S.Z. ""Cuddles"" Sakall is his usual self and Oscar Levant, the famed author, wit, and musician, is wry and sarcastic as Day's longtime boyfriend. Year's later he boasted that he knew Day ""...before she was a virgin..."", a remark that has followed her to this day.
Sammy Cahn and Jule Styne put together a pleasing group of songs for this film including ""I'm in Love"", ""It's You or No One"", ""Put em in a Box...."" and the film's mega-hit, ""It's Magic"". Doris Day's recording of this Oscar nominated song, topped the charts for months, becoming a Gold Record hit and a tune forever identified with her. When she initially sings it during a lovely scene with Carson at an outdoor cafe, a star was indeed born.
If you're looking for an entertaining film that won't place any demands upon you but will leave you feeling warm, fuzzy, and uplifted by the time the end credits roll, then set sail for some ""Romance on the High Seas"".",1011916800,53,3925,4.629842180774749
425842,3,6302120608,"This is one of those movies which, in memory, seems so much funnier, sweeter, sillier, downright BETTER than it actually is:  mainly because of the presence of Doris Day.
The script makes no sense whatsoever:  rich, spoiled, battling, married couple hires snoops to follow their supposedly cheating mates.  And neither one suspects a thing.  The movie keeps churning out dumb and dumber dialogue in each succeeding scene.  All the characters, if taken seriously, would be horribly unlikeable, but none of the characters is even an inch thicker than one dimensional cardboard.  Jack Carson, in many movies a clever comedian, is lost as Doris Day's romantic interest; Janis Paige is shrill as Doris' bratty employer; Oscar Levant contributes his usual neurotic presence; and then there's Doris.  Her voice, her face, her charm, her simplicity all make this movie watchable.
None of Sammy Cahn and Jule Styne's songs is memorable except...and it's a big exception...""It's Magic"" which is one of the most beautiful songs Day ever recorded.",996710400,8,1035,5.236363636363636
425843,5,6302120608,"I own most all of Doris Day's movies, but this is truly my favorite.  Doris really shines in this movie with Jack Carson.  The pair have that  special spark between them that makes the movie work. Jack Carson is a  detective who is trying to catch a wife (Elvira Kent) cheating on her  husband.  Doris is the lounge singer who has always dreamed of traveling  ... anywhere.  She is approached by Mrs. Elvira Kent to travel under her  name on the trip so she can stay home and catch her husband cheating. With  all of the twists and turns of this movie your eyes will be glued to the  screen.  I would never give away the ending, but it sounds interesting  doesn't it? So very ""hip"", ""with it"", ""cool""  and ""modern"".  As usual, Doris is beautiful, and she plays the  part perfectly.  I wish there were more movies like this being made today.

425936,3,6302120608,"Romance on the High Seas(released June/48)is an average film with an above average cast,that should have been much better than it was. Much of the failure has to do with the less than stellar script,but one cannot say the cast didn't give it the old college try. We have on tap Warner's great cast of character actors such as Jack Carson,S.Z.Sakall(one of my all time faves),Franklin Pangborn and the wonderful Eric Blore(the foil in many of the Astaire/Rogers films at RKO).Also on hand is pianist supremo Oscar Levant,in an uncredited role as a ships radioman Grady Sutton and of course we have singer,now actress,in her first movie role,Doris Day. And she acquits herself admirably.
The first 30 minutes of the film starts out promisingly as we find suspicious and jealous Janet Paige marrying her beau,a just as suspicious and jealous Don Defore. S.Z.Sakall runs a hugely successful drug company and Defore helps him run it. Three years pass without the two going on any sort of anniversary trip,but Paige is determined they finally do. Paige books a trip to South America but Defore again is forced to cancel. Paige says she is going,but instead sends local club singer Day in her place as her,while Paige stays behind to see what Defore does when she is ""away"".But Defore,also suspicious,hires private eye Carson to spy on her. The story devolves into the usual line of Carson falling in love with Day,but not being able to do anything about it as she is ""married"".Eventually Day's boyfriend back in New York,Levant,shows up on board part way through the voyage to throw a monkey wrench into things. Then to top this,due to the ""reports""Carson is sending back to Defore,Defore decides to go to Rio too,along with Sakall. The usual mix ups and misunderstandings result until it is all resolved in the end.
While watching Day I couldn't help thinking that Betty Hutton would have been perfect in Day's part and when the scene changed to Rio,I was expecting Carmen Miranda to appear any second. At least SHE would have livened up the considerably dull proceedings(by this time)immensely. Day however did do a good job in her first role,even though her debut song was the forgettable ""I Love you,I love you,I love you"".One has to wait until almost half way through to hear the gem of the movie,her real life hit ""It's Magic"".
Technically the print is a very good one. There are a few seconds however when the ships doctor is examining Day,when the colour begins to bleed from both actors bodies. It comes and goes but I don't know whether it was just a film flaw the digital process couldn't quite handle or a momentary failure of the digital process itself. Otherwise the film is crisp and clear. Extras include a wonderful short featuring an audience sing a long with older and newer songs,the trailer and the classic Warner's cartoon ""I taw a Putty tat"".
All in all just an average film vehicle for Day's first film. She is more than ably supported by a wonderful cast,however the plot is such that it inevitably takes the movie down like the Titanic. Day's hit song ""It's Magic"" is heard to great effect,it is just too bad the script didn't have any.",1334448000,,3156,4.782051282051282

""Romance"" is filled with classic Hollywood cheese, rapidly fired one liners and quirky people doing quirky things. The exotic places where the cruise ship stops are a fun escape from the norm, and are populated with stereotypes that reflect the average unseasoned traveler's attitudes towards tropical locations at the time of filming. Although, I feel that only adds to the film's charms as it is essentially an escape into a different world for the average 1940s American. The character actors throughout the film are a snapshot of things as they were before unapologetic stunt casting removed these types of artists from mainstream work.

425942,4,6302120608,"Doris Day made her legendary film debut in 1948's ROMANCE ON THE HIGH SEAS, but it's interesting to think that it might not have happened, if not for a few casting problems.  Warner Brothers originally considered borrowing Judy Garland for the picture; then Betty Hutton was pencilled in - but her pregnancy forced her to bow out.  At a party, the film's composers urged band singer Doris Day to do an impromptu ""audition"" for director Michael Curtiz.  All ready to pack her things and return to her young son Terry in Cincinnati, Day wasn't terribly fussed about becoming an actress, as she explained to Curtiz - ""I don't bounce around. I just sing.""  Curtiz, impressed by her fresh, honest approach to the situation, cast Day on the spot...and the rest is history.

Suspicious wife Elvira Kent (Janis Paige) arranges for a struggling, holiday-mad band singer named Georgia Garrett (Doris Day) to assume her persona during a cruise to South America, so that she may secretly stay home and keep tabs on her philandering husband Michael (Don DeFore).  In retaliation, Michael arranges for private detective Peter Virgil (Jack Carson) to tail his ""wife"" on the cruise.  Aboard ship, Georgia, operating as Elvira, winds up falling for Peter, who soon realises that he's going to have to come clean to Michael and admit that HE'S the one about to break up the marriage!

ROMANCE ON THE HIGH SEAS is an effervescent screwball comedy with flashes of musical greatness (Busby Berkeley choreographed the imaginative South American scenes).  It's hardly a ""classic"" but the performance of Doris Day in her movie debut has always given the film a certain extra attention that it might not have otherwise received.  The score introduced Day's chart-topping ballad ""It's Magic"", and the musical programme also includes ""Put 'Em in a Box"", ""I'm in Love"", and ""It's You or No-one"".

On a sidenote it's a bit of a thrill seeing Doris Day and Janis Paige together a good six or seven years before their professional paths would cross again thanks to ""The Pajama Game"".  Janis Paige originated the role of Babe on Broadway in 1954, but it was Doris Day who replaced her in the movie version three years later!",1309478400,,2192,4.878706199460916

425976,4,6302120608,"By the late 1940s, Warner Brothers was no longer a major producer of lavish musicals--but in 1947 they decided to return to the field with ROMANCE ON THE HIGH SEAS, a lightweight tale of luxury liner romance and comic confusion. Lacking a major musical star, the studio sought to borrow Judy Garland from MGM--but MGM, notoriously possessive of its musical leading lady, refused. Warner then went to Paramount and did indeed secure the services of Betty Hutton--but Hutton became pregnant and would be visibly so by the time cameras began to roll. With deadlines looming, it seemed ROMANCE ON THE HIGH SEAS was dead in the water.

Enter Doris Day. An attractive blonde from Cincinnati, Day had begun her career with the aspiration to become a dancer, only to find her teenage hopes dashed when a car in which she was traveling was struck by a train. Told she would never dance again, she spent her recovery singing along with the radio and ultimately emerged as a noted ""girl singer"" on the big band scene, recording one of World War II's most beloved hits, ""Sentimental Journey."" But the life of a girl singer with the band was not an easy one, and Day was close to hanging it up when she was invited to a Los Angeles party and favored the crowd with a song or two. Director Michael Curtiz was among those present and although Day was not greatly enthusiastic he quickly coaxed her into a screen test.

Out of such unlikely circumstances are great stars sometimes born. In her autobiography Day writes that she wasn't wild about the film-making process, that she greatly disliked the heavy make-up and hair gel required to create the glossy image then in vogue, and that she was horrified and embarrassed when she saw herself on screen. All things considered, she didn't expect much that was positive to come out of the experience. ROMANCE ON THE HIGH SEAS made her into an overnight sensation, the viable musical star Warner Brothers sought, complete with fan mail and hit records.

As already noted, the film that launched her career was indeed flyweight. Michael and Elvira Kent (Don DeFore and Janis Paige) are a married couple who are habitually jealous and suspicious of each other--and when Janis decides to take an ocean voyage her husband hires private detective Peter Virgil (Jack Carson) to tag along and spy upon her. But unbeknownst to Michael, Elvira has sent lounge singer Georgia Garrett (Doris Day) on the cruise while she remains in New York to spy on Michael. Needless to say, romantic and comic complications ensue, with the film's most amusing moments fueled by such memorable character actors as S.Z. Sakall, Oscar Levant, Eric Blore, Franklin Pangborn, and Sir Lancelot.

No one would accuse Curtiz of having a knack for musicals, and although Busby Berkley handled the musical numbers he was significantly past his prime. Nonetheless, the film moves at fast clip, the musical numbers are engaging, the performances are expert, and the whole thing looks as lush as late 1940s Technicolor can make it--and there is Doris Day, fourth billed but clearly the star, blonde and beautiful and singing ""It's Magic."" It was magic indeed, and although ROMANCE ON THE HIGH SEAS isn't in the forefront of the musical genre it is nonetheless a truly charming, completely unpretentious movie that both fans of the genre, the stars, and most particularly of Doris Day will truly enjoy. MGM had Garland; Paramount had Hutton; 20th Century Fox had Betty Grable. But now Warner's had Doris Day, and although she was a slightly unwilling star, her film career would outlast the film careers of all of them.

The DVD offers an excellent print of the film that plays to its Technicolor brightness and the sound elements are quite good as well. Unfortunately, there is nothing in the way of bonuses: a Warner cartoon staring Tweety and Sylvester is fun, of course, and a sing-along short gives us the likes of Ethel Waters, but with the exception of the original theatrical trailer there's nothing to pertaining to the film itself.

425979,5,6302120608,"Romance On The High Seas has great musical numbers, a plot to keep your attention--and we see the film debut of Doris Day. The plot moves along at a good pace; and the acting is rather good although I've still seen better.

The action begins when Mrs. Elvira Kent (Janis Paige) suspects her husband Michael Kent (Don DeFore) of cheating on her since he can never celebrate their anniversary together on a vacation. He's always working, Michael tells Elvira. Worse yet, Michael Kent himself suspects that Elvira is cheating on him, too. Things come to a head when Elvira and Uncle Lazlo (S.Z. Sakall) get a small time singer Georgia Garret (Doris Day) to take Elvira's place on the cruise ship and impersonate her. That way, Elvira can actually stay in New York herself to keep an eye on her husband. Michael, also the suspicious type, hires private eye Peter Virgil (Jack Carson) to go on that same cruise and find out if Elvira (who is now Georgia Garrett masquerading as Elvira) is cheating.

Easy plot, right? It took me three tries to understand it. Ouch! The upshot is that Peter Virgil and Georgia Garrett, masquerading as Elvira Kent, are the two people who go on the cruise. Michael and Elvira Kent both remain in New York using their own separate methods to spy on each other.

However, my effort to understand the plot was worth it. The movie has great musical numbers and you can tell why this film made Doris Day a star--she sings beautifully and she looks good, too.

Things heat up when Georgia (still masquerading as Elvira Kent) meets Peter Virgil on the ship--and they fall in love. Of course, Peter thinks she's the real Elvira Kent and it makes for some tough going for Georgia and Peter. Things intensify even more when Peter informs Michael Kent more and more that ""his wife"" is cheating.

Of course, the plot can go anywhere from here. What will Michael Kent finally do if he thinks Elvira is cheating on him? Of course, the real Elvira never left New York, so she isn't cheating on him. Will the real Elvira find her husband Michael cheating on her in New York when he thinks she's away? What happens to Georgia through all of this? And what about Georgia's guy friend who wants to be her beau, Oscar Farrar (Oscar Levant)? How will he figure into all this? No spoilers here, folks--you'll just have to watch the movie to find out!

The choreography is very good in the musical numbers staged at the ports of call for the cruise ship; and the cinematography works to frame Doris Day so well within the picture as she sings to perfection.

The DVD comes with the theatrical trailer, a cartoon, and a cute piece about singing a song or two--from other movies.

Overall, Romance On The High Seas is a rather entertaining film with comedy, great musical numbers and a relatively stable plot for a film with so much music in it. The acting could have been a tad better but the rest is so good I can almost completely ignore this. I highly recommend this film for fans of Doris Day, classic movie musicals.",1203292800,5,3023,4.574861367837339
425980,5,6302120608,"""Casablanca"" has ""As Time Goes By,"" and ""Romance on the High Seas"" has ""It's Magic!""

And it truly is! This Michael Curtiz comedy, starring a young starry-eyed Doris Day playing opposite a delightfully funny Jack Carson has everything that used to make you want to go to the movies: Excellent music, excellent comedy, and excellent dancing (Busby Berkeley numbers, yet!). The story, which is perfectly ridiculous and ridiculously perfect, is too complicated to go into here, and totally irrelevant. It is merely the framework for ninety-nine minutes of sheer entertainment.

Catch the scene at the bar in Trinidad between Jack Carson and Oscar Levant and an anonymous pie-eyed patron! High Farce at its best. And guess what? The movie has extra features that are actually worth seeing: i.e., a Loony Tunes ""I Taw a Putty Tat!"" cartoon with Sylvester the Cat and Tweety Bird, and a specially-made trailer with Doris Day and Janis Paige that actually makes you want to watch the film again.

This is Doris Day's first movie and she really had an excellent debut.  The movie is very indicitive of that period in time and although some people may think it a bit dated, it must be viewed in context with that period.

425984,4,6302120608,"Doris Day sparkles in this film, which was her film debut; it's a predictable, silly but fun plot of a couple who suspect each other of cheating, and devise ways of spying, only to be confused by wrong identities and of course, love.

The cast surrounding Doris is terrific, with Janis Page and Don DeFore as the couple, Jack Carson as Peter Vigil, the private investigator in love with Doris, Oscar Levant as a down and out pianist also in love with Doris, S.Z. Sakell as Uncle Lazlo who meddles in everything, and Leslie Brooks as the stunning secretary that raises Janis Paige's suspicions.

This 1948 film is peppered with lovely Jule Styne/Sammy Cahn songs, including the Oscar nominated ""It's Magic"". Others are ""I'm in Love"", ""It's You or No One"", ""The Tourist Trade"" (sung by Avon Long), ""Put 'Em in a Box, Tie 'Em with a Ribbon, and Throw 'Em in the Deep Blue Sea"", ""Two Lovers Met in the Night"", ""Run, Run, Run"" (sung by Jack Carson), and Oscar Levant plays his ""Caribbean Rhapsody"".

Directed with swift pacing by Michael Curtiz, the dance numbers are choreographed by Busby Berkeley, The Page Cavanaugh Trio back Doris in some numbers, and the Technicolor cinematography and fabulous fashions are great to look at.

The circumstances of Doris Day being hired for this film read like a Cinderella story. Jule Styne heard her sing at a party while he was looking for a replacement for Betty Hutton, who had to back out of the film due to pregnancy, and urged Michael Curtiz to hire her. Doris was 23 at the time, and as a singer had a hit with ""Sentimental Journey"", but according to biographies was in the process of a second divorce, at a low point in her life, and ready to ""quit show business"" when this opportunity came her way...and a star was born.

Total running time is 99 minutes.",1115424000,23,1800,4.6125

Hot Toasty Rag, February 5, 2018

Romance on the High Seas is not only my favorite Doris Day movie, but its also one of my favorite old movies! Everything about it is perfect: the acting, the songs, the premise, the jokes, the costumesand to top it all off, the two leads fell in love with each other during the movie! Ive yet to see a man look at a woman in real life the way Jack Carson looks at Doris Day in Romance on the High Seas. Every time he gazes at her during the song Its Magic, I swoonand Ive seen the movie close to fifty times!

I could spend a paragraph detailing the adorable setup of the plot, but then you wouldnt get to experience every delightful emotion the first time you watch it. Trust me on this one, its cute, funny, and irresistible. Every character, no matter their faults, is endearing, and you cant help but root for them. And an added bonus is the wonderful chemistry and timing of the cast. Everyone works beautifully off each other, and the natural but tight timing of the jokes is remarkable.

Its hard to believe that Romance on the High Seas was Doris Days first movie; shed made a name for herself with her singing and Hollywood gave her a break by introducing her in a leading role. She and Jack Carson made three movies together, and after watching any of thembut this first one in particularyoull refuse to believe any other offscreen tale than their enjoyment of a long and happy life together. Theyre so sweet, considerate, comfortable, and down-right perfect together.

Many times in movies, old or new, the supporting characters aren't very interesting or entertaining. In Romance on the High Seas, everyone has laugh lines, everyone puts their heart into their performance, and everyone gives the audience a warm, fuzzy feeling. S.Z. Sakall has hilarious quips with a mixture of broken English and well-intended awkward comments. Oscar Levant, while as depressing and negative as he always is, still grabs at the audiences heart as he knows he doesnt have Doris Days heart. Eric Blores show-stopping turn as an incompetent doctor is easily one of the funniest parts of the entire film. Even Franklin Pangborn makes the most of his few minutes on the screen, and John Berkes who has no lines at all, is a hilarious addition to his scene!

There are certain gowns that stand out in ones memory as the greatest gowns in film history. Everyone has their favoritesGone with the Wind, The King and I, and Atonement come to mindand Doris Days metallic blue gown designed by Milo Anderson in Romance on the High Seas is one of my all-time favorite film dresses. Even if the movie were garbage, it would be worth watching just to admire that dress. Thankfully, the movie is nearly perfect, but in all the wondrous moments youll remember long after you watch itIts Magic, You have principles, Im no blabbermouth! I guarantee the blue dress will be one of them. Watch it and find out. Youre better off buying a copy than renting it, though, as I cant seem to let a few months go by without popping my copy in the DVD player!",1517788800,,3094,4.587703435804702
