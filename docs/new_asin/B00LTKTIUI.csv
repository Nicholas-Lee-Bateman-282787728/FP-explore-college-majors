6504985,2,B00LTKTIUI,"This is not a beginners dance dvd.  The moves are not consistent (right and left sides are not the same) and she forgets and often changes steps when putting the routine together.  I am a former dancer and don't have a problem ""keeping up"" but I've determined that Tracy Anderson is not a good dance instructor.  Her mat routines are awesome; I'll stick to those.",1413504000,53,363,4.553846153846154
6504986,5,B00LTKTIUI,So easy to follow and you really get in a great cardio workout - my favorite of her dvd's so far!,1413417600,5,97,3.6666666666666665
6504987,1,B00LTKTIUI,IMO she doesn't know how to teach dance at all for beginners.  Not enough repetition.  Seemed far more interested in what she looked like than in methodically teaching a routine for a good workout.  I will stay with Shawn T all the way.,1488758400,,236,4.441860465116279

6504990,5,B00LTKTIUI,"I love this workout, I do it every day for at least 30 minutes followed by her Metamorposis dvds and yoga. It is easy to follow and easy on your joints which is why I do it. I burn an average of 100 calories per 15 minute interval...which is a plus!",1484697600,,249,3.9019607843137254
6504991,5,B00LTKTIUI,amazing workout.  you don't think it's that challenging but then you notice the body changes almost immediately.,1484611200,,112,5.588235294117647
6504992,2,B00LTKTIUI,"Things I liked about the product: Tracy Anderson has a non-bubbly voice which I tend to prefer to the uber hyper variety. She looked pretty and set was cool looking.

Things I disliked:
Okay- so to be fair I only got through the first 1.5 segments so far. But... that's how bored I was. This lady seems like she is making the routines up on the fly. AND she doesn't even use proper left and right cues for the person watching the DVD at home which is annoying. This just felt very budget. Maybe she only had one shot to shoot the videos or something? She kept getting lefts and rights confused and switching things up in a random way. Not to mention the moves themselves were lame as heck. Stepping side to side over and over again... lol or little lame hops. I don't know. I wasn't sweating. I was annoyed. Wasted 8 bucks lol. At first I wondered why it was just her in the video.. Then I realized you'd have to put effort into choreographing a routine with a group.. Which is likely why it is just her on the screen. The lack of extra people on the set effects the energy/motivation of the video. so I guess energy overall is lacking.

I'm sure she is a nice lady and I feel bad saying this stuff but yeah. Disappointment.

I will say if you are SUPER out of shape... this might be a challenge and could be a good video to pick. But that still wouldn't solve the issue of the backwards left and right cues or lacking energy or randomness in routine.",1483833600,,1451,4.25
6504993,4,B00LTKTIUI,I got to the Tracy Anderson studio in NYC and it was very hard for me to catch on to the dance moves since I only make it to the studio one and awhile. This video offers a lot of the moves they already teach and breaks it down so I can actually learn. Worth it!!,1483401600,2,262,3.6964285714285716
6504994,1,B00LTKTIUI,"This was soooo not worth the money.  It was absolutely the worst, she screwed up several times during the video and I didn't even work up a sweat.",1483056000,,146,4.214285714285714
6504995,2,B00LTKTIUI,"Kind of basic and repetitous. Also, she needs to pull up her pants. If for no other reason, it makes her legs look short.",1482624000,,121,4.083333333333333
6504996,5,B00LTKTIUI,"I love these workouts. Start with the first one, move on to the others. The last two are super great and make you sweat!! It's fun to do one, then move on to one or two more once you've got the energy. I LOVE that you don't need much room either. Looking forward to doing this today...",1482192000,3,285,4.017543859649122

6505000,3,B00LTKTIUI,"meh.  her muscular workouts are far superior to her cardio.  this is a nice dance routine.  I don't mind that she doesn't queue every step.  even someone as uncoordinated as me can follow along.  what I don't like is that she doesn't do the routine evenly or in order.  she breaks down the steps, and then builds them into a routine.  I like that type of cardio video.  but then she forgets moves, or adds in new ones.  I wouldn't even mind the unexpected moves if she was consistent.  she'll do the dance one way and then skip moves or put them out of order or forget to do them on the other side.  this isn't spontaneity, it's poor editing.  this could have been a much more fun workout.",1476144000,5,689,4.255813953488372
6505001,2,B00LTKTIUI,"Overall these are okay, but the the routine pieces are very inconsistent. She leaves pieces out and in one of the routines changes it every single time so you can't get into a rhythm. I also started having foot pain after doing these 2-3 times a week for about 3 weeks. I run and do other no impact weight lifting, but have never had foot pain until starting these. :(
Wouldn't buy another dance dvd from her, but if it weren't for the pain I'd keep at these to get a different cardio workout than running.",1469404800,,506,4.28125
6505002,5,B00LTKTIUI,I love her workouts! She is amazing. You will sweat and have fun. Thanks,1467936000,,72,4.214285714285714
6505003,4,B00LTKTIUI,Good intro/precursor to Tracy Anderson cardio. She goes over the core moves and choreography that she builds upon in her her other dance videos. I like to start simple and go on to her other videos and glad I did. I'd recommend this video before starting any of her other dance videos .,1467676800,6,286,4.415094339622642
6505004,1,B00LTKTIUI,"I'm a fan of many different workout videos and particularly enjoy the dance ones. This one, however, is  one I regret buying.

I've tried doing this video numerous times. I've done the first 15 minute segment 4 different times - it doesn't get better. It is awkward. I tried the second 15 minute segment one time and end up shutting it off after 5 minutes. The cues Tracy gives are terribly timed, with many given two steps after she started the new move. Often the moves do not coincide with the beat of the music.",1466985600,2,515,4.410526315789474
6505005,1,B00LTKTIUI,"This is terrible! No cueing at all, so you don't know what is coming next until she has already started. She is often off- beat ( and the music is awful anyway). I wish I could get my $ back!",1465603200,,191,3.8
6505006,4,B00LTKTIUI,"Great workout video. I loved the 15 minute segments that I cab piece together as I like. I found it challenging enough at first but after you get good at it, it might become a bit repetitive.",1465171200,,191,4.1891891891891895
6505013,5,B00LTKTIUI,I love this workout and am so grateful to have found it.  I had been so uninspired and this really got me moving again ...starting with just 15 mins.  I had tried another video of hers and found the moves too complex for me to keep up with given the fact that I'm about the more uncoordinated human on the planet but this is much easier for me and I found it really encouraging!  I hope she makes another one like this!,1464220800,3,419,4.085365853658536
6505014,5,B00LTKTIUI,I love this cardio dance for beginners. It checks every box in my exercise wish list and it's easy enough to do every day. Best purchase of my year and I noticed a difference in my body a few months after doing exercises 6 days per week.,1463961600,,237,4.0638297872340425
6505015,5,B00LTKTIUI,"Yes! It met my expectations! I highly recommend this before starting her normal programs...if your like me and not always coordinated!! Good video. And, it's in 15 minute segments.:)",1463011200,,182,5.310344827586207
6505016,3,B00LTKTIUI,"I have been to one of her studios and the class was great, it kicked my butt! I was hoping this tape would have the same dynamics but it didn't. It is good for cardio but dance-wise, I have tried better videos.",1462924800,,210,4.023809523809524
6505017,2,B00LTKTIUI,"I so wanted to love this. Although I have heard that Tracy Anderson is a phenomenal trainer, and that celebrities have given her kudos in regards to their physiques, this video left me completely underwhelmed.

At times, she was slightly motivating, and I can see how someone brand new to dance or working out may like a few of the moves and/or find them challenging.

Alas, the video seemed more focused on her wardrobe changes or her general ""look"" than it did on describing the benefits of each dance move, or offering other tips of the trade.

In short, this was not insightful and a waste of time. I could have turned on a dance list from Spotify and had the same, if not better, cardio results.",1462060800,,700,4.496062992125984
6505018,3,B00LTKTIUI,"This DVD has easy-to-follow moves, but it is not easy to follow.  I've been using workout DVDs for over 20 years so, in comparison, I find that Tracy Anderson's cueing is a bit off (too delayed) at times and her routine seems a bit inconsistent.  The worst part, and something I almost never see, is that she uses the wrong left-right instructions for mirror image (which is too much work for the brain).  I like her overall.  I find her voice pleasant, but those who don't like scratchy voices, might not.  The moves are basic and fun.  The 15-minute segments are nice so you can do a just enough to get me going workout (good for procrastinators!), or add on (and doing 15 mins is motivating to do more if you have time).  Hoping my Shazzy Fitness DVDs will prove better.",1461456000,2,773,4.439716312056738
6505019,4,B00LTKTIUI,"I've done many of Tracy's dance cardio DVDs. Recently, I felt I needed something more low impact , so I gave this one a try. I like it very much the first 3 are easy enough to follow and its lower impact than some her other DC DVDs.",1461110400,,232,3.8541666666666665
6505020,2,B00LTKTIUI,"I may like this more once I get into it, but the is certainly NOT a DVD for beginners. I was expecting the ""Basics"" routine to walk me through each movement so I could at least learn the names of the movements but no, it's right into a very fast paced and confusing workout. She definitely needs to learn that if you're going to stand in front of someone to walk them through movements that things should be down to the USER'S right/left, not the instructor's. She doesn't provide enough warning before changing steps either so it's very hard to follow along with if you're not coordinated. Seven minutes in and I've yelled ""WHAT IS GOING ON? WHAT ARE YOU DOING???"" at my TV several times...",1461024000,3,691,4.492063492063492
6505021,3,B00LTKTIUI,"This is an okay DVD for a workout. It can be frustrating at times as she does not keep the routine consistent. You think that you know what the next move will be, but then she changes it. Or she does a move 4 times once and then the next time she only does it twice. Also, she gets her right and left confused. She says left so you head left, but she really meant right. After having done the routines several times, you can learn to accommodate these difficulties. Just keep moving and you will still get a good workout.",1459900800,,521,4.1683168316831685
6505022,4,B00LTKTIUI,much easier to follow than cardio/dance that comes with meta....lower impact as well,1459209600,,84,5.538461538461538
6505023,4,B00LTKTIUI,"I am becoming quite the fan of Tracy Anderson.  I understand the criticisms of her workouts and share them (lack of cueing, cueing on the wrong side when she does, terrible music, etc) but I also think, ""who CARES?!"" if they can get you the results you want?  These are 4 fun little dance routines of 15 minutes each, and I find they are a good add-on to her toning dvds and are kind of fun.  I had read that some of her earlier dance/cardio moves were basically IMPOSSIBLE to follow so got this as a starter.  I find that I still throw it in the player from time to time even though I've gotten comfortable with most of the moves.  I do wish she would let you ""mirror"" her in her cueing, as in shout out ""left"" when YOU will go left (not when she does), but I also understand that not everything can be perfect when you're trying to create as much content as she is--she really seems to want her method to have enough available materials that people can keep growing with it and get results for a long period of time.",1458604800,4,1018,4.2
6505024,5,B00LTKTIUI,"I like this video.  I like the 1 and 3 sessions--for whatever they seem to be my favorite.  I usually do one of the 15 minute workouts after a Mat Workout or Method for Beginner workouts.  The cardio seems like a good way to end a workout since the others are more like strength training.  If I don't do strength training, I will try and do two of these.  I like they are only 15 minutes in case you just don't have time for something else.",1458518400,,440,4.069767441860465
6505025,4,B00LTKTIUI,"This was the first workout DVD I have ever tried. The workouts are fun and pretty easy to follow. She keeps switching which side she calls right and left, but I don't mind too much it is still a great workout! I also bought another one of her DVD's and I don't like that one-there is no instruction at all-but that isn't a problem with this one. I'd definitely recommend this DVD.",1457481600,,380,4.291666666666667

6505029,4,B00LTKTIUI,"As a beginner to aerobic dance, I thought that this video was fairly easy to follow and lots of fun. Some of the moves were less than to my liking (hey - to each their own), and occasionally Tracy Anderson would blurt out a mistake and then correct herself. Other than that, I thought this video was great and I have the sweat to prove it!",1454630400,2,339,4.151515151515151
6505030,2,B00LTKTIUI,"I'm sorry, I love Tracy Anderson, she's one the greatest instructors but this video was boring specially the music",1454457600,,114,5.052631578947368
6505031,5,B00LTKTIUI,Bought the hip hop party and this. Hip hop party was way too much to learn beforehand. Too intense. Tracy made it simple! Started with one move and on to the next. I feel a definite increase in heart rate. I think I will try more Tracy videos as this is my first and I am impressed. I have only done the 1st 2 dances so far. I am trying to perfect the easier ones before I move one.,1454198400,3,382,3.848101265822785

6505053,4,B00LTKTIUI,"If you  are like me and decided to explore at home fitness videos where you  can work out in the comfort  of your  own home,  I'd  recommend  this.

Now to be fair the music isn't  the greatest and yes tracy does appear  to be lost in moments  .

With that said I credit  this diet  for getting  me back interested  in working  out. Most of  the moves Tracy does are simple but  as she says the amount  of energy  you  put into the dance matters a lot for how effective  it will be .

For a person like me with bad knees if you  follow  along with  Tracy and modify the workout to fit within  your  capabilities  but still give 100% to your  movements you'll  be great.
My very first workout was slow and a little  confusing  as  I experienced  a very light sweat and my body felt good after.

I just finished  the first half of my third workout with the same sequencephalitis and I was dripping  sweat and felt great.

This dvd won't  satisfy you  forever but is a great place  to cut your  teeth on a 15 minute  workout  sequence",1453507200,,1031,4.108808290155441

It's like she didn't even run through it herself first and she's looking off camera for cues. We should've had her instructor on screen! She doesn't know left from right, it's constantly changing.

I did the first 15 min routine this morning and plan on doing more after work. It was pretty easy to follow along and definitely had me sweating by the end. I like her attitude and she keeps you going :) I plan on doing more than 15 minutes at a time though as I need to do more to lose weight :) Great beginners DVD!,1451865600,2,440,3.7934782608695654
6505057,5,B00LTKTIUI,"I actually use the workouts on this DVD as a warm up to other higher intensity Tracy cardio, such as her Teen Meta or her original Cardio Dance DVD. I discovered it's a lot easier to do those workouts well, and keep shin splints away, if you're nice and warm. By themselves they are far too easy for someone who's used to Tracy and in shape - if all 4 workouts were like the fourth workout on this DVD, then that would be more up my alley.

The setting is dark, music is blah but the worst part...she is a terrible instructor. For example, She only gives directions for the arms...says ""punch"" but fails to mention she wants you to hop....her association with A Listers is certainly not the result of this tape.

This also did nothing to get my heart rate up, and I am by no means in good shape. I'm frankly amazed that any workout would fail to get me out of breath, but this one did.",1437091200,,398,4.1688311688311686

6505082,5,B00LTKTIUI,"I have done this video about 10 times, starting with the first two 15 minute segments and then working up to the last two.  I used to do the 30 day boot camp cardio religiously.  I found the style on boot camp to be so much more fun and simple than in her metamorphosis cardio (which has more complicated, rotation specific movements for me) but it's very poorly produced; uneven sides, miscounting, no direction, plus having to stop and replay were all annoying.  This video is like the boot camp one remade beautifully with more added, of course.
60 minutes but in 15 minutes segments, so you master the sequencing in one or two and add on.  Although they are perhaps progressively harder as they go along, each one is still fun.  It is a good start for beginners but still a decent workout for veterans.  If you can keep up with metamorphosis well, this may be too easy for you.  Still a good one to keep on hand as she delves a little into certain classic moves' rotations, plus if you are having a day you want something lighter than normal, this will do.
Who this video is not for: those who are already put off by her teaching style.  I get that she is not for everyone and, while she is more detailed and better with cues in this video, it's still Tracy and  will still not work for those who get bored by the typical Tracy Anderson music and non-chattiness.  I personally like it. The moves are awkward at first but after like two or three run-throughs, I'm always glad she does not ramble on and on too much or get too peppy.
*The things that makes this video really stand out for me:
 1. The segments which lend flexibility. You can stop if you get tired or keep going really easily.
2. Better detail with instruction than previous vids
3. The sequences are repetitive enough to get the hang of but not just an ongoing loop of the same movements ad nauseum.
4.  This video feels easier on the joints than the others.
5. The movements and instruction feel like a cardio dance class at any gym.  In previous vids, the movements were sometimes more awkward for me or too cheesy and dance-y (like a wannabe cheerleader or dancer) and I would only do them when home alone.

6505083,5,B00LTKTIUI,"I have been doing Tracy's workouts for years, off and on, and I really like this cardio dance DVD to change up my 30 minutes of daily cardio!  It is really easy to follow and she takes you through a little routine step by step in each of the 15 minute workouts (there are four 15 min workouts - so you can do 15minutes if you don't have much time, or 30 or 45 for a longer workout).  I started out doing her cardio that is with the Metamorphosis and it is more bouncing around than the first 2 segments of this video, but by workouts 3 and 4 you are really bouncing around and breaking a sweat!  I did this DVD with my sister, who has never done Tracy's workouts, and she could follow along pretty well.  It is a great intro cardio for those new to Tracy's program, and a good DVD to mix it up if you already follow her!",1435536000,5,820,4.012269938650307
6505084,5,B00LTKTIUI,"This is a great video workout. I am 47 and have tried to find a workout to help with the lumps and bums without success until this one. I have lost a little weight but most importantly have lost inches, 8 in 2 months. So the good stuff first. As other reviewers have mentioned there is no bulking up just long lean muscles. I saw a difference after a couple of weeks. The videos are fun and she is positive and encouraging. I loved jazz dance as a child and this video is like an adult version of that. She also does a good job of explaining the more difficult moves. The video is divided into four 15 minute workouts. I usually do 30 minutes a day 5-6 days a week and alternate which ones I do. And I love it. I actually enjoy working out which was not the case with a gym, an elliptical and the metabolic workout.
The bad stuff is what others have mentioned. She does not reverse her movements to sync with yours. So she says left but it's her left not yours. I  just ignore the directions and do what she is doing.
I highly recommend this.",1433635200,5,1042,4.1330049261083746
6505085,4,B00LTKTIUI,If you are a beginner this is perfect. It gets you moving and Tracy talks you through the whole way. If you are intermediate level I would suggest maybe looking into Teen Meta (not just for teens) if you are interested in a great TAM dance cardio dvd.,1433289600,,251,4.25
6505086,4,B00LTKTIUI,"Finally a T.A. dance cardio I can follow along with and actually learn! Horray!
It is divided into 4 / 15 minute segments and she gets you going right away and for the full 15 minutes. The first segment is the only one with an extended introduction which is one that covers the entire DVD. The rest she just introduces herself and gives a few tips -- very short. It is odd she introduces herself, but it's cute too. :)
Major bonus: she gives instructions and cues! Yay!! So you know what is coming up.

Great cardio burn. I average 400-500 calories burned when I do the entire DVD.

I give this 4 stars because the music leaves much to be desired, which is generally the case with most fitness DVDs. Once I learned the flow and the routines, I created my own playlist and follow along with that.",1432598400,13,795,4.328859060402684

6505092,4,B00LTKTIUI,"I admit that I was one of the few who actually liked her first dance dvd but it took me over a month to get where I could actually follow it and some songs I was never able to get quite right.  Several years have pasted and several pounds have come and there is no way I could even begin to do that dvd now.  When I saw this on instant I thought it might be perfect for where I am now and it is.  Although I have only done the first ""dance"", I can already tell I will be happy with this purchase.  It was easy enough that I could get a workout doing it the first time but not so easy that I will be bored with it by the fourth time.  Since I am just getting back into exercising after a long illness I am using this as an add on to easier dvd like Leslie Sanson.  Today I did ""3 ""miles"" with Leslie and then did the first routine on this one and cool down with her standing abs and arm routine from the first mat dvd.  After a couple of weeks I will add a second routine and shorten the ""easier"" dvd time until I work up to 45 - 60 minutes of pure Tracy.  So in summary, if you like Tracy's matt workouts and her method/style but have been turned off by her cardio because they were too hard to follow then this is the dvd you have been wanting her to made.",1428278400,14,1257,3.8262548262548264

6505098,3,B00LTKTIUI,"I'm a huge fan of dance related cardio activities.  If you have to work out, it might as be something you enjoy.  Since I can't always make it to the gym in time for the classes, I figured I'd give this video a go.  While it's fun and informative, I did find the sequencing to be a bit confusing.  In the classes I've taken in the past, they've always had you start with one move and progressively add more to the end until you have the routine memorized.  Simple as that.

In this dvd, however, Tracy randomly adds new sequences, whether it's towards the beginning, middle or end.  This throws me off since I'm ready for the next move, but it ends up being something entirely different.  I ended up stopping a lot and restarting, which I personally think takes away from the exercise.

Overall, I like it and am sure I'll get use to the routine the more I do it.  I just wish this was more structured and not all over the place.",1427155200,,929,4.257142857142857

After spending a lot of time and money on other workout DVDs, I'm glad I found one that I actually enjoy! Even though the different segments are 15 minutes, you still get a great workout. Right now I'm still on the first segment- which is a basic body workout.

By no means am I an expert on exercise/weight loss, but I've been working out with this, combined with low-fat eating for maybe a little over a month- it has definitely made a difference. I would highly recommend to anyone who is a beginner to exercise wanting to be fit.",1426550400,2,688,4.375

That is why I love this DVD, it guides you through the steps; are broken into 4 different routines at 15 minutes a piece so you can piece together a routine or two depending on how much time you have; each routine gets harder as you go along; and finally it makes working out fun!

She builds upon each dance so that by the end of each 15 minute segment you are doing a small routine. She is not good at cueing, but following along does get easier as you repeat the workouts. If you are looking for something to help you build toward her more advanced DVDs, then this is a good place to start.

6505111,2,B00LTKTIUI,"I am a fan of Tracy's strength training methods, but this cardio is not for me.  I'm the kind of person who believes that if I'm going to take the time to do cardio, I want to be drenched in sweat at the end and this just doesn't do it.  You can honestly have the same workout on your own by marching, jumping around and occasionally raising your arms in the air.  My heart rate stays fairly constant throughout this which I don't care for.  Dance cardio is one of my favorites and I enjoy the lighthearted nature, but this goes into the realm of ridiculous.  Tracy is not a fan of running and has stated that her cardio works in conjunction with her other methods and to follow it or you'll ruin your progress.  I can't see the reason why during these random dance moves which she can't even keep straight or direct very well.  You need a lot of room (a confined space will only make it harder) and if you have knee or ankle problems you will probably have to pass.  I would recommend getting your cardio from elsewhere or just having a good ol' dance party for at least 30 minutes, do her strength portions and do not follow her diet/nutrition guide because it severely restricts calories.  That will give you results but in a highly unhealthy way that will not be reasonable to maintain.  I was really hoping for more guidance on my road to weight loss and overall better health.",1422230400,3,1382,4.36328125
6505112,3,B00LTKTIUI,"I really enjoy Tracy's advice and direction on just about everything, but I found this DVD to be strangely awkward unfortunately.

For someone who used to be a dancer, the ""dance moves"" are more of standard, boring, 90s aerobics moves.  She tries to spice it up with some fancy arms or a little hip, but it feels silly and unnatural.  My husband was in the room when I tried one of the 15 minute segments and I was embarrassed doing it in front of him.  Definitely pass on this one.",1422144000,4,501,4.276595744680851

As a person who has taken a lot of dance in the past, I didn't find the moves hard to follow but Tracy Anderson is not a great teacher. She constantly gets her left and right mixed up and she doesn't transition the audience smoothly from one move to the next.",1421625600,,328,4.140625
6505118,4,B00LTKTIUI,"I have been a big fan of Tracy Anderson for over a year now. I love all her workouts but I really LOVE about this one is that it is a *tad* easier than her regular cardio DVDs like the ones that come with Metamorphosis or her Continuity series. By easier I mean, I am can do 45 minutes to a full hour of this DVD whereas her other cardio workouts leave me exhausted after just 30 minutes.

What I love about all her cardio DVDs is that they are exclusively cardio-- no weights, no strength training. Just heart pumping dancing. I like to do heavy strength straining (Bob Harper DVDs) alternated with cardio every other day. But those kind of DVDs are getting harder and harder to find. Most workout DVDs that are supposedly cardio add in lots of strength training as well but I am trying to give those muscles a break on my ""off"" days.

I would have given this 5 stars but for heaven's sake, I wish Tracy would just learn to say ""left side"" when in reality SHE is doing the right side but since it's a mirror image to us it would be our actual side. In other words, when she says ""left side"" you have to reverse it in your brain and do YOUR right side. Is that a big deal? No, but I do think she should cater to her DVD audience who is obviously doing the moves mirror image to her moves.",1421625600,18,1288,4.127490039840637

I had previously purchased the Tracy Anderson Dance Cardio workout but felt the steps were pretty complicated and I struggled to follow them.  This workout is so easy to follow and it's fun! I have to get up at 5:30 am in order to fit it in before going to work, but I enjoy it so it definitely makes getting out of bed a lot easier.

""... Okay, I guess you can't."" I could pretty much keep up with this the first time I did it and I just completed it for the second time.
