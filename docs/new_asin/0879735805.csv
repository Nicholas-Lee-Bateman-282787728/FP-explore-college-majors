7793337,5,0879735805,"""A Walk Through the Mass,"" produced in 1999, is such a great teaching resource that I'm surprised Our Sunday Visitor hasn't made it available as a CD or an on-line video.  Narrated by Cardinal Donald Wuerl (who at the time was the Bishop of Pittsburgh) and filmed almost entirely in Pittsburgh's Cathedral of Saint Paul, this video runs about 50 minutes and is divided into five parts: theology of the mass, elements of the mass, liturgy of the word, liturgy of the eucharist, and effect of the mass in our lives.  It mostly cuts back and forth between a talking-head shot of Cardinal Wuerl standing in the nave of Saint Paul's and relevant video of a mass in progress, stained-glass windows, and (in part two) the items being discussed.  It's very professional and easy to watch.

Cardinal Wuerl conveys perfectly both the solemnity of the mass and the excitement of the opportunity it offers us.  He also conveys a great deal of information, while always bringing the subject back to the spiritual significance of what he's explaining.  This video is therefore educational on several levels, making it helpful for both new Catholics and lifelong worshipers.",1368835200,2,1159,4.917948717948718
