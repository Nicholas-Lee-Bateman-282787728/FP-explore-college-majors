8079501,5,B000ASAU0C,"You really have to be a residents fan to love this show, as there are many slow parts. Its not my favorite tour, but I think its very creative and interesting the way they used stories from the bible and points of view from certain characters.",1454544000,,243,4.304347826086956

8079503,5,B000ASAU0C,The Residents are not for everybody. That said this is a great show the sound was great the video was great and I enjoyed every second of the show. Some might find offence in the subject matter if you didn't have an open mind. This is a DVD worth having. I hope they release something in the future.,1377734400,2,299,4.172413793103448
8079504,5,B000ASAU0C,"Thank You,Residents,for stripping all the BS away from Judeo-Christian religious myth. This video exposes for all to see the stupidity and ridiculousness of the Bible and it's pet stories. It's about time.
The only (minor) objection I have is that sometimes the singer's voice is so grating and strained that it detracts from the performance and message.
A better singer,or the same one with a rested voice would've been better,IMHO. But no matter,this concert video should be seen by everyone.
It counters the blatherings of Christian evangelists,the Religious Right,The Pope,etc. I wish the Residents would do the same to Islam.",1234915200,2,630,5.31
8079505,5,B000ASAU0C,"Nothing like Bible stories composed and performed by The Residents. Just keep in mind that these aren't the happy stories. Clevery crafted, this concert contains songs set to murder, rape, sodomy, circumcision, dismembered body parts & more! The show is narrated by the odd and sometimes neurotic Mr. Skull. From Genesis to Judas this show is one of my favorites. The only downside is that the original recording was from a webcast, so the quality isn't the greatest and that there isn't much for easter eggs. Thank Jebus that the music quality and performance makes up for it.",1163462400,11,577,4.8979591836734695
