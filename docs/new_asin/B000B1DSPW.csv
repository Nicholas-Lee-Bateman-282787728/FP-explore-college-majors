8081262,4,B000B1DSPW,"This series is both funny and sad at times, which makes for the Kdrama we all love.  Kim Rae Won never disappoints, and the co-stars do a satisfactory job.  Although it wouldn't rank as one of my all-time favorites, it's a decent production, and the actors make the most of the material they were given.  Overall, it's a series the family could watch together and enjoy.",1374451200,,370,4.575757575757576
8081263,3,B000B1DSPW,"I've seen 3 ugly-duckling-type tv series from South Korea. My favorite (and one of my favorite tv shows ever) is&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/COFFEE-PRINCE/dp/B0011Z1T4Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">COFFEE PRINCE</a>, followed by&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/MY-LOVELY-SAM-SOON/dp/B000BLAK76/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">MY LOVELY SAM SOON</a>. This one falls into third place probably cuz I've seen only three (I'm not counting&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/ONE-FINE-DAY/dp/B0017WE4EI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">ONE FINE DAY</a>&nbsp;cuz I didn't watch it all).

Not that it's bad. It maintained, for me, a certain level of interest. And it clipped along at a good pace - but thats probably cuz its had to fit within 10 episodes - while the others typically stretch out to 16 or so. For that reason it might be considered a quick intro to the Korean romantic formula with its love quadrangle - including someone from a rich family - and someone with a terminal or deadly health problem that barely seems to affect the afflicted one's lifestyle.

This one takes an old Korean cinderella-like fairytale involving the nasty Patzzi and virtuous Hongji and turns it on its ear. While this Patzzi is still crude and blunt, her actions can be justified in view of the treatment she receives from the duplicitous Hongji. She becomes the sympathetic and central character.

The actual character names are Song Yi (the Patzzi) and Hee Won (the Hongji) played by tiny Jang Na Ra and pretty Hong Eun Hee respectively (here's your chance to get used to non-Western names). The setting is - fittingly - an amusement park with its fairytale elements.

It's easy to believe that the Patzzi here would have a troubled love-life -- and that it would take an impossibly warm and understanding soul to fall for her. That character -- who is also the rich one -- is really too bland to have been a challenge for baby-faced actor Kim Jae Won. Tall, hulking Kim Rae Won (notice: that's a different name) has the meatier role as the moody, not-rich, medically-challenged seal trainer.

However, the female villainess is a villain for no known reason. And that's a surprise. Most Korean dramas are fair to the ""other"" woman (or man), developing their motives more fully. Even making them sympathetic. That, in a nutshell, could be what's wrong with this series - there's less character development here than is typical in Korean storytelling. And maybe Jang Na Ra as the Patzzi could have been less stereotypically uncouth.

BTW, that Jang Na Ra singing the cute, bubbly theme song. She's a successful pop singer, too.",1277337600,3,2727,5.639024390243902
8081264,5,B000B1DSPW,"My Love Patzzi was the second Korean drama I ever watched. It's been years since I first saw it, but when I found it on amazon I remembered how much I enjoyed it and decided to buy it. After all these years I still enjoy it. It's a cute story.

I personally really enjoyed Jang Na-Ra's character in this show. She was tough, but clearly had feelings and wasn't cold and detatched the way a lot of tough girls are usually portrayed. Plus, she quite obviously wasn't perfect which makes the character feel so much more realistic.

You won't get any life alterting philosophical lessons from this show, but as I said before it's a cute story and the main characters are fun to watch.",1248220800,5,680,4.432
8081265,2,B000B1DSPW,"My Love Patzzi is a short, ten-episode television drama about an unlikely pairing of two people looking for love who become good friends instead, but discover that love was right next to them all along. This drama is an incongruous mix of adult treachery with a love story the level of an innocent nave adolescent romance. My Love Patzzi is light fare, probably best for fans of Korean pop culture, but is a passably cute drama for the rest of us.",1129680000,5,447,4.530864197530864
