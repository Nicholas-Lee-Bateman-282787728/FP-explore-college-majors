8040924,5,B0006A9TDS,"A really good show by the WWE. I'm sure the novelty of interactive shows wore off after a few years, but this first attempt at it was very good. Not much to complain about as far as the card itself. Nothing too boring or skippable--maybe Eric vs. Eugene, but it was kept as brief as possible.

Best 2 bouts kept at the end of the show (obviously)--The World Title Match & Ric and Randy getting bloody in the cage. Divas on the card too, showing off their assets and you have a good deal. Nothing a fan could complain about...",1522713600,,525,4.25
