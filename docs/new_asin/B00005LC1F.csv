1621496,5,B00005LC1F,"Finally completed my collection of Fawlty Towers.  Best British comedy series since Monte Python.  Love John Cleese and the havoc he causes.  Great price, well packaged and arrived ahead of time.  A must have for comedy buffs.",1167868800,,226,5.027027027027027
1621497,5,B00005LC1F,"Sometimes the guests at Fawlty Towers are more trouble than they're worth.

Basil Fawlty finds that out the hard way in the second volume of ""Fawlty Towers,"" which is arguably the best comedy ever aired. And these classic episodes -- ""Gourmet Night,"" ""The Germans,"" and ""Communication"" -- are definitely some of the high points of this all-too-brief series.

Basil (John Cleese) and Sybil (Prunella Scales) are planning a ""Gourmet Night"" with the creme-de-la-creme of Torquay society. Unfortunately, the new cook has a crush on Manuel (Andrew Sachs); when the waiter rejects him, he gets drunk and passes out. Now Basil frantically tries to salvage the gourmet night, with no chef, a dying car and a roomful of increasingly peevish guests.

The ""Germans"" are coming! While Sybil recovers from surgery, Basil plans a fire drill, and arranges for a pair of German couples to stay at Fawlty Towers. But the fire drill goes horribly wrong, and Basil ends up hospitalized with a head injury. Undaunted, he heads back to his hotel to greet the Germans -- except he can't stop babbling about the war...

""Communications"" break down when an autocratic lady arrives at Fawlty Towers -- she's practically deaf, and isn't satisfied with anything. As if that weren't infuriating enough, she soon loses some money and insists that the staff must have taken it. Meanwhile, Basil gets a racing tip from a customer, and decides to bet ten pounds on the horses...

Anyone who's sick of the recycled sitcoms (""Hot Young Urbanites Fall In Love and Have Misadventures"") that pepper the TV landscape might want to try Fawlty Towers. The humour is still fresh after all these years, the writing is good, and the actors were great at physical comedy.

The dialogue is especially sharp in these episodes, especially when a confused Manuel tries to talk to the oblivious deaf woman: ""No no, 'que' what."" ""K Watt?"" ""Si!"" ""C.K. Watt?"" ""Yes!"" And as witty as the hilarious scripting is, the ""Germans"" episode wouldn't be the same if it weren't for Basil's bizarre behavior and rubber-legged Hitler walk.

Basil's social-climbing continues without much actual result. Partly it's because his bootlicking is so obvious, and partly because he's not very good at it (""How is your lovely daughter?"" ""She's dead""). And John Cleese seemed to be having lots of fun as the nastiest hotelier in the world. Sachs has some even funnier scenes as the hapless Spanish waiter Manuel, and Booth gets to be the ""normal"" one who tries to tone down the madness.

Fawlty Towers reaches its peak in the second volume, with the Germans, deaf harpies and a roast duck. Too bad the series was so short.",1139184000,4,2650,4.926008968609866
1621498,5,B00005LC1F,"Worth every penny! Hillarious comedy, dry english humor and enjoyed every episode. Too bad they have just 12 episodes. I would buy 1 million of them :)",1136332800,,151,4.62962962962963
1621499,5,B00005LC1F,"Fawlty Towers was the Doug Flutie of comedy series - a lot from a small package. This short-lived British series of only 12 episodes (I keep waiting for ""lost"" episodes, though I guess there aren't any) is such a consistently funny series one can't help but worry about losing control of bladder functions.
The Germans may be the cream of the crop from the series, with inspired performances from Cleese as a concussive twit who keeps accidentally mentioning the ""War"" in the midst of his German guests: replete with his famous Nazi walk (ala house of silly walks), a talking moose from Barcelona, a fire emergency and a spat with an ugly nurse.
Gourmet Night is another great episode which epitomizes the arrogant British spirit Cleese is poking fun at throughout the series. As he mentions in the included interview, the series is based on an actual innkeeper he and the other Pythons had the ill fortune to encounter in their travels.
I don't feel the other two episodes are quite as strong, but they still outclass almost all sitcoms besides maybe Seinfeld. The extras are well worthwhile - the interviews are recent and very interesting. They cover more than just the Fawlty Tower series, so they will be of interest to Python fans as well.
The sound and picture are an improvement over the BBC and PBS airings I recall, as well as my 15 year old VHS copies. No wonder.
Cheers.",1003622400,20,1382,4.691358024691358

1621501,5,B00005LC1F,"I love Fawlty Towers so much. I kid you not, if you watch this show a few dozen (or hundred) times, it gets funnier every time. The Psychiatrists and Communication Problems are two of my favorites. I actually own these on vhs, but one night my husband and I did not want to do the rewinding, fast forwarding, etc., etc., (how did we make it through the 80's?) to watch a couple of episodes. If you've ever worked with the public or in hospitality (I did catering and taught cooking for a number of years) and find people just a 'smidge' annoying, you'll identify with Basil Fawlty and how much he hates his guests! I live in S. California, and worked one Christmas at a large chain bookstore, now out of business, rhymes with Morder's. :) In the interview, the manager casually dropped that ""John Cleese sometimes comes in here to shop!"" Oh, yes I'll work here for your paltry wages. On vigilant watch every night, went through gallons of tooth whitener, but never got to 'just casually bump into him.' Anyway. People fall into 2 categories--those who find this extremely funny, and people who don't have a sense of humor.",1486684800,,1122,4.587064676616915

1621724,5,B00005LC1F,"Hands-down my favorite sitcom of all time!

Rather than paraphrase, I decided to simply copy a rather succinct synopsis of the show's plot from Wikipedia.
""
The series is set in Fawlty Towers, a fictional hotel in the seaside town of Torquay, on the ""English Riviera"". The plots centre around tense, rude and put-upon owner Basil Fawlty (Cleese), his bossy wife Sybil (Prunella Scales), a comparatively normal chambermaid Polly (Booth), and hapless Spanish waiter Manuel (Andrew Sachs), showing their attempts to run the hotel amidst farcical situations and an array of demanding and eccentric guests.

""
[...]

I watch these episodes over and over, never tiring of them.  The reasons I enjoy the show so much are two-fold.  First, the writing is very good.  The writers poke fun primarily at the English, making you laugh at their politeness, stoic nature and even racism.  It all plays out in a madcap comic style.(be forewarned, these were the days before political correctness).  If you have a soft spot in your heart for the British or even if you ever worked in a hotel or food service industries, I'm sure you'll get a laugh out of this series.
Second, I think all the actors were cast perfectly and are each excellent in their roles.  Actors with seeminly small ""bit"" recurring roles are often hilarious for the few seconds they appear and deliver their lines.  Their timing is superb and I often wonder how they get through the episodes without bursting into laughter.

It's a pity Cleese only made twelve episodes",1403481600,,1523,4.88715953307393
1621725,5,B00005LC1F,"In this episode, I thought I was going to have to call 911 for my dad who was having an almost coronary from laughing. He was convulsing in the chair.

It was written by John Cleese and Connie Booth, who pays Polly, and was based on a REAL hotel owner they had encountered.  What a prize he must have been.

1621757,5,B00005LC1F,"Great Britain rated this series as the best series ever on television.  That should say something.  Setting that aside, it is classified as a sitcom.  However, as most american sitcoms are written and filmed within a week or two, this series was written well over a year and each episode was painstakingly thought out.

John Cleese has said over and over that the thing he is most proud of is the amount of story packed into each episode.  Each episode runs like 28 minutes or so and was popularized in the U.S. when shown on PBS in the late 70's and early 80's.  If you have never seen an episode and you really enjoy clever comedy, you'll enjoy this series.  Obviously, if you love Monty Python you'll love this as well.

I can tell a lot about a person's sense of humor by what they think of this show.  If someone says ""I didn't like Fawlty Towers""  that simply means they have no sense of humor.  If you don't like this, you simply don't understand witty humor.  There's even some slapstick stuff thrown in for those of you with a less sophisticated palate for comedy although it really isn't slapstick...some of you will understand that, some may not.

If you liked Seinfeld, Community, Cheers, News Radio, Newhart and even the Dick Van Dyke Show you'll more than likely enjoy it as much as any of the aforementioned.  Personally, I agree that is is the best comedy series ever.  Keep in mind there are only somewhere around 13 episodes which explains why virtually every episode is considered a classic comedy episode.  There is a lot of subtle humor along with the more obvious stuff so sit back, pay attention, have some popcorn and enjoy a few giggles and shakes of the head while watching not a classic comedy series but THE classic comedy series of all time.

You will enjoy the madness that is Basil Fawlty. In the opening pay attention to the Inn's sign as in a few episodes the letters are rearranged to spell other things. So funny, I wish amazon would put ""Are You Being Served"" and ""Keeping Up Appearances"" on kindle prime. Also great British comedies.",1392163200,,432,4.4125

1621767,5,B00005LC1F,John Cleese is really in top form both as a writer (With Connie Booth) and a star in this classic comedy series.  The only disappointment was that they only made twelve episodes.,1391558400,,178,4.5625

Along with Manuel (bellhop et al) Basil gets into all sorts of riduculously funny situations - but they way he tries to get out of them is even funnier.

1621777,5,B00005LC1F,Fawlty Towers is one of my favorite shows. It is that British slapstick humor that keeps me watching it over and over! I spent a year in London studying and the show is true to form.,1390262400,,182,4.083333333333333
1621778,5,B00005LC1F,I've watched this before and could watch it again and again! It's the kind of humor that never gets old and forces you to laugh (and sometimes groan) out loud no matter how hard you try to keep it in!,1390089600,,200,4.025

1621783,5,B00005LC1F,"Oh I have been waiting for this review! My friends you now stand on the edge of the greatest farce ever written. This is the Rolls Royce of comedy. 5 stars is an insult as one does not rate the best, one simply sits back in awe and watches masters perform. Connie Booth, Ballard Barkley, Mr Sachs or Manuel~. And then Basil Fawlty. A character actually taken from John Cleese's life. His friends stayed next door at the real Glen Eagles and he stayed at a smaller more atmospheric flat across the street . There he met the owner. The inspiration for Basil. Thus the tale was born. Do yourselves a favor. Watch the best! This is it!",1389657600,,631,4.3559322033898304

1621797,5,B00005LC1F,I think Season 2 was even more entertaining than Season 1. I especially liked the Fawlty Towers sign being changed for ever episode! This is a well-developed comedy that does not rely on one-liners or innuendos. The characters are drawn large and don't disappoint.,1387756800,,264,5.0227272727272725
1621798,5,B00005LC1F,"An oldie but a goody.  John Cleese and the cast are seriously funny.  If you liked Season 1, you'll love Season 2.  The only bad thing is that there are so few episodes!",1387584000,,169,4.0606060606060606
1621799,5,B00005LC1F,"The only fault with ""Fawlty Towers"" is that it had only two brief seasons of TV life before moving onto the long-term rerun slots of PBS. Like all comedy series, ""Fawtly Towers"" has its flat moments, but they are so far and few between that it sometimes takes two or three viewings of an episode to find them. John Cleese heads a cast that is so perfectly matched to the situations that there's litlle need for ""star"" guest  appearances, though Geoffrey Palmer (""As Time Goes By"") is the ideal doctor in ""The Kipper and the Corpse,"" which may be one of five best episodes of TV comedy.",1387238400,,585,4.4672897196261685

Because the accents are very heavy I did watch it with the captions on and it made it more enjoyable because I knew I wasn't missing anything.

1621829,5,B00005LC1F,"I almost said it was one of the best Brit comedies, but then why limit it. John Cleese as the depressed, pretentious Basil Fawlty, was perfect.

One of my favorite scenes ever was when his car broke down. He stood there and yelled at it for awhile and then he walked off camera for a few seconds. When he came back, he had a huge branch with which he proceeded to smash on the hood of the car over and over again. The sheer insanity of that, plus many other wonderful scenes, had me on the floor laughing.

Even after all this time, I still love watching it, and only wish that the series had gone on longer than it did. John Cleese and his supporting cast were fantastic. I often find myself wondering what a reunion show would be like. Would Basil still be running Fawlty Towers, or would he be in a mental institution?  Or, would he have been murdered by his wife and/or his long-suffering employees? I guess we'll have to write our own scenario.",1376006400,,949,4.320224719101123

Basil (Cleese) and his wife run a small bed and breakfast with a wide array of memorable guests. In his usual absurdity-filled mannerism, normal operations become the most monumental of tasks.

My only regret, (and I mean only), is that there were only 12 episodes ever made. If ever there were a series which could be re-booted with the right cast, this is certainly deserving, so long as Mr. Cleese is at the helm.",1360454400,,494,4.666666666666667

Seriously all of the characters are the best! Loved Manuel! Its actually even funnier to realize that this show, hotel and characters are based on a real hotel and people! Apparently they were pretty ridiculous. I guess John Cleese and all of the Monty Python cast were at this hotel and it was ridiculous so Cleese made an hilarious show!
