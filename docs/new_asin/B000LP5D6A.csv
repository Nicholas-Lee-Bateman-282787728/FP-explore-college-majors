2711144,5,B000LP5D6A,"I purchased this video for my son.  I was surprised to see it arrived so quickly.  He was very pleased with the video, it arrived in great condition.  Loved it!",1285545600,3,160,4.266666666666667
2711145,5,B000LP5D6A,If you have a good sense of humor and can relate to slap stick comedy this will crack you up. Some of it is very clever. The humor and dialogue is nothing like any modern comedy which comedy these days is based on trying to make people laugh at political or celebrity people. You have have been around at least in the 50's and 60's to appreciate the Three Stooges. Of course no woman I ever knew liked them. Only the guys. I recommend this to the guys of the last generation.,1269216000,6,475,4.173913043478261
2711146,5,B000LP5D6A,A most excellent product.  Colorizing was great and the original black and white was virtually flawless.,1264982400,7,104,5.5
2711147,5,B000LP5D6A,"I am writing this review some time after purchasing it so I don't remember all that is on this disc, but I wanted to point out that serious Stooge fans, and collectors will want this just for the Larry Fine interview. I highly reccommend this disc.",1260489600,,248,4.413043478260869
2711148,4,B000LP5D6A,"If you're looking for the mayhem that the Stooges are famous for, you can't beat the chronological Sony releases.

But, if you're the type who like DVD extras, this is a good addition to your Stooges collection at the right price.  This is an extensive gathering of Stooges TV appearances and commercials that you probably wouldn't find anywhere else.  It also has several interviews, so you get to see the Stooges as themselves and not the knuckleheads they portray.

I enjoyed it enough to consider the other Legend Films Stooges releases.",1232668800,,541,4.912087912087912
2711149,5,B000LP5D6A,"One of the problems with loving the products of a bygone era is that the ""bygone era"" part so often becomes a limiting factor in your experience.  What I mean by this is that, particularly given early incarnations of media, time often destroys or degrades the material that we do have, leaving us with an unsatisfying and incomplete lexicon to enjoy.  Consider the Roman philosophers: we consider them great today, and that's with our possessing only a small fraction of their works.  Imagine what we'd think of them if we had a complete image.

So too it is with the Three Stooges, true-blue American philosophers whose extant performances are an incomplete picture of their greatness, until now.  The Three Stooges: Extreme Rarities is exactly as it sounds--a compilation of unique and interesting Stooge material that you've never seen before; ranging from shorts, to stage performances, to pilot episodes, to interviews, to classic commercials, etc...  As the marketing literature says, this is truly a must-own for any fan of the knuckleheads.

Did I neglect to mention that all of this is in full-color?  Has been re-mastered in the George-Lucas sense?  So, not only does this DVD present vintage material, but it does so in a completely accessible and really unique way.",1227657600,10,1277,5.042857142857143
2711150,4,B000LP5D6A,"I freely admit that I am big-time fan of The Three Stooges. The first time I ever saw them I was six years old, and that was in a theater seeing Larry, Moe and Shemp in a brand new film in 1954! Of course, a few years later I was introduced to Joe Besser in one of their last short subjects. Finally, in 1959 I saw Curly for the first time in the television releases of their classic films of the 1930s and 1940s. Nearly all my life I have enjoyed their comedy.

Anyway, I'll get to the point! ""The Three Stooges: Extreme Rarities"" is an amazing collection of tidbits the Stooge fan will enjoy. First, and foremost, we get to see a pretty good reproduction of the wonderful 1948 comedy, ""Heavenly Daze."" That alone is worth the price of the DVD. However, there is a lot more. Stuff about Stooge merchandise, rare TV appearances, and best of all, an incredibly candid interview with Larry Fine after Larry had suffered his stroke. Larry compares Curly and Shemp in the act and manages to praise both brothers Howard while truthfully explaining how well they worked in the act. Clearly, Larry respected Shemp's talent, but most definitely felt in awe of Curly's genius. He is not exactly disrespectful of Moe, but one gets the feeling there had been something of a rocky relationship between them over the years. Seeing and hearing Larry talk about these and other topics was wonderful. I only wish there was more than one interview. It is a shame that we don't have interviews with Curly or Shemp. To the best of my knowledge, I don't think any filmed interviews with those great comics have turned up over these many decades.

Anyway, several other reviewers went into better detail than I have about the many delightful features on this DVD. I simply wanted to emphasize that it is truly worth it to get ""Heavenly Daze"" and the Larry Fine interview. Keep in mind there is much more on the disc. The DVD is well worth the price! I urge fans of ""The Six Stooges"" to purchase this entertaining and informative offering.",1216166400,6,2017,4.553719008264463
2711151,3,B000LP5D6A,This was worth while for a Stooges fan. Lots of Curly Joe Dorita since he was the last new stooge in the TV era. Commercials and TV appearances abound.,1211414400,2,151,4.241379310344827
2711152,5,B000LP5D6A,"In addition to the excellent reviews below I just wanted to ad that any duplication of material here from previous Goodtimes & Anchor Bay DVD releases is superior to the earlied versions.  Genius Entertainment has taken the time to do some computer clean up.

Most noticable clean up is in the Screen Snapshots short, only the Stooges footage has been cleaned up & colorized, it jumps back to a scratchy B&W picture for all non-stooge segments.  I wish they did it all one way.  This could be an indication that Genius was only going to include the Stooges footage but decided to put the complete short in at the last minute.  It is better to see it complete as Good Times only used the Stooges footage un-restored.

Unlike some of their other DVDs, this one is colorized or B&W only and not offered in both versions (except for Heavenly Daze) but you can always turn down the color on your TV.",1177891200,19,894,4.521739130434782
2711153,5,B000LP5D6A,"First off I must say that this is worth buying for a rare short called ""Heavenly Daze"" which for some reason has been left off of any of the official dvds from sony and is considered a verey memorable shortwhere Shemp dies and becomes a ghost,it's presented in both color and b&w,the rest of the dvd had some very rare stuff not seen on any of the past ""Goodtime"" dvd's,some colorized some not,curly is only in it briefly,it's mostly larry moe and curly joe,again the latter ones from the 60's aren't colorized  because they were filmd that way,now I must say that I was thrilled to see a Joe Besser interview since that time period has always been ignored,also for the most part the interviews and t.v. appearances are complete,with the exception of the danny thomas show,the bonus featues were kind of odd,basically half of it was just excerts from the ""Three Stooges story"" released by ""Goodtimes"" video,the other half of the bomus features consists of unedited interviews and commercials,which is neat to see,I suggest you buy the box set...",1176508800,16,1045,4.805555555555555

2711173,5,B000LP5D6A,"I bought this for my husband as he is a huge Three Stooges fan. We both had a fabulous time watching these shorts and some hard to find footage as well. Also must mention that the colorization was very impressive and well done! The Stooges are famous for their silly and slapstick comedy, so if you are looking for some fun after a hard day's work or caring for your kids all day--here is a great DVD to relax and enjoy! And the kids can watch too!",1396224000,,448,4.160919540229885
2711179,3,B000LP5D6A,".... the early part depicting the early history of the Stooges was pretty good with details and old photos.  The horse bit with a few seconds of Stooges interspersed just a content-filler. Heavenly Daze must not be that rare since I was repeating dialog (""I'm convinced"" and ""You don't know the half of it!"") before they were uttered - I saw this one when I was a kid 45 years ago.  Overall only for mega-fans looking for any tidbit they might have missed.",1388880000,,456,4.481927710843373

2711186,1,B000LP5D6A,"Guess you'd have to be an extreme Stooges fan to enjoy this. I didn't. Just a few minutes of behind-the-scenes stuff and a lot of very poor (and colorized) material. A few laughs, but not worth the time.",1354406400,,203,4.368421052631579
2711187,5,B000LP5D6A,"I bought this for a Father's Day gift from my son to his Daddy. My son has recently been introduced to the Three Stooges, and it's a great show for the both of them. The DVD is not grainy, like with some remastered videos. The episodes are great, and they both laugh at every episode.",1341532800,,284,4.181818181818182
2711188,2,B000LP5D6A,"There was a skit with horse racing, which was colorized, but not actually the famous short.  Snipits of that were interspersed with a lot of black and white footage.  What got me to buy was the picture on the front, which was of their classic golfing short, one of the best they've ever done.  They colorized the picture, making me think that the short would be in the program, but it wasn't.  That's bait and switch, folks, and I wouldn't recommend this DVD to even the most rabid of colorization fans, for after watching this, they will feel that there is a large ""SUCKER"" sign that was just placed on their forehead.",1328140800,11,619,4.5
8162583,5,B000LP5D6A,Excellent an otherwise unobtainable clips. Don't pass on this one. The audience participation in the Danny Thomas segment was priceless. The Stooges were a hard working bunch.,1526947200,,175,5.518518518518518

Some TV ads starring the Stooges were shown that I'd never seen before. I wish they had shown more skits with Curly, I think he was the funniest Stooge.
