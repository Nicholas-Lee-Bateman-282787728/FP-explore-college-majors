8445356,5,B004WMOSJ6,"ITN are one of the best channels to produce royal DVDs.  My only comment is that Trevor Mac Donald is the better narrator  for this

The channel includes The Engagement interview & that's VERY unique to watch",1335312000,2,208,4.5675675675675675
8445357,1,B004WMOSJ6,"I received this edition yesterday and had ordered it as I incorrectly thought that this  title produced by ITN might provide an addition to the BBC version I had already received. I could not have been more incorrect in that assumption.

This version is almost unrecognizable to the occasion I will now make sure I do not delete from my DVR.  When one watches these Royal weddings as I have for many years, one of the many things that always stand out is the glorious music, making these occasions truly thrilling and memorable.  This version provides its own ""background"" music, over which a ""plumy voiced"" female commentator gives scant and even incorrect information as to what we are seeing.  When William and Harry stop to chat and greet the Spencer family as they enter the lantern in  the Abbey, the commentator decribes then as ""greeting some friends"", when she earlier  identifies Earl Spencer entering the church. The music from the actual service is about 1/2 minute of the processional, ""I was Glad"", the stirring  coronation hymn at the very end of Catherine's walk up the aisle and it was not synchronized as it actually happened.  There were 2 choirs, one orchestra, the mighty Abbey organ, and two groups of military trumpeters. Enough musical power to stir anyone's soul!  All these were ignored. There were three hymns sung by the congregation and choirs and only ""Jerusalem"", was shown. They even skipped the National Anthem. Only a tiny part of the choral ""amen"" gave any clue that the choirs were as always, wonderful. The final insult came during the recessional, ""Crown Imperial"" by William Walton was actually played but NOT on this DVD. ITN inserted some sort of orchestral ""march"" that I have never heard before.  It actually sounded like ""movie music"". No relation to reality AT ALL!

Do not waste your money on this version--the BBC DVD is by far the only one to consider.  I have that and will also keep my DVR of the actual footage! Ten years from now, when someone wants to see what William and Catherines'wedding day was like, I hope they don't happen to see this version--ITN should pull this--it is deceptive and untrue. A shameful depiction and I am returning it.",1309651200,22,2198,4.798408488063661
