I always doubted that this series would ever see a US release and it's because the series is absolutely riddled with Japanese cultural references (pop and historical), Japanese puns and Japanese word play.  When I say riddled, I mean dozens of times per episode.  Most episode themes in general are built around these references.

I was excited to see how Nozomi Entertainment handled this, however I was quickly disappointed by the fact that they essentially didn't.  This is even true in the subtitles.  As opposed to translating all of these references, puns and wordplay that are so inexorably Japanese, they just ignored almost all of them.  I don't mean they made new puns or jokes, they simply translated over them as if they never existed.  They gut the script and the story and replace it with a faint impression of what the series once was.  In a few minor examples, they did attempt to translate a joke (but just barely).

The first is.. in the original Japanese, Kazuma spends an entire episode confused by what a croissant is.  In Japanese it's phonetically pronounced kurowassan.  Kazuma hears this and thinks Kurowa-san, which is a Japanese surname plus -San (basically their equivalent of Mr.).  He thinks it's a guy named Mr. Kurowa and calls up all of his family members trying to find this man before realizing it was a type of bread.  In the English language version, he heads croissant and somehow thinks he heard Clauss Swann.  How this mistake is made is never explained and they don't even sound similar.  In japanese the two words sound the same making Kazuma seem naive and unlearned.  In English it just makes him look like a boob or at least hard of hearing.

Another example of them actually attempting a joke is in episode 4.  They have to feed their bread to a horse.  When the horse eats the bread in japanese, it leaps into the air and make a very horse-like neigh that sounds like umai (oooo-mmaaaaay, rhyming with neigh).  This is funny because the Japanese word for horse is uma while the word for good/delicious horse is umai.  So it sounds like a horse noise couple with him basically saying it's really yummy, but done in a manner that it doesn't sound like he's speaking.  Just a horse noise with a clever little pun.  In English, the horse eats the bread and says ""Good Grazing!""  I don't even understand this.  It makes no sense.  If they're going to be this lazy and not even make a real joke, they may as well not even translate any of the jokes and make it Iron Chef Bread Edition.

Anyway, most of the in-jokes don't even get a half hearted attempt.  It's just disappointing to see such a fun and Japanese-centric series get ruined by a failure of a translation.  I can't recommend this set less.  Try to find an oldee non-Nozomi translation with the jokes actually in the show.",1473206400,,2932,4.62015503875969
8693336,4,B00QYZJ85I,"Azuma Kazuma has a dream - to make a bread that will represent Japan itself and replace rice as a breakfast staple. In order to help achieve his dream, he wants to get a job at Pantasia, a world famous bakery. But the path to JaPAN (pun used extensively in the series, 'pan' being the Japanese word for bread) is not going to be easy!

I saw this series years ago and still remember it with great fondness. The baking battles can get pretty ridiculous and the taster's reaction to the bread often hilarious. It generally transports them to an exotic local, such as in one case, Heaven. The characters are fun and Azuma likable, though not very bright. But who needs smarts with his skills?

If you enjoy baking, it is fun to see the different techniques used and laugh at the seriousness baking is treated with. If you don't enjoy baking, then... you can still enjoy the same things.

Yakitate is 69 episodes in total and this set contains the first season (27 episodes).

Ahh, I can't wait to watch it all again on DVD!",1427241600,,1020,4.438502673796791
8693337,5,B00QYZJ85I,"This is, in my opinion, one of the greatest anime's ever, right up there with Fullmetal Alchemist. (though nothing like FMA, except the humor elements). It's very underrated, and it's sad that not alot of people have heard of it. You hear that the show is about baking bread, and you think, how boring, right? That was my first thought too, and when I was told about it, I resisted watching for a long time. But when I finally gave in, I was pleasantly surprised. While it starts off a little more down to earth, as it goes on, it gets more hilarious with out of control reactions to how good the bread is. If you like comedy, you will love this show!",1421884800,3,651,4.300813008130081
