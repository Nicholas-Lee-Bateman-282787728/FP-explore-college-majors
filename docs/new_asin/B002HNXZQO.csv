8370415,5,B002HNXZQO,"Would you go snow skiing if you were blind?  Would you take piano lessons if you were blind.  Dr. Peter Jepson Young did.  This Canadian physician created a video journal that was broadcast.  This profoundly moving documentary about a young doctor who contracted AIDS introduces you a remarkable man who did not give up, who explained the changes he experienced and who thus allowed others to understand the ""gay cancer"" that triggered fear among so many.  The creators of this film took footage from his short video excerpts that were broadcast on Canadian tv.  By the end the viewer cannot help but feel that this was an extraordinary man who was loving and compassionate.  Too soon he was gone and...you will miss him yourself.",1447200000,,730,4.838709677419355
