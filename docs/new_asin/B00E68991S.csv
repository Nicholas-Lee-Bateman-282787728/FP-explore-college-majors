5892396,5,B00E68991S,I loved this anime since I first saw it on Toonami and was sad when they took it off knowing that there were a whole lot more episodes left to dub/air. The US never got to the hundreds like Canada but now US fans have a chance to own the the whole dubbed version of the series (104 episodes) and hopefully one day in the future the remainder of the show will be dubbed and released in the english.,1375401600,17,397,4.037974683544304

5892420,5,B00E68991S,"Zatch Bell is awesome, I bought this as soon as I was able to.

One cool thing I hope eventually happens is that they release the 4 dubbed season 3 episodes as a bonus disc or something separate from this. 101-104

I really really like this series, it has everything you could possibly want out of an anime. The battles are excellently done and they showcase a heartwarming friendship between the protags.
The voice work is just about perfect, expect a majority of secondary characters to be voiced by Crispin Freeman and Michelle Ruff.

If anyone's curious about the aspect ratio listed as 1.77:1; the actual episodes are 4:3 but other content on the DVD like the menu and the intro animation is widescreen.",1392336000,3,708,4.693548387096774
5892421,2,B00E68991S,"First of all, I first learned of this anime back when I had cable tv and some local anime fan site aired one episode and I was instantly hooked.  Following that I picked up two discs from SF Chinatown with the original japanese audio that must've aired on TV in China/HK and had horrrible English subtitle translations.  However, I did see a full set for a hundred dollars once in a Chinatown store, but didn't want to shell out that kind of money for Chinese copy junk.  Looking back I should've gotten it since the japanese audio was present and I can get by listening to it despite the nonsensical english translations by idiots who need to be flogged to death for mangling the English language.  This current Zatch Bell Collection will only satisfy mono-lingual English speaking fans as true anime fans need to hear the original Japanese dub while sometimes reading a great English subtitle translation because the dialogue in the original Japanese is fantastic for anyone who understands it as there are terms that aren't translatable to English without losing reference in Japanese culture.  Piggybacking on other folks' review, I'm disappointed the discs are either blue or red and not decorated with art of the series.  I hope and pray someday, the original Japanese company that created the series will honor fans and put out the complete 150 episode series in dvd or blu ray with both English and Japanese dubs and translations somehow.  I know I'd be willing to pay a lot for that!!!  Btw, this Zatch Bell Collection doesn't seem to have subtitles viewable on the dvd player but rather (CC) closed captions will come up if you turn it on the TV via the remote.  Coincidentally, I'm watching this during the year of the Horse and chanting ""Meru meru me!"" so maybe this act will bring me luck during this new year!",1391126400,3,1823,4.725552050473186
5892422,5,B00E68991S,"It's a must have old school classic. Zatch Bell delivers drama, comedy and action at the same time buy it!!!!!",1388793600,,110,4.55
5892423,3,B00E68991S,"Don't misunderstand my title , the series is great but for the price I was disappointed. For this price I expected a really nice job with the packaging , 6 discs in each case crammed into a holder , this series deserved a better treatment , no episode guide , no extras and only the English language dub. Season one discs have a plain blue background with the Zatch Bell logo and the season two discs have a plain red background with the Zatch Bell logo , no effort was put into this release , Anime Fans deserve better. Don't get me wrong the Series is 5 STARS without a doubt , but the packaging was horrible ! They have done the same thing with the YU-GI-OH Season releases also. I would have not been so DISSAPOINTED if it was about half the price. I am happy that they released this , it was a long wait but definitely a MONEY GRAB on Anime Fans AGAIN ! ! ! ! !",1388534400,4,866,4.0701754385964914
5892424,5,B00E68991S,Since I can't watch it on TV no more I wanted the real copy and bought it on here. Too bad it was really expensive for me and they didn't complete the whole series in English. I'm a very big fan of Zatch Bell tho so its okay! I would totally help out in voice acting if they were to finish the rest of the season 3 in English haha!!! :),1387584000,,336,3.7464788732394365
5892425,5,B00E68991S,"So years ago an anime named zatch bell hit US television, It was successfully enough on the toonami block to last several years until ""Naruto"" came around and took zatch bells prime time slot and thus maybe a year later Zatch bell vanished from our TV's and our manga.

Now 4 years later a company has finally gotten the rights to all of the English dub of the show! For those who do not know the whole zatch bell show is 150 episodes, but due to zatch bells bad ratings only 104 episodes were dubbed and licensed in the states. And understandably for a smaller company it would be much harder to get those last 50 episodes let alone the whole series in Japanese. So please take that into consideration when buying this set.

Anyways, this is the first time that all 104 episodes are on dvd in the states! Prior only the first 52 episodes (the first season) were available on single dvd's divided up into 13 releases. Most of these aren't too hard to come by , but due to low production of certain volumes  the cost to get them even use may be high.

So truly this is the best deal you can get that is a legit release and not a bootleg!
For 85 dollars(at the time of this review) you get 104 episodes, which is about 81 cents per episode.
For comparison purposes I'll let some other series , that you can also get on amazon, that may cost less but overall show that this is a great price for the content amount!

Welcome to the NHK S.A.V.E edition, 24 episodes, cost new from amazon 21 dollars. Cost per episode 87 cents
Digimon: Digital Monsters - The Official First Season , 54 episodes, cost on amazon new 39 dollars, cost per episode 72 cents
High school of the dead season 1 dvd, 12 episodes, cost on amazon new 33 dollars, cost per episode $2.78
Naruto Uncut Box set vol 1, 25 episodes, cost on amazon new 22 dollars, cost per episode 90 cents

As you can see , price per episode zatch bell falls right in the range of a normal series , and doesn't even come close to the outrageous price for series such as high school of the dead!

So hopefully for anyone complaining about the price this will change your mind, it is truly a great series despite the English dub not being complete and hey if your looking for a way to go back and watch the show legally or want to show your kid this pick it up!",1386460800,11,2303,4.244292237442922

5892427,3,B00E68991S,This company over pricess their DVDs. This should be worth $50 at the most. $90 are you kidding me? If they lower the price by a lot I might buy it. This anime was cool from what I can remember,1383350400,,193,3.85

8601890,1,B00E68991S,"This was sent to us on accident by Amazon. Coincidentally, we're still anime fans and decided to give it a try, despite the fact that the cover says it all and there was no japanese dub included.  What you get with this set is a horrendously sub-par english dub, bad character development and plot, and lame card-game anime style battle-scenes  -  although it fits in perfectly with the age of anime of the 2000's.  If you liked the Yugioh and Bakugan shows, or are seven years old, you might like this. Otherwise, please don't waste your time.  There were scenes where they replaced japanese text with comic sans. I repeat, COMIC SANS.  This is a complete waste of money.  We didn't actually buy this and got it sent on accident. If you bought this on purpose, I pity you. You could've been watching Sailor Moon or Yu yu Hakusho or Inuyasha; all better options.  I have no idea why the reviews on every site are by-and-large positive.  There was nothing about this show that was entertaining, there were no endearing characters, and the fight scenes were crap.  If you're looking to buy this for an anime loving friend, don't. The only place this series belongs is the trash, or a museum.",1479945600,,1189,4.592417061611374
8601891,5,B00E68991S,At $60 I thought it was a steal. This is a great Anime and the box it comes in is pretty cool. Must buy!,1455321600,,104,3.375
8601892,5,B00E68991S,"Great anime, I will always remember. I am 22 and watched this when I was 14. I love it. It starts off with a genius named Kiyo, that would skip school. Kids at his school don't like him because he is really smart. Kiyo lays on his bed and reads a book. His mother yells at him for skipping school. Then, Kiyo yells back. Zatch comes in his window as the bird lets go of him and says something like ""that's no way to talk to your mother"".  His father was the person that brought him Zatch, from England to Japan. The reason Kiyo's father brought him Zatch was because he couldn't read his book and thought that Kiyo might be able to.

Zatch is a mamodo (actually called mamono in Japanese, which means ""demon""). The 100 strongest mamodos are selected from the mamodo world and brought to the human world to fight to be king.

In one of the earlier episodes, Zatch fights a mamodo named Kolulu that has no interest in fighting. While her book is burning, she says, ""Maybe if we had a benevolent king, we wouldn't have to come here in the first place"". From that moment on, Zatch decides he wants to become a kind king.

This is missing the last 4 dubbed episodes. There are actually 104 dubbed episodes but only 100 on this 2 disc set. I wish they would release a subtitled version of Zatch Bell Season 3 for the USA. The Japanese version is a bit different but still not bad. I prefer the English version because Folgores song is ""Hey hey lets dance all day"" not a boobie song like the Japanese version.  The Japanese version contains blood but I don't mind that. I just would like to enjoy the rest of the show on my TV because it is so awesome. Also, I like the Zatch Bell movies. The first movie is better than the second movie.

I recommend this is, if you like Zatch Bell. The price was $60 when I bought it.  It is currently around $54. It is worth the price. Always check on Amazon to see the price. Amazon likes to constantly change the prices.",1445040000,3,1951,4.256756756756757

8601897,4,B00E68991S,"I acquired this DVD set today, since my interest in Zatch Bell has rekindled recently.  You do get 100 episodes with this box set, and at the price I purchased it ($49.99) you're basically getting each episode at an awesome value of 50 cents.

And to clarify for future buyers, you are ONLY getting the English dubbed episodes.  There are no options to watch the episodes in Japanese with subtitles.  I personally like the English dub since it was how I first watched the series as a Middle Schooler.  However take in mind there are parts of episodes that have been edited to be 'suitable' for the US audience.  (Infamous example: editing boxers on Zatch since he was usually naked in certain scenes, some censorship so we don't see Kiyo getting kicked in the face, editing guns to.. weird looking laser weapons etc.)

And lastly, if you're like myself and have yet to upgrade to a wide screen TV, these episodes cover the whole screen of your old box TV.  I'll add to this review later when I try watching it on a wide screen TV.",1407888000,6,1030,4.5
