8081624,4,B000B5XP06,"Rather a Gallic cross between CAPOTE and HAROLD AND MAUDE, here's the story of the last love affair of literary lioness Marguerite Duras and the decades-younger object of her affection.  Duras was surely one of the most self-absorbed icons of the 20th century -- difficult to avoid feeling she ever had a random encounter that wasn't fodder for a novel, film or essay -- but Dayan's intelligent screenplay and sure direction offer a superb opportunity for an actress of a certain age, and Moreau seizes it with both hands.  Her ability to fascinate has not dimmed a whit with the passage of time, and it's glorious to see an actress looking her years and yet still radiantly beautiful.  Would make a fascinating evening's viewing alongside THE LOVER.  Recommended.",1141948800,6,764,4.9453125
