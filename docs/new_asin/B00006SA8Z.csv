7972913,5,B00006SA8Z,"This TV series from the 1970's is a classic. I love it because I love everything about the sea. The sea is always so mysterious and leads often to exciting adventure. This is still a top series, for 2017. In the USA, only set one and two are available . The BBC released many more which are available in Europe, (PAL frequency). These episodes are all,with a  historically correct feel to them. The scenery is made on authentic sea-locations and the dramatic performances are very convincing. Though fiction, the episodes have a basic truthful  foundation in their historical content, generally. Each individual episode is fairly self-contained and satisfying, although, it helps for deeper understanding and enjoyment to follow them in chronological order.",1487462400,,757,5.19672131147541

7972917,4,B00006SA8Z,Good soap-opera type history lessons about the politics of the 1800's sailing/ trade business and how it impacts on the sea towns and the commerce it touches.  A period piece to be sure and interesting enough to keep one watching from episode to episode.  I recommend it.,1418428800,,271,4.74468085106383

7972919,5,B00006SA8Z,"I started watching this 30 years ago and got hooked but never saw how it all ended.  Now that it is available I hope to acquire the full series and be able to watch whenever I please.  The cast is near prefect, the writing is excellent and it makes you want to see what is going to happen next.  It is about a sea captain willing to do anything to build his own shipping line, first he marries without love to get his first ship cons his brother into paying for the venture and barely survives the first voyage.  I look forward to the rest of it.",1382313600,,546,4.074766355140187

7972921,5,B00006SA8Z,"Would really really hope to see the rest of the series, so many episodes left, not on Acorn Media either. All in all its a great series, I'm hoping to see the rest of it. Why put in out on DVD if not the entire seasons, can only get on VHS Regions for UK, no USA :(",1283904000,,265,3.6666666666666665
7972922,5,B00006SA8Z,"This second in the series of a grand saefaring story concentrates more on the personalities of the characters, now that James Onedin's shipping fleet is established in a small way. James is still fired with ambition to own one of the world's best sailing fleets but is now, with his partner and brother-in-law, concentrating on building a steamship line, still much of an unknown quantity in those days. James's adventures take him into danger in the Ottoman Empire, under fire in the Franco Prussian war,running the British blockade off Carolina during the American Civil War and being at odds with slaving ship owners. It's a terrific ""Boys Own"" adventure story and great for family viewing",1223424000,4,692,5.026086956521739
