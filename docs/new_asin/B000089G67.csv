I found Dr. Gentry's arguements for a pre AD 70 dating for the writing of Revelation to be logical, interesting and compelling.",1153785600,6,266,4.196078431372549
7980892,5,B000089G67,"The Left Behind generation has rejected scholarship in favor of speculation, fact in favor of fantasy, and history in favor of ""nonfiction."" In this brilliant doculecture, Dr. Kenneth L. Gentry explains that the Beast of Revelation was easily identifiable to first century Christian.  They were the ones who received the Revelation of Jesus Christ written by the hand of the Apostle John and these same first century Christian were the letters primary audience.  If you like being challenged, this production from The Apologetics Group will do just that.",1143676800,5,554,5.284090909090909
7980893,5,B000089G67,"Like a lot (most?) Christians, I have struggled to understand what Revelation and other apocalyptic passages in the Bible are really talking about.  Popular ""Left Behind/Satan is Alive and Well"" teaching has never quite settled well with me.  It just doesn't seem to square with the victory of the cross, the crushing of the serpent's head and the greatness of the Great Commission (""All power has been given to Me..."" Matt. 28:18)  This DVD really helped open my eyes and heart... Eric Holmberg's introduction alone is worth the cost of admission.""",1139443200,6,549,5.010989010989011
7980894,5,B000089G67,"This video is based on the book that Dr. Gentry wrote named The beast of revelation. This video was taken at a bible conference.

Dr. Gentry in his lecture, argues for a early date of the book of Revelation for a pre-70 A.D.His arguements are also because the book was written in the 1st century, the beast the man of sin would be in the 1st century. This view is known as the partial preterist view. Great video and book. Buy both because what wasn't cover in the video will be covered in the book.

God Bless you Dr. Gentry",1112227200,2,525,4.24
7980895,5,B000089G67,"The Beast of Revelation: Identified contains Dr. Kenneth L. Gentry's one-hour teaching on the book of Revelation from the 1999 Ligonier conference in Orlando, Florida. Another one-hour question and answer session follows as Dr. Gentry attempts to answer the question:
Who is the  beast of Revelation?
Numerous candidates have been advanced throughout  the years by noted Bible experts. These have included Pope Leo, Napolean,  Lenin, Stalin, Adolf Hitler, Mussolini, Henry Kissinger, Mikhail Gorbachev,  and even Ronald Reagan. Theories and predictions about the Beast go on and  on.
According to NEWSWEEK (11/1/99), 19 percent of all Americans and  nearly half of all evangelical Christians ""believe that the Antichrist  is on the earth now."" The popularity of this theorizing on the  identity of the Beast is seen in the many books on the market which have  sold tens of millions of copies.
One title, Left Behind by Tim LaHaye,  became the New York Times number one best seller in 1999.
The Beast of  Revelation is the main character in many films which paint him as a  diabolical world dictator who will bring about a New World Order, who will  unite all world religions in order to worship him. According to some Bible  prophecy experts, the Beast will control the destiny of every individual on  the planet through hand-implanted computer chips with personal  identification numbers. And finally, it is believed that the Beast will  seal his own destruction by bringing the late great planet earth to the  brink of Armageddon through a nuclear holocaust.
Now at last, a plausible  candidate for the identity of the dreaded Beast has been identified. If you  will consider Dr. Gentry's case with an open Bible and an open mind, this  teaching is likely to revolutionize your understanding of the book of  Revelation and even more importantly - to radically alter your entire  Christian worldview as well!
