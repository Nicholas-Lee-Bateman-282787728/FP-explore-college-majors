1. the chick in there is extremely cute!! :)
2. movie story line was sorta lame but had good fighting sequences (what did you expect it's not die hard)
3. they have flying machines!

In all seriousness this is a good continuation from the first movie.  Very entertaining, ending was a bit rushed.",1364860800,,315,4.589285714285714
