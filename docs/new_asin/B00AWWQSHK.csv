8558611,4,B00AWWQSHK,A pleasant company to deal with.  Charming walks through towns and country sides.  The photos of the Titanic memorials were sad but interesting.  Their pace is great for walking but slow for jogging or biking.  I enjoy the way the camera is panned over sites of interest.,1435881600,2,271,4.702127659574468
