8386381,5,B0030ZOYS6,"Why haven't you gotten this series?

There is no reason why you shouldn't get this DVD set. The animation style is not a good reason because the action and storyline of this series and in these two DVDs surpass anything that is out there right now. In this DVD set you see some of the best fights that this series has to offer ranging from Nami vs Ms. Doublefinger to Zoro vs Mr. 1 and finally two showdowns of Luffy vs Crocodile. Each one of these fights will leave you on the edge of your seats as you watch what is going on. You will even be able to laugh as you watch.

The music score is perfect too! Perfectly timed music for the most dramatic scenes. FUNimation does an excellent job in making sure you get the Japanese feeling as you watch this with their dub. (There are also great subs for those that don't like dubs.)

FUNimation has done an excellent job in this DVD set which closes maybe one of the longest arcs in the One Piece series. If you are a fan of One Piece then this is something you should have in your One Piece collection. If you are not then it is a good sampler to see what is in this series. Either way a must watch.",1271030400,,1146,4.130044843049327

8386383,5,B0030ZOYS6,"""ONE PIECE"" is a popular anime series based on the popular manga series serialized in Shonen Jump by Eiichiro Oda. Suffice to say, ""ONE PIECE"" is the highest selling manga for Weekly Shonen Jump and its popularity has extended to various anime (via the TV series, OVA and films) and video games in America and also worldwide. The series is so popular, the episode count currently in Japan is over 400 episodes and despite receiving a heavily edited version in North America via 4Kids Entertainment earlier on, FUNimation Entertainment began releasing the original, uncut versions since the May of 2008 with a total of 13 episodes per volume.

""ONE PIECE"" is an adventure anime about a 17-year-old boy named Monkey D. Luffy who gained enormous strength (and stretching abilities) after eating a magical demon fruit. He eventually teams up with a group of pirates and have the name ""The Straw Hats"". Luffy's driven to one day obtain the most sought out treasure known as ""One Piece"" and eventually become the King of the Pirates.

In ""One Piece - Season Two: Sixth Voyage"", the group are in the country of Alibasta as each member of the Straw Hat Pirates takes on a member of Crocodile's group while Luffy goes against Mr. Crocodile, Zoro vs. Mr. One and Nami vs. Miss Doublefinger.  Meanwhile, Smoker's second-in-command leads the marines to capture Crocodile and Baroque works and also the Straw Hat Pirates.

VIDEO :

For most television series, because they are created nearly before they are aired on television, unlike film and OVA's, there typically is not much detail involved in a Japanese animated television series. ""ONE PIECE"" is probably one of those rare exceptions in that it has really cool character designs and very detailed artistic backgrounds.  Of course, since it is on DVD, you will see some artifacting and edge enhancement but it's not so noticeable unless you are really looking for it.

The anime series is presented in standard 4:3 definition but for a television series, ""ONE PIECE"" sports cool and unique character designs and beautifully painted artistic backgrounds. Definitely one of the better looking anime series that has remained consistent and has not downgraded since it first aired on television. Character designer Kazuya Hisada (who worked on the ""Dragon Ball"" and ""Dragon Ball GT"" series) and Noboru Koizumi (who worked on ""Giant Robo"", ""Dragon Ball GT"" and ""Tenchi Universe"") have been very good of capturing ""One Piece"" creator Eiichiro Oda's unique style.

AUDIO & SUBTITLES:

As for the audio, the series is presented in English 5.1 Dolby Surround Sound, English Stereo and Japanese Stereo. Of course, the English 5.1 Dolby Surround Sound is the better audio choice to listen to, although one who has a receiver that can set their audio to all channels can definitely enjoy the Japanese stereo track as well. But both audio tracks are done very well and I have to admit that ""ONE PIECE"" has one of the most solid English dub tracks for an anime TV series. Very well done on both audio tracks but again, have been very impressed by the voice talent for the series thus far.

Subtitles are in English.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

""ONE PIECE - Season Two: Sixth Voyage"" comes with the following special features:

DISC 1:

  * Audio commentary for EPISODE 119 - The Secret of Powerful Swordplay! Ability to Cut Steel and the Rhythm Things Have! - Director Scott Sager joins voice talents Christopher Sabat (Zoro) and  (Brett Weaver) Mr. One.

DISC 2:

  * Textless Songs - Textless Songs for the opening and ending theme.
  * Trailers - FUNimation Entertainment trailers

JUDGMENT CALL:

I absolutely love ""ONE PIECE"". The characters, the action, the involving and well-written storylines and of course, the wonderful voice work via Japanese and also the English dub tracks and the refreshing and unique artwork. But what I enjoyed the most about ""One Piece - Season Two: Sixth Voyage"" is that it has literally been a long stretch between the introduction of Vivi, the trip to Alabasta and now this volume finally gets to the final battle between Luffy and Crocodile, while Nami takes on Miss Doublefinger and Zoro takes on Mr. One, and also the Straw Hats have a new member of the group.

Although nearly every volume has its share of action, this time around the opponents are deadlier than ever before. Before it was a team taking on various opponents but now we have one-on-one battles especially an exciting first battle between Luffy and Crocodile. With the events that are featured in ""One Piece - Season Two: Sixth Voyage"", for those who have seen the movie ""ONE PIECE MOVIE 8: THE DESERT PRINCESS AND THE PIRATES - Adventures in Alabasta"" will be familiar between two of the battles that take place in this volume. But of course, the television series features more of the actual battle.

So, for those who have kept up with the adventure to Alabasta will be happy with this volume as the war in Alabasta and the battle between Crocodile and his henchman versus the Straw Hat Pirates reaches its final conclusion.  No doubt that Luffy, Nami and Zoro fans will dig this latest volume.  Actually, with all the action that takes place in this volume, any ""One Piece"" fan will dig this latest volume!

Overall, ""ONE PIECE"" continues to be a fantastic anime series that has a great combination of humor, action, artwork, great voice acting and cool animation. Another thrilling, action-packed volume that is highly recommended!",1268870400,6,7861,4.747236551215917
8386384,4,B0030ZOYS6,"Its one of the best one piece dvds to come out so far. Nami and Zoro's fight is really cool. Nami did good for the first time by herself in a real
fight. Zoro vs Mr. 1 was just cool and Luffy vs Mr. 0/Crocodile was one of the best battles so far. I'm really glad that funimation took over One Piece instead of you Know who, I'm not going to type in any names but lest just say the firt part of their name starts with a 4.when I was watching it on 4k it felt like a little kitty show. And when I watch it on my computer it was way better so when funimation took over it that was cool because One Piece is a japanese not a kitty cartoon. so now when I watch it its like im wacthing the one on my computer. Im  Sorry about that enjoy the dvd thanks.",1265155200,,746,3.782051282051282
8386385,4,B0030ZOYS6,"The war in Alabasta has reached its climax in the capital city of Alubarna as five separate factions clash (the Royal Guards led by King Cobra, the Rebel Army led by Kohza, the Marines led by Tashigi, the Baroque Works led by Crocodile, and, of course, the Straw Hat Pirates).  Three of Crocodile's Officer Agents have been defeated by the Straw Hats but two of the most powerful Agents are ready to fight.  Ms. Doublefinger (the cafe owner turned dominatrix) squares off against Nami and displays her deadly ability to turn her entire body into spikes.  Fortunately, Nami is prepared for her first solo battle with a new weapon invented for her by Usopp called the Clima Tact.  Unfortunately, there are some whimsically impractical party effects mixed in with the more useful weather based attacks of this weapon, and Nami struggles to figure out how to use it correctly as she runs for her life.  When Nami deals the final blow, it isn't anything like what she or Ms. Doublefinger expects.
Meanwhile, Zoro takes on the equally powerful and serious Mr. 1, who can render his body as hard and strong as steel, as well as convert his fingers and arms into slashing blades that can cut through stone like butter.  Unsure if he could ever defeat a steel man, Zoro remembers a crucial lesson from his old sword master that could be the key to victory.
At the same time, Princess Vivi is getting ready to destroy the royal palace rather than let it fall into Crocodile's hands, but Crocodile arrives just then to stop her.  Crocodile then reveals his true objective in Alabasta, the Pluton Poneglyph.  This ancient inscribed stone, which only Ms. All Sunday can read, is the key to finding one of the world's most powerful ancient weapons.  Soon after, Luffy arrives with the king's messenger, Pell, ready for a another match with Crocodile.  Luffy has figured out Crocodile's weakness; Crocodile cannot convert to sand when he is wet, so Luffy carries a barrel of water into battle.  Luffy is able to land some punches on Crocodile, but ultimately the barrel breaks and Crocodile knocks Luffy out again.
Crocodile then forces the king to lead him to the Poneglyph while he puts his last trump card in play, a massive bomb in the clock tower aimed at the battleground where thousands of Royal and Rebel soldiers are fighting.  It's up to Vivi and Pell to stop the bomb and the Baroque Works agents about to fire it and one of them may not live through the operation.
Luffy confronts Crocodile one last time at the Poneglyph and finally beats him.  Tashigi arrests Crocodile, but the Marines are eager to capture any pirate or criminal they can find, and that includes the Straw Hat Pirates.  In gratitude, King Cobra protects them for a couple days and throws them a massive banquet, but Luffy and Co. figure they need to leave as soon as they can to avoid a Marine dragnet.  They invite Vivi to join their crew and although she is tempted to accept the offer, she ultimately heeds the call to duty and remains in Alabasta, always remembering her friendship with Luffy's crew.  In the end, one member of the now disbanded Baroque Works helps the Straw Hats to escape the Marines while another stows away on Luffy's ship and, with a bit of convincing, joins the crew.

Next volume: The Straw Hat Pirates relax and reminisce, help an old hermit to fulfill his dream, and encounter a mysterious temporal anomaly.",1261180800,3,3404,4.694117647058824
