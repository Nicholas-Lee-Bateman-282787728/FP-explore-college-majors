4234835,5,B003ZK4ZNA,"This was the largest ship in the fleet, in World War II & Korea & Vietnam. Many died on this ship from what I heard from my uncle. As you may know Senator John McCain served on this ship during his tour of duty. As for this documentary it was one of the best of its kind. This ship,nicknamed Mighty O, The O-boat, and Toasted O - was one of 24 Essex-class aircraft carriers. It was in service history from 1950 up to 2004 till the day they sank her. The 17th May 2006 off the coast of the State of Florida for a man made reef. This was a massive ship to sink and the many men saw to scrap tons of steel to make sure it was very light to pull it back out to the harbor to sink her. On this day As was intended, the ship came to rest lying upright. The ship sank stern first 37 minutes after detonation in 210 ft (64 m) of water in the Gulf of Mexico. The flight deck was at a depth of 135 ft (41 m), and its island rose to 70 ft (21 m). Following Hurricane Gustav, the ship shifted 10 feet deeper leaving the flight deck at 145 feet (44 m). The island structure is accessible to recreational divers, but the flight deck will require additional training and equipment. It is now popularly known as the ""Great Carrier Reef"", a reference to Australia's Great Barrier Reef. As crew members from past duty tours & my uncle that day got to seen the ship to its final destination. This is a must see for military persons alike!.",1351900800,3,1420,4.075
