7981916,1,B00008DDU7,"NO real vampires, a terrible half-baked plot, an amateur director, poor photography and not even a naughty bit shown in the whole movie.
If you are a fan of vampire movies, this will not help satisfy you in any manner.
Skip this movie. Even the cops are 1979 cliche.",1489363200,,266,4.448979591836735
7981917,1,B00008DDU7,"If guys wearing heavy mascara and spiked dog collars is your bag, then this is your new favorite movie. If not avoid this garbage at all cost. Notice all the positive reviews were written within a few days of each other. Obviously people involved in what I'm sure was a financial train wreck. Trevor Goddard is fortunate to ever having been cast is any legitimate roll again after being involved in this fetid trash heap of a video. As for it being in any way an authentic depiction of the ""Goth"" lifestyle, maybe in someones ninth grade wet dream.  Everything about this video is just insulting to the intelligence.",1485043200,,616,4.651376146788991
7981918,1,B00008DDU7,"This is what happens when ninth graders write and produce a film. First off there is a difference between Goth and Vampire. The movie merges the two to the dismay of both Goths and Vampires and combines them into some cult religion which requires women to perform a ritualistic suicide. Trevor Goddard who played Blood, the evil Goth/Vampyr actually passed out during the making of the film when he saw fake blood. He is a cult leader who has a web site that reads like a bad Charlie Manson come on. ""You are not alone. You are misunderstood, We are your family."" Blood is the head of a cult called the Black Rose. Fatal (Nora Zimmett) is a girl in the cult who is pregnant and also does blow and smoke pot. Good thing she is off the heroin. There is Anubus (Mark Irvingsen) a club owner and associate of Blood. He is also a business student. Tom Weidder (Jeff Marchelletta) plays a gay student who helps Fatal and walks around with a goatee painted on his chin. Professor Fulton is the class instructor whose real name, Muse Watson sounds like one of the characters.

This is perhaps the ""Reefer Madness"" of Goth films. It is idiotic. Unfortunately it lacks the camp value to be entertaining unless you're a real Goth.
Trevor Goddard fans will want to avoid this one, it is unbelievably bad. Even the phrase ""Based on a Series of true Events"" should tell you something about the film. Minus 2 stars.",1308182400,,1400,4.511811023622047
7981919,4,B00008DDU7,"A must for Trevor Goddard fans. The film teaches you very well about things you shouldn't do at all. And things you may try and like. Might sound weird but so it is. Avoid the end ,if you can.",1276732800,,192,3.948717948717949
7981920,1,B00008DDU7,"Unless you're heavily into Goth and whatever all goes along with that, which in this is coming on to your college professor (when he's the same sex) and dressing up goth at all times no matter how ridiculous it is, then avoid this like the plague.  This is an absolute piece of crap and I can't believe I watched the whole thing.  Thankfully it's now down at the trade in store waiting for some other poor sucker to come along, if that hasn't already happened.  Bleah.",1096156800,,468,4.4186046511627906
7981921,5,B00008DDU7,"Trevor Godard is phenomenal at he portrays the bad guy in this inside look at the GOTH scene. The acting from all actors is true to form.  The story is a nice mix of the ups and downs, in a very dramatic style, of the actors characters.  You believe them. A must see!",1062374400,,267,4.018867924528302
7981922,2,B00008DDU7,"This movie couldn't hold my attention, despite a very attractive leading character and a moderately hot male-on-male kiss....If you're looking for a vampire movie or a horror/soft-core film (ala the movies in ""the Brotherhood"" series), skip this one.",1056758400,,250,5.605263157894737
