5076904,3,B007C8RZO2,"Some excellent stories about real heros. The editorial work around the stock footage supporting the movie was very very poorly done. In one instance, a quick shot of B-29's were shown on island bases as the story of McArthur's withdrawl from the Bataan was discussed (B-29's entered the war well after Bataan). In another, B-29's were shown on on an air base in England just before D-Day was launched. I don't believe they were there in June of 1944, nor were ever used in the European theater. Just sloppy video review...the story deserves better.",1340496000,3,548,4.840425531914893
5076905,3,B007C8RZO2,"This just arrived yesterday, and I must admit, I ordered it with some misgivings.  I have seen some of the men awarded this Medal on The Military Channel, and most do not think that they were heroes at all.  They were simply doing their job when extraordinary circumstances put them in a position that called for sacrifice -- not something you spend time thinking about!  This particular documentary is divided into 6 parts: Civil War, World War One, World War II Europe, World War II Pacific, Korea and Vietnam.  At the conclusion of the Vietnam segment there is the inclusion of recipients from the Somalia, Iraq and Afghanistan conflicts as well.  This documentary appears to be very up to date (2012) and covers the awards presented by President Obama.  There are some speeches made at these presentations by former Presidents Lyndon B. Johnson and George W. Bush, as well as by President Obama.  Otherwise this film is centered on the backgrounds of the conflicts/wars, giving us an idea of what brought men to these terrible venues.
There is a great deal of stock photos and footage, with a progression of technical achievements that allows better realism.  There are also many scenes done by ""re-enacters"", from the Civil War up to and including Vietnam.  These are supplemented by footage pertinent to the era.  I have to register one complaint, and that is the sound of the narrator.  Oddly compressed for an HD recording, the lack of dynamics also lulls one to doze during certain stretches.  Also, one must sit through the introduction to each portion of the film.  This may have been due to showing it in other venues as a series of films instead of one lengthy piece.  Once again, the last bits of the film fare better, but that hardly makes up for almost 3 hours of mediocre sound and continual intros.  Overall the presentation is good, the idea behind the presentation even better, and  -lest we forget -- the number of people who live to tell the tale of their personal battle are few indeed.  As the film points out, as the weapons of war ""improve"", the odds of surviving a close encounter go way down.  Most of all it is imperative that we recognize and honor the ultimate sacrifice made by these extraordinary members of the armed forces.  It gets you to thinking: ""Could I do this?""  Unless we are faced with the incredible test of being in such horrendous situations, we may never know.  But it is this virtually instantaneous response to choose a certain path that makes this decoration truly a Medal Of Honor.",1336089600,18,2533,4.724373576309795
5076906,5,B007C8RZO2,"There was a clear and consistent effort to be as accurate and authentic as possible in the creation of this DVD series.  The historical recreations are intense, layered and detailed with great care in the special effects and historical truth and authenticity along with the powerful voice of narrator Coby Batty and other voice actors help to bring these stories of the Medal of Honor to life for a mass audience - from the Civil War to the War in Afghanistan.",1332979200,8,460,4.679012345679013

5076919,4,B007C8RZO2,"This was a very well-done history of the ""Medal of Honor.""  If you enjoy history and want to expand your knowledge and appreciation for the men and women who serve our country serve our country in order to protect our freedoms, I recommend as well as encourage anyone to purchase this blu-ray/dvd!",1403654400,,297,4.711538461538462
5076920,1,B007C8RZO2,"Most of the footage in this Documentary has nothing to do with the story being told at the time. Mis-information abounds if you know anything about the actions described (Buffalo Bill did not get his Medal Of Honor during The Battle Of The Little Big Horn as stated on disc one), and I don't need to be beaten over the head with ""Political Correctness"" repeatedly. (it may come as a surprise to the uneducated people who made this Program that ""Black Soldiers"" got multiple Medals Of Honor during the Civil War and Indian Wars) This program was a waste of time and money I can not get back. The only reason I gave it one star is because Amazon does not allow you to give less. Don't waste your time on this worthless program. If this is where you get your information about The Medal Of Honor, you have been sadly dis-served.",1399766400,2,825,4.434210526315789

5076922,5,B007C8RZO2,"This is a very good DVD.  It brings the true meaning of the Medal of Honor to life.  Most people think you just win it.  You are awarded the Medal of Honor, you don't win it.  There is so much meaning behind the medal.  Just think of all the men and women who did not receive this medal.  They also deserve our admiration and thanks.  To all my military all over the world - I SALUTE YOU!!!!!!!!!!!!",1370908800,4,399,4.103896103896104
5076923,5,B007C8RZO2,"I bought this one because i want to know all about the american armed forces. And it is great to see what a man can do for his beliefs, and his country, when he follows the call of duty.
The dvd is well produced and gives a lot of information.

This documentary is for everyone to remember that there are true heroes in this world.",1363478400,,331,4.092307692307692
5076924,5,B007C8RZO2,A misused and overused word today. But these are the genuine articles. My uncle won one of these and he made Rambo look like a sissy. Nice to know we have these people around. I have had the priviledge of meeting several of these men and they have never failed to make me feel grateful to them.,1362355200,2,294,4.175438596491228
5076925,5,B007C8RZO2,"As one can tell by the title ""It says it all.""  I've always worked my life to excel in many areas especially when investigating items concerning the military.  If it doesn't meet many critical points - I do not go any further.
When it comes to this DVD - all I can state is the following:

  WELL DONE",1360195200,,301,4.120689655172414
