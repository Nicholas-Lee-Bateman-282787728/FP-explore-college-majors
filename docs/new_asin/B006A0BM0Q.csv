In my opinion, it is one of the finest films ever done: it is Epic Theatre on film, as though Piscator or Brecht were film makers. It is filled with wonderful performances supporting Werner -in one of his finest renditionst, as a dedicated Captain, trying to get a message to Der Fuhrer and Skoda as a decomposing Hitler. thoroughly brilliant.
I am seeking a CD or DVD of this masterpiece.",1501113600,,475,4.6
8495640,5,B006A0BM0Q,"This is a masterpiece of the postwar Germany, directed by the great Pabst in 1955
The story unfolds the ten days prior to the demise of the German dictator, in a crude way.
Six, seven decades later we tend to take for granted that we were liberated through a bloody
war, that claimed close to 50 million lives. We - the postwar generation - kind of forget what the
world would be like under the horror of the Nazi regime. Great movie!",1376784000,,434,4.304878048780488
