2384185,5,B000ABKHZC,"I thought this was super funny. Though it had a short time on TV, most people would have to like it in their DVD tv show collection. I agree that it is in the ranks with The Simpsons, South Park, King Of The Hill, Monty Python, Family Guy, and Futurama.",1122768000,10,253,4.08
2384186,4,B000ABKHZC,"This series alternates between juvenile and demented.  It's some of Will Ferrell's best work (outside his SNL material, of course).

Currently this is available exclusively at Best Buy.  Hold off the temptation to buy it from them (or from the rip-off artist here on the Amazon Marketplace that wants $50-$60 for it, and buy it in about 2 more months when it's everywhere for $24.",1122508800,37,380,4.815384615384615
2384187,5,B000ABKHZC,"I have to agree, the person below did not give the show a chance.  This is one of the funniest shows i've ever seen!  Not only can you catch it on Adult Swim, it is on TBS late friday nights.  If you like The Simpsons, Family Guy, Futurama, King of the Hill, South Park or any other ADULT cartoon, you will no be dissappointed in this.",1121817600,31,335,4.045454545454546
2384188,5,B000ABKHZC,"I think the other reviewer hasn't given this series a chance.  One episode isn't enough to judge an entire series!  Also, this series was (it seems to me, anyway) meant for adults, not kids.  That's why it's on ADULT Swim.  This is a great series which Hot Topic hasn't killed yet.",1121817600,22,281,4.450980392156863

2384202,5,B000ABKHZC,"An era that has past on adult swim. When they put out wonderful cartoons instead of a bunch of crap. The Oblongs, Home Movies, Mission Hill, The Boondocks, and Moral Oral all had wonderful comedic value, as well intellectual stimulation. Now they seem to pander to the 9th grader who smokes to much weed and enjoys fart jokes. Just because we are adults who like cartoons doesn't mean we want an endless stream of unrelated cut aways, fart jokes, crude unfunny humor, and thinly disguised racial jokes!
But enough of my rant, you cant go wrong with the Oblongs. From the pet with narcolepsy to the cocaine laced energy drink you will have hours of laughter",1452297600,,656,4.663793103448276

2384212,5,B000ABKHZC,"I enjoyed watching this show when it was on Adult Swim, and was thrilled when I could again watch the show again ( and in it's entirety!) The show feature the voice talents of Will Farrell and Jean Smart as Bob and Pickles Oblong, a hard-working family man from the wrong side of town and his bald, smoking, boozing wife. Not a kids show by any means, but if you like the comedy of Family Guy or American Dad, you will enjoy this cynical look at family life.",1436659200,,458,4.215909090909091

2384214,4,B000ABKHZC,"This is a very short lived (1 season) show that aired for a bit on the WB back in the early 2000s and was later moved to Cartoons Network's ""Adult Swim"" where the remaining unaired 5 episodes were finally shown.

It's quirky, funny, and short (consisting of only 13 episodes, each with about a 20 minute run time). Well worth the $10 or so I paid for it.",1432166400,,354,4.205882352941177

2384223,5,B000ABKHZC,"Love this! I won't bother reviewing the series, because if you are looking you are probably already familiar with it. If not, you can always check out the other reviews or IMDB.

The discs are well packaged and work great! I bought this a few years back from a store and after 2 months or so one of the discs stopped working. Like it was warped or damaged, which is weird because it was never damaged. So I was hesitate to buy it again thinking maybe the manufacturer cheaped out on production. It must have been a fluke because these have been working fine for months now!

My only qualm is I wish there were more bonus features. There are pretty much just two short featurettes, better than nothing but I would love more interviews or episode commentary.",1420761600,,756,4.471014492753623

that its only 13 episodes, if you are feeling down and need to have a laugh,

under the hill in the valley (of the Rich People) and the nuclear waste that streams
down makes all the folks down there have very inflated birth defects or problems.

2384272,5,B000ABKHZC,"Like a large amount of the reviewers, I discovered this show through adult swim on cartoon network this was of course  YEARS ago when adult swim  actually contained  some  good shows and wasn't just full of  Family Guy and  American Dad reruns. (but hey  I guess the masses  like that stuff)

anywho  I Instantly fell in love with the oblongs cartoon , it is  very funny, very dark  and just downright twisted! which of course makes the show appeal highly to those who have  sadistic  imaginations( me). finding the entire series on  a DVD set  is just heavenly. it's so nice to sit down with some episodes  and  watch  without the hassle of commercials  and the ability to pause the show to deal with minor annoyances  like children.. pets... incontinent  relatives...door to door sales people...spontaneous piranha attacks.. and bathroom breaks) ensures that you never have to miss  a second of the show. and again no commercials which means no one  except for your relatives and the IRS) trying to  cheat you  out of your hard earned money!

 for anyone who loves the show i highly recommend the book ""creepy Susie"" by Angus Oblong, it  is a book of short stories about the  main characters of the show and their origins.  the book is not in publication anymore  or so i was told by a Barnes and Noble book jockey) but it can be found on amazon and eBay and the like.

 so in conclusion, the show is great, the book is great and not having to deal with the internet  or cartoon network to watch the show makes  cynical commercial haters like myself  VERY happy!",1317427200,8,1564,4.556363636363637

Voices include Will Ferell and Pamela Adlon plus more.. there is a total of 13 or 14 episodes..(roughly around 2 and a half hours of showtime) A good deal considering the price..My case was a little bent..but i was just happy to get it.

2384281,3,B000ABKHZC,"I saw ""The Oblongs"" at a pawn shop and picked it up for $15. I only vaguely remembered seeing the cartoon, and I don't think I ever watched even one entire episode. I was intrigued though and so I picked up the show. Wow, I don't know what I was expecting but WOW. Some of what comprises this series is clever. A lot of it is dark, dark humor, a coffin leaking fluid, a disfigured Debbie, etc. Some of what is here is funny, ""sex as white noise to help Milo sleep"". All in all though I found a lot of the material to be too politically tainted ""she's white and she has a bible, we should listen to her"", to be funny. The author seems pretty creepy and scary. I don't think it is all an act. The guy seems angry. I pulled up a picture of him on the internet and he was wearing a t-shirt that simply said FAG. Overall the art and the animation is what pleased me the most. I grew pretty tired of characters like ""Pickles"". Mostly I guess I enjoyed Milo, Bobby the father and the little toad girl. The girl without a jaw
was just too gross though. She grossed and creeped me the hell out. I enjoyed the Debbies though. This has got to be one of the weirdest cartoons ever made. Oh, and I didn't like the girl with the tumor or wart on her head either. She looked and acted like a Raggedy Ann doll. She was pretty creepy as well. I can appreciate the creators striving to make something creepy. It's another thing though when stuff is so creepy to where it makes the viewer
uncomfortable.",1273968000,4,1484,4.15625

2384283,4,B000ABKHZC,"The Oblongs was a short-lived show that would probably have a longer run if put on television today. It is the story of the Oblong family, who live in the valley where all the toxic waste and sewers run from the rich houses up on the Hill and Globocide chemical plant. The people in the valley are thus deformed and every background scene shows high tension wires and an eerie yellow sky. Given the apparent realities of sick communities and irresponsible corporate behavior, the Oblongs satirizes this reality and challenges our expectations. Back in 2000, Americans were still enthusiastic about our super economy and the economic development which characterized the 1990s. A cynical show about an exploited and abused family did not make the cut. In today's world of financial meltdown and rampant corporate corruption, the underlying premise of The Oblongs is much more relevant. The show is not always a barrel of laughs, but it is nonetheless entertaining and intriguing. It features the voice talents of Will Ferrell, before he exploded, as the quadraplegic and eternally optimistic head of the Oblong clan.

What a shame Warner Bros. didn't appreciate all the creativity that went into the series. The 13 episodes are sharp, witty, and never condescend to the audience, with brilliant voice performances, especially by Will Ferrell and Jean Smart. Angus Oblong's marvelous designs come to vibrant life and make you cheer for the lovable-though-misshapen inhabitants of Hill Valley. The simple object lesson of the show is that it's more important to have a heart than to be rich, beautiful and popular. I have followed this philosophy for many years and have never regretted making the friends I have and meeting the people I love.

2384290,5,B000ABKHZC,"Well, i guess I'm not really going to add anything that hasn't been said (or written) by other customers who bought this DVD set, but anyway... This series is bitterly and synicly amazing. I discovered the Oblongs on Cartoon Network's Adult swim too like 2 months ago and all of a sudden I found myself waiting for hours (usually 'till 1:00 A.M. when I used to go to bed 3 hours earlier) just to watch another new episode. This is an amazing cartoon but I agree with other reviewers that it's simply not for everyone. The main characters in The Oblongs bear genetic anomalies in quite a noticeable way due to the polluted environment where they're bound to live (they can't afford a higher quality lifestyle) that at the same time is generated by the people living in the hills (the rich people.

From the mere start of the episode (presentation and all) the cruel yet comical ways this series was thought and conceived hit you in the face and leave you with that (Oh no man, that's so wrong...) feeling, and actually, verbal expresion, but at the same time you can't stop from finding it extremely comical, and I actually laughed out loud all the way from beggining to end the first time I watched it.

I personally think this one is a really commendable item for people with an intelligent sense of humour, and as I said, it's not really for everyone, and that's actually the reason why they stopped creating it. People complained a lot about this series when it first hit the streets back in 2001, but... come on, look at Family Guy, that's even a more cruel series in which they even laugh at physically disabled people, but at the same time is hugely popular... and (in my opinion) is not as funny nor refreshingly naive as The Oblongs. (...did i said naive?)

I just lament the fact that there's just this DVD set of The Oblongs episodes out there for people like me to enjoy, and mainly because regular people feel offended by Intelligent content displayed without hypocrisy.",1223510400,4,1982,4.593220338983051

They are the stories of unity, life lessons and love. Now take that loving family and make them all deformed due to living near a toxic waste dump. Say hello to the Oblongs!

This show lasted for only one year on the WB now CW 11. It was one of the most revolutionary animated sitcoms way before it's time. If it were to be released now it would probably be a smash hit. This is also perhaps Will Ferrel's best performance playing the loving and devoted father Bob, who is nothing but a bouncing torso with the best one liners like 'Pickles, have you seen my ankle weights?! These characters may not the be the most plesent to look at or some of the things they do may cause the gag reflex to kick in.

If you like shows like The Simpsons or South Park, I think you will love this one. Although it is very different from both of those shows, it has a similar but slightly more morbid and grotesque type of humor. Also, if you like Will Ferrell, you will probably love this show, because his voice is used for one of the main characters, and I am almost positive that he does some writing for the show, too. The DVD has 13 episodes, and they are all extremely funny.

There are also some really interesting extras about Angus Oblong and his animation. (Angus Oblong is the animator and creator of the cartoon).  I think anyone can appreciate this show if they like cartoons.

Attention parents: this show is not for small children. It isn't really bad, about PG-13 I would say, but I would not buy it for a kid under 12. It does have references to sex, drugs, and other more mature topics. Just a tip.

family is nothing new under the sun but this up a winner for the
simple concept in character design, fast paced script & attention

episodes original aired and contains a making of featurette which
