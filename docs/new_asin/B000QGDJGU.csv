His Divorce
Her Divorce
Last Time I saw Paris

His divorce & Her Divorce (1972): Stars the real-life couple Richard Burton & Elizabeth Taylor in a two-part film telling the story of the demise of an 18 year marriage first told by his perspective of a claustrophobic union of an overbearing wife and then the film is split up as though it were a second film, told by her perspective of an emotionally unavailable and philandering husband constantly traveling for work; moving to Africa and abandoning his family. Really the film is one film that is re-hashed into two films using the first films scenes re-cut into ""her"" perspective.

You pretty much end up feeling like you are watching the same movie twice with just a *very subtle undertone* of difference in perspective. Perhaps it would be more interesting if you don't watch them back to back as I made the mistake of doing; and was bored to death, having done so. The first film was interesting, the second ""version"" had me bored.

2 hours and 28 minutes of Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor arguing TWICE can be too much for anyone and if you are bent on watching that - at least do it in a more theatrical venue like with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Taming-of-the-Shrew/dp/B00000JL7T/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Taming of the Shrew</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Cleopatra/dp/B000BZISSU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Cleopatra</a>.

Last Time I saw Paris (1954) Is a very charming movie starring a young Elizabeth Taylor and without the usual high drama you get with many of her films. This is a romantic story of youthful exuberance and of post-war celebrations that becomes a short-lived newlywed life when greed and wealth taint their love and devotion to each other when jealousy kills their trust and passion. A real treat is that Van Johnson co-stars along with Eva Gabor, Roger Moore, and Donna Reed.
A Must See for Elizabeth Taylor Fans.

If you are a collector of Elizabeth Taylor Movies - I recommend picking up this dvd selection for the His Divorce/Her Divorce package which is difficult to find elsewhere & at a very reasonable price here. If you aren't interested in the film His Divorce/Her Divorce- you can find&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Last-Time-I-Saw-Paris/dp/B0000639EB/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Last Time I Saw Paris</a>&nbsp;either on it's own or bundled with any number of other movies for a good price as well.

The quality of this collection is pretty decent too!",1189296000,31,2789,5.543529411764706
