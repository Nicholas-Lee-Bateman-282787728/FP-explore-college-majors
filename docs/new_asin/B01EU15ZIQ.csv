7740749,5,B01EU15ZIQ,"'Be still as a mountain, move like a river' - Professor Cheng  I enjoyed watching this movie on the big screen recently at Amherst Cinema, that great non profit preserver of independent films with character, in a hall packed full of Professor Cheng's students and student's students. Having learned this form 15 years ago, and having seen many videos online of Professor and an old VHS video document my first teacher, Cheng's student Judyth Weaver, has, I was anticipating this film with great relish. I supported it's development, and enjoyed seeing the final product. Even if you are not a student of tai chi, or have never heard of Cheng Man-Ching, you can learn true lessons and inspiration from this person of deep character who lead many others to discover their own life path and inspired peace and effort of practice in his followers. In my mind Cheng Man-Ching was an emissary of peace who brought joy to others specifically though his powerful application of principles. His many skills of painting, poetry, medicine, tai chi, and calligraphy all emerged from his fine character and intense study of the Way. He studied deeply the teachings of former sages. I thought the creators of this film, Barry Strugatz and Ken Van Sickle, created this as a labor of love to bring the pacific art of tai chi, and this great man's teachings, which still resonates throughout the world in his students and grand-students, to more as a source of joy and peace in a turbulent world. Interviews with Cheng's children, and Maggie Newman's birthday party, were especially touching moments. Highly recommend this film if you are interested in the 60s, martial arts, Chinese Culture, interesting personalities, of tai chi chuan, the ""Great Ultimate"".",1471219200,4,1742,4.986254295532646
7740750,3,B01EU15ZIQ,I was disappointed that this DVD could not be watched via my DVD player and had to be viewed via my computer DVD drive instead. This spoilt the experience for me.,1471132800,5,162,4.258064516129032
7740751,5,B01EU15ZIQ,"Simply a beautiful film to watch, not for great landscape vistas or vivid colors, but for the spiritual heart captured in the grainy black and white film clips, and the obvious adoration Prof. Cheng inspired in his students. Other reviewers have discussed details and slight niggles, but I'd like to add the fact that the film is inspiring in addition to being instructive. Cheng's art and attitude were inspiring, and, in a world currently filled with so much negativity, it's inspiring to see someone who seems to have simply dedicated himself to improving the quality of others' lives. Mr. Strugatz has done an excellent job of letting a large collection of Prof. Cheng's students eloquently express what drew them to Tai Chi Chuan in general and to Prof. Cheng in particular. Highly recommended viewing if you're a student of the art, or if you're wondering whether to become a student of the art.",1469923200,12,901,4.895424836601308
7740752,5,B01EU15ZIQ,"A film about a cipher, a man who fully mastered every art he touched, and who could work near-miracles while scarcely moving a muscle. It was a tough movie to make, as there's no THERE there. The Professor was as still and unremarkable as the eye of a hurricane, even as bodies were strangely thrown high up into the air all around him, and gorgeous masterpieces of painting and of calligraphy emerged from under his brush. No one in the film can begin to explain him, because there seems not to have been anyone home under the tunic (in a nice bit of unintentional allegory, one student says on-camera that you might brush his sleeve, but  never catch any part of his body).

This talkative film works all its magic in silence. I'd suggest you watch more than you listen, taking in the paintings, the calligraphy, the flow of the Tai Chi form, the hurtling bodies, and the confused (but deeply touched) students utterly unable to account for ANY of it.

Disclosure: I'm friends with the director. I don't usually review products I have a connection to. But I actually loved this way more than I expected to (not being a tai chi student), and am genuinely enthusiastic about it. It's not for everyone, but if my description rings any bells for you - if silence/stillness is something you spend any time contemplating, then you need to get this. And just watch.",1469836800,10,1360,4.6115702479338845
7740753,4,B01EU15ZIQ,"Professor Cheng Man-ch'ing was one of the most influential masters of t'ai-chi ch'uan of the 20th century, and this film provides a welcome documentary record of his time in New York City in the early 1960s and '70s.  The producer and director, Barry Strugatz, is to be commended on having the foresight to begin interviewing direct students of Professor Cheng more than a decade ago, capturing valuable glimpses into the cross-cultural transplantation process of this treasure of traditional Chinese culture.  It is these interviews, along with historical footage of Professor Cheng conducting classes at his New York City Shr Jung school, that constitute the heart and substance of the presentation.

The interviews reveal what it was like to meet and study with the famous master from the perspective of a number of his American students.  The ""extras"" section includes film of Professor Cheng performing his 37 posture short form, which he distilled from the traditional Yang Style form of his teacher, Yang Cheng-fu, himself the great ""standardizer"" and popularizer of modern Yang Style T'ai-chi Ch'uan in the 1920s and '30s.  The film provides an interesting and fairly accessible entree into the world of t'ai-chi for the uninitiated.  It focuses on the New York Shr Jung School in the years between 1964 and 1975, when Professor Cheng passed away in Taiwan.

One shortcoming of the film is its failure to live up to the promise of its title.  While ""The Professor"", as his students called him, was indeed instrumental in t'ai-chi's journey from Mainland China to the West, this film sheds little light on this fateful journey.  No information is provided on how or why Professor and his method of t'ai-chi traveled from the Mainland to Taiwan, where he lived and taught for a decade and a half before beginning to alternate his time between America and Asia.  No explanation is offered of why or how Professor Cheng settled in New York.  No information is provided on the contributions of Mr. Robert W. Smith, Professor's first Western student (Taiwan, 1959), whose articles and books introduced Cheng Man-ch'ing and his art widely in the English-speaking world.  This is in spite of the fact that, only minutes into the DVD, the presentation highlights historic film footage of Professor Cheng in Taiwan circa 1960 demonstrating his rooting ability with Mr. Smith and other students, none of whom are identified in the DVD.  Although the original 16mm film footage was itself arranged and provided courtesy of Mr. Smith, this is not noted.  Neither does the film mention Professor's first teaching of t'ai-chi in America, which took place in San Francisco before he established his New York school.  Nor does it mention Professor's senior-most student, Mr. Benjamin P. J. Lo, who at his teacher's request, moved from Taiwan to San Francisco in 1974 to assist the master in providing instruction in t'ai-chi to Western students and who has taught Professor Cheng's method there ever since.  Like Mr. Smith, Mr. Lo appears in photographs used in the film but is never identified.  At least a fleeting shot of the original Taipei, Taiwan Shr Jung School appears near the end of the DVD, but its importance in the transmission of the art to the West goes unmentioned.  The director was probably wise to focus on the New York years, since his sources were from that group; however, it's too bad that a minute or two wasn't devoted to answering the questions raised by the clever title of the DVD.

Those interested in more information should look into the earlier video/dvd released by Professor Cheng's family entitled ""T'ai Chi Ch'uan: A Simplified Method of Calisthenics for Health and Self Defense"" (Cho-san, Inc. 1996), which provides a broader scope.  Also of interest to those who would like more detail on the New York years is ""Cheng Man-ch'ing: The Master Tapes"" (Mastodon Productions, 2008).  Most highly recommended are Professor Cheng's own writings (for example, ""Cheng Tzu's Thirteen Treatises on T'ai Chi Ch'uan"", translated by Benjamin P. J. Lo and Martin Inn with the Cheng family's full permission in 1985) and the books of Robert W. Smith (especially ""Chinese Boxing: Masters and Methods"", 1974, ""Martial Musings"", 1999, and ""T'ai-Chi"" co-authored with Cheng Man-ch'ing in 1966).

Finally, on the whole, this DVD is a great achievement and a valuable contribution, not only to the worldwide martial arts community, but also to all people interested in health and personal development.  I highly recommend it.",1469664000,16,4532,5.094594594594595
7740754,5,B01EU15ZIQ,"This film is amazing.  While you would expect me to be supportive as one of the associate producers, I will tell you truthfully that I would have been happy with any-old amateur production related to documenting Cheng Man-Ching's years in New York since he is my teacher's teacher.

But WOW.  What a spectacular, professional, highly interesting film.  This film goes way above and beyond.  It delves into the Professor as a teacher, as a scholar, as a school owner.  You get an inside look at the difficulties as well as the good stuff - the benefits of not only the art of Taijiquan but the man himself. I highly recommend it for anyone with any interest at all in Taijiquan as either a martial art or a health activity.",1469664000,9,722,4.558139534883721
7740755,5,B01EU15ZIQ,"This movie is just great. If you are interested in tai chi or want to get a sense of how it impacted a generation of Americans in the 60s then you'll love this movie. This will be a wonderful historical resource as well as a beacon for future generations of tai chi teachers and students - showing the heart of the art, the way tai chi expands to embrace health, art, martial arts, spirituality and philosophy. I've been practicing tai chi for over 20 years and I can honestly say that I've never seen a documentary on the subject I enjoyed so much.",1469577600,8,549,4.339805825242719

Now don't get me wrong if you are a true Yang student and look at it very carefully you can put in the different spots.

I found the interviews fascinating and the old footage really interesting.  it is a good overview of Tai Chi Chuan and covers all aspects of the art from form to pushing hands. It is not an instructional video, so you will need a class for that, more like a biographical documentary.

7740773,5,B01EU15ZIQ,"This is an extraordinary work of art about an extraordinary artist's life work.  Although I never had the joy of meeting Professor, I was given the life-altering gift of discovering T'ai Chi Ch'uan as an adolescent by one of Cheng Man Ching's senior students, Louis Kleinsmith, and thereafter have had the honor of counting as teachers and friends two other of Professor's senior students, Stanley Israel and Maggie Newman.  The truly beautiful and historically significant portrayal of the Professor in this movie, as seen through his own appearances and through the eyes and voices of those who were so fortunate as to know him, is a creative triumph.  But what most makes this stellar work invaluable to any current or potential student of the art of T'ai Chi Ch'uan is what is shared of Professor's teachings.  That he was a master of five excellences, there is no doubt; but that he also was a master of another excellent art, that of a gardener whose seeds blossom beyond all reasonable expectation, is also indubitably true.  Barry Strugatz, Ken Van Sickle, and the other superb crafters of this wonderful film may justly take pride in their creation of yet another wondrous sprout of Cheng Man Ching's amazing artistry.  I thank them, and likewise thank my T'ai Chi friends and colleagues, for what is ultimately the Professor's ever-growing gift to us all.  Mark Walter",1484006400,10,1378,4.9393939393939394

Having studied with Maggie and other students of Professor Cheng I expect my objectivity to be somewhat colored, but I immediately recognized while watching the film how remarkable that professor was able to communicate to all of them a deep understanding of the body and spirit of the art with such profound ease. In turn, his students ability to pass this teaching on to their students is further testimony to his transcendent ability.
I am extremely gratified this film communicates this so well and documents it for future generations. Very moving. A deep bow and many thanks to all responsible.  F.W. Cohasset, Ma",1481414400,5,650,5.018518518518518

There are also extras which includes the best footage of him doing the form and a very interesting interview about the benefits of Tai Chi with a Harvard medical doctor.

7740785,5,B01EU15ZIQ,"Virtually every second of this seventy-two minute film offers something fascinating, thought-provoking or inspiring, and very often all three.  With each successive viewing of The Professor, I've felt as if I were watching it for the first time, there is that much richness here to mine.  The remarkable archival footage of a great master at work - as martial artist, calligrapher, painter, practitioner of healing arts - combined with interviews with a number of the Professor's earliest American students provides a deeply moving portrait of not only the man who brought Tai Chi to New York City in the 60's, but what it means to search for one's own personal path and learn to follow it.  This documentary brims with love, compassion, respect, and gratitude but delivers the power of those with the lightest touch possible: very much like Tai Chi itself.  Anyone looking  for a dose of positivity and hope in what can seem a truly dark time can do no better than to pick up a copy of this film.",1474675200,2,997,4.773255813953488

7740789,5,B01EU15ZIQ,"The documentary ""The Professor Tai Chi's Journey West"" by Barry Strugatz is a real gem. The narrative of the film follows one of the great Tai-Chi masters, Cheng Man-Ching, during his years in New York City from mid- 60s to mid- 70s. In a raw studio on the Lower East Side, NYC his teachings soon attracted an eclectic group of curious dissidents during those unsettling times. They spontaneously formed a community around their teacher, who they soon simply called the Professor. While discovering the secrets of the core of Tai Chi - the powers of rooting, gravity and listening to the energy of the other, students bonded deeply and naturally.
The beauty of this documentary is twofold: To a total novice it gives a tangible understanding of what Tai Chi is. When you watch people moving through a Tai Chi form it may appear to be simply meditation in motion, and some say it is, but yet it also is a martial art. These moves can be used in self-defense and successfully.
To a practicing student it offers a soulful insight into the complexity of experience shared generously by some of Professor's mature students. But, is there such a thing ""mature student""? As far as I could see they all are humbled by the years of their practice; they are gentle and warm, generous and strong; they stand their ground but don't push and they don't brag.  They see themselves as perpetual beginners.
Barry Strugatz's tender evocation of how the community coalesced and continues to practice together to this day is certainly a documentary that should not be missed. I highly and warmly recommend it.",1473465600,3,1590,4.781818181818182
