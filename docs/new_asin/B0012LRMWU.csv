3092086,3,B0012LRMWU,"This product was very disappointing. Each energy last approximately 90 seconds. I thought that this video would be more similar to the Fit Kids Classroom Workout DVD that Judy does. Judy introduces herself between each and every ""energy blast"", this is very annoying. It is hard to keep students engaged and their heart rate up in a physical education class. Perhaps this is better suited to use at home. However, the vocabulary and health tips that are included are pretty cool.",1232236800,7,479,4.925925925925926

8246769,5,B0012LRMWU,"During internship, I used the video for my students to get exercise.  Students were allowed to choose their own song and they all exercised/danced to it.  They looked forward to the videos everyday.",1518912000,,198,4.96969696969697
8246770,3,B0012LRMWU,The bursts weren't nothing much and you keep having to go back to the beginning to start the next blast which takes more time than the blasts themselves. This video case also came smelling so heavy of chemicals that I had to throw it outside to air out and even then the smell never came out. It was horrible. I don't recommend this video.,1466035200,,339,4.3125
8246771,5,B0012LRMWU,Really great for keystage 1 children to follow but think older children would enjoy too as warm ups.,1449014400,,100,4.611111111111111

8246773,4,B0012LRMWU,"I carried this to the after school program where I volunteer.  The children danced with it and had a good time, but the energy blasts only last about 1 minute each and then the introduction to the next one takes about 10 seconds.  It does a good job of teaching the steps that the children can follow.",1411776000,,301,4.2631578947368425
8246774,2,B0012LRMWU,Disappointing. Each workout is so short and does not flow well. My grade school children did not get engaged with it,1403913600,,116,4.571428571428571
8246775,2,B0012LRMWU,"Not what I needed. Choppy, kids get into the video action stops with another introduction....more action would be nice. Thanks",1388620800,,126,5.35
8246776,3,B0012LRMWU,I have two boys with no shortage of energy. I wanted a way to for them to get some energy out on those days when weather wasn't the greatest to play outside. This does the trick for the 5 year old. I think if I let him he would do the video from beginning to end. The older boy he's 9 gets bored with it very quickly. He seems to have more fun doing a dance game on the Wii or Playstation. I should also note that my wife uses this in a classroom setting on the rainy day schedules. She has found success with it in that particular setting. 3 stars is the overall score. I'd give it 5 for the 6yr old and under crowd. 1 star for the 9 and up kids. (To be fair though it does state it is for kids 4-8),1387065600,2,700,3.7687074829931975
8246777,3,B0012LRMWU,"My kids enjoy these blasts, but they only last 90 seconds and then you have to wait for the next one to load, even if you choose the play all option. I thought they would be simultaneous so the kids could do as many as they want without stopping, but there aren't. The pause isn't that long, but it is just enough to make the kids think it is over and that they can stop until they learn the drill. I do like the instructor and the great messages she gives the kids while they are working out. She tells them the importance of staying active and how they need to be a role model for others, she is great.",1331769600,,604,4.041666666666667
8246778,1,B0012LRMWU,"I bought this for my grandchildren who are 9 and 4 years old.  They didn't like it at all.  When I was over there yesterday I tried watching it with my 4 year old grandson. We were both so bored with it.  He lost interest (as did I) after about two minutes so I don't know if it got any better.  I would hope so but if it doesn't grab their attention right away, it's not going to work!  How disappointing since the reviews I read were so good.  What a waste of money!",1232755200,2,468,3.925531914893617
