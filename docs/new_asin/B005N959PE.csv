4844865,5,B005N959PE,"Thanks to NPR.com and The Bridge School, for the past two hours, I have been listening to the early listen of this extraordinary compilation of the some of the best music and musicians of the past 50 years! The sound quality is magnificent!  I attended the M.U.S.E Concert at this venue (Mountain View CA) this past September and some of the songs have the exact acoustical reproduction that puts me back into the arena! I can't wait to see the DVD's  Great music, great historical album, and money to a GREAT cause. Buy ten and give them away to friends and relatives and strangers this coming holiday season. Peace",1319328000,21,616,4.6422018348623855
4844866,5,B005N959PE,"My preorder off the NY/Warners website just arrived today. Just finished watching the first two of three DVDs, the two devoted to the concert performances themselves. The third, as the Amazon description aptly describes here, is a behind-the-scenes look at the school itself and the parents and kids, all of whom benefit from the proceeds of this purchase. Each performance is introduced by these 'complex' kids, a moving testament itself to the great work done by the Bridge School. You can sense their excitement as they take turns priming us for a string of amazing performances by a mind-blowing lineup of talent.

It's hard to know where to begin. Each incredible performance just whets your appetite for a full-length set, or full concert videos. Highlights abound but surprisingly for me, the songs done by Metallica, Disposable Heroes, and Dave Matthews, Too Much, really stood out. Don't get me wrong. I'm not even an album buying fan of either artist, but their incredible energy made these acoustic performances sizzle. Other artists including Bob Dylan, Tom Waits, Tom Petty, Bruce Springsteen, and Patti Smith (and of course a 1989 version of 'Crime in the City' by Neil) put on great shows. Bands like The Who, Pearl Jam, R.E.M., The Pretenders, and Brian Wilson's version of the Beach Boys' 'Surfin USA', are great fun to watch. Duets by Emmylou & Buddy Miller, Gillian Welch and Dave Rawlings, Elton John & Leon Russell, and of course, Simon & Garfunkel, who do a crazy-ass great version of 'America', are all fine as a superbly aged wine. I'd go on but I'm still letting it all sink in and a second viewing is imminent.

Slam dunk recommendation. Just buy this and/or better still, buy a ticket to the Benefit if you're within striking distance of Mtn. View. It's an unequivocally good cause and organization and a great venue. Been lucky enough to attend a handful of these over the years, and actually bought this counting on seeing McCartney with Tony Bennett from 2004. Alas, that didn't make the cut, but Paul does a pretty great version of 'Get Back' from that year. Looking forward to getting to the CDs which evidently contain plenty more great tunes in addition to those on the DVDs.

Anyway, just get it. If you've grown up like I have with most of these amazing artists, you'll be completely satisfied. One last note. I watched the DVDs on my home system, (featuring a nice pair of classic mid-70s Advent speakers), and was happy to hear and see that Neil and his 'Because Sound Matters' crew paid strict attention to the 24bit 96kHz audio track. It's, as they state and more, 256 times the resolution of a CD. Going into the 'More' feature of the DVD gets you to the audio info, color bars, and test tone for what that's worth. You also can find menus listing all artists from A to Z as well as lineups from each concert beginning from the Oct. 13th, 1986 benefit to the 2010 show last year.

I don't have a ticket for this coming weekend's shows, but watching this was the next best thing. Enjoy.

10/29 Final Impressions

In a comment left on this review and in other reviews, there has been mention of the 4:3 aspect ratio. A few people are clearly disappointed by this. I must admit that I noticed it and wondered about it for about half a minute. Then I didn't. I even forgot to mention it in my 'first impressions' review. My final impression is that if you care that much about DVD aspect ratio, maybe you should go elsewhere. That would be a shame, though. These performances completely transcend that. They are fantastic and clearly about the school and the work it's doing for the kids. Kudos again to all involved for a heartfelt, job well-done.

p.s. Thanks to Pegi & Neil for the live streaming (16:9 to the best of my recollection, by the way) video this year. For those of us who couldn't go, it was a treat to watch (and know how to donate) from the comforts of home.",1319241600,76,3912,4.644508670520231
4844867,5,B005N959PE,"I've seen on video and heard some of the performances from this yearly event---once in a lifetime performances by artists you would never think of pairing up.  $26.99--you've got to be kidding me.  The idea of the radio stations giving them away as prizes is a great one.  However, something tells me there would be too many people wanting to get their hands in the pot.  I mean look at Live Aid and The Concert For Bangledesh.  All that money and almost zero got to the people who needed it.  Times have changed and I hope we've learned.  I'm confident the people involved in this will make sure the money from the sale of this through Amazon and other retailers will get where it's supposed to go.
I think the thing to do is everyone who is purchasing a copy for themselves, purchase two and give one to a brother, sister, or friend and introduce them to this more than worthy cause.  Who knows, stranger things have worked.",1317340800,8,926,4.470238095238095

4844869,5,B005N959PE,"This will be amazing from what I've seen from the Previews. I agree with the previous comment, this is way too inexpensive. Not only for a benifit of this magnitude, but also a three DVD set. I will be popping over to the website for the balance. Will you?",1317081600,7,256,4.244897959183674

4844882,1,B005N959PE,"I was expecting a 3 dvd concert of the best of 25 years .  It was awful.  Not that many songs,  Had clips that are from the 90's expected something more recent.  If that is the best Neil could come up with that is a shame.
I thought it was going to be something like Crossroad concerts by  Clapton or Concert for George, or Love for Levon on saving the barn.
I will think twice before buying any other Bridge School Concert Dvds",1395100800,,428,4.108433734939759

4844884,1,B005N959PE,I tried to transfer the DVD onto my iPod and it wouldn't go. They must have put a copyright block on the DVD because of the artists. Buyer beware.,1379980800,,146,4.068965517241379
4844885,3,B005N959PE,"Visually the early performances are a great look back into the era of long/big hair, untrimmed beards, bandanas, tie-dyed t-shirts and the protest folk-rock culture. Many of the performances could have been from Woodstock, except instead of drugged out free-loving hippies we have adults of all ages, many with severely handicapped children and similarly afflicted adults as well. So far it makes sense as these are Benefit concerts. Trouble is, the majority of the music has a definite sad and bitter edge to it as if the musicians are ""depressed"" by their surroundings or are ""protesting"" the afflictions they're there to support rather than a celebration of Life, Support and HOPE. There are exceptions, such as David Bowie and surprisingly Patty Smith, and many others. I don't regret buying it for the option of playing ""selected"" performances from these days-gone-by artists but couldn't watch the entire thing without visions of Doctor Kevorkian.",1358035200,2,953,5.276315789473684

4844887,5,B005N959PE,"I knew that Neil Young did some benefit concerts for some kind of school, but I had no idea what that entailed until I received this as a gift and watched it.  This is an absolutely beautiful project that he helps fund.  The interview disc alone is enough for a 5 star rating.  The concert footage from over the years is just an added bonus.  If the Bridge School put out a DVD set every year of their concerts, I would buy it.  My only want is that more acts were included in this DVD set.  Highly recommended and for a great cause.",1351468800,2,533,4.12621359223301

4844892,5,B005N959PE,"After witnessing two Bridge Benefit shows ('98 and'99) first hand, I have a personal connection to this collection of outstanding performances!  In particular, R.E.M. w/ Neil doing Country Feedback was nothing short of amazing!  The work that is done by this charity and the participation of some of our most renown artists is just a testament to the importance here.  IMHO, this is a time capsule of great musicians and songs.  My only regret is that it isn't a 6 DVD collection.  Maybe someday Neil will open the vault again and let us peer into more.  I highly recommend everyone experience one of these shows in their lives.",1328918400,4,628,4.768518518518518

4844894,4,B005N959PE,"Not only is this a splendid overview of the performers and performances of this wonderful tradition, but the warm and yet serious disc showing the reason and results for the Bridge School families is very good, too.  A wonderful show that you can be narrow about and just groove on the music or open up to the real possibilities of music in and of the real life of people.",1325894400,3,372,4.391304347826087

4844899,4,B005N959PE,"I have long waited for this DVD release and I was pleasantly surprised with both the quality of the sound and the video.  I don't believe, and please correct me if I'm wrong, that was Neil's intention to capture these events for future packaging and resale.  Given this, the videography was better than I expected and the sound more than adequate.  The way the DVD is structured doesn't make this a perfect viewing experience as artists have a single song to perform and the result is somewhat choppy and the performances are a little uneven...These are very small complaints - It's a great cause by a great artist..Buy it and enjoy it yourself...",1322438400,8,647,4.707964601769912

4844904,2,B005N959PE,"The videos and music are restricted to two of the three CDs.  The third is just filler.  The videos are marginally entertaining, once.

The alleged 24-bit, 96 kHz music, which was the main reason why I bought this, turns out to be nothing more than up-sampled 44.1 kHz tracks.  The rest is devoid of any signal.  In other words, it is essentially fraudulent labeling.

If two 1 hour CD quality audio/video archives is all you want, then you will be happy.

I sure hope most of my money went mainly to the Bridge School.  In retrospect, I wish I had just cut them a check and skipped this DVD.",1320969600,6,592,4.36697247706422

Video - 4:3 (concert disks)
Audio - 2.0 PCM

Lot's of old clips from the 80's and 90's. You can imagine the quality transfer from those old video tapes. These 'clip's are like what you see on late night TV. The value for today's market is zero.

4844910,5,B005N959PE,"The Bridge School Benefit concerts have long been the highlight of the musical season here in the Bay Area. Im glad they are finally getting the DVD treatment and hope the Youngs will eventually release entire shows in this format. My favorite was Bridge #2, held indoors at the Oakland Coliseum in 1987. Among the highlights of that show--Dylan reaching back to his early catalogue and mesmerizing the crowd with just his guitar on nuggets like ""Gates of Eden""; Nils Lofgren's show-stealing ""Dreams Die Hard"" and the delightful pairing of Neil(on harp)and fellow local legends, Jerry Garcia and Bob Weir, on a wonderfully ragged version of Howlin' Wolf's ""Wang Dang Doodle."" Other locals also regularly put in appearances, like Tom Waits, who rarely tours and Metallica, Green Day and Santana, who are best known for their electric music. Personal favorites include the Simon and Garfunkle reunion and the entire Warren Zevon set during the 1993 show. The concert now spans two days and this weekend the lineup included old veterans, like Eddie Vedder, Dave Matthews and Foo Fighters, as well as some newcomers, like Arcade Fire. (You can read a review of this year's show in the Oct. 24, SF Chonicle). Neil and Pegi have done a great service for these kids and one can feel the love, even from the cheap seats, when they join the musicians onstage. I hope the release of this music will further their good work and look forward to more releases from the vault.",1319414400,4,1462,4.852
