8247526,5,B0012RR3D2,"A young woman's grandmother goes missing, after talking about a local theater and some strange incidents that happened years before. The girl goes to the theater and, upon finding no concrete evidence her grandmother was there, hires on as a ticket taker to investigate further. It's not long before she discovers the theater is haunted by the ghosts of a soldier, an opera queen, a disgraced actress and a Beetlejuice-type character. The ensemble serenade the girl with songs about their past lives and how they've come to be here in this theater.

Meanwhile, with her grandmother still missing, the girl must unravel a mystery behind the theater and a forbidden movie thought to be lost long ago.....

For the record, I hate musicals of almost all kinds on film. But the music here is so fantastically deranged and creatively performed that you just can't help but fall in love with the characters and sing along with the lyrics. The Beetlejuice guy frequently steals the show but even the disgraced actress has her turn. Do yourself a favor and don't miss the translated lyrics. You can see some of the music on YouTube if you look up The Ghost Theater but you don't get the translation. This film is a must-have for the weird and the wonderful; trust me.",1336089600,4,1258,4.76605504587156
