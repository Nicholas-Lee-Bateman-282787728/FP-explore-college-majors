580419,5,6303145884,"The thing I enjoy about The Dominators is that it doesn't hold back being politically true, proving flower power to be oxymoronic.  You won't find the John Lennon weed-smoking, ""imagine"" crowd glorified in this tale.  The Dulcians, with emphasis on the first syllable (dull) are portrayed as a bunch of beatniks who wouldn't lift a finger, let alone a weapon, to save their hide. They abolished all weapons long ago, and set up a museum on an island which was once used as a nuclear test site as a reminder of the ""evils"" of aggression. When faced with a potential threat, they waste time in hours of pointless debate and end up doing nothing, allowing their planet to be overrun by the aggressive Dominators.  The Dulcians are a great representation of the left in this country, who think negotiating with those that don't understand negotiation should be our only course of action against fundamental extremists who'd like nothing better than to destroy our way of life. In this respect, the story provides us with a glimpse of consequence if the left get their way.

It is only the Doctor's party who steps up to run the bullies off the planet. Most of the Dulcians are the Kumbaya type, satisfied to accept anything presented to them as fact, without questioning inconsistencies.  As the pevious review states, somehow if the Dominators did destroy the planet as was their intention, you'd have a hard time sympathizing.  The only Dulcian with any self-pride and courage to fight back, Cully, is considered an outcast and ridiculed by Dulcian society. Yet it is this attitude possesed by Cully that prevents Dulkis from total destruction.

Writers Haisman and Lincoln (unbilled in the credits as they had a squabble with production over having their story, originally a six-parter, sliced down to five) explode a nuclear bomb on pacifism, a refreshing change from most purely fantasy moral messages in Doctor Who.  Pacifism works if and only if everyone around you accepts that principle.  If not, pacifists will be dominated.",1187481600,8,2030,4.947058823529412

Troughton is the best Dr and this is an entertaining 5 parter that shows Troughton off as a mixed bag of fun and fear.
The story sees dastardly dominators who aim to destroy a planet with a nuclear bomb in order to fuel their star fleet.
The Doctor, with Jamie and new recruit Zoe manage to thwart their plans but not without a great deal of team work and action. With Jamie out and about exploding Quarks the Dominators is an entertaining tale to the end.",1080518400,4,524,4.526315789473684
580422,4,6303145884,"First transmitted August 10 through September 7 1968 in England, this is a traditional Doctor Who quarry story. Actually they spend more time in this particular quarry than in practically every other Doctor Who story.
The tale is a relatively simple one, a spacecraft lands accidentally on a planet thought to be uninhabited. The lifeforms, Dominators, are in need of an unknown fuel source with the aid of the robot QUARKS and that would be that except for the fact that the planet is not uninhabited, there are humanoids who are a peace  loving race in the aftermath of an atomic debacle and then there is the Doctor, Jamie and Zoe.
To all intents and purposes it is a standard story of peace versus war with the Doctor forced tom act to free the Dulcians from evil and oppression. Nothing is quite so simple. The Dominators are cast as evil but in fact there is a trainee, a cold blooded, rash killer of everything he sees. His mentor, although a believer of the mental and physical superiority of the Dominators, is a different creature with a more 'noble' purpose. His consideration for life is more of a calculation than an emotional atttachment and the quest for domination of the universe is to bring order to all things. The destruction of the Dominators is more of a tragedy to be mourned rather than a triumph of good over evil.
The Dulcians are foppish and cowardly unlike the Thals of the Dead Planet and do not have the stomach to fight even for themselves. Science has resulted in an indifference to real new knowledge and has been replaced with a Disneyesque view of the world.
Patrick Troughton is admirable throughout and Zoe, despite the high intellect for which she is renowned as a Doctor companion, is again more of a visual aspect rather than a contributor. The story could have done with some tougher editing too.",1025308800,4,1837,4.669753086419753
580423,1,6303145884,"The majority of Patrick Troughton's stories as Dr Who are either incomplete or missing entirely from the BBC Archives. After watching  ""The Dominators"" I can only conclude what a tragedy it is that  this survives while others are lost. It is tedious all the way through. The  Dominators are unconvincing and unengaging aliens/villains who look like a  cross between Quasimodo and Humpty Dumpty - if their feuding between  themselves is meant to be an interesting plot device, it doesn't work.  (Ronald Allen, who plays Rago, is much better as Ralph Cormish in the Jon  Pertwee story ""The Ambassadors of Death"".) The Quarks are  laughable. They are meant to be killer robots, but their slow, comic  movements and high pitched shrill voices make them more cute than anything  else. All the Dulcian characters are uninteresting, one dimensional, bland  and irritating. The pace of the story drags from the opening moments and  lumbers its way through five ponderous episodes. Not Dr Who at its best.",948067200,11,996,5.042944785276074

580529,3,6303145884,"The doctor lands on a planet that is 100% peaceful, totally pacifistic. For a little rest and relaxation. What he does not know is that the Dominators, members of a warrior race have not only landed same planet, but the same island the doctor has landed on, with their killer robots (quarks). The quarks were supposed to be a replacement for the Daleks, which were unavailable to Dr. Who due to BBC creating a series out of the Daleks. The quarks were however, ridiculous at best, goofy and unfrightening. This had a lot to do with their size and ability, they had limited mobility, their arms were almost useless, and they were very small. This story is 5 episodes long. ***Spoiler Alert *** The group goes exploring and finds a bomb shelter with a weapon in it. There they also find 2 dummy's and soon realize this is an atom bomb testing zone. They run into others who are on the island in a research center. Soon, Zoe goes with one of them to the capital, to be followed by the doctor and Jaimie. But, the doctor and Jaimie are captured by the Dominators. Acting stupid, they are set free. In the meantime the dominators are looking for somewhat intelligent slave labor. The dominators true goal is the convert the planet into atomic fuel, thus killing everyone on the planet.  Eventually, the Dominators get Zoe and some of the research group to become their slave labor. It's up to Jaime and the doctor to save them before the Dominators turn the planet into a giant radioactive ball of dust. While the doctor is trying to prevent the total destruction of the planet, Jaimie is off distracting the Dominators, with aggressive means.

***Spoiler Alert Over***

This is far from the best Dr. Who, but also far from the worst Dr. Who story. It's OK. It's not that Patrick Troughton was bad in this one, he is who he is. As a Doctor, he is still becoming the Dr. that he will become. And, as Doctors go, he was never the best Doctor, but he was sufficient to play the part. Has he done better stories, certainly. If you are a collector of everything Dr. Who, then you will want it for your collection. If not then you may want to skip this one.  Or at least, wait for it to drop in price.

580532,4,6303145884,"This is one of the few remaining complete Second Doctor serials which examines the effect of a war-like race of ""Dominators"" landing on a planet populated by an advanced race of pacifist. The doctor and TARDIS crew find themselves pitted against the invaders to protect the planet from enslavement and devastation. This serial introduces the mechanical Quarks, who are the hench-robots who serve the Dominators. While this might not be the best Second Doctor story in existence, it is entertaining and quite watchable.

The special features are interesting, and include the history of the planned development of Quark-related merchandise. This was doomed by disagreements over rights between the creators and the BBC, which resulted in the writers being black-listed from future efforts. This scuttled a planned final script for Jamie to return to the Highlands and face an alien menace in his family home.

580605,4,6303145884,"This is more for those that had a problem with Matt Smith letting the villain in the Dinosaurs on a Spaceship episode go and blow up. If you watch the Dominators that is what Patrick does; rolls the bomb into the villain's ship as it is taking off. He seems rather pleased with himself even, just like Matt did. So there, critics who say the Doctor is being mean in his old age. Mean has nothing to do with it. Justice is fair. The Time Lords were non-interfering and that's what the Doctor could not stand. He left because the good guys never had a chance against boneheads like the Dominators. Although the Doctor always seems to just stumble into these situations that call for a hero, he is not going out looking to save the universe, he's done that. The Dominators was slow, but funny to watch garbage cans get blown up and tipped over, silly men yelling at each other in armadillo suits, always fun to watch Pat and Jamie together.

580607,2,6303145884,"""The Dominators"" is perhaps the weakest of the Doctor's adventures from the Patrick Troughton years to escape erasure from the BBC archives. The story, co-written by Mervyn Haisman and Henry Lincoln, was suggested by the burgeoning peace movement of the late '60s: What if a totally pacifist society were threatened by its ideological opposite, belligerent invaders dedicated to waging war?

The Doctor, Jamie and Zoe land on the pacifist planet Dulkis at about the same time the war-loving Dominators and their crew of robotic servants, the Quarks, touch down to size up the planet as a possible power source for their space fleet. The production was in trouble from the start because script editor Derrick Sherwin was waging a war of his own with his writers over rewrites they ultimately refused to make, forcing Sherwin to shorten the story by an episode, thus creating production problems for the following sequence, ""The Mind Robber"" (see my review).

Meanwhile, the writers, Haisman and Lincoln, were negotiating with toymakers to make the Quarks the next big marketing phenomenon after the Daleks, which creator Terry Nation had spirited away from the BBC to start his own movie franchise. Two problems: (A) the Quarks were NOT the next Daleks; and (B) the BBC disputed the writers' intellectual property rights to their creation. The legal wrangling forever poisoned any future the writers might have had with the series.

Perhaps the biggest reason the Quarks were a flop was that they were designed by the costume designer, Martin Baugh, not series designer Barry Newbery. They were essentially iceboxes with stubby legs with much the same mobility problems on set as the Daleks. The Dulcians' costumes, meanwhile, resembled living-room curtains bunched up under the arms and gathered at the waist for men and cut into revealing, baby-doll nightie-style dresses for the women--it was perhaps the worst fashion catastrophe in series history.

Finally, the plot is simply silly even if you make the usual allowances for the fact that this is Doctor Who: an entire planet is threatened by two tall men made up to look like the butler Lurch if he had used Grecian Formula, and a horde of pint-sized robots, of which we see only three at a time (because there were only three!). The Dominators spend the first four episodes or so experimenting to see whether the Dulcians might make good slaves but then don't really use them. Instead, it's the Quarks who drill boreholes in the planet to turn it into a radioactive molten mass the Dominators can use for fuel. Whatever.

The Special Features include the usual, workmanlike ""making of"" documentary, plus a ho-hum retrospective on press coverage of the show during the Second Doctor's tenure. For some reason, this is narrated by Caroline John, who had nothing to do with the Second Doctor but played Liz Shaw, the first companion to the Third Doctor.",1303862400,3,2906,5.033264033264033
580608,2,6303145884,"The Dominators: the opening story of Patrick Troughton's final season as the second Doctor. By all accounts the story should have been a good one when you consider it was written by Mervyn Haisman and Henry Lincoln (the team behind the two successful yeti stories The Abominable Snowmen and The Web Of Fear), was directed by Morris Barry (who had directed the Cybermen stories The Moonbase and The Tomb Of The Cybermen) and featured the TARDIS crew of the second Doctor, Jamie and Zoe. The result though is perhaps the least successful of the surviving intact Troughton era stories.

Certainly this is not the fault of the TARDIS crew. In fact the combination of Troughton's Doctor, Fraser Hines' Jamie and Wendy Padbury's Zoe are perhaps the biggest redeeming aspect of the story. This was the first story for them as a team (as Zoe had been introduced in the previous story The Wheel In Space) but all ready there is a strong sense of chemistry amongst the team starting from the moment they arrive with the Doctor getting ready for a beach holiday right up until the final scenes of episode five. Indeed they don't enter the story until nearly ten minutes into the first episode and the story works best when they are on screen. Unfortunately they can't make up for the rest of the story's faults on their own.

The supporting cast representing the invaded Dulcians are functional at best and weak at worst. On the functional end are Johnson Bayly as Educator Balan, Arthur Cox as Cully and Walter Fitzgerald as Director Senex whose performances are exactly that: functional. The rest of the cast though give weak performances, including Felicity Gibson as Kando and  Giles Block as Teel who occupy so much of the story's run time. That's not to mention the story's weakest aspects.

Those would be its villains: the titular Dominators and their robotic minions the Quarks. Both seemed like a good idea on paper but their execution was far from it. The two Dominators, Ronald Allen as Rago and Kenneth Ives as Toba, do little more then march around, argue with one another and issue orders to their minions though both actors project a fair amount of menace in doing so. Their robotic minions the Quarks are much less successful. By the admission of co-writer  Mervyn Haisman on a documentary found elsewhere on the DVD, the Quarks were created with the intention of replacing the Daleks as the series most popular monster. Watching the story it isn't hard to see why that didn't happen. The Quarks lack menace thanks to their short stature, their obvious difficulty in movement and their ridiculous voices which range from comical to difficult to understand. Put together they form the weakest aspect of a weak story.

Other aspects of the story are fairly weak. The design work, in both sets and costumes, is fairly weak and the costumes in particular date this story to the late 1960s with even male characters running around in dresses for lack of a better word. The special effects are another weak aspect of the story, especially the model shots that open the story and the shots of the travel capsule in flight which look like they were stolen from a 1930s Flash Gordon serial or the like. Morris Barry's direction, which had served the two previous Cybermen stories he directed well, seems far less effective here as the story moves along at a slow pace though there is some effective use of close-ups occasionally. The result is a weak even boring story.

Which brings us to the script. Though written by Mervyn Haisman and Henry Lincoln, the story is credited to Norman Ashby due to the duo's difficulty with the Doctor Who production team over changes to the story. The biggest change was the story being turned into a five part story instead of six which seems to have been a smart decision in the long run. 1960s television tended to be stagey and dialogue heavy and The Dominators is a perfect example of how this could harm a production. The story is dominated (no pun intended) by scenes of characters sitting (standing in the case of the Dominators) around talking. The story's theme of pacifism versus militarism is highlighted by that fact and that is not a good thing. The Dulcian council sits around throughout the entire story and does nothing but debate how to deal with the Dominators invasion even after the Dominators arrive in the council's chamber. The dialogue is often cliched, such as Cully spending much of the story talking about ""Dulcian this, Dulcian that."" The result is the least successful of the duo's script and one of the weakest scripts of the Troughton era.

The DVD presentation of the story is fantastic and more then worthy of the story. The restoration of the story itself by the Restoration Team is a testament to them especially when compared to the less then satisfactory version of the story released on VHS here in the States back in 1994. There's a nice making of documentary Recharge and Equalise which reveals the troubled writing of the story, how it derailed plans for a yeti story to conclude the Troughton era and the fact that almost nobody interviewed looks upon the story that greatly. Much the same can be said of the audio commentary that is moderated by Toby Hadoke and features Frazer Hines, Wendy Padbury, Giles Block, Arthur Cox and make-up designer Sylvia James. Add on the usual special features you can expect on a original series Who DVD and the result is that the story gets perhaps a presentation that's more then worthy of it.

On paper, The Dominators must have seemed a good idea yet its execution is lacking in almost every way. Indeed of the six surviving intact Troughton stories (the others being Tomb Of The Cybermen, The Mind Robber, The Krotons, The Seeds Of Death and The War Games) this is perhaps the weakest of them as a result. The story is successful in domination...by boredom only.",1299715200,3,5876,4.758586849852797
580609,5,6303145884,Another great Troughton episode.  So glad that BBC can continue to put out these great shows seeing as how so many were originally thrown out and destroyed.

580610,4,6303145884,"I'm really glad I watched this story now when I'm older. The idea and concept this story represents is very interesting. What would happen to a completely pacifist society if they were invaded by a ""dominating"" race. Well The Dominators answers this question for you.
If you can get past the cheap sets and lame special effects (and lets face it, if you buy a classic who story and are surprised by this you really have no idea what your purchasing) then the story itself is really well worth a watch. The dialog is great and The Dominators themselves are for a 60's villain pretty imposing. The major drawbacks to this serial were the costumes and the Quarks. Just really lame work even by Doctor Who's standards of the day.
Still this serial is one of the few surviving stories from the Troughton era, and though it would be wonderful to see Power of the Daleks or The Highlanders we have to appreciate what is available.
 The documentary is funny and it amazes me how these actors recall so much from the time of production. I have to dissagree with the original author of the script though, he lamented that this story survived over others, I think The Dominators is a fine example of a story that although may go over the heads of some children it is definately something that you can appreciate later on watching again as you get older.",1295395200,4,1342,4.545454545454546
580611,4,6303145884,"I've seen ""The Dominators"" exactly twice. Once was this week after I got my copy. The other time was way back when, in the late 1980's. I didn't remember much about the story, but I did remember those shoulders (oh, god, those shoulders!), and the Quarks. I also remember it being not very good. Turns out memory can play tricks on you. Yes, the shoulders are still horrible, and the Quarks are still... well, quarky. But the story is much better than I'd remembered!

The TARDIS drops our travelers on a merry little island that was once used to test a nuclear bomb. So horrified was the race that built it that they immediately stopped making any weapons and became total pacifists. Now into their little paradise arrive the Dominators, a group that controls the better part of ten galaxies, has several robot servants and really needs a fashion designer. Of course Jamie, Zoe and the Doctor are there to put a stop to the Dominators plans to... er... dominate.

Watching it now, I was impressed by the layers to this story. The Dominators could have easily been very two-dimensional, but they are surprisingly interesting, especially the power-play that goes on between the commander and his boom-happy subordinate. I also liked that the pacifist people basically shrug and say, ""Well, they're not much we can do about this. We're totally $%!#ed."" Plus of course Jamie and the Doctor are always great to see up on scree. Yes, even in the otherwise dismal ""The Two Doctors"".

What doesn't really work in this story are the Quarks. Oh, they aren't bad or anything. Their design is interesting, and they obviously have some real firepower. But... those voices... and they're just so darn CUTE! Apparently they were designed as a new enemy whose popularity would rival that of the Daleks! Well, I think we all know how that turned out.

I liked this story enough that I'd really like to see a new series follow-up. Imagine what Moffat could do with the Dominators and the Quarks. He specializes in taking the cute, the ordinary and the harmless and making it deadly and scary. I'm sure he could really work wonders with this!

In addition to the story, you get the usual raft of extras. There's audio commentary, text commentary, behind-the-scenes stuff and a new feature called ""Tomorrow's Times"". The concept of that (showing contemporary media coverage of the series), is a very good one. The execution, with Caroline ""Liz Shaw"" John sitting there and acting like a news-reader... well, it needs some work.

Other than that, this is a really great buy!",1294963200,,2554,4.806378132118451

Because of the popularity of Patrick Troughton, and the scarcity of complete surviving Troughton stories, Dominators gets a kind of a free pass with fans. And that's OK, but a casual fan could be mislead by the reviews for this story and wind up buying something that could put them off Troughton's era, or 60s Who in general.
The truth is, The Dominators has nothing going for it, other than five more episodes of Patrick Troughton's wonderful performance.
Watching paint dry would be like a ride on the outside of a rocket compared to sitting through these 5 mind-numbingly dull, mostly poorly acted, indifferently directed episodes.
The Quarks are terrible. They are short, barely mobile, unintelligible, and look like beat-up second hand furniture.
