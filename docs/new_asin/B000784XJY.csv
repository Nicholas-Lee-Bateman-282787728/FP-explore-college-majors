SYNOPSIS--
Red North (Willis) runs a small airborne delivery service in the Canadian wilderness town of Nouvelle. Red's business and personal life are disrupted when half-brother Paul Girard (La Rue) makes a move on both his shipping territory and schoolteacher girlfriend Hilary Ward (Hudson). These are acts of revenge for an incident that occurred between Red and Paul during WWII.

Hilary's brother Chuck (Perry) is also Red's mechanic. Hilary blames Red for not being available to fly after Chuck is killed in an air crash caused by highly volatlle nitrol compound. Red takes to the bottle when she leaves him. Thus,  Paul is asked to transport scarlet fever vaccine to a lumber camp. Hilary offers to navigate for him. The medicine is successfully dropped and soon after, their plane develops engine trouble...

""Bush Pilot"" offers the scenic beauty of rural Ontario and a well-scripted good guy/bad guy plot with a somewhat predictable ending. No filler and a one-hour running time are pluses.

ALPHA VIDEO offers bargain priced, often hard-to-find vintage movies that are ideal for those willing to skip DVD extras. Their transfers show no evidence of restoration, so quality varies from one title to the next, with ""fair to good"" being the average.
