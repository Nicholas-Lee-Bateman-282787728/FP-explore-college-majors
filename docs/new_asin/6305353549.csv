The story begins with a obsessed bride to-be and an equally obessed group of friends of  the groom to party  till you die, literally.

This movie also challenges what is considered funny. I  laughed, and yet - it was a guilty feeling, for you could not help but  question how you could laugh at this gruesome scenario.

Though, this one is a true black comedy with gory, cruel scenes. The characters are too loud and erratic to care for and everyone gives the same performance, shout your lines and it will be funny, but it's really annoying. There was the scene where the guys were partying in the hotel and C.Slater was talking, I think it was supposed to be funny but I couldn't hear him over the music. A waste. I like all the actors though. I think the dancers death happened too soon. The movie seemed to drag after that, I would've had it in the middle somewhere to hold the movie together.

1013558,4,6305353549,"Very Bad Things (Peter Berg, 1998)
[originally posted 22Oct2000]

Very Bad Things? Very good film.

Before going any further, let me clarify, since you may be asking yourself: yes, THAT Peter Berg. Dr. Kronk.

This movie is risky as hell. Berg, who both wrote and directed, was out to redefine the black comedy as we know it. And when you get that black, you get into territory where you're almost certain to lose your audience. But in this case, Berg's determination to cross that line, and to cross it as often as necessary, turns the film from a typical black comedy into something worth watching.

Kyle (Jon Favreau) is getting married to Laura (Cameron Diaz). His best man, Robert Boyd (Christian Slater), and a few of their pals decide to take Kyle to Vegas for his bachelor party. During the festivities, a prostitute dies by accident. From there on, the film details what they decide to do with the body, and how it affects each of the party members. Doesn't sound like gut-wrenchingly funny stuff, does it? But Berg consistently goes over the top with it, sometimes more subtly than others. I've got one of the sickest senses of humor I know, and I found the chuckles few and far between until about a half hour before the end of the film, but that didn't bother me much. The interaction between the characters was absorbing enough to keep me interested until the laughs started coming regularly. And when they do, boy do they ever. You're left at the end of this film thinking that it was a two-hour shaggy dog joke, that the whole film was built around what may be one of the most hysterical-- and memorable-- final scenes in all of filmdom. But this is one of those jokes where the punchline is so perfect that you don't mind having to listen to two hours of setup. It's certainly not for everyone, but if you like your humor just this side of insanity, you'll laugh as hard as I did at that last scene. *** ",1387152000,,1920,4.521613832853026
1013559,5,6305353549,"This is my favorite funny movie. Funny in a sad way. Starts off slow but soon you won't be able to go to the bathroom if you had to. A lot of ""oh my God's.""",1385424000,,156,3.4857142857142858
1013660,1,6305353549,"This movie has been labeled a dark (black) comedy? Really? REALLY? It's dark alright, but there were definitely no funny parts in it. I didn't laugh once. Or smile. Or even grin faintly. No, I half take that back, the part about it being funny. You might find this movie humorous if you're a sociopath. Or a psychopath who moonlights as a serial killer. As for the rest of us, well, it's revolting from beginning to end. Also, and this can't be stressed enough...this movie has the most ANNOYING characters in the history of forever. 90% of their dialogue is spent screaming, bickering and blubbering, blubbering, bickering, and screaming, bickering, screaming, and blubbering. I hated every last one of them, and you will too, because they will get on your LAST nerve. A well known/respected reviewer said, ""If you enjoyed this movie, it says things about you that I don't want to know!"" And I agree with that assessment 100%.

1013662,5,6305353549,"I've never seen anything like it.  I'm convinced in its first release it did not get the critical acclaim or box office bucks it deserved.  Hands down, its better than HANGOVER, which was also very good, and I'm wondering if that film wasn't based on Very Bad Things.

I'd like to speak to Peter Berg, the Director, and ask him if he realized how phenomenal his efforts were.  I'm actually using his film as a model of how to write and direct.  I think it should be required to watch in all Cinema classes.  And Cameron Diaz, Christian Slater, ALL of the actors were at their very best, and as we know, went on to stardom.

There's one scene in there (I won't give it away), but it was soooo UNEXPECTED and SHOCKING and HILARIOUS, I almost died laughing.  OMG!  If you never see another film again in your life, VERY BAD THINGS is a MUST SEE!",1379116800,,842,4.312101910828026

1013667,2,6305353549,"Very Bad Things is a 1998 dark comedy film written and directed by Peter Berg. This film came out the same year as another notoriously black comedy called Happiness, which I felt was slightly better, and darker, than this film. Very Bad Things stars Jon Favreau and Cameron Diaz as Kyle and Laura, two fiances about to get married, as well as four of Kyle's friends Charles (Leland Orser), Robert (Christian Slater), Adam (Daniel Stern), and Michael (Jeremy Piven). Very Bad Things was a indeed very bad, in my humble opinion. It felt incredibly cruel, annoying, empty, and pathetic, with many pointless scenes, such as the one with Adam and his family at the gas station. For starters, I didn't like any of the characters, especially Laura and Adam, and in more than half of the film the characters are endlessly yelling and screaming to the point that I wanted to rip out their vocal cords. I was pleasantly surprised and even joyful when many of the characters, such as Adam and Robert, died, or met with tragic ends despite still being alive, such as Laura, because they were so annoying and unlikable. I guess the theme of this film is bad things happen to bad people, which is certainly true in real life, so if there are any positives to this film, that is certainly one of them. Also, despite being an apparent comedy, this film rarely made me laugh or even smile, there were a few scenes that did, to be completely honest, but most of the time I was angered and annoyed. Don't waste your time on this film, there are far better comedies, and even dark comedies, out there, so if you pass this one on, you won't be missing anything. The Basic Plot, which consists of events spiraling more and more out of control after the five male characters kill a stripper and security guard at a Las Vegas Hotel where they were having a crazy drunken bachelor party several days before the wedding of Kyle and Laura, is both predictable and cliched. It felt like a darker, less funny, version of The Hangover in many ways. The only thing that kept this film from a one star rating were a few funny scenes and the semi-intelligent theme of bad things happening to bad people, which certainly appeals to me, who is a strong believer in karma and the notion that one reaps what one sows. This film is a prime example of everything that's wrong in the cultural wasteland of modern America. Also if you enjoy dark comedies, a few I would highly recommend would be Arsenic and Old Lace, Little Miss Sunshine, and Dr. Strangelove.",1361145600,,2519,4.575221238938053

1013724,5,6305353549,"I have to say that overall this movie did not fail to surprise me.  I thought the performances were all strong (even Cameron Diaz - I'm not a fan of hers).  Diaz manages to pull off the sweet bride to be, but under the thin veneer of girlish charm - she's a soulless harpie.  She and Slater's performances mirror each others in this film.

The film is about a bachelor party that goes very wrong (don't they all?).  I'm not going to give away too much of the plot.  I personally like Jon Favreau,  Favreau manages to have that ""what the f*** look on his face at every turn, as well he should.  Christian Slater plays the smarmy sociopath that has managed to justify his outlook via motivational/positive thinking.  He tries to put a positive spin on an accidental death and murder that isn't convincing the other characters, but entertaining.  Hence I couldn't complain about his performance.  But perhaps the strongest performance comes from Jeremy Piven.  Even though he plays a supporting character, he manages to be careless, hedonistic, repentant, sympathetic and annoying all at the same time.

You don't see a hint of Ari Gold in this performance, which tells me he is more than able to calibrate his performance to script more than most actors these days.  He's good at playing weasels, but he managed to make Michael both a weasel and sympathetic all at once - bravo!

Overall, if you like dark comedies - you might want to give this one a viewing.",1305590400,,1457,4.63671875
1013725,5,6305353549,"Had never heard of this movie but found it in a national $2 store chain.  I occasionally pick up these that have interesting covers or with big name stars made before they found fame (or lost it as in Slater's case), as they are cheaper than renting a movie.  Usually they are forgettable and you can see why they never made it, but sometimes, as with this great movie, they have just slipped through the cracks somehow.

Basic plot of Very Bad Things revolves around a group of friends who go to Vegas in the days just before a wedding for the bachelor's party.  A drunken mistake ends up with a dead body and I Know What You Did Last Summer style you've got the debate to call the police or dispose of the body and move on with their lives.  While we don't have a fisherman with a hook we have enormous guilt building in some of those who were there, and paranoia that they'll talk to wives or the police by the others.  Throw in Cameron Diaz brilliantly playing the bride from hell who wants a perfect wedding and the tension just gets greater.  Of course she would later make the big time with a little movie also filmed the same year as this (1998) called Something About Mary.

Jon Farveau is the actor playing the groom to be and you'll be watching going, I know him from something, but I don't think he looks like that anymore.  Add on a fair bit of weight, loose most of the hair and add a goatee for some recent stuff and you'll work it out.  So this cheap to buy movie has got that discussion point while watching it factor as well.  Slater plays a brilliant character, if his personal life going off the tracks hadn't sidetracked him out of the big budget films who knows what this 80s early 90s star would have achieved, but it does bring into this nice little film.  Throw in an older Daniel Stern famous for his earlier in the 90s decade work as a simpleton criminal in the Home Alone movies, and sidekick to Crystal in the City Slicker movies, as well as Wonder Years TV show narrator, and you've got a very watchable, albeit violent but very entertaining comedy.",1286582400,,2079,4.343669250645995
1013726,5,6305353549,"Normally, I wouldn't like a dark comedy like this.  I ended up watching it purely by accident.  I was actually surfing the net, the tv had been left on, and this is what came on next.  I found myself continuing to look up at the movie and the next thing I knew, I had moved to the sofa and watched the entire thing.  Having never heard of the movie before, I didn't even realize it was a comedy til about a half hour in.  Everything goes so horribly wrong and you can see how the two slightly normal, decent guys get swept up into the cover-up that continues to blow up in their faces.  I gasped out loud more times than I could count, and then cracked up.  Every couple of years, I dust it off and watch it again and it gets funnier each time.  There are at least 10 classic lines in this movie, from Cameron Diaz ""I will not be common"" to Christian Slater ""I am the Lighthouse"" and my favorite ""I want to hear the truth, and I don't want to hear it from the LIAR""  When they are all leaning on the bathroom door, each characters face and behavior is priceless.  We all know people who embody each of the personalities of these characters.  The eager to please but still immature groom, the somewhat shallow, wedding obsessed bride-zilla, the hard working, serious minded suburban dad, his screw up brother, and the party boy, lying, jerk friend of our hubby that will never grow up that we can't stand and wish would just go away.  Also, the drunk/drugged up friends who are so deep, brilliant, cerebral and worst of all, sentimental when they are gorked out.

I know Hangover was the breakout comedy of the year, and it was funny, but I have to say I watched this again last night and laughed til I teared up.  I can't explain it.  It is horrible really, VERY BAD THINGS they did, but there is true cosmic justice, and after all, it is just a movie, for entertainment, not some movie to learn any morals from.

The reason the movie is sick is because it makes like killing a human being is no big deal.  The men are more concerned covering their tracks and not getting caught then they are feeling emotion over killing people.

Besides the twisted sense of humor, you can also expect lots and lots of arguing involving the group of men.  They constantly argue over who was to blame for the murders, and build up a swear storm trying to calm each other down.  It's funny because they keep picking public places where people can hear them to argue.

I honestly don't know what to think about a movie like this.  On one hand it's funny so the movie is worth watching, but then again, it's never funny to make fun of people dying in tragic ways (and the ending of the movie is almost sickening).

Well, now here's one that feels like doesn't just feel like another machine-made piece from off the assembly line. Here is a movie that feels like it has it's own ideas, thoughts, edges and all.

The studio execuives didn't dig their claws into this one, sucking all the nerve and originality out of it just to make it inoffensive and more filt for mass consumption.

All the more making this a move that's really worth seeing for those who don't like movies that just connect-the-dots and paint-by-numbers. In other words, a movie that desperately needs to exist. And be seen.

A bizzare combo protein-shake of black comedy, thriller and horror show, this is one of those Slow Saturday Night cult films that the weirdo clerk behind the counter is always personally recommending for those customers who ae kind of like his pals.

""Very Bad Things"" is a film that plays out like a worse-case scenerio. One of those movies that puts a group of relative people in a situation where everything that can possibly go wrong... does. Hopefully, with results that translate to a good movie.

I found the movie to work on multiple levels. As an angry, aggressive, and assertive male-bonding comedy. As a thriller. As a white-knuckle, nail-biting action film. As a nightmare.

Writer/Director Peter Berg remarks he came up with the idea for this movie when he was at a bachelor party and saw the rowdy and over-the-top behavior from a lot of the other guests. These guys were looking for trouble, he said. What would happen if they found it? More than they could handle.

The movie is all-over-the-map, but I like that about it. Berg sets up some cynical suburbanites and their rowdy behavior and puts them in several life-or-death situations, which despite what many say, is thrilling to watch.

Christian Slater gives the strongest performance as the devil-may-care Robert Boyd, a man who seems to have no moral threshold. We never doubt his actions for a second. Slater knows how to play this character as plays him to the hilt.

Daniel Stern plays his usual nebbish. From the ""City Slickers"" movies, the ""Home Alone"" movies and all his others, he's appropriately nervous and uneasy--especially after what's occurring right now. There's are massive murders bobbing up and the body count is still rising.

Cameron Diaz is also effective doing an evil turn on the wedding-obsessed loon she was in ""My Best Friend's Wedding"" as a woman who doesn't care about anything else but having her big day. As far as she's concerned, the guests and the groom are secondary. She nitpicks and she bullies and berates. Many guys see this as the epitome of the woman who's about to have her big day.

Jon Faverau isn't as ""money"" as he's been in other roles, but maybe that's because he's supposed to be the straight man. He's a little too straight. Too stiff. You kind of wish they had spiced him up some more. He appears to just be in shock and going along with the flow most of the time, like a tag-along.

The movie plays out as a dark comedic thriller and at times a morality tale. What I like the most is the anarchy of the film and the performance of Christian Slater and especially the different ways the men and women in the movie react to him.

Watch for his scene with Tripplehorn when they go one-on-one. The homages to ""Good Fellas"" and ""Reservior Dogs"" are cute and memorable too.

Like I said before, this is a must-see for anyone who hates generic, paint-by-numbers movies. If this sounds like your cup of tea (and it damn well should), you're someone after my own heart. Then THIS is a must-see.

Next time you're at the video store looking for a movie with huevos that hit hard (but don't worry, not down there exactly)...

Technically, the form is a comedy of manners. The humor, in other words, is neither verbal nor physical, but is built into the situations and the interplay between character and action. (I know, explaining takes the fun out, but if you look at some of the reviews here it's clear some deconstruction is required.)

For example, the villain of the piece (insofar as there is one) is an amped up devotee of a success seminar he's recently attended who uses the lessons learned to cheer-lead his buddies into embarking on a series of senseless murders, each one necessary to cover up the last.

One of the participants is a fanatically religious Jew who, after going along mindlessly with the first two murders, finally throws a temper-tantrum, insisting that the chopped up corpses, neither of them Jewish, be given a burial consistent with Jewish traditions.

The film is chock full of such satirical grace notes. But, you have to pay a little attention in order to see and appreciate them.

I think what's most commendable about 'Very Bad Things', at least for a person like myself, is that this was actor Peter Berg's directorial debut.  Not for its technical virtues, which it does possess, but because Berg created a picture of such grim ferocity, holding back so little and, most dangerously, for entering the directing world with a product that, by its neccessity, was going to receive near unanimous criticism for its ""distaste"".

Here's the thing... Despite the sensationalistic way the film approaches the most horrific of circumstances, I find 'Very Bad Things' almost brings about within me a sense of empathy because, all in all, the five main characters in the film -- a group of old friends -- are not bad people.  Seriously -- how many groups of genuinely decent guys take to Vegas for a buddies' bachelor party?  Furthermore, are they inherently despicable because they're getting loaded, snorting cocaine, and generally acting like crazed little boys the night of the event?  Oh, but one of them is pounding a prostitute -- if none of the other characteristics qualify at making someone evil, surely this one must.  Well, not for me.  By and large, these guys appear as likable middle class schmucks, stuck as so many are within a half-baked life.  Where many find them unlikable without hesitation, I empathize because they are all flawed; once Favreau's soon-to-be wife is introduced (played bitingly by Diaz), it's hard to view him as much more than a pathetic noodle, completely subserviant to the witch behind the beauty.  Then you've got Piven and Stern, playing two dichotomous brothers with a general disdain for each other's personality complex; Piven lively but lost, single and apathetic towards his career, probably acting a bit younger than he should be, while Stern, by contrast, is responsible but neurotic; an uptight family man who's no easier to respect given his Life's accomplishments and anal behaviorisms. Leland Orser's reclusive, enigma of a shy guy doesn't offer much to look up to, and Christian Slater's demented complex made up of a handful of self-help books is easily the most pathetic of the five.  Basically, these guys are all normal in some senses but completely deprived in others, and before the night that begins their descenting journey into madness, none of them, in my eye, could be judged as despicable with any justification (okay, so maybe Slater's could, judging by the real estate selling scene). By the film's fateful  climax, I was pretty fond of the entire group.

And so, then, you've got the premise, in my mind; an awful accident occurs in the hotel room in Vegas, and a prostitute is no longer living.  Thing is, it wasn't anyone's fault, unless you are seriously to blame Piven for the act (as if the prostitute wasn't responsible for taking part in the circus act); simply a devestating accident.  Yet, because of the nature of how the system tends to work, an accident that could still prove to bring down more lives as a consequence.  Perhaps if they weren't all coked up, their decision making abilities might have steered them in a better direction.  Nope -- they were high as a kite, and scared as an abandoned baby.  Essentially, from that point on we see them make one mistake after another, usually out of survival instinct, and by no means the rendered act of will.  And so ensues suffering and paranoia for all, reaching a snowball effect until the film finishes.  If you ask me, if these guys weren't relatable or capable of likelihood, the film wouldn't last beyond the intial moment of chaotic hysteria... but it does.

Throughout most of it, the film expresses a nice emphasis of exaggeration, and that lends some comedy to the dire consequences that proceed. But, as many have said before me, 'Very Bad Things' doesn't really seem like a comedy.  Slater's character, with his outrageous justifications for their nasty acts, comes as the highpoint of the exaggerated comedy. And yet, it is surely no drama, in the sense of melodrama at least.  Rather, it's just a detatched, furious account of bizzarely interesting but fatal situations of, up 'till this point, people who've never encountered such fearful, life-altering experiences.  Combined with Berg's energetic direction and, overall, impressive, convincing, intense performances -- wavering between seriousness and comedic (my favorites being Piven, Stern, Orser and Diaz') -- the whole thing is just ashamedly entertaining.  It just is.  What else can I say?

I think highly moral people might shun the film, but anyone with a knack for fatalism oughta really dig 'Very Bad Things'.  The abuser only abuses because he was abused.  While this might be seen as cowardly, I think we all, at least secretly, view many things from such an angle, especially if events as such hit us or those close to us. Indeed, we are all at the whim of the great magnet who, in this case, just happened to cause the asian hooker to slip on the wet bathroom floor, letting her head gracefully plow through the towel hanger on the wall.

It's dark and it's twisted.  It's ugly, for sure.  I myself have no issues with people disliking it, and will at least claim not to judge them for it.  I just hope that those who are in fact repulsed can at least attempt to understand why some may like it, and not judge them in the unrelenting way many seem to judge the film, which sometimes seems to near the likes of being possessed by a demon.",1160870400,5,5690,4.820987654320987

So I thought this movie, hyped as a very dark comedy, would be right up my alley.  Sadly, apart from a few moments here and there, ""Very Bad Things"" simply fails as a comedy.  And it fails as a drama, because every single character is unlikeable and unsympathetic.  That's too bad, because the actors are fantastic and do their best with the material given to them.  I fault the script, which has problems at best, and the direction and editing, which give the movie a strangely languid character at inopportune times.  You could do worse, but this is strictly a rental at best.",1155686400,5,681,4.540983606557377

It's really amazing how someone can inject raw gore, violence, and sick humour into a movie, and try to pass it off as slick comedy, drama, and deep philosophy. This movie is a great example of how a director can actually make a deliberate and hard working effort to produce a despicable movie.

The sheer perversity in this movie that is dressed up as comedy and paraded as some kind of dark humour is beyond criticism. Do yourself a favour and please don't ever watch this movie if it comes on air. It's not even worth watching for morbid fascination. I terribly resent the fact that I gave up an hour and a half of my life watching it out of sheer curiosity. But then, I may actually be glad that I did.

It has an overriding smugness and self satisfaction (very typical of the 1990s') that overtakes any comedic elements in it.  The hysterical performances (especially Daniel Stern) end up being unintentionally hilarious, because they are so ridiculously over the top, and I don't think that was the point.  It was like Peter Berg went out to make a really vile, disgusting film, without any taste, substance, class, or intelligence.  Berg did an interview where he said ""yeah, throw things at the screen.  I know it's horrible.""  It reminds me of when Jerry Springer used to say ""I know my show is trash"", thinking that excuses him for making it.  It doesn't.  Trash is trash, even if you know you're making it.  You can have the most heinous subject matter in the world, but if there is intelligence and sincerity behind it, it can work brilliantly as a comedy (Dr. Strangelove is the greatest example of this).  The Belgian film Man Bites Dog is more similar in tone to this film, and that film is hilarious, because there's intelligence and real wit behind it.  This is just an attempt at cheap shock value.

Maybe not to the same extent with the funny little twists of this plot but, believe it or not, there are bad people in the real world.  This movie only treis to make a crack at humanity's darker side.  Every one of us, like it or not, has the ability to get caught up in a ""good time gone bad"".  I'd say this is one of those little gems that comes along and slips it's way into mainstream media somehow and shocks the general public into the realization that they ARE human and this is why flicks like this get bashed.  People don't want to be human, they just want to live in their bubbles.  To experience life outside the bubble, go ahead and give this one a shot.

The viciousness and lack of remorse of Christian Slater's character is unsettling; along with his unrelenting rationalization of every black deed they have committed.

One by one they are killed off by one another until the movie lurches to its sickening finale.  The juxtaposition of many young, naive children who are oblivious to what exactly is happening to the sanity and lives of their parents is painful to watch.

Let me begin my review by saying that I love this movie.  It slaps us in the face with several themes we'd really rather not think about and forces us to for an opinion on situations we'll hopefully never have to encounter.  In many ways the movie resembles ""Kill Bill vol. 1."" in that the totally over-the-top nature of the violence renders it cartoon-like and therefore meaningless.  Pretend that this is set in an alternate universe if it makes you feel better...
The central theme explored in the movie is ""Karma"", the concept that what goes around comes around.  The guys go to Vegas for a bachelor party that goes horribly wrong, and they all end up paying for it in different ways.  Comparisons have been drawn between this movie and ""Shallow Grave"", but I'd also say that ""Stag"" and ""Deliverance"" are also valid reference points. Cameron Diaz plays the same character she does in ""A life less ordinary"", while Jon Favreau revisits ""Mikey"" from Swingers.
The movie is shockingly brutal in it's portrayal of the limits people will go to in order to lead a quiet life, and while the end of the movie does take on a somewhat farcical tone, it is ultimately nice to see the wheel of karma spin right round.

1014184,5,6305353549,"What distinguishes black comedy from it's more mainstream counterpart is the element of the macabre and disturbing.
""Very Bad Things"" is one of the more disturbing movies I have ever seen--it can be physically uncomfortable to watch the movie, but fascinating nonetheless. Perhaps the prime example of this is the early scene in the movie with the hooker and the man who inspects the noise.
The plotline is an interesting concotion. Five friends attend a bachelor's party in a Las Vegas hotel, wherein the prostitute hired for their entertainment is accidentally killed whilst having sex with the brother of the groom. From there the movie spirals into a mess of murder and chaos. The characters exhibit great depth as they attempt to cope with their acts and the attempted coverup, while the act of murder destroys them both inwardly and outwardly, as the tightly-knit group of friends begin to violently turn on each other.
There's a notion of either supreme cosmic irony or karma (depending on your point of view) as the last scene fills the screen.
Human complexes come to the fore throughout, from Carmen Diaz's unstoppable and insane need to go through with the wedding at whatever cost, to Christian Slater's ego-driven lust for power to the point where power and control is a death urge. In the process, the frailties of each person become absolutely hilarious. The function of humor serves two goals in this movie: to keep the audience from nausea and despair, and to drive home the point that the lengths people will go to protect their own interests in the face of all obstacles and against all morality is ultimately a destructive drive that also from a God-like perspective seems so ridiculous that it's just downright stupid.
It's no accident we don't feel sympathy for any of the characters except perhaps the one who seeks to repent and the initial murder victims.
The film is an indictment against us for acting this way--driven by power and greed, self-serving animals that are guided entirely by our own peculiar mental illnesses. When we seek to protect ourselves within the framework of a social group, the will of the group will retract to it's originators--the group becomes a mass of self-serving beasts running at conflicting aims. Death is the only result. In moral terms when we perpetuate evil, we invite it in kind for the very simple reason that like attracts like. Karma, baby.
I'm not sure this was the original intention of the movie, but this is the way I read it. Ultimately it's a fascinating movie that has three levels of appeal: to begin with, visceral comedy or intellectual stimulation. But the problem with this is that these two are often mutually exclusive. The third is an absorption in the one without the expense of the other. Approach it in your own way, but remember that its comedic aspect is no less important than its thematic one.",1059868800,,2883,4.861788617886178

Normally, by the time the credits start to roll, I've got a fair idea of what I will say. In this case, I first had to figure out what it was I had just seen.
The movie is all energy and no substance. It tries very hard to be a black comedy, but that genre requires that the audience relate to its outrageousness. Very Bad Things gets right up in your face. It is one of the loudest, most abrasive movies I have ever seen. It doesn't work as a ""buddy-buddy"" picture either, because nobody's anybody's pal here. Every single character turns out to be dislikable, which works in mysteries and psychological thrillers. In other words, I can't tell you if this is a comedy, a drama or a thriller.
Kyle [Jon Faureu] is about to marry Laura [Cameron Diaz]. We never know why. We do know that Laura is one mean, pushy, self-centered girl. Some of his buddies are intent on taking him to Las Vegas for a bachelor blowout. [For some reason, Vegas has become the symbol of sin in the movies recently. I don't know why. Maybe because it is close to Los Angeles.] There they gamble, get drunk, do drugs and wind up in their suite with a call girl, who is provided by their ring leader, Robert [Christian Slater]. During the wild party, the girl is accidentally killed. Rather than ruin their lives, not to mention Kyle's wedding, they bury the body in the desert.
Back in L A, they attempt to resume their normal lives, which includes Kyle's marriage to the dreaded Laura. Several members of the group begin to fall apart, and the ever resourceful Robert decides to take care of the situation. You can imagine how.
Cameron Diaz and Jon Faureu give decent performance. The rest of the cast shouts a lot and makes silly faces. Christian Slater, a talented actor who once seemed destined to take Jack Nicholson's place, is especially disappointing.
Something tells me that the cast had a very good time making Very Bad Things. Unfortunately, they are like a bunch of mad scientists who have no idea what the results of their work will turn out to be. Writer-driector Peter Berg may indeed be fun to work with, but he has a lot to learn about the subtleties of movie making, as well as about what is entertaining.
What ultimately brings the film down is its graphic violence. Personally, I find it hard to laugh when my stomach is turning. My dislike of gratuitous violence is not a political. It's simply a turn off. It's like someone telling you a joke, and then punching you in the ribs and screaming, ""Get it? Get it? Get it?""
One thing does disturb me. Very Bad Things is one of several recent high profile movies that are literally mean-spirited. I hope this turns out to be a fluke rather than a trend. The best pictures may sometimes be about mean events, but they are somehow civil about it.",1016841600,2,2919,4.437616387337058

Written and directed by Peter Berg, heretofore best known as one of the nicer doctors on TV's ""Chicago Hope,"" this is a gleefully nasty mix of black comedy and bloody mayhem, completely uninhibited by any trace of good  taste. You may hate yourself in the morning, but you will find yourself laughing at out loud at its worst excesses. Come to think of it, you may hate yourself even while you're watching the movie. But you'll probably laugh anyway.
 It helps, of course, if you suspect the worst of Christian Slater after reading tabloid accounts of his off-screen misadventures. As Robert Boyd, the self-appointed leader of a bachelor party that gets horribly out of hand, Slater does everything but wink at the audience to signal his eagerness to live down to our expectations.
  A prostitute accidentally dies during the riotous get-together in a Las Vegas hotel room. Not surprisingly, Robert is the first to suggest that calling the police wouldn't be such a great idea. On the other hand, he thinks it would be a smart move to silence an intrusive security guard. With the utmost reluctance, the groom-to-be (Jon Favreau), the inadvertent killer (Jeremy Piven) and two not-so-innocent bystanders (Daniel Stern, Leland Orser) agree to help David bury their mistakes. Nothing good comes of this.
 ""Very Bad Things"" may seem thoroughly amoral, but don't be fooled: There's actually a twisted sense of justice at work here. Cameron Diaz is splendidly monstrous as Laura, Favreau's fiancee, who seems almost as sociopathic as David while she prepares for  her elaborate wedding. She will let nothing -- not even a dead body or two, or three -- spoil her big day. In the end,  however, she gets exactly what she deserves.

Okay....Here goes,  five twenty-something yuppies head off to Vegas for a bachelor party.  They are in what appears to be a penthouse suite, living it up with LOTS of alcohol and cocaine when the stripper/hooker shows up.  Well, things start to get a little bit out of hand (to say the least).  You see, the hooker has a nasty bout with a towel hanger in the bathroom.  She sort of, well...dies and the five guys start to do what any other upstanding citizen would do.  Dial 911.  That is until Robert (Christian Slater) steps up to take control of the ""situation"".  Being one of those ""self-help"" gurus, his philosophy is simple, ""block out every moral that you've had hammered into your head, your entire life and you're left with a 105 pound problem."" Solution? Just clean up the mess and bury the body in the desert.  Sounds simple enough, right?  Well, as it turns out, things don't exactly go as planned.  Before everyone even has time to agree,  there is ANOTHER body to dispose of.  Now, there is no turning back.  (A security guard shows up to see what the ruckus is about and Robert kills the poor sap).  So, they get things cleaned up, and head back home for the big wedding.  This is where the fun REALLY starts.  I won't drop any more spoilers, but I will say this:  If you do plan on seeing this movie, please be forewarned.

Hey, I like that kind of humor, so I liked this movie, though the misogynism got a little old. I rented it because a friend said he admired the filmmakers for making such an incredibly nasty, mean-spirited mainstream movie, and it was an OK movie worth a rental. It seems like most of the reviewers on the IMDB either loved it or despised it (""YOU BETTER STOP SELLING IT"") but I would give it, like, a B minus. Christian Slater's self-actualization psycho act got old after a while but the other actors were good, and I think Cameron Diaz is overrated in general but I really liked her performance in this, she was great as the spoiled stressed-out bride who crosses the line and goes totally psycho (""This is MY DAY!!!"").
It's also one of those 'what-would-you-do-if-it-happened-to-you' type movies.

Very bad things is, on one hand, a poor movie because it  breaks one of the commandments of plotting a film: Thou plot shall not  derive entirely from characters illogic and duplicity.  In other words,  Siskel and Ebert used the term ""idiot plot"" to describe a  scenario where the story would end in two minutes if the characters just  told the truth, which 99% of the audience would normally do.  Suspencion of  belief is something to be excepted in an exteralized conflict (even in  something as stupid as Independence Day) but in a situation where  everything hinges on an internal decision, that decision must be a  reasonable thing to do.  As I sat there watching Christian Slater reason  that they should hide the corpse in a desert, I knew that the reasoning  offered was not that of a believable character but a contriving  screenwriter who decided to make a character forty times stupider than  himself as a launch pad for the plot.  Everything that happens afterwards  is corrupted by the idiocy of the character reasoning in this scene.
On  the other hands, Very Bad Things, once the characters are out of the hotel  room is a hilarious send up of something though it is often very heavy  handed - a character throws himself in front of a moving car to protect his  minivan (why do minivans take so much abuse in today's anti-suburban  propaganda?).",955929600,,1526,4.696969696969697

The script is original, surprisingly intelligent, witty and very entertaining.  The characters are great, helped by a brilliant cast offering excellent performances (especially Christian Slater as a neurotic estate agent).  This movie is one of the most enjoyable that I have ever seen and I would definately recommend it to anybody with a stable mind (you'll need one) and sick sense of humour...If not watch it anyway.",952560000,,681,5.238532110091743
1014593,2,6305353549,"I remember sitting there aghast at the end of the film, trying to figure out exactly who this was made for. It was certainly marketed incorrectly - while they got the ""dark"" part right, it wasn't much of a comedy.  The comedy bits - lines, really - that you saw in the trailer are just  about all the funny bits. The rest is a basic psychological thriller, and  NOT a bad one. Well made, well shot, and well acted in most cases  (Christian Slater was outstanding), but sorry, not funny. I was happy to  see in an earlier review that someone confirmed that ""Carla  Scott"" the dead hooker, was in fact Kobe Tai. I thought that was the  case when I originally saw the trailer when the movie was in theatrical  release, but it's good to know the ol' eyesight hasn't completely keeled  over. I will echo what many of the online reviewers have said: the film is  worth seeing on its own merits, but don't go into it thinking you're going  to see anything like ""Something About Mary"". SAM may have had its  gross moments, but it was at heart a rather sweet film. This thing is just  vicious. Don't avoid the film, just know what you're in for (not bad advice  when considering any video rental/purchase).",951955200,3,1197,4.431192660550459

1014597,4,6305353549,"This movie is a great example of comedy of the absurd.  Situations presented here are carried to the worst possible extremes.  This would be a worst-case scenario movie.  The movie keeps you watching out of sheer  desire to see how things could possibly get any worse.  And things do get  worse... Contrary to some of the reviews printed here, this movie is a  comedy.  It doesn't have it's roots in The Three Stooges or Keystone Cops,  but instead is firmly rooted in the same comedic base that made movies like  ""Heathers"" and ""Death Becomes Her"" funny.  This is often not an easy movie  to watch as it is graphic in nature.  The basis of the story is a group of  guys do one horrible thing, and spend the rest of the movie dealing with  the repercussions of that deed.  The movie puts normal people into a  genuinely horrible situation and shows what happens when they start  reacting the wrong way.  Strong performances by all of the actors involved,  especially Favreau and Diaz.  This movie is not for everyone.  At least  half of the people I saw it with hated it.  I, however, thought it was  amazingly funny.  If you like your humor a little on the grim side,  check  this film out.",949449600,2,1191,4.490566037735849
1014668,5,6305353549,"I can't believe I'm writing this, but this film is excellent.  After all of the tarring and feathering it's suffered at the hands of reviews here, I watched it anyway on a lark, when in the mood for B-grade movie badness.  Suffice it to say that I was extremely, pleasantly surprised...this is an  excellent film.  The cinematography, plot, screenplay, and acting are all  so uniformly excellent that I ended up with newfound respect for almost  every player that had a hand in it.  I think I know what the problem is  behind the wildly opposing viewpoints on the movie: its idiotic marketing.  It is assuredly NOT a comedy, especially not on the order of comedies like  There's Something About Mary.  It's a disturbing film, with some brilliant  insights and statements on human nature, and yes, it does have some funny  scenes, but the humor is generally somewhat nervous.  In any case, I am now  shocked (and pleasantly surprised) to find that Very Bad Things is one of  my favorite films.  I think Peter Berg is very talented; it would be  travesty if he didn't get another chance behind a camera (and screenplay),  and I have newfound admiration for Christian Slater, who not only relishes  his part, but all but steals the movie.  It's unfortunate that some are  raking this movie through several layers of mud; I believe there are two  problems with this.  Firstly, they are letting personal discomfort at the  subject matter get in the way of an impartial review...even if they didn't  enjoy it, they should be able to concede the film's obvious technical and  performance strengths at the least.  And secondly, I think that, quite  plainly and frankly, if you're really THAT disturbed by this movie that it  could, for example, ruin your night, your sensibilities really are too low.  If you can deal with a sometimes-uncomfortably naked look at the ugliness  of human nature, and yes, have a nervous laugh or two all the while, then  you'll likely enjoy this film as much as I did.",948585600,15,1991,4.761764705882353

What is worse is that I like Jon Favreau (of Swingers  fame!) and wondered how he could have accepted this depressing, wretched  role.
However, what really bugs me is the DVD itself. Complete lack of  extras (save for the trailer). Not even subtitles.

I was exhausted by  the end - I can't imagine how the actors felt.

I long for more political correctness bashing like  this - and excuse me if I'm missing the point here, but Robert Boyd  (Slater) wasn't all bad.  His heart was in the right place, what with  wanting to protect his friends from the consequences of what was  quintessentially, an accident.
The chainsaw scene was a little too  much, even for me, but the ending was fabulous.  Diaz' character severely  got on my nerves throughout the film with her miniature seating plans and  hysterical bride-to-be tantrums etc. but she certainly got her just  desserts at the end.  Slater's done a few ""on the edge"" roles now  and should do a few more - he plays a psycho SO well.

1014760,3,6305353549,"In general I approve of black comedy.  ""Theatre of Blood"" is a favourite of mine, for example.  I thought ""Fargo"" was great.  VBT, however, does not work for me as entertainment;  I think this is for  one very simple reason:  the plot centers around the murder (or  manslaughter) of a prostitute by a hopped-up John, and this -- wake up  folks -- is not fantasy but something that happens every goddamn day all  over the world.  I have heard that the cops in LA and NYC don't even start  investigating the deaths of hookers till they reach double digits per  month.
So, umm, a bunch of rich white guys killing a hooker and then a  black security guard just doesn't strike me as unrealistic enough to be  funny.
This is a fantastically misanthropic film;  the only person with a  conscience gets killed off only half way through, and though in the end the  bad guys get what's coming to them, it hardly qualifies as a morality play.  There is no one you can like in this cast of characters.  The writing and  directing has a cold and depressing quality; the general mode is one of  deep contempt for humanity, a sort of vicious post-Swiftian accidie.
The  only bright points for me were its uncompromising illumination of just how  stupidly grown men behave when in packs, and (here I'll give it four stars)  its cruelly accurate dissection of the selfish amorality behind most  popular ""self-help"" pseudo-philosophies.  Slater makes a truly  demonic villain, but again he is just a bit too real to be comfortably  hilarious -- I get the feeling that there are people just like him running  many major corporations :-)
It's true one can have more than enough of  trad Hollywood feel-good fare, but I think VBT is not the right antidote.  It has the Tarantino disease, a kind of cold creeping nastiness that offers  sadism in place of wit and blood-n-guts shock value in place of any real  originality.  See it for Slater's virtuoso performance -- it's a classic,  right up there with Peter Lorre at his scariest and funniest -- but don't  expect to feel cheerful afterwards.
