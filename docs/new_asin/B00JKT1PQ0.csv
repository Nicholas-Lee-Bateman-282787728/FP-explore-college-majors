6373408,4,B00JKT1PQ0,"This Is one of those shows where you  just sit back, turn off your brain, and just enjoy (much like gurren laggan and kill la kill) it's incredibly fun to watch and Is weird in terms of the setting, which Is basically black Friday the anime except with ben-to instead of TV's. The show starts with our protagonist in a new School with liffle money to buy food but by chance He walks into a store and finds half price ben-to's. Just when He Is going to grab the ben-to all of a sudden He Is rushed by a hord of angry, and hungary, fighters, who tyen procceed to trying and beat the s*** out of each other' including our hero. Just like any normal person, He Is confused and has no idea What Is going on, but then a mysterious but beuatiful woman apears, and beats the living s*** out of everyone, including our unlucky hero. After the dust settles He sees the woman walking away with all the ben-to,s and finds out That the woman is called 'The ice witch"" but soon after He passes out. Later on He wakes up and procceeds to go home. The next day He goes to school and then sees the ice witch at his school and upon seeing her she tells him ""stay away from that store"" which only makes him more curious on what the hell and why they're taking so seriously. After going to the store again getting beaten again He decides to go under the ""ice witch""'s wing  and learns the art of fighting for ben-to. Like I said, turn off your brain and you'll Love this anime, think too much, then you'll hate it. I reccomend this anime to anyone who wants to see people beating each other up. The animation is very good when it comes to the fights, mediocre when it come to everything else. Overall a fun show",1397952000,25,1691,4.216049382716049
6373409,5,B00JKT1PQ0,"So very funny and nonsensical, this series features a fight club type honor code for obtaining the greatest prize of all: half price bento.

6373415,5,B00JKT1PQ0,"I absolutely enjoy this show, I remember catching it on FUNimation a couple years back and only recently did I manage to get an official copy.
In my personal opinion, it's one of my favorite anime's despite it being short. Perhaps they'll consider creating a second season. I would be ecstatic at that announcement, as i'm sure I wouldn't be the only one. If you haven't seen it yet, and are looking at reviews, I can safely recommend this show to you. Just to give you an idea of my tastes My top three shows in order from 1st to 3rd, are, Dragonball Z, Fullmetal Alchemist, & One piece, with Dragonball tailing not far behind. I'm not deeply into anime shows but i know a handful, and can appreciate the the style and storytelling that comes with them. With all that said, ""Ben-To"" has a spot in my top 10. I only wish they would expand on the show more. Maybe that time will be soon, but until then I'll just have to wait.",1494288000,,925,4.32183908045977
6373416,5,B00JKT1PQ0,"This a show to binge off of, Nothing fancy, no strong story plot just simple fighting over Half price bento.",1493251200,,108,4.45
6373417,4,B00JKT1PQ0,"This one is a good time, especially if you're familiar with half price bento: you might get lucky and get a great one, or one that's not so popular. This series removes the luck and bases it on fights. The overall good nature and honor give the series a good feel. There are some funny choices in the characters, like the large breasted woman who remains faceless to the teenage protagonist. There are odd choices, like the fiction writing girl those prose is occasionally a skewed counterpoint to the action. The tone is light; the only laugh out loud moment for me was when the bad luck girl cooked a bento with completely off flavors. A nice series with occasional innuendo, but aside from a few bouncing breasts and bathing, I don't remember any other fanservice. Definitely worth checking out, though it lacks serious punch to elevate it to classic status.",1489881600,,861,4.708609271523179
6373418,5,B00JKT1PQ0,"- Synopsis: Our protagonist is an ordinary and young high schooler. When he joins the Half-Priced Food Lovers Club, hes in for a big surprise. And in more ways than one. Life is a battlefield. For these students, they are willing to put their bodies, and pride on the line for discounted food, which has far more demand than supplies. There are winners and losers. The winners walk out the store with the bentos they earn. The losers, however, are left with shame...and numerous injuries. Tune in to find out the struggles of these students in no-holds-barred action over discounted bentos!
========================================================================================================

- Comments: This is a silly anime without a doubt. However, due to the serious-nature of the fights, it is more dramatic and suspenseful than it implies. It isn't plot-heavy, but is more simplistic and for those seeking both comedy and action, with a side of fan-service. The fan-service is moderate, considering it isn't enough to bump it up to the TV-MA rating just for that alone. But keep this in mind in case fan-service isn't for you.

- Analysis: While beating each other up for food may be exaggerated and silly, it is not all that surprising. People fight over things more than people might realize. This includes political, religious, sports, opinionated views, and many others. Even things such as console wars, pc vs. consoles, best girl/waifu debates, dakimakuras (body/hug pillows), animes, etc. In short, it doesn't matter what, people can always find ways to fight over things, whether using their body or words. This probably infers that life is filled with conflict, among other things.

Additionally, fighting over discounted food is relatable and relevant to reality, as well. Consider Black Friday. Although, I think most people typically aim for electronics, fundamentally, the circumstances are similar. Without too much effort, there should be plenty of videos or situations in which people fought over products or even died when they participated in these kinds of situations. Especially when new game consoles are released, such as Nintendo's Switch, caution must be exercised as a person's desires may outweigh their rationality.

Another addressed concept is the juxtaposition and dissonance of the two main genres related to this anime: comedy and action. Typically, comedy focuses on dialogue and exposition, as well as antics and character development to engage the viewer. Action typically revolves around cool and/or flashy fight scenes to impress the viewer. Many people might find this interesting and fresh due to variety. Others may find it inconsistent and unorganized due to lack of consolidation. Just about everything is subjective. So, you can decide which of the two applies to your experience with the anime: whether it's about variety to appeal to many viewers, or specialized content to appeal to specific viewers. The same could be said for a person's style and content of reviewing products.

- Features: English and Japanese audio with English subtitles. Includes 12 episodes on 2 DVDs, and 12 episodes on 2 Blu-rays. Rated TV-14 for moderate fan-service, and violence.

- Conclusion: A whacky and simplistic anime that's more aimed at males due to the contents: action and fan-service. To help balance out the action, there's plenty of social interactions to help with character development and comedy to keep the viewer engaged. Regardless of the anime, there's plenty of things to keep in mind or consider. If at least some of these addressed points align with your views, this anime might be for you.

6373425,1,B00JKT1PQ0,worse anime out there. the MC always getting beat up by student counsel president for talking to a girl which she says she's protecting which is a lie. through out the anime she makes several sexual advices towards the girl which the girl doesn't like. kidnaps in final episode this anime is bulls*** I think the people made this need to find a different line of work. because this anime sucked .  I am Jeff Scrak it really isn't a good anime the student counsel president forces herself onto the girl the main male character talks to pretty much try's to rape her. beats the main male character up throughout the series which is bs. crap like this shouldn't be for sale or even made. it's not right at all. the people who made this must have been on some serious drugs at the time. because it was poorly done.,1453939200,,810,4.4

6373434,3,B00JKT1PQ0,"Meh...not going to tell you what it is about, because everyone else already did, all I can tell you is it's not the greatest anime nor is it the worse.
It is the type of anime to kill time till the next great anime. I maybe jaded because I grew up on anime, and I still watch Tenchi series (both TV and OVA), Evangalion in my youth, I grew up as a child watching Robotech (Macross), Star Blazers, Marine Boy, Kimba and so on and so on back in late 60's into the 70's.
All I am saying is this anime is just a typical run of the mill anime with a bit of harem on the side. I just don't feel anything for the characters to care.
My advice? Go buy Tenchi, or save your money and wait till price drop big time on this anime.",1438646400,,719,3.8979591836734695
6373435,3,B00JKT1PQ0,"Ben-to I'll say right away deserve maybe a 3.5. This show is called Ben-to as a spin of the word Bento (a Japanese lunch box). The show has people who actually fight in stores, mostly convience stores over Bento boxes when they go on sale. The story is my biggest issue with Ben-to, it kind of doesn't have one. You could say that's because of the goofiness of the show but in truth I think they tried to make a plot and decided to forgo it. Our main hero fights during the brawls because he's broke and the sales on the food saves him cash, another fights because she likes the thrill...beyond that nothing really happens plot wise. You get rivals that come and go, and you even see random bits of romance possibly taking place but in the end it doesn't happen. The animation is pretty solid, the fights look really good and the normal moments of just people talking look good as well. Sound is okay, there's no really standing tunes like most anime but the voice dub is quite good. Overall Ben-to isn't a bad series, but the lack of a good story and the okay songs reduce the grade to me. It's funny to watch and its over fast, 12 eps,  but overall you're miles may vary on how much you'll enjoy a show like this.",1433548800,3,1215,4.282608695652174

I liked the characters, but I felt there was more to it than was in the show, which is usually true for most anime versus its manga.  (They can only animate so much, right?)  But I liked its story line and its characters.  If you just want some mindless fun, then I recommend this one.",1432080000,,423,4.109756097560975

After you watch this you'll look over your shoulder the next time you are at the supermarket when they are putting on the reduced price stickers on old food.

6373446,5,B00JKT1PQ0,"This show is very enjoyable, and while it doesnt have a particularly deep story I think thats one of the things that adds to the charm of this series.  Its extremely funny (with some weird sexual humor here and there) and definitely brings some new things to the realm of martial arts anime, such as fighting with chop-sticks, shopping carts and shopping baskets XD

Also, what the heck is up with the fish song that plays in the supermarket?!

Anyways, I sadly haven't been able to get my hands on this despite the previous release date that has come and gone, and now it says it will be released feb 3 but my girlfriend already pre-ordered it with her prime membership and received a message saying that amazon is already out of stock and that it may not even get there until the end of the month.  Im not sure why amazon hasn't updated that, but everyone should be prepared for this especially if you don't have prime.  Im sure youll get it after they restock, but it may be a wait.

Rergardless, this show is worth it, not sure about paying the list price but $40 is much more reasonable.  Dont get it if your looking for something serious, it should be obvious that this show is goofy as heck, but as another reviewer already pointed out this series is easy to watch and get hooked on.
