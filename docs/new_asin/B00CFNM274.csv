5721779,4,B00CFNM274,"""The Deflowering of Eva van End"" (TDEE hereafter) is a movie that won't appeal to everybody. For instance, if you like cookie-cutter movies that you can easily categorize as ""chick flick"", ""romcom"", ""coming of age"" or movies that don't feature complex characters with both strengths and flaws: then you won't want to watch this movie.

This is not an unfamiliar story: a superficially normal but mostly dysfunctional family has their rate of change increased by the arrival of an outside influence. In this case, the family is the van End family, a suburban Dutch family.  Father Evert is a mid-level manager in a factory that cranks out a Dutch variant of hot dog called a ""frikandel""), and his wife Etty are deep in the midst of their 25th anniversary preparations. Their oldest son Erwin is a young adult still battling acne and on the verge of moving in with his adoring girlfriend. Youngest son Manuel is a mean-spirited teen fueled by drugs and rebellion. The movie's title character, Eva, is an awkward, introverted high schooler, who seemingly fits in neither at school nor at home. Finally, not physically present, but essential to the story is the memory of another deceased son.

The change agent in this movie is German exchange student Veit, who Eva is sponsoring for a two-week stay. Since her pronouncements of his arrival went unheard in the chaotic exchanges of the van End household, his arrival comes as a surprise. Veit's influences are felt by everybody in the van End family. The title tells you exactly what influence Veit has on Eva; this is secondary to his influences on the other family members as the two weeks play out in the movie.

Don't be fooled by the DVD cover, which evokes  ""Juno"" or ""Little Miss Sunshine"". While this movie has comedic moments, it is also dark, violent and deals explicitly with issues of sexuality and contains scenes of rather intense violence.

Although a Dutch movie with English subtitles, one premise of the student exchange is to allow participants to practice their English; as a result, large portions of the movie are spoken in English.

The conclusion of this movie features a cavalcade of events touches everybody in the van End family. The changes are for both better and worse, and director Michiel ten Horn doesn't serve the answers up under a neon sign. You'll have to figure out for yourself who you think the winners and losers are when the smoke clears (literally!).

Interesting movie and well worth the 94 minutes you'll spend with the van Ends.

5721780,5,B00CFNM274,"Eva is the only girl in a family of boys and is a one of those girls who has yet to blossom and is hence shunned by the `it girls' at school, and seems to be universally ignored by her family - parents included. She announces that as part of their student exchange programme she will be having a German student staying for two weeks - but they don't bother listening.

So Veit turns up without fanfare and immediately makes an impact. He is good looking with an angelic smile, a vegetarian, he does charity work in Africa and has already travelled widely at a young age - and he is a meditation specialist and ornithologist as well as having perfect English - its enough to make anyone sick - with envy. Well all the girls fancy him and Eva's brother Manual takes a righteous dislike to him as he is seen clearly as major competition.

Well he weaves his charm and soon has the entire family questioning themselves and all start to reinvent their lives and like all rebirths it can only be painful. Eva meanwhile can't help her emotions and is falling deeply under his thrall.

This is a wonderful film. I received a copy from Film Movement for review purposes and it is the best I have seen this year from them which is saying a lot as they have all been good to excellent. It is in Dutch, a bit of German and a lot of English and all with good subs where and if needed. This has a down to earth charm, satire and humour all wrapped up in a film that is directed (Michiel Ten Horn) and acted superbly - simply can not recommend highly enough and it also has two extra short films from the same director, so not only a fantastic main feature but two extras making this unmissable.",1385856000,2,1680,4.2933753943217665
5721781,4,B00CFNM274,"This was a quirky and sometimes very dark film. Poor Eva is so often overlooked. She is a wallflower and doesn't seem to have a voice of her own but she watches everything. Her family continues their awkward lives around her and already has issues before the story even begins. And then Viet shows up -- an exchange student from Germany. His good looks, confidence and charm, put everyone around him in a tailspin. Mom is learning to meditate, Dad is sending money to a soda sipping, 'needy' child in Africa, their oldest son is obsessed with getting rid of his acne, their other son busy getting high. And Eva watches it all go by, waiting for the moment that Viet shows her some attention.

The Deflowering of Eva van End is funny, introspective and dysfunctional. The van Ends are a sad family, self-absorbed and too easily swayed by Viet. It was interesting to watch and well done. It is in subtitles with the occasional spattering of English.",1385769600,2,947,4.636904761904762
5721782,5,B00CFNM274,"15-year old Eva van End is a typical awkward teenager trying to discover who she is while dealing with a hilariously dysfunctional family, all of whom have their own problems.  Veit, a smart, good-looking German exchange student arrives (invited by Eva), and the family members respond in different and confusing ways.

Mother Etty is without her own identity and tries to handle one drug dealing son while adoring her eldest on his upcoming marriage.  Eva's father is also lacking; searching for where he belongs in the world.  Exchange student Veit is not the typical teenager.  Being a charismatic, mature, older teenager he slowly wins over each family member, fearlessly guiding them on suggested missions, whether it be meditation, long distance donations to an African boy or relating to the two sons.  Poor Eva has a crush on Veit pushing her to the forefront of her family.  Dowdy, insecure but intelligent, Eva acts as the catalyst and gets transformed along with the rest of her bewildered family.

The journey is more interesting than the ending, which does not disappoint, but at moments the film seems nearly surreal.  The cinematography is bright and unique, adding to the odd visual sense. Eva and Veit make for an interesting combination as well.  ""The Deflowering of Eva van End"" doesn't disappoint in its imagery or odd emotional results.

Also included are two fascinating shorts.  ""Baste"" is a psychedelic, croppy, visually arresting film one would expect from David Lynch.  ""Aria"" concerns a frail older gentleman who loses his pet canary (Arie).  Soon after he meets another senior citizen and they embark on a whimsical and odd journey.

5721783,5,B00CFNM274,"A refreshingly humorous, insightful and sensitive film from the Netherlands from director Michael ten Horn who also wrote this contemporary story with Anne Barn Hoorn lights up the screen with vivid color, funky music, a story with many twists and a groups of excellent actors. It is a film hat deserves a wide audience because it addresses issues usually avoided in honest filmmaking.

The van End family is prototypically dysfunctional, having a tough time connecting to one another, leading their own little lives in their own silly little worlds. The father Evert (Ton Kas) works in a factory that makes a hotdog appearing food piece: once a year there is an eating contest and for the past few years his son Manuel (Abe Dijkman) has won the trophy for eating the most (otherwise Manuel is a trouble maker who spends his hours smoking dope). The mother Etty (Jacqueline Blom) is discontent with the family in general and feeling ignored by her husband who is caught up in preparing their 25th wedding anniversary party. The oldest son Erwin (Tomer Pawlicki) has severe facial acne but is obsessed with an upcoming marriage to an Indian girl Mardou (Anandi Gall), selecting paint colors and other distractions to avoid intimate contact with his fianc. That leaves the only daughter, Eva (Vivian Dierickx), an overweight unpopular misfit whose best friend is her bunny rabbit and who announces to her family (though they ignore her) that she is participating in a school project to bring German exchange students to learn English by living with Dutch families. The German lad Veit (handsome and talented 19 year old Rafael Gareisen) arrives and is polite, thoughtful, caring, gentle, organized, spiritually centered, who also loves to party and be a proper houseguest. The films story is how Veit changes everyone in this family: introducing Evert to his little African friend Ngiri (Nicanor Zinga) over Skype and Evert elects to help the poverty striken lad by sending money; introducing Etty to meditation that allows Etty to loses her pent up anger and sadness; Introducing Erwin to his sexuality (very subtly); and equally subtly deflowering the ugly chubby pathetic and very needy Eva. The result of Veits 2 week stay dramatically changes this family, outing secrets that have been hurtful and making them care for each other in a normal and healthy, loving fashion.

It all comes together with many more sidebars of action that emphasize the fragility of each of the characters. Yes, it has humorous moments, but the overall message is a tender one and is very ell presented. In Dutch and English with subtitles. Grady Harp, November 13",1385251200,3,2644,5.020501138952164
5721784,5,B00CFNM274,"This Dutch film with English subtitles is another fine release from Film Movement.  Eva Van End is a 15 year old high school student struggling with all the typical problems of adolescence, plus the additional one of being the youngest and most ignored member of a severely dysfunctional family.  When she tries to tell her parents and brothers at dinner one night that she is going to be bringing a German exchange student home for a two week visit, no one even listens to her.

When Veit, the German exchange student, arrives everything turns upside down for Eva and her family.  He is tall and handsome, intelligent, and extremely nice.  Eva's family is shocked by his arrival, but begrudgingly make room for him.  Veit's good looks and charisma make him a magnet for the popular girls at school, who heretofore have ignored Eva, arouse jealousy in her two older brothers, and completely bemuse her distracted parents.  It's hard to say at first how Eva herself feels about Veit, because she's normally glum and silent, but by the end of the film it's become very clear that he has awakened something in her as well. What happens is fairly predictable, but with so many unexpected little twists and turns that it's enjoyable to watch.

This is a humorous film with some very dark underpinnings, in the typical fashion of so many teenage angst movies.  The ending is somewhat equivocal, and we are left uncertain as to how long lasting some of the changes Veit has produced will be, but there is no doubt that Eva herself has been profoundly affected by him.",1384473600,2,1560,4.726937269372693
5721785,4,B00CFNM274,"Let me state upfront that I am a huge fan of the Film Movement's library of foreign and indie movie. This is the July '13 release of the DVD-of-the-month Club (to which I subscribe). The movie will be available on Amazon as an Instant Video in early December.

""The Deflowering of Eva van End"" (2013 release from the Netherlands; 98 min.) brings the story of the van End family, at first sight a seemingly 'normal' middle class Dutch family consisting of mom and dad, and their 2 sons Erwin and Manuel, and daughter, Eva, a very shy, introverted high schooler. As the movie opens, we see them having dinner, and Eva tries to tell them that a German exchange student is arriving soon for a 2 week stay, but she is ignored. When the German student arrives, a guy named Veit, the family is taken by surprise, but the parents readily accept Veit into their home. Veit is like a guy from another planet, almost too good and too nice to be true. Meanwhile we see the sons Erwin and Manuel experiencing serious problems, and it becomes pretty clear this is a very dysfunctional family. To tell you much more of the plot would surely ruin your viewing experience, you'll just have to see how it all plays out.

Several comments: First, director Michiel Ter Horn, co-writing the script with Anne Barnhoorn, deserves a huge amount of credit for bringing this movie alive. His view and direction of this dysfunctional family, and how an outsider (the German exchange student) affects their lives, is impressive. In the liner notes, Ter Horn comments that this is based on his own family's experience hosting a German exchange student. Second, this movie has funny moments, which will make you chuckle, but to be clear: this is a bittersweet movie with serious undertones. Check out in particular the last 15-20 min. when all is revealed (and which blew me away). Third, kudos to the cast, none more so in my opinion than Eva (played by Vivian Dierickx in her screen debut), the awkward, sensitive teenager. And if you are wondering about the title of the movie: is it in the truest sense of the word, or is it more psychological? Just watch! In all, ""The Deflowering of Eva van End"" is another great addition to the Film Movement's rich (and on-going) library of foreign and indie movies.

But wait! There is more! As usual, the DVD comes with extras, and this time we got not one (which is the usual case), but two shorties. They are both from director Ter Horn. First there is the 13 min. ""Basta"", but much better for me was the 10 min. ""Arie"" about a senior losing his pet canary Arie, with unexpected results. Just delightful.",1374710400,2,2619,4.615879828326181

5721797,2,B00CFNM274,"I wasn't expecting much since the film and director were unknown to me. My choices are often based upon Amazon suggestions, so this seemed like a possibility. However, the film fails in so many ways = direction, editing, writing, acting! that after hanging in there to the bitter end I returned to the reviews and discovered that the director is far from discovering his niche (unless attempting to copy another's is fair).

5721801,1,B00CFNM274,"I was trying really hard to find something endearing about this movie but I couldn't. It stars off promising but very quickly slides into madness. The young girl is supposed to be 15 but looks like a 10 year old, so the ""deflowering"" is truly cringe worthy. Eva is supposed to be shy, but come across as a catatonic sociopath. The rest of the family is just as bad. I can feel what the director was going for, just poorly executed. If you don't like anything about the characters the message is lost on the audience, and these characters were lacking in humanity.",1392163200,4,563,4.475728155339806
5721802,4,B00CFNM274,"The title of this 2013 Danish film combined with our introduction to the title character is pretty much guaranteed to result in a raised eyebrow or too.  Eva van End is fifteen-years-old and the thought that the lost of her virginity qualifies as a subject of some sort of humor is definitely disconcerting.  But the moment promised by the time comes in the final act and by then the viewer is well acclimated to the idea that this is an act to be taken symbolically and as the punch line for something other than a crude joke.

The family van End is, to say the least, dysfunctional in the extreme.  Tolstoy's dictum about every unhappy family being unhappy it is own way could certainly have a corollary specific to dysfunctional families.  Etty (Jacqueline Blom), the mother, is either yelling at her youngest son,Manuel (Abe Dijkman), for being a dope fiend, or heaping praise upon her oldest son, Erwin (Tomer Pawlicki), who is looking forward to getting married (and away from his mother, one would think).  Evert (Ton Kas), the milquetoast father, has plenty to say (or write on memos), but no one pays attention to any of his suggestions.  Stuck at the end of the family pecking order is Eva (Vivian Dierickx), who seldom says a word, and when she does, nobody pays attention.  Not even when she informs the family at dinner one night that a German exchange student is coming to live with them for a while.  You might be inclined to equate Germany with Nazis and Hitler--certainly Eva does in her presentation on the country to her classmates--but in terms of continental Europe the Germany economic machine is admired and when Veit (Rafael Gareisen) arrives, looking like a young Aryan god, he and his culture seem to represent all that is good about the present, with nary a look at all that unpleasantness in the past.

Viet is only staying with the van End family for two weeks, but in that fortnight their interactions with the visitor sparks each in turn out of their lethargy.  Certainly when they look at Viet they can see nothing of themselves and it becomes clear that they find themselves wanting after making such comparisons.  We sense that Viet's apparent perfection is too good to be true, mainly because we want the character to be more than a Mary Poppins-like figure that comes in and saves the children, saves the father, saves everybody and goes his merry way.  I do not think I would go so far as to see this film as a parable regarding Germany hegemony, but the evidence for such a critique is certainly there on screen.

Ultimately, ""The Deflowering of Eva van End"" has to be taken as satire rather than as a tragicomedy, and for me it was impossible not to see director Michiel ten Horn as a kindred spirit to Wes Anderson, although certainly not as creatively audacious.  Our assumption is that the family van End will be better off from having known Viet, even if it means their old way of life is burned to the ground, because, let's face it, they have nowhere to go but up.  But when the credits role, you will have to ask yourself if you truly believe that to be the case.",1390780800,3,3109,4.594936708860759
5721803,5,B00CFNM274,"Love seeing dysfunctional families explode gruesomely, hysterically? In The Deflowering of Eva Van End, a German exchange student comes to stay with a dysfunctional family wherein each member is wound as tight as the core of a golf ball. You know the saying, ""German humor is no laughing matter?"" It certainly isn't for this Dutch family. The German knows exactly which bands to lance to explosively delaminate the family. And free the poison. Reminds me of the best of the Coen Bros., as in Fargo. I loved it.",1388188800,3,510,4.806818181818182
5721804,4,B00CFNM274,"The seventh entry in the Film on Friday series is The Deflowering of Evan Van End . This is the feature film debut of Dutch Director Michel ten Horn.

 The Deflowering of Eva Van Endwas an official selection for over ten film festivals.

 Eva quietly announces at the family dinner table that a German exchange student will be staying with them for two weeks. No one listens to or hears what Eva has to say. Her father is oblivious, her mother preoccupied and her older brother is focused on his own life. Her other brother is unfocused - stoned most of the time.

 The first few scenes were both funny and poignant. The family situation is not that unbelievable. I felt incredibly sad for Eva - brilliantly played by Vivian Dierickx. She's awkward, overweight, ostracised at school and ignored at home.

 When Veit (Rafael Gareisen) arrives, he is a blond god, seemingly good at everything and anything and uncannily able to target what each family member seems to need.

 But, although this film has been described as a dark comedy and the cover art seems to support that view, I found that it took a more serious tone than I initially imagined it would.

 Veit is the catalyst that triggers upheaval and great change within this dysfunctional family. Secrets are revealed, scabs are picked off and change is inevitable. All for the good? Well, I think each viewer would have a different answer. As the film ended, I wondered about Eva's place in her family - things have changed, but it is still not spelled out. But the last group shot is telling.  ten Horn also uses a 'falling star' metaphor to great effect.

 After the film, while reading the liner notes, I discovered that the idea for this film sprang from ten Horn's own experience with a German exchange student. Makes me wonder which bits are truth.

 One of the addition short films included is Basta - ten Horn's film thesis, that specialized in animation. The Deflowering of Eva Van End also has a bit of an animation feel to it. There are many short shots that showcase what the director wants us to see, then quickly cuts away. As the film picks up speed in the last twenty minutes, the cutaways multiply. We know what is happening to each family member and are just waiting to see how those moments will come together and what it means for the Van End family.

 The Deflowering of Eva Van End is a strangely moving, quirky film. Bits of it are squirmy, bits are sad, bits are affirming, but as a package it's very, very watchable. I quite enjoyed it.

Netherlands / 2012 / Dutch, English & German with English subtitles / 98 min

 As mentioned, there are two short films included, both directed by ten Horn. I didn't enjoy Basta at all. Perhaps it was the style (slightly macabre Whoville tone with no real dialogue) or the material, but it was a miss for me. The second, Arie, was quite good.  A realistic view, rather than the animated style is more appealing to this viewer.

Shown through the number of internal and external conflicts, this film seems to convey the idea that perfection doesn't necessarily equal happiness, no matter who you are. That being said, it is a great coming of age story for all ages.
