4699140,5,B005HDQVJ4,"As other reviewers have noted this is probably not up to todays standards for audio and video quality, but that doesn't mean it is not an exceptional dvd, because it is. My copy is full 16:9 and stereo, and despite rather static but acceptable camera work, it is very good no matter the age. The sound is very good played through a top sound system. The video lacks crispness, but is still good.

The concert itself... WOW, this is Linda at her full voice best moving energetically through the best of her songs to that date. She is accompanied by many of the same side musicians that graced her 70's albums (she intros them on the disc). Anyone who is a fan of Linda or of that genre of mucis in the 70's, this is a must to have (good luck finding a copy). This is the best you will get of her this side of FM (the movie)(good luck getting that too!).

With her biography coming out in 2013 (Amazon are you on top of this?) the focus on what Linda has done and accomplished through  more than 4 decades of performance in multiple genres of music from rock, country rock, big band and latin (see Amazon Linda Ronstadt shop) will come into focus clearly. Get on board with this or any other Ronstadt selections you can. This is one of the premier artists of a generation and you should not miss what she has to offer.",1344729600,4,1316,4.298387096774194
4699141,4,B005HDQVJ4,"As the other reviewer said concert DVDs featuring Linda are very hard to come by and while this one is more bo*tleg quality it's good none the less.

The good:
Mono audio, but pretty decent, better than AM but not as good as FM, I'd guess it top end somewhere ~10Khz
Good VHS quality, not up to DVD standards but pretty good for VHS. Probably looks great on a SD tube TV but just OK on a larger HDTV.
Great set list
Linda looks and sounds great, nice off the shoulder white blouse and tight jeans
Nice artwork on DVD(not silk screened) and box
Slow camera work, no MTV style editing here, camera lingers on closeups and actually fades and pans

The bad:
Of course 4:3 and more like VHS than DVD quality
White snow line on the bottom 1/2"" of my screen including a 1"" tape fold over line(the snow can be eliminated by enabling over scan on your HDTV(I normally have 0 over scan on my 46"" Sony LCD sometimes called full pixel).
Mono audio, if listening through a 5.1 setup you will only get the center channel speaker, I played though my TVs speakers to get audio from both speakers.

If you like Linda like I do you will appreciate this rare video but be forewarned it's not the quality of professional shot for DVD or BD productions. Sure looks and sounds better than my recorded off HBO on SP VHS, dubbed onto Beta II and then dubbed to SP VHS copy of her 1981 Mad Love tour. All and all I'm happy with my purchase and would purchase more of her work if only available to purchase.",1328313600,8,1481,4.263345195729538
4699142,5,B005HDQVJ4,"I always wondered why it was so hard to find any video of Linda from her most successful period in music. I thought some of her concerts must have been filmed at some point. I have been glad to get a glimpse of her then in various comp DVDs over the last few years but not until this Germany show did I get to have a full 75 minutes with her. I have watched it twice! Song after song witnessing her power and execution. The band is wonderful and give very good rendering of all her studio recordings to this point. Linda looks beautiful and my favorites were ""Crazy"", ""When will I be loved"", ""Heatwave"", ""Someone to lay down beside me"" and, ofcourse... ""You're no good"" as only she could do it.

I found the quality not today's remastered standard but a defenite 8.5 out of 10, it looks very good. Sound I would give an 8 or 9 as well. Recording was done well back then. Came with nice artwork and very cool menu watching her dance inside the TV.. lol. Any serious Linda fan should pick this up if you don't already have it. It is available at 70s-tv.com plus tons of other rare Linda 70s shows on DVD.",1313539200,21,1102,4.222748815165877
