But even as a brand-new VHS, the video quality is difficult to watch now - probably no matter how good the video camera captured the footage, it won't ever look good once it gets put on a VHS tape (I've seen quite a few PH videos on DVD that look pretty decent even when shot on video).  Anyway, overall it's got a decent amount of explicit nudity (when the camera goes between the legs you can often count to 4 or even 5 or 6 before they cut away) but thanks to all the ""all access"" behind-the-scenes type footage, you can now also see the annoying camera movement in action.  Moreover, you can see why the softcore couples action (and therefore, often the solo action) can be so lame - having to stop and start to director's commands is one thing, but having to also accommodate these extremely short moving camera cuts, how tedious.

There are some hot women here for sure, and it is interesting to hear some of their stories and then follow up with a nice vignette of them playing around nude.  There's plenty of tidy pudenda here, but very little in the way of touching and no spreads or anything pushing the boundaries much.  Closed pink, you could say, except for one girl at about 39 minutes in, hers was definitely open for a couple of brief passes. You do occasionally see the girls doing what might be beyond the standards of the time, so they deal with that by editing (especially crossfading with something else) to minimize how much you can see.

Certainly you can't go too wrong when this only cost three-fifty (3.50).  But the actual nudity while somewhat lingering is still pretty brief and the camera moves a lot more than you'll want it to (lots of zooms from far away to close, then start over and do that again and again).  And the girls run their hands over their bodies in a strict no-friction mode.  So, it is what it is.",1423440000,,1881,4.410404624277457
