7787070,5,B01HH95M2M,This was a gift and has not been viewed at this time. I've ordered DVD's before and have not had a problem. I'm sure this will be the same.,1481587200,,139,3.8275862068965516
7787071,2,B01HH95M2M,"The famous tv series CASTLE is undoubtedly rather interesting, several episodes are excellent, some awful or pesky or fastidious, even unclear, unreal. I have seen the first three seasons. How much better is anyway the series called WITHOUT TRACE. The performers are decisively perfect and nice - let me put at the top the beautiful and bravissima Stana Katic, but  BUT how is it possible to endure Nathan Fillion? All his expressions - poses? affectations? grimaces? - are like those of an unpleasant and ridiculous clown who induces me to feel unhappy  something of a very bad copy of Lou Costello  is it ever the direction ordering him to act like that? Wrong direction! And then all the Castle-Mother-Daughters scenes irritate me too much: almost disgustingly sugary and perfectly unreal. When the dear old MGM films had a touch of honey it did not come so false and bothersome as here; in those good old days all was done with sincerity, here it is irredeemably fake. Surely the lauded script is perhaps the real guilty party.
Anyway if you like CASTLE, be happy with the series; believe me, I don't want to lead you to my opinion, but I wonder if so many hosannas are so happily sung because vox populi say it is something special. Se piace a lui, se piace a lei, deve piacere anche a me! Dont change your opinion  Ill do the same.
I had the courage to watch the first four season, but my courage did not work with the fifth season - I have ceased to ruin my time with this thing. I'll try to forget it with a ballet from the Royal Opera House, a film with Cary Grant or Denzel Washington, an operetta by Franz Lehar, or, even, an episode of VERA!

I would advise you that on Season 3 the last disc you must click ""NEXT"" to find the final two episodes of that season and the season finale!!!!  It took us forever to figure out where they were as we begin watching Season 4 and realize we had missed the prior episode!",1531180800,,350,4.287878787878788

8765457,1,B01HH95M2M,"Love the show but disappointed that the plastic box for seasons 1 and 8 arrived broken today.  The other seasons were all in cardboard sleeves but 1 and 8 were not, and while shrink-wrapped, season 8 didn't even have the seal at the top.  Keeping for now as the disks LOOK ok and don't want the hassle, but hoping they aren't used (I paid 'new' price).  This one sold by 'popjaw'.  Also hoping the disks work properly and have good sound quality, given several other complaints posted.",1530576000,,485,4.540229885057471
