Old cartoons from 1920s to 1960s. Start out with soundless (non vocal) with just music sound tracts.
Nicely hand drawn art work, shows the progression of cartoons threw the years. You enjoy seeing the experimentation with body types threw the years, early stop motion,& several with true 3D backgrounds. And a real very seldom seen the ultra-early Disney cartoons ""Alice"". And a cartoon where a child is inserted into the cartoon. Which at the time was cutting technology.
The quality at times is questionable but that is due to the age of the film and play back equipment used during transfer ( a real shame). Otherwise this is a fun DVD to watch and enjoy with your family. I highly recommend it for that reason.",1342224000,4,873,5.67175572519084
4530158,4,B0052MXJ18,"This collection is most noteworthy for including some amazingly old cartoon (from 1920s to 1960s), including quite a few from the pre-sound era, hand-drawn, in black and white. If you're interested in the history of cartoons, this is it! Kids will like them regardless.

Lots of characters you probably haven't ever heard of, along with styles, cultural assumptions, etc. that are fascinating. There is typically more than one cartoon for each character, so often you'll see a *really* old cartoon from the silent era, and one made several years later with sound. But all cartoons have soundtracks, either music or voice.

The quality is not always great, but this is is due to the state of the films that were transferred.

It's interesting to see how much experimentation went on in the 1920s and 1930s - era cartoons. Body distortions are wild. There are several that have true 3D backgrounds, some deep-focus, and some are stop-motion. In some ultra-early Disney cartoons (""Alice""), a real child is inserted into a cartoon world. The difference between this and today's movies mixing live and CGI characters is a matter of degree, not concept. Cool stuff!

The only problem - no liner notes, you have to load the discs to see the cartoon listings.",1314057600,5,1251,4.942857142857143
4530159,5,B0052MXJ18,"I got this DVD at Target for $5.  We have a cross country car trip coming up and wanted to buy a few new DVD's for the kids.  I was astounded when I got home and saw what was on these DVDs.  The first one contains amazing old cartoons starting from the silent era of Disney.  Oswald the Lucky Rabbit and other period items are hilarious, you can't help but smile watching them.  All my kids loved them, from age 9 to 12.  At such a bargain price these DVDs are a steal.",1311379200,4,469,3.989247311827957
