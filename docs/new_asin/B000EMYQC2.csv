8111526,5,B000EMYQC2,"This documentary is pretty good, narrated alternately by a gentleman and a lady, Trudi Jo. She speaks for Marilyn as if it was her giving the commentary. The details are pretty good throughout the program as they cover not only her life, but her movie roles as they go by year by year. I enjoyed it and I think it was well put together. You may also want to get the documentaries ""Marilyn: The Final Days"" and ""Marilyn Monroe: Mortal Goddess"", ""The Legend of Marilyn Monroe ~ Hosted by John Huston"". Although this video says it shows the screen test for Marilyn, it is not completely there, it cuts off a few seconds of the end of it. I know, because I have it on another DVD in it's entirety.",1426032000,3,693,4.338461538461538
8111527,5,B000EMYQC2,"Since the editorial review and picture is for a completely different DVD then the listing title (apparently due to duplicate UPC numbers) this is the actual product description of ""Marilyn Monroe - We Remember Marilyn"":

Now for the first time ever, a pure entertainment show of Marilyn Monroe. You'll see film clips of Marilyn in over 25 of her most important films. Watch Norma Jean transform from a cuddly young teenager to the most recognizable face and body in the world. From bit parts in Love Happy and All About Eve to spectacular starring roles such as: There's No Business Like Show Business, Some Like it Hot, The Misfits, Gentlemen Prefer Blondes, Bus Stop, River of No Return, etc.

Plus - many rare photos and a new ""Marilyn"" song written especially for this show. And, as a bonus, you'll see Marilyn's original screen test for Asphalt Jungle, plus numerous TV appearances and very rare color home movies. We Remember marilyn is truly a visual feast.",1218067200,4,964,4.836363636363636
