8529233,5,B008NMX3OM,"This movie is so much fun. It has romance, drama, action, and of course singing and dancing. Oh and yes, if you do not speak Hindi, be prepared to read the subtitles. They are out of sync with the movie but after watching it a few times, you'll know what is being said.",1413936000,,269,4.09433962264151

8529237,5,B008NMX3OM,"I have become obsessed with Bollywood movies. I pretty much have lost all interest in western films at this point. I only watch western movies for my son and husband's sake. My preference is to watch Bollywood movies.

I watched Rowdy Rathore the other night straight through, which is saying something because it is 2 hrs and 38 minutes long. It was delightful from start to finish which is amazing because it is an over the top self aware comedy and those rarely deliver so consistently throughout a movie, let alone a 2 1/2 hour movie.

When I say this is a comedy, it is more accurate to say it is a comedy/action/romance/musical/thriller. The characters are delightful and have depth to them that isn't normally found in a comedy or action movie. The choreography was some of the best I've seen. the songs were catchy and fun and seriously, there is nothing not to like in this Bollywood movie.  Which is astonishing because self aware comedies don't always work and certainly not all the time. This one hits all the right notes at all the right times. Seamlessly moving from drama to over the top action to romance and to bawdy romance at that.

I've seen lead actor Ashkay Kumar in other movies, but this is the first time I've really understood what a talent he is. His dancing is amazing. And again, it's unexpected considering how big he is. He seems like he should be more awkward, but he is delightful to see dance and he really stands out against the back up dancers. He's better then all the rest and it is easy to see why he is the lead. He is a joy to watch and he nailed the ""Amitabh"" signature dance move perfectly during the gratuitous romance in a field near a river dance sequence which was a send up of classic Amitabh dance sequences from movies like Silsila . And again, the self aware comedy adds to the sequence and doesn't detract from it. They got the balance just right.

As for the music. I LOVED it. It was everything you want in a bollywood song or a bollywood dance sequence.

What Ashkay manages to do acting wise in this movie is really hard to do. He nails every scene. And again, it's self aware comedy. He dances well. And the dancing is over the top silly yet beautiful at the same time. They somehow managed to get that balance right. He sings well. Acts well (comedy, drama and romance were all required in this movie). In short. He is now one of my favorite actors.

The story line and plot are also engaging. I can't go into it here because a) it would spoil the movie and b) it's too convoluted to explain (as most Bollywood movies are). Suffice it to say, the plot is a good one so the comedy isn't just comedy for the sake of comedy, it is leading somewhere.

My only complaint is that the violence and gore was over the top too and it isn't a movie I would want my son to see. The romance part was fine, the comedy was fine. Most of the action sequences are fine. There is just a lot of gore and sadism near the end. Yes, it is needed for the plot, but it's just not appropriate for younger audiences.

If you are looking for a delightful romp that is action packed, bawdily romantic and fun with a tiny bit of a sadistic thriller thrown in for good measure towards the end. You won't go wrong with this film. I'm curious to see what others think about it. So if you've seen this movie, please let me know what you thought of it. I really liked it.",1365465600,,3395,4.333858267716535
8529238,3,B008NMX3OM,Not that good. I was not bored but was hoping it to be more entertaining. Not one of Akshay Kumars best at all..,1362614400,,112,3.9130434782608696
8529239,5,B008NMX3OM,This is one of my favorite Bollywood movies in a while. Fun and silly. And some really great music and dancing!,1356393600,,111,4.333333333333333
8529240,3,B008NMX3OM,"Who would have thought Sanjay Bhansali could come to this, i.e. wake up to the realities of film economies that movies are meant to be successful. He is the one- who specializes in making movies about humans in the worst of situations, either physical or psychological and no closure in sight. Sometimes his movies make money but most of the time they gain only adulation. However as a producer he has chosen to inflict the same pain as his characters endure on the audience. In Rowry, the cinematic liberties are many and the  story is as old as the hills, Shiva (Akshay Kumar) is a crook who falls for Priya (Sonakshi) and stumbles across a little girl, the daughter of his  policeman Vikram Rathore ( his lookalike) and ultimately clashes with gangsters who are out to get Rathore.
Prabhudeva brings his energetic direction and style to the movie, I hope that in the next film he works with a better script. There are moments of hope and some great one liners but the movie is nothing to talk about Akhsay Kumar works for the masses and gives them everything that they hope for in this film. Watch his use of the sugarcane, red chilli peppers, bees- very creative-hahaha
Sonakshi Sinha is pretty but has pretty much nothing to do except look pretty. Sajid-Wajid's music tries to make you dance, and partly succeeds. Aa Re Pritam Pyaare, Chinta Ta Ta, Dhadang Dhadang and Tera Ishq Bada Teekha have been pictured well.
The movie has all the makings of an entertainer and depending on your frame of mind and level of intoxication will permit you to enjoy the film. I could not see the film succeeding today but it has become one of the biggest grosser of 2012. A movie so bad that it is actually pretty good.three stars. 10/28/2012",1352764800,,1732,4.62012987012987
