3987350,4,B0001KL60C,"Adapting the timeless works of Dr. Seuss into feature films has proven to be a lucrative, if not always creatively successful venture. The problem has always been in finding a style that can adequately capture the author's unique style. Live-action movies like How the Grinch Stole Christmas were hamstrung by leaving the animated format, and The Cat in the Hat suffered a similar fate made worse by Mike Meyers' inability to be funny. A CGI version of Horton Hears a Who! better interpreted Seuss' daffy visual style, and that model is employed yet again with equal vibrancy in The Lorax, a film that shows the author's cautionary tale is as vital today as ever.

Dr. Seuss(real name Theodor Geisel), who never went into one of his many classic children's books with a moral in mind, nevertheless expressed many of his views on the world through his stories, with The Lorax perhaps being the most overt. Essentially a cautionary tale about the dangers of over industrialization on the natural environment, the rather simple story has been given some extra padding by the folks at Illumination, bringing some of the same zany humor from their hit, Despicable Me(including a couple of nods to the film). Taking corporate greed and ecological neglect to an apocalyptic nth degree, the story takes place in Thneedville, a city completely made up of plastic and not an ounce of nature in sight. A chirpy little song in the beginning tells us that the people of Thneedville like it this way, with their plastic trees and bottled air(a clear shot at those who pay for packaged water). 12-year old Ted(Zac Efron) exists in this bright but bland composite town, zipping past his blissfully unaware neighbors on his motor scooter. He's infatuated with his neighbor, Audrey(Taylor Swift), and when she expresses the desire to see an actual living tree, Ted makes it his life's mission to make sure it happens. Heck, he might even get a kiss out of the deal. With the help of his mischievous grandma(Betty White), Ted learns of a mysterious recluse outside of town known as the Once-Ler(Ed Helms), who may know where the last trees can be found.

Braving the smog filled world outside of Thneedville, and drawing the suspicion of the town's benefactor(Rob Riggle), Ted discovers the Once-Ler is a man burdened by years of guilt. The architect of Thneedville's creation and destroyer of the once plentiful Trifula trees, the Once-Ler was once just a man with a dream to strike it rich. Discovering that his silken invention could only thrive by chopping down all the trees, he runs afoul of the Lorax(Danny Devito), a little orange blob of a creature who serves as the spiritual protector of the forests. If Ted wants the last Trifula seed, he'll have to listen to the Once-Ler's story of how he let corporate greed blind him to the destruction being done to the world around him.

The Lorax has come under scrutiny lately from some who feel it's ""indoctrinating"" children to despise big business by painting them all as evil. Those dirty industrialists! The story is actually a redemptive one for all involved, not just the Once-Ler but for Ted also. Ted's mission starts off as completely selfish, he could care less about the environment or making the world a better place. He just wants to impress the hot girl in town. Through the Once-Ler's story, he learns to appreciate nature in all it's forms and the benefits it provides that plastic and steel simply can't replicate.  Those complaining about The Lorax's lessons either don't know the book has been around for some forty years, or have never seen the film. Probably both. Those same people, who always seem to make more noise equivalent to how wrong they are, fail to realize that The Lorax isn't all that different from most children's stories. Then again, these are also the same folks who think suggesting healthier meals for kids is akin to turning the country into a police state. It's all just nonsensical political pandering. The Lorax, who is friends with the Once-Ler early on, doesn't have a problem with industry. He gets angry when it destroys everything else just for some short term profit. Surely, somebody like Lou Dobbs can see the difference, right? Eh, probably not. He's not paid to understand nuance.

Directed by Chris Renaud, The Lorax is bold and dynamic visually, although the 3D adds little real value. Calling this simply a film for kids seems inadequate, because the message truly is universal and one that all people need to hear. It's about taking personal responsibility for the welfare of this planet. How something like that can be considered a hot button issue nowadays is absurd, but The Lorax gets its point across in the most fun way possible, just like Dr. Seuss would have wanted.",1332288000,14,4768,4.8597785977859775
3987351,4,B0001KL60C,"Don't let the hypocritical advertizing campaign turn you off of this new Dr. Seuss adaptation. Although the film, inevitably includes a lot of padding to make a 72 page book into a 90 minute feature but the movie retains the message of the original book. The movie has some pretty catchy songs and their aren't too many slapstick jokes and attempts to be ""hip"".",1331942400,12,361,4.65625
3987352,4,B0001KL60C,"The only Lorax story I knew was the 70's cartoon classic. This new movie seemed much different, but still good. It didn't have enough Lorax in it. When a boy named Ted tries to find a tree for a girl named Audrey, he meets the Once-ler and tells him the story about why there are no more trees. Ted tries to bring the trees back before the Mayor of Thneed-Ville tries to stop him. I'd probably recommend THE LORAX!!!",1331683200,,416,4.2784810126582276
3987353,3,B0001KL60C,"I guess because its meant for little kids, I found the movie ok. I saw this because I had a free movie ticket and nothing else was good in the theater. I mean I enjoyed it but it felt like a Dr. Seuss movie. There were rhyme after rhyme after ryhmes. I mean some were so bad, they were a tad lame. Some were very odd, that a codd croaked (oh my god, now Im talking in rhyme). Now the movie did have funny moments and I loved the voice cast but I felt this wouldve been a good rental unless you have kids.

One thing was that it had an obvious message of save the trees which was everywhere in the movie

Pros:
-Funny moments
-Voice actors
-Good rental

Cons:
-The rhymes
-The sillyness
-Obvious message",1331683200,,702,4.109489051094891
3987354,5,B0001KL60C,"The movie was funny, sad, and quite a great messeage for people who don't care about the enviroment or who want to get rich in a bad way. My husband and I adore the enviroment, my kids and I were planning to plant seeds to help the environment. The movie must teach you a lesson about keeping the natural beauty in the world instead of usg toxic waste or smog.",1331424000,4,360,4.1571428571428575
3987355,4,B0001KL60C,"Based upon the book by Dr. Seuss (whose name is officially part of the title), THE LORAX has been contemporized a bit making it accessible to not only super-environmental-types, but to those who were raised upon conservation and not environmentalism. In THE LORAX, Ted (Zac Efron) is a twelve-year-old boy who lives in the plasticized, walled city of Thneedville. Ted is in love with a teenage girl named Audrey (Taylor Swift). Audrey doesn't quite fit in Thneedville and paints the back of her house full of colorful trees which no longer exist. She longs to see a real tree and Ted becomes determined to find one for her. During dinner one night, Ted's Grammy Norma (Betty White) tells Ted that in order to find out what happened to the trees and if there's another one to be found, he needs to speak with the Once-ler (Ed Helms) who lives outside the city walls. Ted has never been outside the city, but sets out on a mission to meet the Once-ler and find a tree. He succeeds in finding the creature on the edge of town and the Once-ler tells Ted his story of how he started life off as an industrious, young man with a heart who just wanted to be a success, how he found a valley of paradise, and how he met The Lorax (Danny Devito). Before the story is through, the Once-ler's tale will merge with Ted's and perhaps revive the valley again.

Visually, THE LORAX is stunning. Both the natural beauty of the paradise valley and the plastic artificiality of Thneedville are full of bright and beautiful colors. These are contrasted by the present day greys of the world outside of Thneedville, the world that the Once-ler created.

The story stays fairly close to Dr. Seuss' original tale. However, there are a few differences. The Once-ler isn't a creature that's only seen by his hands, but instead has been transformed into a thin and tall man. When we first see the young Once-ler, there are distinct feelings of sympathy for him and empathy with his plight. It's hard to believe this industrious man will be responsible for cutting down all the Truffula Trees, but the temptations of family and fortune are strong. There are a couple of scenes in the forest that are added to pad the story. Also, instead of leaving at different times, the animals of the forest leave together in a mass exodus. Personally, I thought this element weakened the story.

Like the book, there is a strong conservationist message to THE LORAX, but I didn't see any anti-capitalistic undertones. The Once-ler is ""punished"" not because he was industrious and wanted to earn a living, but because he gave in to greed and destroyed the very thing that was allowing him to earn a living. Mr. O'Hare, the Mayor of Thneedville isn't a villain because he's a businessman, but because he's manufactured his fortune based upon a lie and even when confronted with the truth, he refuses to concede.

There's a lot of music in THE LORAX that comes in a variety of styles, folk, rock-a-billy, and some Broadway-type showtunes. Personally, I liked the smaller numbers which are mostly sung by the Once-ler (Ed Helms).

THE LORAX has broad appeal. It's a film that kids will enjoy for the characters and bright scenery, while many adults will enjoy for some of the subtle bits of humor. The mass consumerism message isn't as blatant as in WALL-E, but it's still there. Overall, it's a movie that The Lorax himself would probably enjoy watching.",1330732800,125,3413,4.691151919866444

3987565,1,B0001KL60C,"I loved the CGI version of ""Horton Hears a Who"", so I splurged on a streamed rental of this thing from this very website.  The story meanders and leaves the original ""Doctor Seuss"" tale by leaps and bounds, and throws in musical flourishes for a fairly one dimensional character who abuses nature with a smile on his face.  I seem to recall that the original Onceler from both book and TV special was a near ruthless mercenary businessman, who later on saw the errors of his ways, and we never saw his face.

But in this production we see some happy go lucky kid lie his way to financial success.  Not an old story, and one that's fairly familiar, but the tale never does anything with this concept.  As such, in spite of all of the energy put into song and dance numbers, as well as outrageous CGI gags, the movie has a kind of snails pace in terms of presenting its core theme.  It tries to dress up the story with flash, but none of that flash is pertinent to the core tale and core heart of said same story.

I'm giving this one star because the production team should have know better, but didn't.  And they spent a lot of money to dupe people like me into seeing a copy of this film

Well, I guess they got me.  Whatever.

Watch at your own risk.",1507248000,,1252,4.2405063291139244

The plush, although the main reason I ordered it, was more of a little bonus. The only reason for 4 instead of 5 stars was that the plush was even smaller than what I'd anticipated based on the picture. In the picture it matches the size of the DVD case. In person, it was a little smaller. Overall though, for the $9 we paid, I'm very happy with this purchase.",1482019200,,530,4.057142857142857

This story is somewhat difficult to follow, when compared to the book of the same name. However I think that's understandable given that they had to take a 20-page book and turn it into a full movie.

I just love the opening song and the lunacy that is our obsession with parking lots, followed by Let it Grow at the end.  And the lyrics in How Bad Can I Possibly Be ring so true.  My daughter and I sometimes break into song and sing these songs in the car.  They captured the beauty of pristine (though fantasy) nature, and maintained the style of Dr. Seuss without going overboard with it.

If I didn't have the self-control expected of a person my age, I might have destroyed it instead. There are so many wonderful children's movies available that are genuinely bright and funny and endearing, I cannot understand why someone would choose to add this to a permanent collection. The original book was a favorite of mine as a child and my own kids have loved it from the time they were old enough to sit still(ish) for the 20+ minutes it takes to read aloud. This movie adds nothing to the original story line, opting instead for pandering, superfluous characters and scenarios, and plenty of dripping neon visuals. I won't go into the musical portion of the experience, because I. Can't. Even. Two stars, because my kids seemed to enjoy it, (although they never asked to watch it again).",1464134400,,916,4.660493827160494

3988590,4,B0001KL60C,"Having watched some of this movie on TV, I was never fond of the animation or the story - but having completed my Disney 3D collection, I knew it was time to branch out. The stylistic nature of this film really shines in 3D, and the animation doesn't look low-budget like it sometimes does in the 2D version. The 3D effect is used in gimmicky situations more than other more 'sophisticated' titles, but in a world created by Dr. Suess, it makes so much sense and adds even more fun and whimsy to the film. My grumpy thirty-something year old boyfriend hated the songs, but there are only four (3 1/2, really) compared to Frozen's tedious nine, and even though I was skeptical at the beginning of each number, by the end I was humming along and curious if I could find them on digital music retailer sites (I could!). This film turned out to be a hidden gem for me and while I will probably never willingly watch it in 2D, I can't WAIT to watch it in 3D again - it was truly engineered for the format and was done so with a lot of love and care to the source material. It's not going to be your favorite animated 3D film, but you'll be happy you picked it up.",1458172800,5,1158,4.2207207207207205

Thankfully it didn't really catch on enough to inspire a generation of young kids to rise up and tear down factories or anything. Overall, I think most people can get with the message about how important trees are, even those who aren't gung-ho about treehugging.

However, I feel the message basically stayed the same. For me personally, it was a little too ""cheesy,"" but that could have been what they were going for. My kids really enjoyed it though & would watch it again. Other adults who were in the room enjoyed it as well, but no one called it an ""amazing"" movie, that's why I decided to rate it 4 stars. I think it's worth watching, but it's not one I would want playing over & over in my house. ;)",1450310400,,620,4.048780487804878

3988832,5,B0001KL60C,"I have this movie to watch on T.V. It is filled with all sorts of funny, sad, and exiting parts. You never know what may happen next. There are highlights, of course...

1. There is this person called Ted that is in love with this girl. But we don't know that yet...

2. You will see lots of plastic things- bushes, trees,... even grass!- at the beginning of the movie/story.

3. Ted makes a toy airplane land in the girls yard, so then he comes to pick it up.

4. ""Did you leave your plane in my yard AGAIN?"" She asks. ""Well, yeah."" Ted replies. So then the girl shows Ted something... truffila trees? Huh? Haven't seen that before. It's painted on her house. ""All I want is a real tree.""...

5. Ted comes home and tells his mom and grandma about the so-called visit. ""Then you need to see the once-ler!"" Says Ted's grandma.

6. So then the grand tells Ted about the once-ler. Now I may not have mentioned this, but the person who is in control of the city. And no one has ever gone outside of town (that's where Ted needs to go). So problem.

7. He goes anyway by himself. But the person who is in charge found out...which is a so-called problem.

What will happen? Will Ted be able to prove that the way they are living is wrong? Find out by watching this hilarious movie! I am Stephanie Cotton and I am 28 years old and live in Willistion, Vermont. It is a nice place there, in dead. Ok enough blabbering! Anyway hope you enjoy my review and the movie.

  Happy reading!",1438732800,,1474,4.247311827956989

3989036,5,B0001KL60C,"I am very disappointed in the poor reviews on this movie. After reading them, I've decided that many people missed the essential message of the story line.

Many have complained that the movie strays from the original environmental message and is bogged down by useless detail, but I beg to differ. The fact that the movie focuses on a kid (yes, a kid because what better way to appeal to the future by following a child's adventure into the world of change) and his determination to find the so-called tree for his crush only to find that he and the rest of the world ACTUALLY NEED trees is nothing, but incredible because he learned a valuable lesson and made a remarkable change once he realized that he had the power to do so (our children ARE the future). The emphasis on the ""bad guy"" that sells BOTTLED AIR of all ridiculous things is also essential because how many useless items do we buy on a daily basis because we feel that we need them when what we NEED is clean water and clean air, something the people of Thneedville didn't have unless it was surrounded by plastic? What is not ironic, to say the least, is that this bad guy is actually the mayor of Thneedville, a person of stature who has COMPLETE CONTROL over the minds of the citizens of Thneedville (and has a horrible Napoleon complex because of his lack of literal height, so he needs to make up for it by gaining material height, but, I digress) by marketing a completely natural resource and contributing to the the already deplorable environmental conditions found just outside the town walls. Those town walls also represent how closed-minded our society has become because we tend to only care about ourselves and what's going on here even though what's going on outside will ultimately be our demise if it continues on the trajectory is has taken for the several decades. Does excessive power by dominating the market ring a bell (I digress, again)? What struck home for me was when Audrey came home to find her beautiful, beloved mural destroyed by the town officials (and what's great about her is that her voice is none other than Taylor Swift, an INCREDIBLY INFLUENTIAL voice to millions of kids). That confiscation of art, a movement of free thinking, does nothing, but show that we are under the control of a higher power that will gladly take away our freedoms for person gains (i.e. selling pointless junk to us to make money). If bringing back trees to Thneedville means losing money on his BOTTLED AIR business, the mayor won't have it! Oh, no! Finally, the stereotypical happy ending that many have complained about is merely a window into a very possible and plausible future for our current environmental status. What's even better is that the Once-ler, the one responsible for the mess, was able to open that window and let in the fresh air of change. How joyous it is when you can fix your mistakes! Unfortunately, not everyone sees their mistakes or has the opportunity to fix them before it's too late. That symbolizes that WE STILL HAVE A CHANCE, so we need to take it before it slips through our greedy fingers like this planet and it's abundant and clean resources are doing at this very moment in time.

But how bad could we possible be.",1425254400,,3237,4.637630662020906

Since my computer does not have HD capabilities, most of my digital copies do not play. If you want to get access to the SD (Standard/Not HD) then you should redeem your code off a smart device such as an iPad or your phone. This lets you download the movie, on HD with Vudu, Ultra Violet and other options, and also gives you the option to download via iTunes - the Standard Version.

3989113,5,B0001KL60C,"I thought I would greatly dislike this as the man who voices the Lorax usually plays obnoxious characters & often screen adaptations of dr seuse can go either way... But all in all I said 5 stars because my kids love it and its very tolerable. There are some things like the bad song where the one character sings about how he can't be all that bad and its actually a bit frightening for very little kids and I'm not a huge fan of it but it is better actually that a lot of other kids movies so I actually bought a copy which I honestly wouldn't have done unless the kids really liked it. Its a repeat visitor to family movie night and we like the message and the boy and his family and the girl are very charming. The Lorax is actually not a huge part of the movie and I actually do like him and think he was cast properly. The animation is good as well and there is a clear bad guy and the message is clear which uncomplicates it for the kids. The environmental message is something our family can really get on board with. All in all good purchase, though if the kids didn't like it I would just have watched it once and moved on.",1420588800,,1133,4.108108108108108

3989175,4,B0001KL60C,"its ok for a kids movie..  I could bash on this movie hard.. but i think others have already done tht for me. I guess but if ya want something true to the book watch the original..

here's my list of pros and cons about it.

Pros

. Animation looked great

. Some of the songs I'll reluctantly admit are catchy

Cons

. Songs were mediocre at best in my opinion .. yes ""theedville"" is soo stupidly catchy but ""how bad can I be?' sounds like something i'd hear off of the Disney channel.  in my opinon ""Biggering"" would have suited the Once-ler soo much better.

. Non existent Romance between Ted and Audrey (two character I seem to forget) it feels so shoe horned  and clichd .

.  The whole O'Hare Air being the bad guy instead of the Once-ler  .

. The family of the Once-ler made it seem all the destruction he was causing wasn't at fault.

in a nutshell, I may be biased toward the original but tht version is worth much more than this version",1418428800,,948,4.188888888888889

When Ted introduces himself the the Onceler, and then again when the Onceler is singing ""How bad can I be"" it cuts out right In the middle of ""the customers are buying"" and the sound doesn't come back till a verse later.

3989396,1,B0001KL60C,"First of all,the only good things about this film are the A+ animation and the villain song: ""How Bad Can I Be?"" but the rest of the film stinks like a failed WCW pay-per-view. The cast are 1D cliches. No good pacing,no patience and no complexity what so ever. The story is sappy and dumbed down to the 12th degree. The message is hypercritical this side of Pokemon's ""Fighting is Wrong"" message. It has little-to-nothing to do with book(let alone the 1970's cartoon) and the stuff that does have to do with source material is a complete slap in the face. It's just a basic/lame Disney-style good vs evil. I give this film a 1 out of 10.",1399334400,,637,4.406779661016949

3989409,5,B0001KL60C,"This movie doesn't follow the book precisely, but it is exactly in the spirit of the book.  There is humor for boomers, their children, and their grandchildren.  Plus, the story has an environmental emphasis that is reasonable, with a depiction of how a good person can loose track of what's important because of the distractions of making a better life for himself.  Also, there are some short animations which expand on the characters in the movie and are hilarious.  This video is well worth the cost and will be viewed many times in my house.",1397088000,,546,4.71578947368421
3989410,1,B0001KL60C,"Not long ago a movie was made that ignored our enjoyment and was totally lame. It framed industrialization as an evil idear and riddled my six year old completely with fear. She was worried that all of our trees would expire and she asked many questions that made me feel tired. I tried to explain how businesses do, how they try to use resources efficiently too. Renewable resources are cheap to replace and this ensures that their profits aren't permanently erased. The materials cost money and as such wasting is bad but the portrayal in this movie was meant to make her feel sad. This was very complex for her six year old brain and on me and my wife it was a terrible strain. So if with your young kids you don't wish this to do you might be better off buying Horton Hears a Who.",1396483200,6,784,4.340136054421769

He hasn't wanted to watch many animated movies lately so I was surprised.  I liked the movie, the environmental aspect of it and the music.  It is cute.  There was one point when I thought ok, let's move it along, but all in all a nice movie for the family.",1396137600,,361,4.1

3989497,5,B0001KL60C,"Dr. Seuss was a genius. Even way back when in 1971 when he wrote ""The Lorax"" book, he was earth-conscious.
The makers of the movie version of The Lorax did a splendid job with communicating Dr. Seuss' moral of the story. I truly believe he would be proud.

Storyline:
The setting is in a futuristic world where you have to buy electric trees. There are no real plants or grass. Oxygen must be bought. One child swam in a lake and now glows green. A little later, there is a scene about Mr. O'Hare's inventors proposing the idea to sell ""bottled air"". They say ""research shows that people will buy ANYTHING if you put it in a plastic bottle!""

There is a boy(Ted) who likes a girl(Audrey). Audrey is fascinated with the idea of trees (no one really knows anything about trees except Ted's grandmother); to impress Audrey, Ted sets off on an adventure to find a tree to give his love interest, Audrey.
Ted's grandmother (Grammy) tells Ted to find the Once-ler to tell him about trees. So Ted leaves town- which is very difficult in search of the Once-ler. Outside the city walls, he finds a dark and dreary world. The air is polluted, the ground is bare and brown. There were no trees or plants in sight, nor people.
Ted finds the odd and secretive Once-ler far away.
The Once-ler tells Ted the story of trees:
The Once-ler set off to start his own business and came across a beautiful area full of Truffula trees, green grass, cute little bears and signing fish. He sets up shop and decides to use Truffula trees to make his Thneed (odd-shaped clothing that can be used for anything). He chops down the tree, which summons The Lorax. The Lorax ""speaks for the trees"". Basically, there is witty banter between the two (we thoroughly enjoyed this part) for a while. The Once-ler leaves to sell his Thneed in town, is rejected by the townspeople, then suddenly, the townspeople find the Thneed is the coolest thing ever (all because one lady accidentally wore it on her head. A typical ""movie-star"" looking guy notices the lady and says it's cool, then everyone wants one- sound familiar?)

The Once-ler's horrible, rednecky family comes to help him with his business once they find out he was successful. Much to The Lorax's dismay, the demand for Thneed and the Once-ler's families' demands, The Once-ler decides to cut down the Truffula trees to speed up production. Eventually, his business grows (shown through a musical scene with the song ""How bad can I be?"") and The Once-ler becomes corrupt from greed. He sings: ""lawyers denying"", ""I'm just doing what comes naturally"", ""people with the money make the world go 'round"", ""let me hear you say 'smogulous smoke'"", ""who cares if a few trees are dying?"". The world becomes polluted due to the factories, the wildlife must migrate somewhere else and finally, the Thneed fad dies out. The Once-ler's family ditches him once the fad is over and he finally sees what damage he's done.
We see Mr. O'Hare coming up with the idea to sell air when he sees someone coughing due to the pollution.

Back to Ted, The Once-ler makes him prove he is dedicated to the trees by making him come back the next day. When Ted tries to leave the city, Mr. O'Hare and his gooneys catch up with him and threaten him. He tells Ted he has eyes everywhere. Ted goes back and hears the rest of the story.

The Once-ler decides to give Ted the very last Truffula seed and places his hope in Ted to stop the cycle of pollution.
Ted goes back to the city. Mr. O'Hare finds out Ted left again and shows up at his house. He threatens Ted, then his mom, then a chase ensues. Eventually, the chase ends with Ted cracking the artificial ground and trying to plant the seed. Everyone gathers around and O'Hare tries to convince everyone what Ted is doing is bad: he spreads lies (aka fear mongering) about trees. The ignorant citizens believe him, but the man working under him stands up and speaks out (it only takes one!) Then the town ensues in a song about ""letting it grow"" <great song!
Everyone decides to side with Ted and they plant the seed.
Back at the Once-ler's,  we see him outside watering growing Truffula trees. The scene ends with the stone that says ""Unless"", which was put in place by the Lorax.

This movie has great meaning! It has received a lot of criticism. The reason I'm adding this to my review is to help individuals understand this movie as a whole, and get them ready for what they are going to see: (I've heard quite a few people become offended thinking this movie was geared towards themselves or that it was too political)

One- people complain it is demeaning to women because Mr. O'Hare demands cookies from Ted's mother, then tells her to go back downstairs into the kitchen. Mr. O'Hare is THE BAD GUY, meaning he is supposed to be a jerk, the opposite of what people SHOULD BE. And there is a line where The Lorax says ""that's a woman?"" to the Once-ler's aunt...She is also one of the ""bad guys"", of course she is going to be teased, she was wearing a dead animal, kind of like the Lorax's fuzzy bear friends. Yet critics never talk about when Ted's mom stands up to Mr. O'Hare, or how talented Audrey is at painting, or how Grammy is an agile, energetic woman who excels in motor coordination.
Critics also never mention how The Once-ler's mom was the one who ran the show, gave him all the information and guidance to run a business (even if it was wrong, still, she can be seen as having power and business savvy).
2- Attack on certain political parties- look, no one in this movie sat there and referenced the words ""democrat, republican or independent"" at any point. Take this movie how you want- but it is incorrect to say the movie is attacking a party, especially because that would mean the party is admitting to committing all the things O'Hare did (or the parties' ideas on environmental protection). As I said, take the movie how you want, if it offends them, then don't watch it again...
3- Global Warming/Environmental debates- this movie talks about pollution and what pollution can do. Can pollution cause poor air quality and coughing? Yes. Does cutting down every single tree on the planet cause wildlife displacement? Yes. Do trees supply oxygen, needed to supply breathing in humans? Yes. But remember, this is a movie, talking about POSSIBILITIES of air pollution (and the fact-based consequences). It is a movie, meant to be extreme, not talk directly about global warming- just how cutting down trees and factories emitting fumes is dangerous to health- not the whole world is going to die, the icebergs are going to drown us all...

Moral of the story:
*GREEDY big businesses that don't take the extra effort to protect our environment have the potential to ruin it. (Evidence: The Once-ler was doing just fine harvesting the Truffula trees, not chopping them down until the seed of greed was in his ear that to make money fast- there must be a sacrifice somewhere, why not the environment?) You can still be successful and take care of the environment, even if it means going the extra mile to do so.

*It is never too late to take care of the planet (evidence: the song says: ""it's just one tiny seed"". Their world was extreme, yet ONE person was able to change the world)

*Be an individual, don't listen to what everyone else is saying (evidence: O'Hare's lies about trees being dangerous, then townsfolk choose to make up their own mind and give it a try. Ted chooses to go against the grain and find out more about trees, even when threatened. Teasing of the Thneed fad- just because one ""cool"" guy liked the Thneed, everyone went nuts)

*Enjoy the natural world we have (evidence- The Once-ler taking care of his newly growing Truffula trees, enjoying them. The fact the man was coughing once the air was totally polluted, making it hard to breathe)

I loved this movie! My 2 1/2 year old son, and the 10 & 14 year olds I went with to see it loved it. Good morals, funny, cute and uplifting at the end. I would recommend this movie to everyone- time for the world to ""let it grow!""",1387584000,,8065,4.576869806094183

In the movie, a 12 year old boy lives in a plastic world called Thneedville.  He's never even seen a real tree before.  The trees in his town work on batteries!  The boy falls in love with a teenage girl who is into trees, and thus embarks on his adventure to find a real tree....

This movie is never boring due to it's fast paced crazy silly style.......it's also not obnoxious in that new age way that so many movies fall into.  The graphics are great!

3989613,4,B0001KL60C,"When it comes to children's films, I'm a hard man to please.
If I was going by my rating I would give this film 3 stars, since it does not just hit you over the head with it's overtly environmental message so much as beat you unconscious with it. Then it stands over your prostate body and sings Taylor Swift songs as it bludgeons you to death. Even as your last breath escapes your lips, it reminds you to save the trees in the cheesiest, most blindingly in-your-face way.

OK. Rant over. I promise.

The fact is, The Lorax is a success. Why? Kids love it! And that's all there is to it. My younger brothers and sisters will watch this any time it comes on. The movie successfully captures the whimsy and wit of Dr. Seuss, without veering into weird territory (Horton Hears a Who). The visuals are bright and colorful, the songs are catchy and fun, and the characters are Seuss-y and funny. The voice work is excellent. Best, the humour is funny and constant without being crude or stupid. So for that, I say Dr. Seuss's The Lorax (overtly obvious environmental message aside) is a WIN. 4 Stars!

Yay. You've had your fun and games. Let's get down to more serious topics.

Does this film have a far, far darker, more hideous message? I think The Lorax is better seen, not as a whimsical children's musical, but as a chilling, Gilliam-esque dystopia. Oh yes...let me show you what I am talking about.

This is the way I see The Lorax:
A young, enterprising man wanders the world in search of his calling. He ventures upon a pristine utopian valley where nature lives in harmony. He then proceeds to tear down and destroy everything that is good in that valley in the name of industry. He forms a bond with a mythical beast called the Lorax, whom he betrays and stabs in the back.

The man becomes a billionaire through every one of the dirtiest tricks in the book. But when a global fuel crisis forces the man to halt his empire of industry, every living thing in the valley is forced to leave their home. They are never seen again. The man's global empire collapses, leaving him destitute and impoverished. He takes to a cottage, where he is never seen again for many years.

Another young man sees his chance, and this is where it really gets disturbing. So far this story has had maybe a bit of Scarface in it - the rise and fall of an icon. It's a typical by-the-numbers sci-fi. But it's about to get a whole lot weirder.

Fast-forward 50 years. Everybody is abnormally happy. They break into song, and, at times, the whole city knows the lyrics, suggesting perhaps a collective-thought transmitter. Or a lot of brainwashing. You see, this idyllic paradise slowly comes apart to reveal something unbelievably hideous. The people seem oblivious to their problems - children glowing green with radiation poisoning, terrible traffic accidents, and dangerous and daring underground rebels.

The young man - now perhaps in his 70's (I deduce this by the fact that everyone - even people in their 50's have never seen trees, which makes the man at least 20 years older) looks unchanged through some radical plastic surgery, perhaps. He has trapped every known human being on the earth inside a walled city, where he feeds them bottled air. What else does he put in the air? How come nobody knows the truth?

Commence a rebellion led by a young girl, a love-stricken boy who will do anything for that girl, an aged grandmother, and the ax-wielding former billionaire, that will strike the very foundations of the established order.

...

How's THAT for original? Anyways, The Lorax is a great kids movie that will keep them entertained and, hopefully, inform them that all life on Earth is precious. The critic in me wants to rate this film 3 stars or lower, but I do not think this is a film FOR critics. It's for the kids. And that is where it succeeds.

4 Stars!",1374624000,,3862,4.571635311143271

3989616,3,B0001KL60C,"This movie goes all ballistic in its message to save trees. Unfortunately, it tries too hard without really being sincere and loses its appeal in the process.

The reason for my above observation is because I had ordered Princess Mononoke along with this movie and found that Hayao Miyazaki tackled the issue (man vs. nature) in a far more sensible manner than the makers of The Lorax.

Now, it can be argued that the target audience of these two movies are different with The Lorax focussed more on the small children. This is not an entirely invalid argument, considering that the movie is based on the story by Dr. Seuss. However, today's children are far more aware of the issue than what the film-makers would like to believe.",1374278400,,731,4.703125

When I saw it was on here in just dvd form I had to buy it. I'm so glad its apart of my collection of movies. Can't stand stores that only sell it with Blue Ray discs. Not everyone has a Blue Ray player or wants one. Definitely one of my favorite animated movies of this generation.",1373673600,,451,3.860215053763441

3989640,2,B0001KL60C,"Colorful is about the only good thing I could come up with about this film. Even if I could overlook the glaring political agenda that is slathered all over this terrible adaptation of Dr. Seuss' book. At the very least they could have coupled it with a good story - I guess they were trying to be another FernGully, but they failed on every level.

They could have just let Danny DeVito stand up and say, ""Big business is bad, rich people are bad, and they are going to destroy our planet.""

It wasn't funny. It wasn't entertaining. It was just a terrible 1.5 hour chore. Fortunately, it was only a $2 mistake.",1372204800,,611,4.398230088495575

3989644,5,B0001KL60C,Fun movie for kids and adults alike.  Also the Amazon instant feature works tremendously without a single hiccup.  We actually watched it twice in the 48 hour rental period and both times the family was satisfied.,1372204800,,213,4.888888888888889
3989645,5,B0001KL60C,"One of our favorite movies. Yes, there's a pro-environmental propaganda message, but if you agree with the message, it makes the movie that much more enjoyable.

3989650,5,B0001KL60C,"I guess you could argue that this is a tree-hugger movie, but I just watched it for entertainment without trying to ascertain if it had an ""agenda"".  With that in mind, I adored this movie.  It was funny, the kiddo I was with was highly entertained, and the kid in me was also highly entertained.  I had avoided this movie thinking it had nothing to offer, and maybe it was due to low expectations, but it greatly surpassed what I thought it would be.  I think it has a good overall message, even if it does cross over into a anti-corporation rant at times.  I can live with it though, if it helps teach kids to appreciate nature and the world around them.",1371772800,,656,4.300813008130081

While it is obviously animated, there is an adult story line which are kid friendly. I'm an environmentally conscious person so this movie was right up my alley. As for the nieces, aged 5 and 9 years old, they loved it and we watched it multiple times. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because it didn't completely knock me off my feet - I reserve 5 stars for movies that I would take to a deserted island.

It bears only the most passing resemblance to Dr. Seuss's book or the previous shorter cartoon movie. The book is pretty heavy-handed with the environmental message for an adult (though I never noticed it as a child), the movie even more so. The allusion to the bottled water industry is blatant to the point that it loses any fun factor. Overly technological, overly futuristic, overly far from the actual book. And it abandons the original framing device of taking place in a desolate wasteland, then being transported by The Once-Ler's words to the colorful past of the story. I hate it.

Great movie, beautifully and expressively animated, with some intense edge-of-chair scenes.  If one were to use this movie to open up a conversation with (say) young people about the value of nature, the only caveat I would express would be that there is a clear ""bad guy"" in the movie -- and he is BAD, there is just nothing likable about him at all.  While that might make the story easier and more fun to tell, of course it isn't really true that some evil guy (or guys) is responsible for all the devastation we have seen.  Then again, we do have a more compassionate view of the guy who started the whole mess, which is refreshing!  So The Lorax is a great jumping off point for a conversation about that, and how human interaction with the natural world has changed...and how we can each keep changing for the better.",1365897600,2,928,4.435294117647059

3989738,4,B0001KL60C,"I've got to admit that while 2008's Horton Hears a Who! proved Dr. Seuss' material seemed custom tailored to the computer generated animation movement, the story lacked that degree of relate-ability we generally associate with the classics.  While Horton was done by Ice Age's Blue Sky Studios, the 2012 follow-up Seuss to CG piece (The Lorax) was handed off to Illumination Entertainment, the guys who brought us Despicable Me.  To cut to the chase, The Lorax is very enjoyable animated entertainment.  It's got a few flaws and there are the semi-legitimate balks of conservatism plaguing the piece but we'll get to these issues.

Coming in at a runtime of 86-minutes, The Lorax wears a PG rating for animated violence and tension but there's no inappropriate language or adult-themes to worry about here.  Costing $70-million to make, the film actually managed to break even in its domestic opening weekend and has since gone on to take in close to $250-million.  In short, while critics were less than impressed with it, The Lorax is considered a resounding commercial success and continues Illumination's impeccable track record of making hits.

The story, like the book it's based on, tells of a young boy who goes seeking the truth about what ever happened to real living trees in a town that is complete and utterly artificial.  However, while the book had but a few pages of Seussian verse to tell its tale of environmentalism, a full length feature film would require far more setup to keep from dragging out and there are some creative licenses taken as a result.  Among these 12-year old Ted (named after Dr. Suess himself; Theodor Geisel), in effort to impress an older red haired high-school girl (Taylor Swift), takes interest in these ""tree things"" and ventures beyond the walls of his fenced-in town to meet up with a mysterious hermit called the Once-Ler.  The Once-Ler (Ed Helms) eventually agrees to tell Ted (Zac Efron) all about his past and what part he played in the obliteration of the forest and resulting exodus of the wildlife that lived in it.  Thus is the movie's greatest strength and arguably its biggest fault when compared to the source material:  There's an undeniably human element present here that harkens back to such other animated films in recent memory as Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs or say Ratatouille to mention a few.

Additionally new to the fold is a villain designed to personify corporatism with some beautifully rendered yet hideous hair and a crew of voiceless lackeys.

The titular character appears in the Once-ler's flashback as a ""voice for the trees"" and comes into the film amidst a whole ensemble of characters beautifully transitioned into 3D directly from the pages of the book including those colorful fuzzy-top trees, marshmallow-eating bears and crooning fish.  This part of the film literally breaks down the limitations of the computer color pallet and just how much color the human brain is capable of processing simultaneously.  The Lorax really is a difficult character to flesh out if you think about it and in the end the gruff Danny DeVito does a pretty admirable job of bringing life to the mustachioed orange ball of fur.  While a strong argument could be made that the character is a bit too abrasive to do the book-character justice, I found him appealing in a sort of sensible Yosemite Sam kinda way.

A lot of critics fault the film's pro-environmentalist/ anti-consumerism message, which truly is none too discrete here but it's a rather ridiculous complaint considering that is the core theme of the book on which it's based.  When one stops to consider that consumerism is the very fabric of a successful movie (or book), it's a rather annulling lesson but the way I try to reason it, there are far worse messages coming out of Hollywood.  Besides, the narrative of the film does its best to never take itself too seriously with abundant musical numbers and physics-defying silliness.

In all I came away from the piece impressed with some of its visual prowess and particularly impressed with the humor surrounding lead character Ted's interaction with his family.  This piece is certainly an improvement over Horton Hears a Who! and is leaps and bounds better than recent live-action incarnations of Seuss' material (such as Cat in the Hat).  If not quite worthy of adding to your collection, you really can't go wrong with a rental on this one.",1365292800,,4432,4.92741935483871

Nice visuals, but the way they adapted the story wasn't really ideal for cinema, i thought. Also, the songs weren't great, catchy, or well-placed. It wasn't terrible, just...okay.",1362787200,,357,4.774193548387097
3989801,5,B0001KL60C,"I was skeptical of this movie.  Horton Hears a Who was ok but not a keeper for us.  Plus I was sort of bugged that 7th Generation picked it up and was using it for advertising.  I am not a fan of characters selling products, the product should do that on it's own.  Anyway....

This was such a good movie.  There are so many hilarious little side things that make you laugh, fuzzy bear defibrillation as an example.  The music is great, the message is good, and I think they did a spectacular job fleshing out the story without losing the integrity of the original Dr. Seuss story.",1362787200,,581,4.324074074074074
3989802,2,B0001KL60C,"I was pretty disappointed by this movie.  It was slow and the basic plot (the boy trying to plant a tree to impress a girl) was pretty thin.  I did like some of the music and The Lorax himself was pretty cool.  However, this will not go on my list of movies to watch again any time soon.",1362787200,,287,3.913793103448276

3989808,5,B0001KL60C,"Great movie continuing the trend for Dr Seuss films (with the sad exclusion of the live action Cat In The Hat).  This film departs from the recent trend to bring young children's books to the screen with live action (Grinch, Cat In The Hat, Where The Wild Things Are) and for good reason.  With the sole exception of the Grinch (possibly due to the incredible casting of that film), these books don't translate all that well into live action and leave the viewer wondering who they were made for.

This doesn't do that.  It is lots of fun and while the territory has been plumbed by many others, this version of the envronmental/ecology story stands up very well.  Only Wall-E did it better.",1362528000,,691,4.585365853658536

The Once-ler means well, but he is caught up in the futile quest for his mother's love, which unfortunately, he never gets. What he does get, though, is a second chance brought on by an idealistic young boy in love with an older woman (which is all the rage these days ;-) That young boy, inspired by his heart's desire's love for trees embodies the essence of ""UNLESS.""

3989865,2,B0001KL60C,"Why does Hollywood seem to stumble so badly whenever it decides to make a film with an environmental message?  It seems that almost any movie I've seen that tries to have a ""save the Earth"" message comes across as preachy and heavy-handed.  ""Ferngully: The Last Rainforest,"" ""The Day After Tomorrow,"" James Cameron's ""Avatar,"" the horrible remake of ""Day the Earth Stood Still""... all of them seem to prefer beating us over the head with environmentalist propoganda over telling a decent story.  There are a few decent ones that manage to balance their message with a well-told story and likable characters (I'll get to those at the end of the review), but for the most part I've seen enough ""save the Earth"" films that favor preaching over quality that I instinctively cringe whenever the issue comes up in a movie.

""The Lorax,"" based on one of my favorite Dr. Seuss books growing up, falls into the ""too preachy"" to be enjoyable category, and isn't helped by all the usual suspects when it comes to animated kids' films, especially kids' films based on children's books.

The film takes place in Thneedville (a location not in the original book), an over-the-top city where everything is plastic and artificial, including the trees, and the air and water are so badly polluted that a child who goes swimming comes out glow-in-the-dark and the citizens must buy bottled air to live.  Our main character (nameless in the book, called Ted here) decides the best way to impress a girl he likes is to find an extinct, nearly-mythic object called a tree and give it to her.  Following his kooky grandmother's advice, he visits a crotchety recluse called the Once-ler, who tells him the sad story about how he destroyed Thneedville's environment despite the efforts of a guardian creature called the Lorax, and gives him the key to restoring the trees and repairing the damage he did.  The greedy, over-the-top mayor of Thneedville considers Ted's efforts a threat, however, and plots to thwart his plans...

The original book is a classic, a bittersweet plea to take better care of our world and take responsibility for our actions.  In my honest opinion, it would have performed much better as a half-hour TV special than as a full-length movie, and padding the story's length with a romantic subplot, cartoony antics, and badly-written musical numbers (seriously, these are some the weakest songs I've heard in an animated movie since ""Quest For Camelot"") just makes it painfully obvious that there wasn't enough story to fill an hour and a half.  When will Hollywood learn that stretching a children's picture book into a feature-length movie rarely works?  (I'm looking at you, ""Polar Express"" and ""Ant Bully..."")

The movie has all the attention span of a goldfish, with too-bright colors, characters that never seem to hold still, and an unrelenting pace that never pauses to let the viewer breathe and process what they've seen.  The characters are, with a few exceptions, either bland or just plain annoying.  Said exceptions are Ted's spirited grandmother (voiced quite appropriately by Betty White) and the bombastic mayor, an over-the-top villain who provides the most laughs in the film.  The title character himself suffers the worst, however -- he's reduced to a minor role, with Ted and the mayor hijacking the film, and he goes from a wise guardian character to a cranky wisecracker.  I also felt that Danny Devito's voice did not fit the original character, and that the character was rewritten to fit the actor, when it should have been the other way around.

And yes, the film gets incredibly preachy, so much so that it becomes tiresome to watch.  It's possible to make a children's movie that has an environmental message without being terribly heavy-handed about it (such as WALL-E), but ""The Lorax"" manages to miss the mark.  It doesn't help that it was also a merchandise-driven film, which rather goes against its anti-materialistic message.

While not an entirely terrible film, neither is this necessarily a good film.  It will entertain young children, I'm sure, but I imagine older children and most adults would quickly grow annoyed with it.  The fact that it butchers and pads out a beloved children's book doesn't help it either.

For a better film that manages to carry its environmental message quite well without sacrificing storytelling, I recommend the aforementioned ""WALL-E"" or Miyazaki's ""Castle In the Sky"" or ""Nausicaa: Valley of the Wind.""  Or seek out the 2D animated ""Lorax"" special -- it's more faithful to the book.",1360800000,,4559,4.982849604221636

3989944,4,B0001KL60C,"The kids liked it so it was fine with me.  But it's the standard story of capitalism run amok.  And maybe that story needs to be told over and over, look at the early 1900s where they wiped out all the game animals before game laws and cut down almost every single tree in places like WV.  There was no consideration for sustainability and now there is.  I would hate to go back to no conservation.  I like to hunt and if you don't conserve the game, there is nothing to hunt.

The movie itself is very well done so it got 4 stars from me.  Plus, like I said, the kids liked it.",1359244800,,578,4.017543859649122

3989965,5,B0001KL60C,"So many of Dr. Suess'books are made into modern day movies with an added innuendo for the adult's benefit. What I love about The Lorax is that it stays pure, aside from the obvious immoral dilemmas, and focuses on good, clean, family entertainment.  As an adult, I always appreciate seeing books from my childhood, or any children's book made into film form, keep their integrity and innocence; After all, they're being made for children, not adults, the innuendo is just offensive. So I was thrilled to see the integrity upheld with this film, Suess would be proud!

That said, I love the adaptation itself and how it includes the story while modernizing it to this day and age, creating a problem that could easily happen.  The environmental issue is upon us, and while moviegoers might feel this is a bit shoved down there throat or even like an advocacy film, this is just the way of The Lorax.

The vibrancy of the movie is amazing, I just love the colors and contasts of everything. The trees themselves, while looking more like cotton candy on a sick, are beautiful, as is the plastic, modern town itself. The creatures are adorable, and you can't help but fall in love with the cute little bears as they putter around, the fish as they walk on land, and even The Lorax himself as he goes out of his way to annoy and protect.

The moral of the story is a strong one, and one that every child needs to watch, hear and hopefully understand.  With the catchy music added, an exciting side plot and crush, most kids won't have a hard time following this at all.

This movie happens to be the very one me and my now boyfriend chose for our first date almost a year ago, and we both loved it. We watched it again tonight with my six year old, who objected thinking it was a ""baby movie"", but then she sat through it enthralled and laughing.  It was nice watching it again for us also and remembering that first date, and how the movie teared us both up.  But I digress.

A great film, highly recommended, five stars +",1358899200,,2018,4.444444444444445

3990012,4,B0001KL60C,My Niece and I watched this movie together we both enjoyed it.  Good life lesson on taking care of the earth.  But also it showed that it is never too late. People can right wrongs and undo past mistakes.  Its also some pretty funny lines that my Niece couldn't help but repeat. (That's a WOMEN!!!),1358208000,,298,4.381818181818182

It sends a great message that kids can easily grasp, and it does this without becoming preachy which is all too easy. I thought Wall-E was too much, but this one strikes the right balance for me~!

I wasn't much of a big 3D fan at first but seeing these movies at home, they're starting to grow on me. Plus it's nice to have at least three formats when buying Blu-Rays now, for the price I feel like I get my money's worth.

 So far, this movie and Finding Nemo are definitely movies to check out for the 3D. Avatar is in the mail and can't wait to see it again since the theatrical release in 3D.",1358121600,,545,3.9454545454545453

We love the versatility of this with the DVD for the car, the Blu-ray for home and the digital copy for the tablets.  Gotta see it!",1357862400,,385,4.380281690140845

Not a fan.",1357776000,,328,4.2063492063492065
3990044,1,B0001KL60C,"Being a fan of Dr. Seuss, I was looking forward to watching this animated film.  It was a huge disappointment.  I contrast this experience with re-watching a Charlie Brown Christmas, which was made in 1965.  Although some of the animation was interesting, they went way overboard trying to make this movie into a in-you-face, fast action film.  Maybe this is the current status of animation?  Anyway, as a result, the filmakers of The Lorax completely lost the subtlety in Dr. Seuss's message.  While I understand they need to stretch a short book that you can read in minutes into a feature length film, they probably shouldn't have tried.  In my opinion, they just killed the entire book.",1357776000,23,690,4.846153846153846

3990053,1,B0001KL60C,"I was very disappointed in this movie....it turned out to be a polemic of being very anti-big business and pro-environmentalism....typical liberal propaganda at its best. We need cotton to make our clothes. We grow the cotton, pick it and turn it into clothes, and then the Cotton grows back and the process starts all over again, but not in this world apparently. The trees once they're processed die off for whatever reason. Again, typical liberal propaganda. Aside from the 3d modeling, I have nothing to recommend for this movie. Im just sorry for all the schoolchildren who are no doubt going to grow up brainwashed with this piece of tripe. They should however, made the grinch using 3d computer modeling as well as the Cat in the Hat, instead of having actors embarrass themselves in rediculous costumes.",1357689600,7,811,4.927007299270073

As for my review of the movie, if you are a true Seuss fan, you will like his ""corny"" way of expressing his opinions.
Now, about the movie (just in case you don't know), the movie was on the banned list In California some time back.  It is more about ""green"" issues which would have horrified my husband since he is a Mining Engineer (tee hee).

3990160,4,B0001KL60C,"I kind of loved `Horton Hears a Who'.  It was fun and exciting and beautifully colored, and the moral and slight nod to deeper things (like belief in God) was expertly played to not be preachy but inspiring.  With that hanging over my head, I was really excited to see what `The Lorax' had to offer.  Being Seuss's ode to nature preservation, I had actually never read the book, but the movie looked cute and charming and so I wanted to see it.

It was cute and charming, but little else.

The film tells the story of young Ted living in Thneedville, a town made completely of plastic that has no natural growth and an atmosphere so dire the townsfolk are forced to buy bottled air by a zillionaire who keeps a close watch on the town to make sure that no one interferes with his money-making schemes.  The thing is, the town is perfectly ok with their manufactured lives and never bats an eyelash at the problems they seem to be facing.  Ted is in love with Audrey, who dreams of trees, and so he makes it his goal to find her one.  With the help of his crazy grandmother, Ted travels outside the city walls and meets the Once-ler who informs him of how Thneedville got its start and what Ted needs to do to save it from itself.

He has to plant a seed.

The color palate is pleasant, the jokes are plenty and the musical numbers are snappy and yet at the end of it all I felt like `The Lorax' was somewhat stagnant in its message.  The situation in Thneedville was too boisterous to warrant change and I found that the ending seemed almost out of nowhere, with people realizing that nature was important.  It just didn't feel like it ever really explained to us or even showed us why this was such a big deal.  I understand why it was, and I totally understand the importance of preserving nature, but I just didn't feel like `The Lorax' represented that properly.  The story told was interesting and funny and cute and overall very entertaining, but it didn't say all that it intended to, at least not in my opinion.  Still, I recommend it to families because it will entertain the entire family.",1356912000,,2099,4.387596899224806

We have realized that she prefers either an episode of Sesame Street, an animated movie (like The Lorax), or a Disney movie.  The Lorax is by far her favorite thing to watch on the television.  When mommy and daddy put on The Lorax, our daughter will sit in her tiny toddler chair and watch the entire thing without moving a muscle.  Part of me wonders if this is 'healthy', but the far less neurotic and over analytical side is overjoyed by watching my daughter enjoy something so much.  For halloween, I sewed her a Lorax costume and she was a HIT!  Thank you for making this movie.  Now it's time to make it into a musical!!!",1356825600,,683,4.416

3990200,5,B0001KL60C,"The Lorax says of a single seed:  ""It's not what it is, but what it can become.""  Indeed.  The same may be said of this movie as a whole, and of the children who will love watching it.  The Lorax is a magical being that speaks for the trees, but in the end there's a boy who also speaks for the trees.  It's not too preachy, but it does make the point.  And it does so with great humor (that's Dr. Seuss) and terrific animation.  You'll want to watch it several times to get all the jokes.  Also, have a box of tissues handy, as it may well make a grown-up cry.  Kids, on the other hand, are more direct: they laugh, they cheer, they recognize the value of the things that grow.

If you don't love this film, try the Grinch instead.",1356652800,,732,4.055944055944056

No!  All the ""bad guys"" want to accomplish here is pointless destruction and pollution.  It seems that they would actually be happy being be LESS successful, but only as long as more innocent destruction is guaranteed along the way!  TWO WORDS:  Cliche and Microcosm....  So sad that we have come to this as a people.",1356134400,11,495,4.686046511627907

3990383,1,B0001KL60C,"Cute is fine.  There were some funny parts with the kid's mom and Disco music.  But the commentary on the EVIL corporations was pathetic as if governments were never EVIL or rapacious of the land.  Just look at Eastern Europe's environment when the Iron Curtain fell.  It wasn't private corporate greed or capitalism that ruined the rivers and streams in Eastern Europe.

I can appreciate hyperbole.  This movie shows an extrapolation of policies that focus on making a buck today, with no view of the future sustainability.  I just reject the indoctrination of children to have the mantra, ""evil corporations"" pushed into their heads under the guise of a cute Seuss film.",1355961600,12,672,4.946428571428571

Kids sat through it and asked to watch it a couple more times, but it has already been forgotten.  They also weren't interested in the 70's version - so their opinion has been officially negated in my household.",1355875200,,384,4.305555555555555

3990538,4,B0001KL60C,"A story about the importance of the environment, Dr. Seuss' original story was years ahead of its time. This movie brings it into the current time, and almost ahead of it. Environmentalism is a big topic of discussion now, more than it was when the story was first written, and this movie is a very real reminder of what could happen if we ignore things for too long.

""Dr. Suess' The Lorax"" tells the story of a boy named Ted who, acting on the words of his Grammy Norma, travels from his home in Thneedville to find the Once-ler. With a little persuasion, the Once-ler begins to tell the story of why the Truffula forest no longer exists and who is to blame for it.

Several big-name celebrities lend their voices to roles, including Zac Efron as Ted, Taylor Swift as Audrey (Ted's love interest), Betty White as Grammy Norma, and Danny DeVito as the Lorax himself. Unfortunately, Zac Efron and Taylor Swift have no songs of their own. I found some of the acting to be a little wooden at times, but overall it was pretty good.

The animation is wonderful. The bright colors of Thneedville and the forest before the Once-ler arrived contrast greatly with the state of the forest in Ted's time. The animators truly brought life and character to the the Bar-ba-loots, Swomee-Swans, and Humming-Fish that made their home among the Truffula trees. Unlike the original story, the Once-ler is given a face, which allows the audience to connect with him a bit more than if he was simply a pair of arms. He also has the distinct personality of someone who is determined to make it big and isn't willing to let things get in his way. In the end, he digs his own grave by destroying the entire Truffula forest.

The music is very upbeat and is meant to appeal to the younger audience. Personally, I found the musical numbers somewhat painful to listen to. I didn't feel that they were that well done, although they did immediately get stuck in my head.

Overall, I enjoyed the movie. The personality of the characters and the animation more than made up for the failure of the musical numbers. It's appropriate for all ages, and although younger children will probably enjoy it more, there is humor in it that adults will appreciate. This DVD actually also includes a few special features (despite the fact the the listing says it does not). It includes a very short documentary about the designing of the movie, a few character drawing lessons from story artist Mark O'Hare, an interactive experience, and commentary from the director and co-director.",1354147200,,2543,4.680089485458613

And we use the Blu-Ray for family movie night. AND we have the digital copy on my iPod, tablet, and my son's iPod Touch. As you can see we get so much use out of it.

The movie is one of our favorites. Dr. Seuss laid amazing groundwork for this epic movie. The colors and detail are gorgeous. the music is super catchy and my kids actually learned something!

CONS:
I PREordered this movie almost a month in advance, so it would be here the day it was released without having to fight for it at the store. Unfortunately, it showed up almost four days late. When I tried to voice my concerns, I basically just got a ""Sorry that sucks,"" in return.

3990578,4,B0001KL60C,"Though some creative liberties were obviously taken in the screen adaptation of this tale (how else could you turn an illustrated children's book into a 90 minute film?), I think that what's important is that the spirit of Dr. Seuss' original vision is preserved. Some aspects are translated downright marvelously, such as the whimsical trees, the goofy fish, and the cuddly bear folk. They are brought to life in a weird, wonderful world that I imagine Dr. Seuss would be proud of. Though the aspect of colors and vividness cannot rival the splendor of ""Rio"" and ""Finding Nemo"" (the kings of color, when it comes to animated films, IMO), ""The Lorax"" nonetheless manages to be quite impressive at times (my favorite scene was the ""nontraditional"" white water rafting). It's definitely worth watching on Blu-ray, as opposed to DVD (as are almost all animated films), in order to get the most out of its color spectrum and attention to detail.

As for the story itself, ""The Lorax"" tells a serviceable tale that is held aloft by the superb voice acting of Ed Helms, who makes up for the less than pleasant contributions of Danny DeVito and Betty White (fine actors, but a rather annoying, cliche-riddled duo for an animated picture). The larger message of environmental conservation has its heart in the right place, although its absurdity (focusing on the renewable resource of trees rather than the limited resource of oil) must be overlooked. But, hey- if you're watching a movie based on a story by Dr. Seuss, starring a mustachioed critter as odd looking as the Lorax, then you should already be prepared to suspend your disbelief!",1353715200,,1634,4.920289855072464

3990582,2,B0001KL60C,"Recently watched movie review:
*Dr Seuss's The Lorax (2012)- 2/5

Dr Seuss's The Lorax is a family friendly, animation film that's based on the book of the same name. Ted (voiced by Zac Efron) lives in a 'real' treeless town called 'Thneedville.' He has a major crush on Audrey (voiced by Taylor Swift) and will do anything for her attention and love. You see, the town of Thneedville has trees spread throughout the city, but the trees are all fake. Ted finds out that Audrey would get married on the spot if someone were to find a real tree. He asks his grandma (voiced by Betty White) where he can find one. She suggests that he find 'The Once-ler,"" as he might know where to find a real tree. Ted finds The Once-ler (voiced by Ed Helms), but is asked to listen to a story before finding out where one might be. The Once-ler tells a story of his past, and soon you'll find out why 'The Lorax' (voiced by Danny DeVito) pops out of a tree stump to protect his world.

From the same studio (Illumination Entertainment) that created Despicable Me (my favorite movie of 2010), I had hope that The Lorax would be at least a decent film. Unfortunately, I almost had to stop watching it as I was getting very disappointed with the quality of the film. I found that the movie focused too much on 'save the environment' and 'capitalism is bad' messages rather than making a good film. I found the writing to be a mixed bag as sometimes it was good, but then other times is was just plain goofy. I also wasn't a fan of any of the characters, and I have to blame the writing, especially the writing for character 'Ted.' I didn't like anything he had to say and that's a major problem as he's a main character.

While I didn't like any of the characters, I did however like the 'animals' instead, except The Lorax; the animals didn't speak, but rather their emotions shined. Just like Despicable Me, Illumination Entertainment knows how to create perfect emotions/animations for their background characters that don't involve people. The animals all look cute and adorable, and I found myself looking forward to seeing what the next animal emotion/animation would be. Illumination Entertainment did a great job with the minions in Despicable Me, and while the minions made the movie, at least that film was backed by awesome writing, and very likable characters.

The Lorax looks beautiful with vibrant colors throughout. The animals did a great job with the script, and there are a couple of catchy tunes. Unfortunately, everything else falls flat. Will most young audiences get the messages the film tries to shove down their throats? I'm going to say, no. Will most adults want to watch this more than once? Probably not. Chances are, you're going to watch this movie with your kids, but since there's better family friendly, animated films out there, I have to give Dr Seuss's The Lorax a recommended 'pass.'",1353628800,,2902,4.662109375
3990583,1,B0001KL60C,"I was really looking forward to this movie because I love the story, but this incarnation provided nothing but disappointment. The story was poorly written and badly told and the only reason the main character wanted to get trees back into the world was so he could score with the good looking girl that did actually have a moral center. The villain  of the story was really the only interesting character the movie had and realistically the writers should have had mercy on us and let this remain a half hour television show.",1353542400,5,526,4.655913978494624
3990584,4,B0001KL60C,This movie is very family oriented. It helps to teach children the value of protecting the environment. It is a very fun movie about a fictional town. This movie comes from the famous writer Dr. Seuss who has inspired millions of children.,1353542400,,239,4.714285714285714

3990586,5,B0001KL60C,I loved the movie the LORAX when I was a kid and this one is a great remake. The story teaches kids about being greedy and how it effects other people.,1353542400,,151,3.903225806451613
3990587,5,B0001KL60C,"This is a remake of the every popular Dr. Seuss story The Lorax.

The Lorax is a must watch for *everyone* for the environmental message contained within regarding over consumption and unnecessary waste caused by squandering resources which is devastating the environment (ie the carbon footprint.)  This rendition is a refreshing update to the previously returned animated feature.

I am so enthralled with The Lorax and feel the message is important enough for the next generation that I bought extra copies for each household of our grandchildren.",1353456000,,550,5.2988505747126435

3990590,5,B0001KL60C,Sent the movie to my daughter in college.  She had seen it in the theater and wanted her own copy.  Who doesn't love Dr. Seuss?  It was delivered on time for her birthday.  My only complaint was I spent the extra money to have it gift wrapped and she said it was wrapped in plain paper-not even gift wrapping paper.  I was very disapppointed and would not recommend anyone spend the $5.00.,1353369600,,389,4.347222222222222

3990592,3,B0001KL60C,"The plot and story line where pretty bad, it was completely different from what I expected. The storyline was actually kind slow moving. The visuals were great, but I wish I had waited to borrow this from library for free instead of playing $3.99.
I watch a lot of animation and cartoons and the story line and plot here was one of the worst I've seen. I liked some the characters in this movie, but I didn't like the way the plot was executed.",1353369600,,444,4.2976190476190474

3990605,5,B0001KL60C,My daughter is 4 (and 3/4 as she often reminds me) and she watched this movie several times during the rental period. I enjoyed the message of the movie that we need to take care of the earth for future generations. I will probably end up buying the movie.,1352764800,,256,4.244897959183674
3990606,5,B0001KL60C,This was the first movie we took our 4 year old to see in the theater and he loved it.

So what was the point of making it a 'seussical' when singer/songwriter Taylor Swift never sings? True, the original book did say 'No one can sing who has smog in his throat.' Yet we have a whole crowd song and Audrey (Swift) does not join in. Why? Is she trying to show that she can sing and act?

Everytime I watch it, it makes me pay more attention to not being so wasteful with resources and generating so much trash (i.e., I try not to let water run as I'm washing dishes, will wash and re-use plastic utensils, print documents double-sided, etc.) A good family movie that could, perhaps, teach children not to be so wasteful AND the danger/consequences of greed.

3990613,1,B0001KL60C,This movie was horrible. I felt minutes draining out of my life while I watched this. Dr Suess books are simple stories. When they make full length movies out of the books the true message is always lost in the political undertones the direcyor and producer try to shove down our throats.,1352419200,3,288,4.5576923076923075

3990623,1,B0001KL60C,"My opinion of The Lorax stayed in flux as I watched the movie unravel.  Sometimes I cringed at how heavy-handed they were with Dr. Seuss' simple message, sometimes I was just dismayed by the overabundance of nasty characters they invented and imposed upon his story.  Too many times I wondered where Dr. Seuss was in this messy adaptation of his book.  He seemed to be missing.  The reason for this became clear in the bonus feature.  Apparently, the filmmakers felt it necessary to attach things not Seuss to the story because it was somehow deficient as it was; requiring their extensions.  One of them even had the gall to call it a homage.  But tampering is tampering; clearly they were dissatisfied with most things in the book, especially the notion of having to adapt Seuss' two-dimensional drawings into......two-dimensional drawings in motion.  A lot of work was required to ""make them come alive.""  Again, a slur against Dr. Seuss' work.  If they didn't like the book, why bring it to the screen?  Why add dopey songs that were less than memorable and subvert the plot?  Why ignore the language, what makes Seuss' work so distinctive?  There was a reason Dr. Seuss kept his book somber from page one to the end.  His point was concise, not easily forgotten.  But they had to turn everything into a carnival atmosphere complete with slapstick, a romance, a city, and another villain that wasn't even required.  When you overhaul someone else's work to this degree you're not honoring their work, you're desecrating it.",1352073600,44,1527,4.8604651162790695

3990629,3,B0001KL60C,"Yeah I get the message.  Nature is good.  People are bad.  Ecology is pure. Business is corrupt.  In some senses, the film captures the essence of the Suess story but in other ways the Hollywood spin takes it over the top. Still, There are a couple of catchy songs and a decent cast of voice characterizations ---EXCEPT for Danny Devito as The Lorax! Baaaaaad idea.  But, hey it's fun and my kids like it.  At least they are getting a lesson in how self destructive greed can be and how important responsible use of natural resources is.  Better than most of the morally bankrupt schlock being served up to our kids today.",1351987200,,622,4.5

My children loved it, my wife and I loved it, it kept us entertained from the start all the way to the ending, well even after the ending cause it has 3 mini movies to watch, and the kids just couldn't stop talking about it and actually took it and watched it again for bed. The 3D did seem to darken the movie a bit, but it didn't take anything away from the movie. The kids were actually getting up off the couch to try to catch the stuff coming out of the screen.

It completely exceeded my expectations, my 3 year old son and 5 year old daughter were glued to the tv from start to finish.  The 3D animation had them reaching out towards the tv during several scenes in an attempt to grab realistic objects being projected towards them.

3990658,3,B0001KL60C,"The original story is so famous that I don't think I have to recap it. The computer animated film adaptation of a Dr. Seuss book is exactly what you expect from a Hollywood studio, for better or worse. It is a story of adventure and romance set in a colorful world of animation. Characters are likable (except one). There are pleasant and lively (but forgettable) musical numbers. And of course, the Lorax, an orange-colored creature with a long, bushy moustache.

This is a fun, family-oriented film with a message, which is conveyed in a very straightforward way. This was a bit surprising to me as ""The Lorax"" is made by Illumination Entertainment, a company best known for ""Despicable Me."" Those who remember Gru and his army of minions may miss the dark humor that would have been perfect for the Dr. Seuss adaptation.

While nuance and ambiguity are integral part of language, visuals play a major role in film. It is understandable that in translating the original book's text to screen, something must go. What arrives instead is a good-natured and idealistic hero Ted Wiggins, his love interest Audrey, and a ""villain"" Aloysius O'Hare, mayor of Thneedville, who has made an enormous fortune by selling fresh air to the residents. Their action-filled story almost overshadows that of Once-ler and The Lorax.

As entertainment ""The Lorax"" is pretty good, but sometimes it looks as if, instead of complementing each other, two stories are competing for attention within one film.",1350604800,,1485,4.979838709677419

3990670,2,B0001KL60C,"I was very disappointed. Of course, being a PG movie implies that it is for kids, but usually they attempt universal appeal. Bottom line, it wasn't funny and the story was very dry. The animation was beautiful and the voice acting was pretty good, but nothing else materialized that was of any value. The first half hour is promising and foretells an intriguing story, but nothing really happens. The humor was obviously meant for five year-olds, as it was 90% slap-stick ""guy runs into pole/gets hit with a fish."" I went into the movie knowing that it would be preachy, but this was overkill. This movie just was not good. A child may enjoy it, seeing as story isn't one of their focal points, but I can't foresee this as a movie any adult would watch a second time. It wasn't an awful movie as the film itself is absolutely breath-taking, but the story is a huge let down. The three bonus mini-movies were all under five-minutes, which isn't really an issue. They focus more on the animals which is the film's best part, but they weren't funny either. It just seems like a missed opportunity. Everything looks so great and the characters are pretty interesting, but the story is too minimal and too boring.",1350086400,,1208,4.623255813953488

This movie may have been written for children; however it tackles some very adult issues. It tackles the issue of deforestation. It tackles the issue of rampant consumerism. And it also tackles the issue of unregulated capitalism.

This movie doesn't merely entertain. It also educates and has a social message.

About the film...The Lorax is a film on the environment. That could sound boring but, let me tell you, it is not. It's sort of in the form of a parable and doesn't shove the environmental theme up your nose but, instead, in a perfectly delightful way it raises our awareness (and the awareness of our children) about wanton waste of the things of the earth.
Great film with a great message. I highly recommend it.",1348704000,,546,4.362745098039215

3990749,5,B0001KL60C,"I have to admit that when ""The Lorax"" came out in theaters only one of my eyebrows went up in limited interest, and we never got around to seeing it in the theater...I thought, I'll catch up to it when it comes out on disc.  Last night my wife, 13 yr old daughter, and I caught ""The Lorax"" on DVD.

As the movie started I sat back and my immediate thought was that this is just Dr. Seuss-ian eye candy for little kids - a Hollywoodized version of Dr. Seuss' book of the same name.  And to be completely frank, I didn't quite know how the producers were going to make a full length feature out of ""The Lorax"".

There are plenty of cute animals, an idealized vision of nature...and that put me off a bit at first.  As the story developed it soon became clear that the people of Thneedville were living in a dystopian society driven and monitored by a corporate entity...sort of a Big Brother is watching scenario where the Big Brother scenario exists solely to protect corporate interests and short-term profits, mainly for the people (in this case, person) at the top.  There were messages of elimination of personal privacy, misleading the general population for the corporate good, etc.

I also enjoyed the character development and threaded story lines.

The background story is told by ""The Once-ler"" in flashback mode, and sets the stage for the significance of the movie.  It's a tale of a good person being blinded by personal ambition and  greed, followed by over-harvesting to produce a luxury item for which an artificial need was generated by popular demand, followed by over production at the expense of environmental health, and then economic of the company when resources become depleted, and ecological crash of the environment needed to provide even basic services, like photosynthesis, for us and all living things.

I was thoroughly unamused when the head of Thneedville's main corporation responds to scientific information - the suggestion that trees produce clean air by photosythesis - with obvious disdain and blind outright dismissal as something made up, a hoax? (Sound familiar to anything happening today?).

OK, here's the bottom line.  If you are a promoter/supported of completely unregulated free-enterprise-at-all-costs-capitalism you will hate this movie.  If, however, you are concerned about the state of the environment and the way we are managing/mismanaging it, and realize the need for a change then this movie will not only strike a chord with you, it will hit you as being highly significant and you will recommend it highly to everyone you can get to watch it.

In summary, this movie is actually a thesis on the current state of business, economy, and the environment in the United States.  Watch it if you dare.

A good family movie which can become the springboard for some discussions about ecology and selfishness.

No comparison to my blu-ray version, although it is still watchable.

The animation was good and the story line ok - it was somewhat based on the book after all. However, I personally did not care for the cheesy style of comedy in comparison to other Dr. Seus movies (e.g. Horton Hears a Who - silly but not cheesy). It just wasn't funny to me.  Maybe kids will ""get it"", but I didn't.

My last critique focuses on the casting. No offense to Danny DeVito - he is a great actor and comedian and I enjoy his characters in other shows and films - but I never, in all my years of reading the Lorax, imagined Danny DeVito's voice as the Lorax.  It just sounds wrong.  I struggled with this the entire film.

Overall, the movie was OK. Not great.  It had a lot to live up to and no doubt fell short. I defnitely won't be purchasing this one, but it was entertaining enough as a one-time rental.",1348272000,,998,4.221052631578948

I was extremely excited when I saw it would be made into a full length film, and couldn't wait to see it.  I would have watched it in the theatre, but I couldn't swing the funds at that time, and when I could I had other things I needed to do.

So when it came available to rent online, i did it.  I was pretty disappointed.  Not so much for the story, or anything that was great, and that is why it got two stars.  The songs ruined the whole movie.  It would be one thing to have intelligent, humourous lyrics to add to the film.  That would have been ok.  However, the songs were inane, idiotic and did not add anything to the film.  In fact they were very irritating, and as I stated before ruined the whole thing.

3990840,3,B0001KL60C,"This was 45 minutes of story and concept at most.  The rest of the movie was filled with cute little things you've come to expect in animated movies.  The problem was, they felt forced.  I liked the movie, and I liked the voice acting.  The way the movie filled out just didn't work for me.  The musical numbers seemed like they happened because it was ""time for a song"" and there needs to be a soundtrack to sell.  Two examples that I think worked came to mind when this movie was over: 1) Cloudy With A Chance Of Meatballs probably had less of a story to work with, but the movie was filled out in a more coherent way. 2) The Little Mermaid had musical numbers that brought you into the story and advanced it.  The songs didn't pop out like unrelated music videos in the middle of the movie.  Those comparisons may mean nothing to you - and probably even LESS to your children! - but I make them to explain my 3-star rating.  ""It's OK""",1347235200,4,937,4.248587570621469

3990854,3,B0001KL60C,"In animation, in plot, and in rhyme and song, 'The Lorax,' movie has somewhat elaborated from the Dr. Seuss' book.  Sometimes it's a pay off, but at other times it is a letdown.  In pace, they are snappy enough, but in song and in dialogue, they don't add much quality to the overall movie experience.  There are some pretty dull lines and some lame lyrics when you listen carefully to both the words and songs.  Still, the characterization (including voices from the likes of Zac Efron and Betty White) are endearing, and the vibrant, flowing visuals make this 'Lorax' good enough for at least viewing once.",1347062400,,608,4.7075471698113205

As avid Amazon Instant Video users, ""The Lorax"" is playing on at least one AIV-enabled device (Kindle, Roku, iPad, Xbox, Vizio TV) at any time during the day.

I would definitely recommend making ""The Lorax"" part of your video library as a go to movie when you need a distraction.",1347062400,,541,4.59375

3990860,3,B0001KL60C,"As a kid, The Lorax was one of my favorite Dr. Seuss stories.  Not only did I enjoy the storytelling, but I also had a lot of fun watching the animated version based on the book.  One thing to remember about the animated Dr. Seuss of the 70s is that they were very faithful representations of the book.  They used the same art as the book and the script was very often an exact reading of the book text.

I recently watched the 2012 updated version with my kids.  Even from the preview I could tell that the movie makers were taking some definite liberties with the story.  I didn't expect any major departures from the story, but it was clear that they would be adding considerable content into the ""gaps"" of the story.  NOTE: I'm going to be going over some of the additions to the story.  I assume that you're already familiar with the original book, so I don't claim any ""spoilers"" for that story, but if you want to be surprised, just skip to the end here for my overall opinion without risking spoiling any plot points for you.

The movie gives a full storyline and family to the boy who goes to visit the Once-ler.  In the book, the boy is present on the periphery and is given a challenge at the end of the book but in the movie the boy becomes a central character named Ted.  Ted lives in ""Thneed-Ville"" named after the Thneeds invented by the Once-ler years ago.  Thneed-ville is a sort of plastic-mechanical city where all needs and recreation are provided by artificial man-made means and on the whole there is no real concept of ""nature"" or ""natural"" elements.  In fact, the current Mayor of Thneed-Ville makes his living by selling containers of clean air to the citizens.

Ted has a crush on a girl in the town and learns that she has a dream to see a real living tree (rather than the plastic and metal imitations around town).  Ted learns about the Once-ler and decides to go outside of town to visit him.  Outside of town is a deserted wasteland still suffering the consequences of the Once-ler's industrial ravaging of the area.  He works his way through some strange booby traps to get to chat with the Once-ler.  Rather than having the Once-ler tell his entire story in one sitting (as seems to be the case in the book), Ted has to come back a few different times and each time, he has different obstacles in his way.

As for the Once-ler's story, it also had some new elements added.  We get to know his family more in depth and they are quite the set of characters.  We spend quite a while with the Once-ler before he becomes a mega greedy corporate millionaire.  We actually see the Once-ler and the Lorax build up quite the relationship, which is interesting.

During the Once-ler's story, we also get to know the Lorax in a more personal way than in the book.  This is a lot of fun, but I felt like it came a little at the expense of some of the aspects of the Lorax's personality from the book.  I felt like Danny DeVito did a great job voicing the Lorax.  But I missed some of his quirky rhyming couplets and behavior.  I also missed some of the songs and music from the previous movie.  There were songs in this one but they were rather different in scope and tone.

One very interesting addition is that this movie continues on AFTER the story from the book ends.  We get to see what happens after the Once-ler gives Ted the challenge of ""Unless.""  The ending sequence of the movie includes vehicle chases, confrontations with big baddies and overcoming high odds in search of a higher goal.  Where the book left the action in the hands of the reader (or viewer), this movie explicitly drives home the resolution that should be taken.

Overall, I still really enjoyed the story of the Lorax and had fun with this movie.  I didn't see it in 3D but it was very evident which scenes were specifically built to try and take advantage of the 3D ins and outs.  There were a number of things I nostalgically missed from the book and 1970s movie, but generally this was true to the nature of the story.  I had fun with some of the additions to the story though I could have done without a lot of them.  The kids really enjoyed the movie.  I'm not sure if they've seen the old one recently enough to remember it and I'm not sure the last time I'd read the book with them (or that they read it on their own).  I'll have to encourage them to do so.

Generally, this was a fun movie.  If you're a fan of the Lorax, you should enjoy it.  If you're a fan of kids movies, you should have fun as well...there's good animation and solid kid humor.  If you're a die-hard purist when it comes to Dr. Seuss, you may be a little disappointed at the changes made.

I loved hearing about the mysterious Onceler with the green gloves who talked through a ""snergely hose"", and the brave Lorax who speaks for the trees. To see some of the back story was so much fun, and to actually see who the Onceler was and how he ended up all alone with his buildings falling apart was fun...and sad. I think the story is even sadder when you know more about the Onceler, and see him making friends with the brown barbaloots and the swammee swans, and then cold-heartedly ruining their world because of his greed.

When we saw this movie in the theater, we walked out and saw overflowing trash cans with popcorn and soda cups all over the floor. That really brought the point of the story home for me. On the way home, my daughter and I talked about how we could avoid making more trash, and what we can do to clean up the earth (recycling, composting, reusing). We are all Oncelers, and we can all make the choice to make the world better...or not.

3990886,5,B0001KL60C,"Yes, It's a Dr. Suess story, but it has a profound statement to sent to all.  In this story the main figure sets off to make his fortune.  He creates a unique item that is hard to market.  On his final day of finally giving up hope, luck would have it that his creation is desirable.  So desirable that he has to go into mass production.  Even while his forest friends beg him to stop, he ignores them and continues to use and consume all the trees in sight to create his fortune.  Eventually, he has to shut down his operation as he has used up all the raw materials (trees).  It is years later that a young boy, in striving for the attention of a girl, uncovers this mystery as he searches for a real tree.  His modern world has everything that once was natural or organic manufactured with new features and lights and fanciful things made out of metals or plastics.

It sends a good message in a fun and ""cartoony"" way to all that we need to use only what we need, protect our resources, not be blinded by money and look to the things that really matter: family and friends - not material things.

From a back-handed slight to believers in God, to demonizing all corporations and thematically denouncing entrepreneurs and profits. Such as the idea that the president of a corporation is intentionally polluting the air so his company can make a profit by selling people clean bottled air. Finally the city walls are destroyed presumably so that the ""healing"" can begin. I always liked the story of The Lorax.  This just felt like a propaganda film by some Earth-First organization.

The Lorax is about consumerism and the need for conservation. Achieving a good balance is essential for the survival of all beings on our planet. The short, orange Lorax speaks for the trees.

THE LORAX is pretty enjoyable.  The contrasting color schemes are visually imressive and the voice characterizations, especially Danny DeVito and Ed Helms, are quite good.  The shamefully ubiquitous Betty White is just another Betty White shtick.
Most of the music is forgettable, but John Powell's instrumental score fits nicely.
The film's heavy ecological message is tempered by comic moments, especially by the forest animals.  The movie is the spawn of DESPICABLE ME creators but it's nowhere as much fun as the Minion-populated classic.

On the other hand Dr. Seuss' own prejudices (he was an extreme pro-abortionist) made him absolutely horrified to learn that pro-lifers were drawing the obvious conclusion from the moral of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Horton-Hears-A-Who/dp/0394800788/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Horton Hears A Who!</a>: ""A person's a person, no matter how small,"" by applying it to unborn children, and despite the avalanche of demands to cease and desist with lawsuits to follow, Dr. Seuss went to his grave knowing that despite his best (or worst) intentions, he had written the unofficial but extremely effective motto of the pro-life movement.  Dr. Seuss' worst book by far is&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Butter-Battle-Book/dp/0394865804/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Butter Battle Book</a>, but in fairness to him, writing it was an act of sheer desperation.  He probably knew he was dying, and in 1984 his beloved Soviet Union (Dr. Seuss was a Communist sympathizer before being a Communist sympathizer was cool.) was also dying at the hands of President Ronald Reagan who unlike most ""experts"" of all political persuasions believed the Cold War was winnable.  In the end Dr. Seuss failed, Ronald Reagan succeeded, and a lot of kids were forced to read a truly subpar book because their teachers liked its politics.

This brings us to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Lorax/dp/0394823370/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Lorax</a>, arguably Dr. Seuss' second worst book, not because the message hammered home with a sledgehammer in it was particularly evil, but rather because it was so unnecessary.  Stripped of its dramatics and anti-business bias, the primary message of The Lorax was don't only chop down and never plant the trees you depend on for your business.  Well, DUH!  American logging companies were starting to figure this out in the NINETEENTH Century!  Certainly by the time The Lorax was written, there wasn't an American logging company that wasn't planting several trees for every tree they cut down.  The secondary message was don't carelessly and thoughtlessly pollute the air and the water, and while it took longer for this message to sink in, by 1971 it really had, and the air and water were rapidly being cleaned up.  I did then and I do now have a problem with a children's story that consciously and deliberately pressures small children to solve a problem that their parents have already solved.  What next?  Telling little kids that ""unless"" they care a whole awful lot, enough to do something about it, slavery will never be abolished?

Finally, instead of just doing a CG remake of the 1972 version:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Lorax/dp/B005QDU96Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Lorax</a>, the creators of this mess decided they could do a better job than Dr. Seuss; the result is something both left-wing and right-wing can take offence at.  Having junked, even made fun of most of Dr. Seuss' beautiful language, they replace it with a lot of questionable humor (the anti-Redneck humor really got old) and slapstick chase scenes.  They cranked up the the anti-business bias to an earsplitting screech, but at the same time sabotaged their own message in ways reviewers who preferred the original noted: having the Lorax speak for the trees AND for Mazda and iHop and Theatre AMC due to grating product placements, having the Lorax START OUT trying to kill the Once-ler by dumping him over a waterfall, and ridiculing bottled water purchasers.

The new version is formulaic. The artwork is actually pretty good, but the story and pacing are uninspired and uninteresting. There is also a very serious, realistic tone to the new film (i.e. character mannerisms, music, etc) that ruin it. The old version had an almost ""magical"" look and feel to it.",1345334400,2,526,4.717391304347826

However, if you have kids, there is plenty of entertainment value for them in it...my wife and I ourselves just couldn't get into it as much as say movies like Up, Finding Nemo, etc.  If you're a person that likes animated movies, I'd still say give it a watch because it may yet be something you yourself would like, and if you have kids, they would probably like it.",1345248000,,648,4.295081967213115

We found the movie to have musical numbers and themes that were busy and unclear to the original story or message.  The movie was definitely, in our opinion, created to try and appeal to a different demographic than the original (older kids - perhaps early teens?)

I was amazed that the movie was able to break down real problems and the bureaucracy that goes along with it into a digestible form that could really speak to kids. It has a sense of balance that is created through humor, so it's not all doom and gloom. Let face it though, digging our heads in the sand and pretending that we aren't up against some real problems in our world and society is an injustice to ourselves and our kids. ""Oh that's hippie talk."" Man, how many times have I heard that ignorant phrase. Well I don't know about you, but I don't want to die off slowly from cancer because we neglect our responsibility to our community and world for the sake of corporate profits. I love how it exposes the psychology of commercials and gimmicks. If you want to plant a seed in your children's hearts and minds that we have a sense of responsibility to ourselves and the creatures we share it with to understand the simple phase, ""You reap, what you sow."" this movie you just might enjoy. If not, don't watch this movie or buy it. All 3 of my kids loved the movie.

3990933,5,B0001KL60C,"I honestly had no clue what The Lorax was before we watched the movie.  I knew it had something to do with trees and since it was a Dr. Seuss tale I knew it would be a good story.  The movie blew me and my family away.  The animation is truly amazing and we have watched this DVD more than I'd like to admit in the two weeks that we've had it!  You can see the everything so clearly and I can't imagine how the animators even captured all those details.  The voices made my husband and I laugh as they are from popular actors/actresses including Taylor Swift, Zac Efron, Danny Devito and Betty White.

The story is actually quite moving too and was perfect for me to introduce some lessons to my children.  ""The Lorax"" is a tale of a young man, the Once-ler, who goes off on his in search for the perfect material to make his Thneed (a crazy sweater.)  He meets the Lorax when he cuts down a tree and the Lorax explains how he speaks for the trees and takes care of the animals.  The story goes on of course as he cuts down more trees until there is none left.  As a side story there is a town in the future where there are no trees but one girl (Taylor Swift) wants one.  They actually sell bottled air since the air and pollution is so bad!

So anyways a young boy (Zac Efron) goes on a mission and hears the story from the Once-ler.  Can he grow a tree and save the town?

The story is great to teach kids about caring about the environment, recycling, and how one person can make a difference!

This is a must-see movie in my book, even if you don't have kids!  Truly amazing animation, hilarious songs and dancing and a great overall story.",1344643200,2,1645,4.158227848101266

3990941,1,B0001KL60C,"It might be okay as a stand alone film, but the problem is that it is called ""The Lorax."" Based on the book by Dr. Seuss, but only very loosely. It takes audacious liberties, even for a film adaptation, and crunches the actual content of the book into maybe 3 minutes of screen time in a 90 minute romp. Ridiculously anti-corporate, despite the fact that other Lorax adaptations have admitted that while they can be self interested, they are rarely flat-out, one dimensional evil entities. Ironic, also, considering all the corporate tie-ins. The Lorax apparently no longer speaks for the trees, but Mazda and iHop and Theatre AMC. Some people might like it and think it's harmless, and they are perfectly entitled to that opinion. I wouldn't have such a beef with it except that it is called the Lorax, when it should really be called ""Extra money so I can finish Despicable Me 2 on time."" Actually, that may be a little harsh. This movie was clearly made by someone who loved the book or the 1972 adaption, but who missed a crucial message in there somewhere and made a Captain Planet movie instead. It is a watered-down kids movie with bright colors, cooing animals, celebrity voices, evil 1984-style corporations, and not much impact.

3990947,4,B0001KL60C,"I have very fond memories of seeing the original, 2 dimensional animation rendering of Dr. Seuss' fairly controversial short story ""The Lorax"". It was faithful to the original story to a fault, simply quoting the book verbatim throughout its duration, pouring out a message of consumerism gone awry and short-sighted, fly-by-night economics that is often denounced by both Austian Free Market proponents and Environmentally minded socialists alike. In short, it paints a picture about as grim as what was the reality for many communities in America during the Industrial Revolution, but it comes up short in pointing out the government complicity in aiding the crony corporatists in violating the natural rights of the less industrial property holders of said time period. It's more of a simplistic, man vs. nature poem that leaves much more up to the imagination.

This re-make, which is quite a production, fills in a lot of the blanks that were glaringly present in Dr. Seuss' original, almost to the point of becoming out and out fan fiction in the process. Where before the story consists primarily in a singular storytelling session by the former industrialist dubbed The Once-ler with a young listener, here an entire town of plastic, corporatist consumerism gone haywire sets the stage for the tale of the Lorax, removing some of the intended holes in the story for the purpose of making it more dramatic, but also bringing out the more sympathetic aspects of The Once-ler (who also gets his own biography of sorts weaved in with the story of how he ruined a once pristine forest) and presenting a more odious villain who takes on The Once-ler's place as a short-sighted profiteer; charging money for the clean air of the town and subjecting the entire town to a sort of 1984 styled surveillance police state in order to keep trees from being planted to cut into his bottom line.

The voice cast of this film is where the movie scores a lot of its points, as the vocal talent of Betty White as the protagonist's eccentric grandmother is sure to bring a smile to the faces of all viewers, young and old. Danny Devito's handiwork as The Lorax is also quite a treat and ads to the light-hearted nature of the pastoral reminiscence of The Oncer-ler. And the vocal talent of Taylor Swift (admittedly a one-trick pony in the pop/rock/country songwriting department) is brought into play to do for this film what Tiffany did for the full length movie ""The Jetsons"" about 22 years prior. The musical numbers are about as bubble-gum oriented as High School Musical, but definitely play up the comedy factor quite well and provide good segway material to keep the film flowing. Special note should also be made of how well the animators of this film were able to capture the desolate, broken world where the now ruined forest once stood.

But the ultimate charm of this film is that, unlike the original story, a more detailed depiction of how The Once-ler and the absolute absurdity of consumer fancies is presented in a manner that is not necessarily anti-progress. One can't help but note how the environmental catastrophe that resulted from short-term binge harvesting could have been avoided with a gradual harvesting approach rather than just slashing and polluting the entire capitol source. Likewise, the whim-based nature of the Thneed product and how it caught on is reminiscent of how many fads begin, are milked relentlessly, and then discarded like the evening trash for someone else to clean up.

This is among the better computer animated flicks I've seen in a few years, and it's a good all around fun fest with a reasonably nuanced message that is common sense for anyone who desires a quality world rather than a quantity based world of ephemeral highs and hangovers.

3990949,5,B0001KL60C,"As a serious fan of Theodore Geisel since 1968, I feel confident in saying he would ultimately love this film. Not for how it treats his source material but for how true it is to his world view. For all its flaws, this Lorax says more about what really matters today than any ""toon"" since Wall-E, and goes even further down our modren rabbit hole.

Keep in mind that The Lorax was really radical in its time: a children's environmentalist book? It was not universally loved, to say the least. Stick to the cute cat in that cute hat was the consensus from the suits, because the Lorax was getting mighty close to the kinds of truths Those In Charge would rather us not discuss among adults, let alone the kiddos.

But that's the secret genius of the best kids' toons and books and movies and tv---they treats kids like their best selves, wise human beings who see things we adults can't begin to because we're so lost in our little ego-driven dramas. Some kids are smart enough to know how lame our society is becoming, and this movie is for them, just as the book was. And for the many many kids who know something's not right with how the grown-ups live, but can't quite elucidate it. Enter the Lorax.

As a huge fan of the book, I don't like DeVito as the Lorax. Too predictable and too twee; oh how I'd love to have heard Willem Dafoe instead. Or so many others with more gravitas and less wacky cute in their voice. But oh well. On the other hand Ed Helms is excellent (apart from his rather excruciating singing), and shows why he's heading towards epic star status in his own quiet goofy way. He gets this material and sells it perfectly. As it were...

Selling EVERYTHING is what this book is about, and the movie takes that to the next level. Seuss was a visionary and saw the future we now live in, and this flick goes there and farther, into deeper realms of consumer and corporate greed. It baldly and hilariously/painfully exposes our daily selfishness as a society, so focused on our own marketing-driven ""needs"" that we're blind to the real costs that will inevitably bankrupt us, economically and morally, and are in fact making us go broke right now.

Let's face the facts, it's only because things are so bad in this country now that this movie could even get made by a major studio. O'Hare Air is a brilliant metaphor for our economy, completely short-sighted greed for profit overriding all common sense. And common decency, which we seem to daily forget, decency towards our planet, the creatures we share it with, and ourselves. This movie really brings that home. And its endless attendant ironies are very entertaining on the meta-ugly level: the garish colors and standard characters and typically meh tunes. But some of the lyrics are cut from another cloth entirely, and it's those moments that make this ""kids' film"" so uniquely subversive. It looks all Diznee until you really pay attention...

No doubt the characters could look better: less cutesy, new face-types instead of the soooo predictable rounded snub-nosed cutie-pie faces in all pixar etc stuff now. But then again, that archetypal look helps disguise the truly harsh message this movie and book is sending: WE ARE KILLING OURSELVES AND OUR HOME...MERELY FOR MONEY.

Becasue this new Lorax gives undying devotion to that one simple, ugly truth, I forgive this flick all its cliches and flaws, because we desperately need this kind of truth, and fast, from all of our movies and art these days.

The message here is WAKE UP, WORLD, this plan ain't working.

And that they got this film made, and shipped out in shiny new 3-D thneed containers, is somehow both so perfect and so pathetic that the irony is priceless.

Or, 19.99 for a good-looking blu-ray with plenty of entertaining extras to ponder as we whittle  and fiddle away the brief time until we chop our last truffula tree...maybe to print The Lorax?

And you know that Ted Geisel, America's best doctor, would laugh heartily, and sadly.",1344384000,,3985,4.677142857142857

I preordered this movie set a while ago, with the expected delivery date by August 7 (as advertised).  The movie discs arrived today (August 7) as promised.  Thank you, Amazon, for keeping your word.

  I was pleasantly surprised that the packaging was a standard bubble-lined envelope, instead of a medium/large box like the days of old.  Less packaging, less materials to have to send out for recycling (in the true spirit of the movie's ""save the planet"" theme).

  I purchased the set that included blue-ray + DVD + digital copy + Ultraviolet access.  As soon as I received the text message that it was delivered, I came home to watch the movie again with my daughter.  She was eagerly anticipating the arrival of this movie, so suffice it to say that her hum drum summer day was instantly made by the opening of this package.

  The blu-ray movie clearly shows the intricacy of the animation.  My daughter watches the DVD on her portable DVD player.  The digital copy is accessible to my HTPC (home theater PC) so that we can watch the movie from almost anywhere at home.  In addition, the ultraviolet copy allows you to keep a copy in the cloud, and to stream from any computer, iPad/tablet, iPhone, and more.  So we're good to go.

  There are three new mini-movies included in the combo disc pack (""Wagon-ho,"" ""Forces of Nature,"" and ""Serenade"").  These are available on both the blu-ray and DVD.  Also included are:
-The Making of the Mini-Movies
-Deleted Scenes
-Seuss to Scene
-Once-ler's Wagon
-Games
-Sing-Along
... and other things we haven't tried.

  I initially thought the the DVD has the feature film + a few bonus features, and that no mini-movies are included on the DVD disc.  It turns out that the DVD in this combo pack also includes the mini-movies, as well as the other bonus features (the making of the ""mini-movies"" and other bonus features that are also included in the blu-ray disc).  It is possible that the 1-disc version (DVD only) only contains the feature film + bonus features, with no mini-movies included.  I did not get the 1-disc (DVD only) version, so I cannot attest to this.

  The movie itself has been reviewed by many others here, so I will include a movie review with a later update.  For now, I will keep this review on the packaging and discs.

  Yes, the movie follows the theme from the Dr. Seuss book, plus more.  Drop in the bucket... save the world one tree at a time... don't waste precious resources... any situation can be made into a song and dance number.  Take your pick.  I don't really care much for the songs, none of which I could remember even after watching the movie in the theaters.  Or maybe it's just me.

It is an interesting take on the story, but I was slightly disappointed with many of the book interpretation.  Oh well.

3990961,3,B0001KL60C,"""Dr. Seuss"" The Lorax""  is the animated adaptation of a 1971 children's book that underscored the importance of preserving and valuing nature.  Young Ted (voiced by Zac Efron) lives in the prefabricated town of Thneedville, where the landscape is composed of plastic houses and inflatable hedges and trees, and fresh air is sold in water cooler-sized bottles. Things have come about this way because years ago, the reclusive Once-ler (Ed Helms) cut down all the real trees in order to obtain the soft tufts of the truffala trees necessary in the manufacture of his invention, an all-purpose garment.

The character of The Lorax (Danny De Vito) is an orange-maned, yellow-mustached, mystical character who acts as a spokesperson and conscience for nature. Directors Chris Renaud and Kyle Balda present this cautionary but insubstantial tale in an explosion of color.  The screenplay, expanded from the book, seems padded even though it clocks in at a modest hour and a half.  A few forgettable songs are tossed in more as filler than to move the story forward.

The by-now familiar computer-generated animation gives the characters a rubbery, weightless look.  The artistry here falls far short of the superior Disney Pixar features, which boast stronger scripts.  The two-disc Blu-ray/DVD Combo Pack contains several mini-movies, audio commentary, deleted scenes, three kids' games, a sing-along, and ""Seuss to Screen,"" a brief look at how ""The Lorax"" was adapted for the screen.

It is my opinion of a movie based on one of my favorite childhood books. I appreciate all the comments, and I've given each one the consideration it deserves.

Read your kids the book instead.

Other than the Lorax and the Once-ler appearing in both, there isn't much the movie has in common with the book. If you're looking for another movie that demonizes business and makes business owners out to be liars and only out to make a buck, this movie is for you. If you were expecting a wonderful tale based on Dr. Suess' book, you may want to wait for the remake (I'm sure there will be one in the next two years).

While the animation does a good job of presenting the story, it misses out on all the wonderful little details that a Dr. Suess book is known for. (The movie ""Horton Hears a Who"" does a pretty good job.) This movie is over ninety minutes long, but despite that the characters never get a chance to develop. Other than comic relief or the obligatory love theme, most characters are there to push the anti-business agenda that runs throughout the entire movie. Everything is superficial, and the movie tries too hard to push that anti-business agenda instead of telling a wonderful story of the consequences of not taking care of the planet. A total miss.

3990964,3,B0001KL60C,"There's a lot going for this Lorax movie. The effects beautifully mimic Dr. Suess' artwork. The voice acting really captures the Lorax. The changes to the plot generally fit the spirit of the original story - with a major exception I'll discuss later. In all, there's a lot going for the Lorax and casual viewers should enjoy it.

However, for fans of Dr. Suess' original book, the end result comes across as overly Hollywoodized. The movie imposes a meta-narrative on the original plot in which we learn more about the boy who seeks the Onceler's advice. Much of the meta-narrative works, although I think it does trivialize the environmental message. The boy now goes to seek the Onceler's advice because a girl he has a crush on wants to know more about trees. Even worse, the film has a typical happy ending, which again trivializes the book's environmentalist theme. The book's ambiguous ending leaves the reader concerned about the fate of the environment, whereas the movie allows viewers to forget about the trees once they leave the theater.

With so much going for this movie, it's a shame Hollywood chose the easy way out. This movie could have worked really well if it had ended the same way as in the book.

There is extra material added to the book, which is more or less necessary to make this into a full-length movie. I thought the added content kept the spirit of the book and made for a more interesting movie.

Where this movie shines is in conveying the messages of the book. Dr. Seuss's book is not subtle. This movie is not subtle either. I was a little shocked at how heavy-handed it was, particularly in the song ""How Bad Could it Be."" I'm sure it will offend people. But by being in your face, this movie is keeping the spirit of the book.

I'm glad for this movie. It does gets the message out even more effectively to kids than the book, in my opinion.

Are all corporations evil and greedy? Of course not. But whether they are conscious of it or not, their actions often have very adverse effects. People like to ignore this and tell themselves it's not that bad. How bad could it be?

One of the easiest ways to make a lot of money is to convert life and health into money. Think about it. Have you ever heard of any companies selling products that were harmful or unhealthy? How about dumping toxic manufacturing byproducts into the land, water and air that we all depend on? How about mistreating employees or demanding too much ""life"" from them? If you have worked very long in corporate America some of these things will likely ring a bell.

The answer to the movie's song ""How Bad Could it Be"" is that it could be very bad. We really are making our planet uninhabitable in the long run. We have to change how we do things.

I enjoyed the hopeful, upbeat ending to this movie. I hope the reality of our future is as upbeat. Trends are not promising, I'm sorry to say.",1337385600,11,1908,4.342696629213483

Or are the majority of professional reviewers correct in their belief that the subject matter is not expansive enough for a full-length feature?

  Ted (voiced by Zac Efron) is a twelve year-old boy in the perfectly plastic metropolis of Thneedville. Everything in Thneedville is artificial and air itself is only available to those who pay for it. Ted (Efron), more than anything, wants to impress Audrey. Audrey (voiced by Taylor Swift) wants to see a real tree, but all the ones in Thneedville are electric and powered by batteries. Some even come equipped with a disco function utilizing music and mirrored balls. Ted asks his family where he might find a tree and his grandmother (voiced by Betty White) says that if he wants to know about trees he'll have to venture outside of town and ask the Once-ler. The Once-ler (voiced by Ed Helms) is a hermit who never leaves his house and refuses to even speak to visitors until his very specific, very peculiar demands are met. Once they are, he begins to recount the epic tale of his arrival in the forest and eventual introduction to its protector and advocate The Lorax (voiced by Danny DeVito).

  In such politically-charged times, there'll no doubt be critics who decry this film as preachy or anti-business. Perhaps if I held beliefs similar to said critics, I might agree. As I don't hold such beliefs, what I saw was highly entertaining and even hilarious.

The Lorax I thought was really good [for a kids' movie] heck, even for adults, I found it entertaining - moreso than any of the others.

It has some really great songs; I especially liked the one about greed, how he just kept making money and making money, no matter what the consequences to anything or anyone.  I personally can't see how anyone can truly believe that teaching children that the most valuable thing in this world *might not* be money is a bad thing.

And ~GASP~ how dare we teach children to care about our planet and our environment?!? Seriously?  There has been so much harsh criticism of this movie, and now that I've seen it, I just don't think all that negativity is warranted.
Don't worry, this is not a hard-core indoctrination brain-washing session, it's a fun, hopeful movie that stays very true to the *SPIRIT* of Dr. Suess and his book.  I thought the added story line was very cute and appropriate.  To all of the people who think it ""deviated too much from the book,"" - can you tell me how a good full-length movie could be made from a children's book that is 20 pages long and only has one story line?  (As all good children's books do not typically have sub-plots and secondary story lines.)

My kids said, as we were leaving the theater, ""this is our favorite movie this year.""  And as far as kids movies go, I agree.

Now here is some family fun with a great message! Some people may think it's preachy and others may think there is some ulterior motive being subliminally sent out to children...but what's wrong with a positive message that promotes life and not death.

This film was surprisingly entertaining, funny and a bit of action adventure swing to it as well.  Rated PG for the cartoon violence that may be interpreted with the somewhat mature theme of `saving the environment' - specifically trees - the movie tells the tale of town that is entirely plastic in nature...so plastic that they have to sell `air', because the environment is so bad.

Giving reverence to everything Dr. Suess - with lots of embellishments, director's Chris Renaud (Despicable Me) and Kyle Balda (director of many animated shorts) the film creatively and colorful explains the world that was created because nature was destroyed. Tree upon tree chopped down for the onset of Plastic and all the bi-products that come from it. Poisons, toxins and bad air - all in one place called Sneedville.

It has light-hearted music, witty comedy and even a few wonderful songs you might find yourself humming along with. Headed in the cast is Danny DeVito (Taxi, War of the Roses, batman Returns) himself as The Lorax. The keeper of the trees. He befriends and entrepreneur voiced by Ed Helms (The Office and The Hangover) who is convinced money over nature is far more important. Hence, the destruction of the environment.

Zach Efron (High School Musical, 17 again, Charlie St. Cloud) and Taylor Swift (Valentine's day) learn what the truth was and is and with the help of Grandma - ever so cleverly played by Betty White (The Golden Girls, The Proposal) herself, they learn the truth of how important Trees are.

Fun, funny and really a family film it might make you think next time you pick up a water bottle....this film has a lot of heart and a lot of funny action. It was a big box office draw when it opened and people are still coming back. Enjoy!",1332720000,4,2048,4.735955056179775
