Doesn't mater the age everyone will like it. there is so many layers you should read book to understand all",1356048000,,130,4.24
7955990,3,B00005UW7A,"I do so enjoy the adaption of this story but the anime was increadably condenced from the manga. It seems half of what it could have been though they did pretty well for only having 26 episodes. Chou Kei, Roushi, Nentou, Ou Tenkun.. Just some of the great characters who made the manga great have been axed. I would say this dvd in particular shows as a good introduction to the series and lets you get a small taste of the real story.",1062979200,2,435,4.253012048192771
7955991,5,B00005UW7A,"Funny, exciting. I wanted to wait, figuring they'd do a complete set, but I just couldn't wait to see what happened next.  Raishinshi & Youzen join Taikoubou & Kou Hiko gets a taste of Dakki's evil in spades as the demon takes out his family & the Empress. This is a very funny series, yet it manages to keep one interested in the next show with abrupt cliff-hanger endings. Youzen & his doggie are almost as cool as Shinkohyo & his kitty & both are of the exceptionally calm types of which all anime seems to have one or two of. Raishinshi can be brash & annoying.",1027814400,3,565,4.280373831775701
