The DVD is packed with tons of episodes,a lot from Season 2 (2003) put in,and some of Season 1's (2001). My only tiny complain was it didn't include some other episodes from Season 1,but this DVD is excellent! A worthy buy for sure!",1077840000,2,400,4.346666666666667
1957649,5,B0000WN0V4,"We loved to watch this show when it was on TV. But that was the problem, off then on and now off again. So, when the DVD became available there was no hesitation. The humorous stories, great graphics and wonderful characters have won over our grandchildren and ourselves. This DVD is well worth the purchase and it provides over 5 hours of enjoyment. Can't wait for more of the same.",1076544000,2,383,4.485714285714286

1957655,4,B0000WN0V4,"My oldest got a copy of this a few years ago as a gift.  He had so much excitement when he watched it until it broke.  Now we have another copy and he has the same joy all over again.  Although it might not have an educational merit,there's a little something for everyone to enjoy. It does introduce a concepts that your friends can be different.  In fact the very thing you are afraid of, can be good. In one episode, the officer duck is harassing the alligator just for an award. There's cheating during a race to win and even breaking down stigma in almost every episode, that will open the doors for discussion about these situations to friends and children alike.  That was the second most rewarding thing about purchasing this DVD.  The animation is great and the characters are fun.  Watch it and experience it for yourself.  Not only was it great for my kids, but I do reference this for groups and to adults to open the space up for dialog around certain concepts.",1423440000,,974,4.432584269662922

1957661,5,B0000WN0V4,"Must have if you have kids. A bunch of short cartoons about 15 min each. Really fun characters and adventures. nothing like the typical stuff on TV. No bad language. And friendship between a duck and an alligatorwell, that's a lesson in itself -- overcome your fears, get out there and make some friends.",1385078400,2,304,4.648148148148148

1957666,5,B0000WN0V4,"I dearly loved this series when it was on Cartoon network and then on Hub late at night. Ducktown and Swampwood were the places to be. Bill, a duck and a gator named Aldo become unlikely friends after an attempt by Aldo to eat Bill results in a toothache and a realization that Bill is more than just a lunch when Bill risks himself to help the gator in need. After that, it is hijinks all the way as both slowly adjust to one another over time, dealing with everything from crazy friends to dealing with other gators who still raid Ducktown in search of someone to eat. I got this compilation and while I love it, it only leaves me wanting more.",1366588800,,646,4.260162601626016

1957668,5,B0000WN0V4,"I bought this DVD for my 2 year old...that was 4 months ago and she's still in love with the ducks and the alligators (even though she doesn't understand much now). She's laughing, she's always captivated by the characters, and learned new words this way. I watched the DVD with her over and over for more than 100 times over the past months, and we still like it (nice, clean jokes, every once in a while, for parents or older children). This is the ONLY DVD that makes her stay still for more than 30 minutes. Elmo doesn't even come close at grasping her attention for this long. I would recommend ""Sitting ducks"" for anyone, but especially for those parents who would like to enjoy a few quiet moments while their kids are absorbed by the characters in this DVD.",1352592000,,765,4.4714285714285715
1957669,5,B0000WN0V4,"My grandchildren and I used to watch it every time it aired on TV! We were very sad when it was canceled! I still watch for it on different children's channels but to date, no such luck. We're hopeful that it will air again soon. It's a great cartoon for all ages! Love all the character's! Would love to see it on TV again!",1346630400,,324,4.078125
1957670,3,B0000WN0V4,"I bought this for my young grandchildren.  After watching a couple of episodes, I feel this would frighten them.  It had some comical parts, but I will have to watch futher to get the full affect of the show.  This show does not look well on my hd tv.  It shows in analog format to me.  It was a little blurry and dark.  I suppose after watching it futher, I may see some difference in the quality of this show on dvd.  I am glad I only paid $5.00 for this show.

From the positive reviews by most, I am not seeing how this could be appropriate for all ages concerning children.",1342742400,,578,4.098214285714286
1957671,5,B0000WN0V4,My son loves these stories.  Too bad the show was only on tv for one season. Lucky you can get all episodes on this one disk.  Its two sided which is great so it stays off of the floor.  Great messages through out and appropriate for the 7 and up crowd.  I like it too.,1333065600,,269,3.8363636363636364

1957675,5,B0000WN0V4,"I love anything from Sitting Ducks - wish there was more posters, postcards, flyers - the graphics are hilarious.",1283212800,,113,5.0
1957676,5,B0000WN0V4,"""Sitting Ducks"" is an enjoyable little show.  My children are 4.5 and six years of age right now and find ""Sitting Ducks"" to be quite amusing.  The plots are simple, funny, and easy to understand.  Another plus is that the show doesn't contain all that adult humor--which typically isn't even funny--so prevalent in today's cartoons and doesn't have every character saying ""dumb"" or ""stupid.""  (Granted, in the very first episode, one of the ducks refers to a TV show as ""dumb,"" but that's the only instance I heard in any of the season 1 episodes.)  If your kids are tired of ""Backyardigans,"" then they might like this for a change.

Also recommended are the ""Peep and the Big Wide World"" shows, which also represent wholesome family entertainment.",1252368000,,749,4.858267716535433
1957677,4,B0000WN0V4,The world of children is full of wonder. It dosn't matter that I would rather watch a disney flick. She see's the world in differnt eyes and she loved this DVD. Watch it with your kids and learn somrthing.,1234569600,,205,4.282051282051282

1957680,5,B0000WN0V4,"In a satellite/cable TV universe where originality is a sure-fire formula for obscurity, ""Sitting Ducks"" was one of the brightest spots on the Cartoon Network schedule. Now banished indefinitely, it comes home in a double-sided DVD that delivers over 5 hours of animated hilarity.

""Sitting Ducks"" strikes just the right balance between cuteness for the children and sophistication for grown-ups. The friendship between Bill, an amiable self-assured duck who lives in Ducktown and Aldo, a towering 'gator from neighboring Swampwood is at the heart of the series. And what heart!

Bill and Aldo's friendship begins in an unlikely manner (without divulging too much, one was hoping to eat the other) but grows into a partnership that offers no end of comic possibilities. Aldo, we find out over time, is not just another mindless green duck-eating machine but often displays wisdom, ingenuity and even morality.

The series' setting of Ducktown is populated with an assortment of other feathered folks who are as quirky as Bill and Aldo's friendship, including Dr. Cecil, a general practitioner and aspiring dentist in a burg where not a single citizen has a tooth! To him, Aldo is a godsend, a king-size chance to ply his long unused dental craft.

The cuteness of the series is pierced from time to time by the dangers of alligators and ducks living at each other's doorsteps. Though a truce exists between Swampwood and Ducktown, 'gators regularly plot to make a meal out of Ducktown's citizens. In an episode poking fun at reality TV, a duck cameraman is eaten (off-camera) by alligators. In another, Aldo is trying to curb his appetite for duck by wearing duck hormone patches prescribed by Dr. Cecil. The patches give him a hankering for duck fare. When he chomps a fly right out of the air, the insect's dying cry reverberates all the way to the next spoken line. There are also a few instances of potty humor but that's probably what sold the show to Cartoon Network.

The DVD begins with previews for movies and other home video programs from Universal but if you put your player (set top or software) into fast-forward, the disc resumes normal playback speed at the end of the previews without any intervention. The previews are only on side 1.

""Sitting Ducks"" may have gone dark on cable and satellite TV but it shines brighter than ever on DVD.",1082592000,17,2355,4.889724310776942
