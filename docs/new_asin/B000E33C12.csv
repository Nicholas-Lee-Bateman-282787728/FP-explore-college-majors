They don't make them like this anymore more's the pity!
If you want a v/good war story then this is it.
Highly recommended.",1251417600,,150,4.592592592592593
2485031,5,B000E33C12,"Not just used for the Carlsberg beer advert (which is actually a scene directly from the movie!!! Fancy that!!) this movie captures everything you want in a Brit War flick -- Brit soldiers who know about trucks, nurses, double agents and Rommel-type German soldiers, death, love and stirring music that makes you feel very patriotic.  Ice Cold in Alex is a quintessential psychological thriller part action/drama, part chickflick with timeless social issues addressed (namely alcoholism and espionage)all rolled into a Good vs Bad with a twist adventure.

Without giving away the plot the setting is the 1942 Libyan war zone.  Sir John Mills is a British ambulance officer who together with his sergeant major driver and nurse (the love interest - Sylvia Sims) escape the German's seige of Tobruk and drive across the hot Western Desert in an ambulance.  In a race against time and the elements of the desert the objective is to get to the safety of Alexandria to meet up with the allies and,in true British fashion, have an ""ice cold"" beer at this little bar!!!  The gang get waylaid by Germans who tradeoff a South African officer (Anthony Quayle) for the trip (could he be a spy?)  After getting into a couple of scrapes and tight spots along the way all ends well for the group, or does it . . . well, you'll just have to watch the ending for yourselves.

Ice Cold in Alex is a brilliant WWII movie - a classic and my own all time fav - definitely a movie worth having in your collection.

NOTE:  Check out Amazon.co.uk. You can get this movie for about 4 quid but it'll be in PAL format not NTSC -- Hey, so watch it on your computer!!! It's worth it!",1149638400,15,1655,4.583050847457627
2485032,3,B000E33C12,"This film is about a small group of people who try to get back to Alexandria after being cut off by german desert troop advances in world war II. It features a group of very different people thrown together through accidents of war. They are two nurses, a drunken commander and his side-kick. Later on a south african engineer joins thems and helps them out of some serious trouble a number of times. However is the south african all he says to be?

Sylvia Syms is the surviving nurse and looks fabulous even though she's in a desert with little water.

It appears there are a number of scenes that were single takes. One classic is when they are trying to push an ambulance up a sand dune. Sylvia slips and the drunk helps her up and attempts to help her back to the ambulance. However they get their timing wrong and the guy accidently slams her head into the rear door of the ambulance! Sylvia recoils and briefly holds her head but then remembers that this is a single take and gets back to pushing.

It is obvious that she really did have her head pounded into the door and she wasn't acting!

The film has nice depth to it with a good twist and resolution at the end. A good example of an english war film.",1142208000,8,1212,4.302631578947368

Harry Andrews are well suited to there roles,this really is a must see classic war movie with a very believable cast,well scripted & superbly directed by J Lee Thompson who went on to fire ""The Guns Of Navarone""",1473811200,,492,4.8
8104637,5,B000E33C12,"Well, I finally discovered this 1958 great classic and I LOVED it! After reading so many good feedback, I was wondering if it will be as good as expected - but I had no reasons to worry. IT IS THAT GOOD! Below, more of my impressions, with some limited SPOILERS.

IMPORTANT PRECISION: this is a Region 2 Europe PAL DVD - it will NOT work on standard US/Canada Region 1 NTSC equipment.

Battle of Gazala, 1942. A British ambulance leaves Tobruk just before Afrika Korps cuts the city off. Five people are on board: Captain Anson (John Mills), a seriously shaken in battle officer from transport pool, his tough as nails chief NCO, mechanist sergeant major Tom Pugh (Harry Andrews), nurses Diana Murdoch (Sylvia Syms) and Denise Norton (Diane Clare) and an Afrikaner South African officer, Captain van der Poel (Anthony Quayle), who got separated from his unit and catches the ride with them to go to Alexandria. As Axis troops progress quickly, they have soon to leave the main road and cut through the most hostile regions of desert. This is how the film begins and the rest is the struggle of those five ill assorted people against the deadly dangeorus wilderness - and their own demons...

The film begins slowly and in fact during the first ten minutes I was actually wondering what everybody saw in this film, but then it started catching momentum and I finally understood that everybody was right. It is a great film and a great story, with tragedy included but ultimately very uplifting.

The scenario is strong. The ending, always the most vulnerable point, is VERY good. There is a lot of tension and drama. Characters are well shown, with their strengths and vulnerabilities. The one point slightly less good was the romance element - I somehow found it a little bit artificial, but it ultimately is not all so important to the plot. Finally, it is worth mentioning, that as in case of quite a lot of very good war films, in this one there is virtually no fighting...

Actors were perfectly used. John Mills plays very well a tired, damaged man. Harry Andrews is excellent as the undestructible NCO. Sylvia Syms is impossibly cute and sexy - so is Diane Clare, who added to it the element of vulnerability. As for Anthony Quayle, well, he gives here his usual perfect performance - and it is also in this film that I finally realised how physically powerful this actor was!

I will keep this review short on purpose, to avoid giving away any clues about the twists and turns, which add a lot to this film and which I never saw coming. I like to watch war films and I saw many, many hundreds of them - and this one is amongst the best. I recommend it with all my heart. ENJOY!

Once you watched ""Ice cold in Alex"", if you are up for another terrible, heartbreaking trek through the desert roughly at the same moment, you should try ""A taxi for Tobruk"", a French 1960 film, with Lino Ventura, Charles Aznavour and Hardy Kruger. This is also a little jewel - albeit more brutal... Enjoy that one too - if you dare...",1442534400,,3022,4.574861367837339
8104638,5,B000E33C12,This was recommended by my North African battlefield cemetery guide Steve Hamilton.  I remember viewing it as a kid on tv.  I liked it then and really like it now.,1412380800,,163,4.4
8104639,5,B000E33C12,Both book and film are first class entertainment.  I recently sent the book to my sister in Spain and she refused to put it down till she had finished it.,1385683200,,154,4.133333333333334

8104641,5,B000E33C12,"One of the best Brit WW2 movies of the 1950's.  Not an action thriller but one which focuses on the human drama element interwoven with an interesting plot twist.  Stellar cast with extensive on-location footage shot in the Libyan desert.  Katy the Austin K2 ambulance gets marquee billing.

Although nearly 60 years old, this movie hasn't really dated and is powerful enough to bring you in and keep you engrossed from start to finish.

Follows the book quite closely which is huge plus in my opinion.

My DVD copy is of superb reproduction quality - absolutely crisp and probably better than was experienced at the time in a smoke-filled movie theater.

Funny Flaw Moment:  Spot the Series 2 Land-Rover in the final scene!

Awkward Moments:
John and Sylvia's love scene - in the book the love interest is between Nurse Diana and MSM Pugh: much better in my view.
Sylvia gets a hefty clonk to the head when John ""motivates"" her to help push Katy up the sand dune - watch for it!
Anthony's quaint attempt at a South African accent - but note how it gets better as the movie progresses.  Practice makes perfect I guess.

All in all an unreserved Big Yes.  You won't be disappointed.",1368144000,,1181,4.625
8104642,5,B000E33C12,"The pacing of this film is truly relaxing to experience, and so is the deep bond created among the characters that is ever more magnified within the desolation of the desert - all of this despite of (or perhaps because of) the ever lurking dangers of war time.  The ambulance Katy itself provides a truly cozy hearth about which the viewer enjoins in ever-developing bonds among the principal characters.  The joys of this film rests less on expected thrills in a `war' film and more on truly wonderfully yarned character developments, and friendships.",1363651200,,552,4.924731182795699
8104643,5,B000E33C12,"very well acted desert story,John Mills & Sylvia Syms playing excellent parts the story totally believable,as it should be being true",1357344000,,133,5.380952380952381
8104644,4,B000E33C12,"When the movie was first shown in Hong Kong in the late fifties,
it received very good review.
My father used to like this type of film and he took me to see it
in the cinema.
All I could remember was all these sand and the last vivid sequence
in a bar in Alexandria, Egypt.
I bought a PAL version of the dvd from Amazon. UK and watched
it recently.

It was an early film directed by Lee J. Thompson who later directed
""Guns of Navarone"" and many other Hollywood hits.
It was release in the US under the name of ""Desert Attack"", such a
dreadful name.

Watching it now, the film doesn't age a bit.
It remains a very well-made WWII movie from a novel with John Mills
played a troubled officer, Harry Andrew as his dependable fellow soldier,
lovely Sylvia Syms as a nurse who came along for the ride
and Anthony Quayle as a mysterious South African the group met in the desert.

The film is obviously made with a low budget but the sequence with the group
trying to drag the truck over the sand dune recalls Werner Herzog's
efforts in dragging the boat over the hill in ""Fitzcarraldo"".

The final scene with the group's downing the ice cold Carlsberg in the bar in Alex
after their arduous track in the desert still holds up and finishing off
with a satisfying ending afterwards.
Almost a flawless film, if you count there's no frost on the beer glasses.",1292889600,,1351,4.349206349206349
8104645,4,B000E33C12,"Ice Cold in Alex is a reference to a cold beer at the journeys end through the hostile desert of North Africa, Alex being Alexandria. The beer is actually a Carlsberg, interesting since the movie is British. The film is a journey style story where a group of unlikely people join together in a perilious journey and come to rely on each other even when one is suspected to be an enemy spy.

What sets it apart and allows it to age well is the strong preformances of all the lead actors and presence of the Desert itself to the point where going to get a cold beer as a viewer seems to be a good idea.

Some of it has been done better at a later date, like the desert scenes in Lawerence of Arabia and the English Patient. But here the closer and smaller group add a sense of humanity that the other epic movies lose in scale and therefore the film ages well.

So if you are the type that appreciates this type of old b/w movies then this one is for you. If you are not, well give it a miss but you are missing out on one of the better such movies.

If you do watch it, keep a cold Carlsberg in the fridge. You will be wanting it :)",1284422400,,1131,4.013333333333334
