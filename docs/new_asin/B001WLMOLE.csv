3827114,4,B001WLMOLE,"Basically a ""stream of consciousness"" story pieced together with a ""slice of life"" story. With that you have been warned. Love it or hate it, this movie seems to illicit strong feelings from viewers. Watch and think for yourself. For me it was lukewarm due to to many personal conversations of this sort I have had in the past and yet hardly any in the present (being a grown up is so pretty borrowing, no one has new adventures or tales to tale of).

upadte Jan 12, 2010:
Ive started watching this movie again and find it even more engrossing than the first time. Now instead of being so concerned with ""what will happen?"" I am curious to ""why is this happening?"" and ""why are they saying what they are?"". 13 minutes into the film Andre divulges a theory on improvisational acting: who am I?  why am i here? where do i come? where am I going?; perhaps making this a major theme of theme of the movie, with few answers but plenty of discourse. Of course being in the French New Wave style this movie is not about what the characters do but rather what they are/were thinking as they do it.",1250035200,2,1089,4.359605911330049
3827115,5,B001WLMOLE,"Amazon may automatically link my review to the old DVD release of this movie, ""My Dinner with Andre,"" in which case, this may still be confusing.  Pay attention- I am referring in my remarks here to the new Criterion Collection DVD version, which has a photo of a knife and fork on a napkin, on a plate, on the cover.

When I checked, the first review which appeared on the Amazon page of this new criterion collection version is an old review from 10 years ago.  It trashes the DVD release and calls for a new version.  Well, it's this criterion collection version which, 10 years later, has arrived to correct the errors which the review talks about.  I'm referring to the review here that is titled ""But no stars for the DVD"".  So don't get confused-- this edition is new.

As for the movie itself, I'm taking the time to write these remarks because it's a great movie that is well worth watching and watching again.  By its very nature, as a two hour conversation, you can't absorb all of it the first time, so watch it's more worth buying than many movies.  In fact, it played a significant part in raising my interest to the post theatrical work of Jerzy Grotowski, who Andre discusses in the movie.",1249603200,65,1205,4.465753424657534
3827116,4,B001WLMOLE,"I hate to be a party pooper, as the new Criterion Collection edition is the best and only in-print DVD edition of this classic film available. The movie is presented widescreen 16:9, but the aspect ratio is 1.66 to 1, which means little black bars on the right and left side of the widescreen image. It's the way the film ought to be presented.

But... the original film appears to be incredibly grainy in the low-light restaurant shots -- i.e. 95% of the movie. Almost every shot is simply swimming with grain. I'm sure the Criterion edition faithfully reproduces this, but honestly I think a little digital processing to reduce the grain might have been more aesthetically pleasing. In some movies, perhaps film grain is part of the texture of the movie, and somehow adds to the artistic presentation. I can't see how this argument could be made for My Dinner With Andre.

The special features on disc two are excellent. Anybody who has watched the movie over a dozen times, as I have, must have grown to love the characters in the film. Those characters are based on Wallace Shawn and Andre Gregory, but only represent an aspect of their true selves. It is a joy to see each actor interviewed today for 30 minutes each, to hear them talk about their experiences in creating the film with Louis Malle, and how they look back on the film today. (Wallace said that he cannot stand to watch himself in the movie -- that Malle brought out things in him that he didn't know were there. Apparently that makes him uncomfortable.) The second feature on disc two is an hour-long documentary: Wallace Shawn interviews the director about his career and what he tried to achieve in his films. It is certainly an interesting character study, and perhaps reveals some of Malle's motivations in making several controversial films.

As for the main feature, perhaps others can describe it better than I can. Andre Gregory, in the interview on disc 2, describes it as like Lawrence of Arabia in scope. The viewers are taken to Tibet, to the desert, to Poland, to many varied and strange scenes and happenings, but they are taken there through the power of words, not images. Each person sees a different version of these scenes, through an act of creation in the mind, responding to Andre's wild tales as he relates them to Wallace.

It is also difficult to classify the discussion of society that occurs toward the end of the film. As the two men open up and express their fears and loves and annoyances, I find their worries about humanity, living in this dream world of comfort and endless distraction more relevant than when the film was first made. Perhaps it will become even more so in the future. For that reason alone, I think My Dinner With Andre's place as a cinema classic is secure.

At the very least, the thoughtful student of society and cinema needs to see this film once, maybe twice, to grasp what these two artists are trying to say. For myself, I will enjoy the performances and the message for many years in repeated viewings.",1248048000,6,3033,4.651119402985074
3827117,3,B001WLMOLE,"I'm only seeing this film now, amidst a sea of action-packed, drama laden adventure flicks.  A change of perspective is in order to watch such a quiet film that brings a change of pace to the screen.  While intriguing and thought-provoking, to be able to stay with the dinner discussion between Wally and Andree takes a heightened level of attention.  It also requires a certain suspension of daily mindset, as the ability to step out of the hubbub of fast-paced routine to reconnect and redefine ones' self is likely an even more foreign concept to the modern viewer than it was when the film was shot in 1981.  I enjoyed the film, but it does not rely on fancy effects, plot twists, or changes in scenery to move the plot.  You just plain have to be willing to stick with it, every word, and take the ride.",1247443200,,808,4.469387755102041
3827118,5,B001WLMOLE,"Normally, I should dislike a film like this.  I don't like talk fests, and honestly, from a cinematic standpoint, this film is quite boring.  But the screenplay, direction, acting, and conversation are so outstanding that this ultimately minor flaw is inconsequential.  The difference I think between modern talk fests and this film is that Andre Gregory and Wallace Shawn (who wrote the screenplay themselves) are so interesting, multi-faceted, complex, and engaging, as opposed to current talk fests, where the characters are so amazingly self absorbed and do not see (or refuse to see) the world around them.  Andre and Wallace are also real, breathing intellectal types, as opposed to being pseudo-intellectual and smarmy, like a lot of characters can be in current day talk fests.  Andre actually talks about this in the film, on how most of the time we don't see the world around us, that we are so myopic in our viewpoint, that we don't see the forest, only the tree.  A lot of the things they talk about are the BIG questions, the real questions, not whether C3PO from Star Wars was gay, or what the world's grossest poop joke is.  There is no explicit political material in the film.  If this film had injected the politics of the day (the film was shot in 1981, Reagan's first year as president), the film would be tremendously dated.  Luckily, Andre, Wallace, and the director Louis Malle make no specific mention of this.  They made the film universal, which is why it still resonates with us today.

I remember seeing this film when I was in high school, and being respectful, but honestly, not understanding a word of it. But now as the world and I get to know each other better, I see it in a completely different way, and it has become even more profound, beautifully simple, and really moving, both emotionally and intellectually. This is a tremendous film, one of Louis Malle's best, and worth the accolades that is has received over the years.  I'm grateful that Criterion is putting out this unique masterpiece again on DVD.",1244332800,4,2044,4.7920227920227925
3827119,5,B001WLMOLE,"This is a great movie for selected audiences who happen to be in the right mood for it. I will warn you that the rest of the review contains spoilers, but that shouldn't prevent you from enjoying the film since it really has no plot twists or turns.

99% of the movie takes place at a table in the New York restaurant where Wallace Shawn, a playwright, and Andre Gregory, a theatre manager, are having dinner and a near two hour conversation after a long time apart. The very beginning shows Wallace getting on the subway and coming to the restaurant and reveals that he has not been so successful in his recent pursuits, that recently he has found himself only caring about money due to this lack of success, and that this is a somewhat reluctant reunion he is attending.

The first part is Andre recounting his professional burn-out and his subsequent travels to Poland, the Sahara, England, and Tibet to look for meaning in his life. The next part is Wallace responding to all of this, and the final part consists of Andre and Wallace basically agreeing to disagree, all while dining at a fine restaurant.

Although Andre's tale is fascinating, it is very hard to relate to him. It was easier to relate to Wallace as he enters the restaurant somewhat downtrodden, listens patiently to Andre's adventures, and then seems to find his spark when he responds to Andre's tale by saying that it seemed to him that all of Andre's exploits were an effort to strip away the purpose from his life in an attempt to experience life as ""pure being"". Shawn clearly states that he sees no value in just existing, as he believes we are all defined by our purposes and pursuits. Even if he was home, with nothing to do, he says, he would pick up a book. The two continue to talk, but neither is basically moved from their original positions. The final scene is Wallace taking a taxi home, and mentioning that each street holds a memory for him, from his childhood to the present, and how this cheers him. He seems more upbeat for the encounter, although the voiceover still has him thinking about practical matters at the end.

I've seen this movie several times, and I always enjoy it. Perhaps I am a bit too much like Wallace, in that I always pick up on practical points of Andre's exploits that always seem to vex me. For one, this movie is set in 1981, and Poland had been firmly under Communist control for the last 35 years. What exactly were the Communist authorities doing while Andre, an American, had several dozen Polish citizens out in the woods carrying on a theatre workshop? I can't imagine they would have been too sympathetic. How did Andre even get into Poland? Likewise with Tibet, which is located inside Communist China. Remember, this is years before China became the more easily penetrable capitalist machine it is today. Why was it that the practical matter of making a living, and the costs of world travel while not working, didn't seem to impede Andre from traveling around the world, or even seem to enter his mind? What was his family doing all of this time that he was globe-trotting? The story of traveling to Poland is not the result of a geopolitically unaware screenplay, as Gregory actually did drop out of theatre for awhile in the late 70's and travel about the world, including to Poland.

However, it is still a fascinating movie, but you must concentrate because the movie is pure conversation, and if you get distracted at all you'll miss something. Not getting distracted is difficult, as the entire two hour conversation is food for thought. This surely isn't a film for everyone, but I certainly enjoyed it. It's a great contrast between two people from the same world - New York's world of theatre - who have two completely different outlooks on life. One seeks for meaning in grand adventures in exotic settings and thinks everything in his life should be repeatedly examined for continuing validity, the other is content with the simple pleasures of life and enjoys stability and continuity.

3827142,5,B001WLMOLE,"This movie could have been entitled ""In Defense of Meditation."" Although the word ""meditation"" is rarely used throughout the movie, Andre spends a great deal of time in the movie describing the types of behaviors that meditation helps you rid yourself of.

One of the first things you learn studying meditation is that the typical ""normal"" person spends between 65 percent to 70 percent of his or her thoughts arbitrarily judging and defending. This's what you do with about 65 to 70 percent of your life. That much of your time almost totally and completely pissed away needlessly defending and judging.

Some of the primary goals of meditation are to make sure the student is made aware of this horror and to try and whittle down the amount of time spent defending and judging to something more acceptable (in My Dinner with Andre, Andre refers to this as ""cutting out the noise""). You can figure out the gargantuan benefits of all of this on your own.

Meditation, which has also been referred to, by many of the uninitiated, as naval gazing, just might be the most practical, down-to-earth, intelligent, useful therapeutic method ever devised. And you don't have to have ""psychological problems"" to benefit from it. The problem is already there: Throwing away about 65 to 70 percent of your life on what Andre referred to as ""unease and rage.""

Have little doubt about it: A substantial amount of what Andre describes and discusses throughout this movie is very similar to what life is like before and after studying meditation. But I think it's a good idea that he avoids using the word as much as possible throughout the movie because of the ridiculous stigma attached to meditation. So instead he focuses in on the effects it has on its practitioners.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

On a another matter:

Irony of ironies: Early on in the film, Andre notes that, after spending several years traveling around the world searching for the meaning of life, he came to the realization that people, in general, have turned into zombies, walking around feeling nothing and reacting to nothing.

And then, later on in the film, Andre criticizes well-reviewed, well-thought-of contemporary playwrights and novelists and filmmakers for creating stories in which the world is presented truthfully, the real world as it is. They show a world full of shocking events with senseless violence and people trapped in meaningless, painful relationships; and Andre ponders what effect this portrayal has on it's audiences. Doesn't it merely show them a world in which they are already thoroughly familiar with? A mirror of what they are currently living that leaves them feeling depressed and hopeless and that there is nothing they can do about the situation?

And what would Andre's solution to this problem be? Create stories portraying people as zombies, walking around feeling nothing and reacting to nothing? And what kind of effect would THAT have on the audiences? Wouldn't it, likewise, leave them feeling depressed and hopeless? I strongly believe it would have such an effect. So what IS the solution?",1437350400,2,3152,5.140625

3827147,5,B001WLMOLE,"I would say this is one of my top 5 favorite films. In my humble opinion pure genius. Louis Malle's life was cut short. This film under rated. it is a highly intellectual film and not a popcorn and cola  blockbuster. This is not for everyone. It is slow, studied and you can watch it once every year or two. The message was and is brilliant. It is a discussion over dinner about life and what is life is made of. This comes with a charming rendition of the original script and be prepared for a slow but not boring intellectual journey.",1416700800,,536,4.254901960784314

3827169,4,B001WLMOLE,"At first glance it would seem that this story is more suited for the stage than for film. We have, after all, a story of two men having a hour and a half long conversation over dinner. Nothing else happens in the film - it's all dialogue. However, the choice to turn this project into a film is an inspired one.

Wallace Shawn and Andre Gregory (who play Wally and Andre respectively, but not necessarily playing themselves), over the course of the film, are basically grappling with the meaning of life. Wally is a humanist, he's (mostly) content in the modern world with all its amenities but Andre, his friend who he's actually been avoiding for years, is a dreamer, a new-age kind of guy - a hold over from the 1960's. Andre spends the first half of the film talking about his wild adventures in Tibet, the Sahara and Scotland. Andre has had visions in churches, lived in Poland with a group of people who can't speak English and was ""buried alive"" on Long Island during a Halloween performance. Andre, on the other hand, is more grounded. He has bills to pay, believes he's genuinely a good person and is feeling a little irritated that life hasn't turned out as well as he had hoped. He finds comfort in the things he chooses to do. He makes to-do lists and likes crossing things off that list. He enjoys reading a book about Charlton Heston and a cold cup of coffee in the morning (sans dead cockroach).

Why this works so well as a film is that what is happening on screen between these two characters is so at odds with what went into making this film (or any film for that matter). Films are calculated affairs requiring a lot of money, a lot of people, a lot of planning and a lot of hard work. Yet on screen there is magic. Through the cold efficiency of movie making with all its technology and processes, something of a transformation happens on screen. When Andre says that he once saw a Fawn (the mythical animal, not a baby deer) or a blue monster in a church with poppies growing out of its toenails, it makes an odd sort of sense and seems to be a metaphor for the process of creativity. Perhaps this is why the famed director Louis Malle demanded to be part of the production of this film. Only a true creative genius would be able to put all the scientific pieces in place (a camera, the lights, the audio equipment) and turn all of that into pure magic.

Yet if you were to ask Malle (or Wallace Shawn and Andre Gregory) at what point does cold-hard reality become something spiritual they would never be able to give you an answer. Nobody could. That's the magic of film and art as a whole.

At the end of the film (and this is not a spoiler), Wally is in a cab going home and is reminiscing about all the places outside the cab window that reminds him of his youth - an ice cream parlor, a place where his father bought a suit - but he separated from those events not only by time but also just by the glass window of the NY taxicab. There is a real and quite definable separation between the real world and the spiritual, but it's as transparent as a sheet of glass. To make sense of this, all Wally can do is go home and tell his girlfriend about his dinner with Andre and share with her a moment of togetherness - which is the only thing that the movie can agree on is real. How we decide to connect is another story.",1405209600,3,3344,4.303174603174603

3827174,5,B001WLMOLE,"I just finished watching My Dinner with Andre and my god was it one of the most beautiful, thought provoking films I have ever had the pleasure of perceiving. A film that is basically a two hour intellectual conversation between two men in a fancy New York City restaurant might sound like one of the most uppity and pretentious piles of dreck ever to be released in cinema, but strangely it's not, the conversation itself is at times profoundly moving and funny or sad, while at other times, especially towards the beginning, it is frightening, disturbing, and absolutely mindblowing while Andre describes his odd experiences with different groups of people during his travels over the preceding years. His experiences have a very spiritual, transcendental feel to them, and left me on the verge of tears at one point, unable to control my emotions just ""imagining"" what those experiences must have felt like for him, some of them were honestly more chilling than any horror film I've seen, and this is coming from a film that is about as far from a horror film as you can get. I'll admit, there were a few scenes where I kind of spaced out a bit because they really didn't interest me, like when Andre was talking about The Little Prince and the strange coincidence he had in some book, while others had me leaning forward with my eyes glued to the screen because of how much truth there was in the words and how much I could relate to to what they were talking about and how it made me feel inside. This film has alot of deep, interesting insights into the nature of life and how we as human beings have been ""programmed"" it seems to live our lives, living almost in a sort of ""dreamworld"" that is distant from true ""reality"" and because of this, we are not truly living, but more like zombies or robots. I am definitely going to watch this film again to get a better understanding of it, there's just so much depth and complexity, in what is essentially a very simply premise, but that's only on the surface, in ""reality"" My Dinner with Andre is so much more, it's about life, relationships, and how we perceive the world. This film gave me a higher awareness similar to another film I've seen called Waking Life. My Dinner with Andre is perhaps one of the most important films I've ever seen and I'm glad I watched it! This is the kind of film that NEEDS to be seen more than once, I know it might sound incredibly pretentious, but trust me it's not, any person who doesn't come away from this film with at least a slightly altered outlook on life cannot truly be living or aware in my view.",1367020800,3,2596,4.502118644067797

3827178,4,B001WLMOLE,"No, not the David Byrne music group, these are New York intellectual talking heads doing what comes naturally: talking, using Big Words and dropping esoteric names familiar to well-read college grads and artistes.
I first saw this flick in 1982 in an art theater (aka ""cinema house"") after it had got lots of press for its unlikely popularity (among the intelligentsia). Siskel and Ebert on PBS named it ""one of the best films of 1981."" Back then I could sit thru a 2-hour movie without getting drowzy. Not so true anymore.
Anyway, this is basically a filmed conversation over dinner in a fancy NYC restaurant between 2 old friends, both in the theater business, who discuss Life, the Universe and Everything. Lots of cerebral stuff: existentialism, philosophy, travelogue, joys and anxieties, career highs & lows, etc. Andre is the more talky one, obviously an extrovert and deep thinker with his head in the clouds. Wally plays Everyman, the one we're more likely to identify with, who has a more pragmatic view on life with his feet firmly on the ground. It's a nice contrast, sometimes with a bit of wry humor and self-reflection.
Unless one can listen and pay attention to pure dialog for 110 minutes, this movie will frustrate or simply bore you. No violence, car chases, special FX, CGI or steamy sex. So that leaves out 99% of the Millennials. The older generation is more likely to get something meaningful out of it. It's a restaurant where Food for Thought is on the menu.

3827179,2,B001WLMOLE,"I have been meaning to see this film for years ever since reading a review by Roger Ebert where he raved about it.  So when I saw it was going to be shown on cable, I tivo'd it and began watching it with fairly high expectations.

But my interest in the story (which remained high until the narrator arrived at the restaurant) evaporated when Andre began to talk...or more accurately babble about his wonderful experience in Poland with forty people who didn't speak a word of English and ""beehives"" and the like.  Frankly, I found Andre unbelievably annoying and felt like shouting ""get over yourself and go do something worthwhile with real people"" at the screen.  Andre came across as someone who was so privileged and spoiled, he didn't even realize that he lived inside a world that had little to do with that of 99.999 percent of the rest of humanity.  As such, I found him impossible to relate to and not someone I would have listened to if I met him in real life.

So I deleted it.  I have no problem with dialogue driven movies, but I need people in them who I can relate to and Andre did not fit the bill.  In contrast, I found Aaron Eckhardt and Helena Bonham Carter in ""Conversations with Other Women"" a LOT more interesting and sympathetic and ""real.""  So I'd recommend you watch that instead of this.

3827181,5,B001WLMOLE,"Two old friends who have lost touch over the years sit down at a nice restaurant and have a conversation over dinner.

Yep... That's pretty much it.

I just found out about this movie a few months ago, and was initially wary of how ""artsy"" and pretentious it sounded. But because it's held in such high esteem by so many critics, and because of the many affectionate parodies of the film in pop culture, I decided to rent it and see what the big deal was. I'm glad I did.

Watching ""My Dinner with Andre"" is essentially like being given the opportunity to eavesdrop on a conversation between two very interesting playwrites of very differing philosophies. Andre has been trotting the globe, having spiritual experiences and putting together odd, experimental productions. Wallace has simply been trying to pay the bills. Wallace initially dreads the dinner with the more eccentric Andre (who he has heard some strange rumors about), but he quickly finds himself engrossed in discussion and enraptured with Andre's anecdotes.

No, ""My Dinner with Andre"" won't exactly keep you at the edge of your seat, but it's a very good movie nonetheless. So the next time you're in the mood for a quiet, relaxed evening at home, dim the lights, pop some popcorn, open a beer, and have dinner with Andre and Wallace.

""My Dinner With Andre"" is at the top of that list, having become not just a cherished favorite, but a special touchstone for me, a reminder of what civilized life is supposed to be -- and it's all the more vital in these crass, anti-intellectual times!

Yet this isn't the congratulatory self-indulgence & snobbery that some critics make of it. This is simply intelligent, witty, sometimes searching & troubled conversation about the meaning of one's life, the roles & scripts that society writes for us, the effort to wake up from the all-encompassing & comforting illusions we so eagerly embrace without hesitation. Sooner or later we all start wondering about the choices we've made & lives we're living ... and whether that qualifies as living at all. Andre & Wally are discussing these very questions, and we're invited to listen.

Again, some find this boring. Not me! First of all, Andre is a superb raconteur, utterly urbane & at ease in the most bizarre of circumstances, and I find his stories compelling & vivid. Just as enjoyable is Wally's reaction to him, as a wealth of emotion plays over his face: he's curious, dubious, angry, puzzled, fascinated, repelled. And then Wally joins in the conversation, practically sputtering in his need to refute & challenge Andre.

From there the film really grabs the viewer. Every time I see it, I want to join in the conversation ... and every time, I've got something different to say. That's the delight of this film. It changes & goes in different directions with each viewing, because the viewer has changed & grown in that interval as well. And is there anything as haunting as both Andre's & Wally's last words?

Criterion has done a wonderful job, as might be expected. The follow-up interviews with Andre & Wally, done more than a quarter of a century after the film, are especially revealing. Andre is older, but the same amused, literate spirit is still there. And Wally has indeed woken up to a new world & life of political & cultural engagement. I sometimes wonder if they might do a second film, reflecting on those decades, or whether that would be a fatal mistake ...

But you don't have to wait for a second film for more conversation. ""My Dinner With Andre"" should make you want to talk with your own friends, talk in depth about the questions that matter most to you. Beyond all the shiny gadgets & status symbols & endless pursuit of what you're told to want, what IS your life? In the end, all we really have is ourselves. Why not make the most of that?

Most highly recommended!

Note: the published screenplay is equally recommended, as it contains more material -- sometimes a line or two, sometimes an entire page or two -- that was cut from the final version. More food for thought!",1303171200,10,2864,4.704590818363274

3827185,5,B001WLMOLE,"You would never think that a film about two men having dinner, shot in real time for basically two hours, would be even remotely engrossing and yet `My Dinner with Andre' was one of those films I couldn't turn away from.  The conversation, deep and intriguing, ranges in context and yet always falls back into the common thread of self-worth and a longing for something deeper, something to fill a void represented by contentment.

Playing themselves, playwrights Wallace Shawn and Andre Gregory meet at a restaurant, order their courses and then just talk...and talk and talk and talk.  While they talk, we (the audience) listen with keen interest as they agree and disagree over the way in which a life is lived.

Andre, the worldlier of the two, divulges experiences that range from bizarre to eerie, and all the while Wallace is taken aback by the audacity but also by the meaning behind it all.  As Andre talks we start to understand the line of thinking that birthed these `experiences', and both Wallace and Andre approach the idea of `life' from two differing spectrums, meeting in the middle to produce one of the most provocatively intellectual cinematic moments.  You never want their dinner to end, because you know that would mean you'd have to stop listening to them talk.

While the film is scripted (written by both Shawn and Gregory), you'd never guess it.  The conversation flows so effortlessly, you'd think the film were a home video, and considering that the stars recorded their personal conversations and adapted them into this script, it makes sense.

How much of this is true and how much is fictionalized is to be determined, but the entire film is laced with such sincerity that it all feels beautifully honest.  I talk a lot, but it was nice to sit back and feel part of a conversation without uttering a single word.  `My Dinner with Andre' is the type of film that is best savored multiple times, for each and every time you ingest these words you'll feel something new in the pit of your being.  This is one of those rare delicacies, one of those special films that comes along and blows your mind.

This is the type of film that changes people.",1302652800,6,2176,4.7097625329815305
3827186,5,B001WLMOLE,"The film (110 minutes) shows one long dinner conversation between two Manhattanites, a former theatre director Andr and a small-time actor and aspiring playwright Walley. The conversation takes place in some (clearly very expensive)  restaurant in Manhattan.

There's a short section of the movie before the dinner itself where we see Walley getting ready for the dinner, walking the streets of Manhattan up to the restaurant and talking to himself, giving the viewer some brief background of his life. He grew up in a rich family in the Upper East Side, but now he's barely able to pay his bills with whatever meager earnings he gets from his plays, as well as from his occasional acting. His girlfriend has to work as a waitress three nights a week to make ends meet.

Walley gets an invitation to this dinner with Andr through some friend, and it's clear that even though there's no direct benefit promised or implied, Walley has certain hopes that something good could materialize from their encounter, and he tries his best to be attentive and polite with Andr throughout the dinner.

Initially (for almost an hour) the conversation is virtually a monologue: Andr describes in much detail his experiences during the last 5 years, since he quite being a theatre director and spent time traveling all over the globe from Poland to India to Africa and back to Long Island.

In all those places he was trying to free himself from traditional ways of thinking and perception; in Poland he was participating and even leading various performances and happenings, meditating in the groups of strangers; in Sahara he tried to make a play based on Saint-Exupry's Little Prince (and at some point he says they were ""sitting on a dune and we just ate sand""), and finally in Long Island he had something akin to a revelation when he was mockingly buried alive during a Halloween celebration.

While Andr is telling all this, Walley demonstrates lots of attention, asking ""helpful"" questions to make Andr's monologue to appear more like a conversation. But at some point Walley's replies become more independent and he switches the conversation to his own life, implying that Andr's free life of travel and his quest for revelation experiences is not available to or attainable by an average man like himself.

The film was produced (and, most importantly, the script written) in 1981, which is 15 years before The Sokal affair (also known as Sokal's hoax). I think Sokal affair is much more appropriate context in which this film should be considered, rather than Waiting for Godot or any other work of theater of the absurd.

Both Sokal's ""Transgressing the Boundaries""  and ""My Dinner with Andre"" by Gregory and Shawn should be viewed as post-modern parodies.

Walley and Andr do a lot of name-dropping in their conversation: Schopenhauer and Heidegger, Stanislavsky and Bulgakov, Saint-Exupry, Debussy and Malraux (though in a negative way as in ""not Malraux""), are all duly mentioned. Andr does almost all name-dropping, but he also does most of the talking. Andr covers all bases, from New Age babble to SS/fascism/Holocaust references dropped easily here and there, up to pseudo-philosophical talk about people being actors/performers throughout their lives.

But Walley, when he's given a chance to talk, eventually also mentions Heidegger, bringing up philosophical aspects of death as being part of everyday experience when one experiences his own being to the fullest, thus showing to the film viewer that he's no dummy and can maintain a meaningful  intellectual conversation, even though initially he's talking about paying bills or using electric blankets, and tries to persuade  Andr that Mount Everest is no more ""real"" than New York.

Essentially, Walley and Andr are Woody Allen characters, from Annie Hall, Husbands & Wives - and - yes, Deconstructing Harry. The splendor & miseries of Manhattan inhabitants shown in their naked glory in a nice restaurant, where a waiter clearly considers himself to be above those being waited upon; the dinner conversation where meditation and revelation are discussed along with Holocaust and electric blankets while Amaretto is being ordered, while contemplating New York as a sort of a concentration camp - this is what My Dinner With Andr is about.

The film audience is surely also a target of this parody.

The movie is splendid. Script, cast, camerawork - everything definitely deserves 5 stars. We can also see here two distinct human types, and their relationships as they're in real life: one is assertive, the other one - self-effacing; and this is not a parody at all, this is very serious; certain aspects of this film are very realistic. The actors' performance and the director's masterful command of the visual narrative put this film in a category with the best movies ever produced.",1296864000,6,4846,5.061480552070264
3827187,4,B001WLMOLE,"My Dinner with Andre... wow what a cerebral piece of dialogue based celluloid this was. This one is sure to divide people; you'll either be fascinated by it or be bored to death. The entire movie consists of a conversation over dinner between two old friends. The topic of conversation revolves around various topics that are most of the time very brainy and thought provoking. If this sounds good to you, then you're probably the target audience (like myself), however if the thought of watching two middle aged men talk about life for two hours doesn't intrigue you... then you should know right now, this movie probably isn't for you. This movie is akin to spending some time with a wise well traveled worldly person... you know the type probably... the type of person you might meet by chance and engage in conversation; only to find that they are an endless pit of fascinating stories and fresh viewpoints.

I really enjoyed this film and everything that was discussed in it... really thought provoking and intriguing stuff. I will however say that at two hours, it takes patience... even though I really liked the film I'll admit there were times where the conversation dragged and I found myself checking to see how much time was left in the run time. Additionally as others have mentioned...the transfer/video quality is horrible. Still, this gets a big thumbs up and a recommendation though for fans of dialogue and more contemplative films, all others rent with caution. 3.75/5 stars.",1294272000,3,1494,4.881889763779528

3827189,5,B001WLMOLE,"Like most great works of art, there is not single message to the film. It's almost amusing how people want to both conflate art that they like with other things, yet also simultaneously reduce it to a bumper sticker. On certain levels the film is about art and theater, purposiveness and the ability to not get stuck in rote ways of living. After all, purpose is what makes life worth living- not love. Without it we would merely be extant beings, and that is no accomplishment, for even rocks exist, even if they do not have the ability to know it. Yet, there will always be those who simply lack the ability to get great art. No, this is not being used as a justification for bad art, but as a realization that there are simply people who are not intellectually capable of more than the simplest levels of entertainment. And to those sorts, there is only one response: screw you. Go revel in your ignorance and rationalizations. The film works on many levels, but not on the Lowest Common Denominator, and praise be to Malle for that. Is the conversation realistic? Yes and no. There is, save for a few bumps by Shawn, none of the umming and er-ing that punctuates real time conversation, and there is a sense of time compression in the conversation, but so what? Even the `plain speech' poetry of William Carlos Williams was a sham. If one regards his most famous poems (which were his best) one can see they are anything BUT plain speech. Yet, they effectively enough convey that illusion so that decades worth of so-called literary and poetry experts declaim something like that, which is demonstrably false. Similarly, Shawn's and Gregory's conversation is both real and `real.' One would be better off lamenting not that the conversation is too cerebral (for it isn't; nor is it stilted)- for the actual words spoken, but lamenting that so few people even care enough about the topics discussed, in any patois. What passes, these days, for in depth talk is bloggerese about Obama or Bush or the idiotic wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. The sad thing is that three decades ago, the two stars of the film hoped that their film would spur deeper and more meaningful discussions amongst an audience they, then, thought verged on deliteracy; while, looking back, one can see only how far discourse has plummeted since. This is actually a point Gregory laments in his Disk Two interview with Baumbach.
  Another point to make is that film critic Roger Ebert, upon the film's 1999 re-release, wrote, `Someone asked me the other day if I could name a movie that was entirely devoid of clich&eacute;s.' He then chose My Dinner With Andre. But many people, especially online, have mistaken what Ebert meant by that claim. Yes, both the Shawn and Gregory characters are, to a degree, clich&eacute;s and stereotypes of liberal New Yorkers (especially liberal Jewish New Yorkers whose very existence seems permeated with references to the Holocaust), and both of them utter a few banalities, here and there, but, as with the claims of preachiness and self-seriousness, this is merely a conflation. Malle uses two rather stereotypical (and sometimes fatuous) characters in their rather trite milieu as a jumping off point; as a way to show the audience that if these two old stereotypes can seek something more, why aren't you, the watcher of this film doing so? The seeming clich&eacute;s, as it were, are thus undermined, because they are utterances that go 180 against what they seem to be stating, for there is a dissonance between the character's statements and their resultant actions: witness Wally's cab ride home to end the film. The rather trite conversation he has had has undermines the banalities into action. That both men/characters are lacking, not fully formed, is a plus, because they are therefore relatable. Yet, they also undermine clich&eacute; in a very unique way. When one watches the film, both men actually look at each other, and often in the eye, when they speak. Even in most restaurants, most men assume the posture of looking off into the distance (as if sitting side by side at a sporting event) when they speak, to abstractly conduct their mind's-eyes. Not these two.

  And this is just one more reason, out of many, why this film is truly audacious, as well as great. It exemplifies all that is best about true art, as well as the primacy of The Word in art, above all other things for, literature is the only art form based upon a purely human construct. The Word is the most human thing we have in art- other animals can match our other sensory and physically based arts: mime, music, acting, mimicry, dance, visual arts, etc. But only literature is all human, and it is for this reason, the gift of the screenplay, that film is upraised beyond the rest of the visual arts. And My Dinner With Andre is the best and purest example of that gift. Forget what anyone says about this film; including me. Go watch it. Go see it. Listen to it. Experience it. You will be better for it.",1283299200,7,5006,4.736238532110092
3827190,5,B001WLMOLE,"This an extremely personal voyeurism experience, in that the conversation between Andre and Wally are is actually a manipulated cut-and-paste of transcripts of previous real conversations between the two, carefully selected to hit as close to your home as possible while fitting in under two hours. You may wonder what effect the frame situation and pre-dinner relationship of the two has on the views, you may feel over-powered by Andre's authentic confidence or charmed by it, and you may discount everything he says, and you may take Wally more or less seriously depending on the balance of your sympathy right now, but all these factors are what make the movie so much fun.

The film allows a stage where all the big ideas in philosophy that can't be discussed without definitions first-  often only definable by real experiences- can be introduce by Andre's remarkably captivating raconteur talent. Life, love, living, death, art, reality, appreciation, stagnation,  ambition. These things, though very, very subjective, are also just as innate and common in every human being so they can and must be discussed with that universal context that these characters lend it. The defining is done skillfully as Andre relates his stories to his audience, Wally, and from there they can go on to discuss these innate feelings without the game of semantics that muddle so many fine discussions about ridiculous, but still legitimate concepts. If ever as a philosopher you've grown frustrated and the limited repertoire of ideas under the umbrella of logic, here are those conversations you've been begging a some decent human being to understand and discuss with you.

I'll admit, some of what Andre's spouting are a little emotionally-based masculine dominated thinking (as most thoughts are, really), but there's till definitely enough substance to his hallucinations that I can personally  relate to them and decide what they mean to me. I don't understand and relate to all of his stories. Many of his thrill-seeking stories are of the type that need you to have already experienced similar emotional dramas with similar enthusiasm to understand- but I can still appreciate what I do understand and trust that as I age I will experience those emotions (maybe not on the same scale) but if I pay enough attention, I can experience an even deeper relationship with the film.

It's just as interesting to make the judgements about the characters. That's the beauty of the film; it makes no judgements on it's characters but leaves you as a single floating consciousness to make judgements, compare these men and their lives to yourself. In that way, this film is an excellent stabilizer and can help you center yourself. Whether you'd like to think it re-invigorates the life of the mind or settles you back into experience-based sentimentality tinged mindset, it does make you feel, it opens you up, doesn't shock you or blunt your senses like the senseless violence that wally and andre are disgusted with in modern theater and for that reason, it's art. And as in life sometimes, you get out what you put into it. That's why you may want to buy it and make it your good friend.",1275177600,,3177,4.9962192816635165

3827195,4,B001WLMOLE,"Unfortunately, I made that mistake when I first saw this film.  The movie consists almost entirely of a dinner conversation between Andre and Wallace, and I was lost the whole time and had no idea what was going on.  Luckily for me, I was able to rent it through Netflix and this time, I paid close attention to every subject matter during the conversation.  It starts out with Wallace meeting Andre for the first time in several years, followed by Andre telling a series of wacky stories.  Then comes a philosophical discussion about the life of playwrights, the separation of the audience from the story, how people separate their dreams and goals from reality, and how people tend to live like robots and not ask questions.  A lot of the subject matter discussed pertains to musicians and songwriters as well, and that is probably what drew me in, since I could easily relate to it.  Songwriters also have the greatest challenge of crossing that barrier between themselves and the audience, and it doesn't help anymore to simply reveal the horrors of society, such as murders, rapes, thefts, wars, corruption, etc.  And furthermore, what you see in people is not what they really are, since you might look at somebody and perceive them as highly successful and self-satisfied, when they're actually in pain and agony from certain issues in their lives.

In any case, this would be a good DVD to add to my collection, since I didn't quite get a chance to catch every important concept they discussed about.  It's one of those movies that need to be seen over and over again a few times to really get the big picture.",1255478400,6,1618,4.709219858156028

3827197,5,B001WLMOLE,"Experiencing fine food and dining is much more than just ingesting well-prepared cuisine.  A great meal without stimulating conversation is like watching a beautiful sunset by yourself.  For me, it's the shared experience that seasons the ambience into something exquisite and memorable.

Director Louis Malle's wonderful dinner conversation is among my favorite films.  It is so simple and original that it lures you in with a cool, almost subversive, agenda that traps you into lingering.  Have you ever been in one of those conversations that engages you beyond the time you had allotted but from which you are unable to extract yourself?  This film is that conversation.

Written by on-screen diners Wallace Shawn and Andre Gregory, the film is a slightly enhanced theatrical replication of an actual dinner they had.

Shawn on screen and in reality, is a slight, cherubic, lisping playwright of little success. Also in real life, he has chosen the unlikely profession of acting to supplement his non-existent income from writing plays.  Neither enterprise is financially rewarding but he is ""following his bliss"" as Joseph Campbell advises.

In a voice-over intro, Shawn ambles down a New York street expressing his apprehension about agreeing to have dinner at a classy restaurant with his long absent theatrical acquaintance friend, playwright and director Gregory.

Almost the entirety of the ensuing film is a rambling, stream of consciousness monologue from Gregory.  And what a monologue it is.

What's missing for me is the response from Shawn.  Especially in the latter part of the movie when Gregory makes startling philosophical, metaphysical and spiritual observations that are far removed from the reality in which we assume Shawn dwells.

The filming is ingenious in the way it is shot and editied.  What one might expect to be static and stilted is anything but.  Malle is a master of the rhythm of close-ups and reactions.  It's been said there's nothing more potent or meaningful in cinema than a close shot of a human face.  This film exploits that notion with an amorphous thread of a conversation around the idea of how wondrous life can be;  and that the power of words alone can create a sense of transcendence and wonder.

For me, this unexpected exercise in pure cinema uses faces and words to create a world that we willingly enter and reluctantly leave.  It lingers in the memory as something experienced.

Gregory's conversation is about ""waking up"" to life.  And Shawn's reactions are always from the mundane world of ordinary but equally wondrous reality.",1251072000,3,2588,5.121718377088306
