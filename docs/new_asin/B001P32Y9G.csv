3737549,4,B001P32Y9G,"1990. A Londoner imagines that living in the country is to be preferred to the congestion of the city, so he goes in search of a nice little corner of the kingdom that features a simple life, a community pub and some very nice neighbors. He finds several possibilities around the country, but you will be surprised at his eventual choice of the perfect spot. This is all very whimsical and tongue-in-cheek and if you haven't a bucolic bone in your body this is not for you. However, if you don't expect too much you will find this an enjoyable 50 minutes with some engaging people and activities. Sorry that the other reviewers were so disappointed.",1299628800,21,649,4.603448275862069
3737550,1,B001P32Y9G,"If you're expecting to see a lot of beautiful English villages and beautiful English countryside, you won't find that in this DVD. There is less than 5 minutes of scenery; the rest of the DVD is devoted to interviewing a lot of rather uninteresting villagers, a display of vegetables in an ugly building and an extremely irritating narrator.",1261526400,9,341,4.896551724137931

3737553,4,B001P32Y9G,"Travel is expensive, and many of us will never get more than a few hundred miles from home.  This was an excellent way to see a bit of England from home.

Overall, it's not a perfect documentary, but it's still one well worth watching.  I definitely enjoyed it, despite its quirky nature.",1481068800,,288,4.5

3737584,5,B001P32Y9G,"I loved this tiny slice of English village life with some lovely surprises thrown in. Nigel Farrell inserts himself into the film just enough to keep the narrative going, but lets the people and places speak for themselves. Clearly not an egomaniac, he is a wonderful tour guide. I hope there is more of his work to discover-- I hope this was one episode in a series!",1430524800,,367,4.492537313432836
3737585,5,B001P32Y9G,"Though the eye wear and outfits are dated, the topic of English villages never

3737586,3,B001P32Y9G,"Quirky and fun.  The narrator travels through parts of England on the search for the perfect village.  Each site is unique and colorful and interviews with the ""natives"" add color.  The cinematography left a little to be desired but, otherwise, enjoyable visit around the countryside.",1429747200,,284,5.266666666666667

3737588,5,B001P32Y9G,I loved this because it showed the England the way I would love to see it..Bosham is one of the first places it showed which was a surprise for me .. I would love to live there because its where the Godwinsons were from and I have been reading about Harold Godwinson and he was an amazing man .. I think England would be different today if he hadnt been killed at hastings but sadly he was and England is what it is today.,1426723200,,422,4.035714285714286

3737606,4,B001P32Y9G,"I thought it was absolutely charming!  It is a nice, up close look at some typical English villages. Even though it is rather an old production, it is comforting in a way to see someplace so calm and steeped in traditions.  I would love to live in any one of the villages featured in this film. I will go back and watch it again when I want to escape this vastly troubled modern world  for a while. Great experience!",1415836800,,416,4.2405063291139244

3737609,3,B001P32Y9G,An older and intentionally tongue-in-cheek documentary that gives an insider's view of what small English villages looked like when pubs and red phone booths and double decker red buses were still part of the English scene.,1415059200,,223,5.222222222222222

Anyone will get a laugh out of this one and learn about the life in a variety of villages in England.  Of course, it's a bit old but still a lot of info re:these villages.  Highly recommend it.  Watched it with a couple from England and they even enjoyed it.  Actually had her translate some for us when filmed in a pub.",1412553600,,411,4.075

3737623,5,B001P32Y9G,First saw this on PBS many years ago and fell in love with the story.  The fact he used a Morris Minor to drive around England  only made me love it more. This is a must watch for all who love England.,1407024000,,201,3.761904761904762

English humor (yes I'm of English decent) was such a laugh!  This could have been a series as far as I am concerned and would watch every episode.",1406332800,,282,4.109090909090909
3737626,5,B001P32Y9G,"Sweet and entertaining mini-travelogue of writer's quest for the ""perfect English village.""  In Farrell's humorous monologue, he quaint history, culture, customs, and ad/disadvantages of each village are presented from his research and interviews with residents. It makes me think of how many times I have visited other cities/countries and at first been ready to set down stakes but after spending a longer time there concluded that there is ""no place like home.""

3737630,2,B001P32Y9G,"Not a High quality production by today's standards.  Rather poor video quality.  Not just sure how old it is, but worth viewing for the content alone, and not for the production values.",1403481600,,185,4.75
3737631,4,B001P32Y9G,"I used to live in Barnes, that is why I watched it. I just think he interviews too many old people.",1403308800,,99,3.761904761904762

3737633,3,B001P32Y9G,"This starts off as an escape from urban life, with promising interludes in a couple of quaint villages that seem endearing until the scope widens and we see busloads of tourists, etc.  You'd think (hope?) that there is an idyllic English village somewhere, but the effort seems fruitless.  Until. like a shaggy dog story, we are surprised with a not very satisfying and contrived conclusion.

Why not rate it less than 3 stars?  The scenery is delightful and the main personality amusing.  Some of the villagers are downright endearing.  But titling a compilation of leftover vacation footage as the search for an idyllic English village, well, bah!",1402963200,2,649,5.018691588785047
3737634,4,B001P32Y9G,England is one of my favorite places to visit.  I loved the towns in the English countryside.  Loved his car but don't ask me how the thing was able to go 2000 miles.  The photography was great.  I would love to do what he did if I could drive on the wrong side of the road.  Oh well!,1402531200,,284,3.8275862068965516
3737635,2,B001P32Y9G,"Cute might be the best word to describe this little film.  It is full of British wit and humor as the host looks for the ""Perfect"" English village.  A little slow by today's standards but fun to watch.",1402358400,,201,4.2631578947368425
3737636,5,B001P32Y9G,"This is a dated but very enjoyable video of one person's search for the perfect English village.

3737637,3,B001P32Y9G,"This ""search"" comes across as a heavily scripted and set-up contrivance.  The hidden gems are all well known and the ""spontaneous"" joyous pub evenings and interviews with jolly locals are fairly excruciating.  Likewise, the toadying to the local aristocracy.  That said, if you don't know Britain and its villages, this does show the scenery nicely.",1402185600,,349,5.3090909090909095
3737638,4,B001P32Y9G,"This film is like a documentary but is shorter.  It is about 1 hour long and basically follows a journalist through several small English villages and you see some quirky situations and some quirky people.  It is funny, even laugh out loud funny at times.  If you like people watching and your are an Anglophile, I think this video will be of interest to you.  It is a bit on the older side, but still interesting.",1401926400,,414,4.407894736842105
3737639,3,B001P32Y9G,"In 1989 this fellow is fed up with city life and goes in search of the perfect village.  He finds several towns where ""time stands still"" filled with pensioners and sheep.  The premise is thin, but the focus is on the scenery and it is beautiful to see these nods to history that manage to plug along.  As a viewer in 2014 I kept wondering what happened to those villages in the past 25 years and wished I could see updates.",1401926400,5,424,4.209876543209877
3737640,5,B001P32Y9G,This is a very interesting tour of places I don't think I'd see on a trip to England.  The quirks of the villages makes it fun.,1401753600,,127,3.8846153846153846
3737641,4,B001P32Y9G,"We enjoyed the variety of villages in England, and though we lived there, we hadn't been to any of those that were featured.  There probably is no perfect village, though Nigel found some that were pretty close!",1401235200,,211,4.702702702702703
3737642,4,B001P32Y9G,"Nigel Farrell's video is fun if you like cute and quirky and if you are something of a reality t.v. show fan.  It was shot nearly 25 years ago and it's hard to know whether the villages, people and lives which he caught on film can still be found.  It's something of a slice out of an earlier era - and it must have seemed so even in 1990 to many in more urban areas of Britain.  Worth a look!",1398729600,,393,3.8875
3737643,5,B001P32Y9G,"I  really enjoyed Nigel Farrell's Perfect English Village. Filmed in such a splendid manner whilst giving the viewer lots of fun and cheer, getting to know the villagers and their quirks, alongside the folly of the entire premise.
My favorite was meeting The Honorable Simon Howard along with his lovely wife and their famous, enthralling and unforgettable Castle Howard, where Brideshead Revisited was filmed on location there.
The other villages presented in this film were charming as well.
Well done Nigel Farrell!

3737647,5,B001P32Y9G,"It is made for Americans, but it gives one a sweet little slice of rural English country life.  The narrator is quirky and the spontaneous visits are staged, but is is very cute.  I will watch it several times, I'm sure.

It is a cute piece of British fluff, but worth watching if you have an a hour and want a quick getaway to the English countryside.",1396569600,,352,4.223880597014926

I went to Great Britain in my twenties and though I'm an American and proud of it; I occasionally dream of the sedate, predictable old England of Agatha Christie.  I certainly wouldn't fit in there, or be accepted, but I hold out a silly fondness for it.  Go figure.",1395619200,22,362,4.264705882352941

3737654,2,B001P32Y9G,"There's a lot more to England than the south and much of it is nicer than these boring places. Considering he drove 2,000 miles it's hard to see how he never got more than a couple of hours from London. Typical of a southerner to think he doesn't need to look outside his own area. Reminds me of the Americans calling their local rounders competition The World Series. Very insular and parochial.

Where would I go? Bamburgh, Wooler, Rothbury, Holmfirth, Braithwaite, Allendale, Newton in Bowland... there are so many lovely villages that aren't in the dramatically over priced, over busy and over self important deep south of England.",1394928000,,635,4.87962962962963
3737655,4,B001P32Y9G,Clever and fun. Just the right amount of quirky. Enjoyed the glimpse of true English villages and the local perspective.,1394582400,,120,5.05
3737656,2,B001P32Y9G,"I honestly thought that the camera work was done by an amateur in the 70's. Although I love Nigel Farrell and thought the content was interesting enough, I had to turn it off after 30 minutes because I found myself looking away due to the camera work.

3737659,5,B001P32Y9G,"I lived in the east of England about eight years ago.  Furthermore I had a red Morris Minor( identical interior and exterior to the vehicle he drove) shipped to the United States when I moved back. This is a charming look at village life circa 1990 England, which is noticeably different to how most Englanders live. From the scene with the fox hunt dogs to the morris dancers, a torrent of emotions came back to me. My England days probably have been the best days of my life so far. Those that criticized the film probably don't have a firm grasp of british culture or humo(u)r. This was made for the British audience, not Americans. If you want to start learning about England I'd suggest watching Rick Steves, or read some Bill Bryson, who would explain the differences between America and England alot clearer. Ironic that we both even came to the same conclusion to the most livable arraignment, that is, a small village right next to a gigantic metropolis. Like he said the best of both worlds. On a side note, I just read that Nigel Farrell, the narrator, died of pancreatic cancer in 2011, rest in peace.",1389484800,3,1113,4.592964824120603
3737660,2,B001P32Y9G,This is an old.old..video as evidenced by the car the narrator was driving.  Boring narration...bla..bla about the offbeat people who live in these little English Villages.  Waste of time.,1389139200,2,188,5.448275862068965
3737661,2,B001P32Y9G,Each visit seemed very contrived--does not feel like a true documentary.  Nigel Farrell is not engaging in any way.  Feels very dated.,1389052800,,134,5.045454545454546
3737662,4,B001P32Y9G,I thought this might deal with only THE best englkish Village but it turned out to be a quest to find one.  Lots of good scenery throughout England as the narrator makes his way to the various Villages.,1387670400,,202,4.315789473684211
3737663,3,B001P32Y9G,I decided to view this movie because my ancestry is part English. Although I have visited London I never had the opportunity to venture out into the outskirts/English villages/etc. I enjoyed it although I think it is a little dated it was still very good.,1387411200,,255,4.688888888888889
3737664,5,B001P32Y9G,"I really enjoyed this documentary.  It was quite humorous, which I didn't expect, and it was a lot of fun.  I wanted it to go on longer, but then again I'm a rabid anglophile, so I never get enough of British charm and humor.",1386892800,,225,4.090909090909091

3737666,4,B001P32Y9G,"The Perfect English Village is difficult to find, you want a pub, quiet and serene countryside, land for sale, and lovely people in the community.

Nigel Farrell takes on his search for the picturesque village in his mind's eye. And, what he finds are remnants of what he is looking for in each village. In an old Morris Minor, a car I have never seen before, he visits villages with the names of, Lacock I'm Wiltshire, Finchingfield in Essex, Drewsteignton in Devon and Bosham in Sussex. Such lovely villages all. Each community has it's own peculiarities, lines and dislikes. We hear from the townspeople about their community. An iconic village is finally found, and you can find for yourself.

Lovely, jaunt through some villages in England, with a fun and sometime serious look at life.

It's not a ""Rick Steves"" tour, rather a tale of 3 or 4 very odd villages in England. It's entertaining enough and we watched it to the end, which we guessed before he ever got there. Still, seeing how really odd some English folks are, and the guide's mode of transportation made us happy to be living in the ol' USA!",1385683200,,454,4.2298850574712645

3737672,5,B001P32Y9G,A lot to see in so many quaint places is like stepping back in time. I especially loved the section on Castle Howard from Brideshead Revisited fame and all the lovely people who live there. A nice upbeat video. Well done.,1381190400,13,221,4.414634146341464

8331993,5,B001P32Y9G,"I adored this little documentary. People here on Amazon are complaining that it's outdated, but that's one of the things I like about it. It's from around 1989 and it's nice to see how life was there nearly three decades ago and how many older people in this film are no longer here, especially 'Aunt Mabel', who were probably only filmed once in their lifetime. And the moral of the story is, even when you complain about the hustle and bustle and insanity of life in the city where you live, you can travel thousands of miles trying to find your own Utopia, but sometimes you end up finding it just a stone's throw away.",1489104000,3,622,4.417391304347826
