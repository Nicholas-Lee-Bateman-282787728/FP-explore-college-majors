4396526,5,B004KDYR16,"Essential Hasbarah material for the pro-Israel activist, or someone who wishes to gain a good insight into the Jewish claim on the Holy Land.
Movie is fact focused, and includes an unapologetic Jewish viewpoint based on solid facts.
Uses historical facts argued very well to support its hypothesis that the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is not all about land. Was it Arab honor , pride or short-sightedness that led Yasser Arafat to reject 97% of the West Bank, including East Jerusalem as proposed by Clinton or pragmatism?  Whatever the reason the argument for pre-1967 borders is demolished.
Best documentary on the Palestinian-Israeli conflict I have ever seen. Obvious bias towards Biblical viewpoint. Every documentary is biased. Sure the Arab side receives consideration and pro-Zionist Arabs are also heard.(very rare)
If you want a typically pro-Arab viewpoint showing Jews as outsiders, who do not belong in the Middle East, please skip this movie.

Gives several facts that support the Jewish argument which although true might offend Palestinians. you would not find anywhere else.
Essential viewing for those who wish to see past the media perceptions.
Gives a strong religious Jewish viewpoint which is almost always muted by the Israeli secular Left who often seem far more concerned with regards to not offending Arab sensitivities then promoting a pro-Israeli viewpoint.",1435968000,3,1386,5.412037037037037
4396527,5,B004KDYR16,"An extremely eye-opening and educational documentary for anyone who wants to know the reality of the reasons for the Arab-Israel conflict which so grips and concerns the world today.
Chris Atkins interviews a wide range of people including chair of Arabs for Israel and author of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Now-They-Call-Me-Infidel-Why-I-Renounced-Jihad-for-America-Israel-and-the-War-on-Terror/dp/1595230440/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Now They Call Me Infidel: Why I Renounced Jihad for America, Israel, and the War on Terror</a>&nbsp;Nonie Darwish - a true voice of reason, Itamar Marcus and Barbara Crooks of Palestine Media Watch and historians and archaeologists like the eminent Dan Bahat, the foremost authority today on Jerusalem's ancient history. As well as Israeli military spokesmen and exhortations for peace by Israel's leaders.
We also see much footage of the hateful rhetoric and vile agitprop disseminated by the Palestinian leadership from Arafat through to Hamas. Hence Arafat's rallies where he exhorted crowds towards bloodshed, Muslim clerics urging followers to kill Jews and calling Jews 'pigs and apes' , Hamas leader Khaled Meshaal railing how before Israel is violently destroyed it must be humiliated.

the documentary deals with the vast venomous network of propaganda from the sewers of the Arab world and the main stream media and the left (we see clips of interviews where the likes of the sinister Jimmy Carter and far left anti-Israel academic Norman Finkelstein vomit out anti-Israel lies and venom).

The documentary begins by explaining how the conflict is not about land or occupation but about Israel's very existence which the muslim world violently rejects. It traces the rejection by Arafat in 2000 at Camp David of a generous offer by the then Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak of all of Gaza, half of Jerusalem ands 98% of the West Bank, violently rejected by the PLO leader who then launched the bloody second intifada, a war of terror against Israel's civilian population.
It explains how the thousands of murdered Israeli men, women and children necessitated the building of a security fence (dubbed perfidiously by Israel's evil accusers the 'Apartheid Wall'). Even this peaceful way of protecting her people led to demonization and hysteria against the tiny Jewish State. It is pointed out that while the world is made very aware of the 800 000 Arabs that left Israel in 1948, there were also 900 000 Jews who fled Arab lands they had lived in for centuries after pogroms, at the same time.
This documentary also takes us through the partition plan of 1947 and the attack of five  Arab armies on the fledgling state of Israel in the War of Independence, how the Arabs forced the Six Day War on Israel and how Israel begged Jordan to stay out of the war. As well as the 1978 Camp David peace accord with Egypt followed three years later by the assassination of Anwar Sadat by the Muslim Brotherhood.

  This documentary explains how the word 'Palestinian' never referred to the Arabs who claim the Land of Israel as their homeland until after the re-establishment of the Jewish State in 1948. The Palestine Post, the Palestine fund, the Palestine Brigade of the British Army before 1948 were all Jewish institutions. This identity was stolen by the Muslim Arabs mainly under the leadership of the PLO from 1964.
Also traced here are the absurd accusation of Muslim propagandists that there was no Jewish presence in the Holy Land and the ancient Israelites were Arab and Muslim. Archaeologist and historian Dan Bahat shows us the evidence which is so obvious of Israel being rich in proof of the 3000 year + Jewish presence. The film also focuses on the bloody takeover of Gaza by Hamas from Fatah in 2007 in which Hamas killed tens of thousands of Gazans,m far more than killed in the conflict with Israel. But this was never focused on by the mainstream media because it was Arab on Arab and Jews and Israel could not be blamed.
The documentary concludes with please for peace by Nonie Darwish and  Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu.
Ms Darwish urges Muslim Arabs not to compete with Israel through war and violence but in trade, and peaceful education and development
Much of the message of this peace is the way Arab children are indoctrinated in murderous hate of Jews and Israel and glorification of bloodshed and death. Barbara Crooks of PMW points out how before there can be any peace talks at all, the Palestinians have to change their education system and school their children in peaceful coexistence like Israel does, and away from hate and bloodlust.",1410048000,3,4668,5.191235059760956
4396528,5,B004KDYR16,"If you've looking for a detailed, detached, narrative and analysis of the Middle Eastern Conflict, then you're looking in the wrong place. Don't condemn this work because you have misunderstood its intent.

The object of this documentary is much narrower. It aims to point out that there in an alternate agenda behind the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Ostensibly the conflict is about two peoples fighting over the same land, both claiming it as their ancestral homeland.

Through his interviewees Atkins points out that the Palestinian cause is, in fact, based on racism justified and propagated by religion.

His argument is weakened by some sweeping generalisations made by his interviewees.  As with many situations such as this, the dogma espoused by the Palestinian leadership may or may not be held to be true by any particular Palestinian individual, but then the leadership doesn't need complete acceptance, only a sufficiently large proportion of the populace need be convinced.",1396828800,3,988,5.396103896103896
4396529,5,B004KDYR16,I watched this movie on Netflix. It was so good that I recently went to watch it again and found it was no longer available on Netflix.  So I decided to order it.  I want to share the information found in this documentary with everyone!!  As Americans we are uneducated about the history of Israel as a nation and about Palestinian people.  If you want to know for your self...so that YOU can formulate your own opinion---WATCH THIS MOVIE!  I plan to use this as part of my home school curriculum...my kids will know.,1365724800,,517,4.457446808510638
4396530,1,B004KDYR16,"I was really hoping that this movie would be a fair representation of the history, politics and perspectives of both the Israelis and Palestinian people. As someone who is interested in world history and politics, I wanted to learn more about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and gain a better understanding of the complex situation.

Unfortunately, the movie is one-sided, lacks of historical facts, and [in my perspective] was created to discredit and disprove any evidence or argument that may be perceived as threatening to Israel. The movie portrays Palestinians as terrorists and un-wanting of peace. ""From the time they are born, Palestinian children are taught to be martyres."", ""[All Arabs] want to destroy Israel.""

What about the Palestinian olive farmers who just want to work the same land as the generations before them, only to have their land taken away by Israeli settlers? What about the Palestinian's right to exist and their right to have a state to call their own?",1364083200,20,985,5.15

8432790,1,B004KDYR16,"Seriously is this a joke?  A parody?  It's fantastical. Ridiculous. Israeli mythology.  Okay sure, the 1.8 million Palestinians in Gaza who are not allowed to leave by Israel, who live in an open air prison surrounded by a wall, who have their homes bombed and destroyed with 58 seconds to run from them, whose children are blown up by the hundreds by Israeli flechette bombs, whose children are imprisoned and tortured by the thousands along with the Palestinians in the West Bank who endure being treated like cattle held for hours a day in cages, humiliated, arrested and held with no charges, tortured, their homes and lemon and olive groves destroyed, their water and electricity cut off -- these groups of Palestinians, if one were high on meth enough to believe this ""documentary"" are constantly offered 95% of their land back by the altruistic Israelis but they staunchly refuse because they apparently hate Israel more than they love themselves.  How did the very film this was movie was imprinted upon not melt under the weight of it's own stupidity?",1440460800,,1060,4.905027932960894
8432791,1,B004KDYR16,"This is too far from being an independent and real story about the conflict. First half of the movie was ok but the rest of the movie was all about showing Hamas and different Arab leaders about how they want to kill Jews, etc. This movie is a clear propaganda of how bad Palistinians are.

A) It's not fair if you if you create a documentary and only show one side of the coin

B) it's a lie and no serious research was done to make this documentary unique and real. Most people who talked in this movie were from Israel.

C) you see the point when this movie goes from being neutral to being on Israels side right away.
Good documentary is a set of facts about both sides and you leave it to a viewer to decide what's wrong and who is right in a certain conflict you don't make your own conclusions.
This movie is good for brainwashing an average American and also trying to convince someone that most Muslims are terrorists. I'm a Christian so my opinion is completely neutral. I don't support both side and I do know they both do wrong things and this conflict is very complicated in general. Trying to make a movie and show it as a short story from history in modern times is a really bad idea.",1440201600,3,1199,4.25

8432793,4,B004KDYR16,"But for an understanding of Mohammedism, this video would appear extreme. Mohammed is the perfect man, all he did was perfect, and his behavior is to be emulated. Mohammed hated and devoted his life to destroying Jews. This is why Iran and ISIS, Shiite and Sunni, bitter enemies otherwise, can as to Jews be on the same page. Destroying Jews is a  fundamental Muslim value. Because Mohammedism is perfect,  it forms the perfect man, and there is no ""reforming"" the perfect. Led by an Islamic scholar, ISIS is not ""extreme"", it is the true and faithful manifestation of Mohammed. Same with Iran's  Hezbollah, same with the Arafat and Fatah. I seem to recall Arafat called for Palestinian women to have 8 kids; 2 for the parents and 6 for jihad. And as long as there is a faithful Muslim, Jews will be slaughtered.

No Arab country will grant citizenship to Palestinians and endless money is poured into Gaza for weapons are  for the same purpose - keep a permanent supply of well-armed Muslims killing Jews while maintaining the shared ""outrage"" . The shared outrage is not that Muslims are persecuted by Jews. The shared outrage is that Jews and especially Israel exist at all.

President Obama in 2009 said Muslims should stop using Israel as a distraction for deep social problems in the Islamic world. But it's not a distraction at all - it is the expression of unchangeable perfect Islam. It is the one unifying source for every faithful Muslim regardless of sect. Kill Jews.

Within this context, watch the video. I subtracted one star because of its overly stark contrast between ""good rational Jews"" and ""bad Arabs"" who live to kill and be killed for Mohammed. There are some really ""bad guy"" Israelis. And I expect many Muslims just want to have a decent life and they are being slaughtered by true Islam as much as are the Jews. But the whole ""system"" is set up to keep this war going until Jews and Muslims eventually incinerate each other. It's just a matter of when.",1438387200,5,1978,4.68299711815562
8432794,1,B004KDYR16,"This movie is the creation of the terrorists Jews who stole the lands of Palestine from the Palestinians.  Everything in this movie is a 100% lie and fabrication.  Zionists are a bunch of barbaric terrorist and are behind all of the trouble in the world, it was Israel that was behind 9/11, it was Israel that was behind the creation of Al-Qaeda and ISIS .. ISIS acronyms actually stands for ""Israeli Secret Intelligence Services"".

Don't waste your money on this and certainly don't give your money to those criminal Jews.  The only holocaust that truly ever existed is the holocaust committed by thew Jews and Israelis against the Arabs and the people of the world.",1436659200,2,667,4.773913043478261
