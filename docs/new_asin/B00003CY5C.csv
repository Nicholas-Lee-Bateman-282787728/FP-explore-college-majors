1318134,1,B00003CY5C,"Well, with such a good cast of voice characters, I decided to give this ""cartoon"" a go. Big mistake. Considering I like sci-fi, the story is the worst boring hokey pokey ever. It also reeks of religious overtones. Yuck! It's like a slow death. I found myself begging for it to end. Extremely painful.

1318136,5,B00003CY5C,"In 1982, Blade Runner was introduced to the world.  It was a film that was ahead of its time, with amazing visual effects as well as an up-and-coming Harrison Ford and with a solid supporting cast consisting of Darryl Hannah, Rutger Hauer, Edward James Olmos, Sean Young, and the late Brion James.  Although the film tanked at the box-office and was lambasted by countless critics, the film gained a strong following and eventually recouped its losses through VHS rentals.
Ten years after Blade Runner flopped at the box office, its director, Ridley Scott, decided to revisit the film.  In the film's 10th anniversary, Scott recut the film to fit his vision and had the film briefly rereleased in theatres.  By this time, Blade Runner had made its mark in popular culture from being continiously referenced in the visual and written media whenever anything containing a dark, gritty, futuristic setting, being spoofed in a episode of the hit cartoon show ""Tiny Toon Adventures"", and becoming a cult classic among colleges kids, who were the same generation who saw the movie in theatres, VHS, and on television.
When the Director's Cut of Blade Runner was released to theatres, critics that originally dismissed the film gave it strong, highly positive reviews that, in a sense, certified the movie's significance in popular culture.  In addition, Blade Runner: The Director's Cut was inducted into the American Film Institute's top 100 Thrillers with the such films as Rosemary's Baby and Psycho to name a few.  Moreover, the National Film Preservation Board inducted Blade Runner to its National Film Registry.
Now in the year 2001, with a movie that also has the state-of-the-art visual FX and voiced by an all star cast of Ming-Na, Alec Baldwin, Steve Buscemi, Ving Rhames, James Woods, and Donald Sutherland.  Like Blade Runner, this movie, Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within, was a box-office disaster and received polarised reviews from countless film critics.
Nonetheless, Final Fantasy, like Blade Runner, will receive a new lease on life when it arrives in a Special Edition DVD.  This DVD will redeem Final Fantasy with its intricate documentaries detailing the countless manhours required to create the life-like chracters and the world around them.  Moreover, the DVD will contain a feature that will allow its owner to recut the film as he or she sees fit.  Therefore, it is unjust that one places or even compares this movie among the likes of Tomb Raider, Demolition Man, and Super Mario Bros.  The movie had a straightforward storyline, and highly realistic characters to the point one would forget that it was a Computer Generated movie.  Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within receives my vote of being the vote for being one the the most innovative and influential films of alltime",997833600,,2795,5.065359477124183

1318334,4,B00003CY5C,"Final Fantasy The Spirits Within is a great film that unfortunately has not aged well wtih time. When it originally came out, the movie was a hallmark of where completely CGI movies could go in terms of quality of animation, and I daresay it helped give us many of the modern films that we love.

However, the film does suffer from a pretty simplistic story that needed far more time to breathe. In the days when the film was originally released, it faced massive backlash because it is more or less a military science fiction film with no real connections to any of the Final Fantasy games. Many fans of the franchise were very critical of this, but myself, having never been a fan of the Final Fantasy franchise, was able to view this movie without the lens of a fanboi. And what I saw was a movie that /was/ a generic military science fiction film that just happened to have a very high production quality to it.

We need more time with the characters to establish a emotional connection with them (something that is hard to do today simply because of how outdated and wooden the animation is and simply hard back then because the middling quality of the story). We need more time to really learn what happened to the world and the motivations behind the bad guys outside of the film just needing bad guys. And Ironically enough the bad guys end up becoming the most fleshed out characters in the film simply because we're given the time to learn their motivations.

The good guys, in compariosn, are good because the film needed protagonists.

All in all this film IS flawed. IT is a product of a early stage in complete, realistic CGI films that was linked to dull characters and a story that never really reaches any incredible heights. But at the same time, it does have such incredible prduction value and art direction that if you are a fan of science fiction in general, you wwill probably enjoy this movie simply for the spectacle of it, and owning a cult classic from the quality sci-fi drought of the early 2000s.",1471651200,,2026,4.542465753424658

Best part is, it has all of the extras from the original DVD Special Edition, which a family member accidentally stepped on and broke a few years back.

It brought shame to the Final Fantasy name. They could have at least tried to incorporate at least one aspect of the franchise into the movie. They tried to bring a ""Cid"" in and they even couldn't even do that right because it's spelled with a S.

I remember enough about this movie to know why its bad or average. Its about a space colony looking for a new home planet or something like that. Very action oriented with soldiers blasting everything. Pretty much like Star Ship Troopers with out the nudity.

This movie is it's own stand alone cartoon apart from the Final Fantasy franchise. It had great animation. The script was stale and very predictable. The casting for the characters was good. Alec Baldwin sounded decent in his role. James Woods was great as the antagonist and Steve Buscemi was okay.

My real problem with this is the plot. Again, it seemed two dimensional and just became a movie about the special effects involved.

I am on medical disability and rarely go out to a movie theater because of pain while sitting and the cost.  I'm happy I purchased it, because, as I said:  I love it!

Even after all this time the movie looks like it could be a new release, but for back then it was unequaled.  To be honest Ive never really played a Final Fantasy game, nor do I know much of anything about that universe, so my basis for this is simply on the movie itself.  Which I find to be an incredibly fun watch even to this day.

I have finally broken down and decided to upgrade my copy to blu-ray based on a friends recommendation.  I heard it was missing some of the special features that the DVD had, but to be honest I don't usually take the time to check out any of that stuff anyway, so not a deal breaker for me by any means.
Id recommend this to anyone who is a fan of sci-fi, whether they care for animation or not.  The animation of this movie is of such quality that at times you kind of even forget thats what it is (well maybe thats a stretch!).  Because I saw this movie back when this technology was pretty new, it holds a special place for me.  The newer generation would probably still like the movie, but I don't think theyd be as blown away as I was as a kid.",1406505600,3,1377,4.062962962962963

1319029,3,B00003CY5C,"The release of this film in theaters was preceded by the showing of a breathtaking trailer, months in advance.
It was a groundbreaking attempt to create CG animation that made a very realistic approximation of live action cinema.
The story is OK, although by the end it starts to sag under its own epic weight.
The ending seems to demand a sequel to continue the story line, but as sometimes happens in the world of CG, Square Pictures - the studio that made the movie - went bankrupt producing it.
Challenges including tracking 60,000 individual strands of hair in zero-G as Aki moved about the cabin of the space vehicle.
I'm writing this in 2014 days before Oscar Awards Sunday. The film Gravity is up for many awards, and that film was criticized for not even taking on the challenge of making strands of hair move in zero-G - so the accomplishments that Square Pictures made  are even more remarkable, considering that they were working with it 15 years ago.
The main reason I wanted to leave a review was not to say so much about the actual film - others have done far better with this.
I just wanted to compare features of the DVD to the Blu-ray Disc.
The DVD is loaded with Easter eggs, some of which are delightful. A lot of thought went into the production of the DVD.
Most charmingly, Disc 2 opens with a virtual sound stage scene that dissolves the boundaries between realities and has Aki's character interacting with production team members. Watching this for the first time was so much fun. The only way to see this that I know of is on the DVD version - it is missing from the BD version along with many Easter eggs.
It feels like there just is no way to explain today how astonishing this film was when it first came out. There had never been anything remotely like it. That's nowhere near enough to keep it from sliding into complete obscurity, of course.",1392768000,3,1873,4.508823529411765

Being an avid FF geek(favorite is FF8) you tend to want the movie to follow the same roles as the games.  it does in sort of a way: one the plot evolves around a girl, you have to go about collecting things and Cid is in it.  But the movie has its draw backs of not following the games as for the characters: no mages, knight, thief, or monk.  But overall you have to pay attention to the movie in order to get it.",1392681600,,509,3.8653846153846154

Still, I think the story is likable and the characters believable. And some of the tech that is used in the movie is really intriguing.
One plot point that sort of links to Final Fantasy is the gathering of 8 spirits to make one powerful spirit that saves the day.

The soundtrack isn't bad but it's not that fantastic either. I do like the credits track though.
The CG are cutting edge for the time in which the movie was made. There are some spots where they are so precise that it is kinda easy to forget the people are animated and see them as real actors. Though this is likely individual perception.

Short synopsis of the movie: Dr. Aki and her mentor Dr. Cid is looking for 8 spirits to create an ethereal wave that is the exact opposite of the  ethereal wave of the invading alien spirits called Phantoms. With this 'weapon' she aims to eradicate all of the Phantoms and the source from which they spawn. Against her method of attack is a more violent one by means of a space OP cannon called Zeus whose team leader wants to strike the point of origin for the Phantoms with insane amounts of energy. Dr. Aki is against this method because she believes in Gaia/Gaea and that such a brutish assault would injure the planet's spirit and cause more devastation.",1388448000,,1397,4.509881422924901

1319222,4,B00003CY5C,"Lets get this clear, this is a fully CGI animated film that's more than a decade old which in my opinion is still on par with the more recent CGI films and basically paved the way for them with details such as hair and skin complexion being simply stunning. If you are looking at this product because of the Final Fantasy title then you are in the wrong place, and I think that is why this film failed at the box office. However that should not put you off, The Spirits Within is a fantastic film for any sci-fi lover or CGI animation fan. It has its hiccups every now and then from the occasional lip syncing lapse to emotional expression and cheesy dialogue but that's to be expected from a film this age. The story is slightly unoriginal and can be lacking in some places but the voice acting and animation make up for it, with a cast including James Woods, Keith Davids, Donald Sutherland, Ming-Na Wen (Mulan)and Alec Baldwin. I rated it so high not because of the story but because I consider it to be an art masterpiece and one of my childhood all time favourites.",1374624000,,1070,4.381909547738694
1319223,4,B00003CY5C,"First of all let me say if you're looking for a fast-paced action-type movie like Final Fantasy Advent Children - this isn't your kind of movie, Advent Children is it. In fact this movie isn't at all related to any of the games from what I can tell. This is a much more slowly paced movie that frankly I had to watch again to really take in fully. It's an entertaining movie because of the subtle drama elements that they put in plus the fantastic CGI work. When this came out it was absolutely state of the art, and the quality holds up well even to this day. The basic story you can probably gather from the synopsis or IMDB, and in my opinion is a bit tricky to understand at first (though much easier to follow than some of the games) and I don't want to spoil it either. Overall it had some great set-pieces with fantastic CGI action, and explores a lot of the undertones of the quintessential character types like the headstrong general and optimistic scientist tropes. It does add some depth to these characters to show some of the motivation behind their actions rather than relegating them to cliches that you often see with animated films and lower-budget ones alike. I got into the movie once the pace started picking up and plot turns started to get thrown in.

About the only shortcoming to the quality of the CGI work comes in the form of the characters movements and their eyes. It's hard to knock this film too much on either front, since there has been considerable work done in the CGI arena since it's production/release. But still, there are many emotional scenes that are frankly carried by a powerful orchestral/instrumental score rather than the characters expressions and movements. It's really the eyes that unfortunately break the illusion due to their lack of that intrinsic ""human"" element. Thankfully the voice acting is well-delivered and feels almost completely in sync with lip movements to make the film more believable. I actually purchased the soundtrack for this film because I really enjoyed the instrumental pieces in their own right. All in all, I would say this is a solid pick up if you want to enjoy a sci-fi drama. The excellent CGI is a bonus.",1373846400,,2187,4.651162790697675

The sound track album for this movie also is grammy quality, with song number 17 being truly astonishing with a kindof sci-fi / Native American blend to the counterpoint. It's available on Amazon here:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Final-Fantasy-Original-Motion-Picture-Soundtrack/dp/B0013AUXLW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Final Fantasy - Original Motion Picture Soundtrack</a>. Most composers give Goldenthal 5 of 5 stars for this album, but it is still little recognized by the recording industry! If you pass on this film, and only want to spend a buck, download song 17 from the album, you will NOT be disappointed, guaranteed.

By now, everyone knows that this movie failed at the box office (cost, $140 million US, revenue $85 million worldwide). The plot is weak and character development poor. The big BUT: the team assembled over 12 years ago in Hawaii to CG the film is historic for the technology of the time. It literally is, in some ways, technically BETTER than Avatar! If you have any interest in the technology, this is a must have disc.

If you're just trying to relax with a ""good movie"" the plot will probably fail you. The underlying premise is wonderful, as is the game series, of alien spirits as the challenge, but this slice of a story doesn't capture the majesty of that premise, except in the utterly amazing graphics and music. That's the blend and balance. I'm the CTO of shaderjoes dot com, an animation studio, and that's my bias.

This would make for a great video game, sadly as a movie ""Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within"" is rather blah, its pretty to look at and the voice over actors do a decent job, the cast includes Donald Sutherland, Ving Rhames, Ming Na, Steve Buscemi, Alec Baldwin, James Woods, Keith David and others. The problem is the story is very typical, not a lot of twists and well the dialogue is quite stagnant, again the visuals are very well done but its a simple concept that is really just dressed up with a lot of pretty images.

I do get why people either praise or slam this flick, it does look good but and maybe this is because I didn't care about the characters but I felt no real attachment or any empathy for anyone that died in it. It tends to limp along a lot of the time and the action sequences are boring but not nearly as boring as the talky scenes where again I didn't feel drawn into the story or any interest in the characters.

I won't say don't watch it but as far as being like Final Fantasy, at least up to the point this movie was made it was Final Fantasy in name only.

What did I like? First of all, the film is visually stunning and still holds up against the best today; for a movie over 10 years old, this is an amazing achievement. There is a lot of detail in the character models and the surroundings. The story is also deep and engaging. I enjoyed how they implemented the spirits and the fact that they state the Earth has a spirit of its own. There are plenty of thrills and action sequences, and I particularly enjoyed the evacuation sequence. I also enjoyed the music. The ending was visually stunning and musically enchanting.

What did I dislike? Some of the voice actors/acting seemed out of place at times. This was only a very minor issue, though.

1319542,4,B00003CY5C,"This review is for the two disc special edition of the Oct/2001 animated film Final Fantasy. A film that never made its creating costs,it nevertheless is a very compelling piece of animation that still to this day holds up very well. At first glance the plot can be a little heavy at times as it gets too detail oriented and even the premise(Gaia and the spirit concept)can even be a little off putting to some. But it is a film that can be scrutinized again and again,as each time you see something a little different. It was a Japanese(inspired and directed)/American co production and features the voices of Donald Sutherland,Ving Rhames,Alec Baldwin,James Wood,Steve Buschemi and others.
The story involves the Earth of 2065 now dotted with encased cities. They are under constant threat by a variety of ethereal type entities called Phantoms,who,with just a slight touch,can kill a man by taking his very essence. The film opens as one Aki-Ross is scouring the old open city of New York for a plant which is one of eight spirits needed to defeat the Phantoms. At that same time some troopers drop in on reconnaissance and luckily for Aki,end up saving her life as the Phantoms start attacking.
It turns out Aki had a relationship with the head trooper and as the movie progresses the two end up reconnecting. Aki works for a Professor Sid and from here on in the troopers,Aki and the professor will work together to collect the other spirits. However not all are happy with the spirits or Gaia theory that the professor expounds. In fact General Hein wants to use an orbiting dynamo to wipe out the main cluster of Phantoms in Russia. Both sides give their arguments at a hearing with the current administration and the professor and company buy some time.
Eventually however the domed city is attacked and an over confident Gen. Hein recklesly allows the Phantoms access but is unable to contain the threat and they overrun the city. Many of the population are killed including most of the troopers. Aki,the head trooper and the professor barely escape and head for Russia. Meanwhile the General has gone to the orbiting energy weapon and starts to rain down its deadly energy upon the Phantoms just as Aki and the trooper are going into the crater in which the Phantoms congregate. Aki has by now learned through a series of dreams,like pieces of a puzzle,that these Phantoms are not living alien creatures but spirits or ghosts of a long dead civilization. Their essence was embedded in a meteor that crashed in that crater in Russia many years before.
The energy beams force the gigantic creature in the crater farther into the ground which Aki and the trooper find is occupied by the Earth spirit Gaia. The creatures are red coloured while Gaia is blue. The trooper is killed/taken but Aki uses some of the alien kept dormant within her body,along with the other spirits,to transform the Phantoms into harmless spirits. They return to outer space in a giant shaft of blue light and the Earth returns to normal.
Technically speaking the picture is in its w/s a/r of 1:85:1 and is clear and crisp. This two disc edition is chock FULL of special features,some that only can be accessed through your computer DVD player like the complete screenplay,a version of Michael Jacksons Thriller the Final Fantasy way,and more. Included on these two jam packed discs are,among many other items,two feature length commentaries,storyboard commentary,factoids,a look at Aki as an animated character,The making of FF,a look at several aspects of the art and animation process,alternate opening,the ability to edit and playback a scene from the movie and on and on. It is a tremendous package of extras that will thrill any fan of the film.
In conclusion,this animated feature still holds up well after 10 years. The animation is detailed to the nth degree and you can practically count the hairs on Akis head. It was quite the undertaking then and could be considered the Avatar of its day. Recommended.",1317340800,,3997,4.853587115666179

I went to see the film mostly for him.  He, being so devoted to the actual video games themselves, was disappointed in the vast difference in subject presented in the film.  It had varying similarities to the tone and texture of the video games, but it was wholly its own story and concept.  I was kind of in love with it, and I must admit that it has continued to grow on me over the years.  The film, while deeply rooted in the science fiction aspect of things, gets the bulk of its staying power from the very raw and human core of the film.  It contains the same level of character development that is so engrossing within the video games (that span hours of gameplay in order to truly connect you to the characters) but in a shorter time span and with slightly more intimate appeal.  The visual effects are stunning, and the action sequences come with a sharpness that elevates them above the bulk of animated films out there.  While the plot may seem rather straightforward, it isn't.  The core themes (which revolve mostly around the spiritual) make themselves known with a beautiful subtlety that gives the audience more reason to dive in for another viewing.  With beautiful imagery and an emotional heft to compliment it, `Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within' is certainly a notch above most it's competition.",1304035200,,1481,4.571969696969697

1319640,3,B00003CY5C,"I know that Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within was supposed to be a big one when it was released back in 2001. Judging by the trailers, it looked like it would be an instant hit among the general public. But the poor box office results and the lack of an Oscar nomination proved otherwise, and this resulted in the end of Square Pictures as they assured everyone that another 3D-animated film will never be made again. A lot of people believe that the reason why this movie was either it was not successful was the minimal advertising of that it had nothing to do with the FF video games. I never played the games, but I think there's another reason why this movie failed to please the general public.

First off, I must say that the animation is downright flawless. Every scene is extraordinarily detailed: the lighting, the buildings, even the skin on the characters look absolutely real. CGI animation has really advanced over the years (same can't be said for Dreamworks, however). The problem with this movie, unfortunately, is that the animation is only one of the two redeeming factors (the other being that it has a very adult approach to CGI animation). The plot is weak: even though the storyline is far more mature than the ones in films like Open Season or Meet the Robinsons, it's still not strong enough to sustain interest. The characters are unbelievably thin: some of them are cardboard cut-outs, and most of them I could hardly care about. The romantic subplot is ridiculous: it seems like nothing but filler and is very distracting. The movie overall is somewhat hollow, and I think it's due to the simple fact that the real-looking characters can't handle real human emotions. When one character feels sad, it doesn't look or feel real. Maybe they could have used real actors.

Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within is a mixed bag. I admire the fantastic animation and the look of the film's grim environments. I also credit this film for having a very adult atmosphere surrounding the story and settings. However, the plot and characters are nothing special, and they're not very compelling. I can recommend this film for its great look, but nothing else.

1319641,1,B00003CY5C,"Final Fantasy the Spirits Within: 3 out of 10: Have you ever walked through the airport and seen one of those religious cult members with their robes and bald heads selling flowers? You ever wonder what would happen if you stuck up a conversation with one of them and went back to the compound in the unmarked white minivan? I imagine after 24 hours of food and sleep deprivation they would show you this film.

That's exactly what Final Fantasy feels like. A cult recruiting film for James Lovelock's Gaia theory. Really, forget Battlefield Earth (which was god awful but hardly filled Scientologist recruiting sites as people feared); forget Passion of the Christ, heck even Triumph of the Will was less of a propaganda film.

Besides the heavy-handed religious message the film itself is a mess. The basic plot has alien ghosts that kill on contact overrunning the earth. The one group wants to use a death star style laser in space (paid for by your tax dollars) to kill the deadly aliens. The other group wants to travel around collecting magic broccoli so Gaia will use her spirit to drive away said ghosts. Guess what side the movie is on. To make the Gaia broccoli-collecting group look more reasonable the movie stacks the deck by making the Laser people completely insane.

Even with the deck stacking and James Woods drooling as the mad general I still wondered why they couldn't try the laser? Oh that's right they might kill Gaia who lives under the earth like a cross between Lovecraft's Old Ones and a hibernating Care Bear. The animation is groundbreaking for film but really not that much better than the cut scenes in the last few Final Fantasy video games.(Which the movie has literally nothing to do with. Even the tone of the film is all wrong.)

Either unknown voice work or live actors might have been a better choice in casting. The action scenes are well done though the ghosts aren't exactly scary.

1319645,2,B00003CY5C,"This is a very dark animated film, in which a remnant of humans are fighting aliens - and each other - to survive.  On the one hand, you have a band of idealists, who believe that the Earth has a spirit that can be used to fight the invaders (whose true nature remains a mystery).  They seek spirit essences of some sort, which when united might save humanity.  On the other hand, there are militarists who see no reason to believe any of this; their ultimate weapon threatens to destroy the Earth's spirit, Gaia.

From this somewhat promising premise, the story becomes both a confusing shootout (it is unclear if the enemy aliens die and how to fight them) and a political struggle that becomes extremely deadly.  At least for me, I could not quite forget that I was watching something made up - I never suspended my disbelief and gave myself over to it.  The risks and ambitions just get bigger and bigger, the scenarios more outlandish and desperate and ultimate.  By the end, it had nearly completely lost me.

One thing that is good, in my view, is that the outcome remains unexplained and ambiguous.  The viewer is not told what happened and what it means, which is nice in that it leaves a lot to the imagination, which is the mark of all quality sci-fi.  However, I found the characters boringly two-dimensional and the plot unoriginal, in spite of the good special effects.  I assume that the product shoudl stand on its own, as I am not a gamer, and for me it barely did.

I would not recommend this except to those who like this world because of their familiarity with the game or because they want a simple adventure.  It is not for hard sci-fi fans.",1252108800,3,1663,4.485049833887043
1319732,5,B00003CY5C,"Long before James Cameron started pimping his Avatar epic, Square Pictures pioneered the world's first full-length photorealistic CGI animated movie. This was based on the hit video game franchise of the same name, although the movie took a more sci-fi approach as apposed to the more high fantasy that most of the earlier games.

Taking place on a post-apocalyptic Earth(that's right, not Ivalice!)in the mid-21st Century, Aki Ross is a scientist who is trying to collect eight seperate spirits, which when combined will create an energy field that will rid the planet of an alien force. The invaders are creatures referred to as Phantoms, which are ghostlike monsters that literally suck the souls out of people. This happened after a meteor crashed on Earth decades earlier, and the Phantoms spread throughout the world and killed off most of the humans. The survivors live in specially shielded cities, who have built a giant oribiting cannon to blast the alien meteorite and save the planet. But Sid, the scientist who created the special Phantom-proof shields, realizes that this might cause the aliens' spirit to take over the Earth's spirit known as Gaia, which would destroy all life. Sid along with Aki are enlisted the help of the special military squad of Deep Eyes, the commander of which is Aki's old boyfriend, Gray.  They try to find the remaining spirits, however the vengeful General Hein is plotting to destroy the Phantoms at any cost.

The Spirits Within was the precursor to several other computer animated films that attempted to have the characters(human or otherwise)appear as real as possible, such as Beowulf, Kaena: The Prophecy, Resident Evil: Degeneration, and Negadon. The animation was virtually years ahead of its time, which might have worked towards its disadvantage as some people were possibly just not ready for that kind of advancement in cinema. Granted, it might seem pretty common by today's standards, but when this came out in 2001 it was groundbreaking, and even busts the chops of some of the more recent digital animation.

Of course the biggest gripe most people had was that it had very little to do with any of the actual Final Fantasy games. Most fans of the series expected guys with gravity-defying hair riding on Chocobos and swinging colossally huge swords around. However, the movie offered a compelling sci-fi/action/drama which managed to incorporate most of the better attributes that the games had, mainly brilliant character development and a compelling plot.

1319736,3,B00003CY5C,"FF: The Spirits Within is an entertaining enough movie.  However, it lacks any real thematic depth and comes across as cartoonish, without any of the humor that is part of a normal cartoon.  Ming-na's and Baldwin's performances are both pretty flat and without energy.  Except for one scene in which the viewer finds out that the villain's family was killed by phantoms, he otherwise seems an uninteresting bloodthirsty caricature.  Every invading alien/war movie cliche is eventually displayed in the movie, and by the end of the movie I didn't really care what ended up happening to any of the main characters.

On the other hand, the animation still looks state of the art even in 2009.  The Phantoms are exceptionally creepy and well-designed.  I'd check this movie out free from a library, but there are much better animated movies to spend one's money on.  A better movie using this particular type of animation is ""Beowulf.""",1234828800,2,931,4.961290322580645
1319737,5,B00003CY5C,"This CGI film is a story of Aki Ross, a scientist working with fellow scientist Doctor Sid in year 2065 to free the Earth of an apparently deadly alien race called the Phantoms which has driven humanity to survive in cities under energy domes known as Barrier Cities. Aki and Sid are against General Hein, who wishes to fire the Zeus cannon from space to annihilate the Phantoms, while injuring the Earth's ""gaia"" or spirit in the process. This was the first film to attempt to create a photorealistic computer generated world with 3D characters and for the most part it succeeds with flying colors. This film is one of the most delicious films to look at for the characters are expressive and realistic and the effects and set pieces are magical and beautiful. The voice acting is great and the script is interesting, thought provoking, and entertaining.
 From the fantastical first few minutes of the film, I was immediately pulled into a sci-fi world that held so much eye candy I could barely stand it, seriously. The visuals are absolutely stunning and just looking at the screen, I wanted to see more. The action began at once and I assumed that the whole movie would be intense and action packed. But I didn't expect the movie would take to the typical Asian slow-paced storytelling as the movie progressed because the opening sequences were so incredibly awesome and engaging, though the story never got boring.
 The animation is excellent, especially the human movements. The character's faces however--well you know they aren't real humans. They are believable and lifelike, but the facial animations don't recreate those of a real human. It is never distracting though because there is just so much else to look at in the film. The female lead, Aki is beautifully done and her character is likable and watchable. In the story, Aki and Sid team up with the Deep Eyes, a group of military warriors to defend the survivors of this apparent alien invasion. They struggle to learn about these aliens and how they might be able to eliminate them. When General Hein comes into the picture, planning to blast the aliens away with the Zeus cannon, Aki and Doctor Sid warn him that doing so will injure the Earth's own spirit. General Hein does not believe this, and does not care because he is looking to kill these aliens out of revenge. The voices are well done by known American actors such as Alec Baldwin and Donald Sutherland to name a few.
 The story sometimes drags along at points, and just when you think the end is near, there's another thirty minutes to wrap things up. But it can be forgiven because it's thirty minutes more of glorious visuals and eye candy. Things never get too weird, either, like in some other Asian films, and it never gets too complicated. If it all seems complicated at first, it really isn't, if you read the main premise beforehand. Any problems with the story I found, the visuals totally made up for that. It was an amazing feat of a film Hironobu Sakaguchi made for its visuals alone. After the movie ended, I wished right away for another movie with similar technology to be made. There have been, but not to the exact degree of this one.
 Fans of the ""Final Fantasy"" video game series will most likely be disappointed by this film. It has nothing to do with the video games, and I am surprised it was titled as a Final Fantasy film. If you go into seeing the movie with no expectations then that is probably the best way to watch the movie. No, scratch that--you can expect an amazing, truly, truly amazing visual roller coaster, and an entertaining story to go with it on top. It is a very good film, and I loved seeing it, twice.

1319738,4,B00003CY5C,"Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within is a science fiction film by Hironobu Sakaguchi, the creator of the Final Fantasy role-playing games.  This film was the first attempt to make a photorealistic rendered 3D feature film, and was released to theaters in the United States on July 11, 2001.  Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within is only vaguely related to the Final Fantasy games.  Dr. Sid's Gaia theory (a lifeforce within the planet to which the spirits belong) is reminiscent of the Lifestream/Mako in Final Fantasy VII.  Also, Dr. Sid continues the tradition of having a character named ""Cid"" in the Final Fantasy games (although his name is spelled ""Sid"" instead of ""Cid"").

The first disc in this set contains the film, theatrical trailers, and production notes.  The second disc includes two Easter eggs: one is for a storyboard of a scene that's not in the film, while the other shows what appears to be a physical bust of Aki that is digitized.  The documentary on the DVD runs for about half an hour, and it talks about the animation, an explanation of the Gaia theory, the process for the 3D animation, the audio, and the music.

There are ""character files"" for Aki, Gray, Dr. Sid, Hein, Ryan, Jane, and Neil.  For each one, there is footage of the character with a robotic-sounding female voice-over who provides information on the character, as well as the lead animator and voice actor for that character.  The ""vehicle scale comparisons"" is in the same style as the ""character files,"" but instead covers the following vehicles: Bandit, Black Boa, and Quatro.  The ""Final Fantasy Shuffle"" allows you to re-edit the conference scene and to learn background information from the animators.  However, I couldn't quite figure out the point of this feature.  It appears you can only re-organize the footage from the film; there are no alternate angles to choose from.

""Trailer Explorations"" talks about putting together the teaser and the trailer for the film.  ""The Gray Project"" is a five-and-a-half minute piece which shows some footage that was put together as they were figuring out the designs for the characters.  ""More Boards/Blasts"" has storyboards, footage from the film, and animatics mixed together.  ""Matte Art Explorations"" shows the various mattes the animators used.  ""Joke Outtakes"" are a series of ""bloopers"" that runs for almost two minutes.  ""Compositing Builds"" shows the details of all the animation elements for one scene in the film.

The original opening that is included is very different from the scene that opened the film.  Aki's dream is different, Aki's design is different, and she also already knows what her reason for the dreams are.  Personally, I think the opening scene in the actual film is much better than this.  ""Aki's Dream"" takes all the footage of Aki's dreams and puts them together into one continuous piece.  ""DVD-ROM Content"" explains the DVD-ROM content on the DVD.  Also, there's a hidden video of the characters from the film dancing to an instrumental of Michael Jackson's ""Thriller.""

The 3D animation in this film is very well done; there were times I had to remind myself the characters on the screen were animated, not real people.  The film has pacifist themes, and military solutions tend to be either futile or are only temporarily effective.  The film is also very pro-environment.

1319739,4,B00003CY5C,"Final Fantasy has long been a watershed videogame series since its start, but did not get its due praise in the United States until series' first foray into 3D territory with its seventh installment, Final Fantasy VII. seeing the game's worldwide success, it didn't take long for Hollywood to start looking for a way to capitalize on the Final Fantasy name. A Final Fantasy movie was announced and went into production.

With the exception of Final Fantasy X-2 and the series of media based on the world and characters of Final Fantasy VII, each game in the Final Fantasy franchise bears all-new characters, settings, and stories, though themes and aesthetic aspects do recur throughout the series. And The Spirits Within carried on this tradition. This of course garnered criticism, since fans of the games preferred to see some of the characters and settings they loved from the games on the big screen (this complaint was remedied by the release of fanboy-friendly film Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children a few years later). But from a storytelling standpoint, creating a story completely independent from the games was likely the most logical choice in order for the film to appeal to a much broader moviegoing audience that would likely be unfamiliar with the games. And since each game in the series takes hours upon hours of gameplay to complete, being able to encapsulate one of the games' stories in a 2-hour film would be impossible. The film also received criticism from ""old school"" Final Fantasy fans because it shared science fiction elements similar to some of the more recent installments of the game series rather than the medieval ""sword and sorcery"" elements of the franchise's earlier games. Some even complained about the film's overall lack of magic and monsters, aspects found in all of the games.

The film is set in the year 2065. Strange ghost-like alien creatures called Phantoms have seemingly invaded Earth, sucking the life force from anyone and anything they encounter. The planet is reduced to a barren wasteland, and humanity's remaining survivors fortify themselves within cities protected by enegry barriers to keep the Phantoms out. Aki Ross, a doctor working for the military and her mentor Dr. Cid work to complete an energy wave that will eliminate the Phantoms without the use of force, but the trigger-happy General Hein believes that the only way to defeat the Phantoms is by firing all available weaponry at them, even it may destroy the Earth in the process.

Though the film took several years and $140 million dollars to make (due to the fact that the technology used to make the film wasn't created until the movie went into production), the film only made back rough $40 million of its budget and is considered by some to be one of the biggest bombs in film history. Reviews were tepid, though some, like reknowned critic Roger Ebert, applauded the film's attempt at telling a deep story and melding of Westerner and Eastern philosophy and storytelling. The film's lukewarm reviews may have to do with the film's plot, which centers around the Eastern philosophy of the ""Gaia Theory"" that Western film critics and moviegoers were mostly unfamiliar with. The film's photorealism also came into question, since characters would look startling real at one moment, then more like dolls the next.

The Spirits Within marks the first time CGI (that's Computer Generated Imagery) was used to create deatailed, photorealistic human characters, right down to Aki's hairs. It also marks the first time (and as of the moment this review is being written, the only time) a Final Fantasy story is set on Earth, though a futuristic Earth. previous works in the Final Fantasy franchise were set on fantasy planets that were Earth-like in nature only. Our Earth was likely used at the film's setting so it would be unnecessary to explain a whole new world to the audience.

Though it is remembered by many as a failure (the film production company created by the game developers to make the movie went bankrupt from the $100 million dollar loss), it is much easier now to look back on the film as one of the better films to be made from or inspired by video games, and to appreciate it for its technological achievements and its attempt to tell a very un-Hollywood kind of story.",1228608000,5,4311,4.916208791208791

Some people don't like the fact that this movie has nothing to do with the games but it didn't bother me cause I'm not a fan of the games at all. I don't understand why a game where you put in commands and watch the action rather than do it yourself, is so popular. But that's a whole different story.

This movies got a story line like none other that I've seen or heard of.

I watch it at least twice a month.

I recommend that if you have a pubic library go there check for the movie and if you like it buy it.

I should of got this movie ages ago but i rented for 4 years at $2 for 1week and did that over 17 times.

But as i said above some of my friend see it a waste of time to watch once and others are like me their get together with me just to see the movie age, So go check it out if you can and then buy it if you like it.",1207526400,,756,3.5301204819277108

The story was fine. I'm not sure why people said it sucked?

The spirits of a dead alien race are looking for peace and the planet people live on has the means to create it... how is that not a compellingly original story?

The story telling was good. You could easily see the value in the bonds that were created between the characters.

There was a love story element...

This was good stuff...

Unfortunately the voice acting was not so hot. But it wasn't horrible.

All and all this is a Visually Spectacular film with more than an average story.

1319871,5,B00003CY5C,"Ive had this film in my possession for some time, now, and each subsequent viewing is as entertaining as the last! This film was the first I had seen, where it is entirely CGI!! For some, it has become dated, because the computer field is constantly evolving, and with it, CGI special effects.
I am not so critical of this film, because it IS entertaining. Yes, the story is weak, by some, but it does keep you interested, until the very end, when it becomes a bit quasi-religious. The idea of ""Ghosts"" is interesting, as is the idea of fighting them. The introduction of ""new"" technology is likewise interesting, as that is what science fiction is all about! Casting for the voice overs was well done!! Each is easily indentifiable, and they lend to the believability of it all.
Since I am not a videogame player, the film stands on it's own merit, and for me, at least, the film works as an exceptional ""escapist reality""!!

There are a mountain of special features on the second disc, that deal with the whole process of bringing ""Final Fantasy"" to the big screen (or the little screen, for that matter). For me, these were as engaging as the film, itself! It reveals the amount of work involved in bringing a completely CGI film to completion. All in all, a very good work!",1206316800,,1277,4.552173913043478
1319872,5,B00003CY5C,"The Story: A female scientist known as Aki Ross engages in a race against time to gather together spirit entities which would help her defeat invading Alien spirits threatening Human existence. Along the way she is joined by the prestigious Deep Eyes squadron who's Captain is an old friend of Dr. Ross. Dr. Cid is in a struggle to convince a critical government that these spirits or Phantoms can easily be defeated by collecting these entities rather than using firepower which Cid knows is making the spirit situation worse.

The Review: Since first seeing this film in 2001 I have always been a big supporter and defender of this film. The storytelling is simply superb as it introduces us one by one to each character and makes us feel sympathetic towards these characters and their fight to solve the problem that is plaguing the Earth.

The animation even when compared to todays standards is truly spectacular and was evidently ahead of its time. The animation of this film is comparable to many of the cut scenes from this generation of video gaming, showing us that the level of realism achieved in this film is easily doable now and it makes me think the animators should make a new film to show us what they can achieve with todays technology.
The suspense and drama of some scenes is something that I don't feel can be matched by a lot of todays films. For example the scene when the spirits invade a human habitat which originally protected them, the chase scenes and the general emotion is placed within you through your belief in the characters.

The primary criticism that people have of this film is the slow pacing. Many American or UK movie goers wouldn't be familiar with this style as it's a very Japanese style of storytelling, traditionally known for its slow pace to allow for better character development. Over the years many Asian movies have become cult favourites amongst American and UK audiences. Movies such as Lady Vengeance and Oldboy are prime examples of how the Western audiences have begun to embrace this style of storytelling, which I believe if Final Fantasy were to be released in the Cinemas today it would gain a much better reception than it did when it was first released.

The voice casting is spectacular with a truly stellar cast of names such as Alec Baldwin, Ving Rhames, Steve Buscemi to name but a few and they genuinely do not disappoint.

A very, very good movie and a must for all those Sci-Fi, Drama and animation fans.",1202860800,5,2476,4.722222222222222

1319874,2,B00003CY5C,"This review is a mix of the movie and its relationship (if any) to the game legacy of Squaresoft's Final Fantasy. Since the first playstation arrived in America it had been ruled by one title FINAL FANTASY! And thats all I ever did play, they were the best games that I ever played in my life with their deep characters, amazing stories, and even the ability to teach gamers to cry. They were the best games and sales of that title will represnt that. When I heard about the Movie Final Fantasy I was soo excited and was so amazed by the small clips and previews they were feeding us Final Fantasy junkies. When I saw the movie on the big screen all those dreams of a final fantasy legacy on screen were crushed. this movie does have the best CG graphics by far I will give credit to that but the story and any relation to the games must have had a leave of abscense. It just wasn't there, I am not saying it is a bad movie for those who really never played the games or are used to the awesome story lines that sqauresoft usually dished out, but for those of us who were, this movie just fell short. It tried having a story similar to FFVII (7) with the thought of a crater and the Gaia and the planet having a spirit, then with FFVIII (8) with the creatures coming from space (kinda). But there were no characters from the games there was no fantasy about the movie, yes its fiction but not fantasy. There was NO ONE WITH A SWORD!!! Cmon that is the heart of all FF games. I am a huge supporter of squaresoft I loved there games and i tried supporting this movie even tried defending it saying it kinda was like the movies, but that just cant happen. There really was no character devolpment like the game either. Usually its a rag tag band of people who become friends uncover the past and there character develops until all the characters come to together to have the same destiny. Again not there. The only character development was Capt. Grey sacrificing himself for about 30 seconds and that was that. It was cool they finally used earth but thats not fantasy, I mean it starts in old New York City, nothing Agaisnt new york but thats very far from Fantasy. In the long run If you are A FINAL Fantasy junkie and you want to really see a good Fantasy movie getting back in touch with its roots, go get Final Fantasy VII ADVENT CHILDREN!

When the title was released to DVD, the significant reduction in picture resolution virtually eliminated this artificial grain.

Blu-Ray does however offer a much better resolution than DVD and this also means it reproduces the grain, much to my annoyance.

I would have given this title two stars for story and two stars for visuals, but the grain makes it seems like a high resolution analog release, so I am going to leave out the visual stars.

1320059,5,B00003CY5C,"I'll keep this short. Have you ever cried because a movie you loved was hated or ignored by everyone else? And that movie was obviously a work of art that took teams of artists years to create?

Well, that's how I felt when ""Final Fantasy TSW"" came out and died within a couple of weeks. I went to the premiere of this fine film. The theater was half-empty. I went again two weeks later, just before the movie disappeared from cineplexes. Would you believe I was THE ONLY person in the room?! When the eagle at the end soared away over the mountain range, I had to choke back angry tears. (The beautiful ending itself had caused the first upswell of tears.) Why was nobody else enjoying the show with me? And what a show it was! Great ""acting"" by the digitally created cast, especially the leads, restrained but believable dialogue, breath-taking visuals, and tight editing of a logical storyline that is so perfectly steamlined and simple it should never cause confusion. So why this tragedy of an empty theater after just two weeks?

First, many critics panned it, complained of wooden acting and a convoluted plot. They claimed the story was unoriginal; well, what other movie does it plagiarize? Apart from the stereotyped way the marines sometimes talk, what is unoriginal here? Second, the trailer was misleading; this is a moving love story, set against the spooky, solemn backdrop of a last-ditch attempt to repel an alien invasion and restore the Earth to humanity. The love is between Aki and Gray, who ultimately must love their planet enough to sacrifice their lives to save it. There is also credible caring between Dr. Sid and Aki, and Gray and his Deep-Eyes. But the trailer presented ""Final Fantasy TSW"" as a kind of juiced-up videogame. A rollercoaster thrill ride, which it is at times, but the human quality of the story is paramount. It's the only reason I would have seen this movie so many times, bought TWO copies on DVD, and now proudly own TWO copies of the Blu-ray release. It's definitely worth it.

Unfortunately, that will not bring back Square Pictures (closed up shop after the movie flopped) or reunite the gifted animators who brought the characters to life so memorably.

I was excited to hear about this movie being released, because I enjoyed the games, I had played up through FF8(I don't even remember if 9 was out yet) and I was excited to see my favorite games on the screen.  I asked myself, ""This is going to be cool!  What storyline are they going to come up with this time?""

Unfortunately, I didn't get any indication from any of the reviews in the papers.  They all preferred to focus on the novelty of taking computer animated characters and making them all look perfectly real like this was going to be the end of live acting in Hollywood once and for all.  Movie reviewers now were debating the pros and cons of computer animated ""actors,"" and I'm sitting there going, ""Oh, to hell with that!  What's the story about?""  Because that's what I loved about the games.

Finally, I saw the movie.  And for someone expecting to see a new Final Fantasy-esque storyline on the silver screen, my expectations were not met.  First off, after being taken to such places as Baron and Figaro and Midgar and Balamb, why does the movie start off in New York City?  Don't get me wrong, I love New York-it's just not Final Fantasy.

Next, the movie is literally all dialogue.  Nowhere do you have the random battles, the strengthening of characters in battle, and the preparation for the final face-to-face showdown at the end of the movie.  In fact, there was no final face-to-face showdown.  The good guys are all on Earth while the bad guy is up in the space station, and he blows himself up.

Square got so hopped up on using the technology that they neglected the plot.  They should have started out by creating a storyline using their familiar formula, and then if they wanted to use computer actors to make it, then great.  Or if anything, they should have majorly polished the plot they had before handing it to the animators(and if they had done that, they should have used a title other than Final Fantasy).",1182384000,,2037,4.498637602179836

This DVD set is an especially excellent purchase, as it comes with many fun little collector's edition items - added bonuses indeed!

1320167,3,B00003CY5C,"This movie was pretty good on a level of graphics and original storyline. If you are a big fan of the Final Fantasy games though, do not see this movie. It doesn't follow the games at all and you will be wondering why they even call this movie Final Fantasy. It has no relevence at all to the video games and fans of them will be wondering the whole time, What the heck is this?!?! It is all new characters and none of them have ever been seen before from the video games. The storyline isn't anything like the video games at all either. It is pretty much a whole different movie that just happens to have the name Final Fantasy in it.

So, if you haven't played the Final Fantasy video games, then this movie might be pretty good. If you have played the video games before and are a fan of them, then this movie will seem really bad, because it is not at all like the video games and is not what you are looking for in a Final Fantasy movie that is supposed to be based on them.

1320169,4,B00003CY5C,"As always happens in cinematic history, a movie idea comes along that sets (and in some cases, even raises) the bar for other movies to follow if possible. ""Final Fantasy - The Spirits Within"" (Special Edition) is one such movie, following in the footsteps of such science fiction greats as ""2001: A Space Odyssey"", ""King Kong"", ""Godzilla"" and the mother of all the ""trapped in space with a pissed off extra-terrestrial"" flick, ""Alien"".

""Final Fantasy"" takes the science fiction animated movie and places it in class so amazing that it's hard to believe you're watching animation at all.  My students tell me this was a video game first which would help my understanding of the plot; that may well be, and with me being ""video game challenged"", I can vouch for that.  But, as an art teacher, I can say that the way in which this movie was put together is truly something to see.  Visually, it is stunning, with the CGI images so realistically rendered, that you can see each hair on the characters heads, faces and bodies, not mention how the hair on the female characters swishes so beautifully as they move their heads.  I found myself thinking ""hmmm...I wonder who does her hair?""

Specific physical characteristics aside, the movements of the characters also defy animated logic.  While a tad stiff (which may have been done on purpose, since it is a fusion movie of anime', typically stiff anyway, animation, and other techniques), the movie has a flow that overides any ""pixelated"" movement problems.  I mean afterall, if you wanted to see that much realism, why not just see a movie with live humans in it?  Eventually you forget that the characters are animated, and lending the very distinctive voices of such eloquent actors as Donald Sutherland, Alec Baldwin, Ving Rhames and Michael Ironsides to the mix doesn't hurt either.

The story, like the coloring is dark, gritty and a bit confusing (again, those of you who played the video game have a distinct advantage over the rest of us cretins who have no idea what the core of the storyline is really about). The use of space and inter-gallatic war as a backdrop is just stock material, but done well, giving you a familiar point of departure to hang the rest of the story on.

The characters are pretty generic; you've got the honery hero (Alec Baldwin), the kindly old scientist/ doctor (Donald Sutherland), the evil-doer (Michael Ironsides), the good ole boy sidekick (Ving Rhames), and the lovely female protaganist, a newcomer, whose name escapes me at the minute.  She, however has a secret; she has some connection with these spirit aliens that have the power to take over human bodies and/ or suck-up their spirit energy or something like that...I told you it's confusing.

All in all, it's a pretty cool movie for it's genre and one which almost anyone from ages 12 and up can watch and enjoy.",1178928000,,2864,4.78498985801217
1320170,5,B00003CY5C,"I would rank this movie as one of my favorite. It's a shame it has not been given the credit it deserves.  The story itself is a breath of fresh air from all the other Sci-Fi movies that assumes that people do not have a spiritual belief in everyday life.  This movie dares to explore that part of us that most people in this world believe. The fact that so many movies in the US avoid this topic is more of a matter of political eliteness than what people really do and enjoy. I noticed that one comment even dared to say that the movie did not do too well was because it contained spiritual aspects.  That analogy couldn't be furtherest from the truth.

I remember when the movie was advertised.  It was one of the worst advertising I have ever seen for a great movie. Sony may have spent a lot of money but they wasted it.  Whenever I show this movie to people (and I have shown it to quite a few), they all really enjoyed it and were impressed by it. Many of them had not even heard of it (due to bad advertising).

This movie is a great classic. It was unfortunate that it was not presented or advertised correctly. Someone should definitely create a sequel to it.

By the way, a great movie does not need to be made from a video game.

On the contrary, a video game based on this movie would be excellent.

Rent the movie and watch it with friends and you'll see that it is better than most of the movies you have probably watched and you will most certainly will want to buy it. I won't say it will be the best but it does rank up there in the top which is why I give it five Stars - *****",1176854400,,1596,4.086538461538462
1320171,5,B00003CY5C,"""Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within"" is a computer animated feature, which I remember got a fair bit of hype about the way it was made. I liked it, but not so much for the animation really.

It's 2065 AD and the world is at war with a variety of creatures known as ""phantoms"", who both kill and infect people with themselves. Dr Aki has been infected, but her associate Dr Cid has it under control, using a method that might free the Earth from the phantom invasion. Since the infection, Dr Aki is haunted by strange dreams, which she struggles to find a meaning to. Will she figure out what they mean? Will the struggle against the phantoms soon be put to rest?

My brothers are big fans of the Final Fantasy series, so I've seen a bit of the video game this film takes its name from. Doesn't seem to be that much of connection, but I wasn't really thinking about that when I was watching it, more on the story, which is fairly entertaining piece of sci-fi. I wasn't thinking much about the effects either, though I do like the animation of the more transparent phantoms, like the dragon sort of ones the fly about.

There's quite a few special features in the special edition: an audio commentary from the Japanese crew, an audio commentary from the English crew, a commentary/music only track from the composer, original theatrical trailers, cg ""outtakes"", a couple of making of featurettes, and a few other things.

Worth a look for fans of sci-fi and computer animation.",1163116800,,1474,4.571969696969697
1320172,5,B00003CY5C,"I must admit I was really impressed with the CG in this movie. It seems great computer animation is steadily progressing. From Toy Story to War Planets then to Roughnecks:Chronicles of Starship Troopers, Final Fantasy takes the next evolutionary step. The lighting and level of detail in the animation is flawless. The humans are the most convincing you will find in a CG movie. There were 'actors' in some scenes were completely indiscernable from a real human being. I bet that if someone 20 years ago saw this movie they would wonder why the actors look so strange. It's that good.

I think one of the limitations of the movie is the strong metaphysical elements in the plot, which doesn't show its head much in American mainstream but is a lot more popular in Japan. The story in of itself is common fare in that aspect, and some people might find it canned. The technology portrayed in this movie is enough to get any sci-fi technie to drool. Holographic control surfaces, aerospace transports, domed cities, big guns, bigger guns!

The characters really flesh out the story. The voice actors did a great job all around. It's a real credit to their talents when you can connect with computer generated characters like you would with good actors. Some critics complain about the 'acting' being flat and not expressive. In a fair amount of scenes they are right, but I will marginally side with the animators on this one. When you start rendering the larger, more defined expressions that an actor would make, those real looking CG faces start lose a lot of what makes them look so real. The biggest failing point on that front is they didn't just go to real actors as models for the facial expressions. The CG artists depended on their own facial expressions, and since they aren't actors we end up with what I consider expressions that are way too subtle for film.

Sid, the human villian type, really annoyed me. James Woods did a great job bringing him to life, but the guy was just written so one dimensional. Plus he thwarts the heroes efforts to save the world one too many times for my taste. I mean really!! How many times are we supposed to sit and see the good guys just seconds away from victory only to have Sid screw it up by doing something stupid?!? I felt like pulling my hair. But I digress.

If you are going to get a DVD of this movie the Special Edition is the only way to go. For those of you into how CG movies are made there is so much information that it will make your head spin. For those who aren't so much into that you get some good featurettes too. There is even an outtakes featurette, which consists mostly of the animators goofing around with test footage, but it's fun to watch. Also you get an easter egg with our heroin, Aki Ross, playing Michael Jackson to a host of monsters reinacting the Thriller dance routine.

Final Fantasy is a really good movie. Impressive animation, memorable characters, unique alien menace, and all around style gives this movie a strong recommendation to those science fiction tech heads out there as well as people who want a unique movie experience. Just keep in mind the ""acting"" doesn't compare to other CG acting like Andy Serkis' Gollum in the Lord of the Rings movies, and the plot itself is not very engaging. Still with these flaws Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within is a very worthy addition to any sci-fi or CG fan's collection.",1158278400,3,3408,4.598684210526316
1320173,4,B00003CY5C,"One thing that I rarely find with a game from Square is a bad story. Sure Final Fantasy VIII had its detractors but the story was quite intriguing and under that terrible translation was a really interesting story in Final Fantasy Tactics. But these and others took a long time to develop, little nuances and development over the course of a good 30-40 hours. Well Spirits Within clocks in at around an hour 40 and while the story is kind of interesting, there was a lot of missed opportunities here.

It's 2065 and mankind is nearing extinction. A meteor crashed on Earth, bringing with it strange creatures named Phantoms. Scientist Aki Ross and her mentor Dr. Sid try to collect 8 special spirit waves which will actually defeat the phantoms. However, there is some problems as a General Hein is hellbent on destroying the Phantoms, even if it means the planet in the process.

Another thing you'll always find in Square games is their knack for sweet FMV's or cutscenes. Ever since Final Fantasy VII introduced them to the series, they've gotten better and better at making really amazing scenes come to life(such as Galbadia vs Balamb Garden in VIII, the Black Waltz chase in IX, practically any FMV in X). The animation here is quite stellar, and although I noticed some faults, such as some odd looking artifacting on Hein's coat, this is quite something. It's not entirely perfect as character expressions still look kind of robotic and characters look kinda creepy, especially the eyes.

How's the rest of the film? It's kind of meh. While the story has a good premise, it's marred by bad dialogue and a certain detached feeling. I never really cared about the people's spirits getting munched, I was just like ""wow, that looks cool!"". And I can't count how many versions of ""let's get out of here"" I found, then there's the ""city is lost"" line and countless others. Now maybe it's just my background in anime and games but the story isn't confusing and convoluted, in fact I could understand it perfectly so all that talk about it is really people who probably prefer Armageddon-type plots. Oh wait, that didn't have one either.

This is clearly a 50/50 film where half of you will love it and find it underrated, others will find the poor box office was a reflection on the movie. Whatever the case, it at least warrants a watch, just a more open minded one.",1155254400,2,2369,4.6875

I can not say that about this Final Fantasy Movie. It has a great story, was well done and is for everybody who enjoys great entertainment regardless of the genre (Sci-Fi in this case).

The Animations are breathtaking. I forgot from time to time that you look at an animated movie all together. The animations look so real from time to time that you think that you are watching a live action movie.

Too bad that the movie did not so well at the box office, but it got rewarded with huge DVD sales afterwards, when people discovered the movie. I bet that the movie would have been a Box Office hit as well, if they would have market it properly. I am a FF Fan and didn't even realize that they created a movie long after the fact.

I am certain that you will not regret buying this movie. If you are uncertain (like I was), rent it first and buy it if you enjoy it (like I did).",1153699200,,1045,4.1330049261083746

The biggest complaint people have is that the movie isn't ""Final Fantasy"", this is of course coming from those people that love the RPG games and think anything attached to the ""Final Fantasy"" title has to have ""swords and potions"".

The dialouge was filled with one liners, wasted several talented actors like Donald Sutherland. The drama seemed artificial, and the story was just bad. What I did like about this movie is that it showed that adult-oriented computer animated productions are possible instead of the childrens movies by Pixar (Monsters Inc....which was actually FAR BETTER than this)

1320239,1,B00003CY5C,"""A special effect without a story behind it is a pretty boring thing."" --George Lucas

Case in point, Final Fantasy - The Spirits Within.

It begins as so many Hollywood sci-fi movies do: with the success of a video game. Then a flimsy movie plot is formed in the way so many Hollywood sci-fi plots are: from a gross misinterpretation of a sceintific concept, in this case, the Gaia theory. From there, we the audience should expect nothing more or less than a mindless mess of brain-candy. To our surprise, this time, what do we get? A lot of bad drama, performed by computer animated people. Wha? Where did we go wrong?

Seeing real people do bad acting is hard enough, but it's worse when a team of CGI animators try to get you to take their art seriously by creating CGI soap-opera.

This film was marketed as the cutting edge of CGI, promising to dazzle everyone with the level of realism achieved. The trailers wowed us with animations that looked, wow! Like real people!

But this begs the question: So what? Who needs animated people that do the same things real people do? The characters in this movie aren't flying around like Superman, aren't dodging bullets like Neo in ""The Matrix,"" and aren't amputees like Captain Dan in ""Forrest Gump."" They are just behaving like regular old bad actors in an insufferably bad B-movie. CGI has apparently gotten a little too real. We get more than enough bad drama from real actors already.

Of all the reasons I can think of to use CGI actors instead of real ones (budget considerations, convenience of not having to worry about human problems like acne, illness, death of actors), none of them have anything to do with why I, as an audience member, should want to sacrifice my time and money to sit through what the filmmakers are selling.

Sure, the CGI effects are impressive. But are impressive special effects enough to hold me for two hours?

No. Ten or twenty minutes, maybe. A half-hour if the effects are reeeally dazzling. And that's an important point. When I go to a fireworks display or a laser show, I expect a mind-blowing array of light and sound. Maybe Final Fantasy would have been more entertaining if the creators had tried a little harder to give a good light show as opposed to a serious drama. By trying to have it both ways, they wound up with a mediocre effects show and a dull story. Why? To try to give computer animation an air of legitimacy? Who knows? And ultimately, who cares? Bad drama is bad drama, and it's even worse when it's CGI bad drama.

CGI is useful for aiding a story. If the story sucks, all the CGI in the universe is not going to change that. A special effect without a story really is a very, very boring thing.",1143072000,3,2709,4.534836065573771

The animation is amazing, and the soundtrack is worth a listen as well. If your intrested in the Gaia Theory, this is a good take on it, but a form of the Gaia Theory that takes its creator's intentions to the extreme.

Even today, some of the graphics in the movie are quite amazing and certain characters look very life-like.  Although, you are easily taken out of the world of the movie when you look at the other, not even close to realistic characters.  The most disappointing is the main character herself who seems to have pasty hair and plastic skin.  In addition, there's only so much the graphics can do since the story of the movie is based on phantoms and such and takes place in the distant future.

The story itself is very average.  Though better than your basic plot, it is still quite pratictable and does feel very much like a video game at times.

Though Aki's hair looked incredibly stiff and unrealistic to me...

But hows the story?

Great!

I wasn't 'confused' with the plot and story like so many others seemed to be. It was a somewhat generic and cliched plot of invading aliens which need to be stopped, but it worked remarkably well.

I also found the movie to be funny, the action to be entertaining, and the characters to be likeable.

I loved Woods as the evil general and i loved Buscemis character. I really connected with most of the characters and i felt for them when some of them met an early demise...

As the movie progresses you find out about these aparations and what must be done to eliminate them.

Final Fantasy - The Spirits Within is a wonderful story of a young woman named Aki who is destined to save the world, and herself, from a long-dead world that has ""invaded"" Earth. She, along with her scientist mentor and a group of ragtag soldiers, search the globe for the last two pieces of an eight piece puzzle - the puzzle to complete and match a spirit wave pattern that will free the phantoms (the invaders) from their torment on Earth.

Throughout the movie, the observer can see both betrayal of the lowest morality, and loyalty of the highest quality, portrayed in the (admittedly somewhat steriotyped) major characters of the film. The film shows all the aspects of humanity that are so important not to lose track of in humanity's misguided quest for money and power.

In the end, Final Fantasy - The Spirits Within was a very cerebral movie that may have lost in the box office just because of that point - too many people went to see a Final Fantasy movie, not a movie that would make them think.",1127433600,,1219,4.506787330316742

When you watch Dr. Aki Ross speak to General Grey about a little girl that was dying, you will notice that she mentions about returning to the earth. In other words, like in the game Final Fantasy VII, when Aeris died, she returned to the planet. This is just an example.

I saw this movie when it hit movie theaters on July 11th, 2001. I got hooked onto this movie. It was a fantastic movie. For those of you who have debated about picking this up, from one FF fan to another, you will NOT be disapointed. This movie is well worth it.",1122508800,4,638,4.145161290322581

1320329,4,B00003CY5C,"I watched this movie again after several years, and still found it delightful, even awesome, despite animation having moved on as far as the recent The Incredibles.

The plot is surprisingly intricate at the character and emotional level, as well as the sci-fi level.

The heroes need to save the world, and seek to do so non-violently through ""science"" that identifies ""spirits"" and gaia.  In contrast, the villain, consumed by hate, can only focus on violence.

The story is sombre (given the subject matter, of earth at risk of destruction), yet never depressing--you would call this serious sci-fi.

There is probably less than 3% of scenes or dialogue that you won't like, which is a very good result compared to most movies.

Some of the sci-fi aspects aren't entirely logical (but then neither is Star Wars), but if you can avoid letting that bother you, you'll be able to enjoy the overall feeling better.

Still today, the artistic and technical achievements of this film  are a joy to watch.  You keep staring in amazement at the main characters, impressed at how ""human"" (lifelike) they are.

This film didn't do well at the box office, so there may not be another like it for quite some time.  Perhaps it was too complex, too different, too ""fantastic"" (some non-logical aspects), or too Japanese for the mass market that would prefer to see Hollywood blockbusters.  None of that bothered me. I liked it then, and still do now.",1113091200,,1439,4.828571428571428

For those of you who do not understand let me explain, First of all it shared some similar themes with ff7, you know with the fact that the whole earth is alive; thus it is a final fantasy. Second it gave you an unbelievable world full of surreal thoughts and dreams; thus it is a final fantasy. And third just because it doesn't have a roman numeral doesn't mean it's not a final fantasy; thus it's final fantasy.
  A lot of people seemed to have something against the story, which I think I know why, It's the gaia thing isn't it? you could get The Force, but you can't grasp the fact that the earths alive. Ok bottem line: if you like great adventures and new worlds by almeans buy this, but if you never liked new ideas nor seemed intrested in imaganitive things then steer clear.

1320415,3,B00003CY5C,"Being one of those that played every Final Fantasy game that I could get my hands on, I constantly debated on how I should describe the movie and it's use of the Final Fantasy name. And I concluded that this movie, name and all, is not a true Final Fantasy movie. I state this because of the fact Squaresoft had a history of doing the ""let's call this Final Fantasy"" game, especially when they were working with Nintendo of America.

Mind you, that in my own opinion, this is more of a ""Final Fantasy presents"" kind of feature. I also believe that if they introcuded it as such, the movie would be given a better rating by myself, and be considered a better movie by most other fans of  the franchise. Because they have a visually beautiful movie that has nothing to do with the Final Fantasy mythos, yet have not learned that they should have just made it a ""Final Fantasy presents"" feature.

So if you want Final Fantasy, then I recommend Legend of the Crystal (which is only on VHS) and Final Fantasy: Unlimited. Both are either copyrighted by Squaresoft or Square Enix (Spirit Within is not), and both contain the same Final Fantasy mythos that will keep you interested until, that is, Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children comes out. Because this is not one of those series, and is only worth watching if you want to see how visually beautiful it is, or have not seen any movies that has this movie's kind of plot.",1107388800,2,1416,4.48062015503876

I find that Squaresoft should have stick with the original stories of the games. If the games are huge success since the 1st one, they should have stick with the same idea. The 1st Final Fantasy movie should have been on the 1st game.
The whole CG animation was well done, but the story didn't attracted the people. It should have been set in a medieval fantasy instead of in an Earth's future.
Now, the new management at Square Enix understand the public and will release a movie sequel to Final Fantasy VII's game on DVD: Final Fantasy VII Advent Children. It has been a huge success released in ultra tight selected theatres.",1105488000,,734,4.7421875

""The spirits within"" is an incredible movie that is amongst my top favirite movies of all times.  It has one of the coolest stories about finding hope and survival in a world where all hope has been lost.

The best part of the movie is the animation instead of putting real people into a world the would be nearly all CGI they made it all CGI thus making the movie feel like the movie is more realistic.

If you can look beyond the fact the the name has final fantasy in it you will find a really great and well made movie.  If you can't, well I feel bad that you need a title to make the movie what it is.",1101945600,2,872,3.9770114942528734

But I personally think the main flaw of the movie are the enemy that the characters are fighting in the whole movie that really turn me down, the slimy monster at the end envey no real threat at all to the audience, I guess that the expectation level of monsters people looking for on big screen and video games are just different. I mean when you think about those monsters in the movie, if they are simply spirit energy from the monsters were dead in the past, they have no real physical body so why shoot at it?? compare that to the other blockbusters in the same summer like jurassic park 3 and tomb raider 1, those dinosaur actually eat people's gut out those are real monsters, not some slimy balls that touch you and you die, people like physical contact.

Animation is absolutely fantastic but I feel the producers and director should have focused a bit more on the storyline and characters. Animation is not what makes a movie great. Why the five stars then? Because the flaws aren't significant enough for me to stop me from considering this movie a cornerstone in cinematography. Everything you see, hear and experience is done from scratch using technology.",1095033600,4,532,4.98876404494382
1320421,3,B00003CY5C,"Final Fantasy is a landmark achievement in comptuer graphics. When it appeared it was unique as a feature-length movie. It demonstrated natural motion, not just walking and standing, hair, fabric, explosions, rich backgrounds, and naturalistic physics in an incredible tour de force.

If I must pick few nits, the animators didn't quite capture skin's subtlety. Skin interacts with light in layers, not just at the surface, and these characters tended towards a waxy look. Also, despite the characters' rich ranges of motion, a few things are conspicuous by their absence. Running, jumping more than a foot or two, fighting or embracing, and all extremes are just missing. They're too hard. Body masses change shape under muscle tension, when bouncing, and when in forceful contact - if the animators could not do these complex jobs properly, they chose not to do them at all. I respect that decision, and look forward to more complex body models in the future. Cloth, too, was a weak point. Dr. Sid's tunic, General Hein's trenchcoat, and (in the extras) Aki's skirt all have the same drape, and not a very interesting one at that. Well, cloth is hard to model, and I look forward to better cloth models, too.

That's about it, though. The plot is worn, and the 'scientific' premise never quite hangs together for me. The characters tend to be one-dimensional. It's an interesting comparison to ""Tokyo Godfathers."" That presents realistic characters, but revels in its nonrealistic imagery.

This movie is all about its imagery and technical achievement. Those are wonderful. They define the industry's state of the art as of the movie's debut, and even now, a few years later. Technology moves forward, though. A movie needs more to have lasting value, but this doesn't offer a lot more.

The writers dusted off the traditional conflict between magic and technology, but did not add a new wrinkle to a conflict that was the driving force behind  the famed FFIII (American).

The CG was gorgeous, but it still could not make up for characters that were often more caricatures. The driven scientist, protective love-interest, and the obsessed general weren't really developed beyond their general concepts.

The high frame rate animation also could not overcome the uninspired direction. The ""camera angles"" and pacing of the story were mediocre at best.

Though there were some name brand voice actors involved (Alec Baldwin and Ming Na), I felt that their skills were stymied by the flat dialogue.

I was tempted to give it one star, since I usually judge high budget movies ($130+ Million US) more harshly than shoestring efforts, but compared to my other tastes I would say that it's a rental at best.

This animated feature-length film which borrows heavily from the ""Aliens"" series is a complex but accessible sci-fi story starring Dr. Aki Ross and her Deep Eyes military companions, one of whom is her lover, who are attempting to rid the world of aliens without destroying the earth's Gaiasphere or life force, which might be destroyed by using the belligerent Dr. Hein's destructive space cannon. The aliens can infect humans,including Dr. Ross, and her mentor Dr. Sid must find the 8 spirits that reside in various life forms to complete the cure and expel the alien from Dr. Ross. As has been mentioned numerous times, this film is the first to animate humans using computer technology. All aspects of the environment including the shields which guard the largely wasted cities, the aliens themselves, which come in widely diverse forms including foot soldiers and big diaphanous flying things, the military vehicles and spacecraft borrow from the film series ""Aliens"" and the sound of the film is also quite noteworthy.

1320506,5,B00003CY5C,"One of the best computer generated films I have ever seen.  Final Fantasy - the Spirits Within was a joy to watch.

It was exciting, funny, poignant, exciting, romantic, joyful, future hopeful and totally mesmerising from start to finish.

With great actors voicing the animated heroes, we are treated to a state of the art adventure in which earth has been decimated by alien phantoms and the only hope for the survival of the human race are eight earth bound energy-spirits that can stop what only be described as Armageddon.

The exquisite Dr Aki Ross along with cynical but mostly good hearted Captain Edwards and his band of disparate marines set out to find these spirits before the megalomaniac General Hein can ruin any chance Earth has for survival.

The graphics are absolutely stunning, the animated characters look so life like you find yourself doing a double take all the time.  Aki Ross is especially life like and Captain Edwards positively smoulders on screen but then his character is voiced over by the sexy Alec Baldwin who can still make any red blood female go weak at the knees!

The ending is superb as well as being heart breaking; no one can forget the scene when Captain Edwards lays down his life for the woman he loves and not just to save the world.  Romance at its best in my opinion, animated or not!

I also just love the combining of philosophy, nature, science and technology together and the musical score gets a ten out of ten too.

I wish I could have seen this film on the big screen but I only got to see it when it came out on DVD.

1320509,5,B00003CY5C,"This film is one of the best I have ever seen. Put simply, it is a work of genius. There have been a number of bad reviews about this film and it lost almost $60m at the box office (nevertheless, it still grossed a fairly respectable $45m). When I saw the DVD I couldn't understand why the film lost money at all.
The main prejudices against this film seem to be that it carries the ""Final Fantasy"" title. Excited fans of the gaming series were seriously dissapointed because this film has absolutely nothing to do with any of the games and is in a completly different style to them. This isn't surprising, because the games are incredibly complex and their stories would eat up hours of screen time. Fans of the game just did not have the foresight to enjoy it as a seperate movie. I had not played the games upon viewing and so could afford to be more impartial.
The rendered characters are incredible; for computer geeks it's worth buying the DVD to see Dr. Aki Ross's (the main character) hair blowing in the wind.
The storyline is as deep as you want it to be- it works on many levels, ultimately dealing with spirituality/life and death issues. On the other hand, it can be enjoyed solely as an action movie. Another great feature is the music, which is some of the best work I have heard- particularly the end credits/love scene piece ""The Dream Within"".
There is not a great deal of character development, and this upset critics. Nevertheless, there is still feeling and the viewer does get attached to most of the characters.
You simply HAVE to watch this film once. It really is nothing like anything that has gone before it. Although it has not proven to be the end of human actors as predicted, it has definately paved the way for other CGI (computer generated) films and has set the standard. Even if you are not interested in the spiritualist plot, you can simply be entertained by the action and humourous banter between the two army comrades, Neil and Jane.
Overall, this film is excellent. It was a real shame that it did not perform well at the box office, but in future years it will probably be looked back upon with respect and as a classic, it is such a trendsetter.
The DVD has some great features which help buff the storyline up a bit. I would definately reccomended this to all.",1087862400,3,2304,4.501193317422435

However, the film is extremely cold with regards to emotional connection with the characters.  While the creatures and ships and battle-gear were all pristinely drawn, the expressions and walk of the human characters are stiff and mostly emotionless.  This makes for more of a cerebral experience along the lines of hard sci-fi rather than sci-fi fantasy.  The overall feel of the film is icy and soulless, but the animation is truly exceptional.  What saves this film from being completely frozen is one of the most underrated scores of the year composed by Elliot Goldenthal.  I own the CD to the soundtrack and I often play it while reading something creepy.  It enhances the movie with subtlety and provides much-needed lift to many of the otherwise spiritless sequences.  The song ""The Dream Within"" sung by Lara Fabian was also written by Elliot Goldenthal and is remarkable, especially with Lara Fabian's glorious voice soaring over the music.

1320618,3,B00003CY5C,"From the beginning, this movie seemed to have a lot of potential. The plot started out pretty intriguing, and I wanted very much to learn more about these alien creatures. However, by the end, it had basically resorted to a mix of horrible generic character stereotypes and gross negligence toward the laws of physics. On the ""bad character stereotypes"" end, there's the scientist that no one else believes, and in the end we find out he's right; there's the military commando guy who wants to nuke everything and refuses to listen to anyone else's opinion, and who lets the bad guys kill lots of innocent humans just to make himself seem important; there's the love interest whose attempts to save the lead female's life are met with an arrogant ""stop trying to protect me, I can take care of myself!"" attitude, even though the lead female would be dead at this point if not for his intervention. Etc., etc., etc. The pale crazy guy from Armageddon and Con Air lends his voice to a role that's pretty much identical to his roles from those movies (not that this is a bad thing, mind you). I don't think there's one original character idea in this whole cast. On the ""writers obviously never went to Science class"" end, there's this whole ""earth spirit versus alien planet spirit"" bullcrap routine that you'd have to be on LSD to believe is even remotely possible without changing half of the known laws of physics.
There is some good in this movie, however. The steady stream of increasingly bizarre and absurd revelations about the ghosts is quite entertaining, and the line about ""negotiating with extreme prejudice"" is alone worth whatever nausea you may or may not have felt during the rest of the movie. The character interaction and development isn't really bad per se, just lacking in the uniqueness area.
Overall, it's not The English Patient, but then, it's not Swordfish either. I don't feel like I've wasted two hours of my life in watching this movie - actually, I'm probably better off having seen it, not because it made me a better person or anything, but because I got to see something really wierd and different, which is part of the whole point of art (which movies count as) in the first place. Also, it made me readjust my standards for which sci-fi premises are too much to swallow and which ones are not, thus letting me have a greater appreciation for stuff like The Fifth Element.",1072828800,,2405,4.701421800947867

For the first time in cinema, human beings are recreated through the use of CG animation, and done to a point where it is sometimes difficult to differentiate between animation and reality.  I found myself, at times, accepting that what I saw was real.  The attention to detail was unbelievable-hair, eyes, clothing, skin-its unbelievable.
Its worth the time from the standpoint of seeing where the industry is at with animation, but if you are looking for a good, gripping story, look elsewhere....because you won't find it in ""The Spirits Within"".",1063152000,,987,5.03680981595092

With that said, I can go on and say that this film blew my mind. On the first viewing it was the CGI that did it for me. I have some experience in this area, and was amazed at the realism acheived, particularly with Dr Sid, who at times, is so realistic it's almost creepy.
Since I was so distracted by the technical accomplishments of the film the first time, I was forced to watch it a second time, during which I was able to fully appreciate the story itself. It's got everything you could want; Action, mystery, romance, and a real sense of philosophy.
The film doesn't, like so many games conversions, insult the intelligence either. You are led through the story in a competent and compelling manner, and eventually, everything that seemed so confusing at the start is explained, and the plot slots neatly together in time for the final showdown.
This is certainly a film I'll come back to often.",1061078400,2,1162,4.460093896713615
1320697,5,B00003CY5C,"Wow!  The film was beautifully executed, both in terms of story and visuals.  I have NEVER seen such hauntingly realistic CGI in my life (especially an entire movie composed solely of it).  I am a freelance digital animator/visual effects artist, and as I have read some reviews, NOBODY can fully appreciate this film's mathematical precision on screen unless they have done this type of work themselves.  Hair follicle and procedural texture simulations, along with precise lighting and specularity, had me fooled many times that DR. Sid, and others, were real actors.  Probably the one scene which caused chills to run down my spine (which is EXTREMELY rare for any CGI artist because he knows the truth behind the visuals and is usually never fooled) was the scene right when Aki and the Captain look into each others eyes after hugging each other (in zero-g in Aki's spaceship).  I was speechless.
I did, however, pickup on some slight CGI ""inaccuracies.""  Some lipsynching was different than the dubbed dialogue (excusable, mind you that over 1,000,000 facial expression can be made by the face, and creating all of the morph targets for thoses expressions would reach the ""infinite"" realm).  Some walking cycles for Aki were a bit mechanical, but I really don't care.  Aki's walking isn't meant to grab one's attention.  Hence, it's not very critical.",1059264000,2,1357,5.044843049327354

1320701,5,B00003CY5C,"For most critics, Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within was a technical success but little else.  As these same critics have had neither the degree of exposure to the epic storylines of anime nor the Final Fantasy series of games that the indended audience did, their reaction was somewhat to be expected but entirely off the mark.
Set in a near future on our own earth, the dystopian world of Final Fantasy is the result of an asteroid impact--but entirely unlike the scenarios of films like Armageddon or Deep Impact.  Instead, said asteroid carried with it invisible alien entities called ""Phantoms"" whose very touch is lethal to all life.
The last holdouts of humanity must find a way to defeat the Phantoms without sacrificing the earth itself.  This is where the film likely lost most critics unfamiliar with the Gaia concept of a living earth, though most fans of the game series should be well inured to the idea.  For those familiar with the plots of anime and Japanese mythic video games, the film is quite fulfilling and entertaining.
The film's visuals are indeed stunning, featuring ultra-realistic computer animation that makes every other CG film look like poorly-drawn cartoons.  The voice cast, too, is of superior caliber, from Donald Sutherland to Alec Baldwin.  Steve Buschemi's acting may leave some audience members groaning--but that certainly didn't seem to affect fans of any of his other films!
The DVD includes a number of outstanding special features, from a series of additional audio tracks that range from an isolated score and commentary by the composer to directors' and even Japanese production staff.  Various proofing tests of the ultra-realistic animation are included, from a music video set to Michael Jackson's Thriller to models and wireframes.  The DVD-ROM includes the screenplay and much more as well.  This is one of the few DVD's that I have actually explored every single special feature--and the makers of the discs certainly don't think ""menus"" and ""scene selection"" are special features like so many DVD authors today.
One could only ask that Nobuo Uematsu had done the score--yet Elliot Goldenthal delivers with a superb soundtrack accentuated by vocal tracks by Laura Fabian and Japanese pop group L'Arc en Ciel.
Overall, I am exceptionally pleased by the result of this film and its DVD transfer.  Give the movie a try if you enjoy Final Fantasy games, anime, or simply want to experience the most realistic computer animation ever made as a full-length picture.",1050364800,5,2511,5.072815533980583
1320702,4,B00003CY5C,"Just a couple years ago, it was said that with the new computer effects, it would be possible to, for example, have a computer-digital Bruce Lee appear in a film (even though the actor died years ago) and look so realistic, you almost could not tell the difference.  Well, the future is here!  A CGI film has created a film totally by computer and the people do look realistic, you swear sometimes the people are actually human.  They claim no photographs or scanners were used. With all due respect to Disney, this CGI film even supasses Walt Disney Productions.  The plot really isn't that meaty and I felt no emotion towards the end.  But I was surprised that the voices were of Alec Baldwin, Donald Sutherland, James Woods and Jean Simmons.

Final Fantasy: the Spirits Within has some interesting concepts, but they are better explored in other films. However, it is stunning to watch, but this doesn't make up for obvious deficiencies.

1320790,4,B00003CY5C,"I was very impressed with this movie.  It coming on the heels of having seen the Matrix: The Osiris thing with Dreamcatcher in theaters.  There were of course technical/graphic image things that were similar to the advanced displays of the Matrix short, made years later.
But this actually went into having a plot and humanization (if such a word exists).  The main deficit to this form of design seems to be the effort to make younger people appear perfect.  Dr. Sid tends to look the best because he has wrinkles and frown lines.  Thats mainly my visual critique.  Its apparent that this computer rendering is much cheaper than physically trying to create these images and can be done on a much grander scale.
The plot, was pretty good too.  Though I still don't get the Spirit Hunt----that part of the metaphysical science is left a little vague.  And the fact that their hypothesis is doubted, is honestly right.  How the spirits of some animals and vegetation on Earth are special versuses saythose of other living people is not fully answered so that this group of people can risk their lives.  The concept of teh Phantoms being a cosmic accident and not an invasion was original but I thought it a little slow that no on eelse thought of them as ghosts beforehand.  What I'm mainly saying is that a lot of these plot points took a back stage to the computer elements and most importantly there being a sense that more than a handful of people on the entire planet had the ability to think.  That made the overall plot a little simplistic to me but I still enjoyed it.",1049068800,2,1574,4.582142857142857
1320791,4,B00003CY5C,"My perspective on this film is that of someone who has never played any of the video games, so I came to it prepared for a sci-fi film, and nothing more. The plot concerns a future where ""phantoms"" have decimated the earth, making it uninhabitable except to humans living inside shielded cities. A scientist, Dr. Aki Ross, and her mentor Dr. Sid, have developed an energy-based theory of how to rid the world of the phantoms. The ruling government wants to see hard facts, though, and so Aki and Sid must gather life-forms to put together a wave that will cancel out the wavelength of the phantoms' energy. Or something like that. What follows is a surreal, psychdelic journey to destroy the transparent phantom spirits and find the heart of the phantom planet's Gaia.
""Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within"" is a treat to watch. The landscapes are stunning, imaginative, and visionary, while still looking recognizable enough that one of your dreams might happen in them. The computer-generated people are slightly lacking, but they are still amazingly lifelike. The main problem I had with watching the people is that their movements are too fluid and regular. Watching the characters move is like watching a film composed of live actors who have all had thirty years of ballet training. But the movements of hair and the size of skin pores have obviously been well thought out, and the result is gorgeous to see.
That said, maybe your eyes will be too busy with this one for your brain to pay attention to the quasi-new-age speeches some characters give. A live actor might have been embarrassed by a line such as, ""With the hope of new life has Gaia changed the phantom within."" Fortunately, the computer-generated Aki can deliver that line sincerely and earnestly, perhaps putting off some who might otherwise snicker at such ideas. The Steve Buscemi-voiced Neil has some humorous lines, but he is obviously meant to be comic relief in a film whose main concern is themes of Cosmic Significance. The script does a rather tired, cliched job of expressing those themes, however. But that's not really the point of a film like this; it was obviously made to be looked at more than analyzed, and on that level it succeeds fully. This would make a great film for lightly altered states of mind, though perhaps some of the darker imagery would be too intense for very strong intoxicants ;) !
Notes re the DVD version: Watching the ""Boards and Blasts"" version of the film with the ""subtitled factoids"" on is pretty interesting. It really shows how much work went into making these characters, as you can see how rough they looked at some points in the animation process. However, at times the factoids are going so fast that you have to rewind to be able to read them all. The info about the characters provided on the second disc, such as all of their astrological signs, is intriguing if you get really into the world of the movie and want to know more. I recommend going to dvdeastereggs.com and looking up this movie, as there are ways to access a spoof of the ""Thriller"" video featuring the characters, pictures of Aki in a bikini, and more.",1047600000,,3140,4.742230347349177

1320895,2,B00003CY5C,"In the latter half of the 21st century, Earth has been devestated by an attack of mysterious invaders called ""Phantoms"".  Insubstantial - they can appear out of walls - the Phantoms yank the spirits of human beings out of their mortal husks, I guess to consume them.  Brought to Earth years earlier by a meteor that landed in the Caspian, the Phantoms all but entirely rule the earth, forcing the remnants of humanity into shielded ""Barrier Cities"".  Phantoms come in all shapes or sizes - whether the size of microbes or mountains, yet all having the same basic effect.  With only one chance to make the right decision, the remnants of humanity are caught between two competing strategies for defeating the Phantoms - a military plan advanced by the severe General Hein (voiced by James Woods) involving a huge orbiting space cannon; and the more new-age concept advanced by the sage Dr. Sid (Donald Sutherland) involving using the bio waves of living creatures or (as he describes them in private, far from the skeptical and desperate ears of Humanity's remaining leadership) ""spirits"".  Key to the plan is the retrieval of life forms possessing the needed wave by Dr. Aki Ross, a beautiful scientist who is also dying of exposure to microscopic phantoms.  Reluctantly helping her is a squad of armored soldiers led by Captain Gray (Alec Baldwin), one of Aki's old flames.  Aki has already located 5 of the spirits (actually 6, but that's something for the script to explain), and somehow has determined that she need only locate 3 more.  For Aki, it's a race against time - against the Phantoms which are winning their war against both Earth and Aki, and also against Hein who is closing on his goal of convincing the council to green-light an orbital attack that may destroy the Phantoms and the Earth.
And I still couldn't get into this flick.  For a premise that wasn't entirely original (hunky marines with guns against hordes of aliens, and a dream sequence of aliens locked in mortal combat on their home world that looks like it was lifted out of ""Quatermass and the Pit""), the script leaves a lot of explaining to do - why are the insubstantial phantoms vulnerable to tangible weapons?;  The council all but summarily dismisses Dr. Sid's theories involving Gaia, the spirit of mother earth, though it's also clear that Ross and Sid have been doing their work and have reaped results for some time, which is more than the militaristic Hein can say;  Phantoms can essentially pass through anything, so why do Gray's troops gear up in heavy body armor?;  Sid cautions Aki to keep all mention of ""spirits"" to herself, yet both of them will use the term openly.  Aki's theories about the true nature of the phantoms make for both an unsatisfying explanation and a cryptic resolution.  It's impossible to understand or to even want to understand the resolution.  As for the characters - computer graphics have created very realistic, but not convincingly lifelike characters.  The animators obviously forgot that even real people need direction and variety, yet the disagreeable face of Hein remains fixed in something like a scowl or a sneer, while Aki looks perpetually somber.  There's a big difference between making computer-generated people look good in stills or even in a few minutes of footage and having them carry an entire movie.  By the end, with a vague climax and never really solidified characters, FF is distinctly underwhelming.",1035763200,,3451,4.900343642611684

1320954,1,B00003CY5C,"First of all, I never followed the Final Fantasy games, so I don't care that this has nothing to do with the game.  OK, here's the story in a nutshell:  An asteroid carrying phantoms crashes on Earth.  The phantoms devour the ""spirit energy,"" a.k.a. life force of all living things.  Years later, the only life left on Earth is in domed cities.  Mankind has managed to develop a super cannon strong enough to destroy the phantoms' hive, (and assumably all phantoms), but the catch is that the cannon may be so strong that it also destroys the Earth's spirit, a.k.a. Gaia.  That is, if the Earth's Gaia even exists, which isn't a certainty for most of the movie.
 Through the course of events, our heroine, Dr. Aki Ross, discovers that the asteroid is part of an alien planet that exploded, and the phantoms aren't invaders.  They're ghosts of the aliens that died, and they're just ""confused, lost, and angry.""  Yep.  They're just confused ghosts that eat souls and have destroyed almost all life on Earth.  (Aren't you glad our Earthly ghosts only scare us?)  Furthermore, it turns out that the super cannon only awakens the alien Gaia and makes it stronger.  If that weren't enough, even though numerous shots only make it stronger, 2 shots miss it and hit the Earth's Gaia, which hurts our Gaia.  So, let me get this straight:  Ghosts eat souls, and the same ammo that kills alien phantoms, makes the alien Gaia stronger, but hurts the Earth's Gaia?  Yep.  That's what they want you to buy.
 But the action's great, right?  Well, not exactly.  While there is a lot of action, all of it is humans running away from the phantoms, shooting as they retreat.  There are no big climaxes.  I was constantly waiting for the good part.  Not even the ending felt climactic.  The super cannon fired, but nothing much happens.  They have to fire it several times to get a reaction.  The alien Gaia just ate the guy with the key to destroying it.  I guess it's going to die now, right?  Hmmm...nothing happened.  Oh wait, now it's dying.  OK, it's dead now.  We're going to see people shouting and celebrating, right?  No?  Just an eagle flying overhead?  That's it!?  Even the death of the psycho general is ho-hum.
 What about all those extra features?  They are also very weak.  The audio commentary was only mildly interesting.  The ""factoids"" that pop up while the movie's playing turn out to be just another commentary--a downright inane conversation actually.  One guy doesn't seem to know anything about the movie.  He doesn't even grasp the obvious, like the flares don't hurt phantoms.  They just make them visible.  He even had to ask what the domes over the city was for!  The other guy would just say stuff like ""This was a hard scene to shoot,"" but wouldn't say why, or ""This shot looks really good.""  He did mention technical stuff like global lighting, key lights, and DRC, but doesn't say what they are.  So you won't learn much at all.  You won't even learn much from the ""making of"" documentary.  (If you want to learn about the making of a CGI movie, listen to the audio commentary in ""Shrek"".  That's very informative.)

 Very lame.  Even if you buy into the whole ""Earth has a spirit that our spirits return to"" theory, it's still very poorly written.  Want more proof?  The last line of the movie, which is also the only thing said after the alien Gaia is destroyed, is this:  ""Oh, it's warm.""",1032480000,3,3406,4.614740368509213

The plot is simple.  An asteroid falling to earth carries within it a host of phantom creatures that seem hell bent on destroying earthly life.  Civilization has been reduced to living in shielded enclaves, and it is only a matter of time before the planet becomes a haunted wasteland.  Aki Ross and her mentor, Dr. Sid, are working on the creation of a neutralizing 'wave' based on the eight basic phantom life forms.  General Hein does not trust Dr. Sid's theories about a Gaia, or planetary spirit, and wants to use a huge orbital laser cannon to destroy the original meteor, possible destroying the earth in the process.  The conflict between these points of view and their shattering effects on the planet are the meat of the film.
Captain Gray Edwards, once Aki's lover, crystallizes this struggle between the material world of violent reaction and the spiritual world of growth and synthesis.  The film plays a bit like an evolved 'Starship Troopers.'  In many ways, it presents the same visual image, and deals with the same issues.  The problem for the director and the viewer is to get past the magnificent graphic work to experience the abiding spiritual faith that is its meaning.  Ironically, the film itself is a metaphor for the issues it expresses.
It is almost futile to discuss the film's animation and design.  They are so far above what we are used to that the required superlatives sound trite.  In essence, the animation staff set out to create something that is even more real than life, and to a great extent, they have succeeded.  This hyperrealism, combined with an almost ballet like feeling of choreography create a sense of moment that makes this seem far more than an action film.  The overall animation is carefully balanced so as to keep the focus on the characters.  Even so, this film has such a sensory effect that the viewer is tempted to forget the plot and simply observe the screen.
The primary DVD provides the film and a whole set of commentaries (directing crew, animation and staging, composer, and production staff), plus the usual trailers, etc.  In the special edition, a second disk adds an extensive 'Making of...' segment, the entire screenplay and some analysis of character, vehicle, and prop design.  Technically, this is an important film, despite its simplistic plot and characters.  For the first time, the definition of what is acting and what is animation is being challenged in a thought provoking fashion.",1028937600,78,3000,4.900990099009901

The name was used solely for it's recognition factor, and not to make the movie part of the series.  On it's own though, the movie is an intelligent and enteraining science-fiction film, adhering more to the roots of traditional sci-fi.  The animation and effects, it goes without saying, are absolutley spectacular.  On top of the that, the voice acting is far above par for an animated film of this type, especially considering the fact that the charecters had to be played much more subtlely and closer to human than most animated films.  The short running time makes the movie feel a little bare by not really giving the audience a chance to really become comfortable with the world.  There is ample attention payed to the development of the relationships between the charecters but, since so many don't see the end of the movie, charecter development is a concept that has no meaning here.

1321028,5,B00003CY5C,"In what is sure to be a DVD classic, Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within is just an awsome display of CGI technology. And when seen on DVD, you will appreciate the 1000's of hours it took the creators of FF to put this all together. Hironobu Sakaguchi's opus, if i can call it that,started many years ago as a designer of many popular games for computers {final fantasy 1-8 inparticular}. In 1997, Square pictures was born, and work began in earnest. The film Final Fantasy; The Spirits Within, debuted in July of 2001. Unfortunatly for Sony/Square pictures, the film was a box office bust, primarily because of very poor advance advertisement, and the unrealized hopes of Final Fantasy ""gamers"", who thought the movie would depict more game related genre. This was unfortunate for those who didn't see it on the big screen, as the movie really was worth the price of admission. Aside from the obvious CGI accomplishments, some of the character roles are memorable as well. The most outstanding {loved?} character would be Dr. Aki Ross, a brilliant and beautiful scientist, who at 27 yrs. old, shows lots of grace and poise under pressure. Other worthy mentionables are Dr. Sid, aki's mentor, and Grey Edwards, the love of her life. In the DVD special addition, you get a 2nd disc as well, with lots to see and do, including things to do on your PC with the disc. There are also some hidden ""eggs""- special hidden sequences on both disc's that can be accessed through a series of commands thru your DVD remote {there are web sites that tell you how}. The story in FF could have been better scripted, but the movie itself was extremely entertaining, as well as frightningly realistic. EVERYTHING is computer generated. Final Fantasy; The Spirits Wihin, is sure to be a favorite among DVD'ers and a ""Must Own""
mainstay in your personnal library. Even though box office wise the movie failed, I think DVD wise it won't. The more you watch the character interplay and CGI gymnastics, the more you will appreciate them. It is said that FF 2 is coming in the future, although it is not known when, and in what form. What is almost certain is that the character of Aki Ross will be the mainstay in any sequel, as she is easily the most impressionable character to come out of FF. Take a look. You won't be dissapointed. All those who didn't see FF in 2001 will wonder why not. And don't be surprised if Dr. Ross holds a special place in your heart afterwards. *****",1025568000,,2456,4.635321100917431
1321029,2,B00003CY5C,"Ah yes, Final Fantasy. This is one of the best movies I've seen in a long time. And by that, of course, I mean one of the worst.
Let me say that I agree, the animation is groundbreaking, wonderful, and so forth. Other people have already covered that, so I'm talking about the ""plot"".
The story starts off with our beautiful, perfect, utterly annoying star searching for a plant. If that isn't gripping and exciting, I don't know what is. You get your basic ""The apocalypse has come"" imagery, and some pointless action. Our other heroes come swooping in, including the ever hilarious (unintentionally) Ben Affleck clone, Gray. What do you know, he and Aki have a ""past"". I never would have guessed that.
And then the exposition starts. And there's no going back. We get endless scenes of talking about something about the planet dying and the spirits, but it doesn't really matter, because look at the animation, isn't it pretty? We also get some dream sequences, a great excuse to zoom in on Aki's eye, isn't it pretty? Also some more pointless action to showcase their pretty ""ghosts"".

Hmmmmmmm. Anyone who says that must only be able to understand cheap films with no plots like Tomb-Raider. And with all of those descriptions above applied to this movie, something must be desperatly wrong with america. First of all, for all the idiots out there who thought the plot was weak and non-existant, maybe I should give you a little re-cap:
In the distant future, earth has become a wasteland. Alien biengs, called ""phantoms"" patrol the earth. Humans cower in domed cities. Dr. Aki Ross, who is fighting the remains of a phantom inside her body, is trying to destroy them. She and her partner/mentor Dr. Sid travel the world collecting spirits, or souls for all you hyper-religous types out there. When they collect eight special spirits, they can create a wave that is the oppisite of that that the phantoms generate. This wave effectively wipes out the phantoms. Opposing them is General Hein, a hot-headed military official who wants to blast the phantoms to hell with his giant orbiting laser called the ""Zeus Cannon"". But the Zeus Cannon could destroy the earth. Other characters include Aki's lover, Grey, who looks disturbingly like Ben Afflec. Grey is part of a rag-tag band of soldiers called the ""Deep Eyes"".
Now, tell me that is not a complex plot. And if you can't, I pity you for your ignorance.
Now, besides the excellent plot, the film has the best CGI of any film previous. It is completetly CGI. Sometimes I forgot that the CGI characters were not human!

1321104,5,B00003CY5C,"Despite the somewhat static storyline, this film deserved far greater recognition than it got. Technically speaking, this was the most incredibly stunning film that I have ever seen. The financial losses suffered by this revolutionary masterpiece of film making were so great that Squaresoft had to close down their computer animation studio in Hawaii, laying off some of the most technically talented individuals ever assembled (from both USA and Japan). Although Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within was not the first fully computer animated feature, it was the first to have such near photo-realistic CGI's - a degree of realism that approached 90%. The level of attention and care when it came to simulating light and shadow, human facial expressions, skin tone (including flecks), and individual strands of hair (with hair follicles) were extraordinary! Although I can understand the complaints voiced by the likes of Hollywood stars such as Tom Hanks about the possible threat to their livelihoods from photo-realistic CGI characters, I still feel their paranoia is unwarranted. CGI offers people yet another alternative in entertainment. People have the right to be entertained by whatever art forms they choose - the more diversity, the better. I mean let's not forget, you could forever admire a stunning CGI character (who never ages), but you can't ask it for it's autograph or shake its hand! Although I gotta admit, Aki Ross is THE hottest girl who never lived......",1023580800,,1476,5.258474576271187
1321105,2,B00003CY5C,"First off, let's have a moment of silence for Square Pictures...
Okay, that's enough. This first and only offering from the all-CG studio comes to me with mixed emotions as I eject the disc from my laptop. I want to say that this movie is superb, wonderful, awe-inspiring, etc., etc...but, past the animation itself, I just can't.
Of course, the computer-generated animation is breathtaking; it's the most realistic CG I've ever seen anywhere. I'll admit, there were a few moments where I actually forgot I was watching an animated film. The characters move as fluidly across the screen as real human beings, and everything down to the last strand of hair is lifelike enough to reach out and touch. The voice-actors complement the characters very nicely as well; but a cast with the likes of James Woods, Alec Baldwin, and Donald Sutherland would make the dialogue from ""The Teletubbies"" worthy of an Oscar. The only thing I saw that could've used just a little polish was in the facial expressions. To me, that was the only quality that brought the animation back down to earth. Too bad Square won't have the chance to improve.
As far as the movie itself goes...hm. The story is pretty unoriginal; nothing I haven't seen in sci-fi movies a dozen times before. The pace of the story, while full of CG-rific action and cool futuristic toys, did little to hold my attention. I found myself too far lost in the sheer visual beauty of it all. Even during the movie's climax, which tries really hard to be heart-rending, all I could say was, ""Man, this is awesome animation."" That was disappointing.
What all but saved the whole package, though, was the DVD extras. I actually went through Disc 2 (several times) before even watching the movie, and that disc alone made it almost worth the purchase. The ""joke outtakes"" split my sides, and of course seeing how the film was put together is neat-o in any book. And the ""Thriller"" video...it takes a little ""digging"" to find, but it's just as good as everyone says it is, and just as funny.
For a CG movie that took over 3 years to make, yeah, the animation is great, but apart from that and the extras, I can't really recommend buying this DVD with a clear conscience. Beauty's only skin deep in this case.",1023235200,2,2250,4.670025188916877

The plot was all right at the beginning, but at the end, it seemed the animators needed a quick flashy way to end off the film.  Rather disappointing.  And the characters!  Oh the characters!!!  Aki was annoying, her boyfriend a little too noble to be real...the only good character was the doctor.  Some of the scenes were just plain CHEESY!  The one love scene with Aki and her boyfriend made me laugh out loud in the theatre.  Why oh why do they have to be so melodramatic?  Also, I had this constant nagging consciousness that something was wrong with all of the characters' teeth.
The makers of this film just didn't seem to understand that...characters and story are important too!  Yes, the animation was spectacular, but the characters just fell flat.  You didn't care about them at all.
The soundtrack also left something to be desired.  Instead of the moving, rather nostalgic music I was used to in the Final Fantasy games, the music in this movie was severely lacking in emotion and momentum.

Although a few action scenes reminded me of Aliens, I was really suprised at how this CG film didn't take a turn for the worst like most films in the Scifi genre do.

1321111,4,B00003CY5C,"Think you know what the movie is about, just from the trailer? Dead wrong. 90% of the stuff in the trailer is from the first thirty minutes of the movie. And this film is almost 2 hours long.
Which means that you've got a ton of movie to watch.
The storyline is good, but there were points that I was hoping for more back-story. I did like the revelation about the phantoms and why they're here, though it didn't provide enough information for me to understand their M.O. The film clips along at a good pace, though, and you truly get to feeling for the human characters along the way. In fact, the woman next to me started snuffling when one of the ""Deep Eyes"" team is killed in action against the phantoms.
The digital effects of the phantoms are stunning, and truly creepy. There's a huge myriad of phantom forms... everything from flying ""dragons"" to human-sized, to ""meta"" forms: huge, lumbering, sinister-looking, and utterly deadly. One mere brush against a phantom is enough to infect a human and kill him. If that isn't scary... the phantoms are capable of ripping your very spirit from your body... leaving your physical shell to drop like so much dead weight. Worse still, this process is extremely disturbing, and frighteningly quick (and could possibly spook young children)
The CGI rendering throughout the film is eye-candy of the highest order. There are a few moments where you can tell that one or two characters were rendered at the beginning of the project; they're a bit stiff, and a little too obviously CGI. However, the animation for Dr. Ross (voiced by Ming-Na) and Capt. Gray (Alec Baldwin) are incredible. The animation on Dr. Sid (Donald Sutherland) is so life-like I had to remind myself at a couple of junctions that he's CGI; he had some very human mannerisms.
The voice-acting is top-notch, something you'd expect from a cast of this caliber. And the interplay between Ving Rhames, Peri Gilpin, and Steve Buscemi sounded so natural, it's difficult to believe that they weren't recorded all together in the same room. Of all the voice-actors, I'd have to give the least amount of credit to James Wood, for his turn as General Hein, the vengeance-obsessed military strategist. He was too wooden, IMO. Donald Sutherland's performance was stellar, and his subtle intonations fit the character perfectly.
The ending.... Well, it's certainly a Final Fantasy ending; a balance of the melancholic and optimistic. I didn't quite see the ending coming, but I felt that it was right none-the-less.
The story is good; it's not superb. The characters are likeable (and at times,... funny), but there's a few problems with visually disparate rendering. The real treat here is the sheer scope of this project, and the sheer immensity of the visions you are part of. All in all, I'm going back to see it. I'll happily give them my money to see this amount of eye-candy again. It's amazing to see the technology pushed so far. I can't wait to see what they do for an encore.
PS - Do not get up from your seat, until the credits start to roll. There's a hauntingly beautiful track that plays over the last few minutes of the film, and the beginning of the credits. It's beautiful.",1022976000,2,3194,4.756756756756757

1321167,4,B00003CY5C,"What's most surprising about this computer-generated sci-fi spectacular is that it doesn't rely on technical wizardry alone.  Along with its jaw-dropping visuals and superb sound design, ""Final Fantasy"" manages to tell an original, appealing and emotionally involving story that probably wouldn't stand up if made as a live-action film, given its spiritual content.  Fortunately, animation can go where live action fears to tread, and while its mysticism won't appeal to everyone, fans of Manga and other Asian animations will probably find this fusion of futuristic science and ancient spirituality hits the mark.  The plot unravels only slightly at the climax, requiring a strange sacrifice that doesn't make sense in the context of what's come before it.  So ultimately, I guess, it's the good and bad aspects of the script which are most telling here.  Technically, CGI may or may not be the future of cinema, but ""Final Fantasy"" demonstrates that good storytelling is and always will be the heart of a good movie, no matter how it's produced.  (It also proves that Alec Baldwin is much more convincing when you can't see him.)  This double-disc DVD is packed with extra features that fans will enjoy - though it takes a while to find much of what's promised on the packaging.  A lot of it is accessible only from within the ""Making Of..."" featurette, which can get a little frustrating.

No comments about how ""real"" it looks.
If you are the kind of person who can appreciate what this movie really has going for it...The following is for you.
I have read, collected, re-read, loved, appreciated...and gone out to buy more Science Fiction novels than I have book shelf space to hold over the last 20+ years.
Hundreds upon hundreds upon hundreds of great works of sci-fi live in my spare bedroom.
And while I was enjoying these great written works...I grew up.
I started to realize how things worked.
And I realized pretty quickly that two things were going to be real stumbling blocks between the idea of taking a really good science fiction novel/story/idea/concept and ever seeing the realization of a good movie translation of said novel/story/idea/concept.
First is being able to ""show"" visually all of the things, that with a written piece of work, you only have to describe it with words.
This movie is damn good evidence that we are very soon going to be able to scratch item one off of our list of things to worry about.
The second problem with getting a good ""book"" to ""movie"" translation hinges on the whole concept behind having to do a translation in the first place.
Too often the process of adapting/translating a book into a movie seems to be mostly about dragging the ""understandability"" level of the movie down to the lowest common denominator.
So by the time you have reworked a good written story into a movie that everyone who is apt to sleep or talk thru half of it can still understand and follow with only the slightest amount of attention wasted...you have no longer got yourself a good story.
This movie does a pretty good job of not even realizing that as movie makers they were supposed to be doing that.
Much like the *COUGH* good *COUGH* version of a certain Ridley Scott film; if you actually pay attention, you can follow the story. They just aren't going to bring their spoon this time.",1022112000,6,1988,4.666666666666667
1321173,1,B00003CY5C,"To call ""Final Fantasy - The Spirits Within"" science fiction is an insult to the genre. The appallingly badly written script is not about science, it is about some hokey earth-spirit mysticism connected with ghosts, and splices together all the usual clichs of the late 20th century: beautiful ""mother earth"", an evil technocratic dictator, a final noble sacrifice for love... It bored me to tears. Even the animation, which was supposed to be its selling point, was unconvincing. The planes and angles of each character's face may be well rendered, but they moved like marionettes, and the prevaling darkness of all scenes - probably a deliberate attempt to give it a film-noir look - just made it visually muddy and confusing.

This movie not only demonstrates Squaresoft's graphics programming power but also their expertise in film emphasis through storyline. I remember watching it and smiling to myself during some scenes where I knew they did something in particular just to show off their graphics; just to say: ""Look! We can have him run his hand through her hair and be able to show each individual strand. Ha! And you can't! Hahahaha!"" The only complaint I have, which is personally directed at Squaresoft, is that they didn't show off their water. Water and fire are the two harderst things to CG well. They did the fire excellently in many circumstances, but the only water was simple clear and shallow during the dream. I was hoping for some waves crashing on the shore or some other demonstration of Computer Graphics power. Oh well, I still got perfection. Humans are the third most difficult thing to render and they hit the mark perfectly.
This movie got a bad rap from most of the reviewers for some reason. I remember people complaining that the characters' mouthes didn't open far enough. I mean, come on!

As you can imagine from the title, it's based on the popular Final Fantasy video game series, but its story is completely new. It seems to take place on a futuristic Earth, one that is a desolate waste. The planet is being devoured by a race of insubstantial aliens known only as the Phantoms, who devour the spirits of living creatures. Though most humans have already been destroyed, a few have retreated to some cities which they protect with energy barriers that seem to ward off the Phantoms. All this time, the main character, scientist Aki Ross, has been experiencing some strange dreams which she believes hold the key to discovering the secret of the Phantoms. She has discovered that there are eight Earth spirits that have the power to disable the Phantoms, and, having acquired six of them already, is on a quest to find the last two before it's too late. During her quest, she discovers that, far from being an alien invasion, the Phantoms are in fact the ghosts of an alien race whose planet was destroyed. A large chunk of this planet, which most people believed to be a meteor and form of transportation for the Phantoms, crashed onto earth more than thirty years ago, since which time the ghosts have been searching for a way to find peace. She embarks on a quest with her mentor, an elderly scientist named Sid, and her lover, a troop commander named Gray Edwards and his band of troops, hoping to find a way to lay the Phantoms to rest and spare their world. However, they are racing against a general who seeks to destroy the Phantoms using a recently developed space cannon, and will not consider any other consequences of using such a powerful weapon. Far from believing that the Phantoms are only ghosts, this general will stop at nothing to see that they are destroyed, and does not listen to Sid's warning about the possible dangers posed to the already ravaged planet through use of the Zeus Cannon. The beam is so powerful that, not only would it destroy the meteor and the Phantoms along with it, but it could also obliterate the entire planet. This is a movie I think you ought to rent at least.

1321309,5,B00003CY5C,"Whether you are of the Final Fantasy persuasion or not does not actually matter.  Squaresoft's masterpiece computer game, selling millions worldwide, thankfully destroyed the ego of the pitiless teen fantasy that was Tomb Raider.  In 1997, one of the greatest games ever made (as agreed by just about every game player on the planet), Final Fantasy VII came out.  It changed the face of gaming forever.  For once, gamers could actually live a game, rather than merely jump and shoot within the restricting walls of an apparent ""3-D"" environment.
So it came as no surprise that a movie would be made incorporating all the themes present in the game.  The hype surrounding ""Final Fantasy - The Spirits Within"" was enormous, as worldwide gamers could not wait to see their heroes brought to life on the big-screen.
Along with the tremendous hype came rumours that no characters from any of the games would be included in the upcoming movie.  These rumours angered fans, as the one thing for which they had waited for years would probably be spoiled by the idea of a completely new world and new characters within it.
Unfortunately, the rumours became truth, and when ""Final Fantasy - The Spirits Within"" came out in the cinema, auditoriums hardly found themselves bursting at the seams.  Fans were immensely disappointed at the storyline - somewhat weak in comparison with its gaming counterparts.
The story is not that bad.  The plot is interesting and keeps the viewer informed.  Although the idea of running from alien ghosts does not tantalyze most minds, the actual story holds up well, even if it is a tad weird - but people should not forget what the title of the movie implies.
One thing that made the games so successful was the attention to character detail.  The movie has some very well created characters, however, there are some whose lines give off a certain cheesiness when speaking.  Alec Baldwin's character, Gray Edwards, for example, has lines such as, ""Alright people, the city may be lost but we are not - let's do this job then get the hell outta here!""  Whoever wrote that line into the screenplay should, in all honesty, be shot!  Lines such as these are what convey the idea of the All-American macho hero that worldwide audiences now despise.
The soundtrack to the movie is fantastic, even if the main character is not.  Elliot Goldenthal creates a haunting atmosphere that is truly superb.
If you need one reason to buy this DVD, then may I suggest the revolutionary visual extravaganza put on show.  Aki's hair cost two million dollars alone to make, with each individual strand being given tender loving care.  Facial expressions are awesome and I promise that you will be fooled into believing the characters to be real actors at numerous points in the film.
The DVD offers over four hours of extras, ranging from how characters and scenes were created, editing your own scene from the movie, an alternate beginning and my personal favourite - a Michael Jackson's Thriller video performed by the film's characters.  The clever ways in which both DVDs start are original and inspiring.  Also, I did like the interactice documentary, wherein you can focus on a subject more deeply at the touch of a button - Well done Square and Columbia!

1321311,3,B00003CY5C,"First, a disclaimer:  I have never played any of the Final Fantasy video games, so this review is strictly a 'movie' review.
What's to like about FINAL FANTASY: THE SPIRITS WITHIN?  There is a lot to like in this movie.  The CGI effects are, in a word, breathtaking.  I recently heard a movie critic complain that humans in CGI never seem lifelike.  That's certainly not the case here.  Facial expression, nuances in shading and background, fluid and lifelike movement - I've never seen an animated movie that even approaches what's been done in this movie.
Unfortunately, all the great animation in the world can't save a flawed plotline, and that's where FINAL FANTASY falls short.  Ming-Na, Donald Sutherland, and all the actors give good performances in their voicing of characters, but they aren't given much with which to work, and so the movie suffers.  General Hein is a particularly uninspiring character: though James Woods does an excellent job voicing the part, the General himself is wooden, flat, and a cliched collage of every revenge-driven, over-testosteroned military man we've ever seen.  Even considering the motivation the writers give his character, Hein is still so over-the-top in his blind desire for revenge that the drama in his character is hopelessly lost.
Steve Buscemi, Peri Gilpin, and Ving Rhames give excellent performances as members of Alec Baldwin's unit, and Ming-Na is wonderful as Dr. Aki Ross.  There is some prior romantic interest between Baldwin's character and Dr. Ross, but it is never explained and thus weakens the impact their relationship has on the story.
Finally a MAJOR problem with the movie is the 'monsters' that are haunting Earth.  No one ever explains how the weapons humanity uses could possibly work against them, and I found myself wondering how guns could possibly inflict damage on creatures that suck the life out of humans at the slightest touch.  Just another loose end in the script that could have been explored and should have at least been addressed.
Even with all this, however, I enjoyed the movie quite a bit.  As I said, the animation is really breathtaking at times, and there are fantasy/sci-fi movies that much, much worse (see Battlefield Earth, Titan A.E.).  FINAL FANTASY: THE SPIRITS WITHIN is, all together, a good movie that simply could have been much better.",1017100800,,2344,5.038860103626943

1321373,3,B00003CY5C,"Sometimes a movie isn't so easy to review. One reason can be that it doesn't fit the mold, and that's certainly the case with Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within. It's animated, but it's not for kids. [Note the PG-13 rating.] It's animation, which is computer generated, is so high tech that it's almost photorealistic. Unlike Shrek or A Bug's Life, though, it's main characters aren't cartoon figures made lifelike. They are people - people generated by computers. They don't look entirely real, but they are startling enough to suggest a future in which Nicole Kidman or Julia Roberts could star in a movie without really being there at all. They could simply show up afterwards to do the voices.
With the possible exception of Moulin Rouge [not yet on video]. Final Fantasy is the most visually stunning movie I have seen this year. If a movie can be art, then this one qualifies. If it can't, then this is still a major technological breakthrough. There have been lots of important advances over the years, such as Technicolor, Cinemascope, Cinerama, Panavision, digital stereo and IMAX. Each of them impressed audiences and increased business, at least until the novelty wore off. After a while audiences remembered a basic need, which is that of a story people want to see and hear. That need has not changed, and the makers of Final Fantasy, who spent four years and a reported 137 million dollars to create this newest frontier in movie making, learned the hard way that, if the story isn't all that good, people won't come to see the movie. To make matters worse, they weren't able to convince a young adult audience that an animated movie can be for them rather than for kids. It can be, but few viewers are yet buying the idea.
It is the year 2064. Planet Earth has been invaded and conquered by creepy and often invisible beings. Life for people goes on, but only in cities protected under giant bubbles. Leave the city, and the aliens will definitely get you literally sucking out your spirit. As the movie opens, Dr. Aki Ross [voice of Ming-Na] is alone on a scientific expedition. Fortunately, she is rescued at the last moment by Capt. Gary Edwards [Alec Baldwin] and his crew. It turns out that Aki and Gary used to be lovers and are not at all happy to see each other. Everyone thinks Aki is crazy to have ventured out into the world, but she is actually working on an important project with Dr. Sid [Donald Sutherland]. They believe in the Gaia, the idea that our planet is composed of spirits. If they can find all eight of these spirits, they can force the aliens to leave. Most of the rest of humanity is putting its faith in the Zeus Project, a giant death ray in space built to destroy the asteroid the invaders arrived on. Aki and Dr. Sid are convinced that blowing it up will only make matters worse.
So, here we are at my problem. I can't fault the artistry of the film. I will doubtless watch it again for its astounding visuals. I know the movie is based on a very successful series of video games. The concepts of looking for the spirits and for the Gaia are intriguing. So, why did the producers decide to use such an unimaginative space-opera script? It would seem like their enormous investment would have required a first-rate story. Whatever the case, the best I can do is to give it a mixed review.
By the way, since the art of computer animation does not yet produce entirely believable human figures, Nicole and Julia will still need to report to the set for the next several years.",1015891200,5,3518,4.594594594594595
1321374,5,B00003CY5C,"It has really baffled me how this stunning ground breaking movie ended up receiving with such mixed response upon its release last summer.
The design and visuals are so powerful and arrestingly beautiful that have yet to be surpassed in any movie, let alone in the genre of science fiction.
The direction, particularly in the several eye-popping action set pieces, reveals a talent on par with James Cameron in terms of the menace, unrelenting tension, and imagination that is conveyed.  The quieter moments of emotion and character exposition are handled with an equal degree skill and subtlety, and to the extent that it is quite astonshing to realise that one is actually watching an entirely animated movie.
The story is not ridiculous, as many of it's critics seem to suggest. It is certainly bold, in that it attempts to deal with issues of spirituality and death, but it is told within clearly outlined, consistent and plausible universe of the mid 21st century following an asteroid impact. The story uses as its basis some contemporary (although admittedly not widely held)
scientific views on the Gaia theory which may for some people be difficult to swallow, but within the confines of the story the theory is dealt with in a balanced and consistent way without being used as an excuse for excessive silliness or sentimentality. Perhaps more importantly, the Gaia theory as alluded to in the film is really a device used in the film to address a number of deeper issues such as death and religion, as well as ecology and the nature of extraterrestrial intelligence.
I cannot recall another sci-fi movie that deals with so many of these issues so boldly and intelligently. For that same film to be so viscerally exciting, thrilling and moving is a rare thing indeed and it saddens me a little to think that the work that Square pictures put into this obvious labour of love didn't equate to the box office smash that it so deserved to be.
I urge anybody who reads this review to give this overlooked movie a chance and you might find yourself rather pleasantly surprised.
and finally, the DVD itself is one of the most slickly put-together 2 disc sets that i've seen and provide a fascinating insight into the film's genesis.",1015200000,,2235,4.835509138381201
1321375,4,B00003CY5C,"Normally, I don't write long reviews, or reviews at all, for items that already have 100+ written by other people.  It just doesn't make good sense.  The odds of anybody actually reading mine are pretty much zero.  But I felt like doing this one anyway, just because I apreciate this film a great deal.
I'll start off by saying that I've never played a Final Fantasy game, with the exeption of the FF3 version for the old school Nintendo Gameboy.  I do keep up on the animation though, and download any previews that I can get my hands on.  So it seemed perfect for me that Square would come out with one non-stop video.
I'm impressed by the video quality.  The animation is realistic, rather than the stylized characters that have been used in the video games.  Even though the animation has a long way to go, it's still the most impressive, realistic that I've ever seen.  This is as far as it gets from Jar Jar Binks.  More impressive is that no human models were used to input the movements.  All the more power to them.
I enjoyed the story.  And it's a dark story.  I know there are people out there who resent any story that doesn't have a Disney happy ending.  If you're one of those people,
a) Grow up
b) and don't buy this movie.  You won't like it.
I don't know why people keep refering to this movie as an adaptation of a video game.  Honestly, in my opinion, if it had meant to be an adaptation, it would have adapted a previous storyline.  It would have been Final Fantasy 8: The Movie.  Or something like that.  Or to look at it another way, nobody ever disliked Super Mario Brothers: The Movie because Mario didn't have to jump on top of the head of a turtle-type thing waving a candycane to save the princess.  I look at it as something original.
To finish, I liked the realistic body of Aki Ross.  Rather than be a swimsuit model, she is a modest, pretty girl.  I apreciated it deeply, to contrast the whole Laura Croft ideal in video games and movies.  I wish that the characters had been developed a bit more.  And I wish that the second disc was worth watching more than once.",1015027200,,2096,4.345360824742268

1321428,4,B00003CY5C,"The main thing about this film that grabs the viewer is, naturally, how absolutely stunning the animation is. Best viewed on the big screen to fully appreciate the detail, the film does translate pretty well to DVD. It took years to complete, and the end result has done the animators proud - after a few minutes, I basically forgot that the characters on the screen weren't actors. In fact, I kept getting confused, because there was a very real-looking man running around with Donald Sutherland's voice, but who looked nothing like him at all. There were times when the movement of the bodies was a little too ... ""smooth,"" maybe, but by and large, just wow. The voice work was also very good, with the aforementioned Donald Sutherland, as well as Peri Gilpin, Ming Na, Steve Buscemi, and James Woods. As I mentioned, I frequently almost forgot they were all animated; the fabric moved as fabric moves, their hair was very close to real-looking and moved as hair moves, the characters had pores in their skin, individual eyelashes, and skin blemishes. The effort and CPU time that went into all of this is just overwhelming.
The plot left me desirous of something...*more*, however. It wasn't exactly weak...it just wasn't fleshed-out enough (har, no pun intended.) I very much liked the ideas and concepts behind a lot of the story, particularly the earth-based spirituality aspects, but I wasn't satisfied with the resolution. It was kind of ""Starship Troopers"" meets ""Princess Mononoke."" Kind of.
Until we find out what the ""phantoms"" are, they're pretty darned scary and mysterious. I really enjoyed them, especially the gigantic and flying phantoms, because they really fed into my phobia of being chased by huge monsters that can kill me. I like to be scared, and the phantoms worked for me in a lot of ways.
I can't quite pin down why I didn't enjoy it as much as I would have liked to, and I'm going to have to go see it again. I guess I was so enamored with some of the film's concepts early on that I really wanted them to be taken further than they were.

However, the plot seems little weak...",1013817600,,57,6.25
1321431,3,B00003CY5C,"Okay, before I begin, I liked this movie - a lot. However, while being a GREAT sci-fi movie, it was just lacking that Final Fantasy feel that the games tend to give off. It had very improper atmosphere. Anyway, let's get into this:
Alright, the director of the games has been watching Aliens WAAAAY too much. The movie is often called Alien 5 by some of my friends. We're all total freaks of the Alien series, no we all naturally loved this movie. However, we're also huge Final Fantasy fans, and this movie was just way too Aliens for us to call Final Fantasy.
Firstly, let's examine the plot itself, dealing with aliens from another unknown world that come and kill everyone off. That in itself sounds too familiar to the invasion colonly on LV-426.
Character relations: the main character is, of course, a woman - with an alien infection inside her - kinda like Ripley and her Queen Alien infection. And that Grey character just popped Hicks into my mind right then. Then there's Neil, which basically Hudson with a dumber sense of humor and a high nasal voice. Oh and we CAN'T forget Ryan and Jane - a total ripoff of Sgt. Apone and Vasquez (Jane is THE biggest Vasquez ripoff I've ever seen.)
Music relations - anyone who knows their Alien films also know that the composer for this movie is none other than Alien 3's Elliot Goldenthal. He even puts his famous orchestration sounds into the movie (remember the Chase Scene from Alien 3? Compare the music in that to Aki's Dream).
Lemme see if I've missed anything... oh yeah! The nature of the creatures from both films is very similar. I even heard that the Phantoms were inspired by H.R. Giger, the Alien creature's creator. I might be wrong about this, but I've heard it flying around a few times. Also, the creatures have the same use of humans - the Phantoms infect a human upon touch with piece of a Phantom that eventually matures and overtakes the human body. The Xenomorph implants an embryo in the human body that matures and KILLS the human body. Striking similarity there....
Okay I'm through ranting about Aliens. Now I'll go quickly into what the movie was missing that would have made it more Final Fantasy and less Aliens.
-Where the HELL are the Chocobos and Moogles!!?? They at LEAST could have put ONE of them in there! Seeing a Chocobo on someone's SHIRT doesn't COUNT, man! That's WAY too far off. They could have put ONE Chocobo in there.
(A few people have said that there's a Phantom in the later scenes modeled directly after a Chocobo, but I don't believe it, personally)
-Why does it take place on Earth? I think that was A HUGE mistake, because it severely limits their possibilities in terms of plot and creativity. All the FF's have taken place in their own little universe that has nothing to do with Earth.
-Why didn't Nobuo Umetsu compose the music? That would have added a lot to it.
-Almost all of the FF's have some kind of cameo appearence by a character, place, event, etc. Like the scene in FF Tactics with Aeris and Cloud, as an obvious example. The movie had none of that, to my dismay. I was hoping that in that meeting room, I'd see Cloud or Seifer, Terra, Tristam, or Ramza and Delita. I DID see Sakaguchi there, but he's VERY difficult to make out.
-Signature characters didn't make an appearence, like the frequent Biggs and Wedge duo, for example. They could very well have made them a part of the Deep Eyes Team!!
  You know what I thought would have been cool is if they put Tristam and Reuben (From Mystic Quest) as Deep Eyes members. I really liked both of those characters.
As a grand total, I give this movie 3 out of 5 for being an awesome Alien 5 movie, but a [bad] Final Fantasy movie",1013385600,4,3695,4.513432835820896

The games are usually based on someone harming mother earth.  The importance of our world.  The movie was beautiful and dark.  Ming Na was excellent as Aki.

1321434,2,B00003CY5C,"Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within (Hironobu Sakaguchi and Moto Sakakibara, 2001)

Every review of this movie I ever read says roughly the same thing: ""the animation in this movie will astound you.  If you're not impressed by animation, though, you might as well ignore it, because there's nothing backing it up."" I hate to say it, but despite animation that is, truly,  fantastic, and a cast that redefines ""high-powered"" in an animated film, those reviews are dead on, and you won't read anything new here.

The setting is Earth in 2065. Thirty-four years previous, a large meteorite crashed into the Earth's surface  (forget, for the moment, that the last time a chunk of rock this big crashed into the Earth's surface, the dinosaurs were wiped out), bringing with it an alien race called the  Phantoms. The Phantoms are very invisible, very nasty, and extremely pissed off, and their main mission on Earth seems to be to kill humans as quickly and efficiently as possible.  What's left of humanity is holed up in a large, ultra-secure dome in New York City. Most humans are simply concerned with killing Phantoms in the same way Phantoms kill humans, but two  scientists, Aki (Ming-Na, recently of Mulan) and Sid (Donald Sutherland), are convinced that conventional weapons are not the way to go here; they're of the belief that  a series of eight spirits, when combined correctly and beamed out over the earth, will act towards the Phantoms as matter acts to anti-matter, the two will cancel each  other out, and humans will be free to recolonize their own
planet. The head of the faction who believes guns ARE the way to go is General Hyde (James Woods), who assigns a  team of stormtroopers to guard Aki and Sid in their quest to find the eight spirits (the film opens with Aki going out into the undomed part of New York to get the  sixth one). The subtext, of course, is that the guards are also monitors. The guards ain't no slouches either, voicewise. Keith David, Peri Gilpin, Alec Baldwin, and Steve Buscemi  all lend their vocal talents to these parts. That's a lot of talent in that there paragraph, Vern. It's also more than enough meat, handled correctly, to come up with a pretty  bang-up story with lots of mysticism AND lots of things blowing up. How cool is that?

Not too cool at all, unfortunately. The plot's about as wooden as it could possibly be, and while the voice acting  is exceptional in its understatement for an animated film (where one expects, and probably should expect, overacting; witness the successes of Monsters Inc. and Shrek the same year  of Final Fantasy's release), it more often than not comes off as wooden and unemotional. Whether it's the voice acting, Squaresoft's continuing inability to animate  faces correctly, or a combination of the above remains debatable.

The inability to animate faces, though (they're just too smooth, pure and simple), is Square's only shortcoming  where the animation is concerned. There were two or three points during the film where I really did think I was watching a live-action movie. The Spirits Within, if nothing  else, will be remembered for pushing the envelope orders of magnitude farther than any film before it for realistic animation. While that animation itself is probably a good  enough reason to give this thing a ninety-nine cent rental, more than anything it underscores the idea that, if the plot had been carried off with the same flair as the animation,  The Spirits Within would have achieved ""instant classic"" status faster than you can say anime. And that's the biggest disappointment the film offers. **",1012780800,2,3611,4.873977086743044
1321435,5,B00003CY5C,"Well,to begin this review,I must say that this movie rivalizes Lord of the Rings as the best film of 2001,and is one of the top ten best sci-fi movies of all time,I think.
It is about a young woman named Dr. Aki Ross,who gets advices in her dreams about what to do to save the Earth from beeing completley destroyed by aliens. She gets help from a few other characters,among them Neil (voiced by Alec Baldwin),Dr Sid (voiced by Donald Sutherland),and general Hein (voiced by James Woods). So this is yet another CG film with the voices of famous actors!
Yeah,some people might think there is boring watching CG generated characters but this ain`t Toy Story or something!
This is one of the most expensive films ever made,with it`s 120 dollar budget,and one which really deserved that budget. The computer animations are really remarkable - this is a perfect science-fiction film. It has a quite good story,fantastic backgrounds,interesting characters,and amazing space monsters,such as giant dragons and the space demons called ""phantoms"",which reminds me of the strategy game Star Craft`s well-known aliens zergs. This movie is really concentrated on detail - the animators worked for four years animating this one. Not a singel thing is done unambitiously!
And I really appreciate that. My favorite sequences are the battle scenes in the end of the film,featuring some of the most fantastic lighting effects & CG monsters ever seen,making Star Wars Episode I look like a playhouse!
It`s a real pity it failed at the box office - I had even hope for a sequel,but that's only in my dreams now. Many people might think this is silly because it is animated,but this ain`t a Disney film - this is as great as any live-action science-fiction film. Or may be it was because it was very unlike the game - the only thing familiar was the title!
Well,now I've reviewed the film,so I will spend a little time reviewing the extras on this collector`s edition DVD. It contains a lot of specials,different from many other DVD`s I`ve seen. Among my favorites are the alternate opening,matte art explorations,the documentary ""Making of Final Fantasy"",the character files and the blasts/boards - two of them featuring story boards and CG edited paintings,which are invalueable to people who works with computer graphics as well as people who likes to do sci-fi/fantasy drawings.

A lof of friends of mine who had played the video games were really excited when this film was released in 2001. However, I've never played any of the games and therefore watched the film solely on its cinematic merit.

Overall, the movie isn't that great. The story drags on in a plot mix of science fiction and eastern mystic paganism. Films of the later variety usually aren't that interesting (see WHAT DREAMS MAY COME). However, decent sci-fi flicks are enjoyable. Unfortunately, FINAL FANTASY: THE SPIRITS WITHIN isn't a decent sci-fi movie. The only good thing about the film is the visuals: FINAL FANTASY is a computer animated flick that contains the most realistic looking computer animation to date.

I've heard some people say it ""sucked"", but I think anyone in that frame of mind was probably simply frustrated that they could not follow the story. A little hard to follow, yes, but that's what makes it worth to watch a second, third and fourth time. Even if you can't follow the story, this movie is visually satisfying no matter who you are or what you like.
The special features are great. From character profiles that make you believe even more in the main characters when you watch it the next time, to ""outakes"" where the animators had fun and did a few jokes along the way. I especially liked the section called ""Aki's Dream"" which shows you her entire dream without interuption. To see it all together like that was wonderfull.
What makes the movie's visual effects that much more amazing is when you see how many different groups are involved in a single shot. The work and attention to detail is mind blowing.

I just got the DVD and spent about 4 hours watching not only the movie but much of the included extra material.  It was when I was watching the interviews with the production team that things fell into place for me.  The problem was the production team was too close to the story to tell it properly based on just the film alone, and since I hadn't played the games, those pieces of information the game players were so accustomed to were missing to me.  (if you're wondering, Aki has a love of the earth and unless you're *really* paying attention in the opening sequence, you'll miss it).
Other than that, this disc is digital from end to end(at no point in production or editing was it ever converted to analog).  Because of that, the video quality will just blow you away even if you don't have a digital tv to watch it on.

FF deals with several occuring themes; The Brashness of the Military, Questioning Gaia Theories, and a few others I can't figure out right now. Don't really expect this film to be action, because while there are a few action shots, most of it goes into grossingly philosophical detail only a college might wanna dwell into.

While tron did not do that great at the box office, it was a ground breaking movie for it's time with the CG effects.  I feel the same is true with final fantasy.  This is the first time a full length movie had everything done by CGI and an effort was made to have the characters look very real.
  As far as the story goes, It wasn't the greatest, but it wasn't bad either.  My biggest complaint was some of the dialog was too simple.
  In my opinion this is the future of filmmaking.  It make take another generation, but it will happen; and for that reason alone I think having the DVD in your collection is worth it.",1009929600,,686,4.175572519083969
1321568,4,B00003CY5C,"Whose voice is Dr. Aki Ross? I don't know but that's fine. But using Hollywood actors' voices with different bodies is perverse. Someone has to call an end to this common practice that ruins animation films. Aki is Ming-Na? That means what to me? PEOPLE! If you want to animate Southerland and Woods then do that. But putting their voices in the wrong bodies is a Hollywood sickness that shouts a mentality that ""Nobody would go see a cartoon unless we used Sylvester Stalone's voice.""
So why didn't they use Cher for Aki Ross? Or Courtney Love? (gag me).
I advise setting up the DVD to French and the subtitles to English. Then you can enjoy the film without the ""name actor's"" bagage. Really. Just say NO! to this nonsense.

The movie had a very strong fantasy base, and was sometimes hard to follow, but it is worth owning if not for any other reason than it being the first, best example of surrealistic animation.

Though, I only found one thing disapointing about it. It realy had nothing to do with the final fantasy video game series. Wich is kinda hard to say since none of the games realy use the same pepole places or times. But the movie was.....to reality based since fiction to realy be called final fantasy.

It's always good to watch, especially when it is well executed as it was in this case, but it will never be confused with Titanic for its depth.  However, the CGI graphics were very close to real-life.  It was the attention to the little details (the freckles on Aki's face, the way her hair moved realistically, the natural motions of ALL of the characters, the real 3-D feel of the environment, etc.), overlayed with doubtless the best graphics to ever go into a film or any other animated work, that made this movie one of the most breathtaking I have ever had the great pleasure of viewing.  And the sound, from the various normal action sounds to the music, were without equal.

If you're a Final Fantasy Junky like I am this movie is great. If you're not a FF fan this movie is still great because its more sci-fi.

1321631,5,B00003CY5C,"I don't know why all the bad rap about this movie. The story line and animation is the best ive seen in a long time, im a frequent movie goer like every Satday or Sunday and i was beginning to get bored cause all the hollywood stuff are either remakes or everything just look so repeated especially the story, but this movie really rejuvernates me, its makes me feel how good a movie and be and how a movie is suppose to be. At first i didn't like the fact that Akis suit look so much like Reis plug suit from NGE and the scenes just look so much like starship troopers, but when i eventually saw the DVD i was in aw, i had my eyes glued to the TV, not a blink, its wasn't as dull or actionless as other ppl said, it has its share of action and great explosions and fight scenes like Holly movies but better. It sure didn't look like any movie ive seen, especially the story line i was surprised it look far from starship troopers.
As for the not so seamingly flow of CG motion in the characters, trust me there are lot of ppl in hollywood even top noch actors that act worst than the CG models. If humans can look (bad) then CG models that are less natural are likely to be that way. Though the models can use more work but since Square is over budget and overdue they still did a very good job, and had to release it early due to certain problems if they were to do something about it maybe a remake like lucass star wars is a good way to go. Taking the movie and improving it all the way toward mostly in the motion (every would agree on that right) it seem to have gotten alot of work still and if u take note on Dr Cid he has perfect motion in many of the scenes though only a few he is still well done. As for the fact that its not so fantasy related, i personnally don't think so, its hightech like FF7 and 8 and like all the FF games each one has a unique story and characters so does the movie, which makes it even more unique, if they were to make it like the game the story line would fall too much upon the game and would make the story already known if ur person that play all FF games and that way it make the story line dull. It does make u wonder and question things as the movie progress. If FF7 n 8 can be called Fantasy then why cant the movie they are all Sci fi Fantasy to me. To fantasise simply put is to dream of being or in dream state being or ur sub conscious delves into a world of alternate reality doesnt the FF games do that and don't they draw u into the action and each time the angles goes to the first person view of the hand gear, monitors so on i feel as if im the one there and looking. And i do dream wish or fantasise of being there with the action. I feel drawn into the movie just like playing the games.
I personnally think that Square has yet again brough to us another great Final Fantasy title its the best game related movie ive seen even better than Lara Yes. Another master piece from Sakaguchi.
In relation to the poor earnings i don't feel its the fact that the movie was bad in anyway. Its simply the fact that the thing was animated and most adults think anything animated is cartoon so they don't like it and since its not real there are others that don't like that. Its the non Square fans and and those that never really played the games or known much about the workings of square that gave the movie such a bad rap im sure any true final fantasy fan has seen the movie and will get the DVD like me.",1008720000,,3455,4.015965166908563

You have a good story. I think it could be better, but it's good, really. The landscapes and structures images are perfect. Literally fabulous. The first sequence with Aki in New York is perfect, like reality... or better.

1321633,5,B00003CY5C,"I find myself in a curious position of praising Final Fantasy to the skies although I abhor the idea of making a movie based on a computer game. The film stands complete apart from the games. No characters from the games appear in the film, nor will a filmgoer ever feel left in the dark if they are completely unfamiliar with the games. Apparently only the Gaia--Earth Spirit concept and the idea of worlds in which magic and technology coexist are held in common, and perhaps the overall tone of the game. Viewers hoping for a two hour reenactment of their favorite game are bound to be disappointed; but those willing to accept the movie only in the spirit of those games will surely be thrilled.
Final Fantasy is every bit as stunning as the trailers and previews and pre-release publicity would lead you to believe. The animation is quite simply the most realistic I have ever seen. The detail of the characters, from their complexions to the way they move, left me in awe of the artistry--several times during the film I found myself literally saying aloud ""I can't believe it!"" And other times, I found myself NOT amazed at the animation--not because it was bad, but honestly because I was not thinking of it as animation! (Only very rarely, with the movement of a single character (Neil) was the realism ever broken--fans of animated films will know that different characters are created by different animators.) Equally fascinating was the imagery itself--the alien worlds and alien beings (with a single exception--a flying, snakelike dragon which was rather typically and disappointingly commonplace Oriental) were highly imaginative and the colors and tone of the film superbly stylistic. The creatures take their inspiration from the microscopic world--imagine dust mites expanded thousands of times, with tentacles! Some viewers might be reminded of the bio-mechanical worlds of H. R. Giger (Alien), and there is certainly an influence, but no more than that. In terms of visuals, this movie should win many Oscars, or there is no justice.
Plotwise, the film does not quite meet the same high standards. The story is somewhat like a more mature version of Titan A.E. (Earth destroyed by non-material evil aliens, wicked military-type human in position of authority almost ruins everything, hero[ine] on a quest with friends to find the one weapon which can destroy the evil aliens in a single blow), with a touch of The Fifth Element and Captain Planet thrown in for good measure. Sensitive preteens may well find the story too frightening and intense--most of the important characters die, and unlike in a Disney film, don't come back to life. But there isn't much blood--instead we get to see the souls of the characters ripped from their bodies depicted with an almost Leonardo da Vinci-esque skill. My eleven year old daughter was upset by the failure of certain main characters to come back to life, ala Pinocchio or Beast.
The summer of 2001 was a milestone in the history of animation, with FF and Shrek. We are clearly going to have a lot to look forward to.",1008633600,5,3080,4.902298850574713

You won't learn anything from the extras even if you know too much about animation and compositing since there are no ""documentaries"" at all, just a lot of images with some background music.

The Spirits within is the most advanced movie in terms of visuals, but Caveman could have thought up a better plot. The only reason to see the movie is the incredible computer animation, You almost forget that this is not live action. The only other things good about the movie is the word to mouth translation between the actors and the computer animated characters are right on target. The acting does a good job bringing the characters to life with voices by actors such as Alec Baldwin, Steve Buscemi, and Hironobu Sakaguchi. Onfortunately the plot will put you to sleep, and the original thrill of the animation will ware off. The two other people that I saw this movie with agreed that it was boring pointless and stupid. I have no idea why Ebert and Roeper gave it two thumbs up. I'd only reccomend to rent it just to see the the computer animation.",1008374400,,1095,4.507537688442211
1321638,5,B00003CY5C,"I just watched Final Fantasy and it seems to me the creators were, limited by the medium (duh!). We couldn't make the emotional connections because little was rendered; the creators seem relunctant or unable to push the emotions through the CGI faces.  Anyone who has seen traditional hand-drawn Japanese anime knows the lack of emotive expression is not a generic trait; they can shovel those at you in the spades. It looks like the creators (rightly or wrongly) set themselves a technical objective (i.e. realistic portrayal of humans), and then found they had to tone down the emotive range in order not to expose the CGI shortfalls.
Square is to be applauded for pushing the frontier but it is clear that we are still some way short. Most of the time, it's the lip movements, wooden faces and overly smoothed gestures that gave the game away.  Like other reviewers before, I would to love see a FF sequel in a few years time, the same team given another chance to have a stab at it.
P.S. The computers had an easier time with the guys (Dr Sid, the Council President modeled on Kofi Annan etc) with their stubbled faces and short hair, then with the women with their more delicate translucent skin and flowing tressess (having said that, Aki's hair looked absolutely fabulous! - she could be in the next shampoo commercial).  Is this a collory to real life where our women folk are generally more complex creatures?",1008201600,,1418,4.709677419354839
1321639,4,B00003CY5C,"""Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within"" is the kind of movie that people with either love or hate. It is also considered as a testament to the idea that some films only belong on DVD and not in movie theaters. But while opinions are very mixed about this film, I really enjoyed it, despite its obvious flaws.
The most noticable aspect of ""Spirits Within"" would undoubtedly be its graphics, and it's probably what this film will be remembered for. The visuals are amazing and stunning, and the characters are absolutely gorgeous, although they do sometimes move a little unnaturally. It was reported that the designers created Aki last so they could use all their experience on her, and it really shows. As Dash of TechTV said, ""she's worth every megabyte.""
Speaking of characters, ""Final Fantasy"" game veterans might notice that some of the characters resemble characters from the games. Aki somewhat resembles Rinoa from ""FFVIII"", General Hein looks eerily like Seifer from ""FFVIII"", and the black soldier could be a double for Barret from ""FFVII"". But that's just me...
The story is where the trouble starts. Many have complained that the plot is cliched, stale, and unoriginal, but that's not how I feel about it. While I must admit the story isn't terribly original, it's still an interesting story. It is a little confusing at first, especially at the end, but if you pay attention you will understand it. Some people have also complained that the movie has nothing to do with the games, but I disagree. The movie isn't based upon a particular ""FF"" game, but it does contain a key element: the Gaia. One of the binding links between all the ""FF"" games is a unifying force or power that holds the world together, and it's this element that makes sure ""Spirits Within"" isn't using the ""FF"" name as a crutch.
The voice acting is another trouble spot. I will admit that Ming-na (Aki) sometimes faltered into a bland and forced mode of acting, as did Donald Sutherland (Doctor Sid), which made me cringe occasionally. But I will also say that James Woods gave an almost solid performance as General Heim and made him my favorite character of the movie. The rest of the voice actors were so-so, alternating between good and not-so-good. All in all, the voice-acting wasn't terrible, but they definately could've improved it. One minor note: occasionally, the voices did speak out of synch with the lips. It doesn't degrade the movie at all, but you can't help but notice it.
To put it simply, ""Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within"" isn't for everyone. Some people love simplistic and occasionally cliched sci-fi storylines, while others loathe them and want something original. While this movie does break new ground for computer graphics, it unfortunately falls short in terms of execution. I can't reccommend it to anyone because the appeal of this movie is very difficult to pin down; you will just have to see it for yourself.",1008115200,8,2922,4.857715430861724
1321708,5,B00003CY5C,"This is one amazing movie, different from anything you have ever seen. It is extremely ambitious. It is the first computer generated movie to try not only to be in 3D but to actually represent reality. A few characters, especially Dr. Sid, can fool you into thinking they are human, an incredible achievement. It is a science fiction story wrapped around a spiritual core, a very difficult proposition. It has adventure, aliens, alien war, romance, valor, tragedy, violence and pacifism. This is a conceptually, artistically and technically groundbreaking work.
Does it work? Not quite.
The graphics may be much more advanced than anything seen to date, including the contemporary Shrek, but they are flawed. Aki Ross, the main character, has a beautiful and soulful face, but her mouth seems chiseled on her chin, her teeth seem to be planted too far out and look like a fish's, her eyes are not wet but rather seem built of a hard plastic, her hair (each of the 60,000 threads individually animated) looks like a synthetic piece. Her body is too long, and her, uhm, bottom seems all wrong. Still she has an intriguing, star-like presence. Other characters, unfortunately are very cartoonish. All suffer from stiff bodies, their limbs attached to rigid torsos, as you see on plastic toys.
By the way, the movie is not really computer generated. Rather the computer is used as a very powerful, knowledge based, colored pencil, under the control of human artists. The resulting visual experience reminds one of a very detailed drawing. Live actors were used to help the animators use the computer to render the movie's characters. No wonder, the whole thing cost 100 million dollars to make.
The storyline is built around a complex spiritual core, which is revealed little by little in the movie. (If you haven't yet seen the movie you may want to jump to the next paragraph.) It proposes that each life bearing planet holds a spirit in the ground out of which each life form is born from and to which it returns after death. These planetary spirits are formed from some kind of wave, and, significantly, they are incompatible and deadly to each other. A fragment of an alien planet destroyed by nuclear war, has fallen on earth and has disgorged many deceased individual spirits of that planet, which move around like phantoms and lay waste to much of our life sphere.
Well, this is a rather complicated background for most of the movie going public, not to say slightly derogatory of the Christian world view. Star War's ""the force be with you"" was a much simpler proposition. The joy in Final Fantasy is in taking in the beauty of the realistic but completely human-made world it depicts. Less spirituality and more laughs and sexual tension would certainly have made it more successful. This movie takes itself too seriously for its own good. Shrek's creators were smarter in this sense.
I understand that Final Fantasy has been a financial flop. This is a great pity. Personally I would love to see Aki Ross again in a few years time, at 10 times better rendering technology. If a movie deserves a sequence, this is one. The movie's creators must realize that they own much more than the first photo realistic picture in human history, they also own the first human-made movie star. Let's hope they will be able to build on top of this amazing achievement.",1008028800,2,3360,4.824956672443674

They spent millions on computer imagery and 25 cents on the screenplay.  Although the movie is supposed to be science fiction/adventure, the ""action"" scenes (in which humans battle alien ghosts) are some of the most boring action scenes I've ever seen.  Hard to say how they got so dull--but the timing is way off, the editing is very bad, so the ""action"" fizzles.  The story is mostly similar to ""Princess Mononoke"", a far superior bit of animation, but ""Final Fantasy"" reheats Mononoke's mysticism, spirits and eco-consciousness--unfortunately, in ""Fantasy"" there's no dramatic tension or likeable characters, so who cares.  A lot of the action scenes are stolen from ""Aliens""--the team of well-equipped military types fighting aliens with great big guns is a completely theft from ""Aliens""--but here they're boring, boring, boring.  When major characters die, I felt nothing.  As for the animation, the characters look very real when they're standing still.  But when Aki moves, she looks so stiff, like a robot--even in ""Toy Story"" characters moved more naturally.  Apparently 42 programmers spent a year animating the thousands of hairs on Aki's head, and she's got a great hairdo.  Her face is cute.  But the facial expressions on all the characters are laughably bad, like extremely stiff, amateurish acting.  Don't buy this--get ""Princess Mononoke"" instead, and wait until the day when photo-realistic computer animation is coupled with likeable human characters and a compelling story.",1007683200,5,1681,5.325757575757576

1321715,5,B00003CY5C,"In what is surely to go down in history as the pinnacle of computer animation, ""Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within"" has a deep storyline and characters you end up caring about, just like in the Final Fantasy video games.  But the similarities between the movie and the video games end there, the story of ""The Spirits Within"" revolves around a race of alien spirits called the Phantoms who have crashed on Earth and have the ability to take a person's spirit, causing the planet to become a wasteland and sending humanity on the brink of extinction.  The voice acting is excellent, as is the real star of the film, the animation, with Ming-Na, Alec Baldwin, Donald Sutherland, James Woods, Ving Rhames, Steve Buscemi, Peri Gilpen, and Keith David (who was the voice of Spawn in the animated HBO Spawn series) lending their voices to some unforgetable characters.  James Woods is exceptional as General Hein, a hell-bent for revenge soldier willing to go to any cost to destroy the Phantoms.  The animation is undescribable, Aki (voiced by Ming-Na), and Dr. Sid (voiced by Donald Sutherland), look so real they could almost pass for real actors.  The second disc features hours of extras like the Final Fantasy Thriller video that will leave you laughing your head off, and profiles on the characters and the actors who voice them.  Truly a movie that should not be missed, I recommend this movie to any sci-fi or animation fan, or a fan of the video game series.

The survivors of the initial onslaught have retreated to barrier cities built to protect the inhabitants of Earth from the marauding invaders. But the few cities around the globe are in decline and time is running out.
Yet, the sprit of humankind is resilient and embodied in the brilliant and beautiful Dr. Aki Ross. Determined and capable, Aki strives as Earthfs last hope against extinction.
With the guidance of her scientific mentor, Dr. Sid, and the aid of the Deep Eyes military squadron led by the courageous Captain Gray Edwards, Aki races to save both the Earth and herself.
Terminally infected by an alien, Aki holds the key to discovering the secret to defeating the alien predators. But her quest is jeopardized by the militant opposition of General Hein, who plots to unleash a massive space cannon that will annihilate the aliens and possibly the Earth.
As the clock ticks down, Aki searches within her dreams to find an answer to the alien mystery, while scouring the Earth to collect the eight spirit waves she believes will save the planet.
Fighting both the enemy within and the scheming General Hein, who would destroy the Earth in order to save it, Aki valiantly pursues her Final Fantasy.

I mean, being a big final fantasy game fan, this film has nothing to do with the general idea of final fantasy. If the film was titled something else I believe it woud have done better than it did, but naming it final fantasy gave fans and movie goers a preset idea of what to expect or hope for out of this movie and we were robbed!

1321749,5,B00003CY5C,"Year 2065, planet Earth faces what almost everyone believes to be an alien invasion, one that consists of phantoms that suck a person's soul upon touching him/her. In the face of things, the military are pushing for a violent solution: shooting the Zeus cannon upon the meteor crater left behind after the arrival of the phantoms. Meanwhile, scientists Dr. Sid (modelled after Donald Sutherland, and also voiced by him) and Aki are running out of time in their efforts to find ""all the spirits"" needed to come up with an antidote to neutralize the effect of the evil phantoms, with a major handicap: they face incredible oposition from the Earth's ruling Council and the military because they have no proof but their faith and their hard work backing their redemption theory.
This animated flick will have you on the edge far more than most 2001 human-acted movies. The animation work put behind it is simply amazing: this movie raised the standard by which computer-animated movies are to be judged technically. The best sample of this is, in my opinion, Sid, the scientist character whose realism with his white hair and his wrinkles leaves you doubting whether he is indeed an artificial character.
Beside the animation, the script was also a brilliant on, falling within the ranks of fantasy movies. Since ""The Matrix"" I hadn't seen such an excellent movie of this kind. Rent it or buyt it, and enjoy it!",1007164800,,1408,4.870833333333334

1321751,4,B00003CY5C,"It's hard to overstate how much I enjoyed this movie.  I marveled at the production, and kept commenting to my wife throughout the movie how amazingly realistic the animation was.  The entire movie, as nearly as I could tell, was computer generated, but there are occasions when you will swear you're looking at live actors.  ""Heavy Metal"" meets the microchip.
The plot centers around a futuristic New York City which, along with the rest of the world, has been devastated by ghostly alien invaders who literally devour the spirits of any living creature they touch.  This feature makes for some very disturbing scenes as various characters meet their respective demises.  The protagonist is an attractive scientist whose mission is to find and gather eight living spirits from around the world to complete an energy wave to destroy the invaders.  She spends most of the movie teamed with a buff commando captain (voiced by Alec Baldwin), who provides cover fire as she goes about her task.  Needless to say, some romantic energy develops over the course of the story, but you would expect no less.
Meanwhile, the ""bad guys"" include not only the very dangerous space critters, but also a maniacal general who wants to prove that his big guns are more than a match for the aliens, and he's willing to risk everything to make his point.  Overall, I thought the story line was engaging if a little predictable.  There were a number of wonderfully suspenseful scenes, and several great depictions of valor and self sacrifice.  Again, though, the most gripping aspect of this movie is its stunning visual appearance.  Extremely well done and entertaining.",1007078400,,1650,4.963636363636364
1321752,5,B00003CY5C,"The movie was good but the DVD is outstanding! It is PACKED with so many extras. After watching this movie on the big screen, I was left with a burning question: ""How did they do THAT???"" Now my questions are answered. They show you how it's all done, and there is even a running commentary on how things were built and how they were developed, all along the whole movie. And FF gamers will be able to appreciate the trivia that pops up here and there.
Seeing how they developed it from scratch into the jaw-dropping graphics of the final version inspired in me total awe and reverence for the techno wizards who brought these pixels to life. I appreciate it even more now, knowing how difficult and painstakingly and lovingly the artists crafted all the characters, props, and sceneries and brought them to life. There is an incredible wealth of information on the DVD. I've spent five hours watching it and am still not done yet! And the outtakes - they are not to be missed!! The ""history"" chapter (on the first incarnation of FF and the Gray Project) will satisfy even the most die-hard of fans.
All in all, this is one movie where the DVD far outshines the movie itself. I highly recommend it. By the way, if you didn't understand the ending (like everyone else!), you will find the answer in the DVD. A must-see.",1006992000,,1318,4.518828451882845

1321754,2,B00003CY5C,"I was tempted to buy this movie because I want to support computer animation as it develops out of its infancy.  But I decided to rent Final Fantasy first after losing $25 bucks on Titan A.E.
From a technical perspective, the film film is hit and miss.  Group shots and anything shown from a distance work very well. Backrounds and ships also worked.  Close ups of characters rarely worked, though some were better than others. It was obvious some characters (the old scientist) were paid more attention to.
From a story standpoint, it was pure goofy anime. I consider myself a typical American viewer, and I will tell anyone interested that I think ships that look like big animals or any other animal related themes like the spirits in this film are just plain old silly.
Computer animated movies would have a much better chance of mass popularity if their makers could license a known actor to ""star"" - my choice would be Bruce Lee.",1006819200,2,935,4.654545454545454

1321819,5,B00003CY5C,"To say that this film broke new ground would be like saying that water is wet.  However, aside from the stunning visuals (during a few scenes you have to remind yourself this is animation), the film begins a new era of trans-pacific cooperation in animation.  Japanese animation or ""Anime"" has long been popular in the U.S., but this film combines the work of writers and animators from both nations to create a superlative work that draws from both cultures.
Some viewers have had difficulty following the plot, or found it a bit ""video game-ish"", but most of these I've spoken to have been able to enjoy the film after learning a bit more about Japanese culture.  Not wanting to reveal the whole story, I'll simply point out that most Japanese people practice Shinto, an animistic religion that believes that everything has a spirit, and that many of these spirits can manifest themselves physically (or pseudo-physically) and can help or harm people if they wish.
While I will not say there are no weak points in this film, it is still one of the best animated films I have seen.  The character development is good, especially for the secondaries.  For example, two of the adult characters express their love for each other like adolescents.  This is a subtle reminder of just how long the war for Earth has lasted, as is suggests that neither had a normal (or happy) childhood.
Get this DVD.  Find the biggest screen you can find and watch it.  A few days later watch it again.  It does keep getting better.  Oh, and remember to look for a few visual homages to other films.",1006646400,,1578,4.664259927797834

1321821,2,B00003CY5C,"We saw it with Mario Brothers, with Street Fighter, and with Fatal Fury. When will we learn that a movie based on a game just won't measure up? Well...I suppose with Final Fantasy it's a little different. The games are, needless to say, the cream of the crop. No other RPG is as good as the Final Fantasy series. The graphics are astounding, the storylines are involving, the characters are colorful.
This is what fools you into thinking the movie will be great. Save for the CGs (which are just incredible!), the movie has nothing that the games do. The storyline was nothing more than a recycled version of the plot from FFVII, and the characters have absolutely no personality. Unlike the favorites from the games, these characters have no distinguishing personality traits. They don't get a whole lot of screen time, so you can't get attached to them the way you can with the game characters, and they all seem the same anyway:angry and pessimistic. Absolutly no imagination was put into the villian either-he was just Seifer in Sephiroth's clothing. And it doesn't help that the script was about as colorful as a 1920's film. With such bland dialogue, how can one determine the personality of any character?
The audience doesn't even see a good portion of the plot. At the start of the movie, the audience pretty much drops in on Aki Ross as she stalks stealthily about some resticted area in search of...what? You don't really find out for another 30 minutes or so. There isn't enough information in the beginning of the movie to really know what's going on, who's in on it, and what the whole problem is. Unless you're an avid player of the games, you're just an outsider looking in.
Another thing that annoyed me was the title, which was a bit misleading. If I had watched the movie without knowing the title, I never would have affiliated it with the Final Fantasy series (that is until words like ""Gaea"" and ""lifestream"" started popping up). There was nothing ""Fantasy"" about it. I started watching the movie expecting to see a few spells, a summon or two (what's Final Fantasy without Bahamut?), maybe a little world travel. Did I see any? Nope. Not a bit. I saw a couple of cool firearms, but nothing that resembled a weapon out of any of the games. The movie lacked the imagination of the RPG, and I found it disappointing.
But I think the very worst part of the movie is the end, and I'll sum it up for you: Everybody dies. Aside from our heroine, everyone is reduced to ashes so quickly that there was little significance to the characters' existence in the first place. Very disappointing.
All in all, The ""Final Fantasy"" movie did not live up to the name that its predecessing games created. Perhaps one day, a game-based movie will be more than ""okay,"" but in the meantime, we'll call ""Final Fantasy"" another valiant attempt.",1006473600,,2843,4.665338645418327
1321822,2,B00003CY5C,"The CG was some of the best I have ever seen although some of the character animations where pretty stiff. Unfortunately the whole experience was let down by an extremely silly story, the thought of the earth having a spirit makes the story more fairy tale than sci-fi action which is what I expected. The action  scenes are average at best and not in the same league as films like Aliens or Starship Troopers. The bloodless battle scenes are obviously geared to a younger audience but they would not be unable to understand the story with its large plot gaps so I'm not sure what the films target audience is supposed to be. I would have rated this film much higher had the story not been so lame, it is really only worth while watching for the CG effects.",1006473600,,757,4.446043165467626
1321823,4,B00003CY5C,"On its release, Final Fantasy garnered mostly negative reviews for its story, but almost everyone agreed that this was a beautiful movie.  Having finally had a chance to judge for myself, I believe the critics were overly harsh.  The story is fairly straightforward and uncomplicated, but by no means stupid.  I found myself drawn in to the mystery of the phantom invasion, and appreciated the message that sometimes there are better ways to solve a problem than by simply blasting away at it.  I would have appreciated more character background detail, but at least each one was given a distinctive personality.
And, as advertised, this is a gorgeous film.  While the level of detail on the characters isn't so far advanced that you become convinced they're human, the expressiveness of the faces and body language are mind-blowing.  The characters convey the same levels of warmth and life as those in Toy Story or Monsters Inc, but without the exagerated features.  The production has such depth you forget they're just computer images, and sit back and get caught up in the action.
I also appreciated the wealth of extra features on this DVD.  Let's face it, with a movie like this, there's more to wonder about how they did it, and the various commentary tracks and making-of features should satisfy all but the most demanding of fans.  But no matter how great the extra features are, they only matter if the movie is worth watching.  In this case, it definitely is.",1006300800,3,1471,4.848

The acting, well left me cold. Let's face it a guy in front of a computer screen is not the same as a actor in front of a movie screen. Subtle nuances is what was lacking. I remember a Saturday cartoon called Tarzan. When he climbed up a tree it looked totally believable. I found out later that they had shot on video of a stunt man climbing scaffolding and they copied that. I wish they had studied the actors faces like that. I would say something about the script but there really isn't much to say. Anyway, this is still a decent movie not a great movie. Rent it before you buy it.",1006128000,,763,4.232876712328767
1321826,2,B00003CY5C,"I was looking forward to renting the DVD of this movie, but what a letdown. The animation is crude and poorly executed. I mean, seriously, what good animator does not know that human beings have tongues, and that without them they cannot speak properly? The eyes, lips and limbs move, the hair looks great, but the faces look like what happened to Bugs Bunny, Donald Duck and Tom and Jerry when the animation work was moved to the Phillipines to save money. FACES HAVE MUSCLES and if they had devoted half the work they put into hair into facial muscles, the animation would have looked halfway convincing. Sorry, but this one doesn't rate more than 2 stars. Toy Story was a much more convincing technical achievement than this.,",1005868800,,729,4.703125
1321827,3,B00003CY5C,"Well, I'm not going to explain the story because most of the other reviews do that fine, I'm just offering my opinion. Being a fan of the Final Fantasy games, I was both excited and aprehensive when they announced they were making a movie. Actually when I heard, I had only just finished playing Final Fantasy VIII, but in the time before the film came out, I managed to finish VII and IX. Anyhow, the movie was as I predicted when I saw the trailer, dissapointing. As soon as I found out that it was to be set on Earth and in the future, I knew it was doomed even from then. The animation looked great however, so I thought I'd see it, and at least give it a chance, because the story of the games were so good (usually) that I couldn't pass judgement until I had seen it myself. Unfortunately when seeing the movie, and although one half of me was desperately trying to make up excuses for it, I really couldn't accept that they had allowed this to be made. For one thing, setting it on Earth, and in the future, thus putting it on ""our"" timeline, unlike the games which were just ""some world"" in ""some weird time"", which worked perfectly. Instead of being nearly anything like a Final Fantasy story, it turned out to be a cheesy Sci Fi flick. I knew also that critics would just love to chew up a film like this. Anything with a large amount of special effects, that doesn't have a story to match becomes a sitting duck for hateful reviewists. And unfortunately, Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within was not worth defending. Also the directing was pretty pathetic. A big mistake was to make the movie like a holywood movie, whereas the film would have probably turned out OK, maybe even good, if they had stuck to the Japanese style. The music was pathetic as well. Why they didn't get Nobuo Uemetsu to do the score is beyond my understanding. Basically, they got too caught up with making the movie look really good, and forgot about the plot. Also it would have been much better if they made the characters look like the anime based characters which the game characters are more like, instead of making them try to look like real people. Anyway, to sum it up, they seemed to have gotten plot depth mixed up with special effects depth. It seemed to me they weren't trying to make a movie... just win the best special effects award.",1005868800,,2332,4.425581395348837

But once i got that out of my head i started to enjoy it.  the effects in this was great.  Instead of watching the movie as a whole..i found myself watching the shirts move as they walked..and watching more of how well they made this movie that watching the movie itself.  I had to watch it twice in order to catch everything.  After watching it the 2nd time.  I was impressed with it.  It was a good movie.,1005782400,2,572,4.2407407407407405
1321915,3,B00003CY5C,"The year is 2065 and Earth is a battle ground between Humans and Phantom invaders. Dr. Aki Ross is a scientist on the verge of discovering the secrets of these ""spirits"" and restore the Earth back to the hands of humanity, through channeling 8 spirits to provide balance to Earth Gaia. However, General Hein, who backs the military wing of humanity, wants to use a space weapon called the ""Zeus"" gun to destroy the core of this alien infestation, a meteor crater home to the rock in which the spirits landed on. Aki feels that doing what the General is willing to do will destroy the Earth and Hein thinks her idea is plain lunacy and will never work. Meanwhile, Dr. Aki is having these dreams that are building together pieces that will eventually solve the mystery of these spirit invaders, but time is soon running out.
Pros: The animation is something that is simply incredible. Everything from the body movements to the facial expressions make it look like you are watching real people. It makes it even more natural to have computer generated characters because they seem to fit better in CGI worlds than humans do.
Dr. Aki Ross is a sympathetic character and you eventually begin to feel empathy for her character. However, she is not given any 3D depth and often is pushed to the side to showcase the technical aspects of this movie.
James Woods, who plays General Hein and Donald Sutherland as Aki mentor Dr. Sid are excellent. Woods, who always seems to play hard headed sinister character was perfectly cast as was Sutherland, whose voice would often remind me of a professor that I once had.
Cons: The plot is horrible. There are these 8 spirits, but what are these spirits? What are the differences between spirit one and spirit eight? What is the silly notion of Gaia? Such things are not adequately explained in the movie, causing confusion. I guess they are explained in the Final Fantasy games?
The ending was also roughly 15 minutes too long. It tended to drag on and on, without adding anything to the movie. It was a downer and lowered the overall enjoyment of the movie.
The Cheesiness of the movie also caused rolling eyes. While there is no emotions, there is this ""oh I love you stuff"", straight out of 1950's harlequin romance novels.
There is no emotional bond with the characters. They are there, they interact, they crack some jokes, shoot some guns and some of them die. You get as much emotionally involved as an episode of Pokemon.
Overall, while blown away by the SFX, I cannot recommend this movie, because it is not film. I'm sure the cinematic experience will not be the same as if it were seen on DVD, so I recommend a matinee....Rating: C",1005696000,,2675,4.6455696202531644

The movie story is probably to thick that is true, it was in fact made for intelligent people who realize that we are in danger of hurting our planet by the things we push into it.  Final Fantasy is about fantasy and the last time I checked New York (no matter how battered), Tucson and the rest of the world is still here.

Therefore, relating the game to the movie is difficult for me to actually grasp, and die-hard fans will probably have a better relationship with it.  Still, I'd rather concentrate on the other aspects of the film.
First what's been hyped:  CGI.  Yes, a real great effort.  In the commentary of the DVD they said that they were learning new things along the way; you can see the characters go from slightly stiff to more natural actions as the movie progresses.  The facial expressions as well as the movement of the mouths for speaking wasn't natural -- but honestly, I have yet to see better in any animation.  A really incredible effort.
The story:  well, I can say it's definitely not a kid's film.  It reminds me of Alien without all the gore and more of a spiritual aspect.  I have to say though, that I still don't understand the whole concept of the film and feel that I have to watch it again to completely grasp the storyline; it is a bit confusing upon only one viewing.  The basic premise, if you don't know a thing about it, is there are these aliens called ""phantoms"" roaming the earth, killing people by mere touch, therefore causing the earth to undergo great stress as well as evacuation.  There are two options to kill these beings: first being the Zeus cannon, which literally blows it away, but is frowned upon by the intelligence group who wants to match it's ""wave frequency"" instead.  The Zeus cannon would probably destroy the spirit of the earth causing more harm than good.  You have the group that is peaceful and bases their options on theories (the good guys) and you have the bad group who is a bitter general who wants to merely go in and blow anything away.  The climax is excellent, but I have to say the ending was a tremendous let down.  I wanted to see more of what happened when it did (but obviously can't tell you because I'd spoil it for ya.)
It is a fairly dark film with plenty of action, aggressive scenes and really cool characters.  Although I'm afraid that not once did I forget the characters were not CGI, rather I was amazed at how fluid their actions were, but sometimes not.  Sci-fi fans will probably be thrilled as well as Final Fantasy fans, but people first exposed to this series (media-wise) might be confused and not get the point.  I think I'll have to watch it again to really get it, but also, I'm the more optimistic reviewer; some people may not have that patience.
Nice eye candy, but the story is so detailed for die-hard fans, it may go over other people's heads.",1005264000,6,2712,4.552577319587629

1321997,5,B00003CY5C,"Final Fantasy is one of the most impressive animations that I've ever seen so far.  The story line is very strong and most impressive.  It is a good idea that the creator of Final Fantasy stayed away from the story line of the games.  This movie is not just for anime fans but also for movie fans of all age (except for those under the parental warning) because it is able to reach that other age group in its story line.
One of the reviewer commented on the line that the creators of Final Fantasy used to market the movie.  This is the line: ""Fantasy becomes reality"", which I find to be a perfect pick up line.  Because to us ghosts are just fantasies but in the movie the fantasy of ghosts becomes a reality for the remaining survivors of the world.  I would advise anyone who watch this movie to understand the story behind the mission and to understand what it means when they say the ""the spirits within"".  I've bought this DVD and to be honest its one of the best investments I've made.  There's no big robot smashing another robot or destroying cities, (which I might say I do enjoy), but it's an intriguing story about the human race as a whole trying to survive a catastrophic event.
I urge you to buy this DVD even if you're not an anime fan, trust me you wouldn't regret the investment.",1005177600,,1299,4.338842975206612

Characters look like dolls, but are they really acting?

It is really excellent work of tecnology and computer art, but that's all. It is far behind to be a real moive.

It looks so real and I always thought that they're real humans not animation while watching it. About story, it's good..not REALLY good but good enough for entertaining. It might not be suitable to people who have impression that ""Cartoon is only for kids"". The story also reflects alot of Eastern culture thought.. (and that might be the reason why people in the western world don't get it!!). Don't expect to see action, bloody fighting scene because it almost has none. But the producer put some believe about nature spirit and tried to communicate to audiences that All living organisms on Earth have spirits and don't destroy them. (good for Earth day campaign though) Really good story. My only disturbance is..our hero looks like Ben Affleck..and sorry buddy, you're not my favorite actor...

The transfer from the silver screen to the DVD is flawless. No rainbows effects, colors are vibrant, the menus are one of the best I ever saw in a DVD and it is packaged with TONS of extras to make you watch this over and over. For a reasonable price, you get not one but two DVD's. One is packaged with the movie and not only one movie but two versions of the movie. Three commentaries audio tracks, theatrical trailers and the best of all...Dolby Digital with all the effects included. The other DVD has EXTRAS like a music video featuring Thriller. A documentary and profiles of the characters and vehicles, screensavers, more trailers, an editor for one of the scenes in the movie, and much more..
The movie itself is pretty cool and I don't understand why it didn't make it at the box office. I feel sorry for SQUARE PICTURES because they made a GREAT job with this movie and with this DVD and I hope they will make more projects like this, with better plots and more character development.

Was this story totally weak?! YES!
I guess you can't have it all.  This movie was semi-fun.  The first 15 minutes were full of beyond compare ""eye-candy"".  After which I was pretty bored.  I have to admit that despite the great look of the movie & the cool action sequences I actually fell asleep watching this one.  And, yes I did see this in the theater!
This movie is great for the 13 to 16 year old crowd.  Otherwise the rest of us semi and full blown grown ups will probabley walk away feeling more interested in one of the movies we saw a preview of before the film started.",1004918400,2,747,4.3
1322091,2,B00003CY5C,"Frankly, this movie was awful. It begins with a pretty cool premise - a war on an alien planet results in the destruction of said planet, and a chunk of this planet is launched through space, crashing into earth. This asteroid brings with it the ghosts of the planet's deceased denizens, which proceed to ravage humanity. Fast forward a generation or two, and the stage is set for Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within.
At first, things looks promising enough - the visual effects are pretty amazing, although the people look a little too ""realistic,"" to the point of eeriness. As soon as the first corny lines of narration are uttered, however, it all goes downhill. The entire movie seems utterly formulaic, from the dialogue and stereotypical characters, right on up to the plot and its thought-provoking themes, the latter of which quickly degenerates into a sort of new-age mysticism so completely lacking in any substance that even I, for all my pantheistic inclinations, was unable to salvage any benefit from it.
Perhaps the greatest insult is the inexplicable application of the Final Fantasy name to this film. The film in no way merits the Final Fantasy license - About the only recognizable homage to the Final Fantasy tradition is the inclusion of a Dr. ""Sid,"" which will mean something to the fans. Frankly, I think Hironobu Sakaguchi made it a Final Fantasy film just to give it some extra credibility. Unfortunately, it has instead become a blight on the franchise's strong track record. I'd like to call particular attention to a most inexcusable offense - the film wasn't even scored by Nobuo Uematsu! Uematsu, of course, scored every major FF game under the sun, and his name is synonymous with the franchise, arguably moreso than Sakaguchi's.
Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within is the type of movie that you might watch once to kill a couple hours, but its worth for repeat viewings is virtually nil. It's been compared to such contemporary films as The Matrix and Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, touted as a real thought provoker. If your brainpan is filled with anything of thicker consistency than tapioca pudding, however, the only thought on your mind is likely to be, ""I wish this movie would end already, I gotta use the can.""",1004918400,,2248,4.887434554973822
1322092,3,B00003CY5C,"The Final Fantasy series started out as an 8-bit Nintendo game, evolved to later consoles, and eventually spawned several truly great games and began a revolution in the genre.  That's the good news.  The bad news is that, so far, Final Fantasy still has yet to leave the world of video games, and that includes this film.
Don't get me wrong--the film has plenty of wonderful elements.  The visuals are obviously the best you'll find in a film of this style, the story hook is an engaging blend of traditionally Eastern and Western ideas, and several of the scenes are well written, with good dialogue.  The problem is that all of these small triumphs aren't integrated together into an effective movie.
The biggest failure in this regard has to be seen in the absolutely terrible pacing of the film.  The story takes tremendous jumps in time, spacing them with long, slow periods (the scene that comes to mind would be the two lead characters having their romantic encounter in outer space), ultimately making the story itself very difficult to connect with.  The poor character development doesn't help much in this regard--all the way through the end of the movie, I never stopped thinking of the characters in terms of their voices (oh, look, Roz just died--and there goes Steve).  The characters are never firmly established and no real effort is made to forge any connections between them and the audience, which ends up leaving me feeling disconnected from the movie.
Truth be told, a video game is exactly what this particular movie feels like.  You can pick out spots that look exactly like cutscenes, as well as sequences that would seem to fit well for a game interlude (the initial search of the city by Aki, the mission into the crater, etc.).  This would also explain the lacking character development--in a video game, you tend to get attached to the characters simply by way of the fact that you're constantly taking care of them and keeping them from being devoured by monsters.  When you take out that degree of personal connection that the game provides, you end up with a distant, difficult to relate to cast of characters in a plot that seems to lurch from instant to instant.
So how much will you enjoy this film?  Well, that probably depends on what you're looking for.  If you want a story that's going to pick you up and help you forget what's going on around you for an hour and a half, you're probably in the wrong place.  If you simply want to see some breathtaking visuals and play with some quality DVD extras, however, then this movie should do it for you.  There's probably a substantial number of people who will be dissatisfied with the plot or the ending (which just screams video game), but overall, this film is probably still a good way to kill an evening.",1004918400,,2794,4.6871165644171775
1322093,2,B00003CY5C,"This was almost a real movie, just like the characters in the film-almost real.  Muddled with hype, and over-glorifying of the bestselling Sony Playstation video games, this film falls far from the mark of making a good impression.  Starting with a fairly interesting beginning, the film slowly but surely begins to teeter off into literally nothing as it goes on.  Alec Baldwin, Donald Sutherland, and other greats make not so worthwhile voice over appearences, the characters strike the viewer as mostly incincere beings with no real emotions. For instance a scene in which the ship seems to be blowing up from the inside out, Sutherland's character, the doctor, calls out "" No Aki, don't go, its too dangerous.""  Whereupon, he does absolutely nothing to stop her from going to the rear of the ship.  So, in retrospect, the movie offers little that would differ from actually watching a video game being played before your eyes, with characters that have as much underdeveloped and boring script as appears in most video games.  One plus, the movie does have excellent computer graphics, and the characters appear quite life-like in appearence, but does not make up for their overbearlingly boring drawl that seems to spill out of their mouth in every scene.",1004832000,,1260,5.0047846889952154
1322094,4,B00003CY5C,"I'm not going to review the movie, because if your looking at the DVD its because you've either seen it already, or want to see it, right? And by the way, The title is the only thing really final fantasy about it.
For the price this DVD is perfect, you get two discs.  If you really liked the movie you not only get to watch it, but find out everything and anything about it.  I was really surprised how much stuff was in this packaged.  The scene editor is cheesy, don't excpect something really great out of that bonus, but the many different commentaries and making off stuff makes this a DVD you can spend 5+ hours on.
The only bad thing about it is that in some peoples eyes this movie isn't very good.  I'll admit there are some moments when the jokes are just to unnatural, or the people don't like quite right, but the story is there, the graphics are there, and with this DVD set you can see the amazing amount of detail that went into it, I appreciate the movie more now.",1004832000,,981,4.229946524064171

1322097,5,B00003CY5C,"On release, Final Fantasy remained in the top spot for two days. On it's third day it was overtaken by Legally Blonde and The Score, placing it in third place within the box office scene. On it's 12th day, Fantasy was buried under a pile led by Jurassic Park 3 and America's Sweetheart's that were competing to rake in the cash. Also at the time in full throttle: Shrek, Tomb Raider, Scary Movie 2, Dr Doolitle 2, Cat's and Dog's, and even A.I. Soon after Planet of the Apes appeared, and Final Fantasy was no more.
  In short, Final Fantasy has become Hollywood's newest victim to bad timing.
  Many things have been said lightly, and thrown harshly at Final Fantasy: the spirit's within, but when something is done so well, there is no room for bashing. Computer Rendering has never been so breathtaking and rarely am I this pleased with how much work was put into a film, nor appreciated it more.
  The story, I must admit, does have ""the"" good versus evil story line that is used in most every film...including Star Wars. Here's a blow, take a look at the highest grossing and most loved films and you will see that they all have that story line. It's in our religeon's, it's in our history, it's in our movies, it's in our blood: Go figure. Also there is complaint of the dialogue between character's being to simple and ""everyday"". Who would of thought that people speak in simple, every day term's. Heaven forbid we say, ""Will I save the Earth before it's too late? I don't know how much time I have left.""
  Aki is driven by her dreams and a rapidly growing, cancer-like, phantom host that lives within her. As I do not personally believe in the religeon used in the film (i.e. Fantasy), I compared it to my own belief's and was astounded with the similarities. How refreshing to see something that has belief in itself.
  Also, another thing I liked is how (even though people complain about the rest of the film) the ending retreat's from Hollywood's simple minded closures. There is no happy ending here my friends, rather a hope for something better.
  This is the best looking dvd in my growing collection. The sound is wonderful and alive, though I would have liked a dts track. No complaint's mainly because the 5.1 digital track does everything it is supposed to. Final fantasy is flat out reference material.
  When you have your friend's or family over and have just finished your no-bake cheese cake, your going to want to whip out the old dvd remote and show off your system. (That's the way I am, I don't know about you). Usually for sound you would pop in Gladiator, Saving Private Ryan, or The Matrix to show your speakers off. For picture you would get out Unbreakable, again the Matrix, or even Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. No more my friend, because now you have a 2 disc'er that will do more than tickle their senses.
  As far as extra's, you can't...Can Not!...get much better. At least to date. Though Snow White is close and Ep. 1 a tie, you will be entertained by Final Fantasy's storage of fact's and fiction's. If your an average film nut like me, your knowledge will be tripled and your respect for the film maker's will be beyond word's.
  Some advice, do not check out the features before watching the film. The extra's take you nearly frame by frame in the creative process, and could spoil the fun!

Not least among these is the disastrous voice-casting of Ming-Na (formerly Ming-Na Wen, but apparently graduated to single-name fabulousness - like Cher), an exceptionally inexpressive actress, as the heroine. No doubt Meryl Streep was unavailable but I can't believe that no one better could be found.

1322192,5,B00003CY5C,"Perhaps the reason for this movie not performing well at the box-office is because it never was well suited for the masses in terms of the US market even though I believe its a modified version of Japanese Animation.  Unmodified it would have most likely done much worse, cost more to the consumer to buy the DVD or tape, a limited market product.
Many may state the storyline is difficult to understand and I would agree, all the more reason why, unlike most movies, this movie is worth owning rather than renting or buying on the secondary market.  The extras on the DVD are a most welcome addition and rather extensive compared to most if not all.
In the event they should release an international version that would appeal to me more and would definitely be on my buy list.  Unlike most movies, regardless of its success, they will appear on the secondary market in rather large numbers because, understandably, most consumers, including myself, can't justify owning/keeping the movie for multiple viewing, Final Fantasy is an exception to this rule in my collection.

1322193,3,B00003CY5C,"The movement and attention to detail of the human characters is truly breathtaking. No less care was taken in creating the spectacular environments, ships, effects and lighting in the rest of the film. Its an unprecedented achievement.
  Earth has been overrun by strange spirit creatures who have devastated the planet. Their translucent bodies roam the skies and move as comfortably through solid matter as they do air. Their movements when passing through humans are instantly deadly.  A weapon has been developed to destroy the invaders but it use has the potential to destroy the energizing force of the earth.  Two scientists believe they are close to creating a new weapon that effecively neutralizes the enemy and will leave the earth in tact. The experimental weapon is almost complete but requires them to find the last two of eight spirits that make up the dangerous entities. When all are gathered they can create a wave that cancels out their power by duplicating an image of their energy pattern. Unfortunately General Hein (voiced by James Woods) believes there is no time to wait and wishes to immediately deploy the Zeus canon disregarding the risk to the planet. Dr. Aki (Ming Na Wen) and Dr. Sid assisted by a small marine force are in a race against the clock to save the earth from potential destruction from the aliens and their own weapon.
  The voice acting is very good as is the emotional expressiveness of the animated facial expressions and body language. The story which I felt was going to be a little metaphysical, esoteric and difficult, turned out to be very easy and straight forward. Perhaps only the last few minutes were slightly obscure . While not incredible, I found the story very watchable and kept me interested through the duration. In the end I was quite happy I didn't pass on it as I did when it was in the theaters.  The DVD is packed with an abundance of extras. While I wished I had time to hear the director's commentary, I passed instead to watch the 'making of' documentary. As it does not give any important plot points away, it might be a good primer to watch first. It brings some good insight into the film's creation and adds some nice details to watch out for when seeing the film for the first time.

However, even more important to me are the idea's conveyed in the movie.  Although I'm not sure I agree that the Earth is alive, the movie touched my spiritual side in a very positive way that most movies fail to do today.  So many writers/directors seem afraid to stray too far from the standard God and Heaven belief and they fail to reach people like me.  Even the greatest sci-fi flicks of recent times (The Matrix) avoid the spiritual question entirely.

But the plot is awful - there is little in the way of suspense, emotion, or intrigue, and the ending was very disappointing. The CG characters and acting are wooden, and due to some shortcomings in animation, especially with their eyes, they never come across as anything other than puppets (the more cartoonish ""Toy Story"" characters did a better job of appearing life-like).
The story is very mystical in nature, and since it obeys no rules and its ""revelations"" make no sense, you can't invest in it or be rewarded by it.
Bottom-line: If you're a CG fan and must see it, rent it.  If you're after an enjoyable movie with a decent story, skip it.",1004227200,3,854,4.655629139072848
1322196,1,B00003CY5C,"Squaresoft has truly sold out this time. This abomination of a motion picture is so terrible, it's unbelieved. I love the Final Fantasy video games, each game is rich in storyline and character development. This movie however, is an absolute insult to the series. Fans looking for a movie that would do justice to their beloved seires will not find it here. This is just another way to milk more money out of the FF series. It's insulting to the game's fans, and Sqaure themselves. Their picture company is going out of buisness too, guess you know why.......
Basically, this film screams eye candy. The graphic animation is gorgeous, I'll admit that. Still, this is only the shell to an empty, hollow inside. This film's beauty is only on the outside. Once you look deeper, you'll find a truly depressing experiance. This is a nothing more than a cheezy sci-fi flick no better than any other. The only reason it has any appeal at all is due to it's graphic animation. If it was not animated, and real people were playing, then no one would care.
The film's storyline is more confusing than FF8's junction system. You meet useless characters, barely any plot twists, and an overlong experiance that will make you want to play frisbee with this dvd. Aside from the graphics, there's no redeeming value whatsoever, it's a long, painful experiance.
The diolouge is awful, with no emotion whatsoever. After playing games like FF7 and FF9, you really feel for the characters. Here, I honestly couldn't care what happened to these undeveloped characters. They are all boring and bland.
So, if this film wasn't animated, no one would care about it. It's only selling well do to that. Come on people, look deeper into this film, and see it's empty hollow inside. For Square, this is even more embarrasing then Secret of Evermore.",1004227200,5,1821,4.784126984126984
1322197,3,B00003CY5C,"""Final Fantasy"" is quite the technical achievement, and a very intriguing movie to watch. It plays to me like an Americanized anime complete with a male lead that looks like Ben Affleck (though with the voice of Alec Baldwin). It's an enjoyable viewing experience despite some iffy dialogue and some slow spots.
But does the DVD live up to the film, breaking barriers and being a technological wonder? Well, not quite. Sure, there are plenty of extras here, but they're not that useful. Many of them simply involve looking at animatics or storyboards, something that seems pointless when you're dealing with an animated movie. It's animated, the whole thing is ""drawn."" Why do we need to see storyboards?
Anyways, there's also the documentary, which seems lacking in many areas (not the least of which being the absolutely awful music that plays throughout it). There's almost no focus on the voice talent, and you never really get a sense of how this movie is made; it's a bunch of talking heads. Of course, this DVD comes on the heels of the outstanding ""Phantom Menace"" package, so I guess anything will seem lame by comparison.
Then there's this editing feature, where you can shuffle a scene to your own liking. I couldn't understand how to do it, I don't know about you. When your DVD feature needs and instruction book, it's not a good feature, if you ask me.
Then there's the picture quality, which I must say is rather lacking considering it's been taken directly from the digital source material. This is a grainy, sometimes downright dirty looking transfer that is outshined by many released culled from film prints.
But, again, it is a technical marvel, a feast for the eyes, as they say. Just try to get it on sale.",1004227200,,1728,4.763333333333334
1322198,2,B00003CY5C,"The wonderous awe of computer animated humans and effects were beyond fantastic, but failed to keep me from fighting sleep.  The story line was predictable and I still wonder what it had to do with the computer game series of the same name.  The voices of Alec Baldwin and Donald Sutherland had about as much feeling and depth as footprint on a tile floor.  I found the interactive documentary and DVD ROM features much more entertaining. Save your money and rent; it or better yet wait for it to hit HBO.",1004140800,,505,4.527472527472527
1322278,5,B00003CY5C,"Just the quality of the DVD alone is quite a mind blower.  Since this movie was entirely digital, the movie shines brightly in its all digital transfer.  The picture is sharp, the sound very good.  I am still in awe of the crisp and clear graphics have come accross.  Unlike other movies (well computer generated anyway) Final Fantasy--The Spirits Within, is a great addition to your DVD library.  If you're a graphic designer like me...ok, ok, ok, let me rephrase that...If you're a computer geek as I am, you can't believe how clear the ALL DIGITAL print is.  If you've seen Final Fantasy in the theatres, you'll be very pleased with the DVD.  The initial story for me anyway, is alright, but I must admit I am more impressed with the animation and especially how the Dr. Sid character appears to be more life-like than the rest of the virtual cast.  The extra features (including a tribute to Micheal Jackson) are great with a lead in to Aki shooting a scene from the movie.
Again, I can't get over how crystal clear this movie is on a TV tube.  Now if only I can just get myself an HDTV to view it on.
If you're into graphics, computers, or just love movies with a great visual appearance--Final Fantasy--The Spirits Within is one you should see.",1004140800,,1250,4.52
1322279,3,B00003CY5C,"The animation was very good.  SQUARE's animation has been high quality.  The story is the problem. I was bored in the theatre.  I have been reading Japanese comic books since my elementary school age, and own 4 game machines.  Final Fantasy presented nothing more than the average level in the respect of the story.  It is a good example to learn that master work in visual presentation doesn't get filmmakers to get them to the top.  This is the first trial for SQUARE, I hope their second procudtion will be better.

The enemy was a refreshing change from the norm. I rented this movie for one night and watched it 3 times. That was 2 days ago and I would happily watch it again. At the very least, watch it for yourself and remember that I don't respect you if you dislike it :)",1004054400,,527,4.12621359223301

Pros:
* Rather good quality of audio and video.
* Two in-movie commentaries, sadly not by the director.
* Certificate of authenticity (I know, it's a piece of paper, but I like it.)
Cons:
* Disc 2.  The scenes here utilize Quicktime 5, is a degradation of the whole DVD idea.  These scenes run in a tiny; 3x2 inches window.
* Finding mose of the special features is a pain.  They are hidden under several layers of menus and sub-menus.
* Many of these special features require Internet access, a detail that is not mentioned on the package.
* Bonus trailers include trailers of 2-years old movies, such as Starship Troopres.
Overall, ignore this DVD and wait for the Extra-special edition or whatever it will be called.",1004054400,,918,4.607361963190184
1322282,4,B00003CY5C,"In trying to think of how to put in words my thoughts on ""Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within,"" I'm slightly at a loss. After one hour and forty six minutes of watching a continuous special effect, I've come to the conclusion that the film will go down in history as a golden nugget of the modern era, and a symbol of the ongoing creation of bigger and better (not to mention believable) visual effects.
And while the computer animation is eye-popping and awe-inspiring, the story behind it is passable enough to back it up, including some good character development and interaction, and a futuristic vision of Earth that has more ups than downs. This isn't sci-fi in the great tradition of the classics in the genre, but it provides a reason for the special effects, keeping them from seeming arbitrary and routine.
The movie takes us to the year 2065, and Earth is desolate and barren, and overrun by years of war which pits the remains of the human race against strange, ghost-like creatures referred to as ""phantoms."" Among these is Aki Ross (voiced by Ming-Na), a young female scientist in search of remaining life forms among barren sections of the planet. After an incident in the abandoned section of New York City, she meets up with former flame Captain Edwards (Alec Baldwin), who is assigned to guard her.
But his assignment comes from a less-than-honorable general (James Woods), who wishes to incarcerate Aki when it is revealed that she is infected with a contained strand of the phantom phenomena, which seems to be breaking free of its confines within her. His true intention is to have a new military weapon approved for use against the menace, hoping to disprove the theory held by Aki and her mentor, Dr. Sid (Donald Sutherland), that retrieving spirits of nature will create a force strong enough to wipe out the powerful juggernaut.
This is where the story meets most of its ups and downs. When the story isn't trying to create a sense of awe and wonder through theological beliefs pertaining to the battle of good versus evil, it works well. The background history behind the phantoms will seem a bit contrived, even silly. Other plot lines, such as the sense of heroism instilled in the characters, and the battle between the scientists and the government officials, work much better.
The characters are also some of the better-developed characters of the year, and they're all digital, for crying out loud. The movie devotes much time to developing each one individually, from a scene involving Aki and Edwards being trapped in an overhead observatory, to Aki's conversations with Dr. Sid. The interaction between the characters provides some laughs as well as some believable moments of heroic actions. Each voice talent gets into the mindset of their character, and makes their emotions appear as real as the CGI actors themselves.
The movie's most memorable aspect, without a doubt, is the dazzling use of computer animation, which stands as a striking achievement in the history of movie-making. Composed entirely of CGI, the movie itself is one big special effect, one that is easily discernable from reality, but is nonetheless impressive in its audaciousness and its grand sense of scope and vision. The actors, I'm told, were created entirely from scratch, without the use of human digitization. Such facts as this create a heightened sense of appreciation for the effort and work that goes into a project such as this.
""Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within"" becomes more than just a futuristic look at Earth: it also becomes a futuristic look at filmmaking. The story will be a bore to some looking for readily-believable theories and dialogue, and may even disappoint followers of the sci-fi genre, but it's not without its intentions, and it meets those intentions by bringing us filmmaking as we've never seen it before. We may be years away from seeing real actors completely replaced by digital ones, but after this film, the possibility has become frightening real.",1003968000,,3999,4.943536404160476
1322283,2,B00003CY5C,"Although I liked the animation for the most part (some of the skin tones looked inconsistant throughout the film, yet still managed to be terrible every time, some of the non-organic motions were awkward, and other colors were just out of place), the rest of the movie was just plain dull.
The story looked like something a B-movie director turned down.  Not only was it flat and boring, but it was also quite ridiculous.
And this is all ignoring the fact that the movie has nothing to do with the Final Fantasy series.  The only thing FFish about the movie were some of the sets, and a few of the character's and their costumes were reminicent of bad guys and footsoldiers from FFVII and VIII.
I'm glad I rented this instead of paying money to see it in the theaters, or wasted way too much buying the DVD.
The only thing that saved the DVD was one hidden feature.  If you have found it, you know what I mean, if you don't know what I mean, find it yourself.",1003968000,,959,4.346368715083799

1322285,5,B00003CY5C,"'A must have' here means that this DVD version isn't just a reference of Complete Animation / Images. Well, that's also really help, but, you can also look to a half-complete 'behind the scene' film (but still playing full almost 2 hours), which is only from storyboard and a half-preview look from 3D software package (in this film, Maya's realtime preview). You can look from there, although just few seconds, how the related scene was made.
In short, It's a great & complete 'study-case' CG film or any other animation that appear in most Squaresoft's Final Fantasy videogame or other title videogame.
Just try sharing, as I'm also one of CG fans and a person who try learning & experimenting many CG things.

1322286,3,B00003CY5C,"While Final Fantasy is every bit the most advanced rendering and computer animation (Anime), the story and movie is little beyond that of a typical saturday morning cartoon.  As a science fiction lover, I very much enjoy some good techobabble, however, as I find the problem with much Japenese Anime, I become bored easily: HOMOGENEOUS, without much variation.  After a while the shooting, explosions, and wild imagery become monotonous, just like any cartoon seems to do after a while.  This is a beautiful, latest and greatest technology Japanese ANIME.  I enjoyed it but was slightly disappointed in the sense that the story was a little on the strange side and did not move me very much.  To think it cost something like $120,000,000.00 to produce, or some rediculous figure!  OUCH!  The reason I'm excited about this DVD and movie is because of the trickle down technology and a glimpse of what computer games are going to be like within a year or two.",1003881600,2,957,4.8343558282208585
1322287,5,B00003CY5C,"Well... I don't have the DVD yet... But I do work in the entertainment industry.  This DVD comes loaded down with Features for all you techno geeks at heart too play and fiddle around with.  just check out the list and drool if that sorta thing is your bag.  But for the rest of us that don't have a clue what a animorphic widescreen is.... Were more interested in what kind of film this is.
Well... It's a real good one.  Better then Mummy returns in many respects.  I'm sure you've read the poor reviews, and let me explain why.
Quick Question: You ever go too a film and sit behind a guy that talks and doesn't pay attention too a film?  That's the kind of guy that won't enjoy this film.  It's a sad fact that The majority of Western audiances wanna go too a movie and be able too get the plot whilst paying minimal attention.  And most movies, (Gladiator, mummy returns) Cater too this mentality.
Final Fantasy's story movies quickly, not a scene is wasted, nor is one piece of dialouge.  Blink, go too the bathroom, and you will not have the slightist idea whats going on, or why the ppl are doing what they are doing.  I'm sad that the film got a bad rap by ppl that prefer simplicity.  While simplicity has it's place, A film like this is a breathtaking break from the norm.
When I Rented the film for a friend, in the first scene they asked me ""I thought this is supposed too be animated, how come they are using a real actress in that scene""  Well, It is 100% completely animated.  And that's the kicker.  It's the most visually dazzeling film you ever saw.  Lucas said that he wanted too put a life like CGI alien in Phantom menace,  Well lucas I reccommend you take your Gungan Back too the old workshop cuz he looks like a hand puppet compared too the charachters in this film.  Acting and dialouge all get A+ marks all around.  The only exception is general Hein.  When the heck did Snidely Whiplash sign up with Square anyway?  I swear there is a distinct resemblance.  Maybe Hanna Barbara should sue.  General Hein Gets a B instead cuz he's just so over the top and dastardly that Dr. Evil would have too clone a thousand Mini Me's just too be competitive.
In short, final fantasy Is top notch, yet Complex entertainment that demands your complete attention, and perhaps multiple viewings too truly enjoy.  And even if you have the attention span with the tinsel strength of cotton candy in a typhoon, If your a techno-geek, you'll just dig all those extras.  The biggest sin is that fianl fantasy was so underappreciated at the box office that square recently announced they will make no more feature films due too the EXTREME lack of profit.  Which is a shame.  It may be years, or even never, Before an other studio reaches this kind of technical AND artistic porficency and gives us another CGI film this deep, moving, well written, and beautifully animated.

1322357,4,B00003CY5C,"In the summer of 2001 there was the delightful and warmhearted
Shrek , but Square Soft an expert in making powerful and popular
role playing game and the one that put them on the gaming front
no doubt about it Final Fantasy was to be a huge project for them
investing for Square was a big risk for this levithan of a C.G. ,
flick with a 75 million dollar price tag , and the best computer
generated effects ever. The ploit is complex and emotional and is
not for everyone. The earth is a wasteland and has been invaded by
powerful phantoms , citys on fire and people running for shelter
it is up to Aki Ross (Ming Na Wen) and the doctor who is played by Donald Sutherland , and a band of marines to find a signiture
of an 8th restless spirit to avoid a war and a dictating madman
(James Woods )from fireing a superweapon to destroy the spirit.
  This movie is not for everyone for the person whom is not a fan to Final Fantasy they may have to watch it twice to figure
what the movie is about , playing mostly to empty theatres the only bad thing would be is that it is more for the fans then anything. If you are not ready for a serious movie to use this
technology then you might like Shrek more then this movie but
definately the computer animation is so good so realistic that
when you see it at first you'll think they used real actors,
the DVD is two disks and has many worthwhile options but most
of them are subtitled but there fun , for fans of sci fi this
is a worthwhile DVD and is a great sci fi movie , but for the
person who is not into it the film will to immersive but a
good film even though reveiwers trashed it.",1003881600,,1630,4.059006211180124

The plot was there, and the computer generated graphics were awesome, particularly for the lead character Dr. Aki.  The minor characters were not so good, and you could tell they were computer generated of course, but hey this is a new genre, cutting edge technology. The computer graphics special effects are worth seeing this movie if just for that reasoning alone. It is said that in five years such characters will be mixed with real actors in movies, and you won't know the difference-- I believe it, having seen this movie.",1003881600,,643,4.640350877192983
1322359,4,B00003CY5C,"This movie comes with 2 discs.  The first has the movie, the other contains all the really awesome extras.  In most cases, animated movies are great.  They usually have a strong story with breath-taking graphics.  Toy Story 1 and 2 are both the best examples.
Final Fantasy's animation and graphics just blow everything that's been done away!  The movements are fairly realistic, the character models are great and very deep, the action equals to that of any decent action flick.  This is what computer animation is supposed to be like!
Is that enough reason to buy this movie?  Maybe.
What about the story since that is what movies are about?  The story is very Final Fantasy non-standard (as compared to the video games).  There are no swords, no chocobos, no lead male character, no summoning of monsters or even magic.  No, this is a sci-fi flick in the vain of such movies like Aliens, Pitch Black, Akira, and Bladerunner.
The story feels very Japanese.  It is dealing heavily with the human spirit after death.  Does it return to the Earth (or Gaia as it is called in the movie) to join the planet's spirit? Mixed in with this ideaology is that 'aliens' have crash landed on Earth and seem to like 'killing' off the human inhabitants.  There are two stories running together; what to do with the aliens and how does the human spirit fit into all this?  Oh, I forgot that they are hunting for the last of THE 8 spirits.  What those are, I have no idea.
It does all tie together...  Barely.
If you look deeper, you find the enemy is not the aliens, but ourselves.  It is this deeper meaning that drives this movie and what the Final Fantasy games are really about.
So the story is neat in concept, but not well written.  (This occurs in RPGs all the time...)  How about characters?  Afterall, it has an all star cast with Ming Na, Donald Sutherland, a Baldwin and Steve Buscemi!
I really felt that they weren't fleshed out well.  Sutherland's character might be the best and he's just the doctor.  The love between Aki and Gray's characters are decent, but because their personalities fall a bit flat, it's hard to to really care THAT much.  Buscemi's character appears to be the comic relief, much like Jar Jar in Star Wars.  While he's not very funny, at least he's human.  And the rest of Gray's fire team, well, they can be easily compared to Corp. Hick's team in Aliens.
The real delight of this 2-disc set is the 2nd disc.  I don't know of many DVDs that have extras that are really worth having.
The documentary is great and really helps the feel and the story of the movie. Once you watch that, you'll watch the movie with a bit more respect to the time, effort, and emotions that went into the film.  There's goofy outtakes (not as refined as Toy Story's unfortunately), a music video O_o, and all sorts of other swell things.  I haven't viewed an extras disc just as good since Mummy Returns or Star Wars1.
The movie alone, I don't think is worth buying.  But coupled with the Extras disc, the mind-blowing animation, a funky music video, the sum of the parts make it worth purchasing.",1003881600,,3099,4.543321299638989

The story is very good one and the voice talent in the movie is wonderful, especially Donald Sutherland and Ving Rhames. Visually the movie is amazing.

From the trailers that were originally promoting the film I sort of expected a slam-bam action film and so was a bit disappointed the first time I saw it, I thought too much dialogue and a plot that had been spliced from various anime. But on second viewing, knowing what to expect I found it to be a much more enjoyable movie. The animation as has been said countless times, is nothing short of amazing, the characters are fairly well fleshed-out (no pun intended) and it has an interesting storyline. The little extra with the characters dancing to Michael Jacksons ""Thriller"" is hilarious too. All in all, an enjoyable movie that's definitely worth the time to see, there's times you'll be watching and even forget that these aren't real actors, as a matter of fact they act better than some of the so-called superstar actors out there today!",1003795200,,965,4.583815028901734

I would have given a rating of 3 except the movie is a classic and deserves 5 stars but is let down by awful picture quality.

1322364,5,B00003CY5C,"In the promotional posters and commercials for this film, it's one liner was ""Fantasy becomes reality on Jully 11, 2001."" That's where the problems started. I personaly believe that fantasy should never be mistaken for reality and that the two should never cross over or meet. That basic principle is what has made the Final Fantasy video games (yes, all ten of them) such a tremendous succes. The video games all had different stories with different characters and different worlds, but one thing always stayed the same... the stories and setting were always pure fantasy. Magic, dragons, and wizards were common place in each new Fianl Fantasy world that came with every new game. But you see, Square (the makers of the games and the movie) assumed that in order to get the general public (or anyone who's never played a Final Fantasy game) into the theaters to see this movie that they had to ground this new story in a level of reality that all people could easily come to accept and understand. So they placed thier story on Earth. Instead of main characters runing around with tails (F.F.9) we have main characters who work for the United States Military and who live in the city of New York. Instead of characters casting lighting spells to dispose of enemys (as in almost all F.F. games) we have people firing guns, cannons, and other assorted weaponry. This angle could have worked if the story could have stayed within the boundries of it's set reality, but instead it ends up going places that it really has no right to go. The story takes a mystical if not magical approach to the human spirit, the earth on which we live, what happens after we die, and the real reason we're even alive. Square has been writing stories about these themes ever sence Final Fantasy 1 on the Nintendo Entertianment System but has never tried to place such a story right in the middle of the reality in which you and I both live and exsist. Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within ended up costing Square over 150 million dollars to make. The film only made about 30 million in the U.S. and only made a little better than 25 million over seas. The technology of photo-realistic computer-generated people and settings was not enough to tempt people into the theaters to see this movie. Sure, all the Final Fantasy fans and fanatics were there opening day and opening weekend but after that it was pretty much over. People who did go to see it for the computer graphics accomplishments didn't like or couldn't understand the story and message the film was trying to communicate to the audiance. The game fans got the message because they have experianced this kind of story many times before in the many Final Fantasy video games, but no one else understood what was happening... all they could do was sit back and watch the computer-generated magic on the screen and say, ""Wow."" You see, I'm a Final Fantasy fanatic and have played the games for a very long time. I loved the movie. In fact, I personally think it's the greatest film achivement ever accomplished (other that Citizen Kane). That still doesn't change the fact that the movie was a failure and that it caused the end of Square's dream of becoming a major movie making studio. Square Pictures was already planing a second Final Fantasy film along with a computer-generated film about the Transformers (you remeber them... the vehicals that changed into robots to save the world), but those projects won't happen now. I suppose you could say that the world of Final Fantasy is better represented by video games than it is by movies (at least, that's what I think). In early 2002, Square will realese Final Fantasy 10 for the PlayStation 2. That will get Square back on it's feet and back to doing what it does best... creating fantastic fantasy video games. Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within was a dream that Square had... it's sad to say that it will be the final Final Fantasy we'll ever see on the silver screen. It is a true shame because Final Fantasy is truely the greatest movie ever made. Don't beleive me? Well, I guess you'll just have to cheack it out yourself.

But as for plot? It can get a little confusing if you don't closely follow it.. and that's hard, considering all the great visuals that tend to draw your attention away from the storyline. The plot is not particularly complicated, but the wording and terminology can throw people off. The acting is decent.. nothing great, but nothing -too- terrible. The music is great if you, again, notice it over the rest of the movie.

1322435,5,B00003CY5C,"The CG movie in the world, and its the last for Square as Square Pictures recently and tragically shut its doors after losing around a 9 digit figure in theatres. The movie cost an estimated 130+ million dollars to make and only made around 38 million in the theatre in the US. The DVD is a showcase of the processes used to make the film as well as a digital to digital transfer for the best possible picture and sound quality. There are lots of extras and a really neat interface. If you even thought it was so-so in the theatre then it is worth the 20 bucks for this DVD because it is the last one they will make and a remarkable achievement in computer animation. Disney and Dreamworks cant hold a candle to this films quality and level of detail. This movie is geared towards the teen to adult crowd for realistic violence. Literally every single frame is beautiful and so real looking that you might forget you were watching digital actors. Yes it really is that good. The only sign of CG is in mouth movement during certain dialogue sequences where the lips don't seem to be animated enough. A small and trivial complaint when you consider the fact that the movie took almost 5 years to make from start to end and is 106 minutes and each frame was created individually and there is around 40 frames per second or so. Imagine painting a picture 40 times for just one second of animation. Now think about 40 pictures times 60 for a minute and then so on and so on for 106 minutes of grade A choice animation. If you have not seen this movie then at least rent it as it truly is something everyone should see for the artisitic aspect if nothing else. These people put it all on the line and lost it for this movie and at the same time set a standard so high for animation that it will be years before we see Disney or another studio even attempt the level of detail in this film. Go ahead open your mind to new types of entertainment and if your not the biggest sci-fi nut then see it just to see how hard they worked on a story that is really sci-fi/fantasy.",1003622400,,2063,4.278772378516624
1322436,4,B00003CY5C,"There is something to be said for when a movie makes a giant step in a direction that no one has taken before.  Final Fantasy takes that step.  On the surface this movie may seem like a typical Sci Fi action movie, but when examined, there is a definite effort to make something more original.  The creators are more akin to making movies in the Japanese anime arena, this makes the movie different on two levels.  The first is the ground breaking animation.  Never before has computer animation looked so real and so textured.  The close ups of the actors, excuse me, the characters, allow you to see the texture of the skin.  It's flawless skin, but flawless in a way that any actor wearing makeup on camera would look.  The second way is in the nature of the story.  Fans of the game will probably already know the origin of the creatures that have invaded the Earth, so there won't be any surprises for them, but the action and technological effects will keep their attention anyway.  The story is about a ravaged Earth, nearly destroyed by an invading group of aliens.  Humans have grouped together in high tech cities protected by force fields to keep the invaders out.  In an effort to stop the creatures, two initiatives have been taken.  A military project, led by a domineering and hateful General, voiced by James Woods (excellent as always) whose wife and child were killed by the aliens, and a scientific project led by two scientists, the lead character Dr. Aki Ross, a beautifully animated woman voiced by the equally beautiful Ming Na, and her mentor, voiced by Donald Sutherland.  The scientists are looking for a more passive solution because the Superlaser the military wants to use from orbit could hurt the Earths own spiritforce, plus they believe there is another reason for these creatures being on Earth rather than the popular belief of invasion.  As mystical as all this sounds, it is done very subtly.  As Aki tries to acquire the spirits of the earth creatures that will support her theory, time is running out.  The intertwined love story is not really necessary but it does add an emotional element.  The combination of mysticism and technology are common in many Japanimation films and this movie seems to want to make those themes seem more mature.  They do a very good job.  The movie is very entertaining, and deadly serious.  After a while, you tend to forget you are watching animated people though.  In all, Final Fantasy is an extremely impressive piece of work and will no doubt pave the way for future CGI movies.  The pace is a bit slow but it seems to be done on purpose in order to maintain it's seriousness.  Other than that, the combination of these elements make for a very different Science fiction adventure.  Hopefully, this will not be last time full CGI is used, if ever there is a serious Science Fiction movie that requires sets that are too large to build, or creatures to hard to interact with, we will see this kind of work done again.",1003622400,9,2992,4.653333333333333
1322437,2,B00003CY5C,"Being an avid film viewer, I have seen many a movie. I own 150+ plus DVD's and go to the theaters as much as possible. When I went to this highly anticipated film (at least by me and my brother), I was suprised to find it not so great (to say the least). Sure the CG is fantastic and the production values are spectacular, but does that make up for a confused cliched script and emotionally hollow voice acting? I think not. If you wish to see great CG and a great movie, watch Toy Story or The Abyss. When watching those movies in a theater or on a 8 inch black and white TV, they will still make great film.
When reading other reviews on this site, keep in mind that the people giving 5 stars to movies like these are essentially claiming that this film is as good as other _truly deserving_ 5 star films. Is ""The Spirits Within"" as good of a film as Star Wars or The Matrix? Ponder this when you watch this movie.",1003536000,7,916,4.122905027932961

The good/evil conflict in this movie comes from how to [destroy] the aliens. The Gestapo-like General Hien (James Woods) wants to do what every [typical] general wants to.. Blow 'em up with the massive Zeus Cannon in orbit. The (also [typical]) Tree-hugger good guys want to make a more organic way to destroy them.

1322439,4,B00003CY5C,"i am not a very big fan of science-fiction movies, unless it has a specific twist (use Event Horizon as an example; the action/horror hybrid). however, for some reason, this movie captivated some of the audiences during the most lively summer at the box office in a few years.
now that it's at home, and now that dvd technology has become way more prominent, it has the best execution on this format than lots of packages this year. tons of bonus features accompany the first dvd alone, including the audio and subtitled commentary. the digital-digital transfer is flawless. there's even a teaser trailer for final fantasy x for the ps2.
disc two is what really shines, though. an excellent documentary with bonus segments IN the middle (at the push of a button, you find out more about specific techniques), the edit-a-scene suite (simple but cool), and a few easter eggs that pay off (especially the artist's funny homage to ""thriller"").
i'm not discounting the movie, because it was a very exciting thing to experience. however, if you were to purchase it, you'd be best to buy this dvd (unless, of course, you have a playstation 2; they're making a separate release with more techniques).
all in all, the combination of flawless special features, cool special effects, and a relatively decent movie makes for one of the best dvd purchases this year.

1322442,2,B00003CY5C,"There is a certain literary phrase called ""suspension of disbelief.""  Anyone who has ever seen a film, read a book, or witnessed some other artistic expression has no doubt had to ""suspend disbelief"" in some way.  In The Spirits Within, it is hard, and that happens NOT as a result of the subject matter.  Instead, the screenwriters never give us any reason to ""suspend disbelief.""  Instead they fill a promising plot--one that COULD have extensive moral and environmental implications--with a tale that revitalizes an aspect of Roman Mythology, but fails repeatedly to provide any explanation for all of these supposed ""scientific and mythological"" conclusions.  Most movies AT LEAST provide this; it helps the audience to believe, regardless of scientific untruths and other fantastical circumstances.  There are a lot of truly good plot twists that fall through cracks because the script doesn't take the time to explain them even a little.
On the subject of visuals, it is the best yet, but that is not to say it is perfect.  Ignoring some inconsistent speech-with-lip movement, are the mannerisms.  Yes, I believe this is the first time that I have decided that animated characters needed an acting coach.  The voices are no doubt done as well as they are able, but the characters motions and emotions belong on daytime television or worse yet CABLE!  But, aside from this, The Spirits within will probably own the prestige of best visuals in a fully CGI film, because in all other respects, it is perfect, a near exact replica of exitence.
In conclusion, The Spirits Within is a good movie to see in the theatre--preferably second run--but not something that warrents repeat viewings or even a place in one's collection.  There are many times when the film COULD be quite brilliant, but then along comes poor ""acting,"" plot that isn't reinforced, and to top it all off, dialogue that would make a child cringe--or laugh!  A simple note, in the theatre, perhaps even at the most serious and emotional times, the audience couldn't restrain laughter on account of the absurdness of the characters, dialogue, and plot.  Square gave a good first try, but they could have done a lot better.",1002844800,,2190,4.967123287671233
1322443,3,B00003CY5C,"There have been many reviews about this movie that have ranged from excellent to shoddy, but mine will fall in the middle for a couple of reasons I will get to. I'll tell you what I found cool and what I found to be lacking. First off, I saw this movie in a digital projection theater. The colors were mind-blowing to say the least. I was constantly losing track of the story because I couldn't take my focus off the spectacular animation. The animation is so rich and textured...let's just say that you have never seen anything like it-real or fabricated. It truly is amazing. The voice casting is perfect. No slackers anywhere. The idea for the story is very innovative, not just some traditional sci-fi retread. But (and there always is a but), the actual dialogue and character development are lacking. Baldwin sometimes seems like a romantic distraction for Ming Na. Is Woods' character supposed to be a sympathetic bad guy because he talks about his family before he commits his bad deeds? Come on, I know 13-year-olds who don't fall for that. The question I was left with was: ""Why invest all this money in voice talent, if you give them nothing to work with?"" It's a testament to the actors that they were able to pull so much out of the dialogue considering what they had to work with. I don't want to give too much of the plot away, so I won't say anything else about it. ...I enjoyed all the characters for the most part, but I wish there was more to enjoy. I know sometimes that character development is lost because the studios want to get to the next big action event, but when people don't have anything invested in the characters, it just becomes a lot noise. It's too bad because, like I said, there was plenty of sources to draw upon.
Bottom line: The best animation to date, but sorely lacking character and plot development.",1002672000,48,1844,4.54054054054054

1322541,3,B00003CY5C,"Being a fan of the Final Fantasy franchise, I saw this opening day at the theater not knowing what to expect, other than gorgeous cinematography.  To say the least that's all that I got. I was disappointed by the overall plot and acting involved.  In fact, it reminded me of Titan A.E. except with a bigger budget.  i.e. Earth is invaded by aliens, humans flee, humans must find the ""thing"" to get rid of the aliens, humans win, end of movie.  Okay, so that may be the basis for a dozen other sci-fi movies, but that's my point exactly.  Don't get me wrong, the visuals were outstanding, surpassing any form of computer animation to this day, but the characters weren't really compelling and neither was the plot.  This franchise has a huge following world wide, selling millions of copies(video games)upon each release, yet it still bombed at the box office.  The disappointment for me was the fact that the movie strayed too far from its successful roots.  It was all sci-fi and no ""fantasy"" whatsoever.  This series, now on its way to the 11th incarnation, has always been based on ""fantasy"" elements.  I'm talking about things like mythical monsters, magic, swords, wizards,  airships, and chocobos(true fans will know the last one).  Things that this movie did not involve, yet every single one of its games have.  In any case, I gave the movie 2 stars for its mediocrity, plus 1 more for being an exceptional DVD pacage.

It's really got pretty cool gadgets and some cool death effects, but that's about it.

1322543,4,B00003CY5C,"So, this film got something of a mixed review at the box office.  Okay, maybe it just got panned by a lot of critics.  I still think it's a great movie.  Certainly, if you're the type of person who plays videogames and shamelessly drools at some of today's gorgeous in-game cut-scenes, you'll feel like you've gone to heaven.  However, this is not just a movie for fan-boys.  I thought it was a great addition to the Sci-Fi genre, and it's rare that we get anything like that from a japanese narrative perspective outside of the relatively closed world of Anime.
I thought the voice acting was excellent.  At times both humorous and dramatic.  Sometimes humorous in dramatic moments (but then, it wouldn't be Square if they took themselves 100% seriously, all of the time.)
If nothing else, this movie represents what the next stage of film-making could be.  We've seen great uses of CG characters in films like Toy Story and Shrek (and poor uses in Star Wars), but never quite like this before.  Watch it, get properly blown away by what you see, and pray that the studios take a chance and make more movies like this.",1002585600,2,1119,4.611111111111111
1322544,5,B00003CY5C,"A spectacular, underrated film that gambled on the sophistication of North American audiences and lost.  The story, the visuals, the music, the voice acting: it all works here.  Earning special kudos are of course the CGI work and overall visual effects, which are simply mind-blowing.  And if there's one tiny negative in the whole thing, it's that Ming-Na's voice acting for the lead character is the weakest in an ensemble of incredible voice actors.  But that's it.
Bottom line: this breakthrough film, giving us an incredible glimpse at an exciting future in visual arts and entertainment, belongs in your DVD collection, period.
Thank you, Square, for the corporate courage to put major bucks on the line and offer something truly different and creative and wonderful in an industry that, disappointingly, seems to specialize in cookie-cutter, imitative filmmaking more every day.",1002585600,13,886,5.307142857142857

1322546,4,B00003CY5C,"This movie was destined to tank at the box office.  Although it is a good movie, and satisfied my high expectations.  It is hardly mainstream, it has many traditional anime-like qualities that many people have a hard time swallowing.  The story involves spirits of planets and mystical energies that exist all around us.  This in and of itself isn't original, but the way it is presented is.  The whole movie is straight-faced, there is no self-awareness or self-deprecation like a lot of anime, it is all taken seriously.  This surprised me, and I liked it.  The self-reference and quirky in-jokes of anime have grown tiresome to me.  That lack of humor doesn't really explain the lack of box-office clout, I guess people just weren't convinced that the story would live up the animation.  Also, it's named after a video game, that probably scared some people off too.  Whatever people did come, were either fans of the games or were curious about the animation.  The animation simply put is amazing, while the characters don't look as lifelike as people had claimed, the amount of expression is astounding.  The mannerisms of a character are developed substancially and the detailed facial expressions are breathtaking.  The locales where these characters reside are also beautiful, dirty, or disturbing depending on the circumstances.  Squaresoft and Columbia, obviously disappointed by the lackluster performance at the box-office are supplying a magnificent DVD for the fans of the film, which of course includes me.  This film will gather a larger following on video, of that I am sure, and people will come to regret not seeing the magnificent visions on the big screen where they belong.",1002067200,,1695,5.068592057761733

No CGI work to date has ever reached that level of realism and I doubt any other will be coming along in the next few years. Unfortunately, the movie failed to grab me. Forget accusations of slowness and the like, I love more than my fair share of ""slow"" movies, but this film didn't inspire empathy or compassion for the character's situation. For whatever reason, and I have yet to find a tangible one, I didn't worry about these people or feel anxious to find out what happens next. The movie had a beautiful story, but I think something was simply lost in the translation. It was like watching a fantastic action scene before they add in the musical score, somehow it comes off bland. So, do I think its a good movie?

This movie is one of those where you walk out of the theatre and you just stop and think about what you just saw. This is a good thing. I never felt like that since A.I. (Another really good film from the summer film-a-thon.) The voice actors they picked for the characters were really good choices. The only thing that creeps me out about this movie (other than those phantoms) is the fact that if we can make human characters look like this now, we won't need human ones in the future. However, the director of this film said in an interview basically said, we can make the bodies okay. But the actors are the people who bring life to these characters.

Well, that would be a lie.  Part of the film that makes it great is the extra effort to make the characters look life-like.  The animators really went on overkill to make it work, because the high details of the face, including the eyes, the pores, the hair, it's a wonder how they completed this in only a few short years.
The plot needed a little bit of fine tuning from what I could see, but all of the plot elements made complete sense, and that's what makes the film enjoyable, if you understand what's going on.

The work is amazing and groundbreaking, though the story is not. In fact, the story  dies because it  does not go far enough. When dealing with the metaphysical, few seem to truly grasp the quirky  potential of marrying science and religion, and end up trivializing it for the masses, (something Hollywood seems to love doing).  What a golden opportunity was missed with this one--you had scientists with strong mystical beliefs trying to save the world--and the story retreats to delivering cliches. Perhaps the error was initially made in trying for a mainstream AMERICAN market, when it could have relied more on the exoticism of the Japanese culture. This makes it quite in-authentic, especially if you consider the director's cosmology as implied by his body of work in the video game arena.  Well, at least FF made for some great phantoms, cool effects, and lots of great artwork, (and some bloopers)  which the DVD seems to have collected.

1322603,5,B00003CY5C,"If you think this movie looks intersting, but you are skeptical, let me clear it up for you.  Final Fantasy is one of the most thought-provoking, imaginative, beautiful and groundbreaking films EVER.
I am glad to see that people around here are reviewing it well, but there are several comments even in positive reviews that need clearing up.  There are not plot holes unless *you* don't piece together the puzzle.  That is one of the many high points of the film.  Much of what you see tells a story and evokes emotion.  It may not be the most surprising or ""Hollywood-ified"" movies out there, but I grinned through the whole movie.  The emotion and awe I felt was unbelievable.  During the closing moments of the film an awed silence fell over everyone, it was peaceful...
And who can forget the animation.  So many people say that it looks so real that they should have used real actors - this would not work.  Walt Disney was faced with the same questions when he created Snow White.  CG is simply a better way of telling this tale.  It is amazing to watch - you can get so much enjoyment just from watching. But do more than that - try to notice the subtle hints and hidden character developement - notice the stunning originality of  Final Fantasy.
And don't forget the features of the DVD.  Two discs packed with tons of cool stuff, lke extra footage, outakes and a documentary.  There is also scene by scene commentary.  One of the most exciting features is that in the last scene, you can manipulate the camera and such then record and play back your new scene in the movie.

Shrek another animation film that arrived at cinemas around the same time was really good. WHY? It had all the right incredients to make a terrific film. It was amusing in many places but at the same time had heart and a decent plot. The jokes were well timed and the mushy, lovey-dovey stuff didn't over stay it's welcome to the colouful veiwing. The voices fit the characters like a glove. However Final Fantasy had a flat script. I mean that the characters were bland and one dimensional. Not only that but the faces didn't at all fit the voices. For example Alec Baldwins character looked  like Ben Affleck. The cahratcers themselves apperaed to us as puppets with life. They weren't at all like humans. For the fact that the film is a actuallly too long for an animated film that it drags out and the efects become boring and dull causing boredom from veiwing it. I belive this to be the case because the creators had one goal; to create life like (in the facial department) humans, therfore ignoring the right ingredients to make a good film. SHAME for a film with so much potential.
I give this DVD two stars because of the features availible. There are loads. If this is bought, it will only be for the extras. WHY do they have to give thos films of a weak nature so many features. In reality this DVD deserves 1 star and 1 star only.",1000166400,,1559,4.409722222222222

I was impressed very much with this work. I have a hard time with the criticism that I have heard about this film, especially from Final Fantasy fans. I admit it was far from perfect, but it was the best movie I've seen all summer. One thing some forget is that ""Final Fantasy"" has always been a concept, an excercise. The game series always changes in fudamentals with every new installment, ranging from traditional fantasy to ""age-of-enlightenment/industrial revolution & magic"" to hard-core sci-fi or an odd melange of all three. Why should the films be any different? I anxiously await the DVD release and the next VG installment as well. At least it has a plot more feasable than the last Star Wars flick (eeww!).",999820800,,752,4.837209302325581
1322609,5,B00003CY5C,It is my opinion that the reviews before this one were written by pure gamers who just wanted to go crazy over their favorite game characters on screen. I am a game fan as well and it is a fact that every Final Fantasy game had different characters and different stories. The movie was no different. It held pure to the game with it's concepts of spirits and life. But held it's own twists and plot. The animation was spellbinding and the story was riviting. The characters persona's in the movie were also surprisingly relatable which is hard to find in a film these days. So if you are a sci fi fan who wants to see a great movie with adult concepts this is for you. If you are a gamer who wants to see a new twist just like ever Final Fantasy game has provided it is also for you. If you are a gamer who just wants to see the same game he played on screen without playing then get another movie this will not please you.,999820800,,923,4.133333333333334
1322678,5,B00003CY5C,"I personally enjoyed ""Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within"" very much, and was rather disappointed by the responses of American audiences and critics.
Despite several comments stating otherwise, ""Final Fantasy"" is not slow. Indeed, a surprisingly small percentage of the film is comprised of action sequences, but action has nothing to do with character or plot development. ""Final Fantasy's"" plot may not be for all audiences, but that doesn't mean that it lacks one, entirely. Those who appreciate the Japanese style of storytelling will surely understand the plot's depth.
Interestingly enough, die-hard fans of the video games have commented that ""The Spirits Within"" is nothing like the games that preceded it, and thus is unworthy of the title, ""Final Fantasy."" While I, for one, disagree with that statement, everyone is entitled to their own opinions. I should, however, comment that each FF game is unique in its plot, characters (save Cid,) and world. What do people expect? An interactive battle system in the movie? Guest appearances by Cecil, Terra, Cloud, or some other character from the game series?
I'm just writing this review in defense of the movie, because I feel that some people, whose attention spans have been rotted by too many hours of MTV, have been overly-bashing it. Remember that a review, mine included, is just an opinion. Though you may read several reviews that say, ""This is the poopiest movie I've ever seen! It's stupid and I hate it!"" or something to that effect, you should really pay more attention to the film's overall rating. At the present, as I am writing this, the movie has an average rating of four stars. That's quite a bit better than ""poop,"" in my estimation.
All in all, I recommend this movie. Give it a chance. Though it may seem melodramatic at times, that's typical of the Japanese style of storytelling. If you liked ""Princess Mononoke,"" you'll at least appreciate the film's message.

That is what I think they were stressing...why else would they pump so much money into Square Pictures?(except some equipment for game graphics, but games make so much more money...), and they succeeded at that. Only when Woodie is climbing on the sleeping collecter in Toy Story 2 did we ever get lifelike aimation from CG(the collector, not Woodie), but now with this one, the tone has been set for lifelike movie animation. What did this movie in was that it tried to please everyone, and in doing so offended everyone just a bit..bad story, talking, no ties to ""Fantasy""(my own peeve as a gamer).But then again, it has the FINAL, which means that they take a risk that it could be thier ""final"" peice(doubtful with the game quality Square has acheived). So overall, I think they acheived their pupose, and got everyone aquainted with the power of CG, and put themselves as a lead in that style entertainment(they're already top of games).",999648000,,1073,4.74331550802139

This movie was NEVER MENT to follow ANY of the games. It's not even set in the same UNIVERSE that the games were done in. It was given the name Final Fantasy because it was made by Squaresoft and fit in with the TYPE of plot they used for some of the games in that series.
As for the movie itself, I was blown away. The graphics are far beyond anything I have ever seen, and there were times when I had to remind myself it was not a live action movie. I found the plot incredibly good (except for some over acted lines) but I can see how some people might not like it. The plot is very different in some philosophies then what you see in the western world, and some people simply don't appreciate it.

But for a movie, the plot is great, and borrows many elements from different games. The ending involves a lot of element from FF 7 and 9, for instance. The voice acting is superb, espcially James Wood, who makes a perfert hero/villian hybrid. The graphics are the best ever seen in a movie, and the action is fun.

So what does this all mean? Well, if you are looking for a mediocre sci-fi adventure to kill time, this could be what you're looking for.

1322684,4,B00003CY5C,"This movie takes some understanding to appreciate.  The games had anywhere between 60 and 160 HOURS of gameplay within which the writers/creators could develop a plot line.  The movie had about 112 min. (give or take a few min.) so it is understandable that the plot line was not very subtle.  It simply didn't have time to be.  They had to hit the high points of the story and fit in character development where they could.  I personally think that they did an admirable job with that.  I admit the animation was not as emotional as possible but it was still very impressive and worth going to see.  The plot was the same STYLE as the Final Fantasy games and that is good.  The series has a very definite style of plot and plot progression (which any afficionado of the genre should recognize) and the movie held to both wonderfully.  The musical score is just incredible and definitely worth purchasing.  I am listening to it now, in fact.  The movie is better each successive time it is watched.  Wonderful replay value.  Overall, if you will put a little effort toward understanding the movie you are sure to find it a very enjoyable title which has a place in (even...belongs...in) any DVD or VHS library for those connoisseurs of the games or anybody who enjoys a good blend of science fiction and fantasy.

The story has some original elements, but it's another apocalyptic scenario, with humanity facing anhihilation. It clearly borrows some action scenes from James Cameron's Aliens, the director must be a fan of it. It is though a very entertaining, thrilling, suspenseful movie. What sets it apart it's the fact that is entirely CG, and the characters are human like, not smiley cartoons, thanks a lot for that, at last somebody did it, no toys, no ogres, no ants, no dinosaurs, not that I didn't like'em, I did, but this movie dares to go further, and makes the other CG movies producers look as if they have been cowering from taking the next step. It isn't a kids movie, it is dark, a bit sad, and characters die, good guys! The characters, well, are the most realistic CG humans to date, and can convey human emotions, not just humor. I hope they make virtual actors out of them, so we can see them in other movies, it will be great to see Aki again even if it isn't a FF sequel, she could even turn into a model, make TV ads for any hair treatment brand. This movie doesn't have much relation with the game series from which it takes the name, but it's in its favour, so it doesn't feel like you just went to see somebody else play. The voice talents are great, this movie is somewhat of a milestone for CG movies, it's a must see.

My biggest complaint was that someone other the Uematsu composed the score for this movie. Uematsu, of course, has done the music for all ten games thus far. I rather enjoyed the story, although I could see 'inspiration' from Aliens and Starship Troopers, the dialougue fit the film, though when Aki would cry and no tears came out of her eyes I found that disturbing. The facial expressions were all dead on, but no tears? Did anyone else find this puzzling? The movie was too short and had an ending that you have to be very into anime to understand or be able to cope with. Over all the movie was enjoyable for anime fans like myself, but those who do not follow Final Fantasy as a game series, or Japanese animation may be baffled by the movie's plot, or may find the movie's story sterile and unenjoyable.

1322779,5,B00003CY5C,"ZUMA DIGITAL, the innovative design and development studio that enables powerful new applications for new media, has produced an evolutionary milemarker in the home entertainment industry for Columbia Tri-Star Home Entertainment with the DVD release of Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within. The DVD is scheduled for release 23 October 2001.
Columbia Tri-Star tapped the team at ZUMA for all areas of the DVD production including the filming, editorial and post for all of the added-value features, the design and creative as well as the ROM and Web content. Final Fantasy will ship as a two disc DVD-9 set.
""Our goal was to realize a new paradigm in the development of interactive entertainment"", notes Blaine Graboyes ZUMA founder and chief creative officer, ""both in our approach to the entire production as well as our vision for the final product.""
ZUMA worked directly with Square Pictures, the film's production company, to best understand, explore and present the project on DVD (as opposed to the established approach of reusing previously produced EPK and marketing materials). ZUMA collaborated directly with Square and Columbia in the development of the added-value content and visual design for DVD, beginning in November 2000 through August 2001.
Disc One is a traditional DVD-Video movie, although the design and functionality of the disc is possibly the first instance of DVD content being produced at an equivalent level to the feature film itself. Special Features include 4 commentary tracks and a Boards and Blasts version of the film, showing most of the film in development from storyboards to rough animations to final film.
Disc Two truly explores the boundaries of the DVD format, disposing with a traditional hierarchical, outline menu layout, and instead using an Interactive Documentary as the central content and navigational system. During the 30 minute documentary viewers can watch special feature segments which are accessed when link out windows appear on screen. The entire documentary and link outs are composited into a holographic interface, similar to the film itself, giving the entire DVD a seamless feel between movies and games.
In addition to the 30 minute original documentary, ZUMA produced 17 link out segments ranging from 45 seconds to 11 minutes in length (some with optional commentaries), covering subjects such as the render farm at Square, the GAIA theory, pre-concept art, and compositing breakdowns. A Highlights Menu provides access to a dozen other features including the Character Files (video bios on the 7 main characters, their animators and VO actors) and the SHUFFLER (allows a user to re-edit a scene from the film). In total Disc Two contains over 100 minutes of original added-value content.
After nearly ten months of collaboration between ZUMA DIGITAL, Square Pictures and Columbia Tri-Satr, Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within will reach the public on DVD in October, establishing a new milemarker for the possibilities of interactive entertainment, and proving that the DVD format can be used as an artistic medium beyond the film.",998352000,2,3096,5.320408163265306

Ving Rhames and Steve Buscemi are in this, which I had completely forgotten, but they don't get much to work with either. One big bonus, and why I didn't rate this a 3/5, is the amount of content packed onto the disc. I loved flipping through the art galleries and finding the hidden extras in the menus.
