8504045,4,B006TMKKOY,"This is a great video of professional wakeboarders. I feel that it spends a little bit too much time talking about how great Danny Harf is, but it's his movie, so it's not a big deal, but we could have seen more wakeboarding instead.

I've seen another 2 or 3 professional wakeboarding videos and this one is a very high quality production. Some of the locations and tricks will blow your mind.",1397952000,,394,4.472222222222222
8504046,5,B006TMKKOY,"This DVD is insane. Danny and the boys keep every riding session top notch. The soundtrack is killer, (especially Danny's part). Definite must buy for any wake fans. Makes me want to go ride every time I watch it.",1394150400,,213,4.487179487179487
8504047,5,B006TMKKOY,"I love the formula they're following. I call it the Brain Farm Formula. Brain Farm dropped the typical method of lumping each rider's segments from different locations into one part, then the next rider, etc. Instead, they focus on one main rider (in their case, Travis Rice), and his friends/fellow riders, and shot segments of all the riders in each different location. And they do it well, only they do it with snowboarding. Well, apparently it works just as well in wakeboarding, because BFY nailed it. This is the ""Art of Flight"" or ""That's It, That's All"" of wakeboarding. And I guess you could say Danny Harf is the Travis Rice of wakeboarding.

Each location has a unique element to it, all of the riders are killing it, and the filming is solid. The soundtrack is pretty good, too. This is my favorite wakeboarding film, for sure.",1369785600,,839,4.707482993197279
8504048,5,B006TMKKOY,"Ive wanted to get into wake boarding for a few years now and had a hard time finding videos that made me want to do it even more. Ive been snowboarding for 10 years now and wanted something to do during the summer months to improve my skills (assuming wake boarding will do that) DEFY is a great film displaying the sport to the fullest. (dare I compair it to ""Art of flight"") Danny Harf pushing the sport (wake boarding) just as much as Travis Rice (snowboarding). From man made tow rope islands full of boxes, rails and raised pools to open water riding, this video covers it all. (with much advancement to go, with the sport anyway) The angles and slowmotion footage that was achieved are spectacular, something you cant get from your average youtube video.
There are two DVD's that come with this, one is the actual movie, the other is full of bonus footage. From building the features, to un-used clips, even snowboarding trips, there are hours more to watch. Sound track is also great.

If you enjoy wake boarding or snowboarding I highly recommend this DVD.
Also, If you enjoy the ""Art of Flight"" (watched it 5 times this winter season) I would recommend
this to get you just as pumped about wake boarding as AoF did with snowboarding. (Watched DEFY about 3 times + bounus features back in the summer)",1361232000,,1308,4.56595744680851
