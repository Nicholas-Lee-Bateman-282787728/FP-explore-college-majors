8752134,1,B01C45OFGS,Very tedious to watch....jumbled and disconnected.,1528588800,,50,7.5
8752135,3,B01C45OFGS,"At one point, the filmmaker says, ""How do you make a film about the Holocaust?...This is more like notes to a film about the Holocaust..."" and that's pretty much what we have here. The filmmaker lost 8 or 9 family members at Auschwitz -- and his mother managed to escape being transported by one day. This is a look at his survivor's guilt. It has some very good music and some interesting artwork but not much else. Eric Clapton appears very briefly during the credits. He does mention briefly his meeting with Sam Goldberg and Albert Speer. I would've liked to have had him focus more on that and on his mother than on his navel-gazing.",1519430400,,638,4.508620689655173
8752136,2,B01C45OFGS,"I saw it as badly done, more of an egotistical exhibition of the man who made the film, than any real enlightenment about the Jewish genocide, I didn't like it all all",1512691200,,167,4.25
8752137,3,B01C45OFGS,This is more of a personal story about a man coming to grips with his family's history which involved Auschwitz.  It seems to me that this is a personal musing that includes Auschwitz and its history.  Interesting to see how he works through his thoughts about the past.,1509580800,,270,4.604166666666667
8752138,1,B01C45OFGS,kRAPPY ART..NO STORY....MORE KRAPPY ART....NO STORY.....,1506643200,,56,8.5
8752139,1,B01C45OFGS,"The majority of the time is spent on the film maker and viewing his art work. This is his story not that of his family and their horrific story.
It struck me as self importance,using his families story  as am excuse to shine the light on himself.",1503273600,2,246,4.23404255319149
8752140,3,B01C45OFGS,"This is a personal story of one man's journey to uncover the past horrors of Auschwitz. It is not a documentary of this era nor does it reveal any new facts of the Holocaust. It is still an interesting watch, but suffers from repetition.",1483056000,,237,4.409090909090909
8752141,3,B01C45OFGS,to much jumpimg around in the story line,1480723200,4,40,4.125
8752142,5,B01C45OFGS,A Very well done documentary featuring background music by Eric Clapton. The is is a different presentation from the usual gas chambers and crematorium.. It is a more personal and touching point of view from a grandson of a survivor. It should be read and seen by all.,1477699200,,268,4.604166666666667
8752143,1,B01C45OFGS,"This review is about the supplier who doesn't stand behind the DVD not the movie which I sure is great with Clapton doing the music...
  Does not play in the United States unless you have an all region player",1472601600,6,208,4.3076923076923075
