5004831,1,B006MHZ1NQ,"Rory, Rory, Rory.. What has become of you? I guess it's not fair of me to base my feelings about this movie on my need for Alexis Bledel to remain Rory like, but I just really did not like her in this role at all.. for one thing, she just wasn't believable as a manipulative, seductive woman..

The story line is really stupid as far as I was concerned. I kept watching thinking this has to get better, but it didn't.. I won't spoil the end, but if you're like me, someone who tries to make sense out of things, you'll find yourself saying, come on... wouldn't the authorities be questioning this, that and the other thing, and wouldn't other people who witness the ""twist"" be saying, wait a minute...that's the the sequence of noise that I heard..

Just kind of a ridiculous story line, and I hope Alexis will go back to playing sweetheart roles, because she's really good at them and that's where her audience is.

I'd love to see her in another series like the Gilmore Girls.. That's where she shines..",1344729600,,1005,4.451086956521739
5004832,2,B006MHZ1NQ,"I cannot buy this actress as a cop, and the story is too farfetched to make much sense or keep you from rolling your eyes.  She does one stupid thing after another, commits crimes, and............spoilers..........

gets away with it.  Just wrong.",1342656000,5,247,4.975609756097561
5004833,1,B006MHZ1NQ,"Cast selection had a made-for-TV formula feel (stereotypes for a female cop and her cohorts; stereotypes of a salesman and motel personnel, etc.). The portrayals were unbelievable, robotic and overly scripted. Directing, editing and cinematography had that one person crew with a camera; jumping scenes; cheapness. Worst was the script in foisting an implausible series of events conjoined with the usual dumb investigative cops. Seemed like a Twinkie movie with not much of a beginning and not much of an end with even less in the middle.",1340064000,,539,5.206896551724138
5004834,4,B006MHZ1NQ,"I really enjoyed this film.  Unlike so many Hollywood movies, I had no idea from scene to scene where this story was going.  Nice performances by Alexis Bledel and Laurent Lucas.",1337904000,,178,4.709677419354839
5004835,1,B006MHZ1NQ,"Very quickly a sense of dread was felt- script seemed poorly written, lacked believability-Alexis hard to accept as police officer. Who on earth thought of that way of ""seducing"" the french guy? Anyway i couldn't sense any motivation for her attempting it: there was no suggestion that there was any threat to her job.
At the point where Alexis' sidearm is discharged i couldn't stand anymore.

Summary:
Script- awful, Direction-if there was any, incompetent, Alexis- totally lost in attempting the character, even allowing for deficiences in script and direction.",1335139200,2,564,5.337078651685394
5004836,3,B006MHZ1NQ,"""We're gonna drive some more, we're gonna find a hotel and I'm gonna do some thinking. There's a way out of this situation that doesn't involve me losing my job and you losing your wife."" New to the force officer Kate Logan (Bledel) stops someone she thinks matches the description of a killer. After realizing her mistake she offers to buy him a drink. The two soon begin an affair that leads to secrets and problems that make them regret meeting each other. I wasn't quite sure what to expect from this movie. It didn't really seem like a movie I would like, mostly because it seemed like it would be a ""Lifetime"" movie. It took about a half hour for anything of substance to happen and about an hour in for me to get interested. The ""twist"" at the end was OK but very predictable. My main problem with the movie is that the event that causes the spiral of events is so minor that it makes the movie a little unbelievable. Overall, if you like the ""Lifetime"" channel movies you will like this one. I do and did not. I give it a B-.",1332288000,4,1033,4.275510204081633
8500834,5,B006MHZ1NQ,"Alexis Bledel could not be more sexy if she tried!
Great movie you will watch over & over.
I just wish she had got naked in it.
Still a great film!",1517097600,,147,3.774193548387097
8500835,3,B006MHZ1NQ,The dvd arrived in great shape. I gave it a 3 because the movie is so boring.,1491350400,,77,3.588235294117647
8500836,4,B006MHZ1NQ,"The story was a bit slow, but watching Alexis Bledel in a new role ( Gilmore Girls). was a great surprise. Her character was twisted and she was great.",1488931200,,151,4.241379310344827
8500837,5,B006MHZ1NQ,"I loved it mostly because of Alexis Bledel. After watching The Gilmore Girls... TWICE! and being a 70 year old man and smitten with Rory Gilmore, it was quiet a character study to see Alexis in a diametrically opposed role.",1445731200,,223,4.6

8500840,3,B006MHZ1NQ,"Not one of bledel's best, but it was worth the acting. As I like her style she has a artistic way of making low-budget movies work, coodles to her.",1417651200,,147,4.103448275862069

8500842,5,B006MHZ1NQ,"The Kate Logan Affair, is one of the best movies that I know of recent years.  While some people might think its cheesy and predicable, I for one enjoyed it immensely.  A rookie cop in a Canadian Town, makes a mistake in arresting a man that fits the description of a rapist that she had gotten a report about in the area.  What starts out as harmless innocent apology drinks between Kate and Mr. Gando, turns into a twisted situation after an accidental discharge of her firearm in a motel where Mister Gando was staying, and where Kate had been with him too.
In my opinion, me as the viewer of this movie, felt bad for both Kate and Mr. Gando. her for wanting something she had found in him and him for his own reasons, but one mistake sends the couple on a spiraling out of control situation...
Give the movie a shot, it might surprise you, in any event hope this review helps someone  decide on getting this movie.",1401408000,,918,4.350877192982456
8500843,4,B006MHZ1NQ,"The talented, gracious Alexis Bledel is known for her seven years as daughter Rory on the CW series ' Gilmore Girls ', with it's dry humor, rapid-fire dialogue, along with other definitely fleshed out characters.

' The Kate Logan Affair ' film was originally produced for the CBC in Canada as a TV movie. Alexis play a small town canadian police officer, Kate Logan, who runs into someone she mistakenly thinks is a fugitive. Seeing the error, she becomes very friendly & then steadiy more infatuated with the quiet (maybe a bit creepy) but oddly reserved man (Laurent Lucas). As an officer, she lowers her guard & becomes romantically involved with him, & he's somewhat hesitant about it. There's a totally surprising ' I didn't see that coming ' aspect to the film's last third - & it's enough to make you want to go back & see in detail as to how this developed.

Seemingly typical TV movie fare rolls over you with the unexpected - and how well Ms.
Bledel plays her vulnerable but strong, unaccustomedly different, character.",1369440000,,1030,4.716666666666667
