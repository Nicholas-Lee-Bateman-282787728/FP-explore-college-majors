8551415,5,B00AGKH4XA,"The Painted Stallion:  A fun, early western serial from Republicwith the customary mix of fictional characters and historical figures in fictional situationsshowcasing Crash Corrigan and, to a lesser extent, Hoot Gibson.  The print used here for this Cheezy Flicks release is fabulous, with good picture and sound.

FYI, I bought this from Cheezy Distribution via Amazon along with several other titles because they offered the best price, and they refunded me more than 90% of the system-generated per-title shipping costs, only charging me what it actually cost to ship the DVDs.  For the volume of titles I bought, purchasing them at a lower price from Cheezy and paying only five bucks to ship the lot was a far better deal than buying the DVDs at a higher list price from Amazon to get the free-shipping-over-$35 deal.",1433894400,2,823,5.029411764705882
