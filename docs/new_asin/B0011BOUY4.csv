8241421,5,B0011BOUY4,"These old Italian films have never been appreciated as they deserve.  With limited budgets they create action films with an almost epic feel. I give this 5 stars mainly for the retelling of ""The Trojan Horse"". A Steve Reeves gem & a much more accurate telling of the story. Coming more from the poems of Virgil than Homer you get a more detailed account from the Trojan view point. The newer version ""Troy"" has always bothered me because of the few Greek Kings & hero's that survived & made it back home King Menalaus won back Helen & took her back home to their children. Yes in both Homer's poems & Virgil's Helen was no nubile tween forced to marry a scared old warrior King but what by todays standard would be called a ""Cougar"" & adulteress that left her husband & children for the much younger Paris! Menalaus never dies & you lose the moral of the story in the new version when he does die!",1396137600,4,897,4.37125748502994
