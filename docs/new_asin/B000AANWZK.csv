8077434,3,B000AANWZK,"I had to send it back, because the disc was defective. It is a movie, not a stage production. The characters in the story were not appealing to me. An old fuddy-duddy ends up marring a servant girl. In my opinion, these characters behave in strange way: they are are not very sympathetic. Apparently, it is a story with a happy ending. You may not like the psychology behind each character. I have never seen any other production of this opera before. Perhaps, there are other presentation better than this one.",1413417600,,511,4.626373626373627
8077435,5,B000AANWZK,"It's something I'd caught with subtitles one Sunday afternoon, was sweet to the ear and a feast for the eyes.  Thank God I found it, after a few years of searching!

It's got remarkably listenable melodies, passion, coquettish flirtation and is so playful you find yourself smiling throughout.

The costumes and lighting are divine.  How they manage to capture the warmth of candlelight using stage lighting is remarkable.
Even if you don't like opera (I don't), this is intensely watchable and enjoyable.  You'll watch it over and over.",1392336000,,537,5.056818181818182
8077436,5,B000AANWZK,"I'm in agreement with Wagner ""Guri.""  This is one of the best opera movies I have seen.  Sure, the acting is big, as San Franciscan points out in his review, but this is a farcical opera buffa, so I find the acting appropriate.  I also think the characters were likable.  Sylvia Klein is not an iconic beauty like Anna Moffo (who is in the excellent 1957 movie), but she is sexy, pretty, and very funny and has an amazing voice.  Jos Carlos Leal is also very funny and has a great voice.  I really enjoyed Carla Camurati's fast paced direction, which is perfect for this absurd opera buffa.  What I like most about this film is Camurati's brilliant visual use of the orchestra--the way the orchestra appears at different points in the movie.  That is the best visual use of an orchestra in any opera movie I have seen.  Camurati's use of the music from the second aria, ""Ma quando la finisci,"" as an overture is a great touch (this opera actually has no overture). And speaking of Pergolesi's music, it is amazing. His score for this opera is such a masterpiece that even though La Serva Padrona was written as an intermezzo, it had a profound influence on opera: jump starting opera buffa, influencing the classical period, and starting the Querelle des Bouffons in France.  It is too bad this DVD seems to be out of print and is so hard to find.",1285545600,,1347,4.483606557377049
8077437,2,B000AANWZK,"The singing's great, the production values are great, and every detail of the carefully-assembled set and stage props glows.  So why the TWO stars?  Because of the overacting, and because these characters are portrayed as so disagreeable that you won't even want to spend 20 minutes with them.

I have to admit I have a soft spot for Pergolesi, and some of these arias just make you feel good-- if you close your eyes, that is.  All three main characters act to the back of the theater.  In brief, you have the obnoxious, big-headed maid, the rough and disagreeable master who has raised her and has a thing for her, and the mute servant (a portrayal, complete with buck teeth, sure to offend modern sensibilities).  There's lots of grimacing, pouting, and threatening to beat each other crammed into the short story.  Oh, did I mention there's a prelude to each act that gives away the entire plot?

Not worth tracking down.  I'll be keeping this to listen to audio-only, but if I had it to do again, I'd look for a CD at the library.",1246147200,2,1035,4.551351351351351
8077438,5,B000AANWZK,"If you are looking for the Opera buffa from Giovanni Battista Pergolesi (1710-1736), with beautiful musics, excellent singers, fantastic setting and outfit and a lot of emotion and fun, you must buy Serva Padrona right now!

It?s the best I've ever seen in my entire life!

Carla Camurati is a genius!

She is one of the best movie directors we know in Brazil.",1146182400,7,360,4.682539682539683
