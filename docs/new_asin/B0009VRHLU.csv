2325186,5,B0009VRHLU,"Comedian Dave Chappelle does what he does best in this outrageous and hilarious standup performance, which allows him to really push the envelope and go even farther than he does on his TV show. Taped in San Francisco at the famed Fillmore, Chappelle lets loose on such topics as black celebrities, what it's like to have raunchy fans of his TV show approach him while he's trying to enjoy Disneyland with his kids, Michael Jackson, Kobe Bryant and crackheads, of course.",1119225600,6,471,4.827160493827161

This go right up there with his ""Killin' Them Softly"" dvd well worth the money, Dave is one of the best comedians out there.

Respect Dave for keeping it real and not selling out, money can easily pervert ones thinking and standards. Found Killin' Them Softly to be better (my opinion), but still wanted to give this 5 stars. Enjoy Dave Chappelle & Paul Mooney while they are still alive...it has been proven, step on the wrong toes in this country they will off you faster than Tupac & Michael Jackson.",1397001600,,451,4.580246913580247

2325210,1,B0009VRHLU,I thought I would enjoy this because Dave Chappell has so much other stuff that was hilarious but this... not so much. Maybe this is from when he just got started??? It is collecting dust on my shelf.,1379203200,,200,4.2894736842105265

2325212,5,B0009VRHLU,"I wish this guy hadn't given up the game so early after he got his own show. I feel like we lost one of the greatest when he quit the business. This special is really solid, the jokes are all current to 2004, but I haven't heard anything about these topics in so long that they feel new all over again. Definitely worth what little I paid.",1366848000,,339,4.074626865671642
2325213,3,B0009VRHLU,It was a pretty good tape not as good as some of Dave Chapelle's tapes. I would still recommend it to others because you can never have enough Dave Chapelle.,1364083200,,157,4.266666666666667

2325216,5,B0009VRHLU,"Delivered quickly and the price was nice...this was a replacement copy.  I think my ex took the one I had previously.  Anyway, Dave's stand-up will have you falling on the floor laughing!",1354579200,,187,4.8125
2325217,2,B0009VRHLU,"Chappelle starts off strong in this, especially with the ""being held hostage by a homeless guy"" and the ""I smoked with Native Americans"" opening sections, but as his act goes on, the humor starts to lose its edge and Mr. Chappelle can't seem to keep himself afloat for the running time. He starts to degrade into things like shaving his testicles, some not-so-funny spiels on notorious trials, infamous kidnappings, sex with monkeys, George Washington, and just a rambling of things that just aren't nearly on the same level as his acclaimed Killing Them Softly.

The ""George Washington"" part is a terrible bomb, because Chappelle refers to his writing of the Declaration of Independence, which is, of course, a few decades earlier than his death, and Washington had nothing to do with that, as any half-educated person would know. Although he goes on to mention that he was a slave owner while also quoting the document, nothing can really make up for the fact that it isn't really nitpicking to be off about something so critical (Washington had nothing to do with the Declaration, of course). Then he goes onto some basic themes about race relations, none of which is really profound.

The rest is very meh. Nothing after the first half is all that funny or original. He touches on such common comedy issues without any real edge, and it drags. It's really a shame, but it just falls apart the more it goes on.

This is definitely no Killing Them Softly. It starts strong, but just starts to break down as it goes on, and Chappelle seems gradually more tired as it goes on. I can't imagine myself watching the second half again; maybe the first half because it's funny twice, but the second half is just not Chappelle quality.",1351555200,,1729,4.737541528239203
2325218,5,B0009VRHLU,Really hard to keep it to the word limit without feeling like i'm taking away from what is one of the best stand up comedy routines i've ever watched. actually i feel this way about his other two as well. amazing. could watch it over and over...,1343952000,,245,4.23404255319149

2325221,4,B0009VRHLU,"This isn't the best I've seen of Chappelle, but it's definitely funny. I bought it after seeing clips on youtube (bits on ""grape drink"", Kobe Bryant, and being held hostage on a bus were some of the funniest).",1313366400,,209,4.526315789473684
2325222,5,B0009VRHLU,This guy never fails to amaze me ...... I watch all his stand ups over and over again and they never get old he really pushes the barriers of our ethics and shame and does it without a care and for that it makes his acts much more appealing,1300752000,,240,3.9183673469387754
2325223,5,B0009VRHLU,As far  as the dvd's condition goes it was in prime form. This dvd itself is some of Dave's funniest material ever. Great laugh from start to finish.,1299888000,,149,4.321428571428571

2325237,5,B0009VRHLU,"Maybe not as great as his other stand up special, but not every piece of work you do can be your best. This is still worth buying and watching over and over again to laugh at alone or with friends. Enjoyable. Quotable.",1244073600,,218,4.214285714285714
2325238,5,B0009VRHLU,"If you are a Dave Chappelle fan or a person that likes comedy, this is definately one of the funniest stand-up shows ever.. You will laugh harder than ever, Daves insight on Aids and Monkeys, celeberities and on white peoples food and drinks are one of the funniest bits ever.. Dave chappelle is clearly one of the greatest comedians of all times, probably the best since Richard Pryor...",1240185600,,388,4.720588235294118
2325239,5,B0009VRHLU,"Though it be his masterpiece, I pray this is not the final recorded stand-up performance of Dave Chappelle's career.  Despite the best efforts of a speculative and intrusive fan base, and a cold and cutthroat Hollywood work environment, Dave Chappelle found a way to delve deep into his soul and produce for us a work of comedy every bit as witty and insightful as ever have been recorded.  When the suits of Comedy Central and the proprietors of comedy's old guard finish marching lockstep to Richard Pryor, George Carlin, Eddie Murphy, Lenny Bruce, and Bill Cosby, and finally turn around, they would realize their dwindling entourage and the exodus of youth towards comics like Chappelle.  That ""The Chappelle Show"" was the monitary success it was and created the social impact it did, despite its short run time and cable television venue, speaks volumes of this man's talent.
  ""For What It's Worth"" delivers social commentary without being preachy in a discussion about ""How old is 15 really?"", skillfully pokes fun at racial differences in bits surrounding passing out at a white persons house and drinking grape Kool-Aid, and broaches the oft treaded territory of relationships without resorting to the same ol' ""women are emotional"" and ""men are clueless"" schticks.  There is no greater evidence of why you should own this performance, than his closing bit ""Long Live Chappelles"" where Dave talks about his 3 year old son making him a macaroni necklace.  It's such an incredible bit, and my personal all-time favorite, because it shows a man as vulnerable, thoughtful, and caring, which, unfortunately, are aspects of men not often expressed on stage.  Maybe if Dave continues to amass fans at the rate he has, comedy will be forced to evolve into a Chappelle form, a form with broad appeal that doesn't sacrifice intellect or humor.

Take this home and take it in.",1239840000,,1874,4.980769230769231
2325240,5,B0009VRHLU,Dave Chappelle is one of the funniest comedians I have ever seen. His observational as well as his political humor will leave one rolling on the floor. Great DVD!,1236729600,,162,4.620689655172414
2325241,5,B0009VRHLU,"If you like Dave Chappelle, you'll love this! I laughed so hard i cried! I've watched it several times and it is still funny! I just can't get enough! He is brilliant the way he ties everything together in a nice package and how he has certain running jokes that he finds a way to tie into his act later on. This man is comedy!

2325242,5,B0009VRHLU,"Dave Chappelle is the most talented comedian we have out of the current generation being groomed for stardom.  Now I know what those that aren't familiar with the comedic ranks will say something like, ""Well I've heard so many great things about this Dane Cook guy.""  Well that's your first mistake, comparing Dane Cook to a comedian (Cook's well known for plagiarism, just ask Robin Williams.  Where do you think Dane got the run around stage frantically routine?).
  But back to Dave, you know how you can tell he's entertaining - by showing how much fun he's having on stage.  And he does that here, you can see it when he tells a joke and then stumbles like he does on this DVD under the fit of his own joy.
  The topics he uses are wonderful, and if you like Chappelle Show then you'll know what i'm talking about.  He touches on everything you'd exect from the show.  I won't go into it cause i'll let Dave offend you if you're too sensitive.
  I've lent this to a number of my friends, always wanting to watch it one more time before i give it up, showing you how confident how much this is a great DVD.
  The best way to put it:  This will be one of those stand up routines you'll be repeating lines from to others.",1201996800,,1223,4.302631578947368
2325243,5,B0009VRHLU,"The first time I watched this video, I was with my husband who recently died of cancer.  He loved funny videos and this one took us both so far out of our sorrow and into our ""Happy Place!""  I laughed so hard that my husband kept saying to me, ""Pammie! Breathe! Breathe!"" I couldn't catch my breath!  The part about the ""hold up"" on the bus... OMG!  That was hillarious!  And the monkey!  It went on and on... I didn't get a breather until it was completely OVER because it was funny, start to finish - true Dave Chappelle style!  It was GREAT!  And Thanks Dave, for the laughs, when laughs weren't always easy to come by... This will always be one of my favorite stand-up comedies of all time!",1199664000,,694,4.2846153846153845

2325255,5,B0009VRHLU,"This is one of the best stand-up specials I've seen in my life thus far, and easily my favorite by Dave Chappelle. He really is at the top of his game here, and shows why he was such a highly respected comedian and entertainer. Most of the bits here are simply hilarious, and even the bits that are less than great are still far better than most other comics out there (*cough* Dane Cook *cough*). I've seen this special over a dozen times, and his delivery here is so spot-on, and his timing so perfect, that it seems more funny each time I watch it. I don't know what the heck he's doing now, but if he ever puts out another DVD like this one, I'll buy it the day it comes out.",1186358400,,679,4.112781954887218

2325257,5,B0009VRHLU,"Dave is hilarious and energetic. The jokes  and his standup are classic. And you will be rolling on the floor, grabbing you gut, trying to catch your breath because you're laughing so hard.

From beginning to end, from Comedy Central to DVD, Chappelle is our generation's greatest comedian...hands down. He will have you laughing, while poking fun at the stereotypes we hold about people, society and ourselves. Interesting social commentary in the form of standup.

If you love laughing, ""For What's It's Worth"" is worth every dollar.",1170633600,4,535,5.126436781609195
2325258,4,B0009VRHLU,"Chappelle's accessibility (and his racially charged & sympathetic humor) sparkle in this live stand-up appearance.  This guy is about as likable as it gets, his characteristic wit pulling the audience in even as it knuckle-rubs their heads.  On this disc, Dave discusses everything from crackheads (no surprise there), Native Americans, smoking in public, the American justice system, and grape juice.  Even when his humor is topical (e.g. OJ and Michael Jackson), it retains a sense of warmth and giggle-worthy rib-nudging that makes this recording both hilarious and re-watchable.  The only drawback is that it is lamentably short (it barely clocks in at an hour) and the disc is notably lacking in any special features whatsoever.",1168560000,3,733,5.3478260869565215
2325259,5,B0009VRHLU,"If you're like me, and enjoy the Chapelle Show, you'll find that this program is a little different: no clips, just a pure standup comedy programm. And Dave is killing here. He takes on topics like where AIDS came from and different drinks with black and white people. Calls the greenback ""baseball cards with slave owners on them"". Just great comedy with a clear political undertone.

In this context he discusses the wavering standpoint of society towards fifteen year olds.

Wunderful, meaningful, inspiring, just plain funny!

So go get this - And get ""Killin' them softly"" too!",1156118400,12,582,4.979381443298969
2325260,3,B0009VRHLU,"There is a theme here in this near-hour of comedy:  Chappelle's obsession with his loins.  From the beginning joke with his Matrix-dodging of a fluid mike, to the end with his discovery of what his son is, we get a stoner-ephiphany of what the father-function is.  Perhaps pure Chappelle, undiluted, free of the Comedy Channel.  Unlike in his  30 min Comedy Central show, here Chappelle is able to sketch out in full his twisted, devious, and comedic genius.  This show feels more like art, but it does not make good tv.  With less bellyaching laffs than a Chappell's Show, this still gives us a raw look at his talent...for better or worse.",1152403200,2,641,4.669642857142857

I have watched ""for what it's worth"" at least five times in its entirety, and it gets better and better every time!!!!!!!!!!!!!! if you don't like it then something must be wrong because i am in tears from the second i press play til well after the credits start rolling.

""i want some apple drink! its green!"" ""Chocolate?! this is doo doo baby!"".. i could honestly go on forever.

2325262,1,B0009VRHLU,"I love Dave's TV show, it's really hilarious, so I was expecting a lot when I bought this DVD as part of a two-pack with Richard Pryor. After 10 minutes of Dave, I started thinking, ""when am I going to laugh?"" After 20 minutes, I got bored so I started listening to the audience for this live show. They were laughing (a little) & not all that often, so I concluded that it wasn't just my mood, this just wasn't funny. After 30 minutes, I turned it off. I can tell you that the first 30 minutes is a waste of your time, even if you're a Dave fan, as I am. I can't tell you if the rest is funny or not, because I didn't watch it. Maybe I was expecting too much. Maybe I was expecting Richard Pryor, which I had watched first. My recommendation is either to buy only the Pryor DVD (which is terrific), or watch the Chappelle DVD first, so it won't suffer by comparison.",1144454400,5,867,4.105882352941176

Don't get me wrong, I love Chapelle's irreverent,somewhat juvenile, High School humer, but I can only take so many Crack, farting, masterbating and weed jokes. The same type of material that seemed to have worked so well in ""Killen Them Softly"" just seems to fail so badly in this stand up act. One of if not the worst joke he said all night was when he was talking about having Botox surgery...on his balls...to get the wrinkles out. When he said that I just shook my head in total embarassment and disbelief. Embarassment because that was actually supposed to be the punchline, disbelief,because that was acually supposed to be the punchline. Okay their were a few funny parts, in fact the joke he made about Kobe Bryant playen for his freedom was damn funny. Also the joke he made about telling young black kids to rap or play basketball if they want to make it out of the ghetto. But those jokes were few and far between. If your looking for something funny from Chapelle as far as his stand-up act, I highly recommend ""Killen Them Softly"". Leave this bulls**t on the shelf.",1137715200,3,1202,4.647887323943662

Some of the jokes are mildly amusing and they are fairly well-sprinkled through the performance. It is disappointing though, because Dave has the potential to be second only to Chris Rock.

It is probably worth seeing this dvd, but it's far fromb being a classic.",1136678400,2,430,4.8108108108108105

Dave doesn't seem to be enjoying himself doing standup in this show.  The jokes aren't sharp, and he lacks the energy he usually exudes.  There are some funny moments, but I don't know...this just falls so short of everything else he's done.

2325282,5,B0009VRHLU,"I loved this stand-up routine. I actually got the chance to see this routine live in Atlantic City before it was on TV. I couldn't wait for the DVD to be released.

While some of the bits in the routine were a little longer than they need to (i.e. the sex with monkeys bit), his bits that are a social commentary more than make up for it.

His bit on ""How old is 15?"" is simply brilliant.",1130371200,,388,4.025974025974026
2325283,4,B0009VRHLU,"With the demise of Comedy Central's smash hit Chappelle's Show, comedian Dave Chappelle returns to what made him a comedy star: standup.  For What It's Worth finds Chappelle in San Francisco for this hour long comedy special, where he lets his feelings on certain subjects be known.  Chappelle covers the allegations against Michael Jackson, why every black man must have an alibi, smoking marijuana with American Indians, black celebrities, and of course, sex with monkeys.  The material isn't the best we've heard from him (in fact there is a bit of a stretch between some laugh out loud moments), but he is at his best when satirizing race differences, and later on when he discusses the Elizabeth Smart kidnapping case and how she could have handled things differently compared to a little heard kidnapping case around the same time involving a young, black girl in Philadelphia.  All in all, For What It's Worth is full of some great comedic moments in a triumphant return to standup comedy for Chappelle, and fans will definitely want to check this out, but the DVD itself is a rip off at it's list price because there's hardly any Special Features here at all.",1130025600,8,1167,4.849246231155779

2325295,2,B0009VRHLU,"I'am a Dave Chappelle fan but I did not find this stand-up routine all that hilarious. There were some funny moments but not nearly the amount of laughs I had from his TV show and his previous stand-up DVD Killin Them Softly.

He seemed to take jokes too far in hopes that it would get funnier. They didn't. I would only encourage you to get this DVD if you are a HUGE Chappelle fan and want to see some more of his work but be prepared.

I still like Dave Chappelle's comedy, but this DVD is not his best work.",1128124800,7,511,4.1
2325296,5,B0009VRHLU,"I have to say this is one of the funniest standup routines I have seen to date. I can watch this performance once a month and still laugh a lot. Together with ""Killing Them Softly,"" Mr. Chappelle's standup 'stands up' to and is better in some ways than his series in my opinion.
The impromptu comments during the performance add to the comfortable attitude Mr. Chappelle exudes in front of the audience (see: Michael Jackson curing cancer), and let the viewer know that his standup might not be as routine and totally rehearsed as that of other comedians.
While Comedy Central overplays his series and other comedy special (edited to death) to squeeze an extra buck out of the public, it's good to know there is lesser-seen Chappelle material available that the average annoying ""I'm Rick James, [...]""-quoter/superficial fan has not seen.

This performance is definitely worth obtaining.",1127174400,3,888,5.0

2325299,3,B0009VRHLU,"I love comedy. I've been watching stand up comedy, comedians, doing comedy since I was 14 years old (I'm 32 now). Even with my slightly biased preference for male black comedians, I have to digress and say that Chappelle is a mediocre, at best above average, stand up talent. I saw his stand up act, forgot what it was called already -- pretty forgettable, on DVD several years ago and thought he was just okay. He had some funny bits about cops sprinkling crack on people, but overall I wasn't laughing so hard I couldn't see.

This stand up act confirms my assessment that Dave Chappelle is great at doing sketch comedy on his TV shows, but his stand up material just doesn't fly. I think it has partly to do with the fact that the material on his show is co-written by his good friend, Brennan, and fellow actors on the show. There were some funny parts on his stand up act. I thought the middle segue about Jah Rule, talking at his old high school, getting stoned with white folks was pretty hilarious. The s*#! streak on his shirt was plain out riotous. But, almost 80 percent of his act was just amusing at best, forgettable for the most part.

I would say the funniest s*#! I have heard in recent years is Dave Attell's Skanks for the Memories. I had it playing on the CD player on my drive home from Santa Cruz, and it was NON STOP hardcore laughing the whole 60 minutes. There were times when I was laughing so hard, I couldn't see and almost drove off the road! That dude is PURE talent. Another great act that I saw recently was on Jamie Foxx's Def Jam Comedy DVD's. His name is Lavelle Crawford, and that fat black bastard had me rolling so hard, I had to stand up cause I was laughing so damn hard! Even Jamie Foxx's last stand up act in Oakland was unbelievable. His bit about Bill Clinton had me cramped over laughing so hard! Although, his first stand up release on DVD totally sucked.

Anyways, Dave, go back to doing your TV show. Your stand up isn't so hot.",1126051200,2,1976,4.335135135135135
2325300,5,B0009VRHLU,"Dave Chappelle is the Richard Pryor of his time. His honest humor and edgy style brings a mixture of demographics. True that some people don't understand it and get upset; but if you take it for what is worth (like the name of the title) you will find yourself laughing harder than you thought you could. For What It's Worth holds as an instant classic with his awesome routine. However, I see that people are comparing it to Killing Them Softly, saying it not as great. But that's not true! It's remarkable. Forget what the others say, it's Chappelle, he's always funny. So Lighten up and watch it.",1125360000,,599,4.555555555555555
2325301,3,B0009VRHLU,"Not nearly as good as his previous special, ""Killing Them Softly"", Dave Chappelle's new cable stand-up special may have been destined to come off feeling mediocre in comparison. After a star-making second season of his hit comedy series, ""Chappelle's Show"", Dave seems less hungry on the second go round. Touching such subject matter as fame, intercourse with monkeys, and famous black celebrity trials, ""For What It's Worth"" is a hardly a failure in the humor department but it just isn't the home run that ""Softly"" was. It's a good time nonetheless.",1125187200,5,551,5.065934065934066
2325302,3,B0009VRHLU,"Normally, if a comedian gets a whiff of early success, he can't seem to stop himself from milking it for all it's worth, ad nauseum.  Dave Chappelle, on the other hand, is that rarity in showbiz that doesn't seem interested in outproducing the demand for his material.  The unfortunate results of that are what we see in For What It's Worth, which I believe to be a desperate attempt by DCS Inc. to feed Dave's comedy-starved fans anything they can get their hands on.

 I am one of those comedy-starved fans.  After seeing this dvd, I am starting to lose hope that Dave will ever be back to favor us with top new material.

As usual, Dave is comfortable and uninhibited in front of his live audience.  There are some laugh out loud moments here.  There are also plenty of long stretches without a chuckle. Mostly I sat squirming just a bit as I waited for the next LOL moment. Yes I know it's hard to believe, but Dave's typical genius failed many times.  It may have been due to his choice of subjects; among other things,  Michael Jackson molesting kids, how to seduce a monkey,  and Kobe Bryant. Even the great DC was unable to wring humor out of that stuff.  Then again, if all that sounds hilarious to you I stand corrected.

The lone special feature of ""left of center - mini-moments with Dave"" was an unremarkable series of outtakes from his practice session, filmed left of center.  Pass.

Don't waste your money buying this Dvd, but it might be worth a rental if you're really hard up next Friday night.

2325303,4,B0009VRHLU,This was funny. I caught this on television when it came on. I bought the DVD for my collection. I liked his first stand-up Killing Them Softly better. This was more like an updated version of the old one. It seemed like I laughed harder on the other one. I almost expect him to say certain stuff now so it doesn't catch me off suprise as much.
