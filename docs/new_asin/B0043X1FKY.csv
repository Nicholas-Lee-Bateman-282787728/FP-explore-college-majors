4258277,5,B0043X1FKY,"I love the film noir genre and this is a real cool movie, good love story! I love movies that have many twists and turns and that are hard to predict.",1355443200,,150,3.870967741935484
4258278,4,B0043X1FKY,"This was a movie that touched on many subjects. There was love and jealousy, a man's refusal to let a woman go when it was clear she did not love him; there was the ageing football player who was having problems coming to terms with his mortality not to mention his poor financial status; there was corporate greed as well as the malfesance of crooked corporate lawyers who duped their clients. This movie had it all.

Jeff Bridges (In Perhaps His Finest Role To that Point) is remarkable as Terry Brogan, an ageing football player for the now defunct LA Outlaws. Brogan is cut because of injury and as a result has to turn to a crooked businessman named Jake. Jake hires Terry to find his girlfriend who has fled to Mexico after seriously injuring him. Brogan heads to Mexico and finds Jessie but falls in love with her. The two stay in Mexican paradise but this time Hank Sully, former coach of Outlaws is sent to retrieve the girl. A fight ensues and Sully is slain. Jessie returns to America in terror, while Brogan follows on her heels.

James Woods' character (Jake) was a man who refused to let go of a woman. He was so blinded by love that he could not see how his obsession with Jessie was internecine to him. This refusal to let go of a woman who does not love him in the end leads to his destruction. However, this is difficult for all men to realize. The love of a woman destroys men from all walks of life.

I won't give away the rising action and climax of this film, which I might add were original for the time period. This was a refreshing film, and I all the more like it because it was crisply edited. I was able to view the scenes of the movie that were cut on DVD. The director and editor did a remarkable job. Leonard Maltin gave this film Two and Half stars. That is too harsh in my opinion. I give this movie Four Stars for the acting and the production. The casting was remarkeable too. Saul Rubinek, in one of his first roles was phenomenal! So were some of the others in the film, like Alex Karras. There can be no doubt that Bridges showed his true mettle in this movie. Too, he and Rachel Ward had incredible chemistry together. The film encapsulates the 1980s very, very well. While it is no Body Double or Scarface, it will definately keep you entertained. Buy this movie and you won't be disappointed.

I liked the subplot of how football players are exploited like slaves by the powerful elite owners. Their playing time is limited, and as a result they are always replaceable. That is what happened to Brogan. Coming back too soon to help the team causes him to reaggrivate his injury which only gets him cut in the end by heartless owners. When he turns to the man who represented him (Who He Helped Make Much Money) he is given the cold shoulder. It is a cold world out there, and Against All Odds shows this from a football player's perspective. I identified with Brogan and felt for him, even though he should have been better at saving his money and investing his finances (By His Own Admission In The Film). Despite his character flaws (Which Included Point Shaving), Brogan was for the most part a decent guy. I was pleased to see how things ended up for him at the end of the movie.

4258279,5,B0043X1FKY,It was here on Time. The condition was fine.  There was NOTHING wrong with it. I have yet to watch it. Thank you. This 20 word thing is very irritating.,1337040000,,152,4.066666666666666
4258280,4,B0043X1FKY,"A ripped Jeff Bridges plays a football player for a fictitious L. A. pro team.  When injuries get him cut from the team, he re-connects with a former pal who earns his living from gambling and a high end night club.  Jake (a slimy James Woods) also has Terry (Bridges) by the short hairs for shaving points in a game early in his career.  In this remake of the classic film noir ""Out of the Past,"" Jake wants Terry to track down his girlfriend who stabbed him and made off with $50K.  In a further complication, Jessie (Rachel Ward) is also the daughter of the football team's owner, Mrs. Wyler played by Jane Greer.

In a wonderful bit of casting, Greer played the girl on the run in the original ""Out of the Past.""  There is a back story involving bribing public officials so that Mrs. Wyler and her newish husband (Richard Widmark) can develop prime land overlooking the city.  Terry travels to Cozumel on Jake's ""dime"" looking for Jesse.  He finds her, and after some flirtatious byplay they begin a 2 week romance on the beaches of the Caribbean.  When this film was released, much of the talk was about the hot sex scene inside a natural steam room.  By today's standards it's pretty mild stuff.

Eventually the money runs out so they make plans to return to the U. S.  Jake, tired of waiting sends another one of his cronies to find the couple.  He is the thuggish conditioning coach of the football team, played by former NFL great Alex Karras.  In a brief fight, Jessie shoots Sully (Karras) and flees, leaving Terry to deal with Sully's body.  When Terry returns to L. A. he looks up Jake only to find Jessie is again playing house with him.  Jake has another assignment, but Terry begins to see a double cross coming.

Directed by Taylor Hackford, Terry's fight ""against all odds"" to clear his name sometimes gets in melodrama mode and feels like a drawn out soap opera.  Fortunately the performances by Woods, Bridges and even Greer in her small role, save the film.  Ward and Bridges certainly look good together rolling around inside their shimmering suntanned skin which I think was the marketing push at the time.  Ultimately a worthwhile film but no match for the original.

This viewing was on the DVD ""Special Edition"" which looks pretty good on a Blu ray player.  The audio options include 2-channel Dolby Surround and a 4.0 Dolby Digital.  My receiver says the rear channel is mono out of both speakers.  In any case it sounds fine especially when emphasizing the score by Michel Columbier and jazz guitarist Larry Carlton.  The closing credits include the Phil Collins hit from the film title.",1330214400,,2615,4.620390455531453
4258281,5,B0043X1FKY,"I'm 76 and seen lots of film.  This one is worth watching.  I read some of the reviews putting it down.  I don't know which film they saw.  Not as good as the original Out of the Past but in today's junk that passes as entertainment it stands above the many and satisfies the few discerning folks that are left.

Casting is superb.  Getting Jane Greer into this film is worth the wait.  She is not the delicious femme fatale of Out of the Past but still a knockout.  Jeff is Jeff.  Always worth watching. See it you will not be disappointed.",1309046400,3,541,4.2254901960784315
4258282,5,B0043X1FKY,"When we see the mature Jeff Bridges in the year 2010-11 picking up his Best Actor Oscar, we see one mighty fine looking guy who makes all other males his age feel like running to the gym to look as fabulous as he.

When we see this younger Jeff in ""Against All Odds"", we're so stunned by his ravishing good looks, sizzling sex appeal and charisma that we have to sit up and watch the screen for every scene that he's in. Because when he's not on screen displaying his phenomenal sexuality, the picture goes flat. This movie also proves that you don't have to be X-rated to raise the temperatures of your viewers. And after we've seen it, we realize that there was nothing graphic shown--except for just a split second of love-making, deep in shadows and filmed in long shot where you only see sihoulettes.

No other movie male star has looked so amazingly hot and beautiful on screen as this stunning young Adonis who was captured at the very peak of his beauty.  His blue yes, his stunning torso, sun streaked locks and physical movements are all lovingly preserved forever on the screen by director Taylor Hackford. The director does something quite interesting here: insttead of having the rather anemic femme star, Rachel Ward (does anybody remember her?)as the sex interest, he turns Bridges into the red-hot lust object. And no wonder. In scene after scene, Ward is desperate to rip Jeff's shirt off, and later all of his clothes. In one extraordinary scene, they've just made love. Both are nearly naked. Ward rests her head on Jeff's chest and caresses it hungrily as he tells her about his failure as a football star. The camera moves into a close-up of Jeff's face and if possible, he conveys both sadness and carnal desire at the same time. Their passion is so sweaty and hot I would love to have been a fly on the wall to see what really happened between takes.

When he's not on the screen, the movie suffers. Curiously, the credits showcase Rachel Ward as the top star, with Bridges second. When the movie came out, it was Jeff who astounded the critics and his fans with his performance.  This goes to show that if you have true star magic--and the right scripts and Lady Luck hellping you out--you can go on and on over the decades like Jeff Bridges has done and grow greater every year.",1304726400,,2303,4.566585956416465

4258288,4,B0043X1FKY,"I caught this one again on getTV and it was better than I remembered when I was lucky enough to watch its original release on the big screen in the mid-1980s. AAO has an impeccable pedigree, being (more or less) a remake of the 1947 noir classic Out of the Past, and no, its not as good as the original, but is a respectable, well-heeled example of neo-noir.
The cast is pretty darn good: Bridges convinces as the footballer whose glory days are over but who is still pretty cool, Alex Karras is menacing in a well-meaning sort of way, and noir legends Richard Widmark and Jane Greer lend strong support. In fact I wish Jane Greer had been given more scenes.
Anyhow the film goes south for me during the romantic middle section in Mexico, which is little more than glorified travelogue with some steamy scenes thrown in. Alas, for all the beauty  and indeed all of AAO is beautiful to look at  Cozumel and even Chichen Itza just aren't all that exotic anymore. Too bad because the Mexico interludes in Out of the Past were among the films best. Finally Alex Karras intervenes in a high intensity scene that gets us back into the main story and things improve.
Of course James Woods excels at playing intense, near-unhinged types, and the character of Jake Wise is a doozy, as is his performance. Indeed, even surrounded by such heavyweight talent, with the possible exception of Miss Greer his is the real star turn in AAO. The one weak link in the casting is Rachel Ward, who looks great but just doesnt project enough femme fatale edge, at least not in the same way Jane Greer did as Cathy Moffett in the original. And I confess I much preferred the dark ending of Out of the Past.
Even so Against All Odds for me just ekes out four stars, mainly for the cast and its high gloss look.",1470614400,,1786,4.442073170731708

4258314,2,B0043X1FKY,"Jeff Bridges made this film worthwhile to see.  He's a good actor, much better than Rachel Ward who seems mismatched as his seductive, romantic co-star.  James Woods is fine as a fast-talking slime-ball.  Really great to see Jane Greer.  She was in Out of the Past, the 1947 movie based on the same original novel.  Out of the Past was so very much better with richer characters and actors, more backstory and tighter direction.  In Against All Odds, it seemed like the two leads were drawn to each other without enough reason, considering the danger in doing so.  The music swelled loudly in and out, drowning out and muffling the dialogue. This movie will not stand the test of time other than as being part of Jeff Bridges' filmography.",1410307200,,739,4.682170542635659
4258315,4,B0043X1FKY,"Nothing to brag about, not even about the restricted audience. Los Angeles in all its shady business dealing with city planning and city development, no cinema industry, but a lot of football.

A football player gets kicked out of the Outlaws, the football team, or at least one of the football teams, of Los Angeles after a broken shoulder or something like that. He gets involved with some ""friend"" who is as crooked as my arm when I blow my nose. That ""friend"" wants him to find his disappeared girl friend. She is the daughter of an important business woman who is doing in city development, meaning real estate speculation for the rich, the very rich, away from Beverley Hill. Behind her there is a man who is the real maker of deals, generally with money or blackmailing.

Our kicked out football player accepts to look for the girl, falls in love, brings her back against all odds since a killer had been sent after them and then he manages to put his hand on the treasure chest of a crooked lawyer just after the latter was killed and the former has the power to blackmail everyone he wants. That's what I call a kushy pushy job. Lovely Jubbly!

So he accepts to disappear, he gets trials with football teams out of Los Angeles, but he cannot get the girl. Too bad.

And that's all. It is no new thing that city planning and real estate development are rotten to the core. It is no new thing that sports competition and football games are in a way or another ""arranged"" by some people who make money out of it. They say rigged like the football players who are rigged with their padding and masks and helmets, etc. You are sure to win when the result has been well cushioned ahead of time. So the film is in no way a masterpiece, except maybe if you could speak of a B masterpiece, the way some speak of B movies.

4258321,5,B0043X1FKY,"This film really took me by surprise, I did not expect much from it except a romantic melodrama where the good guy gets the girl at the end.  Well, it sure is not that type of a movie.  The lines between good guy and bad guy are really blurry here, and the love in this one comes with a ""double edge sword"".

 This movie borders on-the-line between movies like ""9 1/2 Weeks"" (1986)- ""Cocktail"" (1988) - ""Tequila Sunrise"" (1988) -  ""Revenge"" (1990) - and ""Breathless"" (1983).  I would dare to classify this one as a romantic thriller/ with a very neo-noir plot-line.  The acting is really good, the twists and turns make the movie even more interesting, and the chemistry between Jeff Bridges and Rachel Ward is purely amazing...they seem genuinely in love with each other...the scenes that involve their love making are HOT HOT HOT!!! The movie also stars Richard Widmark, an actor famous for his dark character portrayals in 1940's and 1950's noir films.

8415405,5,B0043X1FKY,"One of the best movies of the 80's! Jeff Bridges is amazing, as always. Rachel Ward is the woman in the middle, playing both guys against each other to perfection. She has her reasons and James Woods is as always the best bad ass ever. He plays them so well!
Love it so much! Will watch it again and again and the sound track, superb!.",1519603200,,335,4.1692307692307695

8415408,2,B0043X1FKY,"Insipid 80s trash. Dont get me wrong. I like the occasional trashy movie. But this flick is so gauche, suspension of belief is just too much work.

The plot: Really great-looking young American airheads with really great-looking hair on the lam south of the border from slimy L.A. bar-owner Woods who wants to do very bad things. Predictability ensues.

Ward is perfect as spoiled trust fund skank who uses perfectly cast horny football-hunk boy-toy Bridges & then dumps him like a sweaty Reebok after she murders his pal & returns home to snaky Woods, who is perfect as venal sleazeball.

In fact, everything about this trite 2 hour soft-core fluff is a little too perfect. Especially the hair. Did I mention their hair is perfect? Do you care? Does any of this make sense? If not, then its an accurate synopsis of the movie. Even Richard Widmark, totally out of place in this cheesy melodrama, is wasted & doesnt have enough lines to give it any cred.

Replete with throbbing 80s synthesizer soundtrack, this turgid tales only redeeming quality is the breathtaking Cancun/Cozumel/Chichen Itza location footage that makes this otherwise tacky Taylor Hackford hack job barely tolerable.",1510531200,,1186,5.00507614213198
