  With the 2d kind all you need is pencil and paper and a movie camera capable of shooting one frame at a time. Then there are plenty of great books that explain the drawing techniques. But with 3d animation how and where do you even start?

  I started by rushing out and buying different affordable even freeware software pacages that claimed to be ""easy"" and intuitive with fabulous illustrations of what had been done with it. After weeks of reading the tech manuals and creating sorry models that did little more than spin in place, much less any thing that looked like Toy Story, I was frustrated.

  Then along came this DVD by a man who had taught himself how to animate and with the focus on how to make a character move.

Jeff shows a lot of principles that were perfected by the 2d artist of the likes of Disney that make a character appear to express emotions. He shows how to apply these same principles in the world of the 3d software. Jeff shows how to use the tools in the software that are common to most 3d softwares to adjust, fine tune, and correct little glitches that will be encountered as you seek to make the character do what you want.

  Since I don't have the time to model my own characters I bought a software called ""POSER"" which has a number of characters that come with the software as well as a large community that sells custom human and toon characters that are already rigged and ready to animate.

  As I watched the video over and over I began to understand the tools uses. This was a great aide in shortening the learning curve. Seeing it done is far better than reading how its done.",1149638400,2,1831,4.35693215339233

This DVD was a pleasant surprise!  Well worth the money I spent.  The DVD is split into 3 main sections:  tools & techniques, and then artistic principles, and the last one is a complete animation example from start to finish.  The first 2 sections were about 1 1/2 hours each while the last one was about an hour.

On watching the tools & techniques section, I was a little worried because the DVD uses Animation Master and I use Maya.  I thought it would be hard to follow, but I was glad to know that the tools in Animation Master were pretty much the same as in Maya.  They have similar bones, IK, FK, dope sheet, graph editor.  And the way he teaches the tools is more like how to use the tools, not which button to push on the menu.  For example he showed how to use the dope sheet and graph editor correctly in a structured way so your animations are easy to change if need be.  After watching this, I liked that he taught it this way instead of a ""click here and here"", because you really get a sense of how and why to do certain things in animation.

There were lots of small examples spread out through the first part.  Now this is where I found the DVD to be most helpful.  I read lots of books on animation, but never really 'got it' from just reading.  Seeing examples in full motion really helps out a lot.

The second section was all about animation as an art.  He talked about principles like squash and stretch, weight, staging, keyframing, secondary action.  Too many to list right now.  Each little chapter had lots of examples showing you how to animate the principle correctly.  I loved the fact that he showed lots of common mistakes and then how to fix them.  This section is really where you learn how to make your animations look good and it was pretty entertaining.

Oh yeah, the entertainment factor is also a big plus.  I watched through this 4 hr DVD in one sitting, which is no small feat!  They used lots of different footage in their examples, which I thought keeps it fresh and active.  I've seen other 3d training videos that just have the computer screen and the guy talking, and that's all you see.  If you think that sounds boring, well it is.  This DVD was different in that they had the teacher basically talking to the audience and then they would cut to animation examples or the computer screen to further illustrate what the teacher was saying. And the music was cool too.

One thing that did bug me a little was the sound.  The background hiss is pretty high, which was annoying, but you could still easily hear everything clearly.  It just wasn't DVD quality audio though.

The last section on the DVD was a full animation example from concept to finally rendering.  I enjoyed this part a lot, because I got to see how a professional animator animates.  He not only tells you what he is doing, but also his mental critiques on the animation and also what he is planning next.  When mistakes happens, he told you how to fix them.  If everything before this section was theory, then this section is the practical.

All in all, a great DVD to learn from.  I know I will be re-watching this one a few times.",1120003200,2,3293,4.346469622331691
