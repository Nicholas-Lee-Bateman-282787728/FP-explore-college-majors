337866,5,6301465628,"This has been probably my favorite movie with Patrick Dempsey since it came out.

On the surface, it's just a campy romp.  But there are just so many enjoyable levels to it, and each person does such a great job with their role.  Elizabeth Daily is just adorable with the little squeaks and worried noises she makes in one scene.

It has some great quotes that I love throwing at people who think they know every line from every movie.  And even at the most ridiculous points, it's just fun.  It never goes over that line that just makes you want to roll your eyes and hit the eject button.

It has some great music (Brian Wilson's ""Walk the Line"" leading the pack) and the women throughout are quite beautiful.  And watching Patrick's character's development through the film is very enjoyable.

It's not going to impress your friends at Mensa, but it will certainly be enjoyable for anyone you introduce to it.",1433203200,,912,4.580246913580247

338102,5,6301465628,"Loverboy starting Patrick Dempsey is a much early version of Rod Schinder's hit, Duece Bigalow Male Gigalow. Duece followed much of the same storyline as Loveryboy.

In Loverboy, Patrick Dempsey is a less than stellar performing college student who has been living with his college girlfriend for the last two semesters. (his girlfriend's name is Jenny, she later played Jennifer on Saved by the Bell in the Zack falls for the Nurse episode).

Dempsey is not allowed to return to school due to failing grades, so he stays home with his parents and works to get money and go back to school to be with his girlfriend, who broke up with him because he won't mention her to his parents.

He gets a job at Senor Pizza and while out delivering a box of pizza, meets the eye of a pretty girl who he follows to a clothing store. He asks her out but she rejects him because he is only a kid, as she says. One of the other girls in the workplace overhears the conversation and the two of them hit it off. Turns out that the other woman is actually the owner of that store.

They have several romantic rondevous when finally he tells her that he doesn't love her because he likes his girlfriend and wants to return to her. She admires his honesty and pays him $200 for being with her and in return, she also tells all her friends about him. All the women are married and misserable for somereason or another, mostly because they feel neglected and unloved.

Dempsey romances all these women in different ways, not necesarry sexually, but through dancing, massages, and just by paying attention.

Eventually, as in Duece Bigalow, everything takes a turn for the worst. His mom gets hold of the secret message and places an order to meet the delivery boy (her own son which she doesn't know about). His father thinks he's gay because he's hanging out with Tony, the good looking Italian who works at Senor Pizza.

I'm not going to give away the end of the film because it's honestly worth watching. I love Patrick Dempsey as an actor, and this film was awesome. I cannot believe that after a film like this, his film career didn't blow up (until Grey's Anatomy). Kristey Alley also comes out in this film, as well as Elizabeth Daily (Pee Wee's Big Adventure).",1270944000,,2246,4.530864197530864

The story line is simple but innovative. A pizza delivery boy is caught into the arms of a foxy lady who spreads his name among her friends. At first, they pay him money for sex as they think this will remove their loneliness. Then, he discovers that most of them don't need sex, they need companionship. Then, his business flourishes until the men of these women discovers these relationships along with his parents !!!

338165,3,6301465628,"Micklin Silver is a nice director.  I've seen some of her work from the 1970's; Hester Street is a real gem, the story of Jewish Immigrants at the turn of the 19th Century made with no studio money; it was remarkable.  Recently I saw her PBS, adaptation of Scott Fitzgerald's short story classic, Bernice Bobs Her Hair -- again lovely work.  Now in Loverboy she gets some Hollywood dough and makes the most of a low budget, an almost Marx brother's touch that in the wrong hands could be a very cheesy sex comedy.

For those of us that have delivered pizza to stranger's homes: yeah, it could happen.  ""Ladies, a man is at your door.""  So that's the premise as our college boy has lost his girl and his tuition, so pizza delivery is his only alternative.  The ladies soon shower our novice with money for love.  He picks up some pointers.  In fact, he enjoys the company of various TV personalities, sitcom ladies, and Carrie Fisher.  Naturally the husbands find out and they're after our emerging Fred Astaire with the suave moves.  Will he get his girlfriend back and save his parents marriage?  It's worth a few laughs to find out.  Also, check out the late 80's fashions.",1148342400,,1175,4.538095238095238
338226,4,6301465628,"When I first saw Loverboy, I had no clue what to expect.  What I got was a comedy with one of the most amusing plots I have seen in awhile.  Loverboy tells the tale of Randy Bodek, who after failing all his classes, must earn his college tuition over the summer by working at Senor Pizza as a delivery boy.  If he doesn't, not only will he not go back to college, he'll loose his girlfriend, too.  Well, soon Randy finds another way to earn some quick money, which only leaves him in more trouble.

Buy the DVD now! The price tag isn't as high as when the other reviewers wrote their reviews.  The price just dropped from about $25 to under $15!!!",1145059200,,647,4.219512195121951
338227,2,6301465628,"Patrick Dempsey had an usual niche in the 80s teen comedy, as did the characters he played.  He was the lovable loser who just wanted to fit in, somehow ends up getting caught up in some smutty encounter or another on his quest for acceptance, but is well liked and tended to have everything mostly work out for him in the end.  Here was no acception.

He plays the lovable loser once again, this time he was an arrogant, cocky kid who blew his education by doing nothing but partying at college.  Disappointed and angry at his failing grades, his parents decide to stop supporting him and he is forced into the minimum wage workforce at a pizza place.  While Patrick is thoughly miserable working for slave labor, he encounters a beautiful, mysterious stranger who (like the plot to a bad porn movie) makes his job worth while with no strings attached.  While this fleeting encounter might have ended there, the mysterious stranger talked with her women friends about this, and soon Patrick is working as a gigalo under the guise of a pizza delivery guy.  The smutty adventures and hilarity ensue after that.  Long before Desperate Housewives he was their Afternoon Delight.

What was amazing to me in watching this movie is that Patrick didn't have sex with all the women clients he eventually aquires.  He is simply a friend, a companion, someone to talk with.  I guess I just don't understand why some of the women he was servicing didn't try talking with their husbands about what was bothering them rather than letting this situation come to a head.  Of course, as infidelity is an ugly thing no matter how many screwball slapstick antics you apply to it like this movie did, it all comes crashing down on him when his mother rings up for some loving.  That's an urban ledgend if there ever was one.

I gave this only 2 stars because the happily ever after ending was too hoaky for words.  Still, it is a commentary on the world being full of lonely people.",1127779200,4,1963,4.600574712643678

I saw this when it was first released and will purchase it on DVD when the price comes WAY DOWN to the ""realm of reason"".  Until then, rent it!  Its a great movie, but not even worth close to the asking price.",1116288000,3,371,4.397058823529412

Unfortunately, I cannot bring myself to pay this price for a DVD with absolutely no extras.  What were they thinking?!?!?  For now I'll just rent this movie and wait for the day that the price drops.  Too bad....I was looking forward to buying it.",1083628800,12,414,4.54054054054054

since when did everything get so serious? this movie doesn't pretend to solve any social problems, it simply makes you laugh.
THAT is what i liked about this flick and what i love about it and other movies of it's genre. don't see it if you take yourself to freakin seriously, but if you want a good time, it's well worth a look!",1083369600,28,446,4.518518518518518

While it was fun to watch, it's not nearly as good as I remembered. Much of the comedy falls flat, as does a good amount of the acting, script, etc. While I'd still like to see this released on DVD, just to complete my collection of 80's teen comedies, there's a long list of stuff I'd like to see first.",1062201600,,425,4.195121951219512
338233,4,6301465628,"This movie reminds me a bit of another Patrick Dempsey movie, ""Can't Buy Me Love"", because this movie too is also a fable.  While ""Can't Buy Me Love"" had multiple morals, there are fewer morals in this movie because of the complexity of the principal moral.
The main moral of this movie is that you need to take care of your significant other because if you do not, they will.  While some people will say that you need to remain faithful under all circumstances, what we see in this movie are a group of women who are neglected by their husbands that then seek paid companionship with Patrick Dempsey.  Now I need to explain the movie a bit.
Patrick Dempsey has been goofing off in school bit time, and his father decides it is time to cut him off financially.  Patrick needs a substantial amount of money for tuition in the fall.  By chance Patrick runs into a woman that gives him money for having sex with him.  The next thing Patrick knows, this woman has told all her friends about Patrick, and he becomes a gigolo.
Before you wrinkle your nose in disgust, Patrick does not have sex with all these women.  He listens to some, dances with others, and generally becomes their friend.
Patrick's business does exceedingly well, and he quickly sees how he'll have tuition by fall.  However, things begin unraveling about Patrick.  Patrick has a beautiful girlfriend who finds out about Patrick's business, several husbands find out about Patrick, Patrick's father thinks he is gay, and a guy that Patrick works with develops a major crush on Patrick's mother.  Everything comes to a head at the end of the movie in a rather satisfactory way.
While the description of the movie might make some cringe, in fact this is a funny movie.  Near the end it becomes hilarious.  Patrick gets in deeper and deeper, and eventually he finds that the only way to get out of trouble is to come clean with everybody.  Ultimately Patrick realizes that what he did was wrong.  Even though Patrick does not blame his behavior on the husbands, their behavior set up the need their wives had.  Furthermore, in the conclusion of the movie each husband ended up in a different situation depending on how much their wives wanted to deal with their husband's issues.
This movie is highly entertaining; definitely a light comedy.  For me ""Can't Buy Me Love"" and ""Loverboy"" are the two best movies Patrick Dempsey made in his early years as an actor.  Four stars for being funny, entertaining, and have at least one good moral, as well as an all-star cast that included Kirstie Alley, Carrie Fisher, Robert Picardo, Robert Ginty, Kate Jackson, Vic Tayback and Barbara Carrera.",1045094400,10,2649,4.699134199134199
338234,5,6301465628,"This is a great movie.  Patrick Dempsey plays the part perfectly with great physical comedy.  The fact that he is not your typical leading man is part of the fun in this movie.  The story is original, the supporting cast including Robert Ginty as the father and Bernie Coulson as the best friend is terrific, the movie simply is fun and entertaining.  This is Dempsey's best role along with Run and Can't Buy Me Love. I have to watch it whenever its on!",1024963200,,453,4.421686746987952

What his he to do? While delivering pizzas he has a chance encounter with a beautiful mysterious woman Alex (Barbra Carrea). She is the kind that kisses and tells. So how will this encounter change Randy's life and those around him?

This here movie is fun from the get go. You do not realize what it is leading to until it is too late. Then before you can catch your breath, it starts snowballing. Everyone does a good job of acting. You know that they are having fun making this movie. There is danger, economics, implied sex, and plenty of ""Extra Anchovies""

See both Kirstie Alley and Carrie Fisher again in ""Sibling Rivalry"" (1990).",1504569600,,814,4.568493150684931
