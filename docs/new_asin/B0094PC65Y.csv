8536027,5,B0094PC65Y,"These are highly informative dvds detailing the what and why of chem-trails and how they affect our well-being. It should concern all of us that the levels of toxic substances used in these arial sprayings sometimes reach over 20,000 times the EPA's maximum safe level of exposure. Specifically, though not limited to, aluminum oxide, which can be linked to Alzheimers Disease, ADD and numerous other problems in the human body as well as changing the PH of our environment with devastating consequences. Knowledge of what is happening to our environment is crucial to eliminating the threat that these chemicals pose and exposing the real reasons for their use. Be informed or be a victim.",1379808000,3,690,5.06140350877193
8536028,5,B0094PC65Y,"I was very, very pleased by each of these films.

For literally years and years I have personally observed these spray trails being laid across Colorado's formerly pristine skies. For literally years and years I have personally observed sheep of all political persuasions bleat ""conspiracy theory, conspiracy theory"" when I suggest that they merely look up. Only a cynic can enjoy that, I guess.

Discovery can be a very difficult exercise for the observationally challenged. People do not like the exercise that confrontation brings.

Each of these very well researched and equally well cataloged DVDs 1) taught me more by their logical sequencing of known events and 2) expanded on the depths to which we as a civilization have plunged. Those who surrender their thought processes to the general media and/or school systems will not and need not view either of these. But for those who shrug off the chicken-poop labels regularly dumped on thinkers, well, these DVDs are something you will want to watch again and again.

Each of these have very clear releases at the end of their presentations, releases that encourage viewers to duplicate and distribute copies free of charge. It's in writing at the end of and during each. I urge you to buy copies only to support the producers and to encourage them in their efforts but make copies also. Hand them out at Farmer's Markets, festivals, wherever.

At my age I really don't care because the effects will not be long-term for me. But if you are in your childbearing years, or even approaching them, this information is for and about you and your life.

As for me, I continue to be encouraged by proofs and analyses that justify my sublime disdain for the so-called ""intelligence"" of our self-flagellating species.

Cheers!

8536029,2,B0094PC65Y,"""What in the world are they spraying"" and ""Why in the world are they spraying"" are two popular DVDs with a conspiracist message. The director, Michael Murphy, is a Christian fundamentalist. Another person heavily involved in this project is conspiracist doyen G Edward Griffin of the far right John Birch Society. However, the people interviewed seem to be from all over the political spectrum, including organic farmers, Hispanic activists and others.

The DVDs claim that the U.S. government and NATO are secretly spraying most of the world with toxic chemicals for unknown reasons. The ""evidence"" is the existence of so-called Chemtrails in the sky. The second documentary in particular lands in a subtle form of climate change denial, admitting that climate change is real, but created by the Chemtrails! Apparently, the U.S. federal government wants to control the weather for military-strategic purposes, and it's their secret geo-engineering of the Earth's atmosphere that causes climate change, rather than fossil fuels. Somehow, it feels that this neat scenario makes it possible for conspiracy theorists to both eat their cake and have it, too! Which, I suppose, is the point.

Under this scenario, we can continue to use fossil fuels like before, and blame all problems caused by them on imaginary, super-secretive geo-engineers working for the Illuminati. Or something to that effect.

I have already reviewed these DVDs separately at their respective product pages, and will say little more about it here. Recommended, but only because these films give the viewer a good introduction to a currently popular form of conspiracy theory.",1368489600,,1646,5.347490347490347
