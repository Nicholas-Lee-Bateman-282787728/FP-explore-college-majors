7871988,4,6304463308,"This movie hits all the high points.  Youve got good, evil, the hero the damsell.  The hot vampire mistress, and the always popular usless lackeies.

Now as it has been stated yes there is no full nudity in the movie even if it does take place in and around a strip club.  But since most people do not enter such establishments most don't know that many cities ban full nudity in places that serve alcohol. In this the movie is closer to real life.

But other then that the movie is top notch, the acting is believable the story line flows smoothly. and as an added bonus the music in the movie are written and performed by local Cincinati bands.",1302739200,,646,4.35
7871989,2,6304463308,"As a huge fan of Lorissa McComas, I was highly disappointed that her appearance was fully clothed. This is a softcore adult movie spoof. Yes the other girls get topless but Lorissa does not. The nudity is nothing to write home about so if your into this for a quick thrill, there are much better options out there.",1234396800,,314,4.431034482758621
7871990,5,6304463308,"""Vamps : Deadly Dreamgirls"" is no longer available by itself. But never fear, the story continues in ""Vamps 2 : Blood Sisters"" which includes as a bonus the original Vamps 1 that started it all. So if you have been dying to find out if a relationship between a fallen priest and a vampire stripper can work out, you can find out in Vamps 2.",1090281600,3,340,4.246153846153846
7871991,5,6304463308,"What's the use in pretending?  I love Vamps: Deadly Dreamgirls.  I mean, come on -Vamps is the name of a strip joint where the girls (including the likes of Amber Newman and Jennifer Huss) are vampires who will never age a single day, and the place is run by a red-headed mistress of the dark.  It's a fantasy come true.  As if this isn't enough all by itself (and it is), you've actually got a pretty good plot thrown in for no extra charge.  The writers even tossed in some great little catchphrases here and there.  ""Without gore, it's a bore"" is a good one, but an even better one, delivered just prior to a vampire feeding, is ""this guy is lewd, crude, and about to be food.""  Granted, the movie doesn't have the largest of budgets, but the filmmakers do a lot with what they have, making sure we get the blood we expect from several arterial fangs-plorational procedures.  The music isn't that great, but the featured tracks are used effectively.  Alas, you won't find any complete nudity in the film, but you can't have everything in this world.
Okay, the whole priest character is a little weird, I'll give you that.  Paul Morris plays Father Seamus O'something or other, a young priest who has an obsession with horror films and a best friend who drags him to a strip joint for his birthday.  Tasha (Jenny Wallace) isn't that wild about having a priest in her establishment, especially with her being a vampire and all, but it doesn't seem like much of a problem at first.  Besides, she has the debut of a new performer to gloat over, as the all-American girl Heather (Jennifer Huss) takes the stage for the first time (in a cheerleading outfit, I might add).  It just so happens that Heather, on the run from a loser boyfriend, just happens to be a former high school classmate of our young priest, and the two soon strike up a relationship that certainly seems to threaten the whole celibate thing that Seamus has going on.  Tasha thinks Heather will make a great vampire stripper (a judgment I myself would certainly endorse), so obviously you're going to have a big priest-vampire showdown at the end.  Vamps: Deadly Dreamgirls also features the lovely Amber Newman as Randi, a vampire with an attitude and, when she is onstage, a whip.
So many movies of this type are ruined with an ultimate victory of good over evil, but the ending of this particular film actually works pretty well, falling somewhere between traditional good and evil.  If you like your vampires young, female, attractive, scantily-clad, and filled with a lust for blood, Vamps: Deadly Dreamgirls was made just for you.",1076198400,3,2603,4.650655021834061
7871992,3,6304463308,This is cool! Amber Newman is cute and there's enough nudity to please. Vampire Strippers! Great idea!,1069372800,,102,5.0588235294117645
7871993,1,6304463308,"""Stay far, far away from this production company."" is the advice of my brother after watching this movie and I could not agree more. Some okay looking babes with lots of skin shown, but besides that a complete waste of time. No gore and little blood and nothing resembling frights. Only get this if you want a low budget movie shot on video with some strip club dancing in it.",1024444800,2,376,4.385714285714286
