8453544,5,B00525QFCA,"When I started watching this movie just on the title , I didn't realize that this really happened! I bought the new one and the original and found them both to be comical and drowning in the North Sea of British dry humor!! And the British did get a bunch of 30-06 Enfields thru lend lease and tons of ammo that couldn't be used in the .303 Enfields! the .30 rifles had a band around the stock to ID. A great movie proving everyone should drink more!!",1528416000,,451,4.195402298850575
