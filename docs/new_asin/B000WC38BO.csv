2964285,5,B000WC38BO,"For someone that has tried just about every home workout genre out there.  This DVD finally offers something that is refreshingly new to my living room!  This workout is ideal for those who have danced for years and people that have never even tried on a pair of ballet slippers.  The DVD is simple to pick up, and challanging to get through.  The filming is elegant and the instruction is far from the cheesy power workout ""motivation"" that irritate me so much.  After you've completed this workout, you feel like you've, not only toned up, but also learned a few things!  For someone that has grown tired of the home workout video, this couldn't have come at a better time!",1196812800,304,675,4.583333333333333

2964313,5,B000WC38BO,"This dvd is amazing. I love her voice, it soothes me into compliance with her tough yet gentle routine. My body is becoming lean, lithe and plastic/elastic. This is exactly what I was trying to achieve. The surroundings are lovely in regards to the background scenery. It gives me a sense of fulfillment and peace(I know I sound cuckoo saying this about a ballet video but....it's true) Thank you Elise!",1491696000,2,403,4.771428571428571

2964316,5,B000WC38BO,"I can't believe I've had this dvd for almost 7 years, and never used it. I probably did when I first bought it, but for some reason it has been sitting on a bookshelf since 2010. Fitness background: I used to run and do weights regularly, but for the past 1-2 years I've gotten really lazy and all my muscle tone is gone; I'm totally out of shape. I want to ease back into working out so I put this dvd in last night. My legs were shaking afterwards and I'm sore almost all over today. I definitely feel it most in my legs, hips, and butt - but also my back and shoulders. I was surprised that my standing leg got really fatigued while my other leg was doing the moves. It sounds impossible after just one work-out, but I swear I feel tighter and my posture is better. I'm totally motivated to use this at least 3 times a week. The only negative thing I can say about it is that I felt totally ungraceful and uncoordinated while I was doing it.",1487030400,4,944,4.135869565217392

2964333,4,B000WC38BO,"Very good workout utilizing ballet. The instructor has great figure, and she is an example of what a regular practice can do. The exercises are harder than they look. I would characterize it as a moderate level that can be used by beginners, too.

She doesn't do arm exercises as ballet dancers develop their arm muscles due to holding their arms out. however, professional dancers do hours of exercises with arms out each day, so I think you need to add a some upper body exercises.",1476576000,,483,4.616279069767442

I am able to turn my back on the video and still understand. The routine is very rigorous. I live in an apartment, so I don't do any of her jumps, but the workout is a killer everytime. I enjoy the pilates core workout in the middle.",1466640000,18,371,4.027027027027027

2964381,4,B000WC38BO,"The exercise DVD is challenging although I expected more stretching.  The music is very boring so I plan to mute it and use my own once I have the routine down.  Between the instrumental music and her tone, it sounds like soft core *** until the pace picks up.  I'm sure it was to represent ballet grace but they missed the mark on that.",1453420800,2,337,4.234375
2964382,5,B000WC38BO,"Great workout tape. Don't let the graceful poses and Elise's sweet demeanor fool you -- this workout doesn't use include weights or intensive cardio, but it is quite challenging! Stick with it though, and it becomes easier. I found the the instruction easy to follow, even for beginners. It is a good option for people who want to stay fit and build strength but can't tolerate high impact cardio. Additionally, you perform the exercises based on your fitness and flexibility (for example, the height of your leg lifts), so you don't need to worry about the workout quickly becoming too easy - you can increase the challenge of the exercises as you grow fit.",1452297600,7,658,4.780701754385965

A few moves my legs are really shaking & I love that! I danced when I was younger, but you don't need dancing skills to do this video. It's what dancers do to warm up prior to dancing.",1452038400,6,321,4.03125

2964415,5,B000WC38BO,"Love this DVD!  Elise Gulan is one of my favorite instructors she is upbeat without being annoying her cuing is very good and she is very motivational.  This isn't your standard workout video and that's why it works.  It will give you a great workout.  It starts off killing your lower body.  You will progress through a series of plies.  Your legs will burn after this but if you want to work on toning up your legs this is great for it!  I was very sore the next day.  There are some jumps to get in your cardio and get your heart pumping if the intense leg work didn't already.  You keep your arms up and engaged and to help with balance when you need you use a chair since there aren't many of us with a ballet barre at home.

This is great if you are looking for a workout that is not a traditional workout!",1446422400,7,812,4.114649681528663

My daughter does not wear out like I do on it BUT she has classes that have been working her legs out more than the average person.  I felt like I had a whole body work out because it requires proper posture and balance to do the exercises.  It is very relaxing yet focused - a real mind/body work out. :),1438905600,6,446,3.922222222222222

Very much the equivalent of a first-class work-out at the barre, a more than adequate warm-up for beginners and intermediate students as well as professional ballet basics for advanced students.  BEST OF ALL, it is nothing that can't be done from Day One at home with this dvd and a chair.  Do portions until you are up-to-speed, or do the full hour for a full-bore ballet work-out.

Of course, most who purchase just want the exercise and conditioning.  Here you have it in an hour that has to work if applied ... instructions are clear, tone is gentle and encouraging.  This dvd would be worth the money for posture conditioning alone, but give it a week of two or three sensible sessions, and the results will be felt and noticeable, but not painful.  Give it three months with proper diet, increasing to the full workout, and the results will be all-over noticeable to all.",1431043200,5,890,4.666666666666667

I was a former ballet student, and this DVD was just what I was looking for.  I purchased the FLUIDITY BARRE with workout DVD's, and found them tedious, and boring, and not related to ballet at all.  A big disappointment.  Elise's workout is graceful and smooth.  She is beautiful and soft spoken, and does not add that patronizing ""GOOD"" comment after each exercise, as if she can see what you're doing.

This is a ballet-BASED workout, not ballet. If you're looking for a general workout, this may be a good fit for you. If you're looking for ballet class conditioning, this is not it.

I thought a previous reviewer was very harsh until I got 10 minutes into the video and realized that reviewe was absolutely correct. I kept hearing my college ballet instructor in my head correcting how she was doing things. I'm a complete novice, but I knew that the instructor in the video did not have balletic form. She is a former ballerina soloist and she may use a different form when practicing ballet, but the form she is using in the video is not good ballet form.

The more I got into the workout, I could feel that the routine was focusing on the large muscle groups in my legs.

That's not bad for a workout, but this is not true ballet conditioning.

If you're looking for a true ballet class, check out Victor Kabaniaev's ""Ballet Class"". It has a trailer you can preview, and you can rent the video on Amazon Prime to see if it's what you're looking for. I've been following that video for 3 days and am excited to continue.",1421193600,7,1359,4.42

2964562,5,B000WC38BO,"I danced 4 days a week when I was a young teen, but have not taken classes in almost 10 years. There aren't any good adult classes near me and I wanted a ballet style work out, so when I ran across this I thought it would be worth a try. I had also taken Barre Amped live group classes thinking they would be a dance based workout, however I found the instructor criticizing my technique the whole time saying I was ""doing it too much like dance"" so I got frustrated and didn't continue going. This DVD was exactly what I wanted, actual dance moves and dance terminology with a workout!  It's much harder than anticipated, without being impossible, but I certainly realized I am not in the same shape I was as a teen. I only made it through 38 minutes of the workout today but when I looked in the mirror I could already see sculpting in my abs! 51 minutes is a little longer than I wanted but after seeing results in just 3/4 of a workout, I am SO excited to continue and it is definitely worth getting up a little earlier every day.",1420588800,2,1034,4.1959798994974875

2964604,1,B000WC38BO,"Let me preface this review by saying that my intention is not to disparage Ms. Gulan. However, some of what I may say could possibly be construed as personal. Since Ms. Gulan herself is presenting this workout and has provided her resume and personal abilities as an endorsement, I feel that she should be held personally accountable for any misinformation or inaccuracy.

I had this DVD on my wish list along with a couple others because I was looking for workouts that would either enhance my dance training or at the very least, not INTERFERE with my training. I am a performing artist and yoga instructor who has studied dance for the past eight years in a cross-discipline capacity, all while in close consultation with a physical therapist. There is no 'workout' out there that can give you a dancer's body unless it is the actual dance practice itself. Dancing is training specific, and the barre exercises that ballet dancers do for hours and years, along with a careful (and admittedly for some, sometimes unhealthy) diet helps to keep body fat percentage low. Although 'core' is strengthened, you'll see 'six-packs' only through specific targeting outside of dance class in most cases, and in other cases because the dancer is young or genetically pre-disposed to that kind of muscle definition. Essentially, what happens at a basic physiological level is that a ballet dancer learns by doing to train the body to eschew the natural stabilizers, and highly develop many of the lesser-used smaller muscles of the body for what they do. This enables them to create a sense of effortless and light movement. Anyway, enough tech talk...

Unfortunately, Ms. Gulan is NOT a good example of this. Her thighs and buttocks are very over-developed, which is an indicator that she is using her large muscle groups to lift her leg or plie--exactly the OPPOSITE of what a dancer should do. My daughter, a pre-professional dancer herself, watched the video with me and was appalled that Ms. Gulan was performing the exercises with such poor, incorrect technique. She was sickling her ankles every time she went into releve, and couldn't hold it. Her turnout was very poor, and would disappear for many of the exercises. Her hands were one of the WORST parts, as she had them contorted into claws that made us both cringe. Her arms dropped at the elbow, and none of her leg extensions had or could maintain much height. Why is all of this a problem? Because her body is 'cheating'. In other words, she is using whatever muscles she can to mimic the motions of a dancer, rather than using the muscles a dancer would use. She is apparently so out of dancer condition that she is unable to correctly execute the most basic of dancer exercises. Her flexibility was also very poor.

Will you lose weight doing her video? Probably. You'll be using large muscle groups, mainly the glutes and the larger top part of the quads, so therefore will naturally burn more calories, especially since most of the exercises center around squats (or what she called plies).

Will you get the 'slender body' of a dancer, 'strong and lean with lovely proportion and gorgeous body lines,' as promised on the back of the video? No. You can't. Even if you are a dancer, and already have trained your body to use the correct muscles, the heavy focus on exercises that naturally use the larger muscle groups will work against what you are trying to achieve. Plus, if you ARE a trained ballet dancer, you'll go nuts watching her--alternately laughing, then crying at the horrible technique you are watching from someone who claims she was a soloist for a company.

The location is lovely, the music is cheesy and synthesizer-style with a '90's vibe. Ms. Gulan has a decent voice as she narrates, but it tends toward the syrupy sweet, and her 'encouragement' is oddly delivered. She also has a very tense and often pained smile plastered to her face, which you may find pleasant, but we found obnoxious by the end. There is very little stretching/flexibility aspect--just a few quick stretches at the end, but nothing like what a dancer would do, or does do on a daily basis.

And that is why I give it one star--neither Ms. Gulan, nor the workout she has put together, live up to what she claims in the description. I'm sure she's a lovely person, and I'm sure she has clientele who love her. I shudder to think that she's teaching dance, but perhaps when she's in the dance studio, she is able to teach correct technique to her students. I'm not hopeful, though. In the case of this video, she shows a complete lack of understanding of the basics of dance physiology, technique, and despite what she claims, following her lead will not give you the body of a dancer.",1419811200,35,4735,4.74726609963548

It is such a peaceful time that I hesitate to call it a Work-Out, but I Do sweat--A lot(!) and my body is transforming: my legs are slimming as my muscles become toned. The inner thighs are pulling inward, creating that missed 'space' between the legs when standing 'at attention' (love it!). My derriere has been lifted, hips are smoothing out; feels wonderful to put on a pair of jeans and like what I see

This routine includes some jumps, but do what you can and with each Practice Session they become easier and you will be able to complete the section with no effort at all. My knees tend to have tension in them, but once I get to this part my body is so warmed up by all the knee bends, including Deep knee bends prior to the jumping, that this section is No Problem; doing all the  movements in this dvd actually make my knees feel good, strong. As with the jumping, the knee bends were done little by little as my body became stronger

She ends with a section of stomach work - again, don't give up because it's tough, keep at it, day by day, session by session, doing a little more than you did the previous session and you'll be doing the entire section and feeling Great at both the accomplishment of completing the section and knowing that you're on your way to transformation in looks and health

I run through this dvd any time I can, striving for everyday, but am happy with every other day; it's about staying in motion; the dvd runs 50mins

2964694,5,B000WC38BO,"After getting hooked on barre workouts,  and reading all of the great reviews, I decided to give this dvd a try.

I was a bit nervous though as I have zero ballet and zero dance experience.

The workout itself was challenging, but not overly so. On a scale of 1-10 I would probably put it at a 6 in intensity. I found myself breaking a sweat, but I survived. I thought the hardest part involved some of the core exercises at the end and I found myself having to pause and take breaks.

And yes, as previous viewers have noted, the woman doing the voice over does sound overly sensual. I just turn the volume down low though so my husband doesn't think I am watching adult movies in the next room. Other than that I have no complaints about this video.

My favorite part about this workout though is how I feel afterwards. Even though I am not a tenth as graceful as the woman in the video, I feel graceful and more fluid in my movements afterward. And even though I have been practicing yoga for some time, I felt like this has helped my balance beyond what I have gotten out of yoga. While yoga gives me a stationary sense of balance, this helps me to balance better while moving- essentially making me much less if a klutz in day to day life.

As background: I am 26, and have always been relatively active, though it's only in the last couple years that I've really been consciously working out. Two years ago, I got into yoga. My friends and I still have not advanced beyond beginner status -- we do it mostly to relax and so we can say we moved at least a little that day despite having mostly office style jobs. Last spring, we did P90X. And, yes, we finished. It was never easy, so I would like to say that makes me a normal individual -- determined, but normal. Since then, my workout has been less strenuous -- mostly, I do bellydancing videos with a little easy yoga mixed in. In college, I took two semesters of ballet, but other than that, I have no formal dance training.
So, I'm in decent shape, but I'm not a professional anything when it comes to fitness.
Four months ago, I got this video and have used it probably six times since. I am telling you, it kicks my butt every time. But in a good way. This is one of those workouts that leaves you worn out but feeling accomplished. On the scale of workouts I've done in my life, it'd fit in with P90X. In fact, I'd say this video is what would happen if Tony Horton had a nice calming voice and ran a beginning ballet class.
This video covers about 90% of the things I learned in my beginning ballet classes in college. It's pretty much an entire semester crammed into 50 minutes. Because she doesn't explain how something is done, it may be easier for someone with ballet experience to effectively grasp, but I have no doubt that a complete ballet beginner could do it. It just might take a little rewinding or multiple views before it really clicked.

And, I am 61 years old, 5'5"", usually somewhere between 125-127 lbs.  I conscientiously exercise, but moderately. A brisk one hour walk or 40 minutes walk aerobics, 5 days a week, with some lifting with 3 lb weights a couple times a week. And about 15 minutes of stretching every other day.

And, I have a lower back herniated disk problem.  Which is not at all aggravated by these exercises.  In principle I'd not expect it to be, but I'm always a little wary.

I wanted to try this because I was getting really frustrated with a growing lack of flexibility as I got older.  I hated the stiffness and pain in my hips and feeling like I was never going to bounce up from a chair again! The yoga was helping but not enough.

This really is the solution. I can't believe how ""bouncy"" I feel, getting up and moving around, from any position.  I suspect that strengthening is helping there too.

I assumed it would take some repetition to improve in my execution and that is definitely happening.  I feel a real sense of accomplishment in doing these. I feel as if I am educating my body, not just exercising it.

As someone who did ballet in primary school, I was already familiar with some of the basic positions, and glad that the video provided such a thorough workout of the legs and core. Some of the moves were quite challenging, but I am already feeling improvements in balance, strength, and flexibility. The only critique I have was the focus on body shape. I realize that the ballet world focuses on external appearances, but it's quite possible for people of different body types to benefit from ballet even if their goal isn't to get a ""perfect"", 'long lean body'. I wish the video were a little more gender-neutral as well - I felt as though the intended audience was women, and that isn't necessary for a ballet video, since lots of men do ballet. I wish there had been more detail on how to do the forms (especially the leg lifts at the end) and not as much focus on what our bodies should look like.

I was pleasantly surprised that this was not the case with this DVD: the exercises not only followed the general format of a true ballet barre, but they were challenging as well. While I wouldn't recommend this workout to an absolute beginner, if you've had a bit of ballet before, it's perfect. It will take you through some thorough barre work, a few exercises in the center, some ab work, and then a stretch. The scenery is beautiful and the instructor is both pleasant and encouraging. I've seen other reviews in which reviewers complained about her voice or the music; I didn't find either one to be offensive.

2964993,5,B000WC38BO,"If you are rusty with ballet/dance, and/or have been doing mostly cardio (even if it involves a lot of leg action, such as running or the elliptical), please heed my advice!

You will want to pace yourself and not push yourself to do every exercise to completion. The first time I did the DVD, I did everything to the point of muscle exhaustion. The next day, I was so sore that I was incapacitated and could not move normally, even with Icy Hot and stretching.

So, don't push yourself past ""burn"" to ""can't move my leg that way anymore"". It could result in more than straining your muscles- even good athletes get injured that way (Achilles tendon injuries, anyone?).

I find that modifying some positions to the easier version, or switching legs, helps avoid fatigue so I can get further along in the DVD. Also, you can just go slower and do the movements correctly, rather than try to keep up with her. If you switch legs, you can just make sure to remember to switch back again later so you do both sides as equally as possible.

Someone mentioned she does not do each side equally. This may be due to the fact that it is easy to miss the verbal cues to switch sides. The way the footage is shot you could miss that she switched sides. Sometimes, the exercises involved automatically use both sides, such as plies, but just involve holding one arm up on one side longer. Maybe that's what the person meant...anyway, if it's arms, by the time you are done with the legs section you will probably have held each side up.

In short, advice: use a rug or yoga mat. You don't need shoes. Have a chair and plenty of water nearby. And don't push yourself to do everything to completion. It is harder than it looks.",1389657600,8,1712,4.439490445859873

I did like that it didn't require any equipment - just the use of a chair. I know other reviewers mentioned they liked the voice over of instructions, but while it did make the moves easy to follow - I prefer someone instructing while teaching. The voice over didn't really give any explanations or go into details on any of the moves and I had to rely on trying to match my moves to the woman in the video the best that I could.

I would not buy another video with this trainer.,1383696000,2,413,4.666666666666667

When I found my body was telling me I was overtraining I started to look for options that would help level things out. I thought, ""Oh! Ballet! It is slower paced and focused on toning rather than building. I think that is the ticket!"" I was very surprised when I got it and tried it and found that it was harder than a lot of my other workouts. I was sore for a week...which hasn't happened in fifteen years of working out. But even though it was not what I was expecting, it was wonderful. I love the results and how calm I feel getting those results.

All those beautiful moves I've watched other people do all my life have now been patiently explained and demonstrated for me, and I was doing them in no time.  This is why I only gave it 4 stars - I'm not sure I'm going to see the results I've gotten with other DVDs, I only worked up a sweat with the ab work.  But I will enjoy doing this lovely 50 minute workout a least once a week.  The scenery indeed is serene and beautiful, an inspired idea to take a class out of the studio!  Her voice is soft and encouraging, letting you know if you can't do what she's doing, no worries, that's the beauty of you.  And ending with a curtsey to ""honor"" my workout - well, I would not have been surprised if a bouquet of roses came out of the tv to land at my feet!

Certain areas of the video are tough, but its the intention to perform the movements, as stated by the instructor, that is important.

This is a fantastic work out with beautiful scenery. It's done in natural light so it's easy to see how each move should be done. It's a pleasant experience, which seems like a strange thing to say after saying it's a tough exercise routine, but the tone of voice, her beautiful form, the lighting and scenery make it a pleasure to watch....you get lost in the music and beauty and forget how much your legs are hurting....get this DVD, you'll love it!",1380758400,,623,4.473684210526316

I took ballet as a child to young woman (long time ago), so I understood the language, but if you don't have the experience, don't worry. You won't have any trouble following along.

This DVD is a lot of slow movement muscle building and doesn't require the need to buy expensive shoes. All you need is a chair and the room to move it to your right or to your left as the workout progresses. If you have bad knees or hips, you may want to skip this.",1380240000,2,633,4.188524590163935

It looks easy at first but after 5 minutes my legs and bootie are on fire! I used to take some dance classes as a girl so some of the positions are familiar. This workout is so invigorating that I find myself wishing I could do it everyday. With practice, I am gradually able to do more repititions of plies. IYou will see results pretty quick - my thighs and calves are toned after just a few weeks.

Throughout my childhood I trained in ballet over a 10 year period and was in fantastic shape. 12 years later and having recently given birth to twin babies, I've definitely got some work to do to get fully back into shape. This is so ideal! You can take it on your own gradient - your flexibility, strength etc do not matter because the style of workout works your body at your level. You push yourself to do all that you can do and you feel your body change into as Elise says, lengthened, leaner and stronger.
What an ideal workout - that anyone can do!
Thank you Elise!

Then it moves on to jumps and glorified jumping jacks, which I'd have to stop and put my shoes back on for, since the first half of the video is meant to be done barefoot.",1377734400,4,328,4.061538461538461
2965103,5,B000WC38BO,"I've been using this conditioning DVD almost every day for three weeks now, and I have to say I've grown to love it.  On days when I vary things up with other types of exercise, usually youtube programs, I find myself needing to do some of this as well to end my exercise for the day, because it feels like coming home. Elise has a very soothing presence and the music is very calm and puts you in a good frame of mind. It's a tough work out (you do sweat) and since I haven't done any ballet for over 50 years!! while the body remembers the positions, the muscles take a while to catch up. I notice that my legs are firmer, my waistline is streamlined, my cellulite seems diminished, my posture feels improved, and I even walk down the street much more confidently. Elise's program really does make you feel like a dancer. I bought the Vita Vibe BD48 Prodigy Series Portable Double Freestanding Ballet Barre, Stretch/Dance Bar, 4-Feet to use with this routine, and I prefer using that to using a chair. Because of my age (60+), I avoid the brief segment of the jumping steps.  I guess I'm just a little nervous about my knees. But the opening stretch sequence, the lower body work (really intense at points ... you feel the burn), and the section focused on abdominals are fantastic, and I get a good 35-40 minute workout depending on where I stop. The first few times I did the program, I would stop at around 15-20 minutes. Gradually, I could do more. I would say it's intense but easy on the body. I recommend it confidently to people my age and certainly to anyone younger.",1377561600,12,1578,4.419243986254296

2965138,5,B000WC38BO,"I enjoy this video.  It clearly covers from in a slow repetition of each exercise then does a sped up version.  The fast version is never very fast so it is not a cardio-type workout.  I don't really break a sweat with this one.  But after holding each arm up for 20 plus minutes (with brief breaks) they feel like they'll fall off.  All the exercises are do-able but boy do they burn.  By the end my legs are shaking and arms burning.
I think this instructor knows what she's doing.  My only complaint is that it doesn't have that heart-rate raising type of workout that you might get from aerobics, so I'd alternate this workout with something else (cardio, and more weight-lifting upper body) for a more balanced feel of fitness.",1375833600,,732,4.5
2965139,3,B000WC38BO,"I work out a lot - mostly with DVDs because I don't have time to waste waiting for equipment at the gym.  So I'm kind of an armchair quarterback when it comes to workout DVDs.

This one wasn't bad.  I expected it to be mildly challenging and there were actually some parts of it that impressed me with how challenging they were.  Other parts were just silly easy.  And there isn't really a way to do a ""hard"" workout vs. an ""easy"" workout on this DVD.

There is also very little cardio / very light cardio so don't expect much of that.

Overall, if you did ballet as a kid and you loved and miss it then this is a nice throwback and a half-decent workout.  If you want a challenging workout that is going to kick your butt and make you sweat, then this is not the thing for you.",1375488000,,778,4.105960264900662

It really takes your mind off the fact that you are exercising and toning/building muscles. This is one workout that I actually look forward to and get grouchy when I don't get the ""me time"" to do it! Another thing I love about the video is that you can modify your workout if you aren't able to do all of the moves exactly as described. This means you can really get a lot out of the video because you grow with it! It's the best! By the way, this is my third copy, a a few of my friends have ""borrowed"" and loved it as well.

2965141,4,B000WC38BO,"This is a good workout video. It is mostly focused on muscular work so it ends up being a bit long to my liking since you need to add at least 30 minutes of cardio to the 50 minutes of this video in order to get a full workout. I am not familiar with ballet-type workout and was a bit surprised at how hard those moves are. After 20 minutes, my legs were shaking and I was breaking a bit of a sweat. I like a lot the gracefulness involved in the moves and the fact that I learn the moves slowly before doing them quickly. There is a chance I might get tired of that once I am more familiar with the routine. I am not such a big fan of the background music either.

2965142,5,B000WC38BO,"i have been using this DVD for over 5 years.  i reach for it when i don't want to jump around.  the movements are slow and steady, deceptive. it takes time, proper breathing, and strong core to achieve the effortless grace.  i still haven't mastered the ab work out (the last part).

**About the workout:

I've owned several workout DVDs with the name ballet in the title.  IMO Ballet Conditioning feels more like taking a ballet class than the others because it is pure ballet, not pilates and not yoga.  The other ballet workout DVDs all have pilates and yoga.

Also, the workout concentrates on core and lower body strength, both vital to ballet dancers.  If you want equal attention to upper body/arms/shoulders, you won't find here.

**About the music:

i mute the dvd and use the CD ""Adagio by Herbert Von Karajan"".

Ballet + adagio classical music = peace + calm + relaxation

this dvd is the best when i need to forget about the world and just breathe and concentrate on movements.",1375228800,7,989,4.614942528735632
2965143,5,B000WC38BO,This workout is hard and relaxing at the same time. You learn balance and grace while toning your whole body. I have discovered muscle groups I didn't know I could work out. Truly great for getting a beautiful body,1374364800,3,214,4.512820512820513
2965144,3,B000WC38BO,"First, a caveat:  I used to be a real athlete but now have a debilitating health condition and so can only approach this video on my best days and that only in small portions.  But I think both my background and my present condition help me to give some useful comments.

SUGGESTIONS FOR USERS: If this is your first time using the video and you are in good shape but not great shape, I would highly recommend skipping from the stretches to the tondeaus (minute 12) and, from there, doing the rest of the video or as much of it as you are able.  This means skipping the reviles and plies.  Then if you have any strength or time left at the end, skip back to the of reviles and plies.  You will be working the calves (as in the reviles) and the quads (as in the plies) a fair amount in the second half of the video but not as intensely.  The eight minutes or so of reviles and plies at the front are so intense that you may be unable to do the more varied and longer remainder of the video by the time you have finished them or by the time you have even finished half of them (those muscles may be spent).  So if you skip them and circle back to them at the end, you can do just the right amount that your strength allows.  Also, I think that even if you CAN do the reviles and plies, you will be able to perform the other exercises on the video with more focus and ability if you are not already half-spent and wobbily-legged from the reviles and plies.  So I really recommend skipping them at first regardless of strength level so that you are less likely to hurt yourself with the other unfamiliar movements.

SUGGESTIONS FOR THE VIDEO MAKERS: This video desperately needs more chapter breaks.  I ended up going through and writing down what minute she starts tondeaus, what minute what minute she starts glutes, etc., but it is exceedingly difficult to skip around to these places without chapters.  Those with less strength will *need* to skip the most challenging portion of any given body part focus and move on to the next body part, yet it is exceedingly hard to do so.  In future iterations of this DVD, I would make each switch from left barre to right barre a different chapter.  Although my next complaint is more trivial, it is worth saying: I try to tune out what she says almost completely.  I have some yoga videos that are less profoundly and constantly cheesy than her words of encouragement are.  More than that, she blathers on incessantly about dancers' (i.e., her) enivable streamlined body, thin waist, and flat tummy.  I mean, *incessantly.*  If I had a little girl at home I would not use this video at all for fear of giving her a body image complex.  Some women will never have her shape even when they are most toned.  Even some really thin women will never have her shape b/c they naturally bulk their muscles.",1373673600,18,2839,4.379770992366412

2965208,3,B000WC38BO,"Agree with many reviews, there is no basic info for anyone who is not familiar with the whole ballet setup.  Not once did she mention that every muscle south of your ribs should be striving toward turnout, which to me is THE reason ballet is a good workout!

Yes, the music is bad, not just for itself but because having a steady beat for the slow movements adds challenge -- you should be filling every last millisecond with graceful movement.

And let's be honest, who ever had a ballet teacher who talked constantly about being happy?  Smiling through the pain, maybe.....

A great outlet, so she started ballet again & could not have been happier. All the exercises are coming back with the help of the DVDs as well. Well done!!!

I did the video with ease... of course, not as well as the instructor. I have very little dance background. She is easy to follow. I look forward to the video and the results it will produce.

2965213,5,B000WC38BO,"I recently bought this DVD and have absolutely LOVED it.
I am by NO means in shape (thus the buying of ""work out"" dvds) but the workouts were very doable without being easy.
The instruction is clear, easy to follow (even without knowing any ballet terms), and she does BOTH sides of your body so you don't have to do the other on your own later.
This DVD was challenging enough that I did not get through the entire thing without needing to stop for an occasional/momentary rest, BUT not so hard that I could not finish the entire program. I like this because it gives you something to work toward- completing it a little better each time you do it.
I also FELT that wonderful post-workout soreness in my muscles the next day, even in my arms! I love that even though you're not doing a whole lot with your arms you're still getting a great work out for them.

However, I found this video to be way too difficult. I would have been able to handle it if there had been more stretch time (especially within the lower body and abdominal sections). But it went on and on with no relief! I could nearly feel my muscles tearing. This video, in time, could potentially make one very strong, but not in a long, lean, or elegant way. I feel as though the video could be improved with more stretching and gentle exercises. They could also get rid of the entire barre section (no former ballet dancer that I know of cares to do hundreds of tendus or frappes.. unnecessary)and add an upper body section-- the area where many dancers could really use some conditioning! The music is pretty awful also and her voice is annoying.",1370131200,9,920,4.482142857142857
2965235,5,B000WC38BO,"I've been doing Russian ballet since age 5 and Pointe since age 13, and I felt the need to write a review to let perspective buyers know that this workout DVD is wonderful!  I know a lot of the negative reviews complain that the routine is too repetitive and boring, but those people have obviously never taken a ballet class before because barre repetition is what makes up 75% or more of class.  As an example, my instructor changed our class from an hour to an hour and a half because she refused to do less than an hour of barre work and didn't have any time to do floor work or practice our dance routine.  This workout DVD was almost identical to my ballet class but with less repetition of each move and slightly different arm positions.  For those people who felt the workout wasn't difficult enough, one thing to keep in mind is ballet isn't supposed to leave you dripping in sweat like an Insanity or P90X workout; it's about slow and precise movements that create thin, toned muscles.  With this DVD, you WILL feel it and see results.  Whether you are an experienced ballerina or someone who always wanted to try ballet, this workout routine is an excellent example of what ballet class entails.",1369353600,47,1206,4.534562211981567

I have hip, leg and foot pain that I was concerned about but the workouts on this dvd improved my flexibility so much my hips haven't bothered me in about a month. After some practice at 3 times a week I can do the entire workout with greatly improved form. I went from 135 lbs to 125, and my waist is now at 35"". I still have a little way to go yet, but I'm getting there and at a pace that is comfortable and perfect for me. The instructor is very supportive and positive but not in an annoying way. The music isn't terrible, though a few times it sounds a little like stereotypical porn music, and that just makes me giggle. One thing I will criticize is the volume of her instruction can be a little hard to hear over the music sometimes, but that could be my sound system too.

One word of warning, I have flat feet like you wouldn't believe so it can be a little uncomfortable if you're like me. But then again standing for more than 10 minutes hurts too so I wasn't expecting any exercise to be pain-free for me. Also, be careful during the floor routine, without proper support of your neck you will probably end up a bit sore.

Good luck everyone!",1368576000,6,1248,4.174273858921162
2965237,5,B000WC38BO,"On and off for months I have used Pop Physique, but recently I decided to fill-out my Pop Physique schedule with Kundalini Yoga and ballet conditioning. Buying this DVD was the best addition to my routine. It does exactly what I wanted. It's a challenging workout but it's not as micro hard core as Pop Physique. It is definitely ballet heavy and the moves are based on your core and thigh muscles. It's broken into 3 major sections at 51minutes. Section 1 (thigh): stretch and thighs, Section 2 (cardio): Jumps and Leg Lifts, Section 3 (core): floor abs. There is a mini-stretch in-between sections. I truly loved the workout as the movements are slightly more broad than my Pop workouts and the chair is really just a minor tool to build strength and toning. Perfect!",1367798400,5,769,4.703703703703703

Anyway, it's a great workout and the first time I did it I had to stop and catch my breath a couple of times and my legs were so sore.  Now after a few uses I only take breaks during the ab portion.

I wouldn't recommend this for people with no ballet formal training.  You won't get the benefit/might hurt yourself if you don't know how to stand correctly,plie correctly, or know basic ballet moves and positions.  However, if you have training it's a great workout and it helps me stay in shape and last longer in ballet class.",1366243200,3,640,4.213114754098361
2965241,5,B000WC38BO,"I have had this DVD for two weeks now and yes I would recommend it. You don't need to be a dancer to do the workout, it might be helpful in getting through the entire DVD, but not necessary. The length of the workout is about 51 minutes and in four chapters. There is a stretch an tone section, a leg strength and glute section, a jump and cardio section and lastly an abdominal and cool down section. I can get through the first two sections and then my legs are shaking and the sweat is just pouring off. I then skip ahead to the ab workout and that's about all I can handle. I have noticed improvement in my thighs and lower butt so far. My pants fit just a little bit better in those areas. I do the DVD every other day so about four days a week. My goal is to be able to do the DVD at least six days a week and be able to get through all of it. You don't need equipment to be purchased you need only a high backed stable chair. On the DVD the instructor does the routine barefoot I highly recommend either tapping your feet or wearing a sport slip on shoe. Much of the exercises will require you to stand with balance support from your chair, and then raise up to the balls of your feet a complete another series of the movements. The padding of shoes or tape will help reduce the strain an pain on your feet. Let me be clear this will not teach you to become a dancer, but the squats, leg lifts, presses and stretches will work your entire body.

I myself am an experienced dancer, so that being said I thought this DVD was fantastic. I've been out of comission for quit a while, having had a baby and being diagnosed with a chronic condition. Wanting to get back into my old fitness regimen, I needed a solid way to begin. Enter Element: Ballet Conditioning. It's a good pace, the moves are solid, and it's everything I did as a child and teenager that kept me slim, fit and healthy. This is most definitely a healthy way to get your body back in shape.

That being said, the music is bland. If you can keep up without it, mute it and pump your own music for better energy.  Also, my two year old kept up with a lot of the stuff just by following along what she watched. So if you can get past any frustration of not knowing the names of moves or having them broken down for you, then you don't necessarily need to be an experienced dancer to follow along.",1361750400,9,1145,4.291666666666667

It's not for the faint of heart, and it's not a workout you can automatically jump into, so I wouldn't recommend this for a beginner. This is a DVD that you need to ease into, unless you're an experienced dancer/athletic person. It has a warmup routine, and then the workout routine, which after about 25 minutes, made me tired!

The instructor, Elise Gulan, was a principal soloist for the Virginia Ballet Company and her experience shows as she so capably demonstrates the movements.  The cueing is done in voiceover.  The workout takes place in an exquisitely beautiful outdoor setting which adds to the lovely tranquility of the workout.  Elise starts out with graceful, flowing stretches before getting into the barre work.  Although it is helpful to have a barre, Ms. Gulan does all of the supported work with a chair.  After the barre work, which will really work your legs/glutes, she leads you through a series of kicks (battements) to the front, back and sides.  Next is jumps in first, second and fifth position.  This will also work your legs and raise your heartrate.  None of the jumps take up a lot of room.  Another short series of stretches follow to get out the kinks in your muscles from all of your hard work.  Then you go into a short but intense Pilates segment to work your core muscles.  Elise finishes up the 51-minute workout with some more relaxing, elongating stretches.  I would rate this a high-intermediate workout.",1360540800,7,1322,4.695652173913044

It is essentially the barre portion of a ballet class with some things that would typically be done center floor included. This was always my favorite portion of class and it is a great strengthening workout. The reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars is that I think if you have no ballet experience you might not get as much out of some of the movement if you don't know the technique. For example, a tendu should use muscles all the way up your leg, which is why it is a good exercise. But if you don't know this, it kind of just looks like sliding your foot on the floor and you wouldn't get much of a workout. I think she could have done a better job of explaining technique for those who are not familiar. I will definitely be using it again!",1360454400,6,812,4.1455696202531644

By the end, my legs were burning but I felt really good!

This workout is intense on the legs but the core and lats get a pretty good toning as well.  The arms do get some action  but I think I would like to add something that focuses on them more.

2965367,5,B000WC38BO,"This DVD is for those of us who are bored, tired, or sick of Jillian Michaels and similar workout ""gurus"" whose workouts coerce the viewer into frantic and frenzied movement during an inefficient and painful 20 minutes of yelling and punching. This DVD is also for those of us who prefer measured and elegant movement, combined with the history, moves, and strategy of a discipline that has been shaping bodies for over many centuries.

I am not a fit and slim ballet dancer like the leader, Elise, but that didn't make me feel any less graceful as she led me through a series of yoga-inspired stretches, then onto ballet moves that incorporated basics such as pli, port de bras (how to carry the arms), relev or balancing on the balls of one's feet. There are some jumps such as jumping from second to first position in a cardio section, and the ab section is mostly doing bicycling moves with the legs.

I appreciated that Elise first did the exercises slowly, then gradually increased their tempo once I got used to them. She also explained what each technical ballet term was, giving the video authenticity. What struck me the most is that she often mentioned that while it was okay to stretch or move within your range of mobility, that, with continual practice, one's flexibility will increase. As simple as it sounds, it made me want to continue to work out to see the effects of the program. I also appreciated her ballerina's sensibility shining through with reminders to smile and to enjoy the movements. They weren't phony, but I could see she enjoyed the exercise. The video even ends with a curtsy to applaud your efforts!

Although I gave the video 5 stars, on account of the high production quality, beautiful setting, affordable price, emphasis on elegance and legitimate ballet, I do have a few suggestions. First of all, the music is primarily smooth modern chill or jazz. I was hoping to have some classical music as I find that most relaxing. The music here is not horrible, but it would have been nice to have perhaps an alternate audio track.

Secondly, a previous reviewer mentioned that it would be too hard to do this DVD without prior knowledge of ballet. While I'm familiar with some ballet terms, and took ballet in kindergarten, I can't say that that gives me any advantage over someone who hasn't. Elise explains the terms she uses.

I took ballet as a kid and knew the moves would definitely work on toning my muscles. I was right! My body was already familiar with the positions so they weren't strange to me like Zumba and other dance exercise videos. I was able to catch on right away - although I couldn't walk on my rubber legs after the first 2 times - I can now! And am feeling so proud of myself for creating a strong over 50 physique.,1349136000,11,532,4.076190476190476

2965410,5,B000WC38BO,"I'm really liking this workout! I've decided to go to this style of strength training as opposed to weights because I like the effect on my body better. After using it for about 2 weeks I can say I'm very pleased with it.

I have never done ballet or ballet conditioning before, but I do have experience with exercise, Pilates, yoga, etc. I find that this workout is very accessible for people with no ballet background, it is easy to follow, and yet it will totally kick your butt!

I enjoy the more mellow tone of the workout, the music isn't the best, but it is pleasant enough, and honestly if you are doing these exercises intensely the burn should distract you from the slightly dorky music. I like how it comes across as a relaxation workout, and Elise keeps telling you to smile and enjoy it while you are feeling some crazy burn in your muscles. I really prefer that to the boot camp technique with the more aggressive tone.

Also I am finding that these types of exercises don't irritate my back. This workout strengthens the entire body and is not hard on my back at all.

Two things though I'd like to point out that I think could be better:
1. There is one exercise where she says something like ""move up and to the side"" and I am not sure if it is 2 movements or one, it is a small movement and hard to tell exactly what she is doing.
2. Personally I'd like more stretching at the end, so when the workout is over I do all the stretching I like.

All in all I'm totally excited about ballet conditioning now!",1346284800,10,1522,4.289198606271777

I think most people know that ballet is a fantastic challenge to the muscles, but emphasizing their usage through such demanding application during conditioning is just plain tough! (in a good way).  Not a single muscle can kick back and relax during this dvd.  Focusing on correct posture, stability, and technique during the execution of each move provides wonderful lower and upper body strength and endurance training....and your core will love you! ...and all in the convenience of your own home.

This DVD reinforces the ballet terms and movements that I've learned in class, without explaining the exact positioning required. This makes it much more enjoyable as I already know from class how to do the move and my goal is just to have a ballet body and graceful movements, not become a ballerina. You don't need any ballet training to follow this program as you can just follow the instructor. You can jump to a particular section or just follow it all the way through. This is a DVD that I'll probably do weekly to give myself a more fun version of a ballet class.",1344124800,3,746,4.413043478260869

What it is, is basically warm-ups you do in your ballet class with a higher intensity. If you've never done ballet before, do not assume that it's relaxed and easy. You make it look graceful, but the moves itself are intense and challenging. But they are also doable even for someone who has never done ballet before.

2965448,5,B000WC38BO,"I just received my ""Ballet Conditioning"" DVD in the mail and got to work straight away. The workout is about 50 min but it went by super quickly. I think it should be called ""Ballet Meditation"" instead b/c it was extremely calming and my legs felt so wonderful and stretched out after I finished. I am an avid runner so this workout was not a ""feel the burn"" kind of thing but it's a fabulous warm-up before I go on my runs; it stretches me out and gets rid of a lot of lactic acid. I found some parts of this workout challenging though b/c I don't have great flexibility. The majority of this workout includes a segment during which you balance standing next to a chair while doing leg work. In the middle is a fun jumping segment (I couldn't go full out on this part b/c I live in a 2nd floor apartment). The last segment includes some Pilates style abdominal work and a stretching cool down. I have other Pilates DVDs that employ a few similar moves but this one is my new favorite b/c it is distinctly different; the setting is a garden overlooking the Pacific Ocean and the host is so graceful that I become inspired to perfect my own form instead of doggedly slogging through! If you like this DVD, you should also like ""Pilates: Target Specifics"" w/ Jennifer Kries. If you want an extension of the ab workout at the end of ""Ballet Conditioning,"" I suggest ""Pilates Ab Workout"" w/ Ana Caban.",1340668800,3,1397,4.397683397683398

2965450,4,B000WC38BO,"I'm 31 years old & I have three children ages 1-4 years. After my first baby I got into Power 90, and if you do that I'll tell you that you need to be at Level 5-6 before you can expect yourself to be able to pull off this DVD. If you're starting from scratch take it SLOW.
With my most recent pregnancy I used this DVD for toning 3 times a week, supplementing with P90 1-2 Sculpt's band workout. I skipped the abs and jumps and did the remaining 20 min. or so. And I had the best delivery and recovery yet! It was amazing how good I felt! Plus, after so much repetition I was able to do some stretches in the hospital that took off lots of muscle tension from delivery...if you've never had a baby you'd be surprised how much you use your whole body in delivery. My arms and back are always sore...but then I use a bar to grab hold of. TMI.
Speaking of bars, you don't need a barre for this DVD, just a chair!!! And a soft place (carpet or mat) for abs. Nor do you need much space at all! I do this in our small office. Plus after I know the reps I can just mute it an listen to or watch my own thing simultaneously. You'll notice she sounds very ethereal in her voice-over and in the use of music...very other-worldly and Nirvana-ish. Hence the muting in preference of my own thing. :)
Before purchase, go to youtube and check out ""Element Ballet Conditioning"" to get a feel for this video. This DVD gives a fresh, new perspective on how easy it is to fit dance into your life and how trendy it can be. While you're at it also youtube ""Ballet Beautiful Online Blasts by Mary Helen Bowers"" and get the feel for that. In my opinion only, MHB reminds me of the preppy girls from high school who were snobs...and she models so many different kinds of unitards with bare legs that it makes me think she's totally into herself. Couldn't stomach it.
I'm here to buy another copy for myself because our Chinese Int'l student confiscated mine. ;-) Actually, I gave it to her to try and she loved it so much I gave it to her for graduation.

In order to work my abs, I try to focus on breathing and core strength as I mimic the moves of the instructor.

I am ready to take some future ballet classes and to use this as one of my prime methods of toning below the waste. She also works the abs and your flexibility. I wish that I used this video more often in the past versus other programs that I have wasted my time doing. I am now going to experiment on this video and see if I have more results long term.

I used to dance ballet as a child and am horrendously out of shape now, but I have hopes of regaining definition in my legs (and well the rest of me too) and the fact that I had to slide down my stairs on my bum last night after doing this workout (I just got the dvd last night) leads me to believe that this will help me along this path :) Despite the fact that my abs and legs hate my guts, this dvd gets 2 thumbs and 10 toes up :)",1326931200,3,592,3.821138211382114

This DVD allows me to practice some of the most basic movements 2 times a week in addition to the class, at my own pace. It doesn't have as deep of stretches as I would like, but my hips are too tight for that right now anyway.

Also, there are no moving combinations, turns, etc. It's largely barre work, leg/core work, and stretching.

This DVD is perfect for those looking to get back into it after a long absence and beginners.",1326326400,4,554,4.3173076923076925

It's a lovely workout and anyone who has dance before will catch on quickly.,1326240000,,324,4.423728813559322

The instructor's movements are so graceful and beautiful and she makes it looks so easy but it is a great deal of work! At first I worried about things like getting my leg up high enough or pointing my toes just right, but really it doesn't matter. Once I learned to work to best of my present ability, I relaxed and learned to enjoy the movements. Besides, the DVD gets easier with more practice. After using the DVD, my leg muscles are yelling at me and I love it! And who knew how challnegeing it is to keep one arm up and out? It may not feel like you are working your arms but really you are. Overall, a fun way to workout!",1325203200,,707,4.057142857142857

This dvd has alot of the same basic moves from the class I took, but the difference is THIS DVD IS BORING! It's a ""Ballet Inspired"" workout and I knew that when I oredered it which is fine, but I was yawning half way into it. I think it's because the music it is set to sounds like sleepy time music rather than upbeat or classical piano for barre work. If you can follow along without verbal instruction,then I highly suggest plugging into your mp3 player and use your own ballet music for this. That's just my opinion. Other than that it is a good way to stretch out and I'll use it as a warmup for my other workouts.",1324166400,4,761,4.08
2965584,5,B000WC38BO,"When I first popped the dvd in all I could think was, ""Oh my god how boring..."" I finished the workout but it felt kind of boring. Well a month later and this is the one of the only workout videos I am still doing regularly at least 4 times a week. Why the change? Well it's challenging enough that it can sometimes seem impossible to finish, but because of the way it's filmed I can mute it and watch a movie or a tv show and still do this workout.

I do really enjoy the workout, it feels like I am doing a ballet warmup! The first part is stretching the spine and then moves into releves on the toes and then plies. The second consists of barre work done with a chair, if you want more of a challenge you can do it without a chair, but I am so unbalanced I can barely hold tree pose for longer than a couple of seconds. The last part includes a burst of cardio with jumps, then goes into ab/core work which is HARD.

All things considered, this is a nice relaxing workout that can seem boring, but is extremely effective.",1323302400,,1024,4.08955223880597

2965596,2,B000WC38BO,"I'm only giving this two stars because if you can stay awake through the whole thing, it does work your muscles.  Elise does nothing to keep you awake or interested, especially when she says (read in whispery soft voice),"" Now let's repeat the sequence on the other side"" which means you have about sixteen reps of the same boring exercise with the other leg. There is not really any cardio except a tiny section of the workout.  And by ""cardio"" I mean jumping in place, not fun and beautiful balletic leaps that kept me interested in the real ballet classes I used to take.  I'm a mother of four, including a young baby , and frankly I'd rather be napping than doing this workout.  In fact, I'd rather be watching paint dry.  I highly recommend Jennifer Galardi's Ballet Body if you're interested in having a dancer's physique AND enjoying your balletic workout, and if you want intense conditioning for lean muscles but don't mind something in the ""kinda boring"" category, try Core Fusion Collection.

So using it finally for the first time, even with the beginning work, i.e., the grande plies, I was like WOW!  This has quickly become one of my favorite DVDs.  The movements are lovely and elegant, and Ms. Gulan's voice is beautiful (just as is she) and her cue practice is easy to follow.  I've been using this DVD for almost two weeks now and weird as it seems, I feel like a ballerina right there in my living room.  I feel like I'm actually on ""stage"" :)  Shoulders are erect; legs and arms are nice and lean/long; abs constantly pulled in... perfect...

I danced ballet for over ten years. In recent years, I've lost almost all of my flexibility. I tried yoga, but I hated it as I wasn't getting that familiar ""stretch"" I was used to in ballet.
I bought this DVD specifically to get the stretch I was used to in my thighs, calves, and back. It had a lot of good reviews, so I thought I was on the right track. Not so. From my years of dancing, I can tell you that you do NOT go into any form of kicking or jumping before you sit, stand, and hold to stretch the bejesus out of your legs. She is having you flick and kick your legs after doing a couple of plies! That's a surefire way for someone to get hurt!! I have absolutely no sort of stretch in my legs, just soreness from her making me do yoga moves and disguising them as ballet. And I didn't even dance professionally and I can tell you her form is horrible.

Long story short, THIS IS NOT BALLET, THIS IS YOGA. And the search for a good ballet dvd continues",1316995200,9,1075,4.042253521126761

2965617,2,B000WC38BO,"As a complete beginner to ballet, this DVD was quite difficult to follow.  I expected the tutorial to give a basic introduction to ballet basics before going into the harder exercises, which it did not do.  The instructor, though pleasant enough, begins using technical terms within the first few minutes of the video, never explaining how positions should look and feel throughout the body.  She also does not thoroughly explain many of techniques.  For example, she will say 'Leg up, lift up', whereas I would like to know which muscles should be used and which you should be feeling, posture, and core positioning.  This is particularly irritating with most of the leg stretches, in which I'm not sure whether to push through my heels or through my toes, tighten hips or relax them, etc.

It seems more suited for people who have had some sort of ballet or dance training in the past, but I would not recommend it for absolute beginners who are looking for a step-by-step guide.",1316736000,12,981,4.775147928994083
2965618,5,B000WC38BO,"I have learned that ballet conditioning is one of the most effective kinds of exercises to work out the entire body at once, creating leaner legs, arms, and midsection.  I take a ballet conditioning class at my local YMCA twice an week, and then do this once a week or so.  My arms, which at 43 had begun to sag, have toned up, and my shoulders, while they do not look like Elise's yet, are looking much better in tank tops!  My legs are noticable stronger and have firmed up.  After doing this workout and the one at my gym I notice my arms and back are sore, as well as my legs.  The more often I do it the less sore I am, but I really notice it when I miss a week!  I am a pear shape, and I find there is not enough rear end work for me on the DVD, so at home I supplement with the ""behind and hip"" exercises from Callanetics (highly recommended as well).  A similar type of workout is The Bar Method, which I love as well - these types of workouts have made me more slender in my 40's than I was in my 20's and 30's, when I wore two clothing sized larger on the bottom half of my body because of my pear shape.  Now I wear one size, 4 or small.  None of the running, cycling, moving from one piece of gym equipment to the next, aerobic type classes - ever managed to produce the results I have now.",1316131200,2,1302,3.9578544061302683

i like it better than pilates now too, because the abs part at the end is helpful, but it just helps your core throughout the workout once you realize to always use it for power.

I really liked the workout, it's 45/50 minutes long and it went by pretty fast.  The first portion was standing ballet leg work with a chair.  Even though I don't know the ballet terms I still could do it, she gave good instruction and you can easily see her feet and arms to mimic her.  The second portion (a bit shorter than the first portion, which is fine) is on the floor, which was pilates core work.  I feel it really balanced out the workout.  Overall, I thought it was a pretty good workout.  Probably not a workout I'm going to do on a weekly basis but I will definitely keep it in my dvd rotation to help me train muscles that I usually don't use.",1313884800,2,807,4.269736842105263

Even though I have a portable ballet barre at home, I love the fact that she encourages the use of regular household items, such as a chair, or counter to help with balance. Her cuing is great, and she makes the simplest movements look so beautiful and graceful. I watched the dvd first to see what it was about. I looked easy, but upon doing it you will see that it really works your body. Ballet uses your body weight as resistance. I would reccomend this dvd to anyone looking to achieve the lean look of a dancer, but I have to add that you may want to start off slowly and build up to the whole dvd because it will wear you out quickly!

I didn't need tons of room for grapevines like in other cardio/workout videos, I just needed a little leg space.  By the middle of the video, my legs were shaking very hard and really maxing out their muscle potential, it felt great.  It felt like I was in ballet toning class again.  I haven't had ballet in years, yet it wasn't too hard that I couldn't do it.  I think it would still provide a great workout for someone who dances every day.  the fact that I didn't feel murdered by the end of it means I am much more likely to keep up with it each week.

It starts with a short warm up.  Then there's a nice barre section.  You use a chair which works fine.  There's a center section which I skip due to lack of room (and not wanting to wake my house up with a bunch of jumping!).  The core workout is tough.  It ends with some stretching.

I love this DVD.  It reminds me of my dancing days.  It is definitely the most challenging workout DVD that I own.  A ballet background would be helpful, but not required.  If you're like me, and you're a former student, you will love this.  The instructor explains things well and is very positive.

There were comments about the music.  It is bad, but it's mostly just ""background music"", so it doesn't bother me too much.",1311033600,2,896,4.33939393939394

I bought this dvd for my physical therapist and she loves it  A good friend of mine who works out daily also bought the dvd after borrowing mine.

This video did a good job of replicating the ballet class experience - it's very graceful and well sequenced.  But you definitely feel the work; there's a point halfway through where I can barely keep my arm up and the thought of one more port de bras is scary!

Some of the reviews noted that there is a voiceover for most of the workout and that Elise doesn't actually speak during the workout and that seemed totally weird to me before I did it.

The DVD is more challenging and also incorporates core strengthening. I am an intermediate Pilates/Yoga student and this DVD still gives me challenges I can work up to.

I was initially hesitant when I put it in b/c of the way the instructor was speaking- kind of fake and monotoned... but once she started it.. it was great! It was narrated by her while watching her full body move throughout the rountine. I really loved it. I can't wait to make time between the kids to do it again b/c I felt my posture improved and I love how everytime I got tired and wanted to give up, she'd talk about either finding the joy in the dance or moving at your own capabilities.

The first day I simply watched about half of this video to get inspired.  I think that was a good technique because I couldn't wait to begin the next day, and I found the series of exercises easier to follow since I'd watched them first.  Elise is a lovely instructor and I appreciate that she uses ballet terminology (I don't have a dance background) and encourages good posture, graceful extensions and artistic expression throughout the workout.  Even I, with my big baby bump, felt graceful doing this workout.  And I also felt comfortable modifying my way through.  I did skip out on the jumps (modifying with ""bounces"") and my flexibility is still very low. But I trust Elise's assurance that I'm going to get stronger and more limber each time I do this series of exercises.  My legs were literally wobbling as I finished the workout the first time, and my arms felt warm and challenged by the ballet postures used throughout.  Immediately, I experienced improvement in my posture, core strength, and soundness of sleep.  I actually feel like I'm carrying my baby in a more graceful alignment and my back no longer hurts!!!  I believe this workout will not only help me prepare for childbirth but will also help me bounce back into shape after delivery.",1306540800,2,1425,4.66
2965675,5,B000WC38BO,"I love this DVD, it's a great, low impact workout that really hits all areas of my body and has helped improve my posture.  It's easy to look at some on the moves she does and think it looks too easy, and wouldn't be an effective workout; in reality, if you're concentrating on holding your body in dancer's position the whole time, it really is a good burn, especially in your legs (that squat plie sequence is a killer on my thighs.)  The key is you can't just go through the movements, you have to really concentrate on contracting your muscles, standing straight and strong and moving your body purposefully.

This DVD is not for anyone looking for a hardcore workout, or dancing instruction, it's for someone who wants to tone their body like a ballet dancer and enjoy the graceful, elegant moves that build the burn slowly.  It's not a cardiovascular workout per se, like a Turbo Jam would be, but I surprisingly find myself having to catch my breath several times throughout and I'm in good shape.  For me, it gets my heart rate up enough to burn the fat, but not to the point of exhaustion (I'm in pretty good shape and workout regularly - I've done P90X, Turbo Jam, Tae Bo, etc.)

For me, this workout soothes me similar to yoga or pilates, so it's a nice addition to all my other DVDs.",1306540800,3,1295,4.443037974683544

2965677,5,B000WC38BO,"I am buying this DVD again, as my first copy got ruined during my last move. I, at 190lbs, 5'5"" needed something to do to get the weight off. Elise is the most relaxingly motivating person I have ever had on a workout video. The movements are great, and challenging. After about 85 days (doing this every day except Sunday) I had lost 45lbs and felt beautiful again. My posture was outstanding, my self esteem was soaring, and I couldn't wait to do the video every day.
This is a truly beautiful routine that you feel good doing, and at the end you cannot wait for Elise to point out that you ARE a little leaner than when you began. Genius motivating statement!

I now have a 1 year old, and have put back on some of the weight, and now that we're moved and settled, its what I cannot wait to do. This video is going to save me once again...and I'm stoked. How often can you say that about a video?

Thank you Elise...if you ever read these reviews....just ""Thank you!!""!!!",1305331200,20,974,4.316939890710382
2965678,5,B000WC38BO,"I was very impressed with this workout DVD, a lot of people's reviews talk about it being an intensive lower body workout, but I have to say I find it to be the most complete full body workout I have experienced since Air Force Basic Training.  I can't name a muscle in my body that isn't feeling it the next day.  Most workout DVDs I have tried will work some area of the body, but this is a full body workout at its best.  Also, it is excellent if you don't have a lot of money to spend on expensive equipment or gym membership--it only requires a chair...my only suggestion is that women make sure they are wearing a good sports bra while doing the workout as the jumps can be a little intense.  Overall, I felt every bit as worked out as when I go the actual gym without having to leave the comfort of my living room...or my two sleeping children.",1305072000,7,851,4.2024539877300615

I like her narration vs. her trying to talk and do the movements. It was definitely a challenge for my legs, they quiver during the first segment. My legs feel great after doing it. After three weeks of doing it three times a week(along with Weight watchers), and nothing else(I have an infant),my pants are too big. I had lost weight through diet alone, but my clothes didn't fit differently until I started this workout. If I could fit in cardio,too,I am sure the results would be amazing. My mom was visiting and did it with me, we immediatately ordered her a copy after our first workout. I do think anybody can do it, but if your a begginer don't expect to be able to lift your leg as high as she can. It has a lot of a pilates element to it, with a ballet twist. A lot more enjoyable to me than my pilates workout dvds. Element did a great job with this dvd and I will checkout other titles by them.",1301616000,4,1055,4.227722772277228
2965702,3,B000WC38BO,"This video is really more of a fusion of ballet, Pilates and yoga than straight ballet: it's not like the ballet classes I remember.  The music is cheesy, new age garbage.  I don't understand why they couldn't use a more classical ballet score.

The exercises are difficult if you are out of shape like I am.  This is partly caused by the slowness of the exercises (like yoga).  There is very little movement---she seems to be concentrating much more on ""core"" (as in Pilates) than dance.  This is a workout, not a prep for dancing.  I wish I could find a more classical dvd that's really based on ballet.",1301443200,,605,4.495412844036697
2965703,5,B000WC38BO,"A surprisingly great ballet-driven exercise routine, even for those with years of ballet training like me.  It's perfect for those who have been out of the ballet class loop for a while and want to get back into dancing shape.",1301443200,,226,4.65
2965704,5,B000WC38BO,"A little about me: I bought this DVD because I was seriously out of shape. I have a little dance/ballet experience, but not much. I also have scar tissue around both my knees and if I do too much I definitely feel it. However, having done ballet in the past I also knew that it's one of the best ways for getting in shape, so I was excited to find this DVD.

The first time I did it, it was pitiful. I managed about 20 minutes before I gave up and laid on the floor pouring sweat for a while. The next time I did about half the reps of everything and skipped a couple of the hardest exercises, but made it through to the end. That was 6 weeks ago, and I've been doing Ballet Conditioning at least 3x a week since then. Just in the last few weeks I've finally worked up to doing all the exercises in the recommended reps, but even before that I noticed definite changes in my body. My saggy butt moved back where it belongs; my pants are noticeably baggier (especially my thighs); my tummy is losing fat, gaining definition, and developing some impressive ab muscles; my arms and shoulders are also gaining definition and developing muscles without looking like a muscle-man. Can I chalk it all up to this DVD? Probably not. I alternate this with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Quick-Fix-Stability-Ball-Workout/dp/B001CDFXRO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Quick Fix: Stability Ball Workout</a>&nbsp;(my ""lazy"" days) and go for daily walks, but I think this deserves much of the credit for my recent 10Lb weight loss.

Even though the workout is almost an hour in length, and physically demanding I never get bored with it, and like Elise Gulan says several times throughout it, the more muscle strength and flexibility you gain the more of a workout you get. I love her as an instructor because she's not at all obnoxious; no irritating cheerleader-y pep talks, and excellent cuing. She's definitely encouraging, but it's not fake or overdone.

One thing that I have noticed is that some people say this is tough on knees. I'm far from being an expert, but I can see how if you're not doing the exercises correctly it could be very painful. If you're turning out into first position from your knees instead of your hips, or not using your muscles to control your landings during the jumping section it will definitely hurt. That may be the only way in which having a little ballet experience pays off, but I don't think it's that hard to learn.

I do have one complaint about this DVD: I wish the beginning warm-up was a little longer and had a greater variety of stretches. I did just the stretches contained on the DVD the first half dozen times I used it, and it was fine; I didn't hurt myself or anything from lack a longer warm-up. However, I know my body well enough to know that's not enough for me, so I spend about 10 minutes doing stretches before I even start the DVD. I find that doing that allows me to get much deeper into the workout. But that's my body and of course everyone's is different, which is why I'm not knocking a star off over it. Overall though this is definitely my favourite workout, and I highly recommend it if you're looking to tone your muscles and lose weight.",1301443200,16,3234,4.658493870402802
2965705,4,B000WC38BO,I bought this before I found out I was pregnant. It's a nice and calming video. There are times that I prefer a relaxing workout instead of going to the gym and using machines and weights. This is a great alternative.,1301184000,,217,4.317073170731708
2965706,5,B000WC38BO,"With several ballet conditioning exercises available it can be a difficult choice, but this is one of the best I've used. I have limited ballet experience but that is no matter with this DVD. It's easy to follow with instructions and counts, only hindrance for me was the inability to follow the rear leg lifts exactly. However I expect this to not be an issue with time and practice. The core workout was great! I could handle a bit more of it though. I expect to use it every other day in between cardio and weights.",1300838400,,518,4.40625
2965707,4,B000WC38BO,"This is almost the perfect combination of instruction, difficulty and pace for my first ballet workout excursion. Almost perfect because I could have used slightly more instruction throughout the workout. Even adding more instructions on how to stand in first position (Do you tuck your hips under? Should you turn your thighs in when in first position?) would be helpful, especially for those who have no prior training in ballet.

Nonetheless, the workout overall is still excellent. The program is fun and goes by very quickly (about 50 minutes in total). You are taken through a series of ballet exercises that really challenge your flexibility and if performed correctly (hence, a little more instruction on stance and form would be helpful) should sculpt and define muscles. You definitely feel this happening. One thing I love about this workout is that you only need a chair for balance (unless you have a ballet barre at home) so it is very ""portable"" (in all senses of the word).

One thing to note: this program is mainly focused on core and lower body (hence, the name of the video..ballet conditioning). There are technically no upper body exercises with the exception of keeping your arm in ballet-like poses for each series. After a while, your arm muscles will start to ache and feel like they are being worked out because gravity will be calling. Not that this is a bad thing but if you are looking for a workout that includes actual upper body exercises, this is not it. However, if you want to set your lower body and core on fire in a graceful and delicate manner, I would strongly recommend this video.",1300752000,13,1623,4.792857142857143
2965739,5,B000WC38BO,"It's a helpful exercise for those trying to improve their posture and push the limits of flexibility. While she makes you work hard, Gulan does it with a grace of a ballerina, making the workout more pleasant and less stressful. She explains every move, but doesn't stop to talk -- no time wasted.
My only criticism of the workout is that it can be hard on knees.
For those unfamiliar or new to ballet conditioning, I would suggest practicing yoga and/or pilates with lots of stretching prior to trying Gulan's workout. While one will become more flexible after a few sessions of ballet conditioning, prior stretching and strength-building will help make the most out of this workout and in less time.",1300492800,,701,4.801652892561983
2965740,3,B000WC38BO,"First of all, I grew up with the Vaganova ballet system and danced for over 15 years and am therefore used to a very clean and strict execution of ballet exercises - Elise Gulan has a lot of strength and stamina but I was and still am very surprised to hear that she used to be a classical dancer: The way she carries out some of the typical ballet exercises is way too sloppy for my liking; I believe that is also the reason why her leg muscles appear to be overly bulky on the thighs (you won't ever see that on a female Russian dancer for example. It's a sign for using incorrect turnout over years and as a result the muscles aren't stretched properly).

However, her ballet conditioning is challenging and certainly strength building - if done properly - and therefore I'm giving it 3 stars. Also I would have appreciated classical music in the background.",1300406400,10,861,4.449367088607595
2965741,5,B000WC38BO,"I bought this video to supplement an adult beginner's ballet class I'm taking. It does address some basic moves and use proper terminology, but it's really designed to help you gain strength and balance to improve your ballet practice (or get a 'ballet body'), not actually teach you how to dance ballet.

It's all balance and body weight training, and it really heats you up. The majority of the video is done standing, with the aid of a chair for balance, but it ends with a floor segment of really killer pilates abs moves and gentle stretching. The exercises look really easy when the dancer does them, but trust me, you will break a serious sweat.

The setting is pleasant and the dancer has aspirational form -- and abs! It's helpful to have some background with ballet, just for the sake of getting the form right, but you can probably figure it out if you pay close attention to the dancer. Form is one thing the video really doesn't address at length.

I like that the directions are given through a voiceover, instead of having the dancer talk you through things. It makes cuing much easier. The narrator isn't annoying or overly encouraging either; she says things like ""find joy in the movement"" and ""concentrate on your practice,"" but mostly she just tells you what to do.

I've done tons of videos, including most of Jillian's Michaels'. I'm also a long-distance runner and consider myself to be moderately to extremely fit, and I must say this workout had me shaking and sweating by the end. Highly recommended!",1300320000,2,1526,4.704119850187266

I recommend that if you're a raw beginner to take this slowly and in segments. While it may not leave you panting, it will definitely give your muscles a fat burning workout as it lengthens and strengthens them.
Already I have adopted a healthier posture and seen results.  While a newcomer to the art of ballet can gain a great deal from this video, some knowledge of basic ballet movements is probably preferable.",1299196800,,747,4.492647058823529

2965760,4,B000WC38BO,"""Ballet Conditioning"" is surprisingly good- the exercises are easy to follow, but have immediate effects.  Despite being fit, my heart rate and temperature were quickly elevated by this DVD!

While the ""New York City Ballet"" DVD provides a greater assortment of exercises combined with brief dance routines, I found ""Ballet Conditioning"" provides a better workout.  With this DVD, the exercises focus on your entire leg or core, rather than engaging small muscle groups.  This results in a good combination of cardio and strength training, and you feel a fairly complete workout.  While you aim for a precise movement, you will still feel the benefits even as you learn the technique.  All repetitions are shown for both sides of the body, so you don't need to pause the DVD to complete your sets.

In contrast, the NYCB DVD tends to focus on strengthening and refining small muscle groups.  The exercises are helpful for a dancer who already has strength and flexibility... and who has a low enough body fat percentage to show off these muscles.  Only a couple of repetitions of each exercise are shown (making it difficult if you don't have a ballet background) and only on one side of the body.  In order to use the NYCB DVD, you constantly need to pause the DVD to do your repetitions, switch sides, hold a stretch etc.

The New York City Ballet DVD is a great resource for anyone who already has a ballet background and wants to learn more exercises or stretches on their own.  For someone looking for a good overall workout and an eventual ballet body, ""Ballet Conditioning"" is a better addition to your collection.",1298592000,8,1621,4.812274368231047

This workout certainly challenged my muscles, made my legs shake (not a usual thing for me) and stretched me. I have been doing the workout for two weeks three times a week, and noticed more ab definition, my butt is tighter and my posture is better. I stand taller now which visually makes me look thinner. What's great about the ballet conditioning is that it doesn't add bulk to your thighs, which is my problem zone. Too much weight lifting made muscles in my thighs look bigger than they should.
Pluses: the instructor doesn't waste a lot of time explaining things. She just goes through the motions and explains everything as she goes. Saves you a lot of time.
  Challenging workout
  It is somehow relaxing and I look forward to it, unlike boring weight lifting.
  Really elongates your muscles and makes you stand taller.

Minuses: I wish there were more stretching exercises.
  This is not a ballet class type exercise. You won't learn how to jump in the air and spin on your toes while holding your other leg parallel to the floor.

Overall, a challenging, slimming and satisfying workout you wouldn't want to miss. I don't think it's for those who want to loose weight - I didn't notice a number on my scale drop, but it's for those who want to look thinner while weighting the same.",1297209600,5,1515,4.598513011152416

Best of all for me is that it's barefoot.  Bellydancers dance (for the most part) in bare feet, and workouts with tennis shoes don't help strengthen your feet much.  This workout is not only done in bare feet, it includes optional variations on many moves that have you rising to the ball of your foot, which helps strengthen the foot itself.  Since many bellydance moves are done on the ball of the foot, this is amazingly helpful in helping the dancer condition the body for those moves.

For the price, this is an excellent DVD.",1295222400,,338,4.9298245614035086
2965782,4,B000WC38BO,"WHO THIS WORKOUT IS AND ISN'T FOR:

-I think this workout is worthy of 5 stars, but I knocked one star off because the description doesn't make it clear that this workout is NOT for those who have no ballet experience.  The instructor keeps you moving and does not stop to explain the steps or discuss proper form.  If you don't know the basics already, you'll be lost and you could hurt yourself.

-Speaking of injuries, this workout (or any ballet program) is not good for anyone with bad knees.

-If you are a serious dancer, this is probably not for you either.  You will likely find it too easy and will have criticisms of the instructor's form.  Element makes workout videos (Yoga and Pilates mostly), they do not specialize in ballet.

-Now, if you're familiar with basic ballet and want a good workout, this IS for you.  I love it.

WHAT YOU NEED:

You need space to move freely and a chair to use as a barre (the instructor uses a chair, too).  There is a jumping section, so make sure there's nothing fragile around you.

SEQUENCE OF THE WORKOUT:

As others have described, the workout consists mostly of basic ballet barre work. You'll do plies, tendus, ronds de jambe, developpes, and so forth.  But the emphasis is on conditioning your body, so the combinations are very challenging physically.  There's a brief section of floor work (battements and sautees), a VERY INTENSE abdominal workout (which seemed to me to be Pilates-inspired), and a brief stretch at the end.

WHY I LIKE IT:

I like to use ballet as part of my exercise routine because, like yoga and Pilates, it combines strengthening exercises with stretching and leaves me invigorated.  This video in particular is CHALLENGING.  The first few times I tried it, I couldn't do it all the way through without stopping for momentary breaks.  The ab workout at the end took me weeks to be able to do without stopping.  The challenge leaves me with a great sense of accomplishment and very strong legs!

I also think the scenery is beautiful, but not too busy too distract your focus away from your workout.  The instructor's voice-over can be annoying at times, but I can live with that.

A NOTE ABOUT THE INSTRUCTOR'S BODY TYPE:

I've read a few comments here about the instructor's body (specifically, the fact that she talks about the long, lean lines of a ballet dancer's body, while she is much more muscular than a ballerina).  According to the information on the DVD case, the instructor is a former principal soloist for a ballet company, but currently a ""certified personal trainer and instructor of Yoga, Core Fusion, and Core Energy Flow."" (I have no idea what those last 2 are).  That explains her current body type.  Anyway, let's be honest, nothing is going to give you a ballerina's body except becoming a ballerina.  The workout on this DVD is not gonna do that.  It will however, help you develop strength and flexibility.",1294963200,17,2911,4.6936758893280635
2965783,5,B000WC38BO,"The setting is what almost looks like a country club or an outdoor wedding plaza. It's next to a pool with pillars, landscaped with flowers, and located conveniently next to the ocean. I actually really like the location they picked for the exercise. It beats a studio lit by florescent lighting. Everything has a contemporary feel that makes it relaxing and fresh.

My legs kill during the plis, and that burn feels oh so good! I want to say over half the DVD features barre work, or in this case, chair work. The chair is nice and does the job. There is a lot of exercise and heat building in the legs and butt during exercises with the chair. Trust me. It kills.

The camera changes often so you're not bored of looking at the same old thing all the time. It also zooms in and shows a majority of her body so you can compare your movements to hers.

This is an excellent workout. It does exactly what it says it will do and does so very nicely. The camera made it easy for me to mimic her moves. The instructor does a nice job and can clearly accomplish the moves she asks of us. She's happy but not sickeningly so. By the end of the day, I feel properly worked out.",1294963200,4,1169,4.233183856502242

The work is difficult, especially for a beginner, but the instructor constantly reminds you that it is ok to do the exercises to the best of your ability as it is the ""intention"" of the movement that works. I could feel muscles working that I don't think i've used before, and I felt really accomplished when i was done. My only complaint is that she KEPT TALKING!!! the entire time. She was very motivating and what she said was not annoying, but still, i would have appreciated a silent moment or two to help focus.

2965800,4,B000WC38BO,"I also bought the New York City Ballet Workout dvd set along with this one. This dvd is a lot better, she's in a nice sunny location, there's some soothing background music, and she does a pretty good job of keeping you motivated to keep going.

It's kind of strange and surreal following along because even through some of the tougher positions, she is ALWAYS smiling, she NEVER stops smiling, the entire time. That's just not really human.

Anyway, I have the same complaint here regarding dance workouts. When you see her, the first thing you see is how HUGE her thighs are. They are pure, huge, muscle. And the first thing I'm thinking in my head when I start this workout, is that I will never ever want thighs like that. Of course, the workouts are all about the legs, drawing power and relying completely on the thighs to get through all the positions.

So, overall it's decent. It's a lot better than the New York City Ballet workout, that's for sure. But if you're not a dancer, and you just want to workout and kind of look like a svelte ballerina, then I don't think this is the right workout. I do feel like my posture's improved a bit though.",1294099200,2,1155,4.438679245283019
2965801,4,B000WC38BO,"Wow! This workout video is phenomenal! From the very beginning, you are drawn into the beautiful surroundings, the calm music, and the gorgeous instructor. The warm up is simple and supple but it doesn't tire you out or make you feel completely ridiculous. Once the warm up is complete, the chair is used for a series of ballet steps that elongate your whole body, specifically the leg. Then it goes into floor work where balance is key here to elongate the whole body. Once these movements are done, the video moves to jumps that lasts for several minutes. And then the abdominal movements inspired by pilates and then the stretches.

 This nearly hour long video doesn't feel like an hour. I've done it twice now and every time it feels like time just flies. I love to work out and I've the whole P90x collection but I would rather do this video over the P90x for various reasons. First of all, I feel like p90x just exhausts me to the point that I just want to sleep all day and eat my whole fridge. Secondly, a lot of the movements build bulk and require weights and various objects. AND it is really expensive. The Elements video doesn't feel like I'm about to kill myself but it feels like I'm still working my muscles and even sweating. My legs shake a lot and my arms hurt from keeping them positioned in the air for so long. But the end result is that I feel stretched, enlivened, and great. What I have decided to do is just do a little bit of p90x to get my heart rate going and then do this video and Ballet Bootcamp and the NYC ballet conditioning.

Overall, I'm very pleased with this video. The only thing I wish for is that she gives more instruction on how to position the body for each move so I don't hurt myself. I have loads of fun with it and with my mother (who yells at me everytime for making her do the work out, but she loves it much more than anything else she's ever done).

Hope you like it and its worth the money!",1294012800,2,1945,4.291553133514986
2965802,5,B000WC38BO,"I want to start taking ballet classes again, but I'm SO rusty.  I needed something to take Me through the basics and this does exactly that.  You WILL get your heart rate up even though it's not ""aerobic"" so much.  From having to control the body and pay attention to form you get a great workout.

If you have taken ballet before and know to get into the right position, this is great.  I can see if you have never taken ballet before that you might not know all the muscles to be engaging and then doing 50% of what should be going on.  But it's still great.  I like Ballentone center moves as well.",1293667200,2,601,4.173913043478261
2965803,5,B000WC38BO,"Initially, I became interested in ballet workout after observing that many people in ballet classes in my local gym had beautifully toned arms. Their arms were defined and lean yet elegant and feminine - very different from the arms of weight lifters (think Madonna) or even these of experienced yoga instructors.

The DVD offers one workout sequence, composed of the following subsections:
-Warmup/ballet stretching
-Lower body strengthening with ballet movements (plies, eleves, tendus, developes, leg lifts, attitudes)
-Jumps (1st, 2nd, and 5th positions)
-Abdominal work (non ballet workout on the floor such as scissoring of legs)
-Cool down stretch

You may ask, ""where is the upper body workout""? Well, the beauty of the ballet exercise is that there is no need for a separate upper body section, because your arms are working very hard throughout the entire workout (except for the abdominal section), through port de bras, extending of the arms to the sides and overhead. This is a very effective and different way of toning your arms than lifting weights.

Elise maintains a warm, encouraging tone throughout the workout, which does not intimidate a beginner but does not annoy a more advanced user, either. Her comment during the cool down summarizes the tone; ""if you can fold (forward) only few inches, that is beautiful. Because it is an honest expression of where you are today with your exercise"".

If you are looking for a different and effective arms toner, try this DVD. You won't regret.",1293580800,2,1507,5.1138211382113825

The setting is really sunny and makes me feel happy, even when I'm thinking ""I'm gonna die"" inside!  I also really benefitted from Elise's regular use of encouraging words!  Very pleased overall.

That put me off. I thought, ""if i do these exercises, am I gonna have Charles Atlas thighs?"" I also didn't like the fact that while it is based on ballet moves, they don't really tell you much about the moves themselves- is this based on a battement tendu? I want to know these things which is why I gravitated towards a workout with ballet in the title. I will say, however, that I did break a sweat, and felt like I was gonna barf about halfway through.

2965823,4,B000WC38BO,"I have been using this DVD for over 2 months now. I agree with other reviewers that the music is a bit institutional, but the music aside, the DVD and the workout it offers is awesome. I am not a big fan of home exercise DVDs (I'd rather hit the gym) but this DVD is an exception. I love it because it certainly works!

It's a great lower body toner and I saw the results (more defined, thinner legs, flatter tummy and a perkier rear end) in just a few sessions. It helps if you can practice in front of the mirror as it will ensure that your form is on point.

Although there is a little cardio episode within this workout, note please that this DVD will not replace your regular cardio routine. However, it's a great compliment to running, biking, etc. I feel like if one runs 4-5 times a week and does this ballet workout 3-4 times a week, one will be all set.

The workout itself without the final stretches lasts about 45-50 minutes. Anyone can do it. Although, I must say it probably helps if you're already in some sort of shape and not too hamstrung.

I first borrowed this DVD from a local library but loved it so much that I purchased one on Amazon.

Since I am terrible about sticking to a weightlifting routine I thought I'd give this a try. I used to do gymnastics so I love getting back to stretching. The way Elise helps you work your muscles, with the combination of stretching, repetitions and focus, it is unlike anything I've ever done.

It's not that I like elevator music, it's just that elevator music can be ignored, and this music has too much of a beat to be ignored.  So, if you find music with a boring repetitious beat annoying, be forewarned: This not only isn't nice classical music, it's not neutral either.  I've adopted the same solution as the previously mentioned reviewer; MUTE it and listen to something else.  The workout itself is fine, although I'm sure I was missing some of the nuances with the mute button on.  I do recommend this workout unless you dislike music with a steady thump.

2965881,5,B000WC38BO,"I have read the comments, but I would like to hear from people who have actually stuck to this over a ""long"" period of time, be it one or two months, not 3 sessions.  For those of you who have stuck it out, I'd love for you to comment on noticeable changes to your physique as well as flexibility.  i.e. do your clothes actually fit better?  I am a runner - but wanted to add this dvd to my routine to improve toning, lengthing, leaning, etc.  Please shoot me a comment on how you are doing with this.

Going Forward, I must say that I am extremly surprised at the negative comments on Elise.  Really people why would anyone think this woman has huge thighs? Really? Have you never watched biggest loser?  Really?  Quite frankly those people that negatively commented on Elise's - gorgeous athletic body - have Body Dysmorphic Issues - yes look it up please.  Maybe she doesn't look to some like one commentor posted a ""Russian Ballerina"" but people get real.  She is a Ballerina, she is beautiful, elegant, graceful and fit.  To the negative commentors take a look at yourselves before spouting off things that are untrue.  Those folks have eating disorders (I guarantee it) and body dysmorphic issues, i.e. body image problems.  Mainly their own as well as others.",1276041600,,1266,4.598214285714286

This is the kind of intense lower half workout that will have your knees buckling and thighs shaking weakly as you walk away an hour later.  It's really intense.  Ballet practice, of course, includes endless repetitive movements, which is why ballet dancers are so precise--they've practiced the same small movements thousands of times.  Knowing this helps as you continue to do all the small moves in this video.  All of the movements have a cumulative effect that make you want to die...in a good way.

The best part about this video is the soft, soothing-yet-quietly-peppy narrator.  This is followed in bestness only by the gorgeous, peaceful scenery in the background.",1274918400,2,775,5.0078125

I recommend this to anyone who was wants to shape their rump and lengthen their stance. It's a great strenght building exersice. If you have dance in your past or your dancing now it's a great bar exercise she goes over every warm up in every dance classes I'e been to.",1272672000,4,620,4.353448275862069

All I can say is I must have been temporarily insane.  I'm 5'11"" and 30 lbs overweight.  If I couldn't do this stuff when I was 8 and flexible, you can imagine what it is like now.  All I've done so far is watch the whole video and I'm more than a little intimidated.  I suspect I'll have to focus on mastering the first chapter before trying to move onto the next.  Watching without doing was kind of boring but doing might just make me pass out. The moves look simple enough but moving your arms and legs with control while flexing your core isn't as easy as it looks.  This really isn't for ""out of shape"" beginners like me.  Oh well, all I can do is try and hope that I'll eventually be able to do the whole DVD.",1272585600,,862,4.023529411764706
2965886,5,B000WC38BO,"This DVD was a great choice for me; it involves strengthening, conditioning, fine and precise movements, a bit of Pilates for core strengthening, and a casual practice atmosphere. It also has a much better flow and is more fun to do than the NYC Ballet Workout (though these DVDs also have their own strengths as a ballet workout). Even though some may have thought Gulan's DVD workout is not ""traditional"" enough as a ballet workout, I can accept it for what it essentially is: a workout based on ballet movement. First and foremost, it is meant to be an exercise routine, and in this respect it succeeds sufficiently. I did break into a slow sweat (not heart-pounding cardio, but one is definitely burning calories and working the muscles of the legs intensely). It is a wonderful, relatively low-impact workout that makes one feel like one has actually worked out, but not to the extent as to make it impossible to walk a day afterwards. I like that the movements are not abrupt, jarring to the limbs, or involve vigorous momentum for their execution. For my purposes, this DVD workout does indeed serve its purpose. There may not be much of an upper-body workout involved, but most ballet doesn't actually involve a lot of upper-body work; it's all based on creating a lean upper-body over time via graceful poise and ""port-de-bras"". I can do yoga or Pilates for more upper body work, or even weight-lifting if I want (though I'd like to de-bulk my upper-body from years of weight-lifting instead of making my arms bigger). No twisting, pulling, or harsh positioning on the joints is involved, and so would suit those who have lower back or neck problems (though the Pilates core-strengthening in the end might be difficult for those who have weaker abdominal muscles). I'll be using this one to alternate with my other workout DVDs in the future.",1272412800,4,1851,4.80564263322884

This workout gives me the feeling (literally) that I can. I work out at the gym 4-5 times a week and do other workout dvd's so I  am not a stranger to exercise. But this one is tough! She never stops, just keeps going through exercise after exercise working every muscle in your legs thighs butt and hips. Meanwhile, your arms are raised most of the time. It's hard to do all of this. She gives you ways to protect your knees but I haven't done most of the little jumps she has you do toward the end because I'm not convinced my knees won't suffer later. So I skip that part but by then you've been working out for at least 30 min anyway. But I think she did a great job with the dvd and workout. The scenery is pleasant, her voice is pleasant and instructive, and you feel it burning. Have not lost a pound but it has toned me and taken off inches because my pants wouldn't stay up the other day and this is the only thing I'm doing differently after 3 weeks.

I usually favour high impact aerobics but like to do toning as well, yet I haven't found pilates or yoga enjoyable, classes yes, but not dvd's - I find it impossible to stand upside down, whilst concentrating on my breathing and trying to look at a tv screen at the same time!

However, I found this 2 days ago online and ordered it as I trained in ballet and other dancing for around 13 years, but haven't done any ballet for 20 years - well, like one other reviewer says on here, initially I was taken back to childhood memories....then I realised just how much hard work it was!  I could hear my dance teachers words in my head telling me to not have sloppy arms and breathe in, hold my bum in etc so in addition to the small but very intense exercises/movements in the dvd, I was also trying to remember technique.  This isn't necessary but it can help.  Overrall I just wanted to say how shocked I was that having done it for the first time last night, my thighs are aching so much due to the good workout they got.  At the same time it was hugely relaxing and I will be putting this dvd on again tomorrow night.....just as soon as my legs have had a break!

This is definitely a good workout, but I think I like workouts with a lot more movement. Here, you do a lot of repetitions of these ballet movements while standing still. Although you are supposed to be using your core muscles, I just didn't feel satisfied after the workout. There were definitely a couple exercises I had trouble completing, so it's obviously hard work! However, I live in an apartment so I don't like jumping around a lot and bugging my downstairs neighbors, so there were a few exercises I did halfway. Also, she uses a lot of terms that are new to me and I had no idea what they mean, so even after a couple times, I still don't know how to position my arms without watching her first.

If you're looking for intense, high-impact, serious sweat-inducing cardio, this is not for you.  But if you want a lovely, fluid, yet challenging workout that will build lean muscle strength, increase balance, and leave you feeling serene and relaxed,  try this one.

The music is SO boring!  Yet the scenery is nice - most ballet dvds are in the studio, so this was a nice change.  The girl is ok, her voice is either love it or leave it, I think.
Overall, I only spend 9 bucks on it, so i think if i use it twice it's worth it...however for me personally it's not something I could do multiple times a week like some others say.

1. She only speaks in the beginning the rest is voice over, That may be why she apparently cannot count. She'll say lets do 8 of these then she will do 10. For anyone who has done class before it hard when you are mentally counting for 8 then preparing for the next step and she doesn't go into it for another 2 counts.

2. Speaking of class, you will need to have done some ballet classes to understand what she is talking about and proper positioning. Not once does this video show a close up of her feet with proper pointing of the toes or how they should be touching on the floor or the turn out of the knees. Also she only touches on 5th position for jumps at the ending...not even explaining what 5th position is and without a close up of the feet if you don't know this position your guessing.

This is narrated in a very calm, supportive way. The presenter is very zen, vs. the jazzy energetic delivery of many other workouts. Traditional French ballet terms are used for an additional educational component. The presenter is graceful, but with a real butt and thighs, not stick-thin. She does not give a lot of direction on how to point toes or hold arms, which means if you are new to ballet it will take you a number of runs through this DVD before you start to feel graceful or get the most out of the workout. The camera angles are not always the best to understand exactly what her positioning is. Be careful on the deep knee bends with heels together!!

The voiceover explains each movement very well, and the format allows me to keep up, which I appreciate.

I've noticed from pictures that my derriere has lost some perkiness so I bought this to get back in shape- I'm sure in a few days of doing this I'll see results, woo hoo! And I love the Ab section, wonderfully painful. Excellent DVD.

Only (overlookable) flaws- yes, she can crack walnuts with her thighs. I suppose that could be remedied a bit if she actually turned out when doing exercises devant (to the front- ie, her developpes, battements, attitudes, etc). And her arms annoy me, KEEP YOUR ELBOWS UP! I may not have been doing ballet, but I've been doing flamenco instead and it's universal unless intended- droopy arms look BAD.

Some reviewers find her comments annoying, like smile smile even when its amazingly hard--but that is what I've heard several times in ballet class ;)  I've only taken a few classes, more when I was very young.  She is just trying to be encouraging, so we don't get discouraged when we can't do 1/10th of the stretching or whatever she can!  She seems so genuinely happy to be sharing this with you, and doing her best.

Very easy warm up, but does get very, very challenging!  Gives you an idea how far you have to go, and a goal, but you can skip some if you can't make it, of course.  She's like a ballet 'nazi' in the best way, its almost like ballet boot camp, so challenging.

The only thing I wish she added was more on proper posture or form, but I have an idea having taken some ballet classes.  IE keep your shoulders down and your butt tucked under.

I also recommend that you do some extra stretching afterwards (seems easier when your muscles are warm) because after all that work, you don't want them to get tight and short!

Thank you Elise!",1257897600,,1081,4.3283582089552235

2965991,5,B000WC38BO,"I have done some ballet/barre workouts in the past, but being an intermediate-to-advanced level exerciser, I sometimes find these types of workouts to be too easy for me.  I am happy to report that Element Ballet Conditioning felt almost exactly right for my level.  Instructor Elise Gulan begins with an easy, 3-minute warm-up that consists of some very simple stretching moves such as reaching the arms overhead and standing forward bends.  She then asks you to step near your chair to begin the main workout.  Again, she starts off easy with relevs; these feel fairly gentle to begin.  However, Gulan starts to pick up the intensity in the next segment, which includes both demi- and grand-plis using the chair; she also performs a series of plis without the chair.

In series which follows, Gulan incorporates tendu, battement, and developp, performed all on one side and then repeated on the following side.  She then does the same with rond de jambe, knee circles (I don't recall the ballet name for this one), and grand rond de jambe.  The final standing series includes simple leg lifts to the front, side, and back and then attitudes to the front and the back.  Throughout the standing work, Gulan keeps the arms working as well, usually by holding them in a port de bras position.  The standing toning concludes at about the 35-minute mark, and then Gulan leads you through approximately 4 minutes of brief cardio in the form of mini jumps.  These moves are basically little hops--for example, jumping in first position, second position, from first to second, and switching the feet back and forth in fifth position.  Gulan concludes the standing segment with some additional leg lifts while in standing splits, performing a seated twist (half Lord of the fishes pose from yoga) between each side.

At this point, Gulan brings the session to the floor for approximately 5 minutes of intense, Pilates-inspired abs work.  Those familiar with Pilates will recognize moves such as the Pilates roll-up, single straight leg stretch (repeated twice), hip lifts, and single leg stretch.  In fact, because Gulan performs quite a high number of repetitions and offers little instruction, I would only recommend this segment to those who have prior experience with Pilates.  Gulan concludes the workout with approximately 4 minutes of stretching, performed mostly on the floor (butterfly stretch, wide-legged seated forward bend), although she does come to standing to finish, bringing in the total time for this workout at 49 minutes.

Overall, I definitely felt like I got what I wanted from this DVD:  a nice, challenging lower body workout with a short but intense little abs segment to boot.  I don't think that you need to have previous dance or ballet experience to do this workout, but I don't think that it's designed for beginning exercisers, either; also, as mentioned above, I would recommend the abs section only to those with some prior familiarity with Pilates.  Based on these factors, I would recommend this workout, and my final rating is 4.5 stars.",1256428800,10,3066,5.009861932938856

The workout is challenging without frustrating me, and you definitely feel it the next day!  Unlike the NYC ballet workout, I think even a person without a lot of ballet training could do this.  My only wish for this workout would be to have a shorter version of it when I don't have time to dedicate a full hour.  Right now I just do the first 20-30 minutes and shut it off if I need to, but it would have been nice if they had included a true abbreviated version.",1256169600,,606,4.016666666666667

However, I wanted a softer cross-training programme than my high impact aerobics dvds to co-ordinate with a half-marathon training programme. I'd done yoga and pilates and wanted to try something different. I wasn't sure if I'd get enough of a workout with ballet routines and was pleasantly surprised that I did. The low impact worked great for my sore legs and hips plus I loved the stretching. With this dvd, it was quick and easy to get in some stretching and cross-training - I didn't need to change into workout clothes and shoes or use alot props other than a chair. On a busy schedule, it is great. Love the grace of ballet. I'm relatively fit but I've never done ballet and I didn't get all the moves on the first try. However, the routines came readily with practice. The pacing is excellent. The scenery and visuals are calming.  Perfect after a long run day.

The only thing that I didn't like was the music.  It wasn't bad music, but it didn't seem like the steps were being done with the beat of it (and being in ballet before it was hard to ignore the music and do it in time with her).",1254355200,,399,3.888888888888889

I like to split the DVD up, doing a chapter or two 3 days/week, rather than the whole thing at once. This allows me to get used to the movement gradually without becoming sore. I pair a few chapters of this DVD with a walk outside, and I feel great!",1253664000,,493,4.301075268817204
2965998,5,B000WC38BO,"Buying exercise DVDs is always a bit of a gamble for me, so this review will attempt to give a good peek inside before you buy.
If you are looking to tone your legs and abs in a graceful manner, this is a good choice. It will make your legs work and you will definitely break a sweat, especially while doing the jumps.  Likewise, if you are looking to supplement your ballet 1 class, this features pseudo bar work: staples like plies, releves, rond de jambes, and changement jumps. No major floor work or combinations, and no real position correction for port-de-bras or posture, but then again it is a conditioning, not a ""dance the ballet,"" video, so that's not a real issue.
You will likely recognize a few stretches if you take yoga, and the moves from the abs floor work if you take pilates. The upright portion is about 35 minutes and the floorwork about 10. Other pros include beautiful scenery which is pleasant to look at while exercising, and that you really only need about a 6ft radius of space to do this workout. I found the instructor's affirmations to be a little cloyingly cheerful, but perhaps some need the constant motivation (and I suppose saying that a burning quad is just releasing energy can't hurt.)
Overall, a great bargain that I am glad I purchased.",1252540800,4,1278,4.580786026200873

The short cardio burst at the end is fun and entergetic and the stretching is relaxing after this tough workout.  The instructors cues perfectly(hold your abs in, keep your neck long, relax your face and shoulders, etc) and the music fits the DVD.  The scenery is fitting for this DVD also.

I had heard good things about this DVD and even though I'm not ballet trained (I know some dance, but it's definitely not the same) I figured 'Why not?' Ballet dancers always have amazing bodies and at the price I really didn't have much to lose. Not to mention I live with 2 other girls who are trying to lose weight so someone would use it if I didn't.

I DON'T REGRET THIS PURCHASE IN THE SLIGHTEST!!

It's a phenomenal workout. My flatmate and I were in pain for the next two days from doing this even after stretching ourselves out to impossibility. But it broke my plateau and now when I follow the DVD I don't hurt as much after. I probably will never be a limber, flexible prima ballerina, but it has definitely increased my flexibility and muscle tone, not to mention I feel blissed out and relaxed when I'm done. The moves are simple yet challenging, I never felt that what she was doing was something I couldn't attempt or understand. And she doesn't move so fast where I couldn't keep up. I highly reccommend this to those who need a break in their workout routine and still want a challenge!!",1249689600,6,1237,4.373913043478261
2966024,5,B000WC38BO,"I am a newcomer to ballet and bought this DVD to mix up my workout routine.  I'm certainly glad I did - this is a great lower body workout that leaves you feeling energized at the end.  The workout is composed of about 30 minutes with the barre (using a chair), 5 minutes of jumping, 10 minutes of Pilates-like ab work and 5 minutes of stretching. I felt the muscles in my thighs working deeper than I have worked them before.  They were actually shaking throughout the abdominal portion!  Furthermore, holding your arms up nearly continuously is great for sculpting your shoulders.  By the time I finished this DVD, I felt like my posture was a little better!

The instructor was pleasant, but the biggest downside to this workout is the cuing.  Being new to ballet, I can't follow instructions well without seeing the movement.  There are a few exercises where I had to stop, look at the screen, and rewind to the beginning of the movement.  I agree with some reviewers that not being as flexible as the instructor can be a bit frustrating.  However, she mentions multiple times that the intention of the movement is more important than how flexible you are.

Overall, I think this workout is a great change of pace for me.  I do think you need to be mindful of your joints throughout it, but it provides a great challenge otherwise.",1248912000,,1335,4.586497890295359
2966025,5,B000WC38BO,"I've NEVER taken a dance class in my life. I played softball instead of going to ballet or tap classes like my friends. Just recently I became interested in how dancers move, and condition their bodies for performance. I like this DVD because, while I'm not very graceful or as flexible as the instructor, afterward I feel relaxed and stronger. While doing the workouts I feel just the right about of strain without feeling bored or overwhelmed. It's a nice change of routine. I'm glad I came across this DVD.

Don't be intimidated by not being able to raise your legs as high as Elise, or move as graceful as she does. I was at first, but I feel with repeated practice, I'll get just as good! :-)",1248739200,,697,4.4453125

It's been a long time since anyone has had my legs start shaking halfway through a workout. Elise is stunningly beautiful and her soothing voice is encouraging. When she tells you to smile, I knew then for certain that ballerinas truly grin and bear it. This is a DVD that I will be using regularly.

This is relatively low impact, not a whole lot of crazy jumping. There is some jumping however, but no cutting motions that strain knee ligaments. Think one gentle squat to another. If you cannot squat at all, I would not recommend this DVD for you. You will also need a chair to help support with balance.

2966039,4,B000WC38BO,"This DVD workout has only basic play/chapter menu choices. High production (see youtube clips for presentation), this workout is more about fitness/toning/losing weight then it is about dance. Music is light, but it does at least have a fast tempo to keep you from getting bored.
Elise is only in voice over, sounds friendly & encouraging & she even uses a chair which she moves each time she switches sides. All her tips are only basic general terms about how to move, ballet name terms only, and vague to reminders to use your core muscles. She doesn't give any specific, or detailed instructions about how to turn out, avoid injury, etc. Anytime she talks that isn't about the above, she says ad nauseaum how a dancer's body is beautiful, how this workout will streamline your body, make you muscles stronger & help you lose weight. I took off a star for this annoyance, when she could be giving REAL tips.
I enjoy how Elise never has you repeat anything on the same side twice to keep you from getting bored, but since she usually starts with her left (your right if mirroring), she definitely spends more time on that side so the workout isn't even on both sides & you may want to pause to switch a bit to even out.
The workout itself maybe a slow pace, but it isn't for those who workout only rarely or have any lower joint, muscle issues or those who can't balance on one leg at long stretches. If you're looking for true ballet instruction, you won't find it here.
Workout:
2 min. trailer intro
3 min. of very graceful stretching
32 min of standing ballet work (occasional quick stretch here in there)
3 min of soft jumping in 1st, 2nd & switching feet ballet positions
2 min standing split & seated twist yoga pose break
5 min of reclined pilates, (roll ups, A LOT of leg scissors, hip lifts)
4 min cool down (butterfly, seated single wide leg stretch, seated wide leg side & fwd stretch) & ends w/graceful curtsy on both sides.

I felt my legs burning during this & felt my abs working from reminding myself to use my abs (she doesn't remind), and using more wide open arm position w/keeping my elbows up to tone my arms/shoulders so I can feel this everywhere. The next day my quads were a little sore & I felt a nice separation between my pelvis & rib cage, w/the upper torso feeling more floaty on my spine & feeling the muscles of my abs/obliques much more how they really stabilize the body.

It is also broken down into chapters so if you are short on time, you can make the workout shorter.  This is a true ballet class!

Using the chair for balance is easy, once you get the hang of switching it, you can follow easily.  Also, you can always position two chairs so you don't have to switch them.  It is nice to see the beautiful background too!  The music is ok and I really don't hear it after I get into the workout.  I danced for many years and this is truly a great workout!

I am 44 and consider myself an advanced beginner and work out mainly to Ravi and Ana's DVDs, along with Neena and Veena, Kili's Island Girl series, Bernadette Giorgi and Ellen Barrett Studio DVDs. I was able to do the entire workout the first time through; but of course, not nearly as beautifully and gracefully as Elise.

I've found it hard to find ballet workouts that do not require a lot of jumping and space. This is pure ballet conditioning with no dance. Instead, it is a gracefully deep workout of the lower body.

I had ballet experience as a teen, and this reminded me of how incredibly difficult the control aspect of the art is, especially when doing tiny little movements.

I also want to say that I loved Elise's voiceover. He voice and manner of speaking beautifully complimented the pace of the workout. If you are looking for ballet conditioning and strength training, you cannot go wrong with this workout!",1239840000,6,1101,4.723958333333333
2966074,4,B000WC38BO,"I have 18 years of formal ballet training, and haven't done it in over 7 years. I bought this video to get back into shape and because I missed ballet. I gave this DVD four stars instead of 5 because Elise's technique isn't perfect (she does not use proper turn out and her arms are very stiff), but she is still graceful and her body is amazing. This is a good, challenging workout with some very unique additional moves that you will really feel the next few days. However I prefer Melissa Lowe's Ballet workout, which is like a more traditional ballet class and not as long. Also, Melissa's voice does not remind me of a porno soundtrack like Elise's.",1239148800,6,654,4.458333333333333

2966077,5,B000WC38BO,"I exercise 5-6 days a week doing cardio all days and toning the other. I'm not going to lie. I thought this workout would be an easy, breezy workout that I'd get through with my eyes closed. So I popped in the DVD brought a chair over, my water and a towel. Elise came on and I noted she recommended no shoes. Great! I kicked off my sneakers and began the warm-up. Hmmm, thinking not too bad. I'm liking the relaxing scenery and calming music. Next thing you know I'm doing a million different kind of plies, my legs are screaming, I'm taking a break here and there and dripping with sweat all while Elise continues the workout with grace and a permanent smile. WHAT IN THE WORLD! All I can say is this workout is NO joke! The focus is primarily on the core and legs. The muscles in your legs are the largest in your body, therefore it takes way more energy doing a squat or plie versus a bicep curl or stomach crunch. Hence why my heart rate was so high right off the bat. Further you keep your arms in various ballet positions (i.e. rarely down) so you are engaging the upper body, lower body and the core all at once. After about 30 minutes or so of leg work utilizing a chair for balance, you move on to a series of various jumps, again my heart rate climbed. Finally you move to the floor for some ab work and then the cool down. I was absolutely amazed at how fit Elise is. To do this workout without breaking a sweat and keeping a smile on her face fascinated me as I was huffing and puffing and working on my balance and engaging my core and trying to lift my leg just THAT much higher. This is an awesome workout! Definitely think it's something to build into your workout routines atleast three times a week. Excellent DVD!",1238112000,166,1733,4.238670694864048
2966078,4,B000WC38BO,"I'd like to start by just saying that I am at a beginner/intermediate workout level.  I haven't taken ballet since I was 5 or 6, but in an attempt to broaden the variety of workouts I do, I purchased this DVD.  It looked like it would go nicely with my pilates and yoga collection, and it does. HOWEVER - this DVD kicked my butt.

It starts out with some familiar stretching, and then moves into a pretty intense lower body workout combined with some balance exercises that look a lot easier than they really are.  It will definitely take some practice and some time for me to be able to achieve proper form on all exercises.  There is one section of little ballet jumps that really get your heart rate up, and then she finishes off with some pilates-style movements.

My legs are burning today. It definitely does its job!  But please don't buy this as a beginner expecting to ease yourself into exercise.  This routine is very challenging, and you might not be able to get through the whole thing your first time through.  But eventually you will.

2966099,3,B000WC38BO,"I bought both this DVD and the New York City Ballet complete workouts.  This DVD provides a strenuous and challenging workout, however I liked the NYC ballet DVDS better.  I have done years of yoga and I would say I have a moderate fitness level, however doing this DVD I found a lot of the sections too difficult, particularly the abs section.

My concern is that those who know very little ballet technique may injure themselves as the DVD does not provide much instruction on turning out from the hips not the knees (to protect the knees), and also on the importance of engaging the core muscles to prevent injuring the lower back in the abs section.

It is only my personal view, but I did not like the instructor.  This could be due to cultural differences.  I did not take kindly to hearing a sugary sweet voice telling me to smile while going through some of the more gruelling exercises on the DVD!  However I acknowledge that others may not have a problem with this.

Overall, I recommend this DVD if you are looking for a very intense ballet style workout and perhaps have some prior experience in ballet or pilates.  However, if you want to feel like a dancer and to enjoy the feeling of your body moving through space then I would recommend the NYC ballet workouts.",1237680000,35,1277,4.517391304347826

The cueing is easy to follow and creates an extremely smooth workout experience on the first try, even if you don't have a background in ballet (which I don't). The setting is peaceful and calm.

I wanted something that emphasized stretching and strength without the hype for my morning workout...afternoons I like to jog, swim or work with free weights but wanted something more calming to start the day with...but I'm personally ""burned out"" on Yoga Yoga Yoga. This is the perfect solution! I have zero ballet training so cannot begin to claim that my form is correct however, the movements really challenge...as another reviewer mentioned...within the first five minutes you are feeling the heat build up. Great stretching that is perfect for this middle aged body - emphasizes those areas that tend to become problematic as one grows older...especially if you excercise or lift weights and have a problem retaining flexiblity.

However, don't be fooled - this is one tough workout! I've only had it a week but must confess that I'm still unable to get through the entire workout without stopping for a quick break (thank goodness for that pause button!). It leaves you feeling relaxed and refreshed - not utterly exhausted and hyper - which is exactly what I was searching for on a morning routine. Gets the blood pumping, eliminates that groggy feeling and leaves you invigorated.

Those with formal ballet training may find issues-but for those searching for a great stretching/strength workout without the hype and hysteria of bouncing bodies across the screen or someone just looking for an alternative to Yoga this is an excellent routine.",1236211200,6,1562,5.073929961089494

This is very lower body focused (let's be honest, it IS ballet) and you feel the burn within the first five minutes. She is a very great instructor and has cuing that is very helpful.

Whenever I finish this video, I feel so strong and elegant. Although during the video, I don't really know what to do with my hands or the correct position of them, but I just try my best to mimic the trainer.

I think another thing that I like best about the video is how she's so encouraging. She seems as though you could be able to talk to her and she'd be down to earth. I know there are a lot of people that sometimes feel discouraged when a trainer comes off too tough in videos, and she gives off a great and encouraging vibe.

If you have 50 minutes and would like to feel it pretty much everywhere, this is the video for you.

So saying that that made it easier for me would be a stretch. What I liked was that the routine seems as though it is easy so you think okay I can try this and then before you know it you are sweating. There is a lot of leg work and that means that it involves using a lot of large muscle groups so it's got to get your heart rate up.

I cried the first time because it was memory lane for me. Elise takes you through the basics of ballet. Don't think this is she she foofoo workout. This is hard core kick your butt workout. You will sweat. I have had the DVD for 3 weeks now and I still haven't made it through the entire workout yet, but I will and I have already seen results. My legs, feet and ankles look wonderful, strong not body builder strong, lean, toned well shaped. My posture has improved greatly. I do this workout 3-4 times a week. Each time I go a little bit further. I love it it's a must have. Even people who have never danced before can do this, BUT pace yourself. It takes time. I trained for years and I still needed to pace myself as I'm starting back after 13 year hiatus. Elise did a wonderful job. By far my favorite workout DVD ever. I actually look forward to ballet dancing again. Total body workout. I walk in addition to this and I sleep better, feel better and my body is changing. My BFF 10 year old daughter said to me yesterday ""you look smaller in you face"". Needless to say I threw in an extra session yesterday, I haven't noticed my face. Such a self esteem booster for me.

The scenery on this DVD is lovely and tranquil, makes you want to exercise. Elise's voice is calming and soothing, her dictation is clear, easy to understand and follow. You need only a chair for balance and barefoot is best. Can it get any better??? Get this DVD and try it. If you actually hate it and I can't see anyone not liking it donate it to the public library.

I consider this a success, as I often feel that home videos aren't challenging enough.  This instructor does some tough strength moves (like modified ballet barre moves in a squat position held for a longgggg time).  Ye-ouch!  If I am able to stick with it I would expect to see some firming up.

My biggest complaint is that the pace of the steps is incredibly slow.  As someone who has taken lessons before I was bored and had to do everything at ""double time"" speed.  While it was pleasant enough, it was not as enjoyable as a a standard beginner ballet class, probably because it goes so slow.  Also, the instructor kept saying over and over how this will lead to ""a dancer's body"" in a new age-style voice over.  I found this a little irritating.  I'd rather enjoy the music and just be cued to what's next than hear about the benefits that I may or may not see one day.

It is hard to keep doing them until the very last one.  That's a good workout to me.

Towards the end, you will do jumps without using the chair, plus some other standing exercises.  I cannot stand in the same place on these jumps the way that Elise does, but it still gives me a great cardio workout.

Before the cool down, there are exercises on the floor that will work your legs and abs.  In this part, you can build up to where you don't use your arms to catch your legs and that uses your ab muscles more.

I don't know much about ballet, in fact, I have never been to a ballet class.  Although, it is gorgeous to watch and I would love to have the dancer's physique.  This workout will definitely improve your shape if you continue to do it.",1225238400,2,1044,4.292307692307692
2966166,2,B000WC38BO,"I'm trying to find a good DVD to exercise, and I thought I'd try ballet - hey, who doesn't want to be more graceful, lean, and strong?  All the other DVDs I saw reviewed on Amazon seemed to be for an existing dancer (which I'm not!) to refine technique, or a mix of ballet-Pilates or ballet-yoga.

So you know who's doing this review - I'm very tall, 235 lbs, 30 years, good athletic background, can run several miles at a go, but not what I'd call in great shape.  I am certainly NOT one of those women whose reviews I read here on Amazon who complain that an exercise video spends TOO MUCH time demonstrating moves, and gives too much of a break between moves.  Nope!  I need things simple and paced so that I can actually do it.  So with that in mind, here's my review of Elise Gulan's Ballet Conditioning:

Pros:
1) Gorgeous Pacific background (someone's beautiful house)
2) Gulan has an amazing figure and is very graceful - gives me something to which to aspire, and trying to imitate her grace took my mind off the difficulty of what I was doing - a tiny bit at least.
3) I found the moves very difficult, and I was working hard let me tell you!
4) For a complete ballet newbie, I guess there was a good element of introduction to ballet moves and terms.

Cons:
1) I was distracted by the fact that she kept on referring to long, lean dancer's muscles - but she's a beast.  Great figure, yes, very graceful movements, yes - but slender and delicate no.  Her thighs could not only crack walnuts - but could crack a walnut DESK! With a little self-tan and a tiny bikini, she could compete for body-building, I'm actually serious here.
2) I have to say this - since I volunteered at a fire station I probably (unfortunately) know more about soft-core pron than most women... I am willing to swear blind that the production company mixing the music does mostly soft-core pron.  It was so disconcerting, and distracting - in the first section there was even the classic 70s pron ""bow-wow"" every now and then.  With that ocean background, contact-paper ""wood"" platform, and fake cultured voiceover - it really was set up like soft-core pron.
3) Gulan's voiceover is freakin' annoying.  I know she's trying to sound soft, musical, warm, and classy - but it sounds unnatural and forced.  And she has a VERY weird, distracting habit of ""warming"" nearly every line (the only explanation I could find for the weirdness), so that it sounds like she's making a dirty innuendo; my mental image is of her constantly wiggling her eyebrows and winking creepily.  What the heck??  This really adds to the creepy soft-core pron feeling of this video.
4) As to the actual exercise - the segment was too long, and impossible for anyone other than a dedicated gym-rat or ballerina to follow.  It was very discouraging to me.  She just never stops, and never gives you even a second's rest, and rather than switching muscles just sticks with the same ones, nonstop.  Yes I know I have a remote, but I think a good choreographer builds exercise programs in segments, and switches muscle groups.
5) Her instructions tend to give important info a little too late to be helpful - not until the very end of the last leg of moves where she's casually lifting her leg to her ears (ok, I'm exaggerating) does she mention that it doesn't matter if you only lift it an inch, practice will increase flexibility, yada yada.  My pulled groin would have appreciated that little tidbit a bit earlier!  :)

My verdict:
If you really want to do ballet conditioning, and are willing to kill yourself every day until you can actually follow her moves, go for it.  If you want to have a reasonably paced, uplifting workout session, go elsewhere.  You'll end up discouraged and feeling inadequate, instead of proud of your hard work.  And maybe a little creeped out and dirty.

Whereas I've put in Tracey Mallett every day, this is only the second time I've put in this DVD... and probably not too many more times.  Ebay here I come!

*Edits from 4 years later: 1) From the comments, there was confusion - ""pron"" is my attempt to avoid auto spam sweepers. You know what I'm saying. :) And I'm not saying that this video is inappropriate, just that it has stylistic elements commonly found in softcore. 2) I just discovered that Sparkpeople.com has free sign-up and free segments of popular fitness videos, including ""Xtend Barre: Lean and Chiseled"" (which seems like what I was looking for in this video), Bollywood, Pilates, etc. I have no affiliation with Sparkpeople, except as a loyal user of their website.  3) Tracey Mallett still gets put into my DVD player on a regular basis... so I guess I should go do a review of that video too!",1223683200,74,4703,4.572109654350418

Set against a beautiful backdrop and accompanied with serene music, I can totally feel my whole body transforming every time I do it. I have especially noticed a difference in my legs and arms after 14 days. I actually look forward to doing this DVD 3-4 times a week.

I have been doing it every other day for almost 2 weeks and can already see more definition in my legs!  You just feel BETTER after this DVD.  I plan to continue until I can master the moves as well as the instructor (trust me, some of it is tough). I feel like I REALLY get a good workout in.  Highly recommended!",1221350400,4,467,4.122222222222222
2966191,5,B000WC38BO,"This DVD is a great cross-training regime for me as a runner. This video provides an overall workout, focusing on flexibility, strength and balance. The instructor is encouraging in a relaxed manner, which I need to get through the grande plies series that sets my thighs on fire. That's not to mention the ab chapter that puts me to shame. Besides the great workout, another benefit of this DVD is that you can sweat while looking (or at least trying to look) graceful!

Bonus for boaters: Many of the exercises are adaptable to small spaces. I live and travel on my 35-foot sailboat. Staying fit onboard is always a challenge. I can perform many of the exercises both inside the boat and topside.

Being quite inflexible, I wish the DVD included additional warm-up stretches or an extras chapter with stretches to better prepare me for the leg lifts to follow. That aside, I recommend this DVD for people looking to increase strength, agility, balance and muscle tone.",1221004800,6,970,4.802395209580839

I got halfway into the exercises and my thighs were screaming at me.  It does go a little fast for those that aren't already ballet trained but the way the narrator leads you through each exercise is nice.  I highly recommend this dvd for anyone who wants to change up their routine.,1219881600,2,441,4.27710843373494
2966193,5,B000WC38BO,"This is hands down the BEST ballet DVD I've ever tried.  I've never taken a single ballet class in my life, so it was perfect for my status as a beginner.  The next day I could really feel all of the muscles that I'd worked.  When I started the DVD I didn't think I'd end up getting much of a work out/calorie burn, but within 10 minutes I was sweating.  The great part is, you don't have to do the moves extremely fast or learn tricky combinations.  I STRONGLY reccommend this DVD for persons of any age who have ever wanted to try ballet, and for those who are looking for a very unique workout.",1219795200,3,597,4.156521739130435

2966195,5,B000WC38BO,"Way more difficult than I thought it would be. Definately works the whole body! Pro dancers don't just love dance, they WORK HARD for it. With these exercises, you build strength & length in the muscles by focusing on balance, control & positioning. I would recommend this to almost any woman. You must remember to go at your own pace. You WILL NOT be able to lift as high as the instructor at first, but don't over do because you will improve & see results FAST! There are no alternate movements demonstrated, don't worry, you don't need them, just only stretch or lift as much as you can. In my opinion, as you progress through this with practice, you will appreciate the pace of transitioning from exercise to exercise & be better able to maintain your focus without interruption. It also does not allow you to work in modified positions forever making excuses for yourself not to try harder. I absolutely want to work up to the level of flexibility & control she has. I feel great after doing this routine. Revitilized, refreshed, lengthened, & with much MORE energy. The price is a great value, so worth it. Buy it. You won't regret it.

Works as advertised, is ballet inspired & also focuses on control & positioning. I love the tiny extremely effective movements of Callanetics. Both of these videos do not terrorize your back & joints but really, let me stress really, work the hard to fix lower body. Both make doing lunges & 500 crunches seem unworthy of my time. This is a terrific way to spend an hour on yourself releasing stress at the end of the day or revving up in the morning. People will notice you are making changes. Don't bulk up, strengthen & lengthen. Good Luck!!! :)",1219190400,17,1996,5.051515151515152

You get a very good workout, and after doing this video, I felt it in my muscles!  I'm not a hard-core exerciser and am still working on getting in shape, and have many different exercise videos.  With some of the exercise videos that I own, after exercising with the video, I don't feel like I've done much.  Not so with this video.  There is a heavy emphasis on the lower body; most of the ballet workout concentrates on the legs and buns.  The abs part of the workout is more like pilates; gentle, but challenging .  There is also a portion of the video where you do ballet jumps to get the cardio going.  The workout is challenging enough for more advanced exercisers, but also can be used by beginners.  I know this is one exercise video that I'll be using over and over!",1219104000,2,880,4.343558282208589

The view in the background is awesome, and the instructor is narrating the video instead of trying to instruct while she's doing the exercises herself.  I think this probably makes it more relaxing.  She's not wearing the little black ballet get-up on the cover, just a pink yoga bra and grey leggings.  My thighs BURNED during this workout!",1218672000,,426,4.613333333333333

I work out 1-2 hours a day and was looking for something, . . just different.  I've been dissapointed by the other ballet DVD's out there.  If you used to dance you'll know what I mean.  A REAL ballet class consists of training at the bar, jumping, and stretching and yes, PLIES, lots of them.  This DVD delivers all elements and is filmed quite beautifully.  It caters to the beginner but isn't boring for intermediate to advanced excersizers.  I only wish that there were more jumping exercises and I don't really like the narration.  It borders on the verge of being really annoying.  Would have like to hear actual ballet music too.  I really hope that they come up with another volume to this workout though, mabe more advanced, because I just love it.",1218240000,6,892,4.438271604938271

This is an extremely effective dvd that will give you results in a very short period.",1217116800,4,422,4.454545454545454
2966214,5,B000WC38BO,"After reading all the reviews I too decided to purchase this video. I like this video for so many of the reasons stated here previously. I like the voice-over aspect, outdoor scenery, and contrary to some, I like the music as it has the right beat to match the movements.

The instructor is very postive in a calm and pleasant way, (no screaming or condesending tone). The video breaks down with; warm-up moves, lots of well-paced challenging leg work, ballet jumps, abs (with legs) and final stretching.(sometimes, when I'm short on time or energy I do the first part alone). I have very limited ballet experience, but found I could do all of the movements, (if not very well at first). I've found if you can do this in front of a mirror to check your alignment and posture, you will always be challenged! The best part for me has been the pace of the program, it allows me to break a sweat without feeling like I'm going to have a heart attack -- and I've seen more results, more quickly with this video than with other high-energy workout videos!

Very well done. I hope Element decides to do another ballet workout with Elise!",1216944000,9,1130,4.534313725490196
2966215,5,B000WC38BO,"This is an excellent workout video if your familiar with ballet or just starting out.  Elise Gulan is the perfect coach for her gentle motivating voice and calming fluent movement.  As someone who used to do ballet, this was a great video to ease back into it.  Gulan starts out smoothly and slowly moves into a vigorous workout focusing on abs, toning of thighs, and cardio by series of jumps. (You will break a sweat!) The best part is, all you need is a chair for these workouts!  There is no barre required!  You will feel immediate results from this video, and want to do it again and again!",1216512000,5,596,4.431192660550459

However, I enjoyed this DVD as a wonderful departure from the other high-impact exercise videos out there.  When I finish, I am exhausted and sweaty, but feel a wonderful burn in my arms and legs.  I recommend this for anyone who wants a ballet-type workout who is not so concerned with the technical aspects.",1216080000,12,570,4.4423076923076925

I have to take breaks to get through it, but I know it will give me leaner and stronger legs if I keep doing it. It makes your thighs burn if you aren't used to doing lots of toning or pilates. This is good if you want to get into your skinny jeans and are looking for a routine that's a little less typical gym routine and has a little more dancer/yoga flair.",1215734400,5,430,4.192771084337349

After a few weeks of doing ""nothing,"" I popped this DVD in and got right to it.  I found it to be extremely beneficial in a conditioning sense, but it is not what you would want if you are training in ballet.  I have a problem when technique isn't taught perfectly, or executed correctly.  This DVD is considered a ""conditioning"" work-out---and that's exactly what it is.

2966220,1,B000WC38BO,"This is not a conditioning class; it's simply a beginning ballet class taught by a very average ballet dancer.  I wouldn't even recommend it to a beginner ballet student because you're liable to pick up some bad habits like sticking out your thumbs, and not working through your feet, both of which the teacher does routinely.  And she doesn't have any business talking about how to develop the long, lean look of a dancer -- which she does ad nauseum -- since that's not the type of body she has.  She has a nice figure, but it's definitely not a ballet dancer's body.  If she has primarily been using dance as her means of exercise (as she implies) then she's been using her quadriceps to lift her legs into developpe, which is a definite no-no.  If she comes out with an actual conditioning DVD, that might be good, but this one has no redeeming value to me.",1214784000,74,861,4.45859872611465

I would caution people with injuries (especially in the knees as she really likes to have you do a lot of plies---including grand-plie which is a pretty big bend in the knees) to steer away from the this video.  It is probably not best for a total beginner unless you feel comfortable modifying your exercises to your own abilities and if you do not mind that you might not yet be able to perform the exercises to the level of the woman on the screen.  The exercises are actually reasonably easy to modify (do demi plies instead of grand-plies, put the hands on the hips is you get tired from keeping them in second position forever, only lift the leg to 30 or 45 degrees instead of 90 in grand battements etc).  If you have never had any dance training (I have only had 6 months of a beginning adult classes) then I would probably think that the New York City Ballet Workout 1 is better for introducing some of the basic ballet steps while still getting a workout.  Incorporate this into your workout routine and I do not know how you would not get results.  And one more thing---you do not need to be flexible to do the workout as other reviewers have suggested---I had to work for ages to even touch my toes and I found this workout to be possible, with modification of course.",1214092800,37,1380,4.37109375

This is a challenging workout!  I know a few people were disappointed that it wasn't balletic enough, but I don't think it was meant to be.  This video is a conditioning workout.  I haven't made it through the whole video.  I piece them out: core strength and quads one day, stretching and glutes the next (with some yoga mixed in).  Frankly after the first few minutes of keeping my legs raised and repeating leg movements, I was sweating from holding certain positions.  You do work your arms.  Elise has you raising your arms above your head or out to your side and you keep them there for the duration of the exercise.  The core strength uses pilates and it left my abs burning for hours.
This a wonderful video to add to my collection.  Graceful instructor.  Gorgeous scenery.  And a workout that  leaves me feeling strong and supple.",1212537600,12,988,4.630057803468208

I noticed another reviewer wrote that if you don't have much flexibility this video is very bad for you. I can't disagree more. She mentions in the video, several times, that do what feels challenging to you! You are not going to be able to move as advanced as she does for a while. That's the beauty of this video. You can see how everytime you do the workout, you'll get that much more out of it. Just do the workout so that you can feel the muscles work. The flexibility will come with time. I'm sure before I know it, I'll be able to lift my leg much higher than 1/3 of the way up (although sometimes is just 1/4 of the way)!

Beware if you are exercising in a room with fragile items,  as there is a section of constant jumping.

Elise is an excellent teacher, very gentle and affirming. The workout is an hour long, so make sure you have enough time to complete it. You do need plenty of space to do all the moves, which made things a little difficult in my tiny apartment. For those of us who aren't quite up to the challenge, it is easy enough to skip the last few reps of some of the exercises (the plie jumps in particular), and you still get a good workout.

The instructor/narrator gives step by step instruction in plain English as well as giving the precise name for the move as it would be called in a studio. The fact that shes uses a chair and switches from side to side is helpful. It isn't too fast paced, it's very motivating and over all I would love to do it over and over, if my muscles would stop failing.",1210464000,7,654,4.504201680672269

After a few watches,I was able to turn the volume down, put on my own music and still follow along.  If you want a good ballet conditioning DVD, this is it.  Also, the instruction is in voice-over, which is nice, especially if you do turn the volume down.  That way her mouth isn't constantly moving with no sound.",1210204800,4,610,4.4818181818181815

2966278,4,B000WC38BO,"I am a fitness instructor, always looking for good workout videos to keep it fresh and work different muscles.  I also do a lot of jumping around and cardio in my classes and gym workouts, as well as resistance training with bands and weights, so I thought ballet moves would add a different dimension.  I found this video to be great for muscle toning and especially lengthening, which is an important component to any exercise program for women in particular.  It is just long enough and varied enough that you feel your whole body working, but without any impact.  There is a short section of jumps, so if you have bad knees you may want to modify this or skip the section. I especially like that the instructor gives cues as a voice-over instead of taking time away from performing the moves to tell you how to position your body correctly.  If you are looking for a weight loss routine, this won't be the best choice, but for improving posture (which can make you look like you've lost up to 10 pounds!) and sculpting dancer-like muscle without the bulk, this is a good choice, especially for the price!",1207958400,13,1108,4.575757575757576
2966279,5,B000WC38BO,"As someone lacking the time and determination to drive to the gym several times a week, finding a great DVD for home exercise seemed like the only way I would get some activity in my day.  I've only taken a semester of basic ballet in college, but this DVD has proven to be both accessible and really challenging, and it has enough variety to keep me from getting bored.  I've been doing a few sections 3-4 times a week for three weeks (simply can't DO the whole DVD at one time yet!), and while I haven't lost any pounds, I have already toned inches off my body, and my clothes sure fit better!

The zen setting of the DVD is relaxing, and Elise's AMAZING physique is inspiring rather than distracting.  I will say that my basic knowledge of the moves and training in keeping my toes pointed and back tall all the time probably helps, but this is really an easy routine to get into, and the quick results are inspiration to keep going.",1207872000,12,936,4.362068965517241
2966280,5,B000WC38BO,"I love the voice and style of the girl on the video. Some exercises such as deep plies not good for the average older adult or anyone with bad knees. The exercises are great provided that you don't strain trying to achieve the amazing range of motion that the dancer has. I would like to see some of the exercises repeated in parallel. Most everything is in turnout. Overall, you will love the video if you like a challenge. It is as hard as you make it. The background is gorgeous too.",1207526400,5,486,4.293478260869565

The first few times you workout with this DVD, your legs will be trembling with fatigue and the sweat will be pouring down your face!  From the very first, you can feel your muscles lengthening and strengthening, and you feel so graceful and powerful when you're done.  Do it a few times a week, and you'll very quickly notice a difference in your body and overall health.  I've never been flexible, but this workout allows you to stat at your own level and really build on your ability; I know that I am already stronger and more flexible in just a few weeks of starting this routine.  I've tried many other ballet workout CDs, and none of them came close to the quality of this one.  As other reviewers have noted, the music is not very stimulating . . . but it grows on you after a while and the quality of the workout far outweighs this.  Once you've got most of the moves down, you can just pop in a Swan Lake CD over the muted workout, and you've got the best of both worlds!",1207440000,8,1150,4.243119266055046

After the workout, it's only 50 minutes you will feel like you've been excersising for 2 hours, my legs actually were trembling after the first part.
The music should have been classical, it's a little disturbing performing classical ballet moves without the music.
Other than the music, you will se results inmediatly specially in your legs.",1207353600,2,397,5.123076923076923

I wanted something that would help my core strength and give me some more stretching. Not too much stretching in this one, but I was surprised at how challenging the moves were (I've never been a dancer). At 38, I can use this...and I would do this DVD as often as I could to get a physique like this lady.

My only recommendation for this is a use of a yoga mat for the ab work. I don't know how her spine doesn't bother her on that floor she's using, but once I used my mat all was well.",1207180800,8,609,3.8333333333333335

I had no idea that the workout was going to be this good.  This video provides an amazing full body workout.  It is easy to do and uses your own body weight to tone and condition.  It challenges your endurance and strength.  I have been using this video to workout for about a week and a half and my body is already toning up. I haven't even made it through the whole video once yet.  I have done dance videos before but none with the challenges and results that this video provides.  I bought another ballet video along with this one (because it was recommended as a good addition to this video) that was $20 more expensive, and it absolutely sucks compared to this one.

Her voiceover was irritating to me at first, but she grew on me after a while because the workout is quality. The setting is lovely outside; you can even see a bug land on her shoulder in one frame.

My only complaint was the music. Musicality is arguable the most important aspect of ballet.  The elevator music was a drag, and to be a true ballet workout, there should have been classical music or at least something besides elevator music. The instructor is pleasant, but I was surprised to see that she had been a professional ballet dancer due to her lack of technique in certain areas.",1205452800,12,543,4.56701030927835

Everything is performed in a classic ballet barre routine (with a chair instead of a barre) and is well explained even for a beginner.

Although the routine was demanding, the small movements, softness, grace, and location makes it feel like a meditation - relaxing, soothing, calming, quietly energising. This is not a high-energy, in-your-face type of workout, and I don't get the post-exercise rush and subsequent crash that I get from many aerobics-type of workouts. I feel good all day. Ms Gulan is amazing but she doesn't make you feel poorly about yourself if you can't do what she does. I feel that I can opt out of some of the sequences to have a breather or rest tiring muscles when I need to and still feel good about myself. The voiceover is extremely encouraging and respectful. I haven't had any dance training but it is easy to see and follow the routine even if you can't quite do the exercises to their full extent. There are lots of challenges in the routine to keep me interested for quite a long tme. Highly recommended.",1202256000,12,1060,4.67379679144385

I wanted a good workout that incorporated ballet movements from classes I have taken. This does it! It's 51 minutes long, begins with some stretching, a plie series, tendus (sp?), a series of jumps to increase your heart rate and a section of abdominal workouts. After the stretches, she does several plie series that left my thigh muscles quivering the first time. I felt like I had lost an inch off my legs & waist after the first time. The instructions are clear and easy to follow. She does each side, using a chair for balance and with the arms incorporated, they become sculpted also. Each time I do the workout, I find something new to improve upon in each movement. My flexibility improves each time and that allows me to perform each movement more gracefully.

I am a busy girl and I didn't realize I needed that much time devoted to the workout. Not a big deal for most people though. I plan on tailoring the workout for a shorter period and doing it more frequently during the week. I also do pilates during the week which helps during the ballet exercises.

It's going to become much more than that because it is that good.

>The scenery is wonderful as other reviewers have said.

>The use of a chair and not a barre - when she switches to the other side to work the other leg, she physically moves the chair to the other side. In other ballet videos where they've used a barre, usually I have to pause the tape because I can't quite get my chair moved around fast enough to start working the other side (they just turn around and start doing the exercises; if I turn around I'm no longer facing the TV :-)).

>The fact that the voice cueing is done as a voice over, instead of by the person doing the exercises, this makes it VERY easy to follow

>Recognition all along the way that not everyone is as flexible - and continuous encouragement that with time flexibility will come

Overall, it is an excellent dvd and I'm glad I bought it.",1201305600,137,1190,4.192982456140351

It's an intense lower body workout with ballet inspired moves.  Because you work deep into muscles, it's designed to help you get that long lean body look that ballet dancers have.  Elise is a good instructor with great cuing so you know what to do next at all times.  I love the outdoor setting (instead of the inside of a studio for a change); it's great to do a workout that has been done outside to make you feel like it's Summer all year round and motivate you that little bit more.

Not to say you have to be an experienced dancer to do this workout, as the barre workout is basic to ballet and easy to pick up...even for beginners.  I haven't done any ballet in years and after the end of the workout my legs were shaking a bit. That definitely showed me I was using leg and arm muscles I hadn't worked in a while. This is such a graceful workout and you really feel like you are toning your whole body! I can't wait to do it again. I also have back and neck problems from a past injury and this low impact workout is great for that. You can do the barre work stabilized by holding onto the back of a chair and there is only one short section that has impact at all to the body (where you do a short set of ballet jumps). I love that this workout is easy on the body, but at the same time you can really tell it is working. The abs section was great too...I will have to do this workout a few more times before I can make it through the abs at the advanced level.

Its about time that an affordable true ballet barre workout came out that actually uses a barre to its fullest potential.  I have a ballet barre and was pleasantly surprised that throughout the workout it was used.  I can't say that about all ballet workouts.  Anyway this is an invigorating ballet workout which will have you sweating by the end.  Elise works one side first then works the other side.  All exercises start slowly then progress to a faster speed.  Very thorough workout at the end you will focus on abs which is pilates inspired.  Elise is a pleasant instructor with beautiful form.  The scenery is breathtaking which is an added plus.  The music was good although true ballet purist will insist on classical music which this workout had not.  The price was such a deal.  I say this because most ballet and callanetic type workouts start at $30.  This was an affordable, well produced, with added gorgeous scenery workout that is a true keeper.

I know that this workout will contribute to toning and slimming my legs, which is an area I personally would like to improve, as well as the rest of my body. The ab section incorporates many pilates type exercises to tone and tighten the midsection. Even though I regularily do pilates, I really felt my abs more than I expected.

I probably did when I first bought it, but for some reason it has been sitting on a bookshelf since 2010. Fitness background: I used to run and do weights regularly, but for the past 1-2 years I've gotten really lazy and all my muscle tone is gone; I'm totally out of shape. I want to ease back into working out so I put this dvd in last night. My legs were shaking afterwards and I'm sore almost all over today. I definitely feel it most in my legs, hips, and butt - but also my back and shoulders. I was surprised that my standing leg got really fatigued while my other leg was doing the moves. It sounds impossible after just one work-out, but I swear I feel tighter and my posture is better. I'm totally motivated to use this at least 3 times a week. The only negative thing I can say about it is that I felt totally ungraceful and uncoordinated while I was doing it.",1487030400,4,944,4.135869565217392

She doesn't do arm exercises as ballet dancers develop their arm muscles due to holding their arms out. however, professional dancers do hours of exercises with arms out each day, so I think you need to add a some upper body exercises.",1476576000,,483,4.616279069767442

Your legs will burn after this but if you want to work on toning up your legs this is great for it!  I was very sore the next day.  There are some jumps to get in your cardio and get your heart pumping if the intense leg work didn't already.

Of course, most who purchase just want the exercise and conditioning.  Here you have it in an hour that has to work if applied ... instructions are clear, tone is gentle and encouraging.  This dvd would be worth the money for posture conditioning alone, but give it a week of two or three sensible sessions, and the results will be felt and noticeable, but not painful.

This is a ballet-BASED workout, not ballet. If you're looking for a general workout, this may be a good fit for you. If you're looking for ballet class conditioning, this is not it.

I thought a previous reviewer was very harsh until I got 10 minutes into the video and realized that reviewe was absolutely correct. I kept hearing my college ballet instructor in my head correcting how she was doing things. I'm a complete novice, but I knew that the instructor in the video did not have balletic form. She is a former ballerina soloist and she may use a different form when practicing ballet, but the form she is using in the video is not good ballet form.

The more I got into the workout, I could feel that the routine was focusing on the large muscle groups in my legs.

That's not bad for a workout, but this is not true ballet conditioning.

If you're looking for a true ballet class, check out Victor Kabaniaev's ""Ballet Class"". It has a trailer you can preview, and you can rent the video on Amazon Prime to see if it's what you're looking for.

There aren't any good adult classes near me and I wanted a ballet style work out, so when I ran across this I thought it would be worth a try. I had also taken Barre Amped live group classes thinking they would be a dance based workout, however I found the instructor criticizing my technique the whole time saying I was ""doing it too much like dance"" so I got frustrated and didn't continue going. This DVD was exactly what I wanted, actual dance moves and dance terminology with a workout!  It's much harder than anticipated, without being impossible, but I certainly realized I am not in the same shape I was as a teen. I only made it through 38 minutes of the workout today but when I looked in the mirror I could already see sculpting in my abs! 51 minutes is a little longer than I wanted but after seeing results in just 3/4 of a workout, I am SO excited to continue and it is definitely worth getting up a little earlier every day.",1420588800,2,1034,4.1959798994974875

3199061,5,B000WC38BO,"I found this to be a challenging, yet accessible exercise video. A nice one to have in my dvd rotation. It focuses on strength and flexibility, especially in the lower body.",1420329600,2,173,4.612903225806452
3199101,1,B000WC38BO,"Let me preface this review by saying that my intention is not to disparage Ms. Gulan. However, some of what I may say could possibly be construed as personal. Since Ms. Gulan herself is presenting this workout and has provided her resume and personal abilities as an endorsement, I feel that she should be held personally accountable for any misinformation or inaccuracy.

I had this DVD on my wish list along with a couple others because I was looking for workouts that would either enhance my dance training or at the very least, not INTERFERE with my training. I am a performing artist and yoga instructor who has studied dance for the past eight years in a cross-discipline capacity, all while in close consultation with a physical therapist. There is no 'workout' out there that can give you a dancer's body unless it is the actual dance practice itself. Dancing is training specific, and the barre exercises that ballet dancers do for hours and years, along with a careful (and admittedly for some, sometimes unhealthy) diet helps to keep body fat percentage low. Although 'core' is strengthened, you'll see 'six-packs' only through specific targeting outside of dance class in most cases, and in other cases because the dancer is young or genetically pre-disposed to that kind of muscle definition. Essentially, what happens at a basic physiological level is that a ballet dancer learns by doing to train the body to eschew the natural stabilizers, and highly develop many of the lesser-used smaller muscles of the body for what they do. This enables them to create a sense of effortless and light movement. Anyway, enough tech talk...

Unfortunately, Ms. Gulan is NOT a good example of this. Her thighs and buttocks are very over-developed, which is an indicator that she is using her large muscle groups to lift her leg or plie--exactly the OPPOSITE of what a dancer should do. My daughter, a pre-professional dancer herself, watched the video with me and was appalled that Ms. Gulan was performing the exercises with such poor, incorrect technique. She was sickling her ankles every time she went into releve, and couldn't hold it. Her turnout was very poor, and would disappear for many of the exercises. Her hands were one of the WORST parts, as she had them contorted into claws that made us both cringe. Her arms dropped at the elbow, and none of her leg extensions had or could maintain much height. Why is all of this a problem? Because her body is 'cheating'. In other words, she is using whatever muscles she can to mimic the motions of a dancer, rather than using the muscles a dancer would use. She is apparently so out of dancer condition that she is unable to correctly execute the most basic of dancer exercises. Her flexibility was also very poor.

Will you lose weight doing her video? Probably. You'll be using large muscle groups, mainly the glutes and the larger top part of the quads, so therefore will naturally burn more calories, especially since most of the exercises center around squats (or what she called plies).

Will you get the 'slender body' of a dancer, 'strong and lean with lovely proportion and gorgeous body lines,' as promised on the back of the video? No. You can't. Even if you are a dancer, and already have trained your body to use the correct muscles, the heavy focus on exercises that naturally use the larger muscle groups will work against what you are trying to achieve. Plus, if you ARE a trained ballet dancer, you'll go nuts watching her--alternately laughing, then crying at the horrible technique you are watching from someone who claims she was a soloist for a company.

The location is lovely, the music is cheesy and synthesizer-style with a '90's vibe. Ms. Gulan has a decent voice as she narrates, but it tends toward the syrupy sweet, and her 'encouragement' is oddly delivered. She also has a very tense and often pained smile plastered to her face, which you may find pleasant, but we found obnoxious by the end. There is very little stretching/flexibility aspect--just a few quick stretches at the end, but nothing like what a dancer would do, or does do on a daily basis.

And that is why I give it one star--neither Ms. Gulan, nor the workout she has put together, live up to what she claims in the description. I'm sure she's a lovely person, and I'm sure she has clientele who love her. I shudder to think that she's teaching dance, but perhaps when she's in the dance studio, she is able to teach correct technique to her students. I'm not hopeful, though. In the case of this video, she shows a complete lack of understanding of the basics of dance physiology, technique, and despite what she claims, following her lead will not give you the body of a dancer.",1419811200,35,4735,4.74726609963548

3199142,5,B000WC38BO,"I love, love, love this Ballet Conditioning dvd. Elise Gulan has a sweet, gentle voice talking you through each movement. It is such a peaceful time that I hesitate to call it a Work-Out, but I Do sweat--A lot(!) and my body is transforming: my legs are slimming as my muscles become toned. The inner thighs are pulling inward, creating that missed 'space' between the legs when standing 'at attention' (love it!). My derriere has been lifted, hips are smoothing out; feels wonderful to put on a pair of jeans and like what I see

This routine includes some jumps, but do what you can and with each Practice Session they become easier and you will be able to complete the section with no effort at all. My knees tend to have tension in them, but once I get to this part my body is so warmed up by all the knee bends, including Deep knee bends prior to the jumping, that this section is No Problem; doing all the  movements in this dvd actually make my knees feel good, strong. As with the jumping, the knee bends were done little by little as my body became stronger

She ends with a section of stomach work - again, don't give up because it's tough, keep at it, day by day, session by session, doing a little more than you did the previous session and you'll be doing the entire section and feeling Great at both the accomplishment of completing the section and knowing that you're on your way to transformation in looks and health

I run through this dvd any time I can, striving for everyday, but am happy with every other day; it's about staying in motion; the dvd runs 50mins

I found it quite tough the first time through - I danced when I was young, but am now 55 years old, and I never realized how hard it was.  My legs were shaking afterward, and my abdominals were really burning.  It works the entire body in a very short amount of time, and is overall very effective.  My only criticism would be the ""spa music"", if that's the right word, in the background.  I wish someone would make a ballet video using classical music.

3199191,5,B000WC38BO,"After getting hooked on barre workouts,  and reading all of the great reviews, I decided to give this dvd a try.

I was a bit nervous though as I have zero ballet and zero dance experience.

The workout itself was challenging, but not overly so. On a scale of 1-10 I would probably put it at a 6 in intensity. I found myself breaking a sweat, but I survived. I thought the hardest part involved some of the core exercises at the end and I found myself having to pause and take breaks.

And yes, as previous viewers have noted, the woman doing the voice over does sound overly sensual. I just turn the volume down low though so my husband doesn't think I am watching adult movies in the next room. Other than that I have no complaints about this video.

My favorite part about this workout though is how I feel afterwards. Even though I am not a tenth as graceful as the woman in the video, I feel graceful and more fluid in my movements afterward. And even though I have been practicing yoga for some time, I felt like this has helped my balance beyond what I have gotten out of yoga. While yoga gives me a stationary sense of balance, this helps me to balance better while moving- essentially making me much less if a klutz in day to day life.

This video actually inspired me to purchase the New York City Ballet workout dvd for more ballet inspired workouts. I doubt I will ever be a ballet dancer, but I can definitely see the benefits for non-dancers like me!",1411344000,,1464,4.305454545454546

3199199,5,B000WC38BO,"I think this is an excellent workout for anyone looking for gym-style results without doing gym-style routines. It's also a very good way to gain the coordination and strength needed to enhance your dance practice.
As background: I am 26, and have always been relatively active, though it's only in the last couple years that I've really been consciously working out. Two years ago, I got into yoga. My friends and I still have not advanced beyond beginner status -- we do it mostly to relax and so we can say we moved at least a little that day despite having mostly office style jobs. Last spring, we did P90X. And, yes, we finished. It was never easy, so I would like to say that makes me a normal individual -- determined, but normal. Since then, my workout has been less strenuous -- mostly, I do bellydancing videos with a little easy yoga mixed in. In college, I took two semesters of ballet, but other than that, I have no formal dance training.
So, I'm in decent shape, but I'm not a professional anything when it comes to fitness.
Four months ago, I got this video and have used it probably six times since. I am telling you, it kicks my butt every time. But in a good way. This is one of those workouts that leaves you worn out but feeling accomplished. On the scale of workouts I've done in my life, it'd fit in with P90X. In fact, I'd say this video is what would happen if Tony Horton had a nice calming voice and ran a beginning ballet class.
This video covers about 90% of the things I learned in my beginning ballet classes in college. It's pretty much an entire semester crammed into 50 minutes. Because she doesn't explain how something is done, it may be easier for someone with ballet experience to effectively grasp, but I have no doubt that a complete ballet beginner could do it. It just might take a little rewinding or multiple views before it really clicked.

And, I am 61 years old, 5'5"", usually somewhere between 125-127 lbs.  I conscientiously exercise, but moderately. A brisk one hour walk or 40 minutes walk aerobics, 5 days a week, with some lifting with 3 lb weights a couple times a week. And about 15 minutes of stretching every other day.

And, I have a lower back herniated disk problem.  Which is not at all aggravated by these exercises.  In principle I'd not expect it to be, but I'm always a little wary.

I wanted to try this because I was getting really frustrated with a growing lack of flexibility as I got older.  I hated the stiffness and pain in my hips and feeling like I was never going to bounce up from a chair again! The yoga was helping but not enough.

This really is the solution. I can't believe how ""bouncy"" I feel, getting up and moving around, from any position.  I suspect that strengthening is helping there too.

I assumed it would take some repetition to improve in my execution and that is definitely happening.  I feel a real sense of accomplishment in doing these. I feel as if I am educating my body, not just exercising it.

As someone who did ballet in primary school, I was already familiar with some of the basic positions, and glad that the video provided such a thorough workout of the legs and core. Some of the moves were quite challenging, but I am already feeling improvements in balance, strength, and flexibility. The only critique I have was the focus on body shape. I realize that the ballet world focuses on external appearances, but it's quite possible for people of different body types to benefit from ballet even if their goal isn't to get a ""perfect"", 'long lean body'. I wish the video were a little more gender-neutral as well - I felt as though the intended audience was women, and that isn't necessary for a ballet video, since lots of men do ballet. I wish there had been more detail on how to do the forms (especially the leg lifts at the end) and not as much focus on what our bodies should look like.

I was pleasantly surprised that this was not the case with this DVD: the exercises not only followed the general format of a true ballet barre, but they were challenging as well. While I wouldn't recommend this workout to an absolute beginner, if you've had a bit of ballet before, it's perfect. It will take you through some thorough barre work, a few exercises in the center, some ab work, and then a stretch. The scenery is beautiful and the instructor is both pleasant and encouraging. I've seen other reviews in which reviewers complained about her voice or the music; I didn't find either one to be offensive.

3199490,5,B000WC38BO,"If you are rusty with ballet/dance, and/or have been doing mostly cardio (even if it involves a lot of leg action, such as running or the elliptical), please heed my advice!

You will want to pace yourself and not push yourself to do every exercise to completion. The first time I did the DVD, I did everything to the point of muscle exhaustion. The next day, I was so sore that I was incapacitated and could not move normally, even with Icy Hot and stretching.

So, don't push yourself past ""burn"" to ""can't move my leg that way anymore"". It could result in more than straining your muscles- even good athletes get injured that way (Achilles tendon injuries, anyone?).

I find that modifying some positions to the easier version, or switching legs, helps avoid fatigue so I can get further along in the DVD. Also, you can just go slower and do the movements correctly, rather than try to keep up with her. If you switch legs, you can just make sure to remember to switch back again later so you do both sides as equally as possible.

Someone mentioned she does not do each side equally. This may be due to the fact that it is easy to miss the verbal cues to switch sides. The way the footage is shot you could miss that she switched sides. Sometimes, the exercises involved automatically use both sides, such as plies, but just involve holding one arm up on one side longer. Maybe that's what the person meant...anyway, if it's arms, by the time you are done with the legs section you will probably have held each side up.

In short, advice: use a rug or yoga mat. You don't need shoes. Have a chair and plenty of water nearby. And don't push yourself to do everything to completion. It is harder than it looks.",1389657600,8,1712,4.439490445859873

I know other reviewers mentioned they liked the voice over of instructions, but while it did make the moves easy to follow - I prefer someone instructing while teaching.

This is why I only gave it 4 stars - I'm not sure I'm going to see the results I've gotten with other DVDs, I only worked up a sweat with the ab work.  But I will enjoy doing this lovely 50 minute workout a least once a week.  The scenery indeed is serene and beautiful, an inspired idea to take a class out of the studio!  Her voice is soft and encouraging, letting you know if you can't do what she's doing, no worries, that's the beauty of you.  And ending with a curtsey to ""honor"" my workout - well, I would not have been surprised if a bouquet of roses came out of the tv to land at my feet!  If you enjoy the elegance of ballet, I encourage you to add this to your workout repertoire, to increase balance, control and inner joy.",1382227200,,1180,4.034334763948498

I am somewhat knowledgeable in the area of exercise and its effect on muscles, and this DVD presents all movements in a safe and effective manner.  You don't have to be in top form to do this video, but must progress with caution if you are completely out of shape as the instructor clearly states at intervals during the program.  Certain areas of the video are tough, but its the intention to perform the movements, as stated by the instructor, that is important.  In time, patience, and consistency, flexibility and strength will be accomplished.",1381881600,,582,4.732673267326732

This is a fantastic work out with beautiful scenery. It's done in natural light so it's easy to see how each move should be done. It's a pleasant experience, which seems like a strange thing to say after saying it's a tough exercise routine, but the tone of voice, her beautiful form, the lighting and scenery make it a pleasure to watch....you get lost in the music and beauty and forget how much your legs are hurting....get this DVD, you'll love it!",1380758400,,623,4.473684210526316

I took ballet as a child to young woman (long time ago), so I understood the language, but if you don't have the experience, don't worry. You won't have any trouble following along.

This DVD is a lot of slow movement muscle building and doesn't require the need to buy expensive shoes. All you need is a chair and the room to move it to your right or to your left as the workout progresses. If you have bad knees or hips, you may want to skip this.",1380240000,2,633,4.188524590163935

It looks easy at first but after 5 minutes my legs and bootie are on fire! I used to take some dance classes as a girl so some of the positions are familiar. This workout is so invigorating that I find myself wishing I could do it everyday. With practice, I am gradually able to do more repititions of plies. IYou will see results pretty quick - my thighs and calves are toned after just a few weeks. During the poses, the instructor uses a chair as a ""barre"" - the only downside to this is that you have to pick up the chair and move it each time you switch sides.

3199596,5,B000WC38BO,"This is the first time ever that I have been compelled to write a review on anything, and I have to say that this is a really enjoyable, challenging workout, using the fantastic yet simple movements of ballet.
Throughout my childhood I trained in ballet over a 10 year period and was in fantastic shape. 12 years later and having recently given birth to twin babies, I've definitely got some work to do to get fully back into shape. This is so ideal! You can take it on your own gradient - your flexibility, strength etc do not matter because the style of workout works your body at your level. You push yourself to do all that you can do and you feel your body change into as Elise says, lengthened, leaner and stronger.
What an ideal workout - that anyone can do!
Thank you Elise!

Then it moves on to jumps and glorified jumping jacks, which I'd have to stop and put my shoes back on for, since the first half of the video is meant to be done barefoot.",1377734400,4,328,4.061538461538461
3199600,5,B000WC38BO,"I've been using this conditioning DVD almost every day for three weeks now, and I have to say I've grown to love it.  On days when I vary things up with other types of exercise, usually youtube programs, I find myself needing to do some of this as well to end my exercise for the day, because it feels like coming home. Elise has a very soothing presence and the music is very calm and puts you in a good frame of mind. It's a tough work out (you do sweat) and since I haven't done any ballet for over 50 years!! while the body remembers the positions, the muscles take a while to catch up. I notice that my legs are firmer, my waistline is streamlined, my cellulite seems diminished, my posture feels improved, and I even walk down the street much more confidently. Elise's program really does make you feel like a dancer. I bought the Vita Vibe BD48 Prodigy Series Portable Double Freestanding Ballet Barre, Stretch/Dance Bar, 4-Feet to use with this routine, and I prefer using that to using a chair. Because of my age (60+), I avoid the brief segment of the jumping steps.  I guess I'm just a little nervous about my knees. But the opening stretch sequence, the lower body work (really intense at points ... you feel the burn), and the section focused on abdominals are fantastic, and I get a good 35-40 minute workout depending on where I stop. The first few times I did the program, I would stop at around 15-20 minutes. Gradually, I could do more. I would say it's intense but easy on the body. I recommend it confidently to people my age and certainly to anyone younger.",1377561600,12,1578,4.419243986254296

3199635,5,B000WC38BO,"I enjoy this video.  It clearly covers from in a slow repetition of each exercise then does a sped up version.  The fast version is never very fast so it is not a cardio-type workout.  I don't really break a sweat with this one.  But after holding each arm up for 20 plus minutes (with brief breaks) they feel like they'll fall off.  All the exercises are do-able but boy do they burn.  By the end my legs are shaking and arms burning.
I think this instructor knows what she's doing.  My only complaint is that it doesn't have that heart-rate raising type of workout that you might get from aerobics, so I'd alternate this workout with something else (cardio, and more weight-lifting upper body) for a more balanced feel of fitness.",1375833600,,732,4.5
3199636,3,B000WC38BO,"I work out a lot - mostly with DVDs because I don't have time to waste waiting for equipment at the gym.  So I'm kind of an armchair quarterback when it comes to workout DVDs.

This one wasn't bad.  I expected it to be mildly challenging and there were actually some parts of it that impressed me with how challenging they were.  Other parts were just silly easy.  And there isn't really a way to do a ""hard"" workout vs. an ""easy"" workout on this DVD.

There is also very little cardio / very light cardio so don't expect much of that.

Overall, if you did ballet as a kid and you loved and miss it then this is a nice throwback and a half-decent workout.  If you want a challenging workout that is going to kick your butt and make you sweat, then this is not the thing for you.",1375488000,,778,4.105960264900662

It really takes your mind off the fact that you are exercising and toning/building muscles. This is one workout that I actually look forward to and get grouchy when I don't get the ""me time"" to do it! Another thing I love about the video is that you can modify your workout if you aren't able to do all of the moves exactly as described. This means you can really get a lot out of the video because you grow with it! It's the best! By the way, this is my third copy, a a few of my friends have ""borrowed"" and loved it as well.

3199638,4,B000WC38BO,"This is a good workout video. It is mostly focused on muscular work so it ends up being a bit long to my liking since you need to add at least 30 minutes of cardio to the 50 minutes of this video in order to get a full workout. I am not familiar with ballet-type workout and was a bit surprised at how hard those moves are. After 20 minutes, my legs were shaking and I was breaking a bit of a sweat. I like a lot the gracefulness involved in the moves and the fact that I learn the moves slowly before doing them quickly. There is a chance I might get tired of that once I am more familiar with the routine. I am not such a big fan of the background music either.

3199639,5,B000WC38BO,"i have been using this DVD for over 5 years.  i reach for it when i don't want to jump around.  the movements are slow and steady, deceptive. it takes time, proper breathing, and strong core to achieve the effortless grace.  i still haven't mastered the ab work out (the last part).

**About the workout:

I've owned several workout DVDs with the name ballet in the title.  IMO Ballet Conditioning feels more like taking a ballet class than the others because it is pure ballet, not pilates and not yoga.  The other ballet workout DVDs all have pilates and yoga.

Also, the workout concentrates on core and lower body strength, both vital to ballet dancers.  If you want equal attention to upper body/arms/shoulders, you won't find here.

**About the music:

i mute the dvd and use the CD ""Adagio by Herbert Von Karajan"".

Ballet + adagio classical music = peace + calm + relaxation

this dvd is the best when i need to forget about the world and just breathe and concentrate on movements.",1375228800,7,989,4.614942528735632
3199640,5,B000WC38BO,This workout is hard and relaxing at the same time. You learn balance and grace while toning your whole body. I have discovered muscle groups I didn't know I could work out. Truly great for getting a beautiful body,1374364800,3,214,4.512820512820513
3199641,3,B000WC38BO,"First, a caveat:  I used to be a real athlete but now have a debilitating health condition and so can only approach this video on my best days and that only in small portions.  But I think both my background and my present condition help me to give some useful comments.

SUGGESTIONS FOR USERS: If this is your first time using the video and you are in good shape but not great shape, I would highly recommend skipping from the stretches to the tondeaus (minute 12) and, from there, doing the rest of the video or as much of it as you are able.  This means skipping the reviles and plies.  Then if you have any strength or time left at the end, skip back to the of reviles and plies.  You will be working the calves (as in the reviles) and the quads (as in the plies) a fair amount in the second half of the video but not as intensely.  The eight minutes or so of reviles and plies at the front are so intense that you may be unable to do the more varied and longer remainder of the video by the time you have finished them or by the time you have even finished half of them (those muscles may be spent).  So if you skip them and circle back to them at the end, you can do just the right amount that your strength allows.  Also, I think that even if you CAN do the reviles and plies, you will be able to perform the other exercises on the video with more focus and ability if you are not already half-spent and wobbily-legged from the reviles and plies.  So I really recommend skipping them at first regardless of strength level so that you are less likely to hurt yourself with the other unfamiliar movements.

SUGGESTIONS FOR THE VIDEO MAKERS: This video desperately needs more chapter breaks.  I ended up going through and writing down what minute she starts tondeaus, what minute what minute she starts glutes, etc., but it is exceedingly difficult to skip around to these places without chapters.  Those with less strength will *need* to skip the most challenging portion of any given body part focus and move on to the next body part, yet it is exceedingly hard to do so.  In future iterations of this DVD, I would make each switch from left barre to right barre a different chapter.  Although my next complaint is more trivial, it is worth saying: I try to tune out what she says almost completely.  I have some yoga videos that are less profoundly and constantly cheesy than her words of encouragement are.  More than that, she blathers on incessantly about dancers' (i.e., her) enivable streamlined body, thin waist, and flat tummy.  I mean, *incessantly.*  If I had a little girl at home I would not use this video at all for fear of giving her a body image complex.  Some women will never have her shape even when they are most toned.  Even some really thin women will never have her shape b/c they naturally bulk their muscles.",1373673600,18,2839,4.379770992366412

3199705,3,B000WC38BO,"Agree with many reviews, there is no basic info for anyone who is not familiar with the whole ballet setup.  Not once did she mention that every muscle south of your ribs should be striving toward turnout, which to me is THE reason ballet is a good workout!

Yes, the music is bad, not just for itself but because having a steady beat for the slow movements adds challenge -- you should be filling every last millisecond with graceful movement.

And let's be honest, who ever had a ballet teacher who talked constantly about being happy?  Smiling through the pain, maybe.....

I may try NYC, because I was really looking for a tape of a real ballet class.",1371686400,,655,4.516949152542373

A great outlet, so she started ballet again & could not have been happier. All the exercises are coming back with the help of the DVDs as well. Well done!!!

3199710,5,B000WC38BO,"I recently bought this DVD and have absolutely LOVED it.
I am by NO means in shape (thus the buying of ""work out"" dvds) but the workouts were very doable without being easy.
The instruction is clear, easy to follow (even without knowing any ballet terms), and she does BOTH sides of your body so you don't have to do the other on your own later.
This DVD was challenging enough that I did not get through the entire thing without needing to stop for an occasional/momentary rest, BUT not so hard that I could not finish the entire program. I like this because it gives you something to work toward- completing it a little better each time you do it.
I also FELT that wonderful post-workout soreness in my muscles the next day, even in my arms! I love that even though you're not doing a whole lot with your arms you're still getting a great work out for them.

However, I found this video to be way too difficult. I would have been able to handle it if there had been more stretch time (especially within the lower body and abdominal sections). But it went on and on with no relief! I could nearly feel my muscles tearing. This video, in time, could potentially make one very strong, but not in a long, lean, or elegant way. I feel as though the video could be improved with more stretching and gentle exercises. They could also get rid of the entire barre section (no former ballet dancer that I know of cares to do hundreds of tendus or frappes.. unnecessary)and add an upper body section-- the area where many dancers could really use some conditioning! The music is pretty awful also and her voice is annoying.",1370131200,9,920,4.482142857142857
3199732,5,B000WC38BO,"I've been doing Russian ballet since age 5 and Pointe since age 13, and I felt the need to write a review to let perspective buyers know that this workout DVD is wonderful!  I know a lot of the negative reviews complain that the routine is too repetitive and boring, but those people have obviously never taken a ballet class before because barre repetition is what makes up 75% or more of class.  As an example, my instructor changed our class from an hour to an hour and a half because she refused to do less than an hour of barre work and didn't have any time to do floor work or practice our dance routine.  This workout DVD was almost identical to my ballet class but with less repetition of each move and slightly different arm positions.  For those people who felt the workout wasn't difficult enough, one thing to keep in mind is ballet isn't supposed to leave you dripping in sweat like an Insanity or P90X workout; it's about slow and precise movements that create thin, toned muscles.  With this DVD, you WILL feel it and see results.  Whether you are an experienced ballerina or someone who always wanted to try ballet, this workout routine is an excellent example of what ballet class entails.",1369353600,47,1206,4.534562211981567

I have hip, leg and foot pain that I was concerned about but the workouts on this dvd improved my flexibility so much my hips haven't bothered me in about a month. After some practice at 3 times a week I can do the entire workout with greatly improved form. I went from 135 lbs to 125, and my waist is now at 35"". I still have a little way to go yet, but I'm getting there and at a pace that is comfortable and perfect for me. The instructor is very supportive and positive but not in an annoying way. The music isn't terrible, though a few times it sounds a little like stereotypical porn music, and that just makes me giggle. One thing I will criticize is the volume of her instruction can be a little hard to hear over the music sometimes, but that could be my sound system too.

One word of warning, I have flat feet like you wouldn't believe so it can be a little uncomfortable if you're like me. But then again standing for more than 10 minutes hurts too so I wasn't expecting any exercise to be pain-free for me. Also, be careful during the floor routine, without proper support of your neck you will probably end up a bit sore.

Buying this DVD was the best addition to my routine. It does exactly what I wanted. It's a challenging workout but it's not as micro hard core as Pop Physique. It is definitely ballet heavy and the moves are based on your core and thigh muscles. It's broken into 3 major sections at 51minutes. Section 1 (thigh): stretch and thighs, Section 2 (cardio): Jumps and Leg Lifts, Section 3 (core): floor abs. There is a mini-stretch in-between sections. I truly loved the workout as the movements are slightly more broad than my Pop workouts and the chair is really just a minor tool to build strength and toning.

Anyway, it's a great workout and the first time I did it I had to stop and catch my breath a couple of times and my legs were so sore.  Now after a few uses I only take breaks during the ab portion.

I wouldn't recommend this for people with no ballet formal training.  You won't get the benefit/might hurt yourself if you don't know how to stand correctly,plie correctly, or know basic ballet moves and positions.  However, if you have training it's a great workout and it helps me stay in shape and last longer in ballet class.",1366243200,3,640,4.213114754098361
3199738,5,B000WC38BO,"I have had this DVD for two weeks now and yes I would recommend it. You don't need to be a dancer to do the workout, it might be helpful in getting through the entire DVD, but not necessary. The length of the workout is about 51 minutes and in four chapters. There is a stretch an tone section, a leg strength and glute section, a jump and cardio section and lastly an abdominal and cool down section. I can get through the first two sections and then my legs are shaking and the sweat is just pouring off. I then skip ahead to the ab workout and that's about all I can handle. I have noticed improvement in my thighs and lower butt so far. My pants fit just a little bit better in those areas. I do the DVD every other day so about four days a week. My goal is to be able to do the DVD at least six days a week and be able to get through all of it. You don't need equipment to be purchased you need only a high backed stable chair. On the DVD the instructor does the routine barefoot I highly recommend either tapping your feet or wearing a sport slip on shoe. Much of the exercises will require you to stand with balance support from your chair, and then raise up to the balls of your feet a complete another series of the movements. The padding of shoes or tape will help reduce the strain an pain on your feet. Let me be clear this will not teach you to become a dancer, but the squats, leg lifts, presses and stretches will work your entire body.

I figure skate regularly and the emphasis on graceful movement while targeting specific muscle groups has been very helpful. Rather than bulking up with muscle, I have longer, leaner muscles now. The instruction is well timed and a perfect amount of description. The tone is peacefully energetic, without the silly motivational tropes that some workout videos have.

I myself am an experienced dancer, so that being said I thought this DVD was fantastic. I've been out of comission for quit a while, having had a baby and being diagnosed with a chronic condition. Wanting to get back into my old fitness regimen, I needed a solid way to begin. Enter Element: Ballet Conditioning. It's a good pace, the moves are solid, and it's everything I did as a child and teenager that kept me slim, fit and healthy. This is most definitely a healthy way to get your body back in shape.

That being said, the music is bland. If you can keep up without it, mute it and pump your own music for better energy.  Also, my two year old kept up with a lot of the stuff just by following along what she watched. So if you can get past any frustration of not knowing the names of moves or having them broken down for you, then you don't necessarily need to be an experienced dancer to follow along.",1361750400,9,1145,4.291666666666667

It's not for the faint of heart, and it's not a workout you can automatically jump into, so I wouldn't recommend this for a beginner. This is a DVD that you need to ease into, unless you're an experienced dancer/athletic person. It has a warmup routine, and then the workout routine, which after about 25 minutes, made me tired! It's great, because it targets your thighs, calves, buns, and your core muscles.

The instructor, Elise Gulan, was a principal soloist for the Virginia Ballet Company and her experience shows as she so capably demonstrates the movements.  The cueing is done in voiceover.  The workout takes place in an exquisitely beautiful outdoor setting which adds to the lovely tranquility of the workout.  Elise starts out with graceful, flowing stretches before getting into the barre work.  Although it is helpful to have a barre, Ms. Gulan does all of the supported work with a chair.  After the barre work, which will really work your legs/glutes, she leads you through a series of kicks (battements) to the front, back and sides.  Next is jumps in first, second and fifth position.  This will also work your legs and raise your heartrate.  None of the jumps take up a lot of room.  Another short series of stretches follow to get out the kinks in your muscles from all of your hard work.  Then you go into a short but intense Pilates segment to work your core muscles.  Elise finishes up the 51-minute workout with some more relaxing, elongating stretches.  I would rate this a high-intermediate workout.",1360540800,7,1322,4.695652173913044

It is essentially the barre portion of a ballet class with some things that would typically be done center floor included. This was always my favorite portion of class and it is a great strengthening workout. The reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars is that I think if you have no ballet experience you might not get as much out of some of the movement if you don't know the technique. For example, a tendu should use muscles all the way up your leg, which is why it is a good exercise. But if you don't know this, it kind of just looks like sliding your foot on the floor and you wouldn't get much of a workout. I think she could have done a better job of explaining technique for those who are not familiar. I will definitely be using it again!",1360454400,6,812,4.1455696202531644

The instructor made it very easy to follow along with this rather intense conditioning.  Not only that, but she manages to be soothing while your muscles are screaming! The birth doula in me was really impressed by that!

By the end, my legs were burning but I felt really good!

This workout is intense on the legs but the core and lats get a pretty good toning as well.  The arms do get some action  but I think I would like to add something that focuses on them more.

3199864,5,B000WC38BO,"This DVD is for those of us who are bored, tired, or sick of Jillian Michaels and similar workout ""gurus"" whose workouts coerce the viewer into frantic and frenzied movement during an inefficient and painful 20 minutes of yelling and punching. This DVD is also for those of us who prefer measured and elegant movement, combined with the history, moves, and strategy of a discipline that has been shaping bodies for over many centuries.

I am not a fit and slim ballet dancer like the leader, Elise, but that didn't make me feel any less graceful as she led me through a series of yoga-inspired stretches, then onto ballet moves that incorporated basics such as pli, port de bras (how to carry the arms), relev or balancing on the balls of one's feet. There are some jumps such as jumping from second to first position in a cardio section, and the ab section is mostly doing bicycling moves with the legs.

I appreciated that Elise first did the exercises slowly, then gradually increased their tempo once I got used to them. She also explained what each technical ballet term was, giving the video authenticity. What struck me the most is that she often mentioned that while it was okay to stretch or move within your range of mobility, that, with continual practice, one's flexibility will increase. As simple as it sounds, it made me want to continue to work out to see the effects of the program. I also appreciated her ballerina's sensibility shining through with reminders to smile and to enjoy the movements. They weren't phony, but I could see she enjoyed the exercise. The video even ends with a curtsy to applaud your efforts!

Although I gave the video 5 stars, on account of the high production quality, beautiful setting, affordable price, emphasis on elegance and legitimate ballet, I do have a few suggestions. First of all, the music is primarily smooth modern chill or jazz. I was hoping to have some classical music as I find that most relaxing. The music here is not horrible, but it would have been nice to have perhaps an alternate audio track.

Secondly, a previous reviewer mentioned that it would be too hard to do this DVD without prior knowledge of ballet. While I'm familiar with some ballet terms, and took ballet in kindergarten, I can't say that that gives me any advantage over someone who hasn't. Elise explains the terms she uses.

I have never done ballet or ballet conditioning before, but I do have experience with exercise, Pilates, yoga, etc. I find that this workout is very accessible for people with no ballet background, it is easy to follow, and yet it will totally kick your butt!

I enjoy the more mellow tone of the workout, the music isn't the best, but it is pleasant enough, and honestly if you are doing these exercises intensely the burn should distract you from the slightly dorky music. I like how it comes across as a relaxation workout, and Elise keeps telling you to smile and enjoy it while you are feeling some crazy burn in your muscles. I really prefer that to the boot camp technique with the more aggressive tone.

Also I am finding that these types of exercises don't irritate my back. This workout strengthens the entire body and is not hard on my back at all.

Two things though I'd like to point out that I think could be better:
1. There is one exercise where she says something like ""move up and to the side"" and I am not sure if it is 2 movements or one, it is a small movement and hard to tell exactly what she is doing.
2. Personally I'd like more stretching at the end, so when the workout is over I do all the stretching I like.

I think most people know that ballet is a fantastic challenge to the muscles, but emphasizing their usage through such demanding application during conditioning is just plain tough! (in a good way).  Not a single muscle can kick back and relax during this dvd.  Focusing on correct posture, stability, and technique during the execution of each move provides wonderful lower and upper body strength and endurance training....and your core will love you! ...and all in the convenience of your own home. Enjoy! - Kate",1345161600,2,583,5.052083333333333

3199910,5,B000WC38BO,"I'm a 48-yr-old woman and I took up figure skating two-years ago. My skating coach said I needed to take some ballet, so I've been taking a weekly ballet class for two months. This DVD reinforces the ballet terms and movements that I've learned in class, without explaining the exact positioning required. This makes it much more enjoyable as I already know from class how to do the move and my goal is just to have a ballet body and graceful movements, not become a ballerina. You don't need any ballet training to follow this program as you can just follow the instructor. You can jump to a particular section or just follow it all the way through. This is a DVD that I'll probably do weekly to give myself a more fun version of a ballet class.",1344124800,3,746,4.413043478260869

It gives me the satisfaction of ballet movement without the complicated choreography that could bring injury.  Very strengthening for the core muscles.  Moves at a comfortable, smooth pace.  Perfect for my needs.  If you used to study ballet, you will remember what it felt like..... it's all in how you execute the movements.",1341878400,6,559,4.8936170212765955

3199944,5,B000WC38BO,"This is a great workout video that really works your muscles! It focuses on lower-body strength but also adds in some arm strength and a few ab workouts. What it is, is basically warm-ups you do in your ballet class with a higher intensity. If you've never done ballet before, do not assume that it's relaxed and easy. You make it look graceful, but the moves itself are intense and challenging. But they are also doable even for someone who has never done ballet before. Just know how to point your feet!",1340928000,4,505,4.5
3199945,5,B000WC38BO,"I just received my ""Ballet Conditioning"" DVD in the mail and got to work straight away. The workout is about 50 min but it went by super quickly. I think it should be called ""Ballet Meditation"" instead b/c it was extremely calming and my legs felt so wonderful and stretched out after I finished. I am an avid runner so this workout was not a ""feel the burn"" kind of thing but it's a fabulous warm-up before I go on my runs; it stretches me out and gets rid of a lot of lactic acid. I found some parts of this workout challenging though b/c I don't have great flexibility. The majority of this workout includes a segment during which you balance standing next to a chair while doing leg work. In the middle is a fun jumping segment (I couldn't go full out on this part b/c I live in a 2nd floor apartment). The last segment includes some Pilates style abdominal work and a stretching cool down. I have other Pilates DVDs that employ a few similar moves but this one is my new favorite b/c it is distinctly different; the setting is a garden overlooking the Pacific Ocean and the host is so graceful that I become inspired to perfect my own form instead of doggedly slogging through! If you like this DVD, you should also like ""Pilates: Target Specifics"" w/ Jennifer Kries. If you want an extension of the ab workout at the end of ""Ballet Conditioning,"" I suggest ""Pilates Ab Workout"" w/ Ana Caban.",1340668800,3,1397,4.397683397683398

3199947,4,B000WC38BO,"I'm 31 years old & I have three children ages 1-4 years. After my first baby I got into Power 90, and if you do that I'll tell you that you need to be at Level 5-6 before you can expect yourself to be able to pull off this DVD. If you're starting from scratch take it SLOW.
With my most recent pregnancy I used this DVD for toning 3 times a week, supplementing with P90 1-2 Sculpt's band workout. I skipped the abs and jumps and did the remaining 20 min. or so. And I had the best delivery and recovery yet! It was amazing how good I felt! Plus, after so much repetition I was able to do some stretches in the hospital that took off lots of muscle tension from delivery...if you've never had a baby you'd be surprised how much you use your whole body in delivery. My arms and back are always sore...but then I use a bar to grab hold of. TMI.
Speaking of bars, you don't need a barre for this DVD, just a chair!!! And a soft place (carpet or mat) for abs. Nor do you need much space at all! I do this in our small office. Plus after I know the reps I can just mute it an listen to or watch my own thing simultaneously. You'll notice she sounds very ethereal in her voice-over and in the use of music...very other-worldly and Nirvana-ish. Hence the muting in preference of my own thing. :)
Before purchase, go to youtube and check out ""Element Ballet Conditioning"" to get a feel for this video. This DVD gives a fresh, new perspective on how easy it is to fit dance into your life and how trendy it can be. While you're at it also youtube ""Ballet Beautiful Online Blasts by Mary Helen Bowers"" and get the feel for that. In my opinion only, MHB reminds me of the preppy girls from high school who were snobs...and she models so many different kinds of unitards with bare legs that it makes me think she's totally into herself. Couldn't stomach it.
I'm here to buy another copy for myself because our Chinese Int'l student confiscated mine. ;-) Actually, I gave it to her to try and she loved it so much I gave it to her for graduation.

But, I really have come to love this DVD. Every time I give this DVD my all, I always end up very sore the next day. It is great for toning arms, but it leaves your legs and butt in AMAZING shape. In order to work my abs, I try to focus on breathing and core strength as I mimic the moves of the instructor. It has definitely changed the shape of my body and I feel like the instructor gives me enough motivation without being annoying. It's almost... relaxing, with soft music and beautiful scenery.

Especially compared to other workout videos I have used. I personally cannot get through the NY Ballet workout. So Boring. This one has a great pace.

I think that it is a more enjoyable way to tone your legs than alternatives such as The Barre Method (which I also like), Tracy Anderson, and any typical DVD that requires a million squats and lunges. I am ready to take some future ballet classes and to use this as one of my prime methods of toning below the waste. She also works the abs and your flexibility. I wish that I used this video more often in the past versus other programs that I have wasted my time doing. I am now going to experiment on this video and see if I have more results long term.

I ended up finishing the whole video without feeling exhausted, however, it was still an amazing workout though.

I did end up sweating while doing the video, but it wasn't a lot like what everyone else said. I found the jumping section (cardio) to be extremely fun, and it got my heart rate up, I enjoyed it a lot. I didn't have difficulty with any of the parts except for one at the beginning when I was working on my inner thighs. That workout BURNED! And my thighs were sore the next day. When I was doing that section, but thighs and legs were shaking uncontrollably! I feel as if I didn't do some of the moves right though.

She gives great examples of proper form, but I wouldn't recommend it for true ballet training on its own. She does a good job about reminding you to pull your abs up, but gives no reminders about holding your hips level, not sickling your feet, etc. If you're just looking for a slow-paced workout that still gets you sweating, then this is definitely for you. If you are taking ballet classes and know the proper forms, rest assured she does nothing too complicated that your instructor wouldn't want you to practice on your own. I added it two months ago into my routine (I do it twice a week) and it's definitely helped me with my balance, leg strength and posture. (Also, the ab section is a killer!) The music isn't classic ballet class music, but definitely not your usual annoying workout music fare. It times very well to the movements and pace.

I'm used to doing squats and lunges and this works your muscles in a much different way. I found my legs burning and trembling during certain parts.

It's a ""Ballet Inspired"" workout and I knew that when I oredered it which is fine, but I was yawning half way into it. I think it's because the music it is set to sounds like sleepy time music rather than upbeat or classical piano for barre work. If you can follow along without verbal instruction,then I highly suggest plugging into your mp3 player and use your own ballet music for this. That's just my opinion. Other than that it is a good way to stretch out and I'll use it as a warmup for my other workouts.",1324166400,4,761,4.08
3200081,5,B000WC38BO,"When I first popped the dvd in all I could think was, ""Oh my god how boring..."" I finished the workout but it felt kind of boring. Well a month later and this is the one of the only workout videos I am still doing regularly at least 4 times a week. Why the change? Well it's challenging enough that it can sometimes seem impossible to finish, but because of the way it's filmed I can mute it and watch a movie or a tv show and still do this workout.

I do really enjoy the workout, it feels like I am doing a ballet warmup! The first part is stretching the spine and then moves into releves on the toes and then plies. The second consists of barre work done with a chair, if you want more of a challenge you can do it without a chair, but I am so unbalanced I can barely hold tree pose for longer than a couple of seconds. The last part includes a burst of cardio with jumps, then goes into ab/core work which is HARD.

All things considered, this is a nice relaxing workout that can seem boring, but is extremely effective.",1323302400,,1024,4.08955223880597
3200082,5,B000WC38BO,"I just started taking a weekly ballet class at my local dance studio. Having never danced ballet before, I wanted something to help me get more flexible and gain more coordination in between my dance classes. This has really helped! Not only am I more flexible, but I feel stronger when doing the moves as well. Great for beginners!",1323302400,,332,4.6440677966101696
3200093,2,B000WC38BO,"I'm only giving this two stars because if you can stay awake through the whole thing, it does work your muscles.  Elise does nothing to keep you awake or interested, especially when she says (read in whispery soft voice),"" Now let's repeat the sequence on the other side"" which means you have about sixteen reps of the same boring exercise with the other leg. There is not really any cardio except a tiny section of the workout.  And by ""cardio"" I mean jumping in place, not fun and beautiful balletic leaps that kept me interested in the real ballet classes I used to take.  I'm a mother of four, including a young baby , and frankly I'd rather be napping than doing this workout.  In fact, I'd rather be watching paint dry.  I highly recommend Jennifer Galardi's Ballet Body if you're interested in having a dancer's physique AND enjoying your balletic workout, and if you want intense conditioning for lean muscles but don't mind something in the ""kinda boring"" category, try Core Fusion Collection.  This one will be donated to the library, I think.",1323043200,9,1053,4.695652173913044
3200094,5,B000WC38BO,"I bought this DVD because I wanted a more challenging workout for my legs, and boy did I get one! I worked out muscles I didn't even know I had. Even after doing it over a dozen times, my legs still shake by the end of the plie section. Definitely worth a try!",1321920000,,260,3.9245283018867925
3200095,5,B000WC38BO,"When I watched the DVD for the first time, I wasn't sure how effective it would be as far as cardio goes.  However, in the second half when she begins the jumping, I was pleasantly impressed.

So using it finally for the first time, even with the beginning work, i.e., the grande plies, I was like WOW!  This has quickly become one of my favorite DVDs.  The movements are lovely and elegant, and Ms. Gulan's voice is beautiful (just as is she) and her cue practice is easy to follow.  I've been using this DVD for almost two weeks now and weird as it seems, I feel like a ballerina right there in my living room.  I feel like I'm actually on ""stage"" :)  Shoulders are erect; legs and arms are nice and lean/long; abs constantly pulled in... perfect...

Get this DVD and stick with it.  It truly does streamline your entire body and it's relaxing, soothing and ""pretty""... and who doesn't want to be that?  Ha!  ;)",1321747200,6,913,4.375

3200102,2,B000WC38BO,"Elise, I hope you're reading this. I am so glad I got this DVD cheap, because I'm getting rid of it immediately.

I danced ballet for over ten years. In recent years, I've lost almost all of my flexibility. I tried yoga, but I hated it as I wasn't getting that familiar ""stretch"" I was used to in ballet.
I bought this DVD specifically to get the stretch I was used to in my thighs, calves, and back. It had a lot of good reviews, so I thought I was on the right track. Not so. From my years of dancing, I can tell you that you do NOT go into any form of kicking or jumping before you sit, stand, and hold to stretch the bejesus out of your legs. She is having you flick and kick your legs after doing a couple of plies! That's a surefire way for someone to get hurt!! I have absolutely no sort of stretch in my legs, just soreness from her making me do yoga moves and disguising them as ballet. And I didn't even dance professionally and I can tell you her form is horrible.

Long story short, THIS IS NOT BALLET, THIS IS YOGA. And the search for a good ballet dvd continues",1316995200,9,1075,4.042253521126761
3200113,3,B000WC38BO,This video does give you a good workout but to me the video was a little sleepy. I was sweating by the end of the video but it didn't leave me excited to do this work out again. All in all a good workout so if you don't mind slow paced music this is a great video.,1316736000,,264,3.6491228070175437
3200114,2,B000WC38BO,"As a complete beginner to ballet, this DVD was quite difficult to follow.  I expected the tutorial to give a basic introduction to ballet basics before going into the harder exercises, which it did not do.  The instructor, though pleasant enough, begins using technical terms within the first few minutes of the video, never explaining how positions should look and feel throughout the body.  She also does not thoroughly explain many of techniques.  For example, she will say 'Leg up, lift up', whereas I would like to know which muscles should be used and which you should be feeling, posture, and core positioning.  This is particularly irritating with most of the leg stretches, in which I'm not sure whether to push through my heels or through my toes, tighten hips or relax them, etc.

It seems more suited for people who have had some sort of ballet or dance training in the past, but I would not recommend it for absolute beginners who are looking for a step-by-step guide.",1316736000,12,981,4.775147928994083
3200115,5,B000WC38BO,"I have learned that ballet conditioning is one of the most effective kinds of exercises to work out the entire body at once, creating leaner legs, arms, and midsection.  I take a ballet conditioning class at my local YMCA twice an week, and then do this once a week or so.  My arms, which at 43 had begun to sag, have toned up, and my shoulders, while they do not look like Elise's yet, are looking much better in tank tops!  My legs are noticable stronger and have firmed up.  After doing this workout and the one at my gym I notice my arms and back are sore, as well as my legs.  The more often I do it the less sore I am, but I really notice it when I miss a week!  I am a pear shape, and I find there is not enough rear end work for me on the DVD, so at home I supplement with the ""behind and hip"" exercises from Callanetics (highly recommended as well).  A similar type of workout is The Bar Method, which I love as well - these types of workouts have made me more slender in my 40's than I was in my 20's and 30's, when I wore two clothing sized larger on the bottom half of my body because of my pear shape.  Now I wear one size, 4 or small.  None of the running, cycling, moving from one piece of gym equipment to the next, aerobic type classes - ever managed to produce the results I have now.",1316131200,2,1302,3.9578544061302683

i like it better than pilates now too, because the abs part at the end is helpful, but it just helps your core throughout the workout once you realize to always use it for power.
it was very tough to get through at first, and made me sore, but im now getting used to it, and i love it! its nice for when you don't feel like doing cardio workouts.",1315180800,3,526,4.166666666666667

I really liked the workout, it's 45/50 minutes long and it went by pretty fast.  The first portion was standing ballet leg work with a chair.  Even though I don't know the ballet terms I still could do it, she gave good instruction and you can easily see her feet and arms to mimic her.  The second portion (a bit shorter than the first portion, which is fine) is on the floor, which was pilates core work.  I feel it really balanced out the workout.  Overall, I thought it was a pretty good workout.  Probably not a workout I'm going to do on a weekly basis but I will definitely keep it in my dvd rotation to help me train muscles that I usually don't use.",1313884800,2,807,4.269736842105263
3200120,5,B000WC38BO,"I have purchased several ballet dvd's, and this by far is one of my favorites. Even though I have a portable ballet barre at home, I love the fact that she encourages the use of regular household items, such as a chair, or counter to help with balance. Her cuing is great, and she makes the simplest movements look so beautiful and graceful. I watched the dvd first to see what it was about. I looked easy, but upon doing it you will see that it really works your body. Ballet uses your body weight as resistance. I would reccomend this dvd to anyone looking to achieve the lean look of a dancer, but I have to add that you may want to start off slowly and build up to the whole dvd because it will wear you out quickly! Enjoy your purchase:)",1313625600,,742,4.195804195804196
3200121,3,B000WC38BO,This workout is mainly barre work which is good. It could have more variation gets a bit intense. I was crying out for more stretching inbetween the exercises and could definitly do with more floor barre and stretching at the end. It wasn't a well rounded workout for me.

I didn't need tons of room for grapevines like in other cardio/workout videos, I just needed a little leg space.  By the middle of the video, my legs were shaking very hard and really maxing out their muscle potential, it felt great.  It felt like I was in ballet toning class again.  I haven't had ballet in years, yet it wasn't too hard that I couldn't do it.  I think it would still provide a great workout for someone who dances every day.  the fact that I didn't feel murdered by the end of it means I am much more likely to keep up with it each week.

It starts with a short warm up.  Then there's a nice barre section.  You use a chair which works fine.  There's a center section which I skip due to lack of room (and not wanting to wake my house up with a bunch of jumping!).  The core workout is tough.  It ends with some stretching.

I love this DVD.  It reminds me of my dancing days.  It is definitely the most challenging workout DVD that I own.  A ballet background would be helpful, but not required.  If you're like me, and you're a former student, you will love this.  The instructor explains things well and is very positive.

There were comments about the music.  It is bad, but it's mostly just ""background music"", so it doesn't bother me too much.",1311033600,2,896,4.33939393939394

I bought this dvd for my physical therapist and she loves it  A good friend of mine who works out daily also bought the dvd after borrowing mine.

I really like the pace of the movements.  The instructor is excellent and very focused.  I enjoy this more than yoga and feel very calm (after my muscles stop burning)!!",1310860800,,652,4.217741935483871

I take ballet classes occasionally, and am pretty horrible at it, but I love the look of ballet dancers and aspire to that longer, leaner silhouette. This video did a good job of replicating the ballet class experience - it's very graceful and well sequenced.  But you definitely feel the work; there's a point halfway through where I can barely keep my arm up and the thought of one more port de bras is scary!

Some of the reviews noted that there is a voiceover for most of the workout and that Elise doesn't actually speak during the workout and that seemed totally weird to me before I did it.  But it was really natural and she cued well.  I always knew what to expect and everything just built on what had come before.

So I decided to try this DVD to continue my ballet practice at home. It is very similar to the format that was used in my beginning ballet class. The DVD is more challenging and also incorporates core strengthening. I am an intermediate Pilates/Yoga student and this DVD still gives me challenges I can work up to.

I was initially hesitant when I put it in b/c of the way the instructor was speaking- kind of fake and monotoned... but once she started it.. it was great! It was narrated by her while watching her full body move throughout the rountine. I really loved it. I can't wait to make time between the kids to do it again b/c I felt my posture improved and I love how everytime I got tired and wanted to give up, she'd talk about either finding the joy in the dance or moving at your own capabilities.

I started this video after a knee injury and wanted to gain strength as quick as possible (I'm impatient!). At first, Attitudes and Rond de Jambe's just about killed me, but a good month of practice I amazed myself at the height I could get.

The first day I simply watched about half of this video to get inspired.  I think that was a good technique because I couldn't wait to begin the next day, and I found the series of exercises easier to follow since I'd watched them first.  Elise is a lovely instructor and I appreciate that she uses ballet terminology (I don't have a dance background) and encourages good posture, graceful extensions and artistic expression throughout the workout.  Even I, with my big baby bump, felt graceful doing this workout.  And I also felt comfortable modifying my way through.  I did skip out on the jumps (modifying with ""bounces"") and my flexibility is still very low. But I trust Elise's assurance that I'm going to get stronger and more limber each time I do this series of exercises.  My legs were literally wobbling as I finished the workout the first time, and my arms felt warm and challenged by the ballet postures used throughout.  Immediately, I experienced improvement in my posture, core strength, and soundness of sleep.  I actually feel like I'm carrying my baby in a more graceful alignment and my back no longer hurts!!!

3200172,5,B000WC38BO,"I love this DVD, it's a great, low impact workout that really hits all areas of my body and has helped improve my posture.  It's easy to look at some on the moves she does and think it looks too easy, and wouldn't be an effective workout; in reality, if you're concentrating on holding your body in dancer's position the whole time, it really is a good burn, especially in your legs (that squat plie sequence is a killer on my thighs.)  The key is you can't just go through the movements, you have to really concentrate on contracting your muscles, standing straight and strong and moving your body purposefully.

This DVD is not for anyone looking for a hardcore workout, or dancing instruction, it's for someone who wants to tone their body like a ballet dancer and enjoy the graceful, elegant moves that build the burn slowly.  It's not a cardiovascular workout per se, like a Turbo Jam would be, but I surprisingly find myself having to catch my breath several times throughout and I'm in good shape.  For me, it gets my heart rate up enough to burn the fat, but not to the point of exhaustion (I'm in pretty good shape and workout regularly - I've done P90X, Turbo Jam, Tae Bo, etc.)

For me, this workout soothes me similar to yoga or pilates, so it's a nice addition to all my other DVDs.",1306540800,3,1295,4.443037974683544

Elise is the most relaxingly motivating person I have ever had on a workout video. The movements are great, and challenging. After about 85 days (doing this every day except Sunday) I had lost 45lbs and felt beautiful again. My posture was outstanding, my self esteem was soaring, and I couldn't wait to do the video every day.
This is a truly beautiful routine that you feel good doing, and at the end you cannot wait for Elise to point out that you ARE a little leaner than when you began. Genius motivating statement!

I now have a 1 year old, and have put back on some of the weight, and now that we're moved and settled, its what I cannot wait to do. This video is going to save me once again...and I'm stoked. How often can you say that about a video?

I can't name a muscle in my body that isn't feeling it the next day.  Most workout DVDs I have tried will work some area of the body, but this is a full body workout at its best.  Also, it is excellent if you don't have a lot of money to spend on expensive equipment or gym membership--it only requires a chair...my only suggestion is that women make sure they are wearing a good sports bra while doing the workout as the jumps can be a little intense.  Overall, I felt every bit as worked out as when I go the actual gym without having to leave the comfort of my living room...or my two sleeping children.",1305072000,7,851,4.2024539877300615

3200196,4,B000WC38BO,She makes it look easy...but it's not. The beautiful background and her sweet voice or misconceiving. After about 5 minutes you realize this work out is not as easy as it looks. I have a love/hate relationship with it. It really works you out and you will quickly see yourself able to stretch and extend. I am sore the next day after every work out. The only con is that I wish it had more of an upper body work out.,1303776000,,416,4.148148148148148
3200197,5,B000WC38BO,"This video is a great workout! This was my first barre exercise video, and I loved this one. She has you stand just like a ballet dancer. She moves slow enough so you can keep up, but fast enough to make your heart pump.  She has you hold your arms in proper ballet form. The next few days after doing this video, my muscles were tired. It's a great video!!!",1302566400,,358,4.114285714285714
3200198,5,B000WC38BO,"I love this dvd. It is not a cardio workout, but a super effective toning workout. The scenery is beautiful. Elise is very pleasant, as is the music. I like her narration vs. her trying to talk and do the movements. It was definitely a challenge for my legs, they quiver during the first segment. My legs feel great after doing it. After three weeks of doing it three times a week(along with Weight watchers), and nothing else(I have an infant),my pants are too big. I had lost weight through diet alone, but my clothes didn't fit differently until I started this workout. If I could fit in cardio,too,I am sure the results would be amazing. My mom was visiting and did it with me, we immediatately ordered her a copy after our first workout. I do think anybody can do it, but if your a begginer don't expect to be able to lift your leg as high as she can. It has a lot of a pilates element to it, with a ballet twist. A lot more enjoyable to me than my pilates workout dvds. Element did a great job with this dvd and I will checkout other titles by them.",1301616000,4,1055,4.227722772277228
3200199,3,B000WC38BO,"This video is really more of a fusion of ballet, Pilates and yoga than straight ballet: it's not like the ballet classes I remember.  The music is cheesy, new age garbage.  I don't understand why they couldn't use a more classical ballet score.

The exercises are difficult if you are out of shape like I am.  This is partly caused by the slowness of the exercises (like yoga).  There is very little movement---she seems to be concentrating much more on ""core"" (as in Pilates) than dance.  This is a workout, not a prep for dancing.  I wish I could find a more classical dvd that's really based on ballet.",1301443200,,605,4.495412844036697
3200200,5,B000WC38BO,"A surprisingly great ballet-driven exercise routine, even for those with years of ballet training like me.  It's perfect for those who have been out of the ballet class loop for a while and want to get back into dancing shape.",1301443200,,226,4.65
3200201,5,B000WC38BO,"A little about me: I bought this DVD because I was seriously out of shape. I have a little dance/ballet experience, but not much. I also have scar tissue around both my knees and if I do too much I definitely feel it. However, having done ballet in the past I also knew that it's one of the best ways for getting in shape, so I was excited to find this DVD.

The first time I did it, it was pitiful. I managed about 20 minutes before I gave up and laid on the floor pouring sweat for a while. The next time I did about half the reps of everything and skipped a couple of the hardest exercises, but made it through to the end. That was 6 weeks ago, and I've been doing Ballet Conditioning at least 3x a week since then. Just in the last few weeks I've finally worked up to doing all the exercises in the recommended reps, but even before that I noticed definite changes in my body. My saggy butt moved back where it belongs; my pants are noticeably baggier (especially my thighs); my tummy is losing fat, gaining definition, and developing some impressive ab muscles; my arms and shoulders are also gaining definition and developing muscles without looking like a muscle-man. Can I chalk it all up to this DVD? Probably not. I alternate this with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Quick-Fix-Stability-Ball-Workout/dp/B001CDFXRO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Quick Fix: Stability Ball Workout</a>&nbsp;(my ""lazy"" days) and go for daily walks, but I think this deserves much of the credit for my recent 10Lb weight loss.

Even though the workout is almost an hour in length, and physically demanding I never get bored with it, and like Elise Gulan says several times throughout it, the more muscle strength and flexibility you gain the more of a workout you get. I love her as an instructor because she's not at all obnoxious; no irritating cheerleader-y pep talks, and excellent cuing. She's definitely encouraging, but it's not fake or overdone.

One thing that I have noticed is that some people say this is tough on knees. I'm far from being an expert, but I can see how if you're not doing the exercises correctly it could be very painful. If you're turning out into first position from your knees instead of your hips, or not using your muscles to control your landings during the jumping section it will definitely hurt. That may be the only way in which having a little ballet experience pays off, but I don't think it's that hard to learn.

I do have one complaint about this DVD: I wish the beginning warm-up was a little longer and had a greater variety of stretches. I did just the stretches contained on the DVD the first half dozen times I used it, and it was fine; I didn't hurt myself or anything from lack a longer warm-up. However, I know my body well enough to know that's not enough for me, so I spend about 10 minutes doing stretches before I even start the DVD. I find that doing that allows me to get much deeper into the workout. But that's my body and of course everyone's is different, which is why I'm not knocking a star off over it. Overall though this is definitely my favourite workout, and I highly recommend it if you're looking to tone your muscles and lose weight.",1301443200,16,3234,4.658493870402802
3200202,4,B000WC38BO,I bought this before I found out I was pregnant. It's a nice and calming video. There are times that I prefer a relaxing workout instead of going to the gym and using machines and weights. This is a great alternative.,1301184000,,217,4.317073170731708
3200203,5,B000WC38BO,"With several ballet conditioning exercises available it can be a difficult choice, but this is one of the best I've used. I have limited ballet experience but that is no matter with this DVD. It's easy to follow with instructions and counts, only hindrance for me was the inability to follow the rear leg lifts exactly. However I expect this to not be an issue with time and practice. The core workout was great! I could handle a bit more of it though. I expect to use it every other day in between cardio and weights.",1300838400,,518,4.40625
3200204,4,B000WC38BO,"This is almost the perfect combination of instruction, difficulty and pace for my first ballet workout excursion. Almost perfect because I could have used slightly more instruction throughout the workout. Even adding more instructions on how to stand in first position (Do you tuck your hips under? Should you turn your thighs in when in first position?) would be helpful, especially for those who have no prior training in ballet.

Nonetheless, the workout overall is still excellent. The program is fun and goes by very quickly (about 50 minutes in total). You are taken through a series of ballet exercises that really challenge your flexibility and if performed correctly (hence, a little more instruction on stance and form would be helpful) should sculpt and define muscles. You definitely feel this happening. One thing I love about this workout is that you only need a chair for balance (unless you have a ballet barre at home) so it is very ""portable"" (in all senses of the word).

One thing to note: this program is mainly focused on core and lower body (hence, the name of the video..ballet conditioning). There are technically no upper body exercises with the exception of keeping your arm in ballet-like poses for each series. After a while, your arm muscles will start to ache and feel like they are being worked out because gravity will be calling. Not that this is a bad thing but if you are looking for a workout that includes actual upper body exercises, this is not it. However, if you want to set your lower body and core on fire in a graceful and delicate manner, I would strongly recommend this video.",1300752000,13,1623,4.792857142857143
3200236,5,B000WC38BO,"It's a helpful exercise for those trying to improve their posture and push the limits of flexibility. While she makes you work hard, Gulan does it with a grace of a ballerina, making the workout more pleasant and less stressful. She explains every move, but doesn't stop to talk -- no time wasted.
My only criticism of the workout is that it can be hard on knees.
For those unfamiliar or new to ballet conditioning, I would suggest practicing yoga and/or pilates with lots of stretching prior to trying Gulan's workout. While one will become more flexible after a few sessions of ballet conditioning, prior stretching and strength-building will help make the most out of this workout and in less time.",1300492800,,701,4.801652892561983
3200237,3,B000WC38BO,"First of all, I grew up with the Vaganova ballet system and danced for over 15 years and am therefore used to a very clean and strict execution of ballet exercises - Elise Gulan has a lot of strength and stamina but I was and still am very surprised to hear that she used to be a classical dancer: The way she carries out some of the typical ballet exercises is way too sloppy for my liking; I believe that is also the reason why her leg muscles appear to be overly bulky on the thighs (you won't ever see that on a female Russian dancer for example. It's a sign for using incorrect turnout over years and as a result the muscles aren't stretched properly).

However, her ballet conditioning is challenging and certainly strength building - if done properly - and therefore I'm giving it 3 stars. Also I would have appreciated classical music in the background.",1300406400,10,861,4.449367088607595
3200238,5,B000WC38BO,"I bought this video to supplement an adult beginner's ballet class I'm taking. It does address some basic moves and use proper terminology, but it's really designed to help you gain strength and balance to improve your ballet practice (or get a 'ballet body'), not actually teach you how to dance ballet.

It's all balance and body weight training, and it really heats you up. The majority of the video is done standing, with the aid of a chair for balance, but it ends with a floor segment of really killer pilates abs moves and gentle stretching. The exercises look really easy when the dancer does them, but trust me, you will break a serious sweat.

The setting is pleasant and the dancer has aspirational form -- and abs! It's helpful to have some background with ballet, just for the sake of getting the form right, but you can probably figure it out if you pay close attention to the dancer. Form is one thing the video really doesn't address at length.

I like that the directions are given through a voiceover, instead of having the dancer talk you through things. It makes cuing much easier. The narrator isn't annoying or overly encouraging either; she says things like ""find joy in the movement"" and ""concentrate on your practice,"" but mostly she just tells you what to do.

I've done tons of videos, including most of Jillian's Michaels'. I'm also a long-distance runner and consider myself to be moderately to extremely fit, and I must say this workout had me shaking and sweating by the end. Highly recommended!",1300320000,2,1526,4.704119850187266

I recommend that if you're a raw beginner to take this slowly and in segments. While it may not leave you panting, it will definitely give your muscles a fat burning workout as it lengthens and strengthens them.
Already I have adopted a healthier posture and seen results.  While a newcomer to the art of ballet can gain a great deal from this video, some knowledge of basic ballet movements is probably preferable.",1299196800,,747,4.492647058823529

3200257,4,B000WC38BO,"""Ballet Conditioning"" is surprisingly good- the exercises are easy to follow, but have immediate effects.  Despite being fit, my heart rate and temperature were quickly elevated by this DVD!

While the ""New York City Ballet"" DVD provides a greater assortment of exercises combined with brief dance routines, I found ""Ballet Conditioning"" provides a better workout.  With this DVD, the exercises focus on your entire leg or core, rather than engaging small muscle groups.  This results in a good combination of cardio and strength training, and you feel a fairly complete workout.  While you aim for a precise movement, you will still feel the benefits even as you learn the technique.  All repetitions are shown for both sides of the body, so you don't need to pause the DVD to complete your sets.

In contrast, the NYCB DVD tends to focus on strengthening and refining small muscle groups.  The exercises are helpful for a dancer who already has strength and flexibility... and who has a low enough body fat percentage to show off these muscles.  Only a couple of repetitions of each exercise are shown (making it difficult if you don't have a ballet background) and only on one side of the body.  In order to use the NYCB DVD, you constantly need to pause the DVD to do your repetitions, switch sides, hold a stretch etc.

The New York City Ballet DVD is a great resource for anyone who already has a ballet background and wants to learn more exercises or stretches on their own.  For someone looking for a good overall workout and an eventual ballet body, ""Ballet Conditioning"" is a better addition to your collection.",1298592000,8,1621,4.812274368231047

This workout certainly challenged my muscles, made my legs shake (not a usual thing for me) and stretched me. I have been doing the workout for two weeks three times a week, and noticed more ab definition, my butt is tighter and my posture is better. I stand taller now which visually makes me look thinner. What's great about the ballet conditioning is that it doesn't add bulk to your thighs, which is my problem zone. Too much weight lifting made muscles in my thighs look bigger than they should.
Pluses: the instructor doesn't waste a lot of time explaining things. She just goes through the motions and explains everything as she goes. Saves you a lot of time.
  Challenging workout
  It is somehow relaxing and I look forward to it, unlike boring weight lifting.
  Really elongates your muscles and makes you stand taller.

Minuses: I wish there were more stretching exercises.
  This is not a ballet class type exercise. You won't learn how to jump in the air and spin on your toes while holding your other leg parallel to the floor.

Overall, a challenging, slimming and satisfying workout you wouldn't want to miss. I don't think it's for those who want to loose weight - I didn't notice a number on my scale drop, but it's for those who want to look thinner while weighting the same.",1297209600,5,1515,4.598513011152416

Best of all for me is that it's barefoot.  Bellydancers dance (for the most part) in bare feet, and workouts with tennis shoes don't help strengthen your feet much.  This workout is not only done in bare feet, it includes optional variations on many moves that have you rising to the ball of your foot, which helps strengthen the foot itself.  Since many bellydance moves are done on the ball of the foot, this is amazingly helpful in helping the dancer condition the body for those moves.

3200279,4,B000WC38BO,"WHO THIS WORKOUT IS AND ISN'T FOR:

-I think this workout is worthy of 5 stars, but I knocked one star off because the description doesn't make it clear that this workout is NOT for those who have no ballet experience.  The instructor keeps you moving and does not stop to explain the steps or discuss proper form.  If you don't know the basics already, you'll be lost and you could hurt yourself.

-Speaking of injuries, this workout (or any ballet program) is not good for anyone with bad knees.

-If you are a serious dancer, this is probably not for you either.  You will likely find it too easy and will have criticisms of the instructor's form.  Element makes workout videos (Yoga and Pilates mostly), they do not specialize in ballet.

-Now, if you're familiar with basic ballet and want a good workout, this IS for you.  I love it.

WHAT YOU NEED:

You need space to move freely and a chair to use as a barre (the instructor uses a chair, too).  There is a jumping section, so make sure there's nothing fragile around you.

SEQUENCE OF THE WORKOUT:

As others have described, the workout consists mostly of basic ballet barre work. You'll do plies, tendus, ronds de jambe, developpes, and so forth.  But the emphasis is on conditioning your body, so the combinations are very challenging physically.  There's a brief section of floor work (battements and sautees), a VERY INTENSE abdominal workout (which seemed to me to be Pilates-inspired), and a brief stretch at the end.

WHY I LIKE IT:

I like to use ballet as part of my exercise routine because, like yoga and Pilates, it combines strengthening exercises with stretching and leaves me invigorated.  This video in particular is CHALLENGING.  The first few times I tried it, I couldn't do it all the way through without stopping for momentary breaks.  The ab workout at the end took me weeks to be able to do without stopping.  The challenge leaves me with a great sense of accomplishment and very strong legs!

I also think the scenery is beautiful, but not too busy too distract your focus away from your workout.  The instructor's voice-over can be annoying at times, but I can live with that.

A NOTE ABOUT THE INSTRUCTOR'S BODY TYPE:

I've read a few comments here about the instructor's body (specifically, the fact that she talks about the long, lean lines of a ballet dancer's body, while she is much more muscular than a ballerina).  According to the information on the DVD case, the instructor is a former principal soloist for a ballet company, but currently a ""certified personal trainer and instructor of Yoga, Core Fusion, and Core Energy Flow."" (I have no idea what those last 2 are).  That explains her current body type.  Anyway, let's be honest, nothing is going to give you a ballerina's body except becoming a ballerina.  The workout on this DVD is not gonna do that.  It will however, help you develop strength and flexibility.",1294963200,17,2911,4.6936758893280635
3200280,5,B000WC38BO,"The setting is what almost looks like a country club or an outdoor wedding plaza. It's next to a pool with pillars, landscaped with flowers, and located conveniently next to the ocean. I actually really like the location they picked for the exercise. It beats a studio lit by florescent lighting. Everything has a contemporary feel that makes it relaxing and fresh.

My legs kill during the plis, and that burn feels oh so good! I want to say over half the DVD features barre work, or in this case, chair work. The chair is nice and does the job. There is a lot of exercise and heat building in the legs and butt during exercises with the chair. Trust me. It kills.

The camera changes often so you're not bored of looking at the same old thing all the time. It also zooms in and shows a majority of her body so you can compare your movements to hers.

This is an excellent workout. It does exactly what it says it will do and does so very nicely. The camera made it easy for me to mimic her moves. The instructor does a nice job and can clearly accomplish the moves she asks of us. She's happy but not sickeningly so. By the end of the day, I feel properly worked out.",1294963200,4,1169,4.233183856502242

The work is difficult, especially for a beginner, but the instructor constantly reminds you that it is ok to do the exercises to the best of your ability as it is the ""intention"" of the movement that works. I could feel muscles working that I don't think i've used before, and I felt really accomplished when i was done. My only complaint is that she KEPT TALKING!!! the entire time. She was very motivating and what she said was not annoying, but still, i would have appreciated a silent moment or two to help focus.

3200297,4,B000WC38BO,"I also bought the New York City Ballet Workout dvd set along with this one. This dvd is a lot better, she's in a nice sunny location, there's some soothing background music, and she does a pretty good job of keeping you motivated to keep going.

It's kind of strange and surreal following along because even through some of the tougher positions, she is ALWAYS smiling, she NEVER stops smiling, the entire time. That's just not really human.

Anyway, I have the same complaint here regarding dance workouts. When you see her, the first thing you see is how HUGE her thighs are. They are pure, huge, muscle. And the first thing I'm thinking in my head when I start this workout, is that I will never ever want thighs like that. Of course, the workouts are all about the legs, drawing power and relying completely on the thighs to get through all the positions.

So, overall it's decent. It's a lot better than the New York City Ballet workout, that's for sure. But if you're not a dancer, and you just want to workout and kind of look like a svelte ballerina, then I don't think this is the right workout. I do feel like my posture's improved a bit though.",1294099200,2,1155,4.438679245283019
3200298,4,B000WC38BO,"Wow! This workout video is phenomenal! From the very beginning, you are drawn into the beautiful surroundings, the calm music, and the gorgeous instructor. The warm up is simple and supple but it doesn't tire you out or make you feel completely ridiculous. Once the warm up is complete, the chair is used for a series of ballet steps that elongate your whole body, specifically the leg. Then it goes into floor work where balance is key here to elongate the whole body. Once these movements are done, the video moves to jumps that lasts for several minutes. And then the abdominal movements inspired by pilates and then the stretches.

 This nearly hour long video doesn't feel like an hour. I've done it twice now and every time it feels like time just flies. I love to work out and I've the whole P90x collection but I would rather do this video over the P90x for various reasons. First of all, I feel like p90x just exhausts me to the point that I just want to sleep all day and eat my whole fridge. Secondly, a lot of the movements build bulk and require weights and various objects. AND it is really expensive. The Elements video doesn't feel like I'm about to kill myself but it feels like I'm still working my muscles and even sweating. My legs shake a lot and my arms hurt from keeping them positioned in the air for so long. But the end result is that I feel stretched, enlivened, and great. What I have decided to do is just do a little bit of p90x to get my heart rate going and then do this video and Ballet Bootcamp and the NYC ballet conditioning.

Overall, I'm very pleased with this video. The only thing I wish for is that she gives more instruction on how to position the body for each move so I don't hurt myself. I have loads of fun with it and with my mother (who yells at me everytime for making her do the work out, but she loves it much more than anything else she's ever done).

Hope you like it and its worth the money!",1294012800,2,1945,4.291553133514986
3200299,5,B000WC38BO,"I want to start taking ballet classes again, but I'm SO rusty.  I needed something to take Me through the basics and this does exactly that.  You WILL get your heart rate up even though it's not ""aerobic"" so much.  From having to control the body and pay attention to form you get a great workout.

If you have taken ballet before and know to get into the right position, this is great.  I can see if you have never taken ballet before that you might not know all the muscles to be engaging and then doing 50% of what should be going on.  But it's still great.  I like Ballentone center moves as well.",1293667200,2,601,4.173913043478261
3200300,5,B000WC38BO,"Initially, I became interested in ballet workout after observing that many people in ballet classes in my local gym had beautifully toned arms. Their arms were defined and lean yet elegant and feminine - very different from the arms of weight lifters (think Madonna) or even these of experienced yoga instructors.

The DVD offers one workout sequence, composed of the following subsections:
-Warmup/ballet stretching
-Lower body strengthening with ballet movements (plies, eleves, tendus, developes, leg lifts, attitudes)
-Jumps (1st, 2nd, and 5th positions)
-Abdominal work (non ballet workout on the floor such as scissoring of legs)
-Cool down stretch

You may ask, ""where is the upper body workout""? Well, the beauty of the ballet exercise is that there is no need for a separate upper body section, because your arms are working very hard throughout the entire workout (except for the abdominal section), through port de bras, extending of the arms to the sides and overhead. This is a very effective and different way of toning your arms than lifting weights.

Elise maintains a warm, encouraging tone throughout the workout, which does not intimidate a beginner but does not annoy a more advanced user, either. Her comment during the cool down summarizes the tone; ""if you can fold (forward) only few inches, that is beautiful. Because it is an honest expression of where you are today with your exercise"".

If you are looking for a different and effective arms toner, try this DVD. You won't regret.",1293580800,2,1507,5.1138211382113825

The setting is really sunny and makes me feel happy, even when I'm thinking ""I'm gonna die"" inside!  I also really benefitted from Elise's regular use of encouraging words!  Very pleased overall.  The only drawback (and the reason I took off one star) is that the music has a mild sort of ""Dollar-store compilation"" feel  but I wouldn't call it a huge detractor.

That put me off. I thought, ""if i do these exercises, am I gonna have Charles Atlas thighs?"" I also didn't like the fact that while it is based on ballet moves, they don't really tell you much about the moves themselves- is this based on a battement tendu? I want to know these things which is why I gravitated towards a workout with ballet in the title. I will say, however, that I did break a sweat, and felt like I was gonna barf about halfway through.

3200320,4,B000WC38BO,"I have been using this DVD for over 2 months now. I agree with other reviewers that the music is a bit institutional, but the music aside, the DVD and the workout it offers is awesome. I am not a big fan of home exercise DVDs (I'd rather hit the gym) but this DVD is an exception. I love it because it certainly works!

It's a great lower body toner and I saw the results (more defined, thinner legs, flatter tummy and a perkier rear end) in just a few sessions. It helps if you can practice in front of the mirror as it will ensure that your form is on point.

Although there is a little cardio episode within this workout, note please that this DVD will not replace your regular cardio routine. However, it's a great compliment to running, biking, etc. I feel like if one runs 4-5 times a week and does this ballet workout 3-4 times a week, one will be all set.

The workout itself without the final stretches lasts about 45-50 minutes. Anyone can do it. Although, I must say it probably helps if you're already in some sort of shape and not too hamstrung.

I first borrowed this DVD from a local library but loved it so much that I purchased one on Amazon.

Since I am terrible about sticking to a weightlifting routine I thought I'd give this a try. I used to do gymnastics so I love getting back to stretching. The way Elise helps you work your muscles, with the combination of stretching, repetitions and focus, it is unlike anything I've ever done. I am beginning to understand the physiology and how dancers muscles are developed. I can't believe I don't dread putting this DVD in after a run, I actually look forward to seeing if I can see improvement in my stamina and flexibility, best of all I feel better about my posture & body awareness, even when I'm not working out...something many athletes never realize.

It's not that I like elevator music, it's just that elevator music can be ignored, and this music has too much of a beat to be ignored.  So, if you find music with a boring repetitious beat annoying, be forewarned: This not only isn't nice classical music, it's not neutral either.  I've adopted the same solution as the previously mentioned reviewer; MUTE it and listen to something else.  The workout itself is fine, although I'm sure I was missing some of the nuances with the mute button on.  I do recommend this workout unless you dislike music with a steady thump.  Also, I don't know if it's just the camera angle, but the instructor seems to have very large thighs for a ballet dancer.

3200382,3,B000WC38BO,"I haven't taken ballet since I was about 8 years old and I wasn't very good then.  I'm not sure what possessed me to request this DVD as a gift.  All I can say is I must have been temporarily insane.  I'm 5'11"" and 30 lbs overweight.  If I couldn't do this stuff when I was 8 and flexible, you can imagine what it is like now.  All I've done so far is watch the whole video and I'm more than a little intimidated.  I suspect I'll have to focus on mastering the first chapter before trying to move onto the next.  Watching without doing was kind of boring but doing might just make me pass out. The moves look simple enough but moving your arms and legs with control while flexing your core isn't as easy as it looks.  This really isn't for ""out of shape"" beginners like me.  Oh well, all I can do is try and hope that I'll eventually be able to do the whole DVD.",1272585600,,862,4.023529411764706
3200383,5,B000WC38BO,"This DVD was a great choice for me; it involves strengthening, conditioning, fine and precise movements, a bit of Pilates for core strengthening, and a casual practice atmosphere. It also has a much better flow and is more fun to do than the NYC Ballet Workout (though these DVDs also have their own strengths as a ballet workout). Even though some may have thought Gulan's DVD workout is not ""traditional"" enough as a ballet workout, I can accept it for what it essentially is: a workout based on ballet movement. First and foremost, it is meant to be an exercise routine, and in this respect it succeeds sufficiently. I did break into a slow sweat (not heart-pounding cardio, but one is definitely burning calories and working the muscles of the legs intensely). It is a wonderful, relatively low-impact workout that makes one feel like one has actually worked out, but not to the extent as to make it impossible to walk a day afterwards. I like that the movements are not abrupt, jarring to the limbs, or involve vigorous momentum for their execution. For my purposes, this DVD workout does indeed serve its purpose. There may not be much of an upper-body workout involved, but most ballet doesn't actually involve a lot of upper-body work; it's all based on creating a lean upper-body over time via graceful poise and ""port-de-bras"". I can do yoga or Pilates for more upper body work, or even weight-lifting if I want (though I'd like to de-bulk my upper-body from years of weight-lifting instead of making my arms bigger). No twisting, pulling, or harsh positioning on the joints is involved, and so would suit those who have lower back or neck problems (though the Pilates core-strengthening in the end might be difficult for those who have weaker abdominal muscles). I'll be using this one to alternate with my other workout DVDs in the future.",1272412800,4,1851,4.80564263322884

This workout gives me the feeling (literally) that I can. I work out at the gym 4-5 times a week and do other workout dvd's so I  am not a stranger to exercise. But this one is tough! She never stops, just keeps going through exercise after exercise working every muscle in your legs thighs butt and hips. Meanwhile, your arms are raised most of the time. It's hard to do all of this. She gives you ways to protect your knees but I haven't done most of the little jumps she has you do toward the end because I'm not convinced my knees won't suffer later. So I skip that part but by then you've been working out for at least 30 min anyway. But I think she did a great job with the dvd and workout. The scenery is pleasant, her voice is pleasant and instructive, and you feel it burning. Have not lost a pound but it has toned me and taken off inches because my pants wouldn't stay up the other day and this is the only thing I'm doing differently after 3 weeks.

I have a gym membership but struggle to get there more than once or twice a week so the rest I do at home - its quick and easy to pop a DVD in.  I usually favour high impact aerobics but like to do toning as well, yet I haven't found pilates or yoga enjoyable, classes yes, but not dvd's - I find it impossible to stand upside down, whilst concentrating on my breathing and trying to look at a tv screen at the same time!

However, I found this 2 days ago online and ordered it as I trained in ballet and other dancing for around 13 years, but haven't done any ballet for 20 years - well, like one other reviewer says on here, initially I was taken back to childhood memories....then I realised just how much hard work it was!  I could hear my dance teachers words in my head telling me to not have sloppy arms and breathe in, hold my bum in etc so in addition to the small but very intense exercises/movements in the dvd, I was also trying to remember technique.  This isn't necessary but it can help.  Overrall I just wanted to say how shocked I was that having done it for the first time last night, my thighs are aching so much due to the good workout they got.  At the same time it was hugely relaxing and I will be putting this dvd on again tomorrow night.....just as soon as my legs have had a break!

This is definitely a good workout, but I think I like workouts with a lot more movement. Here, you do a lot of repetitions of these ballet movements while standing still. Although you are supposed to be using your core muscles, I just didn't feel satisfied after the workout. There were definitely a couple exercises I had trouble completing, so it's obviously hard work! However, I live in an apartment so I don't like jumping around a lot and bugging my downstairs neighbors, so there were a few exercises I did halfway. Also, she uses a lot of terms that are new to me and I had no idea what they mean, so even after a couple times, I still don't know how to position my arms without watching her first.

The Gym just bulked them up and everything else I tried never gave me the definition or the cuts that my upper body seemed to get pretty quickly so I always felt unbalanced. I have always loved Ballet and yearned for a dancers long lean body. Especially their legs! I decided to try this video as a last ditch effort. I am amazed!

I'm not sure why, but I feel just plain good when I'm done ~ I stand taller, feel (if not look) graceful, and am more aware of my body and posture.  If you're looking for intense, high-impact, serious sweat-inducing cardio, this is not for you.  But if you want a lovely, fluid, yet challenging workout that will build lean muscle strength, increase balance, and leave you feeling serene and relaxed,  try this one.

1. She only speaks in the beginning the rest is voice over, That may be why she apparently cannot count. She'll say lets do 8 of these then she will do 10. For anyone who has done class before it hard when you are mentally counting for 8 then preparing for the next step and she doesn't go into it for another 2 counts.

2. Speaking of class, you will need to have done some ballet classes to understand what she is talking about and proper positioning. Not once does this video show a close up of her feet with proper pointing of the toes or how they should be touching on the floor or the turn out of the knees. Also she only touches on 5th position for jumps at the ending...not even explaining what 5th position is and without a close up of the feet if you don't know this position your guessing.

This is narrated in a very calm, supportive way. The presenter is very zen, vs. the jazzy energetic delivery of many other workouts. Traditional French ballet terms are used for an additional educational component. The presenter is graceful, but with a real butt and thighs, not stick-thin. She does not give a lot of direction on how to point toes or hold arms, which means if you are new to ballet it will take you a number of runs through this DVD before you start to feel graceful or get the most out of the workout. The camera angles are not always the best to understand exactly what her positioning is. Be careful on the deep knee bends with heels together!!

Only (overlookable) flaws- yes, she can crack walnuts with her thighs. I suppose that could be remedied a bit if she actually turned out when doing exercises devant (to the front- ie, her developpes, battements, attitudes, etc).

She is just trying to be encouraging, so we don't get discouraged when we can't do 1/10th of the stretching or whatever she can!  She seems so genuinely happy to be sharing this with you, and doing her best.

Very easy warm up, but does get very, very challenging!  Gives you an idea how far you have to go, and a goal, but you can skip some if you can't make it, of course.  She's like a ballet 'nazi' in the best way, its almost like ballet boot camp, so challenging.

The only thing I wish she added was more on proper posture or form, but I have an idea having taken some ballet classes.  IE keep your shoulders down and your butt tucked under.

I also recommend that you do some extra stretching afterwards (seems easier when your muscles are warm) because after all that work, you don't want them to get tight and short!

I am happy to report that Element Ballet Conditioning felt almost exactly right for my level.  Instructor Elise Gulan begins with an easy, 3-minute warm-up that consists of some very simple stretching moves such as reaching the arms overhead and standing forward bends.  She then asks you to step near your chair to begin the main workout.  Again, she starts off easy with relevs; these feel fairly gentle to begin.  However, Gulan starts to pick up the intensity in the next segment, which includes both demi- and grand-plis using the chair; she also performs a series of plis without the chair.

In series which follows, Gulan incorporates tendu, battement, and developp, performed all on one side and then repeated on the following side.  She then does the same with rond de jambe, knee circles (I don't recall the ballet name for this one), and grand rond de jambe.  The final standing series includes simple leg lifts to the front, side, and back and then attitudes to the front and the back.  Throughout the standing work, Gulan keeps the arms working as well, usually by holding them in a port de bras position.  The standing toning concludes at about the 35-minute mark, and then Gulan leads you through approximately 4 minutes of brief cardio in the form of mini jumps.  These moves are basically little hops--for example, jumping in first position, second position, from first to second, and switching the feet back and forth in fifth position.  Gulan concludes the standing segment with some additional leg lifts while in standing splits, performing a seated twist (half Lord of the fishes pose from yoga) between each side.

At this point, Gulan brings the session to the floor for approximately 5 minutes of intense, Pilates-inspired abs work.  Those familiar with Pilates will recognize moves such as the Pilates roll-up, single straight leg stretch (repeated twice), hip lifts, and single leg stretch.  In fact, because Gulan performs quite a high number of repetitions and offers little instruction, I would only recommend this segment to those who have prior experience with Pilates.  Gulan concludes the workout with approximately 4 minutes of stretching, performed mostly on the floor (butterfly stretch, wide-legged seated forward bend), although she does come to standing to finish, bringing in the total time for this workout at 49 minutes.

Overall, I definitely felt like I got what I wanted from this DVD:  a nice, challenging lower body workout with a short but intense little abs segment to boot.  I don't think that you need to have previous dance or ballet experience to do this workout, but I don't think that it's designed for beginning exercisers, either; also, as mentioned above, I would recommend the abs section only to those with some prior familiarity with Pilates.  Based on these factors, I would recommend this workout, and my final rating is 4.5 stars.",1256428800,10,3066,5.009861932938856

The workout is challenging without frustrating me, and you definitely feel it the next day!  Unlike the NYC ballet workout, I think even a person without a lot of ballet training could do this.  My only wish for this workout would be to have a shorter version of it when I don't have time to dedicate a full hour.  Right now I just do the first 20-30 minutes and shut it off if I need to, but it would have been nice if they had included a true abbreviated version.",1256169600,,606,4.016666666666667

3200492,5,B000WC38BO,"I found out about ballet conditioning  by accident and I don't know Elise's other work. However, I wanted a softer cross-training programme than my high impact aerobics dvds to co-ordinate with a half-marathon training programme. I'd done yoga and pilates and wanted to try something different. I wasn't sure if I'd get enough of a workout with ballet routines and was pleasantly surprised that I did. The low impact worked great for my sore legs and hips plus I loved the stretching. With this dvd, it was quick and easy to get in some stretching and cross-training - I didn't need to change into workout clothes and shoes or use alot props other than a chair. On a busy schedule, it is great. Love the grace of ballet. I'm relatively fit but I've never done ballet and I didn't get all the moves on the first try. However, the routines came readily with practice. The pacing is excellent. The scenery and visuals are calming.  Perfect after a long run day.

The only thing that I didn't like was the music.  It wasn't bad music, but it didn't seem like the steps were being done with the beat of it (and being in ballet before it was hard to ignore the music and do it in time with her).",1254355200,,399,3.888888888888889

I like to split the DVD up, doing a chapter or two 3 days/week, rather than the whole thing at once. This allows me to get used to the movement gradually without becoming sore. I pair a few chapters of this DVD with a walk outside, and I feel great!",1253664000,,493,4.301075268817204
3200495,5,B000WC38BO,"Buying exercise DVDs is always a bit of a gamble for me, so this review will attempt to give a good peek inside before you buy.
If you are looking to tone your legs and abs in a graceful manner, this is a good choice. It will make your legs work and you will definitely break a sweat, especially while doing the jumps.  Likewise, if you are looking to supplement your ballet 1 class, this features pseudo bar work: staples like plies, releves, rond de jambes, and changement jumps. No major floor work or combinations, and no real position correction for port-de-bras or posture, but then again it is a conditioning, not a ""dance the ballet,"" video, so that's not a real issue.
You will likely recognize a few stretches if you take yoga, and the moves from the abs floor work if you take pilates. The upright portion is about 35 minutes and the floorwork about 10. Other pros include beautiful scenery which is pleasant to look at while exercising, and that you really only need about a 6ft radius of space to do this workout. I found the instructor's affirmations to be a little cloyingly cheerful, but perhaps some need the constant motivation (and I suppose saying that a burning quad is just releasing energy can't hurt.)
Overall, a great bargain that I am glad I purchased.",1252540800,4,1278,4.580786026200873

This DVD includes standing leg lifts, circles (Ronde-de-Jam?)), jumps, squats, plies and lots more leg work.  If that's not enough, the ab workout is a great short workout all on its on.
The short cardio burst at the end is fun and entergetic and the stretching is relaxing after this tough workout.  The instructors cues perfectly(hold your abs in, keep your neck long, relax your face and shoulders, etc) and the music fits the DVD.  The scenery is fitting for this DVD also.

To the people who said that they had to do twice the exercises in the same amount of time: you weren't doing the exercises correctly.

Don't let it fool you - this is a TOTAL workout for your legs! It is also fun to learn some ballet moves and lingo. Also a workout for your arms as you keep them up in the air almost constantly.  A great addition to my workout library!,1250812800,,407,4.012345679012346
3200520,5,B000WC38BO,"I had hit a plateau in my workout routine where I was dieting and running and weightlifting and I could not manage to lose a pound! I had heard good things about this DVD and even though I'm not ballet trained (I know some dance, but it's definitely not the same) I figured 'Why not?' Ballet dancers always have amazing bodies and at the price I really didn't have much to lose. Not to mention I live with 2 other girls who are trying to lose weight so someone would use it if I didn't.

I DON'T REGRET THIS PURCHASE IN THE SLIGHTEST!!

It's a phenomenal workout. My flatmate and I were in pain for the next two days from doing this even after stretching ourselves out to impossibility. But it broke my plateau and now when I follow the DVD I don't hurt as much after. I probably will never be a limber, flexible prima ballerina, but it has definitely increased my flexibility and muscle tone, not to mention I feel blissed out and relaxed when I'm done. The moves are simple yet challenging, I never felt that what she was doing was something I couldn't attempt or understand. And she doesn't move so fast where I couldn't keep up. I highly reccommend this to those who need a break in their workout routine and still want a challenge!!",1249689600,6,1237,4.373913043478261
3200521,5,B000WC38BO,"I am a newcomer to ballet and bought this DVD to mix up my workout routine.  I'm certainly glad I did - this is a great lower body workout that leaves you feeling energized at the end.  The workout is composed of about 30 minutes with the barre (using a chair), 5 minutes of jumping, 10 minutes of Pilates-like ab work and 5 minutes of stretching. I felt the muscles in my thighs working deeper than I have worked them before.  They were actually shaking throughout the abdominal portion!  Furthermore, holding your arms up nearly continuously is great for sculpting your shoulders.  By the time I finished this DVD, I felt like my posture was a little better!

The instructor was pleasant, but the biggest downside to this workout is the cuing.  Being new to ballet, I can't follow instructions well without seeing the movement.  There are a few exercises where I had to stop, look at the screen, and rewind to the beginning of the movement.  I agree with some reviewers that not being as flexible as the instructor can be a bit frustrating.  However, she mentions multiple times that the intention of the movement is more important than how flexible you are.

Overall, I think this workout is a great change of pace for me.  I do think you need to be mindful of your joints throughout it, but it provides a great challenge otherwise.",1248912000,,1335,4.586497890295359
3200522,5,B000WC38BO,"I've NEVER taken a dance class in my life. I played softball instead of going to ballet or tap classes like my friends. Just recently I became interested in how dancers move, and condition their bodies for performance. I like this DVD because, while I'm not very graceful or as flexible as the instructor, afterward I feel relaxed and stronger. While doing the workouts I feel just the right about of strain without feeling bored or overwhelmed. It's a nice change of routine. I'm glad I came across this DVD.

Don't be intimidated by not being able to raise your legs as high as Elise, or move as graceful as she does. I was at first, but I feel with repeated practice, I'll get just as good! :-)",1248739200,,697,4.4453125
3200523,5,B000WC38BO,"I popped in this DVD today for a gentler workout. Ha ha! I run, swim, pilates, yoga. I considered myself in flexible and in decent shape, until TODAY... It's been a long time since anyone has had my legs start shaking halfway through a workout. Elise is stunningly beautiful and her soothing voice is encouraging. When she tells you to smile, I knew then for certain that ballerinas truly grin and bear it. This is a DVD that I will be using regularly.

This is relatively low impact, not a whole lot of crazy jumping. There is some jumping however, but no cutting motions that strain knee ligaments. Think one gentle squat to another. If you cannot squat at all, I would not recommend this DVD for you. You will also need a chair to help support with balance.

3200536,4,B000WC38BO,"This DVD workout has only basic play/chapter menu choices. High production (see youtube clips for presentation), this workout is more about fitness/toning/losing weight then it is about dance. Music is light, but it does at least have a fast tempo to keep you from getting bored.
Elise is only in voice over, sounds friendly & encouraging & she even uses a chair which she moves each time she switches sides. All her tips are only basic general terms about how to move, ballet name terms only, and vague to reminders to use your core muscles. She doesn't give any specific, or detailed instructions about how to turn out, avoid injury, etc. Anytime she talks that isn't about the above, she says ad nauseaum how a dancer's body is beautiful, how this workout will streamline your body, make you muscles stronger & help you lose weight. I took off a star for this annoyance, when she could be giving REAL tips.
I enjoy how Elise never has you repeat anything on the same side twice to keep you from getting bored, but since she usually starts with her left (your right if mirroring), she definitely spends more time on that side so the workout isn't even on both sides & you may want to pause to switch a bit to even out.
The workout itself maybe a slow pace, but it isn't for those who workout only rarely or have any lower joint, muscle issues or those who can't balance on one leg at long stretches. If you're looking for true ballet instruction, you won't find it here.
Workout:
2 min. trailer intro
3 min. of very graceful stretching
32 min of standing ballet work (occasional quick stretch here in there)
3 min of soft jumping in 1st, 2nd & switching feet ballet positions
2 min standing split & seated twist yoga pose break
5 min of reclined pilates, (roll ups, A LOT of leg scissors, hip lifts)
4 min cool down (butterfly, seated single wide leg stretch, seated wide leg side & fwd stretch) & ends w/graceful curtsy on both sides.

I felt my legs burning during this & felt my abs working from reminding myself to use my abs (she doesn't remind), and using more wide open arm position w/keeping my elbows up to tone my arms/shoulders so I can feel this everywhere. The next day my quads were a little sore & I felt a nice separation between my pelvis & rib cage, w/the upper torso feeling more floaty on my spine & feeling the muscles of my abs/obliques much more how they really stabilize the body.

It is also broken down into chapters so if you are short on time, you can make the workout shorter.  This is a true ballet class!

Using the chair for balance is easy, once you get the hang of switching it, you can follow easily.  Also, you can always position two chairs so you don't have to switch them.  It is nice to see the beautiful background too!  The music is ok and I really don't hear it after I get into the workout.  I danced for many years and this is truly a great workout!  I like that they use the ballet terms too!  I think it is much better than jumping around and kicking and punching in many other exercise dvds!

I was able to do the entire workout the first time through; but of course, not nearly as beautifully and gracefully as Elise.

I've found it hard to find ballet workouts that do not require a lot of jumping and space. This is pure ballet conditioning with no dance. Instead, it is a gracefully deep workout of the lower body.

I had ballet experience as a teen, and this reminded me of how incredibly difficult the control aspect of the art is, especially when doing tiny little movements.

I also want to say that I loved Elise's voiceover. He voice and manner of speaking beautifully complimented the pace of the workout. If you are looking for ballet conditioning and strength training, you cannot go wrong with this workout!",1239840000,6,1101,4.723958333333333

I thought this workout would be an easy, breezy workout that I'd get through with my eyes closed. So I popped in the DVD brought a chair over, my water and a towel. Elise came on and I noted she recommended no shoes. Great! I kicked off my sneakers and began the warm-up. Hmmm, thinking not too bad. I'm liking the relaxing scenery and calming music. Next thing you know I'm doing a million different kind of plies, my legs are screaming, I'm taking a break here and there and dripping with sweat all while Elise continues the workout with grace and a permanent smile. WHAT IN THE WORLD! All I can say is this workout is NO joke! The focus is primarily on the core and legs. The muscles in your legs are the largest in your body, therefore it takes way more energy doing a squat or plie versus a bicep curl or stomach crunch. Hence why my heart rate was so high right off the bat. Further you keep your arms in various ballet positions (i.e. rarely down) so you are engaging the upper body, lower body and the core all at once. After about 30 minutes or so of leg work utilizing a chair for balance, you move on to a series of various jumps, again my heart rate climbed. Finally you move to the floor for some ab work and then the cool down. I was absolutely amazed at how fit Elise is. To do this workout without breaking a sweat and keeping a smile on her face fascinated me as I was huffing and puffing and working on my balance and engaging my core and trying to lift my leg just THAT much higher. This is an awesome workout! Definitely think it's something to build into your workout routines atleast three times a week. Excellent DVD!",1238112000,166,1733,4.238670694864048
3200575,4,B000WC38BO,"I'd like to start by just saying that I am at a beginner/intermediate workout level.  I haven't taken ballet since I was 5 or 6, but in an attempt to broaden the variety of workouts I do, I purchased this DVD.  It looked like it would go nicely with my pilates and yoga collection, and it does. HOWEVER - this DVD kicked my butt.

It starts out with some familiar stretching, and then moves into a pretty intense lower body workout combined with some balance exercises that look a lot easier than they really are.  It will definitely take some practice and some time for me to be able to achieve proper form on all exercises.  There is one section of little ballet jumps that really get your heart rate up, and then she finishes off with some pilates-style movements.

My legs are burning today. It definitely does its job!  But please don't buy this as a beginner expecting to ease yourself into exercise.  This routine is very challenging, and you might not be able to get through the whole thing your first time through.  But eventually you will.  I see this DVD as a great routine to grow into, and it will feel amazing when I develop the strength and grace that she has.",1237852800,,1175,4.423255813953489
3200596,3,B000WC38BO,"I bought both this DVD and the New York City Ballet complete workouts.  This DVD provides a strenuous and challenging workout, however I liked the NYC ballet DVDS better.  I have done years of yoga and I would say I have a moderate fitness level, however doing this DVD I found a lot of the sections too difficult, particularly the abs section.

My concern is that those who know very little ballet technique may injure themselves as the DVD does not provide much instruction on turning out from the hips not the knees (to protect the knees), and also on the importance of engaging the core muscles to prevent injuring the lower back in the abs section.

It is only my personal view, but I did not like the instructor.  This could be due to cultural differences.  I did not take kindly to hearing a sugary sweet voice telling me to smile while going through some of the more gruelling exercises on the DVD!  However I acknowledge that others may not have a problem with this.

Overall, I recommend this DVD if you are looking for a very intense ballet style workout and perhaps have some prior experience in ballet or pilates.  However, if you want to feel like a dancer and to enjoy the feeling of your body moving through space then I would recommend the NYC ballet workouts.",1237680000,35,1277,4.517391304347826

You will work up a sweat and really tone and lengthen your muscles. The cueing is easy to follow and creates an extremely smooth workout experience on the first try, even if you don't have a background in ballet (which I don't). The setting is peaceful and calm. The other wonderful detail about this dvd is that the exercises require very little space. If you have a chair and enough room to lay down on the floor, you are ready to go.

I wanted something that emphasized stretching and strength without the hype for my morning workout...afternoons I like to jog, swim or work with free weights but wanted something more calming to start the day with...but I'm personally ""burned out"" on Yoga Yoga Yoga. This is the perfect solution! I have zero ballet training so cannot begin to claim that my form is correct however, the movements really challenge...as another reviewer mentioned...within the first five minutes you are feeling the heat build up. Great stretching that is perfect for this middle aged body - emphasizes those areas that tend to become problematic as one grows older...especially if you excercise or lift weights and have a problem retaining flexiblity.

However, don't be fooled - this is one tough workout! I've only had it a week but must confess that I'm still unable to get through the entire workout without stopping for a quick break (thank goodness for that pause button!). It leaves you feeling relaxed and refreshed - not utterly exhausted and hyper - which is exactly what I was searching for on a morning routine. Gets the blood pumping, eliminates that groggy feeling and leaves you invigorated.

Those with formal ballet training may find issues-but for those searching for a great stretching/strength workout without the hype and hysteria of bouncing bodies across the screen or someone just looking for an alternative to Yoga this is an excellent routine.",1236211200,6,1562,5.073929961089494

This is very lower body focused (let's be honest, it IS ballet) and you feel the burn within the first five minutes. She is a very great instructor and has cuing that is very helpful.

Whenever I finish this video, I feel so strong and elegant. Although during the video, I don't really know what to do with my hands or the correct position of them, but I just try my best to mimic the trainer.

I think another thing that I like best about the video is how she's so encouraging. She seems as though you could be able to talk to her and she'd be down to earth. I know there are a lot of people that sometimes feel discouraged when a trainer comes off too tough in videos, and she gives off a great and encouraging vibe.

If you have 50 minutes and would like to feel it pretty much everywhere, this is the video for you.

It is very balanced (your arms start to hurt after you hold them out to your sides, above your head, etc.) and there is a pilates-inspired core routine at the end.

So seeing the opportunity to diversify my routine with a well loved artform I was sold. I took ballet for a few years (3 or so) when i was much younger...that's it. So saying that that made it easier for me would be a stretch. What I liked was that the routine seems as though it is easy so you think okay I can try this and then before you know it you are sweating. There is a lot of leg work and that means that it involves using a lot of large muscle groups so it's got to get your heart rate up. I personally don't love voice-overs but this one was not distracting, cues were good and demonstration excellent. I would actually have loved more classical music but that is just by the way.

I cried the first time because it was memory lane for me. Elise takes you through the basics of ballet. Don't think this is she she foofoo workout. This is hard core kick your butt workout. You will sweat. I have had the DVD for 3 weeks now and I still haven't made it through the entire workout yet, but I will and I have already seen results. My legs, feet and ankles look wonderful, strong not body builder strong, lean, toned well shaped. My posture has improved greatly. I do this workout 3-4 times a week. Each time I go a little bit further. I love it it's a must have. Even people who have never danced before can do this, BUT pace yourself. It takes time. I trained for years and I still needed to pace myself as I'm starting back after 13 year hiatus. Elise did a wonderful job. By far my favorite workout DVD ever. I actually look forward to ballet dancing again. Total body workout. I walk in addition to this and I sleep better, feel better and my body is changing. My BFF 10 year old daughter said to me yesterday ""you look smaller in you face"". Needless to say I threw in an extra session yesterday, I haven't noticed my face. Such a self esteem booster for me.

The scenery on this DVD is lovely and tranquil, makes you want to exercise. Elise's voice is calming and soothing, her dictation is clear, easy to understand and follow. You need only a chair for balance and barefoot is best. Can it get any better??? Get this DVD and try it. If you actually hate it and I can't see anyone not liking it donate it to the public library.

3200658,4,B000WC38BO,"I did this workout several days ago and my thighs are still so sore I could barely walk today!  I consider this a success, as I often feel that home videos aren't challenging enough.  This instructor does some tough strength moves (like modified ballet barre moves in a squat position held for a longgggg time).  Ye-ouch!  If I am able to stick with it I would expect to see some firming up.

My biggest complaint is that the pace of the steps is incredibly slow.  As someone who has taken lessons before I was bored and had to do everything at ""double time"" speed.  While it was pleasant enough, it was not as enjoyable as a a standard beginner ballet class, probably because it goes so slow.  Also, the instructor kept saying over and over how this will lead to ""a dancer's body"" in a new age-style voice over.  I found this a little irritating.  I'd rather enjoy the music and just be cued to what's next than hear about the benefits that I may or may not see one day.

You probably won't get the body of a professional who dances 7 hours per day from this tape.  However, you WILL feel the burn as these strength moves will get results.",1228089600,,1140,4.3254716981132075

I love all of the leg exercises like tandu, plie, releve.  You will hold onto a chair for balance.  The leg exercises in the beginning really strengthen your thigh muscles.  It is hard to keep doing them until the very last one.  That's a good workout to me.

Towards the end, you will do jumps without using the chair, plus some other standing exercises.  I cannot stand in the same place on these jumps the way that Elise does, but it still gives me a great cardio workout.

Before the cool down, there are exercises on the floor that will work your legs and abs.  In this part, you can build up to where you don't use your arms to catch your legs and that uses your ab muscles more.

I don't know much about ballet, in fact, I have never been to a ballet class.  Although, it is gorgeous to watch and I would love to have the dancer's physique.  This workout will definitely improve your shape if you continue to do it.",1225238400,2,1044,4.292307692307692
3200663,2,B000WC38BO,"I'm trying to find a good DVD to exercise, and I thought I'd try ballet - hey, who doesn't want to be more graceful, lean, and strong?  All the other DVDs I saw reviewed on Amazon seemed to be for an existing dancer (which I'm not!) to refine technique, or a mix of ballet-Pilates or ballet-yoga.

So you know who's doing this review - I'm very tall, 235 lbs, 30 years, good athletic background, can run several miles at a go, but not what I'd call in great shape.  I am certainly NOT one of those women whose reviews I read here on Amazon who complain that an exercise video spends TOO MUCH time demonstrating moves, and gives too much of a break between moves.  Nope!  I need things simple and paced so that I can actually do it.  So with that in mind, here's my review of Elise Gulan's Ballet Conditioning:

Pros:
1) Gorgeous Pacific background (someone's beautiful house)
2) Gulan has an amazing figure and is very graceful - gives me something to which to aspire, and trying to imitate her grace took my mind off the difficulty of what I was doing - a tiny bit at least.
3) I found the moves very difficult, and I was working hard let me tell you!
4) For a complete ballet newbie, I guess there was a good element of introduction to ballet moves and terms.

Cons:
1) I was distracted by the fact that she kept on referring to long, lean dancer's muscles - but she's a beast.  Great figure, yes, very graceful movements, yes - but slender and delicate no.  Her thighs could not only crack walnuts - but could crack a walnut DESK! With a little self-tan and a tiny bikini, she could compete for body-building, I'm actually serious here.
2) I have to say this - since I volunteered at a fire station I probably (unfortunately) know more about soft-core pron than most women... I am willing to swear blind that the production company mixing the music does mostly soft-core pron.  It was so disconcerting, and distracting - in the first section there was even the classic 70s pron ""bow-wow"" every now and then.  With that ocean background, contact-paper ""wood"" platform, and fake cultured voiceover - it really was set up like soft-core pron.
3) Gulan's voiceover is freakin' annoying.  I know she's trying to sound soft, musical, warm, and classy - but it sounds unnatural and forced.  And she has a VERY weird, distracting habit of ""warming"" nearly every line (the only explanation I could find for the weirdness), so that it sounds like she's making a dirty innuendo; my mental image is of her constantly wiggling her eyebrows and winking creepily.  What the heck??  This really adds to the creepy soft-core pron feeling of this video.
4) As to the actual exercise - the segment was too long, and impossible for anyone other than a dedicated gym-rat or ballerina to follow.  It was very discouraging to me.  She just never stops, and never gives you even a second's rest, and rather than switching muscles just sticks with the same ones, nonstop.  Yes I know I have a remote, but I think a good choreographer builds exercise programs in segments, and switches muscle groups.
5) Her instructions tend to give important info a little too late to be helpful - not until the very end of the last leg of moves where she's casually lifting her leg to her ears (ok, I'm exaggerating) does she mention that it doesn't matter if you only lift it an inch, practice will increase flexibility, yada yada.  My pulled groin would have appreciated that little tidbit a bit earlier!  :)

My verdict:
If you really want to do ballet conditioning, and are willing to kill yourself every day until you can actually follow her moves, go for it.  If you want to have a reasonably paced, uplifting workout session, go elsewhere.  You'll end up discouraged and feeling inadequate, instead of proud of your hard work.  And maybe a little creeped out and dirty.

Whereas I've put in Tracey Mallett every day, this is only the second time I've put in this DVD... and probably not too many more times.  Ebay here I come!

*Edits from 4 years later: 1) From the comments, there was confusion - ""pron"" is my attempt to avoid auto spam sweepers. You know what I'm saying. :) And I'm not saying that this video is inappropriate, just that it has stylistic elements commonly found in softcore. 2) I just discovered that Sparkpeople.com has free sign-up and free segments of popular fitness videos, including ""Xtend Barre: Lean and Chiseled"" (which seems like what I was looking for in this video), Bollywood, Pilates, etc. I have no affiliation with Sparkpeople, except as a loyal user of their website.  3) Tracey Mallett still gets put into my DVD player on a regular basis... so I guess I should go do a review of that video too!",1223683200,74,4703,4.572109654350418

Another 10-15 minutes of intense abs work to round it out.

Besides the great workout, another benefit of this DVD is that you can sweat while looking (or at least trying to look) graceful!

Bonus for boaters: Many of the exercises are adaptable to small spaces. I live and travel on my 35-foot sailboat. Staying fit onboard is always a challenge. I can perform many of the exercises both inside the boat and topside.

Being quite inflexible, I wish the DVD included additional warm-up stretches or an extras chapter with stretches to better prepare me for the leg lifts to follow.

3200692,5,B000WC38BO,"Way more difficult than I thought it would be. Definately works the whole body! Pro dancers don't just love dance, they WORK HARD for it. With these exercises, you build strength & length in the muscles by focusing on balance, control & positioning. I would recommend this to almost any woman. You must remember to go at your own pace. You WILL NOT be able to lift as high as the instructor at first, but don't over do because you will improve & see results FAST! There are no alternate movements demonstrated, don't worry, you don't need them, just only stretch or lift as much as you can. In my opinion, as you progress through this with practice, you will appreciate the pace of transitioning from exercise to exercise & be better able to maintain your focus without interruption. It also does not allow you to work in modified positions forever making excuses for yourself not to try harder. I absolutely want to work up to the level of flexibility & control she has. I feel great after doing this routine. Revitilized, refreshed, lengthened, & with much MORE energy. The price is a great value, so worth it. Buy it. You won't regret it.

Works as advertised, is ballet inspired & also focuses on control & positioning. I love the tiny extremely effective movements of Callanetics. Both of these videos do not terrorize your back & joints but really, let me stress really, work the hard to fix lower body. Both make doing lunges & 500 crunches seem unworthy of my time. This is a terrific way to spend an hour on yourself releasing stress at the end of the day or revving up in the morning. People will notice you are making changes. Don't bulk up, strengthen & lengthen. Good Luck!!! :)",1219190400,17,1996,5.051515151515152

You get a very good workout, and after doing this video, I felt it in my muscles!  I'm not a hard-core exerciser and am still working on getting in shape, and have many different exercise videos.  With some of the exercise videos that I own, after exercising with the video, I don't feel like I've done much.  Not so with this video.  There is a heavy emphasis on the lower body; most of the ballet workout concentrates on the legs and buns.  The abs part of the workout is more like pilates; gentle, but challenging .  There is also a portion of the video where you do ballet jumps to get the cardio going.  The workout is challenging enough for more advanced exercisers, but also can be used by beginners.  I know this is one exercise video that I'll be using over and over!",1219104000,2,880,4.343558282208589
3200694,5,B000WC38BO,"This DVD is REALLY hard on the legs.  And makes the shoulders burn too.  I love it!  The view in the background is awesome, and the instructor is narrating the video instead of trying to instruct while she's doing the exercises herself.  I think this probably makes it more relaxing.  She's not wearing the little black ballet get-up on the cover, just a pink yoga bra and grey leggings.  My thighs BURNED during this workout!",1218672000,,426,4.613333333333333

I work out 1-2 hours a day and was looking for something, . . just different.  I've been dissapointed by the other ballet DVD's out there.  If you used to dance you'll know what I mean.  A REAL ballet class consists of training at the bar, jumping, and stretching and yes, PLIES, lots of them.  This DVD delivers all elements and is filmed quite beautifully.  It caters to the beginner but isn't boring for intermediate to advanced excersizers.  I only wish that there were more jumping exercises and I don't really like the narration.  It borders on the verge of being really annoying.  Would have like to hear actual ballet music too.  I really hope that they come up with another volume to this workout though, mabe more advanced, because I just love it.",1218240000,6,892,4.438271604938271

This is an extremely effective dvd that will give you results in a very short period.",1217116800,4,422,4.454545454545454
3200711,5,B000WC38BO,"After reading all the reviews I too decided to purchase this video. I like this video for so many of the reasons stated here previously. I like the voice-over aspect, outdoor scenery, and contrary to some, I like the music as it has the right beat to match the movements.

The instructor is very postive in a calm and pleasant way, (no screaming or condesending tone). The video breaks down with; warm-up moves, lots of well-paced challenging leg work, ballet jumps, abs (with legs) and final stretching.(sometimes, when I'm short on time or energy I do the first part alone). I have very limited ballet experience, but found I could do all of the movements, (if not very well at first). I've found if you can do this in front of a mirror to check your alignment and posture, you will always be challenged! The best part for me has been the pace of the program, it allows me to break a sweat without feeling like I'm going to have a heart attack -- and I've seen more results, more quickly with this video than with other high-energy workout videos!

Very well done. I hope Element decides to do another ballet workout with Elise!",1216944000,9,1130,4.534313725490196
3200712,5,B000WC38BO,"This is an excellent workout video if your familiar with ballet or just starting out.  Elise Gulan is the perfect coach for her gentle motivating voice and calming fluent movement.  As someone who used to do ballet, this was a great video to ease back into it.  Gulan starts out smoothly and slowly moves into a vigorous workout focusing on abs, toning of thighs, and cardio by series of jumps. (You will break a sweat!) The best part is, all you need is a chair for these workouts!  There is no barre required!  You will feel immediate results from this video, and want to do it again and again!",1216512000,5,596,4.431192660550459

However, I enjoyed this DVD as a wonderful departure from the other high-impact exercise videos out there.  When I finish, I am exhausted and sweaty, but feel a wonderful burn in my arms and legs.  I recommend this for anyone who wants a ballet-type workout who is not so concerned with the technical aspects.",1216080000,12,570,4.4423076923076925

I have to take breaks to get through it, but I know it will give me leaner and stronger legs if I keep doing it. It makes your thighs burn if you aren't used to doing lots of toning or pilates. This is good if you want to get into your skinny jeans and are looking for a routine that's a little less typical gym routine and has a little more dancer/yoga flair.",1215734400,5,430,4.192771084337349

I decided to find a dance work-out that would keep me in shape during the summer when I'm away from the dance studio.  After a few weeks of doing ""nothing,"" I popped this DVD in and got right to it.  I found it to be extremely beneficial in a conditioning sense, but it is not what you would want if you are training in ballet.  I have a problem when technique isn't taught perfectly, or executed correctly.  This DVD is considered a ""conditioning"" work-out---and that's exactly what it is.  The price is right, the setting beautiful, and I am so sore I can hardly walk.",1215561600,12,633,4.322033898305085

3200717,1,B000WC38BO,"This is not a conditioning class; it's simply a beginning ballet class taught by a very average ballet dancer.  I wouldn't even recommend it to a beginner ballet student because you're liable to pick up some bad habits like sticking out your thumbs, and not working through your feet, both of which the teacher does routinely.  And she doesn't have any business talking about how to develop the long, lean look of a dancer -- which she does ad nauseum -- since that's not the type of body she has.  She has a nice figure, but it's definitely not a ballet dancer's body.  If she has primarily been using dance as her means of exercise (as she implies) then she's been using her quadriceps to lift her legs into developpe, which is a definite no-no.  If she comes out with an actual conditioning DVD, that might be good, but this one has no redeeming value to me.",1214784000,74,861,4.45859872611465

I would caution people with injuries (especially in the knees as she really likes to have you do a lot of plies---including grand-plie which is a pretty big bend in the knees) to steer away from the this video.  It is probably not best for a total beginner unless you feel comfortable modifying your exercises to your own abilities and if you do not mind that you might not yet be able to perform the exercises to the level of the woman on the screen.  The exercises are actually reasonably easy to modify (do demi plies instead of grand-plies, put the hands on the hips is you get tired from keeping them in second position forever, only lift the leg to 30 or 45 degrees instead of 90 in grand battements etc).  If you have never had any dance training (I have only had 6 months of a beginning adult classes) then I would probably think that the New York City Ballet Workout 1 is better for introducing some of the basic ballet steps while still getting a workout.  Incorporate this into your workout routine and I do not know how you would not get results.  And one more thing---you do not need to be flexible to do the workout as other reviewers have suggested---I had to work for ages to even touch my toes and I found this workout to be possible, with modification of course.",1214092800,37,1380,4.37109375

This is a challenging workout!  I know a few people were disappointed that it wasn't balletic enough, but I don't think it was meant to be.  This video is a conditioning workout.  I haven't made it through the whole video.  I piece them out: core strength and quads one day, stretching and glutes the next (with some yoga mixed in).  Frankly after the first few minutes of keeping my legs raised and repeating leg movements, I was sweating from holding certain positions.  You do work your arms.  Elise has you raising your arms above your head or out to your side and you keep them there for the duration of the exercise.  The core strength uses pilates and it left my abs burning for hours.
This a wonderful video to add to my collection.  Graceful instructor.  Gorgeous scenery.  And a workout that  leaves me feeling strong and supple.",1212537600,12,988,4.630057803468208

I noticed another reviewer wrote that if you don't have much flexibility this video is very bad for you. I can't disagree more. She mentions in the video, several times, that do what feels challenging to you! You are not going to be able to move as advanced as she does for a while. That's the beauty of this video. You can see how everytime you do the workout, you'll get that much more out of it. Just do the workout so that you can feel the muscles work. The flexibility will come with time. I'm sure before I know it, I'll be able to lift my leg much higher than 1/3 of the way up (although sometimes is just 1/4 of the way)!

The instructions are vauge.  There are few moderations given, and you can easily strain a muscle.  Beware if you are exercising in a room with fragile items,  as there is a section of constant jumping.

Elise is an excellent teacher, very gentle and affirming. The workout is an hour long, so make sure you have enough time to complete it. You do need plenty of space to do all the moves, which made things a little difficult in my tiny apartment. For those of us who aren't quite up to the challenge, it is easy enough to skip the last few reps of some of the exercises (the plie jumps in particular), and you still get a good workout.

The workout hits hard the first 2-3 times, and if you don't have a good conditioning you probably won't be able to finish it completely at first, don't worry, if you keep at it after a few days it becomes more easy and better. The body becomes more tight, slender and strong.

I recommend do the video every other day, 3 times a week. And if combined with a balanced diet (less fat more veggies and fruits) the results will show faster.",1210550400,40,577,4.392523364485982

The instructor/narrator is very calm which combined with the serence music and location is soothing. The routine seems so basic but it really digs deep into your muscles. The instructor/narrator gives step by step instruction in plain English as well as giving the precise name for the move as it would be called in a studio. The fact that shes uses a chair and switches from side to side is helpful. It isn't too fast paced, it's very motivating and over all I would love to do it over and over, if my muscles would stop failing.",1210464000,7,654,4.504201680672269

It's actually perfect for doing at home, where you have to watch the TV screen.  No turns or anything like that to throw you off.  The setting is beautiful.  After a few watches,I was able to turn the volume down, put on my own music and still follow along.  If you want a good ballet conditioning DVD, this is it.  Also, the instruction is in voice-over, which is nice, especially if you do turn the volume down.  That way her mouth isn't constantly moving with no sound.",1210204800,4,610,4.4818181818181815

I also do a lot of jumping around and cardio in my classes and gym workouts, as well as resistance training with bands and weights, so I thought ballet moves would add a different dimension.  I found this video to be great for muscle toning and especially lengthening, which is an important component to any exercise program for women in particular.  It is just long enough and varied enough that you feel your whole body working, but without any impact.  There is a short section of jumps, so if you have bad knees you may want to modify this or skip the section. I especially like that the instructor gives cues as a voice-over instead of taking time away from performing the moves to tell you how to position your body correctly.  If you are looking for a weight loss routine, this won't be the best choice, but for improving posture (which can make you look like you've lost up to 10 pounds!) and sculpting dancer-like muscle without the bulk, this is a good choice, especially for the price!",1207958400,13,1108,4.575757575757576

I've been doing a few sections 3-4 times a week for three weeks (simply can't DO the whole DVD at one time yet!), and while I haven't lost any pounds, I have already toned inches off my body, and my clothes sure fit better!

The zen setting of the DVD is relaxing, and Elise's AMAZING physique is inspiring rather than distracting.  I will say that my basic knowledge of the moves and training in keeping my toes pointed and back tall all the time probably helps, but this is really an easy routine to get into, and the quick results are inspiration to keep going.",1207872000,12,936,4.362068965517241

The first few times you workout with this DVD, your legs will be trembling with fatigue and the sweat will be pouring down your face!  From the very first, you can feel your muscles lengthening and strengthening, and you feel so graceful and powerful when you're done.  Do it a few times a week, and you'll very quickly notice a difference in your body and overall health.  I've never been flexible, but this workout allows you to stat at your own level and really build on your ability; I know that I am already stronger and more flexible in just a few weeks of starting this routine.  I've tried many other ballet workout CDs, and none of them came close to the quality of this one.  As other reviewers have noted, the music is not very stimulating . . . but it grows on you after a while and the quality of the workout far outweighs this.  Once you've got most of the moves down, you can just pop in a Swan Lake CD over the muted workout, and you've got the best of both worlds!",1207440000,8,1150,4.243119266055046

After the workout, it's only 50 minutes you will feel like you've been excersising for 2 hours, my legs actually were trembling after the first part.
The music should have been classical, it's a little disturbing performing classical ballet moves without the music.
Other than the music, you will se results inmediatly specially in your legs.",1207353600,2,397,5.123076923076923

I wanted something that would help my core strength and give me some more stretching. Not too much stretching in this one, but I was surprised at how challenging the moves were (I've never been a dancer). At 38, I can use this...and I would do this DVD as often as I could to get a physique like this lady.

My only recommendation for this is a use of a yoga mat for the ab work. I don't know how her spine doesn't bother her on that floor she's using, but once I used my mat all was well.",1207180800,8,609,3.8333333333333335

I had no idea that the workout was going to be this good.  This video provides an amazing full body workout.  It is easy to do and uses your own body weight to tone and condition.  It challenges your endurance and strength.  I have been using this video to workout for about a week and a half and my body is already toning up. I haven't even made it through the whole video once yet.  I have done dance videos before but none with the challenges and results that this video provides.  I bought another ballet video along with this one (because it was recommended as a good addition to this video) that was $20 more expensive, and it absolutely sucks compared to this one.

I have never attempted ballet before, but I caught on with the DVD pretty well. Elise Gulan is easy to follow and the workout is great for people of every skill. Her voiceover was irritating to me at first, but she grew on me after a while because the workout is quality. The setting is lovely outside; you can even see a bug land on her shoulder in one frame. I hate to workout, but this one is enjoyable. She left my leg muscles sore and my tummy strong- I love it!

My only complaint was the music. Musicality is arguable the most important aspect of ballet.  The elevator music was a drag, and to be a true ballet workout, there should have been classical music or at least something besides elevator music. The instructor is pleasant, but I was surprised to see that she had been a professional ballet dancer due to her lack of technique in certain areas.",1205452800,12,543,4.56701030927835

I certainly found that to be worthwhile.",1204675200,48,370,4.455882352941177

This is a workout for the very flexible as well as for those who are knowledgeable about modifying potentially stressful positions such as toe touches and deep knee bends!

A basic background in ballet might be helpful but not really necessary in order to achieve the benefits of the barre exercises.  Everything is performed in a classic ballet barre routine (with a chair instead of a barre) and is well explained even for a beginner.  The actual routine brought back so many fond memories of working my 'backside' off in ballet class, but loving every minute of it!  The music wasn't traditional ballet music but worked OK anyway.

3200831,5,B000WC38BO,"After having three children I need an exercise routine that is going to help me regain my fitness and flexibility. I've found it. What a wonderful routine. Although the routine was demanding, the small movements, softness, grace, and location makes it feel like a meditation - relaxing, soothing, calming, quietly energising. This is not a high-energy, in-your-face type of workout, and I don't get the post-exercise rush and subsequent crash that I get from many aerobics-type of workouts. I feel good all day. Ms Gulan is amazing but she doesn't make you feel poorly about yourself if you can't do what she does. I feel that I can opt out of some of the sequences to have a breather or rest tiring muscles when I need to and still feel good about myself. The voiceover is extremely encouraging and respectful. I haven't had any dance training but it is easy to see and follow the routine even if you can't quite do the exercises to their full extent. There are lots of challenges in the routine to keep me interested for quite a long tme. Highly recommended.",1202256000,12,1060,4.67379679144385

I wanted a good workout that incorporated ballet movements from classes I have taken. This does it! It's 51 minutes long, begins with some stretching, a plie series, tendus (sp?), a series of jumps to increase your heart rate and a section of abdominal workouts. After the stretches, she does several plie series that left my thigh muscles quivering the first time. I felt like I had lost an inch off my legs & waist after the first time. The instructions are clear and easy to follow. She does each side, using a chair for balance and with the arms incorporated, they become sculpted also. Each time I do the workout, I find something new to improve upon in each movement. My flexibility improves each time and that allows me to perform each movement more gracefully.

I anticipate it getting easier the more I use it but it was very intense. The workouts average about 40 minutes to an hour which I wish I would have known before I bought it. I am a busy girl and I didn't realize I needed that much time devoted to the workout. Not a big deal for most people though. I plan on tailoring the workout for a shorter period and doing it more frequently during the week. I also do pilates during the week which helps during the ballet exercises.

I just have to say, if you wanna get toned and fit and can stand the burn, this DVD is just for you.",1201478400,11,737,3.9133333333333336

At $8 it is a bargain, the video and sound quality is much, much more than a $8 workout dvd to me).  I wanted something challenging that would be a good filler for days when I can't get to the gym.  It's going to become much more than that because it is that good.

Likes:
>The scenery is wonderful as other reviewers have said.

>The use of a chair and not a barre - when she switches to the other side to work the other leg, she physically moves the chair to the other side. In other ballet videos where they've used a barre, usually I have to pause the tape because I can't quite get my chair moved around fast enough to start working the other side (they just turn around and start doing the exercises; if I turn around I'm no longer facing the TV :-)).

>The fact that the voice cueing is done as a voice over, instead of by the person doing the exercises, this makes it VERY easy to follow

>Recognition all along the way that not everyone is as flexible - and continuous encouragement that with time flexibility will come

Overall, it is an excellent dvd and I'm glad I bought it.",1201305600,137,1190,4.192982456140351

By the looks of the cover I thought this DVD would actually bore me, but much to my surprised I liked it alot!

It's an intense lower body workout with ballet inspired moves.  Because you work deep into muscles, it's designed to help you get that long lean body look that ballet dancers have.  Elise is a good instructor with great cuing so you know what to do next at all times.  I love the outdoor setting (instead of the inside of a studio for a change); it's great to do a workout that has been done outside to make you feel like it's Summer all year round and motivate you that little bit more.
I never thought this would be a workout that would be for me, but it's very enjoyable and fun and you feel the next day all those muscles you've used and I can't wait to see the results from this.  I love it.",1200960000,407,957,4.042328042328043

Not to say you have to be an experienced dancer to do this workout, as the barre workout is basic to ballet and easy to pick up...even for beginners.  I haven't done any ballet in years and after the end of the workout my legs were shaking a bit. That definitely showed me I was using leg and arm muscles I hadn't worked in a while. This is such a graceful workout and you really feel like you are toning your whole body! I can't wait to do it again. I also have back and neck problems from a past injury and this low impact workout is great for that. You can do the barre work stabilized by holding onto the back of a chair and there is only one short section that has impact at all to the body (where you do a short set of ballet jumps). I love that this workout is easy on the body, but at the same time you can really tell it is working. The abs section was great too...I will have to do this workout a few more times before I can make it through the abs at the advanced level.

Its about time that an affordable true ballet barre workout came out that actually uses a barre to its fullest potential.  I have a ballet barre and was pleasantly surprised that throughout the workout it was used.  I can't say that about all ballet workouts.  Anyway this is an invigorating ballet workout which will have you sweating by the end.  Elise works one side first then works the other side.  All exercises start slowly then progress to a faster speed.  Very thorough workout at the end you will focus on abs which is pilates inspired.  Elise is a pleasant instructor with beautiful form.  The scenery is breathtaking which is an added plus.  The music was good although true ballet purist will insist on classical music which this workout had not.  The price was such a deal.  I say this because most ballet and callanetic type workouts start at $30.  This was an affordable, well produced, with added gorgeous scenery workout that is a true keeper.

I know that this workout will contribute to toning and slimming my legs, which is an area I personally would like to improve, as well as the rest of my body. The ab section incorporates many pilates type exercises to tone and tighten the midsection. Even though I regularily do pilates, I really felt my abs more than I expected.
