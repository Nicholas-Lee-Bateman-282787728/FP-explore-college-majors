8315611,5,B001KP2J7Q,I'm only 13 and I love this show. It's more original than the shows that are popular right now like Gossip Girl. It has character and a heart warming theme. I own all of them :),1268870400,,177,3.9444444444444446

One very annoying feature however is the packaging of almost each season is different. Some are in book form other in individual jackets within the season case. Season 2 is the worst package design. If you want to view disk 3 you must remove disk 2 as well.....same goes for disk 4 and 5.
Getting back to the show...takes place in the 1930's during the depression years...given the tough economic situation of today, it can demonstrate to us all how a family can manage to cope and make do with what they got.",1233964800,3,639,4.423728813559322
8315615,5,B001KP2J7Q,I loved the Waltons back in the 70 and 80's and continue to appreciate their simplicity.  One of my favorites!,1233964800,2,110,4.5
