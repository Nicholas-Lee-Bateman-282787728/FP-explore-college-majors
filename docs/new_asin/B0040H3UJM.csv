We had a lot of clientele requesting, not only hair and nails be done, but makeup as well. We do a lot of weddings and special events work in our area. I have used mineral make-up on myself for years but many of the employees that work in my salon have not. I wanted to find a video that would help show them the techniques for applying mineral makeup on our clients. And, since I have only ever done my own makeup, I wanted a refresher course on the subject before I started offering this service in my salon. This video has been wonderful! It breaks down, step by step, the complete application from start to finish (foundation application, eye shadow, bronzer, blush, lipstick  it shows it all). Four different looks are covered on this makeup video. Since we do a lot of weddings, this video has been helpful as it provides a lighter look for daytime. We also do a lot of black-tie events where a more dramatic look is required. This video shows you how to get any look you want and you will come out feeling like a true makeup artist. My clients have been raving about the results they have been getting with our mineral makeup brands and it has led to a line of bare mineral makeup being carried in my salon for resale. Through the use of this video, my employees are able to educate our clients about the benefits of mineral make up on the skin. It has been a real boon for my business! Very happy I purchased this training dvd.",1418947200,,1562,4.386206896551724

There are several techniques which cover the day time look or evening look and how to add the final touches.  The instructor is very detailed and covers areas such as how to choose the proper tools and the health benefits of mineral makeup.  We have a lot of clients with sensitive skin, rosacea & eczema and now we have found a solution for their makeup needs. I highly recommend this DVD.",1416528000,,556,4.78125
