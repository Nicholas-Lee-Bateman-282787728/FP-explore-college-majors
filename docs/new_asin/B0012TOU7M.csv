8247765,4,B0012TOU7M,"Numerous art works of the period are documented in this VHS tape of Chaucer's time, life, and works.  It paints the stark contrasts of medieval life--the pageantry and liveliness of everyday life accompanied by war, the plague, martydoms, crusades, pilgrimages, interest in astrology, and unusual medical cures.  The narrator points out Chaucer's remarkable contribution in pioneering the use of English in his poetry, instead of using the accepted French or Latin for literary works.  His ""Canterbury Tales"" is a reflection of  the manners and humours of the common man in England of the time (1300's).  The accompanying audio cassette and script of ""The Wyf of Bathe"" help students to see and hear the English language as written and spoken in that period.",1220227200,,758,5.180327868852459
