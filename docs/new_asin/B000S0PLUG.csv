8203624,5,B000S0PLUG,"Wow, this is a gift for my husband and he loves it!  Just had him check the DVD to make sure it was OK and could hardly get it away from him to put it into his Xmas stocking.",1481414400,,174,3.4615384615384617
8203625,5,B000S0PLUG,This was a good buy because it included four DVDs. It was a pleasure to watch. I will recommend it.,1396137600,,99,4.0
8203626,5,B000S0PLUG,"This four CD set will take you back to an earlier time when Lionel trains were  found running around under the Christmas tree. Grown men such as myself remember that time, and continue the excitment by collecting and operating Lionel trains as a hobby or a business. It's fun to see what other people have done by building large layouts,and encouraging youngsters to continue the tradition.",1361923200,,390,4.909090909090909
8203627,3,B000S0PLUG,"Video quality could be better. Need to see more accessories working rather than talking and trains going around. Still, well worth the childhood memories.

There are some great layouts filmed in this DVD.",1358121600,,204,5.181818181818182
8203628,4,B000S0PLUG,"Very Satisfied with DVD.  Quite a bit of model train film bang for the buck.  The human stories relating to the hobby and the train info/action both have appeal.  Most movies I see I don't watch more than once, but i've enjoyed watching this DVD a second and third time.",1262131200,11,270,4.36
