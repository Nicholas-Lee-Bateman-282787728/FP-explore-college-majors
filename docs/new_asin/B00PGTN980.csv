6798577,5,B00PGTN980,Great movie; fast shipping.  It was on sale for $5 which is a STEAL for a Blu-ray/UV combo!,1439510400,,91,4.055555555555555
6798578,3,B00PGTN980,"My problem with this version is that it is the same one that played in the theaters. On DVD (NOT Blu-Ray), there is an ""unrated"" version that fleshes out the story a lot better, and in my opinion, makes a lot more sense of why they did what they did, and why they ended up where they did. These scenes were probably cut from the theatrical version because they are a little more ""serious"" and the movie would have ended up with a 'R' rating. I have noticed in the past that Hollywood is willing to give up important plot points in order to get that PG-13 rating to get the teenager money, and it's a shame. What is more of a shame is that this movie got released to Blu-Ray without the cut scenes. WHY? Only the studios know why they act like idiots.",1439510400,26,750,4.179310344827586
