2927141,4,B000UYN9M2,I have the first volumes of Tales of Tomorrow and despite the low budgets and sets that look accordingly the stories still captivate.,1240790400,13,133,4.826086956521739
2927142,4,B000UYN9M2,"The people who will appreciate these episodes are oldsters who may be interested in seeing some of the stars of yesterday they remember.  Such as seeing a young Leslie Nielsen.

Please be advised that these episodes were done live as plays, thus they were not filmed as the I Love Lucy show was done.  Thus the picture quality is far from ideal, but still watchable.

I only did this review for people who may have purchased a 3 episode set found in a $1 bargain bin, in a paper sleeve.  These 3 episodes have a terrible picture quality and I didn't bother to watch.  These 3 volumes are of a higher picture quality, but many people will still be put off.
Lastly, each episode includes all of the commercials, so episodes run 29 minutes.",1240272000,31,737,4.462686567164179
2927143,5,B000UYN9M2,This old series has charm of it's own. First they have so many stars that can act and very different types of stories. I have all three that is out.,1226966400,6,148,3.966666666666667
2927144,4,B000UYN9M2,"Pioneering sci-fi TV series TALES OF TOMORROW aired 85 episodes between 8/3/51 and 9/13/53 on the ABC-TV network.  These half-hour stories often featured many famous Hollywood stars (like Boris Karloff, Franchot Tone and Burgess Meredith) as well as some up-and-comers (James Dean, Rod Steiger, Joanne Woodward, Leslie Nielsen). Special effects, props and scenery are minimal, yet this forerunner of TWILIGHT ZONE, THE OUTER LIMITS (and so many others) has a charm all its own.

The fourteen chapters on volume three are all from TOT's second season.

2927147,5,B000UYN9M2,"I loved this TRUE SCI-FI compilation,as a 10 yr old,I read ,avidly the old sci fi  stuff from galaxy,If,and  Astounding Sci Fi. As a 58yr young man, it was lovely to transport myself back to this era!!THANK YOU",1407715200,2,210,4.5
2927148,4,B000UYN9M2,"I remember  seeing these  shows on our first TV. I was about 9 yrs. old. One episode caught my mind. I never forgot it and should like to see it again. A man discovers a substance to eat. It tastes like whatever the eater imagines or wants it to. Ice cream , steak, etc. But after a while normal foods become inedble ! I think this  miracle food is called ""Manna"" ? Can anyone help me with this.-is it available ?
Thanks  Jim Baesel  ,Ohio",1374537600,,439,4.117647058823529
2927149,4,B000UYN9M2,"Although filmed in the early 1950s, if you can look past the obvious monetary restraints, the storylines for many of the episodes are pretty compelling.  Some episodes seem to end abruptly (30 minute show) and I believe would have been better if they had been an hour instead.  Overall a good buy and enjoyable show.  One thing to note, these are ""collections,"" and NOT entire seasons.  I have been able to find episodes not included in these ""collections"" on various websites including youtube.",1364428800,4,495,4.927710843373494
2927150,5,B000UYN9M2,"After viewing the first two collections I knew the quality of the third collection should also be very good, so wanted to add it to my collection and finish up the full set of programs. It did not disappoint me.",1361750400,2,211,4.3
2927151,2,B000UYN9M2,"I got this item. When I just put the second dvd in it was the same shows from disc one. I would not buy this item. If you want to see all the shows you will not with this package. It doesn't have any warning that will happen in it's ordering but it will.
The season one and two could be like that too.",1348963200,3,301,3.71875
2927152,1,B000UYN9M2,"Just try to buy a set that doesn't have two disc 2 and NO disc 1!  Dare ya!
I now own two such ""sets.""  Yeah, that's 4 disc 2!",1314403200,2,126,3.310344827586207
2927153,2,B000UYN9M2,"Forget bottom-of-the-barrel production values (doors that pop open after they are slammed, operating rooms with pitch-black walls(!), cameras that appear in the shot, and perhaps the worst robot costume in the history of television in ""Read To Me Herr Docktor.""

Forget the gaffes from the actors delivering their lines (this was filmed live, unedited.) Forget the jarring insertion of commercials, also live. Forget the collection of grade D actors that couldn't carry off their parts.

At bottom, the problem with this series lay in the fact that there were no decent scripts. The old theater adage applies: ""If it ain't on the page, it ain't on the stage."" And in this season, most of the blame goes to Frank De Felitta, as he wrote the lion's share of the scripts. There were other offenders, but he seems the most egregious. Stories range from jaw-droppingly bad (""Seeing Eye Surgeon,"" in which the denouement questions the whole premise) to mediocre (""The Window."") And the allure of seeing some future stars in early performances quickly wears thin.

Leslie Nielsen's constant befuddlement in ""Another Chance"" is tiring, and Rod Steiger's rootless performance in ""The Evil Within"" is at times shrill, twitchy and just plain wearing. Joanne Woodward does a creditable job in ""The Bitter Storm,"" but the premise is so ludicrous that even her work can't save it. Had I paid considerably less for this, I would have been happy with my purchase simply for the nostalgia value. But for the going price, this just ain't worth it. With all the great sci-fi stories being printed in Galaxy magazine at the time this was being filmed, there was excellent and sufficient material available. In comparison to this, ""One Step Beyond"" is Shakespeare. I just can't recommend this.",1268870400,3,1772,5.040955631399317
2927154,5,B000UYN9M2,"I was a fan of this show when I was ten, and I've been hoping to find something like this DVD. It's funky but fun, I like the fact that it is more like a stage play than an eleborate production.",1245542400,4,194,3.7560975609756095

8215638,3,B000UYN9M2,Mostly stupid stories with only a few good ones. Unbelievably low production values - makes early Doctor Who look good.  Interesting only to see people who became big stars later when they were just starting out.,1449446400,,212,4.888888888888889
8215639,5,B000UYN9M2,Nice series.  My parents didn't have a TV when these originally aired.  They are Kinescopes of  the original series which were done live on TV.  These are more like stage plays as to do them there was no editing back then.  I was wondering how they back timed them and then I saw one where they cut the credits.,1441065600,,311,4.203389830508475
