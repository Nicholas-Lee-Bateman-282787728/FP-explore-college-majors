2839023,4,B000QGYYS2,"Even though this film is entitled under its German title, 'L'Etrusco Uccide Ancora' - THE DEAD ARE ALIVE (1972), how it is called in Italian - is overall, a typical Italian thriller of the Seventies.

Directed with style by Armando Crispino, who also directed the breathtaking 'Macchie Solari' (aka Autopsy, The Victim), the film suggests supernatural forces involved in the plot.  That makes the whole thing even more atmospheric and will keep you on the edge of your seats.

The German video versions are heavily cut concerning the plot (one version is also cut concerning the violent killings), while only the Danish video version appears to be complete (according to the excellent English book 'Blood and Black Lace').

Nevertheless, if you are able to get this gem on video, get it: This giallo truly delivers!",1243296000,3,815,5.014814814814815
2839024,3,B000QGYYS2,"Note:  This review is for the Eurovista release, not the Code Red.  Hopefully, Code Red has restored this giallo classic.

""The Dead Are Alive"" is a superb Italian giallo from director Armando Crispino who brought us ""Autopsy.""  It has an intriguing plot involving lovely Samantha Eggar (best known for David Cronenberg's masterpiece ""The Brood"") who is Myra and hunky Sam Elliot look alike, Alex Cord, who is Jason.  These former lovers are archaeologists who are ""messing around"" in a recently opened ancient Etruscan tomb.  Mysterious deaths begin to plague the dig site.  Could it be an Etruscan demon?  Or could it be an alcoholic, amnesiac Jason having homicidal fits of rage because Myra is with wealthy opera composer Nikos (played by John Marley of ""Godfather"" fame - he woke up with a horse's head in his bed)?

  Pairs of young lovers are being bludgeoned to death in barns, tombs, etc.  This movie predates ""Friday the 13th"" by ten years and has similar themes of repressed anger and revenge.  Eggar and Cord are gorgeous together.  The superb operatic soundtrack is provided by Riz Ortolani who scored such excellent mystery thrillers as Lucio Fulci's ""Perversion Story"" and Flavio Mogherini's ""The Pyjama Girl Case.""

  The DVD has some nice extras such as a collectable booklet of movie advertisements, backgrounds on the director and the lead actors, and a poster gallery.  Unfortunately, the widescreen presentation is extremely WIDE, too wide, and there are numerous green lines (vertical and horizontal) throughout the movie.  In the far bottom, left-hand corner is a green feather that is constantly quivering.  (It is very distracting at first but one grows used to it.)  This is a shame because this is an excellent movie and the set pieces and cinematography are exquisite.  Hopefully, Blue Underground or Anchor Bay will give it the release that it deserves.  Save your money and wait for a better presentation.

  If you look carefully, you will notice that Eurovista misspelled the names of the director and the lead actress on the DVD's cover.  This made me lose my confidence in them quickly.  Think twice before purchasing this one.",1211500800,5,2161,5.045325779036827
8196440,4,B000QGYYS2,"The movie, ""The Dead are Alive"" was a surprisingly good and I enjoyed it from the beginning.  The title seemed to indicate the horror genre, however the movie is more of a mystery/crime drama.  The fact that the wonderful and excellent actress, Samantha Eggar starred in the film also adds to the film.  Directed by the Italian director Armando Crispino,  ""The Dead are Alive"" is one the better examples of the Italian giallo films.  This copy was produced by Code Red and is an excellent copy when compared to other DVD producers of ""The Dead are Alive"".  I had originally purchased the Eurovista copy, which has a multitude of flaws, the main flaw being the lack of clarity.  Seeing the stunning redhead, Samantha Eggar in the Code Red version was a treat  given the Eurovista version lack of clarity.  I recommend purchase of ""The Dead are Alive"" if it is the Code Red version.",1464134400,,880,4.662337662337662
8196441,5,B000QGYYS2,"this finally got a blu ray release and I sold off my dvd copy of this one.  It's one of the better giallos. or Italian slasher films of the giallo era.  from 1966- 1979.  It has a solid story and some gory killings in it But it also has very good actors in it as well.  This print is actually a good one.  the other versions out there look bad indeed.  This is missing a few minutes in it evidently but at least we finally have it on dvd.  Well we did.  It's now out of print again. My seller had a brain. He knew that if he tried to sell it for 80.00 plus , he would never sell it. the blu ray uses the same print as this , which looks good.",1461196800,2,642,3.7388059701492535

8196443,5,B000QGYYS2,"1972's ""The Dead Are Alive!"" (Italian title means: ""The Etruscan Kills Again,"" which is more precise) is an interesting giallo that could also be in the genre of horror, but ultimately it is a giallo, directed by Armando Crispino and written by Lucio Battistrada and Armando Crispino with music by Riz Ortolani.  Crispino later directed what is known as ""Autopsy"" in 1975.  But ""The Dead Are Alive!"" excels on its own merits.  When I first shopped for this, I was looking for works by Alex Cord, who I had seen his start in ""Synanon"" and in 1966's re-make of ""Stagecoach"" in the John Wayne role and felt he had made that film for me and I was somewhat disappointed he had not seemed to go on to bigger things and I thought he had perhaps gone the route of making spaghetti westerns, I am not sure.  But then this film came up and I saw his co-star was Samantha Eggar, the exciting star of ""The Collector"" and ""Return from the Ashes"" who too unfortunately made the unappealing comedy ""Walk Don't Run"" and the disastrous ""Doctor Doolittle"" when her career was taking off.  In no time she was making TV movies like the re-make of ""Double Indemnity."" No one was looking when she gave great performances in ""The Lady in the Car With Glasses and a Gun"" and ""The Walking Stick."" So, it was a no brainer for me.  Then, it being Italian, I quickly saw there were a number of editions of it out there, some reportedly terrible and even a Sinister Cinema edition which further impressed me, but I knew I had to have the best for this film and prayed for an affordable vendor of the Code Red edition when I went to order and my prayers were answered.  It is really one of the better giallos, very exciting and stylish, and the stars are put to good use and look very beautiful together.  Crispino deserves his attention now.  He has something on the other great giallo directors, something that propels his work into other canons.  The DVD presents a page saying that the studio could not be responsible for views stated in interviews, but there was no menu or extras besides the preview trailer at the beginning.  Otherwise an adequate and not disappointing copy with blemishes and murky audio during times when the film is at black, but overall worth the extra money.  I don't want to think of what the other editions are like as their were complaints including Sinister Cinema's unsurpassed value.  Definitely something you can watch multiple times and still get new things.  ""The Dead Are Alive!""",1346716800,2,2488,4.586907449209932
8196444,1,B000QGYYS2,"I liked the movie a lot, it's no zombie movie (see the cover art), but a giallo (Italian thriller with lots of gore). But this dvd (on the Eurovista label) is horrible!! It looks like a very old videotape, with scratches, parts missing etc. The widescreen is too wide, parts on top (heads of the actors!) and bottom of the image are cut off. I regret buying this dvd, especially because it was very expensive. I read that there's a much better version (Red Code label), I'm going to buy that one. That version is also expensive, but you get a better dvd!",1334966400,,554,4.388349514563107
8196445,2,B000QGYYS2,"I'm a huge fan of horror, Italian horror and giallo but I could not get into this movie. It did nothing for me. I tried to watch it but stopped each time. Maybe ill give it another chance though.",1284854400,,195,4.0256410256410255
8196446,5,B000QGYYS2,"Starring Samantha Eggar and Alex Cord this classy genre-crossing Italian Horror was written and directed in 1972 by Armando Crispino who made the excellent Autopsy in 1973. The Code Red print I have is very good with sharp detail of exteriors and interiors and good flesh colours. The town of Spoleto where the film is located consists of blocks of Italian-gothic buildings joined by oneway streets and spooky alleyways. The acting in dubbed films will always seem a little wooden but here I thought the characters were eventually quite well developed. The directing style is similar to Autopsy but the story couldn't be more different, the visual style and a subplot concerning archeology will probably make this film appeal to the majority of 'chicks' despite the violent sexy content. For horrorblokes your The Dead Are Alive guide to essential Italian Horror ingredients is as follows: 1)There is a lot of blood which seems to be of the correct colour. 2)The body count is 7/8 of which several victims are graphic. 3)There are at least 3 sexy females one of whom is photographed naked from the side and rear. The camera loves her. If you enjoy this title try Dario Argento's Inferno.",1282953600,6,1187,4.91044776119403
8196447,3,B000QGYYS2,"After the Eurovista edition comes this new dvd from Code Red of the italian thriller ""L'Etrusco Uccide Ancora"" (The Etruscan Kills Again) by Armando Crispino. The cover incorretly states anamorphic, format is 2.31:1 letterboxed 16/9 enhanced; the image is quite strong but a little soft and there are numerous scratches and little signs of wear around the reel changes. The audio is muddy at times but dialogue remains clear. No menus whatsoever the movie begins with a trailer as intro. Region 0 NTSC",1281312000,4,501,5.048192771084337
8196448,4,B000QGYYS2,"From the title, you may be thinking that this is another 'Morti Viventi' excursion from Italy but, surprise, it emerges as a gripping, giallo who-done-it taking place at an ancient etruscan dig.  Director Armando Crispino slowly builds his film around red herring set pieces practically bouncing Alex Cord and Samantha Eggar off walls. With some extremely gory effects for its time , the film ,along with Mario Bavas' 'BAY OF BLOOD', is an early version of the slice and dice genre so prominent in the late seventies.  I am looking forward for this release because BCI has given us such excellent transfers of Euro-horrors in the past.  The Eurovista release has numerous splices and scratches which disrupt the action, hopefully , this edition will give the film the reputation it deserves in the giallo canon.",1278115200,4,811,4.992592592592593

It has been officially released, but the high price one from Eurovista is a dvdr. Search for the official release (on Code Red) of this item.",1257206400,,311,4.456140350877193
