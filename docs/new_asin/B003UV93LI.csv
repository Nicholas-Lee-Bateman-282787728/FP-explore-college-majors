8586892,5,B003UV93LI,"This movie really makes me miss Louisiana and why I love New Orleans especially. It was about the heart of the city we rarely get to see, the culture the people and not just beads and boobs. As soon as I was done watching I was already planning my Mardi Gras trip for next year. I have seen other films done by Todd Berger on the festival scene and I expect he will soon be a household name.",1291593600,2,391,4.0256410256410255

I'm a New Orleanian and experienced this dilemma first hand. New Orleans had gone through an unbelievable crisis with Katrina, but giving up on Mardi Gras would have been another trauma to our way of life - emotionally and economically. I guess it made a difference that the filmmaker was a New Orleanian himself and had the depth of background to be sensitive to both sides. He seems to have gotten to people at the heart of what was really going on at the time in making this landmark decision in our rebuilding. This documentary does a great job capturing what citizens and those behind the scenes were weighing about when and how to restore pieces of their cultural heritage, while rebuilding other parts of their lives. And it does it while remaining interesting and amusing throughout.",1281916800,2,1021,5.859060402684563
