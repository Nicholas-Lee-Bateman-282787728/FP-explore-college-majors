4711532,2,B005J4TLQ6,"Rule number one of comedy is broken.  The top notch cast all bring their A game but the script simply ties their hands behind their backs.  This is the first time I have found Jim Gaffigan ""unfunny."" I admit to being mildly amused at some of the mega church ""isms"" but not at the 3rd rate murder, greed, lust, and conspiracy bologna slices they throw at the wall.",1350345600,2,363,4.323529411764706

4711534,5,B005J4TLQ6,"4.5 stars

I found this unexpectedly hilarious, but should have known Gaffigan wouldn't pick a dog; he's quietly funny here and no doubt headed for a hot pocket acting career. Brosnan is perfect, as are Harris and Connelly and pretty much everyone, and Kinnear brings it all together with a typically crisp nice-guy-done-wrong performance, playing straight man so everyone else can get the laughs.

And there are plenty, due to a tight script that moves along briskly while dropping all sorts of uncomfortable truth bombs along the way. But what really sells this flick is the excellent cinematography. There are many scenes with unique and unexpected lighting, often keeping one side of a face in darkness, which works symbolically and graphically, giving the film a somewhat noir feel at times in contrast to the many brightly lit outdoor shots.

This sort of duality is constant, and director Ratliff clearly knew precisely what he was going for, and got it. He assembled a wonderful cast and coaxed sharp performances from everybody---and how did he get Hinds, a truly great classical actor? The guy can sure be funny too, and I'd love to see more of him in these bit parts. His face has so much character. Ditto the unfairly forgotten Tomei, who needs to be in plenty more movies; she brings such a good feel to her roles, likable in the nicest way, like Kinnear. He can go from near-slapstick to real feeling in a blink, and that helps Salvation Boulevard work as well as it does.

Ratliff really nailed this one, with so many details spot on. He even picked a couple of exceptional and apropos GD live jams for the soundtrack, instead of the usual studio fare. And the comparison of the holy life vs the Jerry life has some moments of real hilarity to boot; I smell a tourhead in here somewhere.

All in all, one of the best cinematic surprises I've had in many a moon, and bound to be a cult classic as the years truck on by.",1348272000,3,1933,4.640350877192983
4711535,5,B005J4TLQ6,"Watching Salvation Boulevard, I realized that satire was never going to be the funniest form of comedy.  Ever since Swift penned&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-Modest-Proposal/dp/1453691693/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A Modest Proposal</a>, whatever laughs there are in these dark artistic works have been nervous and mixed with horror and revulsion.

So it is with ""Salvation Boulevard,"" not the darkest comedy I've ever seen, but plenty dark, disturbing, and sometimes violent.  But in the service of deflating piety, hypocrisy, and egomania, the atmosphere feels entirely appropriate.

The movie starts with a debate between Pastor Dan Day (Pierce Brosnan) and atheist Peter Blaylock (Ed Harris).  Having watched similar debates between various clerics and religious apologists and the likes Richard Dawkins and the late, great Christopher Hitchens, the script and direction gets the tone mostly right and mines the hubris and false confidence (of both parties) for laughs.  The scene also serves to introduce us to most of the key characters, including Carl Vanderveer (Greg Kinnear), a former Deadhead who has had a radical conversion to an evangelical form of Christianity and married a seemingly holy woman, who has a saner-than-she-should be teen daughter.

Not nearly as broad as ""Saved!""--a satire in a similar vein--""Boulevard"" deals with Pastor Dan accidentally shooting atheist Blaylock (which rather than killing him, puts him in a coma) and trying to pin the shooting on Carl.  Because all of this happens within the opening minutes of the movie, no spoiler alert was called for, but from that point on the surprises begin to stack up and to say more would be to rob the reader of those moments of shock and humor.  Suffice to say that contemporary Christianity as practiced by celebrity mega-church leadership and attendees comes in for some well-deserved parody.

To any person of faith tempted to cry foul and offer ""Boulevard"" as just one more example of Christianity coming under unfair fire in America, I would say that not a week goes by that a new Christian movie doesn't show up in Red Box rental kiosks or the local megaplexes, so your privilege is still intact; and if you don't like being made fun of, start acting to drive the clowns and con artists from your midst.  Is making fun of Christian hypocrisy like shooting fish in a barrel?  Hell yes, and it's because sincere, honest people of faith don't do all they can to shut up people like Jack Van Impe, the idiots on Trinity Broadcasting, and the various charlatans and faith healers who ply their craft over the airwaves and in opulent cathedrals.  If you were to criticize these sickening, slick shysters as thoroughly as they deserve, there might be less ammunition left for those of us who don't share your faith.

As it stands, there is a need for movies like ""Salvation Boulevard,"" to remind us--votaries and infidels alike--that the human condition is more complex and absurd than any single worldview can accommodate, and among the worst ideas for addressing that condition is religion.",1348099200,6,3121,5.266129032258065
4711536,3,B005J4TLQ6,"""I am the anointed servant of God and I tell you to be silent!"" Deadhead turned born-again-Christian Carl (Kinnear) is friends with the pastor of his local mega-church Dan Day (Brosnan) and is invited to accompany him to scientist Dr. Paul Blaylock's (Harris) house for a discussion. When a terrible accident happens Carl finds himself fingered in the incident and does everything he can to prove he is innocent. Things aren't always easy though. Having never seen a preview for this I was excited for this based off the cast alone. While I will say this is a good movie and a very dark comedy I was a little disappointed. The main flaw this had was that the movie had a good idea but had only ten minutes of it. There was a lot of repeating going on and a few scenes that seemed like they were only put in to increase the running time. I have to say that Brosnan and Kinnear played very similar parts to the ones they played in ""The Matador"" (which is a better movie) but it seems to fit them. It may sound like I'm bashing this movie. I don't mean to if that's how it comes off. I did enjoy it and laughed a few times but based off the cast I was a little disappointed (but after movies like ""Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy"" and ""Son Of No One"" I need to stop thinking just because the cast is great means the movie will be great.) Overall, a decent dark comedy that is worth watching but tone down your expectations. I give it a B-.",1343779200,9,1430,4.261029411764706

4711550,4,B005J4TLQ6,"Greg Kinnear stars as Carl Vandermeer, an ex-deadhead, recently converted to Christianity. He is a devoted member of charismatic pastor Dan Day (Pierce Brosnan)'s megachurch. After Day accidentally shoots a man, Carl, as the only witness, gets into a lot of trouble.

Carl is a good lead character and Kinnear makes him funny, yet warm. The casting of Irish Brosnan as an evangelical pastor is a bit of a surprise but works very well. He's sleazy, manipulative and gives theatrical, emotional sermons. The supporting cast is great too, includig Jennifer Connelly, Marisa Tomei, Ciaran Hinds and Isabelle Fuhrman. Ed Harris seems to be in it for the name value; he doesn't have many scenes.

Carl Vandermeer (Kinnear) is an ex-Deadhead who stumbled upon an Evangelical megachurch and supposedly found Jesus. Carl is married to church member, Gwen (Connelly), who is a bit infatuated with the megalomaniac pastor, Dan Day (Brosnan). Day accidentally shoots his atheist debate opponent and tries to pin the blame on Carl. Following several twists and turns, Day is arrested and sent to prison while Carl divorces Gwen, quits the faith, and goes back to being a Deadhead.

Most Evangelicals would probably take offense to this film. Christians are depicted as brainwashed idiots manipulated by their shyster pastors. Unfortunately, there've been more than a few unscrupulous Evangelical pastors caught in public scandals the past few decades, no debate about that. While I'm an Evangelical Christian I think I can take a little ribbing from mocking unbelievers. ""Above all you must understand that in the last days scoffers will come, scoffing and following their own evil desires"" - 2 Peter 3:3. But the thing about this movie is it's unredeemabley bad.

I have to order a new remote from the manufacturer of my DVD player because I wore out the ""Details"" button by checking every five minutes to see how much time was left on this clunker. WARNING: The 90 minutes of your life that you waste on this film can never be regained. If you spend those 90 minutes reading the Gospel of John and come to understand that Jesus Christ died for you and that your sins will be wiped away if you accept Him as your Savior, well, that would be a much better investment.

8475436,5,B005J4TLQ6,"Anyone put off by the title can relax, this movie is not a diabolical assault on Christianity. It's not even about religion. It's just an exceedingly droll dark comedy reminiscent of Cohen Brothers movies (Fargo, O Brother Where Art thou?). This film won't sorely test anyone's faith.

OK, the malefactor here is a sleazy TV preacher. But hey, he's really sincere, folks!

The plot revolves around sleazy but charismatic TV preacher (Brosnon), one of his faithful flock of sheep--a hapless former Grateful Deadhead (Kinnear), a hard-boiled writer (Harris) & a dubious real estate development (hence the title).

Salvation Boulevard is a scaled-down version of the book by Larry Beinhart, who also wrote WAG THE DOG (originally titled AMERICAN HERO). The book was better, as usual, since there was much more to it, but the director succeeds in bringing its dark humor to the screen.

The production quality is first-rate, with fine acting by a stellar cast, a devastatingly wry script full of nice twists & great lines, even a perfectly suited soundtrack.

Salvation Boulevard is not your typical inane comedy. The humor is subtle & dry, with nuanced metaphors & lots of double-entendres. There are achingly funny scenes & laugh-out-loud moments, but it's not for the thin-skinned or easily-offended. Although it isn't really about religion, it is about hypocrisy, self-deception & the pitfalls of credulity. Ignore the bad reviews, some of which were no doubt by viewers who simply didn't understand it.

Dark comedies are hard to pull off, which is why you don't see more of them. (Plus the fact that America itself has become a rather dark comedy.) This one especially, given the subject matter. Kudos to the producers & director for a brave satire destined to become a classic.
