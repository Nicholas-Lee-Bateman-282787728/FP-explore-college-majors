5399692,5,B00A8KJMP6,"The 3-series TV spectacle is now complete in one set. If you've not purchased all or part individually, then this is the opportunity. Every episode is 5-star worthy, if not more. This is a set containing 12 great movie-length stories.

Historical drama is done to the excellence level of ""Foyle's War."" British courtroom drama from 1792. This series won a ""Best History"" award. It is absolute perfection in late-18th century historical reproduction in sets, costumes, & dialogue. Plots, cases, and people are from real British history of criminal court--""The Old Bailey."" Rumpole of the Bailey made this court popular on TV, but this series now documents TRUE historical beginnings of criminal justice for the accused. Even some of the dialogue was taken from court records. It was Sir William Garrow (1760-1840) who lead the way and coined: ""Innocent until proven guilty."" He was accepted to the bar in 1783. In real life, and the TV series, he is idealistic, a Robin Hood for the poor and unfairly arrested. He is young, eager, wayward, belligerent, rash, arrogant, inexperienced, loud, but often a winner. This set resembles the poor depicted in Catherine Cookson TV adaptations--a must own series as well.

Excellent cast:
Andrew Buchan (Cranford) is Garrow, in looks and attitude. He could be played no better.
Lyndsey Marshall (Being Human) plays Lady Sarah Hill, exquisite in acting as well as filling her delightful period aristocracy costumes.
Alun Armstrong (Little Dorrit, New Tricks) plays the true-to-history character, John Southouse, Garrow's mentor, a solicitor (attorney).
Michael Culkin (The Hours, Lolita) is Judge Buller, mostly ruthless.
Rupert Graves (Forsyte Sage, Death at a Funeral-see the UK version) plays MP Sir Arthur, Sarah's spouse.
Aidan McArdle (The Duchess, Ella Enchanted) is another REAL historical figure, John Silvester, a proud, rich, barrister who constantly opposes Garrow.

Costumes astound in their sumptuous accuracy. Edinburgh, Dumbarton, and Glasgow were filming sites. Music is as fine as the interior sets. Dynamic dialogue offers periodic comedy. This is more like a historical documentary than TV drama. The presentation is suspenseful, dramatic, and as finely done as anything on today's TV schedule.
Not just 5 stars, but PLATNUM STARS.

12 SUBTITLED feature-length episodes plus plenty of bonus as good as the features.
You'll see guest stars. One of my all-time favorite British series.",1357689600,36,2440,5.37958115183246

5399703,2,B00A8KJMP6,"I am a fan of the BBC series BROADCHURCH, so I went looking for TV shows and movies starring some of the actors I liked in BROADCHURCH. I picked GARROW'S LAW because of Andrew Buchan. It seemed like a legal drama based on a historical character set in the 18th century would be a good choice, but it was a serious disappointment on all levels.
Everything seemed ""off"" in this series from the music to the writing to the photography. Of course, the period costumes were great but nice costumes can't make up for a bad story.
The music was irritating and the cinematography looked like something out of high school--poor quality and cheap looking.  I had trouble understating the dialogue and the story. Sometimes it seemed like the story was playing a lot on comedy.  I could only get through a few episodes and had to give up. Other reviewers seem to love the series but at $41, this seemed like a serious waste of time and money.",1441670400,,930,4.497041420118343

5399706,4,B00A8KJMP6,"The only complaint I have is that the set arrived with a ""punched-in"" spot about the size of a quarter in the center of the front of the outer box. It isn't enough to make me return it, as the discs inside were unharmed, but needless to say, i'my not real happy about it. However, in fairness,  I must say that this is the first thing I've ever gotten from Amazon with even slight damage. As to the series itself, this is one of the best English dramas I have ever seen. The story and performances were powerful, the characters were well-drawn and intriguing, and the period costumes and settings were delightful. The most fascinating this about it, though,  is the fact that it is based on true events and the life of a man whose knowledge of the law and exploits in the courtroom helped to change and shape English law, and by extension ours. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who is interested in historical drama, English history, or the evolution of the law as we know it.",1440028800,2,987,4.447513812154696

5399728,5,B00A8KJMP6,"""Garrow's Law"" is so interesting. It boggles the mind when you watch the cases and think, wait a minute, they can't do that - when, of course, they can. The law was evolving (as it still does today), and Garrow was in the thick of it. Each episode stars a new case, and all of them are based on real cases tried in England during the time period.

Garrow (the real Garrow) was called to the Bar in 1783, and made his name as counsel for the defence (Brit for defense) - the period we see in the TV show. In 1793, though, he did rise to become a King's prosecutor, and was eventually knighted.

The characters in these three series are great, and knowing it's based on real-life makes it even better. Charlotte Edgar, an extra, speaks in bonus feature #3: ""I've been looking at some of the cases in the Old Bailey archives. For the 1st series, it was interesting to see, thre was an exchange between a thief-taker and Garrow. And I noticed that in the actual shoot, the lines were pretty much the same.""

She's talking about the website,
oldbaileyonline(dot)org
If you'd like do a little fun perusing of the kind of cases William Garrow handled, check it out. It's an online listing of cases heard in the Old Bailey between 1674 and 1913. It doesn't always give a lot of detail. Sometimes, though, an entry includes a full transcript, questions and answers, the older ones in ""old English"". These include transcripts of actual William Garrow court appearances. I found the following entry for a court case involving Sir William, which occurred years after those shown in the TV series:

LAWRENCE HALLORAN , alias LAWRENCE HYNES HALLORAN , alias WILLIAM CHARLES GREGORY , was indicted for that he, after the 1st of July, 1802, to wit, on the 9th of January, in the 57th year of his Majesty's reign , feloniously did forge and counterfeit the hand-writing of a certain person, to wit, Sir William Garrow , Knt. , the said Sir William Garrow, then being a member of the Commons House of Parliament of the United Kingdom, and being entitled to send letters by the post to places within the said United Kingdom, free from the duty of postage, in the superscription of a letter to be sent, and which was afterwards sent, by the post, to wit, from London to Broseley, in the county of Salop, in order to avoid the payment of the duty of postage upon and in respect of the said letter, against the statute .
ELEVEN OTHER COUNTS, varying the manner of laying the charge.
To which indictment the prisoner pleaded
GUILTY . Aged 53.
Transported for Seven Years .
First Middlesex Jury, before Mr. Baron Graham

5399758,5,B00A8KJMP6,"What a brilliant, delightful, inspiring and entertaining piece! This is based on a true story and legal cases from the late 1700's ~ still very relevant for today.

The young, barrister apprentice William Garrow decided to change the legal system from the corrupt entertainment spectacle to a system seeking the truth and justice.

Often to appease the masses, poor innocent people were arrested with no counsel. People were paid off or made deals to give false testimony and/or evidence. This included judges, prosecutors, accusers and witnesses. As Mr. Garrow saw this while studying courtroom procedures, he was shocked and committed to see justice served.

It also shows how Sarah Hill a woman who also wanted a healthy and just change, was limited by social standards, but did what she could to support and contribute to the historical shift in trials, the handling of evidence and the accused.

The stories include court cases researched from the Old Bailey archives. The acting, directing, costuming and sets are great!

Mr. Garrow is the barrister who changed the phrase from ""guilty until proven innocent"" ~ a hopeless possibility for most ~ to what is almost regularly used today, ""innocent until proven guilty.""",1375056000,4,1222,5.151515151515151

Like all tales of oppression and injustice, the courage of one man who dares defy judicial inequalities mired in class corruption is an example to us all. Even now, in  the 21st Century, we, too, need such a hero.",1373587200,3,405,4.4

5399766,5,B00A8KJMP6,We enjoyed this very much and wish there were more to come.  It would have made a good ongoing series without the romance that sustained the plot in this collection.,1371340800,,165,4.5
5399767,5,B00A8KJMP6,"Telling the story of the early career of a man who became one of England's top jurists and changed the course of legal history, and doing this in a way that rivets the attention of viewers like me who have no legal or judicial background is challenging, but this series does that. Viewers can expect not only a recreation of the period costumes, manners, customs, architecture, politics, and language, but even more plausible portrayals of how the people at the turn of the eighteenth century felt and acted. British character acting in series like Poldark and Larkrise to Candleford is always superb, and none more so than in Garrow's Law. If you don't mind having to think while you are entertained, you will love this series.",1367280000,24,728,4.785714285714286
5399768,5,B00A8KJMP6,Excellent. I enjoy being able to view them more than once.  The acting is superb and I have a better understanding of the history of some of our laws.,1366156800,7,150,4.172413793103448
5399769,5,B00A8KJMP6,My husband and I really loved this series and wish there were more episodes.  We were very disconcerted to find how much it cost per episode when we ordered the first season and found we had paid almost $28 for only four episodes of approximately an hour each.  But we still ended up getting the rest of it since it was so exceptionally well done.,1364256000,10,347,4.323076923076923
5399770,5,B00A8KJMP6,"Thoroughly enjoying this series.  Very well written, acted, staged, costumed, and directed.  The stories are based on fact and trial transcripts, and are entirely believable.  You needn't be a lawyer to enjoy Garrow, but this one sure does.  Heartily recommended!",1362700800,14,263,5.5
5399771,5,B00A8KJMP6,"It is so sad that we have only 12 episodes spread across the three series of Garrows Law. Whilst this box set is to be welcomed it is also a matter of regret that the perverse decision was made to axe this very successful programme. What is particularly fascinating is that Sir William Garrow was a real historical figure in the UK. The writers of these programmes have clearly made a real effort to ensure that the episodes accord with what is known of his personal life. Additionally every episode is based on a true case from the annals of the Old Bailey in London, although not necessarily one with which Garrow was involved. Hence they provide an insight into the workings of the law a little over two hundred years ago.

Garrow is not as widely known as he deserves. Whilst this series covers the earlier part of his career when he was a barrister, he was also a Kings Counsel prosecuting cases, although he appears here as the defending counsel. Latterly he became a politician, rising to the post of Solicitor General and confirmed his forward thinking by, amongst other credentials, supporting animal rights which was quite a departure in the first part of the 19th century. This was a time when human rights were fairly generally ignored! The cases which are included in this series are interesting and varied and if you google the details of any of them, you will be able to verify that they were actual cases at the Old Bailey. Here Garrow is the champion of the accused and it is an interesting fact that he originated the phrase 'innocent until proved guilty'. He is also credited with originating the adversarial system of justice, in use in most Western countries with forthright cross examination of witnesses.

Garrow's rather complicated personal life is also based on what happened in real life. He had a long term relationship and later married Sarah, who had previously had a relationship with a Viscount. The script writer has had to fill in the gaps, however, the significant facts which can be checked out are correct. Hence this series portrays both the working life and personal life of a highly significant historical figure in an authentic manner. Andrew Buchan puts in an impressive performance in the leading role, but mention should also be made of Alun Armstrong who is very convincing as John Southouse.

It was always a valid criticism of Garrows Law that the series were so short, comprising just four episodes in each. Therefore this DVD set contains just 12 episodes, four from each of the three series. Brief though it is, it provides a fascinating insight into the workings of the UK justice system in the early 19th Century, with the added interest that it is largely based on fact.",1359158400,95,2723,4.7405063291139244

8548249,5,B00A8KJMP6,"Garrow's Law is a great series! We are enjoying the 18th Century setting and acting.  The show is based on a real barrister, William Garrow, and the stories are supposedly Old Bailey cases from that time period. Very well done, and we highly recommend the series.",1521158400,2,263,4.717391304347826
