7749409,4,B01F8DJJB4,"I agree with the previous reviews, I saw this set for $25.00 yesterday and then before I went to bed, they had uped the price.
The only reason why I would recommend this product is because I only own the first of the 3 movies (which are all good individually.) So now the price to buy this set is practically the same as if they were bought one at a time.",1465084800,3,355,4.014084507042254

7749413,5,B01F8DJJB4,"This is one of the best Manga to Film adaptations I've seen! The quality is amazing, very realistic and yet still has that semi-Manga quality. The characters look very much like their Manga counterparts and the voices are beyond perfect! I especially love Griffith's! The film covers one of the best arcs in the continued and on going series Berserk known as the Golden Age Arc. The music is between average and great. It has very epic and beautiful tracks, but also simplistic ones that are merely background fillers. (I currently have the soundtracks). It stays very true to the original series, with minor changes in dialogue and pacing of the story. I'd highly recommend this to any fan of Berserk. You will get the cinematic experience version of one of the greatest stories ever told! (Warning: This is not a kids movie! It is based off a very mature and rated R content Manga series for Adults! Do not think that just because it is animated that it is suitable for kids! There is language, very violent and graphic imagery, as well as sexual themes!)",1507766400,6,1057,4.688172043010753
7749414,3,B01F8DJJB4,"Perhaps if Id seen these three before the original series, then Id have a different opinion. As it stands now, I could barely stand it.

The animation wasn't very good compared to the old series, or in comparison to whats happening these days in animation. It couldve been much better.

The music was fine, but part of what I enjoyed so much about the old series was the music, and most (if not all) was removed and changed, if Im not mistaken. Whats left here never captured my emotions or drew me in.

The story feels extremely rushed, even in its own right. Events were not explained very clearly, and all the relationships weren't given time to be fleshed out so that we can actually care about these characters.

I read somewhere that this set went further than the old series, having two discs for the series, and the third for what happened next. Whoever wrote that was mistaken. It doesnt go any further. There are some minor scenes at the end that weren't in the show, but they're hardly anything.

I appreciate the returning cast members lending their voice talents. Thats actually something I think is really great and Im glad they were brought (at least the main cast) back.

Overall, an okay adaptation, but I would never call it an upgrade.",1507420800,3,1254,4.6008968609865475

7749418,5,B01F8DJJB4,"This show is amazing, the movies breifly skip through parts form the original anime re-animated in a modern style which flows together quite nicely. It comes on three blue ray discs with a picture of the crimson behelit rearranging on each, and a thin blue ray case that holds all three movies. The digital clairty of the movie is perfect, but the audio is a little light. I found that during most of the movies I would have to keep my remote nearby to adjust the volume to hear what people were saying.

7749424,5,B01F8DJJB4,"This is a fantastic anime that truly captures the 26 episode 1997 series in only three feature films. That being said, the action is intense and the story moves fast but not too fast that the viewer gets confused or lost. Overall this feature film adaptation of the original series does it justice and can stand separately next to the original series. I still prefer the original because of the animation style and of course the longer runtime, but I'm happy to own this collection of movies as well.

Important note:

This does not include any digital copies of the movies sadly.",1499731200,,580,4.676470588235294
7749425,1,B01F8DJJB4,"While I have a love/hate relationship with the Berserk story, these movies are a travesty. The ""golden age"" arc of the Berserk manga (and corresponding ""first season"" of the Berserk anime) are among the best stuff to come out of the disposable art of Japanese comics. Well described as a ""bull in a China shop"", the tale recounts the tragedy of the Band of the Hawk. However, what makes the manga/anime so strong is not the particular events, which could easily be summarized on a fan wiki in a page. Rather, it is the excellent character arcs, the growth and decline of relationships. However, such growth/decline can only be realized over a long period of time. Berserk (or at least, this early tale) is one of the few stories in the entirety of Japanese manga writing to fully explore such multi-dimensional facets of humans, unlike the vast majority of the pablum that (dis)graces American shelves these days.

So, what's the problem? The viewer loses completely the character momentum that leads one to scratch his chin (rather than his head) at the final events of the ""Golden Age""). And what are we left with? A spoilt story with no real momentum whatsoever.

I question any review that suggests this as an ""entry point"" of the series. I can understand (slightly) the idea that people want to see the manga/season one in a more ""modern"" view, but honestly (and excusing my bad pun), with the guts completely removed from the story, this is hardly a reason to buy. Avoid.",1498176000,3,1477,4.743190661478599

7749431,5,B01F8DJJB4,"I'll preface this by saying that this is the first Berserk content ive ever taken in. I know a lot of people who are already fans of the series dislike these movies because they leave out stuff from the manga or 90s tv show. All i knew about Berserk was that it was VERY gorey and there was a LOT of sexual content in it. These two elements are for sure also a big part of these movies. The first movie is relatively tame. There are two explicit sex scenes in the other two movies, however. There is also a graphic rape scene in the third. The gore also increases as the movies go on, the third being the most brutal. Despite all this, i absolutely loved these movies. I just figured it might be helpful for people to know if they're going in blind. The characters are well written and you really end up loving (or hating) them. The only real downside of these movies are that they end on cliffhanger. Im pretty sure there aren't more movies after this because of poor reception by fans, though im not certain. Just know that you won't get a satisfying ending.

Other than that, the discs arrived safely and my only qualm with the case is that one of the prongs that hold the first disk in place is missing completely so its easier for it to get loose and side around in the case.",1491696000,10,1280,4.245901639344262

The traditional blended with CG was not as jarring for me. Especially now that there's a new anime series that pretty much picked up after the 3rd movie, and is now about to air it second season which gets the story into the Berserker Armor Arc in the manga.

The only concern is the flip flop between CG and 2D animation.  They figure it out in the 3rd film, where the culmination of the events of the prologue bare fruit for the audience.  I have talked to other fans of the series and they convinced me to go back and watch the original anime series, but I still think this iteration is concise and does a fairly good job with the storytelling.

7749444,5,B01F8DJJB4,"These three films are a homage to berserk fans of the manga. In no way were they meant to be an introduction to the series or to represent the original story by itself. These films are a summery of the 1997 anime with additional scenes/characters added that were omitted from the 1997 adaptation. The 1997 adaptation was 25 episodes long. They omit the 1st episode of the 1997 anime and proceed to condense 24 episodes of content into 3 separate films. Just to be clear, what you are getting in purchasing this collection is essentially a highlight of a PIECE of berserk. Many niches/side stories and character development are not here because of time constraints(probably). I bought this collection because i was a fan already.

7749447,1,B01F8DJJB4,"This is not a review of the content of the films, but of this particular Blu-ray release of them. I have not seen the films and cannot review the content, but from what I understand, they're generally well-liked despite significant flaws. This review serves more as a warning to a subset of people who may not want to buy this collection based on one fundamental design flaw:

This release is only acceptable if you love anime dubs (no comment), or if you never want to turn English subtitles off. It forces English subtitles for the films if you use the Japanese audio track, which is of course ludicrous for anyone even approaching Japanese fluency. I do not watch Japanese media with subtitles, and I would remind the producers of this collection that we no longer live in the era of VHS videotapes where we were forced to choose between subbed, dubbed, or native versions of the product. Forcing subtitles is an idiotic and backwards decision with no benefit to the consumer whatsoever, and unfortunately, I'll never buy a domestic release from you again unless I can get confirmation from someone else that the product doesn't do something like this (unlikely, as I know very few people I can go to for this sort of information). I find subtitles distracting and irritating, and there's no reason to force me to keep them on. My only options to enjoy these films now are either to import a Japanese Blu-ray player and Japanese version of the films (which is 100% cost prohibitive) or resort to piracy.

I hope you'll reconsider these backward decisions in future releases.",1477612800,,1577,4.772893772893773

This anime is meant for adults, not kids. Anime contains many scenes of sexual violence, brutal rapes, and borderline hentai scenes. Most of this did not take away from the story until disc/arc 3. Story arc 3 was almost unwatchable when compared to the first 2 disc/arcs. For someone who doesnt like having rape scenes (especially those that aren't needed for the story) forced on them, I found disc/arc 3 particularly disturbing.

I haven't read the manga or seen the new 2016 episodes yet so I don't know where they were going with disc/arc 3. However I feel like people should always know when rape is going to be present in an anime so they can make the choice to watch it and be prepared.",1476144000,,956,4.584795321637427

7749454,5,B01F8DJJB4,"I enjoy anything Berserk. I've read the Manga and yes the story could have been line for line but I understand how some things were left out. This is a more of a straight to the point with no filler but also will leave you with out some of the key emotional things that makes Guts who he is was as a younger self. How he doesn't care about others and only about survival. Later in the story that side becomes his advance to becoming a reckless be real adult when he starts to care about people close to him. Trying to do anything to preserve what he has left. Guts strength and aorura is what draws characters in to him and seems to give hope those that force themself into his world no matter what the cost. This also happens to Griffith and doesnt know how to deal with it. I've also seen the 2016 season of Berserk and enjoyed it ""greatly""! It is a different way of tilling the story and refreshing. It makes what to go back and refresh myself on the manga I have on my book case. So if you are a new comer and have no history of the manga and starting from these movies you are good to go. You won't be haunted like some over the top fan but so critical about what they want to happen in the series of films. Again this is a different take on the main story. The first Anima season back in 1997 was my first known story of the Berserk world and I loved it. Once I found out about the manga and read it, I was blown away with the back story. I feel the viewer what wants a more intimate view of the story buy the manga (that's what it's there for) and you will be glad you did to get the full story of Gut and all other characters alike.",1476144000,3,1640,4.003048780487805

There is enough differences between the two series to make it worth seeing especially by disc three. Say what you want about the computer animation but that's just the way things are going get used to it.

I insert the first movie in my PS4 (1-2 years old), and it had tremendous stuttering issues until I disconnected from the internet.  The second movie would not start and would give me an error code which basically says the PS4 cannot play discs that are copied.  The third movie was unrecognizable to the PS4 and suggested that I inserted the disc upside down.

It's a good story filled with friendship, love, betrayal, sex, death, rebirth, demons, and a guy with a giant sword named Guts.  If that's not enough for you to want to watch it, I don't know what will.  This isn't an anime for the kiddies but then again who am I to tell you how to raise your children.

You aren't gonna get anything much different from the other versions of the anime but i do prefer the artwork I this version.  The price isn't bad at all.  Plus a new anime series has been released to further continue the story.",1470096000,3,635,4.163934426229508

7749489,5,B01F8DJJB4,"Worth the price, trust me. It's a good deal for three entire movies on Bluray.

As for content: it follows the Golden Age arc of the Berserk manga series. The 90's anime followed pretty much the same story. This does leave some key story points out, but also adapts other scenes and makes them interesting in their own way. The hand-drawn scenes are gorgeous, with great lighting, movement, and atmosphere. As for the occasional CGI scene: it is what it is. It's definitely not the worst CGI I've seen in anime, but if you're not a fan of it, it's mostly used for battle scenes and faraway shots, where you wouldn't really notice it anyway. But, if it's not for you, it's not for you.

Overall, I would recommend this to most people. Worth the watch, even if you've already seen the anime and/or read the manga.",1469145600,,811,4.510204081632653

7749492,5,B01F8DJJB4,"After hearing about the release of the 2016 Berserk anime and hearing good things about the 1999 anime I decided to watch the movies. Thankfully Netflix had the first movie arc and i was instantly hooked. Ended up watching the remaining two movies and enjoyed them so much that I had to buy the collection.

I've never read the manga or seen the 1999 anime so these movies really opened up my eyes to the Berserk universe and have converted a new fan. The action and story are very compelling and the third movie is just insane. Don't let your kids watch due to some lewd scenes.

Really glad that I watched these before even watching Berserk 2016 since these movies are basically a prequel.

Lastly, I'd like to say that the last anime movie that left an impression of this magnitude on me would be AKIRA.

It is basically a condensed version of the previous entries, all digital, with new voice recording by the same cast. Since it is all thrown together, there is quite a bit that was cut out from the original due to time. While this was upsetting at first (because it almost feels rushed), it has more flow and is enjoyable overall. There are added scenes that help complete the story, especially towards the end.

7749501,3,B01F8DJJB4,"Being a huge fan of the original Berserk Anime, and having read some of the manga back when it was released, and playing through both video games,  I can honestly say that I'm not that impressed with this iteration. I've been anxiously awaiting for a continuation of Berserk, but this is more of an abridged retelling of the original. Think of it as the Dragon Ball Kai version.  Yes it includes the Skull Knight & a brief Puck appearance, but other than that it feels like an incomplete remake more than anything. Most of the characters Besides Casca, Griffith, and Guts are ignored, In fact Pippin's name isn't even mentioned until the 3rd act. The only scenes that were more detailed than the original were the ""hentai"" sex scenes which, if anything took away from the experience IMO. The animation is good and does take some getting used to, but it grew on me & the returning voice actors did a great job reprising their rules

Overall I would advise against purchasing this if you already have the Original. If you must see the additional Skull knight and expanded Eclipse scene, then simply purchase the 3rd and Final act.

Yet again this leaves me, eagerly anticipating a NEW Berserk release.",1467331200,4,1199,4.695238095238095

It does take out some important stuff, but overall, it hits all the major points; some even the old anime missed. These movies are really only meant to get someone interested in the series, but they are still a must watch. Granted, it contains some rather graphic content, so don't let your kids watch it. I love this series, and I really think these movies are worth it.

When it comes to this 3-disc collection, I think the price is a great deal, and the three movies in one case is definitely worth it.

That's all.",1466380800,,315,4.851851851851852
7749505,5,B01F8DJJB4,"Great movies here.  I wish they would have continued with the story, there is a whole lot more of the manga that they can convert into anime.  It's a great price at $25, because before this, the individual movies were pretty expensive to pick up.  If it stays at $25 pick it up, I know it went up to $40 a few days ago and then back to $25, so I'm not sure what's going on with that, but if you're reading this review and the price is still $25, I'd say that's a really good deal.

The packaging is the basic blu ray case with the three discs inside.  No slipcover or fancy packaging.  The discs themselves are colored brightly and look pretty good and better than the average blu ray IMO.

The movies are basically lifted straight from the first arc of the Berserk manga.  This ain't for kids.  It's not Naruto, and it's not DBZ.  There are no happy endings with Berserk.  Instead you get something gritty, action packed and downright amazing.  I'd recommend this to anyone who is over the age of 18 and can appreciate some of the more adult themes.

For those of you who have played the dark souls series of games on PS4, well those games reminded me of this manga.  It's pretty similar in tone.",1465689600,4,1197,4.285714285714286

If its offered here even around that price I recommend you pick it up. Berserk is one of my all time favorite pieces of media. Great characters and character development. It's dramatic and addicting like a girls soap opera kind of way, but Berserk (the anime, movies, and manga) also deal with very dark human truths (survival of the fittest, selfishness, no such thing as happy endings in life). Its just a really special piece of story telling",1465344000,3,596,4.685714285714286

Though after watching disc one I discovered this to be incorrect, it is in fact an entirely new series. But with certain scenes that were in the aforementioned dvd set. Having said that, I really enjoyed the first disc's movie. The animation is a combination of hand drawn and CGI visuals, which look almost 3D in their presentation! It's also incredibly bloody and violent, but it also has a lot of emotional depth to counter the violence. The characters face significant dilemmas after certain actions are taken that affect the world around them. While definitely not intended for anyone under the age of at least 16 or 17, this is an impressive collection for discriminating anime fans, and should be in their collections. It ranks right up there with Vampire Hunter D Bloodlust, in my opinion at least.",1465257600,20,916,4.878205128205129

Although there are some canon omissions in this telling - most likely for the sake of pacing, focus on more central story lines, etc. - it was an overall excellent experience to see the tale of the 'Golden Age' arc brought to life on screen. While I understand some of the deserved criticism about the blend of traditional animation and CGI (especially noticeable during large-scale battle scenes) the character-centric, interpersonal moments between primary actors (and their facial expressions/reactions being done in a 2D medium, thankfully) made up for some of these shortcomings and do a fantastic job of conveying the weight of each character's decisions and consequences; the film does well in making a viewer both realize and understand their individual motivations and shortcomings. Sometimes a manga-to-film adaptation depicts certain moments in print so perfectly (Skull Knight interrupting the ascension of Femto, in my mind) and while this film is not without its flaws, it does an incredible job interpreting its source material to the best of the medium and does it well just enough to rank it at five stars for me.",1519171200,2,1240,5.143564356435643
