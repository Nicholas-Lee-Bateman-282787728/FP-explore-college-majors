8567773,5,B00BFHIYLO,"This three disc Blu-Ray movie boxset, arrived on time and intact, with no damage to either the three discs or the case that the three discs came in. Picture, sound and features playback is superb. I would recommend this three disc Blu-Ray movie set, to anyone who purchases it online from amazon.com. All three Beverly Hills Cop movies look as good today as when they were first shown back in the late 1980's and early 1990's.",1427932800,,426,4.618421052631579
