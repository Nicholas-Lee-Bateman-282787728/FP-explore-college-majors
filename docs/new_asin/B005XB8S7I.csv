8488519,2,B005XB8S7I,"This could have been a good, informative video, if not for the host Shari Belafonte.  She's the daughter of far left activist and singer Harry Belafonte, and she apparently absorbed all of his fanatical beliefs over the dinner table.  She can't get through the video without CONSTANTLY talking about slaves, the slave trade, slave goods, slave history, and how terrible white people are.  She mentions island monkeys at one point, and just had to mention that they were brought over on slave ships.  Very tiresome, preachy, out of place, and unfair.

Unfortunately, even when she's not talking about slavery, the rest of the video feels like a commercial for a few shops that must have paid her to be included.  Don't waste your time.",1514246400,,734,4.879032258064516
