782183,2,6304092350,"I thought Craig Fairbrass gave a solid performance. But there was a lot of standing around. The director should have kept the human characters moving. And these low-budget monster movies, with their cheap special effects, desperately need better music: a combination of creepy, spooky music when the characters are moving slowly or standing around, blended with snappy music when the characters are on the move. Movie music would seem to be inexpensive, and this movie didn't seem have much of either. This movie is thus fine to watch for free on Amazon Prime, but I wouldn't pay to see it.",1469318400,,590,4.91

In that respect, it is a bit like Pumpkinhead, Chromeskull & The Crazies, although all those movies are superior. This doesn't have the most interesting characters, and the story about the drug smuggling is needlessly convoluted. But where slimy creature effects are concerned, it is a real tour de force...not sure what year this came out, but I'll bet it wasn't long before the point when CGI began edging such practical effects to the side of the stage, at least for most reasonably budgeted studio films.

782883,5,6304092350,"I wasn't sure what to expect, but I'd heard good things. This documentary blew me out of the water. The music, writing, narration, animation, and information were all pitch-perfect. I'm a Joss Whedon fanboy, but director David Lebrun has my vote to helm the third Avengers movie. It might take two decades to arrive in theaters, but you could be sure that every element would well-thought-out and gripping. Lebrun brings the sensibility of a populist crowd-pleaser to an arcane juncture of art and science in ""Proteus.""

Lebrun is the ultimate auteur because, front to back, the vision for ""Proteus"" is entirely his--but even so, he is eager to collaborate humbly with experts who bring something extra to the project. The information above is wrong--there ARE special features, including a making-of feature that is almost as interesting and inspiring as the feature, as Lebrun explains the process he followed making ""Proteus."" He consulted experts in many fields and incorporated the good suggestions into the film, and sought the best talent available for narration, music, and sound design.

What emerges from this effort is a biography of Ernst Haeckel, a fresh take on ""The Rime of the Ancient Mariner,"" a psychedelic freak-out animation journey using radiolarians, a history lesson on the great scientific journey of a ship called ""Challenger,"" a peek into Romantic spirituality, and, in the special features, the sterling example of a man following his muse to the ends of the earth in a singular vision. Any one of those elements would be enough to recommend this DVD, but taken together, the results should be irresistible to all but the most jaded lover of knowledge and visual art.",1396828800,,1694,5.089928057553957

This stunning documentary not only revealed the depths of Haeckel's biological research, but has made me want to read more of his work.

782888,3,6304092350,"The creature effects, when they finally arrive, are fun.  What's most remarkable about this one is that some of the characters actually exhibit some common sense--they gather up all the weapons they can and determine to stick together.  Unfortunately, they are the least observant people in the world.  In one scene, we see some glop assemble itself into a creature while one of the characters wanders around the room.  Toward the end of the sequence, we see a foot-level shot of the creature, which must be the size of a steer, and we see the character's feet walk near.  The feet are POINTED at the monster, meaning there's no way he could have missed it unless he was completely blind.  In other scene, a character is painfully and noisily ingested, and people on the other side of a curtain don't take any notice.  Overall, this is a decent time-waster, better than some in the same budget range.  It's also shot in the squarest aspect ratio I've ever seen.  Director Bob Keen is better known as a makeup effects artist--he worked on the Hellraiser films, and an unrecognizable Doug Bradley even shows up at one point.

782987,5,6304092350,"""Proteus"" is by no means a 5 star film at all, It has many flaws but it is a very underrated creature feature horror film in my opinion. I awarded ""Proteus"" 5 stars not only because I grew up with the movie and it brings back memories but I also think it is hated on a little bit too much, Compare this to your SyFy movie of the week and ""Proteus"" looks like John Carpenter's ""The Thing"" which Proteus rips off of. The plot of the film is something like this:

Group of heroin smugglers finds shelter on abandoned oil rig after their ship had exploded. Soon they find that the oil rig was just cover for biological experiment. One of the results is Charlie - shape-shifting monster with ability to absorb the memory of its victims. However, even such creatures have their own bad habits.

That is the plot on IMDB and that is a very accurate description of the film. Proteus is what you get when you mix ""Leviathan"" and John Carpenter's ""The Thing"" together but then you take away most of the budget and known actors. ""Proteus is directed by Bob Keen who did make-up effects on horror classics such as ""Hellraiser"" and ""Candyman"" and he also did special effects on films like ""Event Horizon"" and ""Waxwork"" among others. I really liked the make-up and special effects in ""Proteus"" even though in the final act, The monster looked a bit too mechanical however the design of the monster is pretty awesome and I always preferred practical effects over CGI.

Craig Fairbrass(""Cliffhanger"") stars as Alex in the film and the film also features Ricco Ross(""Aliens"") in a small role and a cameo by Doug Bradley(""Pinhead"" from ""Hellraiser""). Fairbrass does a good job as the lead and pretty much carries the film as the other actors are pretty much mediocre at best. It is definitely an interesting horror flick and I did not find it boring at all as it is only an hour and a half long.

The Film: 3.5 out of 5

Now, I am going to talk about this Italian Import DVD which I bought. Sadly, There are only two releases of ""Proteus"" and that is the UK Region 2 DVD which I heard was terrible so I stayed away from buying that and then there is the All Region PAL Disc Italian Import which I bought. I was fooled in a way, Not by the description on Amazon because that is an accurate description of the DVD, I was fooled because this All Region DVD will not work on US Standard Region 1 DVD players because this DVD is a PAL disc instead of a NTSC Disc so it will not work as PAL discs do not work on Region 1 DVD players. The DVD of course has no special features at all but you are able to put the film in English and take the subtitles off. The picture quality is an average VHS tape transfer at best as it is very grainy and the company who released this obviously did not put any effort into the DVD.

I hope ""Proteus"" gets a DVD release on Region 1 and I hope it can be restored and actually maybe the picture might be a little nice but the chances of that are slim to none. I recommend ""Proteus"" but do not spend your money on this terrible DVD and watch it online instead.

The DVD: 1 out of 5",1343779200,,3088,4.277397260273973
782988,4,6304092350,"DEA agent Alex is in big trouble with his superior. It seems a routine undercover mission to bust a gang of heroin smugglers went awry, and Alex not only didn't recover the drugs, but he didn't arrest anyone. His boss wants answers. Cue flashback (i.e. the rest of the film).

Alex and another agent named Rachel, who is also his girlfriend, had been assigned to pose as drug dealers and infiltrate a gang of smugglers. The gang, consisting of Mark, his girlfriend Christine, Paul and Paul's girlfriend Linda, are strictly small-timers. Indeed, they're so inept that they accidentally sink and explode their own yacht while transporting the heroin on the open ocean, leaving them and the two undercover agents stranded in a lifeboat.

Alex takes charge, to the annoyance of supposed leader Paul. They drift aimlessly until they come upon a dead body floating in the water, a security guard in a uniform that says ""Brinkstone"" on it. Afterwards, they run into an oil rig owned by Brinkstone, which it turns out is a corporation, except one none of them have ever heard of. Once they're aboard, discover the rig is actually a front for a top secret research laboratory but can find no one around. Just lots of empty clothes and discarded weapons, which of course they appropriate for themselves. They explore, finding various clues, including a big empty aquarium.

The group beds down for the night, taking the missing scientists' rooms for themselves, each couple to a room. Paul, it turns out, still has some heroin hidden on himself, and he rations some out to junkie Mark. On his way back to Linda however, something attacks him and drags him away. Alex and the others come running, but find only Paul's dropped stash of heroin. Whilst pursuing whatever it is that got Paul, they encounter an apparent survivor, a scientist named Dr. Shelley. Shelley can't answer where Paul has got to, but does reveal that what attacked him is something named ""Charlie."" He assures them Charlie is ""under control now,"" and then wanders off and disappears.

Deciding to investigate more for himself, Alex finds a room with video equipment containing tapes about something Brinkstone was working on called the Proteus Experiment. Proteus was intended to create the ultimate organism which can survive anything, and adapt to any environment. The experiment turned an ordinary great white shark (the original inhabitant of that big aquarium), nicknamed Charlie by the scientists into a genetic freak which can shapeshift, turning itself into slime and absorbing the minds and bodies of its victims and also occasionally taking their form to trick more victims.

The consumed people are still conscious inside of Charlie's brain, but mostly entirely helpless; only the most strong willed (such as Dr. Shelley) can exert themselves as the dominant personality long enough to use Charlie's shapeshifting abilities to turn its body into theirs, so they can try and warn the others... but Charlie always regains control.

Trapped aboard the rig with a mutant killer, can Alex and the others survive? Well, obviously Alex will, since he's telling this story as a flashback, but what of the others, particularly his girlfriend and fellow DEA agent Rachel...?

This is a fairly decent adaptation of the novel Slimer by Harry Adam Knight (a pseudonym of John Brosnan). A much better effort than Roger Corman's horrible Carnosaur. Most likely because John Brosnan himself wrote the script. There's some swapping around of the characters' roles from the novel. For instance, in the book, Paul was the hero and Alex was a thoroughly unpleasant jerk and rapist. I'm unsure why Brosnan switched them around. Alex's douchebag qualities are divided between Mark and Paul, the latter of whom, in the farthest fall from main character status I can think of, is actually Charlie's very first victim.

They also for some reason insisted on giving Dr. Shelley a Russian accent. Funny. ""Shelley"" doesn't strike me as a Russian surname. Beyond these weird changes the effects are a bit lame, particularly the shark monster animatronic used to represent Charlie's true form. It leaves a lot to be desired.

But the main problem is the darkness. Apart from the brightly-lit main lab, the interior of the Proteus Experiment facilities is very dark and dreary and it's hard to make out what is happening sometimes. A far cry from the brightly-lit white corridors Brosnan describes in the book.

The final major difference of note is that Mr. Lloyd Brinkstone, mentioned often in the novel but never actually appearing, turns up at the end with a squad of armed goons. His name has been changed to ""Leonard Brinkstone"" (what was wrong with Lloyd?) and he's played by a thoroughly wasted Doug Bradley of Hellraiser fame, and gets killed off almost as soon as he's introduced, he and his henchmen merely providing more fodder for Charlie.

As to the ending, as in the novel, the pilot of the Brinkstone copter is revealed to be taken over by Charlie, but the survivors aren't aware of it and the film ends on a dramatic closeup of the pilot/Charlie's eye. Then cut to credits. Since the movie is told in flashback, with Alex talking to his superior officer at the DEA and telling him what happened, we're left to wonder: is Alex aware? I mean, he's telling all this to his boss in the present. It seems they were setting up for a sequel or perhaps a longer ending was cut out, since we never do return to the present to see what Alex's superior thinks of his story...

Despite this, the acting is quite good, especially from Craig Fairbrass as suddenly good guy Alex and minor details aside the plot is pretty much beat for beat an accurate retelling of Slimer. A much better effort than Corman's insultingly terrible Carnosaur.",1341100800,,5782,4.918974358974359

783044,5,6304092350,"This is only the 2nd time I've watched the Special Features on a film and can promise you every single glimpse into the world of animation by the filmmaker, David LeBrun, only makes his achievement more amazing! His passion & dedication to bring to life the discovery of over 4,000 radiolaria by Ernst Haeckel, took him on a journey lasting 22 years, and LeBrun even went so far as to study German as much of Haeckel's work has not been translated into English. There could be no better match to bring Haeckel's work to the greater population than a man with the same insatiable curiousity and integrity of charactr than David LeBrun. Last but not least was the simple, straight- forward explanations of some of the processes which animation requires. He did it in a way anyone can understand and with understated humility for the task he'd appointed himself. Bravo!",1332460800,,866,4.78
783045,4,6304092350,"Despite my extensive studies of mid 19th-century biology, wherein Ernst Haeckel was often mentioned, I knew very little about his life and philosophy. Thus, this 60-minute documentary was revelatory. The film ably presents the religio-philosophical background of natural science at the time and the various discoveries that had begun to challenge and change this perspective. Art, science, technology, and religion weave in and out and merge, making the film unusually multidisciplinary. The use of contemporary illustrations--photographs, watercolors, and etchings--provides a feeling of the novelty and excitement of Haeckel's explorations and discoveries. The radiolaria crystalline skeletons of such great variety, like snowflakes, are fascinating, especially when viewed as a rapid animated series. The later expansion of Haeckel's worldview, grounded in Spinoza and Goethe, is evidenced by his later treatises and landscape paintings from his many world travels. The film was a 20-year project of David Lebrun; his labors in cinematography in an era before electronic graphics, as explained in bonus features, are itself extraordinary, as much a technological divide as an old manual typewriter and 'white-out' versus modern computerized wordprocessing.  A cohesive soundtrack was provided by composer Yuval Ron plus sound effects.  Thus, the film is a worthwhile though esoteric documentary. For a related book, see: ""Exploring the Invisible. Art, science, and the spiritual"" by Lynn Gamwell.",1279929600,,1499,5.935185185185185

Astonishing soundtrack, narrative and picture animation!",1277942400,,368,5.709090909090909
783047,4,6304092350,"I am extremely happy that someone made a film about this scientist. Packed full of information, I was surprised to learn so much about Ernst Haeckel.

What I found bizarre was that the filmmakers didn't celebrate the other half of Haeckel's passion illustrating hundreds of other sea creatures like echinoderms and cnidaria, of which exist a number of stunning visual examples. Many, if not all, are in the public domain. Theres mention of several plates, but this man created GORGEOUS illustrations which didn't get recognized.

I do applaud the filmmakers, but I was a little let down by the film being entirely a graphic-panel animation/documentary. And with the narration done by a single voice, I felt like I was stuck in an academic lecture more than being engaged as an audience member. I was hoping for slow moving, lush visual images accompanied by contemplative music, but some of the animation sequences were quite jarring.

I'm going to watch this again on a flat screen and see if my opinion changes. After watching it on an older CRT-style television set, I may be surprised.",1273622400,,1089,4.939890710382514
783048,5,6304092350,"This movie could only be made because two individuals made it their mission to do the impossible.  First, we have Ernst Haeckel, the zoologist, who became fascinated by the symmetrical structure of single celled organisms and discovered thousands of new species. Then he undertook the Herculean task of drawing all these different types that he viewed under his microscope. Then we have the filmmaker who decided to painstakingly photograph a thousand of these wonderful drawings of nature, turn them into animation cells, and produce a kaleidoscopic visual feast of their nearly infinite variety.

The first task was completed in about a decade...the second task two decades. So the final product is simply astonishing.  Along with the visuals of these extraordinary protozoan structures is a biography of Ernst Haeckel himself and the relationship of his scientific journey to the metaphysical journey of Samuel Taylor Coleridge in his poem of the ""Ancient Mariner.""

Consider this a unique DVD - nothing like it has ever been made and will be made.",1241395200,,1051,5.238095238095238
783049,5,6304092350,"As an avid fan of sequenced graphics used to animate a story-line, this 20 year labor of love tells the tale of the radiolarian discovered(?) and lavishly illustrated (4000 drawings) by Ernst Haeckel. As fantastic as the story is in describing the effect that this single-celled organism had on the world of its time, it is the behind the scenes making-of by the director that reveals a dedicated researcher and phenomenally patient compositor. I started my career in animation & then computer graphics some 20 years ago, and know full well the tedium that single frame animation places on the animator prior to computer aided pieces. Add to that a fabulous and captivating story, plus brilliant displays of this unique and unequaled protozoan, and the viewer will be transported to a time where discoveries opened the minds and hearts of a curious population. A must see.

Please buy this and do not try to download it for free anywhere. The effort that went in to producing this by the solo editor, writer, animator should be aptly rewarded with as much capital as possible.",1222646400,,1076,4.879781420765028
783050,5,6304092350,"Arguably the best Horror/Science Fiction hybrid ever made.  The survivors of a sinking ship find refuge on an abandoned oil rig that appears to have been used for alot more than drilling, with all manner of esoteric scientific equipment on board.  A fine premise to start with, but it's where ""Proteus"" goes from there that takes this well beyond anything I ever expected.  Apparantly a relatively low-budget film, but it certainly doesn't look like it - tremendous production and craftsmanship on every level, with great acting and a truly terrifying creature both in physical and psychological terms.  Directed by ""Hellraiser"" special effects creator Bob Keen, with a small appearance by Doug Bradley, this is every bit as good as the best of the Hellraisers.  Essential for any fan of the ""Pitch Black""/""Riddick"" series, ""Aliens"", ""Species"", the ""Resident Evil""s (the movies or the games), ""Dark City"" or ""The Abyss"".

783051,3,6304092350,"While searching for some new horror and monster movies I came across an interesting little thriller called Proteus.  Reading the back I became suspicious that the movie was based on an old book I had read and the opening credits confirmed it.  Proteus is based on the book SLIMER by Harry Adam Knight.
A band of drug smugglers are fleeing the authorities when their boat sinks.  Eventually their life raft drifts to an offshore drilling rig.  One of them manages to climb aboard and send down the elevator.  The find the rig deserted.  As they look for a way off the rig or a working radio, they seem to find others who lock themselves in a lab.
The true purpose of the rig is not drilling.  It had been converted to an isolated research station.  The goal of the research was to create a protean substance that would aid in regeneration.  They succeeded all too well.  The substance they created was able to absorb the researchers and take their forms.  As the band continues to try and leave before being killed, the owner arrives via helicopter.  This gives them the chance to escape and cause the rig to destruct.  In the closing moments there is doubt as to weather the creature made it aboard the helicopter.
Although this film was enjoyable, it lacked a bit of the suspense and urgency of the novel.  But it is still a better than average member of the sub-genre.  So if you are looking for a good film for munching popcorn to you might want to look for this one.",1088380800,,1470,4.473684210526316

You may first be  in the dark (assuming you didn't read the novel to this movie called  ""Slimer"" first), but eventually clears everything up by the end.  The acting was much better than most of the B-rated horror that appears in  you local video stores.  To end everthing off, this movie didn't seem like  a B-rated horror flick, it just didn't have as many special effects, big  actors, or anything else that would constitute a ""good"" theater  flick according to the creaters.",917827200,,746,4.833333333333333
