7633415,5,B01BGYFTK4,"The documentary, book, and CDs are a must for any fan of Americana music. Or American music in general, really. The Epic Sessions provide a nice connection between past and present, and shows how great songs endure and still connect across generations.",1498780800,2,252,5.023809523809524
7633416,5,B01BGYFTK4,"I loved this documentary, as I have always had an interest in music history. This was very interesting and I'm glad I am able to add it to my viewing library.",1498608000,,158,4.129032258064516
7633417,5,B01BGYFTK4,"When I interviewed legendary record producer ""Uncle"" Art Satherley, I asked Satherley why a boy from Bristol, England would want to come to America in the early 1920s. ""I wanted to find cowboys and Indians,"" he replied. This kind of adventure is what sparked Bernard MacMahon and Allison McGourty, both from the British Isles to come explore the world of folk music in the United States a century after Satherley made his journey. The result is ""American Epic,"" a remarkable three-part documentary exploring facets of American folk music, focusing on specific artists and the families and friends who knew them. Missing are wonkish talking heads, historians, and musicologists. Such heady observations would have drained the humanity from the subject matter, so other than the perfunctory introductions of Robert Redford (the only really weak part of the series), we are fascinated by comments and reminiscences by ordinary people who knew legendary musicians like Mississippi John Hurt, Lydia Mendoza, Cleoma Falcon, and others who made phonograph records in the 1920s and '30s. ""American Epic"" is a heartwarming journey into the marrow of traditional American music, when record executives, not folklorists, but businessmen looking to exploit rural America for profit, ventured out of the cold studios of New York to seek out new talent in the areas where they thrived. Historical commentary is kept at a minimum, except when the historians, like esteemed musicologist Dick Spottswood, were personally involved. It was Spottswood who, based on a clue in Mississippi John Hurt's ""Avalon Blues,"" ""rediscovered"" him by studying an Atlas of the United States and finding out there was indeed a place on Earth called Avalon, Mississippi, and traced Hurt himself, who had been sharecropping and doing odd jobs since he made records for OKeh in 1928 and 1929. The segment on Hurt in Part 3 of the series, is one of the best - we hear his original versions of ""Frankie"" and ""Louis Collins,"" see the only color film made of Hurt, trace his footsteps through the Avalon woods where he had his final stroke, and hear his voice as he talks with an interviewer backstage at the Newport Folk Festival, with the ghostly sounds of Bob Dylan performing ""Mr. Tambourine Man"" in the background off camera. The segments on country music's Carter Family, Mexican songstress Lydia Mendoza, Hawaiian steel guitar pioneer Joseph Kekuku, mystical Delta blues musician Charlie Patton, all have an element of wondrous revelation. ""Rediscovery"" is the one word that best describes the subject matter of ""American Epic."" In whole, it represents the musical melting pot that America produced in the early part of the 20th century, much of which has been forgotten, although its effects, like the ripples in a pond after a stone was thrown into it, remain today. Unlike Ken Burns' mannered, race-driven ""Jazz,"" which distorted music history and did as much harm as good, ""American Epic"" has no such pre-determined political angle. Its colorblind, politically ambivalent examination of American music is as masterful a study of this particular small slice of recording history as one will encounter.",1498262400,4,3169,5.203522504892368
7633418,5,B01BGYFTK4,"As one who was once an amateur recording engineer decades ago (but with magnetic tape), I thoroughly enjoyed this look at an even older recording technology with ""acetate"" disks (that said, I think I still have a couple of ""Audiodisc"" ""acetate"", actually lacquer, blanks somewhere I bought back in the early 60's :-).  The weight driven recording lathe was fascinating to watch.

And I find the songs they recorded for this program very enjoyable to listen to as well.",1498176000,2,468,4.9113924050632916

7633420,4,B01BGYFTK4,"American Epic, a 2-disc documentary series, grants viewers a window into the recording industry of the 1920s. During this time, the voices and sounds of the American people were first heard through songs played on phonograph records. These musical compositions ranged from mountain folk music to gospel songs. With this series, viewers connect with artists of the 1920s through secondhand accounts, while also learning about struggles many artists endured, such as poverty and segregation. This series is a resource for anyone interested in American music of the 20th century.  American Epic is an introduction to the music of artists who paved the way and shaped modern music. American Epic Sessions (disc 2) is composed of performances by musicians using equipment from the 1920s. In fact, this series is suitable for children from ages 12 to 18. I highly recommend this series and give it 4 out of 5 stars. Reviewed by Geanice Gee, KIDS FIRST! Reviewer. For more film reviews, visit kidsfirst dot org.",1497571200,2,1004,5.121951219512195
7633421,5,B01BGYFTK4,"Recently viewed this mini-series on PBS (actually, via the PBS app on my Amazon Fire TV) and found it a superb recollection of the early American electric recording scene. The amount and quality of the research needed to pull this together is remarkable, as is the production quality. As much for the music extracts, as well as the feelings conveyed, I knew this is something I will want to reference, view and enjoy repeatedly.

The final ""episode"", consisting of a series of today's musicians in actual recording sessions using the restored equipment, is priceless.",1497398400,7,567,5.031914893617022
7633422,5,B01BGYFTK4,"I watched the PBS showing, and it was great.  Disc 2, with the sessions with current performers.....a-fing mazing.  Moving.  If you don't grin and get chills and wish all music were still as real as this......  If music, real music, historic music, is meaningful to you, buy this, and the cd, and the record.  The artists and producers deserve Grammy awards all around, and all our thanks.",1497312000,12,389,4.746268656716418
7633423,5,B01BGYFTK4,"From producer/artisis T-Bone Burnett and Jack White (and, I guess, Robert Redford) this documentary has musical artists like Alabama Shakes, Willie Nelson and Merle Haggard, Los Lobos, Elton John, Taj Mahal and Steve Martin and Edie Brickell  recording on gloriously antique recording equipment straight to the cutting machine. The repertoire is music of the era of the antique equipment, blues, bluegrass, country all performed with dedicated sympathy. I think this is a masterful concept and production.",1496793600,7,505,5.644736842105263

8750083,4,B01BGYFTK4,"THE FOOTAGE AND INTERVIEWS INCLUDED,  ARE EXCELLENT..... MY MAIN FRUSTRATION WITH THE SERIES IS THAT THERE ARE NEVER ANY COMPLETE PIECES WITHOUT ANY NARRATOR DIALOGUE OVER THEM...... THE SOLUTION TO THIS WOULD BE TO HAVE INCLUDED THE COMPLETE PIECES AS SUPPLEMENTS...... IT IS A CREDIT TO THE PRODUCERS THAT INSTEAD OF BEING SPREAD OUT BY TRYING TO COVER TOO MANY MUSICIANS INSTEAD THEY CHOSE TO FOCUS ON A SMALLER NUMBER FOR EACH EPISODE... THE SECOND DISC OF PERFORMANCES RECORDED ON VINTAGE EQUIPMENT IS INTERESTING AS A CONCEPT BUT I AM UNDERWHELMED BY THE CHOICE OF PEOPLE CHOSEN......... WHY DID THEY NOT APPROACH PETER GREEN, ERIC CLAPTON, MICK JAGGER, KEITH RICHARDS, MICHELLE SHOCKED, BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN, ETC......IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THERE ARE A LOT OF GOOD OLD BOYS, GOOD OLD GIRLS POLITICS INVOLVED IN THE CHOICES THAT WERE MADE........ OR BETTER YET, IN THE SPIRIT OF THE ERA WHICH THE EPISODES COVERED, SEND PEOPLE OUT IN SEARCH OF UNKNOWN TALENT IN SIMILAR GENRES AND RECORD THEM........",1529539200,,1000,5.0606060606060606
