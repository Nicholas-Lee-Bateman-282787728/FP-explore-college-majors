If you flipped the DVD over in your player and watched the Non DVD side you will get more entertainment out of it. Whoever directed this movie and produced it should never be allowed in a movie studio again. The movie starts out as a group of people who enter a cave to explore it. It is filmed with the now famous ""Blair Witch"" shaking camera effect throughout the movie. The cave explorers are taken out one by one from what appears to be a creature that is stalking them. THey end up baiting a trap where the creature must have been shot about 50 times but doesn't die. At the end of the movie the creature turns out to be a human being in a loin cloth with a animal skull head used as a helmet. Explain to me how someone could have been shot that many times at close range and not die when the only protection they have is a loin cloth.

Filmed in ""realistic"" darkness, the viewer has little knowledge of what's going on and the script is so ambiguous, it just doesn't make any sense.  A group of friends go into a new uncharted cave somewhere in Russia and encounter a deadly something or other that starts killing them off.  Being a horror fan, I had expected some kind of mutant bug or creature, but the discovery of just what's killing our crew is nothing short of preposterous.

2567081,1,B000FIHN9S,"Actually, seeing this film is the spoiler. It is about a group of young men and women who explore a cave in an uncharted region of Kazakhstan.

The group becomes trapped and each member is, predictably, eliminated one by one. In the last 5 minutes or so, after everyone but the 2 women are killed, we learn that the 'beast' that has been stalking the crew is actually a man who, orphaned as a young boy in a small plane crash nearby, has been living in the caves as some sort of modern day neanderthal.  It would seem his interest in the women is not culinary.

The story has potential, however the cinematography is abysmal. Visually, it's hard to follow thanks to overzealous use of hypershake, dust, fog, upside down and sideways shots,  flashlight closeups and complete blackouts.

Overall, I have to concur with the others here. This film was jarring on the nerves and pointless until the last few seconds.  By then it was too little too late. Out of a possible score of 1-5, I give this film a -10.",1154131200,7,1004,4.489010989010989

I spent the entire movie thinking, hmm, a lot of people got paid for this, there must be some redeeming feature.

Alas, No. It starts dreadfully and plunges headlong into an abyss of talentless groping about in the dark and never sees the light of day.

2567083,1,B000FIHN9S,"DON'T see this movie.  It is, by far the worst piece of junk I have ever viewed.  It starts off fair and goes down hill from there.  The photography is awful and it is very hard to to even see what goes on, especially with their new ""hypershake"" technique which ruins many of the shots.  They use fog in many shots which obsures what is happening.  Then there is the ever-present dust being raised in every shot which further obscures what is happening and also the headlights which shine into the camera ALL THE TIME.  I got a headache from trying to watch through it.

Who ever did the photography knew nothing of shadow detail. The shadows had NO DETAIL, but rather turned purple so you either saw things with light on them or purple.

While the story is a little plausible, many things that happen are not.  Take the movement of a massive boulder by the guy that appears at the end.  Then there is the scene in the water where the attacker is shot and is lying in the water, only to raise up and stab one of the folks, then proceeds merrily on his way.

And then there is the ending which makes no sense whatsoever and we as viewers are given 15 seconds to put it all together based on about three scenes.

This one was evidently a movie with a less-than-zero budget and should be avoided at all costs.  I am tempted to ask for my money back.",1153699200,20,1346,4.2727272727272725

This movie is dimly lit and the camera goes upside down and sideways for no reason throughout. The ending is perhaps one of the worst I have ever seen unless of course you enjoy a gratuitous and completely unnecessary rape scene to wrap up your crappy film.

If you're dumb enough to view this film, make sure you watch the special ""making of"" footage. It's better than the film. You get to see an actual car on fire and everything.

They explain to you how they ruined the movie by using fog in every shot and inventing a new and irritating camera technique called ""hypershake"" - it will make you not want to watch any further, especially in the scene where one idiot is drilling into a wall with a normal size power drill and they use ""hypershake"" to make the whole room quiver for two minutes.

The making of section also covers the director's daughter building a foam cave and repeatedly tells you what sort of HD cameras were used to produce this masterpiece. They managed to use an irritating effect in the making of mini-film too - they use a technique called hyperfastforward to cut from scene to scene.

The first five or so minutes of the movie were not too bad but it went quickly downhill (or underground) after that.

Terrible cinematography.  The shots outside the cave were varying shades of putrid color; the balance of the movie inside the cave were basically lit (sometimes) with a flashlight.

First of all, please don't confuse this movie with ""The Cave""--Academy-Awards-level work in comparison.

Second, in case you think the other reviewers are exaggerating, even a little bit--they're not. This one is that bad. From the fragmented plot to the worst camera work I've ever witnessed to the (admittedly comprehensible) but terrible ending, this movie repeatedly begs the question, ""What were they thinking?!"" Was there not even one sane person along for this ride? I'd never consider strapping a camera to a hyperactive dog a filming ""technique,"" but apparently it is--and an overused one here. I only wonder if abuse charges might not be brought up in the dog's case, and wish they could be lodged on the human's behalves--myself included.

2567110,1,B000FIHN9S,"This movie is terrible. I mean, I'll go in detail (more or less) but that's all you'll truly need to know, it's terrible. First off, it's about 8 people that go into a cave. While in the cave laughing, suddenly one of the people vanish. The other 7 look for him and well, he's dead. They try to bring him out of the cave, but the only guy that could've helped them all out has half his body thrown into the cave, and then a boulder seals them in. Now, at this point I have no faith that any of them will make it out, and soon enough, they start getting killed left and right as they merely look for a way out. They try shooting the dang thing, but because it's mysterious and almost always a freakin blur when it comes into frame because the camera can't stop shaking, it of course survives for no good reason and kills more of them. Then there's some stupid dilema dealing with one of the characters and whether or not he can be trusted since he did let his wife drown. Well, why the heck are you hanging out with someone like that? For the sake of all that is holy, only curses could even express my intense anger and distaste for this film but I think Amazon would take this review down and more people will give this a rating of 3 or higher. This film shouldn't even get a freakin 1 star, but Amazon luckily gives every product a star, if only 1. Eventually only the 2 girls are left, and they're almost to freedom when this mysterious monster thing captures them. Tragic...when will the movie end? The 2 girls wake up, they're naked only being covered by some random fur covering that magically covered them. They look around, find some pictures and eventually find out that the big bad monsterous killer of this whole movie is just some guy with a weird costume that tends to roast dead bodies over a campfire. Hmm...that must explain why he's bulletproof, because he's...uh...he...uh...he has facial burnings! Yeah sure, let's go with that, I mean it's not like he even gets freakin dialouge. Soon enough 1 of the girls freaks out just like she's been doing in this entire movie, and gets stabbed by the killer like everyone else, and the other girl gets raped by the killer...what reason? None, I mean what other reason is there a grown man living in a cave? There's a flashback to when he's a kid and got stranded and they find plane wings so even though they don't tell you, I guess he was stranded in a plane crash, and rapes a girl and kills all her friends. The end. Yah! Wasn't that fun? Isn't this the movie film and cinema itself was made for? I mean sure, I have a heck of a lot of brain cells that commited suicide during the movie because of lack of story, or proper camera work (shakey, shakey...for like 45% of the dang flick), but besides that, it has to be the WORST FILM I'VE EVER SEEN IN MY ENTIRE LIFE!!! Don't make the same mistake I did, just stay away from it, don't pay money for it, don't even acknowledge it's existence. All I know are 2 things; 1, that's an hour I'll never get back, and 2, I wish I could throw Olatunde Osunsanmi down one of those caves because I think that this movie is truly such an abomination, it should be trialed as a crime.

2567112,1,B000FIHN9S,"The Cavern (Within) : 2 out of 10: Blair Witch meets The Cave and gives me a headache.

I have something to ask all film schools, could you please teach future directors how to hold a camera steady. Flailing the camera around like Aunt Betty with 12 drinks is headache inducing.

In addition, film is primarily a visual medium directors may want to point their camera's in the general direction of the action. Film also requires light to work. Perhaps a light source should be employed so one can see the action on the screen. I know it is a cave movie but there is absolutely nothing frightening about watching pitch blackness for minutes at a time.

For that matter showing the film upside down doesn't indicate confusion on screen it indicates confusion in the editing booth.

A last note to the director I am sure there was a good reason to have a horribly fake CGI campfire. I honestly, for the life of me, cannot think of one.

Now on to the screenwriter, could you try to make at least one character likable? I would prefer two or more but one decent person I can root for or care about might help. In addition, if you are going to have flashbacks make them relevant to the story.

If you are going to have a surprise ending it is probably best if it doesn't contradict every single thing that comes before it. In addition, try adding some fancy spelunking terms to a cave movie. You might have wanted to start with spelunking.

2567139,3,B000FIHN9S,"The Cavern (Olatunde Osunsami, 2006)

Olatunde Osunsami's low-budget thriller The Cavern could have been-- well, not a great movie, really, but at least a very good one. It starts out well enough. Like The Descent, the British trapped-in-a-cave-with-something-nasty film released around the same time, The Cavern is about a bunch of cavers who are, well, trapped in a cave with something nasty. Unlike The Descent, which for all that it was one of the best movies I saw last year was gimmicky and full of shortcuts, The Cavern actually tries to go the distance. It's a first film, and has some of the hallmarks of a first film, but at least Osunsami makes the effort, and he comes pretty close to pulling it off.

The cavers in The Cavern are a coed bunch, unlike the all-female caving troupe of The Descent, but sex isn't really as much of an issue as one might think; we spend the opening scenes of the movie setting up the various alliances and tensions between the group. Five of them-- Bailey (The Passion of Ayn Rand beauty Sybil Temchen), Gannon (Mustafa Shakir, recently of Marci X), Domingo (TV character actor Andres Saenz-Hudson), Miranda (Urban Playground's Ogy Durham), and Ori (American Gun's Andrew Caple-Shaw)-- are part of a team who have caved together for a number of years, making their living from exploring and photographing new caves and reporting back to the world on what they find there. Also involved in this trip are two Kazakh natives, Vlad (Kamen Gabirel in his big-screen debut) and Slava (Neno Pervan, briefly seen in The Hunted), who they band have hired as guides, and Ambrose (Danny Jacobs, recently of Miriam), who's writing a book on caving and is with them for research. It can also be said that there's a ghost with the group-- that of Rachel (Cassandra Duarden, in her big-screen debut), a member of the team who died on an expedition in Peru two years previous, and whose story is told in flashback as the movie goes on. The setting up of the characters is accomplished with the same sort of lunkheaded deftness that we get in The Descent, though again, Osunsami's characters don't have the sort of slick two-dimensionality that some of those in The Descent did. He doesn't always succeed, but he's trying to create rich, detailed characters with depth and complexity. The film is shot in the foot here mostly by its abbreviated running time of eighty-one minutes; there was a lot more that could have been dome with some of these characters, especially Domingo and the author, but it's enough to know, at least, they're not stereotypes.

Then we actually get into the cave, and here I have to give The Descent the props. Osunsami takes few chances with his footage here, and when he does, it has more to do with Blair-Witch-Project-esque first-person-cam fiddling than it does with trying to make the viewer claustrophobic (something the first half of The Descent does with chilling effectiveness). Part of the problem is the constant thought in the back of the viewer's head that if anyone's carrying a video camera, they wouldn't be in the places from which we're seeing camera shots, but that's less minor than Osunsami not taking full advantage of the fact that he and his actors are sitting in a cave. There's one tight-shot scene, but there's never much of a feeling that anyone's in any danger from the environment itself.

The something-nasty angle, though, heaps points on The Cavern like nobody's business-- for the first hour of the movie. If it had ended at sixty-one minutes, I'd be hailing it as one of the best monster movies we've seen in at least the past two decades. Osunsami handles this perfectly. We never see the monster. The cavers see the monster every now and then, but only see enough to get a grip on what it is once-- and the camera work here is deft enough so that you an get the cavers' reaction to the beast while only seeing the barest hint of it. I'm probably overreaching and/or forgetting a few movies here, but I was thinking while I was watching it that I hadn't seen the monster in a monster movie handled that well since Cat People (Tourneur's, not Schrader's).

Ah, but this is the age of Trading Spaces and Extreme Makeover: Home Edition. How can  you possibly make a movie that doesn't have a big reveal? Sixty-one minutes in, after the climactic scene, the screen goes black, you're ready to rejoice... and there's another scene, and you just know that Osunsami's about to blow it. We're going to see the

monster, which has zero chance of living up to the build-up, and it'll end up being 2006's great cinematic disappointment. (Well, unless you actually expected a good Adam Sandler movie.) But here is the biggest surprise The Cavern has waiting for you-- while the expected disappointment does, of course, surface, if you look at all the variables here, all the many, many ways this could have gone even more horribly wrong than it does, it will eventually occur to you that if Osunsami had to give us the last twenty minutes of this movie, he did it in, roughly, the best way he could have. Obviously, it's impossible to discuss this in detail without major spoilers, so I'll just have to say that while it doesn't work as well as simply not including the final scene would have, it works as well as possible given the existence of the final scene.

A very pleasant surprise, albeit one that should have been twenty minutes shorter. *** ",1169683200,7,5428,4.7233368532206965

I gave it one star for originality... kind of. I would wait until this comes on an off channel on television and there's absolutely nothing else on to watch. Don't waste your money even renting it.",1160870400,2,542,4.346534653465347
2567157,2,B000FIHN9S,"Well, I'll say one thing for The Cavern (aka Within).  It certainly keeps you guessing - guessing what is going on (since you can't see anything most of the time) and guessing what this or that character just said.  Now I know it can't be easy lighting scenes that take place far below the surface of the earth, but throw us a bone here; you have to extinguish every light in your house to have any hope of seeing anything at all here.  And if the lighting's not bad enough, you're often stuck with POV shots pointing at nothing in particular and shaking all over the place - an effect which is multiplied during the film's more intense moments.  The filmmakers call it the hypershake, as if they invented some groovy new film technique; to me, it just looks like the cameraman was drunk out of his mind.  Did I mention how these big moments are punctuated by a veritable orgy of flashing lights?  Brilliant, eh?  Hey, just to make all those pitch dark scenes even harder to make out, let's take the opportunity to bombard the viewer's eyes with bright flashing lights every so often!

As far as the story goes, you have eight explorers setting out to explore an uncharted cave in remote Kazakhstan (this is apparently what these people do with their lives, although I'm hard pressed to say how they support themselves).  Except for an annoying little man writing a book on the subject, they're all experienced spelunkers with something of a history together.  You see, there was a tragedy a couple of years earlier - and there's nothing like some good old we're-trapped-miles-below-the-surface panic to bring buried personal issues boiling up to the surface.  This exploration is hardly begun before one dude gets himself disemboweled and the others quickly find themselves intentionally trapped by someone or something.  From this point on, it's a desperate effort to find another way out before they all fall victim to whatever monster is definitely in there with them.  They walk a while, pause to argue among themselves, and then wait for the monster to kill one of them so that they can get moving again - over and over.  It's really annoying to see these characters argue amongst themselves over what happened two years earlier, especially since it takes valuable time away from that whole running for their lives thing.  Speaking of annoying, the ending is guaranteed to inspire a few choice words from anyone who suffers through it.  It is, in a word, stupid.  I wanted to slap this movie when the end credits started rolling.

This is a low-budget film, so I suppose I should cut it a little slack.  The cave system (or at least what little I could see of it) did not look like a fake set, the acting was pretty good for the most part, and the gore is nicely done.  I also detect the influence of The Blair Witch Project in the overall presentation - I don't think it necessarily works here, but it wasn't a bad idea in and of itself.  It's hardly worth talking about the filmmakers' approach to the story, though, as the movie is all but doomed by the terrible lighting of the whole underground experience (did I mention that, on a couple of occasions, the screen went completely black for an extended period of time, while the characters screamed in the background?).  I'm not saying I would have liked this film if I had actually been able to see what was going on, but I guess we'll never know.",1159747200,2,3408,4.6262458471760795
2567158,1,B000FIHN9S,"Probably the worst movie I have ever watched.  I could tell from the opening music it would be low budget but this was beyond awful - just full of gratuitous violence, no plotline, terrible sets and camera work you wouldn't even believe.  At several points the screen goes completely black.  it is just awful - run away from this as fast as you can!",1159747200,3,349,4.421875

The Cavern is fine, its not a masterpiece, but its a decent and simple independent suspense film.  I guess the 99% of the reviews here, giving it 1/5 stars, really helped lower my expectations for this movie.

Its worth a watch.  Its a good film, as long as you're not one of those people who need to be super-analytical over low-budget movies.",1158796800,3,463,4.476190476190476
2567160,1,B000FIHN9S,"...have to watch this ""film"" again.  Sure, the notions of claustrophobia and super-natural ""beings"" who take pleasure in stalking & consuming human flesh, combine to make interesting, or at least, entertaining movies.  Not so in this wanna-be-travesty.  I would rather have been the actress getting raped in the last scene (for what purpose is beyond mortal comprehension!), than have anyone I even remotely care about waste 81 minutes of their life, as I did, watching this...this...thing.  Do not pass go.  Do not waste your well-earned $0.02 on this rental, and may Allah have mercy upon your soul if you purchase this blasphemous bag of tripe.  It's not even worth the bar-coded sticker Hollywood Video was forced at gun-point to attach to it so unfortunate, naieve people like me could actually rent it.

2567161,1,B000FIHN9S,"I actually thought the movie wasn't bad because I thought the monster in the few scenes where you could actually see it was pretty freaky and well done.  And the supernatural undertones were creepy at first.  Fast forward to the end....

The creature ends up to be human, then proceeds to brutally rape the last survivor, right into the end credits. Just another snotnosed punk director using ""creative license"" to throw a classless and unnecessary scene in. He explained in the comments mode that he just wanted to show everyone that the guy 'thought' about becoming human again, then just so he could drive it home that he was a monster, made him do the most monstrous act you could do.  This was about the same as the jerk that created the 'super columbine massacre' computer game because he thought it would drive debate about the role of video games in society.

I think the special effect budjet was so low that they decided to just shake the hell out of the camera instead.

Plot is weak, and the end is seriously lame.

Lastly, the acting was okay, but the poor script gave the audience textbook characters that lacked any real depth.

Even watching this movie for free would be too much of a price.",1351555200,,421,4.739726027397261
