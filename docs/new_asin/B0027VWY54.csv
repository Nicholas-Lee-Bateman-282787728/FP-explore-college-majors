8355236,5,B0027VWY54,"Absolutely fantastic double for incurable romantics. Saw Cyborg She on an international flight and have watched it another 6 times since. Makes a grown man cry. Only other movie to do that so early was Rebecca (right from the first scene). The other is different but great in its own way. PS If you are a hopeless romantic like me beg, borrow or steal the Korean movie "" Il Mare"", settle down with your coffee on a rainy day and have a box of tissues handy and enjoy!!",1520812800,,468,4.329545454545454
8355237,5,B0027VWY54,i love the Sassy Girl which is a stupid funky movie.  but Cyborg She is just a stupid movie.,1449014400,,92,3.8421052631578947
8355238,5,B0027VWY54,"Cyborg: my intellectual friends look down on the over-the-top pure teenage-boy fantasy unobtainable girl story, and then try to keep from laughing, which they can't. My computer-scientist friends pooh-pooh the logic and then try to keep from laughing, which they can't. Pure schmaltz in the goofy adolescent Japanese tradition (captured by a Korean director!), but so outrageously done that its all pure style. My kids love it.

Sassy: This time Kwak Jae Yong captures the style-essence of Korean hapless boy / tough-girl with the soft heart schmaltz -- and this one is REALLY funny.  She's so mean to him! You have to love the characters. The actress is great.

Don't worry about the language. Subtitles work great (even with ""m"" translated as ""n"" so often!).",1387065600,,760,5.064
8355239,5,B0027VWY54,Two-in-one which includes Japanese movie 'Cyborg She' (very good!) and Korean movie 'My Sassy Girl' (the reason I originally purchased this combo) which is hilarious and fun to watch.,1342656000,,183,5.344827586206897
8355240,1,B0027VWY54,"First both movies were good. My Sassy Girl is a 5 and Cyborg/She is a 4.

Important part...DO NOT BUY THIS VERSION.
Both movies are extremely compressed. A normal movie is about 6-7 gig in size. These movies are 1.5 gig in size. That is about 20% the normal data. The movie runs about 8 frames a second and the video is fuzzy in the best lite scenes and very blocky and jerky in dark scenes. I contacted the seller and have received no info if the is a REAL copy or a counterfeit copy. The seller stated he would contact distributor but I have received no reply.
It is listed as 1 disk for both movies however I assumed, incorrectly, that it would be a 2 sided disk.

Buy the real versions of the movies if you are watching them on a HDTV. If you like watching them on your phone you may not notice.",1319846400,8,799,4.115384615384615
8355241,5,B0027VWY54,"Two of my favorite movies crammed into a single box. These two movies will change your perception of cinema forever. :)

I first saw Cyborg She on an international plane trip between Madrid and the US. This movie not only drew my attention but engaged me more than most films I have seen. I actually cared about the characters and was thoroughly entertained with the story line.

I first saw my Sassy Girl with my girlfriend and this movie made me laugh and made me cry.

Both of these stories are well written and fun to watch multiple times.",1311552000,,543,4.4646464646464645
8355242,5,B0027VWY54,Both of the films were really great I would recommend to anyone who enjoys watching romance/comedy foreign films. I will say that both films are in the original languages with english subtitles in case you are looking for one with english dubbing or something. For me I enjoy watching in the original language so that wasn't a problem. Overall a great purchase!! :),1298073600,,365,4.809523809523809
8355243,5,B0027VWY54,"Both of these movies are great! ""Cyborg She"" is really very sentimental and touching and for a guy to say that about a movie, it must be good. My only complaint about it was the ending. It made you want to find the director and just shake him and ask him ""What's wrong with you?!"". But, it really is worth the money and it really is worth having in your collection.
The other thing about it was if you're really a sci-fi and anime fan you'll see that a lot of homage was paid to a lot of subjects.
My Sassy Girl was sort of the same but, it's not Sci-Fi. It's really good though.
You'd love to eventually find a girl like her under all that hurt she was so lovable.",1276560000,4,665,4.045454545454546
