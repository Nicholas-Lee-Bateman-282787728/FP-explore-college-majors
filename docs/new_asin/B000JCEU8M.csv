The COMBAT 100 MOVIE PACK has been discontinued by its manufacturer, MILL CREEK ENTERTAINMENT. This mammoth package combines their GREAT WWII CAMPAIGNS and WAR CLASSICS 50 movie packs. (For movie details on ""WAR CLASSICS"" see that product's main AMAZON page.)

The GREAT WWII CAMPAIGNS half of this set just may be the best part of it. Divided into two sections (""War In Europe"" and ""War In The Pacific""), the documentary footage is drawn from many sources:  U.S. Army, Navy and Coast Guard, the British War Office, the National Film Board of Canada and captured Nazi materials. The 50 titles here cover every aspect of the war. For any history buff this collection alone makes the set well-worth having.

(Note that the 3 star rating was derived by researching the movie half of COMBAT, and obtaining an average viewer score (on a 1 to 10 scale) as quoted at a film-related website. These feature films were rated 6.5.)",1174867200,4,945,4.850931677018633
