8089619,4,B000BNYDXG,"The cinematography is well thought out and visceral, focusing more on the human connection between the characters. The sound effects offer a eerie sense of unease that is chilling. The characters are well rounded and tenable. The story of Silent Cry is a somber, disturbing tale of conspiracy, exploitation and corruption that manages to make the viewer feel the helplessness and despair of the main character, Rachel Stewart. It is also a story that is ripped from modern times and haunts the alleyways and doorsteps of urban legend-the stolen child from the hospital nursery.

 Silent Cry is a true, thrilling film that should appeal to anyone longing for mature crime noir storytelling. It is well shot, well acted and maintains a strong continuity from start to finish. The over-all effect of the film is a more subdued suspenseful tale that is just as horrifying as any. This was a film that I had not seen before and I am glad to have seen. I thoroughly enjoyed this film and found it to be a true modern classic.",1432512000,,1019,4.751412429378531
8089620,1,B000BNYDXG,"I cannot yet review the content of this movie...because the disc I received as a gift WAS BLANK. *goggle* I've gotten discs before that were defective in some way...but completely blank? (There were no striations or marks on the discs to show it had ever been burned with a laser--smooth as a mirror. And once it was put into the DVD player, it whirred around and did nothing before automatically being ejected--or maybe I should say REjected), same for the computer's DVD player) The DVD is being returned for a replacement; I will update the review at that point. However, I did want other potential buyers to know that this is a possibility. I'm not sure how reliable the production company for this DVD is, since the release date was August 20th (our DVD of Silent Cry had been pre-ordered) and we were given a ship date of October 2nd. The disc arrived on Oct 9th. If it was released Aug 20th, why weren't pre-orders available to Amazon for shipping on Aug 20th?",1381363200,,967,4.595375722543353
8089621,4,B000BNYDXG,"""Silent Cry"" is a twenty-first century thriller with roots in the British tradition of ""kitchen sink"" social realism. The main character is Rachel Stewart, a single mother who is told that her baby has died only a few hours after she gave birth to him. Her suspicions are aroused, however, by the behaviour of the doctors involved and their reluctance to let her see the body. Suspecting that her baby may have been kidnapped, she attempts to uncover the truth with the help of Daniel Stone, a sympathetic hospital porter. Their investigations lead them into danger when they discover that a ruthless gang have been abducting babies for adoption by childless couples. They are, however, unable to inform the police as the leader of the gang is himself a police officer.

In their heyday in the fifties and sixties, British kitchen sink films mostly dealt with working-class life. ""Silent Cry"" deals not so much with the traditional working class as with the modern underclass of drug addicts, prostitutes and petty criminals. Apart from the villains, who are largely middle-class Establishment figures such as doctors and policemen, about the only character who has a job is Daniel, and even he is a reformed ex-convict recently released from jail. I was reminded of ""Dirty Pretty Things"", another British social-realist thriller from 2002 which also had a hospital setting and which dealt with London's underclass and with a sinister conspiracy among members of the medical profession. (One difference, however, is that ""Dirty Pretty Things"" dealt mostly with members of various immigrant communities, whereas in ""Silent Cry"" nearly all the characters are white British).

Besides its links with the British social realist tradition, the film also has some similarities with American neo-noir crime dramas such as ""L.A. Confidential"". Films of this type attempt to capture something of the spirit of the films noirs of the forties and fifties, and often have complex plots involving widespread corruption and wrongdoing, particularly by those in positions of authority. There was, however, always more to film noir than a crime-related theme and a complicated storyline; atmosphere was equally important, and neo-noir directors are often able to give their films an atmospheric look equivalent to the moody black-and-white photography of classic noir. Director Julian Richards achieves that here with a bleak, faded look appropriate to the film's grim subject matter and to the stark, bare hospital corridors, shabby, dilapidated flats and urban wastelands against which it is shot.

The acting is good, especially from Emily Woof as the vulnerable but determined heroine and from Clive Russell as the menacing villain Dennis Betts. I would not rate the film quite as highly as ""Dirty Pretty Things"", which I felt had a greater insight into social issues, but ""Silent Cry"" is a gripping, well-made thriller which holds the attention and does not (unlike many recent American thrillers) waste time on unconvincing or unnecessary plot twists. 7/10",1372464000,,3046,5.276288659793814
8089622,5,B000BNYDXG,It is so crazy that medical staff would lie about the death of your child. A mother knows when something is wrong with her child and this mother refused to believe her child was dead. She proved herself right. Great movie and the ending was a tear maker.,1360800000,,254,4.3125
8089623,5,B000BNYDXG,"A day after she held her newborn in her arms, still in the hospital, the doctor informs Rachel that the baby has died. Broken and incredulous, Rachel returns to the hospital, finds a comrade among the hospital staff, and together they go out into the darkercorners of London on a journey in which they discover not a few disturbing secrets. Alongside the twisting plot and the talented ensemble of actors, the camera plays a lead role in the way in which it colors the hospital corridors, the rainy streets of London and the gutters populated by prostitutes and homeless people. The result is a finely wrought thriller, directed with impressive emotional restraint.",1198108800,,665,4.946428571428571
