8067241,5,B0009UV7H6,"I love this series and now own all 9 seasons which gives the view the complete story. The box art is beautifully done by Alex Ross. Be aware that this series is from the 1970's and the actual animation is done in that era and it has perfect English dub. The best part about this particular series is that its from the Japanese version which means its content wasn't edited for America so it dose include death scenes etc. If you purchase ""G-Force"" which is the Americanized version of Gatchaman you will lose some great scene that add to the story.",1366934400,,548,4.435643564356436

Item arrived exactly as described packed very well. Just what I had hoped for. Would definitely recommend to a friend",1342915200,,156,5.038461538461538
8067243,3,B0009UV7H6,"The Episodes in the ""Teens"" are probably the fall down part of the Gatchaman series, The episodes on Collection 2 are not as fun and exciting as Collection 1. For me it's because there's really no fighting action just God Phoenix VS Galactor Mecha. I rather see them infiltrate Galactor bases and beat the crap outta the bad guys. Still, there are quite a few highlight episodes but they are HEAVILY surrounded by boring episodes.

Highlight Episodes

-The Fearsome Icekander

-Speed Race Through Hell

-Who Is Sosai X?

-The Great Insect Operation

-The Neon Giant Who Laughs At The Dark

If you're a BIG fan of BOTP and G-Force I recommend this for the nostalgia. I'm 100% sure that Collection 3 has alot of more fun and exciting episodes so be sure to pick that up after you get done watching Collection 2!",1130630400,,809,4.615384615384615
8067244,4,B0009UV7H6,"As mentioned, Vols 3&4 contain entirely episodic shows, with little to now exploration of the characters or the the 105 episode spanning plot.  While I agree that taken by the each these episodes are nothing to write home about (I'd give them two to three stars), I'm giving the box set four stars because of classic source material, the fantastic restoration, and the truckloads of extras (althouth I still haven't gotten around to seeing all of the extras yet!).  Also, the dubs are quite useful--I feel very strongly that you'll get much more enjoyment out of watching the series in the original Japanese--it just hits harder and the acting is so good, that you forget how campy it can taken.  Still, I applaud ADR for the faithful dubs, the actors take their jobs seriously, and once I've seen the episode in Japanese it's great to have it play in English so the viewer doesn't have to concentrate as hard (maybe you can get some work done while you watch?).  Also, it's interesting to see the different dialogue, and the dub-actors takes on the characters.

Watch these largely throw-away episodes, many of which don't even show the series main villian Berg Katse and certainly don't flesh him out, and then contrast it with the later volumes to see how much better the story gets (the animation and monsters/mecha are *still* superb)--also, watch as the writers take the sometimes ridiculous material from these earlier episodes (the ""who is the Red Impulse"" stuff, Galacactor's foil to the Ninja Team--the Blackbirds!,  and ESPECIALLY Joe's insane ""doggy injury"" and turn them into dramatic plot points or weave them into intricate story lines that keep you glued to the screen and guessing episode after episode.

Some of the extras are obviously ""filler"", but with so much to choose from I certainly don't want to discourage ADV--The (noted comic artist) Alex Ross material, artwork and especially the interview are fascinating, the original Japanese material (a video-still, translated version of the original Japanese comic) and sketches are enthralling and show what a phenominal success this show was back in the early 70's, and how it still holds up today.  The English dub actors/producers commentary is good,

Volume 4 is certainly the more relevant of the two disks, with the first appearance of Sosai X, Joe's display of obsession regarding Berg Katse, the biggest glimpse of who the Red Impulse is and why he helps the Science Ninja Team, and Joe's injury which plays a MAJOR part in the story much later, especially episodes 98-105; the best episodes of ANY animated series.

Included on this DVD are the eps:

Vol 3;

The Mysterious Red Sand

The Fearsome Ice-Kander

The Fearsome Jellyfish Lens

The Indestructible Machine Mechanika

Revenge! The Whale Operation

-Extras include  Clean closing animation, Commentary with Luci Christian (the english dub Jinpei) and Charles Campbell (ADR director), Gatchaman Karaoke, and ADV previews.

Vol 4;

Hell's Speed Race  (a Great Joe/Katse show--Katse almost unmasked!)

A Critical Moment for Science Ninja Team

Who is Governer X? (obviously, a good Sosai X show)

Firebird vs. Fire Eating Dragon  (A good Red Impulse Show)

Giant Raging Mecha Ball

A Neon Giant Who Laughs at the Dark

Buy it because you'll enjoy it.  Buy to support ADV's efforts.  Buy it so you'll know what's going on in the next volumes when things start getting REALLY good!!!

PS:  Vols 5&6, which are scheduled to be released in October, should contain the following stand-out episodes:

#29 ""Gallack X, Demon Man"": First appearance of the female general--she'll be very important later.

#32-33 ""Grand Operation Gezora"": The female general shows up with a plan to kidnap members of Gatchaman--who is the female general??  Hmm, time will tell...

#27 ""Gallactor's Witch Racer"": One of the first of many love affairs Joe has with a woman on the wrong side of right and wrong.

#31 ""Plan to Assassinate Dr. Nambu"": Joe get's into a rumble with a Gallactor Devil Star Assassin on the road (basically a hot female-killer with a mask), which causes him to think about how he lost his own parents.  Joes triumphs, but his confrontation with the Devil star will come back to haunt him--ONE OF MY FAVORITE EPS OF THE SERIES.

#39-40 Jigokiller Parts 1 & 2: This two-parter is the first real display of Ken's feelings for Jun, and sheds more light on the Ken/Red Impulse connection.

#44 ""Gallactor's Challenge"": Dr. Nambu let's it slip that Ken's father is alive, but who can it be?  Shouldn't be too hard to figure out if you're over 10 years old, but still a great episode.",1126569600,15,5024,5.006038647342995
8067245,2,B0009UV7H6,"While many series go into a slump near the end of their runs, Gatchaman gets its slump out of the way early.  The episodes incorporated in this box set are, unfortunately, some of the consistently weakest in the series.  The worst offenders are Episodes 14 (involving the fearsome Ice-kandar), 16 (Mechanika), 18 -20 (the Whales, a ""Speed Race through Hell"", and the INFAMOUS PUPPY EPISODE).  Episode 23, involving a giant bowling ball rampaging through the land is no great shakes either.

More enjoyable episodes in this run involve ""the Fearsome Jellyfish Lens"", ""the Great Insect Operation"", and ""The Neon Giant that Smiles in the Dark"".

Fortunately, from what I remember, the series will begin to pull out of its slump in the next two volumes.  Yes, there will still be duff episodes, but there will be more classics sprinkled in as the run continues.

In my review for Collectors Box Set #1, I said this ADV adaptation was a not-too-embarrassing dub.  With these two volumes, the dub takes giant strides into the cringe-worthy.  The ADR people have upped the late-sixties to mid-seventies slang quotient to a point where it looks like they are using it as a crutch.  The dub-Ken's catchphrase looks like it is going to be ""I can dig it"" or variations thereof.  The slang is cute when used sparingly, as it was in the first two volumes.  It becomes obnoxious when it's used as a sledgehammer.

Despite my lackluster review of this particualar box set, I'm still looking forward to seeing the rest of the series adapted, especially the episodes of the second year.",1126310400,8,1569,4.831460674157303
