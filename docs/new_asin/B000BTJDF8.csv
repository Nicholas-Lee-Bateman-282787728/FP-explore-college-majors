8092505,5,B000BTJDF8,"An absolutely superb film about the tough rural Brasilian life of 2 sons determined to change their lives and break away from life below the poverty line. It is compelling, poetic, emotional, heart-breaking, beautifully filmed, great acting, simply natural and probably the best drama I have ever seen.",1229212800,,302,5.3125
8092506,5,B000BTJDF8,"Beautifully conceived story about Zeze di Camargo, a brilliant Brazilian singer. This real-life story was well produced and touches your heart deeply. Perseverance reaches everything!",1179100800,3,183,6.36
8092507,3,B000BTJDF8,"In a nutshell ""2 Filhos de Francisco"" (""Two Sons of Francisco"") is a success story of hugely popular Brazilian music duo Zez di Camargo & Luciano, multimillion sellers of hit songs of sertanejo, pop country music of Brazil. Since I have neither heard their music except those songs included here nor read anything that is written about the musicians, I have no clue as to the extent of liberty the filmmakers must have taken in telling their life story, which is told in a polished manner, not without clichd moments.

The first chapter is probably the best part of the entire film, which begins with Francisco, father of the musicians, eagerly listening to the music coming from the radio. Francisco, good-natured but overzealous father, encourage two boys Mirosmar (or Zez Di Camargo) and his younger brother Emival to sing and play the music. Later Mirosmar and Emival, still young boys, hit the road with an enterprising manager, singing at local cafes and diners. This is the most engaging moment of the film, thanks to the good acting from the child actors who can really act and sing beautifully.

One tragic event happens, and after that the film gets less interesting mostly because of the absence of these kids and Francisco, flawed but amiable daddy whose actions sometimes cause troubles to the family. The final third goes too fast, lacking enough character development, and the drawn-out conclusion (with real musicians and their parents appearing before the excited audiences) is anti-climax, without which the film could be better.

It is reported that ""2 Filhos de Francisco"" has become the biggest box-office hit in recent years in Brazil, but for the audiences like me watching it outside Brazil, its domestic success might look a little puzzling. Still three characters Francisco and his two sons shine in the film, and the scene of two boys singing at the bus station is a little gem.",1176336000,3,1905,4.946875

Highly recommend it.",1135641600,2,107,4.944444444444445
