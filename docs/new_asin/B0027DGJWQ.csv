8354578,4,B0027DGJWQ,"This is a cute movie, but it has the feeling of ""been there, done that."" Like a lot of Cinderella remakes, it follows the same general storyline of the original. This version is a good remake of those remakes, but doesn't really add anything original or exciting. If you want a movie to watch with your kids, this is a decent bet. But it loses a star for lack of originality.",1257638400,,375,4.295774647887324
