7955992,3,B00005V227,This is a good little fun movie.  Four guys form a local band.  And when the drummer break his arm they need someone to fill in.  So at a talent show the new drummer plays their song to fast and it hit's with the audience and they win the contest.  They then are asked to play at a pizza parlor where everyone is waiting for them to sing that same song.  They attract interest from a major record label and get a manager.  The highlight of the movie is when each member of the group is just doing their daily business when they hear their song on the radio for the first time.  The song becomes a hit and they go on tour.  Where they start having problems.  I saw this movie for the first time.  And looking back I think it's interesting to see what happened to the main cast.  Tom Hanks was the big name.  Although he really wasn't the star.  Liv Tyler looked like she as going to be a big star and went on to be in Armeggedon but really didn't become the star that she could have been.  None of the four leads really became that big.  And at the time I didn't know who Charlize Theron was.  And she has gone on and became one of my favorite actresses.  Any way this is one of those movies that I never get tired of watching.,1521763200,,1226,4.041666666666667

7955998,5,B00005V227,"This was an excellent period piece that was well filmed; well cast and had a rock solid script and excellent music. The title song by the fictious Wonders (originally One-Ders) was catchy; light; boppy and very believable for 1964, the time in which the story is set.

Charlize Theron who played Tina delivered a stellar performance as Guy's ""Shades'"" girlfriend in the movie. Shades was the nice guy on the drums. You might miss out on her development and evolution if you just see the original version which omitted her in many scenes. In the fuller version, you find out just how funny she can be and how and why she is a good match for Shades.

Johnathon Schaech as Jimmy Mattingly II was the group's leader and songwriter. He was also the keyboardist and guitarist. Lenny Haise, the flighty, quirky guitarist was played to perfection by Steve Zahn. In some ways one can liken him to Pete Best of former Beatles' fame. He was not reliable and often showed up late for rehearsals. Even with this liability, the group managed to win a college talent show/contest. T.B. is their bassman and Shades was a fortuitous addition to the group. He became a member when the original drummer broke his wrist horsing around on a parking meter.

Shades turns out to be the runaway and dark horse star of the group, called the One-Ders (Wonders). The only thing I didn't like was when Schaech went into an overly long and tedious dissertation about Chord-vettes as a possible name for the group. Chord as in music and vette as in the Chevrolet. Okay, we get it. Enough with the Chord-vette lecture. Nobody else went for the name and the group became known as the One-Ders instead. A good name at that. I also didn't like it when the group's name was mispronounced as O'Needers. I didn't like the sound of O'Needers at all.

Enter Tom Hanks who agrees to be the group's manager. He wisely encourages them to spell Wonders correctly so as to avoid future mispronunciations. Hanks as Mr. White delivers a credible performance as the manager and he signs the Wonders to Play-Tone records. The group starts to soar and follow the trail of the greats before them such as the Beatles, the DC-5, the Beach Boys, the Kinks and other classic rock delights. The scenes at the hotel in Los Angeles were funny to the point of being classic.

Each Wonder is given his place in the sun, even bassman T.B. whose name is never revealed. Each came adorably Beatle coiffed as in those days Beatle coiffure was the order of the day.

The Beatles' influence is prevalent in the movie. Their group name was mentioned 5 times in the movie. The scenes on the Ed Sullivan show are eerily reminiscent of the February 1964 Beatle appearances (filmed on February 9, 1964 and aired over the space of 2 weeks, February 9 and February 16, 1964.) One can't help but have a giggle at that scene.

When Lenny was off on a tear, a substitute guitarist fills in for the rehearsal. Again, the Beatles' influence is at work. In 1964 George Harrison was laid low with strep throat and a temperature of 104 degrees. His sister Louise nursed him back to health and on February 8 someone filled in for George while he was recuperating. Ed Sullivan even threatened to appear on television in a Beatle wig and looked quite a fool wearing one. Luckily the world was spared that image on television. Fortunately for all, George rallied in time for the big American performance. We all know the Beatles without George is like Chrysler without Dodge. You have to have George or it just isn't the Beatles. Simple as that.

Liv Tyler as Fay, Jimmy's girlfriend is strong and not a cliche groupie. She really carried her weight in this film. She was so good that the movie would never have been nearly as effective or as convincing had she not had a part in it.

This original 1996 version is good, but the newer version with never previously included scenes is even better. I vote for the extended cut version and no doubt you'll be singing the title song. This movie will ""break your heart into a million pieces"" just doing that thing it does.",1440374400,,4083,4.589849108367627
7955999,4,B00005V227,"I am a music lover. This DVD is one of the better Tom Hanks films where he is not one of the major cast  stars. He shows up later in the film and is finished before the end. The music in the film is very good, as is the story. The cast seems to fit the parts very nicely.  This has turned out to be one of my favorite films. I have watched it many times already. I also have the soundtrack and have listened to it many times as well.",1439596800,2,433,3.7472527472527473
