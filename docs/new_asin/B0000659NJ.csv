Lammbock is just one of many really good contemporary comedies produced in Germany. Despite the fact that it is a 'stoner-movie', it has great dialogue and uses a great variety of humor.
I strongly recommend this movie to all stoners and all who like comedies. Be warned, there is some explicit language and some violence in this movie. However, it is a very authentic film, not a chep copy of some American stoner-classics like Chech&Chong or Friday.
I just don't understand why these movies are not put on the U.S. market with English subtitles. I am teaching German here in Washington and I would love to use some of the films (e.g. Knocking on Heavens Door, Lammbock, der Eisbaer, Bam Boom Bang, ...). Unfortunately they are not even offered with English subtitles.
I hope companies will take this into account and hire some translators and put English subtitles to all German films. Why wouldn't you? It's a way to get more exposure to your films. I bet there are more German teachers out there who would be more than thankful, just like me.
Thank you!",1239667200,7,1149,4.721393034825871
