7873513,2,6304525729,"I was once again disappointed with a tsunami documentary which lacked much actual film footage.  Instead, the program is padded with close-ups of ordinary beach waves, better suited for a surfing documentary.  This is  not only disappointing, but scientifically inaccurate, since tsunami rarely  appear as conventional waves, but usually as tumultuous floods or walls of  water.  I continue to be puzzled at the seeming dearth of  video  documentation of this fascinating natural phenomena.  After all, National  Geographic sends intrepid photgraphers to the rims of volcanoes, chasing  tornadoes, and flying into hurricanes.  There are warning systems that can  predict potential landfall for tsunami, so why don't scientists wait for  them in helicopters with video  cameras? But for an organization like  National Geographic to depict tsunami as large surfing waves is surprising  and misinforming.",930873600,26,901,5.704545454545454
