Sometimes, they would focus on speed and range (in the case of Canada and the US), others would rely on maneuverability (USSR). In the race to develop the fastest fighter planes of all time, it was the Arsenal of Democracy, the United States, that conceived the fastest fighter plane designs of any country in the Cold War.

The Republic F-103 Thunderwarrior is awesome. It was the fastest American fighter plane conceived in the 1950s, with a design speed of Mach 5 (3,806.2 miles per hour), almost as fast as Superman, and potentially fast enough to wipe out armadas of marauding Russian fighters and bombers. The secret of the Thunderwarrior's phenomenal speed was a ramjet engine that could operate above Mach 3 because speeds above 2000 mph were too much for the turbojet. The F-108 Rapier is incredible, too, because it was intended to outpace the latest Russian planes like the Tu-22, M-50 and M-52, Tu-125 and Tu-135, and MiG-21. Even though they died on the drawing board, the F-103 Thunderwarrior and F-108 Rapier must surely rank as the top American ""Knights of the Skies"" for their top speed.

Disappointingly, the documentary left out secret Cold War fighter planes designed in the UK, including the Saunders Roe SR.53, SR.177, SR.187, and a number of designs from Armstrong Whitworth, Fairey, and Hawker, but also some unbuilt Russian fighter designs, including the Tu-138 and Tu-148 derivatives of the Tu-128. They also forgot to mention prototype fighter jets built and tested in Abdel Nasser's Egypt, Mao Zedong's China, and Juan Peron's Argentina (e.g., Helwan HA-300, Shenyang J-8 I, Shenyang J-9, FMA Pulqui II).

Regarding parasite fighters, the XF-85 Goblin would have looked good on paper, but its major weaknesses were its top speed (362 mph) and top ceiling (48,000 feet). The parasite fighter adaptations of the F-92 would have been incredible because if you had three B-36s attached to each other wingtip-to-wingtip, they would flown far enough to haul the F-92s over Russia.

The CF-105 Arrow is a good example of a fighter plane whose exciting potential was doomed by politics. Canada's position to the Arctic Circle made it ideal for the Arrow to destroy Russian bombers that were on their way to launch nuclear raids on the US mainland, but Prime Minister John Diefenbaker had it cancelled not just to save money to give the farmers better wages for their labor, but also b/c the KGB stole the secrets of the Arrow's technology. Too bad the Canadian government had the Arrow cancelled b/c the Arrow would have acted as an intermediary in protecting America from the nuclear wrath of the Bear.

At the current time of writing, three of the five permanent UN Security Council members have stealthy air superiority fighters flying (F-22, F-35, T-50, J-20, J-31). The mullahs in Iran have also entered the realm of stealth air superiority fighter technology with the as-yet-unflown Qaher-313, as has India with the Advanced Medium Combat Aircraft, also unbuilt yet. Today, the Eagle and Bear no longer focus on speed when building exotic new fighter planes.",1410825600,,3267,5.065055762081784
