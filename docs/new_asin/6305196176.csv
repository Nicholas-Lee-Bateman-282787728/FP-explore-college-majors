8317603,5,6305196176,"Why did they have to remaster these videos when they were perfectly fine in the first place? I own the un-remastered editions of almost all the series between 1 and 7. Red Dwarf is my favorite show as well, but please  stop touching what doesn't need to be touched! Leave it alone!",943833600,3,281,4.403846153846154
