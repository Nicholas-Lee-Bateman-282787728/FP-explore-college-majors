6937520,5,B00RZHDEIG,"My boys (ages 4 & 8) love this series.  My eight year old has watched from the very first episode.  Now that Dan is getting a little older, Trek is going on more adventures which is kinda cool.

This this series we spend time with Trek at the pool and on other water adventures so meet and learn more about the water dwelling Dinos. During the stores, the boys learn so much about dinosaur behavior, names and habitats.

6937523,5,B00RZHDEIG,"Trek's Adventures: Swimming With Dinosaurs is the newest release in the Dino Dan series, and it sure made a splash in my house! My boys watched it three times in a week! They like all the Dino Dan DVDs, but this one was especially fascinating to them because the ""marine reptiles"" could swim. They learned about the Plesiosaurus, Archelon and Deinosuchus. Their favorite episode was Officer Trek where his mom goes to the police station for work, and Trek dreams that he is a police officer who enforces the law in the dinosaur world. They thought it was pretty hilarious. I especially appreciate that the episodes in the Dino Dan series aren't re-released on different DVDs so you have more than one DVD with the same episode. It's new ones every time, and my kids really enjoy them! Thanks, NCircle, for another great release!",1427846400,,828,4.756944444444445
6937524,5,B00RZHDEIG,"My daughter LOVES this series. If there was ever a mom who was surprised that her kiddo loved dino's it's this one- but as soon as we start a Dino Dan adventure- she is hooked. The episodes are great at keeping you guessing and ""leading: you through the dinosaur adventure. They really know how to keep learning engaging for a young person, and she isn't asking me to ""change the channel"" because she isn't bored! yay! two thumbs up from this mama- and I can't wait to see what her brother has to say about in in a year or two!",1427155200,,527,4.227722772277228
6937525,5,B00RZHDEIG,"My daughter loves dinosaurs lately so this movie was perfect for her! Some of the terms were obviously above her head, but I love that aspect in the fact that it makes her focus and try to really to pronunciate all of the names! She tried to ""swim"" with the dinosaurs and she really enjoyed watching the baby dinosaurs! Great movie for the kids in your life who love dinosaurs!",1427155200,,377,4.4
6937526,5,B00RZHDEIG,"What a great movie! We are new to the Dino Dan series but are 100% in. My daughter couldn't get enough. Not only did she enjoy watching Trek in his adventures, she LOVED all of the baby Dinos. This is a great DVD for girls and boys alike!",1426896000,,238,3.9791666666666665
6937527,5,B00RZHDEIG,"As always, this was another great Dino Dan dvd!  My son couldn't  take his eyes off the tv! He even pulled his dinosaurs out of his room to play along with Trek on his missions. This dvd is still currently being played in our home, he hasn't  watched anything  else since we received it yesterday! I would absolutely  recommend  this dvd to anyone  who has little dino lovers!",1426204800,,376,4.4411764705882355
6937528,3,B00RZHDEIG,"Let's face it, Trek is no Dan.  And all these episodes are all underwater so it gets to be kinda monotonous.  Especially since it seems like every episode is about the plesiosaur.  Weren't there any other prehistoric marine reptiles? (NOT dinosaurs because, as Trek points out, in order to be a dinosaur you had to walk on land so I guess the title is wrong)",1484006400,,358,4.476923076923077
