8685360,5,B00OYJFL34,An excellent rather comprehensive video.,1502409600,,40,7.2
8685361,3,B00OYJFL34,"Despite excellent production quality, this DVD will be of little help to adult learners,

First, the course doesn't define learning objectives. The chalk talk sessions were slow, repetetive, and poorly illustrated,
Show a few real shooters solving real world problems, and then use illustrations to bolster the case. Learners want to see solutions to their problems, not a video billboard for products, seminars, shotguns, and of all things a shooting coat.

I would rather have seen a top ten common mistakes segment, with focused, proven methods to solve the problems. Make the video 90 minutes and focus on the target.

I wasted 200 minutes and over $50.00 that I will never recover.",1493164800,5,686,5.107142857142857
8685362,5,B00OYJFL34,Excellent production quality. Shooting scores improved after watching the video. Kiner helped me quiet the chattering monkey on my shoulder  I now hear Phil Kiner coaching me during my rounds.  Video improved my pre shot visual processor.,1492300800,,238,5.405405405405405

8685365,3,B00OYJFL34,"This CD is not really suitable for beginners.  I got very little useful information out of it other than to not look at the beads on my gun and instead focus solely on the clay.  I was also surprised at what a relatively poor communicator Mr. Kiner is, even though he teaches many trap seminars for a living.  He certainly knows his stuff, but it takes him quite a few minutes of talking to convey a relatively simple concept.  I actually had trouble staying awake through parts of it.",1433462400,7,485,4.415730337078652
