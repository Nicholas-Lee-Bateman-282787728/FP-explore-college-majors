8159147,5,B0000859P4,"great show - so cheesy its sublime - it borders on genius - a very solid slice of Japanese pop culture - an odd hero fighting even odder foes - if you are even remotely into this kind of show, buy this - you will be amazed at its audacity - and its sincerely done - played straight, not for laughs - this is the kind of thing that youd want playing on a big screen in the background at a house party - i would anyway - it would draw a crowd - in a similar vein i also recommend SUPER ROBOT RED BARON and IRON KING - and of course ULTRAMAN",1301875200,2,538,3.769911504424779
