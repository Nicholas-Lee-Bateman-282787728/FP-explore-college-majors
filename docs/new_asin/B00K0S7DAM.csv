8654967,3,B00K0S7DAM,"The Generation Me (Jeremy Buck and Max Buck)- Petey Williams and Sonjay Dutt match was a good way to open to the show with the right team winning to boot. The Aces & Eights (Garett Bischoff and Wes Brisco)-The Hot Shots (Cassidy Riley and Chase Stevens) match had no flow with sloppy work to add. The Austin Aries and Bobby Roode-The British Invasion (Doug Williams and Rob Terry) match while the crowd wasn't into it, the bout was still good in it's own right. The Chavo Guerrero and Hernandez-Bad Influence (Christopher Daniels and Kazarian) match while still good, clean and simple, the wrong team won this time. The Magnus and Samoa Joe-Aces & Eights (Garett Bischoff and Wes Brisco) match was struggle but still passable. The Team 3D (Bully Ray and Devon)-Generation Me (Jeremy Buck and Max Buck) match was solid to say the least. The Austin Aries and Bobby Roode-Magnus and Samoa Joe match while still good, it never got to the next level we wanted. The Team 3D (Bully Ray and Devon)-Chavo Guerrero and Hernandez match was acceptable but boring. The  Team 3D (Bully Ray and Devon)-Austin Aries and Bobby Roode match while not bad, it was still a poor PPV main event due to it's lack of air time. I give this PPV a 6 out of 10.",1422230400,,1232,4.574660633484163
8654968,3,B00K0S7DAM,"This PPV is part of the ""TNA: One Night Only"" series which are just stand alone PPV events (shows that occur outside the current storylines & happenings on IMPACT Wrestling) with each one having a special theme.  This edition is based around a tournament featuring tag teams of the past & present to determine who's the greatest tag team in TNA history.

Petey Williams & Sonjay Dutt vs. Generation Me - This was one of the qualifying matches to get one of the open slots in the tournament that saw both teams having bodies flying all over the place with individual offense such as head scissors & top rope armdrags to impactful offense such as the Canadian Destroyer & a drop top twisting cutter & even a springboard double dropkick that not only took out an opponent but also the camera man along with double team offense such as back to back 450 & moonsault splashes off the top rope.  This was a fast paced match full of non-stop action.

Hot Shots (Chase Stevens & Cassidy Riley) vs. Aces & Eights (Garrett Bischoff & Wes Brisco) - The second qualifying match of the match with Hot Shots took control early grounding both members of Aces & Eights with armdrags & armbars along with some double team moves before Brisco & Bischoff was able to take control using quick tags & keeping one member away from his partner while taking advantage of the referee.  This was an average match but one of Bischoff & Brisco's better performances.

British Invasion (Rob Terry & Douglas Williams) vs. Bobby Roode & Austin Aries - Before I get started as a side note, Tenay & Taz kept putting over the fact that British Invasion were former tag team champions but it was the team of Williams & Magnus that were the champions & not Rob Terry.  Aries & Roode kept attempting to mock both men only to get receipts in return leading to miscommunication issues between both men allowing British Invasion to individually work over both men before they got back on the same page with double teaming & singling out who they thought was the weaker member of the team heavily working over the arm with yanks & twist along using the environment around ringside.  This was a good tag match that had it's entertaining moments.

Chavo Guerrero & Hernandez vs. Bad Influence - This started out with Bad Influence up to their old tricks taking advantage of the referee's position for illegal double teaming only for it to work against them a second time causing them to resort to other tactics along with double teaming to take the advantage while Chavo used his lucha libre influenced offense such as a head scissors & 3 Amigos along with Hernandez's power such a bear hug into overhead throw & a mid-air catch as both teams traded momentum with both grounded & aerial offense.  This was a good contest.

Samoa Joe & Magnus vs. Aces & Eights - Joe & Magnus dominated individually & together working over a body part while Aces & Eights' offense had no effect on them before finally being able to break one of them down heavily working over the knees with stretches & strikes including the spinning toe hold while also resorting to dirty tactics.  Solid tag team match & possibly the best match I've ever seen Brisco & Bischoff involved in.

Generation Me vs. Team 3D - 3D came out the gate beating both men down & dominating using their superior power as they were able to just keep stopping them dead in their tracks & keeping them grounded whenever attempting to gain some momentum taunting them in the process as well before Generation Me was finally able to take advantage of a moment of miscommunication before 3D was able to catch them once again.  This wasn't anything past a very one sided dominate performance by 3D.

Samoa Joe & Magnus vs. Bobby Roode & Austin Aries - Joe & Magnus started out in control with their trademark double teaming moves along with staying one step ahead of Aries & Roode such as just easily walking out of the way of a top rope crossbody causing Roode & Aries to resort to dirty tactics such as taking advantage when the referee wasn't looking their direction while double teaming & singling out one member of the team.  This was a nice match.

Chavo Guerrero & Hernandez vs. Team 3D - Both teams had some entertaining back & forth interaction against each other & with the crowd in the early moments and kept trading momentum throughout the match as both teams used the same strategy of isolating one of their opponents in their corner & working him over individually or with double teaming while not being afraid to take a shot behind the referee's back.  A good match between two evenly matched teams.

Team 3D vs. Bobby Roode & Austin Aries - Both teams had a ""match"" before the match itself when it came to who did the best ring announcing for their own team which resulted in both teams brawling around ringside with each team having no problem using a weapon or dirty tactics before things settled down with Aries & Roode beating Team 3D at their own game taunting & goating one member in the ring while working over the other in their corner along with one team trying to use the same tactics that worked in a previous match only to backfire on this occasion.  This was a very entertaining match with both teams not only trying to out wrestle each other but also cheat & outclass each other as well.

This was a very well done tournament with teams from the past & present resulting the matches ranging from good to entertaining with Bischoff & Brisco have the best matches I can remember from either guy so this is an event I would recommend.",1398902400,,5562,4.56425702811245
