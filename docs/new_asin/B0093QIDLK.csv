5256496,4,B0093QIDLK,"A good straight up documentary of the show, prepping for the show, and comments from the competitors. Not much drama involved like in Pumping Iron, but still good. The extra feature is Arnold doing different poses in his earlier days. The DVD had different music from the VHS I saw, and a longer running time. Worth getting.",1356393600,12,324,4.701754385964913
5256497,5,B0093QIDLK,"Received the DVD on 11/24/12 in perfect shape. Just what I expected, have enjoyed watching the DVD, play it during my workouts at home. Love it. Only wish that there was the 2 disc set available. Other than that would recomend it to any Arnold fan.",1356048000,6,248,4.413043478260869
5256498,5,B0093QIDLK,"Arnold looking as good as ever. His presence is dominating and devastating for his competitors. Whether some of them had certain, better developed body parts or not, there is none who had it all like him.",1424217600,,204,4.694444444444445

5256505,5,B0093QIDLK,Great product and fun to walk down memory lane with Arnold.  He has provided great entertainment over the years and it was nice to get a look at the genesis of his public career.  The video was shipped in a timely manner and arrived in excellent shape.,1420416000,,252,4.340425531914893

5256507,5,B0093QIDLK,"Back to the Golden Days of REAL bodybuilding, when all men looked different, had shape size, and the lack of drug dependency. Brings back great memories of Arnold, Chris Dickerson, Frank Zane, and many others. Excellent! Small cameo by Joe Gold, is worth the price, just to see the man, whose name, created an empire!",1418860800,2,317,4.781818181818182

5256512,1,B0093QIDLK,"I never recieved it!!  I was sent a video of Steely Dan in Concert instead ( I have no idea why I received it , since I never ordered it)When I e-mailed the company to let them know- I never received a response or The Comeback  very disappointed  it was a gift for my son-obviously he never got it  Also just ordered the solar Hawiian girl-it doesnt work at all
i will think long and hard before I use Amazon again  Too bad  never used to have these problems with Amazon!!",1394755200,2,472,4.131868131868132
5256513,4,B0093QIDLK,"If Arnold won that contest, then Popeye's a punk. Arnold was allowed to do what ever he wanted, and time he wanted!!!",1394236800,2,117,4.363636363636363
5256514,4,B0093QIDLK,"I just watched this DVD and it was a great DVD about ""Arnold' 6 time Mr. Olympia. Also known as ""The Austrian Oak"" competing in the 1980 Mr. Olympia contest and winning his 7th Title. It also covers other top Body Builders Frank Zane, Tom Platz and Boyer Coe. It was not as good as ""Pumping Iron"". It should of had more extras on this DVD about Body Building. One great extra was the early film of Arnold posing in his younger days, already a big mass of muscle.",1392940800,,462,4.202247191011236
5256515,5,B0093QIDLK,I got this for my husband for the holidays and he loves it. He has a lot of Arnold merch.,1391126400,,89,3.5
5256516,4,B0093QIDLK,"This a great dvd for all bodybuilding fans in general and Arnold fans in specific. I owned the original VHS version and the only difference I noticed was in the music background and posing routines music. This DVD does not play the original songs during the posing routines, maybe due to copyright restrictions! Anyway, the quality of the movie is excellent and I recommend it for all bodybuilding enthusiasts. It showcases one of history's most controversial Olympias.",1390521600,2,469,5.103896103896104
5256517,4,B0093QIDLK,"This was a very good DVD. It was fun to watch and get to see so many of ""The best of the best"" I would recommend this product to people who like weight lifting.",1389830400,,160,3.735294117647059
5256518,5,B0093QIDLK,I also purchased the video for her as well. She is really pleased with both the encyclopedia and the videos.,1389052800,,108,4.45
5256519,5,B0093QIDLK,This was a really cool movie to watch if you are interested in the Schwarzenegger at all!  It opens your eyes to the world of bodybuilding as it was and just shows you how much showmanship Arnold really brings to the table.  The guy knew what he wanted to do and did it...some of us could be so lucky.,1388448000,,301,4.084745762711864
5256520,5,B0093QIDLK,i DIDNT EVEN KNOW THAT THIS DVD WAS AROUND.ONE OF THE BEST DVD ON ARNOLD THAT I WILL SEE ALL THE TIME,1387238400,,101,3.6363636363636362
5256521,5,B0093QIDLK,"If you're a fan of the golden age of bodybuilding and Arnold, you need this in your collection. It was short but it was a ""last look"" or grand finale of that 70's bodybuilding era that I LOVED! I watched it 3 times in a row when I got. I seem the yearn for this time period. I think its just me getting old and not wanting things to change though. Be forewarned though, the soundtrack will make you stark raving mad.",1385078400,,416,4.085365853658536
5256522,5,B0093QIDLK,"Interesting look at perhaps the most controversial Mr. Olympia ever!

Personally I was mostly interested in seeing the footage of Frank Zane in this documentary since he is my favorite bodybuilder of all time. Frank had suffered an almost fatal injury (severing his urethra after falling into his pool when his chair slide into it) and was barely able to make this show. In retrospect he feels he would have been better served competing the following year.

I also enjoyed seeing the other competitors and the interactions among Tom Platz, Samir Bannout, Dennis Tinnerino etc, and the footage with Tom Platz is also very interesting. Though I never really liked Tom's physique (awesome legs but unfortunately they were so spectacular it messed up his overall symmetry, but this is a personal opinion), I have tremendous respect for the intensity he brought to the 'sport'

Anyway, if you are a fan of Bodybuilding you'll probably enjoy this as a slice of time captured of a past era!",1384646400,5,983,4.909638554216867
5256523,5,B0093QIDLK,"I am a huge fan since his arrival on our shores,even thogh I lost money,much needed money on Planet Hollywood venture and inspite of his recent Headline making news and not his movie, his success getting Bodybuilding viewed differently-an Art-Mind over matter and the arena of politics.  At my age I have nothing but admiration for this man. This film only touches the outer rim of Arnold.",1379548800,,389,4.8059701492537314
5256524,3,B0093QIDLK,"I am rating the product here. The shipping was first class! Came in and arrived on time and in perfect condition. Moving on, there is actually a documentary you can  ""youtube"" called TOTAL REBUILD. I found this version to be better. Although I cannot find it for purchase. There is no music background in this particular version and I found it a little boring to watch. Meh..",1376956800,,375,4.597014925373134
5256525,5,B0093QIDLK,"the man, the legend, the truth! its an awesome compliment to ""Pumping Iron"" get get!!!! shows how even though Arnold went into Hollywood he came back with a big BANG!",1364774400,2,166,4.566666666666666
5256526,5,B0093QIDLK,"This short DVD is a good look at Arnold and some of the other prominent bodybuilders from 1980.  You get to see training, interviews, and a lot of posing during the competition.  I personally feel Arnold won due to his popularity and was definitely not the best competitor in the field.  But this is a great DVD for any bodybuilding or Arnold Schwarzenegger fan.",1363392000,11,362,4.625

8535321,3,B0093QIDLK,"Less than DVD Quality, was most likely filmed on VHS then transferred over to DVD.  Very little structure as in Pumping Iron; brief interviews with Tom Platz and Frank Zane are interesting but overall a lackluster production.  It is worth a view, but only once.",1437264000,2,261,4.777777777777778

8535325,4,B0093QIDLK,"The 1980 Olympia was contentious as Arnold entered at the last minute (and won). He also broke the rules onstage by leaping forward and doing more poses. But that's the Arnold we all expect. I thought the DVD would cover the near fist fight between Mentzer and Arnold but there was nothing more dramatic than Arnold's usual musings. Don't buy this if you want a behind-the-scenes reaction of Arnold's comeback. Buy this if you recognize the names of he bodybuilders of this golden era. There is also footage of Arnold at 19 pumping up and posing. Huge. Good genetics...sheesh. In my opinion, Zane was ripped but too small to compete with the big boys. Mentzer's legs were awesome but Arnold's arms and chest just overwhelmed. Arnold's front double-biceps pose just rips other bodybuilders a new one. Same with the angled back shot on the cover of the DVD. In my opinion, first place went to the right man. Interesting coverage on this DVD but could have used a lot less Platz (great legs, spaghetti arms).",1426291200,6,1005,4.748571428571428
