495355,5,6302681049,"So you know that I'm only going to give this movie 5 stars, I am such a big fan it's ridiculous.  I've seen this movie over and over and over and over again until I knew word by word and line by line, I haven't watched in a few years, I can catch it on VH1 all the time, but to have it on video is just fabulous.  If you haven't seen it yet, it's a must for Jackson fans.",993600000,2,371,3.625
495356,5,6302681049,"This movie.... is the movie for all ages.  My kids love it.  When I first saw this movie I fell in love with it.  I had tape both parts had it for years, then it got lost.  I took it over to someon's house and they could  never find it.  I've always tried to tape it again but never had the  opportunity to do so.  Evey character is this movie was casted well.  I was  not disappointed at no time.  This movie is a classic, and all Black  Americans should have this movie in their homes.  I would like to get my  hand on the video for purchase, but every-where I go says that it's  not  availible.  Why?, I do not know.  This movie should be in high demand.  Why  doesn't the publisher make more availible to us.  Why is it that this  particular video is hard to get a hold of? If anyone out there, publisher,  someone that has knowledge to how I could get a hold to this video, please  let me know.  I would really appreciate it.  I've been looking off and on  for about 3years, so if you know anything please e-mail me with the  information.",958348800,14,1043,4.08
495357,5,6302681049,Lawrence Hilton Jacobs did Joe Jackson Mad Justice! why the Brother didn't get an Award is crazy. Angela Bassett is very Impressive as Katherine Jackson.this film deals with the Ups&downs of show biz and the constant  Battles within a family.it sheds light on alot of issues that Michael  Jackson had to deal with. Billy Dee Williams does a good job of being Berry  Gordy.the same goes for Vanessa Williams doing Suzanne De Passe. De Passe  had alot of Impact on Motown.thru this film you see how Michael Jackson  became the Greatest.and the many great talented people that were involved  in his growth as a Artist.,950054400,3,615,4.809523809523809
495358,5,6302681049,I saw this movie on tv and i taped it and now this movie i cannot find. i Think this movie tells the whole entire thing how Mich Jackson grows up. And i hope i get this movie foe Christmas.,944092800,,189,3.75
495359,5,6302681049,This is the greatest TV Mini Series of all time. Michael Jackson is the greatest artist in HIStory and this is a great way to celebrate his beginnings.,930528000,,151,4.428571428571429
495360,3,6302681049,"The Jackson Five (circa late 60s/early 70s) was arguably the best group to come out of Motown, and this video, originally an ABC miniseries, attempts to chronicle the life and times of one of the most talented and most  dysfunctional families in show business.
One of the film's strongest  points is its treatment of the patriarch Joseph Jackson, played by Lawrence  Hilton-Jacobs.  Often characterized as a monster in real life (especially  by daughter LaToya), Joseph seems more realistic here as the stern father  determined to see his sons realize the dream of musical success he was  never able to achieve.  While some of his actions seem cruel (like not  allowing the boys to attend sister Rebbie's wedding because they had a  gig), some are not that bad (like have the boys pile the bricks from  frontyard to backyard).
It is sometime confusing, because each of the  five members of the group (six, if you count Randy) are portrayed by 2 to 3  different actors as the characters age.  Some are believable, excellent  actors (like Bumper Robinson as the first Jackie), some are HORRIBLE actors  (like whoever played Jermaine as he was leaving the group).  But  UNQUESTIONABLY, the best of all the brothers was Jason Weaver (who later  starred in ""Thea"" and now plays Marcus on ""Smart Guy"").  He was the second Michael, the Michael from the ""I Want You  Back""/""ABC""/""I'll Be There"" days.  Weaver, who is  a talenter singer and dancer in own right, makes you believe that he is an  11 year-old Michael Jackson, and the early Motown scenes seem to revolve  around him; you can't wait for him to perform again, USING HIS OWN  VOICE(!!!) in many of the scenes.
BEST SCENCE IN THE ENTIRE FILM: The  Jackson 5 at the Apollo theater on Amateur Night, performing the Isley  Brothers' ""Twist and Shout"".  You'll be on your feet  shouting!
But, having said all of that, the weak acting and flimsy script  in the later scenes take a lot away from the film.  Sadly, Angela Bassett  is wasted in the role of mother Katherine Jackson (although she had done  ""Boyz N the Hood"" at this point, this was LONG before  ""What's Love Got to Do With It"" or ""Waiting to Exhale"",  her two best roles) Additionally, someone had the silly idea of casting  Holly Robinson Peete as Diana Ross, and Billy Dee Williams as Berry Gordy.  While they are both great actors, they are miscast and sorely unbelievable  in these roles.
Finally, how can you chronicle the tale of the Jackson  FAMILY all the way into the late 80s without giving serious attention to  JANET??  By this miniseries' release in 1992, both the ""Control""  and ""Rhythm Nation 1814"" albums had been released, and Janet was  a MAJOR star whose fame was obviously the result of her talent and not her  last name (unlike LaToya).  Ignoring her detracts from the film's impact as  the story of the FAMILY.
In a nutshell, if you're a big fan of the  Jackson Five, especially the early years, you'll love it. But if you can  only afford one miniseries about a Motown group, buy ""The  Temptations"" instead.",923616000,15,3039,4.717017208413002
495361,5,6302681049,This film is absolutely brilliant. I have been after the proper film for ages as I have only seen it on the television. It goes through Michael Jackson's childhood and fame so unique. I recomend this to all Michael  Jackson fans.,919209600,,229,4.585365853658536

495625,5,6302681049,"I have been a fan of Michael Jackson & his brothers since I was young & grew up with their music & when Michael Jackson went solo. If you or anyone you know is a fan of Michael Jackson & his brothers or just Michael Jackson, you are getting a good deal, because it talks about his youth & his family life growing up in Gary, Indiana with his brothers & sisters & while Michael & his brothers were always touring, it was hard for them at times to see his sisters or their mother Katherine & not attending a sister's wedding when they were touring or recording a music video or song, I ordered 1 of these DVDs for me & a another one for a close best friend who also likes Michael Jackson & his brothers & it was a bigger surprise to see Jermaine was married to Hazel, Barry Gordy's daughter & I think the music world was surprised as well to see that happen. So if your a fan of the King of Pop, get this DVD for yourself or anyone that is a Michael Jackson or the Jackson ""5"" fan, I suggest it.",1501372800,,993,4.02020202020202

495630,5,6302681049,"Great Bio-pic! When it came out in 1992, it was Must See Tv. Couldn't take your eyes off of the screen. Excellent casting, with the exception of Marlon compared to Jason Weaver's, Michael. The brother looked nothing like Marlon. Didn't embody his spirit either. Hated the choreography too. It was absolutely horrible when the actors performed as the Jackson 5. 25 years later, as I watch this mini series again, I still hate the choreography even more.",1497916800,,452,4.883116883116883

496239,5,6302681049,"Very good job.  Will watch it once a year at least.  A struggling family.  A determined father; a supportive mother and all of their children became stars but one became a super-star.  And when they got older, when the children got older and times had changed from what they use to be the dumb children claimed their parents had abused them.  THAT'S WHY I WANT TO WATCH IT.  All of these African American children who became super-stars like Beyonce and the Serena Williams, etc cetera, had a father who pushed them to heights and they pushed themselves yes--but there parents were there, gave them their life to make them stars (and then) they turned on their fathers because THE TIMES CHANGE AND NEW CULTURE CAME IN making it okay to berate your parents.  Nowadays, a child can shoot their parents and make a claim it was self-defense because their parents yelled at them about cleaning their room.  THAT'S WHY I WILL WATCH THIS MOVIE...to remind myself of parents who pushed their children to stardom during times when they were never suppose to have anything at all.  Well.  Not much.  And the kind of work they were suppose to be doing was house-keeping or working in a restuarant.  But they told their fathers their dream, and, their fathers helped them to reach their pinnacles.--MO",1434758400,,1289,4.7309417040358746

The actors were very convincing in their roles.  Joe Jackson, according to what I saw in the movie, was a monster.  He was fanatical, and was brutally abusive.  Katherine Jackson, on the other hand, seems like a mother who didn't withhold love from any of her children.  It's a 2 disc movie, and begins when Joe and Katherine first meet, and goes up until their Victory Tour.  I rate this film 5 Stars, and would recommend it.

496472,3,6302681049,"If I were a 'fan' I would not like this series. It basically explains why beneath their hard-working exterior, the Jacksons are messed up.

Joseph Jackson morphs from a fast-talking flirt into an abusive father who does whatever he wants whenever he wants. The family has ragged clothes and no power. But Joe buys brand new equipment for them to play music anyways. He does not hear his wife's desperate pleas.

He also laughs when young Michael is heartbroken over loss of a 'pet'. After his son did do everything asked--and even won a competion trophy, Joe Jackson still was arrogant. Of course everybody has issues with a dad, But it takes something without a soul to laugh off a child's grieving. Even taking  liberties'  the rat's death a very sad movie scene.

Of course Michael Jackson is going to be the Jackson with issues to work through. You can practically see it in the storyline. The only way it could have been more obvious was if an announcement flashed across the bottom half of the screen.  Everything is not 'fine'.

The movie timeline ends in the 1980s. The biggest issue it covered with Jackson's appearance was the 'accident' from the Pepsi commercial where his hair  accidentally caught on fire. Special effects during the commercial had gone wrong. There is nothing else included.

It's a long movie, but the acting is good. There are some theatrical/technical tweaks. Overall, it's a decent view which also makes a memorable impression.",1413763200,,1461,4.858870967741935

497060,5,6302681049,"I was pleasantly surprised with this miniseries.  It truly did give a good look at what life was like for the Jackson's back in Gary, Indiana.  It also explains their drive to get out of  Gary Indiana and seek a better life in California in the sunshine, their Utopia.  It would have been interesting to see how the family fared if the J5 had not been successful.  May-be  Jackie would have been supporting the family, by playing professional baseball.

All aside I think this miniseries fills in many of the gaps to their family life, such as how Joe worked double shifts to earn enough money to feed the family,  also his brutality with the children.  It really made you cringe when one of them was getting a whipping.  Also what they used to eat when he got laid off and how the family just loved babies and why they had so many, which also tails into how Michael loved babies.  I do believe they were happy being a large family.  It also goes into 'finer' detalis such as Jackie wanting to have more freedom as a teenager and sneaking out at night,  but still having to look after his younger brothers.  Also Reebie doing many of the chores in bringing up the younger children.  Life in Gary, Indiana seemed brutal outside the home and both Joe and Katherine wanted a better life for their family.  This is probably what drove them to work the children such long hours.

The actors chosen for the miniseries were very credible.  It must have been interesting for Jermaine Jnr to play his father, especially the scene where he was with with a groupie in his room on tour.  The screenplay also follows the books of Jermaine and Katherine quite closely.  It is really like the series is told through Katherine's eyes, from when she met Joe up to when she knew he was seeing other women.

Overall this gives a very realistic portrayal of the Jacksons and not just when they became successful.",1346976000,2,1892,4.5058823529411764

497062,5,6302681049,"The Jacksons: An American Dream was a mini-series that aired in late 1992 and was quite successful, it was a fantastic look into the Jackson family and Michael Jackson's early years. Years later it remains the best  and most well executed ""documentary"" on Michael Jackson and his family because the heart was at the right place, the actors did have some talent (Jermaine Jackson is played by none other than his son Jermaine Jr.) and the story is the closest depiction the actual story we've had thus far . An American Dream is in linear fashion from the meeting of Joseph and Katherine Jackson up until the brothers' last tour with Michael, the Victory tour in 1984 with no interruption or flashback. It's not actually a documentary but it's more of a telling of the events as a movie, that's how I think most would see it.

 Was happy to see this series being released on DVD at a reasonable price as the VHS collections can sell for insane prices on the internet. I was too young when the mini-series aired to watch it or even know who the Jackson family was unfortunately but I had much pleasure viewing this. Right from the beginning with Joe Jackson meeting Katherine I had a feeling that this mini-series was done right. Watching the events as they unfolded you can't help but be into it and you want to find out what happens next, you're into it, you're hooked and you know it. The best part is even if you're not a fan or aren't familiar with the family the chances are very high that you would still be captivated and thus enjoy it. I honestly believe anyone could like it. Watching Joe discipline his boys and turn them into the performers that they became, one can argue with his method but there was certain smarts to him, he was the one who made way for it to happen and recognized talent in his sons. We sympathize with all the boys as they are being disciplined at the hand of Joseph in ways that most of us can't imagine doing today (we don't see a lot of violent acts except one scene with a whip I can recall, but still). It's a fantastic transition we get to watch the Jacksons as children grow into teenagers (complete with a Michael with acne who hated his appearance and his nose) and finally, young men. I don't think any events were dragged too long as some others have mentioned, I think all that was included deserved/needed to be included.

The actors all did a solid job, even with the changes in actors for the brothers as they got older it doesn't lose a thing. Even the surrounding cast members, Barry Gordy, Jermaine's wife Hazel and everyone else was good more so considering this wasn't an actual movie. Lawrence Hilton Jacobs and Angela Bassett as Joseph and Katherine respectively were superb in their job, and displayed a lot of emotions and I thought had resemblance to them. Joseph especially I thought was right on and it's hard to imagine someone doing better at portraying him. The daughters, with the exception of Rebbie get very little and close to no airtime in the movie at all, I don't think there was any harm meant but this was clearly focused on Michael and his brothers which is why we see little of them. Wylie Draper as an adult Michael stands out, during the now legendary 25th anniversary performance he was a fantastic imitator, he looked the part and he has the moves. It's a shame that he passed away a year later, he would have been excellent had there been a continuation on this (technically Man In The Mirror was ""supposed"" to be the follow and it picks up right where this left off, but other than for a laugh it offers little and is dreaded the vast majority of the fans). One of the best parts of the mini-series is that there are performances (and they are very well done, close to the actual thing) along with the real music. It would've been dull if there were no performance and music, I'm glad they able do them here.

There are certain incorrect facts, such as Joseph and Katherine meeting in 1945 when in reality they met in 1947. Or Michael being born a year later, 1959 instead of 1958. Or Michael being seen recording the song ""Human Nature"" for the Thriller album in the studio in 1983 which is incorrect since Thriller was released in 1982. But you know what? Those are little details and factual errors probably only the real hardcore Michael Jackson and Jackson 5 fans will notice, besides they have everything else right and those 5 hours represent one of the best music films I have seen being fairly accurate and highly entertaining at the same time. Of course there are little things that aren't what actually happened  but the heart is at the right place and I can't fault this mini-series for anything but giving me a good time and at the same time understanding the family a little more. A well deserved 5 stars for The Jacksons: An American Dream. Highest recommendation.",1343779200,,4859,4.522184300341297

They didn't made him into a joke like that flop of a movie ""Man in the Mirror"". I am very aware of the passing of Wylie Draper, the man who played Michael. It's a shame..he was perfect for the role. I can't think of any other actors that could pull of Michael's role the way Wylie did. May God rest his soul. Fans should definitely get this instead for accuracy. The best thing about this movie that it had a theme..it's about chasing the American dream.

497067,4,6302681049,"I must express the same sentiment as an earlier reviewer about my initial reluctance to view this film. At the time of its release there had been quite a bit of media focus on the Jackson Family's dysfunction, and this was the year before the first allegations of child sexual abuse were made against Michael.
 Around that time, the footage of the Jackson 5 performing ""Rockin' Robin"", which I most likely saw when it was new, was rebroadcast on one channel, and with the knowledge of their behind-the-scenes situation, I couldn't enjoy the performance in the way I once might have.
  In this 1992 portrayal of the Jackson Family, Lawrence Hilton-Jacobs, best remembered by me as Freddie ""Boom Boom"" Washington on ""Welcome Back Kotter"", absents himself from comedy to lead the cast as Joe Jackson, the family's tough patriarch, and Angela Bassett plays Katherine Jackson, his wife, replacing her character's soft demure quality inherited by her best-loved son, with a certain firmness.
  The couple, who have both shared some musical aspirations(although in this series, Katherine was training as a nurse),meet, court, and marry when Katherine becomes pregnant. They settle at 2300 Jackson Street, of all places, and begin raising a family, including their oldest daughter, Maureen Reillette known as ""Rebbie""(Monica Calhoun), Jackie(Bumper Robinson,Terrence Howard), Tito(Angel Vargas, Shakiem Evans), Jermaine(Jermaine Jackson II,Colin Steele), La Toya(Kellie Martin, Ebonie Smith), Marlon(Floyd Roger Myers Jr.,Jacen Wilkerson), their brightest and most shining star, Michael(Alex Burrall,Jason Weaver, and Wylie Draper), followed by Randy(Nicholas Phillips),and baby Janet(Maya Nichole Johnson).
  Much of the focus is placed on the boys of the family, as their father's musical aspirations crumble amid their struggle to make ends meet, and Katherine discovers the musical talent of her sons.  A steel mill worker,Joe begins to make sacrifices to advance his sons' musical career, and would currently be classified as a ""Tiger Dad"" as he ensures that they don't miss a beat, working with them and rehearsing them until they gradually improve.
  Young Alex Burrall, who plays Michael as a child is an absolutely precocious heart-stealer as he depicts the sensitivity of the group's young frontman, who wins hearts at a school talent show singing ""Climb Evr'y Mountain"", secretly keeps an illicit rat as a pet, and outruns his father when facing a spanking.
  Joe uses corporal punishment and cajolement to keep his kids in line,and although in reality, Katherine reportedly did as well, she is shown weeping helplessly with her children during such sessions in scenes that are difficult to watch. But in the tough neighborhood to which they were relegated due to their race, he must be credited with keeping his brood out of trouble.
  The boys enter and occasionally win talent shows,and soon go on the road for auditions with their father, working very late hours and sometimes in seedy locations where children should not be. But noteworthy is the fact that in a society that was only beginning to do away with the long-standing practice of segregation, African Americans would still have had fewer options as to where they would have been accepted, and they had to accept gigs wherever they could. There is one devastating incident, where during a mugging, Joe is injured and they are deprived of some of their musical equipment. But later, they still manage to play the Apollo.
  Ultimately, the lovely Suzanne De Passe (Vanessa Williams), a talent scout for Motown Records founder Berry Gordy(Billy Dee Williams), talks her reluctant boss, wary of the challenges in dealing with child performers, into giving them an audition. Gordy is impressed, and the clan's ascent officially begins.
  We follow them through their appearance on ""The Ed Sullivan Show"", their move to California, Jermaine's romance with Berry Gordy's daughter Hazel(portrayed by a lovely hazel-eyed Monica Allison), their affiliation with mentor Diana Ross (Holly Robinson-Peete), their work in the recording studio, during which we see an apprehensive Joe viewing Berry Gordy as a rival for his sons' affections, and Jason Weaver at the center of it all as Michael at ages 9-14, engaging in pranks with Marlon,including upsetting a would-be tryst that Jermaine tried to have with a groupie, and having a nervous breakdown so profound, he is reluctant to get on another plane during a tour,but still shining once onstage. Tito, in the meantime, has fallen in love with a girl named Dee Dee (Elizabeth Narvaez), which like Jermaine's relationship with Hazel is much to his father's disapproval.
 By the mid-seventies,Tito has married Dee Dee, Jermaine has married Hazel, and the brothers, except for Jermaine, sever their contract with Motown.
 In a prelude to his own sudden sunset,the talented and promising Wylie Draper,whose doe-eyed vulnerability expresses the beautiful wistfulness of the man he portrayed,and who danced with Michael in his short film for the song, ""Remember the Time"", captures the soft voice and gentle nature as well as the strength of the pop star from his late teens through his early 20s,getting the dance moves from the Robot to the Moonwalk down pat, lamenting severe acne and the perceived hideousness that would later drive him to multiple plastic surgeries, feeling the pressure of trying to live up to public expectations, but still giving his all when he appears onstage. The two main crises of the family during the ""Thriller"" era are Katherine's confirmation of Joe's infidelity, which drives her to spend time with her mother(Margaret Avery), and later, Michael's suffering 2nd and 3rd degree burns while filming a Pepsi Commercial.
  Had there been a more in-depth depiction of that crisis, it might have been noted that Michael, bandaged head and all, still visited other patients in that ward who were worse off than he was( and had done so even before being a patient there), and as is well-known, donated the money from his settlement with Pepsi to the burn unit that treated him.
  As he recovers, he spends time with his menagerie, including pet snake, Muscles, and pet chimp, Bubbles. The Encino home is a reserve for the many animals Michael rescued.
  At the end the boys are still performing together, and we leave them onstage during their 1984 Victory Tour, as Michael addresses the crowd, reviewing how far they have come, and somewhat ironically in hindsight, vowing not to be beaten down by fame.
  Wylie Draper would lose his life to a rare form of leukemia at the age of 24, a year after this miniseries aired. But this was his moment, and he made the most of it.
  In the end, fans must echo back the sentiment of the brothers to their fans: ""We thank you for the joy you have given us! We thank you!""",1298678400,4,6838,5.134234234234234

I have to admit that I'm not much of a fan of the Jackson family, but I do like this miniseries a lot. The acting is brilliant; Lawrence Hilton-Jacobs gives a stellar performance as the strict father and Angela Bassett's performance as the mother (who once had polio earlier in life).
The movie begins in the 40s when the parents meet as teenagers, then by the mid 50s, they have started having a family. The kids get into music (and into some occasional trouble) during their childhood years (they get signed on to the Motown label before the end of the 60s, and a couple of the boys would change labels by the late 70s). Part 2 of the movie starts in 1970, when their song ""ABC"" became a smash hit and ends into the early 80s around the time of their famous ""Victory Tour"" and of Michael Jackson's solo career (though there is little seen of this; the group's string of hits had stopped around the mid 70s after ""Dancing Machine"" came out).

The actors (4) for Michael (including the last one by himself) all did a excellent job and all the music throghout the show is an addition to the story. Comparing to all the other books I have read (Michaels Biography book by Randy, the one by Christopher as well as the one by himself (titled moonwalker), this is the one I enjoyed most ( Moonwalker is not as comprehensive, and biography by others are bitterly criticizing and biased).

Please pick up this movie, because you will enjoy it. It has a great cast and they picked excellent actors for all of the Jacksons. It even has little lighthearted momemnts and will sometimes make you laugh. My favorite actor is Jason Weaver who is excellent as Michael Jackson.

Heh.  I was very impressed and completely engulfed in watching the rise of The Jackson 5 and Michael finally going out on his own.  Watching the story between his parents is pretty compelling, too... even though, I'm sure there is a WHOLE lot more to it.  Another masterpiece that I have missed out on because of the media morons.

I think it is funny that years later Angela Basset who plays the mother in this movie plays Tina Turner with Fishburn. I wonder how she compares the 2 performances. If this was a wide release movie and  not a tv mini series  Hilton-Jacobs would of been nominated for a Oscar.

Basset is just ok in this movie. She is completely overwhelmed by Hilton-Jacobs and the people who play Micheal.  And she is really a annoying character. She sits around and cries when her husband is abusing the kids. I am sure if she had left this man years earlier the chldren would of not had been as mess up as they are.  Being that Jermaine co writes this movie it is a interesting portrait he paints of his mother.  Who is a sympathetic character but at the same time a weak mother. Katherine only leaves when she over hears Joe and his girlfriend on the phone, but she stayed when he was beating and abusing the kids. You hear her yelling at Joe every once in a while but she does. It was a interesting scene when she is on the phone with Joe again mad at something and you look around the dinner table and fans are sitting there eatng dinner with the mother and the other kids.  Very weird.

Margret Avery who plays her mother looks more like her sister, then her mother particulary when Katherine is a adult with children.

Another intersting point about Jermaine writing this is the way he portrays his relationship to Hazel Gordy. We all knew at the time it had nothing to do with love and she was considered a very plain looking woman. It was a joke and a very opportunistic move on his part.  But in this movie you would of thought this was Romeo and Juliet romance. I have to respect that Jermaine did not tear her down. Good for him.

 The various performers playing the Jacksons through the years were very good but none had much to do except the the actors who played Michael who were very good. The one who played him as a adult was spot on, it was very tragic that he died soon after the movie was made. To me the one who played the second to last Michael really looked and moved like him when he was on the stage. Remember this movie is suppose to be about the original Jacksons, the ones in the hall of fame, the ones that blew the socks off of everyone when they first came on the scene, not Janet, who I thnk Michael sings for, I swear.

I like the way they touch on the various rivals of the Jackson Five like the Osmonds. There a few of them like the Sylvers.  None of these rivals came close to Michael. The had a few hits but that was about it.

I remember Michael when he first came on the scene. We are the same age. There has never been anyone who was like him as a child and teenage performer. And no one since.  Even now I am amazed when I see him in old footage and hear his voice. I cry looking at them because of how sad it is to see how he has fallen in the last 15 years. Prince and him are the same age look at Prince now and look at Michael. A sad story. This movie will show you when he was in his prime and it does a good job of it.",1177718400,,3205,4.143548387096774

497536,4,6302681049,"Joe Jackson had dreams as a young man.  He wanted to be a boxer and musician and go to California.  But he got his girlfriend, Katherine, pregnant and he did the honorable thing--he married her.  He tabled his dreams for his family, working in the steel mills of Gary, Indiana, to put foood on the table.  A religious and principled man (the Jacksons were Jehovah Witnesses), he took family seriously and since he didn't believe in birth control or abortion, he had a lot of kids--9 altogether.  On occasion he was brutal--but if any of you are parents, can you imagine how brutal you might get having 10 people depending on you?

Gossip and badmouthing from the kids paint Joe Jackson as a tyrant--and he may have some very large flaws--but one thing is very clear:  he never abandoned his family.  He transformed his dreams to fit the talent of his children and took all of them out of a probable bleak destiny in Gary to the height of world recognition.  I'm amazed by that, frankly.

This movie is definitely worth watching for many reasons.  Though poor, this was a close knit family smothered in love and support by both parents.  Angela Bassett is touching as usual, all mothery and love, but able to stand up to Joe when he gets a little too tough with the boys. Her children are still devoted to her.  Lawrence Tillman as Joe Jackson gives a multi-dimensioned father.  Proud of his children, a stern taskmaster, a visionary--as much a visionary as Berry Gordy--a family man who is complex and flawed.  I loved the scene at the Apollo where he embraces Michael and gets off to his children performing Twist and Shout.  We also see the music business during the Motown Age and the inner workings of Berry Gordy's Motown at the height of its success.  Now Billy Dee Williams gives Gordy way too much sex appeal...but I enjoyed the charm anyway.

The boy who played preteen Michael was simply adorable and highly talented as singer and dancer.  His singing of Kansas City and Twist and Shout in the first half had me moving.  The second half, when the family is breaking up as Michael's star ascends was somewhat painful.  The father loses control over his creation, Hollywood values destroy family unity, Katherine suffers from empty nest.  But what an achievement.

I loved the fact that this is 4 hours long--it's like a good book you don't want to end.  No doubt this story will be retold in fuller detail, but I suspect that story would take 8 hours.  I'm looking forward to it.",1170892800,6,2488,4.612756264236902

497715,4,6302681049,"I love this movie.  Finally, a soul story movie that does not include Leon or Jennifer Lewis (playing someones mother).  It shows great choice of castings such as Lawerence Hilton Jacobs as Joe, Angela Bassett as Katherine, Jason Weaver as Michael age 8-15, future star Terrence Howard as final casting of Jackie, Vanessa Williams as Suzzane Depass and two unknown actors that potrayed final castings of Tito and Michael (although that one seemed less whimpy and less feminine compared to the real Michael Jackson).  Some of the order of events seemed to be a bit out of place and it looked as though that Jermaine (co writer of the story) tried to make Tito, Marlon, and Michael look bad (always getting beat and acting like a baby for the later), but I still watch the tape (when I taped it on WABC in 1996) over and over again because it is a great movie.  - No movie can be perfect, but this is magic!!!!",1142121600,2,908,4.5182926829268295

I enjoyed this movie and I am very happy that you had this movie available in stock and still exist, even though the  movie came out in 1992! I was 12 years old when The Jacksons - An American Dream came out and that is when I first saw the movie then. The people in the movie kind of remind me of my family except for being a musical group. The actor, Wylie Draper (dead), who plays the 3rd Micheal Jackson at the end of the movie kind of reminds me of my friend, Christopher.  It's weird, but amazing to me how a dead star can suddenly look like someone I know. It must be fate or recarnination. I will never know, I'm just glad it happen to me! .

497719,5,6302681049,This is an EXCELLENT MOVIE that I think is fair to the whole Jackson 5 experience. The actors of all ages are absolutely dynamite. Any one who is fan of Michael Jackson or the Jackson 5 has to have this in their collection.,1124496000,,223,4.209302325581396
497860,4,6302681049,"""The Jacksons - An American Dream"" was very enjoyable to watch, although those of us who grew up with the Jackson 5 know that there was a LOT left out and there were several inaccuracies in the script. But perhaps the things that were hinted at or weren't mentioned at all in the movie is what made the biggest impression. It isn't necessary to get into all of the scenarios that were missed, but I will say this movie did well to give you a very general understanding of just what Michael, Marlon, Jermaine, Tito, Jackie, and later on, Randy Jackson went through on the road to fame and during the height of their popularity. IMO, the reason Papa Joe Jackson (played excellently by Lawrence Hilton-Jacobs) worked his kids so hard is because he himself was an unsuccessful musician, and wanted a better future for them. He didn't want them to have to struggle like he did. Now I absolutely do not condone the harsh methods he used to discipline his children - but I do understand it.

Now on to the movie...it covers from the period of the late 1940s to 1984. The beginning, which concentrates on the life of the young Katherine growing up in Chicago, drags a bit. But it's after the kids are born when the story starts to get interesting. Angela Bassett is effective in her role as the family matriarch, Katherine Jackson, but I've seen Angela in much stronger roles and being cast as the long-suffering wife of Joe Jackson didn't really suit her. But given the material she had to work with, she did a fine job.

The rest of the cast was alright - worth noting are Billy Dee Williams as Motown founder Berry Gordy; Vanessa L. Williams as Berry's protege and assistant Suzanne dePasse; Bumper Robinson and Terence Howard, who both played oldest brother Jackie but at different ages; and the son of the real Jermaine Jackson, Jermaine II, playing his father as a teenager - however, who had the horrendous idea of casting Holly Robinson as Diana Ross?! Ugh. She was totally unconvincing and almost laughable. The kids, who were mostly unknowns, were pretty much on point, especially the talented Jason Weaver as the pre-teen Michael (he gives a dead-on performance in this role); the late Wylie Draper, who played the adult Michael; and the actor who portrayed the adult Jermaine, Colin Steele. Their performances were among the best in the film.

I would like to address a couple of remarks that some previous reviewers brought up: WHEN was it implied that Joe Jackson was having an affair with Suzanne dePasse? That must be something I missed, because nothing like that was ever even hinted at. Joe did have a mistress, but it was NOT Ms. dePasse. Also, this was supposed to be the story of the Jackson 5, NOT Janet or Latoya Jackson, so this is why they were barely mentioned...and that suited me just fine. Overall, this is a good film to sit back and enjoy on a Sunday afternoon, although there were parts that were a bit corny, like the constant mention of getting to California being the measure of success in Joe and Katherine's eyes. But Jackson fans are sure to love it and will definitely want to make it part of their collection.",1123372800,55,3141,4.625448028673835

497867,5,6302681049,"I remember seeing this movie being advertised on ABC a few years ago, and then, I didn't want to see it. I had heard so many things about Joseph Jackson and what a horrible person he was, I wasn't sure if I could take seeing him being portrayed. I don't know what made me change my mind, but I watched the whole thing and ended up recording it! The whole movie is great, and Lawrence Hilton Jacobs does a very believable job of portraying Joseph, as does Angela Bassett for Katherine. Some very cute parts are in the movie, such as the pillow fights in the hotel, and the part where Michael and Marlon are huddled under the bed while Jermaine has a visitor in the room with him. I was partial to Jason Weaver, but even more to the adult Jermaine. I can't pick and choose who were the best in this movie, because all parts were played very well.
Some parts, however, I'm not sure on their accuracy. For example, the part where it's insinuated that Joseph was having an affair with Suzanne DePasse? Did that really happen or was it added for dramatic purposes? The movie never quite touced on Michael's skin disorder, either. He was concerned about what looked like pimples on his face, and then that was it.
For me, the highlight of the entire movie was at the end when they performed ""The Love You Save"", from what I assume was their Victory Tour. (Forgive me if this is wrong) Did they lip-sync this?! It was wonderful! Absolutely amazing. I can't tell you how many times I watched and re-watched the last performance. Any parts with Jason Weaver singing were wonderful too.

7829501,5,6302681049,"This Jackson telling has what many of the other Jackson related movies do not have  heart, and actual Jackson music! This made for TV movie is over 25 years old and still holds up. The production value is good (including location shooting), the casting is good, and Jackson music is abundant.

Angela Bassett is particularly good as mother Jackson. Her portrayal of Kathrine Jackson captures her demeanor and physical idiosyncrasies (Bassestt was very busy at this point in her career, as she would go on to portray Tina Turner. Talk about a versatile actress!). Lawrence-Hilton Jacobs is also good as Joe Jackson. Though he may not look a lot like Joseph, Jacobs maintained a consistent level of intensity that characterized the elder Jackson. Other good casting choices include Billy Dee Williams as Motown founder Berry Gordy, and Venessa Williams as Motown executive Suzanne de Passe. Further kudos need to be given to the casting director and all the great young people cast as the Jackson siblings. The boys and young men, especially, did outstanding jobs lip syncing the songs and learning all the dance moves. The performance sequences were very convincing. Speaking of which, the soundtrack includes many of their early hits as the Jackson 5, up to Michaels premiere of Billie Jean.

The public may only know of the Jacksons through the unfortunate events that plagued Michael as an adult. What the public forgets is that the Jacksons were a blue collar, lower-middle class family that had a dream, worked a plan, and became very successful. Since the airing of this movie (1992) much has happened to the family. If the same care and effort were mustered, a sequel would be every bit as entertaining and informative.
