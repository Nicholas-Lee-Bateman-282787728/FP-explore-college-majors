About 6 months ago I completed Liz Franklin's Yoga in Chairs teacher training program. I am now teaching yoga to seniors and others with health and mobility limitations using the techniques featured on this DVD. I regularly recommend this DVD to my students as a supplement to our weekly classes.

The sequence on this DVD is very gentle and Liz's instructions are clear. The DVD cover subtitles it as ""Intermediate Level"". I personally don't feel that anyone needs prior yoga experience in order to benefit from the DVD. Liz doesn't mention ""wheelchair"" on this DVD, but I believe that most of the exercises would be accessible even to someone in a wheelchair.

It is difficult for a shopper reading the Amazon descriptions to decide which of the three DVDs in this series would be most appropriate for them. I suggest that all three DVDs be bundled into one set and sold as such.",1224547200,,1054,5.540372670807454
