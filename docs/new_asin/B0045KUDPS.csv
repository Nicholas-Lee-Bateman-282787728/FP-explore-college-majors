8416769,3,B0045KUDPS,"Even though I purchased ""Video Games Live [Blu-ray]"" I ended up getting ""Video Games Live: Level 2 [Blu-Ray + DVD Combo]"" instead. I didn't really complain because I was going to buy that anyway, but if you already have, stay clear of this one.",1340496000,4,244,4.568181818181818
8416770,3,B0045KUDPS,"This appears to be a listing for what is essentially the 'souvenier' version sold at the concert itself; and I happen to have one in my personal collection.  The one I have at home does not say 'Level 2'.  And it does not include the DVD; it's Blu-ray only.

However, it appears to have the same content as the 'Level 2' product, which I'm guessing is the official retail release of the PBS special.

That being said, my review of said content is that it is OK.  Fun to watch, to be sure, but it doesn't really capture what it's like to be at one of the shows as well as it could have.  Would have been better to just record the show, from start to finish, without segments added in breaking up the flow.",1306368000,3,704,4.177777777777778
8416771,1,B0045KUDPS,"This product is not legit. It states that Video Games Live is the first Blu-Ray of Video Games Live. This Blu-Ray was never legitimately made. The only Blu-Ray of Video Games Live is has Level 2 on it. Which just now becaming available. Please follow the link to read the actual review and words from Tommy Tollerico.
