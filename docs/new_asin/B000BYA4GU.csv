8093981,5,B000BYA4GU,"I saw this several years ago when it ran on HBO as well. Goldblum is as helplessly sexy as ever and the story is both silly and clever at the same time, offering an interesting peek into the criminal world of art forgery. Just ordered the dvd. Can't wait to see it again.",1387670400,,271,4.132075471698113
8093982,5,B000BYA4GU,"I first discovered this little film on HBO back in the summer of 1990, and wondered for the past few years if it would ever be on DVD. Its an original cable tv production about an art forger, played by Goldblum, who gets set up by his lover and then sent away to prison; couple of years later by fate, they meet again, this time she wants his help in creating the ultimate forgery, and perhaps rekindle this past relationship. Throw in a devious FBI agent, a crime boss, two wacko henchmen, plus Goldblums trademark befuddlement and quirky charm, and you got a fun little comedy. A great guilty pleasure.",1233100800,13,604,4.5
8093983,4,B000BYA4GU,"I also think this movie is wonderful, great cat and mouse game. Twisting plot, unique and funny characters, and the soundtrack is the best. I can't wait for this film to be put on DVD, and for the soundtrack to be out on CD. I have been wanting this soundtrack since the first moment I saw the film years ago on HBO. Pleeease do me the favor and make an available soundtrack for this movie!",1104537600,4,390,4.213333333333333
8093984,5,B000BYA4GU,"This offbeat comedy opens with an infectious fusion piece, some of the best original music for a movie I have heard.
The movie is set in Paris and LA and revolves around Jeff Goldblum's character, an art fraud professional. In summary, he is apprehended by the french police for fraud and his girlfriend conveniently gets away just in time. This leaves Goldblum pondering a relationship he thought he could trust in. His girlfriend gets involved with a major crime lord in LA, and when Goldblum is released from prison she coerces him into stealing and reproducing a cherished painting belonging to her new boyfriend. Goldblum plays a lovable sucker who is reeled in by Thomas' character, but shows good form in the end. And the end is appropriately ambiguous. Rather than get bogged down in the plot (which in some ways is pretty light), enjoy the atmosphere this quirky movie invokes. One not to be missed if you are a Goldblum fan.",999388800,6,934,4.771604938271605
