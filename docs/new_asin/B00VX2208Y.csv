7113098,5,B00VX2208Y,"5 stars for the source material, and kudos to Shout Factory! for preserving 3 more Comedy Central Episodes.  The fourth (Agent of H.A.R.M.) is one of the least repeated episodes of the Sci Fi Channel era.

All of these are worth seeing again after many years, but I particularly enjoy ""Teenage Crime Wave.""  It is a poorly shot, murky, and badly acted ripoff of the noir classic ""Gun Crazy"" (1950, dir: Joseph H. Lewis).

See the classic first, then pop in experiment 522 ""Teenage Crime Wave"" to see just how badly the concept can be realized.

The host segments include the classic ""Doughy Guy"" montage (thanks William Frawley), and the invention exchange includes the infamous ""Mace Mousse,"" which you do NOT want in your hair.

It is of course, recommended!",1435363200,7,760,4.8076923076923075

7113101,5,B00VX2208Y,"This set features three films from the Comedy Central era of the show and one from the Sci-Fi Channel. Show creator Joel Hodgson hosts two episodes and head writer Mike Nelson hosts two as well.

307- DADDY-O with short: ALPHABET ANTICS
This 1958 black-and-white film stars Dick Contino, Sandra Giles, Bruno VeSota. A drag race between part-time truck driver and singer ""Daddy-O"" Phil (Contino) and Jana (Giles) results in Phil losing his license. His new job at a night club turns out to be about more than just singing, his sinister new boss (VeSota) operates a drug ring. Phil and Jana team up to uncover the truth and take the bad guys down. There's a musical number in the movie during which Phil wears he pants very high and his belt buckle off center. In classic MST3K fashion, these two little oddities are turned into an entire hilarious musical host segment as Joel and the 'Bots perform ""Hike Your Pants Up"". It's worth watching for that alone, but it's a great episode from beginning to end. The 1951 short, ""Alphabet Antics"", was aimed at very young children and the riffing throughout that is also terrific.

313- EARTH VS. THE SPIDER with short: USING YOUR VOICE
This episode also uses a 1958 black-and-white film, but this one is a classic Bert I. Gordon creature-on-the-loose film about a giant spider. A young girl's father fails to come home one night so she goes searching for him in a cavern with the help of her boyfriend. They discover the giant spider, flee, and then return with the sheriff and others to the cave and kill the giant spider, or so everyone thinks. The spider is apparently merely stunned and so storing it in the school gymnasium turns out to be a really bad idea when it wakes up during a garage band rehearsal and goes on a rampage through the town. This fantastic riffing on the fun monster film is preceded by one of the best and most referenced shorts ever used on MST3K, Using Your Voice, made in 1950. This is the famous ""lip and tongue action"" short from Centron that was still getting call-back jokes made about it in MST3K episodes far down the road and it is not to be missed. Another great episode from beginning to end.

522- TEEN-AGE CRIME WAVE
A fairly dark 1955 black-and-white film about juvenile delinquency seemingly meant to scare people about that growing problem. It probably worked at least a little bit, because there's little to like about this film or the characters in it. A girl is falsely convicted of being an accessory to a robbery, then gets sprung from jail with the real culprit by the latter's evil boyfriend. The two criminals take the innocent girl with them to a farmhouse where they hide from the police and terrorize the family within. Sounds like fun, doesn't it? It's also really slow during the middle portion. The riffing is okay while the host segments do brighten the whole thing up at least a little bit. Mentos commercials were all over Comedy Central at the time this aired so there's a host segment making fun of those spots. It's a fair episode.

815- AGENT FOR H.A.R.M.
Made in 1966, this is the only color film in this collection. A bland secret agent in a yellow cardigan has to protect a scientist who has created a deadly biological agent. Meanwhile, the secret agent becomes romantically involved with the scientist's young, sexy niece. It's another cheap James Bond wannabe film from a period filled with bad Bond imitations. This one is duller and sillier than a lot of them. The show's host segments all tie together as Mike Nelson is put on trial for ""crimes against the universe"" and those are the standout elements of this episode. This is the first episode directed by Mike Nelson and the first episode where Pat Brantseg does the voice of Gypsy. It's a fair, but fun episode.

7113121,5,B00VX2208Y,"""Mystery Science Theater 3000: XXIII"" is another great collection from Shout Factory. While it isn't my favorite collection, it's still a winner with diverse episodes from both Joel and Mike. I have to admit that the black and white Juvenile Delinquent (JD) movies aren't my favorites, and here the JD intersection with low budget mobsters in ""Daddy-O"" is my least favorite of the set. The riffs are good, but the underlying material is boring: starring famous accordionist Dick ""Lady of Spain"" Contino (who doesn't play his accordion, but does sing) as a hero truck driver turned drug runner turned police informant, the film delivers some great laughs (particularly noteworthy is the examination of how amazingly high Contino wears his pants). ""Teen-Age Crime Wave"" is a more straightforward JD film that I actually enjoyed more; Tommy Cook and Molly McCart are the delinquents in question, and they are over-the-top with jumpy teenage angst. The film ends in tears, of course, with Cook really chewing the scenery in one of the most depressingly overblown conclusions of any film of the genre. The film is fast paced and I found it to be a more interesting underlying film than ""Daddy-O"".

""Earth vs. The Spider"" is typical Bert I. Gordon giant monster fare with some really old teenagers in love set against a ridiculous huge arachnid. I always love when MST3K takes on big dumb monsters, and here the results are fantastic. It's equal parts entertaining and ridiculous, which makes for a perfectly balanced episode. ""Agent For H.A.R.M."" is a science fiction meets cold war spy thriller that was clearly influenced by the Bond films, though it is hilariously off the mark. Where any James Bond film would have a well-defined supervillain and an amazing master plan, here a lunatic is threatening the US food supply with alien spores. The film has less action than ""Daddy-O"", a couple of clunky uncool gadgets, and a hero with a gray strip down his hair giving the impression more of an impassioned skunk than a debonair ladies' man. Highlighted are ridiculous plot twists and some severely bad acting, making it a favorite of the set. And don't dare ask what ""H.A.R.M."" stands for!

Much like other offerings, Shout has added a lot of valuable extras for each of the films, like the ""MST Hour"" wraps, and a mini-documentary on some aspect of each movie: ""Film it Again Sam: The Katzman Chronicles"" was my favorite, particularly the references to ""The Giant Claw"" a film that should have been an MST3K episode if any movie ever deserved it. This is a great set and I have no reservations about giving it five stars!",1440979200,5,2618,4.8941441441441444

7113125,5,B00VX2208Y,"I love watching MST3K.  All the box sets have stinkers contained in them - and number XXXIII (that's number 33 for those roman numeral challenged) is no exception.

Daddy-O.  What style.  What fashion.  What script.  What acting.  No, seriously, what style?  What fashion?  What script?  What acting?

Earth vs the Spider.  I was pulling for the spider.

Teen-age Crime Wave.  I cannot even begin to describe how bad this one is.  Open the windows and air the place out while watching this.

Agent for H.A.R.M.  More like agent for despair.

I look at all the MST3 movies an ask:  Who thought these things were a good idea?  Well, someone did.  Someone was wrong.

Thankfully, we have the crew of the SOL to help get us over these turds.  The riffs are pretty much spot on.  The skits are hilarious.  The shorts are stupid funny - where DO they get them from?  And the extras are informative.

So, pick your poison - relax and prepare for laughter!

7113127,5,B00VX2208Y,"Back in the dark days before Mystery Science Theater 3000 hadn't been released on DVD, I never thought I'd live to see thirty-three volumes of MST3K movies released.  Joel Hodgson leads off this volume with the swinging ""Daddy-O,"" starring singer and accordion player Dick Contino.  Dick doesn't play the accordion but does show off his acting chops in this movie.  This juvenile delinquent flick features hard rockin' thrills, hot roddin' spills, and music by John Williams.  Yes, that John Williams!  Its pretty standard fare, and great fodder for riffs.  Mike hosts the other juvenile delinquent film, ""Teen-Age Crime Wave.""  Tommy Cook manages to shoot and kill a cop who is driving his criminal girlfriend, and another young girl who mistakenly got mixed up with them, to prison.  The trio hold up in a farmhouse with an elderly couple, who is later joined by their son, for a fun-filled Thanksgiving.  The climax of the movie was filmed on location at the Griffith Observatory in Los Angeles.  This turkey of a movie will surely become a Thanksgiving tradition in my household.  (And  don't call me Shirley!)

Joel hosts the sci-fi classic ""Earth Vs. The Spider,"" which was produced by the great Bert I. Gordon.  In case the viewer wasn't aware of that, there's a scene at a theater that's showing ""Attack Of The Puppet People,"" with coming attractions for ""The Amazing Colossal Man,"" both of which were produced by Bert I. Gordon.  The latter movie appeared on Mystery Science Theater, and was released on VHS video by Rhino in 1996.  Due to copyright problems, ""The Amazing Colossal Man"" has never been released on DVD.  Since I suffer from arachnophobia, I will just say that the final score of this movie is Earth 1, giant spider 0.  Last and maybe least is ""Agent For H.A.R.M.,"" hosted by Mike.  Peter Mark Richman stars as secret agent Adam Chance, who works for Human Aetiological Relations Machine (H.A.R.M.).  The movie makes about as much sense as the name of the agency he works for.  Eye candy is provided by Barbara Bouchet as Ava Vestok, who spends most of the movie wearing a bikini.  Described as a sci-spy-fi thriller, it involves extraterrestrial spores that turn flesh into a green fungus that kills their victims.  Keeping the viewers' brains from turning into mush are the host segments with Mike Nelson, who is in an intergalactic courtroom, on trial for being a planet destroyer.  I hope I live long enough to see all of the remaining MST3K movies released on DVD, or at least before my brain turns into mush!",1438732800,2,2538,4.835266821345708

8711488,5,B00VX2208Y,"MST3K compilation XXXIII (2015) holds a solid four movies; if you're expecting the very bottom-of-the-barrel features like EEGAH!, or THE CRAWLING TERROR, you won't find them here.  Even so, the movies do fall into recognizable sub-genres and as such are fairly representative of their kind, to wit --

THE MOVIE WITH A BEATNIK TITLE THAT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH BEATNIKS:
DADDY-O (1958).  Star Dick Contino developed a kind of second career in youth-oriented movies after a promising start as an accordionist.  This one (MST episode no. 307) and Girls Town (no. 601) are probably his two best.  Here he gets involved in drag-racing, loses his license, then to redeem himself needs to infiltrate a narcotics gang headed by the local honcho (played by portly actor Bruno VeSota, a kind of poor mans Sydney Greenstreet / William Conrad / Victor Buono).  Really the most beat thing about this movie is its crazy, mixed-up plot, but Joel and the bots have fun sending it up, tossing references both ancient and modern (1950s big-car reviews, Joe Cocker) and initiating a riff that theyd repeat in later episodes until Joel put his foot down and forbade it:  whistling the theme music to the NBC MYSTERY MOVIE when a flashlight shines at the camera.  John Williams first movie soundtrack.  Short subject:  Alphabet Antics.  Overall this show is fun and memorable, worth a second viewing.

THE BIG-SCARY-SOMETHING THREATENS IDYLLIC AMERICAN TOWN MOVIE:
EARTH VS. THE SPIDER (also known as The Spider), 1958, episode 313.  Short Subject:  Speech: Using Your Voice, whose 1950 narrator unwittingly used the term plenty of lip-and-tongue action"" to assure good speech, ensuring hilarity among Misties for years to come.  SPIDER is about as middle-of-the-road as Fifties creature features get.  While on his way home with his daughters birthday present, a motorist is wrecked and devoured (or drained) by an enormous spider.  Concerned, the teenaged daughter and her equally teenaged boyfriend set out to see whats what and get trapped in the spiders cavern.  Lots of confusion and terror until things are finally sorted out.  Funniest example of cheesy production values:  The spider seems to go from black to grey as the movie progresses.  Strangest omission:  Nobody told the fleeing schoolchildren to scream, so they stampede in silence.  Joel demonstrates his flair for voicing monsters:  Hey, come back! Im actually beneficial. I eat harmful household pests. Jim Morrison drank my venom, and so on.  Look fast for Hank Patterson (Arnold Ziffels father on GREEN ACRES) as the school janitor.  Well worth a repeat viewing.

THE TWENTYSOMETHING TEEN CRIME MOVIE:  TEEN-AGE CRIME WAVE, 1955, episode 522.  Well, it isn't REBEL WITHOUT A CAUSE, but its watchable.  Gritty Terry (Molly McCart) is rounded up for trying to hustle a bar patron; through no fault of her own her demure friend Jane (Sue England) is arrested, too. Both are headed for reform school when Terry's psychotic boyfriend Mike (Tommy Cook) springs them. They flee into the country and hole up in a remote farmhouse, taking hostage the owners.  Most hostage movies have some slow-moving patches, and this is no exception.  Fortunately, Mike and the bots do a fine job of stepping on lines to comic effect:

(Molly): You might as well know we have a murder rap against us, so we have nothing to lose.  -- (Servo, speaking for Mother): Well, I just put up some peach preserves.
 - - -
(Molly):  I don't want to have any blasting in the house.  -- (Mike, speaking for Father): Cant we just have a normal Thanksgiving where we drink and don't talk to each other?
This ones not my favorite Mistie movie, but its solid enough.  And finally:

THE FAILED MADE-FOR-TV SERIES PILOT MOVIE:  AGENT FROM H.A.R.M., episode 815.
From Universal, an acronym sort-of-secret-agent movie (1967) that takes off from both the Bond franchise and THE MAN FROM U.N.C.L.E., making this a derivative of a derivative.  Its a pretty bad movie; worse even than SAN FRANCISCO INTERNATIONAL, almost as bad as STRANDED IN SPACE. Wendell Corey is probably the best-known actor here and was given Guest Star status.  This is the only movie of the four in color:  good, solid, made-for-TV color.  Its everything else that is shaky.  The McGuffin is a fungus that maims or disfigures its victims in a trice, but whats really noticeable are the lackluster chases among vigorous musical interludes and the producers assumption that labeling buildings on the bad side of Malibu in Spanish (there WAS a bad side back then) would convince the audience they were in Mexico.  There is a very pretty girl, though (Barbara Bouchet), and she shows up in a bikini often.  Mike and the bots throw everything at this one, and it generally (not always) sticks.  Expect LOTS of television references, also the sung James Bond theme (Da-Da DA-daah!).  The weakest show of the four, Id say.  On the whole, though, I consider this compilation well worth owning.
