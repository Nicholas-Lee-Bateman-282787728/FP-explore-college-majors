7903143,3,B000003K9B,"The Maquis 'war' against the Cardassian's has hit a brick wall now the Dominion are in league with Dukat, as such the Jem'hadar have been sent in  to the DMZ (the area of space where the Maquis operate) and wiped out most  of the rebel bases. But in one last ditch attempt by the Maquis to strike a  devasting blow to their most hated enemies they have activated several  cloaked missles that are headed for Cardassian targets. Sisko and Starfleet  can't let this happen (in that order) and Commander Eddington, the former  leader of the Maquis now in a Federation prison, is called upon to find  these missiles and help destroy them before they reach their target.  Bearing in mind Eddington and Sisko HATE each other the two set off in a  shuttle together and attempt to stop the Maquis plan. When Sisko realises  that the missiles do not exist he is stuck in the middle of the DMZ, with  Eddington, and both are surrounded by Jem'hadar. A great episode that is  the sequel to For the Uniform.",966729600,3,995,4.52808988764045
