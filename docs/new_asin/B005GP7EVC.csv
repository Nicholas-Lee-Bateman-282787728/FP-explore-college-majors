4692464,5,B005GP7EVC,"A friend of mine told me about this series & said she really enjoyed it. When Amazon offered the whole series for slightly more than the cost of one season, I took a chance and bought the whole series. My friend was right, this is a very enjoyable series. I was rather sorry they got rid of some of the characters and brought in new ones, but I guess they were just trying to keep it fresh. Wish there had been more shows. All in all, lots of fun, light drama.",1330819200,3,460,4.065934065934066
4692465,4,B005GP7EVC,"If you are looking at this I assume you are already familiar with the Pie In The Sky series and appreciate what a witty and brilliantly written (and performed) work it is.  The only reason that I did not give this set five stars is because it comes without a listing of episodes.  Not on the box, not on the individual series cases, nor on the DVDs themselves.  If you want to play a specific episode, you will have to go a hunting for it (hopefully without Freddy Fisher!) or take the time, as I did, to create your own directory.

Don't let that stop you from buying the set, though.  It really is first rate entertainment.",1329609600,36,625,4.3076923076923075

4692467,5,B005GP7EVC,"What a fun series to watch.  I initially watched them through Netflix and I enjoyed them so much, I am going to buy my own set.  I'd watch them again and again.  I like that the writers don't provide too many details. I also feel that the writer's left some of the script to our imagination; you may not see how Henry Crabbe handled a situation at the end, but we have gotten to know Henry and we know that he does the right thing, even when it is difficult.  I like that the writer's have respected the fact that adults are watching and we don't have to be told what the right thing is. I missed seeing Margaret in Series 5.",1326067200,3,625,4.098360655737705
4692468,5,B005GP7EVC,"I am really enjoying this complete collection- Series of 5 DVD's

4692469,5,B005GP7EVC,"As a farmboy in my past, the chicken coop is a great plot element.  It's unseen in any other drama or detective program to my knowledge.  Unique as is so much of Pie In The Sky.

Just plain full of surprises.  I very rarely predict events in the plot.

Even has a men's bathroom urinal scene which seems to be a Brit specialty in cinema productions for the tele.

Characters aplenty.  Very little terrible violence and very few morgue scenes.  Not Indy Jones nor tough punch-their-lights-out coppers or crooks.

Other comments give details so please read them but no spoilers here, sorry.

Plenty of one liners well timed and spoken with skill.  Brit irony bursting out wonderfully.  Is it a comedy, a soap, a whodunnit, or all of it?  Love it.

At this price it is the steal of steals in daylight robbery in tele videos.  Some forty episodes, over 32 hours, a few tic-tocs short of 2000 minutes for this price?  Eh?  Sound and image are very very good and so is the packaging.  Bloody unbelievable bargain says I humble as can be.

EDIT ----PRICE HAS SHOT UP SINCE I MADE MY FIRST POST.

Cambridge is quite the partner, beautiful, perfectly timings in speech, a delight, I really love her.  What a dream doll.

edit: Oops, problem has appeared.  Series 2 Vol 2 (disc 2) has a very large crack in it and it is not playable.  All other discs appear ok.  It will take some time to verify all of the others are playable.  I'm trying to figure out the Amazon system of replacement.

Sad.  I've not had a defective disc in years of movie purchases from Amazon.",1323907200,25,1555,4.457142857142857
4692470,5,B005GP7EVC,"As I stated in my Amazon UK review, I originally ordered a region free DVD player so I could get this series! Now it is available in the USA, AND with sub-titles for us folk who have difficulty with English accents. (Why can't the English learn to speak...?)

Seriously, this is a refreshing series and I fully and whole-heartedly(and stomachly) agree with the previous reviewers. This splendid series makes you want to open a specialty restaurant, solve a crime and raise chickens all at once!  If you read this while Amazon is giving a 64% discount and do not buy this set- then shame on you!

Terrific cast! Is anyone more adorable than Richard Griffiths? I THINK NOT!
And Maggie Steed and everybody else is just wonderful. Lightweight fun and worth watching over and over again. Make sure you have some tasty snacks on hand.

4692471,5,B005GP7EVC,"While watching Doc Martin DVDs my husband and I saw the ad for the ""Pie in the Sky"" series.  Without having seen even one episode we took a chance and bought this collection.  At this point in time we've watched approximately 10 of the episodes and are completely smitten with Henry, Margaret and the rest of the cast.  Wonderful characters and plots.  I now have a fantasy of having my own chicken coop, complete with music loving hens, in my backyard.",1323388800,82,453,4.555555555555555
4692472,5,B005GP7EVC,"The twist of discovering crimes while being chef at his restaurant Pie In The Sky, brings a fresh new/delicious plot concept. Perhaps 5 season of DI Henry Crabbe (Richard Griffiths-`Harry Potter') is not enough. But beware, DVDs come with NO recipes. Maggie Steed (`Clatterford') is wife Margaret and prominent, often getting involved in Henry's cases. Malcolm Sinclair as ACC Fisher, always in Crabbe's face, never allows Crabbe to retire. Nick Raggett (Henderson the restaurant's veggie grower and kitchen help) & Nicholas Lamont (Chef Gary) are well done, excuse the food pun. DS Sophia Cambridge (Bella Enahoro) is Crabbe's assigned aide in crime fighting, and beautiful waitress Nicola (Samantha Womack-""EastEnders"") is the best looking dish in the restaurant. Guest stars too, like Michael Kitchen (`Foyle's War') to mention only one of many.

All 40 episodes have SUBTITLES and multiple plots with crime and restaurant action. Sit back and enjoy the humor, detective work, characters, and interaction. The cast becomes like family.

A well done, there I go again, copper show, with a rare (oh, sorry) restaurant insider look at life. Fun for the whole family to enjoy together. Watching all those wonderful food dishes passing before your eyes, it is strongly suggested to have snacks handy while viewing. If you have not already purchased any of the series, this is the way to buy, get it all, as you will enjoy all 5 seasons, and wish for more, like ordering dessert after satisfying restaurant dining.

I have posted detailed episode reviews for every episode on the individual season listings. If you'd like to see more detail, I suggest you read those. Thanks for reading this review and enjoy this complete series.",1314057600,142,1727,5.160714285714286

4692487,4,B005GP7EVC,"I just finished the first season. So far it has been entertaining.  It is not a slick production.  Kinda laid back. As for the crime part of the stories, there is not a lot of blood, gore, and awful violent crimes. The crimes are sort of sedate compared to some other crime dramas. However, it is fun.  If you are a high-tone foodie, you'd like it.  I'm just a country girl who likes peasant food, so all Henry's fancy cooking is way above by pay grade.

I particularly like that the series has a beginning, middle and great ending. Know we will watch this through again. Like the gentle humor, and some fantastic one liners. Do know, the transfer isn't the best (it was made 20+ years ago) but more than adequate to be enjoyable, also the sound level is rather high on the first 4 series, so best to adjust volume down. For anyone who likes reading 'cozy mysteries' particularly ones to do with food/cooking, you will enjoy this series very much. Do know, some episodes don't even have a murder.

4692529,5,B005GP7EVC,"This series was really enjoyable, although the changing of the cast in the restaurant and even the police force, was disappointing.  There were lots of times I thought they were going to pull what would be a typical move like someone getting killed--such as a witness, etc., the kind of thing that becomes typical in so much American shows (and apparently in some BBC productions, but that's another story), but then they would go a different direction.  This made it more interesting (less predictable events) and easier to watch because it wasn't so dark and violent.  The only problem, aside from the instability of the cast, is that sometimes it shows food that might make you hungry.  The ongoing story line of the wife unable to appreciate what her husband loves so much is at times poignant and other times funny.  One of the worst villains of the series is, of course, the ambitious police superior.  I had mixed feelings about how the series ended, but don't want to spoil it for anyone who hasn't seen it yet.",1470787200,,1019,4.696629213483146

I decided to give Pie in The Sky a try since the only way, for me, to view it was to purchase it (without signing up for another subscription to a streaming service).  I have watched a handful of the episodes and so far, it has not won me over.  I guess it is not my ""cup of tea"" style of entertainment.

How wonderful to see an enjoyable British detective series which is suitable for the entire family and not full of obscenities, tobacco-drug use, etc.

Somehow, we had missed watching many of the episodes in this great collection, until we've received this set last Christmas. What a great present!

4692605,5,B005GP7EVC,"This is another of those brit series that brings a smile  with every episode.  It harkens back to the days before green screens and computer generated imagery became more important than characters and plot.  Running for 5 BBC seasons in the mid 1990's the collection contains 40 episodes chronicling Detective Inspector Henry Crabbe's futile attempt to extricate himself from the Middleton CID and embark on his life's ambition; running his beloved ""Pie in the Sky"" restaurant full time.  Henry is ready and willing to retire with his pension but his one time mate Freddy has risen to the lofty position of Assistant Chief Constable and has his own selfish reasons for keeping Crabbe on the job. Unlike many brit shows that just disappear without warning, they managed a rather satisfying finale in the 5th season.

Henry is played by the late Richard Griffiths aided by his penny pinching accountant wife Margaret, played by Maggie Steed.  Henry's nemesis is his one time friend ACC Freddy Fisher played to pompous perfection by Malcolm Sinclair.  The rest of the cast includes the restaurant staff and Henry's police subordinates, both of which change more than once during the series' 5 year run.  Additionally the cast includes Leon Henderson, a particularly odd vegetable grower from whom Henry purchases the restaurant's produce, as well as a reliable assortment of veteran brit actors who portray each episode's villains and victims.  And, for the other reviewer who claimed both chefs had the name of Steve, they did not.  The first chef Henry hired was Steve, but the second was named Gary.  Some episodes are better than others, but the heart of the series lies in Henry's little neighborhood bistro where he morphs from daytime copper to top chef.  While the premise is entirely different the series has a similar feel to ""The Last Detective"", so if that series appealed to you this one probably will as well.  To cap it all off, Michael Kitchen (Foyle's War, Out of Africa) portrays criminal mastermind Dudley Hooperman whose miraculous escape from a police trap sets up Henry's long term predicament in episode 1.

Given the production date, don't look for HD video or cutting edge technology.

4692611,5,B005GP7EVC,"""Pie in the Sky"" is a British TV series starring the late Richard Griffiths as a police employee in a London suburb whose real passion is food, and he would much rather be trying out new recipes in the kitchen of his restaurant, Pie in the Sky, than tracking down evildoers. But he's so good at both jobs that he manages to maintain a high success rate whatever he's doing, because he's a smart fellow with a sense of humor and a warm compassion for everyone involved in any case he becomes involved with. Sometimes there's a murder, but milder crimes are more common, such as blackmail and protection rackets and media piracy. Then there are the two nice old ladies who steal from bed & breakfasts but leave their excellent recipe for bread-and-butter pudding. It's a pleasure to be in the company of Mr. Griffiths, and every episode is worth watching at least twice. That's why I decided to buy the DVDs when the single season ended.",1441497600,,935,4.571428571428571

4692663,5,B005GP7EVC,"This has always been popular here, Richard Griffiths was an excellent actor with a quirky twist to his performance. Maggie Steed is excellent as the chef's wife without the exquisite taste buds of her husband, but straight as a dye in her work as an accountant. The staff come and go but the restaurant thrives albeit with inevitable hiccups. Malcolm Sinclair is believably competent as the somewhat nasty police Commander
who always wants Crabbe [Griffiths] at the most inopportune times. We watched the collection in a very short time as it was so absorbing
Well worth the purchase.
Technically the video quality varies from somewhat smeary but watchable to acceptably good. This may be because 2 companies own the rights,and maybe one made an effort and one thought it was good enough. [ N.B.if one company owns rights to film in U.S.A., this does not mean it will automatically own it in Australia for example.]  Sound quality was as expected for a non -remastered unit.

4692690,2,B005GP7EVC,"A British detective drama with a leftist slant.  On the whole, Pie in the Sky tries to be a pleasant little show about crime and food.  The producers, as is often the case, don't seem satisfied with that, and insert left wing political and social messages into the show.  It isn't done in as heavy handed a manner as it is now, PitS was filmed in 95 I think, but someone has  an agenda for sure.  This is too bad, since for me, it ruins my enjoyment.

An aging hippie who wants to preserve some aspect of the culture is portrayed sympathetically.  An upper class conservative type who wants to do the same is a villain.  Criminal activity by left wing characters is excused and even celebrated but not the other way.  Conservative politicians are of course portrayed as evil.

One incident I found a bit disturbing was the show's take on sex and marriage.  Now personally, I don't get at all bent out of shape when I see pre marital sex on the screen.  In fact I don't think much about it.  Pie in the Sky however not only thinks about, they go out of their way to condem people who might practice abstinence before marriage. Worse, in the show, the male has sex with many females, but he loves and respects the girl he is to marry so much, that he wants it to be special.  For this is he portrayed as practically mentally ill.  I have know personally people who did not engage in sex before marriage and the reactions from people of all backrounds, varied.  Some thought it was fine, some a bit odd.  But never did anyone have the kind of shocked disgusted and outraged reaction that the character on Pie in the Sky had.

Besides that, the show is about food.  Back in the mid 90s when it was filmed, the whole pretentious foodie thing was new.  Since then, foodies have multiplied like roaches and the food culture is getting a  bit tiring.  PitS seems a bit old in this regard.

The show itself would only be 3 or 3.5 stars, even if I forgot about the whole left slant.  It doesn't do anything really well.  It certainly is not among the best of the British TV shows.  Just very average.

Confession, I stopped watching this about a third of the way through the series.  It just wasn't worth the time.",1401580800,14,2204,4.348894348894349

4692711,5,B005GP7EVC,"It's old, on a small screen, the technical values are just okay. It's the plot and the novelty of the surroundings that's so different, yet enticing and entirely lovable.
Richard Griffiths is outstanding (he died recently-he's morbidly obese) as the about to retire Chief Inspector kept on the force by a bit of judicious blackmail by his boss, Asst. Commissioner Fisher.
The stories are so out of the ordinary tying up crime with gourmet cooking. The interplay between the kitchen staff at Pie in the Sky is delightful without being artificial. I am not going to name different episodes, but most of them are extraordinary.
Bonus: Bella Enahora's Constable/Sgt. Cambridge. Beyond delightful.
Enjoy this.",1388448000,,704,5.184210526315789
4692712,3,B005GP7EVC,"I was drawn to this series by its high rating here (despite knowing that ratings on Amazon tend to be skewed to the high side); by its stories being touted as mysteries; and by the presence of Richard Griffiths, of whose work I am a fan. Griffiths is very good in this - indeed, he is the primary reason to watch it (Maggie Steed, as his wife, is very good, too). But the stories in the series are pretty lightweight. Indeed, it is difficult to categorize the series: the humorous elements are too low-key to make it a comedy, and the plots that engage the lead character's sleuthing skills are probably too lightweight to satisfy devotees of the mystery/police-procedural genre. The restaurant angle promised to be an offbeat element, but the restaurant was located on a street that always seemed to be deserted; the scenes inside it, especially the ones in the kitchen, lacked the energy of a real restaurant; and the restaurant, for me, was never more than a film set, and an obvious one at that. The series is pleasant enough; Griffiths is worth watching; and the absence of explicit violence will be a welcome respite for many. Three stars: above average but not exceptional.",1388275200,9,1180,4.705314009661835

It was fun in the first season to see the future Inspector Foyle as a master criminal !!

The whole crew at Pie in the Sky, even the changes, made the show.  Cambridge and Freddie Fisher made important contributions to the show. I thought Henderson provided a very good comedic touch.  I confess that I was halfway through the last episode when I did this review.  I managed to see the last episode and Freddie was true to character by throwing Henry under the bus to further his own career which was normal for Freddie Fisher.

His boss has some trumped up charges held against him to keep him on the force to handle special cases. Our detective is a lover of fine quisine and in fact has opened his own restaurant called pie in the sky, thus the name of the show. The story lines are good but a little on the lite side.

I grabbed it up and spent several happy weeks watching the entire series.  It really is a wonderful show.  Richard Griffiths is as brilliant in Pie in the Sky as he was in History Boys and Harry Potter.  The entire cast is great.

The show works well as a police/detective show but I confess, I loved it mostly for the restaurant/cooking aspect.  It ends far too soon.  I do wish it had gone on longer, but five seasons is nothing to sneeze at in British Television.",1374019200,,709,4.343511450381679

4692849,5,B005GP7EVC,"This is a great series with a blend of mystery, humor and good food.  It is very different from the the other British mysteries, some of which are dark and very intense.  It also doesn't have the blood and gore of the criminal dramas of American television.  We only wish that the series had gone on longer.  Would highly recommend this series to anyone who loves British mysteries.",1357948800,3,382,4.573529411764706
4692850,5,B005GP7EVC,"What a wonderful series! The combination of the cooking aspect, and the police work, work well together. I took a chance on this series after viewing it on public television. Well worth the purchase.",1357344000,,199,4.882352941176471

4692853,5,B005GP7EVC,Quirky British detectives TV series.  I love them and this series (with a quirky detective) is no exception.  Well written and great actors.  You even get a receipe.  And I finally found out what Spotted Dick is (a kind of pudding).,1356652800,,232,4.585365853658536
4692854,5,B005GP7EVC,"I had previously seen many of these episodes before, and have found it to be one of the best British mystery series around.  A lot of this is due to Richard Griffiths and the rest of the cast, and to the clever plots and dialogue.  When the price was lowered on the complete series, I jumped at it.  These will be programs I will run over and over, because I think they illustrate what quality fun and serious production values do the raise the bar on most of the ho-hum shows shown on American TV.  I only wish there were more programs in the series, because it is such a treat to see one I haven't enjoyed before.",1356652800,,615,4.186440677966102

4692870,5,B005GP7EVC,"I bought series 1 because I didn't know if I would like them. Wish I had bought the whole collection and saved money. I love these shows. They are funny, suspenseful, and have characters you feel could be your neighbors. You so want Henry to come out on top in both the restaurant and the cases he solves. Also, would love to try some of the pies that make up Pie in the Sky. Wish there were more than 5 Series.",1354579200,,411,4.08641975308642
4692871,5,B005GP7EVC,"This detective series is fun, inventive, humorous, and a sheer delight.  It is recommended for anybody that enjoys cooking and preparing cuisine, while at the same time has an investigative nature.  It is too bad that the series couldn't stay on TV.",1354406400,,249,4.904761904761905

4692873,5,B005GP7EVC,"I read the reviews on here when looking for a series to watch and if it is not on Netflix I try borrowing it from the library.  I only watched the first series so far and the Amazon reviews are right on the mark - it is a wonderful series and now that it is on sale on Amazon I am not passing it up.  I could get the rest of the series from my library but this is something I want to own so my husband (who loves it, too) and I can watch it over and over.  As soon as it went on sale he agreed I should buy it - thank you Amazon!",1353801600,2,529,3.543103448275862

4692876,5,B005GP7EVC,"I didn't think I'd like these shows because the main character is not my type of detective. I've watched all of Midsomer Murders, Law and Order and the Morse series and was used to that certain look that all police characters have. But to my surprise, I absolutely love Henry Crabbe. He's a real sweetheart, tough but with a kind heart.",1351296000,,336,4.524590163934426

It's a shame we have to rely on the British for something wortwhile!",1351123200,,183,4.411764705882353
4692878,5,B005GP7EVC,Pie in the Sky was a great series hated to see it end.  The chef/police officer twist was interesting and seemed to hold it all together,1351123200,,136,4.230769230769231

4692896,5,B005GP7EVC,"We'd run through the entire Midsomer Murder series (loved them!) and, with nothing to watch on regular TV, we took a chance on this series. It was not love at first sight but we became addicted. As always, great acting and great writing. How do the British pull this off so consistently?! We are now desperately looking for another series as entertaining as this was. What makes the British series so superior to ours and why do they discontinue them?!",1348531200,5,452,4.6625
4692897,5,B005GP7EVC,"These programs, Pie in The Sky, are excellent. Henry Crabbe, the unlikely and very large hero, is a reluctant policeman and passionate chef. The detective plots sometimes involve murder but always humour, humanity and life's lessons. The restaurant's portion (ha) is generous and has inspired more than one dish in my own kitchen. Everyone, all ages, should enjoy these.",1339200000,19,370,5.288135593220339
4692898,5,B005GP7EVC,"This is a delightful, well written light comedy/detective series. It was filmed in the late 90's and the story lines remind my husband and I of the ""Monk"" detective series. We watch one every night and have almost made it through the five seasons. Very entertaining.",1336694400,20,266,4.804347826086956
4692899,5,B005GP7EVC,"Pie In The Sky combines the best of British police work with comedy and the delights of the kitchen.  I would kill for a good British Shepards Pie, a'la Henry Crabbe.  I only hope there will be a Series 6!!",1333238400,6,206,4.125

8471926,5,B005GP7EVC,"I found this on pubs. It was a great find. I find it refreshing. It has humor, action and deductions. The only down side is Freddie. He is annoying. He pushes a pencil, abuses his authority, takes advantage of Henry. And probably takes credit for solving the cases.",1525564800,,265,4.541666666666667
