8019202,5,B0001ZIOSY,"As a native son of Seattle, I can testify to the genuine nostalgic goodness of the program on this tape, despite the fact that pretty much all of the things that the interviewees reminisce about were gone before my time (that is, the '70s), things like Bobo the Gorilla (who had been stuffed and was on display in the also now-gone original Museum of History and Industry), the Aqua Theater (in my time a crumbling hulk, fenced-off and filled with broken beer bottles), Sick Stadium (I vaguely recall its demolition sometime when I was in elementary school, I think). That said, this is still a fascinating look (via old photos, home movies and other documentary footage) at a world long gone and never to be retrieved.

Now if only someone would make a 'sequel' about all the stuff that I remember that's not there anymore, like all the cool stuff that used to be at the Seattle Center - the Fun Forest  (remember the Flight to Mars? yeah, as a ride, it seriously sucked, but still...you couldn't beat that come-on exterior), the Bubble-ator in the Food Circus (which also had a roomful of player pianos on the lower level), that crazy miniature golf course with the giant pink elephant wearing eyeglasses and clutching a martini glass in his trunk...ahh, the REAL good old days.",1470096000,,1280,4.709821428571429
