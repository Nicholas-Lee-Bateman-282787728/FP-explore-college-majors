8329069,2,B001O2ZVZW,"The movie begins with a girl (newcomer Ashley Brightwell) in panties and open blouse attempting to find her way out of an industrial building.  There is a ""rave"" flyer on the floor and rave music playing. She doesn't fare well. The movie switches to a nice suburban scene with chiroing birds and distant lawn mowing sounds. Four college girls are inside with various accents. They are going to go to a ""rave"" party tonight to get drunk and meet boys. Thankfully they all have to shower and change beforehand. One of the girls is make-up specialist Mary Avelis in an acting role as C.C. Newcomer Victoria Roberts plays Kayla and the other two girls are Krissy Linville (southern accent)and Rachel Marie Smith.

Meanwhile there are 2 cops on a stake-out discussing ties and basically messing up their lines (I don't think they did second takes). They are waiting for a drug deal to go down. Some of the lines were added after the movie was shot, giving it all the ambiance of a cheap Italian import. The girls follow proper etiquette and take a hit of ecstasy (or ""X"" as they called it) before entering the Rave.

As it turns out they are the only ones there and are locked in. Meanwhile there is a man (Nathan Todaro in his first starring role) in a kitchen chopping vegetables wearing a bloody chef's hat and cheap blue surgeon's gloves (extreme low budget film). How low budget? One of the girls ventures out on her own. A burly guy (burlap face) stabs the girl in the stomach complete with stabbing and blood gurgling sounds. As he drags her limp body away, we discover there is no wound or blood. The cannibal chef tells us he was raised a Buddhist.

The movie was designed to be campy. I love campy. It certainly achieves it. But what we discovered in this movie is that campy, when cold sober, is not always funny. The box claims this was the winner of the 2008 Fright Night Film Festival. I don't want to see the losers.

Nudity, f-bomb, and an apparent off camera rape.",1308268800,,1976,4.523809523809524

8329071,1,B001O2ZVZW,"My gosh.  This has to be one of the worst films I've seen from a technical quality aspect.  From start to finish the camera is totally out of focus...and so are the so-called actors/actresses.  There is nothing worth watching here.  It is so-o-o-o bad.  The dead and mutilated bodies are real people.  Know why?  You can see them breathing after they've been brutally murdered.  The script could have been written by a hip-hop loser.  Every other word out of EVERY actor-actress is fu...!  Closely followed by sh...!  The box claims that this film was the winner of the 2008 Fright Night Film Festival.  If this was the winner, I'd hate to see the losers.  Don't waste your time... the only ""fright"" in this film is that there are stupid people like me that actually spent money on this...$1.99 to be exact...and that, too, was a complete rip-off.",1272672000,,847,4.680272108843537
8329072,5,B001O2ZVZW,"First off, it is a GREAT movie- there is definitely the key elements of a bad movie here, but that is what makes it great!  These movies are awesome to watch and poke fun at, I bet the person who bought this before who gave it one star probably liked the ""Blair Witch Project"" now that was a horrible movie, there wasn't anything even good to make fun of, other than the fact that they showed some girls nostrils, funny camera angle there.

Anyway, this movie in particular is bad... yes.... but the elements of a movie are there, who cares that it had bad acting and bad lighting?  You can't expect a movie that was made for less than 12k to be high quality, or without someone painting their butt blue in some weird independant film.

This is one of those movies you get together and make fun of with your friends, because it is fun to point out the errors or the funny looks on peoples faces.

YOU BAD MOVIE ENJOYING BUFFS MUST WATCH THIS MOVIE!",1264118400,,948,4.303370786516854
8329073,1,B001O2ZVZW,"All the elements of a crappy movie are here (and there are far too many of them these days in this genre) - crappy story, crappy acting, crappy production, i.e. sound, lighting. Bogus ""winner"" of some (most likely) made up ""film festival"" Not scary. Not titillating. Not interesting. Not worth your time.",1256601600,,304,4.865384615384615
