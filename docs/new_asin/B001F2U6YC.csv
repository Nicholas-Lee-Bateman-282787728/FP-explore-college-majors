3561960,4,B001F2U6YC,This is a great anime of Frieza's brother. His name is Coola and not Cooler. This is pretty good anime and the english version isn't that bad like in other DBZ movies.,1295136000,,167,4.25
3561961,5,B001F2U6YC,"This is the 4th and 5th movie of DBZ. It follows the series a little better than the 1st 3 movies, but still not all the way. Its one of my 2 favorite movies of DBZ. Now the picture on the BD version is a tiny bit better than the dvd at the most. The only really reason to get the BD insted of the DVD is the audio is a little better and/or if you are a very sirius Dragonball fan. The reason I give it 5 stars is that it is the best version their is, unless they re animated it which is very unlikly, and the price is not bad for a BD (blu-ray).",1293321600,8,546,3.675213675213675
3561962,4,B001F2U6YC,The blue-Ray version blew me away of the high quality picture and sound i recommend it to all Dragon ball fans !,1261612800,6,112,4.136363636363637
3561963,4,B001F2U6YC,"This is a great DBZ movie release. It comes with both Cooler's Revenge and The Return of Cooler, each on its own disc. The packaging is very nice, and the all aluminum case is awesome. So if I could give the packaging for this release a grade, I would give it a 5/5.

Now for the video/audio. It seems like almost all the reviews for this movie release were all from fans that have seen it and loved it when they first saw it. After just getting this set, I can say that there are a few problems with it. First, the aspect ratio. I can't say this is a problem at all because I guess it really goes by preference. It really is nice to see it in 16:9 aspect ratio and fill up your whole tv, and it looks great. The remastering is really nice. But you will once in a while find yourself slightly annoyed by the fact that someones head is half off the screen. Its not a big problem but when all you can see is there chin, it really starts to annoy you. But all in all it doesn't wreck the movie. Video quality 5/5 Aspect ratio 4/5

But my biggest gripe is only for the american dub with american music. When I first saw Cooler's revenge when it first came out I was so pumped with the sweet music kicking in at the right times. It was so awesome to hear an awesome rock track start right as Goku punches Cooler in the face. But with this remastered release it seems like they screwed up the syncing for the music. Right when it was time for the first music track to start playing timed to one of Cooler's squad bashing Gohan in the back of the head I noticed that the music started about 4 to 5 seconds earlier. I thought it was just how it was supposed to be, but every other track for the rest of the movie started early. This totally wrecks the flow of the movie for me. It's a little hard to explain in a review, but trust me you'll notice the music starting early if you've seen the original version. I don't see how this happened, but it sucks. But anyway, if you just want to listen to english with Japanese music it works great. But all in all this bug gives the audio a 4/5

So overall I give this movie release a 4/5, because if you think these movies are the coolest DBZ ever like me, you'll notice these weird quirks in this version. I hope this helps.",1260576000,11,2260,4.0970654627539504
3561964,4,B001F2U6YC,"When it comes to ""Dragon Ball Z"" films, when it comes to memorable villains, the two that will always come to mine when it come to the fans are Broly and the other is Cooler.  For fans of the Frieza saga, the Cooler films have been fan favorites due to the amount of action involved but also how it relates to the storyline of the original television series.

For the fifth Dragon Ball Z film titled ""Cooler's Revenge"", the film was shown in theaters back in the Summer of 1991 and for the most part, if you haven't watched the Frieza saga yet, it is best not to watch this film just yet as it does contain spoilers to the Frieza saga and the second Dragon Ball Z special ""Bardock the Father of Goku"".  As a matter of fact, if you haven't watched these two, it's probably best that you don't read further, because my synopsis will contain spoilers.

""Cooler's Revenge"" takes place after the battle between Goku and Frieza, which the feared tyrant was defeated by Goku.  Cooler, the brother of Frieza, has always despised his brother from afar.  Always, seeing his brother always getting the upperhand and recognition but when he hears about his brother's death, he feels that he needs to beat Goku in order to restore his family's honor.  So, Frieza along with his Armored Squadron - Doure, Naiz and Salza go to Earth to find Goku.

Meanwhile, Goku, Gohan (along with his pet Icarus), Krillin and Oolong go on a camping trip and needless to say, they are attacked by the Armored Squadron. But as quickly as Goku is easy to fight against Cooler's henchman, Goku is hurt by trying to save Gohan.

With Goku out of commission, Cooler and the Armored Squadron are hunting for Goku and friends who are hiding out inside a cave.  But they need to get some help, will they get it in time?

The sixth ""Dragon Ball Z"" film is titled ""The Return of Cooler"" which was released in theaters in Japan back in March of 1992.

In this film, the people of Namek have lived peacefully in their new planet known as ""New Namek"" for the past three years (since the destruction of their planet by Frieza).  But all of a sudden, an alien force has come to take over their planet and use the Namek's as a source of energy.  Sensing the danger in his planet, Dende quickly calls out for Goku to help the Nameks.

Immediately, Goku, Piccolo, Gohan, Krillin, Master Roshi, Oolong and Yajirobi use one of the Capsule Corps spacecraft to quickly go to New Namek and help.  But when they arrive, they learn that the Nameks are being held as prisoners by these huge robots and to make things worse, these robots are controlled by Cooler (who everyone thought was killed by Goku back in the fifth DBZ film ""Cooler's Revenge) who has now evolved to Meta-Cooler.

This time, Meta-Cooler has bonded with technology and can easily reproduce himself if he loses any limbs or body parts and to make things worse, the reason why the robots are needing the Nameks is to use their energy to create many Meta-Coolers.  Can Goku and the gang help the Namek's and beat Meta-Cooler?

VIDEO & AUDIO:

There are two things that I will note in regards to both films.  The first is that both films are from 1991-1992, so it has been nearly 20 years since both films were shown in theaters in Japan.  The second thing I need to note is that I have seen all ""Dragon Ball Z"" films via High Definition with the exception of these two films which I have seen only on DVD but are digitally remastered, so I can lend you my opinion on the difference between the films on HD and the version on SD.

First, let's start off with picture quality.  The film has been remastered in High Definition and digitally restored.  The original Japanese film masters were transferred via an industry-standard Spirit DataCine, passing through a Digital Vision DVNR1000 to remove film grain and then receiving a further round of processing using a Teranex VCooo video computer.  These digital noise-reduction units helped to remove thousands of instances of dirt, scratches and debris.

With that being said, the ""Dragon Ball Z"" films look much more vibrant than its previous DVD counterpart in the past and for those who grew up with their 5th Generation VHS copies of the film, needless to say, for both films nearly 20 years old, these two films look very good.

But is it perfect?  No.  Even with the noise-reduction units to remove dirt and scratches, dirt and scratches and film warping can be seen in the earlier films of ""Dragon Ball Z"".  In fact, the later the film, the more vibrant, sharper and clearer the picture quality tends to be.  But one thing that I found with this DVD is that the dirt and scratches are not as pronounced as its HD counterpart but yet, if you are really looking, it is there.  Of course, the Blu-ray version brings out the blacks and the colors more but again, it brings out the imperfections as well.

But I think this is the best we are going to see of the films unless Toei in Japan invests in major restoration (which is very costly) for the films.  So, for now, this is the best release that we are going to see in the US for now.

As for audio, the film is presented with the English voice track with original Japanese music 5.1 surround, English voice track with U.S. Music 5.1 Surround and the original Japanese voice track with original music audio.  For the most part, the 5.1 surround audio track is where you will hear most of the sound effects via the front, center and surround channels but personally, if you have a receiver that can set all channels to stereo, I prefer that setting for a more immersive sound.

Unfortunately, the Japanese audio tracks for ""Dragon Ball Z"" have never received the 5.1 or HD lossless treatment, so audio is still the original mono soundtrack.  But personally, I've gotten used to the DBZ English dub which I think is one of the best anime series to feature right on target voice talent.  The casting was done very well and it's one of the few anime television series which I have been 100% content with the English dub voice talent.

As for the subtitles, the film offers English subtitles.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

""Dragon Ball Z: Cooler's Revenge/The Return of Cooler"" does not come with any special features but FUNimation Entertainment trailers.  It's important to note that both films are presented in two DVD's and are included in steel book case.

JUDGMENT CALL:

Overall, the Cooler-related ""Dragon Ball Z"" films were quite entertaining.  With a lot of the ""Dragon Ball Z"" films having nothing to really do with the television series in terms of it's relationship to the TV storyline, the films have been more action-driven than a reliance towards a plot.  And ""Dragon Ball Z"" is one of those few rare anime series which people don't really mind, since the action is where a lot of fans tend to zero-in on.

But what matters in the films are the actual opponents of the Z-warriors.  You either get characters that some deem forgettable and then you get characters that stick in your mind.  In the film, there are only two villains that have managed to get more than one film and that is Broly (who's presence is in three films) and Cooler who is seen on two films which are included on this movie set.

Although Frieza's storyline took many episodes and shown him nearly unbeatable, you wonder how his brother Cooler would be in battle.  And sure enough, he quickly makes his presence known to the Z-Warriors and as much as I would have loved to see his presence on the television series (especially more episodes dedicated to him), his appearance on both films are quite fine.  Although, one would question in the fifth film of how a blast took out Goku and knowing that he has taken much, much worse than a standard blast in the television series and to see him being taken out of battle and down for the count, didn't seem right.

But again, these are ""Dragon Ball Z"" films which are typically created for the fans but also shown in the theater to be shown to those unfamiliar with the TV and manga series and thus, you get certain limitations in terms of its screenplay.  But for the most part, those who expect nothing but action, will definitely find both films enjoyable.

Overall, I expect many hardcore ""Dragon Ball Z"" fans wanting to add this set to their ongoing collection of DBZ films but if you were only being selective, then definitely pick this set up and also the Broly DBZ films as well.",1255392000,3,8421,4.558139534883721
3561965,4,B001F2U6YC,"In recent years, FUNimation, who has begun to release countless anime titles spanning various genres, has gone back to the franchise that made them big - Dragon Ball Z. They have gone back and begun releasing the series and the films in inexpensive season sets and double features.

This feature combines the fifth and sixth movies of the Z series - Cooler's Revenge and The Return of Cooler.

Cooler's Revenge features a group of aliens arriving on Earth. They are led by Cooler, the brother of Frieza - and he's out for revenge for his brother being defeated by a mere Earthling. Goku, Krillin, and Gohan go into action against he and his henchmen, but Cooler has a secret - he can transform one more time than his brother. Will Goku be able to become a Super Saiyan again, and defeat this new threat?

The Return of Cooler is the sequel to the previous movie. Cooler narrowly survived the events of the previous film, and his remains now exist inside of a cybernetic space colony that lives to consume living matter, so that it can grow stronger. Cooler's next target? New Namek. The Z-Fighters head for New Namek to deal with an old foe come back.

The Cooler movies are two of my personal favorite Dragon Ball movies. The first features some good old-fashioned DBZ action with colorful villains and great battle scenes. It's nothing too original, but of all the ""a villain arrives with henchmen to cause trouble"" movies, this one is by far the best. The sequel is the better of the two, largely for its unique plot, and the new way Cooler has managed to manifest himself and serve as a larger threat. Plus the latter movie has Vegeta's first appearance in a DBZ movie. All in all these are two movies that any fan of DBZ must own.

I want to clear something up for some of the confused fans - while these ""Double Features"" crop the movies, this was always the intention. These movies were made with cropping in mind, so as to fit them on Japanese cinema screens. So you're actually seeing the movies in the aspect ratio Toei intended (this does NOT apply to the cropped Trunks/Bardock set from last year back, though - those were made for TV, and were indeed cropped without it being the intention.)

Also, for anyone who cares, like the recent series season sets, here you can watch the English dialogue with the Japanese background music. Of course the dub is still hit and miss in places (though these revised dubs are better than what FUNimation has done in the past), so do yourself a favor and stick with the original Japanese. I only wish They had remastered the Japanese audio.

And now for the all-important question - should you get this set if you already own FUNimation's older DVDs of the movies? My answer is no, there just isn't reason enough to replace your older DVDs with this set. Additionally, you can get the older versions of the movie (which have more of the picture on them, as opposed to the Jap theatrical aspect ratio) for VERY cheap from Amazon's independent sellers. But if you can't find the older, cheaper issues, this makes for a fine alternative. You DO get 2 good movies for a good price.

Final verdict? Get it if you're a DBZ fan, but not if you already have older DVDs of the movies.",1242864000,,3225,4.548275862068966

3561968,5,B001F2U6YC,im glad to see funimation releasing the dbz movies like this.even the metal tin packaging is pretty cool.the 2 cooler movies being released are by far my favorites and well worth it.i don't agree with the other reveiw saying it was bad that funimation got rid of all that metal music that only appeals to certain people.i would much rather listen to the japanese audio music instead while watching these movies.im more of a classic rock and blues guy anyway.i also recommand getting the first 3 seasons as well as the other duel movie sets.those are the best dragonball z has to offer and well worth it as well.,1221868800,3,611,4.614678899082569

3561982,4,B001F2U6YC,"The video itself was just as good as I'd hoped from a remaster. While I never particularly cared for Return of Cooler, the earlier Cooler's Revenge has always been very important to me and brings me fond memories of watching Dragon Ball with my cousin as a young child. In fact he and I still watch Dragon Ball Z together occasionally and we're both in our early 20's.

You may initially wonder where the music is that made the first movie so awesome, I was almost upset but soon realized I had to change the language to English 2 to get the soundtrack to play. That doesn't affect my score, however my indifference towards the second movie is what caused me to give this Blu Ray remaster 4 stars.",1468281600,4,697,4.403100775193798

3562112,5,B001F2U6YC,"I am a fan of Dragon Ball Z since my youth and when I saw these steel packs of the movies at the first time, I started to purchase them in Amazon. The problem is that the Cooler movies wasn't available to purchase, probably because the end of the inventory. In September of the last year (2010), I've been in US and I tried to buy this item, without success. After that, I periodically looked in Amazon if this item was available with a reasonable price. Because this movie became a collector's item, the price was so high, imagine for a guy in Brazil where the freight cost already is so expensive. And so, I found a seller offering a used product and I decided to try, if I'd really wish to complete my collection. I really tried to complete my collection not because I wished to have all movies but, because the Coller's story is really very fun. If you see Dragon Ball Z since the first episode, you can see that the main point of the plot is related to a universal dictator. After the Sayan's saga, Goku discovered that Friezer, this dictator, destroyed his homeworld and now he rules the universe, but fears the ""super sayan"". This is the story of Dragon Ball Z. The next chapters exists because the success of the serie, and of course this serie could not simply finish. Seeing the movies, the simple existance of a Friezer's brother is enough. And the movie is very interesting because you can see stories with Goku as a super sayan and Vegita starring in the Dragon Ball Z movies. Furthermore, Coller has an additional transformation, and it was very cool. In summary, this is a great Dragon Ball Z movie, and I recommend it for all fans.",1328486400,3,1647,4.456953642384106
3562113,3,B001F2U6YC,"Unless you're upgrading it from VHS then don't worry about buying a blu-ray version if you already have the DVD.

Having watched the original DragonballZ on DVDs and despite their best attempts at restoring the original films, the blu-ray version doesn't seem to offer any real advantage to the DVD versions.

You will still notice the film grain throughout the film.
Another issue is given that the original version was made for 4:3 the up scaling to 16:9 didn't really do anything for the film and feels like a cropped/stretched version of the original.

The storyline itself is fine as I am a huge fan of the series and for the price on Amazon it was a good deal which is why it got a 3 out of 5 instead of a 2 out of 5.",1322179200,,723,4.301470588235294

8300663,3,B001F2U6YC,"Coolers revenge was my childhood so I had to pick this up. To make this review short ill just say this. Cooler is menacing and is given some cold blooded one liners; for the first film, and the action for the most part is cool for both films. I just wanna go over some cons to prepare those who don't know what to expect. My issue with coolers revenge is well the editing done with the music. Dont get me wrong, rock and dbz is amazing. Favorite scene has to be when goku revives a bird when turning into super saiyan with deftones change playing. Amazing. There is one scene however where the music is chopped and real noticeable while watching. I guess back then there wasn't a lot of care put towards this particular scene (the first fight between cooler and goku with disturbed the game playing). Could be seen as a nitpick however. First film awesome. Personally for me I could care less about the second film. Wasn't for me. I just didn't like the story but it does have one badass scene with vegeta where he completely disregards goku being in the way and tries to blast cooler with his ki blasts. Pretty funny haha as for the quality of both features you don't have to worry. It looks good. Gave it a 3, would of been a 4 had I liked the return of cooler and had it been cheaper.",1505520000,,1287,4.278688524590164
