8443798,5,B004VQRC9Q,"A superb French film that alludes to the existence of the djinn.  The actual djinn are never really ""fully"" shown; but they are presented in their true shadow-world between ours.  The overall plot and ending are what make this film truly worth watching - heartfelt and thought provoking indeed.  Recommended!",1389744000,2,308,5.12
