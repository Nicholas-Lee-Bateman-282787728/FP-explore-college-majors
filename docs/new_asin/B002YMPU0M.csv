8384308,4,B002YMPU0M,"Nils Holgersson and his goose are visible ""big time"" at our Scandinavian Center at California Lutheran University. In a model suspended from the ceiling of our ScanCenter, Nils rides atop his goose with its eight-foot wingspan. We also have other smaller references to Nils, some given by my teacher relative in Sweden. Nils is significant in Swedish education, because the story of his flight on his goose depicts the geography as well as the flora and fauna of Sweden. The Swedish education association initiated the concept more than a century ago by commissioning Swedish writer Selma Lagerlof (she later won a Nobel Prize in literature for other novels) to create a story that would teach in an entertaining way. Now, besides seeing Nils and his goose in big scale overhead at our ScanCenter, we ""underscore"" the story by showing this film, which captures the essence of the story in a simple but appealing way--including the conversion of Nils from a hurtful to helpful kid.",1362009600,,980,4.9817073170731705
