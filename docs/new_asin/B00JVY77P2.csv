8654117,5,B00JVY77P2,I absolutely loved this documentary!!  I vaguely remember her from my earlier years growing up in NOLA!  This was so interesting and so informative!  Tells all about this odd lady and her life in the French Quarter!!  Now I'm looking for a poster or some of her postcards!!!  Great job Rick DeLaup!!!!  Wish there was a book!!!  Thank you for keeping her story alive for future generations to come!!!!  Love love loved it!!!!,1443225600,3,425,4.726027397260274
