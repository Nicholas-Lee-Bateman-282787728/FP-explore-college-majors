8438618,5,B004QXKHFK,Excellent movie. It's a good anime and it was a gift to my father who loves this series. He likes blu-rays.,1386720000,,107,4.142857142857143
8438619,5,B004QXKHFK,I'm a huge Unicorn fan. Getting this series made getting a Bluray player worth it. In fact its the reason I bought a blu ray player in the first place.,1367539200,,151,4.066666666666666
8438620,5,B004QXKHFK,"If you haven't seen Unicorn yet, do yourself a favor and watch them all. this is some of the best gundam you will ever see. even though its only an hour it is worth it because the blu rays become incredibly expensive right after they come out. regardless pick it up at a good price somewhere. but don't pay over $50 for it",1362096000,,322,4.126984126984127
8438621,5,B004QXKHFK,Episode 3... just awesome.  You can see that every aspect of the story is executed with passion.  The battle scenes are flat out amazing but maybe not as technically polished as the first Kashatria battle in Episode 1... never the less this episode delivers solid in your face Gundam from start to finish.,1311984000,2,305,4.735849056603773
8438622,4,B004QXKHFK,"Gundam Unicorn is a great extension of the Universal Century story.  The animation is bright, clear and detailed with less cartoony designs and a far better story than the terrible, pandering Gundam Seed and Seed Destiny series of the last few years.

Having purchased both previous volumes while in Japan, I was very much looking forward to picking up volume 3 on Amazon.. but unfortunately it appears Bandai has other ideas and Amazon.com will NOT ship this Blu-Ray to Canada, and the disc is not available from Amazon.ca as of July.  So I guess I'll just have to circumvent your idiotic licensing restrictions by shipping a disc all the way from Japan itself.  Thanks for nothing, Amazon.",1311811200,2,691,4.880341880341881
8438623,5,B004QXKHFK,"Sunrise did a very nice job again. This episode is the best so far and the music is as good as the original Mobile Suite Zeta Gundam. At the end of the battle between Banagher and Merida, the music theme is like the ending theme of the 50th episode of Z Gundam. Also, the song performed by Chemistry is excellent.

This episode has around 40 minutes in mobile suit battle. The recounting of Merida's past experience is sad and it touches upon the era of ZZ Gundam. I really like the appearance of the old Musai from 0079, the Gaza-C from 0087, the Dra-C from 0083. There are Hi-Zack Recon Type and Dresissen from 0088.

I'm looking forward to the next episode when Banagher landed on earth. I remember seeing a picture of Banagher hiding Unicorn Gundam in the desert and having a cloak cover himself and it resemble the scene of Amuro in 0079.",1306368000,6,843,4.432258064516129
8438624,5,B004QXKHFK,"This review covers volume 3 of Gundam Unicorn on bluray.  So far this fantastic anime series is still only on bluray although Bandai has announced they will be released DVD versions in the future.

Story - Wow, so far I'm very impressed with the series, and not just the animation and HD presentation, but the maturity and complexity of this story. Sure Banagher acts and talks like your typical teen 'why me?' Gundam protagonist but the whole plot surrounding the secret of La+ and the revelation (i'm sure MORE will be revealed) about the truth behind the intent of the NT-D system...it is a very cynical view on the future of Newtypes in the UC timeline, which makes sense with the later entires in the UC continuity. This whole 'unravelling a old mystery/conspiracy' storyline makes for a great, engaging story requiring a bit of thought, and so far I don't really indentify any clear 'heroes' or 'villains' as everyone feels like a real character and are likeable to some degree. They are just on opposing sides of the same chase.

For U.C. Mobile Suit fans you get to see a whole array of 'blasts from the past' from the Z and ZZ era Zeon suits including the Gaza-C/D, Dreissens, and the stunning new Federation Delta Plus, which sharped eyed viewers will recognize as the successful incarnation of the Hyaku Shiki MS from Zeta Gundam.

Animation - crisp and clean in stunning 1080p as well, the scenes especially in the linear cockpits offer a gorgeous integration of cel and CG style animation.

Audio - Terrific and comes in Dolby japanese and english audio tracks.  English dub is decent and very listenable, while I usually watch Gundam in Japanese I switched to english when I was doing some other things and couldn't watch the screen the entire time.

Bonuses - alas the one weak point of these DVDs, the only real extras come in the form of the BD Live which of course only works if your bluray player is hooked up to the internet.  What I've heard is they have a complete audio file and japanese transcript of the garbled LaPlace speech but aside from that maybe some lineart.",1304640000,,2091,4.663043478260869
