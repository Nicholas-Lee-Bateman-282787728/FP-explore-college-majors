6493347,5,B00LNBQ8SI,This Blu-ray marks the first release of Rebirth of Mothra III in the US .Much more whimsical than the Godzilla films of the same period but with similar FX. These were released annually in Japan after Godzilla had died in Godzilla vs Destroyah and the American Godzilla movie  was released to tepid response. In 2000 Toho returned to Godzilla  as it's leading player but these served as place holders in the series. Recommended.!,1410220800,,429,4.863013698630137
6493348,5,B00LNBQ8SI,"Having the trilogy of The Rebirth of Mothra on blu-ray is wonderful. Up till now, you could only get 1 and 2 on a DVD double pack together, but never number 3. The double pack only cost about $10-$20. Three, you could only get on DVD in Japanese language and captions. If you were very lucky and looked hard, you could find it on DVD with English captions, but very rare. Either way, both ways on DVD started, at lowest, about $60-$65. So owning this blu-ray pack of all three movies, for as low of this and remastered in blu-ray, it is 100% worth the price and buy.",1410220800,6,566,4.25
6493349,5,B00LNBQ8SI,"Before Mothra appears in the American reboot trilogy of Godzilla - and before people will inevitably complain about the monster's total screen time - serious fans of the Godzilla universe should give this trilogy a try. By no means do the three Rebirth of Mothra films escape the infantile special effects bonanza of the 90s, but it's a visual joy for kaiju filmgoers who want to witness the legendary radioactive moth being paid enormous respect as the protagonist of its very own trilogy. Consider also what Amazon reviewer Wolfy agreeably noted, that finding the sequels to the first Rebirth of Mothra is fairly tough stateside. Being able to buy all three - in Blu-Ray, no less - is practically a godsend for Kaiju diehards.

One thing, in particular, that sets this series apart from other monster films is its active use of fantasy genre elements that really give it a Sci-Fi feel, rather than just being a monster brawl flick. The writers of this trilogy put some noticeable effort building a mythology that worked well with Mothra's own established canon. Yes, as a result there are moments that tend to feel childlike and cheesy (especially the dialogue of the human characters, who don't really add or subtract from the movies), but it's not damaging to the final product at all.

Of the three films, the third featuring King Ghidorah may be the best, followed by the surprisingly emotional first and then the second. There's a real sense of urgency in the third film, an impression that was somewhat absent in the first two. The second film might be the worst, because personally the plot and pace of it never really allowed me to settle into the movie. But as an overview, all three films are quite enjoyable, nonetheless. For its very minimal shortcomings, you can tell that great care was taken to create these films, and it's the type of care that kept monster movie lovers very much in mind. If you were ever interested in watching entertaining movies about one of Toho's iconic monsters, the Rebirth of Mothra trilogy is a fitting destination.",1406592000,41,2060,4.81638418079096

6493351,5,B00LNBQ8SI,"I know this is a silly reason to buy this but I absolutely love Mothra and although I did enjoy seeing him/her pop up from time to time in the Godzilla movies, I really wanted to see movies with him/her in it as a main character hence why I bought this. It was totally worth buying in my opinion (not to mention much cheaper than if I had bought it from a store) :)",1499990400,,365,3.945945945945946
6493352,3,B00LNBQ8SI,"Well for Monster fanatics that grew up watching these classics on afternoon TV . It was ok. And the reason was not because the Special effects was bad, it wasn't they were done quite well. I had a problem with the story itself. Each one had little kids with some moralizing tale that took over the movie. One even seemed to be a Japanese version of ""Home Alone"" with the villians acting almost cartoonish trying to steal a ""Furby"" like creature from a little girl. There were no government actions the military never bothered to be seen combatting a huge creature that appears on their shore. Just Mothra. It was missing that element most of the time it seemed to be struggling to make a little sense. Gamera was always the childrens protector now Mothra? When did that happen? The twin fairies have an evil sister riding a mechanical gargoyle who shows up to stir trouble for the other two ""good"" sisters. This may be a good movie to let kids watch but for hardcore fans of the genre. It lacks big time.",1499731200,5,1004,4.491803278688525

As an adult I give the movies 1 star each. They are ridiculous. At first I was going to be critical but when I realized they were kids movies I figured what was the point. I realized this part of the way through the first movie. By the second movie there was no doubt.

I suppose for kids it isn't too bad, especially since the kids are the heroes in all the movies.....

Not much of an attempt was made to make the fairy twins look like twins anymore....I guess they are fraternal twins...

There are so many things to be critical about that I wouldn't even know where to start. Though it would be kind of like criticizing Bugs Bunny for not being realistic. Mothra seems to come up with a new power every time she (he?) needs one. Fairy dust, lightning bolts, super speed, splitting into multiple Mothra's, laser beams, turn into a fish!!!....you name it Mothra has it....Godzilla watch out!...

oh yeah and Mothra can lay an egg bigger than her body too!

Overall this was a major disappointment for a long time fan of monster (OK...kaiju) movies

6493391,5,B00LNBQ8SI,"The Blu-ray package: First and foremost its great to finally have Mothra 3 finally available to us in the States and in Blu-ray format no less!  Despite that movies marginality and the graininess of the transfers (the pictures look good but aren't necessarily crisp) its great to have all three movies in this Rebirth of Mothra trilogy packaged together.  Sure its no frills and the DVD interface can be confusing but why complain if you're a kaiju enthusiast who wants to have a shot at completing your DVD library?  As for the movies, all are squarely aimed at the kids and star kids, much like the last few original Gamera movies and the most recent Gamera movie, Gamera the Brave.  All also boast a lot of spfx with an overabundance of explosions and wild and colorful energy rays zapping and frapping about.  All three movies, too, involve the Elias twins (not so much twins any more though) and their miscreant sister bad Belvera.  The Elias usually manage to sing a time or two in each movie and are accompanied by/ ride atop Fairy Mothra who is a pastel cute and cuddly miniature version of Mothra while Belvera rides and frequently abuses her miniature cyborg dragon, Garugaru.  These gals are always having dogfights in and around houses and forests and mythical sea castles.  All the movies are brightly colored and prominently feature the mighty magical Mothra.  In fact those kaiju enthusiasts who like a lot of screen time for their monsters are likely to be pleased with this series in that respect.  The first of the movies is the best and most grounded (by comparison), the second the wildest and most fantastic, and the third the weirdest and most uneven.  As a whole package, considering the value involved, I feel the need to give the product 5 stars.  But for breakdowns on the individual movies, see below.

Rebirth of Mothra: The first in the series is the best.  This movie is highlighted by an actual touching death scene as the imago stage of Mothra sacrifices itself for its child and sinks slowly beneath crystal blue Pacific waters.  We are introduced to not only the new Elias twins but also to their evil, glum sister Belvera, in a cacophonous brouhaha between the sides of good and evil inside a brother and sisters house that trashes the living room, play area, and kitchen.  Belvera is chased off and the kids come under the Elias protection, and fairy Mothras, by extension.  The kids dad is a construction owner whose company has broken an ancient seal up in the mountains of Japan that leads to the resurrection and resurgence of the monstrous Death Ghidorah.  Death Ghidorah resembles its King cousin in its three serpentine dragon heads but is different in its red hide hue, stocky Brontosaurus body, and ability to sprout wings once its gathered enough earth essence energies.  The plentiful battles between the larval and imago Mothra stages all take place in the burning mountains and highland lakes and I don't recall the creature ever reaching civilization, but Death Ghidorah (sounds like Desughidora) looks good if not a bit stiff.  He sure gives Mothra a run for the money.  By movies end the kids, who were separated from their parents in the burning mountains, are reunited and Mothra magically undoes the destruction to the earth that his battles with Death Ghidorah caused.  The effects in this movie are tamer but tighter than the second feature and are, on the whole, very satisfying.  The future iterations used even more effects but more cheaply and far less satisfyingly.  I give this first entry a solid 4 stars that even old-school G fans (adults) can enjoy for the most part.

Rebirth of Mothra II: The second feature takes a page out of Godzillas Revenge when it utilizes a couple of bumbling young adults who fall under Belveras influence and help her terrorize the kids who star prominently in this film.  Theres a little girl on an island who comes across an oversized Furby who can heal wounds by peeing on them (yesyes, you read that correctly) and who has a couple of peer-aged boys befriend her on an adventure though those boys started off by bullying her.  They play catch with the magical Furby as an ecological disaster of mutant starfish start cropping up everywhere and attack people with acidic rapaciousness.  The kids are befriended by the Elias and fairy Mothra and go on a fantastical adventure that leads them to an Atlantis-like pyramid structure out in the ocean.  This magical monolith is impossibly huge inside and holds within its tomb traps and tricks aplenty.  Think of an Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade or even Alien Versus Predator for a type of reference.  The main monster baddie is an extremely unique aquatic creation with an hippopotamus type head named Dagahra (sounds like Dagarla).  Dagahra expels the slimy red starfish en masse and has a variety of energy powers.  He is an extremely bulky underwater dragon whose design is not pleasant and we never get a really good sustained head-to-toe look of this bad beastie.  He fails to convey the menace he needs to convey and ends up being one of my least favorite kaiju in both design and execution.  His toxic energy does put a wallop of the mythic mothra and puts the bug on the ropes before the kids use the magical furby to help save the day and Mothra, always developing new and ridiculously fantastical powers (just what the script calls for), transforms into a sleek aquatic version who can seemingly travel in supersonic speedy fashion underwater and split into a million smaller versions of itself to take out the hybrid starfish and ultimately blow up Dagahra.  This movie feels like an everything and the kitchen sink type of film.  It can be entertaining, but it is busy, though never lacking in rich color and abundant spfx.  In the end its almost too much but along the way its a magical adventure.  This entry rates 3.25 stars.

Rebirth of Mothra III: For many fans this could easily be the favorite for a couple of reasons: 1) King Ghidorah, the titanic triple-headed terror is the main villain, looks really good and villainous in his scaly golden-yellow skin, and even has his own history expanded upon during a glimpse of earths prehistoric history and (2) Mothras magical earth force mythos is also expanded upon in like fashion with a cool new wicked looking prehistoric caterpillar form and a metallic form.  The Elias sisters are again intricately involved in the plot, with Belvera finally given a slight redemption.  The plot revolves around King G flying over rural and cityscapes and magically teleporting children (yep, you read that right) into a giant placental easter egg out in the middle of a forest.  The parents are helpless to stop it and don't know whats going on, and the time is ticking and when it runs out the egg is going to acidically eat the children (yep, you read that right).  The innocents of the earth are going to be cremated and King G will rule the earth except Mothra, drawing on all of her magical energies buoyed by the earth (and they are many indeed) travels through time and back to emerge victorious in wild fashion over the gluttonous Ghidorah.  Oh, and we do have human actors (kids mostly) who are caught up in the whole struggle who help manage to save the day too.-----IMO this is the worst of the three for many reasons, and logic is a big part of it.  Simply put when a character is magical they can do seemingly anything and this undercuts the narrative tension; and Mothra with its ability to die and regenerate and now travel through time and turn metallic and so on just feels to be too much to swallow.  King Ghidorah, while looking great, is completely played like a moustache twisting villain from silent movies who ties the damsel in distress to the tracks; instead of laying thunderous waste to the townships and cities with his gravity beams he simply flies over and teleports kids?  What?  This leaves a lot to be desired and is completely out of character for the King of the villainous beasts.  The spfx are wildly uneven (look at some of those Ghidorah shadows passing over the city, or the rubber dinosaursyeesh!) and are probably the worst of the three movies, with Belveras flying dragon Garugaru being unbelievably stiff.  The kid actors are inane.  And though the fantastical and effects elements are given a lot of room and some fancy treatments it all begins to feel like too much sugar in the cereal, like the visual overload that was the Batman and Robin movie that starred George Clooney and Arnold Schwarzeneggar.  This is all too bad because the time travel element, while not handled well, did serve up some interest in showing us our beloved monsters having been around for millions of years.  This movie is pure kiddie fantasy that seems aimed at the under 12 set, which isn't a problem, except that theres little in it (if anything at all) that is aimed at the teenage to adult set.  The best thing about Mothra 3 was the poster that accompanied it.  That was kinda cool.  This movie?  2.5 stars.",1445040000,5,9039,4.739297124600639

They are definitely a superb investment. They are digitally remastered so the movie is crisp and vibrant just as it was originally intended. The music is wonderful, the fairies and kaiju are also amazing - this is a definite important piece to any kaiju fan's collection. Like many Sony releases I was a bit sad that there are not more special features - but I'm satisfied overall with this investment.",1419206400,,580,4.696078431372549

6493439,4,B00LNBQ8SI,"These films are for the juice box crowed of 1990's Japan, so clearly not for everyone. That being said, these films have pretty great monster-on-monster action. The human characters suck, but the effects are pretty good for this genre of film. The most popular seems to be the first one, which is probably the best one. My favorite is the second one, which a lot of people seem to hate but it has Mothra changing into Aqua Mothra, which makes it worth a viewing. That being said, Godzilla does not come out in these movie AT ALL, so don't expect him to show up at the end to save the day or anything. King Ghidorah is the antagonist of the third one, though he is a little different than he traditionally portrayed. Not for everyone, but for fans of the genre or the Mothra character in particular, this is a must see.",1414540800,,818,4.3881578947368425

6493444,5,B00LNBQ8SI,"Now I'll start off simple, this package is totally worth it. I saw all three movies on TV 2 years ago and I had to watch them. When I looked, they only had the first two. That I why this product was great. I saw the third one once and I loved every minute of it. Now that they have a product with the third one include, I died with excitement. These movies are great for wanting to watch more of the great and beautiful Mothra. Anyway that is why a already established Godzilla fan should buy this product. But for newly joining Kaiju lovers, you got to be careful where you start. I started with GMK and it screwed me up because for so long I thought King Ghidorah was a good guy. This trilogy would be a good place to start, particularly if you're starting because Godzilla 2014. It is good to start watching Kaiju movies with not so big monster. Like I love Godzilla but I worship Mothra. But anyway long story short, go buy this!",1412726400,,933,4.217877094972067
6493445,5,B00LNBQ8SI,"It was about time someone would release this movies together, specially the inclusion of the third movie since it has never been release on VHS or DVD and was only show in the Television in the US while the other 2 previews movies you could get it anywhere else at the time.

This Rebirth of Mothra Trilogy collection( or RoMT for short) is one of the best having the inclusion of all 3 movies together, specially the third one of how rare it is makes it even better.

The movie story saga is more on the take of the old Mothra passing down the baton to his son which he will become the new Mothra and we see his adventure and challenges he will face during the 3 movies.

-the story for each movie-

- RoM1: A group of workers uncovers by accident a secret chamber sealing away Desghidorah, a three-headed monster that consumes anything that has a high life-force which is pretty much the plants and trees. Millions of years ago, this monster was the cause that the planet Mars that had life would be in turn as the red planet as we know it. The creature is release and is ready to bring the end of all life on earth as we know it. The tiny twins, Moll and Loar must call forth  Mothra which now old and tired after giving birth must go into the battle to fight and stop this terrible creature.

- RoM2: In this movie the Earth and the humankind is once again in danger by a creature know as Dagahra, a monster that east garbage and `produces like some kind of starfish that spit acid. In this processes as well an ancient underwater city knows as the Nilai-Kanai appear which inside this said city has a secret treasure that could make the Earth a prosperous planet. A group of kids guided by a little Fur-ball creature helps them explore this ancient city and try to find this treasure which could hold the power that is needed to defeat Dagarah and save the Earth.

-RoM3: An ancient creature returns to Earth once again, it is non other than King Ghidorah(Godzilla's archenemy) , a giant golden three-headed dragon that millions of years ago he brought the end and the extinction of the dinosaurs. Now he has return to Earth once again to consume and this time he might bring the end of human kind. Its up to Mothra to stop this creature no mater what it takes to do so before King Ghidorah brings the end of all human kind and the Earth itself.

Granted this movies where aim for more for the kids than for the adults alike, but still they are very enjoyable to watch. Out of the 3 movies, the RoM2 is considered by many as the weakest of the trilogy while RoM1 been the strongest and better of the 3 and the RoM3 been close second.

-RoMT Collection  content and specification -

- Disc: the Blu-ray collection comes with 2 disc, the first disc has RoM1 while the second disc includes both RoM2 and RoM3.

- Video Quality: All 3 movies are 1080p HD 1.85:1, even with all this, the videos kinda look grainy but it is much better in higher quality than the DVDs i got when i bought it years ago (at least for RoM1 and 2) so no complains on my part. Its also wide-screen which it defeats by a mile my old DVD and VHS of RoM 1 and 2.

- Audio: all 3 movies have Japaneses and English 2.0 Stereo DTS-HD MA, sounds pretty good although most of the time the sound effects and music becomes a bit to loud. still better than my old DVDs of VHS.

- Subtitles: All 3 movies have English, English SDH and French, however no Japaneses subtitles are included.

- Length: for each movie as it follows, RoM1 ( approx .106 mins), RoM2 (approx. 100 mins) and RoM3( approx. 100 mins)

- Special features: sadly this is the weakest point of the collection, there is no ""documentary"" or ""making of"" of the movies. the only thing it comes with is just the Original Trailers of each movie so although i don't mind, this is quite disappointing.

- Conclusion-

While this collection didn't bring any real special features, this is still a good collection, more specifically having the inclusion of RoM3 that possibly is the crown jewel in this and finally completing the trilogy of the movies. While this is more aim for kids it still can be enjoy for everyone. Do i recommend it?  yes, get it while you can before its remove from the market. This might possibly be the first and only time that we might see RoM3 in a blu-ray available here for the western side.",1412553600,,4345,4.348578491965389

Great movies, great transfers (blu-ray).

I wish they had gotten the rights to all of the titles. The direct TOHO and Media Blasters blu-ray titles such as Godzilla vs Megalon are appalling. The blacks look light light gray and the dynamic range is almost zero. Total jokes of transfers (and they only had like years to work on Godzilla vs Megalon).",1410220800,2,532,5.034090909090909

I will ALWAYS respect Mothra, and have her detailed figure standing guard over my beloved dead cats urns.
