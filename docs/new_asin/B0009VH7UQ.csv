If you don't know much about THE KING you'll fall in love and if you are a fan then...your heart will beat faster, you will have butterflies flying around in your stomach and you'll remember how it felt the first time you saw and heard THE GREAT Elvis Presley!!! Fourteen years into his carrier and Elvis is looking Sizzling!!!

What an outstanding DVD and music selection, it is indeed THE BEST OF ELVIS!!! All his brilliant songs that touched our hearts are right here. This is a MUST HAVE for all the Elvis fans out there.

I LOOOOOOOOOVE this DVD, It has now became my favorite, much better than ""Elvis-One night with you"".

It's an import and the menu is in Portuguese but so easy to navigate a two year old can do it, and with 29 Best Songs it is SOOOOOO WORTH IT!!!

Elvis ROCKS in all his splendor in this DVD!!!A MUST HAVE, MUST SEE OVER AND OVER DVD!!!",1123545600,12,908,4.386904761904762
