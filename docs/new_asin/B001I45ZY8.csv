8310416,2,B001I45ZY8,"I think a great spinning workout should consist of a variety of movements.  If you've ever been to a high energy spin class, then that's how I prefer to workout.  Target Heart Rate Training fails to be inspiring and fun.  I rode 20 minutes into the workout before I realized an overwhelming majority of the workout only consisted of flat roads.  About 5 minutes towards to end, you do a short standing climb.  That's if you can defeat boredom to the end.

Also, the music is Christian pop rock.  It's tolerable.  However, the music levels are way too high.  You can barely hear the instructor talk.

Overall, I wouldn't recommend buying the DVD unless you can try it beforehand.  I was lucky enough to buy the downloadable version for a fraction of the cost although I'm still out of $4.99.",1237939200,4,790,4.571428571428571
8310417,2,B001I45ZY8,"This video is suitable for someone just looking for a light workout.

I have a number of spin videos which I use at home with my spinner, and fit my mood and inclination to the type of video.  I would say the music quality on these videos is a cut above the others, although it isn't really spin music -- the type that motivates you to push harder.  Ms. Evans is remarkably low-key as a spin ""instructor"" and comes across as sincere but out of her element.  I know something about target heart rate training for spinning, but it takes some imagination to consider heart rate even relevant to this video -- there is no discussion of max heart rate and the method to compute, no obvious rationale for the very occasional references to heart rate.  She ignores any stretching for anything below the arms, but perhaps with this low-key activity level you don't really need it.

The principal recommendation here is the music quality, but if this is the kind of music you want to spin to, just buy the music and skip the spin video.  You can do better motivating yourself if you have any experience.",1237075200,2,1094,4.494949494949495
8310418,5,B001I45ZY8,"This is a fantastic workout.  I've done a lot of cycling workouts in the gym, and this is one of the best routines.  It is challenging, but I improve each time I do it.  Ms. Evans' form ques and encouragement are timed just right for the workout.  I purchased the audio version from her web site before it was available on Amazon.  I look forward to more workouts.",1226880000,,364,4.294117647058823
8310419,5,B001I45ZY8,"Great workout.  I really enjoy the music.  It's motivating, modern music and
not the disco-like stuff that plagues many exercise videos. The instructor
does a great job of pushing you through jumps and out-of-the-saddle
climbing.  I found the DVD worth the money!",1225670400,2,263,5.214285714285714
