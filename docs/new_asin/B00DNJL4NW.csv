8595022,2,B00DNJL4NW,"Good cinematography but rambling plot about two narcissistic young lovers.  She nurses him back to health; they attempt a failed suicide, engage in endless whining about their feelings for one another with lots of posturing, poses and melodramatic pointlessness -- all in the surroundings of a health spa in the mountains.  Hes complex and conflicted, shes lighthearted and childlike.  Its a fairly typical Japanese chic flic of the period.

On the other hand, the scenery is great and the acting is adequate for what it is.  The period is at the end of World War II and there is a scene where the Emperor announces the Japanese surrender over the radio while people stand in formation to listen to him.  Unlike the urban areas of Japan this place remains safe and relatively prosperous.

If you like this sort of thing, go for it.  Personally, I wasted my money.",1385942400,,863,4.783783783783784
