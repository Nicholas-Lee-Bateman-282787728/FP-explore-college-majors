7938261,3,B00005IBN7,very good movie I grew up watching in the 80s about a Native kid beating up on bullies.  This movie should be released on dvd and improve the audio and picture..  funny part is the baseball scene when Issac hits the ball with bat and it hits a guy in the balls.. very funny  LOL,1362182400,,278,4.0181818181818185
7938262,5,B00005IBN7,"This movie is very amusing and deals with the prejudice of the time in the 60's. An American Indian orphan is brought up by a Jewish shopkeeper. The two bond and the shop keeper loves him dearly and brings him up as if he was his son.  The teenage boy has a great deal of anger for being abandoned by his parents. There is a great deal of fighting and conflict involving a rough and narrow minded family in town. ...cultures and backgrounds collide. I especially enjoyed the dialogue of the Jewish store-owner as well as the adorable Native American great grandfather of Isaac! Isaac does end up meeting his irresponsible biological father.

I would highly recommend this movie but can't find it on DVD!!!
That is a BIG negative!!",1343865600,,730,4.607692307692307
