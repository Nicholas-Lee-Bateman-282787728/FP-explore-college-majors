8313068,2,B001JL96KO,"Once again, it's an Alpha Video Release. Rare Tex Ritter films that have been altered. Music cues and sound effects such as the sound of broken glass has been added to the sounttrack. Why they do this I do not know. I suspect Alpha wants to ""brand"" the movies and lay claim they own them. I like old cowboy westerns but to discover they freeze frame screens, add their logo in the corner of the screen and then add sound effects to the sound track (and the sound effects stand out very clearly, it's very distracting) is too much to bare. This is why I try to avoid anything manufactured by Alpha Video. (Besides, they probably got their films from VHS videos bought at the flea market. It's the kind of quality they offer on their DVDs.)",1326585600,,738,4.394160583941606
