8136320,1,B000H5A594,Received  a DVD which could not be played at a European DVD player :-((,1413676800,,71,4.071428571428571
8136321,5,B000H5A594,This is a challenging workout that moves along nicely and doesn't linger too much on any of the exercises.  I use an exerband instead of the Winsor Pilates band and this works pretty well.,1398556800,2,188,4.529411764705882
8136322,3,B000H5A594,I love a lot of Mari Winsor discs. I was not a huge fan of this one because I rarely like Pilates routines that are based on Reformer exercises when not on the Reformer. I love the Reformer. These do not do it justice.,1395619200,2,218,3.977272727272727
8136323,5,B000H5A594,"I gave this 5 stars as I use all of  Mari  Windsor and Tracy Mallett's workout DVD's and let me tell you they work and you will have quick fast results. You will tighten and tone your body in no time meaning working out  just 3 times per week you should be able to reach your body image goals within 3 weeks or less. Of course this comes with drinking your water and eating well balanced meals NOT dieting just well balanced meals.  Working with resistance bands and your own body weight you will get results!!! Also, it's very easy to follow the instructors directions not too fast or too slow they are clear and concise. Both these instructors in my opinion are the best in the business. I workout 3-4 x per week mixing Tracy Mallett and Mari Winsor I do 20 minute workouts for 3 days and 1 45 minute workout on the 4th day  and have the body to prove it thanks to these ladies. LOVE IT!!!!!",1388880000,5,893,4.229411764705882
8136324,4,B000H5A594,"The workout is fine - LOVE Mari's workouts!!
Disappointed though in the fact that there was no resistance band included.",1378684800,2,120,5.05
8136325,4,B000H5A594,"I was thrilled to find this because I have searched for this  Winsor  PIlates Advanced Sculpting With Resistance DVD  for years with no luck, I was beginning to think it didn't exist. I'll go back years now when I bought the beginning DVD it showed me how beneficial working with resistance can be. Now, I am using ropes,cords etc. and very advanced resistance training, however, I really wanted this DVD, and was hoping to  also replace my original Winsor  band that came with the beginning DVD. I did snap it a couple of years ago, but no complaints it lasted for 5 years and I used it for other programs. I was disappointed when the DVD arrived because instead of the Winsor band there was a flimsy, small  purple one that never would have done me any good. I was able to find an actual Winsor band on your site so I bought it after this DVD arrived. The band is  a bit  pricey but compared to the others it's worth the investment. This workout is good! I especially like all the arm, leg and rear routines in here.  I am not sure I would recommend this particular Pilates DVD to a beginner it's fast paced, Mari does not stop to explain the positions etc. . For me it's wonderful to be able to vary my workout routines so I use this about 2x per week for firming and toning. Just beware if you buy it you may not get the proper band and the workout will be pretty useless without Mari's heavier and larger band.",1357084800,5,1415,4.2894736842105265
