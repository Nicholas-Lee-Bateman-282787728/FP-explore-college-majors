1384208,5,B00004ZETT,"This game is INSANE! The visuals on it are like nothing you've ever seen before, and you're not likely to see anything like this on current or upcoming game systems either (due to the unique way they're implemented on NUON). This game is worth the price of a NUON enhanced DVD player easily. KILLER APP!",977011200,8,303,4.527272727272727
1384209,5,B00004ZETT,"I used to play this game addictively as Tempest 2000 on the Atari Jaguar (and otherwise marginal system). I bought a Nuon player on the strength of the Virtual Light Machine and Tempest 3000. I'll let you know in a week how the new versions compare. Since the Nuon hardware is better in every way, and the same brilliant programmer that wrote VLM and Tempest on the Jaguar wrote the Nuon versions, I am looking forward to the combination.",976665600,7,438,4.556962025316456

7928585,5,B00004ZETT,"The only system that you can play the Tempest 3000 in on Nuon.
Sometimes it's hard to find, so if you see it and you have Nuon, you need to get it.",1375228800,,147,3.625
7928586,5,B00004ZETT,"One of the greatest shooters ever, only available on a defunct console that hides inside a dvd player. It's criminal how many will never get the chance to play Tempest 3000 as it's the absolute pinnacle of the Tempest template. 2000 on the Atari Jaguar is cleaner to look at, and certainly beats it in gameplay terms if you can source a rotary controller, but 3000 is more immersive, and that's where the magic lies. As soon as it loads you're hit with an explosion of neon pyrotechnics and a deep, manacing soundtrack that combines dance/rave, sci-fi and 80s videogaming. Add some of the tightest gaming mechanics ever programmed and it all comes together to create an experience where you simply become unaware of anything outside of the game. And that's what Tempest 3000 is all about; the experience. There's nothing else like it.",1259625600,2,834,4.798611111111111
7928587,5,B00004ZETT,"Tempest 3000 is not about polygons-per-second, it is not about realistic graphics, it is not about virtual reality. Think about any buzzword game publishers come up with to sell their game, and I will more or less guarantee you that Tempest 3000 doesn't have a whole lot to do with them. Why? Because, when you get right down to it, Tempest 3000 is about game play. Sure, the visuals may look great and the music may sound great, but that's just the icing on the cake, worthless if the game itself is not fun to play. Needless to say, T3K is fun, with just enough frustration to keep you playing. Control with the D-pad, like the Jaguar version, is good, but if you're one of the old-school arcade junkies who played the original as it was meant to, you might find it lacking. As far as difficulty goes, it's a mixed bag, but it's almost all hard. Once you've gotten into the groove though, it won't be uncommon to zoom through level after level, only to be stopped cold by a particularly nasty web, but that's where the enjoyment comes in. Half the satisfaction comes from getting past that one web that's been giving you fits, conquering that level you've been failing on for weeks. That's what keeps you playing, that's what keeps you into the game. Tempest 3000 is a finely crafted, highly-tweaked model of what gaming should be, and as far as NUON is concerned, it's *THE* killer app.

Tempest. The very name conjures up images of vector graphics and rotary controls, the arcade memories of yesteryear. Indeed, for the older gamer, Tempest 3000 is the culmination of childhood memories, matured & updated with a more electronic edge. For those lucky enough to play the game on the Jaguar (I'll even count the Saturn & PC ports, or Tempest X on the PS), this is the next step, as it advances the game play, look & sound to an all new level. The YaK has made the updating of classics into an art, an art that no one else has yet to master as he has. For many, this is the ultimate kind of gaming, the kind of challenge that gamers used to spend quarter after quarter on, for bragging rights, for high score, for fun. As is emblazoned across the T3K case, ''Easy to Learn. Difficult to Master.'' For this gamer, that's more than enough to provide hour after hour of gaming at its best.

Tempest 3000 isn't the kind of game that comes out everyday, and to be honest, it really shouldn't be, if for no other reason to prevent sensory overload. The gaming industry has become a monster of sorts, as what is 'good' has now been defined by the company rather than the consumer. Substance gives way to style, which is more often than not, tasteless. Tempest 3000 is an exception to the rule, an old fashioned game crafted by a single master of the trade, a game with plenty of style, but not at the expense of its substance, which is at its core. This is gaming at its best...",1198886400,4,2872,4.447817836812145
7928588,1,B00004ZETT,"Everywhere you look, you'll see extremely favorable reviews for this game (at least from the few who have NUON) and I'm here to tell you not to believe everything you read.  If you have or have played Tempest 2000 on the Atari Jaguar, do yourself a favor and stick with that version!  It is by far easier to play with MUCH crisper visuals.
As it is, Tempest 3000 is a mess of blurry, mutating visuals with enemies that are often very difficult to see.  Many claim that this soupy, tripped out effect was exactly what the game's developer, Jeff Minter, wanted to acheive.  Well, he succeeded at a cost of alienating all but the most hardcore of his Llamasoft gamer cult.  The level of difficulty borders on the ridiculous at times.  You'll find yourself cruising past the first few stages (webs) only to suddenly find yourself stuck on one particular stage where you lose all of your reserve lives.  Make one careless mistake and you'll have to replay the entire stage over again!  Poor, poor game design to say the least!  Only the most hardcore Tempest freaks will appreciate this kind of frustration-inducing gameplay.
Then there are the plentiful strange references to sheep and various other animals that seems to be a staple of Minter's bizarre games.  You'll hear sheep bleating and see imagery of various farm animals in the game and throughout the manual.  Fine for the hardcore, but somewhat disturbing to the rest of us mainstream gamers.  The sound is rather bland...the techno tracks are OK, but the effects stink.  And then there are the bouts of slowdown whenever the screen gets crowded...the frame rate drops to about half its normal rate which can get annoying on the harder levels.
Is the game a total loss?  I believe yes.  I own every NUON game released on the platform and Tempest3000 is by far the worst and least played title in my collection.  If Minter would have toned down the difficulty and the soupy, blurry graphics, then I would give the game a 3.  The Jag version of Tempest 2000 was less ambitious and as a result, it is the better Tempest game.  As it stands, you'd be better off buying Merlin Racing or hunting down a copy of Iron Soldier 3 if you must play games on your NUON.
Why are other claiming that this is one of the greatest games they've ever played?  I have no idea, but I believe it is out of consideration for Jeff Minter who has really not had a hit game since Tempest 2000 and are able to look past the glaring shortcomings that his games seem to be riddled with.  In closing, stay far away from Tempest 3000!",1029196800,3,2559,4.557986870897155
7928589,5,B00004ZETT,"This is one of those hot/cold games: you either get it or you don't. If you were born before 1972, or can't get enough of ""classic"" games like the original arcade Tempest, this game might be enough to induce you to buy a Nuon-capable machine along with a compatible joystick before they become impossible to find.
That said, if you're more interested in state of the art graphics, or a game with a story or an ending, or you haven't played any arcade game older than Street Fighter II, steer clear of this and get something for the Playstation 2, XBOX, or GameCube instead. This is an abstract, highly stylized game that the younger set may not like.  It may also seen repetitive to do level after level of shooting nasties, and if you don't like the idea of repeating a failed level until you get it right, try something else.
This disc, along with the similarly trippy Virtual Light Machine included on the hardware, is the reason I bought a Nuon machine. It's full of swirling lights and colors, non-stop techno music, and fast and furious gameplay that is best appreciated on a big screen with the lights down and the sound UP. Its pick-up-and-play simplicity is straight from the video arcades of the 1980s.
The now-bankrupt NUON company didn't release much interesting software or hardware, but this game is a masterpiece. The nation of Wales should designate programmer Jeff ""Yak"" Minter a national treasure.",1028332800,7,1415,4.752032520325203
7928590,1,B00004ZETT,"For a game whose gameplay is avaliable in many freeware offerings, this mostly offers just eye candy. (Albeit *very* pretty eye candy.) If you've already purchased a NUON enabled DVD player, and you come across this in the bargain bin, it wouldn't be a bad pick if you liked the original Tempest. But, as a fan of the original, this wasn't worth full price to me.",993340800,3,363,4.515151515151516
7928591,5,B00004ZETT,"This is a masterpiece, as well as in terms of gameplay but also in the graphics-department - not to forget the excellent music and awesome sound-effects ! A shooter in it's purest form, with almost perfect optimized balanced gameplay. Graphic effects you won't see on any other platforms anytime soon. Surely one of the greatest games of all time ! There are three reasons why I've got a NUON: Tempest 3000, VLM and DVD of course. (Can't wait what Mr. Minter is up to next)",985132800,2,473,4.576470588235294
7928592,3,B00004ZETT,"Yes Tempest 3000 does have incredible graphics and great sound, but if you think you're buying a children's game, this is not Nintendo. Buy Merlin Racing for the kids.",978566400,4,167,4.793103448275862
7928593,5,B00004ZETT,"Tempest 3000 by Jeff Minter is finally here, and it was well worth the wait. The graphics are about what you expect if you've seen the NUON demo, only the frame rate is much higher. Webs pulsate, twist, & turn, plasma is abundant and everything has an altogether nice look to it. Vectors are actually sharp and well-defined, while the plasma effects give an ethereal appearance to it all, along with the procedural textures of the web. Gameplay is refined, and a step above Tempest 2000, its predecessor on the Atari Jaguar, with the addition of guided shots and a now limited jump, which makes everything a lot more tense. If NUON has a killer-app, this is it.",977529600,9,661,4.610169491525424
