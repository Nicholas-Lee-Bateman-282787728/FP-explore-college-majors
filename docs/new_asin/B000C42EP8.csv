It had all sorts of great information but this particular dvd did skip. And it skipped the first time I ever watched it. I don't know if I got an old dvd or what. I thought I brought it new! Nevertheless, I'm still glad I got it!",1226188800,,360,4.1571428571428575
8095677,5,B000C42EP8,"Its an excellent DVD, with lots of neutral/unbiased information. It takes the form of mini dialogs presented by actual law students from different law schools , including Harvard, UCLA, Pepperdine, Brooklyn's law etc..and even these students some look serious, some are laid back. So it truly gives you personal opinions on each different subject

To make it short, you can really learn so much from this dvd which you can watch in 2 hours . If you wanna go the hard way, you are welcomed to buy some books each containing at least hundreds of pages, just to get the same info.

NOTE: this DVD is mostly helpful if you are thinking or deciding to attend law school and you need to get a glimpse of what its like. But once you are studying in law school, I don't think this DVD is helpful anymore.",1214870400,,796,4.482758620689655
8095678,5,B000C42EP8,"I've been doing alot of thinking/research about law school, but I learned some new things by watching the DVD.  Alot of the stuff out there is geared towards, ""explore law school,"" or ""why you might want to go to law school,""  but this is a good resource for students already committed to it as well.

The format is ""chapters"" focused on a question, followed by student responses
It includes responses on every question from students from the top schools (Harvard, Berkeley), as well as 2nd, 3rd, and 4th tier schools, so the answers are applicable to basically everyone.  The best part about it is that there isn't that much BS.

It also includes a ""minority report"" for every question.  It gives you the ""popular"" advice, and then has students who'd advise against it respond and give their justification.",1186444800,5,807,4.811594202898551
