8105917,1,B000E5MI10,With all do respect you should probably do a little research before you try to sell a product for 7 times its average estimated value. Try looking for what you have here on ebay. You can find sets with 5 or mor dvds for $19.99 to $50.00 max. Its a childrens christian program mabye you might try watching a couple episodes. Because If you are in full knowledge of the value of this product then you deffinetly need Jesus! LoL!,1388880000,,426,4.3375
8105918,5,B000E5MI10,"I'm really glad they decided to release these television episodes on DVD, I only wish they'd start to release the rest of the episodes and make a complete series.  My kids love watching them!  While they are no replacement for an actual bible and a family worship time, they are great for families that are looking for decent television shows that avoid the godless shows you see on TV today.

Only complaint, there is no babysitter ""play all"" on the main screen, so someone is going to have to start each individual episode.",1225065600,3,525,4.623655913978495
8105919,4,B000E5MI10,Both kids enjoy these videos they are 12 & 4. They do not like them as well as the flying house. However these are right up there with the videos they want to watch the most. My 4 yr old was in the hospital for a week these videos were watched more than any thing else along with the flying house.,1204070400,2,297,3.8852459016393444
8105920,5,B000E5MI10,I grew up watching Super Book on TV.  I ordered the series becasue I want my children to get the same experience that I did.  These shows helped me learn and appreciate the differnet stories in the Bible; eventually laying the foundation for my faith as an adult Catholic.,1192924800,,272,4.530612244897959
8105921,5,B000E5MI10,I've waited a long time to see these shows again.  I grew up watching them and learned much of the bible from them.  They have transfered to DVD with good picture and sound quality.  I believe children can learn of these great bible stories for years to come from SuperBook.,1168214400,,274,4.44
8105922,5,B000E5MI10,"Now remember, this is a 1980s anime cartoon. Despite its age however, I still really enjoy this show. My grandfather used to record these to VHS off of TBN for me to watch (along with The Flying House). I don't know how much children will enjoy them today with all the digital characters on tv, but you can be rest assured I will surely try to get my kids to watch it one day!",1144713600,,376,4.094594594594595
