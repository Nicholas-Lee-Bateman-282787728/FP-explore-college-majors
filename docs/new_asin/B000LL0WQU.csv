8198242,2,B000LL0WQU,"This video was completely the opposite of what I thought it would be.  My husband and I always watch the Travel Channel and see these exciting shows about cruises and that's what I thought this was.  I almost turned it off after the first 10 minutes.  It's basically a slow-moving documentary about a Carnival cruise, narrated by a monotonous voice that never shows excitement.  Most of the people on the cruise don't look very excited either!  I am trying to decide which cruise line to use when my husband and I go on our cruise and this DVD made us very wary of using Carnival.  I wish I had saved my money and just continued watching the Travel Channel.  At least it's entertaining.",1193097600,3,686,4.528455284552845
