1403202,5,B000057BLC,"This is one of my favorite exercise routines. It can be used as a 20 min., 40 min, or a full hour aerobic routine. The dance steps are a little tricky, but after a few times, even a klutz like me can master it. The aerobics are based on fast and slower blasts so you can build stamina. I found it great when I was out of shape, and great when I was in shape. It can be done low impact, higher impact, or a mixture of both. I love Jane Fondas videos and WISH THEY WOULD BE TRANSFERRED TO DVD!",1335657600,7,491,3.871287128712871
1403203,4,B000057BLC,"I have been looking for this for a long time.
I used to own a copy of the VHS when it was first sold.
After a few years it would not work anymore and I was looking for a copy of it since.
I am glad I found it on Amazon.
I only wished this was transferred on to DVD.",1267920000,4,265,3.433333333333333

I have about 10 of her workouts from cardio to weight training and have lost over 25 pound and am getting in great shape from the privacy of my own home.  I am loving getting definition in my legs and arms again at 55+ years old.  Thanks Jane!!

Her attention to form and her continuous encouragement is always motivating and missing on a lot of workout videos I have done.  Also she goes at the right pace to allow you to continue focusing on the right form.  I had a personal trainer once tell me that it was better to do one rep right then 10 reps wrong so I consider doing exercise correctly the most important part of the workout and Jane is in agreement and her continuous reminders are a big help.  I can't recommend her workouts enough.  They aren't easy but well worth it.",1515456000,,873,4.216867469879518

We know all the words by heart and enjoy every second of this exercise tape.  The service was wonderful, fast and the tape came in perfect condition.  Will use again!",1392681600,3,296,4.327272727272727
7932995,5,B000057BLC,"Sure, the workout clothes are from the eighties, and the banter between Jane Fonda and her exercise buds is a little cheesy...but, it's a fun and invigorating video. Plus, there are adult women and men in the exercise group of a variety of ages, from their early twenties to well over fifty. And, a representative from the younger age group shows the high impact, rigorous exercise mode, and a representative from the older group shows the less intense, low impact exercise mode (which is great for people just starting aerobic exercise, people recovering from injury, or people with weight problems who are over 45). You have a lot of variety in the way you can follow the video.

I can't recommend it enough!",1373328000,3,710,4.772357723577236
