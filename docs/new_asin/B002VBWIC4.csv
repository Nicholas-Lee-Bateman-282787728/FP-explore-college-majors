3994319,5,B002VBWIC4,"Season 5 is my favorite Hey Arnold! season, so the last episode drives me nuts! The 1st movie was supposed to followed by The Jungle Movie where everything is resolved. Nickelodeon owes it to the fans!",1294876800,,201,4.611111111111111
3994320,5,B002VBWIC4,"I loved watching Hey Arnold as a child in the late nineties/early two thousands. Hey Arnold is so much better than Cat Scratch or Penguins of Madagascar, or quite frankly any recent Nickelodeon shows. I miss these shows. They should also put the Wild Thornberries out of DVD as well, that was a good one too. In regards to the Hey Arnold DVD set, I was very pleased with it, it's perfect. Everything arrived in one piece and I have no complaints in regards to shipping or anything like that. You'll love these a lot.",1272067200,7,516,4.442105263157894
3994321,5,B002VBWIC4,"I preordered seasons 4 and 5 of Hey Arnold and received them on schedule.  I've tried them in my Panasonic BD60 bluray player, and they work fine.  The images are sharp and the colors bright.  No problems whatsoever.  I love finally being able to see shows I missed from the last two seasons, and eagerly await the chance to order season three, with my all-time favorite episode, School Play (where Helga must confess her secret love for Arnold to be able to play opposite him as Juliet in the school play!)  I love the wry, subtle humor and the strong characterizations that really make you care about the characters of this series, even the ""bully"" Helga.  I also own the first two seasons, which I watched on an old Toshiba dvd player with no problems.  The only thing I would wish for is subtitles, for those times when you don't quite catch everything people say--although the voice track of Hey Arnold is much better in general than a lot of shows when it comes to clarity.  I just bought a long-awaited favorite old movie of mine from Amazon called The Flight of Dragons (burn-on-demand) and while the movie itself is a magnificent quest, you have to have your remote ready to adjust the volume between the grand, loud background music and shouting scenes, and other scenes where the characters are speaking very softly.",1261094400,,1327,4.665236051502146
3994322,5,B002VBWIC4,"Hey Arnold! Season 5 contains four dvd's,

This is an Amazon exclusive and won't be sold in stores. Amazon worked out a deal with nickelodeon to ""Burn on demand"" meaning upon receiving an order that Amazon will create the dvd and insert then ship it to the buyer... I'm very thankful to Amazon for bringing back some of the excellent nicktoons I enjoyed back in the nineties but after watching these Hey Arnold season sets I feel kinda sad that the series was cancelled and we will never have any new episodes. Hey Arnold is a classic and I'll really miss Arnold, Gerald, Sid, Stinky, Helga, Rhonda, Grandpa Phil, Oscar and everyone else.

Audio and picture quality in these dvd's is very good.

3994323,5,B002VBWIC4,"I was so happy to purchase Hey Arnold! seasons 1 and 2 from Amazon's Made On Demand Create-a-space. I wasn't sure if they'd continue with the releases but am excited to see that they've released Hey Arnold! seasons 4 and 5 (*And since I initially wrote this they've also released Season Three!!!). It's great to have 2 more seasons of this great series being made available on DVD for fans. Season 5 should contain the following 15 episodes, some consisting of two eleven minute halves and others being a full twenty-two minutes which makes up 26 stories in all:

86 Stuck in a Tree/Rhonda Goes Broke
87 Beaned/Old Iron Man
88 Arnold Visits Arnie/Chocolate Boy
89 Harold Vs. Patty/Rich Guy
90 April Fool's Day
91 Gerald's Game/Fishing Trip
92 Married
93 On the Lamb/Family Man
94 The Racing Mule/Curly's Girl
95 The Journal (1)
96 The Journal (2)
97 Timberly Loves Arnold/Eugene, Eugene!
98 Simmon's Documentary/Big Bob's Crisis
99 Ghost Bride/Gerald Vs. Jamie O.
100 Grandpa's Packard/Phoebe's Little Problem

Great episodes this season continue to focus on the dynamic between Arnold and Helga with her secret crush on him. Such as April Fool's Day and fan favorite Married. I personally enjoy the real emotion to be found in the silly premise of what ended up as the series finale, Phoebe's Little Problem. Also enjoyable are episodes that focus on Arnold learning about his absent parents and where they may have gone such as The Journal parts 1 & 2.

The sense of humor in these 'older' shows can play to a more immature childish sense of humor, guy gets hurt or bodily function, but for the most part what I respect about nineties television is that children were never told when to laugh. The jokes were simply presented to us and the character's played things pretty straight, never hitting us over the head, helping our generation to understand irony and the actual art of sarcasm. Something I feel is lost in most children's television nowadays. Children are now told when to laugh by laugh track or by the characters playing it so over the top, it leaves youth today not understanding the subtlety of good humor.

Don't worry about the quality of these DVD-R. I own the first two seasons of this show as well as seasons of Rugrats and Doug on Amazon DVD-R and they play great on all my DVD players. I tend to be uptight about things being quality and have never been bothered by these sets, the shows look as good as when it originally aired in the nineties. The sets do have simple DVD menus, packaging and artwork but it all looks nice enough and gets the job done. My only issue with these sets, me being a purist, is that I'd prefer the option of watching the opening theme before every episode but it only plays before the first on each disc. They do this to preserve the quality of the episodes due to compression issues that could arise and I'm aware most people skip openings anyway, so it's forgivable. Also, don't expect any sort of special features, just the episodes themselves.

I can't reccommend this enough to fans of great animated television and of children's programming that's entertaining but based in a reality with real lessons and morals to be found. While it's upsetting that these older Nickelodeon series aren't being released on proper studio made DVD sets I thank Amazon for at least making it possible for fans like me to own these episodes on DVD in decent quality and proper order. Hopefully good sales on these Amazon Made On Demand sets can still convince Nickelodeon to consider proper season releases of their old series with special features, but until the day Nickelodeon realizes the cash to be made in the remarketing of their nineties shows on DVD I'm more than happy to give my business to Amazon and buy these sets. FIVE STARS for Arnold's fifth and final season, thanks for your time.",1257984000,14,3839,4.706845238095238

3994329,5,B002VBWIC4,"I suppose it's the last season of the show, but the creative juices are still flowing, and here's a few favourites that make this season worth the money:
""Rhonda Goes Broke"" - The Lloyds go completely broke and have to live at Arnold's house. Rhonda has to learn to adjust, which she eventually does. It's a really fun episode, and although Rhonda does get annoying at times, the way she redeems herself briefly shows a new resourceful side to her.
""Married"" - After Rhonda pairs Arnold and Helga up 110 times in her origami marriage predictor, both dream about what life would be like married to each other. Helga's dream is a bit idealised, but very fun to watch (although according to my boyfriend, Arnold is scary in the dream) and Arnold's nightmare is also very enjoyable, as it shows he knows that Helga cares about him deep down, and that he knows how much of a mess her life at home is.
""Arnold Visits Arnie"" - Arnold goes to visit his cousin Arnie, and meets his friends, who are mirror images of his own friends. Especially notable for Lulu, Lila's image, who like-likes Arnold and is a trampy girl. Even more notable is the implications, again, that Arnold knows Helga likes him through Hilda, Helga's mirror image, who is nice, pretty, sweet, poetic, but has a crush on Arnie. Also an interesting love shape, carried on from ""Weird Cousin"" which had Arnold>Lila>Arnie>Helga>Arnold, while this one has Arnie>Lulu>Arnold>Hilda>Arnie. Some elements are creepy, but it's a truly great episode.
""Beaned"" - After Arnold accidentally causes Helga to have amnesia, he takes care of her. Once Helga's okay again, she hears about this and fakes amnesia so Arnold will keep looking after her. Very funny for Helga's ignorance of implicit knowledge (which should still have been intact realistically, explicit knowledge like her name and facts are the only things that should have been missing).
""Curly's Girl"" - One of my all-time favourites. Rhonda stains her mother's birthday present coat and Curly's the only one who can help her out in time, but in return, Rhonda has to pretend to be his girlfriend for a week. A cringe-worthy episode, but a truly funny and great one, nonetheless, and also has a great ending where Curly redeems himself by freeing Rhonda.
Other great episodes include ""Ghost Bride"", ""Helga's Masquerade"" and ""Phoebe's Little Problem"". Also notable for ""The Journal"" which would have led into the unreleased ""Jungle Movie"" and although I consider ""April Fools' Day"" to be a bit boring, no Arnold/Helga fan should have to miss out on the scene when Arnold and Helga tango, as Craig Bartlett has implied that Arnold was actually flirting with Helga.
On the whole, definitely worth the price. BUY IT!",1387065600,,2722,4.893939393939394

Hey Arnold is a definite classic, and well-worth the time to buy and show to the kids of 2000. Its enjoyable for the whole family.

The picture quality is superb, which was surprising, and the box set is secure and slim.

Season 5 features some of my favorite episodes such as:

April Fools Day: (arguably my favorite episode of the series) Where pranks pit Arnold and Helga against one another.
Married: Arnold and Helga are paired together for marriage by Rhonda and her fortune teller.
Gerald vs. Jamie O.: Two brothers in love with the same girl. Cuteness abounds.

Like the other seasons it gives screen time to all of the characters.

Definitely recommend.",1297123200,,773,4.647058823529412
