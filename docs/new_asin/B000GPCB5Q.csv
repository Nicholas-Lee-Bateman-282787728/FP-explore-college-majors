8133729,5,B000GPCB5Q,This account is very well done. It is humbling to remember this date and to the sacrifices many made for our country.,1413158400,,117,4.363636363636363
8133730,5,B000GPCB5Q,"While this movie covers a highly emotional topic, it is done with professionalism, attention to detail, and dignity for all involved.  There is no sensationalism, but rather facts, allowing the viewer to determine his own emotional response.  I have already recommended it to numerous people.",1252108800,5,292,5.466666666666667
8133731,5,B000GPCB5Q,"This was a difficult program to watch but the story that it tells is a powerful story that needs to be told.

The recreation of what may have happened on United Flight 93 is based on evidence from the 91/11 Commission Report, voice recorderings and interviews with the family members who talked with people on the ill fated and historic flight.  While we will never know the full and complete story of what all happened on that day on American Airlines Flight 11, United Flight 175, American Airlines Flight 77 and United Flight 93.  This story is as close as we'll will ever likely get.

Watch it to honor the memory of those who died.",1251590400,5,636,4.504347826086956
