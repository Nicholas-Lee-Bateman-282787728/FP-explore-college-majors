3744704,2,B001P9N99O,"From Within has an interesting enough premise and gets off to a good enough start, but it winds up amounting basically to nothing much at all.  Elizabeth Rice stars as Lindsay, a young girl living in an ultra conservative Christian town.  A wave of mysterious suicides starts to plague the town, and it soon becomes apparent that vengeance is being wrecked upon the town by otherworldly forces, drawn from something terrible that happened years before.  What makes From Within interesting enough is the examination it gives of the small-minded, Christian-based town it takes place in, but it really doesn't do too much with it.  It also doesn't make the kind of use that it could have with a cast that includes Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles' Thomas Dekker, as well as small roles for Adam Goldberg, Jared Harris, Laura Allen, Steven Culp, and Rumer Willis; of which only Goldberg does anything remotely memorable.  The moments that are supposed to be suspenseful fall flat, and the film's conclusion only ends up throwing one twist after another at the viewer.  All in all, From Within is loaded with wasted potential, and while it isn't the worst entry in this year's After Dark Horrorfest lineup, it definitely isn't the most worthwhile endeavor either.",1240876800,,1265,5.0
3744705,4,B001P9N99O,"Who would win in the battle between in the battle between light and dark? Where will the battle be fought? These are the questions asked by Phedon Papamichael in his new film From Within. While the film does tread some well-worn territory, the movie is atmospheric enough - and the performances are good enough - for the viewer to be able to overlook the tired tropes and enjoy a solid independent horror film.

From Within begins with a suicide, followed immediately by the death of the person who witnessed it, followed by many more deaths. The residents of the ultra-religious town begin to suspect Aidan (Thomas Dekker), the son of the woman they killed for practicing witchcraft. But who's really to blame for the string of deaths, and what price must be paid in order to stop them.

As a veteran of the last three ""8 Films to Die For"" festivals, I wasn't expecting much from this film. The annual horror festival is synonymous with boring, derivative crap. You know it's sad when the best film to come out of the previous two outings was Nightmare Man, a C-grade schlock fest saved by corny acting and Tiffany Sheppis' [...]. So you can understand my trepidation coming into this movie - especially after having the derivative Dying Breed a few weeks ago. Luckily, I was in good hands.

From Within begins shakily. It's difficult to decipher what's going on at first. The film simply transitions from one deadly set piece to the next without any apparent connection. Only when ""final girl"" Lindsay (Elizabeth Rice) decides to befriend the gothy-looking Aidan do the pieces of the plot begin to come together. Besides the foibles with the plot, other things fall a little flat. I  wasn't too bothered by the whole people-getting-killed-by-evil-doppelgangers aspect of the story, but I felt it would have been creepier if we couldn't see the force killing these people.

Despite the flaws, the film does a lot right. The religious fanatics weren't too over the top. You could definitely imagine these nut-jobs living in a red state near you (hell, there are plenty of them in Arizona). Also, the ending was note-for-note perfect. The film's credit sequence - a grim version of the apocalypse - is creepier than most of the horror films that came out in 2008.

As another entry in the horror genre, From Within is a competent and engaging movie that's just a little rough around the edges. As an entry in the ""8 Films to Die For"" library, it's a near masterpiece. While you should definitely skip the majority of the films in this year's collection, From Within is a must see.",1240876800,8,2579,4.758389261744966
3744706,4,B001P9N99O,"In my opinion, this latest series of films in the ""After Dark Horrorfest"" series is much better than their predecessors, and ""From Within"" continues that trend.  The film is a cross between ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" and ""The Grudge,"" with elements of revenge and a curse.  The movie takes place in a small town, where so-called Christian zealots hold cult-like sway over many of the people, with one notable exception: a family of wiccans (for lack of a better term).  In an event prior to the start of the movie, a woman was burned alive because the religious townspeople suspected her - without any real evidence - in the death of a child.  Events are soon set in motion, resulting in a curse being placed upon the town for their evil and unjust act.  The film is really worth a watch, and the end has a really good twist!

The acting isn't too bad for a lower-budge movie.  Thomas Dekker, from ""The Sarah Conner Chronicles,"" is one of the main actors in the film.

There are some stereotypes (ignorant, hypocritical, over-zealous Christians as well as the ever persecuted wiccans) used in the film, but I don't think that they detract from the film too much.  Again, if you liked ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" and ""The Grudge"" or just movies about vengeful spirits and curses, then this is a good film to check out.  Enjoy...",1240099200,13,1324,4.619658119658119
3744707,5,B001P9N99O,"This movie was easily one of the best of the years ""8 to die for"". The opening sequence is so simple but shocking it haunts you for quite some time.

3744708,4,B001P9N99O,I usually enjoy most of the After Dark Horror Fest movies and I really liked this one. It was an intersting little tale that would be great to share by a camp fire. I told my friend the story and that night she was so creeped-out that she called me saying she was afraid to look in her mirror or behind her. I found it an easy and eerie story to tell. I love movies like this one!,1238976000,,380,3.8846153846153846
3744709,5,B001P9N99O,"I've watched 5 of these ""8 films to die for."" This one is the best to date. Characters you care about, and a wicked story.",1238889600,,122,3.92
3744710,5,B001P9N99O,"It may sound strange but I didn't like this movie at first. It wasn't until the next day when it was still on my mind that I realized just how good it is. My one complaint is that it's low on gore, in fact I don't understand the R rating. Maybe the language. It has all the elements of Twilight minus the vampires and the suckiness - a girl in need of saving, guy with a secret - but wait, it also has substance and a really cool twist.
I read a bunch of reviews that noted the first and last scenes - they are totally unique - like breath-taking (although too much hype will kill it for you) - and make up for the slow parts in the middle. The acting is really good from a good looking yet `believeable' cast. The guy from Sarah Connor mumbles his way through the movie in much the same way as he does on TV, and the main girl is really awesome. I pretty much recognized everyone in it, even the sea captain from Benjamin Button playing Rumer Willis' dad. I've read people complain about the portrayal of the `religious nuts' and the weird thing is that they seem even more believable and real. I think that's the point.

All in all, I'd probably give it four stars, but I noticed some hater only gave it two for lack of gore and I don't think it's fair. It's a really good movie that makes you think. In fact it holds up as a regular movie. I kind of recommend it for the beginning and end alone.",1238716800,,1398,4.102189781021898
3744711,4,B001P9N99O,"This one was easily the best movie of this year's entries. It had solid acting, story and a cool twist ending. Definitely check this one out.",1238112000,2,141,4.461538461538462
3744712,4,B001P9N99O,"I was a bit surprised by how much I liked this movie. I don't usually write reviews but I have been thinking about it a lot since I first saw it. It is scary (but not straight horror), and has one of the best opening scenes in any movie. The characters are good, I liked the main girl, she seemed real. I didn't like the emo dude from the Sarah Connor Chronicles too much, but thought Adam Goldberg was awesome, (I recognized his face, but had to look him up on IMDB). The movie works and I am definitely buying the DVD as part of my horror collection.

I do feel that there were places that could have been better - a bit more gore maybe, faster paced in places but I want to give the film makers the break of knowing that this movie manages to be very successful without a huge studio budget. In fact it's good enough (and as good as and more thought provoking then many of those studio movies like Twilight or Prom Night) that I've been asking myself why it didn't get it's own release?).

Without giving away too much of the plot, the movie takes place in a small town where the inhabitants start dying one by one apparently by suicide - shot in the head, throat cut, hanging, car accident etc. But all of them complain of being followed by someone before their death. The trick is revealed when we find out who the mysterious follower is.

Many of the townspeople are evangelicals (and this is the most frightening part because I feel like it may actually be true of some middle American towns). But this warning about the evils of religion is clearly a statement against intolerance rather than anything else, so I don't see that the film would be offensive to any real Christians (of which I am one).

The theme of suicide is dealt with in the movie, better than how it was handled in ""The Happening""  and that managed to find it's way on to 3000 screens.

All in all, I found this to be a good solid movie of substance,  It certainly got me thinking.",1238025600,3,1958,4.304347826086956
3744713,3,B001P9N99O,"""From Within"" isn't all that successful as a horror movie, or even as a regular movie. It is, however, often times very interesting in its approach, shifting back and forth between a commentary on religious tolerance and a vengeance fable that pulls no punches regardless of denomination. It's interesting and problematic, because by the end of the film, the Godless pagans look just as guilty as the fundamentalist Christians. In other words, I no longer could determine which side represented good and which side represented evil. Maybe that's the point of this film: That religion is dangerous no matter what god you happen to pray to. Or maybe it has nothing to do with attacking any particular religion; maybe it's just a way to make the overused idea of supernatural forces wreaking havoc seem original.

Whatever. What I know for sure is that, even though ""From Within"" had some genuinely engaging moments, it still didn't quite live up to its potential. Consider the fact that it takes place one of those small Southern towns where the vast majority take faith in God a little too seriously; while effective as a plot device, the truth is that we've seen too many horror films about communities with frightening mob-like mentalities. There's also the fact that religion is generalized to the point of turning virtually everyone into a caricature. The only neutral character is a teenager named Lindsay (Elizabeth Rice), who seems to recognize that, in spite of her own faith, people should be allowed to worship as they see fit.

The story: A string of deaths are plaguing the God-fearing town of Grovestown. At first, they all appear to be a part of a suicide pact; it begins when a teenager named Sean (Shiloh Fernandez) blows his brains out right in front of his girlfriend, Natalie (Rumor Willis), who later kills herself in her father's shop right before her father hangs himself. As more people die, the townsfolk begin to fear that it's not a pact, but a curse. Here enters a brooding teenager named Aidan (Thomas Dekker), the son of a woman who practiced witchcraft before her untimely death; when he's physically beaten by Lindsay's pious boyfriend, Dylan (Kelly Blatz), Lindsay takes pity on Aidan and takes him home. It there she learns more about his mother, whose demise may have been at the hands of extremist vigilantes seeking revenge for the death of a young boy.

The character development is interesting, if a little one-dimensional. Take Lindsay's stepmother, Trish (Laura Allen), an alcoholic who seems detached from everything. When she's not passed out on the couch in front of the TV, she throws herself at her boyfriend, Roy (Adam Goldberg), an angry kind of guy whose wardrobe always consists of dirty undershirts and baseball caps. Dylan's father, Pastor Joe (Steven Culp), is introduced giving a sermon, and we immediately sense that every word coming out of his mouth is laced with hypocrisy. At the other end of the religious spectrum, there's Aidan's cousin, Sadie (Margo Harshman), who deeply distrusts Lindsay simply for being an outsider. She only wears black, and she can never speak to anyone without copping a seriously off-putting attitude. She supplies one of the films best moments of humor; as Lindsay and Aidan talk seriously about what's happening in town, Sadie sits at a piano, hitting dramatic chords.

I've said plenty about the characters, and that may not be a good sign because this is supposed to be a horror movie. What about the horror, anyway? There are some great atmospheric moments during the suicide scenes, in which the victims see ghastly apparitions of themselves. This obviously plays into the film's title, suggestive of the inner demons we all have. Exactly what brought on this curse is something I leave for you to find out. I will say that it isn't all that surprising given the vindictive nature of the story.

That brings me to the disturbing ending, which is satisfying in that twisted, downbeat, horror-movie way that can't easily be described. I use the word ""satisfying"" reluctantly, mostly because I didn't like the fact that I felt any sense of satisfaction. It's not a pleasant ending--it's ugly and mean-spirited, and it actually made me rethink how I felt about certain characters. Then again, maybe that was the intended effect. Director Phedon Papamichael seems to have labored under the belief that duplicity wears many masks, none more convincing than that of righteousness. If that was the message of the film, I can't help but question why it had to be sent in the guise of a horror story. A simple parable would have been just fine. (No, I'm not making comparisons to ""Doubt,"" which is anything but a horror film, although it is worth noting that it was able to send the exact same message without resorting to supernatural occurrences and grizzly death scenes.) In spite of its flaws, I'm well aware that ""From Within"" was made for a very select horror-friendly audience, and I have no doubt that they will respond to this film.",1231632000,9,5022,4.9174528301886795

3744772,2,B001P9N99O,"A solid second-rate made-for-TV-quality indie teen-horror-romance ruined by the small town redneck religious cliche. It should be funny to see Adam Goldberg playing a redneck, but it loses its comic appeal once you realize that he and/or the filmmakers probably think that it's actually a representative depiction of pretty much everything between LA and NY. I don't want to get too political, but this is how Trump got elected... a lot of folks just got sick of seeing small town life caricatured like this, and spite overcame good sense. It's not like this is the only movie that stereotypes and demonizes rural and/or Christian people (probably 2/3rds of horror movies rely on this trope), but the actual horror movie part just isn't good enough to justify the foolish one-sided setting and characters.

Ironically, the prejudice is at least partially based on contempt for small town folks' religious beliefs, but the entire story depends upon the supernatural. Without spoiling anything,those crazy stupid Christians actually end up being mostly right about the source and nature of the evil... which, I'm sure, is not the message that the filmmakers wanted to convey. Because let's face it, if there actually was a bunch of evil witches running around cursing people, you kinda need the religious leaders and violent rednecks to take matters into their own hands. It's only the lack of the supernatural that makes those people misguided in the real world (in the same way that impaling people with wooden stakes is a horrible idea UNLESS there actually are vampires).",1480291200,,1573,5.120622568093385

3744786,4,B001P9N99O,"Good Creepy Horror Movie. I'm a fan of supernatural and/or horror movies, this is a mix of both. Is it in the top 10, no, but it had good actors showing real emotion, an angle of horror that I haven't seen before and stayed away from major blood and gore allowing the scene setups and viewer expectations and fears to amplify and uniquefy ( uniquefy ?) the thrills along the way. Some cited they could do without the teen falling in love scenes which seemed typical of many movies today, and then there was the long list stereotypes characters being the sinful preacher, the redneck boy friend of the lead teen girls actresses  mother both a religious hick, drunk and semi off the scales, the bully boys chasing the deep down good bad boy. Yet beyond all these sins the characters are believable and put it all together  to create one nice quiet god fearing small town turned into a slow and climax building horror fest starring themselves.

I just watch movies for the fun of it and dob't try to over analyze each character, plot and sub-plot, if thats your gig you probably hate 99% of horror movies and 100% of any non Sundance festival movie. If you like average horror/supernatural  movies you will love this one. I'm also a fan of really cheesy films, like any SiFi channel movie because they are fun.

Like, are they just hiring people off the streets???  Anyway, the show went along and the ""Big Bad"" was introduced and although the makeup effects were pretty good, it was kind of a let down.  Big Bad was creepy, but a lot of the other ""plot points"" made that null.  The teenage love crap was annoying and unrealistic.  Possibly spoilery after this:  The way to end the curse was made for drama obviously.  It was so predictable that the main was going to get ""infected"" and the boy was going to fall for her and try to save her from death.  His consequences to end the curse were also predictable.  It was obvious that he didn't shoot himself even though the dude that did shoot him was at an angle that he couldn't possibly shoot him in the chest.  The ending was obviously going to end the way it did.  The characters did the obvious stupid things that they have to do in all shows and movies to keep it going and ""scary"".  The credits were even laughable.  It gets a two for some decent acting and nice makeup for the Big Bads.  I can't in good conscience give it more than a two.",1478736000,,1383,4.319066147859922

3744857,2,B001P9N99O,"Let me start by saying that I am extremely picky when it comes to horror movies so others may like this movie much more than I did. It started out with a good idea honestly. Movies with people unwillingly committing suicide (such as The Happening) are very interesting and psychologically thrilling, but this good idea was executed quite poorly. There was some witchcraft/demonic elements that should have been more of the focus instead of the intolerant, ignorant, and hypocritical southern Christians that ruled the town and the plot line. This seemed to be a poorly disguised social commentary on the extreme side of religion rather than a horror movie. If it wasn't for the demonic doppelgngers this wouldn't even qualify as a horror movie in my opinion. I stuck it out through the whole movie though because I always have hope a movie will redeem itself in the end. Hilariously enough, the last 2 minutes was indeed the best part in my opinion, which either has to do with my morbid sense of humor or the fact I was glad it was over with no likely chance of a sequel. Overall I didn't hate it (though I did hate some parts), I don't feel like I wasted an hour or so of my life but I won't likely be watching it again",1475625600,,1221,4.504504504504505

FROM WITHIN touches on an all-too-familiar plot that is filled with nothing beyond your average characters, yet it remains fast-paced and entertaining from beginning to end. Phedon Papamichael sets an ominous mood prefacing each attack in preparation for the shocks and thrills to come. He has enlisted a serviceable cast led by Elizabeth Rice as Lindsay, who pulls us through some of Thomas Dekker's weaker moments as the typical teen outsider, Aidan. While it is easy to predict the many twists and turns, it is still fun to sit back and watch the plot unfurl as it reaches its satisfying ending. With a winning score and a keen eye behind the camera, FROM WITHIN proves to be a worthwhile entry in to the supernatural teen horror genre.

The basic plot is that there are several suicides in a small town, in which the church members believe that a deceased devil worshipper's son is involved with the deaths. The actually truth is that the son and his brother cast a suicide spell because the churchgoers had murdered their innocent mother.

There were no surprises for me as I could clearly tell who the next victim was. I have to admit that I fell asleep for twenty minutes and I don't think I missed a single thing. As for the ending, I guessed it way before it happened.

  Yet another in a very LONG list of toxic offensive films with an agenda that portray Christians in an intolerant disrespectful false judgmental way. The fact there are so many films that depict Christians in such a negative light is proof Satan is alive and well in Hollywood.

I know many Christians from all walks of life all over the U.S. and around the world that have never exhibited anything like those depicted in the vast majority of anti-Christian films that seems are being mass produced by the haters in Hollywood,..films that are intended to make you despise the Christian,..Or,...offend the Christian. Yep,..there's no people group remaining in America that's acceptable to offend,..that is,..except for Christians!

You want an eye opening challenge? Every movie you watch that was produced from say 30 years ago and up until present day,..list each one on a piece of paper as to whether the Christian character(s) were hypocritical, murderous, immoral, drug using, thieving, brutal, hateful, racist, rapist, insane,.....dirt bags. You know,..the person you wanna hate? If you have not already noticed this,..perhaps you are not a real Christian.

If I ever see another film produced by Hollywood that depicts the average Christian in a positive way,..I'll be amazed but I'm not holding my breath.

3744945,3,B001P9N99O,"<strong>From Within</strong> (Phedon Papamichael, 2008)

Well-known DP/cinematographer Papamichael, who has worked on projects as disparate as the Best Picture-nominated <em>The Descendants</em>, the exploitation flick <em>Stripped to Kill II</em>, and <em>Identity</em>, one of the great overlooked horror films of the past ten years, rarely steps into the director's role. He did in 2008 with <em>From Within</em> which contains, to date, the only halfway decent script penned by Brad Keene (who was also responsible for the horrific <em>The Gravedancers</em>). Not a bad little film, quite possibly the best of the lot from After Dark Horrorfest 3 (I still haven't seen a couple of the entries, but it's far superior to the five I have), but still has some issues that rank it as a film probably best left to hardcore fans of low-budget horror.

Plot: as we open, two rebellious teens who live in a small town in Maryland, Sean (<em>Deadgirl</em>'s Shiloh Farnandez in an uncredited role) and Natalie (<em>Hostage</em>'s Rumer Willis), necking in a secluded spot. You get the idea you know where this is going, at least until Sean kills himself. Natalie, understandably traumatized, rushes back into town and into her father (<em>b. Monkey</em>'s Jared Harris)'s dress shop, babbling that she's being followed by a strange woman. Within moments, she, too, has killed herself, and this is just the beginning of a rash of suicides in this town. While the rest of the populace girds their loins with the armor of faith, Aidan (<em>A Nightmare on Elm St.</em>'s Thomas Dekker), Sean's younger brother, and his friend Lindsay (<em>My Dog Skip</em>'s Elizabeth Rice) try to figure out what's actually going on, and whether it may have supernatural origins. Lindsay's problem is that, unlike Aidan and Sean, she was raised in the conservative-Christian atmosphere of the town--is, in fact, the girlfriend of the son of the local megachurch's preacher ( a great, sleazy-to-the-max role for TV character actor Stephen Culp)--and she is torn between the town's belief that God will provide and the evidence of her own senses.

It's got so much potential, and in some ways, it delivers. Dekker and Rice are good enough actors, and there's a solid chemistry between them that taps into the love-triangle subplot before you even know it's there. And while fundamentalist Christians are almost too easy a target for any plot dealing with corruption, blasphemy, etc., Papamichael and Roy keep enough Christians in the plot on the good side of the coin to remind us that they're not attempting to tar the entire town with the same brush (a subtlety that, it seems, was lost on a number of fundamentalist commenters on IMDB, who attacked the film for doing exactly that).

On the other hand, the longer the movie goes, the more ludicrous the premise gets, and pieces of it seem to wander in for no reason. Specifically, the character of Sadie (<em>Keith</em>'s Margo Harshman), Aidan and Sean's cousin--what is she even <em>doing</em> in this movie, except possibly providing a little more shading to the grey areas by providing a non-angelic (pardon the pun) pagan character to mirror the preacher? Problem is, she's not a weighty enough character to do so, leaving her being extremely annoying with no reason for being in this movie. Gah.

In other words, not a great movie, not an awful one. I do wish the talented, underutilized Shiloh Fernandez had had a larger role. ** ",1329264000,,3462,5.1185840707964605

For instance, you have a mother who preachers to her daughter about purity while getting drunk and bedding a loose man.  She wears a cross around her neck while watching a striptease workout.

That's fine, there's hypocrites out there who are Christians in name only.  However, there are no sane Christians in this movie for balance, so you're left with a very limited view of Christians that stereotypes rather than informs.

When this movie wasn't beating you over the head with it's anti-Christian message, it was copying other movies.  For example, like the movie ""The Ring"", you have a young woman with long hair covering her face and days being counted down to build suspense.  However, in ""The Ring"", that countdown made sense since victims were only given 7 days to live, but in this movie, the countdown is unnecessary and gimmicky.

Also taken from other horror movies is the satanic whisperings of ""Susperia"", mirror image tricks of ""Poltergeist 2"", and spooky mannequins in a dark room of ""I Know What You Did Last  Summer"".  And of course, no horror movie would be complete without someone running in the woods and tripping onto the ground.  The acting is lackluster and amateurish, too -- especially the acting by the redheaded twins from America's Next Top Model.

So overall, you have a movie that spreads hate, is unoriginal, and is poorly acted.",1310515200,5,1482,5.028688524590164

3744960,4,B001P9N99O,"From Within has a pretty standard premise: small town with a dark secret unjustly murders a woman for witchcraft, witch takes revenge, townsfolk fall apart as their dark secret is unveiled and foolish teenagers pay the price.

From Within plays with preconceived notions of who is wrong and right in the debate over fundamentalism by sprinkling forthright characters with dark secrets...and dark characters with dark secrets too.  Nobody's innocent.  Not Aidan (Thomas Dekker, Mr. John Connor himself) the goth pretty boy whose brother Sean (Shiloh Fernandez) committed suicide in front of his girlfriend (Rumor Willis), nor Dylan (Kelly Blatz) the son of a preacher man.  With Lindsay (Elizabeth Rice) in the middle, they form a peculiar love triangle that's not particularly convincing, as Dylan comes off as nothing more than a pious robot.  It's hard to conceive that he and Elizabeth had a relationship at all.

The other characters, including Lindsay's boozy stepmother Trish (Laura Allen), her redneck boyfriend (Roy Adam) and the always-smiling Pastor Joe (Steven Culp) are all just about as awful as you might expect.  Christian fundamentalism is portrayed as just as ugly as alternative religions like Wicca.  It's not the mask of religion that's the problem, according to director Phedon Papamichael, it's what people are really like on the inside.  And with the exception of Lindsay, everyone is petty, vindictive, and self-centered.

But this is a horror film with a curse at its center, and From Within doesn't disappoint.  The ghosts all appear as dead, animated doppelgangers of their future victims, providing a fun ""guess how they're gonna die"" game for the audience that has echoes in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Final-Destination/dp/0780631684/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Final Destination</a>. The deaths all look like suicides, as the curse causes the victim to harm herself. There are two particularly inspired moments of creepiness, including a scene in a bathroom mirror and one confusing a bottle of whiskey with something a little stronger.

From Within hits all the Japanese-horror highlights, including a viral curse, creepy girls with long hair concealing their faces, and encounters that are just as weird as they are frightening. The first living person to reach the most recent dead victim catches it.  This has to be the first social media curse.

But what really propels From Within beyond the usual ghost story fare is the ending. Nihilistic and unflinching in its damning portrayal of everyone in the town, the director shows no mercy.  While that might not make for a happy ending, it sure makes for one heck of a twist.

Not quite as good as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Ring/dp/B00005JLTK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Ring</a>&nbsp;but certainly better than&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Seamstress/dp/B002FUIJ1U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Seamstress</a>, From Within is a worthy installment in American-style J-horror.",1286496000,5,3102,5.968397291196388
3744961,5,B001P9N99O,"Death.

That title blurb makes perfect sense once you see the film.

2008's ""From Within"" tells the story of a Maryland town plagued by a series of apparent suicides. The people of the town's prominent church attribute the problem to witchcraft and zero-in on the Wiccan son of a witch who literally burned to death years earlier (written off as an ""accident""). A Christian girl, Lindsay, takes compassion on the Wiccan dude, Aiden, and tries to understand him and what's really going on. Meanwhile people keep dying. Is this a curse of retribution released by the Wiccans? A small group of the Christians led by Dylan, the pastor's son and Lindsay's boyfriend, become desperate enough to pull out the guns. Havoc ensues.

If you're interested in seeing another typical slasher flick ""From Within"" probably won't appeal to you, but if you're in the mood for a serious chiller with an original concept and truly thought-provoking material this is the film to see, particularly if you're interested in belief systems, psychology, spirituality and questions of morality.

Some might criticize the film as anti-Christian but this is a superficial and knee-jerk reaction. The story's main protagonist, Linday, is shown in a completely positive light and most of the other Christians reveal positive and negative qualities. Is this anti-Christian or simply the way it is? Besides, the film clearly shows the negative sides of the Wiccans as well.

The picture acknowledges the human need for belief systems to get through life and that people are still people regardless of what they believe. It doesn't tell the viewer what belief system to adhere to (or which one is 'right') but it does unveil the existence of dark spiritual power and the dangers of sin, so what's that tell ya?

Some rightly point out that the influential mega-church in the film shows aspects of numerous Christian sects, which isn't realistic (see Steve Forsyth's excellent review). I believe this was done intentionally by the writer (Brad Keene) so that the film's not picking on just one group. Hence, the mega-church is a microcosm of Christendom and represents all Christianity. Such an approach yields a group that is not fully believable even while having many aspects of truth. Needless to say, don't look to this film for a completely accurate depiction of legitimate Christianity. It's a movie, not real life.

The way the death-curse works is very interesting: The curse is spread socially via the first person exposed to the latest victim; in other words, it's contagious. Also, the victims die via an evil doppelganger (an obvious type of the flesh or sin nature) who kills them in a way that looks like suicide. This supports the idea that evil can only slay or ruin or limit a person through their own volition, i.e. 'from within'. You could put it this way: The way of darkness is the way of self-destruction.

I liked how the film shows members of both belief systems humbly admitting they made mistakes (i.e. repentance) and willing to make things right, whatever the cost.

The story shows the domino effect of human failing. One person's moral failure leads to a deadly cover-up & slander which brings about retribution and numerous innocents' deaths. On and on and on. Evil begats evil.

As noted above, the film is truly thought-provoking. Lindsay sees her church's error and hypocrisy even while she experiences its positive aspects. She reaches out in compassion to the Wiccan dude, a purely loving gesture, but ultimately realizes that witchcraft is what released the death-curse. She's stuck between evil & error on both sides, what can she do?

""From Within"" is a horror film in the truest sense. Although it reveals a lot of truth about the human condition -- both good and bad -- it's not ultimately 'life-affirming' (but only within the small scope of the film, not the broader context of eternity). This is horror.

One of the film's highlights is the song played during the opening credits ""This Voice"" by Ane Brun. The song is outstanding, to say the least. It's from her 2006 album A TEMPORARY DIVE. You can hear the whole tune on youtube.

The picture was shot in Havre de Grace & Perryville, Maryland (it's nice to see a movie shot somewhere else rather than friggin' Vancouver and British Columbia).

The runtime is 89 minutes.

FINAL WORD: ""From Within"" is nothing less than amazing. It's original, absorbing, fascinating and provocative. A horror masterpiece.

3744962,5,B001P9N99O,"This film deals with guilt and vengeance in a small Pharisaical town. Mix guilt with self-righteousness, power and influence and injustice usually follows. However, in this wonderful little film, vengeance has a supernatural advantage which seems to be correcting a serious crime that has been covered up. The problem, which often happens with vengeance, is that the innocent get caught up in the fray and also suffer. As with most religious people they refuse to believe that their faith, leaders, church, or denomination could do any wrong, creating a staunch resistance against any justice or change. That lunacy also allows the guilty to go free ...sometimes.

Why do people pander and cater to religious beliefs? After all it is the religious who must ""prove"" the gibberish they spout. After centuries of blather...""god created everything in six days and he will burn you in hell... blah, blah, blah."" We've all heard it, but why do people still accommodate or waste a moment of time with something that is provably wrong? With literally tens of thousands of religions, not even counting the thousands that no longer exist, at each others (and non-believers) throats. Doesn't that indict god in some way? Even if it is just to accuse god of not clarifying who or what, he, she, or it is, and wants. The word clarify originates from Middle English meaning to make pure and clean. Do you think a god would have a problem with that? It seems like it would save a lot of lives and end false-worship. Certainly an omnipotent and omniscient god has the ability to appear in some remarkable way to everyone that would end all doubt once and for all. But until then, we must put up with the god or gods that have the flavor of the culture they are stuck in.",1281312000,2,1754,4.750819672131148

Beginning with a young man who shoots himself in front of his bewildered girlfriend, and continuing on to her, and on and on to anyone who is near the latest victim.  A Christian girl named Lindsay is trying to make sense of these tragedies but is beset by the other affliction the town suffers, and that is the extreme religious views of its mega-church.  Convinced the deaths stem from a local ""witch"" family, Lindsay's boyfriend Dylan leads the effort to first intimidate, and ultimately kill them off.  Lindsay has to choose sides - devotion to the town's faith, or helping the boy whom the town is gunning for.

FROM WITHIN is one of the last of this year's 8 Films To Die For that I watched, and it's certainly one of the most polished.  Acting is flawless, as is direction, cinematography, and, for the most part, writing.  The story is coherent and follows a logical progression.  And, it delivers plenty of chills along the way.  In short, it has what most of the other films didn't have.

I do have two slight issues with the movie. The first is the fact that, chilling as it is, the bulk of the films scares are lifted almost directly from other films.  You have the creepy girl with the hair covering her face, or the girl appearing in the TV, or the cheap After Effects shot of the sudden black-eyed demon face.  The film also suffers from having THE BROKEN in the same festival this year, both films drawing heavily on mirrors and reflections attacking people.  But, though these effects are lifted from other films, they are still employed very well here - the movie delivers plenty of great creep-out moments, even if they are familiar.

The only other issue I have is in the broadly stereotypical portrayal of extreme religion.  For starters, the writers don't seem to have much of a grasp on what religious group they are portraying.  At first, it would seem to be the evangelistic mega-church with its ""God is here to bless you"" mentality.  But, early on it is clear that they want these to be ""witch hunt"" types that blame every ill on the devil and are quick to take up a gun and shoot their own members who stray.  In other words, NOT the type of belief system that attracts enough members to become a mega-church.

Later still, the loonies are suddenly invoking a catholic type ceremony, making the sign of the cross on a girls forehead, repeating a rote prayer, and referring to visions of the Virgin Mary.  It's this kind of inconsistent portrayal that tells me the writers were just looking for a convenient villain, and thus created a conglomerate of every religious stereotype they could think of, again lifted from other films.

Now, at least the pastor has his moment to condemn the extremities that his son is going to.  And, to be fair, the pagan character are also rendered in a pretty stereotypical light.  In fact, one could argue that, at its core, the film argues for moderation from ALL faiths, as our two main characters both seem disillusioned with the extreme believers of their relative belief systems.  I know the feeling!

But, these quibbles aside, the film is still very well put together, and will have no problem being remembered as one of the few stand outs for After Dark's third Horror-fest.",1255132800,17,3294,4.628227194492255

That's what makes this movie truly shocking. These people really exist. It also has a great plot about a thoroughly frightening curse with a genuinely unique opening and a wicked ending. It's well acted and wonderfully crafted.
