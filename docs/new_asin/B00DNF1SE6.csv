8594749,2,B00DNF1SE6,"I think Denver Brocos: The Complete History is a better purchase. It covers most of the same things and has the same footage except it doesn't ignore the Plummer years in favor of that 1 season wonder, absolutely terrible NFL QB Tim Tebow.

Seriously, just ignoring Plummer's time in Denver is a damn insult to the man.",1476057600,3,319,4.5964912280701755
