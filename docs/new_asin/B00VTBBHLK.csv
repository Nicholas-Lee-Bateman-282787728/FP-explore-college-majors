8711141,2,B00VTBBHLK,"I lost my patience with this film for a number of reasons.  Unfortunately, this does little to round up sympathizers.  A good film on this topic has to explore the reasons why rape is not taken seriously.  I for one could see several reasons.  For example, you're dealing with universities that do not want to lose the moneymakers (students/perpetrators bringing in tuition dollars), nor prosecute athletes who are part of the biggest donor dollars at any campus.  (athletics bring in a fortune for schools)  I laughed out loud at the talking heads from the universities spouting their b.s.  None are truly concerned enough to make changes.  How about the parents of young women?  Those interviewed were so weak on the topic, like the one father saying that he didn't like the responses he got to emails and calls.  How about getting on a plane and visiting these people in-person, hiring a lawyer, etc.?  Then there are the young women themselves.  No, I'm not going to blame the women, but I AM going to say this:  anyone who has spent any time above ground in this society knows (even at an early age) that men are primates that cannot control themselves.  Therefore, in order to try to stay safe in the primate world, one has to avoid things where the male is even more out-of-control.  (including being alone - even sober- with a guy without realizing there are risks involved)  It's an objectifying, misogenistic society, and women have to act accordingly.  Lest we forget, there ARE those women who make false claims and cause the wrongly-accused their academic career and ruin their life.  And there still are women who send out mixed messages and/or weak protestations.  Does this mean females have to lock themselves in a bubble?  Maybe.  Most criminals in society are men.  Even very young, I realized that drinking would make me prone to make less-wise choices.  And in the wrong environment, that would become especially problematic.  Bottom line is that this is a society that doesn't care about this issue.  Yes, it stinks.  But it is what it is - a man's world, no matter how much women want to think that the playing field is level.

Now, I never come back to read comments so you can keep your mean-spirited responses for others to read.  My opinion is mine alone, wrought from experience.",1443225600,4,2307,4.757575757575758
8711142,5,B00VTBBHLK,"I had the privilege of attending high school with Angie. She and I were mere acquaintances, though we had many classes together. I am amazed at her bravery. She really drives the point home, especially for those who knew her: this could happen anywhere, to anyone. We must stand up and fight for these victims.",1437264000,6,310,4.654545454545454
8711143,4,B00VTBBHLK,It's a great and stimulating film that furthers awareness that is so crucial in society today.  But there is a feeling that pieces of the story is missing.  Wonderful film.,1433030400,3,172,4.7
8711144,5,B00VTBBHLK,"When sexual assault on college campuses is reported in the media, rarely it is done from the point of view of the victim.  Typically, the media reports of sexual assault on college campuses is done from the point of view of the alleged assailant whom is newsworthy (think of the college athlete).  Sadly, the stories of the victims are left untold.

Here, Lisa Jackson tells the story of five students that survived sexual assault on college campuses.  This documentary provides a rare insight into the personal stories of victims of sexual assault on college campuses.  These students bravely face the victim blaming culture that continues to pervade college campuses around the country and shows that students can stand up for themselves.  This is definitely a film that high school and college students should watch as well as parents of college bound students.",1432771200,10,864,5.049295774647887
8711145,5,B00VTBBHLK,"This film sensitively introduces the public to the reality of sexual assault on campuses. With an alarming number of sexual assaults also taking place in elementary, middle, and high school, this film should be screened widely at youth group meetings, at home, with friends, at community meetings, etc. to get the discussion going before kids hit college. (The film's website actually has a discussion guide). This film renders a great service by gently introducing youth and families to what has been termed the civil rights issue of our time. The courageous young women who reported their assaults are an inspiration for other survivors to come forward. Bravo!",1432425600,8,662,5.196261682242991
8711146,5,B00VTBBHLK,"my daughter is a rising freshman and I am so grateful that this film exists. Every parent, student, administrator and member of society must see this film. Although the material is sensitive and at times haunting the filmmakers provide a powerful platform for this young activists to share their stories and illuminate the high prevalence of sexual assault on college campuses.  We witness these women advocate for themselves and others so that our children won't have to fear being violated the next time their out with their friends. Thank you for this film",1432080000,7,559,5.010752688172043
