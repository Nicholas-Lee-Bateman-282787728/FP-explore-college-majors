8159351,5,B000KWZ2CO,"This DVD helped my son with his catching position.  With dedicated training and practicing most of the techniques shown, he won the starting catching position on his team.  The techniques we learned are not often taught and we feel are essential in mastering the position.  Much appreciation and thanks to Bob Bennett for making the video.",1175472000,,339,5.017857142857143
