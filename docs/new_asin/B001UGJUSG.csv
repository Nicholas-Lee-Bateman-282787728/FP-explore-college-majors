3798276,5,B001UGJUSG,"Vampires are very hot right now -- the bestselling ""Twilight"" series, the hit TV show ""True Blood,"" and the tragically cancelled ""Moonlight.""

And one of the better vampire stories to emerge from the crypt is ""Blood Ties,"" a too-brief show based on Tanya Huff's urban fantasy series. The first season has a slightly slow start, but it's a solid action/fantasy series with plenty of sensual romance, gritty crime, and supernatural spookery.

On her way back from a date, PI Vicki Nelson (Christina Cox) sees a caped figure attack and kill a young man -- leaving the body drained of blood. The victim's girlfriend hires Vicki to find the culprit. But as Vicki starts prodding around goth clubs and alleyways, she encounters the mysterious Henry Fitzroy (Kyle Schmid) who is doing his own murder investigation.

Turns out Henry is also a sexy 500-year-old vampire, and the bastard son of Henry VII. Together they have to find a creepy demon-summoner, before something far worse is unleashed. And soon she has to deal with a lot of other supernatural problems, with the help of Henry and her former partner Mike (Dylan Neal), who loathe one another.

Among the problems: voodoo priest and his zombies, a murderous ""imaginary friend,"" a heart-crushing Celtic ghost, a suburban incubi, a man-eating Wendigo, Egyptian gods, a Medusa, a fertility clinic that produces creepy results, the return of creepy demon-summoning dude, and an immortal priest with an unending vendetta against Henry.

""Blood Ties Season One"" fits into the same niche as ""Moonlight"" and ""The Dresden Files"" -- a detective series with vampires and spooky things, and a human mired in the supernatural. But it's not entirely the same -- ""Blood Ties"" has a distinctly dark, grimy feel, with lots of pale light, shadowy urban streets and a unique vampire (""I don't have mojo. I have charm!"").

It also has a nice murky mystery in each episode, with monsters ranging from notorious (zombies!) to obscure (svartalfar!), tightly wound action scenes and some very sensual bloodsucking. And the writers spin up some lovely dialogue for Vicki and Henry, usually to each other (""It's just a conversation, it's nothing to worry about."" ""That's what my father said to Anne Boleyn"").

And Cox is excellent as Vicki -- tough, strong and capable of handling her own life, but with the vulnerability of a degenerative eye disease. And she's backed by Neal as a skeptical, straight-and-narrow cop who obviously has a thing for Vicki, and Gina Holden as a perky Goth who appoints herself Vicki's new secretary/gofer/research assistant.

And Schmid is the perfect good-guy vampire -- he's devastatingly hot, and he mingles impish charm, sensuality, ferocity and down-to-earth quirkiness (""If this book isn't at the printer's by the end of the month, my editor's gonna kill me... again!""). His most brilliant work is the prolonged torture of ""Heart of Fire,"" especially during Henry's heartrending struggle against his bloodthirst.

""Blood Ties Season One"" starts off a little slow, but the solid writing and excellent acting make this one of the better vampire shows to hit TV screens.",1236297600,33,3130,5.09765625
3798277,5,B001UGJUSG,"This is by far the best vampire show out there, ever. Based on the Blood books by the incredibly talented Tanya Huff, it stars Kyle Schimd as Henry Fitzroy, bastard son of Henry the VII that just happens to be a very hot vampire, Christina Cox as Vicki Nelson, one hot former cop turned PI and Dylan Neal as Det. Mike Celluci, Toronto detective and former partner/lover of Vicki. The show is well written, superbly acted and is terribly missed. This is a must buy and fall in love with!!!! You will not be disappointed, it's hot, intriguing and worth watching again and again.",1236297600,35,576,4.548076923076923

3798286,5,B001UGJUSG,I read the books a couple of years ago and just found this series now.  Lives up to the books nicely.  For anyone who likes the genre this is a great series.  Enjoy,1424736000,,164,3.909090909090909
3798287,5,B001UGJUSG,I loved this series and wish they would have continued their story a while longer.,1414022400,,82,4.533333333333333

3798289,3,B001UGJUSG,"This is somewhat disappointing for a vampire series that's not even a decade old yet (it seems more like something that would have been produced turn of the century, or even in the 90s). I wasn't expecting much, yet the focus on a ""creature of the week"" in each ep (using all of the ""usual suspects"") at the expense of an overarching story was unfortunate. Christina Cox is alluring and her character was acceptable, but that's about as much praise as I can manage for Blood Ties at the moment. The urban goth club scenes (Toronto) were also a selling point for me.
In comparison to other vampire serials I've watched (which is most of them by this point), here's how it ranks (I ordered this list from best to worst):

True Blood > Angel > Buffy > Being Human (UK) > Forever Knight > Sanctuary > Being Human (Montreal) > The Gates > The Originals > Vampire Diaries > Blood Ties > Moonlight

OK,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sanctuary/dp/B008I34Z34/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sanctuary</a>&nbsp;isn't a vampire show per se, but vampire blood is part of the show's mythology, and Sanctuary's recurring character Nikola Tesla wins the award for ""TV vampire with the best sense of humor"" (see the episode&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sleepers/dp/B0031FI30U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sleepers</a>), only slightly besting Spike from Buffy/Angel. As you can see, Blood Ties scores pretty poorly compared to the other shows, in large part to the grand story arcs its competitors.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Forever-Knight-The-Trilogy/dp/B001RV1TXI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Forever Knight - The Trilogy</a>&nbsp;is actually a pretty bad serial by today's standards, but if you view it in context (1992-96 TV is dated!) and consider that Forever Knight was the genesis of many aspects of contemporary vamp shows, then you'll understand why I ranked it so high and better than Blood Ties.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Angel-The-Complete-Series/dp/B003YF9Q08/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Angel: The Complete Series</a>&nbsp;was inconsistent in quality, but more often than not the 5-season Angel outshines the 7-season Buffy, occasionally surpasses the 7-season True Blood, and almost always is preferred over Blood Ties.

So yeah, I guess this didn't turn out to be strictly a review of Blood Ties, but I think you can take home the point that there are plenty of better vamp shows to watch before turning to this one.",1409875200,,2595,6.084699453551913
3798290,3,B001UGJUSG,I lost interest in this series pretty quickly and never watched it through to its entirety. True Blood was running at the same time and I didn't think it was a patch on True Blood.  Enjoyable enough though for anybody still wanting more sexy and friendly vampires.,1407369600,,264,4.617021276595745
3798291,5,B001UGJUSG,"Loved this show, romantic tension triangle which included a playful sarcastic vampire. Also, a bit like buffy in trying to figure out who the bad guy(s) are, what they are, and how to stop them...with a female lead that can kick booty without any super powers. I had not read any of the books before seeing the show and I fully enjoyed the show, someone I know who had read the books said they still fully enjoyed the show too.",1398643200,,427,4.35
3798292,5,B001UGJUSG,I remember catching this show on all channels - LIFETIME?! LOL! I was hooked and went and found the graphic novels by Tanya Huff - that the show drew from. Its pretty decent as the Vampire trend has only gone even bigger since that show was on the air. Kyle Schmid as the Illegitimate Son of King Henry VIII - Henry Fitzroy and Christina Cox as Vicki the detective going blind due to a condition. Worlds collide and the show was really very well written.,1386288000,,454,4.352941176470588
3798293,5,B001UGJUSG,I wish it didn't get canceled.  I love the love triangle. I wonder who Vicki would choose if she got the chance.?,1382140800,,113,4.136363636363637
3798294,5,B001UGJUSG,"I have read the books and I wish I had known when this was on air.  I do not love the actress playing Vickie but I got used to her.  They change up the stories enough to keep you guessing.  This will not scare you but it will entertain you, and everybody is hot.  Sometimes that is really all I am looking for..",1373932800,,311,3.888888888888889
3798295,4,B001UGJUSG,"okay, sure, it was a little different from the books...but honestly, what show/movie isn't? the casting though is what makes this stand out as one of the better adaptations. 2/3 of the casting was perfect which is why I give this 4 out of 5 stars.",1373328000,,247,4.391304347826087
3798296,5,B001UGJUSG,"I saw this show BRIEFLY on Lifetime ages ago. Then I was in a record store in LA, and picked the whole series up, totally by accident. WOW, was I pleased with this show!

I love the characters, the actors, the plotlines, and ALL the cheesiness!! It's so great! So much fun to watch! love it!

If you like vampire shows and police dramas, if you love tough chicks and hot vampires, you'll LOVE Blood Ties!",1367107200,,404,4.302631578947368
3798297,5,B001UGJUSG,this is a great vampire series from Canada the leads are all excellent and the love triangle adds nicely to the plot line and action.  Ranks right up there with the series Moonlight,1366675200,,181,4.484848484848484
3798298,4,B001UGJUSG,There are some new and interesting vampire twists and scenes in this series. The earlier segments tend to be more interesting and show more of the vampire character.,1365897600,,165,4.928571428571429
3798299,3,B001UGJUSG,"This was a gift for my daughter. It's not my style, but she really liked it. She doesn't think vampires should ""sparkle"".",1360022400,,121,4.545454545454546
3798300,5,B001UGJUSG,"I got tired of watching my Buffy & Angel dvds.  Then found the long lost Kindred series.  I watched Forever Knight.  Then fell in love with Moonlight.  On a whim I discovered this series and decided to take a chance.  Am I so happy I did!  The three leads are so damn delicious to look at!!!  Henry- the cheekbones, the hair, the wiry rockstar cool................ Vicki- the dreamy curvy body, the raspy whisky soaked voice................. Mike- the impossibly square jawed face, the broad shoulders.............  But that's not all; this show is eerily dark & scary with LOTS of blood & demonic influence, giving the Vampire legends (finally) a true adult feel that is NOT A GAME FOR KIDS/TEENS.  There are witches, ghosts, demons, rituals, gods, devils, you-name-it......and the sexual tension is so damn thick, you could cut it with a knife.  THE FIRST EPISODES GIVE THE AUDIENCE A LOT OF BUILD UP FOR THIS TWISTED LOVE TRIANGLE WITH MUCH TEASING AND TEMPTATION.  I watch it at night and find myself jumping off the couch at times.  Hope you enjoy it as much as I do.",1344297600,,1072,4.735135135135135
3798301,4,B001UGJUSG,"I love the shows from Canada made in the '80's,and this is a good one. The lead actress was made for this genre and never disappoints. She strong and believable.",1344211200,,161,4.4

3798303,5,B001UGJUSG,"For a Canadian Tv series I was intriged and fascinated of the character of a PI with diminishing eye sight, yet she was always solving or stumbling on to a case in the dark, with night blindness.
The jealous ex partner is a character in itself, and each series or episodes was not a disappointment.",1330905600,,298,4.4363636363636365
3798304,4,B001UGJUSG,"I found a develish amount to enjoy in this series, a purchase I made largely in the dark.

Blood Ties was not a series I'd ever heard of before, possibly because it was a briefly run Canadian import.
It's set in Toronto and has a passing resemblence to the earlier ""knight"" series, but this has it beaten in almost every area.

Blood Ties has better acting, better sets, more dynamic and interesting storylines.

The first series establishes the caracters, and as the episodes roll forward they are well dealt with by the writers. Storyboard and caracter development walk hand in hand to pull the viewer along. The sets are not first rate Hollywood, but certainly well above average for this type of show.

There's no overt sexuality and the OTT bloodlust and bloodletting that can caracterise series of this type are pleasantly, for the most part, absent.

The series takes the viewer through various aspects of mythology and demonology from diverse global cultures, it seems to hold very close to the accepted myths for each as it weaves them into a stong storyline comprising a private detective losing her sight, her centuries old partner - Henry, and throws in the dynamic human triangle with her ex-police partner still showing in each episode.

This non-love triangle explodes in betrayal, animosity, reparations and what could ultimately result in enduring bonds about halfway through the first season.

The writers outdid themselves with a very difficult often over used and poorly exploited subject.

At the price point I can only describe it as excellent value for money, I would not hesitate to recommend it to any interested in the genere.",1329868800,,1652,4.9601449275362315
3798305,5,B001UGJUSG,"I found this gem on the Space channel just recently.  I enjoyed it so much that I went in search for more episodes only to find that it only ran for 22 and was then axed.  This was a big mistake on Lifetimes part.  I'll bet this show had quite the following and could have been still running today giving True Blood a run for it's money.  Henry is so hot he makes my blood boil and every episode I hope that he and Vicky finally get together only to be disappointed again when she cops out.  I haven't seen the second season yet as I am having difficulty getting my hands on it but it sounds like it has lots of loose ends and feels incomplete.  If you want to find out how things go, read the series by Tanya Huff.  It's excellent and addictive.",1323648000,,746,4.068493150684931
3798306,5,B001UGJUSG,"Dvd's were exactly as described. I loved this show when it was on tv. Unfortunately the series did not have a long life, so the episodes being put on dvds were perfect.",1314057600,,168,4.28125
3798307,5,B001UGJUSG,"This is a supernatural series with adult characters.

A private dectective, a police officer, and a vampire are
solving supernatural cases and battling various creatures.
such as a ghost, mummy, medusa, demons.

Those who loved Buffy when they were younger came to love
Blood Ties.  The nature of vampirism is quite different in
this series, but the spirit of the show is the same.

3798310,2,B001UGJUSG,I have been watching thr True Blood series which I thoroughly enjoy. I purchased Blood Ties thinking it would be good with such outstanding reviews. OMG..

3798311,1,B001UGJUSG,"I'm a huge fan of the Tanya Huff Blood series of books, as well as the spinoff books featuring Tony.  The first episode of this series was so completely off from the books, and so low end in general, that I didn't make it all the way through.  They've taken away Vicky's toughness, her smartness and just about everything that made the Blood books what they are.  I guess the high ratings for this series are sort of like the great reviews of True Blood.  True Blood changed every important supporting character and relationship, and definitely not for the better, but people were happy with it.  Obviously I'm not in the majority here, but I feel that if you loved the characters who make the Blood series what it is, I'd approach this one with limited expectations.  I was willing to live with the changes to the Dresden Files show because I liked the characters of Harry and Bob, but in the Blood Ties show it seemed like the characters were generic cardboard cutouts.  Disappointing.",1288310400,,987,4.605714285714286

With unlimited ideas for continuing and the quality of the writers and the great meshing of the actors I can not believe that this didn't last for many, many seasons.  I will enjoy watching these two series over and over and will still look for a way to somehow get through to the writer or a TV network to get this back to continue the fun stories.

THere is a delightful combination of humor, sleuthing, and of course a bit of seductive vampiric fun, all stirred together. A recipe for success.
The characters are simply magic together.  The female lead is no simpering damsel, either. The shows are just pure enjoyment to watch.

3798319,3,B001UGJUSG,"First of all I rate the show as a 5. The dvd release I rate as a 2. There should be more ""dvd reviews"" and less ""plot synopsis"" reviews.  Anyway, whoever decided to release a wide screen production in 4x3 letter box should be thrown in jail. Or at least banned from producing dvd's. Did they think they were doing that for the older tv crowd?  If you want to watch a wide screen dvd on a 4x3 tv, all you have to do is change the tv shape on the player. I have 5 dvd players. Expensive to cheap. They all will show 16x9 dvd's in either 16x9 or 4x3 letterbox.  I do that all the time since my vacation house still has a square tv.

3798320,5,B001UGJUSG,"This is one great show. I loved the Charlaine Harris books but didn't like the True Blood series very much. The show was so different from the books. This time I decided to watch the show before reading the books. The show features Victoria, a private eye, who used to be a cop but had  to leave the force because of poor eyesight. She meets up with Henry, the 450 year old vampire on one of her cases. She tries to take cases that aren't weird, but they all seem to feature supernatural forces. But as her secretary advertises in their ad, ""no case is too strange"" for them.

I'm watching the first season now and there's not a lot of sex, but some sexual tension. There's a lot of humor between the main three characters...Vicky, Henry, and Mike (Vicky's old partner at the police department). There's a lot of suspense, a lot of humor, and really entertaining. If you like the Sookie Stackhouse books, you will love this show.

Vicky gets demon marks on her early in the first season so she has some defense against these supernatural forces she has to deal with and Henry is her back up plan, but Mike also does his share of helping out. A strong female sleuth character, an enticing vampire, and a strong but skeptical cop...wish they still made the show because it is great.

It has everything vampire fans love- good story lines, supernatural elements, perfect casting, and lots of heat between the 3 main characters.

A modern day vampire solving supernatural crimes with a retired cop turned private investigator is a plot that should entertain everyone.  There's drama, romance, sexual tension, and fantasy all wrapped up in a nice two season series.

The series' focus is on Henry Fitzroy, the illegitimate son of Henry VIII, and a private eye in modern day Toronto.  The series suggests that Henry Fitzroy did not die of consumption as history believes but instead became a vampire.",1262044800,,610,5.06

The female investigator was too demanding and tried to be too tough. It didn't work for me, she was going blind and yet she was more powerful than the vampire?

  I was literally fast forwarding hoping some characters would emotionally connect. What was the point of having a vampire in it, when he doesn't go for the jugular...in the romance department?
 There was no chemistry between the love triangle at all.
  Special effects were super cheesy. Acting was dismal to the point of embarrassment. It had that (no offense) unidentifiable Canadian feel to it that is usually charming. The 1 star goes to Fitzroy,who deserves a medal for getting through this formulaic dreck still looking fabu.

It is/was about this former homicide detective Vicki Nelson (Christina Cox), who, due to her failing eye sight, has to quit the force, and in turn she opens her own PI agency.

However, her world changes significantly one night, after she witnesses something supernatural and then her subsequent meeting of the almost 500 yr old [450 to be exact] vampire named Henry Fitzroy (Kyle Schmid), [...] son of King Henry the VIII.

Soon they develop not only a friendship , but also a partnership , as they work to confront the things that go bump in the night.

And with the way most good stories go, Vicki must deal, not only with her attraction towards Henry, but with her on again off again relationship with her former homicide detective partner Mike Celluci (Dylan Neal).

""Blood Ties"" is (was) a smartly written, well acted TV show, that highlighted wonderful chemistry between its' actors characters with witty dialogue and great (sexual) tension.

It is a great pity that this show was staked before it's time, thus limiting its undead life to only one season, and with the current influx of vamp shows on the TV market, it would have been nice to have this Canadian gem in the rough!

We fans had petitioned for at least a Tv movie to get made, to tie up the loose ends, so we won't be left exsanguinated from the dramatic end that was episode 22! But alas, it has to date, been to no avail.

We've read the books we know Henry's bisexual, did the producers think that the larger population couldn't handle it too. How short-sighted. And what was with the Coreen character. She was just a minor character in the first book and then forgotten. Not to mention the actress played her in such an annoying way. The producers just beefed-up her character as a replacement for Tony; I mean she basically ended up doing his job.

3798346,3,B001UGJUSG,"Throughout the 1980's, Canadian fantasy author Tanya Huff was known for creating the ""Quarters"" and ""Wizard Crystal"" series.  But in the 1990's, she released books known as ""The Blood books"" about a detective named Vicki Nelson who teams up with a vampire to take on cases that are often supernatural.

Huff created a total of five books plus a short story collection and in 2007, her books were adapted into a television series by Peter Mohan in Canada and aired on Lifetime Television and Citytv and Space in Canada.  The first season is now available on DVD.

The characters of Blood Ties are as follows:

Victoria ""Vicki"" Nelson (Christina Cox) - A former police officer who is now a private investigator who was diagnosed with retinitis pigmentosa (she is slowly going blind).  She was given an opportunity to work a desk job but declined.  She has left her job and her former boyfriend (Detective Mike Celluci) behind in order to pursue her career as an investigator.  But things change when she starts discovering grizzly murders and after an encounter with a vampire named Henry Fitzroy, who she ends up partnering and even having an interest in.

Henry Fitzroy (Kyle Schmid) -  The legitimate heir to Henry VIII's throne but chose to love a woman named Christina and sacrificed his life for her and became a vampire.  Several hundred years later, he has made a life as a graphic novelist in Toronto and has taken an interest towards Vicki.

Detective Mike Celluci (Dylan Neal) - Vicki's former partner at the police force but also her former lover.  Mike's relationship with Vicki has not been the same since she quit.  But with these new murders in the city and her investigating, he finds himself closer to her but at the same time having some sort of suspicion about Henry.

Coreen Fennel (Gina Holden) - A goth like college student with knowledge of the occult who has been trying to find out who killed her boyfriend.  During the night of the murder, her boyfriend described what could be vampire and the first person she goes to for help is Investigator Vicki Nelson.

Included on the box set are a total of four DVD's which contain a total of 13 episodes.  Included are:

  1. Episode 1 - Blood Price - Part One - Vicki is a private investigator hired by Coreen to find out who killed her boyfriend.  Through the process, she realizes that the murders in town may not be human, probably supernatural and confirms her suspicion when she encounters the vampire Henry Fitzroy.
  2. Episode 2 - Blood Price - Part Two - Coreen has been kidnapped by her boyfriend's killer and now Vicki and her vampire partner Henry must save her.
  3. Episode 3 - Bad Juju - Vicki has been hired by a client who practices voodoo who wants to find out what happened to her brother.  Meanwhile, she is being hunted by a zombie.  Vicki asks Henry for his help.
  4. Episode 4 - Gifted - Mike has his suspicions about Henry Fitzroy and Vicki encounters a girl who has telekinetic powers that controls a demon.
  5. Episode 5 - Deadly Departed - A witch and a vengeful spirit have targeted Vicki and Mike.
  6. Episode 6 - Love Hurts - A man hires Vicki to find out if his wife has been cheating on him but while she investigates, the wife is found dead.  Who is the culprit?
  7. Episode 7 - Heart of Ice - The homeless have gone missing and Vicki tries to investigate their disappearance.  Meanwhile, Mike is investigating a prostitute who has been drained of her blood and suspects Henry.
  8. Episode 8 - Heart of Fire - Vicki and Mike must get to Henry who has been held hostage.
  9. Episode 9 - Stone Cold - Vicki and Henry confront Medusa.
  10. Episode 10 - Necrodome - Diesel Swanson, a professional boxer has gone missing.  But something is awry when Diesel is seen on video walking out of the funeral home.
  11. Episode 11 - Post Partum - Vicki investigates a man's wife who has isolated herself inside a clinic.
  12. Episode 12 - Norman - Norman has returned from hell and attempts to revive his demon master.
  13. Episode 13 - D.O.A. - Vicki is visited by a co-worker from the police force who is dead and needs her help but perhaps this person is not what he claims to be.

VIDEO & AUDIO:

""BLOOD TIES"" is a series that is primarily shot indoors or the outdoors during the middle of the night.  The good news is that the series is clean even during low light conditions.  Most television series tend to exhibit low-light noise and can look quite terrible at times on DVD.

For ""BLOOD TIES"", for the most part, the picture quality is featured in Standard Definition (4:3) and looks good.  I saw no major DVD compression artifacting.  But the series showcases dark colors and rarely do you see vibrant colors (well, reds and blues come out clear during the police sirens or the city lights utilizing stock video of the city of Toronto).  But for a television series, the picture quality is very good for a series shot mainly during the night and low-light conditions.

Audio is featured in Dolby Digital Stereo and dialogue is heard clearly.  The series does have action scenes but for the most part, the film is dialogue driven.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

""BLOOD TIES - SEASON ONE"" comes with the following special features:

  * SPACE Behind the Scenes - Blood Ties - (24:02) A featurette featuring the cast talking about the series and their characters.
  * Trailer - (2:43) The original trailer for ""BLOOD TIES"".

JUDGMENT CALL:

Overall, ""BLOOD TIES"" was an entertaining series.  I've never read the original books but with my enjoyment of vampire/supernatural shows, I figured that this series would be quite exciting to watch.

With the romance factor being explored between vampires and humans with a film like ""Twilight"" and a TV series like ""True Blood"", I have been wanting something along the lines of ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" or ""Angel"".

I enjoyed the darkness of the series and its characters and how each case was significantly different (ie. like Angel) but I suppose where ""Angel"" worked was within its characters and how entertaining those characters were in a humorous type of way.

""BLOOD TIES"" showcases former police officers who are focused on doing their jobs, whereas in ""Angel"", the characters had their fault, their quirks but most importantly a charm of how they would react towards various situations.

The formula for the first season of ""BLOOD TIES"" was too safe.  You have Vicki as the  Gung-ho investigator who takes on any case.  And if that case is too much for her, her vampire friend Henry must help and protect her.  Meanwhile, her former lover at the PD must also help her but is concerned about the new man that Vicki has been spending time with.  Thus the beginning of a love triangle and they all must put away their differences and work together.

I felt that this good girl/bad boy routine between Vicki and Henry was played too safely.  Even the season finale, I was expecting that maybe there would be some wild twist.  Expecting some sort of cliffhanger and perhaps maybe I was spoiled by the two Joss Whedon series that a vampire and human can never be together.

Something explored on ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" and also on ""Twilight"" but was hoping would happen on ""BLOOD TIES"" are the repercussions of a human and vampire working together.  Perhaps something would happen to Henry and maybe he would attack Vicki or Mike and lose control.  I just wanted some type of consequence and although the cases remained the same, it seemed as if each week, the same usual things were being played out with reptition.

As far as the episodes go, they are entertaining and some episodes are nice, dark and are filled with action.  I definitely want to know more about what the marks are on Vicki's wrists and what is going to happen with her character with her eye sight problem and her love triangle that she currently is in.  And of course, I'm sure we will have more of crazy character Norman in future episodes.

With a good number of vampire based shows on television and with the series being shown on Lifetime, I think that ""BLOOD TIES"" somehow was lost in the shuffle and unfortunately, the series was canceled after the first season in the US, while our Canadian and UK counterparts have enjoyed the second season.

I often wonder after watching this first season, that perhaps the series evolves to something different with season 2.  Perhaps more additional characters and more dramatic situations and even a grave threat, especially whatever ties into the mysteries that were left with the viewer after this first season.

I feel that there is so much story (and potential)  from these books the series is based on,  that have yet to be told, and that the first season is just more about character development for now.  Perhaps that there are some more intense situations that would be addressed.  And if so, I can only hope that season 2 gets an American release on DVD.

Overall, I felt that the series was entertaining but for this first season alone, it was a good start but it was average at best.",1246060800,5,9057,4.638766519823789

3798350,4,B001UGJUSG,"I liked Blood Ties, especially the performances of Christina Cox and Gina Holden.  But I'm a little confused about this DVD set.  I showed an ep on Lifetime to a friend, who subsequently took holiday in England and brought back two DVD sets of the complete 22 episode series--for some reason titled Blood Ties - Complete Season 1.  And one of those sets was for me!

Here's the confusion.  When Lifetime showed Blood Ties, I'm pretty sure it was in 4x3 (just like this soon to be released DVD set) but the DVDs mentioned in the previous paragraph were 16x9.  And not only didn't it look as if someone had just lopped off the top or bottom of the picture to get the extra width. Blood Ties looked better 16x9 than I recall it ever looking on tv!  And the DVDs were only letterboxed, not anamorphic widescreen, which would've looked even better on HDTVs.

So why not go with what looks better on the new DVD set?  All right, I'll admit, looks better to me.  But I'll bet if you saw Blood Ties 16x9 you'd agree too!

The series actually improves as it goes along, with the final episodes packing some incredibly powerful dramatic punches.  Plus, it's often very funny, because all the actors playing the major characters have terrific comic timing, and the comic dialogue sparkles.

3798357,5,B001UGJUSG,"Blood Ties is a Canadian production that was filmed as a 22-episode season. In the US, Lifetime TV decided to split was was actually one season into two, with the first eleven episodes (""Blood Price"" to ""Post Partum"") as Season One and the remaining eleven (""Norman"" to ""Deep Dark"") as Season Two. Blood Ties fans have waited desperately for any news after Lifetime dropped the show like a hot potato despite intensive fan campaigns including blood drives and donations to charities. Their decision to split the show into two is unfortunate from a DVD standpoint; The British Blood Ties box set features all 22 episodes, but the US release features what is essentially half the (only) season. However, there are some excellent episodes here, such as the two-part Heart of Ice / Heart of Fire and the two-part pilot Blood Price. However, where the British set was devoid of extras, the US version will feature behind-the-scenes materials (and there was rumor of a gag/blooper reel mentioned in an interview). The release for Season Two is tentatively scheduled for September 2009; with the popularity of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Moonlight-The-Complete-Series/dp/B000WFW12S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Moonlight - The Complete Series</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/True-Blood-The-Complete-First-Season-HBO-Series/dp/B001FB4W0W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">True Blood: The Complete First Season (HBO Series)</a>, and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Twilight-Two-Disc-Special-Edition/dp/B001P5HRMI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Twilight (Two-Disc Special Edition)</a>, sales should be high.

Blood Ties revolves around Victoria ""Vicki"" Nelson, an ex-cop with Toronto's Metro police. Vicki was forced to resign due to a degenerative eye disease, retinitis pigmentosa, and is trying to make a living as a private investigator. Her fiery romance with fellow cop Mike Celluci is an on-again, off-again affair, and her first case as a PI gives her more than she bargained for: someone is summoning demonic forces, and Henry Fitzroy, her new partner on the case, just happens to be a 480-year-old vampire and is the illegitimate son of Henry VIII.

The series pilot Blood Price is faithfully based on Tanya Huff's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Blood-Price-BLOOD-SERIES/dp/0756405017/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Blood Price (BLOOD SERIES)</a>. The remainder of the season finds Vicki exploring demons, incubi, reanimated corpses, shapeshifters, mummies, voodoo, ghosts...while caught in a crackling love triangle between former flame Mike and sensual, deadly Henry. Vicki's new assistant is the perky Goth Coreen, who also has her eye on Henry.

Blood Ties consistently satisfies my cravings for an intelligently handled supernatural cop drama. Its premise sounds promising in print, but without Blood Ties' cleverly crafted story arcs and meaningful character interaction, it would amount to little more than a tired monster-movie-of-the-week retread. This is a show that wisely knows not to take itself too seriously, leading to fast and furious one-liners, visual gags and impeccable comedic timing. The entire Canadian cast and crew does a consistently amazing job of bringing Blood Ties to life, and it's great to see a Canadian production receive airtime in the States.

The show's setting is Toronto but is filmed in Vancouver (with exterior shots of identifying Toronto landmarks), but it's still Canadian through-and-through, a rarity in days where tired Toronto is expected to double as Everyamericancity. This may be the first show since&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Forever-Knight-The-Trilogy-Part-1-1992-1993/dp/B0000C23T1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Forever Knight - The Trilogy, Part 1 (1992 - 1993)</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Due-South-The-Ultimate-Collection-Three-Complete-Seasons/dp/B0017KP8Y0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Due South: The Ultimate Collection - Three Complete Seasons</a>&nbsp;that revels in its Canadianness.

Although Blood Ties is currently off-air, its fan base continues to spread through word of mouth, Big Fish's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Blood-Ties/dp/B001JINYNC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Blood Ties</a>&nbsp;hidden object game featuring characters, locations, and audio from the show, and Internet groups, thereby bringing new viewers into the fold. It has been at least a decade since I felt so strongly about a TV show; I was so moved by Blood Ties' strong female role model and intriguing blend of romance, police procedural, and the supernatural that I downloaded several episodes via iTunes and recruited several friends to the show.

Blood Ties remains my favorite post-<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Forever-Knight-The-Trilogy-Part-1-1992-1993/dp/B0000C23T1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Forever Knight - The Trilogy, Part 1 (1992 - 1993)</a>&nbsp;for its enchanting blend of humor, passion, action, moral dilemmas, and the mortal (and immortal) ties that bind. Tanya Huff's source material has been toned down enough to allow families to enjoy Blood Ties together. Blood Ties protagonist Vicki Nelson (Christina Cox) is a strong positive role model for women through her physicality, self-reliance despite disability, and intelligence.

It's instantly obvious (except to American/Canadian networks who were reluctant to pick up the show for a second season, grrr...) why Blood Ties was nominated for numerous awards such as Constellation and Leo Awards. The entire cast, headed by Christina Cox (Vicki), Kyle Schmid (Henry), Dylan Neal (Mike), and Gina Holden (Coreen), has an outstanding chemistry that shines on-screen, and I can't wait to finally own Blood Ties on DVD!",1236384000,129,5976,6.743190661478599
