It's presented in its step by step production with explanations made for what is being done. You'll learn that sometimes getting the right look is not automatic - it can take multiples tries using the various tools in ZBrush. Ultimately you do get to the final build of the creature.

When I purchased this DVD it was already dated material. It uses ZBrush 2.0 which introduced the original ZSpheres. As of this month Sept - 2009 ZBrush 3.5 has been released which introduces ZSpheres 2 and ZSketch - both phenomenal tools. If you are an owner of ZBrush 3.5, I would not suggest this DVD but wait for new tutorial DVDs using 3.5 or above.",1253577600,,815,4.620689655172414
