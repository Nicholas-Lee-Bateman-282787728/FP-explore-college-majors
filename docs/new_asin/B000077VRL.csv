1802047,2,B000077VRL,"It's freezing outside, two homeless men have one possession between them, a heater.  The unfortunate thing is, they have no place to plug that heater in.

The two men Ben (Gary Farmer from Powwow Highway) and The Man (Steve Quimette) find a receipt in the heater's package and they're going to take a trip to a suburban mall to get a refund.  That'll mean much needed money for both.  They travel via the way of the poor, on foot, and they meet a series of truly interesting people from a nurse, a landlady, and several others.

Some help, some do not. ""The Heater"" is an interesting and ironic take on homelessness in Canada.  I confess, I got the film for Gary Farmer, whose superb performance in ""Powwow Highway"" made me an instant fan. I'd like to say I loved ""The Heater"" or I got some great useful truth from it. The hard truth is it's heartbreaking and neither of the aforementioned happened.

1802048,5,B000077VRL,"This examination of the lower classes takes its two characters on a road movie the only way the impoverished can travel--on foot. This amusing societal study watches Ben (Gary Farmer - The Score, Powwow Highway, Ghost Dog) and The Man (Stephen Ouimette - X-Men, The Adjuster), two homeless men with only one possession between them, an electric space heater. Despite cold December weather, the partners are unable to use this modern invention to warm up since they have no outlet to plug the device into. What follows is a poignant and often hilarious chronicle of the two men's journey from the inner city to a suburban shopping mall, battling bitter cold, callous fellow humanity and their difficulty in clinging on to one another.... Full Cast List... Stephen Ouimette as The Man, Tina Keeper as Nurse, Joyce Krenz as Landlady, Gary Farmer as Ben, Sharon Bajer as Long Haired Woman, Jan Skene as Customer Service Rep, Wayne Nicklas as Large Officer, Martine Friesen as Social Worker, Arne MacPherson as Guy, Lee J.

1802049,3,B000077VRL,"Heater is indeed a very interesting Canadian film, but it isn't all that great.

Overall, the film isn't all that much and seemed to take two years to film (you can tell at one point, because we see Sat Dec 13). Also not to mention that the film is very provactive (containing like 40 F-words). What the film is about, are these two poor guys (one a homeless guy (Ouimette), another on the verge of becoming homeless (Gary Farmer)). Ouimette finds a heater one day and tries selling it out on the streets. When trying to sell it at the shelter he's kicked out with his new partner (Farmer) for like a day.

When Farmer finally suggests they return it (after discovering a receipt was tucked in the inner package), a barage of clumbsy acts occur. And then in the end the story ends rather sadly.

If you like documentry films, this movie is for you. If you like mystery films, you might want to pass or at least rent it first.",1171238400,,925,4.366279069767442
1802050,2,B000077VRL,"This movie succeeds at being challenging.

It tries hard to portray the lives of two homeless men in Canada.  In that regard, the script doesn't flow and there are many shots of street intersections that did nothing for the film.  This gives it a brush of realism, but it still makes it difficult not to turn the DVD off and return it to the video store.

The duo here is quite the odd couple.  They have the fat man vs. thin man thing going like on ""The Honeymooners"" and ""The Flintstones,"" but this work also adds differences in race and mental ability to the mix.  In the United States, and perhaps in Canada too, disproportionate numbers of homeless individuals are people of color or persons with mental disabilities.  It pained me to see the disabled guy show off his frostbitten feet.  But still, when given the chance to get boots, he declines.  I hated seeing the Native guy face racism from two police officers.  However, his selective mutism surely didn't help him.  I am worried that this character will reinforce oppressive and prejudiced ideas about fat men and Native men, and especially fat, Native men.  Unlike most buddy films where the duo walks off into the sunset, this alliance is momentary as I imagine they would be in real life.  The pair are constantly smoking.  This makes sense as homeless people may need something to curb their appetites and as being homeless is stressful.

This film may be influenced by the American ""Gridlock'd"" featuring Tupac Shakur.  However, it is slow and meandering.  It makes one sympathize but equally frustrates the viewer.  And perhaps, that was the goal.",1160179200,,1615,4.768953068592058

It does a very good job of putting you into the shoes of two different men. These men are both homeless, but are homeless for different reasons. They end up spending the day with each other. It shows what a huge struggle day to day life can be. It made me thankful to be living the life that I am. I would recommend watching it.",1453507200,2,460,4.179775280898877

1802099,4,B000077VRL,"I really love Indie movies. I am ashamed to say that this movie will only appeal to a small audience. But if you watch this movie, and you are patient, it will work its magic and you will be rewarded. I rated it 4 out of 5 because it was watchable, compelling, and who makes movies these days with this kind of under-stated pathos? The movie centers around a big, tall, polite and perceptive, under-achieving (is that a proper or adequate adjective to apply to any human?), native American man and his smaller, excitable pal-for-a-day who seems to possess to varying degrees, cases of Tourette's, kleptomania, and one or two other psychological problems. (Yes, I was reminded a bit of Cuckoo's Nest but this film is not the emotional star studded roller coaster ride of Cuckoo's.) Filmed in the cold wintry climes of Canada (Winnipeg, Manitoba) right before the Christmas holiday, HEATER reminds us that the coldest thing around the holidays is often the behavior of humans towards other humans. And the most warming thing is often the gracious, giving, humble, humanity expressed by people, who, I believe, are too often looked upon as worthless, lower class, ""under-achieving"" parasites. This movie is a surprisingly compelling, sweet, sad, and simple film. And it is a humbling yet hopeful, homeless buddy movie that reveals much about what we in the west call civilization, good and bad. There are two remarkable scenes I want to point out. The first scene shows, (in the background), municipal workers endangering motorists and pedestrians by interrupting the streetlights in order to connect Christmas decorations to the power grid. The second scene is the long closing credits scene of the city streets being cleared of snow by a fleet of expensive state of the art vehicles, both of which spoke a thousand words about what we consider valuable services during the holidays or any other time. I understand, I know, we have to keep the streets clear, the cars moving, the business of business must not be interrupted, regardless of what it does to our humanity, and therefore our civilization. I believe this film should be among the most viewed of Christmas movies. It might help to keep us aware, that regardless of race, creed, religion or color, it could easily be us, or a loved one, out in the freezing cold, looking for shelter, and something to eat. (I was also reminded of the odd couple pairing of Al Pacino and Gene Hackman in the little known 1973 movie SCARECROW).",1355270400,2,2483,4.872340425531915

7974255,5,B000077VRL,"Sparks of soulmates (don't need to be romantic) happen somewhere between two odd souls and a journey is manifested. A journey short or long, 'conventional' or 'dodgy' initiates. This movie reminds us that the world rhymes in love. And empathy is one of the languages of that love. Two homeless men with complete two different objectives cross paths because of a tangible object- an electric heater. With their unique skill sets (if any) and limitations, they create a bond of trust which seems like almost impossible in this world at the beginning. But it happens. Their stumbling upon every little stone thrown by the universe, make them throb together- their apparently humble existences of two different shades create a beautiful rainbow of harmony of dependency, trust, sacrifice, empathy, and moreover a purpose of being, even be it just for a day. This movie is a bearer of a message of all art forms - a burning passion just for humanity and love. Every character of this movie is meaningful and has a definite and undeniable role, depicting the stage of this world of many different colors of characters. Both the men being at the mercy of the same uncertainty and poverty have two different types of characteristics-one is clam, poised, and has a plan; where the other is a victim of paranoia and maybe Tourette syndrome. The acting of these two main characters are authentic and legitimate. Also the other roles are just and duly fit in their deliverable of acting requirements. Two main roles are used to show that how we all are connected to all. Finally, the movie wins my heart by not trying to glorify anything or judging/indignity other characters for being themselves- but just by projecting the universal compassion that exists so vividly in every shape and form and everywhere.",1458518400,,1796,4.911184210526316
