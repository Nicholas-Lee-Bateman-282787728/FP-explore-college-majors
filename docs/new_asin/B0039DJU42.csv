I had not seen it in that long, so watching it again was almost like seeing it for the first time again. Parts of it started to come back to me. It was nice to revisit those memories. Joan Jett is very convincing as the sister in this movie and I am surprised Michael J. Fox never put out any of his own albums. He is actually a good singer. The story line sets on a  troubled young single mother who's biggest desire seems to be her music, and the rocky relationship between her brother and her. While in a band together, they drift apart into different directions and drama enfolds over parenting issues and theft. If you are big on eighties rock and like to watch those movies like I do, you will really enjoy this one. This movie is going to one day be very hard to find, especially a good playing copy on vhs, so order it today!",1324252800,,978,4.12041884816754
