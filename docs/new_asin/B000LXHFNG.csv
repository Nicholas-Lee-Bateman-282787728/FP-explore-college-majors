2717585,5,B000LXHFNG,"This is from a mother. Im not crazy about Disney movies. But I saw this on TV and I was hooked. I couldn't leave the TV. Its sweet, has great messages, wonderful acting and a lots of fun music. This was a wonderful movie. I would buy this in a second.",1170374400,15,251,3.9411764705882355
2717586,2,B000LXHFNG,"This is the last and final time I will be reviewing this movie.

The movie begins as Izzy Daniels, a boxer, is dancing in the streets. (Can we some Lionel Richie in the background?) He comes across Mary and her friends double-dutching where he says that it looks pretty easy, and all that jazz.

He watches them at a competition, and realizes it looks like fun, so he joins there team, but Mary is hesitant to let him join. Finally, he joins.

But doesn't tell his father. Ah, yes, the plot thickens.

Overall, an ""okay"" movie, but not worth buying if you ask me. It's pretty much like every other Disney Channel movie out there. Person is good at one thing, then does something to disappoint someone else, big happy ending.

Personally, the music was just okay. But everybody wants to be a singer. I mean, Keke Palmer needs to STEP AWAY from the microphone.

Corbin does his best at producing an upbeat track, ""Push It To The Limit"", and ends up making a fairly-decent song, but not great.

Worth watching on Disney Channel when they play it, if you can spare an hour and a half.",1169856000,,1080,4.451776649746193

2717634,5,B000LXHFNG,I've seen Jump In on The Disney Channel before and I liked it right away when I saw it. In Jump In I loved all of the cool moves & stunts they did when they did Double Dutch. Corbin Bleu gave his Best Performance when he played Izzy Daniels the boy who choose Double Dutch over Boxing. When I saw this movie it brought back alot of memories from my Childhood that I use to jump rope alot & doing double dutch. When I went to my aunt's house to spend time with her kids I watched the DVD of Jump In! with my aunt's kids and they liked the movie my cousins are ages 7 and 5. Buy Jump In it's worth watching it and the kids will love it!!!!,1199664000,2,637,3.8702290076335877
2717635,5,B000LXHFNG,"One of the great disappointments of my childhood is that I never learned to double dutch.

One of the great things about the Jump In DVD is that it shows you how to jump double dutch.  The movie itself goes a ways to both demystify double dutch, and show it off in spectacular ways.

Corbin Bleu and Keke Palmer are good spoilers for each other.  He's a little Disney, and she's a little ghetto.  You end up rooting for both of them together.

We wanted to watch this movie over and over in my house; it appealed to the boys as well as girls, and that's hard to do.  It had the boxing, and the cool jumping moves that excited everyone.

It was refreshing to see a movie that wasn't about hooking up or anything sensual at all.  Free from all that garbage, you could just sit back and gawk at the beautiful hair braids, the flashy costumes, and watch the incredible jump rope moves to the booming sound tracks.  There were ear to ear grins at my house, as we kept rewinding to see that last cool move.  That made it one of the 7 happiest black movies of all times.",1192320000,,1063,4.212871287128713
2717636,4,B000LXHFNG,"This DVD was a gift for my wife, who is one of the ""Jump In"" fans in this house. I don't have quite the enthusiasm for this movie that they do, which leads me to believe that it is something of a ""chick flick.""

A tight plot, engaging characters, and quick pace put this show several notches above ""viewable.""

I enjoyed the story of a boy learning how to deal with conflicting demands and responsibilities.

The jump-rope contest choreography is impressive, and helps make this DVD a good buy, although sports purists might question the fusion of jump-rope tricks and boxing in another scene.

Disney Studios seems to be re-discovering the bourgeois inhibitions that made it a global success, so those who require relevance, naughty words, and people with the self-control of an ADHD tomcat in their entertainment will be sorely disappointed in ""Jump In."" Aside from these deficiencies, this is a highly entertaining musical.",1180656000,,926,4.95483870967742

It's so hard to find movies that all of my children (ages 2-10) will sit down and watch and that WE feel good about them watching. This is one of those movies. Made in the same mold as High School Musical, I hope Disney continues to pump out these type of movies. They're slightly cheesy, but a refreshing change from many movies marketed today for kids.",1178928000,3,439,4.301204819277109
2717641,5,B000LXHFNG,"Disney did a fantastic job creating this uplifting/upbeat movie.  The message to kids is awesome -- a girl can be a boxer, and a boy can Double-Dutch -- follow your heart and do what you enjoy despite what nay-sayers think.  I'm 40, my daughter is 20 and my son is 8 -- this being an EXCELLENT movie may be the only thing we all agree on ... and we loved it so much we bought the CD soundtrack (I would HIGHLY recommend the soundtrack).  Very positive hip-hop/rap -- if more kids listened to these tunes, the world would be a happier/safer more encouraging place!!

5 Stars is not high enough of a rating!!  If you only buy one movie this year, buy this one!  Send a positive message back to Disney that this is what kids need to hear, see, do.",1177891200,2,744,4.24113475177305
2717642,5,B000LXHFNG,"This is movie has many great lessons, not just the be true to yourself and don't worry about what your friends think, but I loved the way that Izzy had compassion for Rodney the bully and really hleped turn his life around.  Too often we forget to teach our kids that kids are usually bullies because they don't have the confidence to be something else.  I think the movie does a good job of showing how Izzy was drawn to double dutch but afraid that it wasn't cool as well as being afraid of disappointing his father.  It was refreshing to see a cool guy get past being afraid of being called a loser because he liked something like double dutch.  The jump roping was awesome!  I never knew that people could do all of that with jump ropes!  And I could never even get basic double dutch as a kid.",1176595200,2,798,4.251655629139073
2717643,5,B000LXHFNG,"I watched this with my 11-year-old daughter and enjoyed it as much as she did.  In addition to being an enjoyable movie, there are nice messages.  Gender does not matter if you are doing something you enjoy.  Girls can box, and boys can jump rope.  Maybe this movie will open some doors (or at least eyes) for some kids.  Also, it motivates kids to be physically active, and it glorifies being part of a team.  It teaches kids to be true to themselves and follow their heart.  A quality film.",1173139200,2,492,4.4
2717644,4,B000LXHFNG,"All Izzy Daniels (Corbin Bleu) knows is boxing.  He's the third generation boxer in his family and hopes to be the third to win the coveted Golden Glove.  After defeating neighborhood bully Rodney (Patrick Johnson, Jr.), he's well on his way.

Izzy's neighbor has an obsession all her own - Double Dutch jump rope.  Mary (Keke Palmer) is quite good at it and the leader of a team trying to make the state competition.  Izzy constantly teases Mary and her team mates about their jumping.

All that changes one day when Izzy is forced to take his sister to watch a Double Dutch competition.  He's fascinated by what he sees.  When Mary's team looses one of their members, Izzy agrees to step in while they search for another member but only to help them practice.  He quickly finds that, not only is he good at it, but he loves it.  Even more then boxing.  Can he balance the two sports?  Does he want to?  What will his dad say when he finds out about it?

There's not doubt that this movie is modeled after High School Musical.  Not only does it have similar (but not identical) plot points, but it even stars Corbin Bleu.  But that's not to say this is a bad film.  While I knew where the story was going, I was still drawn into events.  The cast all does a good job acting.  And the Double Dutch scenes were choreographed so well.  They were fun to watch.

This is definitely a movie trying to cash in on the success of High School Musical.  But that doesn't mean it isn't worth watching.  It's an entertaining movie in it's own right.",1172534400,5,1537,4.372340425531915

I liked the music and I was glad to see that the teen boy star Izzy finally was brave enough to follow his own heart and do what made him happy, instead of trying to make his father happy.  I also liked that he made friends with his main boxing competition in the end.  Double Dutch means two long jump ropes are being used, but when I was a young girl at school we just used one rope, with two girls swinging it around and usually just one jumping it, but sometimes two.  We did not do free style with special moves like the kids in 'Jump In'.  I thought that it would be a movie more for girls, but really it is for both boys and girls and lots of fun.  I would recommend it for kids from 8 years and older.",1506124800,,865,4.023391812865497
