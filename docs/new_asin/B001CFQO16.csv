3512257,5,B001CFQO16,"This is one of my favorite series... and here's why:

The characters are great.  Shana is not your usual female lead, she is neither a pushover or just totally brash.  And the male lead is not your usual ""complete dork"" but someone you could grow to like and keeps a strong head on his shoulders despite some of the revelations he has to deal with.

Multiple story arcs keep the anime feeling fresh.  It introduces the ""world"" and rules of that ""world"" in the beginning and then follows a few different arcs that each tie up enough to give you a satisfied feeling.

The animation is nice, the dub is surprisingly good and the supernatural elements are just right.  The anime has some comedy in it and lots of action, but also personal moments that let you get to know the characters better.

Now its in a boxed set and that makes it even more attractive!  A must have for anyone that loves a good solid story and great characters.",1223856000,11,930,4.423529411764706

I really REALLY hope that Shana 2 and 3 become available as well at some point, as this season doesn't even scratch the surface. Overall, a good show and a good buy. You should get it too :D",1335744000,,335,3.869565217391304
3512261,2,B001CFQO16,"I tried not to have too high expectations of this series and hoped that I would just like the series enough to warrant the purchase of this box set on Amazon.

The series starts off with an interesting enough plot: Yuuji's apparently dead and eventually teams with up with Shana.

I thought the first half of the series was pretty interesting with Yuuji and Shana coming to work together to beat their enemies. The other minor characters had some fun moments as well.

However towards the middle of the series once Shana's flashback was shown and when a maid became an important character I slowly started to lose interest and even got kinda bored of the series.

Yuuji and Shana's interaction wasn't nearly as good by then, the plot just because boring and the only entertaining thing left was how hilarious it was to see how Kazumi Yoshida still had no chance with Yuuji.

Based on what I hear of the 2nd and 3rd season, I definitely do not want to continue on after this.

Despite what I say, if you're still interested in watching this series you should probably give it a shot. A lot of people like the action, atmosphere and of course the loli heroine tsundere Shana voiced by Rie Kugimiya. If you didn't have the same complaints as me, or any complaints at all after watching this season, you should definitley consider watching Season 2 and 3.

If you have the same or similar disappointments as me, you probably shouldn't continue on.",1322438400,,1443,4.61328125
3512262,5,B001CFQO16,"Shakugan no Shana is one of the most unique anime's I've seen in the past few years. I've seen 203 animes from start to completeion. Out of those 203 animes, this is one of the series I think about contantly.
The whole concept of reality in Shakugan no Shana, really astounds me. The best way for me to describe this series is broadly. Imagine everything around you being true, with the exception that at one point in time you had a best friend. You have no memory of your best friend because a monster ate him/her a few years ago. When a monster eats your friend in the neither world, his existence begins to fade away, when hes gone, the world treats it as if your friend never existed. Within this neither world exist monsters, and creatures looking for ways to increase there power.--there way of doing so is by eating people to become stronger. Against these mosnter's are those who will kill them to defend the piece.

I would buy this series instantly If I could still buy it for 30$ or less.",1311638400,,999,4.429347826086956

3512268,3,B001CFQO16,"As far as I can see, there are only three reasons I watched this entire season (and am working my way through the second): (1) Margery Daw, (2) Marchosias, and (3) Rie Kugimiya.

Margery and Marchosias are the only characters who are actually INTERESTING. Yuji? Dull, and refuses to die. Shana? Cute, but blandly predictable as the resident tsundere. Pretty much everyone else? Dear god, they can be fun, but they're also DUMB. The whole show is dumb, really, leaving it up to the funny, flawed, obsessive, and gratifyingly complex Margery and Marchosias to provide a much-needed dose of real character.

Rie Kugimiya did Shana's voice, however, and I'm a hopeless sucker for her tsundere voice acting (even if she was 10x more interesting in Toradora).",1290384000,,753,4.968253968253968
3512269,5,B001CFQO16,"I'm a slice of life anime lover.  My first impression of this anime was thrilled that the questions being asked were philosophical.  The question asked to start off the series is ""what makes me me?""  This question is raised in the beginning of the series and is wrestled with lightly throughout.

The rest of the show is exciting, quirky, and an overall enjoyable experience from first episode to last.",1287360000,,402,4.782608695652174
3512270,5,B001CFQO16,I received the shipment in a timely manner and in excellent shape.  Loved the shows! :),1285027200,,87,4.4375
3512271,4,B001CFQO16,"Sakai Yuji is just an ordinary high school student living an ordinary life, with a best friend, and a cute girl who finds him interesting. So far, so average anime right? And yes, as you might suspect, if this isn't your initiation into anime, his normal life is going to be turned upside down before we're done with him -- and by a girl, no less. Nothing new there either. Indeed, moments into the first episode Yuji gets caught in the middle of a battle between demonic creatures called Rinne, and their sworn enemies, Flame Hazes -- indeed one Flame Haze in particular, a girl with flaming eyes and hair. And -- drum roll -- his life is never going to be the same.

But it is only in well-worn story elements and tropes that we can define Shakugan no Shana as average. Because in this case, it isn't the originality, but rather the execution that makes the series worth watching.

First of all, let me state that Shakugan has one of the finest opening episodes of any anime series I have ever seen. It is artistically realized, tightly written and designed, very skillfully employs in medias res, introduces concepts only as necessary for the current action in a given scene, and it is a masterwork of the ""hook.""

This is a series that assumes from the outset that the viewer is anime and story literate.

Unfortunately, the promise of the first episode is not entirely realized throughout the course of the series. Christopher Vogler (in synthesizing Joseph Campbell's themes about story archetypes) wrote extensively about the ""hero's journey,"" with such stages as ""introduction of the ordinary world,"" ""the call to adventure,"" ""rejection of the call,"" etc. I won't write a dissertation on the subject, nor do a point-by-point analysis (too many spoilers would be required) but suffice it say this series is almost a study in Vogler's thesis. And that is both its strength and its weakness.

While the opening episode felt fresh and at times even surprising as it introduced plot devices, as the series progressed it at some levels came to feel more and more like ""been there, done that"" in the arena of story. We've done the normal kid who has something special about him, the magical girl with a supernatural helper, the ""fight the boss, move on to another boss"" series of battles, the love tri- and quadrangles, and frankly the whole save the world thing. At the same time, however, it is the universality that lies at the heart of the hero's quest that pulls us through Shakugan no Shana.

Upon reflection, I find myself somewhat surprised at how slowly the story actually progresses -- and yet, for me, it never felt particularly slow. Which should tell you something about the excellence of the series' execution. Even the handful of filler episodes didn't feel all that much like filler, but further story and character development.

This is not the finest series ever -- but it is worth watching.

The animation is very clean. The character designs feel fairly typical -- they are classic in their lines, with an almost cutesy feel to them. The settings and backgrounds are solid, if not particularly impressive or overtly artistic. Overall, the scenery here seems to be cleanly functional, rather than attempting to raise the aesthetic bar in any sense.

The colors are vibrant, though not overly so -- with, once again no apparent attempt to use the color palette to do anything special, or for that matter thematic.

I am fond of the flaming cinder effect that surrounds Shana in battle, but that's one of the few things that really feels like it stands out visually.

Artistically, in almost every way, this series is simply solid -- but no more. Which, with very real skillful execution, still places it above the average but not in the realm of actual genius.

I enjoyed the music of Shakugan. It was better than average, but didn't so much call attention to itself as simply -- and truly -- enhance the scenes it was meant to underscore. Though none of it feels very original, it more than serves its purpose here. I particularly enjoyed the strings track called Reveil, which I consider more of a theme for the series than the actual theme. The opening and closing songs are both solid pop numbers.

Overall, the sound design is average, but the vocal performances are excellent. The contrast between all-too-normal Yuji and the often acerbic Shana works well within the context of the characters and themes explored. The supporting cast also do an excellent job of bringing life and emotion to their characters.

Comparisons could easily be made between Shakugan and Bleach --- there are similar themes, and similar characters (though some are inverted), especially in the case of Shana and Rukia (of Bleach). These are both young women who aren't human yet must nonetheless learn what it means to be human, and why that is important.

Shana is easily the most interesting and important character -- which is probably why the series is named for her. Her character arc is far and away a better story than the primary plot of heroes trying to stop demonic forces in their attempt at world conquest. We get to see enough of Shana's back story to make us care about her and her predestined fate. As she struggles to find herself and attempts to grow up into a more mature and caring self, it's hard not to cheer for her.

The second tier characters -- in which list I'd even include Yuji -- like most of the elements that make up this story and series get the job done in a dependable manner. One of the few exceptions, a character that rises somewhat above the workaday role she is given, is the Flame Haze Margery Daw. At first she seems like your average well-endowed hard-drinking fighter babe, but as we come to know her back-story a bit, and as we see her struggle to find herself beneath her self-imposed callous mask, she takes on a very real depth.

This is not a particularly original series, but like some typical but solidly written fantasy novel that owes much to Tolkien, Shakugan no Shana takes the familiar and makes it worthwhile through solid execution and good, sympathetic characters with whom we enjoy spending our time. Shana's journey from hard-boiled and single-minded Flame Haze to a person with a growing realization of the need for interpersonal relationships makes her very human and ultimately, despite her hard exterior, very lovable.

If you are not looking for something new and different, but can appreciate familiar themes executed skillfully, then this is definitely a show for you.",1270944000,12,6537,4.7852706299911265
3512272,5,B001CFQO16,"There are very few out there like this that aren't overly comical, action-packed, or sentimental.

This has a healthy mixture of all of those yet doesn't cling to one or the other. The best part is you actually care for the characters and hope for the best for them as they make their transitions.

Again, a great anime and a a great story.

3512274,5,B001CFQO16,"The only negative i can think of this release is it does not have the original uncompressed Japanese audio that was on the japan releases in PCM, here it is downsampled to a low bitrate ac3 mix to fit the english dub on the same discs and use less discs and charge less money.
Also i would have been interested in seeing Shana voiced by the same english actress as Louise from the familiar of Zero for continuity reasons as both feature the same japanese voice actress.

Still the voice actress Here is an old pro and not a newcomer and also not an amateur.  She really stands out as excellent, really reminds me of stage actress.",1238371200,2,630,4.3760683760683765
3512275,5,B001CFQO16,"Here we go again. Another story of a supernatural being coming into the world with challenging feelings all the while fighting evil. So why is this one so different?

I wish I knew. This series compelled me to the very end with its music, art style, and stories. To help put it in perspective: Cowboy Bebop is my favorite (as it is with others) and this series has now tied with it.

When a good anime series ends, I will feel disappointed it's over. But with CB and Shana, I was angry it was over. Why? I wanted more. I still do. When an anime inflicts this type of emotion, it's worthy to own. Shakugan no Shana isn't the greatest story ever told, but it captures you and it doesn't let go.

The balance between action and story telling (character development) is excellent. One doesn't over power the other, and this is what keeps the series going. The conflicts over feelings and doing what's right keeps all the stories together and flows extremely well throughout the 26 episodes. You're guaranteed to have a favorite character by the end of it.

The Pros:
-The artwork is outstanding. No ""scrolling narration"" as seen in many ""better"" anime. The CGI used (Unrestricted Method spells) blends nicely with the art and doesn't overpower any scene. It's not just painted characters on watercolor backgrounds (which frequently have moving action to add realism and aren't static).

-The music is good, but not great. The best feature about this collection is the music does NOT overpower the scene (why production companies do this is a mystery) so you're not trying to figure out what the characters said. That being said, the music ties in well with the action and emotions.

-Sector skipping. You can even skip over the annoying FBI warning!

-Character development is exceptionally done well. Unlike many other anime, this series doesn't close with a finalization of romance. In fact, the ending leaves it so open, a sequel was bound to happen (and thankfully, it has. Now, if Geneon/FUNimation will only get it here!)

-No excessive cussing or ""panty shots"". This series didn't need them to sell it, thank goodness. Note: There are a couple of bathtub scenes, but no nudity. In this instance, the bathtub scene was a nice addition only because the Flame Haze has never had a bath before! Exceptionally done!

Now, sadly, the cons
-There are a few scenes in which it seems the script was altered for American audiences. While I can't quite put my finger on it, it just seems the translation was altered. Luckily, it took nothing away from the story.

-26 episodes isn't enough! I want more! So will you.

It seems there's a huge debate regarding anime and young girls in scant outfits. While I don't understand the basis of the argument (they ARE cartoons), I do know some material seems offensive to some. With that, there is a WARNING I must include.

There is a brother and sister duo that seem to be way too close (including french kissing) and nearly crosses the border on incest. If this type of material or imagery of young girls in their underwear is offensive to you, I would not recommend this series, especially to those under the age of 16.

Personal note: The underwear scene wasn't done to ""sell"" the series. It is part of Shana's transition into the world, where she feels nudity isn't something to be ashamed of. In fact, the interaction between Shana and Yuji regarding this actually shows RESPECT for the situation, not a sell. Don't let something like this deter you from the series. You'll miss out.",1233878400,31,3524,4.719869706840391
3512276,5,B001CFQO16,"Okay before I start I should first say that I was a little aprhensive of buying Shana. The last thing I wanted was yet another preteen herione in mature relationships with full grown that make me feel like a pedofile. However while I do wish the main female characters, or looked, slightly older as the main male lead is only around 13 it's all good. Second I would not recommend this series to any one below the age of 14 as there is a lot of viloance, not terible gorry but a good deal.

Now onto the review. First the positive and with this series that is actually the majority of things. First the voice acting, I have not listened to the Japanese dup for a change as I am usually forced to do with the majority of anime. Rather the english vopice acting is anmong some of the best I've come across. Everyone fits there characters exactly and hit there lines perfectly, for the most part, there are few missteps though they are very few. The animation is excellent, everything moves smoothly and the intergration of 2d animation and 3rd computer work is barely noticible. The character development while not brisk never stops and you truly get to know all ofthe characters, the even side characters. I also like that none of the villians of the series act without understandable reasons. The music to be honest I remeber it being good but an I just can't remember it . . . . Lastly of the positives is the plot which, while dark, is not depressing, unquic and interesting.

Now for the bad parts which though few there are a few. First off, I wanted Shana to be older, she looks like she's a tall 12 years old in many way. Second, while I didn't have a problem with it, main female character's devlopement really focus to much on her falling in love, though it is quiet funny. Lastly I didn't like that there were a number of sub plots left unfinished. While annoying this really doesn't detract from the series greatly.

Now as this is a box set I feel the need to review the box set itself. The dvd cases themselves are the thin pack verity and are pretty sturdy. The cover box is also well made with some nce art work. As for the dvds themselves, I have to say I'm becoming a bigger and bigger fan of Funamation and Gaunex's box sets as they in general leave the DVDs alone outside of craming in six episodes on a disc, which is good. And a last part that I relly liked is that all of the dvds have reversable covers so even though there are few cases you still get all the art work.

In the end I highly recommend buying Shana. It's a great series and is truly enjoyble.",1232582400,,2578,4.3312629399585925
3512277,4,B001CFQO16,"Geneon is known for taking great anime series and dubbing it in the worst possible English manner. They dub any anime series so bad that nothing you do will keep your interest. That being said i was a bit shocked that this series was actually dubbed pretty close to perfection. You get a few annoying voices here and there but overall it's pretty good. The 1st episode digs right into the action when Shana the red haired heroine of the show appears and saves the main male lead of the series. A few episodes after that the action settles for a bit but picks up as the show progresses towards the finale. The story is a bit complicated to explain. I'll try my best as i was a bit confused about the storyline myself. Outside of earth lies 2 realms, one bad, one good. The villains are after the flames of people on earth. That's really all I can say because I've only seen volume 1. I never thought this series would see the light of day because Geneon went bankrupt. But Funimation has picked up on a few of their titles and this one is being re-released in box set form.
