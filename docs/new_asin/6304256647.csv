7866912,5,6304256647,"The third genesis contains episodes 5 and 6, which focus mainly on the enigma known as Rei Ayanami.  Two of the best eva episodes are in this genesis.  As far as mysteries go, we discover more about Shinji's feelings for Rei and the whole plot including Rei and Gendo is begun.
*********************************************************************************************** In episode five, Rei Ayanami is brought up more and more in Shinji's mind as he ponders who she really is and why she pilots the Eva.  His curiousity is heightened as he watched his father's close interactions with Rei and culminates in an embarrasing scene inside Rei's apartment.  However, Shinji's wonderings are put aside as a new angel attacks, one which proves it's worth by taking out Shinji before unit-01 even has a chance to attack.
Episode six shows Shinji to be suprisingly safe after his encounter with the fifth angel, and NERV knows it as well, taking his quick recovery as a sign that he's ready to engage in combat once again.  As Shinji faces his fears, Misato comes up with a daring plan to stop the new angel threat.  But whether or not she'll be in time is yet to be seen, as the angel begins a devasting new attack straight into NERV headquarters itself!  Rei soon comes into play again, as she and Shinji agree to carry out the plan before it is too late, and in the process she reveals much of her own inner feelings regarding the Eva's.",995500800,,1435,4.808943089430894
7866913,5,6304256647,"The series continues to be fascinating with episodes 5 and 6.  We delve into Rei's background and what makes her tick.  She's a fascinating enigma for Shinji to unwrap.  Here Rei returns to duty, and helps Shinji win a battle with a fierce Angel.  More is also learned about the relationships between Shinji, Misato, and the stoic Gendo (Shinji's father).",987465600,,355,4.866666666666666
7866914,5,6304256647,"Neon Genesis Evangelion 0:3 contains episodes 5 and 6 of the series.  And what great episodes they are!  They cover the mysterious EVA pilot, Rei Ayanami, who has recovered from a previous battle.  Shinji knows very little about her, even though he works with her all the time.  But he does know that she gets along with his father better than Shinji himself, or anyone for that matter.  Before he can get to know her, a new Angel strikes and Shinji is severely injured!  Now Misato must organize a new attack strategy. This is one of my favorite volumes because the withdrawn character Rei proves to be a favorite of many, including myself, and these episodes will help reveal who she really is.  Check it out!",982540800,,711,4.595238095238095
7866915,5,6304256647,"With volume three of Neon Genisis Evangelion we get a better understanding of the girl known as Rei, piolet of unit 00. Shinji becomes interested with Rei and tries to get to know her a little better. But as Shinji will find  out the only person Rei shows any emotions to is Gendo, the father Shinji  hates. When another Angel attacks unit 1 is defeated. Only a suicidal plan  by Misato can prevent third impact. This series is in one word flawless. I  my opinion this is my least favorite volume and I still love it!",960940800,,517,4.354166666666667
7866916,5,6304256647,"I believe that with all the hype surrounding pokemon, people should look back a few years back at the massive phenomenon that neon genesis evangelion had with old and new anime fans alike. The story is well paced  dealing with teenage angst and  belonging, and goes beyond conventional  means to create a new and startling theme on the ever popular theme of  robots in anime. I heartily recommend this to everyone, both those who like  anime and those new to it. Christiaan Iken",946425600,2,478,4.710843373493976
