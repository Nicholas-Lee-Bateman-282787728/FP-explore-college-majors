A Legendary Era

Thanks to Wrestlingdvdnews.com for the list, they did not have the blu ray extra's at the time.

Overall, a disappointed set considering most of the matches have been released elsewhere. Unless the blu ray features a gotta have match then i'll wait for this set. The only match I'd like foward to watching is the long awaited Vader VS Cactus match that should have been on Foley's set. I'll wait till WWE does a big sale in there shop to buy this.",1392249600,6,2997,5.053061224489796

6108053,4,B00GSTHCF8,"Well the wwe is finally  going to focus on the wcw pay per veiws. Isure hope they don't clutter up the dvd's with a bunch of late 90's matches.... not when the late 80's and early 90's were more what made wcw the brand that was so diffrent from the wwf, in those days... the wcw back then was more on longer matches not as much of the big fanefare hype but the in ring matches...those bouts with road warriors and the sst or rick rude fighting dustin rhodes... the dangrous alliance running rough shot over almost every wrestler on the roster... sting  vs vader.. ron simmons becoming the first black champion .. the rebirth of the most legendary group of all time THE FOUR HORSE MEN and so much more ... if the wwe fills up the dvd set with the late 90's stuff it will be an injusice to all of the great workers that was before the dark days of a.e.s.h.h. (after eric signs hulk hogan) after 1994 eric's head is so far up hogans butt he couldn't see a good angle or story line if if bit him in the butt. so here's to hopping. J.Cole",1391644800,,1033,4.16
6108065,1,B00GSTHCF8,REPEAT AFTER REPEAT AFTER REPEAT....why buy this when almost everything has been released before??  Unless you are crazy & just have to have every single WCW release.....PASS.,1437091200,,175,5.481481481481482
6108066,3,B00GSTHCF8,Can't wait for volume 2,1434585600,,23,3.8
6108067,4,B00GSTHCF8,Was excited to receive this one. Not as great as Best if Starrcade or The Rise and Fall of WCW in terms of the matches but those are great sets so it's not really a knock on this set. I like sets like these because it's sort of like putting on a visual mixtape. Disc 3 is my favorite disc although all three are solid. I like the energy WCW had as far as hyping up eents even though they buried superior talents and the announcers grow tiresome after awhile of listening. I recommend ir for sure.,1432512000,,496,4.123711340206185
6108068,5,B00GSTHCF8,"I really enjoyed this boxset & can't wait to get vol. 2 of it. So for anyone else that are wcw fans or extreme wrestling fans, do get this boxset of wcw, as you get to see all of there ppv greatest matches",1419206400,,205,3.7906976744186047

6108070,4,B00GSTHCF8,"Good stuff from the WCW vaults.  I was eager to see Vader vs. Cactus Jack from Halloween Havoc but it wasn't as amazing as I thought it would be.  It's good but Foley had topped it in the years that followed.  I was surprised the last PPV match they ever did was actually really good.  Even in decline, WCW could still muster some good content.  Unfortunately, a few repeated matches from other sets.",1412208000,,400,4.424657534246576

6108073,5,B00GSTHCF8,WCW one of the greatest promotions to ever exist and force to be reckon with during the 1980s and 1990s. The matches chosen for this collection are all classics and showcase the company run on the ppv market. From Starrcade to Halloween Havoc to The Great American Bash to Bash At The Beach WCW made its mark and will always be missed but never forgotten.,1404777600,,355,4.476923076923077
6108074,4,B00GSTHCF8,"Another wwe politically driven dvd compilation. I got it for the matches but I mean...there's so much more to wcw then the same people they keep featuring. Of course we all love the most popular wrestlers, but some of the greatest matches were on the ppv and never released.
and of course wwe will still ignore and try to erase Benoit even in wcw.....
I was hoping for matches from road wild 1997 also that never got released in the US.
but most fans know to get those overpriced vhs tapes. At least with the dvd's you can get some of the nitros.",1404259200,,546,4.310679611650485
6108075,2,B00GSTHCF8,"If you want to see some of the same matches, along with some new matches this dvd is fine for you. But there are so many matches they could have choose, instead they repeated alot.",1403481600,,180,4.171428571428572

6108077,4,B00GSTHCF8,"Much of the content was ""recent"" times during WCW's last days, but it was reliving those days once again seeing this DVD...",1400198400,,123,4.636363636363637
6108078,4,B00GSTHCF8,"they have some of the best matches i have ever seen as a wrestling fan of wwe, wcw and etc",1397865600,,90,3.55
6108079,3,B00GSTHCF8,"Solid set of mostly highly entertaining matches, the drawback is most of them have been released on other sets before, there is very little new here.  For Vol. 2 there are several matches I would like to see including...Tully Blanchard & Arn Anderson vs Sting & Lex Luger (1988 Crockett Cup Final), Tully Blanchard & Lex Luger vs Dusty Rhodes & Sting (1987 Crockett Cup Final), Ric Flair vs Barry Whyndam (1987 Crockett Cup), Randy Savage vs Lex Luger (1998 Souled Out), Sting vs Lex Luger (1992 SuperBrawl), Ron Simmons vs Vader (Simmons wins WCW Title), No DQ Steel Cage Ric Flair vs Vader (early 1994 PPV), Ricky Steamboat vs Lex Luger (1989 Great Am Bash), Ric Flair vs Terry Funk (Super Brawl 2000), Kevin Nash Vs Giant (Souled Out 98), Kevin Nash title win over DDP (late spring 99 PPV), The Starrcade 95 Triangle Match, and has the Hogan-Piper Starrcade 96 match ever made it to DVD ??",1395878400,,892,4.610062893081761
6108080,4,B00GSTHCF8,"An important note before I get started based off other reviews & comments in regards to this set in that the very first event that was actually available through pay per view was Starrcade 1987 as every other event before that & some after (like the Crockett Cup & events on the Great American Bash tour) was either viewed through closed circuit (same as the first WrestleMania which also wasn't on PPV) or taped strictly for later VHS distribution but this DVD set is based off their PPV matches alone so matches from events that weren't broadcast on PPV will not be on this set regardless of someone else's personal definition of what a ""pay-per-view"" is.  It should also be noted that each disc on the regular 3 disc version of this set was divided into different time periods such as the NWA era, early WCW years, and the WCW Nitro/Monday Night War period with Booker T hosting this set.

Steel Cage Match: NWA Champion Ronnie Garvin vs. Ric Flair - Both men exchanged chops & traded fist throughout the contest with Garvin using the cage to his advantage to make Flair bleed & heavily focus on attacking that cut while Flair's focus was on Garvin's leg heavily working on it to the point where he wasn't able to stand at one point as this is one of those matches that's more remembered for what happened outside of the match than the actual in ring action itself as the crowd completely turned on Garvin in favor of Flair.
Starrcade '87

NWA United States Champion Barry Windham vs. Dusty Rhodes - Windham had not only recently joined the Horsemen but also captured the U.S. Title that was previously held by Dusty before he was stripped of it leading to this match that the commentators put perfectly as ""Big Brother vs. Little Brother"" as Rhodes was able to stay one step ahead of Barry constantly taking him down & even taking the action to Barry on the concrete floor outside with J.J. Dillion getting involved more than once that didn't always work in his favor before Windham was able to take advantage of a distraction heavily working over Dusty with his claw with Dusty making multiple attempts to escape.  I honestly didn't like this match as I felt it was too heavily one sided instead of being more competitive.
Great American Bash '88
[Rise & Fall Of WCW]

NWA Tag Team Champions Road Warriors vs. Sting & Dusty Rhodes - The Road Warriors had recently turned against their Six Man Tag Team Championship partner Dusty setting up this match here with Sting & Dusty taking control heavily working over the arm with twisting wristlocks while the Warriors attempted to singled out one member striking him down & working over with power moves only for Sting & Dusty to give it all right back & beating the Warriors at their own game using their own tactics before the Warriors focused on Dusty's injured eye with all the action eventually breaking down into a four way brawl.  This was a fun match.
Starrcade '88
[Starrcade: The Essential Collection; The American Dream: The Dusty Rhodes Story]

NWA Champion Ric Flair vs. Ricky Steamboat - Steamboat was heavily in control during the opening moments of the match working over his head with a side headlock & constantly going back to it whenever possible while also winning the exchange of chops on more than one occasion resulting in Flair either going or getting knocked to the outside along with using various aerial offense but Flair was able to gain control on the outside using the ringside environment & out-wrestling him in the ring including working over the legs for the figure four, sacrificing himself to hurt Steamboat & taking shortcuts if possible.  This was the beginning of a trilogy of matches that year between both men that has gone down as one of the classic rivalries in wrestling based off the technical wrestling along with the simple dynamics of ""good vs. evil"" with both men's natural personalities.
Chi-Town Rumble '89
[Greatest Wrestling Stars Of The 80's; Rise & Fall Of WCW]

NWA United States Champion Lex Luger vs. Brian Pillman - Brian dominated a majority of the match with his mix of high flying moves & mat wrestling. He worked on Luger's shoulder with the story being that he was trying to keep Luger off his feet throughout the match which dominated. Luger was on the defense most of the time & his offense consisted of punches, kicks, and clotheslines whenever he was in control as this really came down to who was able to catch the other guy.  This was one of those matches that gives Luger his reputation of being a bad wrestler because Pillman completely carried this match.
Halloween Havoc '89
[Brian Pillman: Loose Cannon]

NWA Champion Ric Flair vs. Sting - This was the big return of Sting after his leg injury early in the year looking for revenge against the man who kicked him out of the Horsemen & had him get injured later that night. To insure a fair fight, Sting's group of friends called ""Dudes With Attitudes"" surrounded the ring to ensure the Horsemen wouldn't interfere while Ole Anderson was handcuffed on the rampway to El Gigante. Sting took the fight right to Flair & dominated him in the early going showing no signs of ring rust as Flair heavily targeted his knee so Sting kept coming back & fighting off Flair's attack.
Great American Bash '90
[History Of The World Heavyweight Championship]

WCW Championship/Steel Cage Match: Lex Luger vs. Barry Windham - This was one of the most famous matches in the history of WCW for all the wrong reasons as this match was to determine the new WCW Champion after Ric Flair left the company a short time earlier and the crowd didn't approve of this as they kept chanting throughout this match ""We Want Flair!"" There was tons of stalling between both men during the first half of the match and never left first gear until the end with Luger doing unfamiliar moves like the DDT while both men tried to come off the top rope at one point but in the end, one man walked away with more than just the WCW Championship.
Great American Bash '91
[History Of The World Heavyweight Championship]

WCW Light Heavyweight Champion Jushin Liger vs. Brian Pillman - Probably the most famous match in Pillman's career as this was the top light-heavyweights from Japan & America fighting in a rematch from their non-televised encounter months earlier when Liger won the championship. Pillman did more mat-wrestling early while Liger used his aerial offense of dropkicks & moonsaults off the top rope both in & out of the ring. When Brian started to pull of his ""Air Pillman"" offense with his flying clothesline & cross bodyblock, Liger tried to ground Pillman by working over his legs with moves like the figure four. This was without a doubt one of the greatest matches in WCW's history when it came to crusierweight/light-heavyweight action. Look out for such moments like Liger executing his ""Liger Bomb"", Pillman executing an impactful DDT, and one hell of a suplex by Liger.
SuperBrawl II '92
[Brian Pillman: Loose Cannon]

War Games Match - Sting's Squadron vs. Dangerous Alliance: Sting, Nikita Koloff, Dustin Rhodes, Ricky Steamboat, Barry Windham vs. Rick Rude, Arn Anderson, Bobby Eaton, Steve Austin, Larry Zbyszko - The War Games returned to using a ""5 vs. 5"" team concept here with the various highlights including one man bleeding during the first period, Steamboat being creative using the top of the cage while him & Rude kept singling out each other throughout the match, the first time I've ever seen a double man Boston Crab submission, an atomic drop with the receiver hitting his head on the roof on the way down, one guy having his head stomped into the middle of both rings, Madusa climbing to the top of the cage on the outside just to slide in a weapon, Rude being turned into a wishbone, the tension between partners Sting & Nikita Koloff, and how the parts of the ring ended up being torn apart. This was a violent match for it's time with multiple men bleeding along the cage & eventually the ring being used as a weapon more than it had been previously resulting in one of the best matches in the history of this concept.
WrestleWar '92
[War Games: WCW's Most Notorious Matches]

Texas Death Match: Cactus Jack vs. Vader - It should be noted that despite Vader being the current WCW Champion that this was a non-title match.  You just knew what to expect from these two men when they started the fight in the isleway & brawled around ringside with Vader taking off his headgear to fight in the opening minute as both men used whatever they could get their hands on to beat on each other including chairshots to different parts of the body & a camera & a table with Cactus using a cactus & both men fighting in Vader's own grave (I can't make this stuff up!) as both men were eventually bleeding fighting in the crowd & the rampway with anyone getting involved feeling the effects as well.  Jesse Ventura said it perfectly on commentary, ""we can't call this a match, this is a fight!""
Halloween Havoc '93

WCW United States Champion Steve Austin vs. Ricky Steamboat - It should be noted for those trivia fans that this is the third championship (Television, Tag Team, U.S.) these two men feuded over in WCW over the previous two years so they knew each other very well & evenly matched in the early moments before an opening allowed Steamboat to heavily work over the arm causing Austin to use dirty tactics to regain the advantage & keep resorting to them to maintain it as they traded momentum back & forth before Austin attempted to use another strategy out of desperation.  These two never had a bad match against each other & this was no exception.
Bash At The Beach '94

Steel Cage Match w/special referee Mr. T: WCW Champion Hulk Hogan vs. Ric Flair - This was the third match in their series as Hogan won at Bash At The Beach while Flair won the rematch at ""Clash Of The Champions"" by countout so to ensure this was the final match, this was also a career ending match for the loser as Mr. T was the referee while celebrities like Muhammed Ali & Tommy ""Hitman"" Herns were at ringside along with Sting. Flair worked over Hogan's bad leg while Hogan came off very aggressive to the point where T had to keep acknowledging Hogan to back off which kept causing conflict between those two men as this got real wild in the end with Sherri, Sting, Jimmy Hart, a masked man, and handcuffs all got involved in the match.  As a side note, the part where the masked man was revealed to be Brutus Beefcake is not shown here.
Halloween Havoc '94
[History Of The World Heavyweight Championship]

Sting, Lex Luger, Randy Savage vs. The Outsiders - This match was subtitled ""The Hostile Takeover"" as this was ""The Outsiders"" in-ring debut after appearing on WCW's television shows for weeks. It should also be noted that this was suppose to be a six man tag with WCW's team against Hall & Nash with a mystery partner only for Hall & Nash to go it alone & Luger being knocked out in the opening minutes making this a regular tag team match. This was a good tag team match with each man playing to their strengths (Nash's size & power, Sting & Hall's in-ring ability, Savage's unpredictability) along with Hall & Nash doing the classic ""double teaming behind the referee's back"" tactics various times. The eventual reveal of ""the third man"" & the birth of the nWo became one of the most infamous moments in wrestling history.
Bash At The Beach '96
[nWo: Back In Black; nWo: The Revolution]

No Disqualification Match: Diamond Dallas Page vs. Randy Savage - It should be noted that Elizabeth was in Savage's corner while the ex-Diamond Doll & who Savage exposed as Page's real life wife Kimberly returned to DDP's corner for the first time in over a year.  Savage kept trying to avoid Page by constantly going to the outside only for DDP to take the fight out there & into the crowd with a trash can being used as a weapon before making their way back to ringside with the women getting involved & objects around ringside used as a weapons along with some innocent people getting taken out as well with the biggest shocker not only being WHO ended up counting the fall but the aftermath seeing the nWo in a state that we've never seen them previously.  This was not only a very physical & wild fight.
Spring Stampede '97

WCW Crusierweight Champion Eddie Guerrero vs. Rey Mysterio - This had a ""Title vs. Mask"" stipulation meaning that Rey had to win the championship or unmask while it should be noted that he was wearing an outfit representing to the comic book/movie ""The Phantom"" with his mask attached to the outfit.  Rey came out with very fast paced offense from either a springboard position or off the top rope including an over the top crossbody that sent both men over the top rope only for Rey to hold on while Eddie hit the guardrail causing Eddie to pick up the intensity using the ringside steps & heavily focusing on Rey's back with various impactful moves such a multiple backbreakers or stretch submissions including his father's Gory Guerrero Special while also continuing to rip at the mask as they traded momentum with Rey doing some aerial offense including some new offense that he would go on record saying that he did once & never again after this match along with an early version of what we now know as the West Coast Pop while Eddie continued to deliver intense impactful moves like a snap powerbomb & top rope crucifix drop.  This has the reputation of being the greatest crusierweight match in WCW history & it's hard to argue that point after viewing this match.
Halloween Havoc '97
[Rey Mysterio: 619; Rey Mysterio: Biggest Little Man; Cheating Death, Stealing Life: The Eddie Guerrero Story; Wrestling's Highest Flyers]

Special Referee - Roddy Piper: Randy Savage vs. Bret Hart - Savage was coming into this match looking for revenge against Hart for costing him the WCW Championship with the wild card being Roddy Piper was both men had assaulted Piper in recent months with Piper making it clear how he would officiate early on by physically forcing one of the wrestlers to start the match as both men gave as much as they received with their punches & bending the rules along with fighting throughout the crowd as Bret was more aggressive than he's previously been using the environment around ringside to his advantage targeting Savage's injured knee to the point where Savage was fighting on one knee with some of his offense hurting himself but was also able to use some of Bret's trademark moves against him.  Both of these men have fought each other in the past but never in a one on one match on pay-per-view so this was a dream match in that regard & was a solid contest between both men.
Slamboree '98

Special Referee - Dean Malenko: WCW Cruiserweight Champion Chris Jericho vs. Juventud Guerrera - Both men were evenly matched early with Malenko physically showing that he wasn't going to allow Jericho to push the rules or be bullied with Juvi using his aerial offense that was a higher risk in this case due to the ring setup on an elevated stage such as a crossbody off the top rope over the padded stage to the street asphalt floor but Jericho was able to keep staying one step ahead of Juvi being able to keep catching & countering his offense into his own such as a tombstone or powerbomb while constantly taunting him whenever possible.  This was a quality match between both men with the Malenko factor not playing much of a role to the point where it overshadowed their effort.
Road Wild '98

WCW Champion Goldberg vs. Diamond Dallas Page - This match started off very aggressive with Goldberg shoving Page into the corner with Page responding with an armdrag before both men locked up with such intensity that they ended up pushing each other to the outside as they traded momentum back & forth in the ring from DDP's leg sweep takedowns to Goldberg applying the cross armbreaker with DDP responding in a jaw breaker while Goldberg came back shoving him to the floor during an attempt at the Diamond Cutter. DDP attempted to ground him with a front facelock only for Goldberg to use his power for various slams with DDP responding with a head scissors takedown & flying clothesline while also avoiding the spear causing Goldberg to hurt his shoulder but still fought with one arm including a slam & the spear as they continued to trade counters from the Jackhammer into the Diamond Cutter & a suplex into the Jackhammer. This was possibly Goldberg's best match in WCW strictly from an in-ring wrestling standpoint as DDP brought out a more physical side of Goldberg in the ring than anyone before him to the point where this match was named Match Of The Year by WCW Magazine that year.
Halloween Havoc '98
[Rise & Fall Of WCW; Goldberg: Ultimate Collection]

WCW Champion Jeff Jarrett vs. Booker T - This was similar to the Luger/Windham match in that this match was infamous for all the wrong reasons. It was originally scheduled to be Hollywood Hogan vs. Jeff Jarrett but Jarrett laid down at Vince Russo's request so Hogan could win the WCW Championship before Russo came back out later to fire Hogan, claim Jarrett to still be the World Champion, and awarded the title shot to Booker T...who already had a match (and lost) against Kanyon earlier that night too. This was your stereotypical Jarrett match in that it had a brawl through the crowd & ringside area including Booker taking a piledriver on the announce table that didn't give one bit as they traded momentum throughout the rest of the contest.
Bash At The Beach '00
[History Of The World Heavyweight Championship]

Ladder Match: Jung Dragons vs. 3 Count vs. Jamie Knoble & Evan Karagias - Shannon Moore & Shane Helms vs. Jamie Noble & Evan Karagis vs. Kaz Hayashi & Jimmy Yang - It was during this period in WCW that the crusierweight division had the most focus on it than it has in over a year with all six of these men stealing the show every chance they had but this match was different in that although it's setup as a three team ladder match, the one person who grabs the contract at the top would receive the title match against Crusierweight Champion Chavo Guerrero who also joined in on commentary for this match. This match had it's moments full of crazy spots & moments like Yang dropkicking the ladder into Noble & Evan followed by Kaz doing a moonsault onto the ladder with both underneath, a botched backdrop on Kaz that caused him to land on his head instead of the ladder, back to back to back various dives from the ring to the outside with Noble being shoved off the ladder onto everyone on the outside, another ladder being brought into the match to be made a scaffold where Evan caught Kaz & powerslammed him off of it, Shane Helms with the ""world's highest neckbreaker"", and Shannon Moore's head scissors taking Yang off the scaffold to the floor. If you only know these guys from their runs in WWE then you don't know what your missing as this match was the match of the night at that PPV as it was the crusierweight division that was saving the WCW product at that time. It wasn't as crazy as the T.L.C. matches in WWE but these guys put on one hell of a performance in what many consider the last quality Starrcade match in the history of the event.

[The Ladder Match]

Falls Count Anywhere Match: WCW Champion Scott Steiner vs. Diamond Dallas Page - This started out as a brawl & didn't let up as it went to the outside in the opening minutes with bodies being thrown into the guardrail at ringside & brawling throughout the crowd with both men using whatever weapon they could get their hands on from trash cans to a table along with various weapons from the fans themselves resulting in both men bleeding as the fight continued in the ring with both men trading blows & having no issues resorting to desperate tactics or use more weapons to beat on each other.  This was the final PPV match in the history of the original WCW and they went out with a bang as this was a physical intense fight from start to finish.
Greed '01

(Blu-Ray) Thunderdome Cage Match w/special referee Bruno Sammartino: Ric Flair & Sting vs. Great Muta & Terry Funk - This match was the debut of WCW's cage that would later be known under different names but rarely used (Chamber Of Horrors & Caged Heat) as it was a steel cage that was so big that it also encased the outside ringside area with the top dented in & electrified so escape wasn't possible along with some extra effects such as a rope hanging in the top corner with a funny note that one part of the cage actually catching on fire with Muta having his own special way to put it out but the only way to win the match would be the ""designated terminators"" in either Ole Anderson or Gary Hart throwing in the towel signaling a surrender for his team.  This started off as a normal tag match but eventually broke down into a tornado tag that saw the cage come into play various times from wrestlers pushing their opponents bodies into & even through the cage while everyone did fight on different on different levels of the cage at one point including being ""Tarzan"" swinging on the hanging rope in the corner with one man performing a ""death defying leap"" off the cage into the ring with things getting so hot & heated between EVERYONE in the match that it would more than just the competitors who got physical.  This was a very unique match for it's time that stands the test of time to this day as this was a physical war.

[Legends Of Wrestling: Ric Flair & Sgt. Slaughter]

(Blu-Ray) Alex Wright vs. Jean Paul Levesque - Both men made their WCW PPV's debut here & were undefeated as both men having the same strategy of working over their opponents arms with Levesque resorting to a ground game working over the arm with armbars & twisting while Wright was using various takedowns such as armdrags & head scissors with Levesque picking up the intensity with more strikes & power moves working over the back.  This match was only relevant for it being the PPV debut & only WCW PPV match in the career of the future ""Triple H"" as we did seen signs of what has become his trademark offensive tactics but this was a match that would have been better suited on his recent DVD set & is really out of place on this set.
Starrcade '94

(Blu-Ray) Dennis Rodman vs. Randy Savage - Both men were ""uncensored"" on the mic towards each other before the match started off brawling in & out of the ring with Rodman resorting to using the ringside area to his advantage & Savage showing that he had no problem being the rules himself as anyone who got in both men's way was taken out in the process with this fight being taken all around the backstage area from the garbage to a port-a-potty.  Both men have a reputation of being very wild & unpredictable so this match was exactly what you expected in that it was a very entertaining brawl, my favorite celebrity match in WCW, and what turned out to be Savage's last WCW PPV match.
Road Wild '99

(Blu-Ray) w/Special Referee - Eric Bischoff: Hulk Hogan vs. Billy Kidman - Hulk Hogan at this time was completely different than we've ever seen him before as it Hogan was a ""John Wayne"" type character as it wasn't ""Hulk Hogan"" fighting but Terry Borela fighting for his career and was dressed in his street clothes with ""F.U.N.B."" labeled on the back of his vest (The N.B. stood for New Blood, you can figure out for yourself what the other two letters meant) as Hogan was more intense than he's known for as the new relaxed rules of WCW during this time made it was a glorified hardcore match with chairs & tables being used as Kidman's speed went against Hogan's power with Bischoff as the biased referee adding to the match & making for some entertaining moments. This was the most unique Hogan match I can recall seeing him in & I think because of that fact, it was one of Hogan's best during his WCW run.
Slamboree '00

Most of the matches on here were quality in their the significance of the moment or the in-ring action alone with the only heavy negative being a lot of matches on here have either been previously released either on multiple sets (Rey vs. Eddie up to four different times) or on other WCW related collections (Rise & Fall Of WCW, Starrcade, History Of World Championship) including some that have already been released in the past two years (War Games, nWo: The Revolution, Goldberg) when there were plenty of suitable replacements available in their vault that have yet to be released or haven't been released in a very long time such as removing the War Games match in favor of a BattleBowl or World War 3 battle royal.  This is a nice set for the average consumer or those new to WCW while there is many unreleased matches on here despite the repeats that I would still recommend this collection to check out & hope it gets enough sales that a Volume Two would be released.",1393718400,12,24919,4.588182430914402
6108081,4,B00GSTHCF8,"An important note before I get started based off other reviews & comments in regards to this set in that the very first event that was actually available through pay per view was Starrcade 1987 as every other event before that & some after (like the Crockett Cup & events on the Great American Bash tour) was either viewed through closed circuit (same as the first WrestleMania which also wasn't on PPV) or taped strictly for later VHS distribution but this DVD set is based off their PPV matches alone so matches from events that weren't broadcast on PPV will not be on this set regardless of someone else's personal definition of what a ""pay-per-view"" is.  It should also be noted that each disc on the regular 3 disc version of this set was divided into different time periods such as the NWA era, early WCW years, and the WCW Nitro/Monday Night War period with Booker T hosting this set.

Steel Cage Match: NWA Champion Ronnie Garvin vs. Ric Flair - Both men exchanged chops & traded fist throughout the contest with Garvin using the cage to his advantage to make Flair bleed & heavily focus on attacking that cut while Flair's focus was on Garvin's leg heavily working on it to the point where he wasn't able to stand at one point as this is one of those matches that's more remembered for what happened outside of the match than the actual in ring action itself as the crowd completely turned on Garvin in favor of Flair.
Starrcade '87

NWA United States Champion Barry Windham vs. Dusty Rhodes - Windham had not only recently joined the Horsemen but also captured the U.S. Title that was previously held by Dusty before he was stripped of it leading to this match that the commentators put perfectly as ""Big Brother vs. Little Brother"" as Rhodes was able to stay one step ahead of Barry constantly taking him down & even taking the action to Barry on the concrete floor outside with J.J. Dillion getting involved more than once that didn't always work in his favor before Windham was able to take advantage of a distraction heavily working over Dusty with his claw with Dusty making multiple attempts to escape.  I honestly didn't like this match as I felt it was too heavily one sided instead of being more competitive.
Great American Bash '88
[Rise & Fall Of WCW]

NWA Tag Team Champions Road Warriors vs. Sting & Dusty Rhodes - The Road Warriors had recently turned against their Six Man Tag Team Championship partner Dusty setting up this match here with Sting & Dusty taking control heavily working over the arm with twisting wristlocks while the Warriors attempted to singled out one member striking him down & working over with power moves only for Sting & Dusty to give it all right back & beating the Warriors at their own game using their own tactics before the Warriors focused on Dusty's injured eye with all the action eventually breaking down into a four way brawl.  This was a fun match.
Starrcade '88
[Starrcade: The Essential Collection; The American Dream: The Dusty Rhodes Story]

NWA Champion Ric Flair vs. Ricky Steamboat - Steamboat was heavily in control during the opening moments of the match working over his head with a side headlock & constantly going back to it whenever possible while also winning the exchange of chops on more than one occasion resulting in Flair either going or getting knocked to the outside along with using various aerial offense but Flair was able to gain control on the outside using the ringside environment & out-wrestling him in the ring including working over the legs for the figure four, sacrificing himself to hurt Steamboat & taking shortcuts if possible.  This was the beginning of a trilogy of matches that year between both men that has gone down as one of the classic rivalries in wrestling based off the technical wrestling along with the simple dynamics of ""good vs. evil"" with both men's natural personalities.
Chi-Town Rumble '89
[Greatest Wrestling Stars Of The 80's; Rise & Fall Of WCW]

NWA United States Champion Lex Luger vs. Brian Pillman - Brian dominated a majority of the match with his mix of high flying moves & mat wrestling. He worked on Luger's shoulder with the story being that he was trying to keep Luger off his feet throughout the match which dominated. Luger was on the defense most of the time & his offense consisted of punches, kicks, and clotheslines whenever he was in control as this really came down to who was able to catch the other guy.  This was one of those matches that gives Luger his reputation of being a bad wrestler because Pillman completely carried this match.
Halloween Havoc '89
[Brian Pillman: Loose Cannon]

NWA Champion Ric Flair vs. Sting - This was the big return of Sting after his leg injury early in the year looking for revenge against the man who kicked him out of the Horsemen & had him get injured later that night. To insure a fair fight, Sting's group of friends called ""Dudes With Attitudes"" surrounded the ring to ensure the Horsemen wouldn't interfere while Ole Anderson was handcuffed on the rampway to El Gigante. Sting took the fight right to Flair & dominated him in the early going showing no signs of ring rust as Flair heavily targeted his knee so Sting kept coming back & fighting off Flair's attack.
Great American Bash '90
[History Of The World Heavyweight Championship]

WCW Championship/Steel Cage Match: Lex Luger vs. Barry Windham - This was one of the most famous matches in the history of WCW for all the wrong reasons as this match was to determine the new WCW Champion after Ric Flair left the company a short time earlier and the crowd didn't approve of this as they kept chanting throughout this match ""We Want Flair!"" There was tons of stalling between both men during the first half of the match and never left first gear until the end with Luger doing unfamiliar moves like the DDT while both men tried to come off the top rope at one point but in the end, one man walked away with more than just the WCW Championship.
Great American Bash '91
[History Of The World Heavyweight Championship]

WCW Light Heavyweight Champion Jushin Liger vs. Brian Pillman - Probably the most famous match in Pillman's career as this was the top light-heavyweights from Japan & America fighting in a rematch from their non-televised encounter months earlier when Liger won the championship. Pillman did more mat-wrestling early while Liger used his aerial offense of dropkicks & moonsaults off the top rope both in & out of the ring. When Brian started to pull of his ""Air Pillman"" offense with his flying clothesline & cross bodyblock, Liger tried to ground Pillman by working over his legs with moves like the figure four. This was without a doubt one of the greatest matches in WCW's history when it came to crusierweight/light-heavyweight action. Look out for such moments like Liger executing his ""Liger Bomb"", Pillman executing an impactful DDT, and one hell of a suplex by Liger.
SuperBrawl II '92
[Brian Pillman: Loose Cannon]

War Games Match - Sting's Squadron vs. Dangerous Alliance: Sting, Nikita Koloff, Dustin Rhodes, Ricky Steamboat, Barry Windham vs. Rick Rude, Arn Anderson, Bobby Eaton, Steve Austin, Larry Zbyszko - The War Games returned to using a ""5 vs. 5"" team concept here with the various highlights including one man bleeding during the first period, Steamboat being creative using the top of the cage while him & Rude kept singling out each other throughout the match, the first time I've ever seen a double man Boston Crab submission, an atomic drop with the receiver hitting his head on the roof on the way down, one guy having his head stomped into the middle of both rings, Madusa climbing to the top of the cage on the outside just to slide in a weapon, Rude being turned into a wishbone, the tension between partners Sting & Nikita Koloff, and how the parts of the ring ended up being torn apart. This was a violent match for it's time with multiple men bleeding along the cage & eventually the ring being used as a weapon more than it had been previously resulting in one of the best matches in the history of this concept.
WrestleWar '92
[War Games: WCW's Most Notorious Matches]

Texas Death Match: Cactus Jack vs. Vader - It should be noted that despite Vader being the current WCW Champion that this was a non-title match.  You just knew what to expect from these two men when they started the fight in the isleway & brawled around ringside with Vader taking off his headgear to fight in the opening minute as both men used whatever they could get their hands on to beat on each other including chairshots to different parts of the body & a camera & a table with Cactus using a cactus & both men fighting in Vader's own grave (I can't make this stuff up!) as both men were eventually bleeding fighting in the crowd & the rampway with anyone getting involved feeling the effects as well.  Jesse Ventura said it perfectly on commentary, ""we can't call this a match, this is a fight!""
Halloween Havoc '93

WCW United States Champion Steve Austin vs. Ricky Steamboat - It should be noted for those trivia fans that this is the third championship (Television, Tag Team, U.S.) these two men feuded over in WCW over the previous two years so they knew each other very well & evenly matched in the early moments before an opening allowed Steamboat to heavily work over the arm causing Austin to use dirty tactics to regain the advantage & keep resorting to them to maintain it as they traded momentum back & forth before Austin attempted to use another strategy out of desperation.  These two never had a bad match against each other & this was no exception.
Bash At The Beach '94

Steel Cage Match w/special referee Mr. T: WCW Champion Hulk Hogan vs. Ric Flair - This was the third match in their series as Hogan won at Bash At The Beach while Flair won the rematch at ""Clash Of The Champions"" by countout so to ensure this was the final match, this was also a career ending match for the loser as Mr. T was the referee while celebrities like Muhammed Ali & Tommy ""Hitman"" Herns were at ringside along with Sting. Flair worked over Hogan's bad leg while Hogan came off very aggressive to the point where T had to keep acknowledging Hogan to back off which kept causing conflict between those two men as this got real wild in the end with Sherri, Sting, Jimmy Hart, a masked man, and handcuffs all got involved in the match.  As a side note, the part where the masked man was revealed to be Brutus Beefcake is not shown here.
Halloween Havoc '94
[History Of The World Heavyweight Championship]

Sting, Lex Luger, Randy Savage vs. The Outsiders - This match was subtitled ""The Hostile Takeover"" as this was ""The Outsiders"" in-ring debut after appearing on WCW's television shows for weeks. It should also be noted that this was suppose to be a six man tag with WCW's team against Hall & Nash with a mystery partner only for Hall & Nash to go it alone & Luger being knocked out in the opening minutes making this a regular tag team match. This was a good tag team match with each man playing to their strengths (Nash's size & power, Sting & Hall's in-ring ability, Savage's unpredictability) along with Hall & Nash doing the classic ""double teaming behind the referee's back"" tactics various times. The eventual reveal of ""the third man"" & the birth of the nWo became one of the most infamous moments in wrestling history.
Bash At The Beach '96
[nWo: Back In Black; nWo: The Revolution]

No Disqualification Match: Diamond Dallas Page vs. Randy Savage - It should be noted that Elizabeth was in Savage's corner while the ex-Diamond Doll & who Savage exposed as Page's real life wife Kimberly returned to DDP's corner for the first time in over a year.  Savage kept trying to avoid Page by constantly going to the outside only for DDP to take the fight out there & into the crowd with a trash can being used as a weapon before making their way back to ringside with the women getting involved & objects around ringside used as a weapons along with some innocent people getting taken out as well with the biggest shocker not only being WHO ended up counting the fall but the aftermath seeing the nWo in a state that we've never seen them previously.  This was not only a very physical & wild fight.
Spring Stampede '97

WCW Crusierweight Champion Eddie Guerrero vs. Rey Mysterio - This had a ""Title vs. Mask"" stipulation meaning that Rey had to win the championship or unmask while it should be noted that he was wearing an outfit representing to the comic book/movie ""The Phantom"" with his mask attached to the outfit.  Rey came out with very fast paced offense from either a springboard position or off the top rope including an over the top crossbody that sent both men over the top rope only for Rey to hold on while Eddie hit the guardrail causing Eddie to pick up the intensity using the ringside steps & heavily focusing on Rey's back with various impactful moves such a multiple backbreakers or stretch submissions including his father's Gory Guerrero Special while also continuing to rip at the mask as they traded momentum with Rey doing some aerial offense including some new offense that he would go on record saying that he did once & never again after this match along with an early version of what we now know as the West Coast Pop while Eddie continued to deliver intense impactful moves like a snap powerbomb & top rope crucifix drop.  This has the reputation of being the greatest crusierweight match in WCW history & it's hard to argue that point after viewing this match.

[Rey Mysterio: 619; Rey Mysterio: Biggest Little Man; Cheating Death, Stealing Life: The Eddie Guerrero Story; Wrestling's Highest Flyers]

Special Referee - Roddy Piper: Randy Savage vs. Bret Hart - Savage was coming into this match looking for revenge against Hart for costing him the WCW Championship with the wild card being Roddy Piper was both men had assaulted Piper in recent months with Piper making it clear how he would officiate early on by physically forcing one of the wrestlers to start the match as both men gave as much as they received with their punches & bending the rules along with fighting throughout the crowd as Bret was more aggressive than he's previously been using the environment around ringside to his advantage targeting Savage's injured knee to the point where Savage was fighting on one knee with some of his offense hurting himself but was also able to use some of Bret's trademark moves against him.  Both of these men have fought each other in the past but never in a one on one match on pay-per-view so this was a dream match in that regard & was a solid contest between both men.
Slamboree '98

Special Referee - Dean Malenko: WCW Cruiserweight Champion Chris Jericho vs. Juventud Guerrera - Both men were evenly matched early with Malenko physically showing that he wasn't going to allow Jericho to push the rules or be bullied with Juvi using his aerial offense that was a higher risk in this case due to the ring setup on an elevated stage such as a crossbody off the top rope over the padded stage to the street asphalt floor but Jericho was able to keep staying one step ahead of Juvi being able to keep catching & countering his offense into his own such as a tombstone or powerbomb while constantly taunting him whenever possible.  This was a quality match between both men with the Malenko factor not playing much of a role to the point where it overshadowed their effort.
Road Wild '98

WCW Champion Goldberg vs. Diamond Dallas Page - This match started off very aggressive with Goldberg shoving Page into the corner with Page responding with an armdrag before both men locked up with such intensity that they ended up pushing each other to the outside as they traded momentum back & forth in the ring from DDP's leg sweep takedowns to Goldberg applying the cross armbreaker with DDP responding in a jaw breaker while Goldberg came back shoving him to the floor during an attempt at the Diamond Cutter. DDP attempted to ground him with a front facelock only for Goldberg to use his power for various slams with DDP responding with a head scissors takedown & flying clothesline while also avoiding the spear causing Goldberg to hurt his shoulder but still fought with one arm including a slam & the spear as they continued to trade counters from the Jackhammer into the Diamond Cutter & a suplex into the Jackhammer. This was possibly Goldberg's best match in WCW strictly from an in-ring wrestling standpoint as DDP brought out a more physical side of Goldberg in the ring than anyone before him to the point where this match was named Match Of The Year by WCW Magazine that year.

WCW Champion Jeff Jarrett vs. Booker T - This was similar to the Luger/Windham match in that this match was infamous for all the wrong reasons. It was originally scheduled to be Hollywood Hogan vs. Jeff Jarrett but Jarrett laid down at Vince Russo's request so Hogan could win the WCW Championship before Russo came back out later to fire Hogan, claim Jarrett to still be the World Champion, and awarded the title shot to Booker T...who already had a match (and lost) against Kanyon earlier that night too. This was your stereotypical Jarrett match in that it had a brawl through the crowd & ringside area including Booker taking a piledriver on the announce table that didn't give one bit as they traded momentum throughout the rest of the contest.

This match had it's moments full of crazy spots & moments like Yang dropkicking the ladder into Noble & Evan followed by Kaz doing a moonsault onto the ladder with both underneath, a botched backdrop on Kaz that caused him to land on his head instead of the ladder, back to back to back various dives from the ring to the outside with Noble being shoved off the ladder onto everyone on the outside, another ladder being brought into the match to be made a scaffold where Evan caught Kaz & powerslammed him off of it, Shane Helms with the ""world's highest neckbreaker"", and Shannon Moore's head scissors taking Yang off the scaffold to the floor. If you only know these guys from their runs in WWE then you don't know what your missing as this match was the match of the night at that PPV as it was the crusierweight division that was saving the WCW product at that time.

Barry Windham vs Dusty Rhodes is AWESOME!  Love that match - Windham is great in it - he was a great Horseman, better than Luger in my opinion.  The Horsemen with Windham was the best version IMO.  SPOILER ALERT******  Watch when Windham beats Rhodes and just kneels over him and looks at him and kinda lifts his arms up.  He looks possessed.  Always remembered that.  So cool.  Intense match.  They should try doing an 80s NWA history dvd and have people talk about it and talk to Flair, JJ Dillon, etc....and have a bunch of matches.  But just feature the 80s NWA because IMO that was the best era and company in the history of the sport.

It should be noted that these are just PPV matches so you won't see any matches from older Great American Bashes or older Starrcade's because they weren't on PPV at that time.  Let's get started.

Up first is a match from the very first PPV that the NWA did in 1987.  It was the world title cage match between Ronnie Garvin and Ric Flair in Chicago at Starrcade.  First of all, I have never and will never understand how Garvin was put over as a world champion.  Next, I believe that the NWA made a huge mistake by having this event come from Chicago because Flair was over huge there and the NWA didn't want that.  They were trying to branch out like WWE but they should have stayed in the Greensboro area for this one.  Now the match is pretty good, not as good as the match they had in Detroit a few months earlier where Garvin beat him for the belt, but it was pretty good.  There was some good back and forth and some excellent cage work from the top rope but it just wasn't as good as you would think it would be.  The best part was seeing Flair win his 5th world title in this bloody affair, a title that he would hold for over a year and a half.

The next match is from Great American Bash 1988 and featured Barry Windham defending the US title against Dusty Rhodes.  I have often felt that Barry may have been one of the most underrated wrestlers of all time but you wouldn't know it if you watch this awesome contest.  This was a great match from start to finish and did feature Barry retaining the title in a 15 minute classic.  I have never been a huge Dusty fan so any time that I got to see him lose I was happy.  Needless to say, I was happy when he lost at this one.

The next match was a dream match of sorts and saw The Road Warriors defending the tag titles against Dusty Rhodes and Sting at Starrcade 1988.  This match was just fantastic and I remember loving it as a kid because 3 out of the 4 contestants involved were some of my favorites.  The build up to the match was just classic as The Warriors would turn on Dusty in violent fashion.  I remember them just destroying Dusty and then removing one of their spikes of of their shoulder pads and stabbing Dusty in the eye with it.  Sting would get involved and thus we have a match set.  The match had everything from speed to power moves to aerial moves but the DQ finish at the end kind of ruins it for me.  I would have loved to have seen a clear cut winner.  Still, it is a good contest.

The next match is an instant classic and features Ric Flair defending his world title against Ricky Steamboat at the Chi-Town Rumble in 1989.  Most people consider this one of the greatest matches of all time and of course this was the first match in their great 3 match trilogy in 1989.  I think this was the weakest of the 3 (now that's saying something) but it was still a fantastic contest.  It is short clocking in at  a mere 23 minutes but it was a back and forth classic that saw the highs and lows of a great wrestling contest.  It was a bit of a shock to see Ricky claim the world title but still, it was a great contest.

The next match was a US title showdown between champion Lex Luger and challenger Brian Pillman at Halloween Havoc 1989.  To me, this was a surprise choice to put on here.  I would have put on the Thunderdome match but this is still a great match.  Pillman was, to a degree, at the height of his career here.  He really pushed Luger to the limit and there were moments when I thought he was going to win the title but Luger proved to be just a little bit too much for him.  This is a great 16 minute contest.

The last match off of disc 1 is the world title match between Ric Flair and Sting from Great American Bash 1990.  This match should be retired because it is on so many other DVD sets.  I honestly think if I was choosing a match from 1990, I would have picked the title match between Luger and Flair from Wrestle War 1990.  Now that was a great 40 minute contest.  This match here is good with Sting picking up the big win but I have seen it too many times now that it has kind of lost its luster to me.  If you have never seen this match then I think you will enjoy it.

The first match on disc 2 was to crown a new WCW world champion.  It saw US champion Lex Luger battle Barry Windham in a cage match at Great American Bash 1991.  Ric Flair was supposed to take on Barry here and drop the world title to him but he left due to some disputes within the company and took the world title with him so they had a tournament and these were the final two to battle it out to become new world champion.  Honestly, this match is kind of boring.  There is really nothing to look forward to.  I was looking forward to a classic but just about every time that I watch it, I fall asleep.  Maybe it has something to do with the fact that Barry hated Luger at the time and maybe he didn't want to make Luger look good, I don't know.

The next match is a great contest for the Light Heavyweight title as Jushin Liger battled Brian Pillman at Super Brawl II.  I remember when I saw this match as a young kid that I had never quite seen a match like this (if you watch it now, you wouldn't be as impressed).  However, place yourself back in 1992 and you have to be impressed.  Liger did things back then that no one really had ever seen before.  I mean it was such a great match that it was actually runner up for PWI's Match of the Year that year.  This is just a fun match.

The next match was a War Games match from Wrestle War 1992 and saw the Dangerous Alliance taking on Sting's Squadron.  I have to say that this War Games match may be the greatest of them it all.  It had everything from blood, to violence to ropes being taken down to people climbing on top of the cage and guys getting their heads shoved down in between the two rings.  This match was just awesome from start to finish.  As a side note this match does feature a young Steve Austin before his Stone Cold days and a young Dustin Rhodes before his Goldust days and it also featured the return of Nikita Koloff to his babyface days.

The next match was a unique contest as Vader battled Cactus Jack in a Spin the Wheel, Make the Deal match.  This was a non-title match and was unique because you had to spin a wheel to determine what type of match you would battle in.  Now, this match kind of failed at the previous Halloween Havoc as Sting spun the wheel against Jake Roberts and a Coal Miner's Glove was chosen.  What followed that year was one of the worst matches in Sting's career so it was surprising that they tried it again at Halloween Havoc in 1993.  Cactus would spin the wheel and he chose a Texas Death Match.  Basically in this match there are no rules.  You can pin an opponent but when you do the match is not over.  Once a pin occurs you have till a count of 10 to get back on your feet.  If you do, the match continues, if not it's over.  This was a fantastic contest and brutal.  Vader got busted open during the match and Cactus took a beating.  I remember there was one point when they battled down in this grave that had been set up and Vader got the winning end of it.  To see a bloody Vader walking out of the grave among the fog and lights was just great.  The match ended kind of dumb but it was still a great contest.

The next match was a US title match from Bash at the Beach 1994 between Steve Austin and Ricky Steamboat.  It should be noted that this match took place on my birthday and this was my favorite match on the card.  Austin has always said that Ricky was his favorite opponent and that this match may have been his favorite one with him.  I have seen most of their matches together and this is my favorite one they had.  It went for well over 20 minutes and was just a fantastic wrestling match.  I remember at one time my friends and I were talking and someone asked who I thought the next Ric Flair was going to be and I actually thought it would be Austin just because of how technical he was in the ring at this time.  This was just a fun match from start to finish.

The last match on disc 2 was from Halloween Havoc 1994 and it saw Hulk Hogan defend his world title against Ric Flair  The match was for the world title, in a cage, with Mr. T. as the special referee and both men's careers were on the line.  This match was pretty good but not near as good as their Bash at the Beach match they had a few months prior.  This match had too much going on.  For one thing, there was this side story as to who this masked man was that kept attacking Hogan in the months prior to this match.  For another thing, Mr. T. was just annoying during the match.  I mean there comes a point where T is knocked out and handcuffed to the ropes, then Sherri gets involved, then the masked man and Hogan still wins the freaking thing.  Now if I was booking this I would have had Hogan leave and Flair play it up like he was really retiring and give him a farewell but no, WCW just lets Flair leave so we can see that the masked man who has been attacking Hogan all these weeks was his friend Brutus Beefcake.  Big whoop!!  I think all of that just kind of took away from the match.

The first match from Disc 3 was the big hostile takeover match from Bash at the Beach 1996.  It saw Sting, Lex Luger and Randy Savage team up to take on the team of Hall and Nash, the Outsiders.  This was actually a great match with Luger down early to make it a two on two match.  I remember as a kid the whole time I was thinking who is the 3rd guy that the Outsiders had in their back pocket but that did not take away from the match.  It was a great contest with Hogan coming out at the end and showing that he was the 3rd man.  I have heard that had Hogan decided not to become a heel and do that turn then Sting would have been the 3rd man.  I think Hogan was the perfect choice and just think had Sting decided to do it, we may never have gotten to see the Crow Sting.

The next match was from Spring Stampeded 1997 and saw DDP take on Randy Savage in a no DQ match.  This was a great contest and to me this match really helped to solidify DDP as a main player in WCW as Savage actually took the fall for DDP.  I loved their feud this year and this match was a great way to get the feud off and running.  They fought everywhere including this little prop area that had set up to look like a picnic area.  It was just a great match.

The next match is one of my favorite matches of all time and features Eddie Guerrero defending his Cruiserweight title against the mask of Rey Mysterio at Halloween Havoc 1997.  This match has to be seen to be believed.  It is an unbelievable contest and features some of the wildest moves ever in a match.  It is a near flawless contest and came very close to winning the PWI match of the year award that year.  This match is my all time favorite Cruiserweight or Junior Heavyweight match that I have ever seen.  I have seen it more times than I can count but it never gets old to me.  To me, at this time in WCW, there were two things keeping the company afloat:  The NWO along with Sting and the Cruiserweights and after seeing this match you can tell these two were defiantly helpful into keeping the company afloat.

The next match was a contest from Slamboree 1998 between Randy Savage and Bret Hart with Roddy Piper as special referee.  I was looking forward to this one but it kind of disappointed.  They just didn't have the chemistry that I was hoping for.  Savage was starting to fade out at this time and Bret just wasn't what he was in the WWE.  The match wasn't a total stinker but it could have very easily been that.  Not a good match to put on here.

The next match was a good one as Chris Jericho defended his Cruiserweight title against Juventud Guerrera with Dean Malenko as the special referee.  This is a great contest that has the high flying, of course, but it also has a great story behind it.  See, a few months earlier, Jericho had actually taken Guerrea's mask and with it, Juvi's identity so he was out for revenge.  Jericho and Dean had no love lost for each other either so Dean was looking for revenge also.  The match was just great.  It had drama and action and no one gets under your skin more quickly than Jericho (that's why he is so freaking good).  To see him drop the belt here in a 16 minute classic was just fantastic.

The next match Goldberg defending his world title and streak against DDP at Halloween Havoc 1998.  This is, to me, perhaps Goldberg's best match of his career.  I remember some people didn't get to see this match because the PPV started to become an epic and ran over its allotted time so some cable providers shut it off before this main event match could be played.  For those who did get to see it, they got to see a pretty damn good 11 minute match.  I mean Goldberg was doing stuff in this match that people had never seen him do before and DDP was looking like he was going to walk out world champion at any moment.  This was just a stellar contest and I believe it actually won WCW's match of the year.  It was so ironic that this event featured their match of the year and also most people's worst match of the year as Warrior took on Hogan.  Thank God the WWE decided not to put that match on this set.

The next match is a world title match as Jeff Jarrett and Booker T. battle to see who will win the vacant world title at Bash at the Beach 2000.  Oh man, where to begin here.  The match was supposed to feature Jarrett defending his title against Hogan.  Hogan of course wanted the title and he had creative control to make that happen.  Vince Russo, who was booking, didn't want that to happen so he had Jarrett go out and lay down for Hogan.  Hogan pinned him and then him and Russo got into a verbal exchange the likes of which wrestling fans had never heard before.  It got a little too real.  So I guess they stripped Hogan of the belt and then a few matches later they had Jarrett and Booker go out and have a match to crown a new champion.  This was a very good contest and may have been one of Jarrett's best in the company.  Booker finally makes it to the big time and becomes world champion.  This was a great feel good moment for me.  I have always felt that Booker should go down as the greatest African American wrestler of all time (or so far) and one of the greatest of all time as well and I was so happy for him when he won the belt here.  This is a great match.

The next match is a ladder match from Starrcade 2000 and featured the Jung Dragons battling Shannon Moore and Shane Helms battling Jamie Knoble and Evan Karagias.  Honestly, I think this match is a little overrated.  I mean it's good but it's not that good.  People talk about it all time but it has nothing against some of the great ladder matches that you may have seen over the years.  I'm just not that big of a fan of the match, however, I will say that it was probably the best match from the Starrcade 2000 line up.

The last match on the set is from the last PPV in WCW existence.  It was an event called Greed and it was a Falls Count Anywhere match for the world title.  It saw Scott Steiner defend the title against DDP.  The match is just not that good.  Not even DDP could save it.  Steiner was just a terrible champion at this time and he just could not do a good job putting together a classic wrestling match.  DDP tried his hardest as he always does but he just could not save the match unfortunately.

The Blu Ray matches were not very good choices.  The first one is from Halloween Havoc 1989 and it was that Thunderdome cage match I mentioned earlier with Ric Flair and Sting teaming up to take on Great Muta and Terry Funk.  This was a killer match from start to finish.  Sting was kind of the MVP here.  He was doing things that just shouldn't be done in this type of cage match.  I want to say that the match ended when it appeared that Gary Hart threw in the towel for Muta and Funk, so that was kind of dumb but the rest of the match is just a fantastic contest.

The next BR match was Triple H, when he was wrestling as Jean-Paul Levesque took on Alex Wright in possibly his only WCW PPV match at Starrcade 1994.  The match was actually pretty good but not as good as you would think.

The next BR match was a match with basketball player Dennis Rodman taking on Randy Savage at Road Wild 1999.  Rodman had came onto the scene in 1997, I believe, and he turned out some truly good performances.  This match was different.  This match just wasn't all that good and honestly should never have been added to the disc set.  It was 11 minutes that was a waste of time.

The last BR match was a match between Hulk Hogan and Billy Kidman from Slamboree 2000.  It had Eric Bischoff as the guest referee.  I think at the time that this WCW's chance to do what WWE had done 3 years and start to pump some new blood into the organization.  However, I do not feel that Kidman was the way to go with Hogan.  I mean this Hogan for the love of God!  This was a guy who had battled some of the best on the some of the greatest cards of all time and you're gonna try to have Kidman of all people beat him.  It just wasn't a good move on their part and Hogan wasn't going to let it happen anyway so what was the point?  At this time, I don't know who they could have built up to beat someone like Hogan.  The match itself actually wasn't half bad with Kidman holding his own.  It was just kind of those all for naught type things though.

All in all this was a very good DVD set.  It does say that it is volume 1 so here's hoping that a volume 2 will be following sometime soon.  There are some great one's that could have been included in this set but maybe they will appear on the next one.  This is one that is worth checking out though.",1474675200,3,17982,4.095619811050673
