150722,3,0792838661,"This is my favorite Chuck Norris movie.  Terrorist's hijack a plane.  And the De;ta Force is called.  Chuck Norris was usually the star of his movies.  And he got top billing in this.  But probably because Lee Marvin let him.  It also has stars like Robert Vaughn, Martin Balsam, Shelly Winters whos has a great line about dying.  And George Kennedy and some has beens like Joey Bishop.  Any way this is a good action movie that will get your patriotic juices going.",1487116800,,466,4.530120481927711

150784,5,0792838661,"First, let me be honest: while I have immense respect for Chuck Norris as a person, I usually find his cinematic enterprises entirely unwatchable.  He simply does not engage me as an actor.

That being said, and given the fact that ""The Delta Force"" is Golan-Globus production (a group known more for their volume of productions than their quality), this is what modern American cinema should aspire to be.  There are none of the NAZI-sympathizing ""sensibilities"" of movies like ""Munich"", nor the politically-correct bulls*** that turned the villains of ""Sum of All Fears"" into Neo-NAZIs for it's cinematic adaptation.

For the budget that it had, it actually did a very good job of representing the groups involved.  The terrorists are NOT sympathetic characters; they are murderers motivated by hatred of everyone not Mohammedan.  The U.S. military is not full of spineless, drug-addicted cowards and psychotic mass-murderers.  Regular people can be cowards, but they can also stand up to the bad guys.

I don't know enough about Delta Force operations to say how accurate the final mission actually was, although I am sure it was at least a bit cinematized.  I do know that it does a good job of representing military strategy sessions and operational training.  Some of my favorite scenes actually happen in the beginning, with a German stewardess who refuses to pick out the Jews for the Mohammedan terrorists (until they threaten to kill everyone on board), and a Catholic priest (played by George Kennedy) who walks to the front of the plane with the Jews and tells the terrorists that if they are taking the Jews, they will have to take him, too.

A bit cheese, but highly recommended--especially for Hollywood producers.  There is more need for this sort of cinematic honesty today than there was in 1986, yet it is nowhere to be found.",1438473600,,1845,4.954545454545454

150834,3,0792838661,"(This is a review of the movie itself, not a physical product like DVD etc.)  I really wanted to like this film, but it shoots itself in the foot so many times that you just can't ignore it.  This movie really wants to appeal to the red meat eating Budweiser drinking freedom loving terrorist ass kicking American male, and to that end it does a decent job.  The hijacking scenes on the airplane, in fact, are quite real enough that I really didn't enjoy watching them (although I knew Chuck would put them in their places later).  But ... things like questioning a terrorist while sticking a gun barrel in his mouth ... I can't understand you with my gun barrel in your mouth  - where are the Americans again?  Or the Delta Force racing through the streets in the dead of night in their convoy of jeeps and motorcycles for the final assault ... I know we're making a lot of noise, but it's OK our lights have blue lenses so they won't know we're here.  Or the Delta Force frogmen with their bright yellow scuba tanks ... it's OK we'll just crouch down in the boat so only the tops of the tanks are caught in the searchlight they'll never see us.  Or the hostages knowing not to sleep on the part of the floor that the rescuers are going to blow  a hole in.  Or the ramp the terrorists must have placed at the gate to their compound so Chuck could ride his motorcycle right over the top of the fence.  Or the pallet of watermelons that they keep in the streets in Lebanon in case of chase scenes so that trucks could smash through them.  (I actually thought why are the watermelons there and the car didn't crash through them?  And then along came the second vehicle right through them.)  I could go on and on but ... maybe I just haven't had enough Budweisers, that's my problem.  Or maybe it's that real terrorists are a lot more real these days, and caricature good guys just won't cut it anymore.  But to be fair, it's not like this is the first Hollywood movie to take liberties with reality ... if it's reality you want, there's the evening news.  If it's terrorist ass kicking you want, then there's always Delta Force.",1409443200,,2126,4.355329949238579

150849,3,0792838661,I did like the action in the film. It got very realistic towards the beginning but towards the second half of the film it got little bit far fetched.  I can't picture 50 to 60 Delta force guys on the ground going to a foreign country and killing all these terrorists and only one Delta force being killed. It felt like a video game on easy mode.  Another example would be the movie commando and cobra. Both these movies consisted of one man or a small group of people killing all the bad guys with ease and only suffering minor injuries.  Overall it was an okay movie but I think they could've done a little bit of a better job as far as on how Delta force were hunting down it's terrorists.,1409270400,,691,4.21969696969697

They force the plane to fly to Beirut where the Jewish passengers are secretly taken off the plane and held in a remote area by the terrorist.  Meanwhile, additional terrorist sneak aboard the plane and force the plane to take off and fly to Algiers. In Algiers, the terrorist release the women and kids --- the Delta Force has started towards the plane when the flight attendant, just released, tells the team leader (Marvin) about the additional terrorist and Marvin has to abort the rescuer attempt by alerting the terrorist of their presence.  The terrorist then kill a U.S. Navy passenger and dump his body on the runway and force the plane back to Beirut where the rest of the passengers are taken to a secret location.  The plane is left sitting on the runway with the pilot and co-pilot and some terrorist on it.  Delta force must now free the hostages and retake the plane.

150877,2,0792838661,"""Delta Force"" is not quite unwatchable, but it is silly enough that it ought to be.
Silly special effects with guns like sparklers, Chuck Norris on a motorcycle with
guns mounted out it.

This movie came out when terrorism first raised its ugly head in the world.  Lots
of Middle Easterners hijacking airplanes and such.  This movie has that, and an
American Delta Force to save the say.  Sadly though, this movie is all fantasy.

I wish there had been American trumpets to celebrate, but that's another subject.

This movie is more campy and silly than it is interesting or realistic.  If you want
a great Lee Marvin movie watch ""Dirty Dozen"" at least that is done well.  This
movie is just sad ... and I think it was one of the first of the Golan Globus series
of action movies that led to the out of control nonsense we have today ... but at
least today the special effects are better ... but the actors are worse.

Nothing here to see really, check it out if you must, it's not terrible, I just don't
particularly like it ... especially considering I paid money to see this in the theater
when it come out.  Ugh.",1407369600,,1116,4.4

One of Chuck norris's best films during the 80'S
and one of my Favourite chuck norris films aswell
Incredible Acting performances by Lee Marvin, Chuck norris, George Kennedy who plays the Priest
Susan strasberg who plays German Flight attendant and Robert Forster who plays the Lead Terrorist on the plane
This Blu-ray release is exactly the same as the 2003 DVD version
absolutely no extras whatsoever
MGM made no effort to get a new interview with Chuck norris, or a interview with Menahem Golan the Director of the film
this film definitely deserves new extras
But tragically MGM did not bother making the effort
so it's a barebones blu-ray release again except there's Theatrical trailer with the film

Arrow films U.K. have released this film on blu-ray aswell
with all new extras, pathetic extras i think

go to Arrow films website and check the extras yourself
much better extras would be interview with Chuck norris or Robert forster or even Menahem Golan Director
for some reason Arrow films couldn't get an interview with chuck norris

but there's one thing that's very positive with this U.S. blu-ray release
the Picture and audio quality
the picture quality has definitely been enhanced, much more clearer picture than the DVD version
the Widescreen Aspect ratio is the same as the DVD version
and a new Master Audio mix in Stereo sound quality, no 5.1 surround sound

so it's definitely time for an Upgrade if you want to buy this film
with the extras it makes no difference at all, both versions have no extras anyway
but for a clearer picture quality and a new Master audio mix get the blu-ray release, not the DVD release
I Gave this blu-ray 4 stars if that, based on a clearer picture quality and a new Master audio mix
if the picture quality was the same as the dvd version i would've given it 2-3stars
but it is not.
so get the U.S.blu-ray release for an upgrade,
or get the Arrow films U.K. blu-ray release, entirely up to you.",1407110400,,2207,4.7421875
150883,3,0792838661,It was okay.  Pretty slow for an action movie and some of the acting was bad.  But you've gotta love Chuck!,1407024000,,107,4.0476190476190474
150884,4,0792838661,"I have to talk about Delta Force in two ways, as a movie and as agitprop, because I have very different reactions to it.

As a movie it's a superb example of its genre.  Lots of action, brisk pacing with appropriate breaks, taut editing that makes it easy to keep track of what's happening, a multi-star cast, a coherent plot.  I was totally caught up in the dramatic experience.

At the same time, I had an increasingly queasy feeling about the world view that it portrayed.  It was a war movie, so there had to be an enemy, in this case Arabic-speaking terrorists.  But they were not just the enemy, they were subhuman wild-eyed unkempt savages who deserved to be tortured and killed (except for their well-groomed leader, played by Robert Forster, who was about as convincing as an Arabic terrorist chief as Charlton Heston was as a Mexican policeman in Touch of Evil).  They were brutally killed by the dozens to everyone's great satisfaction, while the two American deaths that happened during the action were treated as grievous tragedies.  The whole thing reminded me of the embarrassing movies of the WWII era that portrayed the Japanese in much the same grotesque way.  I'd like to think that we as a nation have progressed more than that in our understanding of the world outside our borders.  Certainly we have to do everything we can to prevent terrorist acts, but dehumanizing entire nations of people does not help us in that effort.",1407024000,,1447,4.729083665338646

151006,3,0792838661,"The Delta Force, 1986 film

Terrorists from the Middle East capture an international flight and land in Beyrouth. There is the usual dramatic conflict and display of personalities. After landing the terrorists take their prisoners to a building. There is shooting and a car chase for action. The American Delta Force is sent there to rescue the captives and neutralized the villains. We know how it will end (a victory for the good guys), the entertainment comes from watching the proceedings.

[Isnt if foolish to wear white belts with dark uniforms? Unless you want to make a target in dim light.] How will the captives be rescued? Watch the details. One minute to show time. Then the shooting begins, enough for a small war. [Note the use of Uzi submachine guns by the Americans.] The hostages must be moved before enemy reinforcements arrive. Where are the Americans? Transported to Iran at night? Can one man on a motorcycle stop a caravan of cars and trucks? Yes [in a movie].

Will the terrorist leader get away? Not with Chuck Norris after him. Going somewhere? He is defeated after a dramatic fight. Guess what happens next? There are cotton fields in Lebanon. Can that airliner be flown to Israel? The hostages go aboard fast; so too the Delta Force. Hope youll have a nice day. The Colonel is last aboard. [That has to be a stunt double.] And so they fly away. [Product placement for a beer.] But there are casualties. The passengers sing a patriotic song from sea to shining sea.

The airliner lands in Ben Gurion airport to be reunited with the female passengers. One man is carried. Families celebrate. Delta Force personnel then fly back to their home. The credits roll, it tells who produced this movie. There were many more behind the camera than in front.

For one thing, look at how this movie predicted the state of 21st century American foreign policy.  Yes, I'm being a little sarcastic, but I didn't envision the War on Terror when I was a wee lad growing up during in the Reagan administration.

151015,3,0792838661,"Chuck made a zillion throwaway B-movies for the notorious Cannon Films Group, the most popular of which is certainly 1986's The Delta Force, directed by Menahem Golan himself. The Golan/Globus team were infamous for demonizing Arabs, victimizing Jews, and turning American's into pure-hearted, clean-cut heroes. Delta Force amps this ridiculousness up to a million and really ought to be disregarded as any form of entertainment, but it still manages to be exciting and involving despite its many, many flaws.

Chuck is Captain/Major Scott McCoy, a Special Forces veteran disillusioned by the failure of Operation Eagle Claw in 1980. Some time later a couple of Islamic terrorists take over a flight from Athens to New York and make various insane demands. Chuck is brought back into action by boss Lee Marvin (in his last movie) and flown to Algiers with the Delta Force and their eccentric equipment and gadgets (such as rocket-launching motorcycles, which I am sure that they don't have in real life).

At 130 minutes the film just about manages to sustain its running time despite not having any significant plot developments or any twists of any kind. There's no tension of any sort either (if that is what you are looking for I suggest Executive Decision instead) but there is a fair amount of excitement in the action, however clumsily-staged by Golan. Alan Silvestri's popular score is perhaps a little too upbeat for the subject matter, but it helps keep the film moving.

By the end of the film, the tone is so aggravatingly patriotic, with the characters singing 'America the Beautiful' and fawning over the Delta Force (thankfully they restrain themselves enough to not chant 'USA! USA! USA!'), but there is an interesting counterpoint in this scene as the force go home tired and heartbroken at the loss of one of their crew. With this edge the film just about clings to respectability and give it some element of integrity, however small.

I much prefer the sequel, and there are better air-terror films out there, but it's worth watching even if it is a little dated by modern standards.

The Blu-ray features a very good 1.78:1 1080p transfer (which is odd as MGM usually keep flat-shot film in 1.85:1 but they've opened-up Delta Force a little bit) with a DTS HD-MA 2.0 soundtrack, which is good despite its limitations. The only extra is a trailer.",1360454400,,2366,4.934673366834171

151023,3,0792838661,"The Delta Force has always been my favorite Chuck Norris movie, and MGM's awful 4x3 pan & scan (only) DVD has always been one of my pet peeves. So whenever I wanted to watch this movie, I've played back my 1080i MPEG-2 widescreen HD recording from the HDnetMovies channel on my DVR.

First the good news: the picture. The 1080p 16x9 AVC video on this Blu-ray is quite a bit better than the DVD. However, it does have ups and downs. It seems there were two different camera crews during the filming (I'm just guessing here) and the results show here. When Chuck and the Deltas are on screen, the picture is wonderfully sharp, with a slight layer of film grain to show there was no sloppy DNR applied. When we're watching the terrorists and hostages, things deteriorate a bit. Bright colors can get oversaturated. Robert Forster's red shirt is especially offensive here.

The HDnetMovies broadcast has much less detail in the picture, but the bright colors behave themselves better than they do on the new Blu-ray Disc.

Overall picture ratings.... DVD: 1. HDnetMovies broadcast: 3. Blu-ray Disc: 3.5.

Now the bad news: the sound. The HDnet Movies broadcast has some pretty decent 5.1 channel Dolby Digital surround sound. So why the h*ll does the Blu-ray have only plain old 2-channel stereo? Offically it's DTS-MA 2.0, but it's pretty crappy and tinny DTS-MA 2.0. Where the h*ll is the low end? Pardon the pun, but the bass is missing in action, even when run through my Pioneer Elite receiver's Pro Logic decoder. Chuck needs to deliver a roundhouse kick in the *sses to the lazy bums responsible for the sound on this disc.

Overall sound ratings... DVD: 2. HDnetMovies broadcast: 4. Blu-ray Disc: 2.

Hmmm, if you add my ratings up for each format, it looks like I won't be reclaiming the space on my DVR any time soon. Now if only I could take the picture from the BD and combine it with the sound from the HDnetMovies broadcast, then we'd have a release of this film worth celebrating!",1339027200,,1991,4.674285714285714
151024,3,0792838661,I have Delta Force from amazon.uk as it has been released in a widescreen version. But the movie is a great action flick in either version. This is loosely based on an actual hijacking however we never got the Delta Force involved in it.,1337040000,,237,4.409090909090909

151026,5,0792838661,"I couldn't tell you how many times I've watched this movie growing up. At least a few dozens, which is probably an underestimation. I've always watched this movie on TV, never buying the DVD until much later in life (actually about a year ago when I finally picked up the film).

This is one of those films that always get my mom. The start of the movie is rather chilling. Radical Islamic terrorists board and hijack an airplane. It's rather hard to watch as the hijackers beat Navy personnel to a bloody mess as well as requesting that all Jewish people come forward on the plane. For the first hour we witness a brutal hijacking that makes a lot of people, especially my mom who gets caught off guard, surprised. It makes for a very good start to a rather long movie.

Then enter Chuck Norris who decides not to go on the mission to save the hostages but suddenly changes his mind at the last minute while Lee Marvin waits on a door of a just closing C130. This is the part where my mom starts screaming, ""Not this guy!"" It's a running joke and always made me laugh really hard. That's when we change the channel but sometimes she watches it.

I want to say that the beginning and ending of this movie are very powerful. The parts where Chuck Norris and Lee Marvin go on a rampage is not so good because it involves Chuck Norris riding on a motorcycle blasting away at everyone. The beginning, as I said, shows a very powerful, brutal, if not surreal hijacking, and the ending shows a very sad, very humble group of badly injured special forces patching up their wounded while keeping out of sight of the very happy reunion of the people they just saved. There's no welcoming party, no thank you, just unsung heroes who were successful in their mission to save people. It was quite a nice ending and one that always make me want to shed a tear thinking about what greatness some people do in real life.

I believe at the time of the movie, nobody really fully understood Special Forces. At the start of the movie, we see that Chuck Norris character participated in the failed Tehran mission which in 1980 was a real eye opener for the world of Special Forces. Then again in 1980, I believe the British SAS with their successful Embassy takeover finally brought the Special Forces community into the world wide theater and in good light. So Delta Forces is what I think is the ""baby"" of the culture of various Special Forces based movies. It wasn't accurate nor was it horribly bad. It was nicely thought out and they don't draw into the ""special forces"" thing that many movies do.

Is this movie good? Yes. Should people watch it? Yes. I think overall this DVD package is very nice. The movie is rather long but well worth the full two hours. I would say that among the movie would, Delta Force is Chuck Norris best films. Besides Lone Wolf McQuade, this is certainly a pleasure to watch and one of Norris best acting besides Walker Texas Ranger.",1318377600,,2949,4.463821892393321

151045,3,0792838661,"Few countries in the world have not suffered from terrorist violence over the past three decades... Domestic and international terrorism is now at the top of the agenda for most nations...

Experts agree that there is almost always a strategy behind terrorist actions... Whether it takes the form of bombings, shootings, hijackings, or assassinations... Terrorism is neither random, spontaneous, nor blind; it is a deliberate use of violence against civilians for political or religious ends...

Terrorist acts are often deliberately spectacular, designed to rattle and influence a wide audience, beyond the victims of the violence itself... The point is as Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld said at the Pentagon one day: ""Terrorism must be vigorously opposed and soundly defeated wherever it exists.""

The Delta Force was secretly created in October 1977 by US Army colonel Charles Beckwith in direct response to numerous, well-publicized terrorist incidents that occurred in the 1970s.

The number of terrorism attacks was at its highest in mid-1980s... Palestinians have long been associated with terrorism, including suicide bombings against Western targets and kidnappings in war-torn Lebanon during the 1980s...

Menahem Golan's 'The Delta Force' is inspired by the 1985 hijacking of TWA, which featured the famous footage of the plane's pilot leaning out of the cockpit with a gun to his head... The film opens with two fanatic terrorists taking over an American airliner bound from Athens to Rome and New York, diverting it to Beirut...

With no other option, the Pentagon decides to send the 'Delta Force' into the area for an emergency rescue operation...

Colonel Alexander (Marvin) is given the go ahead, and his elite team - specialized in rapid infantry assault, night fighting and airfield seizure - led by Major McCoy (Norris) energetically meets the terrorists...

Chuck Norris unarmed is deadly enough, but give him a sub-machine gun, bazooka, or motorcycle tricked out with machine guns, rocket launchers, and mortars, and he is the most deadly creature to ever walk the Earth, and the terrorists in this movie learn that fact the hard way. I recommend this movie to anyone who understands how truly awesome a Chuck Norris movie can be. Also, check out Octagon.

These two events fuel the Delta Force about a passenger aircraft on its way to New York that is hi-jacked by Arab terrorists and diverted to Beirut.  The cast looks like one of those big-budget, 1970's era disater films with Joey Bishop, Shelly Winters, Martin Balsam, Lanie Kazan, and George Kennedy all playing passengers on the flight.  The terrorists are led by Robert Forster as Abdul.

With the hi-jacking, the Army puts the Delta Force to work to plan a rescue operation.  Overseeing the command is Lee Marvin as Col. Alexander playing the grizzled veteran office not so different than the part he played in The Dirty Dozen.  Chuck Norris Major Scott McCoy who is the leader of the team, called back into active action for the mission.  The planned rescue mission is aborted when they soon learn that more terrorists boarded the plane when it stopped to re-fuel in Algeria.  The terrorists are demanding Isreal release dozens of terrorists from prison or they will kill the hostages.  They demonstrate their intentions by viciously beating and killing a young American naval diver as well as holding all the Jewish passengers separate from the rest.  The women are eventually released but the men are taken to a prison once they land in Beirut and it's up to the Delta Force to rescue the hostages.

The stereotypes run hot and heavy in Delta Force on both the Arab and Jewish side.  And not only that, but there's a German flight attendant who just CAN'T be the one to pick out the Jewish passengers due to her (evidently) instinctive guilt over the concentration camps and holocaust of WWII, and she courageously tries to help the American divers by telling them to hide their Naval ID cards.  There's a lot of posturing speeches by both the terrorists and the hostages including George Kennedy who plays a Catholic priest and insists on being put with the Jewish men since Jesus was ""King of the Jews"".  it's all pretty hokey but also great fun.  Politcally correct?  Maybe not but who gives a damn!  It's really not unlike many WWII era war movies.  The Delta Force is black and white and you know who the good guys are and who the bad guys are.  Politics is not even worth mentioning.

Chuck Norris will never be considered a great actor but he also never tried to do too much.  He played the strong, fairly silent type of hero perfectly, and with a strong sense of patriotism.  The action scenes were very well done and you couldn't help but cheer when the hostages were rescued and the bad guys got theirs in the end.

151052,4,0792838661,"This 1986 movie by action film producers Golan-Globus is a fictionalization (exploitation?) of an extremely brutal Middle Eastern hijacking of the period.

Chuck Norris and Lee Marvin of the Clenched Jaw School of Acting play the Delta Force commanders whose special team is dispatched to rescue the hostages. The flag-waving and jingo rhetoric rheostat is turned up to full in this picture which is unabashedly pro-American, pro-Israel, and pro-testosterone.

The acting is comic-book style and over the top, despite the fine, experienced cast. Joey Bishop, Lainie Kazan, Martin Balsam, Shelley Winters, and Susan Strasberg play the primary passenger roles (all Jewish), while German actress Hanna Schygulla does a turn as the Chief Flight Attendant who is forced to work with the terrorists who represent the ""New World Revolutionary Organization."" George Kennedy plays a Roman Catholic Priest with a social conscience who identifies himself with the Jews on board, ""Just like Jesus Christ."" Bo Svenson plays the Delta Commando whose bachelor party is cut short just in time for him to go off and be killed in action. Such are the plot dynamics of THE DELTA FORCE.

This film subsists completely on stock characters. Certain earlier reviewers decry the fact that the portrayals might give viewers the politically incorrect idea that all Arabs are horrible. I disagree. I think this film's point is that all TERRORISTS are horrible (the Algerians and some of the Lebanese are portrayed neutrally). This is an action-adventure movie, not Sociology 101.

Even granting the PC point, this film portrays it's American Jews as Lower-East Side, Holocaust-obsessed yentas. At least the Cannon Group gave them equal time.

The terrorists are all just as stereotypical: heartless brutes when in control and screaming, ""We want to negotiate!"" as they are being killed off. They threaten endlessly that their ""friends in America"" will strike a blow ""one day...one day."" Perhaps this movie is more realistic than it is given credit for, after all.

It's a fun movie, and the action scenes, once begun, never stop coming. Never meant to be taken seriously, THE DELTA FORCE is an action-adventure epic, not THE HOUSE OF SAND AND FOG. So relax.

A big commercial success, THE DELTA FORCE spawned a whole line of sequels, but this one is the non plus ultra of its genre.

It was a simple good guys versus the stereotyped bad guys movie with a bland ho hum plot. However, in the light of recent terroristic activities worldwide, this film now has a tinge of truth in it. Bad guys do exist and they do commit terroristic acts and they MUST be eliminated. Thst is the reality portrayed here. The fantasy is that there is a Delta Forcee that can  obliterate these bad guys. Well, they haven't done it yet. Lee Marvin provides his usual inebriated acting in this one. However, Chuck Norris is statuestic. His acting is pretty much mundane here. The inclusion of so many prominent stars does not make this a classic. But this may eventually end up being a cult film if the situation where terrorists are not destroyed in the real world persists. At least in this movie, they get their lickings.",1083024000,4,933,4.620481927710843

Studio head Menahem Golan stepped behind the camera to direct and the result is a bit of a bloated movie.  The action is well over an hour in coming and the first half is pretty over the top in its melodramatic manipulation.  Nonetheless, it will entertain fans of the Cannon studio movies (they do exist) and Chuck Norris.  Nothing classic, and it lacks the punch of realism (the delta force drives dune buggies into combat?) to help make anything other than an average exploitation melodrama.",1081641600,2,669,4.791304347826087

151057,5,0792838661,"Wow.  I recently watched this one on cable recently, and must applaud the elements that make it a tremendous bad movie.  One is the direction and production itself from that powerhouse duo--Golan/Globus.  These guys have an amazing resume of 80s action films--they banged out about a dozen flicks a year during their prime.  You'll be hard pressed to find filmmakers who more consistently made crowd pleasers by preying on paranoia (be it Russians invading, Arabs, 'Nam, street gangs taking over, or some other injustice), glorifying violence, giving us the revenge we crave, all the while casting credibility, writing, and acting to wind in favor of R-rated A-Team-esque violence.
If they ever make a War on Terror box set, The Delta Force would be a prime offering. This is a very curious cultural artifact from that genre of 80s action films that has disappeared.  I'm betting the current administration owns a copy of this.
Where to begin?  The story is about terrorism and the crack anti-terrorist group, Delta Force.  Palestinian terrorists (note that Golan and Globus are Israeli) hijack a plane (taking advantage of that old standard in lax airport safety--Athens, Greece) and re-route it to favorite 80s locale Beirut.  It's up to the Delta Force to stop them.
The cast?  Brilliant.  How many times will you find a movie with Lee Marvin, Chuck Norris (alumnus of numerous Golan/Globus outings), Joey Bishop(!), Steve James, and a variety of faceless actors playing sweaty and fanatical Arab terrorists who like to swear on Allah when being questioned?  Also note Martin Balsam, who, a year previously, appeared in Golan/Globus' greatest contribution to mankind: Death Wish 3.
The early portions of the hijacking all recall the famous TWA hijacking of the previous year, and they play out decently in an attempt to echo reality, all so reality can be ripped up and thrown away later on.
What's really jaw-dropping is the ending.  I first saw this film as a child, and then it seemed like the solid 80s action fair I expected, with heinous bad guys, bad-ass good guys, plenty of violence, and the bad guys getting theirs, but good.  Upon recent viewing, whole new angles opened up.  The final assault on the terrorists and the plane is stupefying.  Norris drives a motorcycle straight from GI Joe, complete with nifty, sharp rockets in the front (that mysteriously reappear after being fired), tiny but eerily accurate machine guns, and some kind of rear-end firing grenade launchers that symbolize a metaphorical flatulence as Norris destroys the baddies with his back turned.  Nice.  The faintly pleasant and incredibly cheesy, heroic music pipes in at the end as low paid extras who refused to cut their hair for the film play Delta Force commandos who favor black knit ski caps in the heat of Beirut and issue orders like ""C'mon, let's go!""
The oeuvre of Golan/Globus is begging for a critical re-examination, and arguably a boxed set.  Hunker down with gems like this, Invasion U.S.A, Death 3(and 2 and 4) and Cobra, and watch in awe.  The marriage of profit and cheap gratification is perhaps unmatched in the history of cinema.",1076630400,,3141,4.982758620689655
151058,4,0792838661,"It's been nearly eighteen years since THE DELTA FORCE was first unleashed, back in early 1986.  Time has actually been good to this shoot-'em-up which, while it often seems like another standard issue good guys/bad guys action flick set against the fictional recreation of an actual 1985 TWA hijacking, actually manages to be quite tense and suspenseful much of the time.
Chuck Norris and Lee Marvin head up the elite Delta Force (which is an actual counterterrorist unit, though it has never been used in reality) as it is put into action following the hijacking of an American Travelways flight out of Athens, Greece.  Onboard this plane, the hijackers, led by Robert Forster (a chilling performance from him here), demand the release of Palestinean political prisoners or they will blow the plane up.  To ram home their point, they separate all the Jews onboard from the rest of the passengers and, when the Delta Force fails to nab them in Algiers, kill a U.S. marine (as actually happened in the '85 skyjacking).
But Norris and Marvin are not far behind.  Although the film does become something of a conventional shoot-'em-up in its final forty minutes, THE DELTA FORCE turns out to be far better than most films of its ilk.
Complete with an all-star cast that includes Joey Bishop, Martin Balsam, George Kennedy, Susan Strasberg, and Shelley Winters, one is reminded to some extent of the all-star disaster films that were so successful during the 70s.  But instead of being an encumbrance, this kind of casting actually keeps THE DELTA FORCE from degenerating completely into a comic-book bloodbath.  Bo Svenson also gives a good performance as the ATW pilot.  And Norris proved himself here to be a far better actor in such films than Schwarzenneger, Stallone, or Seagal could ever have dreamed of being.
But what really keeps the film on track is the presence of Marvin, THE veteran tough guy in Hollywood, who was making his last big-screen appearance here.  His gaunt weariness and tough professionalism displayed here, as they were in films like THE DIRTY DOZEN, POINT BLANK, and BAD DAY AT BLACK ROCK, are what made him a Hollywood legend in every sense of the word.
It's these things that make THE DELTA FORCE eminently watchable, even in this post-9/11 world.  It's not always believable, but I've seen far worse.",1075420800,6,2329,4.905852417302799

Yes, those saints at Cannon give us one of the most butt kickin', finger lickin', chicken pickin' action flickins of the 80s.  The first half of the film is actually quite well done and suspenseful as we watch the events unfold on the hijacked airplane.  After the plane lands and the Delta Force makes it's move, we're thrown headfirst into CannonLand, where the blood and carnage flow like wine.  Chuck Norris is his invincible self, taking out whoever gets in his path with guns, fists and a motorcycle equipped with a built in machine gun(a Cannon favorite coz this ridiculous contraption pops up in other Cannon films).

151062,5,0792838661,"I had seen this movie a number of years ago and it did not make the impact on me as it did after 9/11.  This is probably Chuck Norris' greatest movie with plenty of action and thought provoking at that. Veteran actor and World War II veteran Lee Marvin is marvelous in this movie.  The story starts out with the failed rescue attempt of the American hostages in Teheran, Iran by the newly formed Delta Forces in the Iranian desert (you can read about the actual story behind the rescue attempt with an www. Amazon.com ordered book called ""The Guts to Try"" by a Colonel Kyle).  Lee Marvin plays the Delta Force commander who in actuality was a Colonel Charles Beckwith, Vietnam special forces veteran and founder of Delta Force (you can read about him in his book ""Delta Force"" that you can order through www. Amazon.com about his forming the Delta Force).  The movie transports you to a few years later with a hijacking of an airliner by terrorists taking place and the Delta Force's mission to rescue them.  There are other good actors in the movie with parts by George Kennedy, Joey Bishop, Martin Balsam and Shelley Winters.  The actors playing the villains also were excellent.  The directing and music was also good. The Hijacking with the killed hijacked American occurred in the mid eighties.  The Navy diver who was killed actually received a Bronze Star medal for bravery.  The German stewardess actually responded the way she did.  The Delta Force actually performed missions in Lebanon some of which still remain classified today.  All Americans should watch this movie to see the potential of one of their greatest fighting forces of antiterrorism especially after 9/11. They are now fighting in Afghanistan!

151067,5,0792838661,"This is likely the best Chuck Norris movie ever to hit the big screen.  Granted, given the dozens of horrendous films to his credit, that might not be saying a WHOLE lot.  Nevertheless, if you're in the mood for an action movie that details Special Forces, this is one of the better flicks out there that's of that genre.
The film opens with the (historical) botched attempt to rescue the Iranian hostages under the latter days of the Carter administration.  Norris plays a member of team that suffered casualties when things went awry.  Fed up with the politicians running the show, Norris decides to retire from the Army.
Enter the Delta Force, which is the Army's Top-Secret anti-terrorist unit.  After the Iran fiasco, they're chomping at the bit to prove their worth in a new scenario.  Predictably, Norris' character decides to return to the fray.
Ever since 9/11, this movie has been particularly cathartic to view.  Watching cowardly terrorist forces get hunted by elite commandos is nothing short of soothing.  It's a testament to the fact that, while we're normally a pretty laid back country, it is unwise to provoke us into anger.  The Delta Force, Navy Seals, Marine Recon and Army Rangers are waiting for anyone who makes this lethal mistake.",1034640000,9,1256,4.886792452830188
151068,2,0792838661,"The plot of the movie has alot of promise, middle eastern terrorists hijack a plane and take hostages, Chuck Norris comes to the rescue guns a-blazing . Unfortunately, the DVD version I rented didn't subscript the Arabic speaking terrorists in English, so much of the movie, you just watched the terrorists yell without much of a clue as to what they said. There was alot of this dialog so there is much to miss.
The terrorists that did manage to speak english had some lines that appears like Hollywood PC croud trying to keep peace with a particular ethnic group. For instance this one terrorist finds a ring that clearly belongs to a Jew, and later returns it to the Lady whom tried to hide it, making him look like he had compassion towards her. The same terrorist looked at another lady and said something to the effect ""Your a brave women, your free to go"". While saying this, he looked like he admired her. Maybe it's just me, but this doesn't appear to be close to the way middle eastern terrorists really are (especially not towards a woman).
Chuck Norris seems a bit flat in this, especially if you compare against Stallone or Schwarzenegger movies. I would have probably rated it at 5 stars when it was made, but the story just doesn't fly for me post Sept. 11th.

Instead of the real-life hijacking by Lebanese Shiite Muslim terrorists, the film uses Palestinians as the militants.  The movie is very patriotic at times, which it should have been.  It is also a little Hollywoody, but that's okay also, based on the theme of the film.  Because, art imitates life so many times, especially after what has been happening here, and around the world, the movie is a great boost in confidence, and shows also how America's elite international counter-terrorism force comes to the rescue of the hostages.

The Delta Force is just the real-life TWA 847 hijacking with a counter-terrorist assault appended onto it. The movie makes no bones about that.
It can be a fun movie but is plagued with such unbelievable plot elements. For instance, the Delta assault force land in Beirut on an Israeli landing craft (I guess the Sixth Fleet was too busy). They have all these Fast Attack Vehicles and super-duper attack motorcycles. Yet, their assault plan apparently relies on abandoning these vehicles and hitching a ride on the hijacked 707.
