8115620,3,B000EXZFVW,"""La ciudad al desnudo"" (""The Naked City"" from 1988) was directed by Gabriel Retes: the majority of his films are portrayals of the social-conditions of Mexico's lower-class and is in many ways a  reflection of the very violent and brutal nature of the society being depicted (often with political connotations too). A lot of his films can easily be classified as Cult/Exploitation even though they aspire to be taken as socio-political melodrama.

There are two stories in this film. The first is of a struggling young couple with a baby girl: 'Aurelia' (Lourdes Elizarrar&aacute;s) and 'Alfonso' (Martin Barraza). The second is of a group of criminal thugs who go around robbing, conning, and just plain terrorizing people with impunity wherever they go (*the majority of their victims are women that they harass along the streets; with catcalls and obscene gestures). Their worlds will soon collide with shocking and irreversible consequences for all parties concerned!

The film itself is far from being considered a ""work of art"". However, what Gabriel Retes has accomplished with some of his films (i.e.---""Bandera rota"" 1979, ""Mujeres salvajes"" 1984), is to show the rampant corruption and complete disregard for the ""sanctity of life"" that the majority of Mexico's citizens seem to have (from high and low alike). This of course, is sadly even worse than ever and, is an ever-present reality of Mexico and Latin America in general. Even sex/sexuality is depicted by Retes in many of his films (any keen observer will catch it too), as conditional/appropriated  by the State/society as an extension of the wider exploitation they cannot seem to escape (*the majority of its victims are always women). In this regard, Gabriel Retes is very much like Spain's own Eloy de la Iglesia, who pretty much explored the same themes in his own films. This film is definitely not for everyone but, we have to credit the filmmaker for having the courage to show what life is like for many people in Mexico (and the world for that matter).

The DVD picture and sound quality is very good, however the audio has a little distortion/hissing in some parts (and this Vanguard Cinema DVD release from 2006 lists the running-time as 105 mins. but I only clocked 90. It also lists English subtitles which it doesn't offer). NTSC, Spanish (no English subtitles), FFN (Lourdes Elizarrar&aacute;s),  NR 90 mins. (BTW: this film depicts scenes of rape/graphic violence against women and men; recommended for mature audiences only.)

*** This review may contain spoilers ***

Ciudad al desnudo, La (1989) is a fairly typical entry for Mexican low budget fare. It has some nice color shots in dark alleys but the story is so standardized, that it never has any powerful moments. There are two stories to make up the bulk of the running time. One of them deals with a husband and wife with a child who are living on the fringe of poverty. They have a fight and he throws a bottle of coins out the window which makes a car crash, they go on the lam to escape the law. Next story concerns a group of thugs who do nothing but cause trouble everywhere they go, from fighting to harassing people. Eventually they meet up with the fore mentioned husband and wife in a brutal rape scene that is very graphic. In all, it's just average and not really worth watching if you are expecting a great film, and there are no subtitles either. There is a lot of street slang so if you are an intro Spanish student it might be hard as well.

Still, if you want to know a little about Mexican cinema, pick it up, it won't destroy you.  I even recommend it.
