7199537,3,B00XUQAFVK,The overall history and story related to this singer was really glossed over which gave the movie an entertainment only type of feeling with little imparting of telling a true store which was relateable and could provide teachable moments.

7199538,4,B00XUQAFVK,"I'm guessing HBO and Queen Latifah will have their hands around a slew of Emmys this year for this excellent biopic about legendary blues singer Bessie Smith.  The film traces Bessie from the time of her mother's death in 1903 until just before her own in 1937.

With her father long gone, Bessie and her brother were ""raised"" by Viola, an older sister played by Khandi Alexander as an adult.  Viola was hardly old enough to take care of herself and resorted to beatings, threats and kept food under lock and key.  Shortly after Clarence (Tory Kittles) strikes out on his own as a musician, Bessie follows.  As struggling musicians they take whatever jobs they can including busking on Chattanooga street corners.

During a visit by prominent blues singer of the time, Ma Rainey (Mo'Nique, excellent again), Bessie works up the courage to ask her for a job after boarding her private train.  They work together for a while as Bessie learns the ropes from the veteran singer.  These are some of the best scenes in the film in addition to those toward the end when Ma and Bessie reunite after many years going their own way.  Mo'Nique and Latifah work well off each other.

Bessie is a take charge woman who knows what she wants.  Unfortunately her drinking habit and bisexual hungers constantly get in the way.  She eventually marries Jack Gee (Michael Kenneth Williams) who wants to take charge of her career which of course, Bessie is reluctant to relinquish.  Smith's biography suggests that director Dee Rees and the writers, including Oscar winner Horton Foote, got their facts accurate.  Bessie reunites with her hated sister, Viola, both refusing to acknowledge their shortcomings.  Again, Ms. Alexander is very strong in her portrayal.

The film is an acting masterpiece, with Queen Latifah, never better.  The sets are terrific and the music is wonderfully recreated.  Unfortunately, reproductions of Bessie Smith's actual recordings are technically insufficient to show off her famed instrument.  Recommended.",1437782400,25,2018,5.042296072507553

After reading the producer reviews, it was said that Bessie's ending was left out on purpose. It felt like a cliff hanger at the end.

7199542,5,B00XUQAFVK,"WHAT HAPPENS 2 A DREAM DEFERRED? The idea that Queen Latifah could play Bessie Smith was pitched b4 1996s Set It Off. I wonder if Latifahs blues album or the success of Hayeks Frida made this biopic possible. It really shows Latifahs range & I will buy it 1nce its on DVD. I think us dark-skinned folk will love it cuz she did the opposite of the paper bag test. I think bisexuals will love it cuz it shows her male & female lovers cool with each other, rather than fighting 2 the death. [Dear str8 men & lesbians, u will find her GF n the flick hot, hot, hot!] Still, biracial viewers might dislike that she calls a woman half-breed. The film shows Bessie smacking Carl van Vechten 4 titling a book Nwuhrd Heaven. However, there r essays that say Blacks n the early 1900s LOVED van Vechten. He photographed & praised Black artists when other whites refused 2. I read an essay that said several Black men named their 1st-born sons after him. (His interracial, homoerotic photos later influenced Mapplethorpe & his problematic Little Black Book.) I wonder what folk who saw Lady Sings the Blues will think of it. I also think folk will want 2 find their copy of the Josephine Baker biopic & watch the 2 back 2 back. U C Latifahs boobs (surgically reduced, remember?) here, but I was saddened that after seeing Mike Eppss delicious chest, the film flirts w/ then avoids showing his chocolate-y buns! It also avoids presenting her tragic car or train death.",1436572800,6,1454,4.532319391634981

I know Queen Latifa was happy she got to be bi-sexual but got her lesbian action on consistently. Less singing less understanding the purpose of the locked fridge and Les, less less..But a whole lot of gay action. I couldn't enjoy it not because I am not gay it's because I really didn't get the whole point of it. Is Bessie about her being gay or was it about how she was a singer and her growing up?

7199569,5,B00XUQAFVK,"While Bessie Smith isn't my favorite blues singer, her rough and passionate spirit is something I've come to admire. In this film, this spirit is on full display as Bessie drinks for pleasure and pain, has male AND female lovers,and fights anyone who disrespects her or those she cares for. A favorite scene is when Bessie stands up to the Ku Klux Klan after they threaten to burn down her tent during one of her shows! Underneath that rough n' tumble spirit is the desire to sing the blues and she learns to sing it for other black people and for herself. Queen Latifah does a fantastic job playing the role and singing it too. No one can sing like Bessie Smith, but Queen Latifah does have a great voice and comes pretty close to Smith's.

Besides Latifah, Mo'Nique as Ma Rainey is the other standout performance in the film. As Bessie Smith's mentor, Ma Rainey is every bit as fiery as Bessie, demanding respect as an artist and as a woman and breaking gender and sexual norms. With her character, my favorite scene is when Ma Rainey assumes the manner of a man and wears a suit, surprising Smith and captivating the audience as she performs ""Prove It on Me Blues"",
It is Rainey who helps Smith's fire burn. By teaching her to take risks and stand out and caring for her well being as an artist and a person, Rainey is a great character to love.

In addition to the acting and the characters, the soundtrack, sets, and costumes were fantastic. With the soundtrack, you have Bessie Smith songs, but you also have some instrumental jazz and big band jazz hat is perfect for the time period of the film. The costumes and sets really capture the glamor and the grit of the 20's and 30's; my favorite outfits were the ones worn by Bessie Smith and Ma Rainey.

A final aspect of the film that was notable was the portrayal of not only racism. but also colorism (especially with the paper bag test), and  respectability politics (especially with that record company that wanted to ""uplift the race""). Having these issues discussed in the film showed the complex issues of what black people had to deal with then and still have to deal with today. For black viewers like myself, it showed where we have been and how far we still need to go.

The only flaw in the film is that they got the nicknames for Bessie Smith and Ma Rainey mixed up. When Ma Rainey is announced in the film, she is introduced as ""The Empress of The Blues"", but in real life, she is called ""The Mother of The Blues"". Bessie Smith is the one who should've been called ""Empress of The Blues"", not Ma Rainey.

As someone who loves The Harlem Renaissance, especially the lesser known parts of it, this film was so entertaining that I viewed it twice in two days before writing this review.. As a black, queer, woman it was great to see the story of someone who lived and loved by her own rules. Bessie Smith (and Ma Rainey) were the first people to embody what would be the spirit of rock n' roll and history is much better for it.",1477612800,8,2994,4.424682395644283
7199570,3,B00XUQAFVK,"While Queen Latifah and Mo'nique are outstanding, I was somewhat disappointed in the facts/ not facts presented. If you want to make a movie about Bessie's turbulent, amazing life, then do NOT adjust the story - her life was dramatic and interesting without adding fictional bits or stretching the truth to make it more ""enjoyable."" (i.e. the real relationship between her and Jack G.).
Mo'Nique (who would have ever thought??) is outstanding in performance. She truly channeled Ma Rainy. Queen L is ... well, she is Queen! Her voice, acting, and look (costumes, setting) are exceptional.
A beautiful movie and amazing cast. Just wish it would have stuck more to the truth.",1476921600,,673,5.017857142857143

Rating: 3.5 out of 5.0

A good number of years in the making, Bessie is an HBO biopic chronicling the life of Bessie Smith, aka The Empress of the Blues. Queen Latifah does a fine job not only depicting Bessie's both irascible and generous personality but sings some of her big hits that add to the overall verisimilitude of the film.

Bessie's parents died when she was very young so her older sister Viola took over raising all of the younger siblings in the family. There is no evidence however that Viola acted punitively in raising Bessie and that there was this great conflict between them. This is one instance in the film where history was bent in order to perhaps give the story some extra needed conflict.

Bessie's relationship to the noted blues singer, Ma Rainey (played convincingly by Mo'Nique), also was altered somewhat to perhaps give the narrative a little more spice. In reality, Bessie first became associated with Ma Rainey at the much younger age of 14. There is also little evidence that Bessie and Ma Rainey were at odds with each other and had a falling out over a purported rivalry. Later in the film Ma Rainey is seen to be joyfully dancing to one of Bessie's records and that's consistent with an account from Rainey's accompanist (as noted in the article ""How Accurate is Bessie?"" by Laura Bradley in Slate Magazine).

Bessie's relationship to her second husband, Jack Gee (played by the excellent Michael K. Williams of Boardwalk Empire fame), is fairly accurate, culminating in the true-to-life abduction of Bessie's adopted son by Gee, who left her after Bessie found out he backed a rival singer.

There are many more interesting things we find out about Bessie throughout the narrativeI found the scene of her first recording with Columbia Records fascinating as the primitive nature of recording music at that time (Bessie sings into a large drum) is quite apparent.

Other scenes prove quite gripping including Bessie being stabbed in her hometown after an argument in a club, her encounter with a racist novelist at an upscale part in New York City as well as Bessie chasing a bunch of Ku Klux Klansmen away from one of her tent concerts down south.

Some of the script feels truncated as the film's scenarists provide little buildup regarding a few major events in Bessie's life. I'm thinking how they gloss over how Bessie lost most of her fortune at the beginning of The Great Depression (did she lose a lot of her money in the stock market or was she also over generous with friends?); these are questions I would have liked answered. In addition, there is no context to her decision to adopt her young son, Jack. You never see her talking about adopting the boysuddenly he appears at the family dinner table, out of the blue.

With changing musical tastes, Bessie's popularity dwindled somewhat in the 1930's. It was up to famed producer John Hammond, to arrange for Bessie's big comeback concert and last recordings in NYC. But Hammond was quoted as saying much later on that he was a little disappointed that Bessie declined to sing her trademark blues substituting more popular big band songs of the time.

Writer/director Dee Ree's decision not to depict the car crash that claimed the life of Bessie Smith may have been a missed opportunity to clear up a persistent myth about her death promulgated by the likes of such luminaries as playwright Edward Albee in his play ""The Death of Bessie Smith."" It was Albee's thesis that Smith may have survived the car crash had she been allowed admittance to a nearby ""whites only"" hospital. The truth of the matter was that Bessie already was severely injured having lost a large amount of blood with part of her arm being severed. In addition, due to the racism of the times, no hospital that catered to whites would have considered treating Bessie, and those at the scene of the crash would not have considering bringing her to one.

Bessie is a well-done biopic that captures the life and times of Bessie Smith. Queen Latifah does an excellent job in depicting the positive and negative sides of the famed singer's personality. In the name of dramatic license, some conflict between the characters was invented to enhance the story. Other events feel a bit rushedalthough most of events depicted are fairly true to life. Bessie is recommended as it depicts an important chapter in both African-American and American musical history.",1460764800,,4466,4.809647979139505

7199624,2,B00XUQAFVK,"I read a number of good reviews of this movie but it didn't live up to them for me. Way too much about her being bi and very little about her music. The world is full of bi people with no talent, Bessie wasn't one of them so why spend so much time on her love life?  ""Ray"", the Ray Charles bio movie did a much better job of balancing his personal problems versus his  incredible talent.",1451001600,2,387,4.012987012987013

7199627,3,B00XUQAFVK,"As a person who is not familiar with Bessie Smith's music or her life, this movie did not enlighten me.  Apparently from the scenes with the brown bag, she didn't take no mess. The lesbian scenes and the 'adopted' son made the movie all the more confusing. I guess the lesbian scenes was for shock value, because that relationship seemed to drop at the end.  If you do not know the singer, this movie gives small snippets of her running under the bed as a little girl. Why, I do not know. Who the little girl was running from? Beats me.  As the singer matured in life, in her depressed state, the nude scene of Queen Latifah, I think, was unnecessary.  Mo'Nique's portrayal of Ma Rainey helps the film.  However, I feel this movie would have been better if it was produced in the vain of ""Lady Sings the Blues"" with Diana Ross.  At least the story of Billie Holiday was told thoroughly in the two hours, and you heard all her songs to became familiar with the singer and the time period.",1448064000,,987,4.366120218579235

7199632,4,B00XUQAFVK,"The acting in this movie was well above average and the production and detailing of this period piece was impressive. Queen Latifah, Mo'Nique, and the other actors portrayed their characters with conviction and authenticity. However, as impressive as it was presented, I didn't find the movie that engaging. It was entertaining, for sure, but there wasn't a real sense of suspense or insight to hold my attention. Biopics can be a challenge, as the audience--in most cases--already knows what will happen to the featured character. For me, I like to see the motivation behind segments of a person's life; why choices were made, what options were missed, others who played a part in decisions, etc. Another knit-picky point was the way the movie ended. Fans of Bessie know how she died, and though tragic, the circumstances surrounding her death further demonstrated how certain people were treated. These points aside, a plus for this movie is the music. Several Bessie Smith songs, as well as other songs from the period, are liberally used throughout the movie. To me, the music is enough reason to watch this film. ""Shout out"" to the music supervisor!",1445817600,7,1154,5.015625

7199637,5,B00XUQAFVK,"I've been a Bessie Smith fan since the late '60s when my bluesy friends insisted I get to know her.  Wouldn't have thought anyone could really do her justice in a biopic, but of course that was before Queen Latifah came along.  This ROCKS and it RULES and it's about the best biography ever, with some awesome and legitimate blues thrown in for good measure.",1445385600,9,358,4.492307692307692

7199644,5,B00XUQAFVK,"It is a great story in American music history that needed to be shared for a new generation. I had study her life and music as a music major in the late 70s-80s I had all ways wanted to see her story told on the big screen. The movie shared a good view of her life, but it was  even more colorful than they had time to explore. All of the actors and writers and musician's came together at the right time to make this a great HBO movie. Thanks for making Bessie.",1443484800,4,462,3.967741935483871

7199646,5,B00XUQAFVK,"I have said for years that Queen Latifah would be perfect to play blues legend Miss Bessie Smith. Miss Dana Owens kills it! I feel Queen Latifah gets her fiery spirit down pat and brings those of us who never got to see The Empress Of The Blues, a feel for who Bessie was really like!  I feel the whole cast was excellent, Tika Sumpter as Bessie's lesbian love Lucille is a great actress, she is currently a cast member of Tyler Perry's show on OWN The Haves And Have Nots, Tika is one to watch, she was in the final film of Whitney Houston, ""Sparkle"". Kandi Alexander as Bessie's abusive older sister Viola does great, you almost want to smack the mess out of her for the way she treated Bessie as a child! Mike Epps is great as Bessie's final lover Richard Morgan. Michael Kenneth Williams as Bessie's estranged husband Jack Gee is good, but he doesn't resemble him too much with the goatee, but he makes you dislike him as the character starts to treat Bessie in many horrible ways, so I guess he is doing his acting job good! Mo'Nique is Mother Of The Blues Ma Rainey, Mo'Nique is always a pleasure and gives Ma's character both grit & heart. Torry Kittles is Bessie's brother Clarence and is sympathetic and watchful after Bessie's fortunes begin to fade after 1929. There were a few things that weren't factually correct, Bessie never bought a big mansion for her family to live in with her, she bought them a home but she didn't live with her! The movie never mentions Bessie's other 2 sister's Tinnie and Lulu. I also feel that it should have shown what happened to Bessie. If you didn't know Bessie's history, you may have thought she rode off into the sunset with Richard Morgan. Chris Albertson's book ""Bessie"" is a great read. The film gets it 90 % right, so as movie bio's go, this is about perfect! A must see!",1442620800,12,1824,4.428571428571429

8716608,3,B00XUQAFVK,"I have been a student of Bessie Smith for many years.  I have read everything that has been published.  I have talked with
Chris Albertson and listened to unreleased additional recollections of Bessie's niece who toured with her aunt for years.  When I heard this movie was coming out I just chuckled to myself thinking about all the stories Ruby had told and what fun it was going to be because Bessie was a character!  Whoever wrote the screenplay had no clue what Bessie was about and only based things from song lyrics.  It was terrible. And Queen Latifah played Queen Latifah just like she does in all her movies.  Some movies it fits her character and some it doesn't.  This one was definitely miscast.  Latifah does NOT have the guts and growl of Smith and plays it a little too Rebecca From Sunnybrook Farm.  Bessie was tough, crude and lived life to the fullest.  She was a show people.  Whatever she did - loved, laughed, sang - she did it full force.  This movie was a bit milk toast but did have a few vignettes from true stories but really played down.  It is the only movie ever made about Bessie so at least it is a step in the right direction.  Now beyond the story line, the costuming and sets were wonderful.  The only thing not factual was Bessie living in this big mansion. She didn't.  She lived in a row house in Philadelphia and wasn't really concerned with house beautiful.  When she was home - she was home and wanted to be normal and natural and not pretentious.  The director is a lesbian and Latifah is a lesbian.  Bessie was bi-sexual so they REALLY play up the lesbian aspect and kind of shove it down your throat.  One thing they didn't even touch on that well was Gertrude Saunders and how that changed everything including some very funny incidents but that was all left out of the movie.",1525651200,2,1821,4.444108761329305
