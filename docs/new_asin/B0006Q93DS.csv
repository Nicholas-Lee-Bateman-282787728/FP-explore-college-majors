8042406,4,B0006Q93DS,It was OK.. I was hoping for a highlight reel but it's more like a story line. It's not that bad but I was just hoping more ankle braking footage.. Still entertaining to watch though..,1408406400,,184,4.285714285714286
8042407,1,B0006Q93DS,"I didn't know what the term 'ankle breaker' meant? I hadn't followed the NBA since Jordan's second retirement from the Bulls. I thought this video might spark an interest for me once again in Basketball, but now I remember why I stopped watching the game. I now know that the term ankle breaker means a cross-over dribble to the hoop by a complete and utter ball hog.

Very few players who appear in these DVD's should be appreciated for what they do, I mean don't get me wrong, I am not saying it's not a skill, and if I went one on one with any of them, they would surely blow right by me... but when it comes to a team game, what is the point of this? Watching a guy hogging the ball and driving to the hoop, missing the lay up most of the time is not what I would say makes a good selection of highlights to watch on a DVD the NBA expects people to pay money for and watch over and over again. This is really quite boring to watch unless you are just completely obsessed with watching a 5 second play 100 times again and again of someone who clearly could pass the ball to anyone for the points, but no, instead just wants to show off with a great big ego where they personally spell team with an I in it somewhere.

If you think about it for a moment, these guys are just doing a crossover dribble and hogging a shot, with no regard for any team work, it's just all about them... and then most of them wonder why at the end of the season they have failed to make the finals. Sure, some guys who do this have managed to make it to the finals, but only some. Those guys may deserve a little praise, as they show both the skills to do this stuff, AND play a team game... which is what you need to win. Not be a ball hog and be remembered as that guy who had a couple of cross over dribble highlights to his career, but nothing to show he deserves a championship ring or be considered a great player of the game, and watching a whole hours worth of this stuff become an absolute snore fest. Especially since half of this thing is a profile on the players who hog the ball the most to show off in hopes some company might mistake their ballhogging skills for greatness and give them a shoe enforcement deal or something.

When I look back in history at guys who started as ballhog's, like Michael Jordan, he can at least hold his head up high because in each season he improved in every aspect of the game, and did become a team player, even in a few occasions where he passed for the clutch shots of a game, knowing that that was his favorite things to do... and that lead Jordan to 6 NBA championship rings, but at the same time, utilizing his team mates and making them superstars of the game with him. But these guys on this DVD, could they ever improve their game? No, only Payton and HArdaway seemed to pass the ball to someone else, but just about everyone else on these things want to be the star of the show, and never give up a shot to someone else... and thats why they will never be champions, and why I think this DVD is a complete waste of time.",1312848000,,3059,4.129194630872483
8042408,4,B0006Q93DS,"this is actually not bad cause it also shows in depth about the players although ankle breakers 1 had better players(steve nash, jason kidd, jason williams) its still pretty good it also has sweet crossovers with l.james and mellow when you see it, its actually not that bad after all!",1109808000,,285,4.72
8042409,1,B0006Q93DS,"I love watching someone get crossed up, but this video isn't really about that.  I thought I was going to get a highlight reel of ankle breaking moves: what I got was a boring video.  At least half of the video is a biography of the player they are going to highlight, w/ much if it just being praise from other players.  No real meat.  And hell, I know about these guys, if I wanted bios on them, that's what I would have bought.

The other half is about people getting beaten off the dribble, but rare are the footage of actual slick moves, and guys left stumbling or confused.  Watching a player weave through defenders, is not breaking ankles.  I wanted more shoots of moves like when Dwyane Wade crossed up Eric Snow so bad he fell down.  I saw that game, and they included that highlight.  Most of the rest was rather boring.",1109116800,10,831,4.309677419354839
