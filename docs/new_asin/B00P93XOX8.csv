6790922,5,B00P93XOX8,"A great movie the entire family enjoyed.  It's entertaining, interesting, beautiful, and educational.",1428019200,3,101,6.769230769230769
6790923,3,B00P93XOX8,Imagery was absolutely beautiful. However I felt that the personal story line was a little too much. I either wanted to hear more about their personal details or more about the Antarctic landscape.,1427587200,2,197,5.0
6790924,5,B00P93XOX8,I participated in the kickstarter so got the Blu ray quite a while ago. LOVED it! Have watched it a couple of times and will again soon. Highly recommended!,1427155200,2,156,4.413793103448276
6790925,5,B00P93XOX8,What an emotionally moving and stunning visualization of what it is like to be in McMurdo! I could just watch hours and hours of Antz's footage (as I pine to be back there). The film is a spectacular juxtaposition of interviews with people who live and work on Ice and the gorgeous scenery of the natural landscapes only found at the bottom of the world. A unique and engaging film!,1424649600,5,382,4.4714285714285715
6790926,5,B00P93XOX8,"I have worked 13 seasons in Antarctica, winter and summer.  Anthony Powell has masterfully captured the beauty of the landscape, the overhead skies, the harshness of the weather and of the remoteness, and the wonderful fascinating people who support the science stations.  This video helps me explain my life on the Ice to my family and friends.  And makes me yearn to return....",1424131200,9,379,4.984126984126984
6790927,5,B00P93XOX8,"A must have for an lover of nature documentaries.  It chronicles life in one of the harshest and loneliest places on earth.  More than that, it expertly show what it is like to live there.  As someone who lived in a remote area, a place that people dreamed about, I felt it did an amazing job on conveying the joy and immense solitude of life in these places.  Leaps and bounds better that Walter Herzog's ""Encounters at the End of the World""!  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED to push the max on your video setup.  Best viewed with the best video you can get.",1421884800,6,546,4.356435643564357
6790928,5,B00P93XOX8,This documentary is a great view into a the frozen south and into the lives of those who brave the extreme cold. A Year on Ice is full of breathtaking visuals and is not to be missed!,1420502400,2,183,3.972972972972973
6790929,5,B00P93XOX8,"If you liked Werner Herzog's ""Encounters At The End of the World,"" you'll truly love this film.  Undeniably more practical and businesslike in tone, it nevertheless taps the same vein as Herzog's opus in the end, revealing a romantic love of ""The Ice"" among those who ""winter over"" there, and capturing visuals just as stunning in their own way as those Herzog brought us.  We learn things about the continent and how those who brave it year-round cope with it that Herzog's summer-only project just wasn't able to bring us, making this an essential complement to that other film in the literal sense: ""A Year On Ice"" fills in the picture of Antarctica, providing a look at what it means to live and work there which is otherwise unavailable to the general public.",1419292800,12,764,4.7368421052631575

6790931,5,B00P93XOX8,"Great movie... fascinating place. My twin brother is living/working in Antarctica right now, and this movie accurately shows what it is like to be ""on the ice.""",1502236800,,160,4.962962962962963
6790932,5,B00P93XOX8,"A creatively-portrayed ""typical"" year in the life of the workers on the McMurdo Base support team - stitched together by the author from over 10 years of footage.  In my opinion, the other positive reviews for this film were vindicated; I watched it every night for the first three weeks after receiving the DVD!  The land-and-sky-scape time-lapse photography scenes are very well done, and the soundtrack features full-force storms and compelling music.  The details of base life as told by those who have lived there are engaging.  The extras on the DVD are also very good.  If you're into exotic natural environments, or have read ""Antarctica"" by Kim Stanley Robinson, you'll probably like this.",1501632000,,698,5.087719298245614
6790933,5,B00P93XOX8,"This was a thoughtful, beautifully filmed documentary of life in Antarctica.  It doesn't make me want to become a tourist there but it made me so aware of how others live.  It was great!",1501113600,,186,4.4411764705882355
6790934,5,B00P93XOX8,"This is for the Blu-ray version of Antarctica. To my eye, the video is a good honest 1080p resolution. Some of the low-light scenes are a little grainy, but not too bad. Overall, this documentary is just spectacular and should be watched on a large-screen tv for the visually immersive effect. Antarctic skies are pure beauty.

Also, the English subtitles are available and useful for understanding everyone.",1500681600,,408,5.08955223880597

6790936,3,B00P93XOX8,"Disappointing - too much emphasis on interminable interviews of the staff at McMurdo Sound and minimal information about Antarctica itself.
Very little footage of the visually stunning scenic grandeur of Antarctica - the ""Antarctic"" title on the cover on the video is a bit misleading.
I visited McMurdo Sound in January 2004 and spent several weeks in Antarctica.",1499904000,,364,5.293103448275862

6790943,5,B00P93XOX8,It's a fantastic movie. The photography is stunning.,1485388800,,52,5.625
6790944,4,B00P93XOX8,"Loved this documentary and the point of view. The beauty in the shots is hard to explain, and the time lapse photography is unbelievable. There was so much work and thought put into this that I'm honored to have watched it. That said, I would have liked more facts and more information about what the trade offs are for someone to live in Antarctica. E.g, no children or pets - what happens if someone gets pregnant? Is there a library onsite for books, is everything flown in or do they utilize the internet for reading? What's the connections like? Can people skype or just landline? With all of the potential for self reflection and thought, what have those few on the continent produced that has bettered our existence? A film like this has the potential to take us back to a time before technology was rampant, before social media held our attention at every moment, when we've no choice but to slow down and witness nature (the good and the bad) and appreciate it and our ability to survive.",1485302400,6,997,4.575418994413408

6790947,4,B00P93XOX8,"Anthony Powell braved years of harsh icy cold conditions to produce this wonderful documentary about the frozen south continent of Antarctica. To be honest I hadn't thought much about this land besides that I knew penguins lived there and had seen nature shows about the area. I was really surprised to find out that people actually live there year round. But now I can see why. Antarctica has some stunning lands of ice and snow, beautiful scenery and skies that looks amazing at night with hardly any lights around to spoil the view. Just seeing the sky at night with all the amazing stars makes this worth watching.

Some of the things you learn while watching this is that people start becoming slightly disorientated when there is not sun for part of the year. Some suffer from mental fatigue during the winters there. I'd never thought of what it might be like to hear absolutely no sounds in places of complete silence. Except some of the year you can get wild 222 mile an hour winds so that must be noisy.

And anyone who says God doesn't have a sense of humor has not seen the penguins in this documentary. They are adorable and made me laugh.

It seems the best people for the Antarctica environment are introverts who love to stay in bed with a book. Of course they have to work part of the time but it seems like the types of people who would like to live there enjoy the isolation. This documentary also shows all the crazy ways people find to entertain themselves.

I enjoyed watching this as snow is still on the ground. It was a good DVD to watch during the holiday season.

This took about 10 years to make and I'm amazed at the beautiful time lapse photography. Anthony Powell is very talented in that he created some of the equipment himself.

6790948,4,B00P93XOX8,"New Zealander Anthony Powell has spent the last 20 years or so working in Antarctica on a periodic basis and even married an American Woman there.  This documentary aims to capture a bit about the continent and a lot about its effect on the lives of the people who work there, especially during the winter.  As summer ends, the means to leave the continent disappear, so the population, such as it is, decreases dramatically.  The weather in Antarctica is never balmy, but the winter is especially brutal as the days without sunlight take their toll and temperatures drop precipitously.  In the film, we witness temperatures readings of -80 F and storm force winds that make you long for Saskatoon.

Although multiple countries have research stations on the continent, the U.S. station (McMurdo) is the largest by far and is also located very near New Zealand's station as well and most of the action centers on activities there.  Using home made equipment to control his cameras, Mr. Powell captures stunning landscapes, the southern lights and the stories of a sampling of people who work at the station in the summer and/or winter.  In addition to coping with a kind of seasonal affective disorder, lack of fresh fruit and missing significant family events (i.e., births, deaths, etc.), those who stay in the winter have to come to grips with the fact that when the last plane leaves at the end of summer, Antarctica is physically cut off from the rest of the world.  Thinking of this reminded me of the American Doctor Jerri Lin Nielsen who, while working on Antarctica, had to perform her own biopsy and self-administer chemotherapy after discovering that she had breast cancer.  She did receive help from others and an airdrop of supplies; however, she was still stuck for several months until planes could once again land.

A dichotomy between the beauty and harshness of the environment is evidenced not only in the topographical and weather scenes, but also in the fauna.  The viewer is exposed to penguins and seals in their natural habitat, but also mummified penguins and heartbreaking episodes of seals that have mistakenly wandered inland and die as a result.  Those who think nature can't be cruel should pay heed to this documentary.

I watched the documentary on a lark via Netflix and didn't realize that so much of the movie would be spent on interviews with those who live at the U.S. and New Zealand stations.  This isn't necessarily a criticism, but viewers should align their expectations accordingly.  When you consider that Anthony Powell has only recently made a foray into filmmaking, this effort is especially impressive.  Setting aside the surprising number of Antarctic dwellers who continue to mispronounce the name of the continent, I recommend this documentary to those who would like to learn more.",1481328000,,2832,4.968220338983051
6790949,5,B00P93XOX8,"Anthony Powell is brilliant, and his movie is too, a long labor of love, patience, and acquired skill at trying things to make the viewer know more clearly what it feels like to be there, all year long.  There's no big film crew, just a self taught filmmaker who has invested his heart and soul in making this film and getting both the stunning shots and the everyday textures of life on the ice. And he is as nice as he seems. Get the blu ray and watch it on the biggest screen you can find.",1481155200,6,492,4.125

6790953,5,B00P93XOX8,Great video about a place so far away and mysterious.  A year on the Ice takes you thru the continent with a real perspective of Antarctica.  This was a great view of things and places you would never see even if you visited.  Wonderful scenery and more than you expect with many surprises about this cold/dry continent.

My only criticisms are:

1. I believe there should have been a few of the still moments cut and just a few minutes explaining WHAT those people are doing.  They spend the winter fixing machinery.  Why?  There are hundreds more there during summer.  To do what?

2. I would have liked to have seen more of the terrain and more interviews with the people.  I know you can only show so much, but it really seemed limited.  Just a few more portions of the terrain?  Just a few more people?  Anyway...

I would have given it an additional 1/2 star but Amazon only allows whole stars, and I just couldn't give it 5 for the reason stated above.",1457395200,2,891,4.447204968944099

6790978,4,B00P93XOX8,"I like documentaries, and this one is no exception. It certainly gives a viewer an idea of what it might be like to live on one of the many science stations that pepper Antarctica. The focus seems to be more on the people who work there and why it was that they decided to go there, and, once there,  what they thought of the experience. There are some visually stunning shots of the landscape and the sky, and time-lapse is put to good use, though perhaps indulgently excessive,  at times. Still, overall, this film successfully imparts a feeling of what the experience of living on a science station  in Antarctica is like and explores the reasons why people do so.

Its taken me [this films director] more than ten years to make this film.  Ive worn out thousands of dollars worth of camera gear and spent countless hours standing in the freezing cold in order to capture the true feeling of this vast important place.

There are really only two seasons in Antarctica: a busy summer when most of the science happens and a wild & lonely winter that few people will ever experience.

To understand this place properly, you really need to spend one full year down here on the ice.

The above comes near the beginning of this unforgettable documentary where we get to spend one year with this films director (Anthony Powell) and some of the other people that work in Antarctica.

This documentary has some amazing photography and visuals.  I felt like I was actually in Antarctica!  I was glad that I did not have to experience any of its bitter cold and snow!!

What I also liked is the films narration.  The viewer is not inundated with a flurry of information about this continent but only essential information is given.  Powell seems to be the main narrator but there are comments (some of them quite funny) by some of the workers.

Some information is also presented to the viewer through printed factoids that appear onscreen.  For example:

Antarctica is the place on Earth most like [the planet] Mars.

Antarcticas winter is eight months long and this land is plunged into complete darkness during this time.  We get to see what the workers who stay here during the time do to escape the monotony that soon sets in.

I recommend not stopping this film when the end credits start rolling because this documentary continues into the credits and I found some of the comments quite interesting.

Finally, this documentary (the one released in 2015) has six extras.  I found all of them interesting.

In conclusion, I was glad to experience this magnificent land in the comfort of my living room!!!

6790983,5,B00P93XOX8,"Documentaries on the Antarctic continent are often about the expanse of ice or the expeditions or the wildlife. This one, for a change, is mostly about the lives of the scientists, technicians and other staff who inhabit the US research station at McMurdo, south of New Zealand, over the period of an year, summer following winter, since there are just two seasons out there. Though their lives are rather routine and unexciting, the spectacular scenery and photography provide the ideal backdrop to make it exciting watching. Time-lapse photography is perhaps a little overused in this documentary but you never tire of watching the Sun traverse the sky during the 'day', coming low down to the horizon and then rising again up in the sky in the 'night'. There is phenomenal footage of the Aurora Australis with its spray of greenish light across the sky.  Time-lapsed images of the continuous night of four months, shows the starlit sky and the Milky Way, as the stars migrate across the sky, making you feel as though the Antarctic is Nature's giagantic Planetarium. It is simply breathtaking to watch these dazzling videos of the continent, not to speak of the massive ice shelfs, the time-lapsed images of the advance of sea ice closing in on the ocean and the majesty of Mt. Erebus, the Earth's southern most volcano. The documentary has been shot over a period of ten years with cameras specially modified so that they would function under the extreme conditions of the Antarctic winter, when storms rage every week and the temperature could be as low as minus 80 deg Celsius.

Life at McMurdo is documented through interviews with the various men and women who work there and their response to living there for a whole year, particularly in the extreme isolation of the Winter, when the Sun disappears completely for 4 months. Apparently, during the winter months, a category 1 storm is common every week, a category 3 once a month and a category 5 once a season. There are lighter moments in the film when a technician who ventures out into the forbidding expanse outside  the station, says that it is most important to keep track of which is your pee bottle and which one is drinking water! The interviews with the workers shows that their lives are mostly routine and many of them feel the isolation in their own ways. Most workers rue the fact that they are away from important family occasions like the arrival of a baby or a parent's demise or even mundane things like not having fresh vegetables and fruits. One nice interlude is the marriage of Anthony Powell, maker of this documentary, to Christine, whom he meets in McMurdo and we see Christine's father giving away his daughter over the phone to Powell, whom he had never seen or met.

We would think that the Antarctic is pristine in its fresh air and smell, uncontaminated by man's dirty habits. But the documentary tells us that the millions of Adelie penguins raise a big stench and that dead penguins, if they are not quickly consumed by the predator birds, take a long time to decompose in the frozen environment.  One scene which was heart-wrenching to watch was that of a seal which was obviously lost in the ice and crawling towards the station and bleating helplessly. The staff were forbidden to intervene and help, ostensibly to leave Nature to take its course. It seems such a selective approach towards Nature when Man has subverted and tamed it so much for his needs. I cannot understand how not saving one poor seal would have atoned for all that we have done to Nature.

The film is worth seeing simply for its spectacular photography.",1448064000,,3622,4.768740031897926

This is a documentary from a filmmaker previously unknown to me: Anthony Powell.  It was made with some assistance from the New Zealand film commission and it is exactly what the title implies: it documents one year spent on a base in Antarctica.  Though New Zealand has its own Antarctic base (very close to the American basethe two are geographically closer than any other 2 bases on the continent) the filming is done at the American base, which is by far the largest one there.

Of course there are beautiful scenes of the landscapes.  For that reason you should see this in high-def.  And of course there is some discussion about the scientific research being done, the politics of the treaty on the Antarctic, climate change, and all that.  But really the focus is on the people: on how an entire year in Antarctica affects people, on the type of person that stays year after year, versus the tourists or those only there for the summer, etc.  I found this totally fascinating.  Anyone who enjoys documentaries should enjoy this.  A-.",1447804800,5,1102,4.747368421052632

What made it very good, instead of great, was the director's (and writer's and producer's - they're all the same guy) overuse of time-lapse. There were many beautiful time-lapse scenes at the beginning of the documentary but after about the twentieth, or thirtieth, time-lapse, you get a little uneasy. This guy's a one-trick pony, sort of. On and on it goes, throughout the film. I've seen this kind of incessantly-repeated gimmick before, in films where one guy made all the decisions, most notably in a nature series about Australia, which I finally gave up on after endless jerky camera shots and sped-up vehicle travel shots. Some guys just don't get it. In spite of the solo-decision issues in this film, you definitely get a new slant on Antarctica and I considered it time well spent.",1441929600,,930,4.746913580246914

He did a fantastic job of documenting and videoing life on the ice, and his recording of trips to Black Island and a lot of the other places there gave my wife a better understanding of what I wrote about while I was there. At the end of the main video portion, Antz also included several short segments, including good video inside the historic and early exploration huts at Hut Point, Cape Evans (both used by Robert Scott's expedition crews) and the one at Cape Royds, used by Sir Shackleton's crew.

Antarctica: A Year on Ice' was a very pleasant surprise for me. I go to documentaries warily, but almost always I am pleasantly surprised. You would think I would learn by now. As the photographer and director Anthony Powell tells and shows us, this documentary is spectacular in the realm of the sights we see, and the feelings shared by the participants. It took him ten years to put this all together.

The Summer on Antartica is staffed by 5,000 people on McMurdo Station, the U.S. Research center, where most of this documentary was filmed. In the winter, the population goes down to 700"", and that is where the best and most interesting info lies. The photography is spectacular. This is a white wilderness and in many places no human has placed a step. The change in seasons is certainly a phenomenom, from October to February is summer, and the winter descends, -40 degrees is common, the entranceway to many buildings is snowed in, storms from Category one to category 3 are common. Life is led inside buildings.

Powell met and married his wife at McMurdo, we meet the firemen, pilots, computer personnel, chefs, retail clerks and many of the other personnel who share their day to day life with us. After February, no flights are available in or out. I was interested in healthcare, but that was not discussed at all. It takes a special person to remain at McMurdo. It sounds like you work six days with one day off, so much of the time is spent eating, working and sleeping. For the 700 who stay year round, it sounds like they much prefer the smaller crowd. They become a team of sorts. Homesickness and isolation seems to be an issue at times. No mention of the salary to compensate for the time spent. Indeed the personal stories were the best, although the scenery was extraordinary. In fact when October arrives, there is a little resentment about the new arrivals. That wears off and life goes on.

Heartily Recommended. prisrob 06-26-15",1435276800,2,1971,4.7043478260869565

6791012,5,B00P93XOX8,"This film offers an in-depth look at what life can be like for those who choose to commit themselves to the extremely cold and lonely 'world' of Antarctica. While some embrace the serenity, some long for their typical lives in the places that they normally reside. The same polarization occurs in terms of who likes the 24 hour darkness, and who can't wait to see the sun rise again. At times, it almost seemed like I was watching a depiction of a normal everyday lifestyle, as the population was engaged in everyday activities, and even a wedding. One thing is certain: every member of the population was affected in some way, mentally and emotionally. I recommend this film because it makes the brutally cold and dark world of Antarctica almost tangible to an adventurous soul, which is a great feeling to have. There isn't a whole lot of science in this film; it's more about the human condition and how people adapt.",1434672000,,920,4.685185185185185

Things haven't changed a whole lot since Scott first explored here in the early 1900's. While still extremely difficult to get to, this film gives viewers a slim glimmer of hope that someone ordinary could still spend time in this fantastical place. Bases still need storekeepers and firemen and dispatchers and mechanics -- not all of the population who lives here during the summer or winters over consists of scientists.

Aside from the breathtaking, otherworldly cinematography, the focus on people and their day to day lives and what drives people to choose to live and work here is very engaging. Finally, on a political note, the fact that all of these nations are there working together is driven not by governments, but simply the people there choosing to do so. Maybe there is something to learn from that in our larger world.",1514764800,2,527,4.739130434782608
