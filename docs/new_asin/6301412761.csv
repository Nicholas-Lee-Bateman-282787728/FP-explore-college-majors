327988,4,6301412761,"The movie portrays the very different lives of two very different people as they begin to think about what they are going to do after high school, a.k.a., ""the rest of their lives.""  Yet, what they know for sure  is that they love each other, the rest they'll figure out along the way.  The story is a triumph of love over all odds.  Cusack plays a character  that is the personification of decency.  A decency that is a marked  contrast with several other characters in the movie and in real life.  Watching this movie won't change your life, but it will fill you with a  faith that love is not only possible in the most unlikely places, but is  the only sure feeling there is.",935452800,,678,4.352
327989,5,6301412761,"This has to be one of the best love stories ever written.  Not because its an unusual situation, but because it is so normal. You could believe these people are living next door, and you know two people exactly like this when  you went to high school. And Crowe gets extra points for creating the  absolutely most lovable guy character in any movie.",914112000,,349,4.507936507936508

328069,3,6301412761,"This and probably A Tiger's Tale with Ann-Margret are my favorite romance movies.  John Cusack plays a just graduated high school senior who is trying to go out with a girl who just happens to be beautiful and smart.  She is also new so she doesn't know that many people.  After he asks her to the last senior party of the year.  It seems like  she just remembers the guys from the kind of cars they have.
After staying out all night and taking her home.  They begin a relationship that you cant help bu hope will work out.  John Mahoney who just died yesterday plays the girls Father who only wants what's best for her.  And will do anything to provide for her.  Even if it means breaking the law.  He also feels that her new boyfriend is holding her back.  Ione Skye plays the girl.  And she is really great.  She is another one of those actresses that seemed to be headed to be a big star,  And disappeared.  This is a very good movie that never gets old.",1517875200,,958,4.2154696132596685

328255,5,6301412761,"Love John Cusack, really loved him in this comedy ""Say Anything"" & also ""Bullets Over Broadway."" John is just a great actor so he is also great in dramas, really loved him in ""Eight Men Out"" & ""1408"" which is a drama/horror movie. Really good to see John in this movie with his sister Joan who is also a great actor. Also liked the two of them together as teens in the comedy ""Sixteen Candles"" and as young adults in ""Gross Pointe Blank."" ""Say Anything"" is a great teen comedy and it's without a lot of the teen shenanigans usually seen in teen movies, and John is really great in this role. Lili Taylor is also great in this movie as the dramatic, emotional, guitar-playing girlfriend who got dumped. This movie is funny but it also has some drama and a big twist with the daughter/father relationship. Really a great script with great actors to execute it.

328309,4,6301412761,"Say Anything stars a remarkably young John Cusack.  Wow I've never seen him this young!  He's not hallucinating in a hotel room in this film.  Quite the opposite- instead he's trying to win over a girl that's way out of his league.  A prissy girl who lives in a rich home.  He absolutely MUST have this girl (played by Ione Skye).  When you see this girl you can't really blame him.  There's one problem- John's never so much as talked to this girl so he doesn't know what to say.  Plus she has aspirations visiting Europe and has bigger career goals than John does.

Despite this John makes that nervous phone call and asks Ione to loosen up and go to a party with him.  She accepts, and soon enough John and Ione hit off a great relationship.  I didn't see that one coming!  I thought for sure John would spend a large chunk of the movie fighting hard to try and win her over.  There's another problem- Ione's father (John Mahoney's character) he's not the nice guy he's portrayed as.  Turns out he's been illegally taking money intended for older people and using it for Ione's education.  The government has been following his every move for 5 years.  I was thinking ""5 years?  Why not arrest him like say, 4 years ago?""

Despite being accused of such a crime, he's looking out for his daughter's future aspirations and realizes her potential which means he'd prefer that John Cusack's character not come around since he's well below Ione's level, but he doesn't exactly kick John out or anything.  Instead her father assumes a temporary romance is going to happen between the two and when summer is over, they'll go their separate ways.  Not according to persistent John!  I must say though, the father playing a bigger role later on came out of left field and is probably the only truly interesting thing about this romance.

To be fair there is something appealing about this romance.  Enough for me to give it 4 stars.  It just has enough charm I guess, and plus it has all the typical 80's cliches and breakup situations such as John getting depressed, cruising around town drunk and questioning his classmates what makes them experts at girls and yet none of them have girlfriends.  Also some of John's female friends (who are rockers I think).  They provide interesting advice and even say the girl is out of John Cusack's league.  John ignores everyone who thinks he doesn't have a chance with Ione however.

Plus I recall my high school years when I was afraid to approach girls and would say silly things due to being nervous, so I can sort of relate to some of John's actions.  Also Peter Gabriel's ""In Your Eyes"" never sounded so appropriate!  The song is ideal for this type of movie which helped me look at the song in a different light.  The way John blasts the song in the middle of the night outside Ione's bedroom window is a great moment.

Overall a light story and a decent romance, but perhaps Ione could have played a bigger role in some way besides being the smart girl out of John's league.  She doesn't really do a whole lot besides sit around and have discussions with her father about education and boyfriends.  John Cusack does teach her to drive later on which is nice.  Actually John could have been more interesting as well other than taking the temporary break up so seriously that he can't think straight.  Maybe this could have resulted in John wrecking his car, stirring up trouble with his friends or crashing a party.  *Something*.  Still, the acting is fine by all the actors so no complaints from me.  Pretty good movie overall.",1471651200,,3571,4.572555205047319

328356,3,6301412761,"I bought the DVD hoping to hear Freiheit's great song, ""Keeping The Dream Alive"". It is on the accompanying CD released by WTG Records and listed as being in the film by the IMDB. It is even listed in the closing credits. Alas, I didn't hear the song and since much of my enjoyment of 80s' movies comes from the music, I was disappointed. Peter Gabriel's ""In Your Eyes"" is featured twice; the second time emanating from a boom box that John Cusak holds above his head while standing outside of the bedroom window of Ione Skye.

As for the film, it's certainly more grown-up than the John Hughes' 80s' films. In ""Say Anything"", the father of the female lead goes to jail for embezzling from a hospice he runs  something that Ferris Buellers dad probably wouldnt do.

All the performances are convincing, the romance is not cloying, the pacing is fine and John Cusak is his usual amiable and thoughtful self.
So, if I missed it and someone can identify the scene in which Keeping The Dream Alive is featured, I would appreciate it. Meanwhile its a 4 star film, with a star docked for the songs omission.",1470700800,,1101,4.522613065326633

328360,5,6301412761,"Lloyd Dobler (Cusack) is a quiet and earnest but extraordinary guy who thinks he's nothing special. He likes kickboxing and has a noble heart, and he wants more than anything to date the beautiful and brilliant school valedictorian, Diane Court (Skye). The summer after their graduation, she accedes to his niceness and persistence, and their relationship grows despite the misgivings of her overprotective father (Mahoney), who manages a nursing home. Besides the father's disapproval, Lloyd is facing a deadline: Diane has a scholarship to go to England at the end of the summer. This sweet and sincere 1989 film by writer-director Cameron Crowe has almost no shocking drama or real villain, but is effective and moving, like its hero. This is a story of normal people coping with real-world problems. Diane's relationship with her father is convincing, as are his motives for doing what he does, even though it's wrong. She loves him and wants to do right by him. That puts her in conflict with her devotion to Lloyd, an aimless young man who captures her heart. Her father is against the relationship because he views Lloyd as an obstacle to his daughter's success. Lloyd is one of the most honestly told and played characters I've seen, and one I can relate to as a man.",1470009600,6,1275,4.880184331797235

328622,4,6301412761,"Say Anything may be best known in some circles as the boom box scene movie but having watched the movie, I can now say that it says a lot more than that. I think Cameron Crowe really avoided the teen movie clich&eacute; of having the popular girl fall for the school nerd and/or vice versa. The two lead characters played by John Cusack and Lorne Skye seem like fairly average high school students, neither is super popular, but one seems to have more ambition than the other. The falling in love felt more real and organic than most teen movies of recent movies, which lend it sort of a classical charm and an eye opening look at the all-consuming power of love.

The one thing that didn't quite work for me was the subplot of the father played by John Mahoney and his IRS troubles as he tries to keep his teenage daughter from throwing her life away. Im virtually positive that it fits somewhere, I just didn't connect the pieces together. It doesnt take away from the sweet message that Say Anything has about the all-consuming power of love.",1447891200,,1045,4.5

I didn't love this movie. In fact, this movie just confirmed all the negative things I thought about Cameron Crowe as a writer and director. First of all, people don't talk like these characters, or any characters he writes. It's like he's never actually listened to people speak.

Crowe picks good music and that seems to be the highlight of his films. The stories are dull, the characters are flat, ridiculous and speak like whiny robots who are trying to emulate human emotion but failing miserably.

Just don't. If you haven't seen it, don't bother. If you saw it as a teen and loved it, don't rewatch it-- you'll regret it.

John Cusack is the best part of it and he's playing someone who I cannot imagine being a real human person. Ione Skye is AWFUL.

People might classify it as a romantic comedy because so many characters and scenes are charming and clever. What makes you laugh is relating to the moments of awkward firsts. The first time you call someone you like, the first date, the first time a hero lets you down are themes in this movie. It's a movie about making choices and taking chances.

328803,5,6301412761,"""Say Anything..."" is a teen romantic comedy-drama that follows the relationship between Lloyd Dobler,an average student, and Diane Court,the class valedictorian, after their graduation from high school. It stars John Cusack and Ione Skye together with John Mahoney,Lily Taylor and Joan Cusack. This serves as the directorial debut of Cameron Crowe,who also wrote the film's screenplay.

The story was set in Seattle,Washington. Lloyd Dobler, an average student and aspiring kickboxer, who attempts a relationship with the lovely valedictorian Diane Court immediately after their graduation from the same high school. Intrigued by Lloyd's endearing manner and willingness to take a chance at someone,they began seeing each other regularly. But when the father interfered,they have to end their relationship. In the end,Diane began to realize that there is just more to life than just good grades and perfection.

This is definitely one of the best high school films ever released. Cameron Crowe definitely made a classic film that remains memorable after it has been released more than 25 years ago. The jokes maybe dated and the story of two different people falling in love maybe old-fashioned,the leads - Cusack and Skye - have authentic feelings and emotions that they become more than just stereotypes that viewers normally see just any other movie. Aside from well-developed characters,we also get to witness two great young thespians that exhibited real and authentic feelings.",1431302400,,1483,5.5

I eagerly anticipated the infamous boombox scene but I gotta say, that scene, along with the rest of this movie is just not that great. It's nowhere near as good as other 80's classics like The Breakfast Club, Ferris Bueller, Weird Science, etc. It was almost boring at times.

SAY ANYTHING: Everyone has a special talent; Lloyds is being with Diane. He knows it; he just has to convince her. Cusacks Lloyd is an original: sensitive, spontaneous, seriously silly; an attentive gentleman; a motor-mouthed marvel, desperately intense, doggedly persistent and an unrepentant romantic. Skyes Diane is vulnerable and trusting; innocent, and naive enough to believe she really can say anything to her doting dad.

While its clearly Lloyds movie, its also a father/daughter tale about trust and betrayaland about breaking away, as Diane graduates painfully from girl to adult. And its a falling-in-love flick with amusingly accurate insight into the flurry of confusing feelings accompanying a hearts first tentative test-drive. Its a teen romance about serious responsibility, treated with adult respect and intelligence.

328962,5,6301412761,"Say Anything is a great film. Probably still Crowe's best film. As you get into the lives of the characters and identify with them, the film becomes more personal. Crowe leads Cusack and Skye to a pair of their best performances, despite their youth. The writing is what brings out the virtuosity in the talents at hand but the soul and heart of the film is in the acters and their ability to play the leads near perfectly.

Not much more to say. A classic that holds up to standard even with it's quirky 80s characters.",1421971200,,520,4.416666666666667

329187,5,6301412761,"I picked up this film while doing a review of romantic comedies.  This is a somewhat unusual romcom, especially since it doesn't emphasize sexual excitement between the young lovers.  This might have seemed strange to my 60s generation, and it is refreshingly strange to see a mature message in a romcom.  Lloyd Dobler in this film, played by John Cusack, is well-liked and a ""regular guy"" and not a nerd - but he is the guy selected as the designated driver.  He never does anything really wrong, and displays a strong character.  While he seems to have mediocre career prospects - especially to his brilliant girlfriend's father - he actually has a character with leadership qualities and dependability that would bring him success without technical excellence.  Without giving away the details, I especially liked a scene at the end when Dobler ""pocketed an insult"" (as Gandhi used to say) from his girlfriend's father. Thus, I consider this 1989 film to be morally and philosophically excellent - even though its technique is not brilliant, and it doesn't have the explosive chemistry more typical of a romcom.  It's more like healthy wisdom!",1390176000,3,1146,5.0

It was so sweet how they held each other before she went into the house and I also love the scene when she tells Lloyd she is sorry and loves him after she broke up with him a while before that.  Both scenes I get teary eyed almost every time!  Lili Taylor is terrific in the movie with her pining away at Joe, her ex-boyfriend through many songs and also advice she gives to Lloyd that usually includes something about Joe.

Lloyd Dobler (John Cusack)is a street-wise, irresponsible, carefree young guy with no plans for the future.  Diane Court is a book-wise high school valedictorian who lives alone with her divorced father James (John Mahoney).  James pushes Diane to excel in academics.  She chose to live with her father, loves him and accepts his leadership.  Lloyd meets Diane and falls in love with her.  When James meets Lloyd, he becomes deeply concerned.  He cannot bear to think of Diane marrying a seemingly shiftless person with no plans.  At a dinner at Diane's home deliberately set up for Lloyd to embarrass himself while answering questions leveled by friends and colleagues of James, Lloyd makes a fool of himself as planned and his relationship with Diane appears to be doomed.  At this point, Director Cameron Crowe brings in a surprise, blockbuster turning point that suddenly levels the human relationship playing field.

329233,5,6301412761,"If you haven't watched this movie at least once in your life, you're not living it right! I've worn my dvd out and it never gets old.  The 80's child in me just loves it and recognizes its perfection. The leads are a little ruff around the edges, acting wise, but it only adds to the chemistry between the characters. Cusack and Skye just suck you in and you can't turn away. The plot is simple, but relatable. It's not rocket science, but the characters circumstances are so familiar (even all these years later) and that makes the movie work. I love the music and love the way the scenes are played.

Lloyd Dober is such a simple character, but he has so much heart. That's the first thing you notice about him. He's fun and he does his own thing. He's confident, but still vulnerable in a lot of ways. This vulnerabilty is highlighted when he falls for Diane. He's genuine and he knows what his strengths and weaknesses are. Therefore, he knows that he and Diane are from two different worlds and those worlds don't exactly mesh. Still, he goes after what he wants. He's not afraid despite the challenges and I loved that.

Diane is smart, shy, and a planner. It took me a while to warm up to the character, but I did. It was interesting to see her fall for Dober because you could tell her plan was just to do something that she felt like doing without planning ahead, for once. It was nice to see it become more than that for her. I also enjoyed the story with her and her father. It was very calm, but punctuated.

The film was shot in the Seattle area and the story involves a group of youths after high school graduation.

Ione Skye plays Diane, a misfit ""preppy"" girl who suddenly comes alive upon graduation after striking up a relationship with Lloyd Dobler, played by John Cusack. Diane has a scholarship to a prestigious college in England and her Dad, played by John Mahoney, doesn't want some aimless drifter getting in the way of her success.

The second half isn't as entertaining as the first half because it leaves the high school graduation antics behind to focus on Diane and Lloyd's increasingly intimate relationship, as well as unexpected revelations about Diane's father. Those who like stories about romantic relationships will no doubt appreciate the second half more than I did.

A handful of things I appreciated about the film: (1.) The situations and relationships all smack of real life and you can tell that the writer, director and actors all put some quality time into creating this ""reality."" (2.) For instance, two of lloyd's best friends are girls, Corey and D.C., who try to advise him on his new relationship. (3.) Although I'm not a fan of Cusack by any means (nor am I not a fan, if you know what I mean), his character of Lloyd Dobler is excellent and memorable. (4.) The first half is filled with laugh-out-loud scenes, like Corey playing her guitar at a party, still venting her emotions regarding a past flame. We've all seen this at some of those parties, haven't we? And (5.) unlike, say, ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Porky-s/dp/6305168903/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Porky's</a>"" and ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/American-Pie-Widescreen-Unrated-Ultimate-Edition/dp/B00005LKHW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">American Pie (Widescreen Unrated Ultimate Edition)</a>"" there's thankfully no childish raunch. In other words, ""Say Anything"" is a classy teen-college flick.

They're getting ready to graduate from high-school and if he's going to make his move he'd better hurry or he might never have the chance again.

After hearing countless positive reviews about this movie I decided to see for myself what all the hype was about.  In a world of countless bad romantic dramady's I was expecting Say Anything to be a moving unsentimetal view of a new relationship.  This is little more than your standard chick flick.  Not to say that this is Katherine Heigle chick flick bad,  but its also not a very original depiction of a new budding romance.  Thier were scenes in this movie that made me cringe because of its cornyness.  This would all be fine if I were a 17 year old girl but I happen to be a 30 year old man,  and when a movie gets this much acclaim it should speak to all demographics.  I am not trying to say that Say Anything is an abysmal mess but I do think that it might have been a more original movie in 1989 and has not been able to stand the test of time.",1327449600,2,990,4.0880829015544045

They were an unlikely pair, but, in spite of everything, they ""clicked.""  Of course, there was a little drama involved (see the movie and you'll understand).  Overall, I enjoyed it - and recommend it to you - 22 years after it's release!

329391,5,6301412761,"Say Anything is a terrific movie full of laughs, romance, family tension, and uncertainty. In a nutshell, it is a fantastic movie that is honest and has a lot of heart.

John Cusack is perfect in the role of Lloyd Dobler - a nice, confident guy that aims high and goes for the smart girl in his class. He has two friends who are girls that help him figure it out, and he gets Diane Court to go out with him on a date. What follows is a realistic depiction of a young relationship. I especially thought the struggles between Diane and her father were realistic, at least in the sense that her father (played perfectly by John Mahoney) wanted to help her out but also didn't want to let go (i.e. Diane having to make phone calls home every night). Lloyd is a gentleman that takes care of Diane (pointing out the broken glass in the parking lot for her to walk around) and is a good example for young guys to follow.

The movie is definitely 80's,but it was made in 1989 so it definitely has a 90's feel and look as well.

I agree with the reviewer's scores on the video, audio and extras. The commentary was very enjoyable and I was able to get more insight into the movie and the casting.

My advice, don't watch this expecting a chick flick but rather have no preconception as you approach it and you might enjoy it more than I did.  :D",1294617600,2,478,4.459770114942529
329395,4,6301412761,"For all of the praise for John Hughes' teen flicks of the 1980s, Cameron Crowe is often forgotten. But he wrote ""Fast Times at Ridgemont High"" (1992) and wrote and directed ""Say Anything"" (1989) and ""Almost Famous"" (2000) many years later -three intelligent movies about teenagers, all with a great sense of humor. ""Say Anything"" is the sweetest, a post-high school romantic comedy. Lloyd Dobler (John Cusack) is a recent high school grad who has a shine for valedictorian Diane Court (Ione Skye). But Diane's father (John Mahoney) is wary of Lloyd's lack of ambition. And Mr. Court's business is under investigation by the IRS, which threatens to disrupt his relationship with his daughter. So it's going to be a trying summer for everyone, while Diane prepares to go to college in England.

Lloyd and Diane are both really nice people who are unusually honest with themselves. The strength of so many memorable teen films of the 1980s was that they represented teenagers as they really are, as young adults with full emotional lives, ambitions, and challenges. Here, Lloyd lives with his divorced sister Constance (Joan Cusack), because his parents are military stationed in Germany. Diane is a bit removed from high school culture, as she isn't very social and has been taking college courses. She lives with her father, a man bursting with pride for his daughter but perhaps wound a little tightly. This was back when parents are sane, not controlling, which is a relief. And unconventional living arrangements were not disparaged or viewed as problematic.

""Say Anything"", like many of its contemporaries, is superior to more modern teen films in its characterizations and social outlook. Of course, that's not what makes it entertaining. That's what makes it tolerable, even for us middle-aged folk. Cameron Crowe took some inspiration from real people he knew and created good-natured, sympathetic and funny characters. John Cusack was 21 or 22 years old when he made this film, but at least he looked younger and put on a certain charming awkwardness. Ione Skye was the right age. The terrific supporting cast includes Lili Taylor and Joan Cusack. ""Say Anything"" is a pleasant trip back in time for those of us who remember the 1980s. It's a thoughtful and effective romantic comedy for anyone.

The DVD (20th Century Fox 2002): Bonus features include 5 Alternate Scenes, 10 Deleted Scenes, 13 Extended Scenes, 2 theatrical trailers, 8 TV spots, 7 b&w on-set photos from the director's collection, a featurette, and an audio commentary. The featurette (7 min) was made to promote the film in 1989 and includes some director and cast interviews. The audio commentary is by writer/director Cameron Crowe and actors John Cusack and Ione Skye. It seems to have been recorded for this release, so perhaps in 2001 or 2002. The commentary is introduced by a 21-minute discussion of how the film came to be made, its inspirations and genesis. In the scene-by-scene commentary, Crowe and the actors talk about characters, themes, and their recollections of filming. Subtitles for the film are available in English, Spanish. Dubbing available in French.",1286582400,2,3151,5.079150579150579

Diane has won a prized scholarship to study abroad, Lloyd is living with his older sister and nephew to make ends meet.  It is an odd match, Lloyd babbles when he is nervous, Diane is a quiet thinker,  but their romance is rewarding and realistic in an odd but charming way.

It was made in 1989 and the stars look young and attractive, with their smooth, flawless faces full of hope for the future.  Diane agrees to date Lloyd and finds out that all her studying has prevented her from knowing her classmates.

Really, the only charm and intelligence on display here appear in the eyes of John Cusack, who is nevertheless undone by the dopey script and bovine leading lady.

The chemistry between the leads is almost nonexistent, and their romance is paper-thin, even in this age of epic narcissism.

I would feel sorry that the worthy John Mahoney lowers himself to earn a paycheck here as the girl's father, but he went onto redeem himself for the ages as Frazier's dad.

I can only assume that the positive reviews here emanate mostly from young viewers who have never seen a classic romantic comedy like ""Bringing Up Baby"" or ""It Happened One Night"".

329431,5,6301412761,"One of the best teenage romance films of all time.

Like many teenagers and young adults, ""Say Anything..."" was the ultimate teen romance film when they first saw it back in 1989.  And for some people, within the last 20-years, the movie still left an impression on those who watched it.

The film received rave reviews from critics, the publication Entertainment Weekly voted the film as the ""Greatest Modern Movie Romance""  in 2002 and #11 in their ""Best High School Film"" movie list.

The film marked the debut of Cameron Crowe (""Jerry Maguire"", ""Almost Famous"", ""Vanilla Sky"") who wrote and directed the film.  The film included cinematographer L&aacute;szl&oacute; Kov&aacute;cs (""Easy Rider"", ""Miss Congeniality"", ""My Best Friend's Wedding"", ""Two Weeks Notice"") and music by composer Anne Dudley (""The Full Monty"", ""American History X"", ""The Crying Game"") and Richard Gibbs (""Battlestar Galactica"", ""10 Things I Hate About You"", ""Singles"").

""Say Anything..."" is about Lloyd Dobler (played by John Cusack, ""2012"", ""War, Inc."", ""Runaway Jury"", ""Sixteen Candles"", ""Better Off Dead"") who is a guy who wants to become a kickboxer.  A normal guy who happens to have a big crush on the valedictorian Diane Court (played by Ione Skye, """"Fever Pitch"", ""Wayne's World"", ""The Rachel Papers""). Dianne is a very intelligent young woman but has not really experienced a boyfriend let alone any teenage social outings.

For Diane, she has a lot of things going for her.  She won a fellowship to study in England and plans to go there at the end of the summer.  But when Lloyd builds the confidence to ask here for a date, she is surprised by it and intrigued by him, she agrees to it.

So, Lloyd who never had a serious relationship is ready to go out on his first date and he gets advice from his sister Constance (played by Joan Cusack, ""War, Inc."", ""Ice Princess"", ""Raising Helen"", ""The School of Rock"") and even his friend/musician (played by Lili Taylor, ""Public Enemies"", ""Six Feet Under"",  ""State of Mind"") who is depressed and constantly sings about her on and off again boyfriend and also getting advice from his other female friends and his male friends which include Mark (played by Jeremy Piven, ""Entourage"", ""Smokin' Aces"", ""The Kingdom"").

Needless to say, both Lloyd and Diane fall in love. But Diane's father Jim (played by John Mahoney, ""Frasier"", ""Dan in Real Life"", ""Primal Fear"") is very strict and wants her to  go to college, no distractions and to succeed.  He sees Lloyd as an underachiever and doesn't want him around his daughter.

Unknown to Diane, her father is doing shady things at the nursing home that he is in charge of and is under investigation by the IRS for tax evasion.

With her father in trouble, Diane feels that she should put her father first and thus the two breakup.  ""Say Anything..."" deals with two people who are in love but have their first major breakup and what one would do for the sake of love.

VIDEO & AUDIO:

""Say Anything... - 20th Anniversary Edition"" makes it debut in High Definition with a 1080p transfer that looks absolutely fantastic for a film that is 20-years-old.  I have complained in the past of how 80's and early 90's film tend to get the DNR (digital noise reduction) treatment and sometimes the picture quality appears to be waxy and unnatural but in this case, there is a good amount of detail in the film.  Compared to its DVD counterpart, you can see the clarity, the colors and also the nice deep blacks.  Grain is definitely present which is great and I didn't notice any major compression or edge enhancement.  This is the best I have seen of the film thus far.  So overall, picture quality is pretty solid.

As for the audio, the film receives a DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 (as well as English Dolby Surround Sound, Spanish and French mono).  The film is pretty much front and channel-driven.  There is no major sound effects as dialogue and music are what drives ""Say Anything..."".  In fact, when I first watched this film, what made the biggest impression on me was hearing the musical soundtrack as we hear the Red Hot Chili Peppers ""Taste the Pain"", Fishbone or even the popular Peter Gabriel song ""In Your Eyes"" with such clarity.  There could have been more surround usage but I didn't really notice anything via surround channels.  But for the most part, this is the best that the film has ever sounded up to now and dialogue and music can be heard clearly.

As for subtitles, the film is presented in English, Spanish, French, Cantonese and Mandarin.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

""Say Anything - 20th Anniversary Edition"" comes with the following special features:

  * To Know Say Anything...is to Love It! Trivia Track (over 200 questions) - A Blu-ray exclusive, during the film, one can watch ""Say Anything"" with a trivia track playing throughout the film.
  * An Iconic Film Revisited: Say Anything...20 Years Later featurette - (21:57) A Blu-ray exclusive featurette. An awesome featurette as Cameron Crowe, John Cusack, Ione Skye, John Mahoney, Nancy Wilson discuss the making of the film 20-years-later and why the film has been so popular even today.  Some interesting tidbits of the film, the boombox scene that may have never happened and the Peter Gabriel song that may have never happened and more.
  * A Conversation with Cameron Crowe featurette - (9:31) Cameron Crowe talks about the film and the characters and how Cameron Crowe became the director and learning from making his first film and challenges with the studio on the script and more.
  * I Love Say Anything...! - (7:31) Comedians and talent discuss what they love about ""Say Anything"" and their favorite scenes in the film.
  * Intro and Commentary by Cameron Crowe, John Cusack and Ione Skye - Featuring a 20-minute intro with director Cameron Crow, actor John Cusack and actress Ione Skye.  The first 20 minutes features the three talking about reuniting for the first time since the early 90's and how big the film was for them and for the audience and how Cameron Crowe got the idea to write the film and then how he became the director.  For the most part, the audio commentary is quite solid as we hear from the three about what went on behind-the-making of the film but for the most part, how real the chemistry was between John and Ione.  In fact, the two admit that while shooting the film, they had a spark but the fact is they had their own relationships with other people and Ione Skye is the first to say that if they weren't dating other people, the two probably would be dating each other.  Suffice to say, a pretty solid commentary.

JUDGMENT CALL:

1989.  I can easily remember when ""Say Anything..."" was released in theaters.  The whole concept of a guy going for the girl that he falls for and just the lasting memories from the film.  From the party, teaching his girlfriend to drive, the mixtape, the boombox... it was one of those film that just captivated me and as a teenager, I don't even know how many times I watched the film or listened to the movie soundtrack.

Having graduated from high school in 1989, for me at the time, the film was almost inspirational in some ways.  If you want to ask a girl that you really like for a date, just do it.  And sure enough I did and in the end, many years later... I married her.  So, ""Say Anything..."" was definitely a film that was inspirational for me and I'm sure it was inspirational for others.

I loved the film mainly for how natural the characters were.  I always felt that John Cusack and Ione Skye had tremendous chemistry and that they were phenomenal in the film.  Of course, it was revealed in original DVD commentary that the two were actually pretty close with each other during the making of this film and even brought up by Cameron Crowe during his Blu-ray special feature and we learn that from the commentary.

Cameron Crowe was able to create a film that captures the natural emotion of finding that first love.  John Cusack and Ione Skye did a fantastic job bringing that to the big screen.  For example, after the two make out in the car and to see the character Lloyd sweating and shivering and of course, the chemistry between both characters as the kiss doesn't look like some sort of Hollywood acting style of kiss, these two were literally making out on screen.  Those small details are emotions that are just well captured on film.  Love, happiness, pain, sadness, anger.  You name it...it's in this film.

The music was also fantastic.  I literally played out the cassette to the point where you can't really hear the music all that well.  From Living Colour's ""Cult of Personality"", Cheap Trick's ""You Want It"", Red Hot Chili Peppers ""Taste the Pain"", Peter Gabriel's ""In Your Eyes"", Depeche Mode's ""Stripped"", Fishbone's ""Skankin' to the Beat"".  So, it was cool to hear the audio for this film in the lossless audio soundtrack and of course the picture quality is absolutely beautiful.

Overall, ""Say Anything..."" is a film that I probably am quite biased towards but the fact that many print and online publications regard it as a classic film in such a highest regard, that tells you how special this film is.  And now the 20th Anniversary Edition is available on Blu-ray.  Highly recommended!",1257811200,75,10551,4.77317880794702
329432,5,6301412761,"I can't review the Blu-Ray since it hasn't been released yet, but this is the best film John Cusack has ever made.  This one is a very easy recommendation.  A must see film by Cameron Crowe.",1243814400,,190,4.25

329435,4,6301412761,"Cameron Crowe directed this little movie, and he has created a feminist statement. It is from the romantic comedy, subdivision teen, genre, but it is a story told from a female perspective. It is like a female fantasy, new age sensitive guy--but the problem is, in real life the girl would never go for the guy, even though in the fantasy movie they do, in real life, not so much. But if you can suspend your disbelief long enough, it is an entertaining little tale.

Lloyd Dobler (John Cusack) met Diane Court (Ione Skye) in a mall food court, but she is way out of his league. She has a fellowship and she is headed for the Ivy League. Lloyd Dobler has only feeble dreams of kick boxing glory, but though he is hopelessly outclassed, he goes for her anyway.

Her father, Jim Court (John Mahoney), presents Lloyd's main obstacle. Hey, it's Martin Crane, from the Frasier TV Show. His character here is much meaner than Marty Crane:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jim Court: You're not a permanent part of her life. You're a distraction.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

He is so protective of his daughter; you'd think he was jealous. He just wants the best for her, though. But what he does to get it, you don't want to know. That is the skeleton in his closet.

Lloyd is a post-modern, sensitive male. He even has female friends--chief among them Corey Flood. She and D.C. (Amy Brooks) offer moral support and advice:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Corey Flood: Diane Court doesn't go out with guys like you. She's a brain.
D.C.: Trapped in the body of a game-show hostess.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

But Corey has a few issues of her own. She has more baggage than a three-wheeled cart stuck on a Jet Blue tarmac. She has written 65 songs about Joe, her ex-boyfriend, and she carries a guitar to parties where she makes her friends listen to them all. In spite of their advice about the hopelessness of pursuing Diane Court Lloyd soldiers on. He is persistent, I'll give him that. And it pays off:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Corey Flood: Did you sleep with her?
Lloyd Dobler: I admit nothing.
D.C.: Lloyd, it's us.
Corey Flood: Look at his face. He did the deed.
D.C.: You're an inspiration, Lloyd. You should go on the 700 Club or something.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

They are not the only ones who are baffled by the headway Lloyd is making with Diane Court:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mike Cameron: I don't know you very well, you know, but I wanted to ask you - how'd you get Diane Court to go out with you?
Lloyd Dobler: I called her up.
Mike Cameron: But how come it worked? I mean, like, what are you?
Lloyd Dobler: I'm Lloyd Dobler.
Mike Cameron: This is great. This gives me hope. Thanks.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This story is boy-gets-girl, boy-loses-girl, so you know the boy just simply must get-girl-back. But not without a lot of pain and anguish on the boy's part:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
D.C.: Lloyd, why do you have to be like this?
Lloyd Dobler: 'Cause I'm a guy. I have pride.
Corey Flood: You're not a guy.
Lloyd Dobler: I am.
Corey Flood: No. The world is full of guys. Be a man. Don't be a guy.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Lloyd finally has his epiphany, and sets out after Diane with renewed purpose:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Lloyd Dobler: The rain on my car is a baptism, the new me, Ice Man, Power Lloyd, my assault on the world begins now.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In summary, this was a very solid effort by director Cameron Crowe. The young John Cusack totally carries the film, an unlikely but irrepressible leading man, a veritable force of nature. Ione Skye, the daughter of Scottish singer Donovan, has the rock star daughter looks of a Liv Tyler, but with brains, or she can at least pass for a valedictorian. She hits all the right notes, and looks smart doing it. Lili Taylor really stood out in her small part of female pal. And great laughs at the contrast when he hangs out with the guys. They give stupid advice, much worse than he gets from his female friends. My favorite character here is Mark (Jeremy Piven).

 --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Lloyd Dobler: I got a question. If you guys know so much about women, how come you're here at like the Gas 'n' Sip on a Saturday night completely alone drinking beers with no women anywhere?
Joe: By choice, man.
Mark: Yeah. By choice.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Lloyd might not know what he wants to do, other than hang out with Jim Court's daughter, but he knows what he doesn't want:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Lloyd Dobler: I don't want to sell anything, buy anything, or process anything as a career. I don't want to sell anything bought or processed, or buy anything sold or processed, or process anything sold, bought, or processed, or repair anything sold, bought, or processed. You know, as a career, I don't want to do that.

329466,3,6301412761,"People love this movie but Say Anything is the kind of teen film that fades with time. The soundtrack is the true winner but I felt kind of felt disappointed after watching this John Cusack flick. He is a great actor and so is Ione Skye who plays his love interest but I feel writer/director Cameron Crowe's writing is overrated, not sure why he gets so much attention. This film is good just not as tender-hearted as I thought it would be.",1212710400,,440,4.378048780487805
329467,4,6301412761,"I was actually surprised, after watching this film, of how mediocre it was. I guess my expectations were so high, as my older sister (born in the mid-70's) hails this as a classic. Don't get me wrong, I can very easily see  this film being a classic for her generation, but for someone out of that age bracket, someone like myself born in the mid-80's, this was simply an enjoyable film. Perhaps it just didn't carry the weight it did for her.

As far as the film direction is concerned, as an independent-minded film goer, I was quite surprised to see Cameron Crowe's concentration on dialog (as opposed to a certain stylistic appeal most independents go for). The dialog feels so real to me, less scripted, less ""this is a film your watching"". Cusak is superb, but very Cusak. John Mahoney's performance is also beyond excellent.

As for the storyline, I disagree with many claiming this to be a formulaic  romantic teen film. In fact I find its storyline to be extraordinarily unique, particularly given the nature of the father/daughter relationship and Cusak and Skye's character types, where Cusak was the popular guy at school who everyone seemed to love and Skye was the brainy/beautiful/mysterious girl, who everyone was always intrigued by but never seemed to do anything about it.

The bottom line is Crowe wrote a fantastic story and it worked well on the screen. For people like myself, who want to see this film for the first time in the 00's, get your expectations down a few levels and be prepared for a sweet feeling and generally good movie. For those interested, I plan on discussing/reviewing all of Crowe's films in the upcoming weeks as I watch them, so stay tuned.",1207872000,,1687,4.744027303754266

This is John Cusack at his earliest, clearly showing he will be BIG as he ages.  I bought this for my daughter and thoroughly enjoyed it and have now watched it several times!!  John is a good guy, rebel, hero and heart breaker in this movie (not specifically in this order).  If you are a Cusack fan, or if you wonder who he is, buy this movie.

329472,3,6301412761,"I'm not exactly sure what to make of it. Judged as a whole I would say I didn't really like it, but taken as individual scenes or moments, there's a lot to like.

I'll start with the negative first. One of the big reasons I didn't care for this movie is because it is another teenage romance that follows the typical boy-gets-girl, boy-loses-girl, boy-gets-girl again format. I hate that format. I'm not a huge romance fan in general, but I can live with ""the hero overcomes huge obstacles to get the girl at the end"" type story. But to have the hero win the girl's heart twice during the same movie seems needlessly repetitive to me. Whenever the hero gets the girl in the first half hour of the movie, you know you're in trouble, because there will be some manufactured crisis that doesn't make any sense that will cause them to split, and then there will be a lot of sappy emotions and fake crying, and then there will be another manufactured crisis at the end that will cause them to get back together again.

(At least this movie didn't follow the boy-gets-girl, boy-loses-girl, boy-gets-girl, boy-loses-girl-again, boy-gets-girl again, etc format. Like ""10 Things I hate about you"", which could have been a great movie if it would have just ended an hour and a half earlier than it did.)

Also I didn't really care much for the actress who plays the heroine of this movie. And I could have done without most of those father/daughter sappy scenes.

John Cusak however is great. He does a good job of playing up the friendly guy, but nervous talker who doesn't know when to shut up.

Also at points I thought his character in this movie reminded me of my old roommate. Which is why I think John Cusak is such a great actor. He does a great job of playing the everyman, and has a way of vaguely reminding you of somebody that you actually know from real life. And when you think about it, this quality is surprising rare in Hollywood actors. When was the last time Tom Cruise or Brad Pitt actually reminded you of someone you know?

Also the quirky humor in this movie is great if particular scenes can be isolated. Like the conversation about old people and the way their mouths move. Or the scene with the guys out in front of the drug store on a Saturday night. Or John Cusak as the awkward dinner guest. All of those scenes are enough to redeem this movie into the category of watchable and even re-watchable.",1185580800,8,2416,4.492027334851937
329473,4,6301412761,"This movie is a goodie too. For fans of John Cusack like myself, it's a touching story of a a father who doesn't really give his daughter much time to socialise. John Cusack's character is in love with her and wants to get to know her better, but her father has other ideas. Great music and even Eric Stolz makes a cameo in it too. Watch out for him in a scene wearing a bird suit. It's a soft version of the teenage angst, but still delightful to watch.",1185062400,,454,4.112359550561798

329496,4,6301412761,"Every time I watch Say Anything I love it a little bit more. I don't know what it is. The loner guy who aims a bit too high in hoping that the class valedictorian will be the one for him. The perfect girl who can only reveal her insecurities around the guy who no one can imagine her with. The daddy's girl who learns her father isn't as perfect as she always believed. All of which are elements of teen film that have been done to death, but there's something about Say Anything, maybe that it came before all those other played-out teen films that tried so hard to be like it. Maybe John Cusack and Ione Skye's innocent portrayals of young love. Whatever it is, this is a movie that only gets better with time. Even if you've already seen this movie, I'd highly suggest watching it again. Like a fine wine, this film only gets better with age.",1179014400,,845,4.2875
329497,5,6301412761,"I rented Say Anything from the library because I read all of the good ratings it received from both the people and critics. I could see why they felt the way they did about this film, it truly is a sweet story to watch. John Cusack plays a wonderful performance for the cool Lloyd Dobler as well as the beautiful Ione Skye as valedictorian Diane Court. It is a great experience about true love between two different high school graduates in the same class: one who is sophisticated yet trapped in her own world and the other remaining hopeful of becoming a kick boxer. Say Anything in my opinion, is Cameron Crowe's best film with Jerry Maguire coming in second, that is how good it is. It is a teen romantic comedy with a genuine heart and intelligence that I just had to buy the DVD. The John Hughes ""brat pack"" films are great, but Say Anything is one of the best you'll ever find.",1162944000,7,884,4.363636363636363
329498,5,6301412761,"Cameron Crowe's classic ""Say Anything"" is a terrific movie. Moving, hilarious, and it features one of the most famous scenes in movie history. Many people who have never seen the movie can identify the image of John Cusack holding that radio. I'm paraphrasing, but Crowe once said that he could never have made this movie without Cusack. I've never been a HUGE fan of John Cusack, but I can see what he meant. Cusack hits all the right notes for his character. Cusack plays Lloyd Dobler, a recent high school graduate who's in love with Diane Court (Ione Skye, 'Rivers Edge') a girl that's a little out of his league. She's a brainiac and beautiful and Lloyd's obsessed. After calling her and impressing her dad James (John Mahoney) he manages to get a date with her. Lloyd is a little nervous, talks really fast, and seems like an idiot at first glance; But there's something about him that attracts Diane. The two begin dating, as James gets investigated by the IRS

Problem is (and this sounds cliche, but it works in the film) Diane is going to Europe in a few weeks, so it becomes Lloyd's goal to spend as much time with her as possible. Although, his plan doesn't go exactly the way he expects. Lili Taylor co-stars as Lloyd's friend Corey, who's recently experienced a breakup and has written 63 (or 65) songs about her ex-boyfriend. She adds a couple funny moments. John's sister Joan Cusack also co-stars as his, well, sister. As I said, the movie is really funny. It might not appeal to everyone, a lot of the material was funny to me because I could relate to it so well. Crowe has always had a knack for dialogue. Not big theatrical dialogue, but that realistic dialogue. This a witty, incredibly entertaining movie (featured in Roger Ebert's ""The Great Movies II"") and it's not a film that should be missed.

I wasn't surprised by anything the characters did.  I loved the performance of John Mahoney as Diane's dad.  There are many touching scenes and awesome one-liners, but for me they didn't really connect together to make a masterpiece.  I found myself constantly wondering when it would be over, and surprised that it had only been about an hour and a half long.  A very good depiction of the 80's though.

After I have my Shatner ""Khaaan!"" moment, I can't help but wonder if this is what's wrong with the world. People not buying the ""Say Anything"" DVD should be prioritised right up there with finding an easy way to shell macadamia nuts. Maybe higher.

This DVD is chock-full of good stuff. A *meaningful* commentary with the Director and the film's two leads. Deleted scenes. Extended scenes. Alternate scenes. All with Cameron Crowe commentary. Subtitles. Commercials. Many of the extras may seem trivial, but one that most certainly is not is the commentary. Crowe reveals the germination and metamorphosis of the Lloyd Dobler character, his collaboration with Gracie Films/James L. Brooks, how Ione and Cusack came to be cast in their respective roles (Skye has a fun story about the Zappas tipping her off about Crowe and the audition), and all other kinds of relevant goodies. You get to see how things might've ended in alternate scenes..the resistance that Cusack first had to the infamous ""boombox"" scene (in my opinion, NOT the highlight of the films best merits). After listening to the commentary I now see how ""Say Anything"" is dripping of James L. Brooks. I hope that someday he and Crowe will join forces again to once again make a film of this calibre (sorry but I don't quite count ""Jerry Maguire"").

One day, when I sit down and think about it hard enough I hope I can write a proper full review that this film deserves. Until then, do yourself a favor and buy this DVD. Boyos, watch this one with your girlfriends!",1140480000,,1749,4.807308970099668
329538,5,6301412761,"Cameron Crowe (Almost Famous, Jerry Maguire) is one of Hollywood's prominent filmmakers. 1989's Say Anything... was Crowe's earliest hit movie and it still is the most beloved film by his fans.

Say Anything stars John Cusack (Identity), Ione Skye (Four Rooms), Lili Taylor (Dogfight), and John Mahoney (Tin Men).

It's a sweet romantic comedy about a popular high school nice guy Lloyd Dobbler, played remarkably by Cusack, who is madly in love with the most popular nice girl Diane Court, played by Skye. Dobbler takes her out, gives her driving lessons and his heart, helps her overcome a fear of flying, and they both fall in love. The one thing that gets in his way, however, is her protective and crooked father, played by Mahoney. As a result of her dad's insistence, she dumps him and gives him a pen for a present so he can write her. He becomes heart-broken and confides in his sister, played by real life sister Joan Cusack, and his friend, played by Taylor, and shows up in front of her house blasting her favorite song from his boom box, Peter Gabriel's outstanding song In Your Eyes.

Say Anything features some classic moments in motion picture history (Cusack carrying a boom box has become so popular that it is currently being spoofed in the recently released comedy Date Movie). But, what makes Say Anything a delightful movie is Crowe's fascinating and honest script.

329539,3,6301412761,"Watching Say Anything is kind of similar to watching Duel by Steven Spielberg: it's watching the movie before the real talent's dam burst. After making this and Singles, he followed it up with Jerry Maguire and Almost Famous, 2 of modern cinemas greater films. So we have his debut and you can see the talent, it's just not at high a level as it will be in later years.

Lloyd lives with his sister without a job but helping out his sister raise her son. He also has a huge crush on Diane, a very intelligent but socially ignored girl. So he decides to ask her out and they hit it off only they have to deal with a well-meaning but uptight dad and his problems with the law, and her leaving for England.

Usually the films he's done have these little moments that almost seem to either define the film or make it memorable. Witness ""show me the money"" from Jerry Maguire or Tiny Dancer from Almost Famous. Say Anything basically has the boombox scene. And in a way that's all it's got going for it. Casting is perfect of course and the dialogue's there but another cinema classic it ain't.

Like I said the casting is great though. John Cusack seems to be one of those effortless actors, where it's like he can play these characters without trying so hard to convince us. Witness Will Smith trying dramatic roles like Ali and Six Degrees of Separation even when we mainly know him as a rap star or the Fresh Prince. Ione Skye to me just screams ""80's"", especially with the hairdo. And Frasier Crane's future dad John Mahoney is perfect as the likable father but with restrained restrictiveness.

I don't know what it is about 80's films with the big hairdos and new wave soundtracks. Say Anything, unlike those 2 films, feels its time: it feels like it was made in the 80's. But that's ok, it's a good film but greatness is not quite there.",1139788800,2,1840,4.43491124260355

Cameron Crowe is one of the best writers and directors in the industry. This movie contains some of the best lines ever written for feature films.

Having said that, the DVD disappointed me.  The first thing I noticed when I started watching the DVD was how the screen jiggled and moved slightly, as if I were watching it in a movie theater from a film projector.  The color and sound are fine, and the deleted scenes and other extras are nice, but I think my VHS copy holds still more than the DVD version.

I watch all sorts of movies on DVD, and I don't remember any that shifted like this one did.  The studio apparantly didn't care enough to make sure each frame lines up with the next.

""Say Anything ..."" begins with Lloyd Dobler, a kind, well-liked underachiever who falls in love with Diane Court, a straight-A student who has just been accepted into a college in England.  Lloyd wins Diane's affections after he takes her to a late-night party - but winning the approval of her father is a completely different matter.

Cameron Crowe is certainly a talented filmmaker.  ""Say Anything ..."" was his directorial debut and third screenplay.  It's one of those special 80's teen romantic comedies that is even more magical today than it was back in '89.  As is typical with Cameron Crowe's films, ""Say Anything"" has a terrific soundtrack.  The film also has a sort of laid-back, observational style of directing, with mixes well with the intelligent, funny script.

The casting is superb.  John Cusack is - well, awesome as Lloyd Dobler.  Ione Skye does a fine job of showing the confliction that Diane feels.  And John Mahoney is perfect as Diane's loving, protective father.

The film has some great scenes.  The second ""In Your Eyes"" scene is definitely one of the movie's greatest and most famous moments.  Anyone who's seen the film will attest to the fact that it's a very memorable movie.  And it has a great ending too!

""Say Anything ..."" is a marvelous movie, and definitely one of my favorites.  It's well-written, -acted and -directed.  It's moving, dramatic, and very funny.  If you're searching for a sweet, well-made, romantic comedy, look no further than ""Say Anything ..."".

329596,5,6301412761,"cameron crowe's directorial debut is nothing short of sheer genius.  in the last five-ten years we've seen teen comedies/dramas (dramadies) take a decided down turn in quality, substance and heart.  it seems today's screenwriters resort to cheap sex jokes because it's sure to get a cheap laugh.  rarely do they tackle the pitfalls of teenage love and life in an honest, sincer, and most importantly, adult way.

i could write a ten page essay on the film's qualities. instead i'll make few points.

the writing. cameron crowe NAILS, and i mean NAILS, every scene.  there's not a bit of fluff.  everything the characters say and do is believable and original. we all know people like lloyd dabler, cory, joe, diane court, frank court, et. al. these are real people with real problems.  what i love about the film is cameron crowe shows us not only their good sides, but their bad sides.  crowe doesn't even spare lloyd dabler, underdog and hero to 'nice guys' everywhere, has character flaws. it would've been easy portray him the spotless, but he's not.  the dialogue itself is hilarious/touching/sad/happy and poignant.  as anyone who's seen the film will attest, there's at least 50-60 memorable lines in the movie ('i don't want buy anything sold or processed.' 'if you start out depressed, everything comes as a pleasant surprise.' 'i'm not going to find a girl like diane court at a kegger,' etc, etc, etc.)

the acting is equally superb.  as mentioned, each of these characters is believable. the great john mahoney is fabulous as frank court-diane's seemingly good father with a dirty secret. ione sky is perfect as the slighty goodie two-shoes (the scene where she looks up lloyd in the yearbook and grimaces is priceless) torn between her father/education/lloyd. but this is really john cusack's film.  whoever cast john cusack should have won a prize. he's perfect as the naively optimistic good-guy with the crush on the school's brain/beauty.  lloyd dabler/john cusack was and is the hero for the underdogs like me, the guys who sit on the sidelines, dreaming of asking the prettiest girl to dance, or take her on a date.

'say anything' is everything that's *right* with film. it amazes me how many people haven't seen this movie.  if you haven't, i can't recommend it enough.

here's hoping crowe's upcoming film, 'elizabethtown' is as good as 'say anything.' if so, he'll have another massive hit on his hands.",1125014400,,2426,4.933497536945813

SAY ANYTHING... is a true peice of life, a raw, candid and poignant look at first love. Cameron Crowe is, in short words, genious. He has this indescribable way of making simple things in life that we overlook so wonderful and beautiful. Watching his films are exciting and make me want to watch them again and again. His casting is pitch-perfect-John Cusack plays his role as if he was born to do it. He is my alll-time favorite actor and, if you've seen this movie, you'll see why. He has this way of expressing complete honesty on the screen that can break or melt your heart. Ione Skye, an actress I wish to see more of, is a heartbreaker. As Loyd and Diane, she and John have some of the best on-screen chemistry I've seen in a VERY long time-and I've seen a lot of movies. Many complained that she can be wooden, and that's understandable, but she's also fully capable of making you feel for this character and not making her a phony-you actually have sympathy for her. And I won't forget about John Mahoney-as Diane's overproctive father, he makes his character the most gentle hero and the most evil villian at the same time. He wants Diane to be honest with him, but he refuses to tell her of his own secrets. In the scene where Diane says, ""I found the money,"" the way that his facial expression changes-first expressionless, then shocked, then saddened, is a work of truly devestating art.

SAY ANYTHING... is, hands down, the best romantic comedy of all time-I dare you to top it. It is also my all-time favorite movie, even surpassing THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION. If you want to see a movie with wonderful dialogue, unforgettable acting, sweet chemistry and John Cusack with a boombox, buy-not rent-this movie.

A dorky but confident guy falls head over heels in love with the school's super brainy girl. Things happen, ups and downs ensue, all leading to an ending that is so satisfying, so overwhelmingly right, that immediately we fall back into step.
My minor grouse with the story was how conveniently the solid parental characterization of the girl's father turns out to be such a snake. One wonders if teenagers may not pick up from this the tired and rather sad message that parents are not to be trusted, no matter how sincere.
But that doesn't detract Say Anything from being a hot recommendation from me, particularly if you have a thing for lovey-dovey light dramas.

Her acting skills are limited however, so Cusak's antics move the story to the opposites-attract finale. John Mahoney, the dad in ""Frazer"" on TV, plays Ione's businessman, father in deep soup with the IRS. He wants her to go to England on a scholarship. She is wooed, charmed, and then makes it with shiftless Cusak. I must say that Mahoney is believable in a complicated character, both loving father and a secret embezzler. Ordinarily in these teen operas, parents are total dotes. There is the obligatory teen beer-bash, but this one is fairly realistic with kids that actually like each other, as opposed to bashes where kids are trying to be too cool.

329674,5,6301412761,"Cameron Crowe's debut film as a director is a joy to see.  Mr. Crowe has done exactly the same thing here, in 1989's ""Say Anything..."", as he did eleven years later, in his (IMO) masterpiece ""Almost Famous"".  And that is: to create a batch of realistic and, most importantly, likeable characters within the framework of his movie. It's nearly impossible, from this writer's point-of-view, to NOT like each and every one of the characters Cameron has crafted.  These characters ring ""true"", and seem like people everyone would want to have as friends.

""Say Anything"" is a pretty simple ""boy chasing girl"" story.  But what makes it special are the characterizations of the boy and the girl....plus the girl's proud-as-a-peacock father, played perfectly by John Mahoney, in what must certainly be one of the biggest (and best) roles of the actor's film career.

This entire cast is first-rate, right down to the quirky (but completely believable) ""best friend"", Corey, played nicely by Lili Taylor.  But for me, the standout even among this band of standouts is Ione Skye, who portrays Diane Court, the object of John Cusack's desire throughout the film.  I challenge any male of the species to not fall for Ione/Diane while watching this movie.

Director/Writer Crowe has struck a perfect balance with Ione's character .... She's smart -- very smart (she's just won a fellowship to a far-away European college).  But she never flaunts this in the film.  Ione's Diane is still accessible and ""real"".  Not at all snobbish or stand-offish.  I'm no filmmaker, but in my mind that balancing act with respect to Miss Skye's character was probably no small task...in either writing, or in acting it out.  And keep in mind that Ione was only 16 years old when the film was made in early to mid-1988 (it premiered in theaters on April 14, 1989).

This DVD presentation lives up to the movie contained therein: it's very good.  The anamorphic widescreen transfer is quite pleasing, and the extra bonus items aren't half bad either.  The producers of the DVD managed to secure the ""Big Three"" of Cameron Crowe, John Cusack, and Ione Skye for an audio commentary track.  We also get a short Making-Of featurette, several deleted/alternate scenes (which are uniquely presented to allow the viewer to see exactly where in the film they would have gone, if used), and some trailers and original TV ads.  Overall, a most-worthy Special Edition DVD.

Very good film.  Very nice DVD.  ....  And very sad I wasn't in Mr. Cusack's shoes during the making of this motion picture.  :)",1074816000,,2561,4.902325581395349
329675,5,6301412761,"This is such a good movie.  I wish I had discovered it sooner.  I had never seen any of John Cusack's movies until my oldest son (now 20) moved back from Missouri where people thought HE was Cusack.  Naturally, we had to watch some of his movies, and Say Anything is the best of the lot thus far.
Being an under-achiever who ended up with a Beautiful Brain (If I ever become a millionaire, I'll already have the trophy wife.) I felt a kinship to Lloyd as he had to work up the courage to call Diane to ask her out.  Where so many movies showcase characters that are two-dimensional, Say Anything has three-dimensional characters who behave in a way that most people really do.
As with most reviewers, I feel the most powerful scene was Lloyd with his boombox: One Final Act of Desperation.  It just about ripped out my heart the first time I saw it.  I bought the soundtrack just to get ""In Your Eyes.""
Yes, guys, this is ultimately a chick flick, but it has a subtle power that crosses over for anyone who has been dumped and wished for just one more chance.  I don't know if this will ever reach the status of a classic, but for me, Say Anything and Casablanca are two movies I will always associate with love lost, and then regained.",1070323200,,1236,4.324675324675325
329676,5,6301412761,"If you asked anyone who was the best director of the ""teen movie"" in the 80s, most people would say John Hughes, and they would be right.  Movies like the Breakfast Club and Sixteen Candles are classics and really capture the essence of being a teen in that decade.
But the answer to what the best teen movie in the 80s is has to be the 1989 Cameron Crowe directorial debut ""Say Anything"" starring John Cusack and Ione Skye.  This film gives us characters to really care about and situations that are realistic.  The actors respond beautifully, Cusack is perfect as the nerdy ""athlete"" (Kickboxing- the sport of the future) who simply decides to ask out school valedictorian/goddess Diane Court (Skye) right after graduation.  His conversations he has with himself while trying to get the nerve to ask her to a post graduation party are classic and sound real familiar to my high school years.
Skye (a relative unknown before this film and since) also turns in a flawless performance as the beautiful brain who has always wanted a taste of high school life, but has had to turn it down repeatedly to focus on grades.  She reluctantly agrees to go with Lloyd (Cusack) to the party and has the time of her life because for the first time, she is seen as just a high school girl and not the unreachable perfect standard.  We remember people like that in high school.  They probably had the exact feelings Skye shows us in Diane Court.
The plot really is not very intricate or complex.  Diane's father (John Mahoney) runs an old folks home and is very protective of his daughter.  It's obvious he has sacrificed a lot to give his daughter all the chance to go to England to study next semester.  Perhaps he has even done some things that were not all together ethical.  He does a great job with his character as well, especially at the end, when the situation spins out of control and he is forced to sit back and just watch.
Crowe's approach here is to give us real people as characters and let us identify with them.  Unlike so many of the teen movies today, which are unnecessarily raunchy and stupid, this film cares about the characters and what matters to them.  When Skye gives Cusack the pen mentioned in the title of this review, it is at a time where she is crushed emotionally and is almost manipulated into action.  Anyone who has felt the pain of love lost or the joy of love found will appreciate the reality of this film.  By the way, the most well known scene, pictured on the DVD cover, is Cusack holding up the boom box while Peter Gabriel's ""In your Eyes"" plays on the radio.  One of the best songs in the decade of the 80s, this one captures the mood of the entire film perfectly.  All in all, this is possibly the best teen movie of all time.",1069891200,3,2759,4.464143426294821

He met this really smart, brainy girl at the mall and he wants to ask her out. Everyone tells him it won't work between him and her since they are so different: she is beautiful, genius matierial, and rich...he is awkward with the ladies, doesn't like school, and poor. Yet, he asks her out anyway. The surprising (or not so suprising thing since its Johnny) is that she agrees to go to a party with him. That's when the magic starts. After he pushes the glass out of the way for her at the 711, her heart is gone. The only problem between the match is her mentally deranged, over protective father who treats her more like his possesion than his daughter. He doesn't want a boy, especially Lloyd influencing his daughter. He thinks Lloyd will bring her down, keep her from being ""all she can be."" Poor Diane Court must choose between satisfying and helping her father who's in trouble with IRS or being Lloyd's girlfriend.
There are many twists in this story, and the more you get to know all the characters the more they change for better or for worse in your eyes. The cast is incredible in this film...
Jim Court is played by John Mahoney (the dad off of Fraiser) and he does an excellent job of slowing breaking down throughout the film...a very calculated performance.
Joan Cusack plays John's sister (big stretch, I know;) and is amazing as always. She's funny, supportive and their onscreen chemistry is always a delight in all the movies they are in together...the first of their eight films together.
Lili Taylor (John's friend for a longtime in real life) plays Lloyd's good friend Corey Flood, a musician who plays angry songs about her ex, Joe and is the eptitome of a cool chick. The only thing I couldn't understand about this movie was why Lloyd didn't hook up with Corey...she's way cooler than Diane Court, and she was already his friend for a long time.
Oh well...Ione Skye did well as Diane Court, pretty without being distractingly pretty (I think she kind of looks like me, but I could be wrong) She makes you care about her and the main thing is her performance remains real, not a soap opera dramatic performance as seen in so many teen movies of today.
And John Cusack as Lloyd Dobler...what can I say. His optimistic outlook on the character was the spirit of the film. The brave thing about Lloyd is not that he's optimistic...its that he chooses to be so conciously since his life is anything but perfect. A perfect example of this attitude is seen in this quote from the movie:
Lloyd: Why can't you be in a good mood? How hard is it to decide to be in a good mood and be in a good mood once in a while?""
Plus, could the boombox scene when he tries to win back Diane be any more romantic or touching? *sigh* I still get butterflies everytime I hear ""In Your Eyes"" by Peter Gabriel. If you don't know what I'm talking about, check the movie out already!
The absolute best John Cusack movie ever...period. The first time I viewed this movie, I ran a gaunlet of emotions....laughter, crying, and sighing were the norm throughout the viewing of this film. If you haven't seen this film yet, don't rent it...buy it on DVD. Trust me, its worth it. John and his leading lady Ione Skye and Cameron Crowe, the director (You know, the director of Almost Famous and Jerry Maguire?) all give excellent commentary that is almost as entertaining as the film. And you all have to admit, you wish your boyfriends could be like Lloyd Dobler, come on....he is THE perfect boyfriend and no real men stand a chance against his charm and senstivity.",1063152000,2,3691,4.543543543543543

I finally gave in after seeing part of it while staying at a hotel while traveling, and fell in love with this movie.  I can now see why people call it a classic.
I won't regurgitate the plot, I think you can figure it out for yourself.  It's the classic ""boy meets girl"" sort of love story, except that the dialogue and situations are much more realistic than you find in most love stories produced by the Hollywood movie machine.  You really feel the yearning need that Lloyd Dobler (John Cusack, in a brilliant performance) and Diane Court (Ione Skye) have for each other.  The chemistry between these two actors is so great that you yearn yourself for these two to get together and live happily ever after.  This is no small trick to pull on a cynical moviegoer such as myself.
The DVD extras are fairly standard.  The deleted and extended scenes only prove how wise the editors were for cutting those scenes in the first place.  The featurette is helpful, but not necessary, and the commentary by Crowe, Cusack, and Skye is one big (moderately informative) love fest.  It was interesting to learn that Cusack and Skye probably would have hooked up, if either was single in real life at the time of filming, and to watch the famous scene where Lloyd serenades Diane with ""In Your Eyes"" playing on his boom box with the original music (some sort of dancehall reggae stuff).
Anyway, ""Say Anything..."" is a true classic, and couples should definitely make this a date movie.  The only danger will be if women start pestering their boyfriends to act more like Lloyd Dobler (aka:  The Sweetest Boyfriend on the Face of the Planet)!",1060905600,4,1785,4.685897435897436
329722,4,6301412761,"I finally got the chance to see Say Anything, Cameron Crowe's witty and funny teen comedy. It was obviously made during a time when teen comedies were about more than raunchy jokes and sex-related dialogue--it was about the romance, and the romance here is beautiful and poetic.
John Cusack plays Lloyd Dobler with such heart wrenching passion, it is difficult not to fall in love with him. The chemistry between Ione Skye and John Cusack is unmistakable and so genuine that it can't be ignored.
Cameron Crowe has excelled himself in capturing the feelings and moments that you can so easily identify with to make them just right, and seem so natural. This is a wonderfully written film-- with equally terrific acting--to remind us all of falling in love for the first time without all the hurt, mistrust and disbelief in oneself.
There is something old-fashioned and sweet about Say Anything. I think anybody could identify with the conflicts in it: first love, not fitting in, not knowing what to do with your life, etc. The subplot of Diane's dad's white collar crime also gives the film a good meaningful texture and adds complexity to characters who might seem stereotypical.

In my opinion, the most underrated aspect of this film is John Mahoney.  While Cusak and Skye were excellent and their on-screen chemistry can't be beat, Mahoney's portrayal of a father who'll do anything (including breaking the law) to aide his daughters success is pitch-perfect.
Crowe's directorial debut also plays well on his strengths.  The dialogue is crisp and witty.  The music is well chosen and makes it seem as though each musician wrote the song specifically for that scene even though some of the songs (like ""Back in the Saddle Again"") had been out for over a decade.  Crowe is also able to be cutsey (Lloyd's mullet-haired nephew) and still make even the most cynical viewer laugh.

329730,5,6301412761,"Many critics claim that Say Anything is the greatest love story ever told.  Maybe it was back in 1989, but having the benefit of seeing many many love stories in the 14 years since the movie was first released, I can't support that claim.  However, I will say that this is a tremendously good movie and a great love story, and I definitely enjoyed it.
This movie is about a good-intentioned and ambitious boy named Lloyd Dobler (played by John Cusack) and a bright girl with a promising future named Diane Court (Ione Skye).  Diane is the valedictorian of her high school class, and after graduation, Lloyd asks her to escort him to a party.  Diane leaves the part disappointed that she never really got to know any of the kids in her class, but happy to have met Lloyd.  They begin dating, much to the chagrin of Diane's father (John Mahoney).  However, her father loses leverage when the IRS comes knocking on his door and charges him with tax evasion.  This ordeal is very trying on Diane and her father, and though she continues to side with him, their relationship suffers as a result.  Her father convinces her that the best thing for her to do is to break up with Lloyd and go on to college with ""no strings attached"".  She reluctantly follows his advice, and Lloyd is heartbroken.  However, when Diane discovers that her father has been lying to her all along about his innocence in his financial ordeal, she realizes just how much she really needs Lloyd's support.  I won't give away the ending, but I will say that it's incredibly cute.
John Cusack does a great job in this movie.  He's great at playing the ""heartbroken boyfriend"" types of character, as he did in subsequent movies like ""High Fidelity"".  He's gone on to become a solid actor, but this movie will show you exactly where he got his start.  Ione Skye is also adorable in her role as the class nerd turned object-of-desire.  The reason why this movie is so loved is not as much for the plot as the chemistry between these two people.  The audience is made to believe that these two people really complement each other and belong together.  This is also Cameron Crowe's first attempt at directing.  He's gone on to direct several great movies like ""Jerry Maguire"", and he even won an Academy Award for the screenplay to ""Almost Famous"", but I believe this movie to be just as good as any of his other works.

Even though Ione Skye is kind of wooden (why on earth would someone as smart and funny and loving as John Cusack's Lloyd fall in love with such a statue?) she is still pretty and wistful. John Cusack is stunning- he's the boy I wanted all through high school and through a great deal of my adult life. There are several other notable performances- the father, played by the same man who did Frasier's dad (talk about a mind-bender;) the guidance couselor; the chorus of female friends.
Love is displayed in this movie in plenty of its forms, not only romantic but parental love, friendly love, sibling love. The movie is worth its weight in celluloid gold for its portrayal of the relationship between John and Joan Cusack as brother and sister and the parallel portrayal of father-daughter uncertainty.

After all, being a guy, a good love story is hard to come by, and I usually opt for the nearest explosion or car chase.
Boy was I wrong.
Quite simply, Cameron Crowe's ""Say Anything"" is the greatest love story ever told.
It is not epic in proportions, because the beauty of the film lies in the details: the optimistic quirks of Lloyd (John Cusack), the innocent yet knowing looks of Dianne (a beautiful Ione Skye), and the many, many sides to her father (John Mahoney, now seen on Frasier).
As typical of any Crowe film, the plot flows with the brilliant reality of the script. ""Say Anything"" is an actors movie; like ""Casablanca"" or ""As Good as It Gets"", ""Say Anything"" is more of a character study than an actual story, and Cusack and Skye work wonderfully in that position.
Lloyd Dobler is an optimistic, clean-cut Seattleite who's just graduated from high school. He doesn't want much in life, much less know what it actually is that he wants, but he is sure of one thing: he wants a date with the surreal, unattainable Dianne Court. He gets it. The story from there turns into a sort of modern day Romeo & Juliet, with many twists and turns that seem natural and will keep you interested in the characters. The plot never seems forced, the chemistry between Cusack and Skye is undeniably real, and the beauty of ""Say Anything"" is that not only will you fall in love with the beautiful relationship the two budding teens have formed, you will fall in love with the two of them. I long for Dobler's spontaneous appreciation for life and comfortable masculinity, and I still have a boyish crush for the beautiful, intelligent Court.
Love scenes are at once both real and passionate. Most importantly, I don't believe there is another film where any actor or actress has said ""I love you"" more sincerely than in ""Say Anything."" The looks are genuine, the humour is intriguing, and the camera shots are wide and majestic. The soundtrack is an impressive ode to the last stand of the 1980's and Peter Gabriel's ""Your Eyes"" is given a new life. Cameron Crowe may be talented for defining a generation with ""Almost Famous"" in 1997, but in 1989 he defined humanity at its greatest.
Don't miss scenes with Cusack's real life sister, Joan, who plays Dobler's older sister in the movie, as well as those with Dobler's nephew, a cute, mullet-haired boy who makes a fine air guitar and is always looking for some soul.
""Say Anything"" is a feel-good movie that strives to preserve chivalry, youth, and good old fashioned love. The performances are at once astounding as well as engaging; these people become a part of your life. The emerald skyline of Seattle provides a perfect backdrop for this living proof that there is someone out there for all of is, even if they're into kickboxing.",1038355200,6,2895,4.623300970873786

It's better than many of the 'romantic comedies' of the era, but most of those were miserable. Even the use of Peter Gabriel's ""In Your Eyes"" is a bit odd since the song came out three years before the film. I love John Cusack in other films and I liked him here. I liked Ione Skye as well. And at times the dialog just sparkled with inspiration. But other times I laughed out loud at the unintended humor of the dialog and acting (were ""beatboxing"" white guys cool or funny even in 1989!?). The film has its moments of greatness, but just wasn't terribly powerful for me. Afterwards I had that ""eh..."" sort of feeling that I get when I've spent a couple hours on a film and don't really get a payoff. The film shows promise, but ultimately falls into so many of the cliche traps of others similar to it. The story was so-so, I did enjoy the father's character immensely-what a great actor. I expected a few more laughs. I just feel very so-so about this film.  The disc contains a good amount of extras, but I didn't even care enough to watch them.

At the end of the date she feels very comfortable in Lloyd's company and they begin a friendship, which is getting more intimate with time.

329831,5,6301412761,"Why did it take me so long to see this movie, I have no idea.  I didn't even know that this movie existed until a couple of months ago.  I think John Cusack is an outstanding actor and I really enjoy all of his movies.  After reading all the rave reviews and seeing bits and bits of it on HBO, I decided to buy ""Say Anything"" and give it a shot.  I was really impressed with it, I have to admit.  ""Say Anything"" is a charming drama/comedy about first love and tough choices.  It also marks the debut of the very talented director, Cameron Crowe.
Cusack stars as Lloyd Dobler, an optimistic guy who doesn't know what to do in the future after graduating high school.  However, there is one thing that he does know; he's got a thing for Diane Court.  Diane is a beauty and a straight A student; definitely way out of Lloyd's league.  But that doesn't stop her from giving him a chance to take her out.  After that, they start to fall for each other, despite all of the obstacles that are thrown in their way.  One of those obstacles being Diane's over protective father who is currently having legal troubles with the FBI.  It is a touching film that consists of humor and drama.  We laugh and then we feel sad.  And we are not too certain of what's going to happen next until it's all said and done.
John Cusack is very powerful and outstanding in his role.  Finally, there's a film about a guy I can relate to!  I could relate to him so much that it was starting to scare me a little.  (Well, except for the kick-boxing.  Couldn't relate to that.)  But if he's able to get a catch like Diane Court, well maybe there's hope for me yet.  Speaking of Diane, Ione Skye does a great job in the film.  You can see why Lloyd would fall for a girl like that.  And John Mahoney needs to be mentioned for he does a terrific job portraying Diane's father.  He can be funny, cold, and caring.
Like I said earlier, this film marks the debut of the very talented Cameron Crowe.  Not only did he direct it, but he also wrote it as well.  I really admire how it was written because it seemed realistic and believable.  He took a different approach to a teen love story that is rarely seen in most films.  He adds just the right amount of humor as well as the right amount of drama.
The DVD is incredible.  It says ""Special Edition"" on the cover, and does it ever deserve that title.  The DVD comes with all sorts of extras including commentary by Director Cameron Crowe and Actors John Cusack and Ione Sky, numerous deleted, extended, and alternative scenes, a behind-the-scenes featurette, and theatrical trailers and TV spots.  The movie is presented in anamorphic widescreen (aspect ratio 1.85:1) and you have the choice of listening to the movie in English 5.1 Dolby Surround, English Dolby Surround, or French Stereo.  English and Spanish subtitles are also options as well.  The picture quality is crystal clear and the sound is really amazing, especially considering how old the movie is.
""Say Anything"" is a triumph on every front.  It's a film I know that I will watch over and over again.  If you want a film with humor and heart, this is the one for you.  I really enjoyed this film, and it surprised me so many times.  I'm glad I finally got around to seeing it.  Now I can finally knock that one off the list of millions and millions of movies I still have to see.  WOO-HOO!  But there's still so many on the list.  DOH!  Oh well, it's always good to have a goal, at least.",1034467200,2,3470,4.342679127725857

The movie is as sweetly complex as it ever was, and the three main characters are just terrific.  The special commentary by Cameron Crowe, John Cusack and Ione Skye is enlightening.  It's fun to hear them 13 years after making the movie.  They are still sincerely excited about what they created.  The deleted, extended and alternate scenes are worthwhile seeing.

At times, Say Anything is funny, sad, serious, realistic, and bittersweet.  Cameron Crowe did an excellent job making the main characters believeable and interesting, making it very easy to get caught up in their emotions. This movie brings tears to my eyes every time I see it as it is extremely easy to relate to Cusack's character, especially if you have ever gone through anything similar to the events that transpire between Lloyd and Diane. Everyone always talks about the famous scene involving the Boom Box, but to me the most memorable part of this movie can be narrowed down to one line: ""She Gave me a pen. I Gave her my heart and she gave me a pen"". I recommend this movie to absolutely everyone, if you can't relate to it right now, you will someday.",1031270400,,1034,4.572972972972973

I mean let's be honest, the ideas in them have been redone so many times.  But this movie successfully makes it's own way of doing things, and on top of that, makes a beautiful movie out of it.  The movie has two stories.  One about Lloyd(Cusack) and Diane(Skye).  About how they met and fell in love.  This is really the main plot.  But the secondary plot is almost just as good.  This is about Diane and her father(Mahoney).  About how sooner or later all kids grow up and make their own decisions, and how parents really will do whatever they feel they have to to make a good life for their children.",1028332800,,873,4.224242424242425
329835,4,6301412761,"Right off the bat, if you've seen this movie and love it - get the DVD.  It's one of the best DVDs I've seen, with deleted scenes, extensive audio commentary, trailers, etc. etc. etc.  The four-star rating is for the movie itself; the DVD gets a solid five stars.
""Say Anything"" is really two movies in one.  The 'main' story is of sensitive, would-be-underachiever Lloyd Dobler's (Cusack) pursuit of beautiful overachiever Diane Court (Skye) after graduating from High School together.  The story of how their relationship develops is quite realistic and the acting from Skye and Cusack is very subtle and effective.  The other storyline in this film is between Diane and her father, played incredibly by John Mahoney (from TV's ""Frasier"").  Having chose to live with her father after her parent's divorce, Diane is incredibly close with him and is her only real friend before she meets Lloyd.  However, her father's questionable business practices are called into question and her faith and trust in him are put on the line.  This part of the movie, in my opinion, is more interesting than the love story between Lloyd and Diane if only for how realistic and fresh it seems compared to the typical ""overbearing"" fathers of movies that involve teenagers.  John Mahoney really puts in a remarkable performance as the father.  If you're a fan of his work, or even only casually familar with him, this is a movie worth checking out.
When I mentioned ""Say Anything"" to someone recently, they were kind of uncertain as to why it had achieved the 'classic' status that it has.  Apart from being a very good movie, it really closed out the era of 80s teen comedies/dramas nicely.  Kids that were in high school in the 80s watching and laughing at everything from ""Fast Times at Ridgemont High"" to ""The Breakfast Club"" to ""Ferris Bueller's Day Off"", were growing up and entering a new decade.  Released in 1989, ""Say Anything"" reflected high school kids graduating and taking that next step towards the future, as well as dealing with serious everyday problems.  Its accuracy and tenderness in displaying this is what makes it so enduring.",1027382400,12,2132,4.869806094182826
329836,5,6301412761,"Ever wanted a person you knew would never give you a chance?  Ever had fate surprise you with that person's love?  The second part doesn't happen very often in tales of unrequited love, but it happened for Lloyd Dobler (played honestly by John Cusack).
""Say Anything"" is a universal story of love surviving the odds.  Lloyd struggles for smart, popular Diane Court's attention, and he gets lucky when he finally steps away from simply watching her and makes her laugh.  He is always himself, even when their relationship eventually hits rocky spots.  This is an admirable, human idea that is not often portrayed in romantic films.  Cusack helps us root for the main character by making him one of us.  While the other characters in the film question whether Lloyd is good enough for Diane (played by Ione Skye), the audience might wonder if Diane is good enough for Lloyd.
Another important theme from this movie that is worthy of mentioning is family trust.  In nearly every teenage drama, the teenager does things to irritate/upset/worry the parents.  The conflict between Diane and her father (Frasier's John Mahoney) is unique.  Mr. Court expresses displeasure at being ""betrayed"" by his daughter while at the same time he has been dishonest with her.  Both parents and children make mistakes.  Thank you Cameron Crowe for not making teenagers the scapegoats.
The most remarkable thing about this film is its simplicity.  There is the right amount of drama and romance so that it's not too schmaltzy and not too heavy.  It's just a clever little movie about love.
Pivotal scene (aside from the stereo in the front yard):  when Lloyd and Diane are trying to get back together.  Diane admits, ""I need you.""  Lloyd asks, ""Do you say that because you need somebody or you need me?""  He quickly adds, ""Forget it.  I don't care.""",1027123200,2,1827,4.835483870967742

That said, this film is as good as it gets in the genre-- John Cusack is at his quirky-intense-nice guy best; neat cameos by Eric Stoltz, Jeremy Piven, and Bebe Neuwirth give little boosts along the way; and the list of memorable lines (""YOU MUST CHILL!""; ""That'll NEVER be me, that'll NEVER be me, that'll NEVER be, NEVER be...don't you THINK it!"" and the rest of ""Joe Lies""; ""You've heard of kickboxing, the sport of the future?"";""I gave her my heart,she gave me a pen"") and scenes (the asking-out phone call,the party,the guys at the mini-mart, the phone booth,etc.) goes on and on. The writing rings true consistently, and the audience genuinely cares about who these characters are and what happens to them. I earlier mentioned John Mahoney as a stand-out performance; add to that Lili Taylor, who is funny and achingly truthful at the same time. Obviously, ""In Your Eyes"" on the boombox at dusk is the showpiece; check out the extras for other takes and Cameron Crowe's story on the tortured journey the scene took before it became a classic scene of modern romance.

329839,5,6301412761,"SAY ANYTHING
Long before he wowed audiences with ""Vanilla Sky"" or stole the hearts of moviegoers with ""Jerry Maguire"", Cameron Crowe left his mark on Gen X'ers with this early effort. On the heels of countless John Hughes films, Crowe's romantic comedy was a coming of age for X'ers weaned on ""Pretty In Pink"" and looking for one last teen fairy tale before graduating to the reality of grown up life. Crowe nabbed John Cusack to play Lloyd Dobbler, the loveable lead in his grown up teen romance. Poised on the verge of adulthood, and unsure what life holds, Lloyd takes his shot at greatness by asking out the girl of his dreams, Dianne Court. (Ione Skye)
This odd pair seem mismatched for reasons that go beyond the usual high school cliques. That these two characters are from vastly different worlds is brilliantly demonstrated by their respective families. Lloyd lives with his single mom older sister (Joan Cusack) and drifts aimlessly through life as the eternal optimist, looking for a ""dare to be great"" situation. Diane's life is much more structured and planned out in great deal by her doting single father. (John Mahoney in pre-Frasier days.) With everything she ever wanted, Dianne realizes that she has missed out on the kind of friendships that drive Lloyd's life.
Their unlikely romance gets off to the expected shaky start, but Cusack's machine gun delivery of Crowe's razor sharp dialog win her over. It seems impossible for Dianne to resist his charm and completely believable that she would fall for him. She struggles to keep her life in order and keep him at a distance, but eventually lets him in. This movie features one of the most memorable song placements of the era, with Peter Gabriel's ""In Your Eyes"" playing at their most intimate moment and again later in a heart tugging scene outside Diane's window. (Admit it, how many guys have repeated this scene in the vain hope it might just win her back?)
As her new romance grows, Dianne has to watch as her father's world comes crumbling around them both. Torn between the two important relationships in her life and facing the culmination of her dreams, Dianne struggles with choices. Crowe writes one of the best and most realistic break up scenes ever captured on film. Who can forget the post break up line ""I gave her my heart and she gave me a pen."" From here the movie could easily have fallen into the trap that so many other teen love stories do, but Crowe uses the strong side characters to give the film an uncommon depth and genuine emotion.
With brilliant performances from Cusack, Skye and Mahoney, Crowe's dialog flows easily and gives ""Say Anything"" a beautiful realism from start to finish.
Included on this DVD are a number of bonus features including a running commentary by Crowe, Skye & Cusack. There are five alternate scenes that don't show much. The deleted scenes offer a lot more though, including a lengthy monologue by Mahoney about the quality of care for the elderly.

329882,5,6301412761,"This review will only talk about the features included on this DVD edition.
---
""Say Anything..."" is one of my favourite films, and this new DVD, put lovingly together by the passionate Cameron Crowe, more than does the film justice.
John Cusack (Lloyd Dobler), Ione Skye (Diane Court) and Camerone Crowe's (writer/director) commentary track acts as part reunion, part love fest, and part thoughtful discussion on a film they're all obviously proud to have been a part of.  Crowe, as writer/directors are won't to do, takes the lead.  The track begins with twenty minutes of reminiscences, before the movie even begins.  When it finally does begin (I say finally, but really what preceded this was most welcome), Crowe effectively introduces scenes, relays their overall importance and their genesis, while always sharing the credit.  At times I wondered why Cusack didn't get a screenplay credit, for all the times Crowe mentioned a line, or even just a word, that John came up with to help crystallize the character.  Crowe's other strength is in allowing his co-commentators opportunities to shine, to give their side of the story.  He draws on his experience as an ex-rock critic here, to great effect.
Cusack, to his credit, is open and honest about his misgivings about doing the movie.  He didn't want to do another teen movie.  But in hearing him tell about how his relationship with Crowe and the script deepened, he couldn't possibly turn the film down.  Lloyd, a character women love and men want to be, was built out of an intense collaboration between these two men.  They agreed on many thematic notions, such as the whole ""optimism as a revolutionary act"" worldview, spitballed new ideas, and allowed a nice middle ground between Lloyd's lighter and darker elements to prevail.  Cusack is intelligent and intense here, without ever being pedantic.
Ione Skye, who often times gets criticized for her work in the movie (which makes a story she tells, about getting booed by a crowd of Down's patients in the nursing home the film was shot at, all the more poignant), is an easygoing revelation.  She is unabashed in her love for the movie, her love for the script, her admiration of Crowe, and her schoolgirl crush on Cusack (which he reciprocates).  It is this last point that makes me wonder if she deserves the criticism after all.  The chemistry between these two is palpable, even to the actors on set.  On more than one occasion Skye notes that the scene falls away, and she really believes that she is Diane and Cusack is Lloyd, and that they are in love.  Cusack agrees, and that's more than enough proof for me to redeem Skye's work here.
Besides the commentary track, Crowe, a newly discovered DVD aficionado, revels in the medium's ability to present alternate, deleted, and extended scenes.  He is generous with all three, warts and all.
The alternate scenes (11 minutes worth) for the most par, present versions that are obviously substandard to those perfect gems that appear in the movie proper.  The phone booth scene and the post nose-breaking scene were all re-thought, re-shot, and done much better.  Most tellingly, there are 5 versions of the boombox scene.  In the two takes in Diane's bedroom, we hear an angry Elvis Costello song.  In the three with Lloyd down below, it's a bouncy Fishbone number.  This further illustrates Crowe's luck in finding Peter Gabriel's achingly perfect ""In Your Eyes"".  In the Lloyd takes, Cusack experiments with standing and sitting positions, to try and gain the best tone for the scene.  Mostly, he comes across as much angrier and more hurt than in the real scene.
The deleted scenes (13 minutes worth) are mainly short snippets, showing us information already covered better elsewhere.  They're mostly clumsy and superfluous.  Exceptions include a creepy scene where Diane must fend off the advances of one of her teachers at the party, Jim Court testifying before city council about the need for more personal nursing care like he provides, and several scenes of Detective Sims interacting with the old people at the nursing home that want to be heavy but come across rather comic, due to the amateurness of the actors involved.
The extended scenes (24 minutes worth) are uncomfortable to watch.  They have no music, and periodically jump back and forth between black and white and colour.  They mainly exist to show Crowe's prudence in editing.
Also included on this DVD are Crowe's on set photo gallery, some TV spots and trailers, and a quick featurette from 1989.  This last bit is distinguished by Crowe's quick summation of Cusack's character: ""Lloyd is a warrior for optimism"".  It's a perfect summation, for both the character and the movie.",1024012800,5,4722,4.932996207332491
329883,5,6301412761,"...you can't deny the fact that ""Say Anything..."" is a truly exceptional film. Now, I know that stereotypical macho guys wouldn't want to watch any romantic movie at all (I don't count as a ""macho guy"" because I love James Taylor, I hate sports and my favorite movie is ""Forrest Gump""; take what you want from that)(For you sportsfans, the protaganist is an avid kickboxer). However, this movie is much more likable then the standard romantic fare for many reasons.
The best and most poignant thing about this movie is that it rings true. Cameron Crowe has fashioned a script that is full of memorable lines ranging from the funny (""If you guys know so much about women, why are you sitting at, like, a gas'n'sip at 4 A.M. with no women anywhere?"" <beat> ""By choice, man."") to the poignant (""Are you here because you need someone, or because you need me?...Forget it, I don't care"") to the truly unforgettable. (""I gave her my heart, she gave me a pen."")
However, at the center of the film is the amazing, unflappable, John Cusack. His Lloyd Dobbler is one of the most identifiable characters in contemporary cinema. He's at his best in his many stuttering, tragic monologues, his flow of consciousness tape recordings detailing his heartache, and especially in his ""eighth and final call"" to Diane: ""Maybe I don't know you, maybe you were a mirage, maybe the world exploded in a supernova of food and sex and in that case it's not your fault"". What does that mean? Nothing. And yet everything.
Finally: the supporting characters. There's nothing wrong with Ione Skye and John Mahoney; but they get all the press. We're talking Lili Taylor. ""Joe lies, Joe lies when he cries"": the passion Corey exudes over Joe, and the anguish she goes through, knowing he's so much beneath him, yet she reluctantly loves him anyway. We're talking Joan Cusack. Constance definitely needed more screen time; she was a fun character to watch, as all of Joan's characters are. In fact, all of the people who had any line at all, up to and including the guy who passes through and say's ""Lloyd Dobler, all right!"" to Diane at the party, are all perfect, just a testament to Crowe's directing abilities.
If none of that does it for you ask yourself this: what could possibly be cuter than: a five-year-old punching a punching bag while being held in the airby his 19-year-old uncle (i.e. Lloyd), who asks ""What do we want?""; his response: ""Pain!"" I put it to you, and e-mail me if you get something better.",1023926400,2,2485,4.688787185354691
329884,5,6301412761,"I've got 1000 chance to write ""Perfect""
  This movie is, in almost every sense.  Cameron Crowe captures that earnestness we all felt in our first love.  How the highs were sub-orbital and the lows had a physical presence that hung from our shoulders like chains.  See this movie to remember how a young man gets a girl back before it was considered stalking.  This movie will be dated soon because of the indefatiguable belief in true love it's leading man possesses.
  Sadly, those of us who remember the elation and the poison of Cupids arrow will find ourselves in a diminishing audience of romantics.  This movie is romance, it is heartbreak, and it is what we all wanted to happen with our first love.
  Supporting cast, editing, writing, it's all there.  I dare you to find fault with the simple honest storytelling that is more a trip down memory lane than a trip to the DVD machine.

All the supporting characters are great, from Diane's misguided but loving Dad to all the various teenagers screaming at one another at the party.  Lloyd Dobbler's friends are perfect, especially Lili Taylor as the talented Cory, obsessed with her cheating boyfrient to the point where she's written 63 songs about him.  She is the perfect confidente, giving out good advice and loony theories in the same breath.  Another standout in a small part is Joan Cusack, who's always great in anything, but brings a lot of depth to the character of Lloyd's single mom sister.  Her chemisty with her brother is unforced; affectionate but not sappy.  All the tiny parts are equally good, from the lady who works in the luggage store, to the two lawyers making deals with each other.
But all this wouldn't work if the two leads weren't good too.

I bet most guys can relate to his character's inner and outer workings of pursuing the love interest.  Miss Skye was perfect for being a beauty but not too perfect physically to seem too unreal.  If there ever was an intriguing father-daughter encounter, you'd find it in this movie when Miss Skye told her dad (Mr. Mahoney) about her first sexual encounter.
Just one question to Mr. Crowe: how would you envision the transformation of Lloyd and Diane's relationship, as they grow older in age and more developed in personality?  How the genuine love between these two withstands the test of time and changing environment/mindset?  It'd take a certain maturity from Diane to support and respect a 'slacker' like Lloyd who doesn't 'fit in' her path.  It'd take a great deal of courage for Lloyd to pursue what he believes (in kickboxing) and in the same time accepts Diane's intelligence and possible career success without loosing his own self-esteem.

With the new DVD out, a new generation can enjoy the movie.  The features are outstanding!  There are deleted, extended, and alternate scenes for the true Say Anything fan and plenty of trailers and tv spots to choose from.  But most enjoyable was the reunion of Cameron Crowe, John Cusack, and Ione Skye, together again for the first time to record the voice over for the commentary of the movie.

329934,5,6301412761,"This is quite simply my favorite movie about teenagers. What sets it apart from the rest of the pack is the fact that it's realistic and doesn't rely on horny teenagers a la ""Porky's"" to get laughs. This is a true, genuine film about kids in love.
The brilliant John Cusack stars as Lloyd Dobler, who asks out the class brain, Diane Court (played by Ione Skye) the day after graduation. A unique relationship begins, complicated by Diane's overprotective father, her impending move to England and Lloyd's general lack of direction. It's hilarious and moving at the same time.
There's a reason why this has become a cult classic. There are so many great moments. Lloyd's friend Cory singing all her songs about Joe; Lloyd's speech about kick boxing; Joe badly singing a Whitney Houston song at the graduation ceremony; Lloyd's meeting with the guys at the Gas'n'Sip; Lloyd's first ""photo op"" with Diane; and so on. Those of you who think crap like ""She's All That"" constitutes an honest, funny movie about high school...think again. This is the real deal.
The DVD is worth the wait...there's wonderful audio commentary from Cameron Crowe, John Cusack and Ione Skye; featurettes, deleted scenes, extended scenes and much more. If you're a fan of this movie or are discovering it for the first time, check it out. If you love the work of director Cameron Crowe or anything John Cusack has ever starred in, check it out.

329935,5,6301412761,"Cameron Crowe had written two screenplays, the brilliant Fast Times At Ridgemont High and the uneven, but enjoyable The Wild Life, but Say Anything marked his debut behind the camera.  The movie centers around the unlikely relationship between the brainy, but beautiful Diane (Ione Skye) and the goofy, but loyal Lloyd (John Cusack).  Diane is a brain who has gotten a scholarship to attend school in England, while Lloyd is entering the sport of the future, kickboxing.  Diane lives a sheltered life, spending most of her time with her father (a pre-Fraiser John Mahoney) and Lloyd is her chance to experience life outside the bubble.  Of course Mr. Court disapproves of their relationship, but he has bigger problems awaiting.  Ms. Skye and Mr. Cusack are absolutely terrific together and their is real chemistry between them.  Mr. Cusack in particular shines in the film.  He is extremely funny , but shows a real human side.  You really feel for him when Diane breaks off the relationship with him.  Mr. Crowe, as usual, has written a sharp, witty and inciteful script and he uses music to perfection.  Peter Gabriel's ""In Your Eyes"" perfectly captures the films signature moment when Lloyd stands heartbroken outside Mr. Court's nursing home with a boom box blaring the song to Diane inside.  On the surface, Say Anything looks to be another 80's teen movie, but dig a little deeper and you'll find one of the better crafted films of the decade.",1017273600,7,1450,4.901639344262295

Well, on that whim, i bought a bunch of DVD's that day. i usually only buy ""keeper's"" on DVD, something i can watch over and over. Some of the movies i hadn't seen in over a decade, but they were equally good now, bringing the pleasant memories of the careless days. Except for Say Anything. All the other movies i bought that day ended up being  great choices - ...i don't really know why this movie would be in top 50.

329937,5,6301412761,"This unheralded 1989 teenage romance did little business at the box office, but is now seen in retrospect as one of the eighties' best films.  The key is John Cusack's pitch perfect performance as Lloyd Dobler, a teenager who falls in love in the summer after senior year in high school and doesn't know what he wants to do with his life except take care of Diane, the wonderful young woman he's fallen in love with.  But the rest of the cast is equally up to the task, with Ione Skye, Lili Taylor, John Mahoney, Joan Cusack and the young Glenn Walker Harris Jr. all contributing to a movie filled with great characters and great moments.  Cameron Crowe's script is full of unforgettable dialogue, and the soundtrack is equally memorable.
The DVD edition finally gives this movie the fine treatment it deserves.  The laserdisc edition, which I have watched repeatedly over the last decade, is easily surpassed by a wide margin.",1016928000,6,927,4.739130434782608

Ione Skye as the woman I wanted to be is luminous-- she literally seems to glow.  And what does he love about her?  How Smart She Is!!

HOWEVER...John Cusack's best role will always be that of Walter Gibson in ""The Sure Thing"".... which needs to be released on DVD IMMEDIATELY.
""Say Anything"" is a different film than ""The Sure Thing.""  It is in a class all by itself. It is quite simply marvelous, poignant and forever endearing. It deserves so much more than 5 starts! 10 stars for this beautiful film.
What can be said about this film that hasn't already been said? It is the perfect love story. Lloyd meets girl. Lloyd falls in love with girl. Girl's father objects to Lloyd. Lloyd loses girl. Lloyd wins her back. True love reigns.
This DVD is PACKED. Worth every cent you will pay should you wish to own a classic gem. There is commentary by director Cameron Crowe, John Cusack, & Ione Skye!! (Right there, worth the price!) There are so many behind the scenes stories and anecdotes to be listened to here. There are theatrical and television trailers, 10 deleted scenes, 13 extended scenes & 5 alternate scenes with commentary!! What more could you want?!
DO NOT miss out on owning this DVD. If you've by some chance never seen ""Say Anything"" do yourself a favor and do so right away! You're truly missing out.
SPOILER FOR THOSE WHO MAY NOT HAVE SEEN IT.... No matter how many times I have seen this masterpiece, I still get choked up when Lloyd tells Diane, ""You've just described every success story."" And then we wait for the ""ding"" along with them.

329971,5,6301412761,"I've been waiting for a Special Edition DVD of Say Anything for a long time.  I'd been hoping for a commentary track by Cameron Crowe -- but I was extremely excited to learn that the commentary track featured John Cusack, Ione Skye and Cameron Crowe.  There are also some deleted scenes, extended scenes and alternate scenes.
It's a great 80's movie with an excellent cast.  John Cusack is great as Lloyd, a recent high school graduate with no definite plans for his future.  He falls in love with Diane (Ione Skye) who is the stereotypical vision of perfection.  She is intelligent, financially stable and beautiful.  These two types bring out the best in each other as they fall in love and eventually come to conflict... and back into love at the movie's end.  This is one of my favorite performances by Cusack.  The amazing honesty and purity of Lloyd is wonderful and easy to identify with.
It's a great DVD.  The extra and extended scenes are interesting and while it's pretty obvious why many were left out, some of them would have flushed out the character of Diane's father (John Mahoney) a little better -- but would have also cluttered the movie.
The commentary is in some ways pretty standard.  Commentary tracks seem to be either really negative (""Oh man, I can't believe we did this like that!"" ""Remember that guy?  He's so lame!"") or extremely congratulatory (""Oh you were wonderful here..."" ""Oh no, it was YOU who was wonderful!"").  This commentary track falls into the latter category.  While this sometimes gets kind of annoying, there's very interesting dialogue between these three main players and some of the underlying storyline elements that I'd missed suddenly became clear.  There are also some fun little bits of information revealed as well.
Overall, it's one of my favorite movies and the DVD does not disappoint.  Highly recommended.",1016064000,,1863,4.888535031847134

With that said, this DVD will blow you away.  The movie seems to be ""re-born"" with the clarity of DVD, but then that is what you expect.  What you don't expect is over 20 deleted, extended, and alternate scenes.  Just an amazing amount of ""extra"" scenes, especially for a movie so old.  Usually the scenes on the cutting room floor are swept up and tossed.  At least they were 10 years ago.  The extend scenes are a must see.

329973,5,6301412761,"My wife and I saw this film when it was first released. We saw it once. That was enough to make me want it on DVD. While the details were hazy for my wife (I think that's a gift sometimes since after a while things still seem new to her) I remembered almost everything about the film, it's story and characters, after all these years. John Cusack and Joan Cusack as acting brother and sister was a nice touch. Ione Skye as Diane had such a warmth and sincerity as she tried to mix with Loyd and his world while drawing him into hers that you knew these two had to be a match from the start. John has had an arresting every man quality in his film career. As Loyd, despite the age and difference in experiences, I saw a kindered spirit (I know, why bother with this overused ""revelation"", but this really was odd, because everybody wants to relate to characters they like but in this case I had no choice). I started my adult life a lot like Loyd was starting his, albeit 10 years before the film. Art imitating life became a real concept. Needless to say that was quite a hook. Sorry for the digression into my life. Anyway take those similarities (pathetic as that may come off) and couple that with insights about young adults which are really timeless and acting that never feels like acting, and this resulting film had me. I can't help but think that every generation needs a story like this one. Timeless as it is at it's heart, people too often need something that is easy for them to relate to. Window dressing is all it takes to draw in the crowd to get the same truths. Cameron Crowe has delivered a teen film that is not a teen film. I hope the young audience today will find this as easy to watch as I did with 10 years out but still related to this story. I like the extras. They don't add anything to the story but they are fun to see. I'm particularly surprised to hear the music that was used in the Boom Box scene outtakes. It was good music but it seemed out of place with the scene. I'm glad they went with the one used in the film.",1015891200,,2051,4.208121827411167

It's not a complicated film but for anyone who was a misfit in HS like I was then you'll probably enjoy this film a great deal. And who hasn't had daydreams that they and their HS sweetheart would stay together forever and ever?",1015804800,,460,4.179775280898877
329975,5,6301412761,"I can only say to be sure that many, many people born between about 1965-1977 probably either highly identify with Lloyd Dobbler (John Cusack's watermark character from this film), or have wished they could meet someone like him. The appeal of this film makes it one of a very rare breed of teen movie - the kind that last.
This DVD edition gives you great insight into both the original concept and the making of the film. You learn for example that Cusack wasn't keen on what turned out to be one of the most identifiable scenes in 80's film, and that Crowe almost wasn't able to snag Peter Gabriel's In Your Eyes due to a bit of a mix-up.
Many times watching deleted scenes on DVDs only serves to make you realize how necessary the deletions were in the first place. In this case, though, the deleted scenes give you an insight into the film that might've been. I don't want to give too much away, but mainly I'll say that the depth added to Mr. Court (John Mahoney as Ione Skye's father) really helps to understand what eventually happens to him.
Being a DVD freak and a huge fan of this movie, I strongly recommend this edition.",1015718400,3,1133,4.425837320574162
329976,5,6301412761,"Say Anything is, in my opinion, the shining film in Cusack's incredible career. Funny, charming, and original, Cameron Crowe wrote and directed a ""teen"" movie that appeals to any generation without using any of the typical ""adolescent"" flair. No cheesy humor, no stereotypical characters, and certainly no cookie-cutter plot. What we see is an emotional masterpiece: Lloyd Dobler, a nervous but charming 18-year-old, and Diane Court, the beautiful valedictorian. Portrayed by Cusack and Skye, their on-screen chemistry convinces you of their true desire and love for one another.
The DVD is PACKED with extra goods: ten deleted scenes, thirteen extended scenes, and five alternate scenes. The extended scenes even change between color and black & white so you can tell what's new, and what's in the movie. Not to mention two full length trailers, eight TV spots, and of course the best of all, the commentary!

329977,5,6301412761,"I first saw this film at the movies when I was in my late 20s. It reminded me so much of my own summer after HS graduation, I went back to the theater to see it the very next day (dragging 2 friends along)!

The script and direction are perfect, and this was deservedly Cusack's breakout role.  This movie rises miles above the typical ""teen flick"" to deliver rich, three dimensional characters who are funny and heartbreaking at the same time.

Besides Cusack, the standout performance in this film belongs to Lili Taylor. Any female who suffered through the pangs of teenage first love can relate to her hilarious, endlessly morose songs about Joe.

Lloyd Dobler is the guy that every girl wishes she had met when she was 17.  Ione Skye is appropriate beautiful, but her performance seemed a little wooden to me. I also was less than thrilled with John Mahoney's portrayal of the father - a little too broad and two dimensional, I would have liked to see a more subtle actor in this part.  (Harry Dean Stanton's performance as the dad in ""Pretty in Pink"" comes to mind)

But those are minor complaints.  Cusack's performance and Crowe's vision are a combination for the ages.  Even all these years later, the film is not dated, and I still love it. I'm so glad it's finally on DVD and can't wait to check out the ""extras.""",1014595200,,1324,4.529411764705882
329978,5,6301412761,"By focusing on the realities of growing up, being accountable for your actions, and the depth of trust and faith it takes to even attempt to make love work, Cameron Crowe fashioned a near masterpiece of dramatic comedy.
When the class drifter (John Cusack) dares to date the seemingly ultra-focused class valedictorian (Ione Skye) it seems a predetermined disaster.  But it isn't, the two find that their wavelengths aren't that different at all, and romance blooms.  Too bad the girl's father (the excellent John Mahoney) thinks that it would be better if his girl dumped this 'distraction' before it ruins her life.
By remaining true to his characters, writer/director Cameron Crowe builds a story that is both conventional and unconventional, honest yet optomistic.  Thus he creates a contemporary love story that is an essential in a romance lover's collection.",1013558400,,865,5.2086330935251794
329979,5,6301412761,"Unfortunately, the term ""true love"" has, through excessive usage, lost its meaning.  So, I ask you to sit for a moment and ponder the term, focusing on the each of the words individually and then together......... Hopefully you were able to defeat the ubiquitous apathy of our world and actually feel something.  What you probably felt was a mere fraction of what you would feel after watching this film.
Few persons would dispute that one's first love is, in many ways, the most powerful.  This film explores first love, particularly in the late teenage years, and mostly from the male point of view; however, the film's story and theme are so universal that my 50-year-old parents were both moved to tears by its reality and intimacy.
Personally, I am appalled by so-called ""love stories"" such as Sleepless In Seattle and Pretty Woman, mostly because they do a terrible job of justifying and portraying the ""love"" that they intend.  I'm equally disgusted by the teen-romance genre with films like She's All That and Never Been Kissed.  With such harsh animosities toward such films it would seem obvious that Say Anything would certainly not be to my liking.  However, this film raises itself far above the aforementioned films in terms of dialogue, acting, directing, feasibility, and numerous other aspects.
Any American boy, who's ever had a crush on a girl, can relate so well to John Cusack's character Lloyd Dobbler that he'd think Cameron Crowe had been stalking him and turned his life into a movie.  The utter distress and confusion of love has never been portrayed as realistically as in the scene where Lloyd calls Diane for the first time, and he paces around the cramped bathroom, jumping in and out of the bathtub, stuttering out every sentence, and changing from a grimace to an ear-to-ear grin in an instant and then back again.
The nonsensical or awkward phrases and instances of real life have never been portrayed as well as in the scenes in which Diane gives Lloyd a pen and Lloyd seeks advice at the Gas n' Sip.  The despair of a broken heart has never been so realistically portrayed as in the scenes of Lloyd driving in the rain, standing in the rain, and holding up a stereo playing ""their song"" outside of Diane's window at dusk (an act that I myself performed before I had ever seen this movie).  The beauty and clumsiness of love have never been so perfectly intertwined as they are in this film.  No film offers as many memorable scenes and lines as this one.  Basically, this is love in all of its faults and successes, without the heavily constructed plot lines and dialogue of every other movie, and with a perfect balance of passion and confusion.
This is simply the sweetest and most personable love story ever told on film.",1013299200,3,2759,4.7510460251046025

Cusack is glorious as the outsider peeking in to the world he wants to be a part of.
Ione Skye is gorgeous.  The scene before the party where she comes around the corner in her red dress almost made me fall in love.  If you are in love with Ione, see The Rachel Papers, a British film starring Ione and James Spader.

It was so worth it!  This is such an honest, funny, romantic movie!  John Cusack is playing himself, once again, but he's so good at it!  He should give a lot of us guys out there hope...

330084,5,6301412761,"""Say Anything..."" is a wonderful tale that gives everyone support in reaching for something that they feel is unattainable, but still worth the effort.
Diane Court (Ione Skye in another wonderful, but underrated performance) is everyhting that guys want: Beauty, brains, Class, Sophistication.  In this, the character signifies all of the goals that peopl set for themselves, be it in life, career, family, whatever.  Some goals are lofty and never really meant to be attained.  This is the idea that you get from this character.
Lloyd Dobler is the icon for most Americans.  He's no slouch, but he seems to be struggling to get through life.  Much the way that everyday Americans try to get by.  he's not the brightest, nowhere near rich, and is just trying to get his slice of the American pie.
When Lloyd sees Diane, he develops a determination to succeed that is almost superhuman in it's desire.  Yes, they seem a totally unlikely pair, but the story weaves through his determination to his success, which is an inspiration if you can loko past the storyline and get to the heart of the matter.",995673600,,1099,4.8138297872340425

I gave her my heart and she gave me a pen.""  Unlike today's throwaway teen movies, this is a teen movie with heart--and staying power.",994636800,,674,4.885964912280702

330121,5,6301412761,"I only just saw this movie, for the first time, a few weeks ago. Somehow I missed it when it first came out, although I was 22 at the time and I wish I had seen it... Although I only saw it recently, and must allow my opinions to settle down a little, I strongly suspect that this movie will end up right up there with ""Somewhere in Time"" on my personal list of all time favorite romantic movies.
John Cusack, it goes without saying, is unbelievable as always. I'm not going to dwell on his many virtues here -- chances are, anyone seeing this review is scoping out this movie because they are already a John Cusack fan, or perhaps a Cameron Crowe fan... The female lead, Ione Skye, is just amazing. She's even more beautiful then her name, which is really saying something. Also, I'm a real sucker for terrific voices -- she has a really nice, slightly whispery, mellifluous, relaxing voice that you won't be able to forget. She's also been in ""Mindwalk"" and ""The River's Edge,"" if anyone wants to see her in other flicks...
Anyway, I'm not enough of an expert on movies to be able to say which scenes owe more to the actors, or which owe more to the director, but it just seems to me that they all worked extremely well together. There are five or six scenes here, primarily in the first half of the movie, that you will want to see again and again. They have exactly the right touch, somehow, they never try too hard to be funny, or to be romantic, or to outline the personalities of the characters. This probably means that they actually tried REALLY hard to do all those things, but they just conceal the effort very well. Also, they just add a personal touch in a really memorable way -- you seriously do feel like you are watching real people in a real relationship. It doesn't seem like a movie. Everyone is fully realized.
I was a little disappointed at the ending, somehow. Maybe it's because I like John Mahoney (who plays Frazier's dad, Martin, on ""Frazier"") but the whole thing of him getting nabbed for financial misdoings just didn't sit well with me. It was the only part of the movie that seemed even slightly contrived. Still, the first part of the movie is so fantastic that it more than makes up for any troubles toward the end.

The things that you find you must leave behind are becoming apparent - so you cling to them with everything you have.  Such is the love that Cusack feels for Skye.

330124,5,6301412761,"I don't know if it's just me, but writer/director Cameron Crowe always seems to hit the mark.  Whether it be his first effort at writing a Script (Fast Times at Ridgemont High), his second directorial effort (Singles), and the absolutely fabulous Jerry Maguire and this year's sure fire Best Picture, Almost Famous.
Unlike most films, which begin with a screenplay, producer, James L. Brooks asked Cameron Crowe to write the story in prose first. The result was a 90-page novella that became the outline for the film, and from which Crowe wrote the final screenplay.
This movie stars John Cusack (who must have been about 19) as Lloyd Dobler, an eternal optimist who seeks to capture the heart of Diane Court (Ione Skye).  He surprises just about everyone-including himself-when she returns the sentiment.  But Diane's over possessive, divorced Dad (John Mahoney) doesn't approve and it's going to take more than just the power of love to conquer all.
This is my favourite movie by Cameron Crowe.  As with all his movies, the dialogue is true to life and flows.  Every aspect of this film borders on unbelievable brilliance.  John Cusack is terrific as Lloyd Dobler, the sweetest guy in the whole world.  He's one of those guys that girls would love to have, but one of those guys that guys would love to be. The situations are true to life situations teens would absolutely be put in (I love watching Lloyd make his first phone call to Diane -- it reminded me of me) Ione Skye is also great as the object of Lloyd's affection torn between her love for her father and her love for Lloyd.
Besides being Cameron Crowe's best film, this movie also sports the greatest love scene of all time (I won't ruin it for those who haven't seen it), and can give inspiration to any guy who has ever wanted a girl as much as Lloyd.  Guaranteed though, after seeing this particular scene, be prepared to fall in love with Peter Gabriel's Song ""In Your Eyes"".
If you haven't read through all of this (if you got bored, I don't blame you), just read this last paragraph.  This is a terrific movie.  One that you can watch over and over again without getting tired of it.  If you haven't seen it, you are indeed missing out.  Roger Ebert declared it one of the best films of the year in 1989.

330125,5,6301412761,"It's been almost 20 years since I first saw this film -- despite widespread critical acclaim -- in an extremely uncrowded theater east of San Diego.

Perhaps because it lacked star voltage, perhaps because it lacked (at least back then) any recognizable household names, perhaps because it was strapped with a low budget yet enthusiastic TV ad campaign (compared to glowing newspaper ads published in L.A. and New York, which I clipped and still own, tinted brown with age) -- almost everyone I know who has seen this jewel -- never got to see it on the big screen. They caught it on video or on television.

The great news is everyone I know who has seen this film, fell in love with it.

Other reviewers have already done a terrific job discussing the machinations of the plot, the great acting, the fabulous, five-star ending ...that absolutely shatters you with joy and a sense of exhilaration that doesn't feel cheap or contrived.  It feels earned, real, honest and true.

Some films are worth renting or seeing once and then perhaps catching up with few years later on television.  But the story in ""Say Anything..."" hasn't aged at all, even though we're watching everything unfold based on objects and the perceptions of people in 1988 and 1989.

In my mind, there were only two GREAT films worthy of the Best Picture Oscar in 1989.  It wasn't the winner that year (""Driving Miss Daisy"").  And it wasn't the favorite to win that year (""Born on the Fourth of July"").  My first choice was ""Glory.""  My second was ""Say Anything..."" Neither film was nominated in the Best Picture category and neither film was a box office hit.  But thanks to cable, both have since gained many fans.

330128,5,6301412761,"Viewers are now being given a second chance to own this wonderful film via this video rerelease of a work that covers a lot of territory: romance, family relations, coming of age, temptation into fraud and embezzlement  plus the resolution of all this. Frankly, I like it BETTER than I liked its  writer-director's later film, ""Jerry Maguire"", which is saying a  lot.  A very young John Cusack is the hero here.  I'd only seen him in one  other movie when I saw this one.  I was incredibly impressed with his  performance, of a young man without any firm goals of his own other than  being extraordinarily committed to a young woman who has thought in terms  of nothing but goals her entire life.  She is played very well by Ione  Skye.  Unfortunately, I've only seen her in a few other roles over the  years.

Mahoney, the actor playing her father, does a shocking, but  completely believable turn, as the ideal dad who turns bad.  One line in  this film stands out in my mind more than any other line.  It is the father  telling his daughter, ""I did it for you,"" to excuse himself from  his own fraudulent, criminal conduct.  This is so true-to-life in so many  family or friend situations, that I'm sure everyone will hear it with the  shock of recognition.  Cusack and Skye make it seem extremely likely that  they will stay together through the long years after high school  graduation, which is when we see them in this movie.  I wasn't near their  age when I first saw this film and it didn't make a bit of difference.  It  appeals to viewers of all ages.  Hubby really liked it too.

330129,5,6301412761,"John Cusack's character in Say Anything, Lloyd Dobbler, is a cinematical  stud. No he's not a sports champ, or the smartest guy around. He's just a  good honest guy who knows how to treat others.
After Lloyd takes Diane  Cort out on their first date, they walk across a Seven-Eleven parking lot.  Diane is about to step in a pile of broken glass when Lloyd jumps ahead and  clears her path. Not that big of a deal, but that's the type of caring  gesture that men should preform on a regular basis. Lloyd continues these  acts throughout the movie, delivering his best preformance toward the end.  When things are looking grim between Lloyd and Diane(an obvious happening  in chick flicks), Lloyd stands outside of Diane's house by his Chevy  Malibu, lifts up his radio, and plays 'In Your Eyes' by Peter Gabriel. This  scene, of coarse, will go down as one of the most romantic scenes in  cinematic history.
Now I'm not saying that us single men should use  Lloyd Dobbler as a roll model. Nor am I suggesting that the next time your  romantic life turns sour to run over to your girlfriends house with a  boombox and play some romantic toon to her opened bedroom window (although  it did work for a friend of mine). Granted Lloyd is purly fictional.  However, he does appear to be a genuine guy who could teach us all a thing  or two.",963360000,,1334,4.4875
330182,5,6301412761,"This is the movie I use to see if someone is worthwhile.  ""Do you love '...say anything'?"" I'd say.  If the answer is 'yes', then I have a friend for life.  If the answer is 'no', then be gone with ye.
This movie  has many outstanding moments.  Of course, there's the 'In Your Eyes' scene  outside Diane's window.  But I also love the moment where John Mahoney (who  is great as always) breaks down in the bathtub.  Or when Lloyd has his  picture taken with Diane after graduation.  ""I gave her my heart and  she gave me a pen"".  I could go on and on.
In most romantic  comedies, it is essential for me to fall in love with the girl as deeply as  the boy does.  Usually that's the kicker for me.  This is the exception.  I  didn't fall in love with Diane Court.  I don't blame this on Ione Skye -  she did a great job with what she had.  It's just that what she had is  nothing spectacular.  There's something cold and distant and unaware about  Diane that I just can't wrap my head around.  She is the kind of person I  probably wouldn't think twice about.  Come to think of it, she's the kind  of person who probably wouldn't understand '...say anything'?  Hmm.
And you  know what?  None of that matters.  Because I fell in love with Lloyd  Dobler.  One of my three all-time favourite screen characters (along with  Hannibal Lecter and Max Fisher), Lloyd is a unique individual.  He's  confidant yet vulnerable, extroverted yet shy, pure yet complex.  John  Cusack does a great job here.  He plays Lloyd with pitbull intensity  (witness the kickboxing) and yet puppy dog emotion.  His relationships with  his friends and his sister and his nephew are all super sincere and  beautiful.
And just like his friends, I can totally see someone like  Diane Court falling for someone like Lloyd Dobler.  It's in the details, it  is.  He checks up on her at the party; he points out the broken glass; he  teaches her to drive a stick; he eases her fears on the airplane.  And  that's why this movie is so great.  Because even though I may not have  fallen in love with Diane, I can still understand Lloyd's passion for her.",962582400,114,2116,4.400523560209424
330183,5,6301412761,"First, I wanted to say that just about all the customer reviews here were really pleasing to read. ""Say Anything"" is without a doubt one of my all-time favorites, but as much as I love John Cusack's Lloyd Dobler, I  do not love this film because he is ""the ideal boyfriend"", but  because all the characters are so well-drawn and thoroughly human, a  quality that is lacking in teen films of recent years. As much as I like  90s teen films like ""American Pie"", we simply do not get to know  characters on a deeply-personal level. Cusack, Ione Skye and John Mahoney  all portray many dimensions to each of their characters, just as humans are  complex in real life. I love this film because it is so deeply human and  relatable. Anyone who has seen this film and doesn't love it is probably  crazy, or just an aspiring screenwriter who is bitter at Cameron Crowe for  so beautifully and effectively conveying the emotions of the human spirit  onto the screen.
Plus, a bunch of great quotes come from this movie:  ""You must chill! I have hidden your keys! Chill!""; ""Joe  Lies, Joe Lies, While he cries, while he cries...""; ""Friends with  potential""; ""If you were Diane Court, would you honestly fall for  Lloyd Dobler?"" ""Yeah...""; ""You're shaking""  ""No...I'm happy""; ""Don't be a guy. The world is full of  guys--be a man""; ""Let him do what he wants""
Another great  80s love story is ""Some Kind of Wonderful"" with Eric Stoltz and  Mary Stuart Masterson. Though not as thoroughly enjoyable as ""Say  Anything"" it is very similar being in the ""unlikely love""  category and is especially great to catch if you have ever loved someone  who was in love with someone else.",962582400,4,1661,4.635738831615121

Take Diane Court (Ione Skye)  Class  Valedictorian, a wealthy father, going to England on a scholarship -  smarter than anyone else in her whole high school.  What chance does a  lowly, non-scholastic optimist like Lloyd Dobler (John Cusack) have with a  girl who's as beautiful to boot as she is smart?  You'd be surprised.  Like  the rest of us, there's a world of misunderstandings that lie within her.  The girl that's on top of the world is very, very insecure.  Add to that a  serious scandal her father gets in and you'll know why she favors the  silly, but compassionate kickboxer.  He's not as silly as you might think  and provides the kind of rock solid friend we all wish we had.  Lili Taylor  adds wonderful comedy relief as Corey - Lloyd's tragically funny best  friend.

Lloyd Dobler is a confident, but unsure  person who is looking for something great that he can do for the rest of  his life. He finds that in Diane Court, the class valadvictorian, who looks  like a priss on the outside. We soon find out that she is scared like the  rest of us. That is what great about this film. The characters are not mere  stereotypes of the cliques they represent. They are not one dimensional at  all. The acting is great all around. Ione Skye gives a sensitive portrayal  of Diane. She doesn't overdo the character's bounderies. Lili Taylor gives  (as always) a great performance as Corey, Lloyd's best friend. She has  established such a name for herself in the independent scene. I can go on  forever about the actors in this film. The story is quite unexpected as  well. Rather than being a standard comedy, it plays more like a study at  who a person really is. Even some of the scenes are very memorable: the  chemestry Lloyd has with his nephew J-man, the party where Diane learns  about Lloyd, and the most memorable, Lloyd playing ""In Your Eyes""  outside Diane's window.

Lloyd Dobler, John Cusack's character, is the kind of guy  every girl should have for a best friend - and if they're really lucky, a  boyfriend.  He's not pretty, not rich, not brilliant, not popular, not  ambitious - but he has heart and integrity that you seldom see in a teen  movie.  I shouldn't even call it a teen movie because it crosses that  boundary.
I'm not terribly fond of Ione Skye's portrayal of Diane Cort  (""a brain, trapped in the body of a game show hostess""), but  except for her, the people in this movie are so real you feel you could  have gone to high school with them.
Lloyd's best friend (played by Lili  Taylor) has one of my favorite lines - she tells Lloyd, ""Don't be a  GUY, be a Man.""

330190,5,6301412761,"When I think of the most impressive coming-of-age movies, Say Anything and Wild Reeds (95,French) will always come into my mind first. Both movies are so truthful, realistic and deliver the emotion in such a natural way with  quiet but amazing depth.
I checked out Say Anything without knowing  anything about it, and ended it up with such a pleasant surprise and became  a Cusack fan ever since. The more I watch it, the better I feel about it.
Made in 1989, I found this movie not only a stand out in 80s teen  movies, but also exceeded most 90s teen movies. This is a movie I can watch  over and over again without getting bored. Sadly say, most 90s teen movies  are only worth seeing once.
The break up scene is one of the most  touching ones in its genre. ""I feel like crying... She gave me a pen,  I gave her my heart, she gave me a pen."" Cusack made Lloyd one of the  remarkably endearing roles in all teen movies.  Lloyd is far from a hero,  he is a ""champion mediocrity"" (Diana's Dad's quote) who has no  career goals except being a kickboxer.  Normally this kind of guy can not  win my heart.  However, Cusack made LLoyd an awesome one. He made her  laugh, he pointed out the glass for her to walk around, he said the thing  that he really meant it,...I never realized that all those trivia can be so  powerful to a girl until I watched Say Anything.
""One question: you  are here coz you need someone or coz you need me? ... forget it, I don't  care.""
A must see!",953510400,,1473,4.249097472924188

It is funny and touching and Lloyd Dobbler IS the  perfect man. Please watch it.  You'll love it.  I promise.",952128000,,281,4.036363636363636

Great film that stands way above the average teenage drama-romance, they  don't make them like this anymore. Great acting, great script, rings true  to many viewers, see this movie. If you like John Cusack I recommend 'The  Grifters'. From a scale of 1-10 I give this movie an 8!",951091200,,430,4.693333333333333

Lili Taylor was really funny as friend of John Cusack's who had  written over 60 songs for her ex. Buy this movie. You will *NOT* regret it.",948758400,,291,4.490566037735849
330206,5,6301412761,"It's just a shame that this movie came out in the John Hughes era as this is definetely the best of the teen movies.  However, it's also the least watched of the teen movies cos hardly anyone knows about it.
  You  have Cusack doing his usual broody acting, you have his sister being his  contact with reality, the one-two act seen also in Grosse Pointe Blank, and  then you have his love interest who's recent forray into the acting  business was 'Dreams for an Insomniac.'
  However, this is different  from all the other teen movies churned out at this time, something similar  to whats happening in the Asian movie industry.  This film actually has a  plot, the parents in the film actually have some substance.  It also has  one of the funniest characters in all teen movies.  The girl who's wrote  hundreds of songs about her ex-boyfriend.
  Isn't it ironic how the  best of the era always shines through though.  They may have bombed at the  time but now they're starting to come into their own!",948240000,2,1002,4.573863636363637

I think Say Anything is a good movie -- that carries a certain innocence -- from a time when everything seemed a bit more simple than today... let's say 3.5 stars.",1521072000,,384,4.093333333333334
