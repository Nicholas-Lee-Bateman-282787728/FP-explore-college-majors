8758324,5,B01EBNVJCY,"A great performance of a little known opera. Michael Spyres and Enea Scala were outstanding.
I prefer this to the other version with Ramon Vargas. Contrary to what the front cover claims, this is not
a world premier since I bought the other version  on ArtHaus a couple of years ago",1508112000,2,282,4.529411764705882
8758325,3,B01EBNVJCY,"First, I want to let other reviewers know that I am a Spanish speaking man and that English for me is a foreign language. I love ballet almost as much as I love opera, but I do not like most operatic ballets or dancing. I think that most operatic ballets are intrusive and have nothing to do with the story of the opera. Of course, there are operas where the ballet is part of the story (Carmen, Aida, Les Troyens, Eugene Onegin) but most of them have fine  beautiful music that is best heard as orchestral music outside the opera ( La Gioconda, Le Cid, Don Carlos, Le Prophete). The problem
with this production is precisely that. It has too much dancing poorly choreographed and having nothing to do with the story. To make things worse, Medea's children are two semi naked adults that act more as lovers than brother and sister. And Medea in her last aria calls them ""pargoletti"" (little children) as Adalgisa pleads with Norma for hers in ""Mira O Norma"". Since the opera is so good, it is better to play the discs with Video off.",1481241600,2,1033,4.436842105263158
8758326,5,B01EBNVJCY,"The music of Giovanni Simone Mayr (1763 -- 1845) has enjoyed a revival in recent years due in part to the many recordings of his works by Franz Hauk. Listening to Hauk's recordings of Mayr encouraged me to watch this outstanding new DVD of Mayr's opera, ""Medea in Corinto"" in this live performance from the 2015 Valle d""Italia Festival. Fabio Luisi conducts the Orchestra International d'Italia with Benedetto Sicca the stage director. Set to a libretto by Felice Romani, ""Medea in Corinto"" was first performed in Naples in 1813. The work was revised and performed frequently over the ensuing few years as a vehicle for virtuoso sopranos, but it dropped out of the repertoire. There is at least one other CD and DVD available of Mayr's opera.

The opera is described as a ""Melodramma tragico in two acts."" The story, derived from Euripides, tells of revenge, jealousy and passion. Jason returns to Corinth as a military hero to claim as his bride Creusa, the daughter of King Creon. Jason was married to the sorceress Medea who had committed murders and other misdeeds on his behalf. Jason and Medea had two children. Creon had promised Creusa to Aegeus from Athens but went back on the promise so that Jason and Creusa could wed. The two spurned parties, Medea and Aegeus form a pact in the opera.  Medea kills Creusa by giving her the gift of a poisoned wedding dress and then kills the two children. Jason is left broken-hearted and alone at the end of the opera.

This production of ""Medea in Corinto"" works beautifully musically and theatrically. The leading role belongs to Davinia Rodriguez as a passionate, vengeful Medea.  She sings and acts with conviction.  The vocal part is demanding and difficult with Medea center stage much of the time in solo arias or ensembles. Medea is alternately contrite, pleading, and unabashedly vengeful. The opera and the performance do a great deal in characterizing the other roles.  Creusa, the would-be heroine, appears as a seductress in a revealing satiny blue gown. Jason is full of himself and eager to justify his conduct. The characters might not deserve what they get from Medea, but they are hardly innocent in the situation.

Michael Soyres sings the demanding role of Jason with fervor but his acting is a bit wooden. Mihaela Marcu's Creusa and Robert Lorenzi's Creon were both convincingly sung and acted.  The opera has a large role for the chorus and dancers.  The setting by an old castle is appropriately eerie, and the costumes particularly for Medea and Creusa help make the point of the story.

The work uses large and varied orchestration featuring winds and an extended harp solo at the beginning of the second act. The score has its tragic moments together with moments of heavily Neapolitan lyrical singing. Mayr's music is usually described as showing both classical and Italian opera influences. (Donizetti was his student.)  In this opera, the Italian influences clearly predominate.

Of the recordings of Mayr I have heard, this ""Medea in Corinto"" makes the strongest case for his work as a composer.  The production was convincingly done, and it drew me into the opera and theater. I was glad to hear this music for itself, rather than in part for learning about a composer relatively unfamiliar to me. The DVD features excellent sound, video, and clear subtitles.  The liner notes, derived from a new critical edition of the opera, focus on the work's early performance history. The 2-DVD set is on the Dynamic label and distributed by Naxos.  Naxos kindly sent me a review copy.
