To us, today, some of his stunts may draw a chuckle but otherwise his films are lamentably dated. Still, I'm not sorry I bought this collection.",1392854400,,261,4.822222222222222
8350000,1,B0023SV4TS,"Every public domain company tries to lure the unsuspecting fan to their product by using words like ""Enhanced"" or ""Digitally Mastered"". These words mean NOTHING if good master material is not used in the first place. Most professional companies never use these words, so avoid DVD products that use them.

8350001,3,B0023SV4TS,"Granted these films are extremely old and they look it. It was almost hard to watch because I was used to seeing films from Harold Lloyd, Chaplin and Mary Pickford where their films have been cared for and they look it. This collection is basically, you get what you pay for. If you're okay with rough looking films and don't wish to pay much for them, then this is the collection for you.

8350002,4,B0023SV4TS,"COPS is a 1922 comedy short silent film about a young man (Buster Keaton) who accidentally gets on the bad side of the entire Los Angeles Police Department during a parade, and is chased all over town. It was written and directed by Edward F. Cline and Keaton.  This very Kafka-esque film is Keaton's response to the Fatty Arbuckle scandal.

ONE WEEK is a 1920 short comedy film starring comedian Buster Keaton, the first film to be released made by Keaton on his own; Keaton had worked with Roscoe ""Fatty"" Arbuckle for a number of years. The film was written and directed by Keaton and Edward F. Cline, and runs for 19 minutes. Sybil Seely co-stars. The High Sign had been filmed prior to One Week, but Keaton considered it an inferior effort to debut with, and released it the following year.",1255478400,,794,4.584507042253521
