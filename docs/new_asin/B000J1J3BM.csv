2665846,4,B000J1J3BM,"This turned out to be a refreshing movie with some surprising twists. It is a primarily a heist movie with elements of African mysticism, and old school 70s black movies.  It kept me engaged never knowing what was coming next. It is a French movie set in France and Senegal. The only thing I didn't really care for is the English voice overs that did not seem realistic. I have never heard of the actors in the States, but I look forward to seeing more from the main character and the main woman in the movie.",1341187200,,509,4.302083333333333
2665847,4,B000J1J3BM,"The beginning of the story opens with a prophet spouting crazy prophecy about the Snake, the Lion and the Panther. Black (MC Jean Gab'1), our would be criminal ignores them. Eventually he hooks up with his cousin in Dakar about some diamonds being kept in his bank vault. The diamonds are used as a pay off to a dishonest bank president who launders money.

As it turns out, Black is not the only person who has an eye on the diamonds. The film becomes a lion and snake movie, the African version of cat and mouse as Black hooks up with Pamela (Carole Karemera). During the film I keep expecting Richard Roundtree to pop out at any moment. It had that 70's feel. Good moving plot. Minor humor. Guys with Russian accents are the bad guys. Some weird stuff tossed in. 3 1/2 STARS

2665852,4,B000J1J3BM,"Based on the darkness and soundlessness of Helen Keller's world, Sanjay Leela Bhansali's monumental work Black, is an attempt to take us through the experience of witnessing a human being overcome what is practically insurmountable. Black is an opportunity to witness and appreciate an aspect of human existence that many of us are probably not even aware of. To think of an existence wherein one cannot hear and cannot see calls for some ability to imagine. In the rush of life, we find it so very easy to ignore and block out the pains of lesser privileged that most of us perchance can never even imagine.

Black is a movie as `real' as is gets - it is even based on a true story. In terms of cinematic excellence it belongs to the highest league. Bhansali seems to have brought that caliber and class to Bollywood that many directors failed in, even when they tried. In many ways, you are reminded of Sadma. But Bhansali's characters are a little more complex. Rani's deep felt pain has been portrayed at various levels - from the basic inability to communicate to a less obvious trauma of knowing that she would never be treated as a `woman'. So has been Amitabh's sense of commitment as a teacher. It would be an understatement to brand Amitabh's role in Rani's life as that of a teacher. He is more of a father than Rani's own, more of a mother than Rani's own is and in what is a great moment of catharsis his character also rises to dare what the audience thought it would not - be Rani's one kiss lover. That one kiss symbolizes many a feelings - including a commitment to make Rani's life as complete as possible.

Black is full of brilliant performances - Ayesha Kapoor as the eight year old Rani, being probably the most impressive one. Rani herself has attained unprecedented heights of acting brilliance. Amitabh has acted brilliantly, so brilliantly that it seems almost effortless. Minus any songs and any Bollywood style twists and turns, Black probably marks the beginning of a new era in Indian cinema. In the final analysis, Bhansali's best direction until date - Black - is a great testimony to a great director who is not defined by his environment but defines it by his creations.",1175731200,3,2204,4.634271099744246
2665853,5,B000J1J3BM,"The only reason I did not get up and clap at the end of the film was because I was a bit too taken aback by the strange flood of emotions in tears this film brought out from me. I have never seen a film with this torturously significant direction of mind. Amitabh Bachchan might live a hundred years but it is without a doubt in 2005 that he actually reached a level beyond being called ""superhuman"" His acting is synonmous and quite close to what my faithful description of people's God might be. (I Don't beleive in God mind you)

Rani Mukherjee on the other hand who plays the role of Michelle gives to this film what no actor possibly could have given. She does indeed outshine anything remotely addressed to impress. I lost count of the number of times I shamelessly let out the tears. However, like a lot of illiterate teenagers and middle aged people, I do not call this film depressive. Infact, I call it a challanging inspiration of sorts. After this film, I realised I will watch all movies involving Amitabh Bachchan and more importantly Rani Mukherjee.

To play the life of a human who can't see,hear,touch as well as Rani does for this film is simply unbelievable. The next time I run into Amitabh Bachchan I will make sure I touch his feet. He's the closest to God we'll ever be.

Time and again, I think of the best films I have seen in Bollywood but this one film right here makes them all shudder and sit back 20 rows from the first row that belongs to Black.

The last scene of this film is quite possibly the most emotionally jolting scene I have ever witnessed in my life. It's sad that many people died before watching ""Black"" or many might not witness the epic.

If you have remotely liked a film in your life,then I order you to watch ""Black"" No matter who you are and where you reside.

With 233 salutes and more earned respect,

H.S.Anand",1165363200,4,1863,4.398255813953488
2665854,5,B000J1J3BM,"""Black"" is a film you do not come across very often, but when you do, it sweeps you away into another world and keeps you mesmerized and spellbound, even long after the film has finished.  In fact, I believe this film has the power to change lives.  If the story itself is not compelling enough, then the visual aspect of exceptionally brilliant and beautiful photography will surely impress and inspire.  ""Black"" is actually the true story of Helen Keller, born in 1880, and through illness as a baby became both deaf and blind: truly a black world, but she was taught language, attended normal schools and even wrote several books in the early 1900s.  This film tells the same story with different names and people, set in Simla, an Indian city in the Himalayas, rich in atmosphere and old world charm.  The soft lighting and colours in this film enhance the mood and create many visually dramatic scenes, while the entire cast give the performance of a lifetime.  The portrayal of Michelle, both as a child and later as an adult, is absolutely convincing as she develops from the state of being like a wild animal suffocating in her black world as a child, to an intelligent adult fully competent in expressing herself in sign language and Braille; always with passionate human emotions which cannot fail to affect the viewer.  Her teacher is an equally dynamic and forceful personality who refuses to give up, and inspires Michelle to reach her goals and become independent.  The relationships between Michelle and her parents, sister and teacher are also poignantly portrayed and there are several deeply moving and heart-rending moments.  It is a serious film with many dim-lit scenes, yet it is by no means gloomy or depressing.  Quite to the contrary:  the message is one of great inspiration as it shows of what the human spirit is capable when faced with seemingly insurmountable obstacles.  Most of us would think that the loss of only one sense, sight or hearing, would ruin our lives, yet it's possible to live a fully productive and fulfilling life without either of these major senses.  It makes you re-evaluate what you're doing with your own life, with all your senses in working order.

""Black"" is an Indian film in Hindi and English languages, but it is far removed from the typical Bollywood output of generally bright, colourful, feel-good musicals.  There are no songs in ""Black"", instead beautiful orchestral music perfectly suited to scenes and settings.  In fact, the only thing reminiscent of Bollywood are the two leading stars:  Amitabh Bachchan, `Mr Bollywood' himself, a highly esteemed legend of Indian cinema, who portrays the eccentric and fully devoted teacher; and Rani Mukherjee, usually seen as one of the many pretty Bollywood faces singing and dancing her way through happy-go-lucky musicals, has aspired to this great artistic role of Michelle, and has succeeded wonderfully.  While both big-name performers give it their all, I was also profoundly impressed by the child actor who plays Michelle as a young girl.  Praise and credit must also be given to the director, Sanjay Leela Bhansali, whose previous film was the spectacular ""Devdas"" which was the first Indian film to be shown at the Cannes Film Festival in 2002 where it received much praise and positive comment.  All in all, this film is full of India's greatest talents and artistic skills which, in the case of ""Black"", is equal to the world's finest cinema.",1163894400,7,3461,4.93448275862069
