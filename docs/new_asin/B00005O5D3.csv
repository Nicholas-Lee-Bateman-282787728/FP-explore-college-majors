7948236,2,B00005O5D3,The physical qualities of the DVD are fine - the content certainly doesn't agree with the written description.  It's really a lower grade production.,1429056000,,149,5.208333333333333
7948237,5,B00005O5D3,"Hello everyone on here. I am a big movie-TV series buff. I stumbled on this movie while visting another website, and it linked me over to amazon. In some cases, these reviews I have already read from other amazon members on here are right about one thing. this is a B-movie no doubt about that. Drive-In is the story of a lonely boy who has cruel mean parents, and he's locked in his room for most of his life. The only thing outside of reality that intertains him the most is that across the street from his bedroom window is you-guessed it... he sees a DRIVE-IN THEATER... While looking at the drive-in from his bedroom window, he sees on the drive-in screen playing nothing but B-Troma slasher movies. and while no gore is being perfected or shown in this movie in anyway. this is a movie that I want to see. from the reviews on here that I have already read, it is with the greatest respect to me, a certain fan base of the film and judging by the reviews... and out of respect for the DRIVE-IN THEATER... I am giving this a 5 star. this is my rating... because I am a DRIVE-IN THEATER FAN... And I will being ordering this movie ammediatly. thanks again amazon.",1122422400,,1166,4.353211009174312

It was mostly shot at a drive-in with a video camera with about the same budget as the price of a popcorn and a large Coke at the snack bar. A (well...let's just call him ""slow"" to keep from being too unkind about it) teenage boy has spent most of his life locked in his room by his ashamed mother with no contact with the outside world. All that he knows about people is from his mother and a house keeper who are quite cold and cruel to him. Outside the window of the room he is locked in he can see the screen of the local drive-in that runs nothing but Troma and horror films( Sounds like heaven on Earth. Anyone got the address? I'll be there as fast as I can!). One night he finally can't stand it anymore so he breaks free and kills everyone he sees buy.....well.....he...uh..kills them by what ever he can find. I can only guess because we don't get to see anything! Bummer. It works out like this: He swings the speaker around by the cord walks toward the next victim and...and...nothing. CUT.The filmmakers didn't have the budget for any gore. It looks like they where going to cut it in later and never did. Did the local butcher shop close or something? Oh well I guess ya just can't have it all.

All in all I liked it. But, if it wasn't for it being shot at a drive in with Troma films playing on the screen,and a nacho cheese version of the fast food fun game ""bobing for french fries"" it would be pointless. For big time drive-in fans only.",1106352000,2,1504,4.204152249134948
7948239,1,B00005O5D3,"DRIVE IN has all the ingredients of your standard slasher flick:

*THE OLDEST LOOKING TEENAGERS IN RECENT CINEMA

*INCREDIBLY BAD ACTING

*STUPID KIDS DOING STUPID THINGS

*HORRENDOUS EDITING AND LIGHTING

*A KILLER WHO IS ABOUT AS FRIGHTENING AS BARNEY THE DINOSAUR

*AN OUT OF PLACE, IF FUN, MUSICAL SCORE

*CLIPS FROM FIVE TROMA STUDIO MOVIES WITH GORE, GORE AND MORE

*THE LESSON THAT HAVING SEX OR SMOKING POT WILL LEAD TO SLAUGHTER

The director obviously intended to give us a moral lesson in the effect of horror movies on the our psyches.

Well trust me folks.  This movie should have no effect.  It offers further ammunition to the fact that slasher movies may have seen their day.  When's the last time you saw a really good and imaginative one???",1100217600,2,758,4.782945736434108
7948240,1,B00005O5D3,"I have myself see over hundreds of horror movies, and this ranks in the top 5 worst i have ever seen. Trust me, no deaths on camera, ridiculous plot, boring, slow, and awful acting. Stay far away, I wouldnt even rent it!!",1100044800,,221,4.285714285714286
7948241,3,B00005O5D3,"Not bad for a B-movie. The idea of a disturbed kid locked up in his room all of his life with a drive in that plays nothing but hack em up movies all the time in perfect view from his window,and escaping to the drive in to perform the only thing he knows is a good idea for a horror flic. But i was dissapointed when i couldn't see most of the kills because the kept flashing over to the drive in screen as the kid (Billy) was going for his own kill. Whenever they did show him kill there was hardly any blood. I mean,come on. B-movies are supposed to have too much blood. Also gonna have to complain about the picture quality. Wasnt very good at all in some parts. I would rent before you buy it. This is a movie i watched 1 time and will probably never watch again. On a scale of 1 - 10, i will give it a 6",1095465600,,808,3.8734939759036147

A retarded boy wandering around in a drive-in killing people?  Well, for some reason I thought the plot sounded compelling, but after watching this film I felt the only retarded thing was myself for wanting to see a film like this.  Do NOT even waste your time on this tripe.",1064361600,2,415,4.35064935064935

7948244,4,B00005O5D3,"I thought this was a well made B horror movie. Some of the killings could've been a little bloodier, but I thought it was good. I especially liked the clips from Troma movies that they showed. Just a good watch!",1024531200,2,211,4.3
