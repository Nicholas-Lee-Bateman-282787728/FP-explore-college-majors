1420752,4,B00005B3Z5,"After the opening salvo - that is sex scene - between Aiden Gillett and Charlie Hunnam, this original series opens into a wonderful drama of gay life.  Of course, there are still more sex scenes (a delicately filmed threesome) but the real drama revolves around everyday issues of being gay.  Unlike it's American counterpart, this series pulls no punches and never underestimates your intelligence.
The characters are believable and although not always lovable (Stuart, you bugger!), you can't help but root for even the bad guy.  Won't you don't tolerate are the eggheads and snobs that permeate all strata of life.  In other words, the know-it-alls do get their comeuppance.  The three major characters are first class actors.  They make you want to come back for more.
Get the series and get a first class taste of gay life!",986428800,14,828,4.920863309352518
1420753,5,B00005B3Z5,"About 3 years ago a show appeared on British TV that shocked a nation.  Its frank portrayal of gay lifestyle in Manchester was soon met by both anger and raves.  Soon, even if they didn't admit it, people were tuning into Queer as Folk and loving it.  The story is simple.  Stuart, afraid of falling in love, turns to one night stands for pleasure.  Stuart's friend Vince, a die-hard Dr. Who fan, is in love with Stuart, but can't admit it to himself or his friend. Then...along comes Nathan...a 16 year old who is just coming out of the closet and falling in love with Stuart.  What happens next is a journey you will need to take.  Its about time that the English version of this show was available in the US.  The Showtime adaption is good...but its the UK version that sizzles!  Believe me...Episode 1 has gone down in British History as the 25 minutes that rocked a nation!  This video set is Series 1.  Series 2 appeared a year later...and although it closed the doors on Queer as Folk...it is not as good as the first 8 episodes.",985392000,30,1036,4.4
1420754,4,B00005B3Z5,"Picked this DVD off a Canadian website about a year ago. The American version is definitely more sexual although the Brits are adult enough to show frontal male nudity (yep, even on ""regular"" TV). Stuart (Brian) is more likeable, less of predator. Vince (Michael) is not quite as starry-eyed over Stuart as Michael is over Brian. And Nathan is adorable without the little boy cuteness of Justin. Typical British TV show in that it hits and runs but worth viewing to see where the US QAF comes from. All in all the American QAF is much more entertaining. Faster paced, campier, more extensive story. Plus the Brits just don't have it in the looks department :-((
A word of caution . . . the Manchester accent is quite thick and there's a lot of British slang, so if you're not familiar with either or both, you might have a bit of trouble catching the meaning without a translator by your side.  But that's just my opinion. I could be wrong.",984614400,35,940,4.529411764705882
1420755,5,B00005B3Z5,"I remember my first memory of this series. I was in my first semester in college, in San Francisco, and I saw this DVD of the first season of Queer as Folk at the Virgin Store. I decided to give it a try.

I was still in the closet at the time and had no queer experiences as one would say. From the moment I finished the first episode, I was hooked. I like to think that most people that watch this can relate to one of the three main characters: the lead slut, the newbie, and the gay best friend. The newbie was basically who I was at the time, and from that very first episode it felt like their world could be my world, and that life was full of so much possibility. Watching again with more experienced eyes, I now understand more of the British and gay slangs, and it feels like watching it for the first time.

It's great watching this series again, and it's also strange seeing two big actors before they were stars: Aidan Gillen of Game of Thrones fame, and Charlie Hunnam of Pacific Rim fame. I'm so glad this series is now available on Amazon and I'm waiting for Series 2 to show up. Recommended.",1487894400,,1108,4.197183098591549

1420788,1,B00005B3Z5,"To be blunt:  this may simply be a cultural difference.  But, the American Showtime version of QAF was truly cutting edge. Most everyone who watched the American version immediately believed that Justin and Brian were (could be) deeply in love.  The characters were more richly portrayed - and the producers were honestly willing (able) to make a more adult version:  topics and nudity.  The British version inspired the American but I never connected with a single character on that show.  I found myself hitting fast forward out of boredom.  I would highly recommend that everyone watch all 5 seasons of the US version before watching the British series.  There has never been a series since that was so honest and willing to talk about the issues - even if many in the community felt that it was over sexualized.  The truth is that you can remove sexuality from the gay community.",1361923200,,883,4.7947019867549665

1420793,5,B00005B3Z5,"I admit I am a self-obsessed fan of the American version of ""Queer as Folk"". I discovered the series in its second year when it was originally broadcast on Canada's ""Showtime"" network and it has become my favorite television show of all-time. I never thought a series about a bunch of gay men living in Pittsburg would replace shows like ""Here's Lucy"", ""Bewitched"", and ""The Golden Girls"" in my heart. but ""Queer as Folk"" has. I have seen me watch the series over and over, sort of what Annie Wilkes does in ""Misery"" with her novels, but thankfully I don't think I am disturbed as Annie; I hope not anyway! So, I recently borrowed a friends box set of the original ""Queer as Folk"" and I have to say that version is excellent too from its daring storylines to the superb acting. What I find interesting is how Ron Cowen and Daniel Lipman were able to Amercianize ""Queer as Folk"" for their North American audience by staying true to the series' original bible. It's also neat to compare both versions to see how close the American ""Queer as Folk"" is to the original. This is evident in the pilot episodes as we meet a young teen entering the gay village of a large metropolitan city where he meets an older and successful man who changes his life forever. While there the teen also meets, through his new love interest, various friends and relatives, and it is through the teen that we as an audience are taken on this journey of what gay life is really like.

 I was a little worried about the strong British dialect of ""Queer as Folk"", but this is a very minor issue as once your immersed into the stories you forget all about the english accents. The original ""Queer as Folk"" really wasn't a series, but a mini-series in American terms as only 10 episodes were filmed for the two year run.

 This particular box set is long out-of-print and very expensive to purchase from private collectors, but the good news is the studio that owns the original ""Queer as Folk"" is releasing the entire series again in one complete set in the summer of 2011. That is something I am looking froward to!",1294272000,2,2087,4.4986807387862795
1420794,5,B00005B3Z5,"QUEER AS FOLK

That is a series that can only be British. I remember in the early 60s, or is it slightly later, a theater that played one big success in London at the time in Charring Cross Road, ""No sex Please, we are British"". Times have changed and this series is quite typical of that change. Sex, sex and sex, stopping one inch from hardcore sex, and gay what's more. And yet that film is a lot more than these few erotic episodes. First it is deeply committed to diversity in sexual orientation. All the nuances and shades of gayness are exploited and shown in the most funny and comical way, never derisive, never aggressive, but always in a comic orientation of its own. You cannot imagine the diversity of shades and personalities you may or might find in this community. In fact you have to dip yourself in it, or even soak yourself in it to know. But be careful though to know what you're doing otherwise it might become another famous play on Charring Cross Road, viz. ""The Mousetrap"". Second it strikingly confront the problem of age in a sexual community that is too often marked by transience and instability, especially since these couples are not recognize by the law and do not have the right to marry and create a stable home. That implies gay people are more or less forced to cruise all their life, to be the hunter or to be the prey. That is so clearly shown with the main character who is practically never having two helpings of the same dish. But that is true till a fifteen year old boy he seduces decides to ask for more insistently. That makes the main hero Stuart think maybe he is losing something that will never come back, his youth and he maybe should think of the future and not only of the present, or at most the balance of the hunt and how many people, I mean men and boys, he has shagged. But Stuart has another problem with his childhood friend, Vince, who is gay too, who would like to get Stuart or who would like Stuart to get him, but he is shy and he does not want to find himself involved in the great unstable sexual looting of the vast world. So he gets attached to an older man and this episode, both for Stuart and his friend Vince, is a revelation, an epiphany. They discover they have something in common that they cannot find at all with anyone else, and that is exemplified with the various actors who played Doctor Who. They have a past in common, a tremendous level of personal commitment to each other, generally called friendship, and a sexual attraction and even passion they can easily release, provided they get away from their common environment that is a mousetrap to them, viz. Manchester. Third the series does not hesitate to show what sex is for young male teenagers (fifteen or so) and here the fifteen year old boy, Nathan, is our study case. Nathan, is the living example of that age. Provocative and yet shy, exhibitionistic and yet modest, passionate and yet reserved, light-headed by principle and yet over-thoughtful. In fact he knows one thing: he wants sex. He knows a second thing: he wants gay sex. He finds danger and difficulties exciting, so why not try the macho jock at school who is of course both straight and homophobic, even if... when he closes his eyes and lets himself go, he may accept a helping hand. But this young chick, Nathan, has to learn one thing: Stuart is too old for him. He, Nathan, can only be some kind of a cherry on a pile of ice-cream for Stuart's birthday or any other celebration. But he has nothing in common with Stuart except his sex and his sexual attraction and orientation. And that's the meaning of the second series. The first series had finished nothing at all and we were hanging in midair. But the second series gives an end to every character and the last episode ends up with a hot scene on a hot parking lot in the hot state of Arizona between the hot cities of Phoenix and Tucson with a hot gun and a not so hot contrite ""Sorry!"" from a hot muscular truck driver who could very easily get involved in some hot gay bashing episode, like at the beginning of Stephen King's ""IT"". Just get the full two series and watch them for fun, enjoyment, and eventually, if you are in the proper mood and orientation, for pleasure.

1420797,5,B00005B3Z5,"I had grown tired of the US Queer as Folk series. Sure when it came out it was interesting and fresh, and now I realize the reason why--it basically transplanted lines from the UK series during its first season. After the first season I could no longer stand whiny Michael and ridiculously pathetic Brian (I don't see why he's hot).

Upon watching the UK version however, I was so blown away...so this was what the series was supposed to come across as! Interesting characters, actual death and loss (the death of Phil was a sad but realistic plot point), and Nathan (Justin) actually has a friend in school (WOW!) whom he talks to regularly about his issues! Another thing I couldn't stand about the US version was the annoying Debbie...my God, what a clown! Hazel (UK Debbie) was far more realistic, more maternal 'fag hag' than over-the-top  crazy, radical-left mum. Yeah she parties, but at least she doesn't have crazy buttons on her shirt and act like a 12 year old kid in a 40 year old's body.

Vince was also a few notches above Michael as a character--slightly immature, yes, but also very realistic and adult-like (I could actually believe he was a store manager), unlike Michael who was just so pathetically whiny and immature that I felt like fast forwarding whenever he came on screen.

All in all, see the UK version that generated all the fanfare and controversy, you won't regret it!!",1123286400,11,1400,4.702040816326531
1420798,4,B00005B3Z5,"Sometimes it makes a difference which version of a show you see first.

I was actually suprised when I saw the U.K. version. Usually, I ALWAYS like the European version of a production much better than the American remake. But not in this case. Maybe it's partly because I saw the U.S. version first, which is more glitzy and glamourous, but the UK version actually bored me. I didn't like the dialogue as much (had nothing to do with the Manchester accents)for one. For another, I kept comparing the Stuart character to the Brian character. Aiden Gillen (as Stuart) can't hold a candle to Gale Harold (as Brian) in the sexiness department. Also, I had a hard time believing that Stuart(that slight somewhat girly guy) was this huge Canal Street Stud! And, I'm used to the strong dance/pop/rock/trance musical backdrop of the U.S. version, instead of that folksy guitar score in the U.K. version.

Since I saw the more dramatic, faster paced, glitzier U.S. version first, the U.K. version seemed boring. If I had seen the grittier, slower paced, artsy-er, more realistic U.K. version first, then I would probably think that the U.S. version was too over-the-top. And I might also think that Brian was too tall!

Nevertheless, the U.K. version is a fine show.",1111795200,13,1258,4.841860465116279

It blasts through the conventional and cliche with it's riveting portrayl of the characters and the unique challenges they face. All of the characters are well-rounded, and generally defy any stereotype of ""gay"" out there in some way. Aidan Gillen's Stuart Allen Jones is visceral and compelling, but could not possibly survive without the nuanced performances of of the actors who play Vince and Nathan. I fell in love with all the characters by the end. The series is also replete with great comedic moments that often celebrate the characters' resillence in the face of queer opression.

1420800,5,B00005B3Z5,"While the American version of QAF focuses on sensationalism and sleaze, the original British version takes a more artistic approach to presenting gay life.  Sure there are sex scenes, and soap operish situations, but they are handled in a more realistic manner.  Watching this rich version of QAF is like watching a really good independent film.  The acting is solid, the characters are multi-dimensional, and the writing is top-notch.  Unlike the American version, drugs and backrooms are downplayed in UK's version of QAF.  The only time drugs come into play is when one of the characters dies from an overdose.",1087430400,4,613,5.09
1420801,4,B00005B3Z5,"Having been a major fan of the American QAF, it was great recently to see the British.
Like a lot of folks have said, the initial story line is almost identical, just treated in a different way.  British is faster paced and funnier, especially after you get used to the Manchester working class slang.  But the faster pace keep the characters from having quite as much depth, although I like how the relationship between Stuart and Vince turns out more than Brian and Mike.  But I'm more of a romantic about stuff like that.
And the British is far more authentic in its approach to the working class culture.  The American boys claim Pittsburg working class roots, but they behave like middle class suburbans.
Overall though, I like the larger cast, more complex story and character development of the American version.  And there's nothing in the British that comes even close to the impact of the last show of season 1 American, especially for someone who's been through a similar situation as what happened to Justin.  That one episode did more to heal my old emotional pains than years of counselling could ever hope to!!  I also think the way the American told the story of Mike's 30th birthday was much better set up and followed through to a logical conclusion than Vince's 30th on the British.

The writing, the acting, the sets, the sex: all of it added to the allure of this realistic and unapologetic show. I subsequently learned that it was a remake of a show first produced in Great Britain, so I looked into getting a copy of it.
In the British version of QAF, I found a much more gritty, dark, sardonic, and realistic look at gay life. This version is not so caught up in American political correctness or spoon-fed messages. Don't get me wrong; I love the American version... in fact, it's probably my favorite as a total package. But the British version's attitudes about life and death - epitomized clearly by the death of their friend - is more truthful and less subjected to pop culture.

The British version was ground breaking television when it was shown on Channel 4, a channel that you do not need cable or a satalite dish to watch by the way.  The characters are believable and believe me they exist, I live in the city where it was filmed and you can see them any night of the week along Canal Street.  Stuart is a revelation, one minute you hate him for something that he has either done or said then the next you love him because he has redeemed himself, but his US counterpart Brian just doesn't have the same edge about him.  I am currently watching the US version which I find really enjoyable but it is just not as sharp as the UK version, yes the guys are better looking and can I say that Michael is a cutie but give me the British version anytime, anyone buying this version will not be disappointed it shows gay life in Manchester as it is, raw, funny and true to life!",1030320000,6,1049,4.251256281407035
1420808,4,B00005B3Z5,"I watched the first series of QAF when it aired in the UK and it was pretty ground breaking stuff over here. This was mainly due to the gritty storylines and its 'no holes barred' approach. I loved the series as it was refreshing to see gay storylines that weren't all about HIV and queer bashing (which is all you got previously on british TV). I disagree with some of the other reviewers as I thought it was really well acted and the casting was fantastic.
The american QAF has just started to be aired on cable over here and I found it a little disappointing though still enjoyable. Me and many of my mates were really excited when we heard HBO were releasing an american version. Even Russell T Davies (the writer of britsh QAF) hailed it as fantastic. Yes the actors are much more attractive and there's more nudity and better sex scenes, but if thats all you want from a series, go and get some porn. If you can't watch TV without needing to be titilated the brish series is probably not for you. I personally prefer the series because its not so 'fluffy' and makes you question your own opinions and ideas of gay life. It had to be rougher cause thats life in the UK - no one here would of been able to relate to the beauty of QAF USA. Maybe a british audience expect different things to an american audience. It also appealed to a huge sraight following here because it wasn't incredibly homo-erotic.

QAF is a rattling good story, with characters you can believe in, even if they're larger than life sometimes. (I did wonder how Stuart was able to stick to his high-paid job when all he could think about was SEX, SEX, SEX!) And the laughs come hard and often, even if they're laced with cruelty sometimes.
Much of the enjoyment comes from the couterie surrounding the three main guys: Vince's slutty mother, Alexander, the lesbian couple, and the various tricks that turn up at Stuart's loft.
Whether straight audiences will run for the hills after watching this display of in-your-face gay lib, well I couldn't care less. I love QAF!",1025827200,2,778,4.644927536231884
1420810,5,B00005B3Z5,"I knew the American Showtime version of the British program and am an admitted addict.  While it took me a bit to catch on to it (I was put off by the sex, which seemed sort of soft core porn initially) I am completely under it's spell.  The Showtime version is on hiatus for the summer and I was feeling withdrawl symptoms and went mad and just ordered the original British series plus the movie (part 2).  Did I like it?  Well, yes.  The first package (part one) is exactly the same story line as the American version.  Same story but different attitude.  It sees the story from a very different perspective.  While I found this a trifle disconcerting at first, I at last settled into it and went with the flow.  Of course this is a much shorter verson (6 hours) and so it cannot by it's nature be an ongoing story.  Once I was reconciled to the differences, I loved it.  The story, as I have said, is the same and we have the same characters......but they are different.  Nathan (Justin in the Showtime program) loves Stuart but is not immobilized by it (he is also 15!  Yikes).  He is a force of nature and not the least bit as single minded about Stuart (Brian) as his American counterpart.  Vince (Michael) is a bit more inept in all respects, but just as loveable and endearing.  And Stuart is the most disappointing and also, somehow, the most refreshing change from the Showtime character.  His motives are more obvious and his reactions more predictable.  But eventually, I ended up loving Stuart.  DVD 2 is a revelation.  A complete departure from the American version, this wraps up the whole thing.  There can really be no more QAF (this version), and you wouldn't want it after this finish,  The conclusion was masterful.  Concentrating on the love Stuart (Brian) and Vince (Michael) have for one another, it explores areas the Showtime series has pretty much abandoned.  I LOVED IT.  Bravo.  Check it out.

The acting is definitely way better.  If you have a hard time understanding the thick Manchester accent, turn the subtitles on.

1420812,5,B00005B3Z5,"I loved this mini-series so much that I forked out the 70 odd quid for the American version just so that I could spend more time with Stuart and Vince (Brian and Michael).
As you might have suspected, I ended up a little disappointed.  This is not because the American version is bad - but it's very different.  I believe it's inferior but that's just my own taste.
The truth is, if you like the American version, you probably wouldn't like the British version and vice versa.
As a reviewer said below, the UK version is grittier, not as glamourous or as ""sweet"".  It's more ambiguous, darker and unapologetically un-PC with few easy ""messages"".  It's also, therefore, more realistic.
Phil's funeral is a great case in point.  As opposed to his American alter-ego who just slipped into a coma, Phil died.  And yes, Stuart and the gang weren't exactly sobbing or even particularly respectful.  But what did you expect?  They're portrayed as self-absorbed wankers - charming and attractive but still basically egotistical.  However, that episode, largely through Vince, voices the series' somewhat ambivalent attitide to aspects of contemporary gay life - something which gives a greater depth and resonance to the whole thing.
However, you can't fault the US series for not doing what it didn't set out to do.
The plot of the original was driven by the largely sexless relationship between Stuart and Vince, and how their unspoken love for each other expressed itself; with Nathan (""The one-night stand that never went away"") acting as an introduction to their world and a catalyst for the story.
Although those of us who love the original might mourn the lack of focus on the central relationship between the main characters - the US version is much much longer and more of an emsemble, so letting that relationship drive the plot makes little sense as there is no defined ending.  And the American version is MEANT to be glitzier and ""easier"" - a sort of gay ""Sex and the City"".  As such, it succeeds very well.  Entertainly eye-candy that can nonetheless be very thought-provoking at times.  If the sex gets a little dull, I just remind myself that, as a straight female, I'm probaby not the best audience for the series.
But ah!! That last scene with Stuart and Vince dancing like complete utter twats to #It's Raining Men# but not giving a folk - that scene proves conclusively that you can both laugh and cry at the same time.  Pure Magic.",1024185600,19,2444,4.774346793349169

Perhaps because I spent time in England, the British version is much better in my eyes. I prefer the Brit actors, and the manner of storytelling, which is less.. uh.. Americanish.

1420817,4,B00005B3Z5,"I had seen 'Queer As Folk' in its original cut in the U.K., and I was dutifully impressed by how realistic, breezily fun and uncompromising this series was.  As sexy, glitzy and prettily-cast the American version is, it doesn't have the heart or depth of the British original.
One of the most obvious things the U.K. version develops better is its characters.  The non-chalant and irresponsible Stuart is not as cut and dry as his American counterpart (though I personally find the American Brian to be more attractive), and the multi-dimensional character is served by a more interesting actor.  The hapless character of Vince, with his babbling unease, obsession with 'Doctor Who' and endearing modesty is never hard to watch, and he is played with absolute earnest by Craig Kelly.  Nathan, as played by Charlie Hunnam (late of Fox's 'Undeclared') is a fresh-faced and honest character with a well developed transformation from innocent boy to more worldly young man.
Without the need to stretch stories out for whole seasons at a time, this miniseries is able to spend just enough time on all the fun and serious moments which comprise the plots of these 8 episodes.  While this series isn't as graphic or as dependent on sex as the Showtime version, it certainly has more than its fair share of controversial situations and characters, and as a result it is a far more daring and relevant production.
The DVDs are a bare-bones presentation of the series, condensing all 8 episodes into 4, and editing some scenes while severely altering the soundtrack into basically a series of generic (read: cheap) dance tracks.  While the original score is left largely untouched, there is no 'Sexy Boy' or 'It's Raining Men' for instance in the C1 version, which is disappointing to say the least, as the songs chosen for the original soundtrack added so much.  There are no extra features of any kind on the DVD - a scene selection menu and subtitles would have been in order at least.
In the end, this is a must-see miniseries, a triumph for television and a tribute not only to the gay lifestyle, but to good old-fashioned smart dialogue and honest characterization.  The skeleton DVD and the annoying C1 edits may diminish things slightly, but not to those who have never seen it before - it's such a compelling and sincerely fun series.  Gritty, frank and unapologetic, the British 'Queer As Folk' is a testament to truth and realism, obscuring nothing but serving to open many eyes.",1008806400,42,2480,4.85781990521327

1420822,5,B00005B3Z5,"""Queer as Folk"" Series One shows most of the famous British television series centered on a cluster of gay male friends and acquaintances in Manchester. Unlike most similar ensemble attempts, there are serious, substantial linkings out to the men's families, workplaces, schools, and lesbian friends. This produces a well-rounded depiction of contemporary gay male life in the U.K. and a sense of the variety of responses and accommodations gays and straights make for one another.
The core of the drama is the ostensibly unrequited love retail manager Vince Tyler (played by Craig Kelly) has for long-time friend, publicist and seduction phenom Stuart Jones (played by Aidan Gillen). The drama kicks off with the coming out of 15 year old student Nathan Maloney (played by Charlie Hunnam), who starts off with Stuart, irritating Vince. Complications, subplots, and a variety of potential love interests all intertwine, coming to a satisfying conclusion to Series One. Series Two continues the Series One story reasonably well.
The Manchester accent and some local slang appear throughout. Some replays may be needed to get the exact words spoken. There is a script book (with photos) available of the detailed, pre-shooting script. The TV/video/DVD final version has a number of small improvements on the original. You might check it out.
The major actors are all brilliant. Surprisingly, the minor actors are too. The plot lines are all reasonable enough, the characters evolve plausibly, and actors look and play their ages. Production values and photography are first rate. ""Queer as Folk"" is simply the best gay ensemble movie ever.

However, I find the casting significantly flawed to the point that it detracts from believability..... and one cannot suspend disbelief in a show so ""realistically"" accesorised. Stuart, the character at the center of things, the UK's original for our Brian, just isn't ""drop dead gorgeous"" nor does he pair well with Nathan (the Brit version of our principal twink). Physicality intrudes..... Nathan, young Charlie Hunnam, is tall and Aiden Gillen is medium to short ..... Their Brian just does not seem written as comanding or interesting as ours, and has been cast small ... whatever possessed them? Mr. Gillen's  size and demeanor detract from an already palely-written central character.... no hint of the force or magnetism such central character is attributed by everyone else. Thus there is a fatal weakness at the core (note: Mr. Gillen may be a fine actor, but I think he is totally, and for the series, fatally miscast). If the American series had not come along, I probably would have viewed this one differently..... I am grateful the Brits did it. But now it truly deserves gratitude and most definitely second place.

We're middle-aged urban Americans, but we identified very much with the universality of this younger British milieu--some things transcend time and place. It's inspiring to see gay themes treated on the screen with such intelligence, wit and maturity. We've come a long way. No lectures here. No moralizing. No black & white heroes and villians. Just some real, complicated, flawed but loveable characters struggling with how to be happy and proud in an imperfect world.  We wish the DVD made better use of providing additional materials; more background on the actors, writers and such would have been appreciated.

The series was surrounded by a blaze of controversy after the first episode with some of the most graphic, gay scenes shown on British Network Television. The obvious outrage from critics came in the fact that it showed a 29 year gay man having sex with a mere 15 year old. But these situations, however immoral they may seem, do occur and the writers rightly intended to focus on thses subjects. So what emerges are eight grittily realistic episodes with fine blends of comedy mixed in giving it a great balance and these were undoubtedly the ingredients to its smash hit success.
The absolutley drop dead gorgeous, Aiden Gillen has the most lengthy role of Stuart Jones. In his startling realistic portrayal he conveys two sides to Stuart - the cocky, arrogant gay man with a chip on his shoulder about being gay, and a side to him that showed that there was just a lonley, screwed up man inside who feared telling his parents and was therefore seemingly blackmailed by his sister. If there were not these two dimensions to the character it possibly wouldn't have worked so Aiden Gillen gets top marks for his role although the other two players show their own versatality with Craig kelly as Vince Tyler providing some of the more humorous and lighthearted moments. His fascination with Doctor Who and his continual bad luck when ever he takes a man home for a night of passion are hilarious at times. It's a very likeable and beleavable performance whilst Charlie Hunnam's portrayal of 15 year old Nathan Maloney who had just come out of the closet most likely had a host of young teenagers in the closet idntifying with his character. The character of Nathan is out the closet with a vengeance and is obviously still confused but is seemingly desperate to ease his way into the gay scene. Notably other good performances comes from Carla Henry as Nathans loyal friend, Donna, who raises a smile with her feel good factor and Denise Black as Vince's fun loving, down to earth mother, Hazel Tyler. She is also an essential part of the series who provides a lot of the laughs.
The first four episodes of the series is a lot of fun and games although it has a darker undertone where the character, Phil, overdoses on heroin whilst the funeral of Phil that takes place in episode 4 is played out almost like black comedy. The second half of the series seems to settle down into storylines that build to the final such as centering on vince's relationship with an  Aussie business man, played by Peter 'O Brian.
Writer Russell T Davies strikingly realistic view of the gay lifestyle is immpecable and that is complimented by the great team of actors involved and as far as i'm concerned if people are that outraged by it then 1) Why watch it in the first place and 2) If they're offended then its simple - just switch channels!! It was a very welcome and pleasant change to have a series focusing on the lives of gay men especially tp a series that seemed overly accurate. Any gay man will be able to identify with one of the characters and this is where a lot of the enjoyment comes in.
However Quuer As Folk 2 pales slightly in comparison to the first series. It's a two part special concluding the series and there are some fine moments and performances are great but the gritty realism that was part of the first series is slightly lost and the ending where Stuart and Vince finally get together is great as fantasy but you can't truly believe in it. Adequate is the best way of describing the sequel but the first series is a masterpiece and a true classic, accompanied by a sizzling soundtrack. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!!",991008000,6,3779,4.606824925816023
1420833,5,B00005B3Z5,"This DVD contains the first series - 4 hours on two discs - of *Queer as Folk* as it was originally seen on television in the U.K.  I hesitated for awhile, wondering whether it was worth the rather steep price for two discs.  (Actually, I didn't know how many discs there were -- search as you might, I dare you to find that information here).  Plus, I wasn't crazy about the what I saw of the U.S. version. Finally, I'm always scared by films and television from the U.K. because the regional accents are often indecipherable to my Yankee ear.  Anyway, I bought it and I'm glad I did.
First, I had no problem with the accents or the regional idioms.  All the ""shagging"" and ""wanking"" wore off on me a bit, actually. (""Do you think ov'im when you av'a wank?  No?  Then ee's your Boyfriend alright."") The teleplay is flawless.  Other reviewers are better at synopsis than I am.  The point is, it's how the story's told that really sells this.
The ensemble cast, led by Aiden Gillen, Craig Kelly, and Charlie Hunnam is terrific.  Where the U.S. show had guys who really looked good but weren't very interesting, this show has more or less normal, but still good looking guys who look better and better as you get to know them.  As Stuart, Aiden Gillen, for example, plays a character who ""doesn't even have to work for it.""  But it's not so much that he's a god, physically, it's rather his attitude, which is so much more complicated than the voracious party boy he pretends to be.  Craig Kelly broke my heart as Vince, Stuart's best friend, who apparently has been smitten by Stuart since they were both 12.  And Charlie Hunnam swipes every scene he's in as Nathan, the 15 year old who starts out as a victim-waiting-to-happen, and ends up a hero, both to himself and to his adopted community.  The setting is realistic too:  straight people who run the gamut from insane homophobes to fellow-travelers; and gay people who have carved for themselves a community, but who have also found out that the world isn't ""Will and Grace"" and liberation is an inside job.
This show never panders to those who want easy or politically correct answers, or who want everything to be tied up nicely in a bow.  Instead, it overflows with insight.  Inthe U.S. version, this seems mere melodrama.  Here, it works on so many dramatic levels.  One of the best things to be said about it is that it truly is ""made for t.v.""  Which is to say that it totally exploits and expands the medium.  I could no more imagine this on the big screen than on the stage.  It does, in other words, everything that T.V. should do and none of the things it shouldn't.
There's a lot of sex in the show, some of it more steamy than most U.S. viewers have ever seen on the tube (not counting HBO), but it's never played for shock value.  It propels the story.  It's honest. And yes, it's erotic.
So the bottom line is, this is a very fine show, and you're not likely to see it if you don't buy it.  So if you *can* afford it, you probably should.",990576000,99,3006,4.42

I was only able to view the disk on my computer's DVD-ROM with no problems.
The disk, by the way, is not region coded.
The story is great, with the exception of the drug stuff. Nobody I know does drugs other than an occasional joint. Are British young people really as drug-soaked as QAF and Trainspotting seem to show? The acting is excellent and the characters are believable.

1420845,3,B00005B3Z5,"After carefully examining both versions, I am moved by the US version simply because it's relates to my cultural lifestyle and the influences America embraces. I won't say the British series is ""less of"" in any way. Both versions have their merits but an All-American gay boy coming from the US will most certainly relate much better with the US version simply because of ""culture"" which in-turn will make it far more entertaining and easier to understand. I wouldn't say making something easier to understand ""dumb downed."" That's just a cheap shot as far as I am concerned in doing a fair review. America is just beginning to understand the whole ""gay community"" and it's philosophies (if it has any) <grin>. QAF-USA has developed a huge audience made of not only gay people but everyone!  Education seems to be the main focus for this series as many of it's stars and producers... convey in their chat interviews. The US version is most certainly made to educate and entertain, which it most certainly does. The British version (although educates somewhat) seems more in tune to entertain the audience. Rightly so! The British version broke new ground and pushed the envelope on the way Europeans watch prime time TV. That's something that will probably never happen in America-so BRAVO for the UK! If you really want to have a smidgen of understanding the ""core"" story, I suggest you purchase the first 8 episode DVD British version first and then start watching the more amplified characterization in the US version. You'll see why the US series is quickly becoming one of the most popular and most successful television shows in history. I also suggest you purchase the kickin US soundtrack, which will most certainly get you in the QAF mood. Cheers!",988156800,4,1756,4.89261744966443

Each version has its own twists to similar situations and each is true to its environment - I do appreciate the uniqueness of each. If you love watching folks, you will love this. While living in the San Francisco area probably contributed to my initial tuning in of the American version, the stories and the character developments have hooked me - some remind me of tales of activities in San Francisco in the 1970s.  Can't wait until the American version is released on DVD. I don't think I am part of the QaF target audience since I am female, over 50, married and heterosexual, but these stories are great.",987984000,3,724,4.612403100775194
1420847,5,B00005B3Z5,"The British ""Queer as Folk"" is witty, intelligent, well-written, well-acted, and incredibly entertaining. The American version is dumbed down; the punchlines sound like they belong on a sitcom, and the creators seem intent on hitting us over the head rather than observing. Where the American version particularly suffers is in the character of Brian. Stuart in the British version (played by Aidan Gillen) has such presence and vitality that it's impossible not to watch him. His charisma makes him likeable; we can root for him despite his smug self-confidence. Brian, by comparison, is a piece of dead wood that just walked out of GQ. I just wanted him to go away. The American version also uses flashy ""MTV-style"" editing in a effort to look cool, I guess, but it's really just annoying.
I could go on, but you get the idea. Watch the British version. (And as for the person who wrote that the Brits don't have it in the looks department...you don't know what you're talking about.)",987465600,10,986,4.875

I had to see what the British original was like. Having seen them both now, I couldn't say which I prefer. There are aspects of character development in the US version that are more fully rounded. But the shorter ""arc"" of the British version makes it more focused and intense. The development of the Stuart (Brian) character is done better in the British series. There were times when I was laughing out loud and times when I was moved to tears. I recommend both and each for their unique take on a group of characters that I've come to love whatever their nationality.

1420850,5,B00005B3Z5,"As someone who has the benefit of watching PAL (British/European) formatted video, I'm fortunate to have the original release of QAF 1 and 2 from the UK.  This is the series that started it all. While the American version of this series has definitely improved and the actors have gotten more comfortable in their roles, I have to say I still find the British version superior with respect to acting and with the more gritty, realistic view of what gay life is like in a working class city.  The American version is still a bit polished and its portrayal of the gay nightlife is a bit surreal.  While the American version pushes the sex envelope a bit further than the UK version, you have to realize that in the UK this was shown on Channel Four, which would be an equivalent of NBC in America.  Imagine NBC (or ABC or CBS or anything not on a premium cable channel) showing this!! As the analogy goes, America is cutting edge with violence and the British with sex.  The original version is definitely worth getting your hands on.  I think you'll find the characters are multidimensional and considerably more realistic. (and if you have the capability to play PAL tapes, buy these tapes from amazon.co.uk as they include the original soundtrack which is far superior to the sad thing they had to do these tapes to comply with licensing them in North America).",987292800,25,1362,4.630705394190872

I can see how the American version pretty much came from this British version.  The American version is several years long, so there was more time to develop each of the characters.  This British version was only a little more than one season with a total of 10 episodes (8 half hour episodes and 2 one hour episodes).  So, this version seems a bit rushed, but pretty much all of the characters are the same as the American version, and each character is a bit less developed which meant the viewer don't get to sympathize with each character as much.  Sometimes, there was even confusion as to the relationships of the characters until later in the story.  None the less, the acting was similar to the American version--pretty good, but emotionally, I was less attached to the characters.  The sex scenes in the British version seems more tamed than the American version when I expected the opposite being that British television is generally more liberal.
