2053291,4,B00020W010,"as with the rest of the happy tree friends dvds, this one is extremely funny, but incredibly short. there is 16 episodes and at least with these, they are about a half a minute longer then the episodes on the other 2 discs. i would have thought that they would have ran out of ideas by this time, but they keep on finding more and more ways to offend and make you laugh. anyone with a sick sense of humor will love this and there are plenty of extras to keep you busy for the somewhat disappointing length. here is a list of the episodes:
milkin it
out of sight, out of mime
class act
the way you make me wheel
better off bread
i get a trick out of you
shard at work
water way to go
out on a limb
keeping it reel
a hard act to swallow
let it slide
icy you
hello dolly
books of fury
dino-sore days
might i add to pay attention to the titles of the episodes. any of you who don't know what the happy tree friends are and see this in amazon for the first time, yes it is a cartoon, no it is not for kids, yes it is sick, no you do not need a rating, yes keep it away from kids, and no it is not like spongebob. it is a great way to gross out your unsuspecting friends and i would have to say that these are grosser then the first 2 dvds, so enjoy.",1093651200,7,1244,3.8255813953488373

Their third release, Third Strike Vol 3, showcases some of their best episodes!  This sick cartoon makes you wince, squirm and turn away from the TV with fear - I love them!

If you haven't visited their website, here's the address: [...]  You can see a few episode for free and decide before you buy.  This is a unique cartoon experience that is NOT for the kids!",1093305600,7,506,4.397849462365591

8019654,5,B00020W010,My kids and I really enjoy this show and we love to watch how they all have accidents and flippy freaks out all the time. The seller sent it fast I got it on time it was in the condition the seller claimed we're very happy.,1355097600,,223,3.869565217391304

8019656,5,B00020W010,"There are a few reasons why you wouldn't like happy tree friends, 1.your'e squimish, 2.you don't like violence, or 3.you have never seen it.  If you don't fall in any of these catogories there is no reason for you not to love it.  What's funnier than watching a bear in a green beret uniform put a live grenade into a rabbits hand after being impaled several times.

I'm not weird, and I don't plan on turning into a deranged pyschopath, but I love Happy Tree Friends.  The first time I saw it I watched 25 more episodes, and I was humming the song all day.

I'm about to buy this DVD, so I can't say for sure what's on it is good, BUT IT'S GOT FLIPPY THE BEAR ON THE COVER. COME ON, IT'S GOT TO BE GOOD.

I'm also going to buy the other two DVDs, you can't go wrong with Happy Tree Friends.",1119139200,7,791,4.070967741935484
8019657,5,B00020W010,"While I do not worship the show, I do find it's humor quite appealing. No, I'm not sick, but let me illuminate as to why this show is so wildly popular

The show started as an internet movie. It features a varity of cute little animals that resemble care-bears crossed with teletubbies(the unintelligble dialogue) and a bit of saturday morning nonsense thrown in. But there's a catch: these are not care bears and these are NOT Saturday morning cartoons. The little animals are put into horribly, gut-wrenchingly funny scenarios of their own death and doom. If you hate care bears and love violence, you'll adore Happy Tree Friends.

Although the theme is the same, the situations and death are always differnet. Showing these to a friend is a treat, as you can watch their horrified faces as one of the animals gets hurled into a jet engine(after losing both his arms at the elbow, of course).

Now, wether or not you'll find this funny is really up to you, Do you laugh at violent humor so long as no one gets hurt? Or do you honstly think Grand Theft Auto has turned the next generation into car-jacking, hooker killing hoodlums? If you are the later, why are you even LOOKING at Happy Tree Friends? You should be ashamed of yourself... go lock yourself in a meat locker and say 1000 hail-Mary's before you decide to go outside again. If your the first... what do you care what people think about you? BUY THE DAMN DISC!",1117756800,,1423,4.572549019607843
8019658,5,B00020W010,"Hey there! I'm gonna go ahead and say that THIS IS NOT FOR FREAKIN' KIDS! Everyone has said it, but people are giving it a bad rating just because there kids saw it or it's not for kids. For God sakes, it says that on the box! Now, If you love cute and cuddley animals with happy endings, get the hell off this page! For those people with a sick and twisted sense of violant humor (like me), you'll love it. In this you have little cute animals getting ripped in half, getting thier intestines spewed everywhere, and all that good stuff. If your like me, it's something to die for! Hah! Pun!",1116720000,10,591,4.238938053097345
8019659,5,B00020W010,"I am appaled at this particular situation, I can't believe that my kids saw this...and I don't mean happy tree friends... I mean the ugly ass typing of you stupid hippie douche republicans who keep complaining about the not for kids warning!  This show will not effect kids...Who cares if they see violence, it doesn't mean they're going to kill people, so stop complaining, and learn to take responsiblity for your kids problems instead of blaming them on video games and stupid little cartoons, you ass chins... thank you... HAPPY TREE FRIENDS IS AWSOME!",1113004800,5,556,4.914893617021277
8019660,5,B00020W010,"NOT FOR KIDS.  It is animated, but it makes fun of all the insipid animation out there today by killing them, or putting them in the most painful situations imaginable.  You're supposed to squirm and cover you eyes at some of the humor because it's not even thinly veiled with its dislike and massacre of the animals.  It is very funny if you like gallows humor and/or splatter films.  What you get are very short (less than 2 minutes usually)films where different animals usually die very grotesque deaths in what are supposed to be extremely happy places and situations.  The producers of this show which is also on the internet have given the DVD customer lots of extra special goodies to enjoy.  Commentaries for all of the episodes that include the animatics, commentaries on the commentaries,  and special sound effects commentary.  They have fan artwork, a feature that allows you to access special material while watching the episodes and few extra episodes that also come complete with animatics and commentaries.  There are a few extras, but those should be for you to discover and enjoy.  However, THIS IS NOT FOR KIDS.",1110758400,5,1130,4.869109947643979

The photos of the ""Happy Tree Friends"" DVDs on the amazon.com website are small photos. The photos are not big enough for customers to see the ""not for children"" warning in the photos. My review was written to try and warn customers that are ages 5-16 that this product was made to be purchased and viewed by adults, and not for children who are 5-16. The ""not for children"" warning can't be seen on amazon.com. The review was written to tell people about the ""not for children"" nature of this DVD. If you are 17 or older, please view this DVD and decide for yourself if the DVD is  good, bad, or somewhere in between.",1108339200,3,734,4.242857142857143
