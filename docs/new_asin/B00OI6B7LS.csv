6751476,2,B00OI6B7LS,This is in French with subtitles.  This is fine...if you're expecting it.,1441411200,,73,5.083333333333333
6751477,3,B00OI6B7LS,"Based on a graphic novel of the same title by Posy Simmonds (which I have not read), Gemma Bovary is a French tragicomedy about an English woman Gemma Bovary (Gemma Arterton), who has moved in to a small community in Normandy with his husband Charlie (Jason Flemyng). Gemma befriends neighbor Martin Joubert (Fabrice Luchini), a local baker who had worked for a publisher in Paris for twelve years  and whose favorite book is, of course, Madame Bovary.

Martin is naturally surprised at the name of the charming new neighbor. Moreover, he is obsessed with the idea that Gemma is retreading the same fate of Flauberts heroine, as he sees parallels between the lives of Emma and Gemma. You should never buy a rat poison, he says to her because it contains arsenic.

Directed by Anne Fontaine (known for Dry Cleaning and more recently Coco avant Chanel), the film benefits from the fine acting from the two leads Arterton and Luchini, but the characters themselves are rather flat. In fact, Artertons Gemma looks beautiful, and more than one male is attracted to her, which is only natural, but none of these males is given depth enough for us to interest their complicated relationships.

And the relationships certainly suggest something about male-female roles, but whatever it is, it is not fully developed. Gemma Bovary suffers from the uneven script (which does the film want to be, light comedy or serious drama?) and the unfocused narrative (whose story is it?), but is still worth watching for charming Gemma Artertons performance.",1439856000,4,1537,4.968871595330739
6751478,4,B00OI6B7LS,"""Gemma Bovery"" (2014 release from France; 100 min.) brings the story of the title character. As the movie opens, we meet Martin, who has moved back to Normandy with his wide to take over his dad's bakery. One day, an English couple move next door to Martin's, and he is astonished to learn that their names are Charlie and Gemma Bovery. It isn't long before Martin, a big fan of the 19th century French writer Gustave Flaubert, whose debut novel Madame Bovary was written in Normandy. To tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: first, this is the latest movie from French director Anne Fontaine, best known for ""Coco Before Chanel"" and ""Adore"". Second, according to the movie's opening credits, the film is in fact loosely based on/inspired by Flaubert's Madame Bovary book, but of course transposed to today. I was charmed by how cleverly there is the interplay between the movie and the book. Check out the scene at the cathedral in Rouen, which is also a key moment in the book. Third, the movie has plenty of pleasant performances, but let's be honest: if it wasn't for the beauty and the charm of Gemma Arterton, this movie goes nowhere. She plays it perfectly, as it's a thin line between charming innocent flirting and being the easy girl. Kudos also to Fabrice Luchini as Martin. Bottom line: this is a lighthearted from-com with a nice literary twist to it.

Imagine my surprise when this movie opened without any prerelease fanfare or buzz at my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati. I figure this will not be playing long, so I went to see it today. The early evening screening where I saw this at was quite well attended, somewhat to my surprise, mostly leaning towards seniors, I might add. If you are in the mood for a charming French rom-com that is as easy on the eyes as it is on your brains, you cannot go wrong with this. ""Gemma Bovery"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1439596800,12,1987,4.610169491525424
6751479,5,B00OI6B7LS,"This delightful offering to the 2015 Seattle International Film Festival was submitted by France (captions when appropriate). Directed by Anne Fontaine (""The Girl From Monaco"") we see a fairly wealthy, semi- retired Parisian move his wife and son to a quiet country village in Normandy where he decides to become the local baker.

They live not too far from where Gustave Flaubert placed his tragic heroine Madame Bovary to play out her ill-fated romances.

When an English couple moves to the neighborhood, our hero is intrigued to learn that their last name is Bovery. His restless imagination quickly shifts into overdrive!

We watch:
  * Fabrice Luchini (""Intimate Strangers"" and ""The Girl From Monaco"") is Martin, our gentleman baker. He keeps an eye on this couple because he can see that the wife is considerably younger than the husband. As Martin becomes jealous of her attractions for other men, he confides in his faithful dog!
  * Gemma Arterton (""Pirate Radio"") is Gemma, whose light sprinkle of freckles on her nose makes her irresistible to men, young and old.
  * Jason Flemyng (""Snatch"") is her husband Charlie, underemployed but very much in love with her.
  * Niels Schneider (""Atomic Age"") is Herv de Bressigny, her young,VERY  handsome neighbor.
  * Mel Raido (Lots of TV) is Patrick, a famous fellow who shares a history with our heroine.

The camera loves Luchini's face and we laugh as we watch his fixation grow. There are many side notes: arsenic, a Sevres porcelain sculpture, Gemma's curiosity about various French breads, the rain, etc., etc., etc.... But his son gets the last laugh.

We giggled when we shouldn't have, then exited to the bus stop eager to discuss our favorite parts. I'll get the DVD when it is either cheaper or available in Region 1. I DO want the DVD for my library.",1430611200,15,1817,4.888888888888889

Read the above twice and take it to heart, then you may well enjoy this little piece. I love film and adore Gemma Arterton and while the setting is beautiful, there is an awkwardness to this movie. On reflection, the film succumbs to a bee's sting or at least suffers greatly from that point.

6751627,5,B00OI6B7LS,"As an American learning to speak French, I thoroughly enjoyed this film from several aspects. The scenery was delightful and reminded me of my trips to France. Martin, wonderfully portrayed by Fabrice Luchini, befriends an English couple that has relocated to Normandy. I could visualize the dreamer in him as he transposed Gemma (Gemma Arterton) into Madame Bovary through his view of  her and her actions.  Personally, I liked the transitions between the French and English languages and was not bothered at all by the subtitles and for most of the film was able  to tune them out. A romantic myself, I could grasp the longing that Gemma had and relate when she comments ""that is is good because it won't last long."" Though I watched this film with my Prime membership, this is one I intend to purchase and watch again. I enjoyed the characters depth and soulfulness which they projected upon the screen. Overall, it was a delightful way to spend an afternoon in Normandy.",1451692800,6,974,4.820359281437126

Model Gemma Arterton, who was Strawberry Fields in a Bond flick, takes the lead, intoxicating men while her silly neighbor injects himself her life. Seems most of the men in this movie are silly, a twist from the book, where Mdm. Bovary is the twit.  Has humorous moments; not as serious and dour as many French films.",1451174400,,389,4.63768115942029
6751630,4,B00OI6B7LS,"""Gemma Bovery"" was a pleasant find on a dull Sunday afternoon. I have watched numerous screen adaptations of Gustave Flaubert's ""Madame Bovary"" and was curious to see what this French film had to offer. It is a more light-hearted take on Flaubert's original and once you get past that and don't go looking for deeper undertones, this turns out to be quite wonderful indeed.

Gemma Arterton portrays the bored title character, who together with her older husband, Charlie (Jason Flemyng) uproot themselves from London and decamp to bucolic and provincial Normandy where Charlie focuses on his antiques' restoring business. Their neighbor across the street is baker Martin (Fabrice Luchini) who also happens to be a diehard Flaubert fan and can't get over the similarities between the novel and the real life couple across the street. He also becomes infatuated with Gemma and the scenes between him and Gemma are some of the highlights of the film - the banter, the end of Martin's self-confessed ""10 years of sexual tranquility"", ""erotic"" scenes in the bakery, and more. The dialogue between the two gets hysterical at times with one particular scene involving Gemma saying ""suck me"" to the stupefied Martin, meriting repeat viewings for its comical attributes.

Of course, this being after all a take on Flaubert's work, our titular character soon gets embroiled in a passionate affair with the dashing young local squire, Bressigny, both indulging in steamy encounters at Bressigny's seen-better-days' chateau. And just like in Flaubert's work, it all comes crashing down eventually, but not quite in the manner of the original. I've watched this twice now, not because it's a faithful adaptation of Flaubert's classic (it is decidedly not), but because I so enjoy Luchini's wonderful performance (his facial expressions and hang-dog looks simply speak volumes) and of course Gemma Arterton's ethereal portrayal of a modern-day equivalent of the bored and unfulfilled wife.

Forced to sit through five trailer adverts for other movies.
Positives:
Note the spelling difference in the name. Lots of British type humor bordering between a little shocking and funny.
So what happens when a British couple end up living in the France of Flaubert and by coincidence they share many of the same attributes as well as a similarity in name to that famous novel?
Add a next-door baker as a storyteller who is also infatuated with the mystique of women from those period novels.
""Gemma Bovery"" offers a contemporary interpretation that I found more interesting than other recent adaptations of the story especially with regards to manipulating men. ""Wants everything from love and is always disappointed."" When life doesn't match her fantasy one wonders if she would have changed or would she have eventually recidivated? Great endings as her men lead to her humorously ironic downfall and finally the introduction of a famously storied Russian woman.

Surprising song (as an odd fit) shows up in the movie and in the credits - ""Jimmy"" with no identifiable credit. Anyway, from a mongrel American/European blues/folk/rock team, ""Moriarty"".",1445299200,,1163,5.1861702127659575

6751665,5,B00OI6B7LS,"Art imitates art in this off-the-wall bizzaro-world French-British comedy.

The light-hearted, good-natured wackiness starts when Gemma Bovery moves from London, England into a house in the Normandy countryside of France.  One of her neighbors is Martin Joubert, who had moved to the countryside 12 years before after leaving a Paris book publishing company to take over his deceased father's boulengerie, bakery, to bake bread.

As it happens, Martin and his wife are both reading ""Madame Bovary"" written by French novelist Gustave Flaubert, a 19th Century world renowned novel about a bored housewife who has an affair behind the back of her husband, Charles. When Martin finds out his neighbor's first and last names, he's stunned. But delighted. She's young and pretty, best of all, she's living nearby.

This movie, directed by Anne Fontaine, is mostly in French with some English. The two lead roles, Martin Joubert  and Gemma Bovery, are played by Fabrice Luchini, and Gemma Arterton. Both put in sterling performances in this rom-com spoof. The plot and subplot of the great French novel ""Madame Bovary"" carries this hilarious movie. Bored with her elderly husband, Charlie Bovery"" who is often out of town, Gemma has an affair with a younger man, who happens to be her neighbor, Herve. Her other neighbor, Martin, catches them by standing outside the window. He keeps his mouth shut about the affair, although  he wishes it were him having a tryst with the voluptuous neighbor.

Kudos goes to both Luchini and Arterton. Luchini, one of my favorite French actors, who is rip-roaring funny as the lascivious and concerned neighbor. In one scene, a bee stings Arterton, and Luchini unzips the back of her dress in the good name of chivalry. And finds the dead insect on the bottom of her back and tries to calm her worrying.

To better understand the movie, it helps to have read Flaubert's famous novel. When the great French writer had it published, he caused quite a stir and sensation Some stores banned it all together. ""Madame Bovary"" is considered one of the great French novels, and Flaubert one of the great French writers.

As far as the scenery in the movie, it's quite authentic. It looks just like the rolling green hills of the Normandy countryside.

In fact, I once ate a dish of ""Les Moules Frites"" in Trouville, Flaubert's hometown, Staring for a while at a statue of Flaubert in Trouville, I had a clear view of his statue. Somehow, however, I felt disappointed that a facsimile of Flaubert's best known character was missing: not in this movie.",1442534400,8,2569,4.939675174013921
