3857728,4,B0026ZQIVW,"Colorado Territory is good quality Saturday afternoon type matinee movie to watch. Picture quality and sound is very good. The Plot is solid  and the location photography makes it a visual treat. I watched it a second time before writing this review and marvelled at the lighting of Virginia Mayo's face.  Joel McCrea and Raoul Walsh work together well. Some good supporting work is performed by the old man McCrea's character befriends on the stage coach - he gets and delivers some good lines. The movie does not highlight Joel McCrea as well as his performances in ""Fort Massacre"" or ""Trooper Hook"", but add to his esteem as a good watchable actor",1328227200,,650,4.794642857142857
3857729,5,B0026ZQIVW,"Joel McCrea and Virginia Mayo are excellent in this 1949 black and white western film about 1871. The two have bad pasts, McCrae as a bank robber and Mayo as a saloon dancer and friend of crooks. Both want to leave the life of crime. The film has some depth due to people not being who they say they are, not wanting what they say they want, and the constant double crosses.

 McCrae is broken out of jail by an old man who wants him to lead a train robbery. He agrees because he is thankful, but insists that this will be his last crime. He meets the daughter of a rancher and decides after a short couple of meetings that he wants to marry her and live on a ranch. But, is the daughter who seems good, really good? And is Mayo who seems bad really bad?

 The gang that he joins up with to rob the train fight with each other because of Mayo, who was brought to the group by one of the crooks. Do the robbers want to see McCrae succeed in the robbery? Is the conductor of the train who is seemingly helping them, really doing so? Can McCrae and May begin a new life, or is it too late?",1315699200,5,1086,4.037209302325581
3857730,5,B0026ZQIVW,"Warner Bros. Pictures presents ""COLORADO TERRITORY"" (1949) (94 min/B&W) -- Starring Joel McCrea, Virginia Mayo, Dorothy Malone, Henry Hull, John Archer & Morris Ankrum

Directed by Raoul Walsh

Outlaw Wes McQueen (Joel McCrea) breaks out of jail and meets up with his gang who are planning a train robbery. He finds them holed up in an old dilapidated Mission, arguing and one of them has a woman with him, a former dance hall girl, Colorado Carson (Virginia Mayo). Wes has decided that he wants to go straight. Having met Lulie Ann Winslow (Dorothy Malone) and her father Fred (Henry Hull), his ideal would be to settle down with her and own his own ranch. Out of loyalty to an old-time partner however, he agrees to go ahead with the train robbery and realizes too late that he is not destined to fulfill his dreams. He and Colorado make a final desperate break when the robbery goes bad.

Colorado Territory is acknowledged by many as a westernized remake of the 1941 crime drama High Sierra.  Raoul Walsh, director of the earlier film, returns to helm the remake, doing a grand job on both occasions. Joel McCrea stars in the Humphrey Bogart role, playing a veteran outlaw who hopes to pull off one last, spectacular heist. Virginia Mayo portrays the Ida Lupino counterpart, a ""bad"" dance-hall girl who proves to be the only person who genuinely cares about McCrea's well-being. As in the earlier film, the climax finds McCrea making a futile bid for escape in the mountains, with tragic consequences.

A stupendous western film - McCrea is tailor made for this role - quietly spoken, well mannered bank robber - but trapped by his ""fate"". Fabulous cinematography (why didn't they film this in color?) and wonderful musical score by David Buttolph.

The teaming of McCrea with Virginia Mayo was to be repeated 8 years later on ""The Tall Stranger"" (1957)

3857731,5,B0026ZQIVW,"JOEL McCREA,VIRGINIA MAYO, EXELLENT COMBINATION FOR THIS WESTERN VERSION OF ""HIGH SIERRA"" FUNNY TO WATCH McCREA AS A ""BADDIE"" REALLY ENJOYED THIS BLACK AND WHITE MOVIE, CAN RECOMMEND!",1285113600,3,183,5.571428571428571
3857732,5,B0026ZQIVW,"A western with a daring and advanced viewpoint for its era. The outlaw is a sympathetic guy with good qualities deep inside. The well brought up girl turns out to be  roothless, and the bad girl with the dissolute past and the exposed legs turns out to be devoted. The tragical couple seems to defy destiny and allthough it is allready doomed, the happiness in the face of Virginia Mayo after the Marriage endow her with transcendant eternity. The end is equal of the fate of Bonnie and Clyde and true love conquers death.",1249862400,14,522,4.553191489361702
3857733,5,B0026ZQIVW,"At last this magnificient film by Raoul Walsh is out on DVD! This is a literate and breathtaking remake of Walsh's High Sierra and is just about as good. McCrea, an actor of tremendous ability, is superb, and this may be Virginia Mayo's finest role.... Henry Hull, that great character actor, also stands out. This is a superior Western and a fine film, highly recommended. Now, let us hope for additional McCrea titles....why not Universal's fine Cattle Drive and Saddle Tramp, both very good oaters, with McCrea a natural?  And Wichita needs an American release in NTSC format. And there others....",1243814400,13,600,4.9405940594059405
3857754,5,B0026ZQIVW,"Alright, lets just start with the fact that this is a copy (remake) of the movie ""High Sierra"" that starred Bogart and Lupino. It was a movie great, with no doubt. Now let me state for the record that even though I wanted to feel sorry for the protaganists in that film, for some reason I couldn't. In THIS movie, however, absolutely. It's a better story, the characters are deeper, the lawmen are more ruthless, and the ending is just fantastic. I always have thought Ida Lupino was really beautiful, but Virginia Mayo is just hot. Joel McCray is tough and sympathetic, and Dorothy Malone is beautiful, shallow, and stupidly treacherous. It's just more real. I meant what I said about Virginia Mayo .. sammy",1411603200,4,708,4.672

8353806,3,B0026ZQIVW,"I like Joel McCrea movies as a general rule, westerns especially, and the rest of this cast are fine. This loose remake of the 1941 hit ""High Sierra""  however, has a script that dragged in parts for me. Although named ""Colorado Territory"" it supposedly ends a few miles from Mexico at what looks like scenic mountains in Northwestern NM or Southwestern Colorado. Nice to see Dorothy Malone in an early role, but Virginia Mayo is the sexy prize Joel McCrea's character seems destined to be with. The ending is a lesson in crime not paying, and would be more satisfying if the villains were less likeable and the posse chasing them more appealing. And, as others have noted, Technicolor would have added a great deal of appeal to this one. This could likely have been cut by 15 minutes overall and ended up as a faster-paced ""action with a moral message"" movie.",1448841600,,859,4.651315789473684

8353808,5,B0026ZQIVW,"Just received this western that I had never seen before. Well, played it as soon as I got it and really enjoyed it. The big surprise was Joel playing the bad guy but with a conscience and likable manner. Of course as everyone has mentioned this a westernized remake of Bogart's 'High Sierra' from 1941. This had a 'Bonnie and Clyde' ending that had me in tears. I bet a lot of men wish they a loyal woman like Colorado( Virginia Mayo) fight by their side till the tragic end. Real love conquers death.",1432944000,3,501,4.340425531914893

8353810,4,B0026ZQIVW,"Joel McCrea is perfect in this role. He really plays the reluctant bandit perfectly and despite his role in life he is a ""good guy"". Virginia Mayo is her usual beautiful self in this early role of hers and plays it well. The dialog and characters are pretty well written but the plot could have used a little more action. All in all, a good watch.",1425686400,2,347,4.2727272727272725
8353811,3,B0026ZQIVW,I like Joel McCrea in most of his movies.  This one is a little different in that the ending is not to my liking.  Virginia Mayo is great here too.,1424995200,,147,3.8666666666666667
