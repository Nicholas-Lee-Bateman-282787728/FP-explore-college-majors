4219161,5,B003Y5H4W0,"I LOVE this movie! Kristen did an AWESOME job and proved she CAN be more than Bella Swan....even though I think she proved that in The Runaways! James & Melissa were so good in this movie too and all 3 actors together were just Brilliant!

MUST MUST See!!!",1296777600,2,256,4.333333333333333
4219162,5,B003Y5H4W0,"Just becuase this movie doesn't end they way I wanted it to, doesn't mean its not a good movie.  Kristen was great in this.",1296604800,,123,4.125
4219163,4,B003Y5H4W0,"I picked up this movie via Redbox last night.  I would have liked to have seen it in the theater, but living in the armpit of Maryland we really don't get too many independent films around here.  I'm sure I'll have no problem securing a ticket for Big Momma's House 3, once that is released.  Welcome to the Rileys is an intense character drama.  A film whose characters ripple through your mind long after the stone has skipped.  James Gandolfini is a warm man with so much love to give, but nowhere to put it.  Melissa Leo gives a strong performance as the emotionally vacant wife, and Kristen Stewart continues to impress.  She ain't no Bella here, and its her fearlessness in continuing to seek out characters like this that will ensure her a long and fruitful career, if that's what she chooses.  I'm giving it four stars because it seems like they had two different endings to choose from and rather than picking one, they went with both.  I won't spoil anything, but lets just say I wish the film had ended five minutes before it did.  There's some magic in wandering through the rest of your life, looking around every corner your see.",1296604800,7,1143,4.53170731707317
4219164,5,B003Y5H4W0,"The strongest point of this movie is the performances by the cast - Gandolfini, Stewart, & Leo are all brilliant in their roles.
I'd give the plot a 3 1/2 - 4 Star review, but because of the acting I'm giving it a 5.
Wonderful character piece.",1296518400,,243,4.191489361702128
4219165,4,B003Y5H4W0,"A couple trying to cope with the death of thier 15 year old daughter individually handle themselves in a way that works for them.  Three people who are completely different get to know each other and all have ways of helping each other cope with where their lives are at.  After going to New Orleans on a business trip, Doug Riley (Gandolfini) meets Mallory (Stewart) and tries to take care of her (like a daughter).  Let me start by saying that Kristen Stewart is a good actress (when not playing Bella) and hold her own with Tony Soprano.  This is another movie that is only watchable because of the performances.  I enjoyed it, but if the acting was bad it would have been hard to sit through.  This is a completely character driven story so if your looking for action I'd look elsewhere, but if you want a well done drama you've come to the right place.  Story is OK, acting again makes this a better movie then it is.  I give it a B.

Would I watch it again? - If it was on TV I would not immediatly change the channel.",1296518400,3,1024,4.2642487046632125

4219179,4,B003Y5H4W0,I liked this film. As a father of daughters I could empathize with Gandolfinis role. It was one of his best. K. Stewart whom I admire as an actress with an intelligence and skill was also very good in a slightly undeveloped role. She made the best of it. Watchable,1461369600,,264,4.3

4219200,4,B003Y5H4W0,"This film moves a bit slowly, but doesn't drag. The characters are well drawn, and even Miss Stewart does a good job with being, basically, Kristen Stewart. Melissa Leo is great, as usual, with a nuanced character that even goes for a bit of wry humor at times. Gandolfini is excellent, and very believable as the older  man who tries to 'adopt' a young stripper so that he can get some sort of redemption for his feelings of failing his deceased daughter.

Very watchable, recommended!",1441843200,,486,4.705882352941177

4219250,5,B003Y5H4W0,"Sometimes we get what we need in life and not what we want.  James Gandofini sadly died at 59 just a few years ago.  As ""The Sopranos"" godfather and  family patriarch, and in ""Welcome to the Rileys"" he played a man and husband of basic integrity  who still loves his wife Lois (Melissa Leo), but has fallen into a ho-hum affair with a waitress because Lois has absented herself emotionally from the marriage, blaming  herself for their daughter's death in a fiery automobile accident. A successful owner of a plumbing wholesale business, he flies to a convention in New Orleans, karmically wanders into a strip joint, meets a 16 year old stripper/hooker and moves in with her.  Lois meanwhile gathers her courage,  gets in the Cadillac, knocks over the garbage bin, blows open the airbag,  wakes up, finally sorts out the seat adjustments, backs out  and drives to New Orleans.  Your first viewing of this movie will reveal the degree to which you project your own views onto this plausible situation.  After waiting a week or two, watch it again and see if either there's more space, tolerance or empathy alive within you.  I've watched it three times, yet it's as fresh and inviting as it was when it arrived from Amazon.  Thank you, James, wherever you are.",1416096000,,1260,4.724770642201835

I was a little shocked at first, but the second time I watched it, I paid more attention to the story line. It is well written and definatly well played by her. I hope that this is not the kind of rolls she will be doing in the future. She is too good of an actress and much too beautiful  to play such parts.

4219325,5,B003Y5H4W0,"One of my favorite films with Kristen Stewart. This movie is really good. It's about when a man named Doug loses his daughter, Emily, & heads on a business trip to New Orleans where he meets a stripper name Mallory (Kristen Stewart). Mallory tries to seduce him but when Doug refuses to have sex with her, he instead accompanies her home & promises to pay her $100 a day to replace her home  if he lets her stay there for a few days. Doug's wife, Louise, eventually shows up in New Orleans to be with her husband where she meets Mallory, who is ALSO the same age as Emily when she died. Lois befriends Mallory as they go out to eat one night, along with shopping & conversations about Emily. Lois & Mallory has a fight one night when Mallory goes out to the club & Lois tries & holds her back. Lois accidently hits Mallory after she asked her something unpleasant, & then an outraged Mallory storms out of the house. The married couple finds her & tries to take her back home, but she ran out the car away from them proclaiming ""She's nobody's little girl anymore."" Months later, Mallory calls Doug & tells her she's doing just fine & thanking him for the money he left her. She also apologizes to his wife for the way she acted towards her. Doug tells Mallory he loves her before he got off the phone with her, & Mallory tells him she loves him.

This drama is very quiet at times, the characters only speak when they have something valuable to say, well maybe expect Stewart's character who is sassy and has a sailor's mouth. Anyway, what I like about this film is how real and raw it is. Doug (Gandolfini) and Lois (Leo) play husband and wife who's marriage has been falling apart ever since the death of their teenage daughter Emily. Doug goes on a business trip to New Orleans and that's where he meet's Stewart's character, Mallory who's an underage stripper.

Her eyes constantly sparked, moved, looked for an exit. James Gandolfini played a wonderful dad figure. Melissa Leo's character was just the kind of smother mom substitute to set off the explosive Kristen.
In the end, Kristen's character has run away again and resumed her solitary life.

I agree with one of the other reviewers that K. Stewart remains a bit of a ""monochromatic"" actress, but, overall, she does a decent job in this film--one might say it's a pretty earnest performance on her part. Definitely not as painful to watch her as compared to Twilight. Then again, it's clear that her heart is totally in this piece of work, so there you go.

The story follows Doug Riley as he goes to New Orleans on a junket with his company.  There he finds Mallory. She reminds him of his deceased daughter. He makes a decision to stay and help Mallory.  Besides his home life is non-existent:  His wife hasn't left the house in years and is a loveless marriage to Doug.  When he finally calls his wife to tell her he isn't coming home, that he has decided to stay there for awhile, his wife has to make a decision to finally be brave and leave the home and drive there. There is a funny scene where she backs out of the garage into the garbage can. She puts the car in drive and runs into a basketball pole.  She drives the car with the airbag hanging out. In New Orleans the Riley's rekindle their marriage. He tries to help Mallory leave the ""stripper"" world behind.  Mr. and Mrs. Riley leave after a blow-up with Mallory when she takes off on them.

4219429,1,B003Y5H4W0,"This was so excruciating for me to watch I couldn't even finish it. I could ""see"" the acting, not the characters, if that makes sense. When I watch a movie, I want to be transported into their world...this did not do that for me.

It was like, the director thought, ""hey, I want to make an 'indie' movie."" So, he (the son of Ridley Scott no less) decided to make Welcome to the Rileys. Maybe he watched ""Down by Law"" or some other Jim Jarmusch movie and decided he was ready to make his own ""indie"" flick. Well, I'm sorry, but maybe he should try a different genre cause he ain't no Jim Jarmusch!

A movie needs to come from the heart and soul of the director, and from the director, that energy needs to flow into the actors so they can create believable characters. Just because a character has a few ""quirks"" or issues, it doesn't make them interesting or believable. And just because a bunch of characters in a story have a bunch of flaws and issues, it doesn't mean that story would make an interesting ""indie"" movie. I've watched a lot of ""indie"" movies, and I'm finding a lot of the more recent ones try way too hard to BE something they're not. You can't force an apple to become an orange because you've painted it with orange paint. And you can't make me believe Kristen Stewart is a stripper just because you put her in a skanky outfit.

I understand what the movie was attempting to do, but it failed miserably, in my opinion. Yes, it's just my opinion, so don't flay me for having it. If you loved the movie, then hurray for you. I didn't.

Just locations. No sound track. Your taken right into the lives of real people, in real situations. Not jazzed up. Just like real life.

Then you meet Kristen Stewart. Man this actress is talented. Every once in a while an actor comes along that can fulfill roles that have been languishing on the shelf... waiting for someone capable of fulfilling the character. Kristen doesn't really ""act"". She just ""is"". She is that character. A true chameleon. In this film Kristen becomes a lost soul of 16 years in body. You soon care deeply for her, deep flaws and all. Soon all you care about is for her to be saved from a life on the streets.

And of course our good friend from The Sopranos Mr. Gandolfini is at his best. He dials to the heart of his character, and every move he makes come from that place.

Another thing that touched him was the retaliation that mallory shows toward doug and lois when they try to get her to conform to a regular 16 year old girl.  I took in a stripper i met ""platonically, like doug"" and shed been in the business since she was ""too young to be in the business"" and like mallory, I fought to help her and like mallory she wasn't having it.  I through her babysat for a prostitute at her club and as a friendship grew I tried to help her. Like mallory, she wasn't having it.  What I'm getting at is Welcome to the Rileys doesn't give false moves.  Its realistic and yes, brutal.  It shows from the moment he moved that mattress into her house that you can't undo everything that has been done to a person.  The more times i watch the film the more i notice.

I wasn't sure how the film would deal with the under-age stripper character.  Some of the early scenes between Gandolfini and Stewart were intense, but they were done without cliche which is why those particular scenes were so powerful.  You could really feel Doug Riley's discomfort with Mallory's attempts to interest him in her services.

I was astounded by Kristen Stewart's performance.  It couldn't have been an easy part, but she really put her all into her character. Of course working with Melissa Leo and James Gandolfini made a difference.  If they weren't such good actors too, the film wouldn't have been the same.

4219471,4,B003Y5H4W0,"Kristen Stewart will of course get the lion's share of publicity on this one as a prostitute that's one step away from oblivion (she actually deserves the hype that surrounds her) - but for me it's the combo of James Gandolfini and Melissa Leo who are astonishing.

Directed by Jake Scott and Executive Produced by his famous relations Tony and Ridley of Scott Free Productions - 2010's ""Welcome To The Rileys"" is a small independent movie with a big heart and even bigger performances.

Doug Riley is on autopilot - playing out his joyless poker games on Thursday night with the boys - sleeping with Vivienne the waitress in the local diner - not sleeping with Lois his wife of 30 years. But there's a reason for his wife's frigidity and her desperately lonely pill taking - not to mention Doug's quiet sobbing in the garage with a cigarette in the dark. Both Doug and Lois lost their 15-year old daughter Emily in an avoidable car accident in 2001 - and with unspoken hurt and unallocated blame - have been escalating damaged goods ever since. But when Vivien his diner-lover of 4 years dies (a subtle performance by Eisa Davis) and Doug goes on a business holiday to New Orleans - he gets more than he bargained for when he goes upstairs with a 17-year old pole dancer and hooker. And this is where the real story begins...

The acting in ""Welcome To The Rileys"" is top class and goes a long to forgiving the largely terrible picture quality (a lot of night shots with little or no clarity). First up is a magnificent turn by Gandolfini. In what could have been such a pervy role, he lends his big-bruiser Doug a good-man's gravitas that is wholly believable. Melissa Leo gets the toughest role - and she eats it up with a performance that keeps you glued. And then there's the talented and beautiful Kristen - her jumpy malnourished creation is all spotty skin, blurred eye shadow and bruised limbs. Mallory has been dumped on all of her life - and her street-fighting cornered-rat mistrust of everything takes some breaking through. But Doug is determined - and so is his wife - who comes after Doug and has to make some major life-adjustments herself. All three have been rightly applauded for their work in this...

Ok - ""Welcome To The Rileys"" is perhaps a little implausible at times - but the writing and the storytelling will slowburn their way into your heart. And it has an ending that isn't pat - despite the huge pressure there must have been on Jake Scott to deliver just that - happy families all the way...

A bit of an overlooked gem frankly. I liked this film a lot.

Put it high on your rental list.",1330992000,,2620,4.540254237288136

4219473,5,B003Y5H4W0,"Years after the death of their daughter Emily, Doug (James Gandolfini) and Lois Riley (Melissa Leo) have fallen into a dreary, lifeless routine in Indianapolis, Indiana. Doug spends his days working as an outside salesman, and the audience is to assume he does fairly well and has an extensive, loyal client base. Lois has developed agoraphobia, so she never leaves the house. In the evenings, Doug goes to his poker game, then stops by the diner to eat and pick up waitress Vivian, the middle-aged woman with whom Doug is having an affair.

One day, Doug's job requires that he attended a conference in New Orleans. While in New Orleans and desperate to avoid the company of his coworkers and friends, Doug enters a strip club and is sexually propositioned by what would appear to be an underage stripper named Mallory (Kristen Stewart). Struck by the resemblance Mallory bears to his late daughter and after seeing the conditions in which Mallory lives when he takes her home, Doug quits his job and tells Lois he won't be coming home so he can stay in New Orleans and help Mallory get her life together.

Lois--who knew about Vivian and believes Doug to have moved to New Orleans with another woman--overcomes her fear and drives to New Orleans thinking she'll confront Doug's indiscretions. However, she finds that Doug has taken a 16-year-old runaway from Florida under his wing.

I don't typically like dramas because more often than not, they're modern fairty tales. Most dramas today are oriented toward flattering lighting for close-ups of big names rather than portrayals of real-life events. This movie breaks the mold, though. It's an extremely heart-felt movie; Kristen Stewart is surprisingly effective as Mallory/Allison, the 16-year-old runaway-turned-stripper-turned-prostitute who desperately needs guidance and affection. Leo is also stunning in the movie, providing arguably one of the best performances of her career.

James Gandolfini, Kristen Stewart and Melissa Leo give brilliant performances and the chemistry between the three is simply a delight to watch. Kristen Stewart gives one of her very best performances here, her chemistry with James Gandolfini is simply outstanding, and Gandolfini easily steals the show with a very powerful performance, he plays 'Doug' a very common man who could be you, who could be me.

Meet the Riley's is the story of a husband and wife who loose and child and are still grappling with that loss years later. While they still live under the same roof, one is having and affair that ends with the significant other dying, and the other won't leave the house out of a fear that developed after the loss of their child. Their marriage has stayed intact, but the relationship has fallen apart.

Only then does his wife find the courage to come to New Orleans herself. Together the two try to help this child that they are trying to save since their daughter could not be saved. Secrets are revealed, and things unfold. I don't want to ruin it. At this point I haven't really said much more than a preview would reveal but wanted to atleast recap the basics. Great acting all around by all, and it's a touching story of the way we sometimes find ways to heal. It's heartwarming, and interesting, and the shooting of the film allows you to get a real life taste of a post-Katrina New Orleans as well. In the end the characters all grow, and each gains something else from the other. The film is rated R but is not overly grotesque. The language is, but there isn't a ton of nudity. It's a good movie, and if you like the human element in movies, then you will like this.

4219478,5,B003Y5H4W0,"This was a very good movie, deserves four stars instead of five if we consider crude language that overpowers the theme, but will give it five because of Melissa Leo. There was too much license with trying to shock our sensibilities with crude and vulgar language; the point is that the main character, Kristen Stewart, is uneducated and has no filters when it comes to language and I felt that the language detracted from the film and suspended empathy for Ms. Stewart's character. Otherwise, this was a great vehicle for James Gandolfini to show that he has the chops to move from the small screen to the big screen and the big screen allows him a breadth of emotion that he cannot as easily display on a television series. He not only moved to the big screen with ease, but he owns it in this film.  Equally brilliant is Melissa Leo who plays his neurotic and damaged wife and her performance is the best in this film: Melissa Leo embodies characters and we forget that she is an actress and this film allows her to soar. Watching her face and her emotions is like watching a palette of her range. Returning to Kristen Stewart's role, the crudity of her language became a character on its own and it overpowered her performance; during one scene in a bathroom where Leo's character attempts to help Ms. Stewart there was an opportunity to allow real tenderness, but the scene is sullied by crude language - the language diminishes the depth of character - and our sympathy is stopped short. Melissa Leo's acting turns this film from a good one to a great one and without giving too much away her scene in the diner is the best in the film.",1303344000,2,1642,4.5286195286195285

4219506,4,B003Y5H4W0,"Welcome to The Rileys drew me in more and more as the movie progressed; at first I thought it was a bit too slow but when the pace picked up with the backdrop of New Orleans I was rather impressed by what it had to say. The casting couldn't have been better; Melissa Leo gives an outstanding performance as a guilty housewife punishing herself for a long-ago car accident that took her daughter's life; and James Gandolfini  turns in a masterful performance as her husband Doug who just can't seem to get past his grief and personal demons. The choreography and the cinematography enhance the movie and the musical score does a great job of making the film even better, too.

Lois Riley (Melissa Leo) and her husband Doug (James Gandolfini) are still most unhappy even though it's been eight years since the death of their daughter in a car accident. Lois hasn't left the house since the car accident; indeed, Lois has been so depressed that she already has headstones for her and Doug next to their late daughter's grave, a fact that gives Doug the creeps. Doug also has a long standing affair with a waitress named Vivian (Eisa Davis). However, when Vivian suddenly dies of a heart attack Doug is very upset and sadder still; and he suffers in silence because he doesn't know that Lois knew about him and Vivian for quite some while already.

Doug goes to a business convention in New Orleans; and being still upset about Vivian's death (he had wanted to take her there for her birthday) and also feeling out of place in a city very different from where he lives with his wife, Doug leaves the convention early one day and wanders into a strip joint where he meets an underage call girl who goes by several different names including Mallory (Kristen Stewart of ""Twilight"" fame). Doug and Mallory begin a most unconventional relationship; she reminds Doug of his daughter. So, what does Doug do? He phones Lois to tell her he's staying in New Orleans indefinitely without giving Lois any reason; he moves in with Mallory paying her $100 a day to stay with her in her very rundown apartment in a home that was abandoned after Hurricane Katrina and Doug tries desperately to get Mallory to grow up with a combination of love and confrontation that Mallory needs.

Meanwhile, Lois decides to finally leave their home after nearly eight years of staying indoors--she's determined to drive to New Orleans and find Doug there by calling him on his cell phone. Of course, the rest of what transpires gives us a very solid story line and some fine entertainment.

I could tell you more; but there won't be any spoilers here even though it may seem like I've told you much too much already! Suffice it to say the rest of the plot should hold your attention very well. In addition, look for very good performances by Tiffany Coty as Tara and Lance E. Nichols in an all-too-brief appearance as Hamilton 'Ham' Watkins, another businessman at the convention.

The DVD also comes with an extra about the making of the film.

I recommend this film for anyone interested in gritty family drama or drama in general; and of course fans of the actors in this movie would do well to add this to their collections.",1299110400,10,3194,4.6325088339222615
4219507,2,B003Y5H4W0,"WTTR is a disjointed investigation of loss and guilt, I think.  Good premise but huge gaps in logic (why do long-ago car crashes cause these people to do these outlandish things).  ""Mallory's"" motivations are especially unclear.

We know and like these actors.  But Stewart does not yet have the training or gravitas to pull this off.  Her trademark jaw dislocations and rapid-fire pile-ups in delivery make me think of Bella.  Gando struggles with an Indiana accent (and this isn't it).  Leo's character (and the two have been together since grade school) mysteriously has no accent.  What?  Why bother?

I applaud grown-up flicks like this but this one is too thin and not well thought through.  Soundtrack was good.",1299024000,3,718,5.0

""Welcome to the Rileys"" is yet another example of how a film with a merely decent script can be elevated by the performances of great actors.

Doug and Lois have been living in a sort of purgatory since the death of their teenage daughter almost a decade ago. Lois has become an agoraphobic unable to leave the house, whereas Doug seems to be just numbly going through the motions of work. When Doug discovers, while visiting his daughter's grave, that his wife has already purchased plots for the both of them, it hits him that, as far as his wife is concerned, the two are merely marking time until death.

While on a business trip to New Orleans, Doug wanders into a seedy strip club and meets Mallory, a teenage runaway surviving as a stripper and prostitute. The shattered, lost girl brings out Doug's paternal instinct, and he makes a bold decision to stay in New Orleans indefinitely to take care of her. This decision creates enough panic and desperation in Lois to motivate her to finally leave the prison of her house and travel to New Orleans to talk sense into Doug, and in the process Lois develops feelings for the troubled girl as well.

The film's director wisely keeps things understated and simple, and plays to the project's greatest strength, which are the three outstanding lead actors. James Gandolfini gives a sensitive, heartbreaking performance, shedding all of the alpha male mannerisms of his Tony Soprano persona. Melissa Leo, like she did in ""Frozen River"", offers a raw, brave portrayal of a desperate, ordinary person. And Kristen Stewart, as she did in ""The Runaways"" proves that, despite her success with the ""Twilight"" franchise, she is really a gifted character actress, and not a bland romantic leading lady. She holds her own with Gandolfini and Leo, and manages to avoid all the clichs often associated with similar characters.

Like ""Leaving Las Vegas"", ""Welcome to the Rileys"" is a story about the redemptive power of love, even when those involved are broken, flawed, and even hopelessly self-destructive. Although the film's ending may be a bit too neat and tidy for my taste, it did offer an open-endedness that kept the whole film from falling into either of two traps: phony sentiment or bleak nihilism.",1299024000,3,2257,4.851948051948052
4219509,5,B003Y5H4W0,"My daughter who is totally a fan of Kristen Stewart had heard about this movie, but had never seen the movie. As a 47-year-old woman I appreciated Kristen Stewart's acting ability, but wasn't much interested in seeing another ""teen movie"" (this film is for adults). I decided to watch ""Welcome to the Riley's"" for some mother-daughter time with my own daughter. I am so glad she knew about this movie.
James Gandolfini and Melissa Leo as Mr. and Mrs. Riley are masters at the craft of acting. They never missed a beat despite the tough topic covered. They were incredibly believable. I forgot I was watching a movie. Their relationship, its breakdown is raw and ordinary and then incredibly inspiring.
Kristen Stewart carried the character of Mallory as a teenage runaway, stripper and prostitute without insulting reality- in fact the whole movie was that way. This easily could have been a cheesy, do-gooder movie but this is one that took ordinary and responsible and amazing- and made it greater than the sum of its parts.
 I rarely rate a movie 5 out of 5; this movie is such. As a side point, I hope this movie reminds people in the US that it's not just children across the globe that are suffering, we have a lot of work to do here.",1298851200,28,1240,4.610859728506787

He played a very tender, soft and vulnerable man. Having never seen him in anything but The Sopranos I did not think it possible. He was just great! Kristen Stewart's performance has convinced me that she is the real thing. Wow what a hard part to play and she was fabulous. Gandolfini and Stewart's relationship in the movie was very complex and grew at just the right pace. The plot was laid out at a nice pace and had a lot of depth to it. I am very surprised that this did not come out in movie theatres and am not sure why. I think it would have been a big hit.

Nope.

This is merely another situation viewed through the Hollywood glass darkly. Expect everyone in the film to be corrupt, amoral and irredeemable and you won't be disappointed. No surprise, really---this is Hollywood's reality---and apparently, the idealized reality of many viewers. I, for one, wish them luck in attaining it.",1298246400,6,526,5.176470588235294

4219525,5,B003Y5H4W0,"Doug & Lois Riley are still reeling from the death of their 15-year old daughter eight years ago. Lois has become
a distant shut-in, never venturing outside from their house, while Doug cries alone in the garage and half-
heartedly runs his successful plumbing supply business. The marriage is quietly strained, but they're still
together, though Doug is carrying on an affair with a local waitress, who unexpectedly dies. Upon a chance
encounter on a New Orleans business trip, Doug meets up with a young, hard-edged
runaway/stripper/prostitute, Mallory (Kristen Stewart) to which he nurtures a father-daughter bond. Not really
sure why he doesn't want to sleep with her, she nonetheless accepts his offer to pay her to live in and fix up
her decrepit house, in essence becoming her ""Sugar daddy"". When he calls Lois and tells her he's not coming
back, this is the motivation she needs to finally get out of the house and reunites with Doug and also begins to
bond with Mallory. A shaky relationship all around to be sure, but the great performances of Gandolfini & Leo
manage to make it believable. Stewart is still...Stewart, a little stiff but a pretty risque departure from her
Twilight (and even The Runaways) parts.

The PQ on this Blu-ray disc is very nice. Detail is good and portrays Mallory's used-up appearance very accurately. The
picture is generally clean with just a very mild grain to it. Color pallette is a bit muted, but seems appropriate
for the tone of the film. The DTS-MA audio is decent with nothing really spectacular going on surround wise
which is usually the norm with dramas, though the club scenes have a little ambience going on with the music.
Dialogue is always clear and level.

The only extra is a fairly generic making-of featurette in HD including all of the cast. A couple of preview trailers
for other films are available as well. There is a BD-Live option, but I did not access it. The disc is java-encoded
and has a bookmarking feature.",1297209600,,1978,4.814705882352941
4219526,5,B003Y5H4W0,"WELCOME TO THE RILEYS is a little sign on the garage doors of Doug and Lois Riley in Indianapolis, Indiana.  It also serves as the title of this fine little film written by Ken Hixon and directed by Jake Scott that examines how the loss of a 15-year-old daughter Emily in an automobile accident has resulted in the crumbling of the parent's marriage and relationship.  Doug (James Gandolfini) has an affair with younger waitress Vivian (Eisa Davis) while Lois (Melissa Leo) becomes so isolated in her agoraphobic state and psychotropic mediations that she is no longer available to Doug. A crisis occurs when Vivian dies in cardiac arrest and in Doug's honest grief he visits her grave only to find that Lois has unilaterally purchased a headstone with Doug's and Lois' names on it beside the grave of their departed Emily, a fact that enrages Doug.

Doug goes to New Orleans on a convention and there encounters stripper/prostitute Mallory (Kristen Stewart), a 16 year old unkempt, foul mouthed runaway from Florida: Mallory sees the kind Doug as a john but Doug's interest is in her plight, not her business offerings. Doug obviously responds to Mallory as though she were his lost daughter, moving into her filthy apartment, trying to improve her view of life.  Doug phones Lois that he is going to stay in New Orleans a while, a message that gives Lois the courage to actually leave her home and drive to New Orleans: during Lois' somewhat comedic trip she stops for food and a strange man comes on to her - something that awakens her self esteem before she reaches New Orleans. Once Lois arrives at her destination she is proud of overcoming her agoraphobia and Doug is happy to see the healing Lois.  Together they stay with Mallory, facing the fact that for both of them Mallory represents the chance to restore their love for the daughter they've lost.  How the three cope is the remaining of the film.

The three leads offer polished performances - some of the finest work we have seen from both Gandolfini and Leo who together make this film better than the sum of its parts.  Kristen Stewart immerses herself in Mallory and though she still remains a rather monochromatic actress, this role offers her the ability to stretch her acting chops: she is convincing as the victim of the dregs of society and makes us care about a character who seems to have few redeeming qualities.  This trio of actors plays well as a small ensemble and the result is a film that has been far too overlooked by the general public.  Recommended.

The Rileys have been struggling in their marriage since losing their teenage daughter eight years prior. Once a happily married and loving couple, Lois (Melissa Leo) and Doug (James Gandolfini) have grown distant. Lois has become agoraphobic and won't leave the house while Doug tries to stay away, finding their home depressing.

Looking to get away, Doug goes on a business trip to New Orleans. He meets Mallory (Kristen Stewart), a teenage runaway. Despite her unsettling demeanor, Doug immediately recognizes an innocence in Mallory. He realizes she is in desperate need of paternal guidance, something he has been longing to provide. The opportunity to care and protect Mallory supplants the void Doug's marriage has left in his heart, and brings new meaning to his life. Doug decides to sell his business and stay in New Orleans to give Mallory the attention and help she can't bring herself to ask for.

Lois overcomes her phobia and ventures to New Orleans to reclaim her marriage. What initially seems to be the final straw that will derail their marriage turns out to be the inspiration for Lois and Doug to renew their love for each other.""

4219529,5,B003Y5H4W0,"Acting absolutely superb - Gandolfini conquers any doubts his talents rest at playing Tony Soprano - in fact - it's time we simply apologize for asking so much from television actors who take the plunge into films - especially after long successful runs.  If this is ambiguous to you, compare it to Michael Jordon who had the (no pun) balls to quit at the top of his game to venture into the minor leagues in a quest to answer his lifelong question as to whether choosing basketball over baseball was the right decision.  Any player will tell you despite the stigma of being the ""lessor"" league - very, VERY few even make it that far - and  Jordon to not only be picked up but then to blast away giving it his all - good or bad - publicly and without apologies - well, he and Gandolfini have something few men do - the will, perseverance, and rare quality to let go of any past greatness in return for the rewards of moving forward and working just as hard at something going into are given no assurances at success.

In other ""Welcome to the Riley's"" news . . . Melissa Leo's performance is utterly spectacular portraying her role to the hilt without so much as ever letting us in on the fact she was acting - she played the role beyond what should have been expected with her subtle approach to what I'm sure any actor would agree was a script FILLED with nothing short of mere plethora of emotions she was called upon to portray.  Whether playing passive aggressive, angry, anxious, fearful, willful, vigilant, forgiving, lustful, determined, empathetic, or as she does best, emphasizing there is no age limit to seeing the world, although again, for the first time - she pulls them all off without letting us in on how difficult a role she was given - and she was tremendous.

And last but not least, credit is certainly due young Kristen Stewart for whom without glitch played the role for which she was cast - and although it may seem a far easier thing for a young actress to play a role which any young model might be cast,  I would personally place money that finding the right actress to for the role of ""Mallory/Allison"" was for the casting agents, producer, and director, by far the most difficult challenge in pulling off this movie without making it ""all about her"".  In affect, together the cast managed to keep the audience just as interested in the ""old people"" as the young beauty - something which let's face it- with the kind of exploitation this movie could have allowed, nothing short of an A++ goes to not only Ms. Stewart for knowing her place in the movies, but as well for all involved as the end product is a rare and honest look into many delicate subjects, produced magnificently without the usual commercial gimmicks which ruin so many otherwise would-be great movies.
