7666196,4,B01BPQG3AI,"I like this story because I am a coach and had the wonderful opportunity to coach Arianna when she was a young girl.  Her story is quite incredible and is one of those things that makes you realize that when you've been knocked down and people are telling you to stay down...often they are very wrong.

The movie has a good storyline but isn't a mega budget blockbuster.  Watch it for the good story and for the love of an underdog...not because you think it'll be superstars and amazing cinematography.",1473292800,4,503,4.566666666666666

7666203,1,B01BPQG3AI,My daughter does gymnastics and had some friends over to watch this (9 to 12 year olds). It was more about dance than gymnastics in their opinion. They thought the movie was boring and did not enjoy it.,1468800000,5,202,4.342105263157895

7666211,4,B01BPQG3AI,I loved this movie because I love gymnastics and because it is a movie based on a true story.

7666220,4,B01BPQG3AI,"If you are a gymnastic family you will enjoy the cameos as well as the great (True) story line. We found ourselves diving into YouTube for Ariana Berlin videos.
