4334430,5,B004DTNY52,"I am a yoga and Pilates teacher myself and prefer a hard vigorous yoga practice. I have done many other power yoga DVDs such as Rodney Yee, Bryan Krest, etc. They are decent however they are very similar to Ashtanga yoga (which is a set sequence of poses), thus I have been unable to find something DIFFERENT. I'm so glad I decided to try Carly Porrello's yoga because it has solved my problem by giving me something different to look forward to doing, while being very challenging. It was in no way borrowing from the Ashtanga sequence but is TRADITIONAL (unlike Jillian Michaels, and many other of the cardio gurus) vinyasa(flow) yoga incorporating weights as an option. I was sweating and felt like I had a full body workout. If you want to tone your body- you will not be disappointed. I also thoroughly enjoyed the ab segment. Felt sore afterwards and that takes a lot for me. You can tell right off the bat that she is classically trained in Pilates which as a teacher makes me happy to know that beginners out there have a dvd that is safe and effective. Thank you Carly Porrello- I can't wait to try some more dvds!",1342310400,4,1123,4.482926829268293
4334431,5,B004DTNY52,"If you're looking for an intense, tough workout, look no further than Carly Porrello's Regeneration: Power Yoga. Not only was this workout intense with weights and balances and vinyasa's (<----not sure on the spelling) but when I was done I was incredibly relaxed. I got a great workout in and felt so much better afterwards. Sure, I was sore the next day but I absolutely love this DVD. It has helped me with my form, with toning and with my relaxation. I've had a ton of stomach problems over the years, and after my doctor telling me to try doing yoga and relaxation exercises, this DVD has changed my life. I no longer struggle as much as I used with stomach problems and my stomach has more definition! So so so happy I found this and I hope she comes out with more because I will definitely be purchasing more videos!!!",1335484800,3,825,4.470198675496689
4334432,5,B004DTNY52,"I bought this DVD not knowing what to expect and I really enjoyed it.  I take Chair Yoga at a yoga studio and got this DVD since it had the addition of weights.  It was very close to the Chair classes at the studio. What I like about it is that it's not totally sitting on the chair.  Some people think that you need to be sitting the whole time, but chair yoga is using the chair as a prop.  I really enjoyed the different levels since I have several injuries and the weights really helped me to build some upper body strength. I definitely recommend it.",1334620800,39,555,4.158878504672897
4334433,3,B004DTNY52,"The best part of this dvd for me is the bonus kickboxing segment. It gives an all over mini-workout for those who can stand while holding onto a chair. Chair exercisers may want to go more slowly than she does though. The main ""chair yoga"" program starts out good with breathing, then goes too fast without an appropriate warm up for lifting arms above the head; she has the class lift both arms up and overhead at the same time instead of one at a time to begin with. She does have two other people doing the exercises with her only at a different level so there are 3 levels to choose from with or without weights. The attitude of the trainer is hurried strength training rather than calm yoga.",1333929600,14,696,4.361538461538461
4334434,3,B004DTNY52,"I purchased this DVD in an effort to find a chair workout video that I could still do with a stress fracture in my foot.  I am using a walking boot but have limited mobility so I can't do a regular exercise routine.  I bought this DVD because of the price and hoped it was in fact ""chair"" yoga.  Well it starts off great, but about halfway through they move to a standing sequence that uses the chair to help with balance.  So if you're looking for a workout that is entirely in a chair, this is not it.  But it does seem like a good video for beginners who have never done yoga before and are not already physically fit.",1329782400,43,621,4.099173553719008
4334435,4,B004DTNY52,"I'm fairly new to yoga and I fell in love with the practice. However, I love yoga that's more geared toward raising the heart rate and sculpting (especially with weights). I love Jillian Micheals' yoga workout so I thought I would give this one a try. I like this DVD much better. It incorporates more traditional yoga moves as opposed to Jillian's workout which isn't really yoga (but I like it anyways). The sun salutations segment with weights was intense. I did use 5 lb weights instead of the 1 to 2 lb weights that are recommended. This workout had so many different variations and exercises that you would never get bored with this dvd.

The only con I could see is that the workout starts out slow paced and is not very intense as well as the end of the workout. The middle segments were tough! But overall this is a very good workout and I felt so relaxed afterwards. Also, it's great for working on balance and flexibility.",1322438400,,933,4.488235294117647
4334436,4,B004DTNY52,This is an ok dvd for chair yoga but I much prefer John Schlorholtz' dvd ofchair and standing routines.  Ageless Yoga vol 1,1415404800,,123,4.3478260869565215
4334437,5,B004DTNY52,Love the combo of yoga and weights!!,1413331200,,36,4.285714285714286
4334438,5,B004DTNY52,I found it to be just what I was looking for...sometimes I can do the full session and other times I can do the easier one..I recommended it to our local library and also to a friend who is starting a class.  Thanks.,1411776000,,216,4.023255813953488
4334439,5,B004DTNY52,"I teach Chair Yoga at a retirement center and I found this to be a good class. The flow from one pose or series of poses to the next was very smooth. I liked the way the routines were presented with modifications and demonstrating three levels. I wouldn't use the most advanced level for my group, instead I started with the least challenging and progressed by adding elements of the middle level.
Our seniors love Chair Yoga and the addition of hand weights adds increased strength building to the workout.",1411257600,,507,4.644444444444445
4334440,1,B004DTNY52,"The boggiest problem I have with this is that is is not done from a chair.  The three models used the three chairs as three props to demonstrate how to take some of the pressure off of certain joint when you are working out,  I'm in a wheel chair.  Some people with wheelchairs can do about 50 % of th workout.  but they really should add something to the workout so that ppl in wheelchairs can do the whole workout of add something in writing that certain of motion, types of exercise are not able to be done unless you have some range of motion.",1409961600,2,547,4.180952380952381

4334445,4,B004DTNY52,"I had a stroke in 2012 and currently, I am in constant muscle pain.  I believe that the stretching that is demonstrated in the video will help to strength my left side.  Although, presently, I can only get through the first 5-8 minutes, I think that this will improve over time.  Thanks",1397347200,2,286,4.461538461538462
4334446,5,B004DTNY52,Easy to follow clear instructions.  Good to use when starting yoga or getting back into the exercise.  Use of folding chair makes positions comfortable and secure.,1395705600,2,163,5.230769230769231

4334448,3,B004DTNY52,"Ordered this DVD with great anticipation.  I play it on my computer, and you have to click on a yellow dot supposedly to get it started.  Nothing happens when I click on the dot; another family member had to click several times before it began on his computer.  I'm so disappointed and really don't know what to do.",1393200000,,315,4.396551724137931
4334449,2,B004DTNY52,This was the first chair yoga I sent back.  Needs to be redone in a cleaner setting with a touch of accent pieces to draw the student to the various other persons working with the trainer.  The two assistants need to be brought out of the shadows and set up closer to the instructor so the individual watching can pick the person they want for focus on initially and then be able to readjust their view as they advance.,1391644800,,419,4.291139240506329
4334450,3,B004DTNY52,"I probably read the description wrong. I have a broken ankle so cannot stand. I bought the DVD thinking I could do yoga while sitting down. Unfortunately, at least 1/2 of the DVD is standing and using the chair as a prop.  The excercises while sitting were very good, and I can see the benefit for the ones where you do stand and use the chair as a prop. Yet, this is not a video for those who cannot stand. Also, I am used to yoga that concentrates more on the breathing.",1388966400,,472,4.130434782608695
4334451,5,B004DTNY52,"This DVD met or surpassed my expectations.

The explanations are good; I felt I was doing what I was supposed to do.
The use of two other people to demonstrated more difficult moves and simpler ones at the same time is very effective.
The selection of moves is good.",1388707200,4,266,4.428571428571429
4334452,4,B004DTNY52,"The Mr. and I are just starting Yoga and have limited space to exercise in our family room.  With the beginner, intermediate, and advanced options with three different people demonstrating the poses we both felt good about our workout.  As we were either sitting or standing we could both do the workout together in our limited space.  We both felt like the workout favored one side of the body more than the other, but that is easy to fix, by doing the opposite arm/leg the next day.  We did like that weights were used for an upper body workout.  The video isn't professional quality, but for the price point to decide if this is something for you, it is a buy.

p.s. When I called my Mom to tell her we were doing chair Yoga she said that is for 90 year oldsbut she admitted she doesn't have the balance for regular Yoga classes.  We are active, without much flexibility and both of us need a chair for balance.",1387065600,2,914,4.372781065088757
4334453,5,B004DTNY52,Using the weights is a great way to add a little more to a yoga workout. Love the pace and the instructor. She is very clear in her instructions so there is no problem following along.,1386115200,2,184,4.138888888888889
4334454,4,B004DTNY52,This is a good beginner video. Moves are easy to do and also included more advanced moves. I like that there were three people to watch from easy to advance.,1385683200,3,157,4.266666666666667

4334456,1,B004DTNY52,"My chair yoga class was ready for a workout with this DVD.It was nothing more than a promotion for other Carly Porrello's products. ""Disappointment"" is an understatement. Amazon kindly credited my account.",1385337600,,205,5.4375
4334457,5,B004DTNY52,"she was easy to follow,and if I couldn't do what she was doing, I followed the other lady, at times I mixed it up and did some of both....She covered the entire body, felt ""good"" after the yoga..",1385251200,3,195,4.157894736842105
4334458,2,B004DTNY52,"Everyone has their own level of ability, so this might be great for some people. But I did not enjoy it much. The arm exercises ended in a dislocated shoulder. And the DVD has many standing exercises which can be impossible to do if someone does not have much lower body strength/control. I was expecting a full workout in a chair.",1378339200,3,331,4.442622950819672
4334459,5,B004DTNY52,"This workout has 3 participants showing different levels of difficulty. This is a great workout for anyone who is not especially flexible. You can feel your muscles working when you use weights. And the modified poses like downward dog, done with the assistance of the chair provide a good stretch. Do not expect a super easy workout. Between the weights and the poses you are definetly exercising.",1377820800,6,398,4.955223880597015
4334460,5,B004DTNY52,As challenging as you want to make it.  Provided just what I expected.  Pleasant workout that can be low impact.,1375488000,2,112,4.55
4334461,5,B004DTNY52,"This is becoming my favorite work-out DVD.  I bought this because I recently had knee surgery and wanted to do some form of either yoga or exercise without getting on the floor.

When I first got the DVD, there was NO WAY I could anything standing up or bending any knee yet I was still quite satisfied with just the sitting portion of the DVD.  As my knee has healed, I've attempted the standing routines and LOVE the stretches for the back (downward dog, table). A week later, I did some of the lunges but only where the operated leg could stay straight.  I'm now switching legs but I don't do the entire routine because ... the routine is ... quite a lot!  It's pretty intense!

Even the work-out without weights can be pretty intense in the arms.

My favorite parts are the side stretches (while seated).  I can really feel a wonderful stretch all along the sides from the arms down to the hips.

I haven't gone thru the whole DVD but what I've done is almost addictive!  As I get healthier and stronger, I hope to get thru the entire DVD -- even if I stay in the beginner's level.

This DVD provides a good, intense, work-out at 3 different levels.  You should try it. Even if you take it real, real, easy at first you will still get a bit of an intense work-out.

This is one of my favorite Amazon purchases.  I really like this DVD.  I hope you will, too!",1373673600,18,1362,4.286274509803921
4334462,1,B004DTNY52,"Poorly produced DVD. Junior High/High School tv broadcasting students produce higher quality products than this DVD. The background set is also low quality. Directions for the yoga positions are okay, but not worth the distraction of the poor quality. Guess you get what you pay for...",1367971200,,285,5.217391304347826
4334463,5,B004DTNY52,What a quality workout.  I was looking for a workout that did sitting and standing with chair workout.  I have tried several.  This is the best one.  Highly recommend.,1366761600,4,167,4.655172413793103
4334464,5,B004DTNY52,"While doing yoga with a DVD, I like to follow along and receive instructions on how to coordinate breathing with body alignment and Carly Porrello does that.  This yoga is not entirely seated in a chair but includes yoga positions using the chair for support.  The only slight criticism I have is that I would have liked more attention focused on coordinating the yoga with breath.  I thought the hand weights enhanced the program.  There are 2 students seated behind the instructor who demonstrate beginners and advanced levels. There is soft guitar music playing in the background that is not too intrusive.  The DVD has a home feel but the audio is perfect, picture clarity is excellent and Carly's voice is soothing.  Plus, the price is a real benefit. Recommended!",1363305600,7,769,4.876923076923077
4334465,5,B004DTNY52,My husband bought this DVD for me after I said how much I liked another Carly Porrello DVD.  I really like to use it for the arm work out. This was my first experience with yoga and I found it easy to follow. Carly makes you feel like you are working out with a friend.  She is very likeable and challenges you.  The bonus 10 minute ab workout is awesome!  It is quick and you will feel the burn right away! Overall this product is an amazing value.  You won't be disappointed.,1348617600,,477,4.141304347826087
