5026343,5,B006WY0W2Y,"This video includes episodes from the first season of BBQ Pitmasters on TLC. The show has re-tooled its format in each of the subsequent seasons, and season one is the most ""authentic"" as it follows several teams of BBQ contestants taking part in national competitions against dozens or even hundreds of opponents. Later seasons followed a format similar to the Food Network show ""Chopped"" with closed, elimination-style tournaments created specifically for the TV show. These episodes provide a deeper look inside the world of competition barbecue.

The competitors selected for the show are a colorful bunch, and much of the focus is on the personality of the cooks. Each of the teams has their own unique style and methods, and as the video's description implies, there is as much camaraderie demonstrated as there is hard-nosed competition. You also learn a lot about the workings of barbecue contests, such as how various events are sanctioned, the different rules for judging, and the massive scope of the events. All of this is missing from later seasons, which feel more like a cooking game show.

Bottom line is, this is a fun show to watch, and I don't mind saying I've seen most of the episodes more than once. If you're a BBQ fan, you'll enjoy it, and if you know little about ""real"" barbecue, it may set you on a journey to learn what all the fuss is about.",1345593600,3,1370,4.776371308016878
5026344,4,B006WY0W2Y,"I'm really into BBQ, so I bought this DVD as just another thing to watch that relates to my interests. It only has 5 episodes on it. It pretty much follows a select few guys to various BBQ competitions in which they all have to cook the same type of meat and get judged accordingly. It was neat to see how judges in different parts of the country vary on what they like. The characters in the show are all pretty likeable, and it's not really boring to watch. You can tell that some of the ""drama"" and ""animosity"" between contestents is played up for the sake of ""reality"" programming. If you are really into BBQ, it's fun to see a couple ""secrets"" on cooking or flavoring, and to see how well certain cuts of meat are displayed. I can't really picture anyone who is NOT interested in BBQ to be really interested in this show. But, if you DO love BBQ and have an extra $15 laying around, then this show is worth watching. At least renting.",1341532800,,939,4.280898876404494

8505952,5,B006WY0W2Y,"This was an awesome stocking stuffer! My husband loves these shows and my 3 year old daughter does too! She calls it ""chicken and ribs"". You get a good amount of entertainment for the price.

The con: it will make you hungry! Make sure that you have something to eat.  We crave ribs every time we watch it. We only break it out when the grill is out.",1479772800,,350,4.132352941176471

8505959,4,B006WY0W2Y,I would have given it 5 stars but it only has a few episodes.  It's not the entire first season which is described in the description.
