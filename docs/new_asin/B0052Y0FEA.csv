8454781,5,B0052Y0FEA,"Amazing photos, great insane drawings from Yow, and the stories bring the music I love to life and with meaning.  And how the hell did I randomly get a fully, authentic autographed copy of this hard covered book?  I don't know but that was a WONDERFUL surprise!!!  Jesus Lizard, please tour again so I can find you! xoxoxo",1492387200,,322,4.517241379310345

8454785,5,B0052Y0FEA,"this band is/was my personal saviour .. this dvd will make you very happy, esp if you like The Jesus Lizard",1400025600,,107,4.142857142857143
8454786,5,B0052Y0FEA,"The Jesus Lizard show why they are still legendary.  Yow still knows how to make a dramatic entrance (but no opening comments will ever surpass his opening Max's On Broadway).  Yow still has his energy albeit slowed by a little age and weight he brings more energy than many of his successors could ever hope to find.

The sound is great and the inclusion of an MP3 file was a nice touch but I am disappointed that ""Wheelchair Epidemic"" was cut off from MP3 files.",1346803200,,464,4.435294117647059
8454787,5,B0052Y0FEA,"If you would like raw Jesus Lizard concert to watch, this was fun. I am totally happy with it. I did not have super expectations other than it was watchable, and it was. I was not expecting anything out of the norm and I was happy with it. I would recommend.

If you love the band, you will this. If you are not familiar with the band and want to check it out, you should enjoy it also. If you do not like the band, then you will hate it. I like the band, and enjoyed it a lot.",1342396800,2,477,3.8181818181818183
8454788,5,B0052Y0FEA,"I couldn't let this dvd get away with just a 3 three star review.  The Jesus Lizard is the best live bands of the 90's and this DVD proves it.  The sound is amazing, but what sets this band apart is the visuals. There is nothing better than seeing David Yow prancing around on stage or jumping into a sea of concert goers.  Highly, Highly recommend this.",1317686400,7,354,4.253731343283582
8454789,3,B0052Y0FEA,"This review is not about the content. This is a Jesus Lizard live show; it's amazing. If you're a fan, buy the DVD. My complaint is that it's not widescreen. While I wasn't expecting a Blu-Ray version, c'mon, it's 2011. I've seen HD widescreen video from reunion-tour concert-goers on YouTube. For that reason, I'm very disappointed. I guess I could change the screen resolution, but Yow has widened enough on his own...",1314144000,8,420,4.847222222222222
