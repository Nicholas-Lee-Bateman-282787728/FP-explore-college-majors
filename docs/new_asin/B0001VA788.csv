8016693,5,B0001VA788,"I bought this as a ""digging deeper"" study of fingerstyle to suppliment by Legacy Master Guitar DVD's. And I like it very very much. I really dig that lesson called SHORTNING BREAD. I think even my aunt from Kentucky recognizes the tune! The Legacy Course had one lesson on fingerstyle and I felt that was not enough for me (but Steve Krenz does an excellent job there). I wanted last Christmas to find a 3/4 pattern for fingerstyle for SILENT NIGHT since it was in 3/4 time. My quest through several more complicated DVD's led me to this one. It is just right. I can begin to feel the D string ringing nicely everytime I strike it in the SHORTNING BREAD exercise. Made me think of music in Betty Boop cartoons I told my mom!",1240531200,2,724,4.37037037037037
