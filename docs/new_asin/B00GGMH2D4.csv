8633082,5,B00GGMH2D4,"This series of workouts was exactly what I was looking for.  I've done several cycles of Steve 12 week DVD program and am 100% a kettlebell believer.  I like the flow of the warm up, workout and cool down.  Also the intensity and short duration are a must for my schedule with little kids.  These 6 workout are less about becoming a competitive kettlebellerand more about variety and pushing your cardio limits.  When you get into this the strength is really an after thought but ends up with amazing results.",1461888000,,509,4.611111111111111
