3787716,5,B001T21R4G,I would have paid this price just for Papillon but to also get Bullitt (which I'd never seen) just made it better.,1364947200,,114,4.2272727272727275
3787717,4,B001T21R4G,Both of these movies are classic but I prefer Papillon over Bullitt.  My favorite is Pappillon but be aware that this is a long movie.  Bullitt is full of action and suspence!,1359676800,,175,4.4375
3787718,5,B001T21R4G,Bought it for a friend he really enjoyed ir. Great dual set movie. Its a great present for anyone who likes action. Buy it now,1356825600,,126,4.08
3787719,1,B001T21R4G,"I was very disappointed to find out this product contains the short version of the automobile chase in the ""Bullitt"" movie.  The auto chase is supposed to be 21 minutes long.  In this whacked down version it is only 11 minutes (do not believe the miss-information in the Wikipedia. It is obviously written by people who have only seen this version of the movie.).  That means it is missing a full 10 minutes (almost 1/2) of the chase.  Missing elements of the chase that I can identify off hand are: 1. where the driver of a parked car starts to get out right in front of the speeding cars and his door is ripped off.  In real life that door almost hits the camera man.  2.  where the cars start getting squished against the guard rail and end up ripping the bumper off a truck.  3.  Where the charger is ""hiding"" behind a truck to ambush McQ and the truck driver warns him with the air horns.  Sigh.

IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR THE FULL VERSION OF THIS FAMOUS AUTO CHASE DO NOT BUY THIS.",1348963200,16,984,4.264864864864865
3787720,5,B001T21R4G,"A beautiful Steve Mcqueen collection of two of his best movies, ever, Bullitt and Papillion. These are totally different movies. Papillion requires Steve a much greater acting ability of which he does a fantastic work. I really miss Steve.",1327363200,,239,5.153846153846154
3787721,5,B001T21R4G,A great couple of flicks.  Of the two Papillon is my favorite.  Both McQueen and Hoffman turn in stellar performances; one eventually finding freedom and the other settling for safety.,1282867200,,184,5.1
3787722,5,B001T21R4G,"These two classics need no explanation. They have withstood the test of time. If you own a large collection, the double sided disc is a great space saving idea. Better yet upgrade your copies to blu ray!",1273795200,,203,4.513513513513513

3787727,5,B001T21R4G,"Two great films starring the great Steve McQueen. They're very different films, showing why McQueen is a consummate actor worthy of respect.
McQueen got his only Oscar nomination for The Sand Pebbles, which shows even another side of his talent. Still, everyone should see Bullitt, mostly because it's the first great car-chase films to win an Oscar, and Papillon is a heartfelt film (true story) that shows man's inhumanity towards man, with subsequent redemption. Dustin Hoffman is also excellent.

Definitely a double-feature keeper.",1451952000,3,536,5.457831325301205
