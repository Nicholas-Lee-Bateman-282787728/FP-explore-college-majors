2794359,5,B000OCZ2PC,"I am a fan of the ""Mononoke"" series and of the arch in the show ""Ayakashi"" that started it all: ""Bake Neko"", or its English name ""Goblin Cat"" (which I, personally, don't think to be a very accurately translation of the ghost's name.) This story arch in ""Ayakashi"" is poignant and masterfully animated, mixing current Japanese carton-styles with traditional Japanese art and patterns. It has some light humor in the beginning, but it then turns into a story with themes very common in Japanese horror.
The DVD for this is great - great condition with accenting designs, and the DVD menu stays true to the overall artistic style of this cartoon.
I have not watched this cartoon with English audio because, from what I've heard, the English voice actors project completely different characters than those of the original Japanese voice actors. For example: the Medicine Seller is voiced by Takahiro Sakurai in the Japanese version, who has a dark and quirky voice (and he is probably one of the best voices I've heard) while, in the English version, he is voiced by Andrew Francis, who sounds much younger and not quite as well-rounded for the character.
Overall, this is a unique and wonderfully completed cartoon and is definitely worth buying.",1286841600,3,1243,4.923809523809524
2794360,5,B000OCZ2PC,"This stand alone DVD contains the 3 episode story of The Goblin Cat. Or as I like the call it The Birth of the Medicine Seller. A VERY WELL thought out and intriguing storyline, An amazing main character(The Medicine Seller), and most importantly AMAZING art are exactly what you can expect from this DVD. This 3 episode story(An arc of a series called Ayakashi Samurai Horror Tales) was so striking and wonderful it spawned it's own Anime series called ""Mononoke"" following the tales and travels of the Medicine Seller. A great horror/ghost/spirit story. Highly recommended!!!",1236556800,5,577,5.08421052631579
2794361,5,B000OCZ2PC,"I do not want to give anything away, but the soft of heart may cry during the last episode of Goblin Cat, or Bakeneko.

One thing that I love about this anime is the art style, how it's colored and textured to look like a print.  If you ever watch this and the sequel anime Mononoke you may think they should put a seizure warning on the dvd or something.

The one thing that may disinterest most viewers is that there are a lot of cultural references that new anime watchers or other people not familiar with Japan may not understand.  However, there is a good enough story and a few spotlight characters that makes this one viewable for anyone that's old enough to do so.

Goblin Cat is not very scary, but it is definitely not for kids.  I would say that anyone 16 and over can watch it without any problems.  There is not really any swearing, but there is some violence and women issues.

The one bug I had with this DVD did not affect it's rating simply because it could be turned off.  That is... the English dub.  It is HORRIBLE!  Most of the characters, especially the Medicine Seller, seemed to lack personality.  Please, watch it in Japanese, unless you dare see how bad the English dub can be.

Another thing is that I noticed now closed Geneon Studio covered this dvd, so who knows if Mononoke will ever come out.  It's fan-subbed so who ever is willing can find it.",1218758400,3,1378,4.352941176470588
2794362,5,B000OCZ2PC,"Update: July 10, 2014
The twelve-episode sequel to this show, called simply&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mononoke/dp/B00IXL1J3U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mononoke</a>, will be released in Region 1 next week.  Subtitles only, though as many of us have noted in these reviews, you wouldn't want to listen to anyone other than Sakurai in the role.  The pricing on this release is phenomenal.  Here's hoping Cinedigm might decide to rescue some other unlicensed gems like Dennou Coil!

My original review:
Bakeneko combines incredible artwork with a dark, mature story and a good score.  I've watched a bit of the other volumes of Ayakashi, but Bakeneko is definitely in a league by itself.  Once you've seen this show, you'll want to watch its twelve-episode sequel called Mononoke (not yet licensed, though, only fansubbed).

I rarely listen to dubs, but I can't imagine anyone else voicing the Medicine Seller role besides Sakurai.  His performance contains all the intelligence, subtlety, menace, and cynicism the role demands.",1198022400,17,1074,5.883870967741935
2794363,5,B000OCZ2PC,"This DVD was everything I expected. The story is well done, the artwork is amazing. It has a very unique style. I didn't think it was scary, but you should know the rating on the DVD suggests 16 and up for adult themes and violence. I was happy to learn that it gives the option of watching it in Japanese and with English subs. The English dubs aren't bad and no offense to Andrew Francis, but I think Takahiro Sakurai did a better job as the voice of the Medicine Seller. I'm a big fan.",1191888000,4,488,4.147368421052631

8184726,5,B000OCZ2PC,"I like the option for having Japanese or English, and of course the Japanese comes with subtitles. The show is really interesting and touches on sensitive topics in the last episode. So a small caution I guess? Either way, I got the package on time and loved the show. 100%",1440374400,,273,4.48
8184727,5,B000OCZ2PC,"Saw this years ago and loved it. Finally got my hands on a copy and it still is awesome. The story (sad and shocking) and animation (beautiful and different) are top notch. Of course, the incredible medicine peddler character is amazing and makes this story just that much better. Highly recommend.",1423958400,,298,4.862745098039215
8184728,5,B000OCZ2PC,Product arrived within time frame and is exactly as described. Thanks,1421107200,,69,5.363636363636363
8184729,5,B000OCZ2PC,I bought this to round out my mononoke anime (since it's technically the first) and I JUST LOVE IT,1415059200,,98,4.2105263157894735
8184730,5,B000OCZ2PC,"This is a very uniquely styled and animated anime. Please take note that while it is Volume 3 of its ""series"" none of the volumes have any connection in story, art, plot, characters, or even directors for that matter. They can all be watched alone and you will not be lost.
This is a great story; very dark, dramatic, and spooky. I prefer the subtitled option a little better myself, but that doesn't really matter. This story did get a spin-off with the main character which you should check out, too!",1395360000,,502,4.527472527472527
8184731,5,B000OCZ2PC,"If you love Mononoke and I'm not talking about (Princess Mononoke),... then you will love the Goblin Cat. It's the first story that the medicine seller was introduce in... plus you get to understand the meaning behind the comment of the girl in Mononoke second story episode.

The only thing,  I preferred the Japanese audio vs the English. To me at least, the English actor doesn't quite portray the Medicine Seller mystery in his voice. But, I'm glad I got it, and if only I could find Mononoke  and the second DVD of Ayakashi (at a reasonable price) I would be happy.

All in all, get it, it's worth it!",1376524800,,606,4.4818181818181815
8184732,5,B000OCZ2PC,"I don't think my review can do this justice, but I'll try. This arc of the anime aged well. Its style is still gorgeous. The plot is a mix of horror and mystery, so I recommend to anyone who likes either or to people who like artsy series too.",1363219200,,243,3.979591836734694
8184733,5,B000OCZ2PC,"The story of this anime is three episodes long. The style is unique and amazing, nothing I had seen before. And the main character is so mysterious and cool. There is even a spinoff of the main character.",1333152000,,204,4.394736842105263
8184734,5,B000OCZ2PC,"A friend introduced me to this anime last year, and I was so enthralled and terrified from the very start.  The art direction is exceptional, as she puts it ""it's as though a package of origami paper exploded!"".  What really holds my imagination, though, its the sublime storytelling.  The horror is done well, as an aspect of a more intricate plot as opposed to the focus in and of itself.  There is a reason this is the only part of the Samurai Horror Tales that spawned any further episodes.  Please, if you are on the fence, don't be.  You won't regret buying this, so long as you like well-told and engaging horror stories with terrific art.  And I'm guessing you do :)",1303084800,,674,4.475409836065574
