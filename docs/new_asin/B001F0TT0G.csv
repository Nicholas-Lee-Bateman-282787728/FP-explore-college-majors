8300234,1,B001F0TT0G,"We are fairly strict about media intake for our children, but we do allow an occasional non-fiction production. My children are very interested in animals of all types, so I figured this would go over very well.

Content to which I object: There are multiple images and references to witches - scenes from a Shakespeare play made to movie of a witch concocting a potion... very scary image, bony hands, bulgy eyes, wild hair, creaky voice. Then another witch scenario came on in a few minutes. Finally scenes from the movie ""Dracula"" were inserted complete with dracula raising his head from biting someone's neck while the announcer went on about him drinking blood. At that point we cut it off. IMO, the makers of this film have an agenda which is a far cry from educating children about amphibians.",1334880000,4,801,4.762589928057554
