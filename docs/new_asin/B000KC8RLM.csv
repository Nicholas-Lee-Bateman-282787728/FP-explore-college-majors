8155514,5,B000KC8RLM,"There are tips on playing table tennis in this DVD that you won't find anywhere else. It's not a long video and there are no amazing special effects. But, if you listen to what the coach says, he explains some things I have never heard explained so well in my 50 years of playing this game. For example, he explains how to play long pips and how to play against players who play slow and he explains fundamentals like the grip. I have heard others explain these things but not with the insight and clarity and easy directions that this video provides. If you are a pro you probably don't need this, but if you're a beginner to intermediate I think you will feel it's well worth the money.",1444867200,,688,4.341085271317829

8155516,3,B000KC8RLM,"Its a little hard to follow which is why I am only giving it 3 stars but I did pick up some new techniques that I am currently working on developing and hopefully perfecting.  Just picking up 2 or 3 good, new techinques probably justifies the price if you are serious about getting better at your game.",1287964800,3,302,4.298245614035087
8155517,4,B000KC8RLM,"If you have never had any coaching before, this video is worth the money, especially if you are an amateur like me who just wants to improve their game.

It starts with the basics like how to hold the bat - (I didn't hold mine correctly) but quickly moves on to more meaty stuff. It was the right level for a good amateur who wants to move beyond wacking the ball and who wants to get consistency and to win games a bit more often.

Has many good tips, it is arguably better value than a human coach if only because you can watch it many times and pick up new stuff each time..

As a result of watching this video I have corrected a couple of basic bad habits.  Having a good ""ready position"" means you are less likely to try to play a backhand shot when a forhand shot would have been a better option.  Starting a shots too early was another bad habit of mine - but its good to know I share these bad habits with just about everyone else!",1204675200,8,939,4.081521739130435
8155518,4,B000KC8RLM,"It's hard for me to compare this with other instructional table tennis DVDs because this is the first one I've tried.  After shopping around, my distinct impression is that the market is not exactly flooded with products.

The best thing I can say about this DVD is that it acutally gave me some pointers that I found useful immediately...especially under neutral position, timing and consistency.  Stuff that is fairly commonsensical but just helped to have spelt out in black-and-white.

However, there were some minuses (and potential minuses - depending on what you are looking for) as well.

For one thing, it doesn't go into much depth or analysis.  More along the lines of, ""okay here is topspin versus backspin"" then hit the ball back and forth a few times to show example and then, ""okay here is topspin versus block"" etc...  Actually, I didn't think it needed anything more - and I guess that's why they call it advanced table tennis...but just a warning.

Also, the production value won't knock your socks off - but did you expect any different?

My biggest complaint actually (rather petty) is that the coach, Christian Lilleroos, doesn't turn his microphone off during the exercises....which means you get groans, gasps, heavy breathing on the soundtrack. Now I'm not someone who is against heavy breathing on DVD soundtracks - but not on instructional table tennis DVDs thanks.

The whole thing is fairly sparse but it tells you what you need and covers it fairly well.",1203811200,19,1483,4.919678714859438
