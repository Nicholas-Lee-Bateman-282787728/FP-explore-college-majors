8517642,1,B007IL5GNU,"If you've never picked up a pair of zills before, you might get something out of this DVD, though I do think there is better instruction out there. She doesn't really even explain how to play them other than saying ""This is right, left, right"" and then she plays RLR pattern for 15 minutes. All you see is a shot of hands playing RLR. Then they do the same thing with just two other rhythms. It is terribly boring and doen't even touch on the subject of playing WHILE dancing, which is actually the hard part. Don't recommend this one, sorry.",1402876800,6,542,4.376237623762377
