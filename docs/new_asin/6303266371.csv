614636,5,6303266371,My daily routine has been to look at this hypnotic video every morning prior to leaving my apartment.  Sade is the sexiest woman alive and this live performance will not disappoint.  Her band is also in rare form.  Kudos to all!!,916185600,2,229,4.536585365853658

614939,5,6303266371,"My Princess, Sade is the epitome of soulful jazz as it was meant to be.  There are many great soulful jazz singers and bands but Sade literally takes my breath away!!  Heaven is missing an angel each and every time Sade performs for us.  Sade's live performances are not only an awesome listening experience, her beauty gives my eyes an amazing, even magnificent and soothing concert to dream of being a part of. --------------------Up until here, my review above was written two months ago after watching this DVD ""Sade Live"" for the very first time.  I truly under sold it!!  I had no idea then that I would watch this concert at least ten times since I bought it two months ago. And it keeps getting better each time!!  My enjoyment is thru the roof!!  Whatever your mood, Sade and her band will make your heart sing and everything else in this world seems to disappear.  They have so much fun on stage being perfect on every note, beat, lyric and song. Sade's band is an entity all to themselves!!  They too somehow get better each and every time I watch.  Which would seem impossible after first view!!  How is that even possible? They are all amazing musicians, Stuart Mathewman on the sax and strings is beyond incredible, Andrew Hale on keys is great, Rick Braun on trumpet is awesome, the entire band is awesome!!  Together, they truly are a musical trip to behold!!  This is a DVD to cherish!!  This concert was ""the model"" for great performances!!  Your mood will swing towards the heavens!!  I recommend this DVD to all music  lovers as Sade is the essence of magnificence.  Being able to see Sade and her band perform up close and personal, live and in color is truly the very best musical experience anyone could possibly want!!  Yet somehow, I still don't feel I'm giving this performance enough credit.  They're ""that"" good!!",1426896000,9,1841,4.640866873065016

Rick Braun on trumpet just puts this concert over the top for me.  This is my favorite of her concert videos.

It helps me get back to sleep when I wake up in the middle of the night. Keep Looking and Cherry Pie are probably my favorites.  Her band is entertaining to watch as is her stunning beauty and talent.  Keep Looking is hopeful, and Cherry Pie is for everyone who has had romantic feelings for someone charismatic but it didn't work out but knows they are remembered.  It's romantic and intense at the same time. Donnabellasdigest.com",1344384000,,578,4.4245283018867925

I've been waiting (and waiting... and waiting...) for this to come out on blu ray to get the improved audio. I don't understand why a phenomenal concert video such as this is still not available, but every awful b-movie is. Is it a crime? Yes!

Sade is of course flawless in this (bare feet and all) but what really blew me away was the band's performance, super-tight and with tremendous dynamic range. The saxophone on 'Is It A Crime' is truly amazing but by far the best moment is the guitar solo on 'No Ordinary Love'. You hardly notice this in the studio version and even on the 'Lover's Live' DVD it is not as pronounced. But on this version it rocks! I get chills just thinking about it.

I'm an old 70's rocker by nature, but like many genres of music.  I was drawn to Sade because my wife liked her when we met back in the mid 80's.  Fast forward to 2011...and I'm at a pal's house (he's also primarily a rocker) and he's playing this video.  After I ribbed him about it...I went home and ordered it :-).  This woman exudes sexuality (to me, anyway) and is a very talented voice and stage presence.  So, I'd recommend this to just about anyone who likes music.

""Keep Looking"" is the second, and one of my favorite Sade songs, and the dance choreography with her backup singer Leroy Osbourne is great.  ""Keep Looking"" is from her Stronger than Pride album and for some reason is not included on any of Sade's best of cd's or the Lover's Rock Live dvd.  Cherry Pie and Cherish the Day are two other favorites.  They ended the concert with her signature Paradise.  Very energetic with her boxing choreography but too much light flashing for me.

Even though this concert is fifteen years old, I still watch it to enjoy some home entertainment. I never thought a jazz concert could be so entertaining until I saw this one. Her unique rythum and voice will intrigue you!!!",1229385600,,316,4.56140350877193
615251,5,6303266371,"Nobody can put on a show the way Sade can and I'll tell you why. She doesn't need wildly over the top sets, crazy, attention-seeking outfits, or sexually explicit dance moves to keep her fans begging for more (no disrespect intended since I love Janet Jackson and Christina Aguilera!). Everything about Sade is low-key and just below the surface. The feline slink of her stroll and slight twist of her hips are enough to make the crowd go nuts.

Recorded in San Diego's Open Air Theater during Sade's 1993 Love Deluxe tour, the Sade - Live Concert captures the band at the top of their game. The show opens with the impeccably dressed band members banging out the lush island-flavored jam The Sweetest Taboo as the barefoot Lady Herself enthusiastically bounds onto the stage, wearing a sparkly ""mermaid"" dress with her long jet black hair cascading down her back. Ms. Adu doesn't just plant herself in one spot. She shows off some sensual moves with guest guitarist Gordon Hunte and core group member Stuart Matthewman by her side.

Sade and backup vocalist Leroy Osborne (who really needs to release a solo record and bless the world with his chocolatey sweet tenor) show off more footwork on the uplifting Keep Looking then Sade lays it down solo on the sophisticated sultriness of Your Love Is King. The band performs the tropical Mad Professor Remix of Love Is Stronger Than Pride doing away with the prayerful stillness of the original, allowing Sade to really let loose at the end. The debut single and signature tune Smooth Operator (""Coast to coast/L.A. to Chicago/Western male/Across the north and south to Key Largo/Love for sale"") gives way to the rare instrumental Red Eye. The Lady slips backstage while the boys tear it up with a bombastic, funktastic jazzy, latin-tinged number that'll blow you away!

The reflective piece Haunt Me showcases Leroy's buttery vocals while Sade returns to take over the second verse then the two deliver a beautiful duet. Sade and the band sit close together while she quickly tells the audience that the next song Like A Tattoo was based on a war story a man once told her in a NYC bar. ""Like the scar of age/Written all over my face/The war is still raging inside of me/I still feel the chill/As I reveal my shame to you/I wear it like a tattoo."" Guest player Rick Braun heightens the deep sadness of the man's tale with his sorrowful trombone.

The jazzy Kiss of Life gets the show back into the romantic atmosphere as Sade mesmerizes the crowd with the story of a love so meant to be that God Himself sent an angel down to earth to build a bridge between their hearts. This jam right here is my ultimate favorite! The funky Nothing Can Come Between Us performance finds Sade droppin' it like it's hot in a tastefully sexy way, of course before the group kicks it royally with the after-hours groover Cherry Pie (""I'm gonna find out what I meant to you/You're the one who broke my heart in two!"").

A jaundice yellow forest serves as the backdrop for the beautifully devastating ballad Pearls. ""There is a woman in Somalia/The sun gives her no mercy/The same sky we lay under/Burns her to the bone/Long as afternoon shadows/It's gonna take her to get home/Each grain carefully wrapped up/Pearls for her little girl."" Sade gives an impassioned cry of ""Hallelujah"" before Stu closes the song with his guitar solo. Deep blue and yellow lighting bathe the set in the downtempo slow jam No Ordinary Love while Sade blows the lid off the torchy Is It A Crime?.

After a quick wardrobe change, the boys open the airy Cherish the Day. Ms, Adu slinks onto the stage in sleek black pant suit with her long hair pinned to a neat bun at the nape of her neck. There's a sweet moment where she graciously bends down to kiss a male audience member on the cheek and accept a bouquet of roses. Paradise kicks the high energy into overdrive with a frenzied production that causes the crowd to break out into hysteria. ""This is us and we do what we do. Thank you very much!"" Sade says in her husky English accent before collecting more cards and roses and heading backstage.

But wait. There's more! As an encore, the bluesy Jezebel is performed. Sade sits on the stage, her hair freely falling over her shoulders, as she sings of a young woman prostituting herself as a way to make it out of her bleak surroundings. ""Reach for the top she said/And the sun is gonna shine/Every winter was a war she said/I want to get what's mine!"" There's a point toward the end where Sade gives a dramatic pause and the sistas in the audience shout out ""Sing it, girl!"" before she delivers a soulful cry, buries her head in her hands, and the credits roll. MAGICAL!

There are not enough words in the human language to fully describe the elegance and showmanship of Sade, the woman and the band. Pop this DVD in and let them show you how it's done.",1228348800,,4864,4.602076124567474
615252,5,6303266371,"This live San Diego concert cannot to be missed by any Sade fan. This is the best of her live concert footage, capturing the music and the artist better than other efforts. You can just feel the excitement of being there in this lavishly produced concert film that brings both the music and the unique relationship of Sade to her loyal fans to the forefront.

It is a performance bare of costume changes and pyrotechnics, as it is just about the music we love, giving it an intimacy in spite of the large venue. Sade has never been lovelier and her vocals are surrounded by bass, horns, and precussion from fine jazz musicians like horn player Rick Braun. You get seventeen songs here and yet you're sorry when it ends.

It is worth noting that this band has stayed together during years of absence by Sade herself, an integrity and loyalty displayed in a business without any. It is the same kind of relationship she has with her fans. Late in the concert Sade leans down and accepts roses from one of those fans. No one tries to rush the stage and grab her and she gives the fan a gentle kiss as a thank you, in a day and age where your not suppose to. It is a classy moment from a classy woman.

There is a particularly intimate moment where Sade sets down and speaks of a personal encounter with a man in a New York bar who told her his story of love and war which became the haunting ""Like a Tattoo."" Though deeply felt songs such as this one are scattered throughout, the overall feel of the concert is upbeat and fun.

Exotic rhythms take you from sandy shores to romantic nightclubs and a happy feeling embraces the viewer like arms of love surrounding them and singing them a lullaby.  This San Diego concert is the best one out there, and a wonderful reminder to fans of why we fell in love with this singer and her band, and why we will continue to support Sade no matter how much time elapses between albums.",1217721600,2,1920,4.351955307262569

Every aspect is musically brilliant, I think: writing, vocals, drums, piano, sax, guitar, bass, percussion and last, but by no means least, trumpet. And the ""cherry"" on top of the sundae is Sade.

Slick editing and so many cameras make this a really visual experience, even though they take a rather basic approach to this concert. There are no special effects here or unusual lighting tricks so common these days at concerts and somehow this is so strangely appropiate for Sade's style of music. It's a very stripped down concert so you can simply concentrate on the music. Sophie Muller is at the helm as director as she has with so many of Sade's videos and her style of direction really makes a great show even better. The skill and prowess of this band is so obvious. Along with Sade's regular superb band members is the legendary Rick Braun who lends his talent on trumpet. An exciting, and at times very heartfelt performance. Being live is so liberating as opposed to the rather confined, although wonderful studio classics we have heard from Sade over all of these years. This concert really puts a fresh face on all of these songs we have heard so many times.

I hope she'll tour again sometime.... in the meantime, be sure to add this, it's one of my favorite concert DVDs.

Update: December 2011: years after writing the original review, this is still one of my alltime favorite concert DVDs.  As I'm learning how to play electric guitar recently, I'm finding too that playing along with the tracks in this concert is a lot of fun.

615346,5,6303266371,"Reading all of the claims that this was studio rerecorded made me pull out this DVD again to see for myself if this was true.  Not that I needed an excuse to watch it...  In any case, I seriously doubt this is the case with this concert.  The background instruments (congas, tambourine, etc...) were all in sync with the songs and you could hear Sade's voice fade in and out at the exact spots she moved away from the mic.  Perhaps there was a cut to an instrument or two that was a little off in the edits, but you would have to consciously be looking for mistakes as I was.  I know in today's age of lip-synching pop stars, vocal harmonizers, and drum machines it's difficult to imagine a band that sounds as good live as they do in the studio, but this band is just that good.
Recorded live at the San Diego Open Air Theatre, this DVD gives you a great selection of Sade's classic hits.  No flashy stages or explosions here.  The subtle lighting combined with Sade's breathy voice invokes the intimate feel of a jazz nightclub.  The director does a great job of showcasing the various band members, but keeps the focus primarily on Sade throughout the show.  The sound quality is excellent (especially considering it was recorded ten years ago) and this DVD edition doesn't have the lighting problems and graininess the VHS owners were complaining about.
Even if you own all her albums, you'll want this live performance to add to your collection.  Watch it with someone you love.",1059004800,24,1483,4.541353383458647

One of the three is a collection of her videos and though they are well done, there is just nothing like watching an artist--especially someone as talented and emotive as Sade--perform her songs live; it adds another dimension to the experience. It is strange that her music is very different than the music that I like, but yet it still appeals to me. I can't even classify her music; there are a lot of musical genres but there is just one Sade.",1052265600,6,516,4.329896907216495
615389,5,6303266371,"Thanks to all the reviewers.  You helped me decide on this purchase.  I had been leaning towards the 2002 Lovers Live concert but many reviewers who have seen both say the 1993 concert (this DVD) was more energetic.
I thought the concert was hypnotic.  Sade's graceful, floating, rhythmic body language was intriguing.
The 5.1 sound mix is amazing good.  It is clear and strong with good bass.  I had not expected it to be as good as it is since the concert dates back to 1993.  But the sound is great!
The image quality is good when showing Sade in the spotlight.  The quality drops to ""blurry"" when showing Sade out of the spotlight or when showing band members.  This all boils down to the lighting.  The lighting was probably fine for the audience but could have been better for making this DVD.",1048636800,,799,4.531468531468532
615390,5,6303266371,"For those who are die-hard Sade fans this is a absolute must for your collection. For anyone who is a fan of utter extreme musical talent and stunning beauty, well this one is for you too. No matter what venue she chooses to perform in she brings a class and quality to her shows that stands alone in the jazz community. If you have never seen Sade in concert, then this DVD is just like being there! Old classic tunes like ""The Sweetest Taboo"",""Smooth Operator""and""Stronger Than Pride"" are all brought to life within this fantastic collection. Sade also shows the tremendous chemistry she shares with her back-up group, and she provides the artists ample time to showcase their talents. Sade's background group goes by the name of ""Sweetback"", they recorded a solo project a few years back that is also a must for Jazz fans. Bottom line, splendid offering, buy it as soon as you can",1027814400,4,883,4.666666666666667
615391,5,6303266371,"Without a doubt this and her new Lover's Rock are two of the best live DVDs you will ever find.  The reason?? Well..besides one of the best perfomers as well as an amazing looking woman, she has one of the best, tightest bands you will ever hear.  They are so tight and together that each song just amazing.  I love Sade and this is one I take out of my DVD collection time after time.",1023321600,,385,4.1066666666666665
615392,5,6303266371,"I purchased both (Sade - Live Concert & Sade - Life Promise Pride Love) at a local store that was advertising them as a package deal. This is the closest I've come to seeing her live. She came to the ATL with India. Arie but I wasn't available to attend. I own the live CD version of this concert, but this is much better to see her and Sweatback perform. Sade's style is more suggestive than hypnotic but still she's maintained her popularity among the contemporary audiences. She became an instant sensation through such songs as ""Smooth Operator"" and ""Your Love Is King,"" where the slick production and quasi-jazz backing add a defining meaning to her sound. The delightful addition to this DVD is its 5.1 Dolby Digital sound. I've purchased many concert DVD's and they're all sitting somewhere collecting dust. This one is played everytime I want to hear Sade.
I saw the advertisment for her new DVD ""Sade - Lovers Live"", I'll be on top of that one on the release date.

615393,5,6303266371,"I was impressed when I saw this concert aired on PBS in the mid-90's, and I'm even more impressed with the DVD.  In terms of live performance discs, this one is at the top of my list.
Touring in support of her fourth album, ""Love Deluxe,"" Sade was in top form for this October 1993 concert, recorded at the San Diego University Open Air Theatre.  On-screen, she looks fantastic and sounds even better (that voice!).  Her persona is at-once confident yet reserved, appreciative, carefree and even demurely sexy at times.  Her band members play really tight and show off their talent by taking up a variety of instruments.  [Note:  Rick Braun on trumpet; one of my favorite jazz artists].  The seventeen songs are divided fairly well between old and new (at the time), with ten being from the latter two albums ""Stronger Than Pride"" and ""Love Deluxe.""  I can think of a couple more earlier hits I would have liked to hear, but tours need to highlight the most recent work, so I'm okay with that.
Visually, I can't say enough good things about this disc.  With Sade, the attraction has to be the singer, and I'm glad that the film crew kept that in mind, while spending no time at all on the audience (not the case with so many concerts-for-TV spectacles these days), yet still giving the band its due during some nice solos and instrumental flourishes.  In fact, the camera always seemed to be focused right where I wanted to look.  Big thumbs up in that regard.
Even though there's a lack of interactive features, I don't care:  it's the concert that counts.  I'd recommend this DVD to anyone, whether you're a Sade fan or not.",1012089600,32,1626,4.58477508650519
615394,4,6303266371,"For all Sade fans, this is a must!  However, the actual DVD (seems like VHS as opposed to watching a DVD) is lacking in the quality you might see in other DVD concerts such as Madonna, Janet, Santana, etc.  This is the only reason the rating is less than 5 stars.  But if you can look past that, it will bring back memories of seeing her in concert.  Her sensual moves and distinct voice transcend the average quality of the recording.  Also, her band is second to none!  For all of you who know and enjoy Sade, you know that Sade is more than one person.  It is a band first and foremost.  You get a feel for the type of relationship the bandmembers have and it only adds to the enjoyment of this disc.  You will not be disappointed!",995155200,,734,4.185714285714286
615395,5,6303266371,"If you are a fan of Sade and her music, you will really enjoy this DVD.  I actually purchased the video around 1993 but having on DVD really enhances the concert.  The 5.1 Dolby Digital sound is wonderful to hear and the clarity in the DVD format is amazing.  This is a wonderful concert because the song selection spans the depth of Sade's music career with the exception of her new release, ""Lover's Rock"".  This DVD rivals her ""Best of"" CD released several years prior.  However, just listening to this DVD performace surpasses the experience of her ""Best of"" CD because her band is wonderful.  This concert features some wonderful extended versions of ""Cherish the Day"" and ""Smooth Operator"" as well as great concert versions of her other hit songs.  Her vocal performace is fabulous and the energy of both her and her band trancend from the DVD into your living room.  A great buy.",995068800,12,886,4.670967741935484

615397,5,6303266371,"I want to address the misnomers about this DVD particularly those reviewers who think this is a ""dubbed"" concert.  You can tell by watching the musicians matching up with the music (watch the guitarist!) and the ad libs of Sade - PLUS the songs ARE differenet from the CDs.  It is just very well recorded and because it is probably directly from the soundboard.",993254400,2,361,4.625
615408,4,6303266371,"The music is really great! My Sade collection is large, and I know all the songs that are on the disc, but it's really special to hear the songs in a little different setting. The other artists are playing and singing very very nice (with some of the best live basslines and drumbeats I've heard) and the whole video I've been listening with much joy!
The pictures are great. The performance is good. The stage is very nice, and Sade is ofcourse really beautifull. Camerawork is also done very good, not zooming in to maximum on the singers face (like most other music videos do: you can't see anything at all from the rest).
BUT (like b3fan also said): this is NOT a live performance. All singing has been dubbed in the studio, and what you hear is NOT the live music recording. What's especially anoying is that almost NOWHERE the sound is in sync with the video. I'd like to ask Sony (their production) to treat their customers with a little more respect! It's like watching a cartoon! Lips are never in sync there either!
Conclusion: If you want a real live performance really don't buy this video. In all other cases BUY this video! The music is perfect, and in spite of the studio-dubbing-that-isnt-lipsync-at-all-failure I really wouldn't want to miss this disc from my collection!",992304000,3,1288,4.6784140969163
615409,5,6303266371,"A stunning performance from this incredible performer and band. You are missing out on everything Sade has to offer if you have only heard her music. She, and her band, will have you mesmerized for this entire concert (filmed in San Diego in 1993). Incredible as she is when the concert starts, she only seems to gain energy as she progresses through her greatest hits, my favorite performance being Is It A Crime. The only hit this DVD lacks is Never as Good As The First Time which in my opinion would have made a better second encore then Jezebel. Although, Jezebel is an excellent showcase for the wonderful musicians Sade has surrounding her. So turn down the lights, open a bottle of wine, grab your significant other and head to the couch for an evening ...",991353600,,764,4.583941605839416
615410,5,6303266371,"Sade Live is an incredible collection of Sade hits collected into one concert video.  Filmed in 1994, the video includes all of her hits with the exception of ""Never as good as the first time"".  In fact, the concert DVD has almost the same songs as Sade's greatest hits CD.
Before purchasing this DVD I was not too familiar with Sade's music.  I basically knew four or five top-ten hits from the 80's and very little beyond that.  Since purchasing the DVD I have really come to appreciate the beauty in songs like ""Cherish"" and ""Kiss of Life"".
One of the most appealing aspects of this DVD is being able to observe the band doing what they do best....playing live.  The band members are all multi-talented musicians with several of them switching instruments between and even during songs.  The interaction between the band members seems real and spontaneous and they seem to be having a great time.  One scene where Sade is interacting with an audience member is actually more memorable due to her bandmates' reactions than to her actions with the fan.
Another selling point is Helen Folasade Adu herself.  Having seen a few promotional photos I knew her to be an extremely attractive person but I was not prepared for the reality.  She is one of the most beautiful and sensual performers I have ever seen.  The emotion and intensity she puts into her singing and onstage movements still has me captivated....even after watching the video countless times.
The only real criticism I have of the DVD is that aside from a written biography (very short!) there are absolutely no DVD extras!  I've gotten used to DVD's having bonus footage, interviews, ""making of"" documentaries, etc.. but this one is sadly lacking in that area.
In spite of that, this is an incredible DVD and anyone who even remotely likes Sade and watching live performances should purchase it.",990921600,16,1860,4.799373040752351

615413,5,6303266371,"Sade has been symbolizing the extraordinary, graceful, exotically beautiful and ,most of all, talented high-quality female pop singer with her different musical career since her debut at the beginning of the 80s. She's always chosen to be less commercial in contrast to most of her peers in the pop business. So her image and music have gained a clear and flawless status gradually and silently in time. In retrospect, with her current album which was released at the end of 2000, she made only five albums which bear the timeless SADE taste throughout her musical career. This concert-dvd contains her most of the hits taken from her first four albums. During the concert she really know how to combine her musical talent with her sleek and charming look. Consequently, this makes her performance unforgettable. Shortly, you should have this live concert dvd if you're into R&B, pop jazz, soul even latin musical genre with the meaningful and emotional lyrics under the exceptional name, SADE. i assure you that you won't regret!",986947200,,1030,5.029239766081871

Does this mean I don't recommend this DVD? Well, I was a little disappointed at first... But, the music score is well done, and it's fun to see Sade and all her excellent musicians.  I just think of it as having a collection of MTV-like videos.  They're pretending to be performing live.
I have been in a few ""mock"" audiences myself.  The music played through the PA speakers, and the band members ""lip-synched"" as if they were really performing.  We, in the audience did our best to act as though it was a real concert - all for the cameras.
If you're OK with a ""pretend"" LIVE DVD of Sade, then buy this.  But, if you want a REAL LIVE concert caught on DVD, then this is not for you.",984441600,7,863,4.1437125748503

I was a bit disappointed with the DVD with regards to the transfer. I was fortunate to have seen this same concert on Laserdisc about four years ago, and I seem to recall it to be much brighter and more vibrant in color.

615460,5,6303266371,"Recently Sade ended their seven-year hiatus with the fine year 2000 LOVER'S ROCK album, which is musically so-close-yet-so-far from their 1984-1993 recordings.  SADE LIVE (recorded in San Diego, October 1993) closes the book on the first decade of their/her musical career, presenting live versions of eighteen songs culled from the first four albums.  Obviously this is a must-have for fans, but anybody who wants to hear these memorable songs again periodically should be happy with either this collection and/or the simultaneously-issued videoclip compilation (LIFE PROMISE PRIDE LOVE).
All of the hits are here, plus a few choice album tracks.  The remastered 5.1 sound is excellent on this DVD release, capturing their live sound with clarity and fullness.  The DVD has a few minor extras besides the surround sound, such as chapter access, a discography, a brief biography (basically a press release for LOVER'S ROCK), and offering the option to display lyrics karaoke-style on the screen in several languages.
For the most part, the group sticks closely to the original studio versions in these performances, although occasionally the group's subtle jazz touches become more overt (particularly on SMOOTH OPERATOR).  Mostly though, vocalist Sade Adu is in the forefront, singing with a quiet fire and at times physically moving within the flow of the music.  Never demonstrative either vocally or in her stage mannerisms, she nonetheless is a captivating presence both to hear and to look at, and her voice is in top form throughout this concert.",982800000,48,1553,5.318367346938776
