With the fun extra's on the menu it makes it a lot more fun and interesting this movie also has a free mini movie in front of it to get you into the right and fun frame of mind. If you liked the first too movies you'll not be disopponted with this, I conclude that if you like the Pokemon series and Movie series this is a must have for any fan.",992995200,3,417,3.9176470588235293
1622385,5,B00005LKLF,"Each Pokemon movie has something special about that the other ones don't have. I'd have to say that the first 1 is still the best, while Pokemon 2000 has it's really good parts. This movie's special parts are that that compared to the other movies and shows, the plot of this movie is intense, and way more exiting then the others. Also the moviez graphics is so great compared to the other movies itz ridiculous. I think this movie definetly haz its good partz for young audiences, but also older audiences will enjoy this too, and i don't care what other people have to say about the show, because in my opinion, u can be 95 years old, and still like pokemon. It's what we like, and nobody can tell us otherwiz!! Well, back to the subject, u should buy this video the 1st day it comes out if ur a big pokemon fan or not.",992563200,4,822,4.2756410256410255

1622387,1,B00005LKLF,"HELLO! Pokemon is like, the most annoying thing that's come out since...since...oh, I don't know! All I know is that everything about Pokemon is completely annoying and if you are over 12 years old, then it should be avoided at all costs! This movie makes me barf. And that little ""cute"" Pikachu is so annoying. Agh! Pokemon makes me scream! I hate all Japaneese animation because while it may look all cute and everything, it is really bad animation. Also, when the characters speak, their mouths move way too fast and they talk way too fast, too. This movie isn't even worth taking your kids to see...you'll be too embarrassed being there to even sit straight up in your seat! All this movie's about is fighting, fighting, fighting. Fighting over what? There really is no point to this movie! Is there even a a real script? Who cares if the little fuzzy furrballs are cute? I think they're horrible-looking creatures from Planet Hell. It is totally unrealistic and is just a way to kill time and to get your kids to shut up for a few hours. So I guess it is good for that. But besides that, please, please, PLEASE don't waste your money on this annoying [stuff]! While the kids may like it, teens and adults will find it rather embarrassing and horrible. If you're over 12 years old and you like Pokemon, then there is something terribly wrong with you! Have you gone for a brain check-up recently? Maybe you should if you're over 12 years old and liked this movie!",991008000,8,1467,4.5606060606060606
1622388,5,B00005LKLF,I saw the movie when it came and when I saw the info  on it I thought that this had had to have been the  best movie they had made and it was. If you have kids that are Pokemon fans I think you should take them to  see this movie. It starts with Pikachu and Pichu.  Pichu are brothers who meet Pikachu and Pikachu gets in  trouble with this Pokemon that I don't know who it was.  Then they get onto the movie and that was so cool to show all those new Pokemon that are not in the show.  They really showed what this Pokemon are really like when  they are in the wild.  A MUST SEE MOVIE FOR KIDS ALL AGES!!!,986947200,9,606,3.8225806451612905
1622389,5,B00005LKLF,"I just got back from watching this awesome movie (on the date this is being submitted) I think the movie was great, but i really didn't care for the Pikachu and Pichu short movie.  I was suprised to see the new Pokemon that Ash was using in this movie, but unfortunatly you didn't get to see them long enough and what there talents and ablilties are. And in ending this, I was glad to see Charizard towards the end and to see how he listend to Ash when he needed him the most and how powerful a Pokemon he really is.",986688000,3,516,4.108910891089109
1622390,5,B00005LKLF,"You all will LOVE this Movie! I must say, WB did a good job with the ""less advertising hype"" this time around, as to avoid UNWANTED critic nagging. Anyway, the third Pokemon film is VERY cool! Let's have a look:
The OVA, ""Pikachu And Pichu"" is in short, another OVA with Pikachu and the other Pokemon who are Trained by Ash-tachi being left alone for a little while again. Only this time, Two Pichu Brother's moon and anger Pikachu, so he gets angry and chases after them. After he catches up to them, this silly OVA goes for a non-stop comedy spree! See it for yourself in a manner of Days...
The main Movie, ""The Spell Of The Unown"" is about a Professor named Professor Spencer Hale, whom has a 5 year old Daughter whom he raises by himself (his wife passed away)and cares about very much. As a Pokemon Researcher, hearing about ancient Pokemon Hieroglyphics is excting news for him! But when these Hieroglyphics turn out to be the Ancient and mysterious Pokemon, the Unown, they send him into another dimension. Alone and sad, with only the servants in her mansion and no family, his daughter Molly crys and Prays.(in the Japanese version, the DIRECT translation of Her Prayer is: ""Please my sweet days, return to me!"") She hopes Her Parents will return, but instead the Unown come, and THEY help Her! The Unown have the ability to turn Human thoughts and emotions into reality! Her whole mansion is turned into a Crystal Tower, and the Unown's Spell has the Legendary Fire Dog Pokemon Entei, be Her new Father, in place of Her missing one. In the meantime, the area, (in the Japanese version, it is called ""Greenfield"") Ash just finishes a tied up match with another Trainer, and is surprised to see His Mother and Prof. Oak there on vacation! Molly then decides Delia will be the PERFECT new Mom, and Entei kidnaps Her for Molly. Now Ash and His Friends must all confront Molly's imigination, Entei Himself, and the Unown, if Ash wishes to get His Mother back, otherwise HE WILL be an orphan missing His Parents!
Oh, WB is cheap and is behind by a few Episodes, so here is some differences You will see in the Movie, (when it ACTUALLY takes place, 6 Eps from Today) compared to where WB is rught now:
Ash's Squirtle has left. Ash has a Totodile. Ash has a Shiny Noctowl. Misty's Poliwag evolved into Poliwhirl.
Oh, and one more thing, your NOT seeing things, Charizard returns!",985996800,19,2382,4.5807962529274

1622414,1,B00005LKLF,"Did not receive proper copy of the movie. Paid almost $60 and still got the cheaper version (without Pikachu short, bonus features etc.) mailed to me. Had to send back for refund.

Do yourself a favor and just get the cheaper $13 copy to start with. You won't get the Pikachu shorts but it will save you the disappointment of getting the wrong package.

Movie is good and still holds up over time. CGI effects blend in well with the 2d animation and the story while simple is still well done. Still as good as it was when I was a kid.

1622422,5,B00005LKLF,If you've ever hated Pokemon movies for being too cliche or wanted Ash to actually do something that matters this is the best Pokemon movie. In short it's basically the closest thing to Pokemon attempting a serious story and with Ash's mother getting kidnapped he is genuinely and understandably pissed and goes on a quest into what the trailer calls the Tower of the Unown. If there's something to be learned from this is that if you lose a loved one you should learn to cope with it since crying won't bring them back from the dead and it's best to eventually move on. Critics gave this one a terrible reputation which it doesn't deserve seeing as I am no longer a Pokemon fan but I can now appreciate the quality this film had. Also it's like the 4kids theatrical dub with the least edits.,1467331200,,792,4.468965517241379

1622427,5,B00005LKLF,"I'm so happy this movie has the Pikachu and Pichu short along with the movie, those shorts were always my favorite and I still love them to this day, the case is a little flimsy so I have to be careful with it but it's the original so I'm not surprised. The case opened by lifting a flap on the front of the dvd case, this has cased a slight indent towards the flap due to the cover not being a super hard case and bending over the years but thats alright. The movie runs smoothly and doesn't stop at all. It does have a couple weird visual glitches when it side scrolls the movie sort of distorts but honestly it took me a couple runs of the movie to actually notice the distortion. it only happens when the picture side scrolls for a long time it gets a sort of fish eye lens effect but it goes away once it stops scrolling and the picture goes back to normal so to me its not a big deal.
So hard to fins this movie thats not super overpriced for a ridiculous amount

1622438,3,B00005LKLF,"PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING DISCLOSURE PRIOR TO BUYING! - If you are looking for English subtitles/caption, 5.1 surround sound, Pikachu Shorts or any extras - THIS RELEASE IS NOT FOR YOU AS IT DOES NOT CONTAIN ANY!

This version is a re-release of the first three movies on Blu-Ray & DVD in its original theatrical widescreen format. You get the complete, uncropped footage of the Pokemon movies the way it was meant to be seen!

Video: The footage you see in this version is from the remastered ""HIGH DEFINITION"" films that was done by the Pokemon Company years ago in Japan, although you get English title cards, English credits, and the same EDITED version of all three movies. Note: the quality isn't TRUE HIGH DEFINITION, it is an upscale from the standard source.

The image isn't much of an upgrade, to be honest. Although the colors are slightly brighter and the image is a bit cleaner, the previous Warner Bros. edition was a sharper - not much of a difference from this new version but it was noticeable to me, especially if you are a videophile like me.

So if you don't have the previous out of print version, or if it's damaged/lost, then you may want to purchase this one. If you are a collector and must have every version that there is out there, WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR?! GRAB IT NOW! Otherwise, it really isn't worth the ""upgrade"".

Here is a comparison of the previous cropped, fullscreen movie and the new widescreen movie:
[...]

Audio: This is the most disappointing thing. For some reason the audio was downgraded to 2.0 stereo mix (the Warner Bros. version had 5.1 audio). Meanwhile the Australian re-release version for the first two movies has 5.1 audio and 2.0 for the third movie. By the way, there are no director's commentary tracks or any other languages.

Subtitles/Caption: The back of the cover says it was English subtitles but there are NONE ON THE SOURCE.

Menus:
The menus for the DVD version are still images with just two buttons: PLAY and SCENES. The same goes for the Blu-Ray version but there are a few moments of the movie that you get to see before it goes to the still motionless menu.
- The scenes menu is just just simple as well, 14 chapters that are numbered and that is it! (The number of chapters varies per movie)

Here are images of the menus:
[...]
[...]
[...]

Extras: None on the source! There are no Pikachu Shorts, although it is stated in the description of the listing that the Pikachu Shorts are included. I suggest you buy a cheap version of the Warner release, and if you already have it then keep it.

1622448,5,B00005LKLF,"This movie is the best Pokmon movie of them all, no other way to put it. The story in this one really shines when compared to the others. Really in the other movies Ash and his friends could be replaced by anyone and the story would play out the same but this time Ash really does have a stake in things and not because he is some plot convenient chosen one but because his mother is in danger. Also It has what you would want in Pokemon actual battles between trainers and people using Pokmon to overcome obstacles. In the more resent movies you may not even see any of the groups Pokmon other than in the beginning to establish what point in the anime this would be but here we get a lot of Ash and his friend using their Pokmon in cool ways including one of the most awesome battles ever Charizard VS. Entei.

I also felt the antagonist of this movie Molly was very interesting, She wasn't some villain trying to capture Pokmon, She's a little girl that doesn't even fully understand what it is that she's doing. She had clear motivation as to why she did what she did, what happened to her was relatable and you even felt sympathy for her and by the end you can be happy for her. We had some of that with Mewtwo and he is really awesome but I felt what was done with Molly's character worked better.

And thankfully almost nothing is changed in the English dub and no bad pops songs that have nothing to do with Pokemon flooding the credits just one made for the movie that is pretty decent.

Overall you can tell it's the best just by watching it, but watching it after seeing the newer movies makes it even better by comparison. It's great for Pokmon fans of all ages and will without a doubt hold up as the best.",1411344000,,1719,4.250764525993884

1622457,5,B00005LKLF,"I am a fan of pokemon since I was a kid, and have watched every single pokemon movie that has been released, even the newer ones that make me want to puke. This movie is in my opinion one of the big three, and possibly the greatest of the first three.
Here is why, unlike the first two movies this one has a plot, and more than that, realistic emotions and psychological understanding.
Since this movie was released so long ago, I am going to assume that you have already seen it, so I may spoil the ending.
Basically, this movie is about an eight year old girl named molly. Her mother disappeared a long time ago, so she is very close to her father. While studying a strange group of pokemon known as the unknown, her father disappears. Crushed by the sadness, when she accidentally awakens the unknown in the box that was brought back, the unknown start trying to grant her wish. They create an Entei, the lion like legendary who she then believes is her father. Then the entire castle is encased in crystal.
This actually makes sense. She doesn't want to face reality, she wants to remain isolated and live in her imagination which is made real by the unknown. When Ash's mother is kidnapped by Entei to be Molly's mother, he comes to the rescue.
Personally, I think the battle between Charizard and Entei is one of the greatest in the entire series. And again, when the battle ends Moly is shocked at what she is doing and just wants it to end. Tired of illusions, she says the line that makes this movie ""I want things to be real again.""
They go to stop the unknown, but only Entei is strong enough to face them, and upon destroying them he destroys himself and bids farewell to molly.
I think that this movie is great because it explores the idea of hiding from reality due to grief of sadness. She lost her father and no longer had a family, she didn't want to face reality. She wanted to pretend that entei was her father and drive away everyone else. But in the end, she came to face reality.
The only downside to this movie, is that for some reason the soundtrack was never released. Instead its a ""totally pokemon"" pop cd with a bunch of crappy songs, you don't get the amazing and epic music like the tear inducing ""If that is what you wish"" song that plays when Entei fights to free everyone from the unknown and disappears.
I think that the price for the cd is worth it, because this is a movie that should last generations, and sadly no one plays casset tapes anymore.",1375228800,,2483,4.376623376623376

While the movies may have a couple errors that would rarely be seen in the regular TV series, that's just one thing that makes them fun to watch. Some of my friends, including my sister, claim this to be their favorite movie of the series. I'm 20 years old and have been a Pok&eacute;mon fan since playing Pok&eacute;mon Blue Version on my Game Boy Pocket, and watching this movie today brings back memories. Not to mention with more life experiences, the story becomes that much more deep to a lifelong fan.

1622468,5,B00005LKLF,"It's a nice sunny day in the big city, a Lapras tour boat passes a Dratini gondola along the river and a bus drives along a street. The scene then goes along a street of sheets being hung out to dry before focusing on the Pichu's den where the Pichu Brothers are happily chasing each other amongst the piles of junk. They then run up a stack of tires to a see saw and they both sit on it and bounce on it for a little while until it won't bounce any more so they try bouncing harder only making Pichu's younger bro roll into him

The Pichu bros then decide to call out for their friends. The first to hear them is Smoochum who is trying to get a hair straight whilst looking in her mirror. Next Magby hears them call out. Wooper who is happily swimming around a barrel near a water tower also hears them and jumps out of the barrel.

Meanwhile in a tree Teddiursa is sitting on a branch eating some nuts he has stored in it and nearly chokes when he hears the Pichu Bros calling out.

Smoochum and Magby run through a hole in a fence and Wooper jumps off some tires and they all jump on the see saw. Teddiursa who is late jumps on the other side of the see saw to even things out causing Wooper to fly into the sky through the clock of Pichu's house and lands on the slide of which he happily slides down and jumps off at the end. Everyone else decides its fun and all go to the top of the slide. Pichu's younger bro who is impatient decides he will go first and march's towards the edge of the slide so his older bro decides to pull him away except he slips and falls onto a bit of wood.

Pichu's younger bro then climbs back up and starts arguing with his older bro and pulls down his eyelid and sticks his tongue out and they both angrily stare and put their heads together, Magby then decides to stop them arguing and steps in between them only to be hit by Pichu's younger bro which makes Magby fall down onto the tires and Wooper and Teddiursa come to investigate and Magby starts getting red and literally blows his top except Teddiursa holds Wooper whilst he water gun's Magby to cool him down.

The Pichu bro's are still arguing and Smoochum decides to stop them arguing this time except the Pichu Bro' start sparking a shock each other as well as Smoochum in the process as well as Magby and Teddiursa, however they have both made them selves dizzy from using too much electricity and Pichu's younger bro falls backwards down the slide, fly's off the end into some junk and emerges flat out on a skateboard and Wooper jumps on a roller-skate and chases after him as the skateboard with Pichu on rolls through the fence and down a steep hill, across a busy road and into a park with Wooper chasing after him.

Meanwhile Azumarill is in a flower bed and watches as Pichu and Wooper go past and stop on a stretch of road, Suddenly a truck is heading towards them so Azumarill sucks in some air and lets out a powerful water gun that pushes them away from the truck to the other side of the road, of where they come to a standstill again and Pichu wakes up wondering where he is and suddenly realises that he had an argument with his bro and sits angrily whilst Wooper stares at him. Meanwhile at the other side of the city Pichu's older bro wakes up and looks for his bro and is upset he has disappeared.

Back in the park Pichu's younger bro is walking angrily with his arms folded until he sees some balloons which suddenly makes him happy and sneakily hides behind a dustbin and gets Wooper to do the same, they then crawl quietly along the floor towards the balloons and stop and notice the balloon seller has dozed off to sleep so Pichu tip toes up to double check and then climbs up to where the balloons are and grabs the string of which lifts him into the air whilst Wooper looks on with a confused look on his face. Pichu's older bro, Magby, Smoochum and Teddiursa however have entered the park in their search for Pichu's younger bro and start calling out for him.

Azumarill is still tending to her flowers as Pichu and co walk past and spy the skateboard and roller-skate. They then run across the road to them thinking Pichu's younger bro must be near! Azumarill then appears and Pichu tells her what happened and She tells them the direction they headed in so Pichu and co decide to go in the direction Azumarill told them. Teddiursa spots a nut on the floor and picks it up and eats it and then suddenly sees a whole load of nuts scattered on the floor and sits down and starts to eat them until he sees a passing Murkrow and decides to gather them up so it doesn't spot them and take them.

Meanwhile Pichu's younger bro is floating above the park is shouting out for help and suddenly spots his brother and shouts again and his bro turns round to see nothing in the sky but a Murkrow. Elsewhere Wooper walks along side a lake whilst nearby Pichu and co are looking near a building in the park, Smoochum suddenly spots Pichu's bro floating in the sky and his older bro calls out to him. Suddenly a gust of wind catches the balloons Pichu is holding onto and blows him into some paint cans that are on top of some scaffolding that is next to the park building which knocks them over 1 by 1 causing Pichu and co to run away from them. And as they jump off the end of the plank they all bounce off Houndour's head as he just happens to be sleeping there which wakes him up just as he gets covered with a pot of yellow paint and Pichu Smoochum and Magby run away only to notice Pichu's younger bro has been blown into the distance. Suddenly a rather now angry Houndour appears behind them and starts chasing them out of the park, through the streets to beside the river, Pichu and co suddenly skid to a halt at a dead end until Houndour skids into them knocking them into the river.

Suddenly some big eyes spy from a sewer pipe as a shadowy Pokmon runs out of it and dives into the water to save them, suddenly a blue tail emerges from the water lifting Pichu, Smoochum, Houndour and Magby up, we now see that the Pokmon is non other than a Feraligatr, they thank it and it gently tosses them out of the water and Pichu, Magby and Smoochum land safely back in the park and Smoochum checks her hair in the mirror whilst Houndour bounce off a shop canopy onto a pavement where a Snorlax rolls over and squashes him.

Meanwhile back in the park Wooper is swimming round the fountain pool whilst Pichu's younger brother hangs on for life to the balloon string he then spots a Murkrow (yes the same one) heading towards him which starts to pop his balloons which makes the balloons lose height. Teddiursa is now carrying his now collected nuts and puts them in the mouth of a Magikarp statue. He then hears Pichu above him who is losing height and starts running around thinking what to do. He then spots Wooper and goes and grabs him and runs as Murkrow pops the final balloon causing Pichu to fall.

Teddiursa then gets Wooper to water gun at Pichu which gives him a nice wet but comfy landing, until Wooper runs out of water making him dizzy eyed which causes Pichu to fall onto Wooper and Teddiursa. They then all laugh and walk back to the Pichu's den where Pichu's older brother is standing with his arms folded and tapping his foot along with an unhappy Smoochum and Magby.

The Pichu bros then start to argue again and Teddiursa starts running around whilst Smoochum tells Magby to go get some help quick. So Magby runs off to find Azumarill of whom he pushes back to Pichu's den where they are now sparking cheeks at each other again and Teddiursa is still running around. Azumarill tells them to stop except when the Pichu bro's shock each other Azumarill ends up getting hit by a stray spark. Anyways the Pichu bros make them selves dizzy again from their electricity and fall flat out on the floor. Magby, Smoochum and Teddiursa try to wake them up as Azumarill is now Very angry for being shocked and they run off leaving the Pichu bro's still flat out on the floor. The Pichu bros now wake up and get scared by Azumarill who aims a water gun at them but misses and then ends up soaking Magby, Smoochum and Teddiursa.

Smoochum looks in her mirror noticing she is all wet and gets mad and starts using a Icy wind attack everywhere. Now every time Azumarill uses her water gun it gets frozen by Smoochum's icy wind until a bit of ice falls down and hits Magby on the head which gets him angry and makes him use flamethrower and now when Azumarill uses water gun and Smoochum uses icy wind, Magby's flamethrower carves the ice into a slide until the whole place is covered with an icy slide. This makes the Pokmon stop what their doing and forget about everything as they gaze at the beautiful sight.

They all decide to go on it and line up and as before Pichu's younger bro goes at the front but Pichu's older bro reminds him about not pushing in and he embarrassedly agrees whilst everyone goes on the slide and has fun as the story comes to a close.",1343174400,,8979,4.298463356973995

1622476,5,B00005LKLF,"There's not much to say so I'm gonna make this short.

I remember seeing this movie many years ago with family and friends in the movie theater. If this came out in 2001, then that means I was just 6 years old. Even now at 15 I still love it. After the downfall of Pokemon with the start of the DP saga(s) I haven't watched it since but now that they've put the Johto saga back on on the Boomerang network, I'm starting to get back into the spirit and have begun rewatching the Hoenn saga in Japanese.

The movie is very simple since it's intended for children audiences. A girl's parents' disappear and she gets lonely, the Unknown Pokemon, able to tap into the minds of other lifeforms, ""merge"" with Molly's (the little girl) mind and sense that she is angry and sad and act on those feelings and create a crystal fortress where she will be able to live with her new ""dad"" Entei, another one of the Unknown's creations from Molly's mind. Then she decided she wants a Mommy and has Entei kidnap Ash's mommy and he has to go rescue her.

The movie kinda starts slow but picks up fast, and things really get going once an old friend of Ash rejoins him for a fight against Entei, an event I totally forgot about and was surprised to see occur.

This is a perfect movie for any Pokemon fan (any Pokemon movie is perfect for a Pokemon fan!), or any child who loves adventure shows. The movie might seem a bit sad for children though. But I advise anyone who plans to buy it, please stick around until the ending credits are over, you don't want to miss the secret conclusion to Molly's story! I remember that part from when I saw it in the movie theater when I was little but even I was surprised when it popped up at the end because I had forgotten it.

However this movie isn't canon since Ash meets Unknown later on in the last season of Johto (MasterQuest) while this movie takes place during the first season of Johto. It's not canon because Ash, Misty, and Brock act as if they never seen an Unknown before. I watched that episode on a library rented DVD before I watched the movie and by watching the episode I started to remember many things that occured in the movie. They even showed Unknown's world in the episode! Everything in the episode is probably not canon for those who didn't see the movie.",1281830400,3,2305,4.338747099767981

However, you cannot choose to watch the short by itself; you have to select ""Play"" on the main menu in order to view it.

There ended up being six special features included on this DVD release.  The first is a documentary called, ""Making of 'To Know the Unknown'.""  It's about the girl group Innosense recording the song for the ending credits of the film.  Unfortunately, the audio quality of the interview footage isn't the best.

You can also choose to watch a verion of the film with an audio commentary from the directors of the English dub.  The ""Johto Pokerap"" is included; however, in my opinion, this Pokerap isn't anywhere near as good as the original Pokerap.

The theatrical trailer for the English dub of this film is included.  There is also a Japanese trailer for the fourth Pokemon film; however, there are no subtitles, so if you don't know Japanese, you won't understand what's being said.  Lastly, there is a text-only feature labeled, ""Little Known Unown Facts.""  I thought this feature was a waste, because all of these facts come out during the course of the film.

Overall, Pokemon The Movie 3 is an enjoyable film.  While there are some issues I have with the special features on this DVD, I would still recommend that this DVD should be in the collection of any Pokemon fan.",1223942400,,1521,4.694339622641509

1622484,5,B00005LKLF,"It's sad to admit, but as an avid Pokemaniac, I've seen all the Pokemon movies released to the present time, and own the majority of them.  With that in mind, I can honestly state that this is the finest cinematic piece associated with the Pokemon name, and remains one of my favorite animated films.

 In terms of plot, this film has one which is quite rich compared to the rest of it's contemporaries.  A flock of psychic Pokemon named the Unown are able to take the thoughts and wishes of a little girl named Molly, and render them into reality.  It sort of parallels that famous Twilight Zone episode in which a little boy can use his omnipotent powers to terrorize his family, however, with Pokemon being aimed at children, it isn't quite so sinister in its delivery.

 The animation of this movie is very lush.  The landscapes are extremely well done, and certainly stand out as one of the film's major highlights.  The self-induced surreal world in which Molly inhabits is glassy, effervescently crystalline, very hallucinogenic.  In one segment of the film, Ash (in attempts to rescue his kidnaped mom), runs up a set of stairs, suspended in a green void, with stagnant orbs floating above and underneath him.  Most enjoyable.

 The battles in this film are enthralling as well.  In one of them films many strange sequences, Misty battles Molly literally underwater, although both are able to breathe without drowning.  Brock's battle with Molly in an imaginary meadow of flowers follows.  And the climactic fiery slugfest between Charizard and Entai is one of Pokemon's high points.

 It's a shame that Pokemon 3 was released at a time when Pokemania was in sharp decline, being that this movie really is superior to it's two predecessors (as well as all films which followed for that matter).  Recommended for fans of animated films.  A must for Pokemon fans.",1142294400,2,1869,4.83596214511041

If you're unfamiliar with the basics, Pokemon (short for ""POcKEt MONsters"") are creatures a little like those from this world, but with strange and unusual powers and abilities that they use for their masters - masters that can be either good or evil.  Ash and his friends train their Pokemon to fight battles with their enemies.  They travel all over the planet to collect new and unusual types of Pokemon.  They trap Pokemon in ""Poke Balls"" - a small device that hangs from a belt.  When Ash's enemies release their Pokemon to do their work, Ash and his friends release their Pokemon, and they have a big battle.
The story revolves around Molly and her missing father.  Molly's father had been involved in an archaeological expedition to find out more about the mysterious ""Unown"" - Pokemon that look like letters of the English alphabet.  Molly's father accidentally falls victim to the Unown and his remaining work is shipped home.  Molly finds the Unown blocks that her father unearthed and begins playing with them and accidentally activates their ancient powers.  The Unown, sensing Molly's sadness, make Molly's dreams come true - her home becomes a crystal palace and they create a father figure for her - the enigmatic Entei, a lion-like Pokemon.  As Molly's fantasy life becomes more real to her, the area that is affected by the conversion process started by the Unown grows.  Soon it begins to threaten to engulf populated areas.  Of course, Ash and company are nearby to help.  Meanwhile, Molly expresses her desire to have a mother.  Mysteriously, Entei responds by capturing Ash's mother and bringing her to the fantasy palace.  Ash, along with his friends and Team Rocket (again) must stop the Unown and Entei before Molly's dreams become all too real.
This story is a fine addition to the Pokemon franchise.  Its timeless story of what a little girl really wants if separated from her mother and father can foster discussions between parents and children.  Molly, of course, finally understands what is important and the world returns to normal.  This is possibly the most well done of the movies, although I liked the story and secondary plots of the first movie a little better.  The art is top notch Anime at close to greatness, and the story finale with Molly making the final decisions, is not understated nor overstated.
There's also a Pikachu cartoon that younger fans of the TV show will enjoy.
Almost as highly recommended as the first Pokemon film, this deserves a place in a lot of home libraries and some school and counselor's (child psychologist's) collections.",1052870400,,2758,4.89247311827957
1622492,3,B00005LKLF,"The first two movies were okay, but this one was the boringest movie of all..........I wish they would released a subbed version of Pokemon on VHS and DVD.",1041120000,,155,4.571428571428571
1622493,5,B00005LKLF,"If you are an anime fan, you should buy this movie. I'm sure that many of you may think Pokemon is a childish, naive type of anime that's only for kids under age 10... however, Pokemon has more themes than just friendships even though it is not as sophisticated as Spirited Away...
Let me begin with graphics. I love the graphics in this anime, they are extremely detailed and varied in colours. There are scenes where 3D technologies are combined with 2D animations, they are rendered well, despite the fact that 2D is flat and 3D is more dimensional. Facial expressions are well reflected through characters' moods.
Next the sound. For North American anime fans, they know very well that almost every single anime is edited in some way so that the lip movements of characters fit the English voice acting. Well, you'd expect the same in Pokemon... As some of the earlier reviews point out, the Japanese version is longer in length and has more stuff to it; however, there is not a significant difference between the Eng and the Jap one. Personally I think the American voice actors and actresses for Pokemon have done a good job! They actually put their feelings and emotions into the anime to make it fit the overall atmosphere. (if you have seen Totoro's English version, that's what I call ""bad voice acting""....) Some people hate the BGMs, because they are completely rewritten and recomposed. I love them, even they are miles away from the originals. The songs are cheerful and beautiful, ""to know the unknown"" for example.
Finally the story. Out of all 3 movies, this one is my favorite. The reason is because it teaches children and even adults lessons about love, loyalty, dreams, friendship, determination are intermixed in this film to make the story more complicated than most people expect. Every anime is childish in some way (except those blood lust ones), but every anime has its meanings and lessons about life incooperated inside... it's up to you to discover them.
Overall, Pokemon 3 is one of the best animes out there, it is not as childish as most people think, so get your hands on this great film before it becomes extinct in stores!!!",1041120000,4,2160,4.762666666666667

The only reason I knew it was there is because my sister likes to read the cast lists -_-' And for you people who wrote reviews that were against the movie, well, you shouldn't have watched it if you don't like Pokemon!!!!!!

1622501,5,B00005LKLF,"Well, the movie itself is awesome. The art is beautiful, the music in the Japanese version is great, and the plot is superb.
 The dub is the most faithful movie dub so far. However, there were some changes made. Kasumi's (Misty) great line, ""I am Kasumi Yawa - the prettiest girl in the world!"" was changed (so now we still don't know Misty's last name). Also, Mii's (Molly) mom was originally put in an insame asylum or something. She wasn't a missing researcher. And Mii originally said, ""Your hand is so soft,"" instead of ""I want things to be real again.""
So, while at least the dub isn't a total rewrite like the first two movies, it did have a bit changed.
Nevertheless, I still recommend this movie. But, do me a favor, okay? Get the Japanese version of the movies. You probably won't understand a word unless you get fansubs, but you won't regret it. :)",1008288000,,860,4.477707006369426

However, this movie can be shocking at first, but once you try it enough times, it shouldn't be that shocking.  Anyway, this movie contains the following:
""Pikachu and Pichu"", a mini movie that takes place in the big city where the Pichu bros. try their best to guide Pikachu back home before Ash Ketchum notices his Pokemon are missing.  It's very funny to see those Pokemon fight against 1 obstacle after another.  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!
""Spell of the Unown"", a major movie that takes place in the hilariously bizzare wasteland of Greenfield where everything turns to crystal.  Sounds creepy does it?  But not only that, you get to meet Entei, a legendary Fire-type Pokemon with the best Pokemon voice, unlike Mewtwo and Lugia which are just plain wimps.  That's because those other 2 Pokemon that first existed in Pokemon 1 and 2 tend to have bad voices, but this one has a good voice.
What I do like about this movie:
""Pikachu and Pichu"" has really huge laughs, unlike ""Pikachu's Vacation"" and ""Pikachu's Rescue Adventure"", plus it has more G/S Pokemon, which is superior.
""Spell of the Unown"" has really good animation, good laughs, and good voices, unlike ""Mewtwo Strikes Back"" and ""The Power of One"", plus it has 3 soundtracks that has you moving and grooving to the beat, along with 2 excellent looking Pokemon (Unown and Entei) and 3 forms of the final boss, Molly.
What I don't like about this movie:
""Pikachu and Pichu"" may tend to get annoying and loud at times during the film.
""Spell of the Unown"" is a movie that could be too creepy for little kids, plus it's way too loud!  Ahhh!
I'm sure this review will help all of you, but I'll see ya in the Special movie, Mewtwo Returns on December 4, 2001.  Good luck!  You'll need it!",1002585600,3,1921,4.60117302052786

1622506,4,B00005LKLF,"I was actually very pleased with this film.  Many fans were upset with the way the first movie was translated, including Pokmon errors, and also the fact that the second movie's script was rewritten with a short scene removed at the end of it.  But even with those two put together, they are completely outranked by this film...
Again, the script translation of this film was pretty much dead on.  I even read the producer's success of the third movie, which included going over the small plot holes that may have been in the Japanese version of this film.
The voice acting of this film is also a class of its own.  The movie really shines with the performances of Veronica Taylor (Ash/Ash's mother), Rachel Lillis (Misty/Jessie) and Eric Stuart (Brock/James).
The battle scenes may be a bit too intense for younger viewers, and even though it's Rated G, I really don't recommend some of the movie's contents for children under 8.  This is also a bonus for those who are fans of the Japanese series, to see that no actual footage from the original film was removed for the English dub release.
Overall, this Pokmon film, even though the trend is dying a slow and painful death, is the best out of the three released so far.  Why?  Complete and total translation.  Japanese to English, with slight grammar changes.  That's all 4Kids needs to do, and that's exactly what they did with this film.  Hopefully the fourth film will follow the exact same steps as this one.",1001894400,3,1466,4.647286821705427
1622507,5,B00005LKLF,"Entei's line ""You are MAMA!"" was probably the corniest line in the entire movie, but still, it doesn't detract from the fact that this was probably the best Pokemon movie yet. I admit, the first movie was kinda lame, but I enjoyed the second one (I'm a sucker for Luiga and Slowking) and I'm pleased to say that unlike most movie series, the Pokemon movies seem to get better with age. Now, I could go on, talking about how smooth the animation has gotten, how great the story is, that Pikachu and Pichu was the best of all the mini-movies or how Team Rocket had so little screen time, but everyone else has already raved about this movie. I want to go into detail about how well done this DVD is. Perhaps the best part is the Commentary by the writer and director of the movies. They talk about the troubles of translating and editing in the movie to appeal (and make sense) to a western audience, about how most people don't really give Pokemon movies any credit, and at some parts even MST the movie! Other bright spots include the original Japanese trailer for Pokemon 4 (which sadly confirms that WB will NOT be releasing the fourth movie in theaters), and the Pokerap GS, which I actually like for some sick reason. But there are still a couple of problems. For one, there's no widescreen version, which really stinks. In full screen, there are a couple of instances of characters speaking, but they've been cut off the screen. Another is the making of To Know the Unknown video. It just feels like filler material, and they could have at least included the actual music video.
Otherwise, it was a groovy movie. It would have been nice to include the original Japanese voices, or even have some early work from the movie development, but there's always the Pokemon 4 DVD...",1000339200,2,1779,4.5625
1622508,4,B00005LKLF,"I have never really considered any of the earlier Pokemon material to be what I think is true anime. Neither the characters nor the story were strong enough to elevate it above the level of Saturday morning cartoons. The second Pokemon movie showed a great improvement in the story with the underlying theme of man vs. nature, but no improvement was made on the development of the characters except for Delia, Ash's mom. This latest endevour has done a much better job of developing the characters of Ash, Delia, and the little girl Molly. The movie opens, Molly's mother had mysteriously vanished some years earlier and soon her father also disappears while researching the lengendary Pokemon called Unown. Now alone in the world Molly investigates a box of strange tablets sent to her by her father. These tablets turn out to be the Unown in some dormant state. The power of Molly's grief and sadness awaken them and begin to transform the world into an alternate reality composed of her dreams and wishes. I have been a rabid sci-fi nut for many years so this concept was quite easy to grasp - it was done very well in the original Star Trek pilot ""The Cage"". However I think this would be quite difficult for young children to comprehend, even though it is explained fairly well in the movie. Molly's lonliness, her fear of the outside world trying to harm her is brought out very well - she is very human, very easy to identify with. In many ways she is like the villain Yugi of the third Tenchi Muyo series, but without Yugi's malicious streak. One last thing I really enjoyed was Ash's quest to rescue his mom from Molly, here he shows a very strong bond to his mom. It was so good to see him so passionate about something besides Pokemon! This is what I think sets this film apart from all of the previous Pokemon material, the characters are human, you know their feelings, and they leave something behind in you when it's all over.

However I am pleased to say Warner has gotten this one right!  We have the free trading card, a COMMENTARY, DVD-Rom features, and the best part (Or one of the best things to come out of edited anime DVD's that is) THE JAPANESE TRAILER FOR POKEMON 4!!!!!!!

It just might be one of those straight-to-video films.... *sigh*  All in all, ""PK 3"" gets two paws up, and more if I could. Even those who aren't Pokemon fans won't be dissapointed.

1622514,5,B00005LKLF,"This movie is GREAT!! Lots of people say the minimovies are not that great, but this one was probably the best Mini Movie of all the Pokemon movies. YES!!! Finally, a movie with Furret (a long, ferret-like Pokemon evolved from Sentret) and the Baby Pokemon like Pichu and Magby. It is much better than Pikachu's Vacation and on the same level as the mini movie Pikachu's Rescue Adventure in Pokemon 2000.
The main film is about a young girl and the Unown Pokemon. Her father is an archaeologist trying to discover ancient Pokemon. He finds the Unown, only to mysteriously disappear. His co-workers bring the news back to his little girl, along with a bunch of tiles with the Unown on them. When Molly (the girl) begins to play with them, she somehow summons the Unown, who grant her wishes by bringing her Entei as a father and Ash's mom as a mother. For some reason they create a crystalline palace for Entei, Molly, and Ash's mom to live in, perhaps making sure that Entei and Ash's mom do not disappear like Molly's real parents did (at Molly's wishing). Ash sets out to find his mom.
Overall, a great movie to go with the Johto series. And to those who have seen the episode about Ash's fiery friend, Charizard, and the valley of the Charizards - Charizard returns!
Still, though, I don't understand why Entei is included and not Raikou and especially Suicune. When I found out that Entei would be in the film, and after I watched the first Johto episode, I began to mistakenly put the mysterious glowing blue Pokemon in the first Johto episode - Suicune - with Entei, as a kind of ""introduction"" to the movie. After all, it is natural to group legendary Pokemon - Mew and Celebi, Moltres, Zapdos, and Articuno, Lugia and Ho-oh -- and the three quick Neo Pokemon, Raikou, Entei, and Suicune. I was especially disappointed that water type Suicune was not in it, as Suicune is my favorite of the three (I like Water-types). It would have been interesting if Entei was her father and Suicune was her mother (Suicune has always had a rather feminine impression to me). But then, Ash's mother would have been fine and Ash probably would not have gotten involved at all. Oh well.
It's not as good as Pokemon 2000, and better than the first Pokemon movie, but somewhere in between. I don't know, but somehow I like the great Guardian of the Sea, Lugia, along with Moltres, Zapdos, and Articuno, better than Entei and the Unown. Lugia - the star Pokemon in Pokemon 2000 - gives me a rather peace-making, strong, good impression, where in most of Pokemon 3, the star Pokemon (Entei) is almost half good, half bad. Unown, on the other hand, are more carelessly playful in my opinion, instead of villainous, and their playfulness accidentally makes big trouble for other Pokemon and people.
However, it all comes right in the end, and it turns out that Entei is not bad, it's just that he was summoned by the Unown to be Molly's father, and he wants to protect her more than anything else. That means Entei seems bad to Ash, who wants Molly to realize that he is not her father, and is good in Molly's thinking, who loves him like a father - indeed, she actually thinks he is her father.
How does it turn out? I'll leave that for you to find out! It's a great movie (though it is lacking in some ways, in ways that Pokemon 2000 did great in) and if I were you, I'd watch it!",998352000,5,3367,4.503267973856209

 A scared little girl. An enchanted mansion. A mysterious Pokmon. On their way to the next gym, Ash, Misty, Brock and Pikachu stop at a beautiful town called Greenfield, only to learn about the disappearance of a friend of the Ketchum family and a colleague of Professor Oak. Molly, the daughter of the missing scientist, is left all alone in the town's mansion, frightened and alone, when the Annon appear. Using a psychic connection to Molly's brain, they slowly seal the castle off, turning it into crystal and isolating it from the whole town. They then bring her fantasy world to life, conjuring anything she wishes. Except for a family. With the help of the ledendary dog of fire, Entei, Mrs. Ketchum is brought to the mansion and separated from the rest. Now Ash must struggle to get his mother back, and fight Entei and the Annon in the process. With the help of an old fiery friend, our heroes set out on a seemingly impossible journey to rescue Ophelia Ketchum... knowing the likelihood of success is absolutely impossible.",996537600,2,1132,4.957894736842105

1622517,5,B00005LKLF,"I wasn't sure if this movie would be anywhere near as good as Revelaton Lugia, the second Japanese Pokmon movie. However, when I saw the original Japanese version in January, I knew that it was! Something previously unheard of in a Pokmon film was developed: a plot! In this movie, the characters all have clear, simple objectives and we know from the start what this film is going to be about. This doesn't mean that the movie doesn't have its moments of suspense. This structure simply allows the movie to progress more 'naturally', without some of the restrictive assumptions that were made in the first two films, such as having Pikachu in every other frame!
The Spell of the Unown tells the story of the legendary Pokmon Entei and the Unown, and how one little girl's unhappiness almost brought about disaster. The movie starts with the Molly's (the little girl) father disappearing. We also learn later that her mother has disappeared also. Feeling alone and sad, Molly discovers the box of Unown letters that had been found where her father was last seen. These letters (which are symbols of the Unown) summon forth a hoard of Unown, that seem to sense her unhappiness and try to make her wishes come true. Thus, the legendary Pokmon Entei is summoned, whom Molly believes to be her father. The Unown form a crystal tower around the mansion where Molly lives, which slowly begins to extend into the surrounding countryside. Also, Molly asks Entei to find her a mother. Once kidnapped, Ash begins his efforts to rescue her from Molly's 'crystal tower'.
I won't spoil the ending for you, but the message behind this movie is that of the bond between parents and their children. All of the Pokmon movies have themes (in Mewtwo Strikes Back we learned that senseless fighting was wrong - in the second movie the theme was that of believing in yourself), and this movie is the first to portray that message so clearly inside the film. One of the final scenes in the end credits is that of Molly being reunited with her real mother.
The 'Pichu and Pikachu' short was great! Perhaps not quite so good as the original 'Pikachu's Summer Vacation' but still great. For the first time, the original Japanese music was carried over from Japan and left in the US editon. I am all for this as the US music tends to be somewhat inappropriate for the shorts, always being far too kiddy.
As usual, the animation and CGI are up to their normal high standards, and the background music for the film was very good. Again, it was a shame that the movie score was made overly 'poppy', but this was balanced out by the retention of the original score for the short 'Pichu and Pikachu'. The music for the short was all carried over from the original Japanese production.
Overall, this movie is evidence that the US producers have listened to fans' requests to keep to the original storyline as much as possible. It's also nice to see that this film was completely Tracy free! This film is recommended to all ages, even those who may find the television series a little stodgy. Most parents won't have much say in it anyway...

Pokemon holds a degree of magic for those who take the time to understand what it is all about.  Is Pokemon the best anime, no. Is it the worst? No.  Pokemon is marketed towards children, yes, however, there are some very valuable lessons like friendship, loyalty, and caring that we all can take examples from.",994291200,7,491,4.373626373626373

I also love how Entei is a creature of her dreams in this film. The pictures in Molly's storybook are quite fantastic as well. This movie and Pokmon: The Rise of Darkrai are the only two Pokmon movies that I like these days. I used to also like Pokmon: 4Ever, Pokmon: Heroes, Pokmon: Jirachi Wish Maker, Pokmon: Lucario and the Mystery of Mew and Pokmon: The Mastermind of Mirage Pokmon. This Pokmon film is truly a classic for Pokmon fans everywhere (though I'm not much of a Pokmon fan these days). I remember also getting the Entei Pokmon card when I first went to see the movie.
