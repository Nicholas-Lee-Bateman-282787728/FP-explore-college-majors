2346746,5,B000A0GOMS,"All too often, Hollywood's depiction of the family includes things like incest, drug abuse and sexual transgression. I'm thinking of American Beauty and various films by Lisa Cholodenko. It seems that many movie-makers take quite a dim view of the value of the patriarchal structure, preferring the tender mercies of the so-called ""village"" instead.

Not this film. Based on the slimmest of ideas, Sternfeld's film depicts the remnants of a family emerging from loss. The father (LaPaglia) struggles to right his two suns even as he himself totters. Sternfeld's direction is effective and visually graceful, belying his brief resume. Slight green shoots appear in the landscape (the Janney and Livingston characters), helping the family regain its footing and human-ness.

For an example of the vitriolic reaction to this film from the left-wing press, read the ""review"" from the SF Chronicle, calling it ""counterfeit, antiseptic, uninformed, trite and unreal"".  You be the judge.",1306627200,,980,5.434210526315789

2346766,5,B000A0GOMS,"Apologies for the jokey title above; WINTER SOLSTICE deserves better. It is such a patient film, and its characters are so believably wrought, I'm still a bit shocked that it ever got made.

It's telling that the son of Anthony LePaglia's character has a hard time waking up in the morning, because this film seems to be perpetually in the moment between dream and reality... which of course, makes sense, given the title. The theme here is crossing over to a new state, which of course, exacts a toll and shakes up the status quo.

I'd like to salute writer/director Josh Sternfeld for so vividly bringing to life the relationships between his characters at his own pace, and not feeling the need to juice up the plot with Hollywood histrionics. This is a movie that won't insult your intelligence, but will make you appreciate fine acting and a little slice of unhurried realism. But if that doesn't sound like your cup-of-tea (decaffeinated, slowly steeped, and with a good measure of honey), you might want to think twice about this one.

2346767,4,B000A0GOMS,"WINTER SOLSTICE is a film that moves somewhat slowly but in a purposeful way that has impact. Anthony La Paglia plays Jim Winters, a widower who owns a landscaping business. He's trying to raise two sons, Gabe (Aaron  Stanford), a produce clerk at a supermarket who is wandering somewhat aimlessly through early adulthood, and Pete (Mark Webber), a high school slacker. The three move about, but barely say more than a sentence to each other. We get a sense of conflict and unresolved grief, but for most of the film we don't see it. We expect it to erupt when Gabe  decides to move to Florida, knowing nothing about the state except it's warm, or why he wants to move, yet very little happens. We do get a sense of the bond between the two brothers and Jim begins to open up a bit when he meets Molly Pipkin (Allison Janey), a woman who is house-sitting for some friends and the two begin a friendship.

For some people the film is too slow and bland, but it works. We see grief from a different point of view. Some could see it as male inability to express grief, but I think if anything it shows how long it can take to heal, if we ever do heal from life's hurts. We also see a film where the writers could have taken a sentimental route but choose consistency instead which for this story is the better choice. There are some ways the film could have been expanded a bit. Pete has a new teacher who seems to be able to at least begin to get through to him, but we never see what happens and we want more. There also could be at a bit more interaction between Jim and Molly, and perhaps Molly and the boys. Still the film does work and it is a good effort.",1157155200,2,1659,4.243670886075949
2346768,3,B000A0GOMS,"""Winter must be cold for those with no warm memories"", apols to Deborah Kerr, I just couldn't resist it.

This is the story of a man (LaPaglia) struggling to communicate with his two teenage sons following the death of their mother in a car accident.

Both sons seem to have lost direction and their concerned father is non plussed as he tries to guide his sons and overcome their resistance.

This a story of great emotion - hidden just under the surface.

None of them know how to deal with their grief and seem to flounder along day after day.

The arrival of Molly (Allison Janney) into the neighbourhood brings a friendship for Jim (LaPaglia) and a chance to (finally) move on emotionally.

She invites the family for dinner, and two of the most memorable scenes in the film occur - the indifference, rudeness of younger son Pete creates an awkwardness that's very realistic (as an adult watching I could have strangled him) and later on when Jim goes alone to Molly's as his son's simply don't show up.

We've all been there, but it was well played out by Janney and LaPaglia.

Finally comes the emotional wrench of elder son Gabe's decision to leave home. He has no job to go to, he's leaving his girlfriend behind and he tells his father he can't help how he feels, he just needs to get away, experience something different. His pending departure causes great anguish for his father Jim, and we are left in the final scene with father and younger son waving to the departing Gabe.

Whilst Winter Solstice can claim to be realistic, and well written in parts, and well acted, it lacks pep,zip.

I read a review of Winter Solstice where it was likened to Ordinary People.

I can only say that Director Robert Redford's film was a lot more character driven than this, which stalls quite a lot along the way. Winter Solstice moves so slowly that it's story could have been told in an hour.

It's a pity because it's subject matter was interesting, but the story lacked meat.",1154563200,2,1978,4.572237960339943
2346769,2,B000A0GOMS,"Whatever the point was of this movie, both my wife and I missed it.  This film reminded me of a Kung! (African) woman who wrote a book about traditional African life.  She would tell of some war their tribe fought; when it was over, they ""all just went back to living.""  Then, they would kill an elephant and have a big feast; then, they all just went ""back to living.""  Or, it might be the time for initiation of the boys or a girl's entry into womanhood and there would be all the celebrations associated with that; then, they all went back to ""just living.""

Well, this movie skips all the highlights; we are left with watching the father and boys ""just living"" their lives.  I guess this movie is for voyeurs who like to watch people just living their personal lives.  When the credits came on, I didn't know if I should be happy it was over or frustrated that I never caught what story they were trying (I presume) to get across.",1153353600,6,934,4.333333333333333

2346771,2,B000A0GOMS,"I watched this movie on ""Comcast On Demand"" recently.  The write-up likened it to ""Ordinary People,"" which is one of my favorite films.  Suffice it to say that this film is in no way similar.  The acting is fine, but there is absolutely no plot.  Characters are introduced, such as the troubled younger son's new history teacher, but then nothing is done with him. Everyone is grieving the mother, and we learn about 3/4 of the way through the film that she died in a car crash on a rainy night.  I was waiting for some kind of revelation, such as the older son was driving the other car that killed her, and maybe his lingering guilt was behind the difficulties between the father and his two sons, but the movie ends with no explanations at all.  When the older son decides to move to Florida, leaving behind his loving and beautiful girlfriend, there is no explanation.  When the dad and older son come to blows, it's hard to figure out what sparks the confrontation.  There is little motivation to explain any of the characters' actions.  Also, the title is puzzling since none of the film appears to take place in the winter!  Great film to watch if you've been having trouble sleeping.",1132531200,6,1191,4.549295774647887

The actors in this movie are all great.  That said, I really can't write much about the plot because it is so sparse.  If you read the other reviews you've got it all.  The movie is really, really slow-paced.  I loved the actors so I kept watching and watching and waiting for something---anything---to happen.  But it never did!  Throughout the whole movie.  Any info I give you would be a spoiler.

Even to say the father owns a landscaping company---I'm giving away a lot there---that's 20% of the movie, watching him drive to work, talk to his customers, and care for landscapes with almost no conversation.  Or outstanding visuals.  Or anything.

I have never seen a movie like this with statements of critical acclaim all over the DVD cover and then inside---literally no plot at all.  If someone appreciative of what this movie offers can write about what I'm missing, I'd appreciate it.

Basically a family and a family friend go about their lives in a small town.  And more happens to you in a day than these folks in this whole movie! You can watch the expressions on the excellent actors faces as they go about their lives.  And hear their small talk, nothing big.  The DVD cover says that the wife in the family died, and indeed she did, but it is only mentioned once, and no one ever talks about it at any other point.  Everyone five years later is still grieving, but not really openly or directly or explicitly---they just have very sad and empty lives.

  If that intrigues you, then you will love this movie.  I should say that I do enjoy deep psychological movies that are slow moving, but this is way beyond what I can tolerate.

2346773,4,B000A0GOMS,"Josh Sternfeld has done the unthinkable. He has elected to tell a story merely by allowing the viewer to overhear the minimal dialogue of the characters without supplying a linear plot or explanation of how a little family fell apart.

Landscaper Jim Winters (Anthony LaPaglia is a brilliant role) is the single father of two sons - Gabe (Aaron Stanford) who is the older and looking for ways to move away from his boring little small town home to find breathing space in Florida, and Pete (Mark Webber) a confused kid who wears a hearing aide and only sporadically seems to tune in to life and school.  The three men live a fairly orderly life since the death 5 years ago of the wife/mother in a car accident which Pete survived.  Jim tries to maintain some semblance of family but just cannot quite step out of his ill-defined grief to get a perspective on life. Obviously some forces of change are needed to heal this family of men.

Into the neighborhood moves Molly Ripkin (Allison Janney) who is house sitting for friends while she breaks away from being a paralegal to try her hand at making unique jewelry.  She connects with Jim, tries to connect with his sons, but at the least she introduces a figure of gentle concern and focused presence.  Pete finds some understanding from a summer school teacher (Ron Livingston) and begins to see some concept of meaning to his life.  Gabe's decision to leave for Florida's promise of better life means he also must say goodbye to his only rock of realism - his girlfriend Stacey (Michelle Monaghan). With all of these elements of change in the air the story just ends.  What will happen now is left to us to decide.

Yes, the film is slow moving, relying on minimal dialogue and more on silences and gazes.  But Sternfeld opens this little family drama in such a tender way that we find ourselves wholly committed to the plight of each character.  He makes us care.  And that is the true beauty of minimalist art in filmmaking.  The acting is first rate, with LaPaglia and Janney giving performances that deserve attention come awards time.  Highly recommended for those who appreciate quiet sensitive films.  Grady Harp, September 05",1127347200,6,2185,4.698162729658793
2346774,3,B000A0GOMS,"I love Lapaglia and Janney, and their good in this movie. The film is slow at some times, and feels a little like a made for tv movie. In the end the story is mediocre and the acting is good. It's watchable, but not great.",1126828800,2,222,3.9555555555555557
2346775,5,B000A0GOMS,"I thought this movie was engaging and interesting. Anthony LaPaglia gave a credible performance as a hardworking and grieve stricken father of two sons. The story simply depicts how these 3 men deal with life and with each other after their wife/mother died in an automobile accident 5 years back. The two sons are a handful in their own right, as the oldest is just out of school and working full time at a dead end job while trying to gather enough money to move to Florida and make his own way. The youngest son, who is still in high school and struggling, is some what of a rebel, but yet a good kid just fighting puberty. The Father is left to deal with each of his son's circumstances, while trying to overcome his own mourning, loneliness, and uncertainty.

From beginning to end the movie left me interested and entertained. It's not a fast paced movie with to much going on. It's a simple movie with a good story to tell. I will not say how it ends and what happens to these 3 men, however, I will say that I thought the movie ended well. To some interpretations, how it ends could leave you wanting to know more, which is completely understandable. However for me personally, I thought the movie ending was on the money. Sometimes instead of living happily ever after and/or finishing with tragedy, the story is better left undetermined. As life it self is undetermined.",1126656000,12,1380,4.542168674698795

8071484,4,B000A0GOMS,"""Winter Solstice"" is a drama film starring Anthony LaPaglia as single dad Jim Winters.

The sun reaching its lowest point like a winter solstice says a lot about the narrative of this movie, as Jim and his two sons from the earliest stages of the film are noticeably without the female presence of a wife/mother. They are all trying to go about their lives, yet the issue of a missing parent presents a grieving undertone which has an impact on the whole family and in different ways for each person.  The pace of the movie may seem slow, but this appears to be in keeping with the subdued state the family have found themselves in.

As the story progresses so to do the characters in terms of moving forward, and the film realistically presents unexpected loss and the path to maximum improvement.

8071486,2,B000A0GOMS,"Like someone else here, I thought this was based on the R. Pilcher novel, set in the U.K.
I should have read the info on this product more carefully. It's a slow moving, quiet story with some decent acting but little character development and even less tension or plot. The basic premise is a somewhat vague conflict between the widower-father and his sons, mainly the older one. Anthony Paglia is fine but unimpressive and we get to know very little about him as the movie progresses, other than he has bursts of anger with his sons and that's he the grieving widower (but it takes a long while to even find that much out). The lady-neighbor is cheerfully played and also just okay; she's not given much of a change to develop as person, either.

But the movie wasn't a complete waste of my time (I used a credit to purchase it for cheap). As a parent, I totally connected with the father's frustration and the sense of loss when the older son wants to leave home, the changes that occur in a family and relationships, esp after a tragedy happens.

But much is left hanging and not well framed; the older son's issue with his loving longtime GF seems strange since we them spend time together, very chipper and intimate - yet he wants to leave her since she is the ""problem"" but we never find out what that means. Lady-neighbor mentions needing a ""change of address"" but we never find out why she does.

At least, in the end, there is a sense that things will - or may - work out for this family, and that the sadness that pervades this film will eventually lift as the family members heal and move on. Sort of.

My question is why does this bear the same title as another movie, one based on a famous book? Did the producers not research titles? Confusing!",1354924800,,1758,4.416666666666667
