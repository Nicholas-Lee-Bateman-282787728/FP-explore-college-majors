4593420,5,B005727L9Y,"Yes, it isn't MST3K.  It isn't Cinematic Titanic either.  But they are all good, including this.  I love watching and hearing these guys in action.  Still funny and enjoyable.",1348790400,,175,4.931034482758621
4593421,5,B005727L9Y,"Need i say more, if you love MST3K like i do, these are for you. I always loved the shorts on MST, so here is another fine collection of shorts done by the later cast of MST3K.",1342828800,,176,3.7837837837837838
4593422,5,B005727L9Y,"This is a must-see DVD for any and all MST3K fans!  Really funny-the riffing is terrific, and the shorts are great!",1335744000,,115,4.476190476190476
4593423,5,B005727L9Y,"The Rifftrax crew is back and they have 8 more educational shorts to slam, thank goodness they're as witty as they are.

""Reading: Who Needs It?"", we see what happens when young teens neglect learning the ability read, in terribly cheesy and badly acted fashion. The short is so bad, so terrible but the guys make this material work on a few levels.

""Values: The Right Thing To Do"", a bunch of kids in the '70's play some basketball, pass by an old guy who collects things, then the boys try to steal something from his yard, the old guy gets trapped under a pile of wood and one of the boys stays behind to help him, then it ends. The jokes are good, though its not their best effort.

""Pearls of the Orient"", here we see some video of the Philippines and its people, which is presented in a silly and boring manner. The guys do great work with this one.

""Individual Differences"", what happens when a stupid kid is picked on by his teacher cause his older brother was smart? Well in this short he just seems to take it and not learn at all, at least until later when he is forced into a school play, but then he just panics, runs backstage and cries. The jokes are very funny and its never gets dull hearing the guys rip the short apart.

""Building Better Paragraphs"", another short with some young people in a classroom, where a couple of kids are asked to write a story about another students dog winning a contest. However the teacher needs to help the kids build a better story since they can't figure out what to write. Its a funny one, as the material is so bad that the guys have endless jokes for it.

""Mealtime Manners and Health"", poor eating habits can lead to being a social outcast and even alienate yourself from your family. Once you achieve good habits, you can enjoy dinner time with your family and act just like a robot. The guys always do well with these type of films as the cheesiness is so easy to rip on.

""Decisions, Decisions"", if the creepy, ear splitting opening song isn't bad enough we're treated to a friendship between some modestly cool kid and a nerdy kid who can't even pass a football correctly. Its probably one of the best ones on the disc as they just rip on the nerdy kid Tommy.

""Seven Little Ducks"", we see some ducks as a narrator talks about what makes ducks so unique, also we see some baby ducks being born. Its silly, boring but the guys make great use of the material as they always do.

Its another good collection of Rifftrax shorts, as they always do well when the shorts are as bad as these are.",1320105600,7,2550,4.340336134453781
4593424,4,B005727L9Y,"Eight completely forgotten shorts get the Rifftrax treatment in this highly entertaining collection, ""Old Tyme Shorts Roundup"". From the former MST3K crew of Mike Nelson, Kevin Murphy, and Bill Corbett, this DVD is full of sharp witted riffing sure to entertain both young and old alike.

We start with the hilarious ""Reading: Who Needs It?"" that shows three idiots who think they can get by without knowing how to read. And after learning the harsh, bitter lessons of life that puts them on the path to reading...they still can't get by.

""Values: The Right Thing To Do"" has a creepy, old guy defending his pile of junk from some bored kids, only to have his rotted wood pile fall on him. Although the short is less than nine minutes long, it's padded by what seems like an hour of wasting time.

In ""Pearl of the Orient"", the exotic, fascinating culture of the Philippines is reduced to a morbid, sweaty shell of its pre-war self, thanks in part to the ravages of World War 2...or was it the bridegroom dancing away like he was trying to put out his cigarette? Whatever the case, thank goodness for the advanced art of cockfighting to carry the culture along.

We find out about a shy, very hairy 6th grader named ""Roy"" in ""Individual Differences"". In which, we see the two methods teachers use to understand their students, namely shame or understanding. In this, the Rifftrax boys are in top form, especially Bill's booing of Roy's speech on his summer vacation nearly brought me to tears.

Two students and a young Al from ""Happy Days"" get to blow off class in a vain attempt in ""Building Better Paragraphs"" about some mutt and her dog (zing!) winning a prize for jumping...or something.
Creepy, 11 year old goombah Phil learns how ""Mealtime Manners & Health"" can save our planet from certain doom. A highlight happens during this short when an educational TV program about meals is shut off because Phil isn't enjoying his meal, which of course make no sense and Kevin is quick to pounce on it.

In ""Decisions Decisions"" poor Tommy has to decide between popularity and being friends with a male Rachel Maddow. This mess of a short features the smallest front wheel of any bicycle ever made, a fey southern father and an ending straight out of ""The Sopranos"", only more bewildering.

And finally we meet ""Seven Little Ducks"" and their cookie devouring child owner that becomes the target of zingers from Mike, Kevin, and Bill.

There are no extras on this DVD and even the menu theme music suffers from being the ""generic"" country-hick type stuff. Since it's pretty easy to download shorts individually from the Rifftrax website, I was rather surprised how frill-free this and the ""Shorts to Go"" companion DVD were. But all in all, this is a fine collection of shorts that's sure to please Rifftrax fans.",1312675200,19,2809,4.741803278688525

4593427,3,B005727L9Y,"I loved MST3K, and Mike was definitely my favorite host, so I have been loving RiffTrax and The Film Crew. But this compilation was not quite what I hoped, in that I won't be able to watch it with children present. My daughter has seen a bunch of MST3Ks, no problem, but I had to stop this DVD and finish it when she wasn't around, because it had a ton of swearing, and WORSE, it had some tasteless jokes about child molestation, use of slurs against the disabled (variants on the ""r"" word) making fun of kids'  appearances, and some borderline racism in the one about the Philippines. I know that once they're off prime time the guys want to let it all hang out, but I wish I could enjoy their jokes without my kid overhearing things that I would NEVER want her to repeat, especially to her uncle with autism or any of our asian relatives! I'm still giving them 3 stars because I know kids aren't the intended audience, but they should know those of us who were fans as teens are in our 30s now and have kids we'd rather not traumatize. I didn't expect to give my daughter a lecture against bullying chubby, ugly, different, or slow kids after watching this with DVD with her, but I felt I had to.",1403136000,,1198,4.300884955752212
4593428,5,B005727L9Y,This dvd is worth the first short alone. I have several of the shorts collections and this is the best. Hilarious!!,1400371200,,115,4.523809523809524
4593429,2,B005727L9Y,Mildly amusing collection of shorts given the Rifftrax once over. Some are better than others. A C-  effort. Needs Improvement!,1399075200,,127,5.35
4593430,5,B005727L9Y,"Mike and the guys do it again for Olde Tyme Shorts--I confess that the Rifftrax performances whether done as commentary on shorts or major motion pictures, are the only times I end up laughing hysterically!! Had a bad day at work or a fight with your better half? Just turn on Mike and the guys and you will inevitably smile",1395014400,,324,4.416666666666667
4593431,5,B005727L9Y,"8 shorts, the kind poor high school students, or high school teachers, were forced to watch.  Or were shown on PBS.  Or maybe were forced onto the Boy Scouts of America?
Reading: Who Needs IT? shows how you will never get a job or be happy if you can't read or write.  In fact, you're doomed.
Values: the Right Thing To Do suggests that helping somebody NOT die a long painful death is something you may wish to do.  You know, if you have the time.  Pearl of the Orient is NOT a short about that Chinese take-out place in New York.  Nor is it about Hong Kong, which is funny because Hong Kong's nickname IS Pearl of the Orient.  But a short about the Post-World War Two Philippines and how great it is.
Individual Differences seems to suggest that students are not all alike and therefore should be treated different.  The funny part about this short is the fact that is seems to be targeting teachers.  Who, I would think, would already KNOW this.
Building Better Paragraphs makes us go through the painful step by step process of making a story about a dog and a dog show and oh the pain.  Its like being in a real English class.  But somehow the short lasts longer and the students are no where near as smart as you remember them.  You will feel IQ points fleeing even as you watch.
Mealtime Manners and Health is, when compared to the others, relatively boring to be honest.  Just another food and health short.
Decisions, Decisions is about a semi-cool kid trying to decide if he should become friends with a boy nobody likes making himself even less cool than he already is.  Or dump the other kid, giving in to peer pressure, and join the mindless crowd of zombies that are his fellow classmates.
Seven Little Ducks is about...seven little ducks.  But the title is WRONG!  Because there is a mother duck.  Not really much to say there.",1381881600,,1842,4.434523809523809
4593432,5,B005727L9Y,"Wow this is really funny, it was my first Rifftrax DVD purchase and I will be getting more of them.  If you are a fan of MST3K like myself, then this is a no brainer.  I was surprised at how good and I don't even want to say it but this may be funnier than MST; certainly not vulgar or anything, but a little more risque.  I was seriously laughing out loud at some of the riffs.  Well worth the price.",1363996800,,401,3.9135802469135803
4593433,5,B005727L9Y,"LOVED this set. This is the funniest group of shorts so far. From one on the Philippines to Decision-making (which looks at how much you like the local creepy kid) to ducks, I couldn't finish drinking my cocoa for fear it would come out my nose.",1359331200,,245,4.3478260869565215
4593434,4,B005727L9Y,"The description of 'Seven Little Ducks' implies there will be some form of cruelty.  There isn't, thankfully, but it's still cruelly painful to watch, like a lot of the shorts the guys have done over the years.  I can certainly relate to open-ended 'Decisions, Decisions' because I was that dork who almost became great friends with a cool kid.  Now I lead a sad and lonely existence.  I still blame him!

Looking back on these types of so-called educational films, it's a wonder we haven't slipped into anarchy sooner.  They truly are pathetic and useless attempts to keep kids occupied while teacher slips out for a nip of gin in the private lounge.",1356998400,,651,4.716814159292035
