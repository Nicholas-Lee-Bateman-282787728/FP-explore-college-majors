1219085,5,B00000I4PD,I am so happy That I got a copy of this movie in Advance The artwork is really cool.............But the Movie is Great. Another great obscure Horror Movie by AnchorBay. I highly recommend this Movie..............,1159833600,11,212,5.085714285714285
1219086,5,B00000I4PD,"This is one of those movies that you saw as a kid, thought it was the most scary movie ever, then you watch it again 20 years thinking it'll be just a load of rubbish. Wrong. This movie wastes no time in delivering.

A family move into a house by a lake fraught with a violent history and the legend of a witch thrown in. So quick do the killings happen that even the removal men get bumped off. The story, perhaps not the most original premise, is held together by human characters and a classy production. Definetly one to watch with your girlfriend. And the witch is really mean. Check out the girl having a wooden stake hammered into her head. Brutal. If you're a horror fan you have to buy this. They just don't make 'em like this anymore. A nice clean transfer in 1:1.85. Pity it's in mono.",1159574400,32,796,4.271523178807947
1219087,4,B00000I4PD,lost gem of the 80's. A very good supernatural horror classic. a witch is drowned in 1784. She continues to haunt the pond and house. Great ending.,1048032000,7,147,4.481481481481482
1219088,5,B00000I4PD,"I could always remember this horror but for years could never remember the name of it so i went exploring on amazon to view films from previous years,i typed in horror movies from the eighties and went down the list from 1980 and so on, this name jumped out at me so i clicked on it and there it was SUPERSTITION i was ecstatic,couldn't believe my luck. I had forgotten some of the movie but loved every minute of it all over again,i would definately recomend this as a must see. THANKYOU for making a young at heart lady very happy .",1282867200,2,534,4.245098039215686
1219089,3,B00000I4PD,"A witch comes back for revenge in this tale which although is no masterpiece, it does have a few scenes to make you jump. Good to see Larry Pennell (alias Dash Riprock from The Beverly Hillbillies) too.",1280880000,3,202,4.486486486486487
1219090,3,B00000I4PD,I can see where this movie would scare a child. One by one someone dies & all you see is a clawed ugly hand or a shadow. Not a bad old movie. worth watching once.,1264291200,2,162,3.657142857142857
1219091,5,B00000I4PD,"I just saw this for the first time yesterday on TCM Underground.  I've been a horror fan since I was a child.  I thought that I'd seen almost every horror movie made.  Not so!  This is a wild fun film in spite of its' low budget.  The reason I never saw this on tv before is probably because it has some ""taboo"" elements.  A dead young boy hanging upside-down is a no-no, as is the mentally-impaired groundskeeper and some suggestions of necrophilia.

I'm not a big fan of those taboos or lots of gore, but in this film they make it work.  The handsome young priest is energetically relentless in his efforts to save the family, and the odd older woman who lives in the cottage is an excellent combination of creepy and campy!  Wait, did I forget to mention the preacher with problems, his voluptuous daughter, and a microwave oven with attitude issues?

Again, I can't believe this film was made 25 years ago and I never came across it.  There's a couple of familiar middle-aged guys that horror & B-movie fans will have seen before, but the rest of the cast are fresh faces, which helps the viewer get lost in the movie with not too many ""oh, there's what's-his-name"" moments.

I hope this film is a bit clearer visually on dvd, but the print I saw had no major flaws.  A good film to watch alone in the dark or with friends who have similar tastes - or lack of taste?",1264291200,7,1370,4.346456692913386

1219094,5,B00000I4PD,"Hello World,
  Well written decent acting and nice effects. Good amount of gore and atmosphere the story is decent and creepy as hell. Dont bring this one to Christmas dinner!",1228867200,3,175,4.8
1219095,5,B00000I4PD,"Easy to see this was done in the 80's...BUT there are very few of that era's cliche's evident.  Passable acting(with a more-positive exception of the great job Finlander boy Albert Salmi does, though it is a dollar-store Charles Bronson cop character impersonation!) and very, very quick pacing.  It hardly ever gets dull.  Excellent slaughter scenarios(though not quite up to the gruesome par of the Italians) are quite satisfying and novel, and the story is rather a nice take on a witch's curse legend. And yes, the witch really DOES look cool, and the film-makers are wise to keep her mostly obscure....except for her wicked talons which keep showing up to cause trouble for the hapless victims.  ONE fault with the film is the nigh-unbearable practice of having characters running about calling for missing characters by name...again and again....and again...and, well, YOU get the picture.  But many films are guilty of this!  An excellent find; true Horror fans, of any era, can't go wrong.  Nothing insulting or condescending about this; it seems these film-makers really WANTED to make a Horror movie, and not just some money-making dreck!",1175385600,3,1148,5.139784946236559
1219096,5,B00000I4PD,"I saw this as a rental years ago, and it has haunted me ever since. Packed with gore and a forboding atmosphere, this movie was one 80's slasher pic that was cool and scary at the same time. This witch is mostly out of sight most of the movie, but for her blackened, claw like hand that suddenly appears throughout to do it's violent deeds. The girl getting impaled though her head was the scariest part.  Her body flopped as the spike went in while her family screamed on the floor beneath her. Now THAT was scary!",1163808000,10,515,4.309278350515464
1219097,1,B00000I4PD,I was stupid and bought this movie. Its hokey. Rent it and see if you want it for your collection. Its so bad I ended up giggling through it as my husband fell asleep!

The location and atmosphere is excellent. Not to mention the 2 daughters. The film rules on the ""less is better"" theory. No boring parts and no happy endings.

7909582,5,B00000I4PD,"This movie had me sitting on the edge of my sleep. It was horror, superstition and demon witchcraft rolled up in one. this was a great movie. Violent and no happy endings. The way a horror movie should be. Scary!!!",1378512000,,214,4.375
7909583,4,B00000I4PD,"After a very lackluster yet enjoyable viewing of Shrieker, we felt compelled to further the daily B entry by adding one on later that night. With so many options available we came across an 80's wildcard known as Superstition. This is one we'd never heard of and seemed a bit different then the typical 80's slashers. Therefore we said ""alright, alright...be careful"" and gave it a whirl. The result was an actual really good horror movie that maintained a very creepy feel throughout. Despite it actually being good, there was an overwhelming B element with plenty of hilarious moments. This way you're getting the best of both worlds. It's essentially the perfect style of B that truly intrigues you yet makes you crack up at certain times. There's also something special knowing it was originally released on VHS. It brings you back to a time where perusing the video store shelves was the only way for one to obtain B. A time when Death Ring could have been requested by the store clerk for the honest sum of $90. It still would have been worth it for that price. Anyway, on to the feature film of the evening!

Superstition starts off hot and heavy with a high school couple having a make-out session by a creepy old house. A couple of tricksters play some pranks and scare them off from the old abandoned house. Unfortunately for them an entity takes them both out. One gets his head lopped off and blown up in a microwave while the other gets chopped in half trying to escape out of a window. Yeah it was pretty intense. Now we flash forward to a family who has recently moved into the condemned property, not knowing the houses assorted past. Turns out the backyard pond was the site of a witch execution back in 1692. One where the witch vowed revenge on anybody and everybody in the nearby area. So it's safe to assume moving into her old house wasn't the best choice. This witch entity is no joke and gruesomely takes out anybody she can. Their only hope is their priest friend who takes on the force with his crucifix only to come up empty in the end. Despite the lack of success with the witch, the crucifix did manage to make a door explode which was incredibly awesome and hilarious. Maybe if it had been a crucifix pinky ring the priest would have been more successful. We know first hand the power that ring holds. It holds the force of 10 plates of galamad, with a side of madana finished with a demitasse. Now that's a force to be reckoned with.

When it was all said and done, Superstition was an 80's gem that takes on a different approach to the typical slasher of the decade. It legitimately had some creepy moments that were unfortunately overshadowed by a music score that didn't fit the movie. The music was nowhere near scary and managed to make certain scenes more comical. It was a very odd choice. The time someone pranked the big guy by playing Yani through the phone would have been more effective. One caveat was that you never get to see the witch entity except for a big creepy shadow hand, or a figure in a large robe. We would have enjoyed a real creepy looking witch face in the mix, but it's not a deal breaker. This is one that would have been perfect for Monstervision back in the 90's on a Saturday Night. If you're in the market for a really enjoyable 80's horror then we'd gladly suggest Superstition.",1369785600,,3345,4.490968801313629
7909584,3,B00000I4PD,"Neither gem nor skipper, this is a typical 80s slasher movie.  The kills are pretty random, the story is comically uninspired, and the actual murderous acts and the killer are never seen.

TAGLINE:  ""A witch put to death in 1692 swears vengeance on her persecutors and returns to the present day to punish their descendants."" [--IMDB]

This flick wastes none of your time.  Before we're 20 minutes into the running time a couple of pranksters intruding in the wrong abandoned house meet horror-humorous fates: a decapitated head exploding in a microwave and a killer window cuts a guy in half.
Reverend David Thompson is approached by the police about this property, which has a bloody history.  We learn from the weird caretaker lady that the killer is a ""she.""  But some crazy lady's words aren't sufficient evidence to keep the reverend from renting the house out to the family of a colleague of the cloth.

The kills are pretty random, almost comically uninspired, and the actual murderous act and the killer are never seen (just a black clawed hand), making this flick feels like most 80s slasher movies.  Additional kills include a drowning, a rogue buzz saw blade to the chest, a hanging, crushing by giant vice, glass shrapnel to the face, hammering a stake through a forehead (my favorite in the movie!), and other random draggings by claw off camera.

The weird old caretaker lady is standoffish and uninformative as to what's going on until Rev. David removes a crucifix from the pond out back.  Evidently, removing the crucifix from the pond somehow empowers the killer and now he must perform some ritual.  Why?  Well, evidently the killer was a witch that was ""drowned at the stake"" (not a joke) back in 1692.  It seems that she's exacting her revenge on the descendants of her executioners and she waited about 300 years to do it.  I guess it's a good thing for that evil witch spirit that they didn't just decide to move to Florida.  Otherwise, she might have been waiting in that pond forever!

More people die, the story never really goes anywhere, and the last scene was the most painful of the entire movie.  Despite this being advertised as something of a witch movie, it would be best to ignore that altogether and simply consider this another bad slasher flick with a supernatural component.  There is really no reason this should be called ""Superstition"" either.

This flick should neither be skipped nor treated as a hidden gem.  Chance it if you're a horrid slasher fan who loves random flicks, don't if you're not.",1360022400,,2541,4.782110091743119
7909585,4,B00000I4PD,"An evil witch comes back to get revenge on the descendants of those who killed her.

Some stupid family moves into this house and sure enough they get offed one by one in pretty graphic gory ways for the most part. One shocking part involved a child but then again this witch is evil and doesnt care so it really shouldnt be that shocking lol

I found the movie genuinely unsettling there was unfortunately some horrible acting for the most part but the priest and the guy trying to save and warn this family did a great job at least.

The ending was creepy as hell especially that evil laughter and what happens to the last remaining survivor. Wont spoil whether they live or not watch the movie and find out for yourself.",1342137600,,723,4.421052631578948
7909586,1,B00000I4PD,"I remember going to see this movie with a group of 8 friends growing up, there were several other people in the theatre for about a grand total of 30 people.  At the end of the movie I looked around and noticed I was the only one left in the theatre.  This movie was terrible, I only stayed till the end hoping it would get better.  The sound was off and this is terribly annoying when people's mouths aren't moving to the right words.  The movie was predictable which I could have gotten past if the acting wasn't so bad.",1340582400,,522,4.19
7909587,5,B00000I4PD,"I first discovered this film when I worked in a video store back in the eighties. I'd never heard of it, but was absolutely delighted to find that it actually gave you what you expected. It runs at the pace of approximately one death every five minutes, right from get-go, and it even had some genuinely creepy scenes too! I'm so glad that this movie is finally available on DVD! Admittedly, I haven't been checking around for it every day, which is why it took me almost five years from its release. At least I finally found it! One of the best horror films from the 80s.",1315872000,,572,4.355140186915888
