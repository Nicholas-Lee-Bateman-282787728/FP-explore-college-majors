8600295,5,B001MSWWU0,"As the title implies, this is a film about the soul of mountaineering.  The scenes may not be as spectacular as the Everest IMAX film, and it doesn't dwell on technical climbing or logistical details.  However, more than any other mountaineering film I've seen, this one tells a poetic story of what mountaineering means and why people climb.  It never occurred to be before watching it, but Spanish is such a poetic language that it adds a lot to the story.  If you enjoy mountains and mountaineering, you will not be disappointed by this film.",1327536000,,545,4.705263157894737
