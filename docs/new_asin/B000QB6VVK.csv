Perhaps i should say i would catch it periodically to see if it could finally catch my interest. It never did. The female lead was never believable, the script (from what i saw) was banal at best. Some of the other actors gave it some help but not enough to get me to watch. I gave it a 2 for effort.",1424304000,,421,3.9647058823529413
8325636,3,B000QB6VVK,"video quality was surprisingly excellent, but the subtitles were almost incomprehensible. the vendor warned me, but i thought, ""how bad can it be?"" ... it's pretty bad. this series is hard to find, so i took a gamble, but honestly couldn't finish the series. if you don't need subs, the low price and high video quality make this is a great find. otherwise, you might wanna keep searching for a DVD box of this hilarious and truly heartwarming classic love story. it's one of my all-time favorites.

i do want to note that i have ordered several other box sets from Kona and More that were excellent. their price is consistently $20 - $30 cheaper than competitors and video quality is (again) excellent. they are an honest and hard-working company.",1372291200,,748,4.753846153846154
