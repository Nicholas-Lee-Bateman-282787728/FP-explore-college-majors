4119774,4,B003FUZMWS,"The stories are quite good, if a little drawn out, but even having  lived in the United Kingdon for 3 years and becoming used to their speech, I found some of the mumbled comments on the audio such that I had to back up the DVD and replay segments to umderstamd what was going on.
Good picture, acting, and stories.",1323302400,9,315,4.25
4119775,5,B003FUZMWS,"I think that Robson Green is one of the best actors going, he seems to get into the minds of the very evil.  This is a credit to Robson Green for his acting ability and I like his fishing shows too.",1312675200,6,198,3.8292682926829267
4119776,5,B003FUZMWS,"If you're a fan of Robson Green, you will like this collection. The dynamics of the characters  come together well and the stories are just as disturbing as 'Wire In The Blood'.",1293408000,4,177,4.53125
4119777,4,B003FUZMWS,"The first episode takes awhile to get down to it as most english films, as the series continues it gets better. I'd buy it again.",1288224000,8,129,4.2
4119778,5,B003FUZMWS,Really good police procedural. The cinematography is well done and the characters are sombre and sympathetic. The plots are unique. I love this series and re-watch it periodically which is unusual for me.,1284595200,13,204,5.212121212121212
4119779,4,B003FUZMWS,"Touching Evil seems to be the infant of the subsequent series, Wire in the Blood.  I found this series a little too on the emotionally dramatic side, (personal drama of the main characters, all seem like they require psycological help) I wonder how they would make any psych screening for the job of solving serial murder cases.
If you can get past the dramatic, unrelated to the stories themselves, the stories are interesting, and never is any event predictable.  Its not lighthearted entertainment, and the stories are interesting, but I gave it a 4 and not a 5 because the overly dramatic personality quirks of the  main characters really detracts from the stories overall.",1280793600,16,677,4.921052631578948
4119780,5,B003FUZMWS,"'TOUCHING EVIL' is a complex series of serial crimes, 8 episodes, each about 100 minutes of compelling, seriously evil crime. From the opening scenes, it grabs and you can't let go. Even after the end credits roll. IT IS NOT for everyone, especially NOT for children. The box warning includes 'violence, nudity, and disturbing images.' Understatements! You may find yourself gasping, looking away, wincing, or worse.
If you are still reading this review, also know you will likely NOT be able to turn off the DVD. You get drawn into the crime serial offender's mind and motivation, wanting to find the reason as much as the special police force doing the investigating. Not exactly entertaining, not always pleasant, not light, not always horror; BUT emotional, graphic, gripping, hypnotic, disgusting crime, in a well-done mystery format.

The primary cast, beginning with DI Creegan (Robson Green) and DI Taylor (Nicola Walker) make the show seem real, too real, and a world you'll never want to touch. Commander Enwright (Michael Feast) & DC Rivers (Shaun Dingwall), also well played roles, are joined by guest stars. These 4 make a detective team of OSC (Organized & Serial Crime) unit. They're called in when the crimes become exceptionally ghastly, appalling, and an obvious serial crime with the perpetrator at large. The evil-doer must be caught to end the reign of travesty. The stories are extremely well written with multiple plots and even carry over into a later episode, or at least the effects of the investigation on the cops and victims.

So why can such debauchery be worthy of a 5-star review? No matter how weird, how creepy, how sinister the crimes get, you simply can't turn it off, and you are driven to watch the entire 8 episodes of this 3-series complete collection. Take this review as a warning or a recommendation. It all depends on how much your stomach, heart, and emotion can take. All that will be tested.

We had a choice between CC and SDH SUBTITLES. Original British airing was in 1997-99, then PBS. An Americanization of the series appeared in 2004, but why settle for redo when this original, complete footage is now available? For a series with this much tumultuous victimization, I only report for your own awareness and discernment--not to entice. 'TOUCHING EVIL' is shocking serial crime presented boldly with a great cast & writers.

Some details to help you decide if you can take it:
1 Triple child abductions appear to be a suspect's repeat serial crime. Is it a criminal game by the suspect? Will facts from the old serial deaths save CURRENTLY missing youth? An informant sees facts in the clouds. Creegan sees things in his head. Not who--but when will the crime go from abduction to murder?

2 Three suspicious hospital deaths were patients under Dr. Walker who favors euthanasia. The investigation causes Creegan to recall his out-of-body death experience and resuscitation. The perpetrator must have had the same experience.

3 A series of horse killings spread over the world having a connection, and leading to England. Who is behind it and why? Will it continue? How is a web game, 'Amathus', involved?

4 A reporter, Laney, gets an email message within 48 hrs of a murder. OSC tracks the suspect who retains photos & scalps of victims as trophies. The culprit is jailed but deaths continue. Who will stop it? Frontal male nudity.

5 Bosnia War experiences cause an ex-soldier horror memories. An executed body dumped at its own doorstep begins the search for the serial killer leaving a trail of washed victims with punctured brains. Blood!

6 Robbery is the crime but he loot being taken is children. Britain has an obvious gathering of international child abductors and it's up to OSC to discover why. It's very clear when kids begin disappearing. One capture just confuses the case.

7 A convicted wife killer is released after a successful appeal & reversal of confession. Creegan beats the team to the northern town of the murder only to have a 3rd local murder of a woman. Only one common link--the heart removed & left beside the body in a trash bag. What was the killer's link? Then death 4. Very disturbing, bloody bodies shown.

8 Arson puts this investigation in the lap of OSC because it was humans being burned. ""Fire as a weapon of death is rare."" OSC questions a prisoner who killed with fire for info to lead them to this current serial killer. Of course the burned body count grows. Graphic victim scenes.

If you purchase, remember I warned you.
If you politely pass, thanks for remembering I warned you.
Yet, amazingly, I MUST rate this CRIME/MYSTERY/SERIES 5 stars.",1274227200,58,4641,4.875634517766497

4119836,5,B003FUZMWS,"After getting hooked on Val McDermid's Tony Hill/Carol Jordan series, I purchased the TV series based on her books, ""Wire in the Blood.""  From that point on, I was a rabid fan of Robson Green, and started looking for anything he had been in.  ""Touching Evil"" was difficult to find through most DVD rental sources in the US, so ordered this set from Amazon.  Loved it!  Wish there were more!",1477526400,3,390,4.5285714285714285

4119838,5,B003FUZMWS,One of the 1ST and greatest British mysteries series. Great to see Robson back on Grantchester. But he is gorgeous and talented even as young actor.,1466467200,,148,4.730769230769231

4119871,5,B003FUZMWS,Great series from BBC/PBS - some viewers might find this series intense but the stories are complex and excellently acted. Wish Robson Green would get a similar series in USA but it would have to be cable to encompass these story lines. Received order 1 day early - great purchase and I plan to watch it again and again.,1452556800,,320,4.440677966101695

4119873,3,B003FUZMWS,"Aired in 1997.  DVDs were likely burned from a VCR tape master.  Hence, poor quality picture and audio, no subtitles & poor menus.
Otherwise, as a Robson Green fan, I liked the show.",1445126400,,182,4.484848484848484

4119876,4,B003FUZMWS,"This is a very good crime drama.  It was the first time I saw Robson Green act in any role and I was struck by how intense he was in a very subtle kind of way.  It doesn't hurt that he has the most intense, beautiful blue eyes I have ever seen either!  I wish there had been more seasons of this show because it had just hit its stride when they canceled it.  It was a really good drama just as good as 'Wire in the Blood which had many more seasons.  So if you like Robson Green, gritty crime dramas, or 'Wire in the Blood' you will like this, too.",1437523200,8,549,3.8660714285714284

4119878,4,B003FUZMWS,This is a really interesting series.  The best one is the first one.  It's truly frightening and holds your interest.  It could have been agreat series if the following ones were as good as the first.,1431648000,,200,4.5
4119879,5,B003FUZMWS,Saw this series many years ago...fell in love with Robson Green and the cast...so happy to have it on DVD!!,1430438400,,107,4.4
4119880,5,B003FUZMWS,"I loved this series when it was on PBS years ago. since it is not currently available on Netflix or Amazon Prime Video, I purchased the DVDs. Robson Green's character is intense. I love him as an actor and was glad to see him on PBS again in the recent ""Grantchester"" series. This entire series revolves around Green's character and all kinds of murders and violence, some of it very hard to watch but compelling, nonetheless..",1427328000,,427,4.631578947368421
4119891,5,B003FUZMWS,"Definitely one of t best British police dramas;  ITV did a super job on these three series, 1997-99.  Robson Green (Wire in the Blood; Soldier, Soldier);  Nicola Walker (Spooks/MI-5); and Shaun Dingwall (Above Suspicion) star.  Top notch guests include  James Nesbitt (Murphy's Law);  Philip Jackson (Poirot); Andy Serkis (Lord of the Rings); Jill Halfpenny (Eastenders, Corrie); and Ian McDiarmid  (Star Wars).

I like the longer length - about 100 minutes in each of the eight episodes.  And appreciate the 'play all' feature instead of having to play each separately.
I enjoyed this when I watched it in the UK and again on these dvds;  it will definitely be top of my list for repeated viewings.",1424217600,4,699,5.0

4119896,4,B003FUZMWS,"After seeing this mini-series in TV, I knew I had to have a copy for myself.

4119899,5,B003FUZMWS,"I like Robsen Green.  At first I didn't think that he fit the part very well.  Something just wasn't right.  I felt like I was watching ""Wire In The Blood"", but they had changed the main character.  It didn't take long for me to get accustomed to  Dave Creegan , however,  and it turned out to be a good series, just not long enough.",1367107200,2,333,4.125
4119900,5,B003FUZMWS,"I first caught an episode of this series on PBS Mystery years ago. I found it on dvd as a collection and had to have it. The show is engrossing and the actors do an excellent job of pulling you in and wanting more.
Robeson Green is excellent and very believable as the lead. The whole show is exciting, intriguing and a satisfying set of stories that will hold up to repeat viewings. Great series",1337472000,2,396,4.293333333333333

8396214,5,B003FUZMWS,"Excellent, late 90's British crime drama. This one, and Prime Suspect, set the stage for the many shows that followed. Crime isn't pretty, and this show definitely is not American television.",1521763200,,191,5.193548387096774
