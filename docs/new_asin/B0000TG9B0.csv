1943105,5,B0000TG9B0,"As a 19 month old toddler who loves all things Spot, I was very happy to hear that Spot was finally coming to DVD.  They have combined two VHS tapes into one DVD making it a great investment.  The episodes are the same but it is nice to have the quality restored and not to have to wait for the VCR to rewind between episodes.  I'm hoping Disney will release more Spot adventures to DVD soon, especially the Spot Visits His Grandparents episodes.",1075852800,10,446,4.349397590361446

Seriously, this is great for toddlers. Probably not for older preschoolers.",1420416000,,337,4.616666666666666

8002545,5,B0000TG9B0,"This is actually my second time purchasing this video. I had the VHS tape, but it was quickly worn out by my nieces and nephews when they visited. Now that I have a 20-month-old of my own, I'm happy to have Spot on dvd. Seriously, out of the 8 children that I know that has seen this video, they have ALL sat transfixed to the screen. It's amazing because the video is very ""simplistic"" in nature, but maybe that's why it's so great for toddlers. The music is nice and soothing, the stories are easy to follow and the kids all have loved that it's about a puppy. I would recommend this to any new parent! (It's actually rather relaxing for adults, too!)",1189468800,,653,4.317073170731708

8002547,3,B0000TG9B0,There is nothing wrong with this DVD.  Only we have VHS Spot's that are much better than this and look forward to some of the older Spot's to be released on DVD.  At least you get 2 shows.,1125964800,3,188,3.9210526315789473
