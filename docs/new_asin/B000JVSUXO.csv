2679545,3,B000JVSUXO,"""The Promise (Wu Ji)"" tries too hard to sweep us off our feet with material that defies taking flight, though almost all of the characters  do that very thing.  Kaige Chen, director of such stunning films as ""Temptress Moon"" and ""Farewell My Concubine"" tries his level best to make this film work and there is not doubt that the visuals are stunning and that the actors, particularly Dong-Kun Jang as Kunlun ( a man from the ""Snow Land"" who runs like the devil) and Cecelia Cheung as  Princess Qingcheng manage to give memorable performances.
Unfortunately, the over-riding sense here is that we've been here, seen that...and seen it much better in ""House of Flying Daggers"" and ""Hero.""  ""The Promise"" is beautiful to look at and a few scenes are genuinely emotional but unfortunately it is also empty, devoid of any kind of magic at its core.",1147305600,9,843,4.7534246575342465
2679546,3,B000JVSUXO,"[The following review refers to the 124 minute version released in Feb 2006, in Japan.]

`Wu Ji' (meaning `No Limitation') is an epic-scale romance directed by renowned Chen Kaige (`Farewell My Concubine' 'Together'). Like the fantasy tales of `Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon' `Hero' and `House of the Flying Daggers,' you can say the film belongs to the film genre usually called `wusha,' but what is impressive about 'Wu Ji' (or `The Promise' with international title) is its cast and crew gathered for the production. But about that, later.

[STORY: LITTLE GIRL] The film opens with a memorable shot, in which an orphaned girl wanders among the dead bodies of warriors in the battlefield. The starving girl meets a beautiful but haughty deity Manshen, the Sorceress (Chen Hong, also co-producer and Chen Kaige's wife), who promises the little girl Quingcheng everything - easy life, status, etc. - on one condition. That is, Quingcheng can never get true love from anyone. And the goddess says: `Once you have accepted your destiny, nothing can alter it unless rivers flow uphill, time runs backwards, and the dead come back to life.' She accepts it, not knowing what the pact really means.

[GENERAL AND SLAVE] Years later, the film introduces us to another battlefied, a ravine where Guanming, The Mighty General (Hiroyuki Sanada `The Last Samurai') is waiting for the next battle. The army of the General is outnumbered by the enemy soldiers, but the General, overconfident and very arrogant, is saved by the miraculous work by one slave Kunlun (Jang Dong-Gun, 'The Brotherhood of War'). Greatly impressed by the superhuman power of Kunlun (who can ""run"" with lightning speed even on four limb), the General takes Kunlun under his wing, and continues his battles.

The plot thickens when grown-up Quingcheng, now the Princess (Cecilia Cheung), is kidnapped by Kunlun who disguises himself wearing the armor of the General. While Kunlun is enchanted by the beauty of the Princess/Quingcheng, she is also in love with this brave man in gorgeous armor, thinking that he is the General, not the slave.

[TWO MEMORABLE SUPPORTS] The three principal players Hiroyuki Sanada, Jang Dong-Gun and Cecilia Cheung are all good, but probably Nicholas Tse as ruthless Wuhuan and Liu Yeh as assassin Snow Wolf will linger in your memory much longer  with their long fight sequence (with clever use flying fans). Nicholas Tse succeeds in making the role of the `villain' surprisingly three-dimensional, and Liu Yeh gives a credible portrait as a killer, or a doomed man who must accept the fact he cannot escape from the inevitable fate.

As is seen in `House of the Flying Daggers' the story of `Wu Ji' is generally melodramatic, but that didn't bother me. What is regrettable is that for all the good acting from these actors, the director fails to explore the romantic side of the story. The film's pace is often too slow, sometimes digressing into a sub-plot, and the film's tone is sometimes ineptly chosen. (With not-so-great CGI, some part of the film looks unintentionally comical).

[WELL, THE SPECIAL EFFECTS ARE ... er ... UNIQUE] What should I say? I am trying not to use the standard of Hollywood (which is not perfect, you know), but even so, the effects of `Wu Ji' look awfully misguided, or at least far from sophisticated. `Bad' is not the right word, for several effects are actually beautifully done. Still, in this epic fantasy, handsome and talented Jang Dong-Gun must run madly on four limbs, among the stampede of the wild bulls ... and he wins the race! Cecilia Cheung's Princess is literally kept in a cage (and herself in a while bird-like costume), and she actually `flies.' There is nothing subtle about Chen Kaige's use of CGI, and some of them may make the audiences giggle at the most serious moment.

The fantastic photography is by Peter Pau (`Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon') and the beautiful costume by Kimiya Masago and Tin Yip. Well, I don't know why Chen Kaige insisted on the use of these special effects when he can liberally use their excellent works. The music is by Klaus Badelt (`Time Machine' and others).

It is reported that `Wu Ji' is the most expensive film ever made in China, and looking at the picture, you can easily see where all these money went. It is regrettable that more refined storytelling and more restrained CGI images would be much effective and desirable in this epic romance film.",1146700800,10,4437,4.935656836461126

2679559,5,B000JVSUXO,"Visually this movie was awesome, story wise its pretty compelling as well. A lot of my friends are thrown off by what they call the 'anime'-ish action, at the start of the movie, but they managed to get passed it and really loved it themselves.",1379116800,,244,4.444444444444445
2679560,3,B000JVSUXO,"This movie was hilarious and should be listed in comedies. I am an avid martial arts/fantasy fan and this was horrible, but very entertaining. I laughed so much at the poor special effects, the bad acting and on top of that the dubbing makes it even more ridiculous. The general sounds like Sean Connery!! LMAO!! I would recommend this to anyone that wants to be entertained with laughter after all it is the best medicine. Truly the comic value is worth 10x the cost of the rental. Watch it and have fun!",1376524800,,505,4.5
2679561,5,B000JVSUXO,"I'm a big fan of Asian cinema and this film is one of the best from that part of the world! Visually stunning, charming story, well-developed characters beautifully acted (especially Nicholas Tse as Duke Wuhaun), just the right amount of action and romance - it's as close to perfect as a movie can be! The US release of this film has several scenes deleted from the Asian release, but those scenes are included as extras on the DVD. I agree with other reviewers that those scenes should've been left in the international versions of the film, but that's always the case with Asian films when they're released internationally: they get cut to ribbons trying to reduce the run-time. Just once I'd like to see an Asian film just the way it was shown in Asia! Fortunately, The Promise doesn't suffer hugely from the editing so it's still an excellent film. I think The Promise is a must-have for any serious collector of Asian cinema.",1368835200,,931,4.682926829268292

2679563,5,B000JVSUXO,"The setting is breathtaking, the wardrobe is beautiful and the cinematography is outstanding.  Chinese fantasy, with a full body storyline and a twist.  I watched it with a teen and a senior citizen, everyone agreed, this is a GOOD MOVIE!",1333929600,,238,4.925
2679564,3,B000JVSUXO,"This movie is really a fable: a mythical story about good vs. evil set in mystical places with characters having fantastical abilities.  It is also a story about making decisions, the longterm effects those decisions have on our lives and others, and how we come to realize the connections between past decisions and their effect on our life, e.g. young Qingcheng's choice with the goddess, Snow Wolf's decision to where the black robe.

The actor who played Kunlun (Dong-gun Jang) had wonderful facial expressions - keeping his innocence and clarity of soul while learning to cope with the darker side of life.  Nicholas Tse was a menacing Wuhuan - the evil protagonist.

Beautiful costumes but WAY too much flying and CGI effects...Cinematographer who did Crouching Tiger got carried away.  At one point I wished the actors would stay on terra firma for just one whole scene.",1332633600,,877,4.97945205479452
2679565,5,B000JVSUXO,I gave this movie a 5 star rating because of the story and how vibrant the colors are. The thing I absolutely hated about this movie was is it was dubbed in English. If Amazon would of put in the title (Dubbed in English) I wouldn't of paid to watch it. English voice over takes away from the film it self and ruins it. I've read reviews that people say they hate reading sub titles and I think then watch a English movie!!!,1331078400,,424,4.120481927710843
2679566,3,B000JVSUXO,"The plot may be good, but poorly done Chinese film that doesn't have anything good to say about and very, very uninspiring. Wouldn't recommend.",1313798400,,143,5.0
2679567,2,B000JVSUXO,"Good director, great actors, an interesting premisse and a massive budget. Yes, I was impressed and bought this DVD not having seen it in the theater.

I had huge expectations, so was quite disapointed by the final result. The story could be so much better in so many ways, although there are some scenes, dialogues and plot twists that I would easily give 4 or 5 stars - beautiful and smart...unfortunately a few seconds later other childish scenes completely throw me out of balance (for example, the ease wich everybody falls in love in this place! The stampede in the battle! Etc.).

I love fantasy movies, it's not a real vs impossible question here; it's a matter of credibility and common sense. Obviously, if you watch this movie as a fairy tale of sorts (where motives, feelings and actions are much simplified), you might appreciate a lot this film - I watched it like a fantasy romantic drama film, and as such I gave it 2 stars (although the finale is quite interesting).

The extras in the DVD are quite good and they include teaser, trailer, interview with the director and a behind the scenes documentary.

I would advise you to see this movie and give it a chance, you will find beauty in this work. But don't expect a master piece.",1287187200,,1248,4.608108108108108
2679568,4,B000JVSUXO,"The delivery was reasonably quick (about a week) and the product was new, despite the price being a quarter of other vendors'. My only complaint is that this is the American redistrobution of the movie, and is missing several scenes from the original. Overall, however, I am perfectly satisfied with this purchase",1282003200,,313,5.038461538461538
2679569,5,B000JVSUXO,"This film comes admirably close to the high-art masterpieces of Zhang Yimou, despite what some of the reviewers here would suggest. I agree, some of the CGI is not up to snuff, but it's a visually gorgeous film nonetheless: opulent, vibrant, and vivid. If this was made with a good deal less money than Yimou's films, then we have more reason to praise it, not less. The story is engaging and interesting from start to finish, with plenty of surprises along the way. The film begins with an almost campy comedic tone and ends with high-styled Shakespearian pathos. In my opinion, this film is a very fine, polished work of art and deserves to be regarded as such.",1281052800,,663,4.627118644067797
2679570,5,B000JVSUXO,"I had been looking for this movie on DVD since not long after it came out in theatres.
Visually stunning, wonderful color that really flows thru the entire story.  The story is incredibly touching. Worth watching over and over again.

DVD quality is great! Special features are so cool! Dubbing was very well done (although having British voice actors was a little strange) but I would recommend watching it with original audio with subtitles.

First- rate DVD experience all around. Highly recommended!",1280793600,,503,5.109756097560975
2679571,4,B000JVSUXO,"This was an entertaining dubbed film staring Nicholas Tse and Cecilia Cheung. The story revolves around  Qingcheng a young girl who is `blessed' or `cursed' (depending on your perspective) by a goddess. In exchange for beauty and power, she is doomed to lose the man she loves. The hero is a slave, who secretly loves her- however, there is a love triangle of sorts, between Qingcheng, the slave and his master. The villain is Nicholas Tse, the super hot  actor/singer.

What I liked most about the film was how beautiful it was. The plot itself was a bit silly and melodramatic and had a fairy-tale-esque quality, however, once you get past the ludicrous beginning, (the cattle stampede and the slaves running on all-fours), the film became entertaining.

I liked Nicholas as the evil villain who trusted no one and the beauty of the costumes and scenary. I especially thought the goddess was cool-looking with her hair held up and entwined with the halo.

If you like fairytales and can overlook a rather strange beginning, this was an entertaining film, worth a rental.",1266710400,,1072,4.868131868131868

2679573,5,B000JVSUXO,"The Promise is an exquisite film full of lush colors and unique characters all wrapped up in a great fantasy setting.  There is some initial silliness during the time the main character is introduced; however, it is disposed of rather quickly and the remainder of the film is a wonder to behold.  If you enjoy Asian films or anime (Japanese Animation) you will enjoy the characters in this film and the unique world they inhabit.  If you enjoyed Hero or House of Flying Daggers and Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon you'll like this.",1219622400,,530,4.739130434782608
2679574,3,B000JVSUXO,"The visuals are neither ""breathtaking"" nor is the action ""heart-stopping,"" as the cover would have you believe.  In fact, most of the props look like they were made with with sheet tin and spray paint, and *I* could have done better martial arts choreography.  =/

This is not a bad movie.  It's simply not a *good* one.  I tolerate it because I have a weakness for Asian fantasy armor, and honestly that and an interestingly done romantic triangle are only reasons to buy this movie.

Unlike previous films coming out of China, showcasing their wealth of raw human talent with spectacular martial artists, acrobats and set designers; The Promise plays like a B-movie by making the mistake of attempting epic scope with a shoestring budget.  Very sad.  =/

In many respects this movie plays very similarly to a previous Korean film called Musa: The Warrior.  Both feature a similar love triangle (slave, general, princess); the armor of the major characters attempts similar grandiosity; in both we are given the weak *suggestion* of a cast of thousands (in Musa by representing the entire Mongol hoard with a dozen or so badguys who change costumes; in The Promise by using bad CG), and in both the viewer gets the distinct impression that there's a great deal left to be desired.

UNLIKE Musa, some of the actors in The Promise can actually act -and Dong-Kun Jang and Cecilia Cheung deliver excelent and emotive performances as the slave and the princess.  Previous commentors have noted that while most of the acting in this movie seems wooden or trite, there are indeed several moving scenes, and they're all when these two are put together on screen.

If you have watched The Warrior and enjoyed it -I did, despite its obvious lackings- you will enjoy this.  This isn't a deep, resonant morality play like Curse of the Golden Flower, and it isn't a luxurious spectacle like House of Flying Daggers.  It CERTAINLY isn't anything like the masterpieces that Hero and Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon were.
It's an okay movie. Enjoy it or avoid it for what it is.",1209859200,3,2062,4.818181818181818
2679575,4,B000JVSUXO,"I just purchased and watched this movie for the first time and I have to say, having watched many films from this genre, this ranks up there with the best of them!

The ONLY unfortunate think about this movie is the fact that the filmmakers decided it was BEST to leave most of the deleted scenes out. After watching them, I felt they should've stayed in the film, they were GREAT scenes, and they added A LOT of explanation to the story line.

Other than that, I thoroughly enjoyed the film!",1209254400,,492,4.395604395604396
2679576,5,B000JVSUXO,"This was exquisite. If you enjoyed Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, you will love this. Sanada's performance was brilliant as always. This is high art done with passion and imagination. Highly recommended!",1205107200,4,203,5.580645161290323
2679577,4,B000JVSUXO,"the story, is a fable/fairy tale that has been around for ages, ""watch out what you wish for because you may just get it"".  This was a visually beautiful film, which, I think, with maybe a few ""adult scenes"" deleted, could be suitable for children.  I also thought it was a little too long. Like a lot of Asian movies of late, it's all about overblown set design, and wispy storylines.  I liked it but wouldn't buy it.",1201824000,,418,4.333333333333333
2679578,5,B000JVSUXO,"""The Promise"" is one of the 3 best movies that I have ever seen, the other two being ""Bichunmoo"" and ""The Restless.""  It has an excellent story-line and plot structure one of the best that I have seen. Unlike the other two movies that I just mentioned it has a happy ending, which makes it very good in my opinion. The cinemetography is also very well put together making the move both visually and mentally appealing.

This is also one of the few movies that I have ever seen which seems to portray longevity as a positive feature.  Most movies condemn it as evil or something to that effect which always struck me as insane and stupid and turned me off from lots of movies like ""Aeon Flux"" among others.

More than one of the other reviewers on here has said they disliked it or couldn't follow it, but weren't reading the subtitles.  That is entirely understandable.  In most movies, in order to understand the plot, you must listen to what the actors are saying.  There really is no other way.  That being said, the plot is complex, which is one of the reasons that I like it so much.  Most movies of the past few years are very simplistic and, therefore, in my opinion boring and unsophisticated.  This one is not, which makes it much superior to them.",1199836800,,1257,4.449781659388647
2679579,4,B000JVSUXO,"Choice... I think the title pretty much sums it up.  Need I say more?  Probably not, but I will.  In my brief encounter with the film I found it to be, delicious.  It was juicy like a south african steak tenderized to perfection by a million tiny lashes of my tongue over a period of three days.",1199836800,,295,4.12280701754386
2679580,2,B000JVSUXO,"Chen Keige's misbegotten The Promise is possibly the only Asian film that can make you feel sorry for Harvey Weinstein, who pre-brought the film before realizing that he'd made a big mistake on seeing the end result. It's hard not to think that all that bad karma from cutting Asian films to ribbons finally caught up with him with this one. I should have known what to expect when I saw Etchie Stroh's name as one of the producers. It's not a total loss, but it is a helluva mess just on a technical level, boasting probably the worst CGI effects in a big budget film. Some of them look just one step up from animatics or late 80s arcade games, while the opening stampede plays like a Road-Runner cartoon crossed with an early Neolithic cave painting. But then the sound mixing is sometimes equally awkward, leaving you with the impression that the film was rushed into completion in the hopes of scoring some Oscar nominations that they didn't quite manage to finish any it. Of course, it is just possible that everyone concerned saw what a totally bonkers movie this is and decided to sneak home early from work each day.

It's not fair to describe it as Asia's Alexander, because although often horribly executed, there was a governing intelligence behind that. By contrast, this seems more of a cynical attempt to capture a slice of the international market Zhang Yimou and Ang Lee cornered with a fantasy epic cum fairytale. Unfortunately, despite a promising initial premise and mostly game performances, Kaige really isn't suited to this kind of material and seems to be throwing in elements simply because they worked in other people's hit movies. There are a few good moments - the wall of time flashback, the ending - but most of it is just so bizarrely wrong that you just go on watching to see what comes up next. I think rescuing the heroine from her giant gilded birdcage, wrapping her in feathers and then running with her flying like a kite on a string probably takes the WTF? award, but the bull run comes a close second.",1198800000,5,2039,4.632596685082873
2679581,4,B000JVSUXO,"For those of you that enjoyed the old school filming of wuxia movies.  You will love this film.  For those of you still reluctant to accept fanatasy genre movies you will dislike this film. Its not lord of the rings, but its an interpretation of a legend and a great one.  Its not the best films I've seen but one of the newer ones done in the same style.  Like crouching tiger and Hero, its strength lies in its fight sequences but lacks a solid storyline.  If you enjoyed any of these 3 flicks I urge you to watch The Conquerer's Concubine if you can find it on dvd.  It is the rarest movie.",1195171200,,593,4.157894736842105

2679583,2,B000JVSUXO,"Having seen ""Hero"" and ""House of the Flying Daggers,"" I expected a great deal out of ""The Promise."" The story combines a number of interesting folk tale-esque elements - a princess who, at an early age, chose to be beautiful but, in return, is cursed at love; a brash and boastful warrior-virtuoso and his servant, who can run faster than the wind; and their opposite numbers, a cruel villain who seeks a secret only the brash warrior's servant can reveal. As the plot unfolds, a love triangle and cases of mistaken identity ensue, leading to a fairly emotional climax. The story, however well-conceived, ultimately falls flat and fails to deliver on its early promise. The film's production design and special effects also leave a great deal to be desired, making the daring-do of the heroes frequently appear laughable. Indeed, for an action film, there are also very few battle scenes to break up the monotony. Those interested in a good kung fu movie would do better to check out either a massive epic the likes of ""Hero,"" or a romp such as ""Iron Monkey.""",1186272000,6,1059,4.760869565217392
2679584,2,B000JVSUXO,"In the beginning a starving young girl named Qingcheng is seen prying food out of the hands of dead soldiers in a forest. While running home to share her bread with her mother she drops it in a lake. As she starts to cry the bread is brought back to her by a goddess and she tells Qingcheng to eat the bread but she will not eat because she is saving it for her sick mother. The goddess tells Qingcheng that her mother is dead and then offers her a choice of riches and beauty but all men she falls in love for will die unless she can turn back time and undo what she has just done. She's a little girl with nowhere to go and no food so of course this deal is too tempting to pass up and she accepts. A while later during a battle of a 3000 man army defeating 20,000 barbarians a slave named Kunlun with a speedy gift is discovered while trying to outrun the barbarians.

Kunlun's ability impresses general Guangming  also known as ""Master of the Crimson Armor"" and is taken in as a slave by the general. The general has been informed that the King is being attacked by Duke Wuhuan from the north but before he can get there he is attacked by Wuhuan's assassin Snow Wolf, the general is saved by Kunlan but receives a bad wound trying to defend himself. The general can't make the journey to protect the king and sends Kunlun with his crimson armor instead. The general tells Kunlun that the king will be the only one without a weapon. Kunlun goes to protect the king and when he arrives at the palace sees a man with a sword about to kill a beautiful woman and kills him before he can get to the woman and then flees with her. Kunlun eventually is cornered by Wuhuan's men and is told if he jumps into the waterfall behind him the princess will live but before he jumps he promises the princess he will never let her die.

This is one movie that had the money, a cool plot, and even had a good cast to support it. I think the first mistake was the director went crazy with his budget and though I do realize this is a fantasy movie but there is just too much. There was too much CGI and it was done ridiculously bad, there were fight scenes but they were bad fight scenes. The fights were awfully choreographed like the director got his child to choreograph the scenes for him. You could barely see anything when there was a fight because there was a weird cinematography that was used during the scenes, it will remind you of the type in ""Warriors of Virtue"" used in a bad way. The story goes everywhere before it ends, the princess's character is written poorly. She's supposed to be in deep love but how does fall in love with a guy she just met and then fall in love with another guy.

The thing with ""The Promise"" is not the back-story because it is interesting but the way it develops is crazy its too slow and makes feelings unrealistic. How can you truly believe that the princess is in love when she just met the guy and even worse isn't even the guy that she thinks saved her. Despite a bad script the actors keep you interested in the film until the end. The settings are undoubtedly beautiful, which is noticed right from the beginning, but the CGI should have been scrapped and done with more taste. The fights which were suppose to be a big part of this film could have helped give this film more interest and life but that fails.

The visuals are incredibly beautiful, the story was very engaging, and there's tons of action. Some of the scenes can seem somewhat silly, but as long as you realize that this is a fantasy film and let yourself be immersed in this fantasy world, you will enjoy it. I have the 103 min version, which I understand was shortened from the original 121 min version to make the story easier to understand.

2679586,3,B000JVSUXO,"Chen Kaige acted in ""The Last Emperor"" and directed ""Farewell, My Concubine"" that was nominated for the Best Foreign Language Film in 1993.  My understanding is that this film made a lot of money in China; but for me it translates less well into our Western mindset.  I enjoyed the fantasy part with the goddess giving Quingcheng a magic pact that she would be wealthy, but not have true love.  Cecilia Cheung won Best Actress from the Hong Kong Film Awards for this film.  She does a credible job as the woman who wants the one thing she cannot have, love.  I saw Jang Dong-gun in the Korean film ""The Coast Guard.""  As the slave Kunlun, he has giant puppy dog eyes for the lovely Quingcheng.  His ability to run at the speed of lightning that comes from his childhood citizenship in the Land of Snow reminded me of watching an old Road Runner cartoon.  After the death of his master, he agrees to be the slave of General Guangming.  Hiroyuki Sanada who plays the general was in ""The Last Samurai"" that starred Tom Cruise.  I couldn't quite guess what the attraction was that drew Quingcheng to him, but he fills the bravado of the character with excellence.  I saw Nicholas Tse in a DVD that may no longer be available called ""Gen X-Cops.""  While that wasn't the best of films, as the evil nemesis Wuhuan, he does a great job.  Costumes and scene design are excellent and give the film an amazing look.  Hollywood has been slow to adopt the emphasis on the visual that is now frequently seen in Asian cinema.  The Golden Globes nominated this film as Best Foreign Language Film in 2005.  For me, it didn't play quite as well.  It was certainly an epic journey filled with action and romance, but by the end of the film I wasn't all that connected to the characters.  I think I most enjoyed Nicholas Tse's nefarious Wuhuan; so you know a film didn't work when you're rooting for the bad guy.  It is still worth seeing given that expectations are not too high.  Enjoy!",1178841600,3,1968,4.474719101123595
2679587,4,B000JVSUXO,"The story, very basically, is that a girl meets up with a spirit or goddess, not sure which, but that she will have wealth, but she will never know love, and that any man she does love will leave or die. Enter the handsome bad guy in the movie, and the good looking hero. There's several story lines going on. There's a captain who falls in love with her (lust more like), the servant who actually saved her in the first place who truly loves her, and the good looking bad guy who wants to possess her as a trophy. The servant type hero character is actually the last of a village the handsome bad guy wiped out, and so, he finds out that he has special abilities too.

There are parts of this movie that movie a bit slowly, but the sets, the dialogue, the story itself and the beautiful costuming come together to make this a movie worth seeing. Good luck finding it at rental stores, but if you like Asian Fantasy movies with vivid colours, moving storylines, action, adventure and richly made costumes, then you should make the effort to see this one.",1177977600,3,1054,4.377551020408164

SPOILER

SPOILER below

The fact that the slave-since-near-birth becomes an ultra-confident, kunfu master and subsequently becomes a greater noblemen then his new master is only ludicrous in the sense that we see no progression to this state.  Its a huge jump in a characters which has no logical bearing.

Additionally, we think the villian is attempting to subvert the emporer, yet later in the movie the ""council"" of the city seems to divest to the villian, as if the upheavel the villian initially caused was forgiven.  Just odd.  We also see no resolution for the fallen-generals betrayal by his right hand man.

Yes, their are beautiful sequences, but your too much trying to figure out exactly what the hell the director is trying to accomplish.

If The Promise cut out 4 of its weird sub-plots, and focused on the rest of them (by building them up sequentially) perhaps we would have understood the story and identified with the characters.",1173225600,5,1137,4.942105263157894

I was hoping for something along the lines of ""Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon"" or ""House of Flying Daggers"" but this movie does not even compare. Instead it comes off as a cheap knock off of one of these great Chinese movies.

The worst part about this movie is the visual effects. It tries to emulate the effects of the two movies I listed above, but it looks like it was done on a $5 budget, making it nearly unwatchable. I am ashamed that I sat through this movie when I could have spent my time doing something that I would have enjoyed more, like giving the cat a bath.",1173225600,6,672,4.209302325581396
2679594,1,B000JVSUXO,"I happened to catch this movie shortly after it was released in China, meaning this review is on the original uncut theatrical version. I'll tell you right now, it doesn't matter which version you're watching because it is still nonsense either way. Especially if you're from China, you probably already know how incredibly bad this movie was received. This is supposed to be a fantasy, and you're not really supposed to question what happens in fantasies. But many of the things in this movie were so illogical and unbelievable it makes me wonder if Chen Kaige even watched it himself. It seems like he was so excited with all the ideas he came up with that he had no idea how to organize anything. This movie was a critical failure and a national joke in China, and it's easy to see why.

Read any summary of The Promise and you'll most likely come across something along the lines of this: a cursed princess who's the center of attraction of three different men and the fates that await them. Sounds engaging, right? Unfortunately, the movie hardly ever explores this idea any further than what I've just said. It plods along through a series of flying colors, generic action sequences, ridiculously awful dialogue (especially if you know Mandarin), overdone yet bland special effects, and a story almost completely devoid of logic and all things reasonable. The fact this movie in its current form is the final product is absolutely unbelievable. Asian directors nowadays think they can just thrust famous actors into a colorful world and expect Hollywood to be impressed.

I won't give away spoilers, but the story itself is too disjointed to say anything and virtually every scene is so sensationalized that you could care less what is happening to the people in them. In fact, the cast are not even people to really care about, but rather just an assembly of characters and nothing more. There is no meaningful connection to them because the movie never makes up its mind what it wants to talk about. New situations arise, expect you to be concerned, only to end up undeveloped or forgotten. Scenes make no sense in relation to the ones that preceded them and so forth. It's difficult to provide examples without explaining exact details from the movie, but a lot of the characters' actions were just so utterly mind-boggling, flip-flopping feelings and emotions were unconvincingly bad and laughable.

A lot of people raved at how ""beautiful"" the movie was, even though a majority of it looked like it was done on someone's home computer. There are video games, television shows and commercials that produced far better results than this. When nobody was trying to kill each other with plastic toys as weapons, they were being modeled in blatantly horrendous CGI fakery. The musical score was far too bombastic for its own good in an attempt to somehow generate a response from viewers but was totally out of place. Some scenes were displayed only to show off special effects or action (like what was that giant circular cage doing in the middle of nowhere?). Also, the Mandarin spoken in this movie was absolutely dreadful. This is what happens when you take any of Asia's hottest stars, dress them up in costumes and try to pass it off as a new movie.

I can't believe how much money was spent on this garbage, and it's hard to believe the number of people who gave this their approval. Apparently, you're supposed to let yourself go because it's a fairy tale. Sorry, but even fairy tales are supposed to make sense. In this movie, Chen Kaige made the characters do things that would have made little sense in anyone's culture or language. Even if all the terrible technical issues of the movie were resolved, it still would not have made much of a difference due to an inane story that is confused upon itself. Once you look past all the extravagance, what you get a series of events that try to come together and convey certain themes, but ends up a complete mess. I'm guessing people only liked watching the moving pictures because I can't think of any other reason to like this movie.",1173139200,11,4098,4.7594936708860756
2679595,2,B000JVSUXO,"This film was a complete disappointment. I have been a fan of Chinese films for years ( both mainland and Hong Kong) and there are certain things that I've come to expect: 1. An original concept or original approach to a popular concept, 2. Atleast an attempt at moving performances ( You ever notice how,even in cheesy exploitatative Hong Kong pictures, the actors seem to be taking there performances and the material very seriously?) and  3. Tight, clever, and well executed action sequences.  In this film you get none of those things. The concept is weak, the acting is tired (with the exception of Hiroyuki Sanada as The General), and the fight scenes are sloppy (they kind of flop around at each other like in a Jean Claude Van-Damme movie).  To be fair, I believe that the version of the film I saw was the American cut which is missing 19 minutes of footage from the original, and from what I could tell from the ""deleted scenes"" section of the disk, this may account for why the characters' motivation makes no sense.  The only redeeming parts of the film are a few really beautiful FX/scenic shots, but these shots are static. The best shots in an action film are static shots...

2679597,3,B000JVSUXO,"Chen Kaige is one of the greatest directors in China and his film Farewell My Concubine(Gong Li, Leslie Cheung). That was a decade ago at least when he had a different approach and style. With the current trend and demand for lavish period kungfu movies, it was inevitable that even Chen would want to have a blockbuster like Hero and Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. He does have the budget to make The Promise to be that kind of film, and the final product looks obsolutely stunning in an artistic aspect.

The film stars an all-star international cast including HK's ""It Girl"" Cecilia as the love interest of the emperor, Nicolas Tsai as the rebellious prince, Korea's Jang Dong Jun as the super-fast runner, and the director's wife plays a powerful Goddess. The story is a combination of fair tale and romantic war movie set in ancient China. The individual fight scenes were pretty good, but the huge army battles looked very cartoonish because the CGI's were not realistic. What's very impressive is the production design, wardrobe, and even music score. The actors weren't very well directed and their performances seemed unconvincing and emotionally unaffecting. Nothing like Leslie Cheung and Gong Li's memorable performances. There was an unintentional funny scene when Cecilia was about to be attack by hundreds of soldiers. She was standing on the roof and proceeded to use her beauty and sex appeal to discourage them from killing her. It really looked comical and hideous, because she thought every men on earth would find her attractive and irresistable. I find that she's either too young or too modern looking to play such period beauty, and she just didn't have the kind of look and impact made by Joey Wong in A Chinese Ghost Story (1,2,3).",1169856000,4,1758,4.91919191919192

Unfortunately, I found the story line to be just bearable.  There's a lot of fantasy involved and perhaps it was a metaphor for something that I haven't grasped yet.  Regardless, it just didn't pan out for me in the end and I found myself wishing it was better written.

That said, I need to reiterate: this is one of the single most beautiful films I have ever seen.

There is one particularly bad CG sequence, but beyond that, it is a visual masterpiece, hence the five star rating despite a lackluster storyline.

It goes without saying that in order to fully appreciate this film you need to have a deep love of cinematography, an interest in Chinese independent films, and an open mind.

With that being said, all that's left is to sit back and let the magic unfold.

This film perfectly illustrates what our most vivid interpreted fairy tails would look like.  The colors are deep and saturated, the characters are exaggerated and play their roles well, and the setting is otherworldly while still being familiar.

I will admit that certain scenes were a bit too ambitious for the special effects the production team had at their disposal, but the beauty of the overall experience makes up for a few botched scenes.

I recommend watching the original, uncut film with subtitles and then going back and watching the dub to allow yourself ample time to just look at the film.  To really take it in to fully realize the mastery in the sets, costumes and over all design.

If you're at all interested in this film, see it.  It is breath taking.  A rare gem.  Not a material arts action movie, but rather a fairy tail romance brought to life.",1169251200,6,1201,4.617924528301887

I recommend this movie to anyone that enjoys beautiful cinematic Chinese martial arts films.  the CG has some parts that are hard to believe but they're bearable.  I loved it and you might too.

2679602,2,B000JVSUXO,"Being a big a fan of Asian cinema I had read quite a few negative to luke warm reviews of this film and thought I would give it a try.

The Story is not as bad as I was led to believe. I will not go into the story description as it has been covered. It is full of the virtues that I like so much in Asian films. Honor, sacrafice, and death.

The DVD I watched was the shorter version. It includes the deleted scenes which I watched and do not feel they added or subtracted a whole lot from the story. The fact that the Asian release included them makes me wonder why they were cut out. The bothersome issue with this DVD is the film defaults to the awful english over dubs. You have to manually go into the menu and choose Chinese (Mandarin), and then designate english sub titles.

I love Crouching Tiger, Hero and House of Flying Daggers. This movie is none of those. While it has some beautiful moments it does seem 'synthethic'. If it were the directors intent to create an abstract feel he suceeded.

The CGI is deplorable. I have no problem with the fantasy aspect but this looked almost animated. Maybe Lord of the Rings ruined it for all but if this was supposed to be the most expensive movie ever made in China they could have done better. An example: the over view of the palace is a model. Absolutely obvious. The flying fights made so famous on other films of the genre are not at all fluid here, but jerky and clumsy.

All in all I watched with intrest. I had no desire to turn it off. I may have even given it three stars but I did grade it against the likes of Hero and House of Flying Daggers which may be unfair. I recommend watching it if you like the aforementioned films. My opinion may not be yours.",1166918400,24,1721,4.187311178247734
2679603,5,B000JVSUXO,"The version I watched was the international version, which is 20 minutes longer than the U.S. version (which I don't intend to watch.  What's the point?), so I can't comment on what might be left out in the shorter version.  Personally, I thought ""The Promise"" was a brilliant film, worthy of multiple viewings.  The cinematography is breathtaking, and I didn't feel that any of the CGI effects came off as cheesy.

However, this film is definately not for everyone.  If you have a problem with wuxia films, then you are definately not going to like this.  To appreciate the genre, one must accept that the characters are endowed with supernatural abilities.  I've spoke to many people who don't like wuxia because they think they're unrealistic.  Curiously, these same people have no problem with ""The Matrix"" and ""Star Wars"", which are equally unrealistic. And if you're just looking for eye candy and cool fight scenes, you may be equally disappointed.  While ""The Promise"" has both eye candy and action in spades, it also contains a very complex plot.  You really have to pay close attention, or you're going to get lost very quickly.  I would reccomend you watch ""Fearless"" instead. That's a film that's not only great, but also quite easy to follow.

But if I had to choose between the two, I'd choose this one.  I like films that really push the envelope and strive to succeed on every level. ""The Promise"" delivers.  Highly recomended.",1166918400,16,1443,4.836734693877551
2679604,3,B000JVSUXO,"In WU JI (`THE PROMISE') Kaige Chen has attempted to surpass the major Chinese epics of recent years with mixed results: there are moments of stunningly beautiful color and a story that is more human than the grand films by others, but the end product is too tampered with crude computer graphics and cheesy scenes to sustain the belief in fantasy that these films require.

The opening scene where Qingcheng (uncredited as a child actress) is confronted by the Goddess Manchen (Hong Chen) in the middle of an aqueous atmosphere and the 'promise' is contracted is as sensuously lovely as anything on film. But from there we plough through a story of fighting between barbarians and royalty, of love affairs between Princess Qingcheng (Cecilia Cheung as the adult version) and the General Guangming (Hiroyuki Sanada) with the addition of love interest from the General's slave Kunlun (Dong-Kun Jang), and of confrontations with mythic figures such as the Snow Wolf (Ye Liu) and the evil Wuhuan (Nicholas Tse), and the stories collide and ultimately get lost in the special effects.

Much can be said for the cinematic beauty of this film: equal disappointment can be voiced for the crude computer graphics and tacky mass scenes with weapons that look plastic Tonka toys. In the end it feels as though the director/writer was more interested in the competing ingredients of his colorful soup than in the work as a whole. Another problem with the DVD is the superimposed English dubbing that is completely out of sync with the story AND subtitles that conflict with the language of the film: to see this unfortunate mismanagement of effects, turn on the English dubbing simultaneously with the English subtitles and see how even the numbers being spoken aren't even close to being the same!
