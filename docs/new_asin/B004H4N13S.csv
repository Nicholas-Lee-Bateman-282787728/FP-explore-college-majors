The actors in these look like they are having fun. Buy it, watch it with kids, can't go wrong. :)",1297555200,6,274,4.333333333333333
4375100,4,B004H4N13S,"Ok loved Scooby Doo and Monsters Unleashed.  I was a bit scared of Mystery Begins but it turned out to be quite fun.  There just hasn't been anything Scooby that I haven't liked.

I was really hyped up for this movie, so much that we made it a point to get together at my house to watch the premier (say what you want but when you get to an age like me where you are trying to relive your childhood as much as possible before you REALLY get old, you appreciate these things lol)  As a whole I think this movie was good, it flows from the last movie and it ends with resolution while leaving an obvious opening for another movie (apparently the cast has a contract for 3 movies so fingers crossed).

I knew it would only be a matter of time before romance became a major subject of these younger series and here it is.  Shaggy is crushing on Velma.  Thank you for finally getting this out there!  You can't run around 2 girls and 2 guys solving mysteries without at least being interested once in your colleagues and I have always thought it was funny that Shaggy and Velma didn't have something going on.  Well, this movie explains why they don't.  Good job filling in some cracks.  You also see a glimpse of Fred with the vintage look.  Funny and hopefully that is going to lead up to the classic look.

Lake Monster is very childish.  Fun, but still harder to get into than any other Scooby movie.  Great for young kids but mature viewers like me, eh, maybe you should get into a 3rd grade mindset first.  Just a suggestion.  Someone commented in a review that the movie was boring.  While to me it did not seem near as boring as you made it out to be, I totally feel where you are coming from.  There is a lot of down time and yes, its easy to kind of drift off.

The movie is not even out so I don't want to go into a lot of plot detail (and anyone that knows Scooby Doo shouldn't need a summary anyways) Monsters, mystery, chase.  I think this is something you will want to pick up for a little light childish humor.  The actors are what have made this series anyways, so I can understand a little poor writing, they still pull it off oh so well.",1297209600,11,2151,4.195121951219512
4375101,4,B004H4N13S,It is a Good Movie because it is Scooby Doo. They kept the same guy as Shaggy which I liked. I also enjoyed how Scooby was more funny in this one. However the plot wasn't the best. I hope the blu ray graphics are good,1296691200,3,217,3.8444444444444446

4375144,4,B004H4N13S,Its made for tv love action the Scooby gang are actually teenagers movie... Fred still has brown hair? And scooby is poorly animated and infrequently shown. The story line is weird and in both of these ghosts and monsters are real. The kids wanted them and usually I'm a scooby snob because most of the new ones are junk but these are tolerable. The children do not like what ended up being the truth in this one and they thought that it would have been better were the monsters less close and less real or something but we like it.,1454716800,2,532,4.33

4375149,4,B004H4N13S,"I was born in October 1979
so i was lucky enough to experience tv at a very good time
when re-runs hit  (So i got to discover some of the best  Classic tv from the 70's and early 80's)
Three major things that are my earliest memories
Atari 2600,
The Three Stooges
and Scooby Doo!
Growing up you were either a Classic WB or Disney Kid
Not me I loved Hanna-Barbera they put out Scooby Doo Where Are You! along with  The Flintstones, The Jetsons,  Top cat and other off-the wall Alt. Comics
I taped this lived action movie not even knowing it was a live action flick
Once it got going i was like eh  5 more min.
For what this is it's pretty amazing they did a lot with so very little (It was a made for tv movie)
The biggest problem with this film is the lack of the main star
Scooby comes and goes (I guess they had budget restrictions?)
When he is on screen he looks so/so sometimes he's CGI F/X looks good other times it's blah and cheap
But, that can be over looked
 Frank Welker does the v/o of Scooby and it's spot on when you get him
The rest of the cast is fits the right way (compared to the Studio Version's)
Robbie Amell as Fred  (he is the right Fred there's personality there unlike in the Theatrical films)
Kate Melton  as Daphne (she is the perfect live action Daphne we never got before too) her look and the voice you can just tell she was trying to do right by the cartoon and the fans!
Hayley Kiyoko  as Velma  (Perfect Velma spot on the way she moved and talked it's crazy that a tv movie could find lesser known actors (without egos to play parts and give it there all)
Nick Palatas as Shaggy  (he is the weak link in the cast but, that's not his fault at all Matthew Lillard is flawless and can't be beat as far as being Shaggy)  Nick does the best he can it's a little over the top at times but, if you ever watched the Classic 1970's Scooby Doo Cartoons Shaggy is out-there

There's also some guest-star throw backs in this film
Ted McGinley,
Richard Moll (who hasn't aged a day since Night Court besides growing out his hair!)
Nichelle Nichols,
Marion Ross

The story involves a real supernatural element
The CGI Frog Creature Monster looks ok it's not over the top scary
kind of looks like something out of Gremlins II
It's basic (not sure if it's all digital F/X or what  it's like Scooby sometimes it looks good sometimes it's a little off

This is what it is but, for a made for tv movie it's very HQ due to a great cast but, lacking Scooby Doo

Its all about the Shag...and this movie - the actor that tried to impersonate shaggy just felt forced instead of a genuine performance.  All of the characters felt incredibly off. The dudes supposed to have blond hair...not dark...and an Asian Wilma? C,mon guys. I'm all about Asians, as I am one, and all about making something more fresh but 'op school characters need a o stay true to their core.

Even Scooby do looked off. Almost like they had half the CGI budget available for this round of Scooby.

But I was content with it and it was entertaining. I do think they should have focused more on Scooby and the mystery rather than the gang and their relationship problems. I still like the humor though. This particular mystery though I didn't really like. I like the case they worked on in the first movie more.

4375170,4,B004H4N13S,"This movie as well as it's predecessor are not meant to lead into the first two live action films.. Or even the original cartoon.. It takes place in modern time, with modern technology, Velma's Asian, and Fred's brunette (though there is a joke in this movie where he puts on a blonde wig as a disguise and likes the look) so you have to look at it as a new vision, a reinventing of the scooby brand for live action, and every scooby fan will be happy. So stop complaining about character changes, they didn't change their personalities at all. And the relationship stuff did take over too much of the plot, but they poke fun of that at the end when shaggy and Velma kiss and they agree there's no chemistry (which I very much appreciated, their relationship in the latest series ""Mystery Inc was just awkward as it was here - only here it's poked fun at essentially) and even Fred and daphne start dating here but mutually agree they're better staying friends. Everything was handled well. Scooby was missing from many scenes, he must've been too expensive to animate, and I admit it was distracting. And the ending was ruined by the fast forward at the beginning of the film all but giving it away. But fans need to get over Velma being Asian since with her big glasses it's not at all distracting and she brings the character to life, same goes for this dark haired Freddy - come on, it's always implied he bleached his hair, his eyebrows are always black! Overall, the first film was better, as we're the original two, but this was made for TV and it's just as much a new vision as it is a tribute and homage to the original cartoon.",1408233600,,1637,4.423841059602649

4375173,3,B004H4N13S,"First off 75% of this movie has to do with Fred/Daphne romance issues and Shaggy/Velma romance. I say Fred/Daphne issues because they really only circulate around jealousy. Fred teaching golf to a few girls. Daphne hugging her tennis partner and on and on. Luckily my 3 and 5 year olds have no clue or I would've turned it off.

Second, the mystery takes a backseat to the romantic aspect and my kids attention definitely waned throughout. NOT even remotely worth the $9.99 amazon instant video price.

And third, couldn't they find a blonde actor for Fred? Or at least dye this buff guy's hair yellow. I couldn't get past this, though my kids could kinda care less. Everyone else was reasonably passable, even Shaggy if only for the voice.",1404518400,,740,4.728682170542636

They were big budget and the actors did a terrific job at recreating the roles, none better than Lillard as Shaggy, of course, since he's done the animated role for years gave him plenty of practice. In these films, the actor who does Shaggy has 2 things down, he's skinny and he can make his voice crack, the same qualities present in every 12 yr old boy in the world! He does nothing else to make him capable to handle the role, Velma is an Amerasian actress, not a racial thing, it simply doesn't work any more than a white guy cast as Bruce Lee. Fred isn't even blonde and Daphne, the only one who wasn't a terrible fit, was 17 when this was shot with no previous acting experience. Scooby had little screen time but the animation was ok.

I was disappointed that Fred wasn't blond. He had the right physique and voice but the hair made me think it wasn't him.

The writers also had Daphne and Fred make out and begin a relationship which I didn't like as much. I preferred the tension between the couple and the big reveal didn't seem to add to the overall plot much.

The kids are looking for summer jobs but when a mystery needs solving they are on the job. It was a cute movie and played up to the stereotypes of the characters.

I do think they let Scooby take a backseat in this movie and a big part of that was probably to save money on the animation scenes. This one wasn't my favorite Scooby Doo but it was okay.",1343520000,,794,4.136363636363637

My sons, who ADORE Scooby Doo, kept asking, ""Who are those people with Shaggy and Scooby?""

That was 1 hour and 22 minutes of a true waste of time. I doubt the money they earned from the previous movie was actually spend on the making of this movie.

Please look at the one star reviews and see what they are saying. They point out that Fred has brown hair, the movie is more about the teenage love than the mystery (apparently they haven't seen Mystery Inc.), and the acting is horrible.

4375220,1,B004H4N13S,"Stuck in the computer waiting to be composited into the scenes. This of course costs money and as the 'Lake Monster', which yes (sigh) is real (again), contained the most detail and special FX, it obviously detracted from the script department's budget too.

'The Mystery Begins' wasn't too bad. In a generic and forgettable kids movie with licensed character pasted on top kind of way. Think Garfield. Sure the acting was a bit off, the score lifted straight from a 90's B movie, the ghosts were real - because its easier to blame everything on the supernatural -  and it felt nothing at all like the cartoon upon which it was 'based'. But I made some allowances, realising that the Scooby-Doo license will be abused from time to time.

This movie, however - wow! Is it a tax write-off? The horrible main plot is about Fred and Daphne and their dating experiences. Shaggy leads a musical number to declare his love for Velma. Scooby-Doo, as mentioned is absent in most scenes due to the rendering costs, and Velma - well, (Spoiler?) - has turned into a Witch's Ghost. Yes, you read correctly!

The movie also has some goofy songs and singing that the first film was smart not to have. Still, this cast shines better than Freddie Prinze Jr. and Sarah Michelle Gellar did in the other movies.

  I was into how the actor that plays Fred doesn't bother dying his hair blond or wearing goofy wigs or try too hard to be cool like Prinze Jr. did. While Daffney was never meant to be just plain ditsy and slow, she mostly was just into fashion in the original shows, but not really stupid or into hand to hand combat like the Michelle Gellar version. So this movie continued to get the characters right, but it's still a **1/2 star movie when the first was a *** star movie. It's just kind of lame and forgettable.",1320019200,,871,4.266666666666667

I was completely disappointed with the big budget version of Scooby Doo on the big screen, but was very happy with the Scooby Doo: They Mystery Begins made for TV reboot.  So I went into this with high expectations as I suspect other did, and this did not live up to those lofty goals.  The first was extremely well done (better as I said than the ones done with much bigger budgets), so this had big shoes to fill, and as is the case many times with sequels, it just couldn't live up to it.  That being said, it wasn't as awful as some would lead you to believe either.

Despite a mediocre script and some cheesy things that I can only assume were done for budget constrains, the cast was again excellent and true in their portrayal of their characters.  The standard Scooby Doo humor and homage gags are there, though not in as much abundance as the first one.

At $14.99 I think the price is a bit steep and wouldn't buy it unless you are certain you will watch it again, and even then I might consider waiting for the inevitable price drop that will happen... eventually.  In the mean time, for most, the rental will be enough to just see it once, be done with it, and to be caught up when (and if) they make a third installment.",1309824000,7,1299,4.252032520325203

Fred and Daphne are making out in like the first 10 minutes.  Then they discuss whether or not they are together.  Shaggys pining for Velma gets old fast.  They also do a little barbershop song and it screams cheese.  Glad we rented this instead of buying it.  Not at all like the original live animation Scooby Doo.

And plus, get this; it's a talking cartoon dog! Get a grip. I like a lot of Scooby Doo and I thought this was right up there with the best of 'em. There have been dozens of interpretations of the Scooby Doo formula over the past 45 years and if I have to say that this is just a new vision of said formula then have it that way. But as I just said... it's a cartoon. It's a silly cartoon gone live action... I see one reviewer say that kids' made for TV movies ain't what they used to be. What are we comparing to? H.R. Puffnstuff and the Magic Flute? A Mary Kate and Ashley Olsen film?

I thought that the first theatrical Scooby Doo was money well spent. The second theatrical release was just so so, as was the first TV joint with these kids. This follow up bit gave the new kids a chance to shine,,, with a plot that was actually somewhat engrossing for a Scooby Doo mystery. It has to do with a mysterious blue rock that holds the power of the moon, an old lake town, a witch from colonial times, and Velma getting possessed. It all rolls together into the story of the said title lake monster,,, and has some wild moments.

For those who like the sixties style, especially when the crew used to bust into musical numbers, well that happens twice. Twice! The sign of a great Scooby Doo mystery is when the band starts jamming on guitars out of nowhere and wearing tie-dyes.

Nick Palatas is my favorite Shaggy. Needless to say, he was even more funny in this one than the other Scooby movie he played in.

Sure, it was a predictable formula, but it was done well enough. Plus, it was relatively harmless.

This movie retains almost nothing from the 1968 series except for the characters and the scary monster, which is actually a monster. That's my biggest gripe with the story: instead of some harmless guy in a costume, they fill it with real monsters and a possession. Also, the cast spends more time trying to date each other than it spends on solving the mystery. Neither message is age appropriate for the type of kid that's going to be watching Scooby Doo.

As a movie onto itself, it is typical of the poorly developed story, forgetable dialogue, and wooden acting that you see in most of the made-for-kids TV movies. My kids were either too young for the scary scenes and romance or too old for the gags. This pretty much killed any future interest I have in buying any new Scooby products for my kids.

I will be much more carefull if there is another release before I buy.",1299542400,4,304,4.754716981132075
4375240,1,B004H4N13S,"I realize it is a kid's movie and I bought it for our 7 year old daughter. She loves Scooby Doo and had to have the new movie.  Normally I see her busting a gut over Scooby, which she did with the Scooby-Doo/Scooby-Doo 2: Monsters Unleashed.  She only laughed from time to time with this movie. Acting is horrible, the characters do not fit with the typical scooby characters.  Why does Fred have brown hair? What is with the lovefest between the characters. Not mention I thought it was a Scooby movie, his role is not as big as one might believe.

4375241,1,B004H4N13S,"first off i thought this would be a great new movie boy was i wrong .
first i would talk about the characters fred ,daphen ,velma ,shaggy and scooby doo
fred sucked and what is up with the black hair fred hair is blonde.
daphen sucked as well first off she didn't even act like her character suppose to.
shaggy sucked as well what is with the hair ?
velma was the only one who stuck to her character beside scooby doo .
scooby doo they making him look lighter in ever movie it seem to me .

for my opinion this was the worst scooby doo movie ever why are they tring to change a great thing when they got it stick to the original theme
why bring them dating come on it a kid show so stick to what everyone loves.

i like it when these character played the parts
matthew lillard  as shaggy
mindy cohn as velma

that just my thoughts....",1299369600,4,834,4.067073170731708
4375242,2,B004H4N13S,Much like The Mystery Begins the cast is all wrong.  The actor who plays Shaggy never gets the voice right and Fred has dark hair. Daphne just does not have the right spunk that Sarah Michelle Gellar gave to the role and Velma is flat. Too bad.,1299369600,6,244,4.191489361702128
4375243,1,B004H4N13S,"First, let me say two things.  First we LOVE Scooby Doo.  Second, I love this cast and we own Scooby Doo the Mystery Begins.  I had my doubts about Freddie and Shaggy not looking like the cartoon version but we loved the first movie they made.  The first one also bucked the Scooby Doo formula and had real ghosts but over all was great, we loved it.  This one is unfortunately a train wreck love story.  The main reason for this is they totally take out the mystery, it gets very little play time as they break the golden rule of Scooby Doo, there is not the subtle flirting there is dating between Freddie and Daphne; Shaggy is head over heals for Velma.  So you are left with Scooby Doo minus Scooby Doo and a mystery . . . you are left with a boring and annoying love story.  Really too bad as I love the cast.  I hope they wake up and get back to the Scooby Doo formula and make a third one.  If I want a teenage romance, I certainly won't turn to the Scooby gang.  All three of my kids and both adults in our family were really, really bummed as we own everything (really) else that is Scooby.  We will skip this one and hope you will to.
