7886084,5,6305251479,"In the mid-1960's, Marvel put most of it's top heroes into limited animation series that used to run...at least what I recall, was every afternoon.  Each day a different character was featured: Captain America, Iron Man, Thor, The Hulk, and the Submariner.  The ""animation"" used actual panels from the comic art and gave them very limited movement...perhaps and arm swinging or lips moving, etc...While primitive, it gave fans their Marvel heroes with stories from the actual comic books with art by people like Jack Kirby and others.  One of the true cheesy loves of these cartoons were the infections theme songs...""Doc Bruce Banner, belted by gamma rays, turn into the Hulk....""Even over 30 years later I still know the words to each of their theme songs.  It was great stuff.  The  hour shows were broken up into 3 six minute segments.  Throughout these limited shorts we see the origin of the Hulk and the cast of characters including Betty Ross, Major Talbot, and Gen. Thunderbolt Ross.  While the Hulk battled villains such as The Leader and the Abomination, it was Ross and the military who were his main foe in these early cartoons as Ross constantly hunted the Hulk down.  The voice acting was always fun, too.  It was overly dramatic but that really worked with everything else.  These really were like animated comic books.  Great fun!",1141171200,5,1347,4.88546255506608
7886085,5,6305251479,Lots of people accuse the animators for using the original art; but I have to say it does work in a limited way. You have to remember back in the mid sixties Marvel wanted any publicity it could get. They are good wholesome fun for any Marvel fan who wants to see the Hulk from his early days.  I thought it was great that the producers wanted to at least remain faithful to the comic...something future cartoon and movie adaptions didn't do.,1091491200,,442,4.390243902439025
7886086,4,6305251479,"this movie is the pilot ortest run show that spawned the tv show.it is a bit overly scientific at parts but is great nontheless.the docs ol lady gets killed and he couldn't save her.he is taking it really bad when he discovers gamma radiation in his patients.these patients summoned extraordinary strengths during times of stress.he gave himself a dose but accidentaly did way too much and started becoming the hulk.bill bixby is the doc and lou ferigno is the hulk.its been my experience that most kids only watch when the hulk is on the screen.it is better written than the more moden version but not nearly as good.i think only hardcore hulk fans will enjoy it despite its well thought out and intellectual approach.it is emotional in parts for all you chicks out there.being as how the doc is a wussy and this was the forerunner to a network tv show,there aren't even any cleavage or seductive smiles in this one.jack mcghee starts tracking the hulk everywhere.hes a reporter and this movies winner for unnecessarily over odsessively obnoxiouscharacter.it is not consistent with the comic book so don't get your hopes up.bill bixby is an excellent actor besides his wussy nature.i think this show is the best show ever made!",1089590400,,1228,4.880382775119617
7886087,1,6305251479,"Before the 70's tv series, all we had was this. I fell bad for everyone who wached this. All this is are pictures flying across the screen and mouths cheaply moving. And why does the hulk talk? Yes, he does talk like in the old comic and he sounds like frankinstein instead of what you would think he would talk like.
This was very bad, even for the 60's. Get the tv series instead.",1077753600,,382,4.175675675675675
7886088,4,6305251479,"At last, the Hulk's classic animated series is finally on video to enjoy. Everything about ""The Origin..."" was as it should be. General ""Thunderbolt"" Ross' Army chasing after Hulk, Igor's espionage which caused the ""accident"" to happen, and Dr. Bruce Banner's romance with Betty Ross. What surprised me the most was the Gorgon (actually, his true name's the Gargoyle). That ""mini-me"" villain was feared by many despite his size. But I couldn't help but sypathize when he cried and begged Banner and Rick Jones and sacrificing his own life.
  In ""The Power..."" the spotlight was more on Banner. He was wanted by the Penatgon, the Russian gov't and even local bandits. But when things too much to take, out came Hulk! The best part of the episode was when Hulk ended his fight with the Ruusian Army tanks with his gamma-powered shockwave trick that was, need I say it, incredible. The character I can't help but noticing was Major Talbot. This GI joke was always obsessed with destroying Hulk in the name of duty, as well as getting his mack-on with Betty. at least, the payback was sweet when Hulk handled Talbot, who yelled like SNL's Mr. Bill and fainted...ha-ha-ha!
  As part of the theme song says, ""ain't no monster crowned who is as lovable..."" as Hulk. ... I look at Ol' Greenskin as the real deal. And if you fans agree, buy this video...or ""Hulk smash!""",1015459200,3,1361,4.729957805907173
7886089,5,6305251479,"Shoddy production values notwithstanding, It was a blast seeing these shows for the first time in many years.  I too remember well all the  Marvel characters that made up  The Merry- Marching Marvel Society ( ""  march along, march along"").  I recommend any baby boomer and fan of  60's pop culture to get this and the other videos in this collection. Now  if only Fox would create a proper boxed set for these and more videos..  One  90's advantage here : Closed Captioning!  I could never fully  decipher all the theme song words...however is it not  BELTED by gamma rays  instead of melted?  Enjoy, True Believers!",948672000,5,616,4.688679245283019
7886090,3,6305251479,"As pointed out by the two previous reviewers, this video is a direct copy of two silver age comic books.  I can tell you that modern kids do not like the 1966 Marvel Super Heroes animations, and this video is more suitable  for a superhero comic book fan.  It's too bad that Fox did not research the  identity of the voice actors who deliver Stan Lee's over the top dialogue  perfectly.  There are actually 13 different Hulk stories animated in the  full series.  Only two of them are presented here.  The original comics  continued a story line over many issues and almost the entire early Hulk  ""cosmic sagas"" are available and would make a great box set.  If  you're listening Fox, Hulk animations are available for Hulk #1, 2, 3, 5,  6, Tales to Astonish # 60-81, and Avengers #2.  Why not include the entire  thing in its original serial format and leave in the title cards and  recaps?  If the silver age comic book trade on E-Bay is any indication,  these videos presented in this form would be valuable.  As kid videos, they  are worthless.",928195200,4,1048,4.526881720430108
7886091,3,6305251479,"The previous reviewer is right.  This video is made up of images lifted right out of the comics (Hulk #1 and Tales to Astonish #66)--they literally float across the screen.  Hulk's not very graceful, but you can see him  here cut an even line.  This is proto-animation and not very good.  Why get  it?  You get to see Kirby and Ditko art on tv.  Not only that--if you're a  Hulk fan you've got to hear to this awesome theme song (UPN's Hulk song  ""Hulk!  Hulk!  Hulk! Hulk!"" is put to shame.)
Only recommended  for die-hard Hulk fans (or Kirby fans).",922838400,6,550,4.38
7886092,3,6305251479,"I was stunned when I saw this video! ""The Origin Of The Hulk"" was simply lifted, panel-for-panel, from Lee and Kirby's classic story from The Incredible Hulk #1. Having seen ""Clutch Cargo"" I thought I  had seen the lowest of cheap animation, but NO! They took almost every  panel from the comic, recolored them, and simply animated the mouths and  arms! How much did Marvel pay for these cartoons back in 1966?!? The second  episode, ""The Power Of Dr. Banner"", was even worse! And yet,  somehow, I still felt I got my money's worth...simply for the origin story.  You do get to see the classic Kirby artwork on the TV screen. It's worth a  look from comic and animation fans, but don't expect quality on parr with  the ""Silver Surfer"" or ""New Adventures OF Batman And  Robin""...",920505600,,778,4.62043795620438
