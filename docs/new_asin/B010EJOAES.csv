7310467,4,B010EJOAES,This was an interesting family film. Hall and Dennis carry the film along with a capable supporting cast. I just found the plot a bit weak. Why would a woman want to divorce a good man who is a good provider? They could've sought counseling. She was angry because he focused on work and texting and did not make time for her. I liked the fact that their friends tried to help them stay together. This is what true friends are supposed to do. Payne is funny as usual in his role. This is a clean family film and would be rated PG. This is a nice romantic comedy. The moral of the story is that men and women must value their spouses and make time for them. Work cannot come before your mate. Men must make their women feel loved and desired. Recommended for fans of romantic films.,1460160000,,780,4.241610738255034

7310514,5,B010EJOAES,"This movie was very refreshing. I am a long time fan of the writer/director, Mark Harris. His characters are always positive and his stories uplifting. His other movie, Black Coffee is one of my favorites. If you want to see good movies with black characters shown in a positive light, check out this  movie and the rest of the Mark Harris movies. His movies show that independent films are definitely on the rise.",1447200000,4,414,4.671232876712328

7310518,5,B010EJOAES,"Good movie, I am surprised that this movie was clean, you don't find that in today's
movies. I would have liked to have seen more of belief and faith to give more of reality. To have success in marriage it takes a lot more faith and belief in GOD, there is no such thing of a successful marriage without it. The acting was well done and it was written good. This is one of those movies you would watch many times.",1446163200,3,413,4.111111111111111

My husband & I have been married 16 yrs going on 17 & we agreed that more movies should enhance 'specifically' black couples in staying together.  Children are suffering from one parent households.
The actors did a phenomenal job portraying their characters.  I added this movie to my collection of 'GREATS'.  Go rent it",1444867200,6,434,4.824324324324325
