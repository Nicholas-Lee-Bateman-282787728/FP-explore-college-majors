8160464,4,B000LAZE3M,So many DVDs and online aviation videos take huge liberties with facts and are overly dramatic. This is refreshingly different. The mail pilot segment has interviews with historians and actual mail pilots. Ditto for the Red Baron - WWI segment. It puts the lie to the myth that air combat then was somehow gentlemanly and chivalrous. The segment on Lindbergh is succinct and covers all the major points in 20 minutes. There are some shorter segments on Amelia Earhart. I use this in community college aviation classes and highly recommend it as a teaching resource. Each of the three major segments is about 20 minutes long.,1403568000,,624,4.89622641509434

8160466,4,B000LAZE3M,"Featuring the rarely told stories of what WWI dog fights were really like, the challenges and high death toll faced by the first brave men to fly US mail across the country, and the rise and fall of Charles Lindbergh this dvd covers a lot of ground. Using antique planes, first-person accounts, original footage where available and commentary by historians, each of the three segments flows seamlessly and offers a fascinating inside look at these lesser known but high-drama eras of aviation. Much of this material was new to me, and I greatly enjoyed it. The separation of the segments in nice because they can be watched all together movie-style or easily viewed alone if used in an educational or theme-specific setting. Highly recommend this one!",1305158400,,751,4.968253968253968
