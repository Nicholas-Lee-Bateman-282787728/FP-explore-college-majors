8203770,5,B000S1KUN8,"I must say this School Rumble Starter Set is probably one of the best deals ever. The locker has a few dents but none that would annoy you, the yearbook comes with there characters own comments. So funny I laughed while reading their comments. The Volume one came with the magnet set. Be careful though when you try to take out the magnet, cause i almost took the sticker of the magnet. So when you do make sure you are taking of the magnet and sticker together. This is awesome edition to anyone's anime collection.",1315008000,,516,4.442105263157894
8203771,5,B000S1KUN8,"This is an awsome tin! It had a few dents, but they arnt noticable. This comes with a dvd, inside the dvd box is season one and magnets. It also comes with a mini year book. This is one of the best deals on amazon I bought so far. This season is really funny, if you like comedy and love this is for you. Then you should also buy the second season!",1313020800,,348,3.8472222222222223
8203772,5,B000S1KUN8,"As the description says lots of funny and nothing that rumbles. The series is based on a love triangle between Tenma Tsukamoto(not-so-smart girl next-door type)who's in love (past the point of freaking out, which she does a lot) with Oji Karasuma (clueless boy next-door type) who would rather spend lunch with a plate of curry than a date. Last the bad-boy type Kenji Harima is hopelessly in love with Tenma, she doesn't have a clue and misses the point many many many times.

This love triangle gets more complicated as other people and ridiculous situations become hopelessly entangled. It has some mild violence and minor swearing, I would rate it PG.",1212537600,6,655,4.900900900900901

8203775,5,B000S1KUN8,I was already a fan of School Rumble before it came to the states. I must say that this is the only Anime that got me watching it so many times and it always cheer me up. This is a must buy if your are a fan of this series but if your a newcomer you will still enjoy it regardless. So go buy it.,1188604800,7,295,3.5538461538461537
