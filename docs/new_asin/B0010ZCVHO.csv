8239605,5,B0010ZCVHO,"When I decided to buy this DVD set I did a quick search online like I usually do to see if there were cheaper option. I did not find any. I purchased a used set for $84.98 because used was HALF the cost of new. When I received them I tried to play them. They hummed as if warped or out of balance and would not play. I looked at the box and saw the production company. I googled them and found out they are still in business and still sell the DVD sets.

Their price is $39.95 + $4.99 shipping and handling. PLUS you get a free book.

Brand new and half the cost of the used DVDs and from the production company which is a non-profit organization promoting religious education.

I can't rate the DVDs yet because I haven't watched it yet.",1390867200,2,745,4.117241379310345

8239608,5,B0010ZCVHO,"""Where Did the Bible Come From?"" is a three-disc documentary which reveals how the Christian Bible was created and how men such as ""reformation"" icons such Martin Luther, John Wycliffe, William Tyndale and John Calvin took it upon themselves, without authority of any kind, to rewrite the Latin Vulgate, which was used by the Roman Catholic Church for centuries, to suit their own beliefs.

The first disc deals with how the Old and New Testament writings were chosen from among hundreds of writings and codified by the Catholic Church.

The second disc deals with how the Bible is to be interpreted and the errors of Protestant interpretations.

The third disc is a lecture given by producer/host Michael Voris of St. Michael's Media and RealCatholicTV.com fame. Almost immediately, Voris makes a wager with the audience members that if any of them are able to logically refute any of his four propositions: the Catholic Church has never reversed or contradicted an infallible teaching once it has become infallible; one cannot have assurance of the truth of the Bible without accepting the authority of the Catholic Church; Sola Scriptura is a false teaching; and that the true Christianity of history is absolutely Catholic and absolutely not Protestant that he'll renounce his Catholic faith.

""Where Did the Bible Come From?"" is a ""Catholic"" documentary in the sense that it explores the history of the true Bible and the corrupted versions used by Protestant denominations and it shows how Baptists, Methodists and other Protestants, however unwittingly, following a deformed canon. The producers took the high road; there is no Protestant bashing here.

Newcomers to the Catholic faith, those who are interested in it or those who are simply interested in another viewpoint and ""cradle"" Catholics alike will enjoy ""Where Did the Bible Come From?""",1222905600,18,1853,5.183946488294314
