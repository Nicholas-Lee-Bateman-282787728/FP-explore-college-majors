7343015,5,B0125PSLI0,"Rodney and Colleen are an inspiration to practice with, their instructions are clear and the practice fluid.  By far the best instructors I have ever had. I recommend this video for the beginners and someone with an advanced practice.  Its one you can return to again and again.  A great addition to your home practice library.",1446595200,6,327,4.803571428571429
7343016,4,B0125PSLI0,"Loved it, always informative and enjoyable.  Great flow!!",1446249600,,57,6.125
7343017,2,B0125PSLI0,"Well I got this thinking it would help me relax, but the people doing the lessons moved from pose to pose much quicker than I imagined so it stressed me out. I was thinking they'd show you all the poses first and what they were called before jumping into the workout. So, unless you already know what a ""child's pose"" and ""downward dog"" and so on.are, you have to keep looking up at the screen to see where or what you should be doing. But, then maybe they think you'll eventually get them all down after doing the work outs repeatedly.",1469059200,,536,4.316831683168317
7343018,5,B0125PSLI0,"I have back and neck issues. If I do workout #1 at least once every 48 hours, my pain is greatly reduced. The second workout is great for my hubby who has shoulder issues.",1468281600,,171,4.0588235294117645
7343019,4,B0125PSLI0,Love her short power workouts!  I originally found them on Comcast's Gaiam TV.  They took them off channel so I bought this just to see if it was even close and it was.  It has the same sequences and it doesn't cost me $7/month!,1463788800,2,228,4.136363636363637
7343020,4,B0125PSLI0,Four separate 20 minute routines.  Comfortable and well led by Coleen. I love DVDs like this with multiple yoga sessions.  Good for time management.  You can always fit 20 minutes into the day.,1457395200,2,193,4.787878787878788
7343021,5,B0125PSLI0,Great instructional Dvd. I really enjoy the different routines. The true hidden gem is the routine you are able to download. I think this is the best of all of them.,1456617600,,165,4.354838709677419
7343022,5,B0125PSLI0,"This DVDs has routines taught by Coleen and Rodney. It is definitely not a beginner routine,  you need to be familiar with pose names and proper alignment,  but it has some lovely twists and stretches that just feel good for any level. It's calming and soothing and a nice add-on to another more vigorous workout.",1455580800,,313,4.672727272727273
7343023,3,B0125PSLI0,"I purchased this video from Walmart.  Last year, I took a yoga class and loved it.  So I wanted to learn the basics and practice at home.  When I found this video I was excited and knew that I definitely needed something for novices.  Well, much to my chagrin, I didn't last ten minutes with this video the first time.  It was just too fast.  The pacing wasn't exactly good for me to learn and/or become comfortable with the steps.  Although I think it is a purchase that I am going to stick with it.  I needed to YouTube some of the poses and get familiar with the terms.  Diving in to something too quickly is not a good way for beginners to learn.  I would recommend watching it first then practicing the steps to avoid the frustration I felt. But hey, I teach for a living so I do have biases.",1454716800,4,797,4.184210526315789
7343024,5,B0125PSLI0,"I have been looking for a video that was flow, not too long, and had good verbal cueing.  This is it.  Well done.
I am a relative beginner (I have gone to classes on and off for years) and wanted a way to incorporate more work at home.  I have used Yoga Journal's CD for many years - as you can imagine it becomes rather boring over and over again.  I have tried many other DVDs but their were either too long (I wanted a 30-ish flow), too easy (super beginner), or the verbal cues didn't flow nicely.

The only ""con"" with this video is that the camera is facing the instructor (you are the instructor's mirror) and the cues are as if you are sitting behind.  It would have been nice to have the instructor face a mirror to simulate what one would see in class.  The way I get around this (as it is a VERY common thing with workout videos) is to put my laptop facing the mirror at a slight angle.  That way what I see matches the verbal cues.

That is a very minor con in my book given all the other requirements I have are met.  Well done!",1452297600,11,1040,4.053921568627451
7343025,5,B0125PSLI0,"Flow Yoga with Colleen and Rodney Yee is simply the best. I have been practicing yoga for twenty years and found this DVD perfect for any level of practice. After a long day of work, I tell myself to put in the DVD and maybe I will do only one in the series of four, but the truth is that once you get started, you won't quit and before you know it, you will have a fabulous yoga session, which can and does turn your day around. I HIGHLY recommend this DVD for anyone interested in leading life to the fullest. You will never regret this purchase!",1450742400,5,548,4.130841121495327
7343026,5,B0125PSLI0,Best video ever. These two have a unique gift even through the screen of making you feel like they are right there with you. Their guidance is brilliant. This video in particular won't leave anyone behind. I highly recommend it if you want to feel good.,1447977600,2,253,4.521739130434782
8725467,1,B0125PSLI0,"I am a true beginner, only knowing the downward dog position. I was left in the dust from the beginning as we were told to take three breaths and I had only completed one before the frenzy began. I heard no description of the poses and I was constantly careening my neck toward the screen to figure out where I was supposed to be.  My husband tried along with me and we both ended up feeling lost.  Not a video for beginners like us.",1517443200,,433,4.142857142857143
8725468,4,B0125PSLI0,I haven't tried it yet. But I love it! It came on time and I hope Ill learn and lose some inches with this!,1516665600,,107,3.5
8725469,5,B0125PSLI0,She explains every move and pose as you are doing it. This is a wonderful bonus!,1508112000,,80,4.0625
8725470,5,B0125PSLI0,Nice short workouts. Good for the morning or winding down in the evening.,1507939200,,73,4.6923076923076925
8725471,5,B0125PSLI0,"A great guide to flow yoga, posture and general beginner level yoga. I have enjoyed immensely and will use in my wellness practice.",1491609600,,131,4.739130434782608
8725472,5,B0125PSLI0,"Easy to follow, well paced, and good instructors.  My mom also likes it, and she is 70.  Well done!",1490486400,,99,4.157894736842105
8725473,1,B0125PSLI0,"I've been practicing vinyasa flow yoga for 3 years at a local studio.  I do both regular flow classes and slow flow classes.  I like mixing it up.  I wanted a DVD that I could do at home in between studio visits and for about 20-30 minutes.  This seemed like the answer.  I didn't hesitate to buy it because I have several other Rodney Yee yoga DVDs which were my introduction to yoga.  I did those videos a lot during the beginning of my yoga journey, and they are all well executed and easy to follow.  I thought this one would be a good intermediate flow video; however, this DVD is a total miss.  I can keep up with all the routines at my studio but these ones are just too frenetic, too fast/too much, too many changes to even enjoy a breath while you're doing it.  I do yoga for stress release and relaxation, and also physical challenge, but I found the pace of the routines and the constant cuing to be stressful.  Also, I found the music to be annoying and not relaxing at all; it isn't your typical yoga music, it's more like synthesized elevator music.  The picture on the front of the DVD makes you think it's set in a pretty locale (as many of the Rodney Yee DVDs are) however it's actually in a room that's chintzy-decorated and kinda sad-looking.  Overall this DVD just felt like it was cheaply made and poorly executed.",1490054400,9,1335,4.338709677419355
8725474,2,B0125PSLI0,"I purchased this DVD as a way to continue my yoga practice on days where I am unable to make it to the local studio - I was disappointed when it lacked explanation of proper form, or detail for transitioning from one position to the next. Even though I am already familiar with most of the poses referenced, I had difficulty following along at this pace. There were multiple occasions where I had to stop the video and rewind to better understand what actions to take.  I think after a few viewings it will be a good supplement my local studio classes - but I would not recommend purchasing it as a way to learn yoga.",1478390400,,617,4.318965517241379
8725475,4,B0125PSLI0,Good variety of flow,1477440000,,20,4.25
8725476,5,B0125PSLI0,"Good workout and a nice flow.  It is a bit more advanced than I was expecting, but I can still do it with some modifications for an injury that I have right now.",1472947200,,161,3.878787878787879
