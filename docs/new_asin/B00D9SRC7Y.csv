5785713,1,B00D9SRC7Y,"Like others on here I could not watch these movies due to Region Code when I bought it I don't recall seeing anything about this. When I got this set I was sick & put them aside last night I finally opened it months later, Wife and I were going to watch Blu - Ray player said couldn't play this Region Code needless to say what I thought was a good buy turned out not to be not a happy camper. Buyer beware!! ",1513209600,,409,3.927710843373494

5785719,1,B00D9SRC7Y,"If you live in the US do NOT buy this!  I had to find out the hard way what a Region 2 film is.  It will not play in your DVD player here in America.  And if you open it and discover what a region 2 film is by figuring out that your DVD player won't play it then you void any hopes of a return.  So don't make the same mistake I did.  I have no clue why they would even be selling in the US a region 2 film but apparently they do.  So I guess if I move to a region 2 area then I can eventually play these movies.  Until then I guess they will just collect dust on my shelf.

Thanks!",1494806400,,582,3.5634920634920637

5785722,5,B00D9SRC7Y,The DVD or the blue ray are equally great. If by chance your player don't play because of a regional issue then it's time to get a multi region player. Check in to it and remember you get what you pay for. You buy cheap you get cheap. That's just the way it is. Regardless these movies are fantastic. Thanks Amazon,1494460800,,314,4.163934426229508
5785723,1,B00D9SRC7Y,"I returned the Boxset after I discovered that is was formatted for European DVDs and had to go back and purchase the DVDs separately, as this was a birthday gift.

5785747,3,B00D9SRC7Y,"This U.K. blu-ray trilogy by Sony pictures U.K.
is just a recycle of the 2010 blu-ray version of the film
Disc 1 is the 2010 blu-ray version of the Evil Dead which you can buy seperatly on amazon uk anyway & is ABC coded
plus has most of the special features carried over from the very old Anchor bay Ultimate dvd
except for Reunion panel & Ladies of the evil dead meet Bruce campbell
Disc 2 is Evil Dead 2 special edition which has exactly the same content as the U.S. Lionsgate blu-ray
the same HD transfer & the same special features as the U.S. Lionsgate blu-ray
SWALLOWED SOULS a 99min retrospect Documentary of the film made back in 2010-2011
interviews with almost everyone from the film including Bruce campbell, Sam raimi is the only person not interviewed
CABIN FEVER which is special make effects featurette with Greg nicotero-30mins
ROAD TO WADESBORO interview with Prop man Tony elwood who did the props on evil dead
there's also 2 Featurettes carried over from the old 2007 Anchor bay blu-ray
BEHIND THE SCREAMS & THE GORE THE MERRIER, plus the usual Theatrical trailer, Photo Galleries
and the old Anchor bay dvd commentary is also on this Disc
Disc 3 is Army of Darkness which only has Audio commentary & deleted scenes
i strongly suggest buying the scream factory Army of Darkness blu-ray
which has 3 Discs of 4 Different versions of the film plus a new 95mins retrospective Documentary MEDIEVAL TIMES
plus behind the scenes featurettes audio commentaries etc
so the 3 films in this boxset can easily be bought seperatly anyway
so 2-3stars for this boxset",1461024000,4,1572,4.72
