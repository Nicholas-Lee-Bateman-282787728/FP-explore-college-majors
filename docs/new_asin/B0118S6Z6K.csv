8723871,2,B0118S6Z6K,"This is the for the Alpha 2015 DVD release. Severely washed out print that is clearly dubbed from a VHS tape (you can see the tracking thru out the film). Terrible, terrible quality, at least transfer from a 16mm print directly rather than waste everyone's time. Gave two stars since you can still view it but you sure cannot tell it is Mary Pickford.",1508889600,,351,4.5
8723872,5,B0118S6Z6K,"Not the opera script point by point, but fascinating to see, and a good fit for Mary.  Later director Marshall ""Mickey"" Neilan makes a proper WASPy heel as Pinkerton.  Well worth a look, and a nice print.",1454284800,2,204,4.486486486486487
