6433719,5,B00KMFTN7E,It's great to see a movie go in the direction of real life - the director could have taken this film in a obvious and predictable path - instead you get a story of how the hand of life is really dealt -look forward to more from Matt Muir,1422921600,,237,3.857142857142857

6433721,4,B00KMFTN7E,"Attractively photographed and fascinating look at the music biz and the Austin scene.  The camera loves James Hand who could have a successful 2nd career as an actor with his expressive face and distinctive voice. It's nice that the film shows the range of music in Austin, but it would be good to have more than just an introduction to Hand's work as he is a genius songwriter and living legend of Texas honky-tonk. For more, check him out on web, Itunes and Youtube.",1418256000,,468,4.571428571428571
6433722,1,B00KMFTN7E,I grew up at the old home that  was used in the film and  wanted it just for family history's  sake. I was disappointed with the story line. It just wasn't exciting and the ending was a little flat. But I'm sure it was a good experience and I'm sure the next film will be better.,1413849600,,279,3.9464285714285716
8660001,5,B00KMFTN7E,"James Hand- 5 Stars for his role.
The Movie - 3.5 Stars The story should have been more about James and less about the character of his son and all his woes.
Soundtrack 2.5 Stars- There should have been a James Hand Album fir the Soundtrack

It was worth the money.
