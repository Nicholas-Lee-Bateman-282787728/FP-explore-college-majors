8338803,5,B001RTKKQ2,"This 2 DVD compilation, running over 7 hours, brings together some fascinating ideas about new technologies.  Of the ten 40-minute episodes here, three deal with transportation (cars, ships, flight).  Four deal with major issues in engineering: renewable energy, constructing intelligent buildings, purification of water (necessary in a world of rising population and limited resources), and surviving natural disasters.  But the most intriguing of all are the first three episodes, which survey an array of emerging technologies.  Although the treatment here is less detailed, the topics range from space exploration to more advanced medical services, such as specialized medical care making use of gene sequencing.  Most intriguing of all is the episode on artificial intelligence, which explores the growing capabilities of computers and ideas such as the eventual merger of human and machine intelligence.  This is a thought-provoking series.  Highly recommended.",1518825600,,967,5.864285714285714

More than any trade deficit this robot deficit and the more important idea deficit that it dramatizes should be a source of concern to modern Americans.

By watching this program, you get to see a lot of technology that really is mind blowing from personal jet packs to cars that drive under water to energy sources that don't wreak havoc on the environment.  This DVD is at one time a great example of gee whiz science and a resource manual for the types of projects we should be getting behind.

Throughout history true international power and influence have more often than not been led by societies who are on the cutting edge of emerging technologies and also by societies whose educational systems support such initiatives.  This is a sad thought to contemplate as the United States now observes its first year in over forty years without having a manned space vehicle.

Sadly, while the technology may change over the years, the lesson imparted doesn't seem to in that those who fail to learn from history are often forced to repeat it.",1268006400,3,1102,4.713541666666667
