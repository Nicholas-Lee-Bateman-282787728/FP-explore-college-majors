2520541,5,B000EHT5N2,"Saw this film few years ago..  Just like the title, this is pretty much the Korean version of ""american pie"" except it's 5 times funnier.  Hopefully nothing will be cut out of the US release.  Even All my Non-Korean friends still ask me to this day to let them borrow this movie again.  Highly recommend this movie",1142899200,13,314,4.456140350877193
2520591,5,B000EHT5N2,"This movie is really funny and will keep you busting out with laughter from start to finish. It is not for little kids due to some adult situations,but trust me if you like asian comedies with subtitles this is the one for you! I just seen part two Sex Is Zero 2 and i can't wait to add that one to my collection also,The second one is region 3 so i have to wait until a U.S region 1 version come out but when it dose i highly recommend both!!!",1351209600,,444,3.9444444444444446
2520592,4,B000EHT5N2,"This is brasher than American Pie by quite a ways.  It makes no apologies for offending you and likely will offend you in some way.  The kicker is that it does show the aftermath of easy sex and in a fairly human way.  Lim Chang-jung plays perhaps the single most addled brain person I have ever seen.  The mere fact that the character got into college is nearly beyond the suspension of disbelief. He then runs around treating himself like a loony toons cartoon character who will not die despite his lack of a single wit of common sense.

To reveal almost anything is to spoil the humor.  Several friends and I were watching this and loudly laugh and asking each other if we had seen that right.

The movie does shift to consequences.  The humor is still present but it does not shy away from the results of bad decisions.

Definitely, worth seeing once.",1349308800,,856,4.470967741935484

2520594,3,B000EHT5N2,"Maybe ""Sex Is Zero"" is a sarcastic way of saying ""Sex means nothing.""  However, I don't recall anywhere in which the title is explained.  If you liked ""Porky's"" or ""Revenge of the Nerds,"" then you might like this film.
I think we in the West have this image of the East as being sexually conservative, excluding the kama sutra, sex tourism, etc.  However, this is filled with the horniness that you could find in American sex comedies.  It has a gross-out humor aspect too.  Vomit, mastering one's domain, and all that type of stuff comes up here.
Some say the West is individual-oriented while the East is group-oriented.  While Western characters are often seen with friends, there sure was a way the the characters here seemed glued into groups.  Although the main characters were four guys and four girls, the eight people almost acted like four reincarnations of each other.
Like most sex comedies, there is far more female nudity than male, as opposed to having equal amounts of naughty bits.
Some of the humor I didn't get.  For example, one guy was trying to make a sick woman laughed and he did something that I thought would suffocate him.  There's a lot of eating or drinking things that one shouldn't do; I wonder if that's a culture-specific laughfest.
I also think all the Western guys that just love, love, love them some naked East Asian chicks will enjoy this.  I don't recall ""The Joy Luck Club"" showing any nudity, but this film does.",1260835200,3,1453,4.68503937007874
2520595,3,B000EHT5N2,"If you like teen targeted films with a lot of sexual humor, this film is probably perfect for you. It's funny... but not laugh my pants off funny. Its storyline isn't too bad. On a scale of 1-10, I would give it a 7. It's not a must see. But if you're into asian films and sexual humor you would be wrong to pass this movie up.",1193529600,2,327,3.8955223880597014
2520596,5,B000EHT5N2,"I grew up watching teen films like Fast Times at Ridgemont High and Porky's, and those are two reference points of partying, raunchy teen flicks.  American Pie throw in male bodily fluids in the formula.  Now, from South Korea, comes Saekjeuk Shigong, which combines elements of those movies, and it's quite enjoyable.

One can see the influence of Fast Times from the opening sequence using the Go-Go's ""We Got The Beat,"" albeit in an abbreviated version; it features a host of hotties doing an aerobics workout, while the first year college students are undergoing a gnarly initation ceremony.

One of them is inept Jang Eun-shik, recently having finished his military service, who's often at the receiving end of an accident that lands him in the hospital or leads him to jump out of windows.  He's also in Songgchuk's martial arts club involved in spiritual concentration, which amounts to basically bashing each other on the heads with phony wooden sticks or doing silly stuff like doing a headstand in a bowl of water.  His three roommates are the goofy Changsu, an unnamed nerdy bushy-haired guy--these two seem to do nothing but watch porn on their computer--and a sissy boy, Taehak, who's not too athletic.  When he sees a mouse, what does he do like a girl? Yup, you guessed it!

As for male bodily fluids, there's a funny one involving said fluid, some rat poison, a sandwich, and Eun-shik accidentally eating it.  That leads to a hilarious chase scene where his roommates try to catch him so he can spit it out.

Eun-shik falls head over heels with Lee Eun-hyo, a willowy beauty who's an aerobics star and sub on the national team.  When he casually tries to steal looks at her, she twigs on, and suddenly, spreads and opens her legs quickly, causing him to spit rice.  Her girlfriends are a funny lot, too, including the short-haired Kyoungiu, self-conscious about her breasts who is told, ""if someone put two raisins on your back, no one would know the deifference between your chest and your back--but eager to score.  After a night at a club, Eun-hyo's friends end up with each of Eun-shik's roommates, with hilarious results.  For a grossout scene, one of them who has drunken a lot makes some really horrendous barfing noises, spewing Linda Blair-like at one point, then gives bushy-hair a sloppy barf-laden kiss.  Charming, huh?  Poor Kyoungiu ends up with the unassertive Taehak with hilarious results.

There's the aerobics prima donna, a pretty but stuck-up girl named Ji-Won, who's dating the hunk Han Sangwook; there are some steamy scenes between them.  Things heat up when Sangwook dumps her in favour of Eun-hyo.  However, he's quite a cad and when he gets Eun-hyo pregnant, leaves her high and dry, kind of like Mike Damone and Stacy Hamilton in Ridgemont High.  While the topic was superficially done in RH, Eun-Hyo angrily tells Han when he seems casual about it, ""You and I both have birthdays, but this baby is never going to have one!  It's just waiting to die!""  It veers into drama at this point, when Eun-shik nurses Eun-hyo, trying to cheer her up with his exercise routines.  Although a goofball, he proves to be actually very caring and devoted, with Bread's ""If"" used as the love theme in this scene.

Then there are two thieves, one with a Moe Howard-like haircut, who end up trying to hard to avoid discovery and end up becoming voyeurs, playing uno, and I DON'T mean the card game.

Yes, the intense drama part is quite a change from the earlier silly raunchiness, but it's a comedy with some heart in it, saved by the aerobics competition set to some snazzy techno music, really well choreographed.  And yes, the two thieves are right there doing that crazy hand jive at one point.  Heck, all the hot actresses in there are enough to make anyone do that!",1190419200,4,3798,4.758778625954198
2520597,5,B000EHT5N2,I got this video today and was excited to watch it.  this movie was a hilarious korean sex comedy!  I didn't get bored throughout the whole movie.  this is a must watch movie!,1187913600,5,175,4.242424242424242
2520598,1,B000EHT5N2,This movie was extremely disturbing.  It made me want to stay as far away from Korea as possible.,1178582400,4,97,4.388888888888889
2520599,5,B000EHT5N2,"I watched Sex is Zero again last night and remember how good it was,

with all the awful comedies coming out of Hollywood right now, this is

a breath of fresh air. I remember the first thing I heard from this

movie was that it was the Korea's American Pie, but for my taste Sex

is Zero is much better. You get all gags a sex comedy should have plus

more. If you are a fan of Asian Cinema you know they like to throw

dramatic twists even in comedies and Sex is Zero is not the exception.

For example, let's say the do an Action comedy in Hong Kong like Rush

Hour, near the end one of the 2 main characters is going to die, that

throws a punch to the viewer out of nowhere, some people hate that and

others like me love it, enough of Hollywood endings. Not that I'm

saying anybody dies in this movie, this one is a Sex Comedy, not and

Action movie.

Ha Ji Won plays the lead female character, she is a sweetheart, before

watching this I saw her in a Horror movie called Nightmare, she is my

favorite Korean actress, last movie I saw her in is Duelist, you

should look for that movie too, is one of the best pieces of

cinematography I've ever seen.

Im Chang Jung plays the lead male character and he does a great job,

the guy is really funny and also shows he can act when he has to.

I got both the Korean DVD and the US DVD, both are great, but I got

the US DVD because the extra material comes also with subtitles, one

thing that the Korean release doesn't have, plus it also has a very

entertaining commentary track by mrskin, he had a lot to comment since

they didn't went shy on the nudity factor. Hope they keep releasing

Korean movies with this quality in the US.

So don't wait until Sex is Zero is remake by some money hungry studio,

do yourself a favor and watch it now, you won't be disappointed.",1147910400,5,1828,4.104815864022663
2520600,3,B000EHT5N2,"Hilarious Korean sex comedy that's often compared to American Pie, Porky's, and other films of that ilk in its approach to sex, except that this one ventures into the aftermath and potential consequences.

My main gripe with this DVD is that while the Amazon description says that the disc is widescreen, it's actually presented in letterbox format (with black bars). That might not be an issue for most people, but it's a pain for those of us with widescreen TVs ... especially considering that all releases of this film outside the US are anamorphic widescreen. I'm also disappointed in the choice of ""Mr. Skin"" to do the audio commentary, as he seems more interested in ogling the actresses, putting down the male characters, and discussing other films than saying anything worthwhile about the film at hand. Fortunately, Matt Kennedy of Panik House chimes in occasionally on the commentary with cultural notes on Korea and Asian cinema. On a positive note, the included special features are impressive, and Panik House was kind enough to include a free Sex Is Zero sticker(!)

So overall, great film for those who enjoy raunchy sex comedies and don't mind a little dose of pathos. Not so great disc for owners of widescreen TVs or fans of enlightening commentary tracks.",1144972800,6,1274,4.9485981308411215

8110165,3,B000EHT5N2,"This is a story of four nerdy guys wanting to score, being conned into joining the college gymnastics team. There is also an older guy involved. The film is a series of college antics gone bad, typically centering on one guy going to the hospital. For some reason they couldn't leave a decent comedy alone and they inject a tragedy into the script with the end being contrasting scenes of comedy and tragedy, putting a wet blanket on everything. It's all fun and games until...

8110168,5,B000EHT5N2,"I knew this korean movie from one of my friends, I watched it all through the internet after downloading the film.

I liked it because it talks about a sensitive issue relates to every girl especially in asia, how conservative family that strict girls to be careful in their relationship with the other sex.

I dislike really the situation of a girl when she is being careless about the society norms, and family ethics regarding this issue and not paying attention of what family advised. Which made her be in trouble and later understanding the false behind what she did.

I liked the idea but I felt sorry for the actress and I felt like there are still some good men out there taking care of a girl. Life still have peace. Anyway I recommend it to +18 above to watch.",1371945600,,771,4.453900709219858
