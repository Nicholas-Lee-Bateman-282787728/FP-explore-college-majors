7380850,1,B0141L8UQY,"I really hate to say it... but this is a terrible movie that is actually painful to watch. I'm a fan of the actress that plays the main character, and I know she can be amazingly funny. However, this movie isn't... and neither is the main character. Anytime there was going to be a meaningful moment, it was ruined.  None of the characters were believable....",1481500800,,359,4.523076923076923
7380851,5,B0141L8UQY,Loved it!!!! Definitely one of my fav movies!,1465257600,,45,4.75
7380852,5,B0141L8UQY,"Reminds me of ""Porky's""...so many unforgettable scenes.",1459555200,,55,7.0
7380853,1,B0141L8UQY,"It was just flat out bad. Did not really have a plot, and then did not have any nudity to make up for it.",1454544000,2,105,3.4166666666666665
7380854,1,B0141L8UQY,Just because she's a virgin doesn't actually mean she is not qualified to teach sex ed.  Her problem is that she didn't do any preparation for her class at all.  What she did well was related to her students and care about their lives.  I personally wouldn't want to sleep with anybody at the school.  Stupid flat character like the bulimic janitor wasn't really funny at all but they kept doing that same joke over and over again.,1451865600,,431,4.487179487179487
7380855,2,B0141L8UQY,"Some funny moments, but, overall, not too entertaining.",1447632000,,55,6.0
7380856,3,B0141L8UQY,"2.5 stars at best...with the Beginner's Guide to Sex (BGS), you get basically what you'd expect from characters with names such as Principal Hyman (Tom Arnold), Coach Bush (Lucius Baston), Roberta the Squirter (Danie Coleman), and Marci Cox (Jackie Moore). I was more annoyed than amused for the first half but kept watching because Whitney Moore made the most of her role as the 30-year-old virgin Sex Ed teacher, Laci Cox. Hmm, writing this got me wondering if Jackie Moore is Whitney Moore's sister (Marci Cox is sister to Laci Cox in the movie).

BGS is juvenile to the point of being idiotic, yet somehow you don't necessarily need to be an idiot to savor this kind of stupidity (or I could just be an idiot and not know it). Featuring students who jump off buildings competitively (is that a thing IRL?) and truly slimy school faculty and staff, BGS is surely beyond the pale and barely tethered to reality, with characters mostly being caricatures of themselves. It takes a minute to realize that Whitney Moore is not overacting, but rather playing the role flawlessly to fit the tude of the flick.

If you can make it thru the first half, the second is better. The gay Coach Bush is a pleasantly surprising role not only because the script successfully walks the fine line between fun and denigration, but also because Lucius Baston excels at bringing his character to life. Other than Baston, the true talent on display is that of Whitney Moore (which is a relief considering that she is the protagonist). The other actors are hit or miss; I would say breakout roles for some, except that they probably don't want to be too much associated with BGS in the future.

Final verdict: I'd wager the actors had a better time making this than we get in watching it. Proceed at your own risk.",1445644800,8,1793,4.667721518987341
7380857,5,B0141L8UQY,This movie is a hidden treasure.  I would be shocked if this doesn't launch careers for the director and the cast.,1445299200,4,114,4.428571428571429
8729302,1,B0141L8UQY,this is unwatchable,1528588800,,19,5.666666666666667
8729303,4,B0141L8UQY,"I liked it very cute sex oriented movie,with only 3 pairs of boobs keeping me rewinding but I would have liked it even if it had no
nudity",1524355200,,138,3.9642857142857144
8729304,2,B0141L8UQY,Very slow and not all that......plus not much in the way of T and A,1503964800,,67,3.533333333333333
8729305,1,B0141L8UQY,"One of the worst movies ever made with dialogue that sounds like it was written by a teenage boy in puberty. Tom Arnold must really need the money to have done such a dumb, trashy movie because he can't get much lower than this or he has no respect for himself or both. Very few laughs with no point to it. Don't waste your time because it's time you can't get back. Surprising that this movie was able to even get made it's that bad.",1501372800,,434,4.117647058823529
8729306,2,B0141L8UQY,"I saw this on TV. I thought it would be one of those crazy teen sex comedies with some nudity but sadly it was not. Seemed more of a DRAMA than a comedy maybe 2 or 3 laughs that's about it. Some reviewers compared this movie to Porky's and Not Another Teen Movie, I don't know where they got that idea from because those were actually good raunchy comdies. This movie is crap. Mixing zany characters with dark subject matter does not make a good film. Basic plot is girl gets pregnant and the dude wants to punch her in the stomach to kill the baby with a few attempts at humor. Gave 2 stars because it was at least watchable to the end. Rent it if you must but I definitely wouldn't buy it.",1500940800,,691,4.125925925925926
8729307,5,B0141L8UQY,"great product, great service",1500163200,,28,6.25
8729308,4,B0141L8UQY,"After reading the title, I went into this expecting Schindlers List or a least a deep moral lesson about how transgenders should be able to pee in whatever bathroom they want or learn how bad Trumph is as president. Instead all I did is laugh allot at how over the top the sexual humor was. How dare they do that. So I gave it one star off because it didn't make me cry or ponder my existence but only grin and laugh.",1496016000,,417,4.097560975609756
8729309,3,B0141L8UQY,"It takes a certain kind of movie to keep you from turning off the TV at 3am and this is that kind of movie. I had never heard of it but I flipped past it on cable and the Jump Club scene stopped me in my tracks. It is FILTHY. It is RIDICULOUS. It is in the vein of the ""Not Another Teen Movie"" series but I found it much more endearing. A day later, and I still can't stop talking about it.",1495929600,,390,3.710843373493976
8729310,1,B0141L8UQY,Shame on you Tom Arnold to be in such trash. Filthy language. Turned it off.,1485388800,,76,4.133333333333334
8729311,4,B0141L8UQY,This comedy falls in the same genre as Napoleon dynamite it's offbeat but really good... Just have to have an odd sense of humor to enjoy this movie straight edge people won't get it Lacey Cox is hot !!I didn't pay attention to this movie the first 10 times I watched it that way I could go back and watch it 10 more times awesome..!!!!,1483574400,,336,4.184615384615385
