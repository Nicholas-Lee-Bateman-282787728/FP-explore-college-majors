8643335,4,B00IMG1IV4,"Zoe (Amanda Adrienne) is a deaf girl who inherits a GTO from her father. She is obsessed with selfies and her cell phone camera. She travels out west to see her boyfriend when she runs into a group of western ""yahoos"" who hunt Native Americans. She becomes their prisoner. Using the pictures she sent him, her boyfriend (Marc Anthony Samuel) retraces her steps in an attempt to locate her.

The film turns into a very different ""I Spit on Your Grave."" The film includes an interesting ""tug-o-war"" with a man's intestines.

Well done, well written indie horror/slasher/revenge film for those who like that type of movie.",1427414400,,619,4.830188679245283
