569336,4,6303141978,"Warning: possible spoilers.

Two brothers who grew up raised by a single mom and their grandmother (Sean Penn playing Brad Jr. and Chris Penn his brother Tommy) are excited when their estranged and notorious father (Christopher Walken's Brad Sr.) suddenly reenters their lives.  He's a slick and charming criminal with a fast car, an impressively shiny gun and a smile that could light up a pitch black room.  He's one of those fellows who could probably sell venom to a rattlesnake and he seduces his boys (especially the older one played by Sean Penn) into a life of crime.  But when Walken discovers that a grand jury has been convened to look into his activities he can't trust that Sean Penn and his friends will keep their traps shut so he kills them off one by one and buries the bodies.

The thing is Sean Penn's friends don't even know much of anything incriminating about Brad Sr.'s operations and they never worked with his actual crew.  All they did was steal tractors for their buddy Brad Jr. and unload them to Brad Sr.--but that's more than enough to earn them a death sentence from the ruthless and conscience free Brad Sr.  The only one who knows anything truly incriminating about Christopher Walken's Brad Sr. is the eldest son played by Sean Penn who witnessed pop cooly oversee the murder of a suspected snitch in one of the film's more chilling scenes.  But even Brad Sr.'s own flesh and blood aren't exempt when it comes to permanently eliminating witnesses who could potentially send him to jail.

Christopher Walken gives easily one of the finest performances of his career as Brad Sr. and is so good it makes you realize what a shame it is that Walken doesn't do serious acting anymore.  He's charming and charismatic enough that you can see how almost anybody would be taken in by him, including his sons and briefly their mom--all of Brad Jr.'s friends willingly walk off with Brad Sr. and his crew to their deaths, never suspecting a thing.  But Walken's charming outlaw also has a terrifying and ruthless side that people don't tend to see until it's too late.  Walken is a genuine marvel as Frank Sr.--the scene where he tries to manipulate a justifiably murderous Sean Penn out of killing him is pretty amazing.  At Close Range is worth watching just for the chance to see what an actor Christopher Walken was in his prime.

Director James Foley was always good with actors except when he was hit with the curse of Madonna and directed her dreadful screwball comedy Who's That Girl.  For more on the curse of Madonna you can also check out Shanghai Surprise (the film that killed Handmade Pictures); Dangerous Game (then hot director Abel Ferrara's career never really recovered from that one); The Next Big Thing (which destroyed all the Hollywood career momentum Rupert Everett earned from My Best Friend's Wedding overnight) and Swept Away, which nearly derailed the career of then-husband and at the time lightning hot director Guy Ritchie.

For such an obviously talented director James Foley has had a surprisingly undistinguished career (his latest film was Fifty Shades Darker which pretty much everyone agreed was better than the previous film, but still...)  His one undisputed masterpiece is Glengarry Glenn Ross.  He's also arguably the filmmaker most responsible for Mark Wahlberg's film career, having shown that the then minor rapper and pop star could act by directing him in the underrated thriller Fear.

But At Close Range might be the closest Foley came to directing a great film other than Glengarry Glenn Ross.  He gets strong performances from everyone in his cast.  Christopher Walken is mesmerizing.  Crispin Glover and Chris Penn have much smaller parts but are used perfectly.  Mary Stuart Masterson is sweet and heartbreaking as Sean Penn's naive underage girlfriend--the words ""I forgot to feed the dog"" haunted me for weeks when I was young and originally saw At Close Range in a theater.  Unfortunately, it isn't quite a perfect movie.  The musical score by pop producer Patrick Leonard is way too repetitive.  Madonna's closing credits song Live to Tell, while classier than anything else she had done at the time (or pretty much anything she's done since for that matter) has lyrics that are way too on the nose.  Sean Penn is also allowed to overact in one or two scenes--most unfortunately in his final one.

Despite the fact that it isn't quite a great movie At Close Range is still a very good one, a grim and powerful true crime drama that feels a little dated but still manages to pack a surprising dramatic wallop.",1493510400,,4586,4.822477650063857
569337,5,6303141978,"This one is dynamite. Walken is superb and steals every scene and tractor that he's in. Obviously an Oscar winner and crime film legend. See also King of New York, True Romance, and Kill the Irishman. An unbelievably but still nonfiction account of a killing spree by the most notorious gang in that state. Sean Penn does a good job of playing a tough but not bright son of Walken. Yet his character manages to make it to the end. A very sad yet thrilling tale and a must own.",1493424000,,476,4.3

The story is slightly cliched and would have been better had there been more explanation of their backgrounds and how their relationship came to be as convoluted as it was, but it made linear sense.  The story was just a bit too thin.  Women suffered in silence and Men acted with impunity, in this story about criminality that was passed between a father and a son in rural Pennsylvania in the 1970's.  The story is broad and full of holes, but Penn was believable and Walken was his best creepy social deviant.

Watching this excellent cast when they were 30 years younger was fascinating. The acting and directing were first rate and the fact that this was based on a true story made it even more interesting.

Intense from the 'GET' with these two young boys (you won't BELIEVE how young and almost child-like Penn is) - it starts like a lark in the country - an estranged and charming (yes he was -) dad and a young, frustrated and ambitious young buck son.

He has to be one of the top 5 scariest villains in film history in this movie. The rest of the cast is stellar as well. Very dark and brutal story that happens to be a true one.

Twilight is doing their customary 3000 units so don't wait forever to get it (it may in time turn up on another label).  Penn, Walken, Glover, Penn (Chris), Walters, Masterson, etc., are all on form.  Can't wait.  Thanks Twilight Time!",1439856000,3,591,4.679611650485437

So I searched online , most of the time it was a gamble if it would be in stock , finally I found it. This movie is one of my absolute favorites in my life as I had watched it when I was a teenager and it had always stuck with me. I see the negative reviews and people don't understand the mindset and the correlation of the raw impact. This movie is very personal to me and I finally just watched it again after being lucky enough to find it through you. I'm super happy and the DVD was in fantastic condition . Awesome .

Christopher Walken (One of my fave actors of all time!) is perfect as the slimy/evil father who without compulsion first rapes his son's girlfriend, and then orders the murder of the girlfriend and his own son. Sean Penn also is amazing as the son who wants badly to emulate his 'Crime Lord' father, but after the ultimate betrayal turns on him.

I found it hilarious how buff Sean Penn thinks he is in this movie. Also memorable was the scene where he takes a shower with a garden hose while being covered in bullet holes (all while some kind of classical/80s music mashup is playing in the back round.

I'd say it's worth a watch because any shortcomings are made up by 80s magic and the chance to see two well known actors in their early years.",1412121600,,539,4.223300970873787

I believe this is the movie that ""really"" put Shawn Penn on the ""Hollywoods radar"" as a superb actor. His performance is fantastic.

Excellent  performances by very a youthful Sean Penn and a dangerously sexy crazy looking and speaking Christopher Walken.  It is difficult to realize that this very brutal tale about a father and his off-spring is a true story. One has to wonder if their mother knew about the criminals with whom her sons were associating.  The way that women are portrayed in this movie is ignorant.

572118,5,6303141978,"[Rounded up from 4-1/2 stars] Admittedly, with its high chill factor, this one is sometimes hard to watch and not for all tastes, but then what movie really is?  This undeservedly overlooked (by the Oscars), still emotionally overwhelming, and potent little film, reportedly based on a true story, covers the entire spectrum of familial morality.  Sean Penn (""Brad Jr."") and Christopher Walken (""Brad Sr."") deliver Oscar-level performances, seemingly elevating each other, creating their own Hollywood blueprint on how great acting is done.  Few characters in cinematic history have run the gamut of emotions that Penn's Brad Jr. does here, and Walken is unarguably one of the scariest characters you'll ever see on screen (and that includes the horror-movie genre).  Brad Jr.'s parents are divorced, and he and his younger half-brother ""Tommy"" (the late Christopher Penn, Penn's real-life little brother, who's also in top form) must decide between their estranged Dad's morally questionable but monetarily tempting lifestyle (organized crime), and their Mom's less-than-perfect and melancholy but nevertheless generally safe home.  Are there conditions when it comes to their loyalty to their Dad, or will it be futile to resist their Dad's influence under any circumstances, whatever they may be?  The basis of the movie, ironically, is their Dad confronting the same questions about his sons.  Throw in the rest of the A-list cast, including Mary Stuart Masterson (as Brad Jr.'s girlfriend ""Terry,"" her career-best performance), Kiefer Sutherland (TV's ""24,"" but if you blink, you may miss him), Crispin Glover (""Back to the Future""), and a cameo appearance by Alan Autry (""Bubba"" from TV's ""In the Heat of the Night""), along with a perfectly haunting score by Madonna (the movie's theme song ""Live to Tell"" topped the charts), and you have a gripping, suspenseful, effective powerhouse that will very likely exceed your expectations.",1404691200,,1938,5.4186046511627906

Walken is spectacular.  And spectacularly monstrous.

Juvenile delinquent Brad Whitewood, Jr. (Penn) knows about petty theft, but he wants big money enough to blow the lid off his boring life, enough to get out of town and to find his ol' man (Walken).

He wants to be like his dad, a big-time thief, who knows ""the business."" Seductive and sinister, Brad's father is full of toxic wisdom that makes his illicit life appear eerily sexy, but when Brad witnesses his father deliberately killing someone, he realizes he may not only be in over his head he may also lose it for good.

He even dressed like a guy his character's age from Tennessee. I thought the grandmother did a fantastic job of showing the how such folks show affection when the girlfriend was raped by the dad. She was stone faced. But just the touching of the girl's arm showed she has compassion and a heart. It was not overly done with close up camera shots or anything. Very good writing and acting. It shows you how even small rural America has its gangs and mobs too.

572712,5,6303141978,"Director James Foley probably didn't have to try too hard with this grim, all too real slice of life starring Sean Penn (Bruce Whitewood Jr.) and Christopher Walken (Brad Whitewood Sr.).

Taking place in an impoverished small town in the center of Nowheresville, a hopeless little plot of land populated with drifters, aimless young men like Bruce (a young, built Sean Penn) and his slightly punchy young brother Tommy played by the late Chris Penn with an innocence and skill that makes his early death all that much more tragic.

In exactly 111 minutes Christopher Walken shows us what evil men look like in real life.  And how boring, empty, and absolutely dangerous they are.  From his arrival on the scene, green eyes snapping back and forth like some hungry lizard looking for the next fly he intends to digest with one flicker of his forked tongue, there is not a second that one can doubt we are looking at Satan himself--and surprisingly enough, he's driven by a lot of the same motives we are.

Mary Stuart Masterson symbolizes the will to transcend her modest surroundings as Terry, a nice and idealistic young girl Bruce falls in love with.  Though this is an adolescent romance, there is more of a strength and maturity to it because it is born in poverty and hardship and is not a luxurious middle class game of playing house.  Bruce is of course the bad boy from a family married to crime--what struck me about the film is how passive the mother is, simply ironing the clothes and chain smoking while her sons become enamored of Old Dad, who she knows is Beelzebub himself.  She doesn't really do anything except give passively angry looks at Walken and play bingo.

With no prospects of moving ahead or doing anything with his life whatsoever, Bruce falls under the spell of his father--magnetic, dangerous, lawless and without care for the next day (as long as the stolen tractors, wine, etc pay the bills).  He learns quickly though that Dad is not just some mischevious thief, not a free spirit, when he witnesses the murder of one of his fallen comrades who fell in cahoots with the police.

This is when the trouble starts.  Bruce no longer wants anything to do with his father or his backwoods gang of psychopathic hillbillies.  Just like a deep sea predator, there is a unforgettable scene in which Bruce takes Tommy from the county fair to a wooded area and, surrounded by darkness, tells him an inverse sort of anti-parable about coyotes out in the west.  His eyes flicker with a demonic emptiness, a secret joy in the boy's fear, right before he does away with him and we hear the scream of a coyote.

While the ending is a little unrealistic--I don't think getting shot nine times allows one the physical freedom Sean Penn as he confronts the Old Man--it serves as a definite period, a definite final verdict on the elder  Bruce, as though we totally needed one.  The guy has had all his friends killed, tried to have him killed, and when confronted by all this his response is: ""Well, I bought you a car and took ya in.  Doesn't that mean something'?""  Younger Bruce has nothing to contend with except a dangerous animal lacking in conscience or anything else, and that's his own father.

Crispin Glover really should get more career breaks.  He is such a naturally diseased and frightening eccentric that I think he's owed more credit then he's gotten.  His short time in this film sort of proves it.  A magnificent movie that also reminds us of our obligation toward the very real flesh and blood human beings who we like to laugh at when they are exploited on shows like ""Jerry Springer",1277596800,,3617,4.65251572327044

572838,4,6303141978,"Based on true events that occurred in Pennsylvania in the 1970s, At Close Range stars Oscar-winner Christopher Walken (Best Supporting Actor,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Deer-Hunter-Universal-Legacy-Series/dp/B000AABCU2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Deer Hunter (Universal Legacy Series)</a>) and two-time Oscar winner Sean Penn (Best Actor,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mystic-River-Widescreen-Edition/dp/B0001ZX0OW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mystic River (Widescreen Edition)</a>&nbsp;&<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Milk/dp/B001QUF3SW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Milk</a>), a mere three years after his star-making performance as stoner, Jeff Spicoli. Released in 1985, it was likely the father-son dynamic (almost Shakespearean in scope) of the real events that appealed to Hollywood screenwriters. It certainly wasn't the happy ending.

Penn plays Brad Whitewood Jr., a jobless teenager living with his grandmother (played by Penn's real-life mother Eileen Ryan), brother Tommy (real-life brother, the late Christopher Penn), and mother. As evidenced in the opening scenes, when Brad hangs onto the hood of a speeding car, Brad is looking for something exciting in any possible form. A budding relationship with farm girl Terry (Mary Stuart Masterson) is a start, but it is Brad's father, Brad Sr. (Walken), re-entering his life that provides him with the jolt he's been looking for. Brad Sr. is a complete snake; a career thief, simultaneously charming and psychopathic. Soon, Brad Jr. begins working alongside his father before finding himself in much deeper than he expected. Crispin Glover and Kiefer Sutherland co-star as two of Brad Junior's loser associates.

While billed as a ""thriller,"" the film is much more of a ""human drama."" The characters, despite being based on real people, don't feel one-hundred percent real, but they're not caricatures either. It is the characters and the way they are portrayed that really carries the film, not the plot. A film with a storyline this familiar can hardly be called ""thrilling.""

Sean Penn is brilliant, in a performance that is much more subtle than the bravado he displayed in his Oscar-winning roles. It's a quietly moving performance that is just as rewarding as those performances were.

Walken delivers one of the greatest performances of his career, balancing both charisma and terror in a way few actors could. He completely embodies the character, making every aspect of Brad Sr. believable. It's chilling and equals the intensity of his Oscar-winning performance in The Deer Hunter. Undoubtedly, Oscar-worthy work here.

My two biggest issues with the film are the musical score and the final shot. The score makes the film feel more dated than it would be without it and it's also somewhat repetitive. The final shot is a freeze-frame effect that has been a cinematic clich since Truffaut's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-400-Blows-Criterion-Collection/dp/B000E5LEV0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The 400 Blows - Criterion Collection</a>&nbsp;originated it.

Excluding that shot and the preceding courtroom scene, the last few minutes of the film are the most powerful, due to the searing on-screen intensity of Penn and Walken. The film seems to be heading towards an inevitable conclusion, but throws the audience a curveball and manages to achieve a sort of emotional poignancy. In terms of story and substance, At Close Range is nothing special or profound. It's certainly not perfect, but these last ten minutes are taut, suspenseful, and very powerful. The kitchen scene with Penn and Walken is one of the finest examples of intense acting, something I believe few would argue.

Though it's not immediately apparent, At Close Range is a powerful, performance-driven human drama. It's no masterpiece, but worth seeking out.

572841,5,6303141978,"""At Close Range"" is a classic example of a movie in which all aspects of the filmmaker's art shine; if it isn't already, it should be required viewing for students in film schools. First of all, the Kazan script, which details the growing into manhood of the Sean Penn character, skillfully combines the luridly violent with the ultimately noble, its resolution having Penn, without his becoming a goody two-shoes, credibly endorse the virtues of the civilized over the flashy and brutish.

The color photography, unexpected in a neo-noir film, works remarkably well as it turns out, being consistently beautiful (in the rural landscapes) and imaginative (for example, in its scenes of the gang members marching single file, silhouetted against a dusky sky.) Each image in the film appears to have been composed with great aesthetic care, reminding this viewer of the directorial art of such a master as William Wyler.

The acting in this movie can't be praised highly enough. Christopher Walken, always good as a villian with a sarcastic bent, here outdoes himself as a self-centered father, doing evil not for its own sake, but for HIS own sake. As his initially impressionable and then maturing son, Sean Penn combines a youth's brooding qualities with an astonishing ability as an adult male to scream and even cry on screen, becoming intensely moving in such moments.

As earlier reviewers have insisted, this film deserves to be far better known.",1213401600,5,1452,5.066945606694561
572842,5,6303141978,"Somehow this movie vanished without a trace when in came out c.'86, but in my years as a video store clerk in that bygone epoch, whenever i recommended it to customers, they thanked me profusely. This slice of no-hope rural oedipal noir was based on a true story. Sean Penn, barely out of his teens and incendiary, is a bored teen in small-town, depressed Pennsylvania farm country, living with his indolent mom and younger bro (played by real-life bro, the late, lamented Chris Penn). Bored out of his skull, with no prospects, Sean is tantalized by fleeting glimpses of his dad, who abandoned him back in toddlerhood, but who periodically stops by to dispense wads of cash to his estranged wife, keeping contact with his son to a minimum.  Dad, as is evident by his clothes, the cash, his swagger and his car, is some kind of rural bandit. And he is played by Christopher Walken, to the absolute hilt, in one of the most menacing, hilarious, kitsch-free depictions of villainy I have ever seen. The narrative proper gets going when Walken takes a fancy to his forgotten son, to the point where he initiates him into his criminal world (which seems to consist mostly of hijacking high-end farm equpiment and selling drugs).  Penn, thrilled at the money, excitement, and filial bonding, is swept up into dad's heady orbit...until it begins to dawn on him that there are worse things than being fatherless...like having a dad who is a predatory homicidal maniac.

Magnificent script by Nick Kazan, son of Elia, who in the late '80's early '90's specialized in literate, offbeat true crime stories like this, ""Reversal of Fortune,"" and ""Patty Hearst."" James Foley (""GlenGary Glen Ross"") directs beautifully, paying great attention to the no-hope depressed rural environment. Supporting performances are fabulous, from Tracy Walter's Walter Brennan-like gangster underling, to Crispin Glover and Chris Penn as the stoner kids who get carried away into a life of crime and pay a dear price, to the stunning Mary Stewart Masterson as Sean's tough-as-nails tomboy girlfriend.  Penn himself is his usual smoldering self, but it is Walken who makes this a must-see; too often self-parodic, here is is absolutely believable, from his cocksure swagger, to his peculiar but convincing Appalachian accent (""a little Elvis, a little Muhammed Ali,"" he explained in an interview), to his habit of smiling sweetly to himself when he kills people. The story of a man who discovers the joys of fatherhood belatedly, until it gets in the way of what really matters to him, the story of a fatherless boy whose belated reunion with his father goes from rapture to nightmare: this is not merely a true-crime movie, but an archtypal tragedy, and everyone involved should take a bow -- even Madonna, then in her Penn-days, who delivers a terrific title song with the downbeat ""Live to Tell.""",1212105600,6,2867,4.954261954261955

The saga of the Johnston gang, a ""family"" of burglars based in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania and reigned circa 1980 and then unfolded into murder happened while I was in high school.  The story got big play in the Philadelphia region and some national coverage.  Oddly enough this movie was filmed in Tennessee.  Also noteworthy is that when this film was released in 1986 it didn't even get a theatrical run in Philly.  I had to wait until it was released later that year on home video before I saw it.  Bear in mind that at the time Sean Penn was not the esteemed Academy award winning actor he is now but was better known as Madonna's husband.  Christopher Walken, despite the Oscar he won for ""The Deer Hunter"", was a marketing challenge for Hollywood.  As for the film itself, it perfectly captures the essence of the events and the place it occurred.  I worked near Lancaster County around that time and my late brother-in-law was from the area and came to Philly because the mills had closed there.

You can also imagine how someone like him would be drawn to a charismatic, albeit evil, father figure as assayed here by Walken.

There is also an excellent supporting cast here with Mary Stuart Masterson as Penn's innocent girlfriend, Chris Penn and Crispin Glover as Penn's buddies, and Tracey Walter as Walken's brother as standouts.

572956,5,6303141978,"""AT Close Range"" is without question, one of the finest movies that the 80s produced.

Sean Penn plays a young criminal, who runs into his big-time criminal father(Christopher Walken) and joins Walkens' band of misfits.  Along the way, Penn realizes what a terrible person his father is and tries to leave the gang.  Walken is not liking that idea and has a different plan for Penn, one which involves his lovely girlfriend, played by Mary Stuart Masterson.

Chris Penn is also in this movie and plays Sean Penn's younger brother(that must have been diffcult for him).

This movie is sooooo great, because of Walken.  His performance is undeniably creepy and overly effective.  His character is drunk and doped-up for the entire movie and is always hiding his ""evil"" side.  Walken is so capable of pulling this off, that it is impossible for me to even consider who else would have played this role had he not.

This movie is a little slow-moving, but that is simply to set the depressing, un-eventful daily life that takes place in this farm town this movie is set in.  It almost explains why Penn gets involved with his father's crew---shear boredom.

There is some humor in ths film, most of which is provided by a drunk Walken character, stumbling and rambling about life.

The best line is when Penn tells Walken that he no longer wants to work with him and Walken; in a typical Walken voice, utters ""Where ya gonna go...what'd ya gonna do....Food, clothes, pretty girl in your lap...you'll be crawling back to me; Daddy, Daddy, give me something""..I can rewind and watch that scene for hours.

This is truely a fantastic film and I highly recommend this one to anyone.  Not suitable for young children as there is a lot of violence and some killing.

573022,4,6303141978,"Let me first say that Sean Penn made this film. It certainly doesn't hurt when you add Chris Walken into the mix. But this movie had to be one of the weirdest, most bizarre films I've ever seen. Screen shots come and go seemingly without ryhme or reason. Dialogue is sometimes difficult to decipher - especially Walken's. Many scenes feel rushed. Sometimes you find yourself laughing when its really not a funny scene. But you can't help it, mainly because some of the scenes are just really friggin weird.

Once scene in particular deals with Crispin Glover, Keifer Sutherland, Mary Stuart Masterson, Sean Penn, Chris Penn(at about 1/2 his Resevoir Dogs size) and the imbecilic laughing horndog of a kid from Fright Night (Stephen Geoffreys). They're all out smoking hash by a lake. You see Masterson's character and Penn's character making out on a raft - and we also see Glover looking jealous - but we never find out why. This type of thing happens quite frequently. Many elements are never explained and many scenes make no sense - such as a scene when David Straithairn's (blind guy from Sneakers, abusive dad from Dolores Claiborne) character goes into an epileptic fit. I liked the scene, as it was well acted, it just doesn't make any sense.

You can quickly assert the campiness of this film and I now know why it's a ""pulp indie"" on IFC. I really liked the film, and to imagine the film without the senseless parts(which consumes about 50% of the movie) would be to disembowel it all altogether.

As for plot, a teen(Penn) just meets his father(Walken) for the first time, only, daddy's a full-time criminal who likes to steal tractors, boats, paintings, and occasionally off an former associate or two. He runs with a gang of heartless rednecks who also share in his malevolent ways. Dad thinks its time to bring in his boy but after his son watches his father and another man drown a former associate, the teen decides he wants out. Our protagonist decides he wants to take off with his girlfriend(Masterson) after being released from jail. Only......

I don't want to spoil it. But let's just say the final portion of the film isn't rushed and makes perfect sense. All in all, a worthwhile film. But don't be surprised if you find yourself questioning major portions of the screenplay and the annoying soundtrack that plays like a garage band at a funeral - in other words, it doesn't go with the movie at all, helping cumulate more and more oddities about the movie while making you laugh in perplexity.

""You'll come back, crawlin' back sayin' daddy daddy give me somethin."" and

""Whatever  I see that moves, has my name writ on it: Brad Whitewood, please hold for delivery.""or

  I could go on.  Kazan captures the vernacular of the mid-Atlantic Pennsylvanian perfectly.  And Walken sounds like he grew up there.

573027,5,6303141978,"""At Close Range"" is a film that, at the gut level, pursues its audience long after viewing. The brilliant manifestation of acting genius by Penn and Walken is only matched by the haunting realization of this ""true story."" Undoubtedly, that old saying that true-life is more compelling than fiction takes hold in this case. In all, ""At Close Range"" digs at the heart of its audience and, with as much attention to sincerity as Hollywood allows, surpasses the disconnect of reality and nightmare. (Something as equally interesting; Mary Stuart Masterson's character in the film was included on behalf of her real-life model Robin Miller--my aunt. The company producing the film was denied permission by my grandmother to use Robin's name, so Hollywood did what it does best--they changed names, capitalized on someone else's tragedy, and denied royalties to the victim's family. I would say, too, that there are only a handful of us who actually know the truer story behind this film, and it is viciously haunting.)",1082073600,3,1013,5.07185628742515
573028,5,6303141978,"Juvenile deliquent Brad Whitewood Jr ( Sean Penn), spends his time in a small town with his friends pulling off petty thefts for small time cash. However, Brad is getting sick of his boring life, and longs to make some serious money. Brad's father (Christopher Walken) is the leader of a serious gang of thieves. Brad has heard the rumors about his father, but never got a chance to know him. So he decides to leave his boring life behind, and sets out to find his father so that he can learn the tricks of the trade and become just like him. At first, Brad's father appears to be a good guy filled with plenty of wisdom and helpful hints on how to make it big. But when Brad witnesses his father intentionally kill someone, he realizes that he may be in over his head.
""At Close Range"" is a great film. The story is based on the real life story of killer Bruce Johnson. With the acception of the character's names being chaged, the film features an accurate interpretation of events. It is truly a shame that no one really knows about this film. It features a powerful and emotional tale of an American criminal family. The film is very captivating and draws you in from the beginning. The story is great because it combines a somewhat touching look at a son getting to know his father, with an extremely well thought out crime story. This film emphasizes the term ""appearances can be deceiving"" because as the story goes on, Brad begins to learn what type of man his father really is.  There is also a nice romance aspect to the story because Sean Penn's character meets and falls for a woman played by Mary Stuart Masterson.
Sean Penn and Christopher Walken offer two of their finest performances in this film, which is another reason why it is a shame that no one knows about this movie. ""At Close Range"" shows that Sean Penn was a great actor before ""Mystic River"". He nails the role with his perfect portrayal of being rebellious and naive at the same time. Christopher Walken is great because he plays both the loving father and the hardened criminal so well. Walken's performance in this film will give you the creeps. It really was the perfect role for him. Overall, I would place ""At Close Range"" at the top of the ""unknown gem"" category. This film is probably one of the best crime films I have ever seen. The story is absolutely fantastic and the actors involved could not have given better peformances.

573029,5,6303141978,"It still bothers me that this film was so overlooked when it came to nominations. The overall beauty of the composition-the way the director placed the characters in light and shadow- reminded me of rennaisance paintings. While Christopher Walken had tantalized viewers in many roles from small time innocent in Vietnam to his latter day incarnations as masters of pure evil, here he gave an incredibly nuanced portrait of a monster, a real, sometimes likeable monster and father. To this reviewer, one of the best acting performances ever committed to film.",1078358400,9,558,5.142857142857143
573030,5,6303141978,"At Close Range is a dark but outstandingly beautiful movie starring Sean Penn (I Am Sam) and Christopher Walken (The Deer Hunter) and directed by James Foley (Glengarry Glen Ross). Based on a true story of the Johnston family crimes. The name was changed for dramatic purposes to Whitewood.
Sean Penn plays young Brad Jr who is lured by Brad Sr, played remarkably by Walken, into his gang of thieves. When Brad Jr finds out that the gang does more than just steal, but also murder, he decides to walk out leading the movie to the very frightful and haunting events that followed.
The movie was nominated only for a Berlin International Film Festival award. Why it was not nominated for any Golden Globes or Oscars is a mystery. The movie presents very strong performances from its lead actors as well as the supporting cast that includes Mary Stuart Masterson, Crispin Glover, Keifer Sutherland, and Sean Penn's younger brother Chris Penn.
The movie also has an incredibly bittersweet musical score, taken from Madonna's wonderful song 'Live To Tell'

573128,4,6303141978,"One of the best films of the 1980's, At Close Range tells the true story of the Johnston Family gang (changed here to Whitewood) which terrorized Delaware, Maryland and Pennsylvania in the 1970s by stealing tractor parts and generally being hoods. While the story may sound not too compelling, this film gets a huge boost from some great ensemble acting. This is the movie that got me over my aversion to Sean Penn and Christopher Walken delivers one of the most believably evil people in movies. I grew up in the town this all took place in and Bruce Johnston (Christopher Walken=Brad Whitewood) lived next door to my Uncle. And my Uncle said that Walken nailed this guy's persona. Scary Thought. What saves At Close Range from being just another crime movie is the flair that James Foley brings to the direction. It's often gorgeous, thank to Juan Ruiz Anchia's brilliant cinematography and in no small part to Patrick Leonard's haunting score, keyed to the melody of Live to Tell.

On various levels, however, this film delivers.  It is an honest, realistic portrayal of blue-collar criminal life conspiciously (thank you very much) absent of glamor.  At the heart of the movie is a love story that, well, adds heart to the dark nature of the film's (mostly true, apparently) subject matter.  The cinematography captures a physical beauty of small town America that invites repeat viewings.  Although a simple moral tale at its core, the film does not preach.  At Close Range possesses a strangely alluring, beautiful quality.

573134,4,6303141978,"The plot's fairly simple and we've seen it a thousand times: a young man on the brink of adulthood has to choose between good and evil, responsibility and recklessness, an honest life or a life of crime.  Been there, done that.
What makes this movie memorable is the setting (rural Pennsylvania, as far as I could tell) and its excellent deromanticizing of the criminal life.  Consider it an anti-Godfather film;  instead of the luscious sepia-toned interiors and National Geographic ethnic-portrait, period quality of Coppola's masterpiece, this is plain ol' America, this is the 70's, and this is crass, ordinary, everyday crime.
It's the same thing, really:  Brad Whitewood Senior is a wannabe Godfather, but he's being shown without the ritual and romance of the Sicilian tradition.  He's just a brutal, amoral thief, and his gang are all of the same stamp.
His son, already on his way to some kind of trouble in a going-nowhere back-of-beyond small town, is fascinated by  Dad.  Dad has money, Dad has fast cars.  Dad has the keys to the good life;  at home there's just Mom and Mom's downer boyfriend who gets upset if you smoke dope and make a racket at night when the rest of the family wants to sleep.  What's a troubled teen to do?  Run away to Dad, of course.
Walken does a terrific job as the charismatic but snake-evil Whitewood Senior.  Though the accent seems to slip a bit at times, he has the charm and the blarney and the musical, (self)hypnotizing delivery of the practised con man.  Penn is well-cast as the not-too-bright boy with ambitions beyond his abilities.  The supporting cast is solid. The cinematography is a style and era that I find very enjoyable.
I was disappointed by the kitschy ""back from the dead"" ending. Admittedly, we can glimpse that the gunman sent to wipe out the last witness against dear old Dad is Patch, the most incompetent crook ever born;  so it figures he would mess up even something so simple as a gangland shooting.  But the heroic ""bullet-ridden boy drags self across country to confront bad guy"" sequence left me skeptical and bored rather than riveted.  Based on a true story or not, it was hard to take.
Right up until that moment I was hooked, and I would have been fine with the film ending on the long still shot of the car sitting by the silent farmhouse in the night.  However, we had to have the final confrontation, and I give the film makers credit for letting Whitewood Jr. pass his final moral test:  rather than  putting Dad away for good in the family tradition, he votes for law and order and chooses to testify in court.  The courtroom scene at the end was for me more tense, and more genuinely moving, than the kitchen confrontation scene (though I admit the line ""Is this the family gun?"" was a winner!)
I give the film makers full marks for resisting the usual cloying Daddy/Sonny reconciliation schlock (probably typified at its saccharine worst in Lucas' Star Wars saga), instead voting for Sonny's eyes at last opening to the fact that Daddy is irredeemably wicked.
One thing that's a bit bothersome is the strongly implied rape of Whitewood Jr's girlfriend by Whitewood Sr.  The incident is handled without a lot of exploitative detail, yet it's also quietly buried in the plot.  We never know if the kid finds out about this;  did she ever tell him?  would she ever have told him?  It certainly destroys any lingering shred of sympathy we might ever have had for Daddy, but the way it disappears completely from the plot is somehow disturbing, as if it was of no consequence in the end.
Well portrayed throughout is the appalling ignorance and gullibility of young boys, and their vulnerability to any kind of opportunistic manipulator.  The film works well, I should think, as an antidote to any appeal that the life of crime might have for an adolescent viewer.  It's a sharp, harsh moral tale about the kind of people you get involved with in that line of work, and though it's a lesser achievement than Coppola's classic, I have to admit that it is ethically a better work;  it does not lure the viewer into sympathizing and identifying with ruthless criminals, instead it more sanely encourages us to see them as they are and pity or despise them.
It also paints a convincing portrait of the kind of dead-end rural poverty and semi-poverty that can make the life of crime seem dangerously attractive.  Very American, very realistic, quite suspenseful, and of course Walken is revelling in his  character's villainy and loopy, sociopathic, treacherous charm; the film would be worth the price of admission just to enjoy his performance.  Penn I can take or leave, but Walken is very fine here.",980294400,12,4678,4.729963008631319
573135,5,6303141978,"It's official... ""At Close Range"" is here on DVD!  I've seen an early release copy of the film, and it turns out the DVD transfer is ABSOLUTELY SUPERB.  I can't evaluate the sound because I have only a stereo hookup (sounded good in stereo), but it's clear a lot of work went into video restoration and the actual transfer to MPEG format.  This is likely the best transfer to DVD I've seen of any 1980's film -- the picture is clear and bright, and the colors are absolutely beautiful.  Offered in single layer format, with widescreen on one side and pan-and-scan on the other.  The only unfortunate thing is that there aren't any special features (only a theatrical preview)... it's too bad, but don't let that discourage you from getting this film on DVD!
As for the story itself, this is perhaps Christopher Walken's best performance -- but there isn't a single poor performance in the entire film.  Superlative production values and fantastic acting and music help support this film, which is based on a true story (and apparently based pretty closely, from what I've heard).  As for the plot itself, I won't comment too much (a lot has been said here already and on the Internet Movie Database), but if you like crime dramas and teen romances (and can handle some violence), you'll likely love this film.  9/10, or 5/5 stars.",976147200,5,1330,4.702586206896552
