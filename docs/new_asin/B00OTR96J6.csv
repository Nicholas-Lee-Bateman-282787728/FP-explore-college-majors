6760385,4,B00OTR96J6,"""I Origins"" (2014 release; 117 min.) brings the story of Dr. Ian Gray (played by Michael Pitt). As the movie opens, we are in the present day, as Gray explains what he does (complicated research on the iris patterns of the eyes). We soon thereafter are transported back 7 years and we see Gray meeting a mysterious woman at a Halloween party. (We later learn her name, Sofi, played by Astrid Berges-Frisbey.) Sofi has remarkable iris patterns and Gray asks if he can photograph them, which she lets him. She takes off before Gray gets her name or number, but through a number of circumstances, he is able to track her down, and they really hit it off. In a parallel story line, Karen (played by Brit Marking) is Gray's new lab research assistant. They are conducting all kids of experiments on blind mice and worms, which they hope will lead to a breakthrough. At this point we 're less than 20 min. into the movie but to tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: first, this is the newest film from writer-director Mike Cahill, who previously brought is that other science-fiction flavored movie a few years back, ""Another Earth"". Second, this movie contains elements of science-fiction, but it is a lot of other things too, and as such this movie is difficult to categorize (and as a result also problematic from a marketing perspective). If by chance you have seen the trailer for this movie (as I had before going in), you know what I mean. As a further aside, the trailer revealed WAY TOO MUCH of the story, so you are better off staying away from seeing it. Third, the movie tries to pit religion against science, and does not succeed well on that level. What at some point is ""why are you working so hard to disprove God"" becomes later on ""What will you do if spirituality disproves your scientific position?"". Fourth, there are some good performances in here. While I'm not a huge fan of actress-model Astrid Berg&egrave;s-Frisbey, she does quite well in here. On the other hand, I'll go see Brit Marling in just about any movie, and her string of good roles in recent years (Another Earth, Sound of My Voice, Arbitrage, The East, just to name those) is quite impressive. Last but not least, there is a very nice electronica soundtrack, composed by Will Bates and Phil Mossman, and there are also two Radiohead songs in the movie, Life in a Glasshouse, and Motion Picture Soundtrack, the latter playing over the dramatic closing scenes just before the end titles. Speaking of which: DO NOT LEAVE when the end titles start rolling, as there is an intriguing and surprising post-end titles sequence you don't want to miss...

The movie opened will little pre-release fanfare or advertising at my local art-house theatre here in Cincinnati last month. The early evening screening I saw this at on the opining weekend was not particularly well attended. As I alluded to, this movie is difficult to categorize and is a bit all over the place. It only played for a week here in Cincinnati, but maybe this is one of those movies that finds a wider audience once it's released on DVD/Blu-ray. If you are in the mood for something very different from your standard Hollywood fare, you might be very well served checking out ""I Origins"", be it in the theater or on DVD/Blu-ray.",1413849600,13,3364,4.671163575042159
6760386,1,B00OTR96J6,Ironic that this movie is largely about eyes yet it completely lacks focus. Skip it.,1526688000,,84,4.666666666666667
6760387,1,B00OTR96J6,"Here's ANOTHER slow, convoluted and dull Mike Cahill film that attempts to hybridize tragic chick-flick romance, science fiction and metaphysical claptrap, with predictable results.

In a nutshell, a ""scientist"" with a grudge against spirituality and creationism endeavors to prove his theory of eyeball evolution, but instead proves to himself that reincarnation is real.

Actually, that synopsis sounds ten times better than the movie itself.

While this film's contrived technobabble may at first appeal to atheist viewers (who enjoy mocking intelligent design and deriding those who endorse it), the fact remains that the pseudoscientific premise is flawed.

See, the ""scientist"" is manipulating genes so as to CREATE hybridized chimeras that support his evolution hypothesis.  In other words, the scientist is playing God in his laboratory and is only proving that mutations result from intelligent design (the scientist's intelligent design), rather than from chaotic evolution.

Judging from a few of the reviews for this movie, this glaring contradiction leaves a bad taste in the mouths of atheist viewers (and rightly so, because atheists aren't very receptive to or tolerant of glaring contradictions in their own narrow view of existence).

The contradiction is, in fact, pointed out to the scientist himself early in the film by his true-love interest, a sort of mysterious metaphysical chick with distinctive iris pigmentation and a belief in reincarnation.

Unfortunately, she is killed in a ridiculous elevator accident, leaving the scientist devastated...but not TOO devastated, because he hooks up with his lab assistant soon after the tragedy.  Still, he continues to grieve the loss of his first love for the rest of the movie.

Seven years later, the scientist and his wife (former lab assistant) have a baby; and, while adding the child's iris-scan to a medical database, they are puzzled to learn that the baby's iris-scan is already on record, belonging to an elderly fellow who died months earlier.  This development brings them in contact with another scientist who is researching a link between duplicate iris-scans and reincarnation.

Using the iris-scan database, a link is subsequently established between the deceased metaphysical girl (remember her?) and a 7-year-old child who currently resides in India, and......

Yes, you are correct, the plot has spiralled completely out of control at this point.

These weaker-than-weak twists and turns (and there are plenty of them) are NOT deep and they're NOT clever and they're NOT thought-provoking.  Rather, they play out on the screen like a desperate and futile attempt to lash together fragments of bad ideas into a story where there really is no story.",1526601600,,2735,5.432624113475177

6760396,4,B00OTR96J6,"This is a great film overall. It tackles the subject matter of science vs. spirituality in a way that doesn't feel overwrought or heavy handed. This is done through the realism of the acting and fairly well-rounded characters. Ultimately, it's a film that manages to go deep into its characters and subject matter, and will leave you simultaneously curious and satisfied.

However, there is one plot line that I think should've been expanded upon, because it feels a little undercooked in the film (spoiler ahead!). It's the lab experiment with the main character's child... we get so little info on this experiment, which is so odd and interesting, and leads to such important developments in the plot. I wish the main characters would have reached back out to the scientist running the experiment once they had figured out the truth, to get more information. As it stands now, the entire idea feels cheapened because not enough time was spent on something that feels much more significant than the film allowed it to be (although, if you wait till after the credits you do learn a little more!).",1517961600,,1097,4.866310160427807

6760398,4,B00OTR96J6,"Writer and director Mike Cahill is a true visionary, especially with both I Origins and Another Earth (2011) under his belt. Both films ponder lifes purpose on a deeply personal level, desperately trying to reach pass human limitations. There remains a haunting spirituality about humans existence in Another Earth, and with I Origins Cahill debates the question of God vs. science. What causes dj vu? What propels us to connect with others? Specifically the seemingly odd matched people in our lives? Opposites attract. We know this  so is it all that dangerous to take a leap of faith towards self-discovery. At the end of our long mad road, is achieving solace all that bad of a thing?",1514419200,,688,4.880341880341881

6760407,1,B00OTR96J6,"There are aspects of this that are like-able, but overall, it's simply propaganda. It's a movie designed to make religious people feel negatively toward science, and more and more positive about their faiths. It even uses some pseudo-science to indict science, which is kind of sinister--the idea that science would actually prove religion to be true if scientists would just be honest and thorough. You know... science doesn't eliminate the possibility of God. The more we learn about the universe, the more questions there are about where it comes from, why it's here, what it is, etc. Yet there seems to be a great insecurity on the part of religious people who worry that science is trying to prove that God doesn't exist. And this film seems specifically targeted to exploit the anti-science fears of religious people. When the one woman says, ""it's almost like... her eyes... are a window... to her soul"" the film's propaganda angle should be clear to all but the most naive viewers. I mean... the drama and the characters and the feel of the film are all sophisticated and fine. It's just... it's anti-science propaganda, and that feels like about the last thing anyone needs in 2017.",1502409600,3,1191,4.900990099009901

6760435,1,B00OTR96J6,"The plot hinges on a young evolutionary biologist whose research (involving the evolution of the eye)  is leading  (he apparently hopes) toward a refutation of creationism and all things spiritual.  Along the way he falls in love with a beautiful model with strange biometrics in her eyes,  who before dying (suddenly and without any clear cause), challenges him with her ideas about a spiritual world beyond the physical senses..  After her death, a series of synchronistic and bizarre events follows, which ultimately undermine his steel-plated belief in science as the sole guide to reality, and show him (vaguely) that a spiritual world, reincarnation etc. are all around him.  So what's the problem?  Well, contrasting the scientific method against intuition, faith and metaphysical mysteries could certainly have led to an interesting story, but the story line in this film is half-baked and frequently incoherent.  In fact at times it's laughable.  We are presented with multiple sub-plot dead-ends which have all the hallmarks of an amateur script-writer.

6760446,4,B00OTR96J6,"When a film is followed by animated discussion, one can say it has been provocatively successful, as is the case with I Origins. The underlying theme is familiar--rational thinking vs. spirit and a supreme power; it is reminiscent of C.S. Lewis's thesis that miracles and unexpected occurrences definitely can occur, because the range of variables and environments that scientists are able to observe is always necessarily limited.

The film was done on a limited budget, so a few flaws are understandable. Most disconcerting is that the voices should have been captured well by high-quality directional mics handled by a skilled audio crew, but were not. This resulted in a lack of clarity because the brightness of mid-range and upper mid-range frequencies was lost. Consequently, it is difficult to understand some of the dialog. There are also loose ends in the plot that raise their own questions--for example, the apparent tie between the protagonists' baby's eyes to a black farming family in the Midwest isn't sufficiently developed.

Still, eyes represent a fascinating setting for developing the plot and underlying argument. So five stars for originality. I Origins is well worth seeing.",1478563200,,1198,5.3

6760449,3,B00OTR96J6,"I was trying to think of an apt analogy for this film, but the best I could come up with was that you 'can see too many hands in the puppets'. The overall story line was an interesting one asking, ""What if the eye's signature -thought to be more unique than a fingerprint- showed up in a new born after someone's death?"".  The main character, a scientist, hell bent on eliminating the eye's novelty from apologetics books as proof of a creator, seeks to find the missing link in eye development, thus showing natural, evolutionary processes at work. His success is blind-sided when the work of another scientist throws a wrinkle into his research.

The characters themselves, who came across as predictable and two dimensional, made it difficult for me to fully suspend disbelief and settle in to this film. There were times in the film where I thought the producers of ""God is not Dead"" had jumped ship and produced a movie on reincarnation. The heavy handedness of the message and the predicable analogies were low points in what could have been a great movie.  I hope this writer/producer keeps writing as I think he's got potential and there were real moments of promise. It's worth watching for those moments, and I enjoyed it enough that I almost gave it four stars as someone who is a fan of movies on the supernatural, science fiction and the unknown.",1477094400,,1359,4.677824267782427

Research scientist, Ian (Michael Pitt- FUNNY GAMES), is working on the evolution of sight, in order to factually prove how eyes developed. Together w/ his brilliant research assistant, Karen (Marling), Ian is on the verge of a major breakthrough. Of course, if this were just a movie about  lab work, it wouldn't be very interesting. Thankfully, Ian has met a mysterious woman, named Sofi (Astrid Berges-Frisbey), leading to love, and ultimately to tragic loss.

There are so many things to like about I Origins and just like the real world, entropy seems to want to destroy beautiful structures and relationships so soon after arising out of the chaos. I could have watched only the first ~40 minutes and been ever so pleased with the movie. That's not to say that it should have ended there, but the story could have blossomed in so many ways alternated to what direction it took. This movie will probably have a special place at the intersection of my science-based worldview and spirituality.

This movie makes me wonder if perhaps some come into the world only as some sort of flirtatious rebuttal to one's preconceived notions. Sofi seems to be exactly that for Ian. Sofi, alternate for Sophia, means 'wisdom' whereas Ian, alternate for John, means 'God is Gracious'. For the atheist, Ian, it seems wisdom was gracious.

A little research shows that she is very close with the writer director and having loved her in Another Earth, she shines as well in this.  The Walking Dead guy is a bonus additional character as well as the unknown to me Sofi.  The added cameo of the man of god in the end who is also in other works by Cahil, was a nice surprise.. In summation, everyone does an excellent job. The material is well written and while it does drag slightly in the middle, it is worth the effort to see it through. Excellent work.

This film stars Michael Pitt as the scientist Ian Gray, Brit Marling as his graduate assistant, and Astrid Berges-Frisbey as the scientists girlfriend.
Pitts character Ian Gray is researching the evolutionary development of the eye.  As an atheist he wants to refute an argument that creationists use against evolution: that it is impossible to create, by small steps one at a time, such a marvelously complex instrument as the eye and that the fossil record does not show any intermediate steps or rudimentary eyes.
He meets and becomes obsessed with the girl played by Astrid, who is his opposite in personality and beliefs.  While he is methodical and organized she is spontaneous and intuitive.  Opposed to his atheism, she exudes some sort of new-age, ill defined mystical belief system which includes reincarnation.  Theres the first major problem with the story: believing that they could actually be so in love with each other as to plan to marry despite these deep differences in world view.
Two events alter the course of his life: she dies in an elevator accident (in his arms) and he is assigned a graduate assistant, which he really didn't want.  The grad student however soon proves to be perhaps a better scientist than he is, and rapidly begins making some progress untangling the first evolutionary step in development of the eye.  Following the death of his lover he goes into depression and isolation, she comes to his place to console him, and soon they are not just co-workers but husband and wife (with a child on the way).

Next plot convolutions: the rapid growth of biometric identity verification is piling up databases of millions of iris patterns.  Iris pattern is supposed to be even more unique than fingerprints in identifying a person.  So if theres one matching pattern in the world at any one time, that would be uncommon.  Yet identical matches begin turning up, and usually its a child matching the pattern of someone recently deceased (back to that reincarnation thing).
On a hunch he looks for a match for his deceased lovers eyes and finds one in a young child in India.  His research assistant, far from discouraging him pursuing any threads connected to his almost-wife, actually encourages him to go to India and find the child and see if its really an exact match or not.  Which he does.
So essentially this is an argument between science and religion, set in a fictional story that ties in the latest technology in personal identification, and ancient theories of reincarnation.
Both the females are lovely and draw sharp visual contrasts with each other, Brit being blonde and blue eyed and Astrid having dark brown hair and a darker complexion.  I found the main character, Ian Gray, to be self-centered, self-indulgent and somewhat obnoxious, which made it hard to connect with the movie.  Ultimately it seems sort of a shadow of a really interesting science fiction movie that lay elusively beyond the script writer and directors grasp.",1448496000,5,3034,4.940944881889764

Blu ray does not come with any special features. (I don't know why the used dvds are so much more expensive. They were available in RedBox once.)",1440547200,,491,4.6976744186046515

Those eyes really are amazing.

This was a very unusual story.
I loved the characters and I really cared about them.
I really loved everything about the entire movie, but I enjoyed the ending most of all.
The death scene really shocked me.
I also recommend ""The Sound of My Voice"" with the same actress.

SPOILER ALERT....

At the very end, after the credits are done, there is a very short scene where the researchers are looking through photos of famous long-dead people, supposedly matching them up with their reincarnations.  But this did not make sense because the eye scanning did not exist when those famous people lived.  Are photos of dead people enough for their scans?  This scene should have been at the very end of the movie, right before the credits, not after the credits.... this way, I am sure that many people did not get to see this scene because the credits were very long and most people turn the movie off as soon as the credits roll.

I thought that it was strange that Ian did not know the name of Sofia's perfume.  Even if she never told him, he must have seen it at some point, because they lived together, and even after she died when he went through her things.

I wondered what was supposed to happen next, after the ending.
Could he really just leave the child there and go home without her?
But could he bring her home with him, to literally raise the reincarnation of his lover together with his wife and baby?
I think that he should have just made arrangements for her to be cared for somewhere, or adopted somewhere, so that he could still see her from time to time.

From what I have seen about reincarnation, a child has the strongest past-life memories when she is very young (a toddler), and the memories start to fade by the time of this child's age, and the memories are the strongest when there was a very traumatic death.",1439596800,,1922,4.462857142857143

Although the ""eyes"" is the metaphor, in reality there are a number of books by doctors providing case information on reincarnation that relates to physical attributes carried forward from life to life, and explaining certain phobias which cannot be explained in the current life experience.  One Dr Brian Weiss, Psychiatrist comes to mind.  Dr. Raymond Moody, Psychiatrist is another.  Many more great books out there detailing the reality of reincarnation, which would be a taboo for the church world. There is also Dr. Jim Tucker, and Dr. Ian Stevenson, both psychiatrists, and their books and studies at University on this topic. The second church council at Nicea in 585 AD revealed the removal of hundreds of passages by Jesus referring to reincarnation.  Fortunately for us, they left 16 passages in the bible that reveals reincarnation.  Enjoy the movie. Also look at the DVD ""Cloud Atlas.""",1438300800,5,1039,5.260606060606061

There were changes made in the version I purchased.  In the first version we saw, the preacher man confronts the scientist at the end with accusations. Also I think there were plans of adoption of the child.  I think these were probably good changes to make, but they should have gone in and edited out the existence of the preacher man.  Makes no sense for him to be there.  There is no labeling that this is a director's cut or anything.  Anybody else out there notice this?

6760577,4,B00OTR96J6,"I found I Origins incredibly sad.  This is probably because it focuses heavily on eyes.  We look at each others eyes every single day.  That's how we make contact.  Since so much emphasis in on the eye and how it correlates to life itself, well yeah, I was pretty choked up (especially in the very beginning with the many different eyes being shown slideshow-like).

Anyway the movie's about a molecular biologist (Michael Pitt) and his lab partner (played by Brit Marling) who mutate worms and make many modifications all in an attempt to create vision for a blind worm.  When they do, well, that's the groundbreaking discovery they've been waiting for.  The story then goes 7 years into the future as Michael and Brit get married, have a kid and well, I won't anymore.  Let's just say the most amazing thing happens at the end, but truthfully many of us probably saw it coming.  However that's not to say the conclusion still isn't satisfying- it most certainly is.  I can't really call it a major surprise though.  I Origins asks a lot of questions that have been constant since man first walked on the planet- the existence of God and whether he's real or not.  Or whether God doesn't exist and it's all about science.

Before all this however, Michael Pitt meets a beautiful girl who is from Argentina (Astrid Berges Frisbey).  They gradually fall in love but after a VERY disturbing accident they can't get married as planned.  This is when Michael and Brit take their DNA testing/experimenting on worms in the labs to a whole new groundbreaking level.  I don't want to spoil too much here since I feel like I've already said more than enough.  Let's just say there's a reason for the eerie tone throughout the film.

I'd say I Origins is a science fiction in the lightest sense.  Don't expect anything outrageous to happen with special effects galore, but expect to be wowed by the way the story develops and the discoveries that are made between not only Michael and Brit, but Astrid plays a major part too (even after said accident).  That's not to say this movie doesn't have its confusing moments either. For someone that doesn't really understanding DNA testing, mutations and modifications (or anything related to biology really other than a brief class in high school 20 years ago) a lot of this stuff went completely over my head.  The whole ""number 11"" thing where Michael was seeing this number everywhere for a short period outside didn't make sense to me but I probably just overlooked the obvious since I Origins is honestly told in a way that's easy to understand for the most part.

Anyway the acting is terrific as is the storyline, but please understand it moves at a snails pace.  It's greatly helped by just being interesting and getting your imagination flowing however.  The science fiction parts are subtle but work well within the story.  Yes this comes down to ""God versus science""- that's true, but it's not meant to offend anybody's beliefs.  Instead it's meant to open ones viewpoint and see the other side of the argument while wrapping it around a meaningful well-told story.  Overall I Origins is really good but can drag sometimes which is why I give it a 4 instead of a 5.",1433635200,,3211,4.6976744186046515

6760583,2,B00OTR96J6,"Maybe I just missed the point, and I appreciate this film's attempt to be thought provoking, but I found it ultimately failed by pitting the two dullest arguments in the pro/anti spirituality camps against each other.  On the one side, we have a scientist who doesn't believe in anything he can't measure, and on the other we have this fluffy, yoga mat version of reincarnation.  Ugh, who cares?  It's as if Richard Dawkins were debating Gweneth Paltrow.  There are better voices on either side (e.g. Carl Sagan, John Polkinhorne) and the concept as a whole lacked the substantive complexity it needed to make it interesting.

There were also many minor irritants having to do with how the science was portrayed that led to a little shouting at the screen - e.g. I'm pretty sure I heard the actor say ""muted mouse"" when he meant ""mutated.""  And where were their supervisors?  Who funded this stuff?

As a major irritant, near the end there is a plot turn where the main character (a male) is trying to make a great discovery based on some clues he inadvertently picked up from a (female) scientist's work. We were supposed to root for the man, but I think Rosalind Franklin might argue against that viewpoint. It seemed like outright plagiarism.  A little weird that that was used.

Overall, I felt lacked the intellectual rigor it needed to pull off its ambitions and it would have benefited from more time, and maybe the creators listening to the On Faith podcast for a few months.",1431820800,,1483,4.713178294573644

6760593,5,B00OTR96J6,"Maybe you want to read this after you watch the film, but it could be insightful to read before too.

This is one of those films that touches on a subject many are unfamiliar with and thus will color one's opinion of it. Even many who accept it, don't really think about how it works.  What is that subject, well, it is alluded to in the preview trailer, so I'll just say it -- reincarnation.

On paper, Hindus and Buddhists believe in it, so there are 1 billion+ believers. Some sects of Judaism and Christianity also believe in it, although they are in the minority. (But hey - aren't many movies about the minority being right and the majority wrong? Minority Report anyone?) Some non-religious folks accept it too. Jesus did say there is 'life after death' and...that is.... reincarnation. (U can down vote this review now)

[Watch NatGeo Gospel of Judas for an interesting perspective on Gnosticism / alternative view of early events connected to Jesus.]

I won't bother with a review of the film, others have that covered. Many negatives ones, and many positive ones (though a lot of both are one liners). I can't speak to the science behind the 'iris scanning' because that is not my forte. But, I will just briefly note how the concept of reincarnation is played out in the film, for whoever wrote the script has certainly thought about it.

This is the best movie using reincarnation as a plot element that I have ever seen, there aren't that many. - Chances Are - with Robert Downey, Jr is a lighthearted one and another film - Birth - with Nicole Kidman is another one you might want to watch. Various documentaries can be found on Youtube.

But, this one is the best, because not only does it take the subject seriously, it highlights how reincarnation works better. The reason for that is in the word itself and simple population analysis:  re-in-car-NATION.  CAR ~ KARma ~ CHARacter ~ CHARisma ~CARne (flesh).  So, how we have lived in our current life (combined with past life energy still in us) determines what NATION we are reborn into in this life. This isn't just by political borders, but also ethnicity and regions within a country. The word NATION is rooted in the word meaning - birth. Our PERSONalities at the end of our life (KARma we have when we die) can be segmented into various categories just as a company segments groups for marketing/advertising purposes, etc...or just as we segment animals into various groups (Linnaean taxonomy).  Who is measuring it and doing the re-distribution and why, that is beyond the scope of this review.

Based on this remaining KARma our soul is reborn into an appropriate NATION. Generally speaking, it is grouped with like-minded/hearted souls. The two most populous countries in the world are China and India which are opposites in many ways. The former is  material-focused (& non religious / non ""spiritual""), the latter is super religious with many Gods (even those of your own creation! - who is God anyway?) - generally speaking, people / souls change of course.

If u study just a little bit of these countries you will see this. Perhaps you can see people around you who are not from/born in China/India who fit into either category. There is a strong likelihood (40% chance) that they will be reborn into one of these two nations. Reincarnation is a model that explains suffering in the world and why we are the way we are (Child prodigies / early childhood interests unrelated to parents anyone?).  What kinds of souls do you think get reborn into places which have the most suffering? Maybe you will find a clue by studying the NAMEs of all the countries of the world and correlating that with the culture / ACTions of the people.  hint: studying languages / word roots will help you with this. What are people like in the countries with the least amount of suffering? What is your definition of suffering?

I,Origins is realistic in that it shows ethnicity change and country change for souls. The two other reincarnation movies do not and both of those also have romantic 'love' as a primary plot device, whereas I, Origins is 'love' in a more caring for others kind of way.

None of the word breakdown is in the movie, for this is not well known, but it is there for you to see.  There is A LOT more to this, but this is not the appropriate place for it. Hope this analysis helps.

BTW: Etymology of the word PERSON(ality) = actor's mask, character in a play, person, probably from Etruscan phersu mask..more on Merriam-Webster. Want to be reborn in a better situation?.... then stop being an 'ACTOR wearing a mask,' saying ( and /or subconsciously thinking!) one thing and doing another. If you don't like your subconscious thoughts, then keep asking why you are thinking them. BE more ""genuine and real!"" More hypocrisy (lying) = more suffering in future lives and if I was a betting man, your current one too! Know DIE self....",1429142400,,4911,4.694994179278231

The movie really has some intriguing themes but at times gets a bit plodding, annoying and slow.  The premise is enough to keep me interested even though it ends up in a predictable way.  I wasn't crazy about Pitts acting as it felt a bit one dimensional and flat and felt that the female co-leads (Bergs-Frisbey and Marling) really provided the energy in the movie.

6760625,3,B00OTR96J6,"Three stars used to mean ""good"" with Amazon's rating system but I don't see that reference popping up anymore. With that said, the film was good, and that's it. After seeing ""Another Earth"" I was exposed to Brit Marling, a very interesting actress and she remains as compelling here.  Mike Cahill (also from ""Another Earth"" ) was  behind the camera so I had to give it a watch. ""I Origins"" is a tediously annoying film that gives off just enough shine from the lure to keep you circling.  It's really a film about broadening the scientific mind. Once the film opens up to to its main objective, psychological tension quickly fuels the film. Michael Pitt as the eye obsessed doc is quite good as the film progresses but his early portrayal as a semi hip college dude is bland. Also, pairing him with an Argentinian lover just didn't fit. The ""hot"" love scenes came off cold and unnatural .

This is an ideologically driven film , brewing with hopes of the supernatural. Cahill is brilliant with cinematography, especially in India. Getting  zinged with thought seems to be his specialty . Unfortunately he makes you stew in those thoughts just a bit too much with this one. Basically, you will be looking for a payoff, and whether this film delivers is independently based.",1425772800,,1272,4.711711711711712
6760626,4,B00OTR96J6,Interesting theory,1425600000,,18,8.5
6760627,4,B00OTR96J6,"Spoilers lurk.  Director and writer Mike Cahill, first came to my attention with his rookie film from 2011 called ""Another Earth.""  It was co-written by and starred Brit Marling.  It is one of those sci-fi films that doesn't have much in the way of bombastic special effects, but one that makes you think.  ""I Origins"" follows a similar concept.  Not that the plots are anything alike, but the film relies on the unknown, approaching ""Twilight Zone"" material.

Brit Marling also stars here as a young biological research assistant to Michael Pitt's Ian Gray.  Ian has long been fascinated by eyes, especially human eyes.  Over the years he's taken numerous photos of eyes and has developed a catalog of sorts.  Evidently, scientists have never been able to explain that the eye has never evolved over the millennia like other body parts, even in animals.  He and Karen (Marling) are trying to create an eye for an otherwise blind animal, e.g. a worm.  The pair believe that such a discovery would end any debate regarding evolution vs. creation.

Ian is out about town one night and meets a hottie who appears to be in some sort of ninja gear which covers her face but not her hauntingly beautiful eyes.  They pair up quickly and are about to get it on in a bathroom - how romantic - but Sofi (Astrid Berges-Frisbey) quickly breaks it off before going too far.  She quickly disappears into the night and the only thing Ian knows about her is the memory of her eyes.  Using some technology along with persistence and just plain luck, Ian reunites with Sofi and the couple eventually decide to marry.  Before that happens, tragedy ensues putting Ian into a deep funk for weeks.

In a bit of a flash forward, we see that Ian and Karen have wed and about to have a child.  The child is discovered to have possible traits of autism so he is tested.  As part of the test, the child is drawn to photos of characters he's never seen but because of earlier events provide clues that his eyes may not be as unique as scientists believe.  This midsection of the movie does meander a bit and can be confusing.  Still, it is important because it causes our couple to go back in the lab to look for similar traits found in eyes.  This is a long way of saying that perhaps some form of reincarnation is at work.

When searching for other potential matches, photos of Sofi's eyes would seem to match a young girl in India.  I'm guessing that Stanley Kubrick and Terrence Malick are big influences on Cahill.  I will admit that this second film isn't for everyone.  But I enjoy these little scientific and mystical confrontations.

The Blu ray disc has 1080p video resolution and maintains the original 2.40:1 aspect ratio.  The digitally shot film looks great.  Cahill uses numerous facial close ups including some extremely large shots of eyes.  Frankly, it can be quite mesmerizing at times.  The detail is excellent throughout.  You can see skin pores and blemishes on the actors.  I could detect no flaws although sometimes the transition from these extreme close ups to a wider shot seem a little soft.  Probably my own eyes making the transition.

The audio includes a DTS-HD Master Audio 7.1 track.  As is sometimes the case with the 7.1 option, I needed to crank up the amplifier a bit beyond the normal location.  It was especially important in the scenes with Sofi.  Although Ms. Berges-Frisbey has a Spanish father and an American mother, her English is often hard to understand.  In those early scenes where she hooks up with Ian, I had to replay parts a couple times to understand what she was saying.  With her mouth covered by a thin mask, it was even more difficult to hear.  This is a minor issue because I had no problem looking at her.  Subtitles are available in Spanish, French and English SDH but there are no extras.",1425513600,2,3823,4.619613670133729

The question, ultimately: is there such a thing as a soul? Reincarnation?  They approach the question through the old saying:  the eyes are the window of the soul.  It thrills me that film is asking these questions; films like Transcendence and Lucy, but for me this was an exercise in approach/avoidance. My thoughts were provoked when they didn't follow through.
  They open the door, they point down the hall, they throw out a couple of ideas but make no commitment even though film is self-defined by the question. In short, they could have explored their plot more deeply, even while leaving the conclusion open to the viewer.  The fourth star came with the dialogue between the protagonist and his strangely compelling love Sofie. I liked parts a lot and but was disappointed by the whole.

6760651,1,B00OTR96J6,"Brit Marling is one of those new cinematic talents that Ive actively tried to campaign.  Her story is so inspiring and her talent in front and behind the camera is very obvious and varied, which is nice.  She basically got tired of being offered stock roles because of her appearance and decided to take her career into her own hands, writing and producing her own films.  Those films, Another Earth, Sound of My Voice and The East are all very good, very different and pretty inspired works.  She has this knack for developing interesting stories and characters and bringing them to life on screen.

I Origins reteams her with her Another Earth director, Mike Cahill.  Because of this, I was excited, for Another Earth is still my favorite Marling film, and the idea of the two of them reteaming for another dose of science fiction felt fresh and exciting.

I didn't realize that Brit Marling didn't write or produce this film, so maybe thats why its so awful.

I Origins has a very interesting premise, but sadly it is a film that is so completely uninteresting that it fails to live up to any potential that storyline could have had.  The premise is rather intriguing.  A biologist and atheist, Ian, attempts to play god in order to disprove that god exists.  In the process, he meets and falls in love with a woman who, ironically, has very strong belief in a spirit world.  Despite their obvious differences (there are many), the two form a bond that is shattered, unexpectedly, leaving Ian desperate and disillusioned, until the very thing that made him so adamant in his disbelief in a creator begins to sway his seemingly solid beliefs.

There is a lot of stuff about eyes here, but Ill let the film explain that for you.

Heres my problem, or problems.  First, I Origins feels like two films that are trying to be cohesive and yet cant really find a meshing point.  The first half is tiresome in its pointlessness, establishing relationships and ideas and yet never really grounding any of them.  We know what Ian thinks and what Sofi thinks and who Karen is and yet their intertwining never really feels honest or even believable, and despite the ideas implemented by the fragmented way in which Cahill shoots the first half, those ideas almost become forgotten.  I think a major reason for this is that Michael Pitt, as an actor, is just so uninteresting.  He just feels so blank and he cant convey anything deeper than a surface expression, and even there he struggles, and so leaving the whole films crux on his shoulders was a very poor decision.  The lack of real character development with the two female stars, who are far more charismatic and engaging as actresses, also dampens the progression of story.  The second half is such a sharp contradiction to the first that it feels like Cahill had no idea what he was really trying to say and so he said two vastly different things and just went with it.

It doesnt work.

Anyone else disturbed by the very nonchalant way that both Ian and Karen talk about experimenting on their baby?

Anyways, I really wanted this to be an interesting and richly constructed film, but at the end of the day, I Origins says absolutely nothing, like at all.  It had all these chances to say something smart or at least interesting about the debate of life, creation, atheism, religion or even grief and loss, but it throws all of those ideas out there with no grounding and no retort.  It honestly says NOTHING about ANYTHING.",1423180800,10,3475,4.655737704918033

6760656,5,B00OTR96J6,"This multi-faceted film is a drama that explores several intellectual themes and is a good love story.  It's hard to categorize but left a vivid and memorable impression.

Michael Pitt plays a scientist who conducts research on the biological evolution of the eye.  While a doctoral student he separately meets two women who come to play important roles in his life.  The first is a mysterious and seductive woman (Astrid Bergs-Frisbey) whom he meets at a Halloween costume party.  He knows little about her when the night ends, but he has a picture of her eyes and costume-covered face.  The second woman is a new lab assistant (Brit Marling) who joins his research efforts as an intellectual peer.  Both women appeal to and represent different aspects of his personality, and separate storylines emerge from this that later become intertwined.  One can't really say too much about the latter without revealing plot points, but the drama does an effective job of merging all of the film's themes.

This movie is many things: a love story and an exploration of science, philosophy, spirituality, and identity.  It also includes some of the most artistic cinematography of the human eye that you are ever likely to see.  There are several nice sequences of the latter, and the persistent backdrop of a nice electronica soundtrack helps reinforce a reflective tone throughout much of the film.  Pitt, Marling, and Bergs-Frisbey are each effective in their respective roles.  Their performances and the film's themes and dramatic elements impact you as a viewer and leave an impression.

I strongly recommend this movie to anyone who likes thought-provoking and thematically-driven films intermixed with some romance.",1422748800,,1714,5.163043478260869

6760663,5,B00OTR96J6,"It really was a genuine love story, and a movie about the mystery of life. We, like the protagonist have it within us as well. There's just many thought structures and beliefs that hold us back from experiencing Truth. He was right when he said ""I'm going to be with a child for the rest of my life"". The premise is very interesting as the eyes play such a big role in mystical traditions. There is something very deep about looking into someones eyes, even your own. It makes me wonder, if the people I know now I have known before in other forms. True Love never ends, that's what I feel from this movie. Love transcends all boundaries, all beliefs. I've had many dreams where I've had this deep and indescribable love for women that I have never met, or at least do not remember meeting in my life. I've also had dreams where I was other people, and they felt so real. Where do these dreams come from, and why do they impact me so deeply? Perhaps we have lived before, we are just suffering from existential amnesia. Trying to figure out who we were, who we are, and the great people that we can become. Maybe what we call this life is a cosmic dream, from which eventually we will all awaken. There is certainly much that we do not consciously perceive- the myriad of possible wavelengths and frequencies of energy. I feel that we can unlock this potential within us, the latent seed that can grow into the blossoming tree of life that We are. As you read this review, it is possible that I have known you before, and that I may know you after. What though is this ""I"" that continues, is it our emotions, our thoughts, or perhaps our personality? I would say that it is not any of those as those are temporary manifestations. The Self underlying all of creation smiles on the wonder of this Creation. Look into a loved ones eyes and see into the Truth. We all have a story, and this story is bound by ethereal threads that carry us around. We call this Fate, though it isn't something set in stone. If we follow our intuition, and listen to that still voice that resides in our Heart, in our very center- we may eventually come to Truth. What is Truth? Silence.

Once upon a time, I dreamt I was a butterfly, fluttering hither and thither, to all intents and purposes a butterfly. I was conscious only of my happiness as a butterfly, unaware that I was myself. Soon I awaked, and there I was, veritably myself again. Now I do not know whether I was then a man dreaming I was a butterfly, or whether I am now a butterfly, dreaming I am a man.- Chuang Tzu",1421712000,2,2557,4.327083333333333

Just a truly, lovely movie that will warm anyone's heart. The writer had to be both a lover and a genius, but be careful, if you don't pay attention to even the little things in the movie, you will miss all the power which make it so enchanting that you will want to watch it again and again.

6760699,1,B00OTR96J6,"Sickening, cheap sentimentality. Another attempt to hoodwink the public into believing in creationism, the plot leaves gaping holes where the scientific argument falters, replacing science with sentiment. As an example of how deeply depraved the story is, think about the ethics of American scientists looking for evidence of reincarnation or supernatural creation amongst street urchins in India. The screen goes blank at the end of the movie, when it is suggested that the protagonist has finally been confronted with irrefutable evidence of reincarnation, but when, historically speaking as well in an ethical sense, he is confronted with the far more difficult choice of returning the urchin to the streets or committing himself to her care. This is precisely the problem with Hollywood and much of contemporary American thought about the rest of the world: to American's, the rest of the world is a sort of cesspool into which they can dip their hands and fish out a few pearls, but where they can never hope to alter conditions. Even though the US is deeply implicated in the creation of those conditions. The movie is ultimately, again, a shallow love story with no ethics, but with a religious theme that will blind its audiences to the true conditions and ethical choices that might properly guide a contemporary spirituality away from the senseless questions of whether God exists, whether creation has a purpose (other than whatever we make of it) and whether life has meaning (other than the meaning we create). Unfortunately, clever filming and good looking actors and actresses fail to conceal the lack of depth.",1420070400,11,1626,5.139622641509434

I also watched the other movie from this director, Another Earth, which I thought was very good, but I Origins takes it to another level.

This movie had everything I really look for in a movie; solid acting, great cinematography, and great ideas presented in a unique way. There are lots of signs and symbols scattered throughout the movie and already I can't wait to go back and watch it again and see all that I may have missed. This movie clearly opens up the long debate between science and religion; and though I mostly consider myself an agnostic, this movie plays on the belief that I have always had that there is a very mysterious, mystical element to the Universe that can't necessarily be explained by science, or at least it hasn't yet. Even though the ending left some  unanswered questions I thought it was fantastic. I watched this movie at night and couldn't fall asleep afterwards thinking of all the possibilities.

6760711,4,B00OTR96J6,"Without spoiling anything, ""I Origins"" is about iris biometrics and reincarnation.  I wouldn't call this a science fiction film, like some reviewers on here mentioned.  The technique en""vision""ed  :)  in this film can definitely become a reality.  I certainly see it being developed as a basic test for the masses.  As for people having matching iris configurations, I'm a little skeptical about that one.  Either way, this film really blew my mind away.  It's got such a unique concept that it captivated my attention throughout the film and really had me awe-inspired both during the movie and after.

I had to take one star off from my review because I wish the two major examples of reincarnated subjects given in the movie weren't of the same sex.  I wish that at least one of the examples featured a reincarnated opposite sex (like a boy coming from a deceased woman).  That would have made for some excellent gender-bending moments, which certainly would have fascinated me a lot more.  So for the writers' ""reincarnation sexism,"" I took off one star.

Circumstances become odd as Ian is faced with the possibility of using his iris scans to prove it.

I liked the film. Acting was decent. It was good science fiction in the fact that it didn't going into areas of gross impossibility. The ending of the film, right before the climax, you know it is coming. as you feel the anticipation. Great scene.

With respect to my second complaint, it appears that no character in the in the film or any reviewer finds this to be a dangerous and controlling technology that will be used by governments and or private entities to provide a global identification and filing system on all information that may be made available from various databases on a global basis.

6760763,5,B00OTR96J6,"Wow! I finished this film probably no longer than 2 minutes ago and parts of this movie just grab you emotionally. I don't know, maybe I'm just at a precarious stage in my life experiences that set the mood for this movie to have the compelling effect that it did but I cannot objectively decide at this time.

This film is a quick journey surrounding the work of a molecular biologist with a field of study specializing in biometric research, focusing on a particular biological aspect that subtly manifests itself in the title of the movie (double-entendre style). The director of cinematography is very artistic and the visuals in conjunction with the musical score can be quite gripping at times. This scientist's aim is to disprove religious arguments that support intelligent design. This film has a Life of Pi vibe mixed with Contact. The on-screen cast consists of great actors with only one recognizable somewhat-famous actor making a cameo appearance.

The main theme of the film is centered on a rather overt science vs. religion (but more so spirituality than any orthodox religious beliefs) debate. The debate is beautifully illustrated through the interactions of said scientist with his professional peers and then his personal contacts. One reviewer says it doesn't succeed in capturing the elements of that debate but I strongly disagree and think that the succinct arguments for and against the creation/intelligent design theory are very poignant and not overly-elaborate--quite adequate in my opinion.  There are a couple moments in this film that elicited a psychosomatic response from me in an exciting kind of way that invites you to share the joys and disappointments of the characters on screen. I thought that was kind of cool.

The course of the film spans years in the main characters life and many stages of life that quickly ensue as his professional career takes off. The dramatic curve is definitely driven by the main character's romantic life and his professional life and all the points of the central theme are delivered through those scenic moments.  The dramatic highlights are predictably demonstrated through experiences that seem to contradict the irrefutable evidence of his life's research and consequently cause him to question the validity of said research and his deepest views on life. Setting the stage for the dramatic climax. The film closes at what is arguably the perfect scene...it delivered a silent yet powerfully-punctuated message that makes this film an easy favorite for me.

I find the way that both sides of the debate are delivered is done in a very graceful and unantagonistic way that most people, sans the bleeding-heart society, won't take offensively and anybody who occasionally walks the line between what can be empirically observed by the human eye and what can only be intuited by the human spirit and extra-sensory perception might enjoy.

In any case, it's a very artsy-hipster flick and I could see people who enjoy films like Donnie Darko (minus the anarchy enthusiasts) or Life of Pi really appreciating this film.

I think it's a modern classic just because it tackles the tough subject of science vs. religion more-or-less and packages it in a tangible way to which we can all relate through the everyday ordinary of life. So I give it up to this director and am definitely interested in seeing what he will produce in the future or what he already has in his catalogue. I kind of have the feeling I did the first time I finished watching Darren Aranofski's Pi.

I think it's a great flick but it won't be for everybody. It's definitely something that provokes thought and I believe targets the population with independent modes of thinking, capable of thinking outside the box, and who dare to challenge the establishment of ""common knowledge,"" because they know that at one time or another all the people that were ""in the know,"" were eventually proven to be wrong.

Touching film; definitely pulled on my heart strings a bit. Actors definitely get my respect because their performances appeared genuine on camera.

Any fans of humanity films like Babel, Drive, et al--this is a MUST-SEE!!!!  Rent it or buy it post haste!",1417737600,2,4203,5.005730659025788

6760765,5,B00OTR96J6,"For those people who like intelligent movies, this is one of the best ever made. Just like his earlier HIGHLY underrated future classic Another Earth, Mike Cahill has presented another intriguing, thought provoking, densely beautiful and yet haunting film that will make you think well after you finish watching the end credits (and BF solutely sure to stay all the way through the end of the credits because there is Morestory after the credits are done.

Without giving any annoying spoilers, this film explores the tension and the relationship between science and religious faith. Mr. Cahill employs many of the same cast members has appeared in another earth including Brit Marling and Tom Cruise's cousin,  William Mopather (whom, judging by his previous work compared to his cousin is every bit as good an actor- just my opinion) in an interesting, and to the plot''s constantly juxtaposing themes essential, cameo.

I Origins is essentially a big Vidalia Onion. It has so many layers you have to keep peeling it back time after time to get all this happens, and all that iis in this movie.

6760775,1,B00OTR96J6,"Based on the trailer, my wife and I were eager to see this movie as soon as it was released. Unfortunately, it stayed in the local theaters for only 2 weeks, and never appeared in a theater within 200 miles of our home.  So, we were thrilled to see that Amazon had the HD version for sale by download.  With the expectations having built for 4-5 months, we couldn't wait.  Then we started the film  Talk about a disappointment!  This has to rank as one of the worst films I have ever seen.  While the premise behind the movie is very cool, the movie itself was just plain bad.  The first 45 minutes or so of the film consist of scene after scene of gratuitous sex, which really has little or nothing to do with the storyline. This portion of the movie just drags on forever, with only a few brief intriguing interludes about the scientific research the main character is conducting on eye development.  Apparently sex was the only thing the film makers could come up with to fill the space/time required for them to reach a full length film, as the real story regarding the iris mapping and the iris connection to the soul only commences at about 45 minutes into the film, after the main characters wife suffers a horrific death.  Once the story commences, the movie improves to some degree, but some of the scientific portions are almost laughable, such as the autism study being conducted at Yale. If a scientist/clinician ever performed studies on human subjects in this fashion, lying about the purpose of the study and thereby negating the requisite consent agreement, she would be out of work and facing criminal charges.  Similarly, the main character grabs the young child off the street in India and brings her to his hotel room and performs psychological studies on her; also something that could never occur legally. Overall, the movies basic idea about the iris and its connection to the soul/spirit is thought-provoking, and could have resulted in a fascinating story.  Unfortunately, in its current form, the film is just dull, slow-moving, and, in general, poorly done.  I do not recommend this film.",1415836800,23,2115,4.732970027247957

It is an intriguing story with excellent videography and screenplay.

If you like movies with elements of coincidence, synchronicity, and themes that challenge ""normal"" perceptions and ways of looking at the world, you will enjoy this one.

The movie paints with a broad brush that touches on science, science fiction, spirituality, drama and is also a moving love story.

One scene though, may be a bit shocking for some - but I won't reveal it as that would be a spoiler!

6760781,4,B00OTR96J6,"""I Origins"" (2014 release; 117 min.) brings the story of Dr. Ian Gray (played by Michael Pitt). As the movie opens, we are in the present day, as Gray explains what he does (complicated research on the iris patterns of the eyes). We soon thereafter are transported back 7 years and we see Gray meeting a mysterious woman at a Halloween party. (We later learn her name, Sofi, played by Astrid Berges-Frisbey.) Sofi has remarkable iris patterns and Gray asks if he can photograph them, which she lets him. She takes off before Gray gets her name or number, but through a number of circumstances, he is able to track her down, and they really hit it off. In a parallel story line, Karen (played by Brit Marking) is Gray's new lab research assistant. They are conducting all kids of experiments on blind mice and worms, which they hope will lead to a breakthrough. At this point we 're less than 20 min. into the movie but to tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: first, this is the newest film from writer-director Mike Cahill, who previously brought is that other science-fiction flavored movie a few years back, ""Another Earth"". Second, this movie contains elements of science-fiction, but it is a lot of other things too, and as such this movie is difficult to categorize (and as a result also problematic from a marketing perspective). If by chance you have seen the trailer for this movie (as I had before going in), you know what I mean. As a further aside, the trailer revealed WAY TOO MUCH of the story, so you are better off staying away from seeing it. Third, the movie tries to pit religion against science, and does not succeed well on that level. What at some point is ""why are you working so hard to disprove God"" becomes later on ""What will you do if spirituality disproves your scientific position?"". Fourth, there are some good performances in here. While I'm not a huge fan of actress-model Astrid Berg&egrave;s-Frisbey, she does quite well in here. On the other hand, I'll go see Brit Marling in just about any movie, and her string of good roles in recent years (Another Earth, Sound of My Voice, Arbitrage, The East, just to name those) is quite impressive. Last but not least, there is a very nice electronica soundtrack, composed by Will Bates and Phil Mossman, and there are also two Radiohead songs in the movie, Life in a Glasshouse, and Motion Picture Soundtrack, the latter playing over the dramatic closing scenes just before the end titles. Speaking of which: DO NOT LEAVE when the end titles start rolling, as there is an intriguing and surprising post-end titles sequence you don't want to miss...

The movie opened will little pre-release fanfare or advertising at my local art-house theatre here in Cincinnati in September. The early evening screening I saw this at on the opining weekend was not particularly well attended. As I alluded to, this movie is difficult to categorize and is a bit all over the place. It only played for a week here in Cincinnati, but maybe this is one of those movies that finds a wider audience once it's released on DVD/Blu-ray. If you are in the mood for something very different from your standard Hollywood fare, you might be very well served checking out ""I Origins"", be it in the theater, on Amazon Instant Video, or on DVD/Blu-ray.",1414972800,68,3392,4.680067001675042
