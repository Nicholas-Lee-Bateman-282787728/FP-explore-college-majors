4376249,3,B004HO6HWK,"I was expecting just another Transporter type of Jason Statham movie, but there is a bit more depth here to go along with the typical action storyline. It's all about a hitman getting wronged by his employer and seeking revenge. Wow, so original right? Okay, I just now found out that The Mechanic is a remake of a 1972 film starring Charles Bronson, so don't expect me to compare the two here.

Jason Statham is probably the biggest active action movie star right now. I'm not really a fan of his, mainly due to the fact that he always looks, acts and sounds the same in pretty much everything he does. The man does know how to sell toughness, especially during the fight scenes. Also, the ""I'm going to kill you look"" that he likes to shoot at the bad guys is quite effective. Ben Foster has more acting range and is quite good here, even though the character as written on paper is nothing special. After his father is killed he gets trained by and then teams up with Statham.

What really surprised me were the action scenes. There were a few good hand to hand fights and shootouts, but this character is all about making deaths look like accidents. So instead, we get a lot of fast kills rather than ones that are drawn out like in the Transporter films.

Overall, I would definitely recommend this as a future rental. It's not outstanding, but I would say it is one of the better action flicks I've seen recently. In fact, I would watch this over The Expendables any day.

3 and 1/2 out of 5 stars",1296172800,,1503,4.39568345323741
4376250,4,B004HO6HWK,"Arthur Bishop (Jason Statham) is a ""mechanic""- an assassin with a talent for getting the job done the way it needs to be done, whether making it look like an accident or sending a message.  After an extended opening sequence to show off Arthur's skills he goes to meet Harry Foster (Donald Sutherland) his mentor and long-time friend.  Harry despairs over his relationship with his estranged son Steve (Ben Foster), who's never lived up to his potential.  Arthur is contracted by one of his employers Dean (Tony Goldwyn) to take out Harry over a botched assignment stemming from leaked information- which only a select few had access to- and does so reluctantly.  After his father's death Steve spirals into self-destructive behavior, fueling Arthur's guilt and forcing him to accept Steve's ironic request to learn the business.  But how long can Arthur keep his involvement in Harry's death a secret from Steve?

This is another flick with great promise that comes up a tad short.  It gets into the darker aspects of human nature- namely greed, violence and guilt- but in this modern age of emo-heroes/anti-heroes, it never finishes the job.  The closest it gets is with Steve's character who in the wake of his father's death seeks closure and a direction in life as well as wanting to understand what it is to kill someone.  The sequence where Steve has to eliminate a man who completely outclasses him illustrates the last perfectly.  Even after being warned against trying to take him on physically Steve does so anyway, with predictable results, but it fits his character.  After seeing Arthur strangle a target Steve chooses to do the same with his, in order to truly feel the moment.  There's also Arthur's lack of emotional connection; his only tethers are a bar slut whom he likes but can't seem to completely reach and Harry.

The movie's a lot of typical fare; the assassins are portrayed as better than their targets by virtue of their ethics and facets of humanity even when faced with the true nature of their business.  The plot hook hinges on an all-too obvious twist that even the high-schoolers sitting behind me were making fun of.  There's much more drama than action here, which wasn't bad but the action has no real flow to it; the fights and shootouts always feel like they were dropped in instead of part of the story.  Statham is his usual brooding self, Goldwyn delivers some personality and Sutherland as usual has a great presence in his handful of scenes.  The best guy here is Ben Foster, who I'm not familiar with but liked a lot.  But the ending was too damn cheesy and tricksey.

'The Mechanic' will surprise you with some of the directions it goes in, but veers off-course a bit.  Simply put- it needed a little tweaking.",1296172800,3,2757,4.7642105263157895
4376251,4,B004HO6HWK,"I am in no way familiar with the original Charles Bronson film The Mechanic from 1972, but that may have actually been a benefit with a film like this. This remake does seem to be targeted toward my demographic though. The Mechanic caters to those who enjoy hard-hitting action films with a lot of blood that spews more vulgarities than you care to keep track of with a fair chance of nudity along the way. Truth be told, if done right those types of films can be massively entertaining and The Mechanic definitely falls into the ""done right"" category.

Jason Statham really seems to be hit or miss when it comes to how entertaining his films are and lately his work just hasn't been all that satisfying. The Expendables left a really sour taste in my mouth, so I wasn't sure how The Mechanic would turn out. However, this film was actually able to put Statham back in top form since it was able to deliver a pretty great story to compliment Statham's bone crunching fight sequences he's become notorious for. Despite the fact that the dialogue is filled with F-bombs left and right, it fit the overall tone of the film very well. Ben Foster wasn't disappointing either. Foster is one of those incredible talents in his early thirties that most people seem to overlook as having endless potential. As far as his performance in The Mechanic, it isn't quite as powerful as he was in The Messenger but seems to be more similar to his role in Hostage yet refined a bit to leave his true motives questionable.

Donald Sutherland also makes the most of his short time on screen. He has two scenes with Jason Statham where he makes two fairly long speeches that seem to stick with you long after his character is gone. That's how short-lived characters in films like this should be; memorable.

The one thing the film falls victim to is the shaky camera during fight and chase scenes. It works most of the time and isn't hard to follow, but there were two scenes involving Jason Statham's character where it was hard to distinguish everything that was being shown because of this technique. It's just when two guys are in a scuffle and they're throwing fists or hurling their legs at their opponent, the camera whipping back and forth at the same time doesn't really help matters. Now some guy's dead, another falls to the ground after we hear a snap, and another is clutching his stomach even though we only saw the main character move twice. The technique gets confusing and either needs to be modified somehow or dropped altogether for something new.

The Mechanic is actually really entertaining and is very much the definition of a guy film. It's packed to the brim with explosions, bloody headshots, broken limbs, and even a hefty and destructive car chase sequence. The film is worth seeing for Ben Foster's performance, but it's nice to see Jason Statham in a film that isn't disappointing for once. Overall, The Mechanic is dark, gritty, bloody, and just a hell of a lot of fun.",1296086400,2,2980,4.638257575757576

Andrews Blu-ray Review: With the films THE MECHANIC and MECHANIC: RESURRECTION you have in one fell swoop a wonderful combination of a Two Movie Collection, and if you are like me a massive fan of Jason Statham, then you are in for a real treat of high octane action. Here we have the relentless invincibility of the hero which is all part of what we expect from a majority Jason Statham action films. But Jason Statham has no room for vulnerability, we find he is more of a hero in combating villains of the evil kind and every time we view Jason Statham he really has a brilliant action packed style. They have also classed him as a Bruce Lee of automatic-weapon fire, so awesomely quick in his decision-making, that he will use his weapon of choice and if that fails he will always has a lightning-fast split-second of ingenuity and combat style. But what of this Jason Statham Two Movie Collection, well here is my review of both films and see if you agree with my conclusion on both films.

THE MECHANIC [2011] Arthur The Mechanic Bishop [Jason Statham] hit man is back in action, teaching us the tricks of the trade. Sleek as a bullet, the action star Jason Statham jaw-clenches his way through the film THE MECHANIC, that gives us a much more powerful recharge. The story pivots on one of those professional assassins in the employ of one of those hush-hush organizations in which men murmur murderous instructions into phones so that other men can die. For a hit man like Arthur Bishop [Jason Statham] this makes for an isolated and very lucrative life style that comes with a swank pad, super vintage car and enjoying nights with the local talent.

That existence takes a turn for the worse and especially complications when Arthur Bishop, after some messy business with a colleague Harry McKenna [Donald Sutherland] forms an unlikely partnership with that associates wayward idiotic son, Steve McKenna [Ben Foster]. With his complementary buzz cut, hard-body profile and hyperbolic masculinity, turns out to be an overly reckless sidekick that soon starts to resemble something of an unreliable hook-up. When Arthur Bishop and Steve McKenna begin firing off their guns in tandem, it certainly looked like the start of a good friendship, but eventually Arthur Bishop realises in the end that friendship was a 100% false hope.

Jason Statham is as solid as ever in his cagey hard-man role which he has made his own through films such as Snatch and Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels which suits his broody characters detached persona perfectly. On the other hand Ben Foster plays his character well, providing a convincing portrayal of a drifting loser whose hot streak and cock-sure arrogance lands him in lots of trouble more often than not and I felt his character was a complete waste of space.

Simon West is a capable action/thriller director and his aptitude comes across in the way THE MECHANIC is assembled and runs like a well-oiled machine, with significant pauses for exposition of high octane sequences. THE MECHANIC seems designed as a vehicle for Jason Statham and, to that end, it serves its purpose. With the film THE MECHANIC and the director Simon West and his co-workers have produced a motion picture that is appropriate and is well worth a Blu-ray release. But as to the final end to the film, I felt Steve McKenna [Ben Foster] was like a fish out of water, who I felt his character was jealous of Arthur Bishop and not a patch on Jason Statham and in the end he gets his deserved comeuppance, as his character was 100% pure arrogance and it would have been a far better film if his scenes were left on the cutting room floor and it proves my point, and obviously his career has gone in decline and good riddance to bad acting.

MECHANIC: RESURRECTION [2016] Arthur The Mechanic Bishop [Jason Statham] is back again as the Hit Man on Cruise Control and at the start of the film MECHANIC: RESURRECTION and certainly isn't mourning his dead protg from the previous film THE MECHANIC. But for Arthur Bishop, there is no escape, especially when his old archenemy, the scheming businessman Riah Crain [Sam Hazeldine], abducts Arthur Bishops new love, Gina Thornton [Jessica Alba], and of course without any hesitation Arthur Bishop is coerced into resuming his former trade and he must deliver three kills for Riah Crain, in his typical signature style: making the assassinations appear to be an accident.

When we first encounter Arthur Bishop, he is enjoying retirement living on a boat in Rio de Janeiro, but as always demonstrates with Jason Stathams savvy character, and it is virtually impossible to stay out of trouble for long in that Brazilian city, and with Arthur Bishop having to violently fend off the mindless minions of the ruthless criminal Riah Crain [Sam Hazeldine] delivering the message that their boss requires his services.

Retreating to an island paradise in Thailand and the safe auspices of his friend Mei [Michelle Yeoh], Arthur Bishop finds himself drawn to the beautiful Gina Thornton [Jessica Alba]. The two immediately become romantically involved, but she's kidnapped by Riah Crain's henchmen and Arthur Bishop is given an ultimatum, either he must dispatch three of Riah Crain's enemies, in each case making it look like an accident, or the young woman dies.

All in all, MECHANIC: RESURRECTION satisfies the action blockbuster that tick all the boxes of being wildly outrageous stunts, exotic locations and high body count but once again, it is definitely a Jason Statham oriented film would not be complete without the arbitrary display of colourful explosions, glorified chases, exaggerated gunplay and a no-nonsense Jason Statham predictably flexing his acrobatic  leaping, climbing, swimming and fighting muscles as if he was participating in his own self-indulgent Olympic games. In the end, MECHANIC: RESURRECTION is probably what most viewers imagined when they heard about THE MECHANIC film sequel was coming through the pipeline and it is just a typical action romp, especially for die-hard Jason Statham fans, especially like me, and finding it a totally good guilty pleasure all round.

Blu-ray Image Quality  LIONSGATE Home Entertainment UK brings you this double action film package with an outstanding 1080p image presentation on a grand scale, and equally impressive is the 2.40:1 aspect ratio viewing experience that is a knockout. This is also a near-reference perfect transfer that never disappoints with both films. With the dramatic scenes we see in both films, makes the Red shot feature films looks spectacular virtually all of the time, making the most of its globe-trotting locations look brilliant. Both films offer transfers that offer superb levels of fine detail in close-ups and a surprisingly warm looking overall palette with each scene you view. Contrast and black levels are solid, and there are no issues with image instability or compression issues.  Please Note: Playback Region B/2: This will not play on most Blu-ray players sold in North America, Central America, South America, Japan, North Korea, South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Southeast Asia. Learn more about Blu-ray region specifications.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  LIONSGATE Home Entertainment UK presents us again for both films a very impressive 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio, which is equally a knockout all round, as well as equally as terrific and engaging. Expect heavy surround usage and dynamic design. Bass gets a fine workout, and rear surrounds are used for more than just stock gunfire and soundtrack distribution. There's plenty of ambient atmosphere here. Dialogue when you could hear it properly was crisp and clean, but at certain times I had a job hearing what they were saying, as certain scenes had the background music over powering their speech, but when it came to a lot of the action sequences the surround sound really kicked in and had a good workout with all the speakers. The front sound design is definitely with noteworthy channel balance. Whether it is cars or bullets, again with both films the action moves from one side to the other with fluid precision and the sound mixes for both films remains distinct and dynamic with room-penetrating clarity, exhibiting outstanding detailing between the mid-range and highs even during the loudest segments. While it's just a shade away from reference, this is yet another top-class mix from LIONSGATE Home Entertainment UK.

Mark Isham also talks about growing up in San Francisco in the 1960s and talks about meeting his music hero Donald Buchla who had conceived and implemented the concept for a modular voltage-controlled synthesizer. We also find out that Mark Ishams first musical instrument was a trumpet and learnt his trade in jazz and classical music, and when a director heard one of his compositions, offered him a job in composing a film score, and because mark enjoyed it so much, decided that was the career he wanted to pursue and really enjoyed composing the music for the action sequences for Jason Statham. With the different locations in Thailand, Mark likes to compose the music differently for the two totally different locations in Thailand, and especially likes to use different instruments to create specialised music for those locations, but most importantly Mark realises that the sound design is a very important aspect of these types of action films.

All the crew really liked Jason Stathan, as he knows how to perform a certain stunts and makes life so much easier when it comes to film his action stunt scenes, and on top of all that Jason really likes to put some input on how he wants his stunts to be filmed. We also get to view some rare behind-the-scene filming. Contributors include: Vic Armstrong [Second Unit Director], Frank DeMartini [Executive Producer] and Jessica Alba [Gina Thornton].

Finally, finally, with the THE MECHANIC / MECHANIC: RESURRECTION [Two Movie Collection] that was directed by Simon West and Dennis Gansel does not rely on high tech gadgetry and keeps most of violence pretty down to earth. The shoot-out scenes are staged without excessive blood and gore, and there are some occasional surprises. Not surprisingly, Arthur Bishop comes off looking immaculate in both films, compared with his murderous colleagues as well as his wicked enemies. Altogether, both films are primarily nuts and bolts of over the top action packed melodrama and especially with Jason Statham being tight-lipped with every performance and his sidekick maniacal mates give us full on energy that keeps you on the edge of your seat right to the very end of the each film. As with both films, especially with the last twenty minutes you usually get a full on assault of grenades, machine guns, and a typical boat explosion. There has been a lot of scathing negative critical reports about these films, especially the second one and I suspect that are non-fans of Jason Statham, but for real enthusiastic fans of this macho muscle actor, like me, you will I know love these two films and critics should not be so pompous about films of this calibre, as I thoroughly enjoyed both films. Highly Recommended!

Jason Stratham has very good fighting skills and Ben Foster is over the top in his role but both are very convincing and dynamic as the main characters. The women in this movie unfortunately are mostly window dressing to keep the men entertained. I did enjoy the ending, though. It caught me off guard. Overall, this is a very good action movie",1515801600,,654,4.5508474576271185

4376538,5,B004HO6HWK,"This remake of the 1972 Charles Bronson film of the same name appears at first like a typical Jason Statham film...lots of action, explosions, a smattering of sex, and plenty of violence.  It's only after it gets a bit into the film that the differences emerge, when the hit man agrees to train his mento's aimless and vengeance-bent son. The speed with which the youngster accepts a killing routine is a little surprising, making one wonder if he's more aware of what happened to his father than he lets on. Because of this, one fully expects a confrontation and showdown between the two and dreads the outcome.

There's little of the usual Statham tongue-in-cheek, for he portrays this character as ice-cold and utterly alone, except for one wistful moment when he's tempted by a waterfront friend to buy a boat and simply fail away.  Because of his complete lack of emotion about his kills, one wonders why he tolerates his ""trainee's"" misbehavior and inability to follow orders, which brings the deaths, previously going unnoticed or classed as accident, into the public eye with devastating effect.

Here's where the twists come in, making this a bit different and an enjoyable film with an ending that I, for one, thought would turn out a very different way..

It's a temptation to rent the 1972 version and compare the two.

This film was viewed as a DVD rental and no remuneration was involved in the writing of this review.
It's a temptation to obtain a copy of the original to better compare the two.

4376584,3,B004HO6HWK,"Well, I am a huge fan of Charles Bronson and the original Mechanic. Truth is I have seen it a dozen times - the most recent viewing was right before watching this remake. Yeah, back to back Mechanics. Now I like Statham. I mean he is no Bronson but his movies are entertaining so I am not going to rip on him...nope, won't do it. Instead I will rip on the writers who I think did a pretty crappy job. Now when you compare the screenplays of the two movies, the first is by far the best. The action is not too over-the-top -it is actually believable. There were many scenes in the remake that were illogical and pointless. It was clear that the remake was relying more on over-the-top action scenes than an actual story. The characters in the first movie were more developed, complex compared to their remake counterparts. It goes to show that no amount of gratuitous nudity and smashum/bashum action will make up for a poorly (or sloppily) written screenplay. The 'hits' in the first movie were carried out more methodically. They required more careful planning and intelligence on the part of the mechanic. The remakes hits didn't make any sense. How in the world did Statham evade the hundreds of guards in full scuba gear and get into the pool? Yeah I know what you are going to say. There couldn't have been a drain that big. And where would it have led to? An underground changing room? At that moment I decided, you know what Jason....I'm watching this for you but you DESERVE BETTER! Lol. I can go on and on but I won't. Watch it. Enjoy it. But watch the first one and don't even think of telling me that the remake was better. If you do then its obvious that you are a youngster who needs gratuitous nudity and explosions and yes.....over-the-top action sequences to keep your attention. Plot and well developed characters.....who needs that!",1486857600,8,1850,4.558558558558558

4377055,4,B004HO6HWK,"Pretty standard Jason Statham action movie, what you're thinking you're going to see for just 90 minutes is exactly what you get here.  Statham's character is a hit man and a very good one at that.  One day he questions his latest assignment, to kill Donald Sutherland, since they wheelchair bound guy is his handler after all.  At an airfield he is told the only Sutherland's character and the guy telling him this info, knew about a team of agents assignment that was ambushed in South Africa so Sutherland's character has to die since he is obviously responsible.  You know full well what the real story is here and you do wonder why Statham's character doesn't straight away jump to this conclusion and take action.  But we wouldn't have this movie if that happens.  Sutherland's character's kid wants to avenge his father's death but is obviously going to end up in jail at best, likely dead so Statham decides to train him up to be just like him.  Another story that has an obvious way it will play out within the movie.

The Mechanic is a movie you watch when you want a movie you don't have to think about.  You know how its going to play out but you just want to enjoy the over the top fights, gun play and explosions along the way.",1475798400,,1241,4.45575221238938

If you've seen one Statham performance you've seen them all, but it's nice to see that the guy doesn't come across as comic relief when working with master class actors like Ben Foster, and Donald Sutherland.

4377475,3,B004HO6HWK,"Jason Statham plays Arthur Bishop, a ""mechanic,"" i.e. an efficient assassin for a shadowy agency that hires out hit men. Often the hits need to look like accidents or to be blamed on someone else. Bishop is great at his job. His mentor is Harry (Donald Sutherland), who is now restricted to a wheel-chair and can't do assignments. Harry can't connect with his ne'er-do-well son, either. A hit takes out Harry. In the aftermath Bishop and the son work together, partly to avenge Harry and partly...well...to keep the story going. The plot doesn't make a whole lot of sense. This is a Jason Statham vehicle, designed to show of his grit and action skills more than to develop nuanced storytelling.

The action is surprisingly sporadic. Some bits are very unbelievable but aren't redeemed by having a fun, over-the-top feel to them. The movie is straight-faced about its drama. Statham is his usual charming self. He's great at the action scenes but they don't showcase his talent like other films (the Transporter series comes to mind). The plot is just enough to string together various action set pieces.",1472083200,,1104,4.903743315508021

4377884,3,B004HO6HWK,"My review is the 387th of this slightly above average movie. When I see a movie in the theatre I Rate it on a scale of 1 to 10, 10 being highest. This movie was a 6.0 out of 10 in my opinion which translates to a Three Star review.

I don't remember the original film too well. I do remember the very ending when Jan-Michael Vincent murders his instructor. That's the only part I remember as I don't think I was born when it originally came out. But I do remember that Vincent's performance was light years ahead of Foster's performance. Just as another reviewer mentioned, it seems as if the training of the protg was too streamlined.

Arthur Bishop was a stereotypical hitman. A ruthless man that one would not want on his back. I will compare this to another similar-themed film called Assasins. Sylvestor Stallone played Robert Rath, a professional killer for hire who also had little remorse. Yet Stallone's character grew softer towards the end and procured a conscience. Too, he wanted out of the business. I never felt that was the case with Statham's character of Arthur Bishop. Yet he did have a code of honor. That meant if his employer lied to him he would get his revenge. Whereas Rath had no problem letting his guard down a bit with a woman (A Weakness A Professional Man Should Never Have), Bishop never did. He would use a woman for sexual pleasure but when the sex was over he felt no attachment and would never tall her anything about himself (Note The Double Bluff He Used On The Escort When He Told Her His Real Name, Yet She Did Not Believe Him & Instead Called Him ""Brad""). A masterful stroke. Simply put, this man was an unapologetic loner.

His mistakes. After killing the arms dealer with auto asphyxiation, he left the room by touching the door and doorknob as did his protg. This would not be done in real life. The protg even left tons of DNA behind after slaying a 6'7 and 300 pound man that in real life would have killed him with ease. Then there were the weird exotic ways he'd kill his marks. Whatever happened to using a high-powered rifle? Yes, he does say that the key is to make it look as if it's an accident. But to me that seems a bit too extreme. The best way to off someone is with a bullet. A professional can take out a mark from 300 or 400 yards away and still have time to make his way out of the area for extraction. The opening scene in the movie was the best scene. Although what would killing the head of the cartel do in reality? There's always somebody else waiting within the organization to take over. The death would have done little if anything to stop heroin and cocaine from entering the world market. Bishop was also familiar with explosives as was noted in the end of this remake. But he did not employ them to much use during the film. Perhaps they (Explosives) were not feasible. One thing he did do quite well was intimidate people. The family he held hostage was terrified to no end. I liked that scene and for that reason and the first scene award this film Three Stars.

I feel this film could have been better with perhaps a tighter script and a more believable protg. I simply did not like Foster and kept comparing him to one of my favorite actors Jan-Michael Vincent. Statham has done many better films and I recommend you see them before you see this one. It's only slightly above average. You may or may not be disappointed if you buy it.

I did, however, like the twist ending which notably separates this film from its predecessor. I'd like to see a sequel. Bishop had great knowledge. Where did he learn it? The mob? The military? That would be an interesting story to learn.

4377951,3,B004HO6HWK,"In recent years, Director Simon West has become known for turning simple action movies into big hits, thanks his unique story lines. The story doesn't actually mean as much in action films as it does in other genres, because as long as people are getting killed and things are blowing up, most action fans are satisfied. Simon West wasn't and in recent years, he has given us some great stories to go along with the amazing action. His most recent film is actually a remake of the 1972 Charles Bronson classic, by the same name. The Mechanic is a code name for CIA hit-man, Arthur Bishop (Jason Statham). For years, the Mechanic has gotten the job done without question, until one day his next target is revealed as his mentor. The stories are similar, but the special effects and action moves are much more intense, and we have Jason Statham to thank for that. This man has single handedly taken action films to another level. For those unfamiliar, the man speaks several different languages, is trained in dozens of forms of fighting, and he's quick with a joke, many of which are unscripted. Every film Statham does is entertaining for his tremendous moves and unpredictability. The Mechanic gives Statham the chance to show off his talents and for that, I loved it, but trying to modernize the original story without changing it all that much, makes things feel a little outdated. I found many things to be tame by today's standards and the film itself does suffer because of it. Statham is paired with Ben Foster and that's problematic for the film as well. Foster is not known as an action star, he's the complete opposite of Statham, and in this case opposites do not attract, they had no chemistry whatsoever. In my opinion, Jonathan Rhys-Myers or Alex Pettyfer would have been a much better choice, but I am just a reviewer. That being said, the Mechanic isn't a bad movie, it has all the moves and wit of a typical Statham movie, but the story is more than a little outdated and aside from Statham and Sutherland, the casting left a lot to be desired.",1431820800,,2061,4.633879781420765

As usual, I knew with Mr. Statham in this movie, I would not be disappointed.  I'm not giving the storyline, and just wanted to present my opinion about the film and its talented star.

4378016,4,B004HO6HWK,"I have to say from the start that I'm not a great Jason Statham fan but that doesn't mean to say that I haven't largely enjoyed the surprising number of films in which I've seen him. Much like Arnie & Brucie, what he does, he does well and it is refreshing that he does the majority of the stunts and fight scenes without a body double. Mind you, that would be difficult; he has an annoyingly excellent bod for a 44 year old bloke (although, no doubt, he spends a lot of time keeping that way).

This film is not startlingly original, thought provoking, subtle or complex. The linear plot and inevitable sub-plot are shallow & obvious and the script is corny but that doesn't stop this being a really good brain-out action movie. There's stuff happening all of the time, Ben Foster is perfectly cast as the whiney looser side-kick, things are going bang all over the place and the body-count keeps mounting. Your intellectual subconscious keeps telling you that you shouldn't be enjoying this but you just can't help yourself; it's just great fun.",1421280000,,1047,4.629032258064516

4378045,3,B004HO6HWK,"While no one would ever mistake THE MECHANIC for a great movie, for the most part it's a competently done hitman/mentor film that makes good use of Jason Statham and never overstays its welcome. The scenario is something that's been done many times before: an experienced (sometimes aging, but not in this case) hitman takes a younger person under their wing as a protege, and eventually they have to confront each other in some way. Not only has this been done before, but this film is a remake of a 1970's one starring Charles Bronson. Not having seen that one, I can't compare the two, but I also won't debate the merits of this new version existing in the first place. It is what it is, and for what it's worth I thought it was enjoyable, if slightly mundane, way to pass 90 minutes.

 The character development is kept to a minimum, as is common for films of this type. Jason Statham's character is (obviously) the most fleshed-out person, but Ben Foster gets enough to do and plays off of Statham's character quite nicely. The one person I thought was underused was Donald Sutherland, as Statham's mentor and Ben Foster's father. He only got two scenes, but he still made the most of his limited screen time. Generally speaking, the acting was decent across the board. Even the main villain, despite being underwritten and a bit generic, was well-played.

 However, the area where this film possibly dips into some murky territory is the ridiculous levels of violence it chooses to show. With the exception of when Statham's character is introduced, there is no subtlety to his process, nor does it go about things in a methodical way to show the intricacies of his profession. Instead, the young upstart basically drags him down and the audience gets treated to explosions of blood and gore that would feel more at home in a ""torture porn"" movie. I suppose that it's another genre trope that the more experienced professional starts to lose his touch a little bit once he takes on a student, but there are some truly ridiculous scenes between the two as they mow their way through all of the bad guys that are coming their way.

 Still, this was enjoyable enough due to Jason Statham's charisma and the levity which Ben Foster brought to the proceedings. I wouldn't hate it if they teamed up again for another movie. And barring the, at times, excessive violence, this timeworn story was told with some efficiency, if a little light on originality. Recommended mostly if you're a Jason Statham fan.",1417478400,8,2505,4.720823798627002

The movie does have a dark side though it lets up here and there to allow a little humanness to creep in.  Its a good action flick with a few surprises thrown in, although if you saw the original, most of it is predictable.  Overall, I liked it for the action and payback aspects.

Sometimes he forms an attachment to a young innocent person.  Sometimes he falls in love with a beautiful young feisty lady who he is transporting to keep her safe.  It is not great theatre or cinema, but keeps moving and usually does not waste time.  It's a way to get away and relax.  My vice. Kind of innocent because at least I don't drink and carouse around.

Though not as 'technically proficient' as Statham's character, Bronson's character seems more believeable to me, and Jan Micheal Vincent a more acceptable student of the dark art of assassination, er, 'mechanix'...  I accepted Stathams character ok, but to take that unmotivated, obnoxious, lazy and subversive son of the victim and turn him into a sucessful 'mechanic' seems counterproductive and farfetched.  How do we know he even had that 'aptitude'?  We don't!  It reeks of connivery in script writing, forcing a part that doesn't fit into the script to 'make it work'... but it doesn't for me.

4378360,4,B004HO6HWK,"The Mechanic(released Jan/11)is a remake of the original starring Charles Bronson. This time around we have Jason Stathamin the lead role as Aurthur Bishop,Ben Foster as Steve McKenna,Tony Goldwyn as Dean Sanderson,Donald Sutherland as Harry McKenna and others. Statham who has made a quite successful career out of being buffed and playing overly intense characters,is in true form here as The hitman everyone likes to hire but with a twist. Before I get into the film story,let me start by saying that the plot synopsis on the back cover on this DVD has it surprisingly wrong. I have never seen one this off where the main plot point is concerned. It says that Statham's mentor gets murdered and that Statham makes it his business to track down the killer.....riiight. Let us see what really happens.
Statham is a hit man for hire. He returns home after a job and meets up with his long time friend and mentor Sutherland.the two enjoy an amiable conversation and part. A new assignment comes up posted by Sutherland's partner Goldwyyn,whom he has a meeting with. It seems his mentor is the new hit,which doesn't sit well with Statham. Goldwyn says that he lost five good men in South Africa because Sutherland leaked the assignment. So now Statham has agreed to take his mentor out.
Statham gets Sutherland out of his office on a ruse,and caps him in an underground parking lot with Sutherland's own gun. Statham looks up Sutherland's only son,McKenna. His father has left him squat and he is at wits end as to what his next move will be. Statham decides to let him in on his assassins life and ways. He assists McKenna in a couple of a take downs. The last one involving a religious leader goes awry and Statham thinks their best bet is to fly away separately. At the airport Statham spots one of the so called dead men from the ""botched"" South African job. He follows and confronts the man,who admits that Goldwyn hired him to assassinate his partners and that he knows that Sutherland's death by Statham's hands was also a set up Goldwyn. Statham takes the man out and then heads out to kill Goldwyn with McKenna's help. After it's over McKenna spots his father's gun in Stathams things and realizes who it was who murdered him. At a gas station McKenna manages to blow up the vehicle he thinks Statham is sitting in. However,one doesn't kill Statham that easily and he indeed saw it coming and managed to slip out of the vehicle before it exploded. McKenna returns to Statham's digs and turns on his turntable,which Statham always told him to never touch. He Then goes out into Statham's garage and steals his prize XKE.Mckenna is barely away from Statham's home when he spots a folded piece of paper on the passengers seat. It says if he's reading this he's already dead. In a moment the rigged car explodes killing McKenna and a switch behind the turntable also detonates Statham's house. Statham is seen getting into a truck he had setup near the gas station,and then leaving.
The plot gets  to a little meandering about half way through,mostly involving his tutoring of McKenna,but it manages to get back on track in the end. Statham is again at his intense best in this film as a man with a mission. Sutherland has a short role in this one but it is a memorable one. The film has alot of heavy hitting action that will please fans of this genre of film. Watch for  New Orleans singer extraordinaire Linnzi Zaorski,who sings ""Better off Dead"",in a scene where Statham goes into a bar.
Technically speaking the film is in its w/s a/r of 2:35:1 and is clear and crisp. Extras include deleted scene,commentary and a featurette.
All in all a nice action mover courtesy of Jason Statham,who has made a very successful career,so far,playing the intense and buffed characters he has become famous for over the past few years. It's a plot with a bit of a nice twist and lots of action. Recommended.",1358640000,,3900,4.675400291120815

Donald Sutherland brings in a brief performance as Stathem's boss. Lots of action and fight scenes to make this worth the price.  Yes, I'd watch it again just to see the stunts.  For Statham fans it's a keeper. As a hitman for hire, Statham turns good when he sees his employer used him.  In any re-make, what can be shown to a modern audience has changed radically since 1972.  The violence isn't too over the top. However it's very much like all of Stanthem's films.",1357862400,,589,4.518867924528302

4378409,3,B004HO6HWK,"The Mechanic (2011) is a remake that takes a few strands from a nearly forty-year old film, and then weaves them into a story that has little of the original flavor.  Directed by action specialist Simon West (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Con-Air/dp/B000X418UO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Con Air</a>, The Expendables 2), the focus is on flashy and spectacular action set pieces, and some mean spirited kills.

When tough guy Charles Bronson played ""hitman"" Arthur Bishop in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Mechanic/dp/B00006FDAP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Mechanic</a>&nbsp;(1972), the paid assassin was still something that was relatively new and fresh.  So while not the greatest action flick around, the story was still of interest because it tread in a dark, mysterious, and forbidden areas.

Today, the term ""mechanic"" is seldom used in this context, and any mystique regarding the paid assassin, has long since gone, as the hitman has become one of the most overused clichs in the action genre.  Similarities to the Bronson version, which featured a killer with some eccentric habits, taking on a headstrong apprentice, are faintly present, but rather than taking a look at men living life on the ""wild side"", the remake is mostly about a master criminal's efforts to stay alive.

Operating out of Louisiana, paid assassin Arthur Bishop (Statham) is troubled when he is given an assignment to kill his close friend Harry McKenna (Donald Sutherland).  Bishop has a conference with his boss Dean (Tony Goldwyn), who provides justification for why McKenna must die.  After Bishop completes the hit, Bishop encounters McKenna's son Steve (Ben Foster), who is looking to avenge his father's death.

Bishop takes Steve under his wing, and begins training him as a ""mechanic"".  On his first job, McKenna demonstrates a stubborn streak that almost proves fatal.  Dean is not pleased that an unauthorized outsider is involved in company business, but Bishop and McKenna continue to work as a team.  After another dramatically untidy mission, Bishop discovers that Dean has lied to him, and that both he and Steve have been scheduled for termination.

The story doesn't have much depth, but with some slick, well executed action scenes, The Mechanic probably provides what most action movie fans are seeking, with brutal fights, dramatic shootouts, frantic chases, and daring escapes presented with a mostly humorless tone.  This approach suits Jason Statham (Transporter films, Crank films, The Expendables films) well, as he plays Bishop as confident, dispassionate, and not given to much conversation.

The new version of Steve McKenna, is a long way from the brash individual originally played by Jan-Michael Vincent.  Ben Foster (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Contraband/dp/B005LAIGLE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Contraband</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/3-10-to-Yuma/dp/B000XRO3MQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">3:10 to Yuma</a>) solidly delivers in the action scenes, but his character just doesn't seem to fit.  There was a 23 year age difference between Bronson and Vincent, and the teacher and student relationship played naturally there.  Although the 13 year span between Statham and Foster is significant, it just doesn't carry the same weight.

In the original film, the third act was an assignment in Italy, which served as a coming of age for Steve, and elevated the movie from just a gritty crime drama set in southern California, to an international adventure.  The remake isn't quite so bold, but those targeted for elimination do help give the movie some color, especially a drug using religious leader.

The way things play out at the finish makes no logical sense, but perhaps with an eye to the future, the film puts a new spin on the iconic ending featured in the Bronson original.  The Mechanic isn't a bad movie, but the days when a hired killer was a truly provocative subject, have long since past.  The return of Arthur Bishop while not unwelcome, may not have been really necessary.",1348531200,,4177,5.778140293637847

He's no Bruce Willis, Jet Li, or Sylvester Stallone.  I would like to see a lot more emotions on his emotionless facial expressions.

This movies story line fell a little short for me.  Killing Donald Sutherland, and then pretending it was not him by going after the real killers, made no sense to me.  I know he had to do it, but to have him work with the son in finding the real killers baffled me even more.  It was obvious the son was going to find out sooner or later.

Unfortunately he is asked to kill his wheel chaired mentor...which he does!  Then he takes the victim's son under his wing and trains him to be a killer also.  Now can you figure out what's coming?

4378450,4,B004HO6HWK,"This is a remake of a 1972 Charles Bronson movie, but I have not seen that one so I can't compare it to this one. Don't confuse it for the Transporter movie franchise even if it stars the same man and the word mechanic would make you think cars. This movie (and what it excels in) is about the fine art of assassinry (if that's a word). Not shooting people, but slipping in, killing them and making it look like natural causes without anyone ever knowing you were there. Jason Statham plays the Mechanic ""Bishop"" who is hired to assassinate a lot of men and who shortly after the movie starts gets an apprentice. It is not a buddy movie, there are no comedic quips. The Mechanic stays with a serious tone. Bishop trains the apprentice in his art of assassinry, and the apprentice is quite sloppy which leads to the bigger action sequences. Predictably gun fights with security officers and other assassins come after them.

The plot is predictable and it is still a good movie if you can get into it, but I can see how some might call this movie dull at first, without crazy action sequences, car chases or explosions (until much later). There is good cinematography and a lot of locales, everything from lush drug mansions to dirty street ghettos. Some nice spy technology gets used.",1321574400,,1284,4.558441558441558

The movie is about an assassin who is given a target and him killing his target.  But the devil is in the details, and he must not leave any trails.  Jason Statham is really good as Mr Bishop, the assassin.  When the target given to him is his closest friend (Donald Sutherland), he does not have a choice but to go ahead with the assignment.

This movie is probably not for everyone.  But for me it worked well, I enjoyed the whole movie.  Lot of action, few special effects, great story line.  What else would anyone want?

4378482,3,B004HO6HWK,"The 2011 ""Mechanic"" is an action thriller starring Jason Statham, with some bloody fistfights and shootouts, plus occasional explosions. The stunts are very good and the leading actors Statham and Ben Foster are not bad, but don't expect originality or surprises. Ignore the film's clichd storyline and one-dimensional characters. This is an action film with a modest budget, and is enjoyable as such.

Jason Statham is Arthur Bishop, an elite contract killer who believes ""the best jobs are the ones nobody even knows you were there."" And he never disappoints his employer Dean (Tony Goldwyn), whose recent assignment involves assassination in a heavily guarded location. Bishop's presence should not be known by anyone (other than the target, who gets killed anyway).

Things get complicated and messy when Bishop's latest target happens to be someone he least expected. After that, Steve (Ben Foster, excellent), a young and angry son of Bishop's mentor Harry (Donald Sutherland: excellent but too brief), shows up before him. Bishop takes Steve under his wing, training him as a perfect ""mechanic."".

""The Mechanic"" is a remake of a 1972 film starring Charles Bronson and Jan-Michael Vincent. Not having seen the original, I have nothing to say about it. The updated version, set in New Orleans, is directed by Simon West, whose CV as director includes ""Con Air"" and ""Lara Croft: Tomb Raider,"" and produced by Millennium Films and Nu Image.

Despite its recycled story and uninspired direction, ""The Mechanic"" is a reasonably entertaining action film with some nice stunts.",1313366400,,1577,5.246031746031746

The fights are good, without too much reliance on quick-cutting, and none of the irritating extreme close-ups that are so in vogue right now. It's occasionally brutal, frequently grim, and likely forgettable.

4378489,2,B004HO6HWK,"Much has been made about Jason Statham being the great white hope for old school adrenalin pumped action, to be fair he has a better chance than some of his contemporaries, but that chance dwindles each time he makes a second rate actioner like ""The Mechanic."" This is the type of movie nonsense that just a few years back was located on video store shelves exclusively, the stunts and violence are a little better visually, but the script is just as awkwardly thrown together out of cliches from previous actions movies and dialogue that just barely makes the characters form of communication above grunts and whistles. Ugh. Statham's acting is limited too and he can be easily miscast, as he is here as a remorseless killer.

This is a remake of a 1972 movie&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Mechanic/dp/B00006FDAP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Mechanic</a>&nbsp;with Charles Bronson, while a better movie script and casting wise, it is dated, but not necessarily ripe for a remake. This storyline, older assassin training a younger person to be a killer, is pretty well worn, it does turn banal awfully quick, as it does here. Director Simon West can shoot the hell out of an effects heavy violent action scene, but that results in some outrageously absurd action scenes. The Bronson film put thought before explosions, director West may never have had a thought that didn't involve an explosion.

Still, I must give credit to Ben Foster, giving an intense performance than never once let's you see that he knows this material is beneath him. Donald Sutherland, an old pro, who can steal a scene from anyone and light up an entire movie, is wonderful for all three minutes of screen time he has. The other actors play characters who just wonder through the movie either to be killed or to kill, a few woman show up for sexual purposes, but nothing more.

This is the kind of movie that leaves you empty and cold. Not because of the subject matter, it's not taken seriously enough for that. Nor is it the characters, their is no depth to them for that. It's just such trite material, it can't work up any emotions at all. If Jason Statham hopes to fill the shoes of Stallone, Van Damme, Lundgren, Arnold or Bronson, before them, he needs to start making films with some sort of emotional center. His&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Transporter-Collection/dp/B000FKO3WG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Transporter Collection</a>&nbsp;is a better example of Statham filling their large shoes, here he plays a hero we give a damn about, he is easily likable in most roles he plays, but none of that comes across here. In the end, the Stath ends up as dull as the film itself, but an amiable hero such as he, will have another go around, let's hope that one lives up more to the promise. If it doesn't, Shia La Beuf may be the next action legend. Ugh.",1310601600,,2942,5.0995850622406635

I admit that I have not seen the original with the great Charles Bronson so have no comparison on that front. As far as how the story goes I like it. I am also a fan of the assassin/hit man genre and this was definitely on par here. 4.5/5.0 for that.

The story was fast paced and the acting was alright. Donald Sutherland played a good part for the short time he was there. Ben Foster was ok in his role, nothing overly fantastic but played the part of a young gun know it all as good as anyone. 3.5/5.0

The extras on this Blu-Ray were lacking to say the best. Deleted scenes were ok but no optional commentary. No commentary on the movie and the featurette on the stunts was fairly cool but limited. All in all a disappoinment as far as Extras go but then when you look at this movie how much more could there have been? Maybe the director discussing how they went about doing the remake. 2.5/5.0

Overall, I will watch this movie again. This is up there with Statham flicks like Cellular and Chaos but not as cool as say the Transporter movies. 4.25/5.0 for a Statham flick.

About the remake
This is a very loose remake of an old Charles Bronson movie by the same name.

That movie, while dated, is special.

This movie loosely follows that same idea with a lot of modern updates. - more action, less dialogue, bigger explosions.",1306886400,,934,5.390410958904109

I do hate the fact that the globalist keep trying to get us used to seeing and hearing British people for their return to ruling the US!  This film was not over the top and the stunts and killing was more realisitc than his other films.  To me, this is what helps me accept Statham more than his Transporter films.

4378556,4,B004HO6HWK,"Producers Irwin Winkler and Robert Chartoff have dusted off the screenplay by Louis John Carlino and remade their early seventies Charles Bronson vehicle 'THE MECHANIC'-1972 by turning it into a high gloss, crisp nail biter under the direction of action auteur Simon West. This version as the original resembles a western in its construction as we have the professional gunfighter becoming a teacher in gun play to an amateur who's father the gunfighter has assassinated and will escalate the revenge motif in the climax of the film.  It is almost a carbon copy of screen writer Luciano Vincenzoni's script to the Lee Van Cleef/John Phillip Law Spaghetti Western  'DEATH RIDES A HORSE' aka 'DA UOMO A UOMO'-1967 but naturally without the intrigue. I will go to see anything with Jason Statham who seems to select his action roles with great aplomb and this one has all the moves that we can expect from him.  Ben Foster who dons the Jan Michael Vincent role and who literally stole Director James Mangold's '3:10 TO YUMA'-2007 right from under the noses of Russell Crowe and Christian Bale makes a great partner for Statham until the excellent climax. Donald Sutherland shows up as Staham's mentor and his presence lingers throughout the proceedings.  Fans may clamor for Director Michael Winner's original but you can't deny the power of this films action sequences as West denounces character development in favor of rip-roaring set pieces.  The music score is by progressive jazz writer Mark Isham and Sony Entertainment releases it in a sharp 2.35 transfer enhancing the photography by Eric Schmidt.  Whether he flits through the films of Guy Ritchie and throttles his way through the 'TRANSPORTER' franchise, Jason Statham continues to be the king of the action genre and the modern day movie industry is all the better for it.",1306627200,4,1832,5.009868421052632

There were deeper thought moments.  The acting was pretty good. It had interesting character interactions. Many of the actors faces I recognized. The plot even ended up having a little twist.

Statham plays Arthur Bishop; a veteran hitman who takes Steve, the son (Ben Foster) of an old comrade (Donald Sutherland), under his wing and shows him the ropes of his profession.  Steve is a natural, and it isn't long before both men embark on a bullet-ridden joyride of sorts.  While a good chunk of the central elements of the original film are left intact, this new take on The Mechanic is too slick for its own good.  Statham's Arthur Bishop is much more an invulnerable super-spy type here than Bronson's was, and while Statham and Foster do good jobs in their respective roles, neither can help the generic and predictable screenplay.  There is some good action to be found however, even if the end result of the film doesn't even come close to holding a candle to the original.  All in all, you could do far worse in terms of action films, but you'd be better off sticking with the 1970s The Mechanic instead.",1306368000,,1149,4.663366336633663
4378570,4,B004HO6HWK,"There is something akin to a guilty pleasure to watch bad guys get knocked off - DEXTER supplies that on television and now Jason Statham plays it on the screen.  Yes, hit men or assassins or mechanics have been the subject matter of many films, but there is something about the manner in which the ultra virile yet heart of gold Arthur is brought to life by Statham that makes us root for his every move.

John Lewis Carlino wrote the story and the screenplay for both this (with Richard Wenk) and the original 1972 version of THE MECHANIC and the 40 intervening years have not change the end results much.  It still is a film with spiky dialogue and a good mixture of watching bad guys gradually get their deserts.  Now it is Arthur (Jason Statham) who is the flawless, perfectionist, leave-no-mess-behind hit man that everyone in the assassination business wants to hire.  His methods - the opening sequence as Arthur kills drug cartel leader Jorge Lara (James Logan) is as imaginative as actions such as these come - are impeccable.  He is called upon to off an old colleague Harry McKenna (Donald Sutherland) which is a feat in and of itself, but soon after he meets up with McKenna's wild son Steve (Ben Foster) and gradually teaches the lost Steve the role of a mechanic.  From then on it is fireworks with Arthur and Steve fulfilling jobs assigned to them by the smarmy Dean (Tony Goldman), with Steve finally taking on a job by himself - killing the bulky 6'7"" Burke (Jeff Chase) during an assignation attempt. But things change when Steve realizes the relationship between his father's death and his new 'partner' and this leads to a finely choreographed surprise ending.  Simon West knows how to stage action scenes and how to manipulate CGI realistically, and he allows his characters to be sidetracked by worthy wenches just to keep it real. Mark Isham delivers his usual powerpunch musical score (with frequent help from Schubert's Piano Trio No. 2 in E flat major - Arthur's tranquilizer.

The picture quality was average at times, with a great deal of exteriors having that grainy look, but other times the clarity was above par. The DTS is as expected from Sony and it rocks nicely with the various explosions and gunfights. I was disappointed with the lack of extras, but they include:

* movieIQ. The standard IMDB-on-your-screen-while-watching. The best trivia was in the making-of.
* Alternate opening, deleted scenes, 10:46 minutes. The alternate opening made no sense but the deleted scenes definitely removed some character development for the Sutherland/Statham friendship. The long scene of Foster/Statham at his truck towards the beginning has nothing different except that they had to muddy the rear-view mirror (in the film) because it showed the entire crew accidentally.
* Making of, 7:47 minutes. Too short, but still had some decent background on filming, including Foster's injury which then makes sense (what I thought before seeing this was a significant writing error) as to why they filmed Foster having to kill left-handed; especially since he says he is not a lefty in the film.

4378631,3,B004HO6HWK,"***Spoiler Alert***

This remake of the classic version from 1972 with Charles Bronson had some things right, but overall it really falls short of even competing with the original, let alone besting it.

The 1972 film had a sort of detached coolness and a more visceral grittiness. These were professionals who did not get emotionally involved with the assignment. Jan-Michael Vincent's ""Steve"" wanted to prove he had what it took to be at, what he perceived, an elite level. Also there was a late 60s, early 70s counter-culture subtext to his motivation. And that was really interesting. Whereas the analog in this remake comes off more as a listless wanderer who has no clear idea what he wants to do, but he thinks it would be cool to kill people and he is emotionally overcome by the revenge aspect.

Another fault I found was in the actual killings themselves. There was no detachment and precision. It was just raw death by torture in many cases. Sloppily fighting with the target, or shooting your way out of after a botched hit. Too much of the tired, formulaic ""Hollywood modern action"" was written and you lose all the nuance, the art of the kills which these mechanics would care about (even perhaps more than the monetary reward).

Hollywood films these days tend to assume the average movie viewer is a moron, so they try to connect as many dots for us as possible. This is patronizing and downright offensive. The match up between the old and new Bishop illustrates this glaringly. Bronson's Bishop was about control, he was in supreme control and his downfall was letting his emotion hinder that control. Everything he did was calculated. And this was no brute, he was a cultured assassin. I felt that the writers tried to convey this with Statham's Bishop but it came across very hammy (the numerous shots of his record player) and forced. Also time and again in this remake we saw a Bishop that seemed to be driven by almost pure emotion, a reactive Bishop who was never in control except marginally in the opening hit.

This remake emphasized over and over the revenge motif and I think it was a mistake having Bishop go after the Company. This was never even a possibility in the original film and I like that because it established a boundary that even Bishop had to recognize. It's the cheesy desire in Hollywood action films for the main character(s) to always get retributive justice by their own hands. I see this time and again these days and it gets very tiresome.

This remake shows that a vastly bigger budget does not equate with better film making.

Regarding pacing the remake seemed a bit too fast, however that wasn't surprising.

I am torn regarding the ending. On one hand I like the fact that Bishop bested Steve and lived to see another day in this remake. However philosophically I must give a slight edge to the original film in which both of them die because the narrative is stark: in this business of death there is no clear winner. I think even the first film should have explored some of the moral issues a bit deeper and may even had a redemptive dynamic, but that would be clearly a different sort of film.

So to sum up, this remake was enjoyable as a modern action film, but if you want a bit more depth and nuance see the original!",1298246400,7,3280,4.612349914236707
4378632,4,B004HO6HWK,"I knew this was going to be a good movie when Jason Statham got naked within the first 5 minutes.

I saw this movie after a really rough day at work, so I zoned out during some of the dialogue in the beginning and missed some plot explanations. Luckily, there wasn't much dialogue after that and a lot of Jason Statham kicking ass so it was still fully enjoyable. This is such a dude movie - violence, blood, sex, explosions - and I loved every minute of it. The greatest thing about this movie is that there's no romantic relationship getting in the way. No pretty girl to distract or reform Arthur Bishop - he's a badass and remains a badass without any unnecessary complications.

And can I just say that I absolutely love a badass who listens to classical music and is extremely organized and methodical. Who wears soft grey knits.

Sadly, I'm realizing that I've become quite squeamish in my old age. I used to be a longtime lover of horror flicks, the gorier the better. Now I find myself cringing and shutting my eyes with just the anticipation of possible bloodshed. Though I don't know what kind of person who wouldn't cringe at the sight of a harpoon being stabbed through someone's calf.

Also, I'm pretty sure that this is what Jason Statham actually does in real life.

4378633,3,B004HO6HWK,"Lacking originality and surprise, The Mechanic is nonetheless enjoyable for the action sequences alone.  Awards it will not win, and there is quite a bit for a viewer to dislike, but the fast pace keeps the parts shiny despite the lack of polish.

Arthur Bishop (Jason Statham) is a hitman who does everything perfectly, lives in a secluded multimillion dollar house, and gets his jobs via a hitman's version of Craigslist.  Not quite as hyper or entertaining as his roles in the Crank movies, Statham nonetheless toes the brooding, meticulous line of someone in that line of work.  It's believable, I suppose.  His mentor and confidant Harry Foster (Donald Sutherland) worries less about the next target than he does his own son Steve (Ben Foster), an aimless troublemaker itching to find his niche.  As the assassination business goes, complications lead to Harry fostering a relationship with Steve, who wants to emulate the Spy vs. Spy routines of which his father spoke so highly.  Probably a bad idea since Steve is a drunk.

While I probably liked this movie more than most, there were numerous problems that will relegate this film to a future in the Walmart $5 bin.  First and foremost, the tension in the action is great, and there are several white-knuckle scenes, but if I had a nickel for every millisecond cut I would have been able to watch several better movies the night I watched this.  That is my new pet peeve.  The cuts during several spots were so fast they were nearly subliminal.  It's a shame, too, because the gunplay and stunt-work in the movie are superb.  The headshots fly through with force and gusto; someone really wanted to ensure there was no doubt with a quite a few deaths.

Regarding the story and the plot, that's clearly not the point of this movie.  Well, maybe it is, but originality surely isn't.  I don't mind brainless movies - happens to be one of my favorite genres - but please make at least one aspect of the movie unpredictable.  This may as well have been a silent film with a caption that read, ""Hitman goes through training,"" before showing Statham and Foster in their machine gun montage.  Speaking of that, you'd think there would be more to being an elite hitman than a few random medical books and assorted time in the backyard range.

The moment that ruined the movie for me, however, was Ben Foster's ridiculous reenactment of Kevin Bacon's infamous ""so mad I have to dance"" scene from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Footloose/dp/B00005JKYI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Footloose</a>.  Thankfully there was less angst and grand mal seizure in Foster's rendition.

I expected much more for cast like this remaking of such a good movie.

I entered and left the movie with the same thought: ""If only James Frain were in this...""

1. For a movie that tries to make you root for Steve, the killings... oh dear. West was clearly going for shock value, but I somehow felt sorry for the people being killed. So depressing and grotesque.

2. The pair go around and into other's places, and they don't wear gloves, leave plenty of fingerprints, and yet they aren't once suspected of murder.

3. Honestly, if Bishop knew that he'd get into pickle with his boss, why did he even bother with Steve at all. A good assassin would be professional and not go out of his way to train some drunkard douche and kill him later.

4. What was the point of the O'hare bus fight??? I know Bishop wanted him out of the way quick, but why bother putting his work aside for the sake of killing some random guy??

5. On that note, how did no one notice a fight on a bus, but just a guy getting hit with a car after being tossed out a window?

6. The ending. Steve is like 20 KM from the gas station and this is a wireless detonator. How is that even possible????? There HAS to be some distance limit. That was such bullcrap.

7. The acting is terrible. Statham, an actor I usually love, was limited to 2 emotions (if you can call them that): 1. ""Don't bother me, I'm trying to figure out who this target is"" and 2. ""Don't bother me, I'm trying to make sure the job is done correctly"" Ben Foster mumbles his way through the film, I literally could not understand WTF he was saying. You thought Ray Winstone's mumbling in Edge of Darkness was bad? Ben is FAR worse. His lines needed English subtitles.

8. Better than 80% of the film was reaction shots with no dialog, of people standing around looking shocked. The rest of the film is jargon-filled exposition heavy dialogue and about 5 minutes of actual action.

9. LAZY ACTION SCENES. I'm tired of going to action films and getting sick because the director has a problem with people being able to see what's going on. Shaky camera and quick cutting must die, I'm tired of it.

10. When I walked out, I felt depressed and sick, like I just ran 4 miles and ran face first into a brick wall. I was excited, but this was just bleak, boring and lame, and I am a Jason Statham fan.

I have not seen the original, and I must say I CERTAINLY don't plan on it any time soon. Avoid.",1296432000,17,2385,4.275555555555556
4378635,5,B004HO6HWK,"I saw the original movie the""Mechanic"" back in the 1970's. This movie starred Charles Bronson as Arthur Bishop the
hit man and Jan Michael Vincent as his understudy. The new movie has Jason Strathem in the role of the professional killer Arthur Bishop. Ben Foster plays the role of Steve McKenna Bishop's killer in training. Bishop kills a Columbian drug lord. He then recieves an assignment to kill McKenna(Donald Sutherland. This was his acrual mentor.
Bishop carries out a few more assignments when he is approached by McKenna's son Steve to teach him the art of being a contrsct killer. Sreve helps in carrying out some of the assassinations. He does one solo and nearly gets killed himself. Bishop's employers do not like a new player in the field. They finally send out contract hit teams to get Bishop. Bishop turns the tables and kills his former bosses. Steve McKenna blows Bishop's truck up trying
to gain vengance. There is a shocking ending that will dazzle you. See this movie. This one is as good as the original.",1296345600,5,1027,4.775280898876405
4378636,3,B004HO6HWK,"Dropping the brooding existential themes and rich character development of its source material, ""The Mechanic"" ends up being a preposterous predictable tale of betryal and retribution.  Clearly lacking in creative story ideas, the appeal of this film is in its shameless sleeze. The dialogue is needlessly profane, the characters are trashy with more than a few offensive stereotypes, the sex scenes are sweaty and nude, and the constant bloody violence is shockingly impactful. The fight scenes are most memorable; all being incredibly primitive and brutal with lots of painful enviroment interaction that will have you cringing.  Even the gun play has more ""umph"" than usual, the bullets slamming into their targets like sledge hammers.

Unforunately, director Simon West is pretty unreliable when people aren't beating the crap out of each other or blowing their brains out.  Working with a huge budget, he piles on the contemporary action cliches of loud music, fast editing, close ups, and shaky camera work....which wouldn't be bad if he wasn't so damn sloppy. Some high concept stunts and car trashing end up being forgettable blurs of color and sound. And sadly, Statham really can't be his lovable self in this one. Straddled with a more serious silent character, he can't wisecrack during the action and his few moments of thoughtful downtime involve him sitting around and looking dumb. Vertically challenged, chain smoking, over actor Ben Foster is bratty and annoying...as usual. Some great unintentional comedy as he struts around his house listening to an ipod, dancing and having some sort of fit.  In a brief but memorable performance, the ancient wheelchair bound Sutherland is surprisingly touching.
