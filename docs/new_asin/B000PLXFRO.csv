8192307,4,B000PLXFRO,"This video has touched upon the basics and suggests a standard routine upon which to launch added techniques. If you are not familiar with sports massage and need some basic coaching, this video should help you get started. I prefer Michael McGillacuddy's video presentation as body mechanics are better explained.",1468454400,2,314,5.3

8192309,4,B000PLXFRO,"I bought this dvd when I was out of school for about 2 years. I did have sports massage in school but apparently I didn't remember that much of it and up to that point in my profession, I hadn't needed to use sports massage. It was a great review and quite a few customers complimented me on techniques I learned from the dvd.",1381968000,2,326,4.109375
8192310,5,B000PLXFRO,"This video was very informative and well made, I would recommend it for all massage therapist that is interested in diversity.",1376870400,3,126,5.0476190476190474
8192311,1,B000PLXFRO,"I don't even know where to start from...I have the impression that after watching the entire DVD i might have counted 2 or three simple Swedish massage techniques. I don't understand why this is called ""sports massage"", I was really very very disapointed.",1340755200,5,255,4.953488372093023
8192312,3,B000PLXFRO,"I'm currently a studying to become a licensed massage therapist and am extremely disappointed that 'sports massage' isn't one of the classes offered in my studies.  Trying to gather as much information as possible on my own - I purchased this video at a local massage supply store.  The explanation, demonstration, and timing for each massage is useful - but the techniques are extremely basic and most of them are strokes I already knew.  This video just reassured I was on the right track.  I do like the demonstrations on injury management and different techniques to use for different situations... but overall, I guess I expected or was looking for a little more.  My quest for pre/post event massage information continues.",1312502400,7,728,4.983471074380165
8192313,4,B000PLXFRO,"Although many of these techniques were familiar from massage school, this video really shows how to put them together and when it is appropriate to use them. She also goes into nice detail about which techniques to use for which issues - the video comes with a summary book that describes the disorders & associated techniques, which is a nice reference tool. I found it to be very helpful, and it gave me more confidence when I did my first event massage.

Note - if you have taken a course in sports massage, then you probably won't learn anything new from this, but if you are new to it, then it is a good introduction.",1201305600,20,622,4.408695652173913
