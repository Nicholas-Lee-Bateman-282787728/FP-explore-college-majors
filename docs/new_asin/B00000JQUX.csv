5073462,5,B00000JQUX,"From a time when TV was a means of informing and educating, Wild America brought to the living room the great outdoors and the wonder and beauty of ""the wild"". Growing up, this was the way we got to visit places and watch environments we'd seldom get a chance to see personally. It still does that. And thanks to the publishers, Amazon, and the internet, you can get that any time you want - online.  (Isn't technology wonderful?)
Unlike the indoctrination propaganda being pawned off as ""documentaries"" today, this series will educate you with observable facts and give you a deeper appreciation and respect for the Wild America that still exists, just outside your protected back yard.
Enjoy!",1393632000,4,694,4.88135593220339

8513773,3,B00000JQUX,"These are pretty good documentaries for their time, although I've never enjoyed Marty Stauffer's narration. I can't put any of these on the level of anything from National Geographic, but they're free, and you get to see (or be reminded of) what the 70s were like.",1428019200,,264,4.760869565217392
