2554163,5,B000F7CN6C,"Samoa Joe reminds me of a modern day Mike Awesome, Bam Bam Bigelow, or Undertaker (when he was in his prime) about a wrestler in a big body but yet can wrestle, fly & move quick like a crusierweight.  You'll hear Samoa Joe throughout this DVD talking about various subjects like his TNA debut, his family's business, his early jobs & breaking into the wrestling business, thoughts on the Unbreakable match, his submission styles, what he does in his spare time, his temper including a story about an incident that happened in high school, the highs & lows of his career, and his reasons behind joining TNA.  DVD extras include a music video, a picture slideshow, and extended interviews of him talking about growing up & what he does in his spare time.

Matches Include:
vs. Sonjay Dutt - This was Joe's TNA debut and left quite an impression on everyone.  Joe displayed power moves that you didn't see from the X division at that time while being able to move as quick as Sonjay Dutt for his size.  Dutt got some moves in but overall, Joe dominated Dutt.
Slammiversary '05

vs. Delirious - This was a quick squash match for Joe with the only thing noteworthy was the one crazy abdominal stretch he used during this match.
""Impact"" June '05

vs. Chris Sabin - Unlike how he debut against Dutt was a showcase for this, this was a real competitive match.  Sabin took the fight to Joe in this match as he pulled off various moves that you didn't expect such as a tornado DDT & a running powerbomb.  Joe held his own here and even did a series of morphing one submission hold into another at one point before Joe got the well deserved victory.  This was one of those matches were both men came out strong against each other regardless of who won.
No Surrender '05
(Best Of The X Division Vol. 1)

vs. A.J. Styles - Christopher Daniels was at ringside doing commentary during this match which was also finals of the Super X Cup tournament (or the ""Christopher Daniels Invitational Tournament"" as he described it).  A majority of the time that you get any combination of Styles & Joe & Daniels in a match, your going to get a quality performance.  It's hard to describe their matches because words don't do it justice but it should be noted how A.J. showcased his strength that you normally don't see from him against by doing various moves like Lex Luger's ""Torture Rack"" & a bodyslam.
Sacrifice '05

vs. X Division Champion Christopher Daniels vs. A.J. Styles - This was the match that has made history on so many levels.  This was the first time where the X Division Championship main evented a PPV and the quality of this match has gone down as one of the greatest (if not THE GREATEST) matches in the history of TNA to where it's still referenced to this day every single time two of these two wrestle each other.  It's another match where you just have to see for yourself as words wouldn't do it justice but I need to make note that you'll get a laugh out of the opening moments where Daniels taunted both men & ended up paying for it.
Unbreakable '05

vs. Jushin ""Thunder"" Liger - This was setup to be a dream match as one of the best of the ""X"" division style against one of the greatest of that same style of all time in Liger.  It should be noted that both had impressive respectable entrances such playing to their heritage such as Joe's with the samoan dancers (and there's an interesting story behind that told on this DVD) along with Liger having the streamers at ringside.  Unfortunally, this was disappointing by the fact that they didn't go as long as expected for a dream match but it was good for what they did but the fact that it was so short did hurt it.
Bound For Glory '05

Elimation X Match w/Christopher Daniels, Alex Shelly, Roderick Strong vs. Chris Sabin, Matt Bentley, Sonjay Dutt, Austin Aries - Great Survivor Series type battle between these eight with alot of the famous high spots & actual wrestling by each wrestler. However, the aftermath with Samoa Joe & Christopher Daniels is more memorable than anything else as it was one of the most brutal beatings in TNA history.
Genesis '05

vs. Amazing Red - This was another short dominate Impact squash but pay attention to the clothesline Joe gave Red that flipped him inside out.
""Impact"" Dec. '05

X Division Champion AJ Styles vs. Samoa Joe - It's no secret that the series between these two & Christopher Daniels were the talk of professional wrestling for a year & this match was no exception. A.J. was out for revenge against Joe for breaking the ""unwritten"" code of the X division where it was all about the competition.  This was intense to the point where at one point & throughout the rest of the match, Styles had his lip bleeding because a chuck of it was missing & yet still fought hard against Samoa Joe.  Back & forth action which again goes with what I said earlier about how you get QUALITY whenever you get any two of these three in the ring together.

vs. Jay Lethal - Just like the other Impact matches, this was a quick dominate squash by Joe.
""Impact"" Dec. '05

vs. Christopher Daniels - Daniels came seeking revenge for what Joe did to him at Genesis along with the fact despite the fact that he wasn't 100%.  You really saw Joe turn into a assassian during this match as Daniels tried & even got close to beating Joe on a couple of occassions but Joe targed Daniels head, busting him open, and just repeatily punishing his head to the point where Daniels couldn't defend himself and A.J. Styles did what he felt he had to do.

In the end, if your a fan of high wrestling quality then get this DVD...no questions asked!",1146787200,12,5620,4.483333333333333
2554164,5,B000F7CN6C,"For some reason I have been putting off buying this dvd since it came out. I always said ""Eh, I'll buy it next week."" Well, three years and two months later I did and let me say Samoa Joe is a beast. It's not completely like his Ring of Honor work but it's just as good. Especially the matches with AJ Styles and Christopher Daniels. my only complaint is that the Ultimate X rematch with Joe, Styles and Daniels isn't on this.",1205280000,,426,4.2073170731707314
2554165,5,B000F7CN6C,"Samoe Joe made me a TNA fan. His matches against AJ Styles and The Fallen Angel are pure classics and I have yet to see a bad match put on by this guy. He is almost like the Bret Hart of the new wrestling world. His chops and kicks always make me cringe and the musclebuster is probably one of the best moves in wresting today. The only problem I have with him is how TNA is treating this guy. Kurt Angle has been put over Samoa Joe in the pecking order in TNA, among other wrestlers including former WWE guys who cant even hold Joe's jockstrap. Samoa Joe should have at least held the world title once by now, but I guess TNA has other plans for the guy. I love the dvd and its great for any wrestling fan. I hope to see Joe hold the TNA world title soon.",1186963200,,756,3.9802631578947367
2554166,5,B000F7CN6C,"-Samoa Joe is a great talent, not just for his appearance, but for his uniquie style and for the fact that he can move as fast as he can for his size, 6' 2"" to 6'-3"" and about 280 lbs.

-This DVD is a great showcase of Joe in 11 matches against opponents like Sonjay Dutt, AJ Styles, Christopher Daniels, Jushin ""Thunder"" Liger and more.

-Slammiversary '05-vs. Sonjay Dutt: Joe's debut and what a debut it was, he destroyed Dutt, despite Dutt getting in some quick offense. This showed some of Joes' best offensive manuvers, including his muscle buster and kokina clutch for the win in about 6 minutes. 8/10.

-Impact-June 24 '05-vs. Delirious: Weird opponent for Joe, but a fairly quick match. Delirous barely got any offense in at all. Not bad, but a basic squash that lasts just over 3 minutes. 6/10.

-No Surrender '05-vs. Chris Sabin: Great match, Sabin gets in some good moves (a great looking tornado DDT and a second rope running powerbomb among them) and even tries to beat Joe with the Cradle Shock. Joe's four move combo, (powerbomb, STF, crossface and double ring stretch) looked awesome. Sabin almost wins, but in the end Joe hits his Muscle Buster and Kokina Clutch for the win in about 14 minutes. 10/10.

-Sacrifice '05-Super X Cup Tournament Finals-vs. AJ Styles: Hard hitting battle, great back and forth action for a while, AJ even bodyslams Joe early on. Joe gets another combo going in this match, (powerbomb, boston crab and STF, all in fluid motion). Loved when Joe used Terry Funk's rolling tumbleweed, great classic move. AJ like Sabin almost wins, even uses a toture rack into a slam on Joes, but Joe wins, thanks to a run in by Christopher Daniels, with the Kokina Clutch in about 15 minutes. 10/10.

-Unbreakable '05-X Division Title 3-Way-vs. AJ Styles vs. Christopher Daniels: The best match on the disc, maybe one of if not the best match I've seen in a long time. This is a great showcase of the three man with each getting in an equal amount of offense. Joe and AJ team up on Daniels in the beginning, with dueling kicks and chops, but things quickly break down. Tons of fantastic moves by all three men, but some of the best are a great shooting star press by AJ to the outside on both men, a twisting suicide dive by Joe on the other two and so much more. AJ wins, with a roll up on Daniels in about 23 minutes. Not enough can be said about this match, watch and enjoy. 12/10.

-Bound For Glory '05: vs. Jushin Thunder Liger: The entrances by both men were awesome, Joe did a native dance and Jushin was showered by steamers from the fans, much like in Japan. The match itself was not bad but not as great as it could've been. These two were great together in the ring, but the match seemed short. Some good dueling offense and some dueling (Liger.. Joe) chants from the fans. Liger even hits the Liger Bomb on Joe but Joe wins with the Muscle Buster and Kokina Clutch in about7 minutes. 7/10.

-Genesis '05-Elimination X: w/Daniels, Shelley and Roderick Strong vs. Matt Bentley, Austin Aries, Snojay Dutt and Chris Sabin: Good match done in elimination style (like Survivor Series in WWE) and it was more of a build-up to Joe turning on Daniels. But the offensive displays makes this match worth watching. In the end, Joe went to hit Sabin with the Muscle Buster but Bentley pulled Joe out of the ring and Daniels hit Sabin with the Angels Wings for the win in about 23 minutes. Aftermath saw Joe brutalize Daniels and then he hit a Muscle Buster on Daniels on a steel chair. 11/10.

-Impact-Dec. 8, 2005 vs. Amazing Red: A quick squash of the returning and high flying Amazing Red. However, Red does get some quick offense in when Alex Shelley on the outside accidentaly distracted Joe, while Shelley was filming the match. But Joe just as quickly nails a snap powerslam and then the musclebuster and kokina clutch for the win in about 2 minutes. 6/10.

-Turning Point '05-X Division Title Match: vs. AJ Styles: The second best match on the disc, AJ comes so close to beating Joe but Joe hits way to many kicks and chops and combo moves for AJ to stand. AJ does get in a lot of moves, but Joe overcame all of it and got AJ in the Kokina Clutch after reversing a roll-up, AJ passes out and Joe wins the X-Division Title in about 19 minutes. Aftermath saw Joe beat up AJ and went to hit a Muscle Buster on the chair, but Daniels came in to save AJ. 11/10.

-Impact-December 17, 2005: vs. Jay Lethal: Decent match, Lethal gets in a few moves, but Joe wins in the end, with the Muscle Buster and the Kokina Clutch in about 3 minutes. 7/10.

-Final Resolution '06-X Division Title Match: vs. Christopher Daniels: Good match, Joe beats down his opponent after some early offense from Daniels. He does come close to beating Joe, with some quick moves, but Joe continues his assault on Daniels concussed head, with a Muscle Buster and after that Daniels can really stand up. Joe hits another Muscle Buster on a steel chair, a massive kick to Daniels head another and knee drops to the head. AJ throws in the towel for Daniels, after about 15 minutes. Not a great finish, but a good match. 8/10.

-After every match there are comments from Samoa Joe including, why he chose TNA, his childhood, how he started in wrestling and his injuries among others.

-The extras include:

-A slideshow showing some of Joe's best moments.

-A music video: More highlights of Joe in TNA. Decent music.

-Bonus Interviews: Joe talks more about his childhood, playing sports, how he got into Judo and what he does during his free time, among other things.

-This is a great DVD, all the matches are worth watching especially the Unbreakable 3-way and the X-Division and the title matches vs. AJ. Well worth about $15-20.",1167177600,2,5732,4.537790697674419

2554168,5,B000F7CN6C,"Samoa Joe, as a performer, has taken wrestling by storm, and if you wanna know what all the hubbub is about, this DVD is the PERFECT place to start. If you have even a passing interest in pro wrestling, you must own this. It's cheap and the matches on here are simply unreal. The Unbreakable match in DVD quality is worth the price of admission alone, and that's just ONE MATCH. You also get EVERY PPV match Joe was in from his debut to Final Resolution, including the two A.J. classics, the Elimination X from Genesis, the Daniels rematch, the Sabin bout from No Surrender, and more. Plus Joe gives a lot of great interviews on everything from how he broke in to how he very nearly gave up on wrestling (NO!) before he signed with TNA (YAY!).

2554170,5,B000F7CN6C,"TNA Wrestling is very smart on how it's playing it's roster.  They aren't rushing into throwing a wrestler they feel should be a superstar down your throat.  They are taking their time...VERY SMART! They have nothing but time and they use their roster well.  Examples: Alex Shelly, great wrestler, but the angle with Kevin Nash and now you have a charater.  Now that they know they have a character...the T-shirt just came out on the TNA website. Another example, ""The Alpha Male"" Monty Brown...main event wrestler (TNA created) but just not ready for the ultimate push as World Champion.  But TNA is taking their time...and Monty will be World Champion one day!  And then you have Samoa Joe.  ROH Wrestling created, great wrestler and established! Now with the national exposure of TNA Wrestling, Samoa Joe is hall of fame superstar in the making.

This DVD chronicles Joe's start in TNA to very recent matches. If you never caught Joe in ROH Wrestling now's your chance to get acquinted.  Too small to be a heavyweight but too big to be stricly an X Division wrestler.  Samoa Joe is a veteran and very professional entertainer.  He defenitely carried a recent match between him & Sting versus Jeff Jarrett & Scott Steiner.  I believe that these other three legendary wrestlers had to step it up to keep with the active Samoan.

The matches on this DVD are his Pay-Per-View matches from Slammiversary and other PPVs. With perks like Joe vs. The Amazing Red from Spike TV's TNA Impact show. I'm so glad they put this match on this DVD. I seen Impact results from the TNA website and seen the match took place and wanted to see it very badly. And with me being deployed to Iraq was unable to watch on Spike TV.  But I bought the DVD and bam there it was! Very Satisfied!

Great DVD! Great Matches! and Samoe Joe is a Great Wrestler! Awesome DVD...be sure to purchase all the TNA Wrestling DVD releases plus their line of house shows (not shown on television) from the highspots.com website.  Samoa Joe vs. Christian Cage has already taken place at a TNA house show. Great Match!

Keep it up TNA Wrestling and I'm looking forward to tuning in every Thursday on Spike TV when I return home.",1151107200,,2187,4.624352331606218
2554171,5,B000F7CN6C,this dvd is great. It showcase the talent of samoa joe. the thing I like about tna that it sets the bar in wrestling. if you want wrestling and not entertainment I suggest strongly to buy this dvd.,1150588800,,197,4.2105263157894735
2554172,5,B000F7CN6C,"I'm a long time WWE/F fan, TNA fan since the first Wednesday PPV, and I ROH fan since the first show which I attended, and I have to say this may be the best wrestling DVD I've ever purchased.  I've been a fan of Joe since his ROH debut vs. Low-ki, and enjoyed his work in that promotion very much, in fact I still do, but this dvd is on a whole different level.  This DVD display's Joe at his absolute best again and again.  In between the matches, which I will briefly discuss, there are interview segments with Joe talking about his life and his matches.  While they are brief, there are some great moments, where Joe tells some memorable and amazing stories.  Joe comes across as a genuine person, with passion and enthusiasm for the business.  The production quality is top notch as well.

To me Joe is the total package right now, easily the best wrestler in America.  He has the power and strength that he uses so well to deliver his incredible offense.  He is very fast for anyone let alone someone with his size.  His facial expressions inside the ring and his mic work outside the right are unmatched right now.  But the reason his matches are so highly rates, the reason why there is so much emotion in all his matches, is the way he sells for his opponent and makes you believe that he can loose at any time.  His debut match vs. Sonjay Dutt would have been no more than a squash by another wrestler, yet Joe puts over Sonjay's offense very well and makes you forget about the size difference.  His match with Chris Sabin in my opinion is one of the best matches of the year.  As the DVD continues, that can be said about almost every match. The 3-way with Christopher Daniels and AJ Styles is THE best match of the year to me.  An unreal display of wrestling in 2006 as it should be.  Hard hitting, innovative, fast, exciting, crisp and emotional!  This DVD is worth its price for the entrance for his match with Jushin Thunder Liger, it has to be seen, I think its fantastic.

If you are like me you may be bored by most of what you see on WWE.  While the wrestlers are very talented they are often not given the chance to shine, with short matches and restrictions on what they can do.  These matches with Joe are on a whole new level.  If he keeps this up the way he has thus far, if won't be long until volume 2.  If you like wrestling, purchase this DVD.",1149552000,3,2372,4.271300448430493
2554173,5,B000F7CN6C,"This looks to be TNA's best ever DVD. Nearly all the matches are a must see.

June 2005

vs. Sonjay Dutt (**1/2) Nothing really special about this one. I've only watched it once. Dutt gets some offense in, but of course Joe pulls out the victory

July 2005

vs. Chris Sabin (****1/2) A strong contender for match of the year 2005 and the most under-rated match in TNA. This is the classic ""young lion"" vs. ""unstoppable monster"" match. Both wrestlers told a great story.

August 2005

vs. A.J. Styles (****3/4)

The finals of the Super X Cup tournament. A.J. and Joe prove while they are two of the best in the business. The only thing that holds me back from giving it 5 stars is the fact that it's overshadowed by the following match

September 11, 2005 (Unbreakable) (*****)

vs. Christopher Daniels (X-Division Champion) vs. A.J. Styles

This is it folks. The most talked about match in TNA and the match by which every other TNA match is judged. This, not Barbed Wire Massacre was the match of the year for 2005. Every real wrestling fan knows this. Some people are going to say it's over-rated because it's a spot fest. It's not. The spots are well placed and make sense. These 3 do things you've never seen in a ring. They tried two more times to recapture the magic of this one, but didn't come close on both occasions. This is the match that you show your friends who have never seen TNA.

October 2005

vs. Jushin Thunder Liger (**)

Too short. May be the worst match on the DVD. I honestly don't remember this match too well.

November 2005

with Christopher Daniels, Roderick Strong and Alex Shelly vs. Chris Sabin, Matt Bentley, Sonjay Dutt and Autin Aries (****)

Another exciting X-Division match. This match is significant because it was the start of Joe's heel turn

December 2005

vs. A.J. Styles (X-Division Champion) (*****)

Wow. If the Unbreakable 3- way didn't happen, this would be the match of the year. A.J. gets some offense in, but Joe proves to be too much. Me typing about it, doesn't do it justice. See it for yourself.

Not only is he the most unstoppable man in TNA Wrestling today, but he also has had some of the best matches in TNA wrestling history as every man from Sonjay Dutt to Christopher Daniels and AJ Styles has fallen at his devastating Muscle Buster move...

Extra Matches that HOPEFULLY will be in their entirety:

Samoa Joe vs. Sunjay Dutt:

This was Joe's TNA debut in which he crushed Dutt after several minutes of taking some moves from Dutt but then finishing him off to start his [almost] year long undefeated streak. 7/10

No Surrender

Chris Sabin vs. Samoa Joe:

Great wrestling match. The high flying, technical Sabin meets the powerful, train charging Joe. Sabin takes a beating in the beginning but then fights back and even drop kicks Joe into the steel barricade. The fight back in the ring and Sabin even gives a running powerbomb to Joe which causes the crowd to go crazy. In the end Joe gives a great Muscle Buster and puts Sabin in his submission move to win the match. 9/10

Sacrifice 2005

Samoa Joe vs. AJ Styles:

One of the best matches of 2005, just as good as their one on one match at Turning Point [Which is also included in this DVD.] AJ does a lot of high flying moves outside the ring onto Joe and Joe counters with MASSIVE kicks to the face and does his best unstoppable glare as AJ is down. Samoa Joe wins [Once again] 10/10

Unbreakable 2005

X Division Championship

Samoa Joe vs. AJ Styles vs. Christopher Daniels [Champion]

FANTASTIC Wrestling Match! All three men put on the best match of the year, maybe even the new millenium. Highlights inlude Joe and AJ kicking Daniels in the back multiple times while the crowd cheers them on. The match goes faster as every minute goes by. Joe even dives out of the ring onto both AJ and Daniels. Aj Styles wins the title after pinning Daniels. Samoa Joe's unpinned streak continues. 11/10

Bound For Glory 2005

Samoa Joe vs. Jushin Thunder Liger:

To be honest, I was a little disappointed. This match was less than 10 minutes, I was expecting 20. Not that these two didn't work well, they were great. Liger jumps out of the ring onto Joe and Joe fights back by ramming his knee into Liger's face. In the end Joe wins once again with his muscle buster. 8/10

Genesis 2005

Elimination X Match

Samoa Joe, Christopher Daniels, Alex Shelley and Roderick Strong

vs.

Sonjay Dutt, Matt Bently, Chris Sabin and Austin Aries

Another great wrestling match. 20 minutes of pure non-stop action [which is what TNA is all about] The ending comes down to Joe, Daniels and Sabin. Daniels tags himself in, much to Joe's surprise, and pins Sabin for the win for his team. 10/10

[I don't know if they are going to show Joe attacking Daniels after the match with a steel chair or not]

Turning Point 2005

X Division Championshp

Samoa Joe vs. AJ Styles [Champion]:

About as good as their Sacrifice match [My Opinion] High flying moves, and a great moment when Aj Styles even powerbombs Samoa Joe! Despite AJ's best efforts, another man fell to Joe's unstoppable Muscle Buster. 9.5/10

Final Resolution 2006

X Division Championship

Samoa Joe [Champion] vs. Christopher Daniels:

I'm glad they put in Joe's first title defense in this DVD. In the storyline Daniels came back to attack Joe for what happened to him at Genesis. The result was a match at Final Resolution. Some back and forth action and even AJ Styles makes an appearance. Daniel's gets busted wide open and Joe did a lot of crazy eyed expressions as he stood over the Fallen Angel. The only problem was that AJ threw in the towel and ending the match by forfeit, declaring Joe the winner. Weak ending but good match. 9/10

This DVD is something that should be picked up when you get a chance to. I just wished they included the second triple threat match at Against All Odds earlier this year between AJ, Daniels, and Joe because it would have been even better to end the DVD with Joe victorious again in the rematch of the legendary first match. Oh well, this is still highly recommended...",1147392000,10,4090,4.552667578659371
2554178,5,B000F7CN6C,"Samoa Joe is a special kind of wrestler.  He's quite agile for his size and uses some brutal offense that is really fun to watch.  Prior to TNA, I've seen him tear it up in the indies for more than a year, specifically Ring of Honor, where he has had (and is still having) great matches, from the epic trilogy with CM Punk to the brutal match with Kenta Kobashi.  When he came to TNA, I was happy to see that he hasn't changed how he wrestles.  He pretty much re-invigorated the X-Division when he came in, giving the division a whole new dimension.  This DVD features some excellent matches he had in TNA last year, most notably the awesome first three-way he had with AJ Styles and Christopher Daniels.  I've only been able to see them online, so it'll be great to have some better copies of them.  For serious wrestling fans looking for a breath of fresh air, this DVD is definitely worth checking out.",1147132800,,905,4.383233532934132
2554179,5,B000F7CN6C,"I have been a wrestling fan since February 2003 and I have watched WWE,TNA,and ROH but out of all the great wrestlers they had no one could compare to Joe. I got to follow his entire ROH title run from it's very beginning in March of 2003 to it's end in december 2004. Joe faced and beat the best in wrestling like A.J Styles,The Briscoe Brothers,C.M Punk,Chris Daniels,Homicide,Colt Cabana,Trent Acid,American Dragon,and Chris Hero. Then Joe came to TNA and started tearing it up from the moment he got there in classics with A.J Styles,Chris Daniels,Sonjay Dutt,Chris Sabin and others along with two reigns as X-Division champion under his belt. I have either seen or heard about many of the matches on this DVD and even though Joe has only been in TNA for a year keep in mind that in ROH he became champon after being there six months. Go out and but this DVD as soon as it hits shelves it's sure to be a collectors item.",1147046400,,924,4.505952380952381

8118588,5,B000F7CN6C,"Unstoppable: The Best Of Samoa Joe was a great DVD and a breath of fresh air compared to some others all of these matches are at least OK most of them will have you out of your seat with your eyes glued to the tv screen here is what the DVD holds:
Samoa Joe vs Sonjay Dutt Slammiversary 2005
Samoa Joe's first match in TNA. its an ok match. it gives you an idea of what joe's moveset is
Samoa Joe vs Delirious TNA iMPACT!:
once again nothing special just a short match on here
Samoa Joe vs Chris Sabin No surrender 2005:
THIS WAS AWESOME! one of my favorite matches on the disc. if you haven't seen this match i strongly encourage you do. you get submissions, high flying, all sorts of wrestling and spots, fun stuff a great X division style match.

Samoa Joe vs AJ Styles For the Super X cup Sacrifice 2005:
 ANOTHER GREAT ONE! in this match Joe seems to be on his game more than usual with violent kicks and SICK submissions AJ puts on a great show as well being one of the only wrestlers to take joe to his limit (next to sabin in the previous match) so this gets a thumbs up as well

The Unbreakable Match:
 YES THE UNBREAKABLE MATCH IS ON HERE!!! if you haven't seen or heard of this match you must watch this. there are many great spots on here as well as technical wrestling as well as some parts that are kinda funny. easily THE BEST MATCH ON THIS DVD!

Joe vs Jushin Thunder Liger Bound For Glory 2005:
 the one and only liger makes an impact at tna as he takes on the samoan submission machine. i liked this match ok but the only issue is that it isn't as long a match as i wouldve wanted couldve been a few minutes longer but other than that solid match.
the elimination X match Genesis 2005:
Good match really showcases the X division well and the beating joe puts on Daniels is very brutal.
Joe vs AJ part two Turning Point 2005:
 another great match with these 2. in my opinion the sacrifice one was better but i still enjoyed ths match
Joe vs The Fallen Angel Christopher Daniels Final Resoultion 2006:
This was another good match it had me wondering what would happen next in the match good stuff.
Bonuses: during the DVD Joe talks about his life,his family, and his career. you get a photo gallery, and you get a music video.
my top 3 reasons to get this DVD are
3:Joe vs Sabin
2:AJ vs Joe (Sacrifice)
1:and of course the unbreakable match
if you love professional wrestling or know someone who does,this DVD is a great buy so i suggest you stop reading this and start buying!",1325116800,,2493,4.2357894736842105
8118589,5,B000F7CN6C,"I have seen my share of brutal wrestling but this has to be some of the best quality and brutal bouts I have ever seen! Samoa Joe was a beast! This covers June of 2005 until January of 2006. Let's get to it:

June 2005

Vs. Sonja Dutt - This was Joe's debut and it was devestating! Except for a few moments, Dutt was pretty much dominated here!

July 2005

vs. Chris Sabin - Arguably Joe's stiffiest test at this point as he took on one half of the future Motor City Machine Guns! While Joe was dominant, Sabin gave him a run for little bit before falling to Joe! Excellent match!

August 2005

vs. A.J. Styles - This was the finals of the Super X Cup and these two proved why they were and still are two of the best in the world! Even the run-in by then-X Division Champion Christopher Daniels doesn't really spoil this match!

September 11, 2005 (Unbreakable)
vs. Christopher Daniels (X-Division Champion) vs. A.J. Styles - This match is legendary in TNA lore. I personally call it one of the best Triple Threat Matches ever in wrestling, not just TNA! These guys did things I had never seen and it deserves the praise it gets!

October 2005

vs. Jushin Thunder Liger - Good match but it should've been longer! With a guy like Joe and a legend like Liger, this match should've been a show-stealer! As it was it was a good match but it is arguably the WORST on this DVD compared to the other matches.

November 2005

with Christopher Daniels, Roderick Strong and Alex Shelly vs. Chris Sabin, Matt Bentley, Sonjay Dutt and Autin Aries - This bout was an excellent X-Division 8 man elimination tag team match BUT that isn't the story here! Watch what happens after the match! It made even me (a hardend fan of 26 years) even cringe!

December 2005

vs. A.J. Styles (X-Division Champion) - In response to what happened at the end of the previous bout, A.J. Styles (the champion) CHALLENGES Joe to this match! Styles and Joe put on another classic but Joe continues his win streak and takes the X-Division title in the process.

January 2006

vs. Christopher Daniels - In this match, Daniels seeks revenge and the X-Division title from Joe but Joe eventually savages Christopher Daniels so bad that A.J. Styles had to throw in the towel to save him! Brutal ending to this!

Overall, this is an excellent purchase! There are three more matches that were not discussed in this review featuring Delirious, Amazing Red and Jay Lethal which were pretty much squashes that lasted under 5 minutes or less so I left those out! We also get to hear from the man himself on this release too! Excellent purchase whether used or brand new!",1309478400,,2623,4.513742071881607
8118590,4,B000F7CN6C,"This DVD had many great matches, but the pace was killed by including worthless Impact squash matches, that literally only last a minute or two. If you got rid of all of them, they might have included another great match instead, like the Against All Odds rematch.",1295481600,,264,4.638297872340425
8118591,5,B000F7CN6C,"Vs. Sonjay Dutt - This was Samoa Joe's debut match in TNA. From the debut, you can see Joe bringing something new to the table that has never been brought before. Joe dominated the majority of the match and in the process showed everyone the agility, power, quickness, and submission skills he brings to his matches. Good match and a dominate debut for the ""Samoan Submission Machine."" 4/5
SLAMMIVERSARY '05

Vs. Delirious - Another than Delirious running around the ring 20 times before the match, this is just a squash match that displayed, once again, Samoa Joe's powerful dominance and a wicked abdominal stretch. 2/5
TNA ""IMPACT"" June '05

Vs. Chris Sabin - A fter debuting a month before and unlike his debut match against Sonjay Dutt, this is the first real competitive match Samoa Joe has had since his arrival in Total Nonstop Action. This time around Samoa Joe gave people a better sense of what he is all about competing in a match that isn't all one sided unlike in his match with Dutt. While his first two matches were fly by bouts for Joe, this match with Chris Sabin was his first real challenge in TNA. 4.25/5
NO SURRENDER '05

Vs. AJ Styles - This was the finals in the Super X Cup Tournament with the X Division Champion Christopher Daniels doing commentary (as he referred to the tournament as the ""Christopher Daniels Invitational Tournament""). Joe and Styles is a pairing when everytime they compete in a match against each other, no wrong can be done. This is just a match that words can not describe everytime you get a performance like this from two outstanding and gifted wrestlers. It ends when Christopher Daniels gets involved allowing Samoa Joe to pick up the win which helped to set up the 3 Way Match for next month at Unbreakable. 5/5
SACRIFICE '05

Vs. X Division Champion Christopher Daniels Vs. AJ Styles - This was the first time in TNA's history that an X Division Title match was main eventing a Pay-Per-View and you could see why it deserved to go on last after the quality of action all three wrestlers brought to the match and all the while how special this match in particular was. This is just another one of those kind of matches that words can not describe while it is arguably the absolute GREATEST match in TNA history. This is a match you just have to see for yourself to admire the greatness of it. 5/5
UNBREAKABLE '05

Vs. Jushin ""Thunder"" Liger - Man, TNA knows how to start off a Pay Per View! After a huge Samoan entrance from Samoa Joe, Joe and Liger went out there and absolutley tore down the house with the Live TNA fans into every minute of the match. The only downfall I have to point out is the match duration. Being an opening bout of TNA's major show of the year and rightfully being a ""dream match"" in the eyes of many, it's rather a short bout which is disappointing. But you can't deny the fact both guys brought their A game because they did. 4/5
BOUND FOR GLORY '05

Elimination X Match: w/ Christopher Daniels, Roderick Strong, & Alex Shelley Vs. Chris Sabin, Sonjay Dutt, Matt Bentley, & Austin Aries - This was a good Elimination Rules style match that has superb wrestling and a strong aerial display between each other. Though, the aftermath between Samoa Joe and Christopher Daniels will be remembered the most thanks to the bloody and unexpecting beating Joe puts on Daniels. 4.25/5
GENESIS '05

Vs. Amazing Red - This is another short and dominate match from Samoa Joe that occurred on Impact. Nothing noteworthy here except for the nasty clothesline Joe gives Red early in the match with an appearance from Alex Shelley (which he almost regretted for coming out in the first place!). 1/5
TNA ""IMPACT"" Dec. '05

Vs. X Division Champion AJ Styles - This match was for A.J. to gain payback on Samoa Joe for injuring him and by the intensity A.J. had, you could tell he meant business and was ready for a fight to the point he had a busted lip and still fought hard against Samoa Joe. Like their match at Sacrifice, these two had one heck of a match that again, no wrong can be done when these two square off against each other. A back & forth clash between the two that will go down as a classic! 5/5
TURNING POINT '05

Vs. Jay Lethal - Again, another squash match on Impact that displayed Joe being dominate like every other time. 1/5
TNA ""IMPACT"" Dec. '05

Vs. Christopher Daniels - In a same comparison to A.J. Styles, Daniels was here for payback for the beating he recieved from Samoa Joe at Genesis despite the fact he wasn't 100%. So Joe targeted the fact Daniels wasn't 100% and capitalized on it while bloodying Daniels in the process. Daniels fought hard but it wasn't enough to defeat the ""Samoan Submission Machine."" 4/5
FINAL RESOLUTION '06

Overall, this is a great DVD of argubably the best ""big man"" in the wrestling business today! If you're a fan of solid and hard hitting wrestling, get this DVD....you will not go wrong with it!",1280534400,,4921,4.549152542372881
8118592,5,B000F7CN6C,"Normally, I would come out here & give an introduction to the product that I am reviewing but there is nothing much that I can add to Samoa Joe that hasn't been said before (in fact, check out DP's review as he perfectly describes what Samoa Joe really is) as he is without question one of the best big-man performers that I have seen in all of my years of wrestling to the point where I think he should be acknowledged with the best of them such as The Undertaker, Bam Bam Bigelow, Mike Awesome & Vader...add Joe to that list. This DVD features some of his best matches (at the time) along with comments from Joe throughout the DVD like how he got started in wrestling, his move to TNA, his MMA training, worst injuries etc.

Matches Include:
vs Sonjay Dutt. This was just a dominate performance from Joe in his TNA debut as he showed some sick power offense and quickness that none of the other X-Division stars have seen before him.
(Slammiversary '05)

vs Delirious. A quick squash match showcasing Joe as a monster.
(Impact June '05)

vs Chris Sabin. I remember during this time that Joe was squashing all of his opponents but this was the first that I remember seeing in which someone took the fight to Joe which is what the underrated Sabin did. A really competitive match with Sabin pulling off some offense on Joe that nobody had done during this time while Joe showed signs of his future greatness with his stiff ""shootfighting"" style of stiff kicks & submission holds while at the same time showing that for a man his size is still capable of moving quickly & do what the other X-Division wrestlers can do as well.
(No Surrender '05)

vs AJ Styles. This was the finals of 2005 Super X Cup Tournament Finals to determine the number one contender for the X-Division Title with the champion Christopher Daniels providing commentary & being very entertaining throughout the match including naming this match ""The Christopher Daniels Invitational"". Unlike how some of the matches on this DVD, this was a highly competitive match as Joe & Styles (along with Daniels) have that natural chemistry to deliver high quality wrestling matches & this was no different. Just high impact & speed along with moments of Styles showing his underrated strength including picking up Joe in the torture rack. The ending with Daniels didn't take away from this contest & actually added more to it.
(Sacrifice '05)

vs AJ Styles vs X-Division Champion Christopher Daniels. Due to how the previous match ended, this one was made in its place. Honestly, this is one of those matches that I can try to explain but really words won't do it any justice as this was not only the first time that the X-Division title was on the line in a main event match but this is actually my favorite TNA match of all time. Everyone brought their A game & did what they do best which was put on a wrestling clinic for the ages. Check out the opening sequence as it was very similar to the beginning of the Taker/Rock/Angle triple threat which was hilarious as well.
(Unbreakable '05)

vs Jushin ""Thunder"" Liger. Before the match, Joe came out to a memorable entrance that is worth hearing from him before the match is shown along with Liger's special Japanese tribute entrance. This was during the time that TNA was having their competition against New Japan Pro Wrestling. This wasn't the instant classic that fans were expecting but for the time that they did have, this was a great action-packed match with Liger being able to use his offense against Joe.
(Bound For Glory '05)

Elimination X Match: w/Christopher Daniels, Alex Shelley & Roderick Strong vs Chris Sabin, Matt Bentley, Sonjay Dutt & Austin Aries. The rules to this match was similar to how WWE did their annual Survivor Series matches so with that stipulation, this non-stop action with great wrestling & high flying moves appearing one after another but pay close attention to the end that lead to an aftermath of Daniels getting perhaps one of the worst aftermath beatings in the history of TNA.
(Genesis '05)

vs Amazing Red. Joe shows once again why he was considered a monster by dominating this match but pay attention to the end as you see an intense staredown between Joe & AJ Styles hyping up...

vs X-Division Champion AJ Styles...this match. This was perhaps the most personal feud on the DVD as Styles was not only out to defend his title but to get revenge for what he felt Joe has done not only to Daniels but to the image of the X-Division. As you would expect anytime that you see Joe vs Styles, you are in for a high quality encounter with both men being very aggressive throughout as Styles took the fight to Joe right from the opening bell while Joe had to resort to stiff offense just to keep AJ away that even lead to Styles having a severe bloody lip.
(Turning Point '05)

vs Jay Lethal. Just like the previous matches at the early start of the DVD, another dominate performance by Joe.
(Impact '05)

X-Division Championship vs Christopher Daniels. This was Daniels' return from the beating he received back at Genesis. Just like the previous Styles match, this was just a great quality encounter with the story being told that Daniels was not 100% which played a factor so many times in this contest to the point where Joe was just absolutely ruthless that lead to AJ Styles making an appearance to do what he felt was right. This match lead to their rematch at Against All Odds.
(Final Resolution '06)
