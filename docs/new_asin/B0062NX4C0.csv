8491323,5,B0062NX4C0,The lead lady could act and she is hot.  Likely she was paid.  I doubt the rest of the actors were were paid.  $200 can only go so far.,1526083200,,135,3.586206896551724
8491324,5,B0062NX4C0,This movie was just the right amount of 80s cheesy to be lovable.  It was definitely funny. :),1521504000,,94,4.222222222222222
8491325,5,B0062NX4C0,"Awwww, cute. If you don't like the premise, you won't like the movie. If you do, you can forgive low budget and no particular sparkle in the camera work. This is for fun.",1518739200,,170,4.181818181818182

8491327,5,B0062NX4C0,"You just have to love this movie! It's so dated, but that just adds to the charm. It very much has the feel of all those made-for-TV detective movies of the era. It's so much fun to see these actors in their prime, and I adore the ""Marilyn Monroe"" theme. Also, if you love the hair and clothing of the era, it's especially enjoyable.",1510704000,,333,4.21875

8491329,5,B0062NX4C0,"Loved the story! The ghost is obviously inspired by Marilyn Monroe, and the movie has the same feel as a lot of detective movies released around the same time. If you like: Her Alibi with Tom Select, or Love Can Be Murder with Corbin Bernsen, you'll probably like this movie as well.",1469836800,,283,4.461538461538462
8491330,5,B0062NX4C0,"This lightweight comedy featuring ""Taxi"" star Jeff Conaway, Judy Landers as the ditzy ghost of a murdered actress and Audrey Landers as the level-headed writer who helps uncover her killer will never qualify as a cinema classic, but it's a fun romp all the same.",1454284800,2,262,4.844444444444444
8491331,5,B0062NX4C0,"This picture was released in 1989 starring Audrey Landers as Angela Reid, Her sister Judy Landers as Billie Blaine and John Matuszak as Chuck Aaron.

Billie wants Angela to help her prove that she didn't ****** ****** 30 years ago. Now a few thoughts on this movie! I loved this movie because it starred Judy Landers. I think Judy is one of the most beautiful actresses back in her time. She was excellent in playing the role of Billie Blaine. Based on Judy Landers alone I give this movie 10 weasel stars.",1389571200,,1050,4.38974358974359
