2952879,5,B000VT6NEC,"Got a call from a friend (Elvis fan) saw this collection avertised on TV. Insisted I purchase it for him and he'd reinburst me.

Checked the price on Amazon and got it for about 1/3 the TV price.

Great transation. Not really a fan but enjoyed the dvd, lots of great concert footage and tons of interviews, backstage and personal stuff. Definately worth the price.

Too bad lot of the filming was not in HD back then. Would have been nice to add a cd of the songs with the dvd.

Lucky its a DVD, Friend would have a VHS  worn out by now, has watched it a least a dozen times.",1264550400,5,575,4.098214285714286

Definitely would order again from this seller.

2952881,5,B000VT6NEC,"We saw this advertised on TV at a much higher price. Went on Amazon. Com and ordered at a cheaper rate and it was shipped immediately.  Good quality. My hubby is a Big Elvis fan and kept talking about this DVD series so I ordered it without his knowledge and he has watched it a couple of times already.
