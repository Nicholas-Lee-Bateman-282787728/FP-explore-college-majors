2474993,4,B000DN5VFS,"As a fan of Project Runway, I was thrilled to learn about Seamless, a documentary of the fashion world and young designers.

I truly enjoyed Seamless as it did portray the reality of the fashion world and struggles of the young designers to make it.  (Like Heidi Klum always say, ""one day you're in; the next day, you're out"".)  These designers are aware that fashion is highly competitive where many don't make it or experience short-lived success before folding.  Those that are still existing and struggling, especially after 9/11, are in dire need of finances or mentorship.  This is where Vogue, noted fashion designers and other ""head honchos"" come in to help out, via competition.

I do wish that the documentary was longer by following the other designers or by covering more aspects of fashion designing, production, etc.  I liked how the documentary followed their personal lives, which made them like regular people... Doo-Ri and the fire, Alexandre and his transcontinental separation from his wife, and Lazaro and Jack's adjustment to one's relocation.

Overall, I truly enjoyed Seamless as it was educational yet entertaining.",1159142400,17,1140,5.157608695652174
2474994,4,B000DN5VFS,"I'm a fan of Project Runway and found I liked this little documentary very enjoyable.  Seamless gives us a very real look into a struggling fashion designers world, no 8 hour challenges, no making clothes from flowers; just real people trying to get their struggling business to become a thriving, money making business.  The 3 featured designers/design partners had all different personalities and made me want to go research them more.",1151798400,22,437,5.140845070422535

8102430,5,B000DN5VFS,"I mention this because when I did a search for Anna Wintour on amazon, this dvd did not come up. She appears to have been a driving force behind the contest described in this program and she's certainly a force in the world of fashion.

I'm interested lin fashion as a business (investment), and I thought the judges' comments were interesting in that regard. I wish there was more discussion of that.",1378598400,,401,4.569444444444445
8102431,3,B000DN5VFS,"Relatively interesting insight into the lives of 3 up-and-coming designers; the content is decent, albeit nothing memorable or noteworthy. I mostly felt compelled to write a review because of the poor filming--it was like someone removed autofocus on a point-and-shoot camera and gave it to a 3-year-old to wander around with.

I understand some out-of-focus lens blur and camera shake is purely artistic, but--given the fact that it was headache-inducing--it was evidently unintentional. e.g. when people are talking, everyone and everything is out of focus (gets pretty frustrating after a while). That, and the camera frequently zooms in (with a shaky hand) and wanders on peoples noses or mouths. Oh, and lots of visible boom mikes and cameramen.

The unfocused, wandering lens gave me a headache so I had to stop watching; I'm never nitpicky about cinematography in documentaries, but if I can't even finish the film it should be commented on.",1338249600,3,948,5.230263157894737
8102432,3,B000DN5VFS,"Easy to tell from the get-go who the real contenders are, and the winner(s) is/are as one would presume, unfortunately.  No ""grit"" here, nothing amazing, but amusing.  The odd thing is that after the winner is announced, it almost seems such a terrific let down and disappointment.  The production is less about the clothing, than lighting, effect, and music.  I love that, but it would have been nice to have seen the CLOTHES in true color and not through lenses smeared with mayonnaise and surreal lighting.  A personal prejudice; the industry has to get beyond this infatuation with fur.  Though not featured, it is mentioned as an advancement in one of the contender's future collections.  Just ridiculous and out-of-touch, thanks largely to Ms. Wintour's obstinate stance on this issue. Worth a look, but don't get too excited.",1327449600,,832,5.029197080291971

8102436,3,B000DN5VFS,I was hoping to see the same editing genius that went behind Unzipped.  The stories were interesting.  Just wished that we get to see more of the footage of designing at work because the whole premise is really about how they're fighting for the prize.  Also wished that he interviewed the judges more to gain a better understanding of the whole thing.,1225324800,2,352,4.645161290322581
8102437,3,B000DN5VFS,"While I understand that the real fashion world is not as ""kooky"" as what we see on the wonderful ""Project Runway"" -- OK, it's ""kooky"" in a different way -- I was expecting to see a little more about the artistic, rather than the business, aspect of the fashion industry.  While I did find it very interesting to learn more about what is involved in bringing fashion to market, I would have like to see more about the designers' creative process.  More of that and less ""drama"" about their personal loves would have made for a much more engaging and satisfying documentary.",1216339200,,572,4.598039215686274
8102438,5,B000DN5VFS,"if you are looking to become your own fashion designer and want to see the inside look of how stressful and how wonderful it is, get this dvd! you won't be disappointed, i do agree that they should have shown more of the designers points of view (they only follow 3 of the 10) but its extremely well informed dvd....get it! don't think about it!",1212278400,2,345,4.323076923076923
