1669356,5,B00005UW8B,"This is an excellent , moral movie of a true hero . Santo was still in shape in this movie and showed what was expected from me to see about 34 years later. This is one of the ""where are they""? (as opposed to How many are they? ) type of movie from Santo . Highly recommended. Lots of clean ""lucha libre"" . The Martians present a solution to mankind problems before affecting the rest of the universe (including the martians)- they made two mistakes: They were imposing and of course they faced Santo.",1018483200,4,501,4.340425531914893
1669357,5,B00005UW8B,"Santo made over 50 films, and his most memorable ones involved battles against evil scientists or supernatural creatures.  Santo vs. the Vampire Women is probably his most famous film, but it doesn't give Santo very much screen time and tends to drag in places.  Santo vs. the Martians, however, is entertaining all the way through.  I've heard people criticize it saying that it's a tad ""campy"", but to me that's like criticizing an Arnold movie for having excessive violence. I really think that this is the only Santo film that doesn't require any fast-forwarding.  Hopefully someone will release other Santo films on DVD (along with films from Mil Mascaras).  BTW, I should state that I haven't seen the DVD yet, so I have no way of knowing whether it's done well or not.  The other Santo films on DVD (from a different company) are definitely bare-boned efforts, but this one appears to be upscale enough to include alternative subtitles, so it can't be too bad.",1012780800,4,967,4.83030303030303
7955770,3,B00005UW8B,"One of the iconic wrestler's best movie outings. ""Santo vs. the Martian Invasion"" (1966) resembles a Spanish-language version of ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"" with better production values and entertainment value. Everyone's favorite Man in the Silver Mask thrashes muscular aliens outside (and occasionally inside) the ring while saving the world from outrageous destruction. A worthy companion to the 1962 cult classic ""Santo vs. the Vampire Women."" Ridiculous widescreen fun with English subtitles.",1424995200,,497,5.821917808219178
7955771,2,B00005UW8B,"First - I love old sci fi movies.  Production values on this one are surprisingly good.  That's where the good news stops, though.  The story line - well not much there.  I guess if I was a true Santo fan, I would love every scene to involve wrestling.  But this got old real fast.  How many different motivations or reasons for wrestling can you get - with Martians.  Sorry, turned it off after about 1/2 of the movie - my time was too valuable to waste.",1393372800,,455,4.22093023255814
7955772,4,B00005UW8B,"Nearly every fan of the Mexiluchahero film genre laments that this film unlike Santo vs. The Vampire Women,Santo vs. The Zombie Invasion and the inferior Santo In The Wax Museum wasn't dubbed into English. If you want high camp fun this is the film for you. The Earth is invaded by long-haired muscle-men from the red planet and their muy sexy female companions. Of course the only one who can thwart their plans of conquest is the ""Man in the Silver Mask"".Like the best of Santo's movies this one is in black and white. Watch in stunned disbelief as Santo uses his grappling skills to defeat the super-science of the invaders and defend the Earth. A cult classic. And for those of you who don't habla esponal this DVD has english sub-titles.",1242950400,,742,4.628787878787879
7955773,4,B00005UW8B,"if you like Santo movies, this is classic.
  The Martians have Gold stretch pants,capes and padded hats with blonde hair proturding and make several remarks about Earthlings looking funny......",1234828800,2,193,5.620689655172414
7955774,4,B00005UW8B,"Why do martians wrestle Santo instead of using their magic eye to vaporize him ? After the martian invasion, why do Santo's friends hold cocktail parties ? Why are Santo and his professor buddy the only ones fighting the martians ? How do the martians know how to wrestle ? Why are earthling men so taken by the not-so-hot martian-ettes ?

Who cares. This is a fun, campy wrestling movie. With some of the worst and most laughable special effects ever. But that is what makes it fun. You won't be sorry you bought this movie.",1157155200,4,525,4.46875
7955775,4,B00005UW8B,"If you're already an El Santo fan and understand the appeal of a beefy masked Mexican wrestler saving the earth from similarly muscled Martian invaders, you should order now, right now, and add Santo vs. La Invasion De Los Marcianos to the collection.  For the uninitiated, the meandering plot lines, low budget effects and bikinied Martian go-go girls might be a bit intimidating.  Don't be afraid, even my wife enjoyed this one.  The extras aren't bad either.",1140825600,5,461,4.961038961038961
7955776,5,B00005UW8B,"Just what is it that makes those cheesy, low-budget, lucha libre flicks so apealing?  The masks!  The Classic lucha libre moves!  The awesome rivals!  The eternal struggle between good and evil!  Santo's amazing outfit!  That and much more you'll find in this electrifying movie!

When a bunch of shinny Martians decide to take over the Earth to save humanity from itself using less-than humane and just resources (evaporizing soccer-watching crowds to show off their might), Santo decides to take action and save the day.  With the help of a genius doctor and inventor, El Plateado locates the Martians' flying saucer and destroys it together with all the shinny Martians inside it, after, of course, saving all the kidnapped humans beings who were kept aboard the spacecraft.

El Santo movies are true cult classics and this one is just Kitch fabulous.  If you are into these kind of flicks then it's a must see!",1100304000,8,914,4.915032679738562
7955777,4,B00005UW8B,"In Mexico, Santo, El Enmascarado de Plata, was like a combination of Joe Namath and the Lone Ranger.  He was a masked wrestling star, but also the star of comic books, and more than fifty movies.  This is the earliest of three Santo movies I have seen, and in my opinion, the least entertaining.  Though shot in 1966, this movie has the feel of a low-budget, black-and-white 50s Sci-Fi flick like Plan Nine From Outer Space.  While there are definitely entertaining campy elements here, such as the Martian costumes and a dance number, the movie drags quite a bit, especially during the wrestling.  There are quite a few bonuses on this DVD, in Spanish with English subtitles, though Amazon doesn't currently mention them.  There is an extensive, though not particularly illuminating interview with El Hijo del Santo, the original Santo's son, also a wrestler and movie actor.  And there is a ""commentary"" by a professor in Spanish, not a commentary track, but a separate short film, with poor subtitles, discussing the Santo phenomenon.  And there are also animated biographies of Santo and Wolf Ruvinskis, the wrestler-turned-actor who plays Argos the leader of the Martians.  This isn't the most captivating movie experience you'll ever have, but it is the best Santo DVD available and thus earns four stars.",1038355200,13,1311,5.0046082949308754
7955778,5,B00005UW8B,"Up until recently my exposure to El Santo movies, and Mexican horror in general, had been limited to a few heavily edited TV airings many years ago, featuring unexceptional prints and lots of commercial interruptions. Thanks to this amazing DVD I have been sucked into the El Santo cult literally overnight. For jaded bad-movie fanatics starved for cheap thrills, Santo vs. the Martians really delivers the goods. The picture starts off not too promisingly with blah NASA space mission footage under the titles, but quickly cranks up the cheese factor with the appearance of some rather quaint spaceships, reminiscent of a Starman movie, that emit crazy electronic sound effects (some of which seem to have been lifted from Forbidden Planet). The spaceships are carrying both voluptuous female Martians and golden-tressed, barechested male Martians in mildly flaming attire consisting of shiny tights, capes, and kneeboots, topped off by goofy headgear with deadly ""Astral Eye"" in front. They head straight for Mexico, commandeering all television transmissions, broadcasting their message that the violent, warlike Earth people must unilaterally disarm, unify their language, and live in peace and brotherhood, or the peace-loving Martians ""will be forced to annihilate"" them. Of course nobody takes the silly-looking aliens seriously; everyone laughs off the warning as some sort of comedy stunt and returns to watching their musical variety shows. The Martians (who are all named after Greco-Roman deities) decide that they must abduct ""the one who dresses strangely and covers his face with a silver mask"" and/or his associate, Professor Ordorica. Their leader, Argos (Wolf Ruvinskis) sends henchman Kronos to a soccer stadium where Santo's conducting a wrestling camp for boys (whose skills must never be used for harm but only to defend the weak and helpless) and proceeds to vaporize the crowd with his Astral Eye before grappling unsuccessfully with Santo. Next, the Martians decide that they need to transform their appearance, since their ""more perfectly evolved bodies"" are frightening the humans (?!?). Unfortunately, the men come out looking even goofier than before, if that's possible. The aliens start abducting people and detaining them in their ship (they vaporize a couple of men at a cocktail party), and well-stacked Martian dames Artemisa and Diana show up at Santo's training gym (obligatory wrestling scenes here) and hypnotize a few of the regulars into attacking him. The Martians next try planting one of their own (Hercules) in the ring with Santo in another futile kidnap attempt. Assorted priceless moments include: Santo at home in bed reading (in full costume) visited by Martian babes Aphrodite and Selena (packing 'hypnotic mist') who attempt to unmask and seduce him; the Martians debating morality with Padre Fuentes, one of the detainees; the child's gyroscope toy displayed on the Martian ship's viewscreen; and the floor show staged by singing, dancing Martian hotties at the testimonial dinner for Professor Ordorica (as cover for yet another abduction attempt). Interspersed with all this insanity are several protracted wrestling sequences and a recurring subplot about how the government and media are hushing up the whole Martian invasion so as not to create hysteria among the public! As expected, the fate of the world is ultimately decided by Santo and Argos in the squared circle. If you're curious about Santo movies at all, this is a great introduction/point of entry to the genre. The plot generally moves along at a snappy pace (the wrestling scenes may drag a bit for non-fans) and every time you think this movie can't get any loonier it ups the ante. An indescribable trove of richly textured camp; immensely entertaining and highly recommended.
If you're a long-time Santo fanatic, this disc is sure to be a thrill. VCI's DVD package, presented in association with Kit Parker films, includes numerous informative goodies for veteran Santo fans and newbies as well. There is a recent, approximately half-hour interview with El Hijo del Santo (Son of Santo); Mex movie trailer package (though most of them are non-horror/SF); illustrated biographies of both Santo and Wolf Ruvinskis that showcase numerous posters and lobby cards; a comprehensive Santo filmography; and a six-minute ""commentary"" (really an illustrated history of Santo's career) by Santo expert Prof. Juan Carlos Vargas. There is no feature-length audio commentary; VCI's promo is a bit misleading here. The appropriately odd bilingual menus are in 5.1 surround, so turn your speakers on when booting the disc to hear some of the movie's wacky sound effects pinging around the room. Even with all the nice extras, what really makes this such a terrific disc is the absolutely pristine state of the source elements, sure to bring tears to the eyes of long-time fans of Mexican horror used to shoddy 16mm TV prints and dupey VHS copies. The print is letterboxed at 1.66:1 and the brightness, grayscale, sharpness, and detail are simply terrific. The black level could perhaps be a bit darker, a very minor quibble. It looks pretty gorgeous overall, virtually blemish- and speckle-free. Audio is clear and full, in Spanish mono only with optional English subtitles (that are very readable but a bit distracting at times). Apparently this is the beginning of a whole series of VCI releases of classic Mexican cinema. Hopefully Santo vs. the Vampire Women, Santo in the Wax Museum, Invasion of the Zombies, and the related 'Luchadoras' series are in the pipeline.",1038268800,34,5579,5.276715410573678
7955779,5,B00005UW8B,"I grew up watching movies from Mexico's ""golden film age"".  Although Santo movies came a little later, they are as golden as its predecesors.  As far as the quality of the DVD, it is great, very well done and with lots of extra footage.  The same company is releasing other movies from the era, and hopefully will continue to release other Santo movies.  If you love ""lucha libre"" and I don't mean WWF, this is a must have.",1019779200,5,423,4.384615384615385
