3729417,5,B001OA7ZKS,"I have been using the ""Yoga for Runners"" DVD for the past month now and my body has responded beautifully to each one of your exercises. I use it right after my morning runs and all of the points you make in your commentary are very helpful and ring true.  Thank you for developing an easy to follow program, for runners like me who want to continue to run without sore and painful muscles and joints due to muscle imbalances.  This is an excellent DVD!!!

3729418,5,B001OA7ZKS,"I have been teaching yoga for a few years and recently started to teach at a running club.  I decided to purchase a few dvds tailored to runners to expand my knowledge in this area.  The students in my class have none or little yoga experience and are very stiff.  This dvd is perfect and I learned a great deal  from it.  First I appreciate that it is organized into 4 segments and each one is so targeted to the needs of runners.  The instruction, both visual and oral, is very clear and even the stiffest person can get in and out of the poses, practice safely and gain benefit.  Also helpful is that the DVD illustrates modifications in poses , for those very stiff and those with more flexibility.  It is obvious that Christine understands the needs of tight runners and has crafted a yoga program that gets to the heart of the most common runners' issues.  I have used this dvd as a valuable reference and have integrated many valuable aspects from it in my own teaching.  My only suggestion for improvement is that the participants should smile more!",1270771200,64,1057,4.486910994764398
3729419,5,B001OA7ZKS,"As a competitive athlete for much of my ""prior life"", I am now paying the piper for those many years of inattention to muscle balance, range of motion, and general flexibility. I am happy to report that Christine Felstead's Yoga for Runners is rapidly helping me repay that debt--simply by following the clear progression of her yoga instruction and the biomechanically sound (and safe) demonstration of poses. This is perfect preparation for spring, when I plan to apply what I've learned from the DVD to a recovered enjoyment of running, better execution in weight training, and a more complete turn in my golf swing.",1267401600,4,619,4.961538461538462
3729420,5,B001OA7ZKS,"As a 60+ runner carrying a few extra pounds I was often stiff and prone to injury. My yoga experience is pretty limited but I found it relativley easy to follow the instucter's poses in the video. I am definitely more flexible now and am enjoying my running more, with fewer aches and pains. Even if I may not have time to fit my run in every day, I make time to do the yoga workout just to make sure I stay limber. I would recommend this to any runner, especially those who hope to keep running well into the future. Also, the soothing voice of the instucter and the yoga itself helps to keep me generally more relaxed.",1262649600,17,620,4.218487394957983
3729421,5,B001OA7ZKS,"This is an excellent workout with basic yoga poses geared mainly for those with little to no yoga experience, especially athletes who need to stretch more to prevent injuries.  There are 4 basic sections:  Foundation, Lower Back, Hamstrings, and Hip Openers.  The Foundation section (10 minutes long) covers proper breathing, basic standing poses (i.e., mountain), sitting poses (i.e., hero), and some wall poses that were new to me.  Exercises in the Lower Back section (11 minutes) include cat & cow stretches (done on hands and knees), spiral twists, and full body stretches (including downward facing dog.)  The stretches in the Hamstring section (11 minutes) included seated staff pose, seated forward bend, reclining hamstring stretch, standing forward bend, and wide leg forward bend.  The Hip Opener section (18 minutes) has some great lunge poses (warrior 1, warrior 2, pigeon pose, and side angle pose.)  The workout concludes with some relaxing reclining poses (goddess pose, ""corpse"" pose, etc.)

Christine gives clear and easy-to-follow instructions, and she explains the benefits of each of the poses as well (""this will help you with your balance"", ""this helps you maintain proper alignment"", ""this pose helps improve your posture"", etc.)  I would highly recommend this to anyone interested in basic stretch routines ... it's ""yoga made easy"" for strength and flexibility!",1247961600,44,1387,5.413953488372093
3729422,1,B001OA7ZKS,"This low-budget, low-quality DVD was too simplistic to be useful for a serious runner who has any background in yoga whatsoever.

Much of it was breathing exercises, cat-cow, and other very basic yoga poses. Little of it seemed tailored to runners.

I was hoping for something that would discuss which muscles get overly tight from running and which are underdeveloped--and offer yoga poses to counteract these trends. That is, poses that stretch what gets tight and strengthen muscles that aren't used much in running, to restore balance and decrease risk of injury. But the DVD never quite got there.

In addition, I was hoping the DVD would include some serious attention to the core, because strengthening the core can improve running and decrease injuries. But this never happened.

Overall, a disappointment and a waste of money. Better off perusing back issues of Runner's World for ideas, which is pretty easy to do at most public libraries.",1247616000,10,949,5.064102564102564
3729425,3,B001OA7ZKS,"I am not new to running, but I am new to Yoga.  I've found this DVD to be very helpful, however, I have to stop between segments to reach for the remote to fast forward past sections that are not devoted to yoga instruction.  This need to fast forward is a distraction to the exercise and to trying to be in a peaceful state.",1421884800,7,325,4.0625
3729426,5,B001OA7ZKS,Very helpful for runners!,1412726400,,25,5.5
3729427,2,B001OA7ZKS,"It was good stretching but not very rigorous. I expected more isometric poses to strengthen core, etc. Would not buy it again.",1406505600,,126,4.7727272727272725
3729428,5,B001OA7ZKS,This is a great DVD.  Lots of good stretches and she walks you through everything repeatedly so you are sure to have good form and not get injured.,1404950400,,147,4.25
3729429,1,B001OA7ZKS,"Very poorly done, facial expressions of the instructor as well as students will ""scare"" you away!  Love DVDs for exercising but have no appreciation for the quality and content of this one.",1404345600,,189,4.90625
3729430,5,B001OA7ZKS,"Great video.  Definitely feel the stretches.  This video is divided into sections of which muscle groups will be stretched, so that you can only stretch certain muscles.",1399852800,2,169,5.222222222222222
3729431,3,B001OA7ZKS,"This shows basic moves, but does not do a full class type program. Also, you need yoga belts and other equipment. I wanted a video that flowed like a class, I could have looked this up on the internet.",1399161600,,201,4.17948717948718
3729432,2,B001OA7ZKS,no fluid transition between poses lots of talking between poses which makes for a lot of standing around while each pose is explained. The demonstrators look miserable.,1396310400,,168,5.2592592592592595
3729433,4,B001OA7ZKS,"The DVD looks a little dated now and does not 'flow' as well as her intermediate DVD, but the instruction is good and I like the length of the program.  I am a long time runner, but fairly new to yoga.  Her poses hit all the right spots for a runner.",1395619200,,250,3.8823529411764706
3729434,4,B001OA7ZKS,Ordered this for my mother in laws birthday she was very excited about it! She hasn't used it yet but says she plans on it as soon as her leg gets better!,1392163200,,154,3.84375
3729441,5,B001OA7ZKS,"I was skeptical to purchase this DVD, but after reading the positive reveiws had to give it a try. As a first time running, having run two half marathons in the last year, I have left myself with lingering injuries that have not been helped by doctors visits or pain medication. Doing this DVD only once, it was immediately apparent that all I needed to do was a good long stretch in the correct poses. My husband and I were absolutely amazed at how much better our problem areas felt (hips and lower back) after just one session with Christine. I would highly reccomend this DVD. The yoga is the kind I like- easy breathing with long amounts of time held in the poses that truely focus on streching and require minimal body strength.",1389744000,,734,4.485074626865671
3729442,4,B001OA7ZKS,This product is  age appropriate for over 50 .Good  demostration model. Very easy to following the yoga pose at an easy pace.,1385683200,,125,4.636363636363637
3729443,5,B001OA7ZKS,I bought this DVD after experienceing lower back pain during long runs and I must say it is a life saver!  The lower back and hamstring modules are fantastic and have helped keep me limber and pain-free.  I highly recommend this DVD for runners who want to stay limber and need to work through some tightness.,1384732800,,309,4.5
3729444,3,B001OA7ZKS,Rather basic and fragmented.  Each pose is explained well but I  Would like to find a practice that flows you through essential stretches and helps to strengthen general weak spots in a runner.,1378771200,4,193,4.818181818181818
3729445,3,B001OA7ZKS,If you have done any yoga before you can probably come up with a similar group  of exercises to help with running tightness all on your own. This DVD would be good for someone who has never done yoga.,1377734400,,200,4.128205128205129
3729446,4,B001OA7ZKS,"I felt very good after completing this DVD. It's a great addition for any runner who may neglect stretching once in a while, helps with the hips.",1375142400,,145,4.407407407407407
3729447,5,B001OA7ZKS,This video has been very helpful in introducing me to some yoga stretches -Christine is very clear with her explanations. I enjoy doing this video very much.,1373241600,,157,4.851851851851852
3729448,4,B001OA7ZKS,I started using this DVD when stretching and doctor's visits resulted in nothing more than more medication in my medicine cabinet.  I have used this for 3 weeks and have really noticed improvements in the lack of aches and pains in my legs and ankles.  I feel so much better at the end of the day no matter what type of work out I have done.  Helps me to completely relax at the end of a day!!,1370822400,,393,4.077922077922078
3729449,5,B001OA7ZKS,"I have been doing a very simplified yoga for about 2 years.  This video is great!  It is easy to understand, well explained, and certainly stretches all the muscles that you use while running.  I do this program 3-4 times a week.",1362960000,,229,4.404761904761905
3729450,5,B001OA7ZKS,This is a great resource for runners. I have a short leg due to a car accident when I was younger and am very injury prone due to this. This stretching/workout program designed for runners has been a real help.,1361491200,,210,4.275
3729461,5,B001OA7ZKS,This yoga video is for beginners. I quickly moved on to the intermediate level workout for Runners. She is well spoken and easy to follow. Christine is my favorite yoga instructor I have found on DVD. I would highly recommend this DVD to anyone starting out new to yoga.,1359676800,,270,4.530612244897959
3729462,2,B001OA7ZKS,"I bought this DVD in the hopes of improving my flexibility and helping to recover from some of the impact running has on my lower body... The DVD is fine, but after one watch I was frustrated that I had spent money on it.  Most, if not all, of the moves covered in this video are stretching moves that I have already learned from running texts, coaches, etc.  I don't normally do yoga, but I have done some version of most of these moves as routine stretching.  For me, this felt like a total waste of money, unfortunately.",1357171200,2,523,4.316326530612245
3729463,5,B001OA7ZKS,So happy to have Christine's materials. She's very informative and the multiple video angles were very helpful. I've suffered from various running related maladies and this was very helpful at keeping me stretched!,1356652800,,214,5.515151515151516
3729464,5,B001OA7ZKS,"I bought this because I could feel my calves tighten when I ran. After I started using it I could feel a difference in my legs and my stride. When doing this dvd I thought, ""Wow, this is to easy."" The next day I could feel some soreness in my muscles, so it must tone. The dvd is broken up into sections that make it nice if you only want a quick 10 minute stretch of do the whole thing for around 30 minutes. I recommend this for all runners. I even bought the intermediate dvd after doing this one a few times.",1350345600,,512,3.9805825242718447
3729465,5,B001OA7ZKS,"I was always curious about yoga, but thought it was not a ""real"" workout.  That all changed when I started experiencing severe hip pain from my 20 years of running.  After almost 6 mts of pain, 4 weeks of physical therapy, nothing made a difference. I was always stiff and in pain and was seriously considering hanging up my running shoes for good.

As a last ditch effort, I ordered Christine Feldstead's ""Yoga for Runners"" and what a difference it has made! After only 3 times doing the tape I am no longer experiencing severe pain or stiffness.  This is despite the fact that I have increased my running schedule from 12 to almost 18 miles per week.

Her instructions are clear and precise, making it easy to understand exactly how to do each pose.  The fact that she breaks out each segment for you is helpful as well.  I can just do the hip segment when I want to, or chose to do the entire tape.  She also explains the specific benefits of each pose and which ones are most popular with runners.  I am so glad I ordered this tape! I am now a Yoga convert  and have already ordered her intermediate tape! I highly recommend this DVD for beginning Yoga runners, runners experiencing pain or aging runners, as a preventative measure.",1304035200,6,1236,4.477678571428571
3729466,1,B001OA7ZKS,"i almost bought this dvd but am glad i didn't.  i rented it from netflix and i only made it through the first 15 minutes.  this dvd is broken into segments so this is not one fluid yoga practice.  also, the instructor does not talk during the video, she uses a voiceover.  it's kind of creepy.  she is staring straight at the camera (actually looking kind of pissed) and not saying a word as she goes through the poses.  not recommended!",1303344000,15,437,4.333333333333333
3729467,1,B001OA7ZKS,I was looking for some great new info regarding stretching geared towards runners. waste of time .If you already do yoga you are alreading doing these poses,1294790400,11,156,4.814814814814815
3729468,3,B001OA7ZKS,"This video is good for those very new to yoga. It helps you learn basic poses and the poses really are wonderful for all areas that tighten up due to running. Felstead talks clearly and the moves are shown slowly. The only thing that disappoints is that once you are ready to do the DVD regularly, you will have to forward through all the talk. There isn't a way to just do the exercises alone with no talking.",1289779200,34,410,4.269230769230769
3729469,4,B001OA7ZKS,"I am a distance runner who never finds the time to stretch appropriately.  Yoga is entirely new to me, but I could see how beneficial this is going to be after just one time.  Great way to maximize your stretching, getting multiple muscles groups in each move.  Can't wait to see the long term effects.",1287532800,2,302,4.454545454545454
3729470,5,B001OA7ZKS,"I really like this video!  I sometimes do the whole thing and sometimes just parts of it but either way, I always feel great after finishing!  I have some lower back pain from playing on the floor with my toddler that is made worse by running and doing yoga just a few days a week helps so much!",1283731200,,295,4.068965517241379

8330112,4,B001OA7ZKS,"I haven't done yoga in many years, so I wasn't sure what to expect with this video. I've just taken up running, so the ""for runners"" part appealed to me. It's hard for me to gauge whether it's a good video for beginners to yoga but experienced runners. It's a very easy routine as far as effort, but it does a very nice job of stretching all the parts of the body that might get tight if running is the only thing you do. Even with the years I've been away from doing yoga, I found the poses easy technically, but also beneficial after a run. If you're experienced at all in yoga, and if you actually stretch regularly, this might be a bit of an easy routine for you if you're actually physically fit.",1482710400,,701,4.2
8330113,5,B001OA7ZKS,"Basics is right and exactly what I needed. All the basic moves are thoroughly explained, and put to use. Perfect for runners, helps with flexibility and upper body strength, as well as essential running stretches for your legs.",1466985600,,227,5.0
8330114,4,B001OA7ZKS,"It's a bit slow because it's geared towards people who have never done yoga before, and her voice is a bit strange, but it's very well structured. I do it once or twice a week, particularly the days before and after a longer race. I use it as a slow practice, holding each pose for about ten breaths (I've been doing yoga for 15 years and don't need all the instructions, so I go right into the poses and hold them for a long time). She  has an intermediate program that is much more difficult and more about upper body and core strength, but this one makes me feel really good about my body and I think it has helped me stay injury free.",1465689600,2,638,4.145161290322581
8330115,4,B001OA7ZKS,Extremely basic. Definitely helps you practice patience.,1462060800,,56,7.142857142857143
