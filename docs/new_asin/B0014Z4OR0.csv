8309604,1,B0014Z4OR0,After trying 2 different videos none worked! Waste of money!  Even the case states Region 1 wrong!! Don't buy if your DVD player is not a multi region player!,1385683200,,158,4.448275862068965
8309605,1,B0014Z4OR0,"Bought through Amazon, listed as region 1 - what I received was ""suitable for all regions"" according to the DVD jacket.  But when I put it in my Toshiba DVD player the message was ""Not NTSC -error"" and it would not play.  Beware!!!  DVD players for the U.S. recognize NTSC; PAL is for European players.
Subsequently I played this on an all-region DVD player from Pioneer, and it will play the PAL.  But ....... the name of the DVD is misleading.  This is a travelogue with continuous narrative, music mostly very much in the background.  Small snippets of many locations in Ireland, filmed almost entirely on sunny days(now THAT also is misleading!!!).  So, if you want a narrated travelogue and have a DVD that will play PAL(U.S. is NTSC), then go for it.  But if you want primarily music then this might not be your choice.",1270771200,2,825,4.602739726027397
