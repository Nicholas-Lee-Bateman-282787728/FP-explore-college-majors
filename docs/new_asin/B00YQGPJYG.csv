8718774,5,B00YQGPJYG,"This was a good anime worthy of a sequel or show,  I thought it was fun to watch the interaction between the characters.  One born into a ""paradise"" computer world, the other raised in a waist land, and both having their own ideals on what is right.  Granted it does push the idea of ""what is human"" into your face, but I think if it deviated from that, the story would have lost something.  I think its worthy of getting a show or sequel.  It would be interesting to see what would happen after the events of the story.  The movie definitely gave the idea a good jump start and there is still lots I'd like to see.",1511049600,,615,4.169491525423729

8718777,4,B00YQGPJYG,"My 7/10 IMDB review: I wrote this as a slight counterpoint to ANN's glowing review: The movie is now rated with a ""good"" and my big problem is how scenario crazy it is. There is way to much world building and explanations for a film of 100 min. runtime. It felt more like a extended pilot or something. I like the characters(well all 3 of them) and it didn't have the expected 3rd act trouble as i feared. The music/Va's were further good and the Cg is a B- for me. It looked nice when a lot happened but the calmer are looked off. That said it is a bad idea in general to try and make low budgeted(or otherwise)CG characters look sexually appealing as it will backfire as seen here. I also wonder where the 16 year old body came from but let's just assume that it is a clever compromise to look appealing to a wider crowd who would be frightened if their leading lady was an obachan in her 20s. And now in ANN magic points. Overall(sub):B- / Story:B- / Animation:B- / Art:B / Music:B+. A good one time popcorn flick and that is all. Giovanni's Island is 2014's best anime film, the Lego Movie the best overall but this is also twice the movie the similar 009 Re:Cyborg tried to be.",1450396800,5,1182,4.257777777777778
