8069458,1,B0009X634U,This video is so basic you could learn better how to saltwater fish surfing the web. The fishing 101 part of the DVD just talks about very basic and I Mean very basic fishing gear. It then just mentions the various types of saltwater fishing. In order to learn anything you would have to know nothing and then like I said you could learn more surfing the web. I have to admit though the bait rigging part is very informational if you Marlin Fish or huge Gamefish trolling. But I Imagine if your going to do that you are either going to hire a guide or your an experienced fisherman with your own vessel in which case you probably already know what your doing.,1365465600,,659,4.32258064516129
