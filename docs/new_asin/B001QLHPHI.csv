8335964,4,B001QLHPHI,"I now own all of the ""At the Throttle: Cab Ride"" Pentrex series. This one, completed my collection. If your a train fan, you will love these types of videos. You will see the tracks from the cab view, which is very cool! The first part of the video is pretty good, the train picks up good speed, and heads down the corridor. The horns and the sound of the engines, is pretty cool. The middle part, is a bit boring, just a bit slow going around the port. The last part of the video, the speed picks up again, and it's fun to watch again.",1372982400,,536,4.066037735849057
