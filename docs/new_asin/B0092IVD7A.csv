8534757,5,B0092IVD7A,"I have the whole set.  When i was a pre-schooler - i remember watching this strictly for the laughs (especially Ringo's antics)

Now - i bought them for all the great songs they perform.

These dvds had to be sent to Canada - I was completely surprised when they arrived so quickly.",1408579200,,282,4.384615384615385

8534761,4,B0092IVD7A,"Quality of the cartoons leaves much to be desired, but they're so seldom seen that anybody wanting to relive their mid-Sixties childhoods can make do.  Besides, our TVs back in the day were black & white & nothing too sharp.",1377475200,,224,4.6
8534762,4,B0092IVD7A,"The quality of the cartoons is far from being great .The music is great and the cartoons are funny. However,some of the songs are used both for the individual episode and the sing a long part of the cartoon. For example,how many times do I have to hear Good Day Sunshine. I love the song but hearing it more than once on the DVD is too much. I purchased this DVD because it was the last Beatle cartoons  produced.",1366156800,,413,4.227848101265823
