8386177,2,B0030VBGHC,"This is a well-presented, reasonably thorough (for the amount of material it must cover) documentary of the mechanized weaponry of war, from the distant past to present day and beyond.

It covers everything from the beginnings of ""black powder"" to the use of next-gen robotics. It was produced in 2008 (according to the on-screen copyright), so it's reasonably up-to-date.

Now the bad news: both copies I bought from a major retailer were defective out of the box -- disc 1 & 3 of one copy, disc 3 of the other copy.
Mill Creek quality control sucks and, if my experience is typical, they are flooding the market with defective discs (of this title, at least).

I got an exchange of both defective sets of this title and the replacements were good.. sort of.  One disc in one set didn't pass the freeware DVD Shrink deep analysis, but after some cleaning and a quick treatment with CD polish, it scanned ok on the next attempt.
Cleaning and polishing did NOT cure the previous 2 sets, which was expected, as there were no visible surface defects under magnification; the defects were within the dual-layer media itself.

I recommend viewing this program, if you can land a good copy of it. The content deserves at least 3-4 stars; deductions due to plague of defective discs.",1293580800,6,1276,4.72972972972973
8386178,4,B0030VBGHC,"Normally seeing the Mill Creek label conjures up images of poor quality public domain content programs but here they actually manage to deliver a decent documentary with fairly good production values. Its essentially an imported Australian TV program that was released as "" Amazing World Of War Machines"" This is a list of things that are covered:

Flint & steel
Rifles & machine guns
Artillery - Bombard to the howitzer
Fortification - Bollards to bunkers
Tanks and armoured cars
Battleships and Flotillas
Submarines - The silent killer
The fighter plane
The bomber - fortress in the sky
Rockets and missiles
Air defence and surveillance
Nuclear - biological and chemical warfare
Future war and the robo

My only gripe is the cheap manner in which the DVDs are stored inside the case. But for $15 this is definitely an affordable 12 hour program that anybody can enjoy.",1270080000,8,870,4.9520547945205475
