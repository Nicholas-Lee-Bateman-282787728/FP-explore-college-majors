6437278,5,B00KOW4AQE,"ACCUSED, SERIES 1 & 2.  In this star-studded BBC television series of 10 free-standing crime dramas, we are introduced, one by one, to defendants who are led into court to face their fate. We do not initially know their alleged crimes, until, by flashbacks within the frame, each show, which features a different character played by a different actor, traces each crime.  Willy and Frankie, Helen and Liam, family man Kenny and 17-year-old Stephen are ordinary working class people, or so it seems. Are they innocent or guilty? As the protagonist awaits his/her fate in court in these courtroom dramas, we, along with him/her, wonder, will the jury make the right decision for them? This compellingly-written anthology, from Jimmy McGovern, writer of CRACKER and THE STREET, winner of two international Emmys; BAFTA -winning Danny Brocklehurst and others, pulls you in as the tension builds.  The box set contains 10 episodes on 4 DVDs, running approximately 620 minutes or 10  hours, plus 22 minutes of behind-the-scenes footage as an extra.  And, thank goodness, subtitles, as the series is apparently set in Manchester as was CRACKER, and that accent isn't easily understood by most.  I received this set as a review copy.

The Observer (UK) said ""Television drama this good is a rarity."" These engrossing crime dramas aired on the BBC: series 1 in 2010, series 2 in 2012.  Acting is superior, from the series' stars: Sean Bean, (GAME OF THRONES); Christopher Eccleston, (DR. WHO); Peter Capaldi, (DR. WHO); Olivia Colman, (BROADCHURCH); Stephen Graham, (BOARDWALK EMPIRE's Al Capone); Andy Serkis, (LORD OF THE RINGS); Naomie Harris, (SKY FALL); Anna Maxwell Martin, (BLETCHLEY CIRCLE) and Thomas Brodie Sangster, (GAME OF THRONES), among others.  The productions won three International Emmys as best drama series and twice for best actor, (Eccleston, Bean). Also BAFTAs for best writing, best supporting actress (Colman), best supporting actor, (Graham) and best leading actor, (Bean). The photography and direction are fine; Manchester, as ever, looks like a historic, but vibrant, multi-cultural city.  The crimes considered include murder, arson, and other deadly offenses as well as those more minor, as this entertainment turns the usual treatment of crime around and reveals the offense through the eyes of the perpetrator, examining its how's, whys and wherefores.  The episodes are:

Disc 1 (Series 1)
WILLY'S STORY
He is a hardworking plumber and family man. But his business sours at the same time as his daughter announces her engagement; he resorts to desperate measures to keep up appearances.

FRANKIE'S STORY
Frankie and his friend Peter, after getting into trouble with the law, join the army to avoid prison. They suffer brutality from their own commanding officer in Afghanistan, which drives them to commit crimes.

HELEN'S STORY
Helen Rylan is distraught over the death of her son in a workplace accident. As she is not satisfied with the official story, she seeks answers from the company.

Disc 2 (Series 1)
LIAM'S STORY
He is a cab driver, who has a gambling problem and a sick wife. He becomes increasingly obsessed with one of his regular fares, to the point where his fixation leads to theft--and worse.

KENNY'S STORY
His young daughter is assaulted in the park; Kenny and his two best mates seek revenge. But have they targeted the right man? And can they live with the consequences of their attack?

ALISON'S STORY
As Alison's marriage falls apart, her vengeful husband wants to crush her. He and  his policeman father conspire.

Disc 3 (Series 2)
MO AND SUE'S STORY
A gang shooting  galvanizes  the community's women; Mo most vocal of them all. She is determined to end the violence that has terrified her neighborhood.

STEPHEN'S STORY
He is a troubled teenager who is anguished over his mother's death. The hospice nurse who cared for his mother expresses a romantic interest in his father, which trips Stephen into anxiety and paranoia.

Disc 4 (Series 2)
TRACIE'S STORY
Simon, a lonely English professor, has a secret: he has a transvestite alter-ego, Tracie. Tony, an engineer, comes to Tracie's aid one night; the pair fall in love.

TINA'S STORY
She  is a hardworking corrections officer in a tough juvenile prison. One of her charges commits suicide; she wants to tell the truth of it.

As you can maybe guess from its awards won, in an anthology full of fine performances, Bean's, as Simon/Tracie,  is a standout.  He is most familiar to us as husky, handsome Ned Stark, one of the few heroes of GAME OF THRONES.  Yet here he is in drag, bright red lipstick, nails, and toenails.  And thoroughly convincing.  A memorable turn.  Highly recommended.",1413849600,18,4692,5.069010416666667
6437279,5,B00KOW4AQE,"The ""ACCUSED"" get their day in court; but the episode story takes place as backstory, flash backs as to what happened and by whom. No regular cast, but the guest list is stellar. A unique approach on crime. See the events through a different perspective. Sometimes the verdict is not as it should be. The writing and format of episodes drive this series to the top. Distress will be found since there is never a true positive character to find solace alongside as in most crime dramas. Among the ""ACCUSED"" there are no heroes. The series incorporates the psychological thriller element. The mystery of ""Who?"" has reverted to ""What"" is he/she ACCUSED of? Powerful writing, stories, & acting make this an award producing series; not to mention the inspiring cinematography.

6437280,3,B00KOW4AQE,Still working through it - it's well acted but after 3 episodes it seems relentlessly grim - not much comic relief. But I want to reiterate that the acting is topnotch and it's worth it for that - just am hoping that future episodes won't be so grueling.,1501372800,,254,4.3125

6437287,4,B00KOW4AQE,"If the modern video equivalent of an epic poem is the multi-year multipart TV serial (""The Sopranos,"" Game of Thrones,"" e. g.), then what we have here might be the modern video equivalent of a sonnet sequence -- short, free-standing, uniformly-structured stories.  At 60 minutes, they're a far cry from even the one-season multi-part series (""State of Play,"" for example), but they pack a punch and are strongly cast and atmospherically shot.  We have ten on this four-disc set, and each starts with a prisoner being taken from a holding-cell up the stairs to a courtroom for the jury's verdict.  Each ends with that verdict, or very shortly thereafter.  In between, we have what are a sequence of flashbacks that reveal how the protagonist of that particular story got into the mess that he or she is in.  All the stories are emotionally complicated and well-written.  The actions that lead to the protagonists being accused are not always bad acts by any means (some are), but unintended consequences play a big part, and so does the sense that our complications always involve other people whom we don't necessarily want to hurt -- so the sense of family suffering and social context is both explicit and implicit.  I'm not going to indulge in spoilers, but I do recommend this set.  Sean Bean is one protagonist, Juliet Stevenson another, and Andy Serkis (yes, Gollum!) yet another.  Peter Capaldi shows up, as does Olivia Colman, and there are some young actors who are very involving.  For all the tightness of the form, it's capable of surprising you and moving you.",1480550400,2,1573,4.857677902621723

6437291,4,B00KOW4AQE,"10 episode limited anthology UK series.  Each 1 hour story starts with someone being taken from a holding cell into a courtroom, where they will stand trial.  Then we flashback into the story of what led them there, all building up to a final verdict in court.

The most consistent strength of the series is are the excellent performances.  Christopher Eccleston, Sean Bean, Olivia Coleman, Juliet Stevenson are just a few of the top flight actors who do excellent, subtle and complex work.  The stories themselves are strong if somewhat variable.  A couple feel too on the nose, or heavy handed in their themes.  But most are at least quite good, and a few are flat out terrific  morally complex, surprising, emotional, tense.

They are also mostly quite grim.  Even the few episodes with happy endings still leave characters dealing with loss, broken families, damaged souls.  Like in real life, a not guilty verdict doesnt simply put all the broken pieces of a life back together again.  Because of that consistently dark, sad tone, this series doesnt cry out for binge watching.  That would risk sending one out the window  But this is worthwhile, intelligently written, solidly directed television, and well worth a look.",1461110400,,1226,4.946078431372549

6437294,2,B00KOW4AQE,I know this is supposed to be true to life but it's downright depressing to me.  The stories are pretty repetitive as is the legal system in the real world.

6437295,5,B00KOW4AQE,"I am amazed by the quality of story and acting so often found in BBC work.
