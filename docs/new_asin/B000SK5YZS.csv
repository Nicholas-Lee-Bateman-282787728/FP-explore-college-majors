2886092,4,B000SK5YZS,Its a shame the show went off the air. It is for the late teens to late 20's crowd. It is very good a little edgy but still light ! Thanks.,1215648000,3,139,3.5161290322580645
2886093,4,B000SK5YZS,"falcon beach has a pretty good story line in addition to all the hard bodies, both male and female.  The lead female has an awsomebody and can act as well-am puzzled why she has not been in more main stream works.",1202515200,2,213,4.195121951219512
2886094,5,B000SK5YZS,"I watched this series on ABC Family until it was cancelled. I grew up in South Florida by the water and this show just reminded me of the good old days when my biggest worry was what I was going to wear to a party. This show had a great storyline that was believeable and fun. It wasn't award winning material, just pure entertainment like 90210 or The O.C. based in a seaside town. I hope season 2 comes out on DVD!",1200528000,5,416,4.085365853658536
2886095,1,B000SK5YZS,"yeah, its that bad people!  first off, let me say the characters are hella ugly and look really old!  i got really bored and tired of the lame storys and relationships(which none of them had any chemistry). don't buy.  i can't believe it lasted two seasons.  thankfully, it is now cancelled!",1197417600,,291,4.647058823529412
2886096,3,B000SK5YZS,"It's not a great show,not even a good one but you watch it just to see what will happen and which song will be featuring on which scene. The actors aren't that good but just the way they should be and the beautiful ""super model"" girl isn't beautiful that much (the bitchy blonde is even prettier than her).Filled with cliches all the way till the end FB (I?,lol,not funny) will certainly seduce you and your 12 year old sister will become a fan of the show.",1185235200,5,457,4.325581395348837
2886117,1,B000SK5YZS,It said it was the complete series! It was not. It was only season 1. Season two was the season I never saw.,1406764800,,108,3.739130434782609

2886119,5,B000SK5YZS,"I was so mad when they cancelled Falcon Beach.  Great chemistry with all the characters/actors!  At least it lasted four years...you must see them!  The last show ever was a great ending to the entire show!  Great for summertime.  If you watch it in winter, it will have you wishing for spring and summer! Very good.",1341360000,,316,4.571428571428571
2886120,4,B000SK5YZS,"I really, REALLY wish they would release Season 2. This show's been off the air for close to 5 or maybe even 6? years now. Nonetheless, I really enjoyed this show, just like the other ABC Family hit, WildFire. The simiarities of this show are great for me b/c of the teens/early 20 crowd(s) working like adults- Falcon Beach, running the Marina; WildFire, running the Ranches. On the WildFire S3 DVD, on one of the commentaries, one of the writers said that it was a pleaure writing the third season b/c the fans got to see the young adults ACTING like adults by having almost full control, if not complete control, in running the ranches; that it was an asparational fantasty for us. And it's the exact same thing here on Falcon Beach- the young adults are basically running things. I loved that so much. And I wish that on BOTH shows they had contuined that- however the 4th season of WildFire did a 380 in the 4th Season Premire and nobody was working anymore; and on Falcon Beach, unfortuantly, the show was never given the chance, having been cancelled. Of course, the blame for this is the programming, switching Falcon Beach from 8:00 pm to around 2:00 am- who the heck is awake at 2:00 am? No one that I'm aware of.

Anyway, back to the show, one of my FAOVIRTE aspects was watching the romance between Paige & Nathan. I know almost every fan of this show was a Paige/Jason fan and I admit that they're adorable but I really, really, REALLY loved Paige & Nathan. They were SO hot. And they actually followed through on thier fling- making out at least once and flirting; unlike on WildFire, the beginning of S4, where in the end of S3, fans fell in love with Dani & O, and when the 4th season picked up, no mention here nor there of where the heck O was. Needless to say, I was very peeved.

Regardless, this show was fantastic. I actually think I like this show a bit more then WildFire, just b/c I think that Paige & Nathan have off-the-charts Chemistry, not that on WildFire Dani & O didn't but we never saw them go down that road.

This is a good show. Not great, but good. A nice escape for an hour or two from the reality of real life. It makes you smile but be warned- it's cheesy- what do you expect, being a teensoap ranging from age 14-17? But don't fret, b/c WildFire's the same way.

7/10 stars.",1340064000,,2315,4.364269141531323
2886121,5,B000SK5YZS,"Falcon Beach is a good show. I think it is similar to The O.C. I loved the O.C. I own all the seasons. Falcon Beach is it's own show, It has good relationships and real life problems. People should give it a try, I'm not saying that everyone will like it as much as I do. but most people will like it.",1337817600,,301,3.870967741935484

2886124,4,B000SK5YZS,"I loved this show when it was on. I am a baby boomer and this reminded me of all my summers at the canadian shore! Good writing,storylines and excellent actors! The Canadian network was crazy to cancel this show. Not much quality programming on tv these days. Very good entertainment!",1279584000,,284,4.7
2886125,4,B000SK5YZS,"The show Falcon Beach was cut too short when ABC Family canceled it. This show is great and I like the DVD so I can rewatch the show when I want to. The extras are good, but there are very few.",1278288000,,193,3.731707317073171

8205541,5,B000SK5YZS,"Wow!

I just sat back and watched all 13 episodes of Falcon Beach and, man, it was totally way cool! I really was shocked at how good this show was! Falcon Beach sure was a lot of fun, tons of drama, vicious back-stabbing and more twists and turns than a packed freeway heading towards Disneyland! I'm telling you all, Falcon Beach should have never been canceled! Plus,that blond actress, Jennifer Kydd, who plays Paige in this T.V. series, was just stunning to look at!

So with the first season behind me,  I'm searching high and low to get my hands on season two of Falcon Beach! So,just bring it already! Please give us the rest of the Falcon Beach seasons on DVD! This show is just way too good to just be sitting in a vault somewhere gathering dust and not making ABC television more money with more DVD sales and more streaming online revenue. Without a shadow of a doubt, season two of Falcon Beach is most definitely on my DVD purchase wish list!",1505865600,,956,4.451428571428571
8205542,5,B000SK5YZS,"I watched this show on ABC Family a very long time ago and it was a joy to purchase and watch again. I only wish Season 2 were on DVD so I could buy that too! Beachy, summery fun! It's a nice escape. 5/5",1495411200,,203,3.6363636363636362
