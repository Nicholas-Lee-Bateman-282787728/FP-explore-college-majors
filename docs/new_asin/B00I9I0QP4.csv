Transformers Energon was released in 2004 and this 154 minute DVD includes the first seven episodes. This series takes place ten years after Unicron's destruction. Optimus Prime and his autobots are gathering Energon from Earth when their cities are attacked by Terrocons. To make matters worse, Megatron is resurrected and is seeking revenge. Can Optimus Prime's autobots save Earth once again?

Here's a list of the action packed episodes included on this DVD:

Cyberton City
Energon Strike
Scorpinok
Megatron's Sword
The New Cybertron City
Megatron Resurrected
Megatron's Raid

While the animation isn't as flashy as Transformers Prime, it has a bit of an old school feel to it. The theme music is catchy and got stuck in my son's head afterward. The voice acting as usual is top notch. My son really enjoyed this series and for Walmart's reasonable price of $5.97, it's well worth the admission fee.",1400112000,,963,5.037735849056604
8640172,5,B00I9I0QP4,"This is a great new DVD set that will allow you to whet your appetite for the rest of the episodes from the series. While this was not my favorite Transformers series of all time, it still was exciting and engaged me from beginning to end. I liked the new Terracons and by the end of this DVD you truly wonder what will come next, so you will truly be left on the edge of your seat!
