8418675,5,B0048GUE9E,"My kids love Monster Jam, and I looked at several dvd's for Christmas gifts before making my choice. I picked this one because it was all about crashing, which is the best part of Monster Jam. It includes two volumes: Crash Madness 5 & 6. My kids kept shouting, ""Whoa!"" and ""Oh, man!"" over and over as they watched. It was a good choice.",1388016000,,337,4.28125
