8647618,5,B00J3076JQ,Got this for my husband for Xmas. It wasn't on his list so he pretty much ignored it. Then he watched the DVD. And has watched it at least half a dozen more times that I know of. Plus loading the cd onto his MP3 players. And taking it to play on his two hour commute to/from work... I think he's definitely liking it.,1422230400,,317,3.96875
