7373482,5,B01025N31A,GREAT FUN AND WONDERFUL CAST TELLS THE TALE OF WHAT HAPPENS WHEN DOWNSTAIRS GOES UPSTAIRS!,1483142400,4,90,5.066666666666666
7373483,5,B01025N31A,A great series with an excellent cast typical of the Acorn productions. Loved the concept story and the development of the characters. I hope there will be more in the series.,1482105600,,175,4.67741935483871
7373484,5,B01025N31A,"If youve read my other reviews here on Amazon  especially of British mysteries  you know that I really hate lengthy reviews which give plot outlines for each episode, which serve as spoilers. Im not sure it those are helpful to the buyer  especially since the reviewer has already had the enjoyment of discovering the plot turns for themselves. I try to post reviews that give you the background but I want you to discover the show the way the author/director wanted you to . This is particularly relevant to this 2015 British series. There are so many twists in the story and so many levels of character development that  honestly  the less you know the better.

Here is all I think you need to know (again this is just MY opinion). On its face this six-hour-plus (6 episodes) series is a satire on the current craze for PBSs Downton Abbey. It takes place at a large Estate in England (in the past decade) which is in disrepair and the Lord and his wife cant keep it up. His loyal staff wins the lottery (not a spoiler as it happens in the first 30 minutes) and decides to buy the property and turn it into a tourist attraction. As I said that is the story on the face. But there are other stories  including a COUPLE of different mysteries (which I won't reveal) which runs till the end, some relationship issues and events that happen that change the future for all.

The cast (all honestly new to me except for the wonderful Anthony Andrews -as the Lord and Lenny Henry as the gardener who is partly a savant) is great and each will grow on you like family). The story does jump back and forth in time  which bothered me at first  but I realized at the conclusion that this just added layers.

There is the - now-requisite  nude love scene \but it is short. I don't remember any graphic language and there is some graphic voice in the form of a fist fight.

A bit of research revealed the fact that the series on the DVD is really the IRD in a trilogy of BBC program which started in 2012. Each of the seasons (there was a second one in 2013 had the same title and each revolved around a different syndicate of lottery winners!) This third season was called The Syndicate  All or Nothing. All were written by Kay Mellor.  There is a bit of a cliff hanger at the end of episode 6 but most everything else is wrapped up (though I became so endeared to some characters that I wanted the story to continue).

The DVD does not have any bonus features  not even a making of featurette.

I can highly recommend this to anyone interested in British mysteries and also for those who are in love with Downtown Abbey.
I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

7373485,5,B01025N31A,"Meet the denizens of Hazelwood Manor, Scarborough, England. In the kitchen is Julie, the only cook, who tells her daughter, Sarah, ""You try making supper to impress on less than a tenner a head.""  She has budget constraints because Hazelwood is mortgaged to the tune of 6,500,000. Lord Hazelwood, 8th Earl, recuperating from a stroke, tells Sarah, ""1,860, our last heating bill, and we hardly have the da@*!&  thing on. Most of the time, I'm frozen.""

Yes, the great house has seen better days. As Dawn Stevenson, the cleaner, complains, ""There used to be 30 staff, and now there's just five of us."" Those five pool their funds for the lottery. The gardener, Godfrey, has a sure-fire mathematical formula for picking the numbers. In a humorous turn, he is the only one unhappy when they win an astounding 14,469,009.

But winning the lottery is only the beginning of this story. There follows tension, comedy, and mystery. And a twist at the end which was totally unanticipated.  The story is presented with flashbacks and cut scenes masterfully put together.

""All or Nothing"" is series 3 of ""The Syndicate"". Each of the 3 series has to do with a group of people who win the lottery, but otherwise they are not connected. Series 3 originally aired in June/July 2015. It has 6 episodes totaling 366 minutes without commercials. The DVD set presents the show in 16:9 widescreen and stereo. English SDH subtitles are available. There are no bonus extras on the DVDs.

A highlight in the acting is Lenny Henry, aka Sir Lenworth George Henry, as Godfrey. Lenny is most famous as a comedian and co-founder of ""Comic Relief"". Godfrey is quirky, with high-functioning Asperger Syndrome, and Lenny is able to bring humor to the character without a loss of dignity. Godfrey provides most of the laughs in the series. And we did laugh out loud.

I also have to mention one of my favorite actors, Alice Krige, who plays Lady Hazelwood. She's been a favorite of mine ever since her astounding performance as the Borg Queen in ""Star Trek: First Contact"" (1996). Lady Hazelwood is almost as scary.

Trivia: Bramham Park, in NE England, stood in for Hazelwood Manor. Kay Mellor, writer & creator of the three Syndicate series, had a 5/24/15 interview with the editor of the blog ""Not Just Music"" where she said Bramham was chosen because it is still a family home, just like Hazelwood. Bramham is a Grade 1 listed 18th century house, which has been in the Benson family since it was built in 1698.
In the same interview, Mellor also spoke about her research: ""I did some research with Lord Harewood who owns Harewood House which is local to where I live. He was very frank and open with me. He said that without a moral obligation he'd sell his stately home to the Americans for a golf course in a second. However... he has a duty to keep it in his family and part of the English Heritage.""
She also talks about the research into Aspergers, as it was important to get that right.
What Mellor, unfortunately, did not research well was Type 1 diabetes. Our son is Type 1 so we think we recognized a mistake. You can't have a character say that her blood sugar is low and she needs some carbs (""a fizzy drink"") and then instead have her take a dose of insulin for her low.

But that's the only quibble. We very much enjoyed this drama, with its suspense and its comedy. A solid 5 stars!

Happy Reader",1480809600,10,3382,4.629382303839733
7373486,5,B01025N31A,"The same writer for this 3rd installment of The Syndicate: All or Nothing also wrote the earlier 2012 & 2013 stories, so if you liked them, the intrigue continues at the same high level. Greed meets personality meets morals, as this group of Hazelwood Manor servants team up and win big. But at what cost? Everyone involved is proper mental. The Syndicate has been taken to the highest next level of entertainment.
Personally I cant agree with comparing this to Downton or Upstairs Downstairs. Nearer might be Poldark; but NO, this is a gem of its own right, achieved through a complex plot, great writing, and acting to back the finesse. Hazelwood is an old estate in contemporary times, much different than those other series. Best of the olde & new.
This series is placed on my will-watch-again-soon shelf.

Meet The Syndicate 5 of Hazelwood Manor: Dawn (Elizabeth Berrington Crimson Petal and White) pregnant housemaid whose daughter Amy (Daisy Head) is 17, flirtatious, and eager to leave Manor temp service for modeling. 2nd, Julie (Melanie Hill The Street) cook and mother of 3rd, Sarah, the Manor house manager who also bought into the tickets. 4th Sean (Richard Rankin Outlander) the new, young estate manager, and 5th is Godfrey (Lenny Henry Broadchurch) who is fantastic and steals every scene hes in, often with only a single line and look. His performance alone is worth the price of this set. Also expect to see Simon Williams (Upstairs, Downstairs) and Polly Walker (Prisoners Wives Mr Selfridge) who plays DI Baker.

7373489,5,B01025N31A,"A quirky group people working at a struggling and rundown manor house pool their money for the lottery. On the night that the Syndicate win the lotto, one of their own goes missing and a tangled web of characters and deceptions are uncovered by the police. Never knowing who or what may be uncovered, ""The Syndicate-Season 3"" does not fail to disappoint. Each episode focus on a different character's point-of-view and past history, while in the present, things are escalating quickly.
  A modern mystery with high stakes and amazing performances. Most extraordinary is Godfrey (Lenny Henry), who's Asperger Syndrome makes him a target and a compelling character. Also noteworthy are Sarah Travers (Cara Theobold), the long suffering manager of the failing Hazelwood Manor. She is strong and steady and through Ms. Theobold's touching performance, a person you are rooting for to the end. Another great performance is given by Richard Rankin, as Sean McGary, the handyman and stable boy. Mr. Rankin's performance creates instant likeability and charm, therefore an air of mystery and tension is further amped up to a breaking point when he expertly reveals his side of the story. Everyone has a secret and everyone has a motive and it captivates the audience.
  The writing, directing, and acting in this piece is stellar. You will never guess the end-game and this engaging and addictive show will not disappoint. In the days of Cop & Medical dramas, this feels like a modern day Agatha Christie ""who done it"" with the modern stakes and sensibilities that we crave. Any easy show to binge-watch and worth every penny. Bravo to the cast & crew! This show is one for the collection.",1471392000,3,1681,4.992857142857143
7373490,5,B01025N31A,"I watched the Syndicate when it was on BBC One last year.  This series was very well made and kept me guessing from the first.

They are all unique stand alone seasons, so you don't need to see the previous ones to catch up. I watched during the UK airing, Many said it's a modern day Downton Abbey crossed with Broadchurch. Kay Mellor is a master at making you really care about her characters' lives. With master actors such as Anthony Andrews from Brideshead Revisited and Alice Krige of Star Trek, and British icons such as Lenny Henry, Melanie Hill, and Elizabeth Berrington. As well as up and coming brilliant new stars to watch, like the luminous and magnetic Cara Theobold from Downton Abbey, and the emotional powerhouse Richard Rankin from The Crimson Field, just recently seen in Outlander.
