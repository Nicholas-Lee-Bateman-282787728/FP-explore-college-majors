8221787,3,B000W9288G,"James Landis was a really swell guy, and my dad worked on this movie.  I was just a kid, but he's told stories about being in the Black Hills of South Dakota shooting this film with Jim, my whole life I've heard tales.  I've watched this film, and it challenges Ed Wood's work on many levels - it's so bad it's good, and you really shouldn't miss it.  You could call it PLAN 9 FROM DEADWOOD.  Really humorous (sometimes unintentionally) and I love it.",1378512000,,451,4.333333333333333
