8027936,5,B0002GTR5Q,"I just finished viewing this film. It is mysterious and beautiful, a poem delving into deep relationships between men, especially between father and son.  To do so it dances with issues as incest, pure and holy affection and homoeroticism.  It doesn't pause on any of these, which is why it is profound and ultimately a work of art.  I highly recommend it, but note to readers that it is not a story with a beginning, middle and end.  It is a poem.",1116028800,4,448,4.426829268292683
