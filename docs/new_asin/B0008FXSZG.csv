2259324,2,B0008FXSZG,"This movie is alright as far as the story goes. I never saw the week long video that another reviewer spoke of so I didn't miss anything. I also liked that they talk rationally of things that happen in a hurricane and hurricane preparedness given that we live in a hurricane prone area.

However, listening to Big Bird whine through the whole movie is unbelievably annoying. I don't really like Big Bird usually because all he ever does is whine, but I can usually ignore him. But this movie takes place around Big Birds experience during the hurricane, so it's kind of hard to ignore him.

I think there are plenty of other Sesame Street movies that I would buy over this one. In fact, I would buy ANY OTHER Sesame Street video over this one because of Big Birds whining. I don't really want my child to learn from his behavior either.",1152662400,,836,4.457516339869281
2259325,2,B0008FXSZG,"This is probably the one video that gets on my nerves!!

Big Bird does nothing but whine the whole entire time about his nest being destroyed. Even when everyone is trying to help  repair it, he still isn't happy. His voice just grates on my ears.

My daughter really likes it though, so what can I say.",1139788800,,303,4.280701754385965
2259326,3,B0008FXSZG,"I first saw 'Hurricane on Sesame Street' when it aired on my local PBS station. It was very well done and took place over the course of five episodes.

I was, at first, thrilled to hear that it was going to be put on DVD. And I thought, ""Wonderful. The entire show on DVD!""

They edited out too much of it for me to enjoy it. It was edited down to roughly 50 minutes. They took out several parts. Such as the cleanup of Sesame Street. Telly making an odd shaped X on his window, worrying while the hurricane raged. Big Bird sleeping in the apartment. The stories to help Big Bird fall asleep. And Granny Bird telling Big Bird his nest needed ""The Final Twig."" All these were missing from the DVD.

I understand that some editing was needed. But it could have been done better.

It would still be good for the younger kids, however. Who may or may not remember the week long show in it's entirety.",1133136000,6,896,4.252941176470588

8056145,3,B0008FXSZG,"My daughter loves Elmo (who doesn't).  This isn't her favorite video, but it does allow mom to explain disasters.  Especially where we live, we have hurricanes.  So the video does help discuss natural disasters, and how friends and family come together to support and help one another.  Her favorite video would be ""elmos best 2 years"" or the classics.  I would still recommend the video.",1362614400,,388,4.907692307692308
8056146,5,B0008FXSZG,Big Bird looses his home and his positive outlook but all his friends help him out. This story teaches kids how to cope with difficult situations and how to come out of them successfully. Granny Bird is the best!,1203724800,,212,4.461538461538462
8056147,3,B0008FXSZG,"This is a more issue-oriented ""Sesame Street"" episode, showing step by step what it's like to be in a hurricane... Yay, just in time for global warming!

Anyway, this might be too scary or anxiety-provoking for really little kids, and maybe not of that much interest to families not living in hurricane-prone areas.  The title is a little misleading: theme of friendship is secondary to the bigger issue of the hurricane, although everyone does band together and help each other out.  Good demonstration of community values, but not the most pleasant or enjoyable ""Sesame"" adventure.

PS - the new, post-Jim Henson voice for Kermit The Frog is just terrible.  Maybe they should have retired the character.",1186099200,2,705,5.043103448275862
8056148,2,B0008FXSZG,"We only made it through the first 1/3 of this DVD before our 2-year old wanted us to change DVD's (and that was after she walked out of the room for a few minutes).  The first third seems to have too much talking by non-muppets, which my toddler did not care about.  Also, a 2-year old does not really care about taping up windows and getting jugs of water.  I may fast forward to when big bird's nest is destroyed and see if the DVD gets better.",1154995200,,446,4.103448275862069
