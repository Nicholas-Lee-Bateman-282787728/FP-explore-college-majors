8633319,5,B00HLT0YS6,"This is a must have for anyone that owns the movie ""Cromwell"" or is interested in that period of history. The reason this movie is important & relevant to those who own the movie ""Cromwell"" is that ""Cromwell"" almost deifies Cromwell's character & while ""The Crimson Blade"" doesn't even show Cromwell it does show his historical clay feet, played out through Lionel Jefferies character who accurately depicts Cromwell's radical policies' towards the crown & the extending lines of Royalty! Cromwell was fanatical with his Protestant belief's & guilty of war atrocities never pointed out in the movie ""Cromwell"". ""The Crimson Blade"" shows us the fear & certain threat of death that would have been felt by anyone with Royal ties or Catholic belief's or even spoke out against Cromwell! I had gotten so used to seeing Lionel Jefferies playing roles of goofy comic relief that watching ""The Crimson Blade"" has given me a whole new appreciation for the mans talent as a actor!!! There is nothing goofy about Lionel Jefferies character in this movie, I would never have guessed he could appear so threatening & dangerous!!! While what Cromwell did for England was good in the long run, he wasn't the squeaky clean character we see in the movie ""Cromwell"" so ""The Crimson Blade"" is a great period piece to show the truly conflicting attitudes of the time & show Cromwell's clay feet by virtue of telling the story from the side of his opposition. While I wouldn't hesitate recommending this movie to lovers of history & period pieces because there is a lack of movies covering this subject matter, I am a bit hesitant recommending this as a action packed sword swinging adventure. Don't get me wrong this movie does have some good action but I think it has stronger merit as a period piece than a swashbuckler. As far as the picture & sound quality it is great! If your expecting ""The Crimson Pirate"" steer clear, if you want a peek at the grim reality of a Britain in revolution, when saying the wrong thing might get your head lopped off then you might want to give it a go!",1420156800,,2069,4.718232044198895
8633320,4,B00HLT0YS6,"Oliver Reed once said that ""Hammer gave me my start, (Michael) Winner gave me my craft, and (Ken) Russell gave me my art."" Well in 1963's THE SCARLET / CRIMSON BLADE you can see the arrival of the Oliver Reed we all know 5 years before his international success in OLIVER!. Here he crystallizes his screen trademarks. The quiet voice that can suddenly erupt, the smoldering look of rage and/or pain, and his sheer physical presence that can dominate the screen. This was Reed's penultimate film with Hammer (out of 6) and he owns the movie. Although the nominal stars are Lionel Jeffries (usually known for comic roles in movies like CHITTY CHITTY BANG BANG but quite good here), Jack Hedley and June Thornburn, Reed's portrayal of the adventurer Captain Tom Sylvester is clearly the focus of the film. Writer-director John Gilling, who made a number of films for Hammer including the celebrated ""Cornish Double Feature"" THE PLAGUE OF THE ZOMBIES and THE REPTILE, had worked with Reed before on THE PIRATES OF BLOOD RIVER showing that he could handle the actor as well as make a well mounted period action-adventure movie.

The story is set in 1648. Colonel Judd (Jeffries), once a royalist but now a follower of Cromwell, is trying to capture King Charles I to further his own career. Sylvester (Reed) is his second in command and has eyes for Judd's daughter Claire (Thornburn) who is secretly helping the local Royalists led by Edward Beverly (Hedley) aka The Scarlet Blade. Claire exploits Sylvester's feelings for her while really loving Beverly. When Sylvester realizes this he is none too pleased but, rather than flying into a typical rage, Reed internalizes his anger and makes us feel his character's pain and sadness at what has happened. The rest of the film is a solid period adventure yarn with swordfights and ambushes and an authentic look to the film despite the low budget. In fact parts of this film reminded me of Michael Reeves' WITCHFINDER GENERAL with Vincent Price made 5 years later only less brutal. This DVD-R of the American version (hence the title change) is its first appearance ever and the transfer, like all of Sony/Columbia's other DVD-R releases is first rate. Not a great film by any means but a surprisingly engaging one thanks to Oliver Reed.",1409356800,,2281,4.848717948717948
