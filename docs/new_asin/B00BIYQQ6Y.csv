5624712,5,B00BIYQQ6Y,"This message has a very strong message to get across to its viewers and although it seems harsh, it was spoken in truth! This movie will help many who need help with addiction & the only true help comes from God!",1377734400,,212,4.195121951219512
5624713,5,B00BIYQQ6Y,"I am still impressed with this movie! It provides the viewer with a clear picture of satan's destruction in a person's life, as the scripture says "" the thief cometh but to steal, kill, and destroy, but Jesus came that we might have life and that more abundantly.
when Mr. Champion turned to GOD for his answers to the problems in his life, he received the GOD kind of turn around that only GOD could have given him and his family even in the midst of trials!
In my opinion, this is a winner of a movie",1374192000,,502,4.185567010309279
5624714,4,B00BIYQQ6Y,"A little detail....... when you watch this flick...which is a very good flick.... you might notice the camera always did close-ups on Val.
As much as Val wanted to look like Jesus... I just can't imagine Jesus weighing in at over 300 lbs!!!

Otherwise, this video was professionally done; near perfect editing, dialog and filming really professional.  It is such a good thing Christian movie-making has become professional instead of well-meaning church-goers who use their home video cameras to make a ""movie""...

I digress.........the acting is very natural and the actors all fit in with what they needed to do.  The movie is thought provoking and warms the heart.  Everything fit in it's place at the right time.  This is NOT a ""holy-roller"" film.  It is good Christian movie making and it is well done....Just don't expect Val to be in every frame..",1372723200,,854,4.93006993006993

5624718,5,B00BIYQQ6Y,"I've been waiting for this film to be available on DVD for some time (ever since I heard the music from it). I finally got it and I'm not disappointed in the least. It was worth the wait.  It's amazing that it's a true story and a real testament to the human spirit.  The main character overcomes a severe bout with alcoholism after loosing everything he cared about.  He not only rebuilt his life and was tremendously successful, but what he did with his life from then on, is really amazing.
I highly recommend this film to anyone who has ever battled substance abuse or knows anyone who has.
Bravo!",1367884800,6,601,4.445454545454545
