3153440,5,B001675ZK6,I love soul food!!! I think that season four's release was skipped. Please release season four. It just wouldn't be the same with out the whole set.,1210809600,,148,4.518518518518518
3153441,5,B001675ZK6,"When I'd seen Soul Food the motion picture, I really enjoyed it.  When it was developed into a TV series; I thought how could they turn a movie such as this into a series, it'll never work.  Unfortunately, I ignored it, and it was not until the year that it went off the air that I watched it.  Man was I wrong.  I happened to be deployed w/ the State Dept my boss suggested the series (DVDs) to me in my spare time.  I was blown away!  It was so good that upon my return stateside I began looking for subsequent seasons.

Suffice it to say, I've never looked back, I love the series and find it very much representative of the black family.  It's entertaining, funny, serious, sad, and thought provoking.  Soul Food the series is time well spent.",1210464000,,747,4.2785714285714285
3153442,5,B001675ZK6,"I just love watching soulfood, from the first to the season finale.  There's just one thing, what happen to season 4?  Too bad, they don't have anymore seasons.  I'm just sad to see that it's not a running show anymore.  I recommend anyone to purchase and watch soulfood.  It's a Masterpiece.",1210291200,,292,4.647058823529412
3153443,5,B001675ZK6,"What an excellent series...I've been hooked ever since the 1st episode. I don't think the complete 2 & 3rd series has ever been on TV in the UK., (we miss out on a lot over here), so i was desperate to get hold of the 3rd series, which incidently includes the 4th series, very misleading and dissapointing. I was looking forward to many more episodes, however, I am relieved that the final series is being released fairly soon after the 3rd series. I've been hunting day and night to find out what happens next and can't wait. Why aren't more African-American programmes which promote values and sisterhood with riveting and brilliant storylines like this on television?..It is a shame..perhaps one day we will get there...Roll on July 8th. I've got the popcorn, pizza and pepsi ready!!!",1209772800,7,787,4.794117647058823

Too bad the show had to close - the story lines offered all aspects of the Black Family Life. Each episode held my attention to the end. The actors and actresses were all superb.

3153490,5,B001675ZK6,"After long awaiting the final season of Soul Food, it arrived.  I was one of the few in America who did not like the narrative film Soul Food. Too much drama, too little character development; and moreover, it showed a flatten out images of African Americans.  So one day while cruising through a huge chain store that has a wonderful selection of Black films, I stumbled across the first season of Soul Food.  I purchased because of the low price and I've been hooked ever since.  Even though it has been years since the series originally aired, and I am not a cable or satellite television subscriber, I have had to wait until the seasons were issued on DVD.  So there is some redemption in it all. The characters were able to be given life.  And the cast has been awesome.

One of the reasons I disliked the movie is the boyfriend stealing of Maxine.  And the family appears to have accepted Kenny as a natural choice.  That rings odd in my world.  Oftentimes I've asked individuals about dating a family member's ""ex.""  And it's been taboo.  However, there seems to be no such code of ethics in this family.  But apparently it happens, albeit strange.

Moreover, the final season does bring some sadness.  I guess nothing lasts forever.  Of course I did expect some of Terry's issues to straightened out by more than a voiceover by Ahmad in the end.

All in all, this was definitely worth the purchase.  Now it's time to rewatch. I'll start with season one.",1219017600,,1461,4.553846153846154

I have purchased all the seasons on dvd, and this one is my 2nd favorite, next to season 1. The cast and writers did an amazing job with this one. It wasn't predictable at all! One shock after another. I would definitely recommend purchasing it.",1218585600,,359,4.294117647058823

I really hated that it had to end,but Iam glad that the producer were able to go off the air gracefully. Its a wonderfully series and there will probably not be another one like this show  for a  a long time.  Maybe one day they could do a reunion show to show how the joseph sisters are still going strong.

3153495,5,B001675ZK6,"First of all let me say that I LOVE SOUL FOOD! I have all of the shows on DVD. However, I am somewhat disappointed in the fact that this series looks a little ""grainy"" as compared to the others and I played them in my HD DVD player which upconverts the disc. Don't get me wrong, with playing them in a HD player the quality gets better, but the ""grain"" is still vey noticeable. Maybe I'm a little spoiled by HD and Blu ray to the fact that ""regular"" DVD does not look good anymore. Anyway, I am wondering if anyone else out there has noticed the same thing. Also why are these series NOT in DD 5.1? this Dolby ""stereo"" does not get the job done! all in all I love all 5 disc set that I have.

I'm still wondering why this show didn't last past 5 seasons?",1217635200,,754,4.026666666666666

When each season debuted, I was already preordered!  I got my FINAL SEASON DVD yesterday and am sad to say I'm disappointed.  Not with the show at all, but because it looks like the set was designed for a wide screen tv.  I DON'T HAVE A WIDE SCREEN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Other than the show does not disappoint.

This is a series that will be forever steeped in the glorious tradition of great shows.  Also, did you know that most people don't even know about this series.

I was in a ""zone"" when watching soul food, it was literally like the outside world did not exist for the 45 mns that the show was on. I was a lucky fan that got to meet Boris Kodjoe this year in Miami and that was a dream come true. There are real hardcore Soul Food fans out there and I strongly believe they should consider working on a Soul Food reunion movie just like Sex in the city. If this does happen I'll be the first one in line. In the meantime, I am glad to have bought the entire 5 seasons on DVD, it is truly the best gift that I have given to myself.

When it was developed into a TV series; I thought how could they turn a movie such as this into a series, it'll never work.  Unfortunately, I ignored it, and it was not until the year that it went off the air that I watched it.  Man was I wrong.  I happened to be deployed w/ the State Dept my boss suggested the series (DVDs) to me in my spare time.  I was blown away!  It was so good that upon my return stateside I began looking for subsequent seasons.

Suffice it to say, I've never looked back, I love the series and find it very much representative of the black family.  It's entertaining, funny, serious, sad, and thought provoking.  Soul Food the series is time well spent.",1210464000,,747,4.2785714285714285

3387987,5,B001675ZK6,"After long awaiting the final season of Soul Food, it arrived.  I was one of the few in America who did not like the narrative film Soul Food. Too much drama, too little character development; and moreover, it showed a flatten out images of African Americans.  So one day while cruising through a huge chain store that has a wonderful selection of Black films, I stumbled across the first season of Soul Food.  I purchased because of the low price and I've been hooked ever since.  Even though it has been years since the series originally aired, and I am not a cable or satellite television subscriber, I have had to wait until the seasons were issued on DVD.  So there is some redemption in it all. The characters were able to be given life.  And the cast has been awesome.

One of the reasons I disliked the movie is the boyfriend stealing of Maxine.  And the family appears to have accepted Kenny as a natural choice.  That rings odd in my world.  Oftentimes I've asked individuals about dating a family member's ""ex.""  And it's been taboo.  However, there seems to be no such code of ethics in this family.  But apparently it happens, albeit strange.

Moreover, the final season does bring some sadness.  I guess nothing lasts forever.  Of course I did expect some of Terry's issues to straightened out by more than a voiceover by Ahmad in the end.

All in all, this was definitely worth the purchase.  Now it's time to rewatch. I'll start with season one.",1219017600,,1461,4.553846153846154

Don't get me wrong, with playing them in a HD player the quality gets better, but the ""grain"" is still vey noticeable. Maybe I'm a little spoiled by HD and Blu ray to the fact that ""regular"" DVD does not look good anymore. Anyway, I am wondering if anyone else out there has noticed the same thing.

3387997,5,B001675ZK6,"This show really set the bar high.  This is a really thoughtful and provacative show that was really not that I think about it way before its time.  This TV series took the essential bare bones concept of the original movie to a whole other level.  I challenge you to watch this series from beginning to end and not be moved. This is a series that will be forever steeped in the glorious tradition of great shows.  Also, did you know that most people don't even know about this series.  It is one of those secrets that are pleasant surprises.  This is good fun.",1213747200,,561,4.346153846153846
3387998,5,B001675ZK6,"I am so happy to see that others love the show just as much as I do.  I am at work right now and went out on Amazon to find another movie and was elated to see that the final season of Soul Food would be out in July.  I must admit, I thought the show was five season long, however, as long as I collect all of the seasons I will be happy.  I hated when the show ended and still to this day miss the show greatly.  This show was my ""Woosa""  from hustle of the day.  It was my way to escape.  To all of the fans of the show enjoy the final season.  For those of you who have not had the pleasure of viewing this series.... I promise you won't be disappointed.",1213056000,,657,3.7445255474452557
3387999,5,B001675ZK6,"I absolutely LOVE this show. I watched all 5 seasons religiously and would not miss any episodes for anything. I was in a ""zone"" when watching soul food, it was literally like the outside world did not exist for the 45 mns that the show was on. I was a lucky fan that got to meet Boris Kodjoe this year in Miami and that was a dream come true. There are real hardcore Soul Food fans out there and I strongly believe they should consider working on a Soul Food reunion movie just like Sex in the city. If this does happen I'll be the first one in line. In the meantime, I am glad to have bought the entire 5 seasons on DVD, it is truly the best gift that I have given to myself.  I'll be enjoying this collection for a long long time.",1212883200,,733,4.02054794520548
3388000,5,B001675ZK6,"I loved Soul Food when the movie came out, but this show (in my opinion) KILLS the movie!  I watched Soul Food when it started coming on Showtime, and I loved it.  I might have cried when it got cancelled.  I LOVE this show!  I CANNOT wait until this comes out! This is the best way to relax after a long day...get a nice (oversized...lol) glass of some good Moscato, kick your feet up, and relax with the Joseph family!  Doesn't get much better than this...",1212537600,,458,4.27906976744186
3388001,5,B001675ZK6,When they were oringinally aired on Showtime seasons 3 and 4 were only like 10 episodes each. I tihnk I read somewhere they had production problems.(Which means the cast were probaly smelling themselves and wanted more money). So both seasons were short therefore released on DVD as one season to give us 20 episodes. So we are not getting ripped off or shorted a season. Hope this helps!!!!!!!!!!,1212537600,28,397,4.852941176470588
