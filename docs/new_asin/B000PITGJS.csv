8191931,4,B000PITGJS,"I don't know what the previous reviewer's problem is.  Maybe he expected it to be something that it's not.  No, it's not the Muppets.  Of course not.  But it's not funded by a multi-million dollar Disney budget, either.  What it is, however, is a an enjoyable indie kid's film, with cute characters, a lot of heart, and a great message.  All the kids I know who've watched it have absolutely loved it - I guess they're not as conditioned to equate expensive production values with high quality as some of us.  I'd take this any day over most of the slickly-produced, feature-length toy commercials Disney churns out.

It's not in the same league as Henson's original Muppet Movie, certainly - but very few things are, even at 10x the budget.  A better comparison would be to his early work on things like ""Sam and Friends"" where he was working with little or no money.  His wit and creativity were apparent, no matter the circumstances, and the creators of ""Harvey"" have similarly done a fine job of overcoming their technical/budgetary limitations to create an enjoyable diversion, especially for their target audience.  Come to it with an open mind, and I think you'll enjoy it, too.",1200355200,2,1185,4.759803921568627
8191932,5,B000PITGJS,"This movie is a very good movie for your children.  It  teaches them values in life and to trust in God for everything.  It also teaches them self worth.  Even though Harvey feels that he is worthless, he comes to realize that God is in control and will help him if he will just trust in him.  I think this movie is a very good movie for the whole family, especially children, to teach us all values in life. As cruel as this world is today, we all need something to give us a good laugh while inspiring us to go on with life.",1199836800,3,526,4.019230769230769
8191933,1,B000PITGJS,"The above two reviewers were either high or in league with the Wards (who acted in, produced, and gutted stuffed animals which were then used as puppets within the film). This is a sorry excuse for entertainment that is to the Muppets as sewer water is to champagne. I could have overlooked the shoddy workmanship, bad acting, and dirty camara lenses had it at least been mildly funny, however, any attmepts at comedy fell far short. This film takes place in a variety of sets, the kitchen, the garage, the barn, the backyard, and the church parking lot. I could go on but let's not get mean. This is a home movie that does not deserve any association with the greatness that is The Muppets.",1198627200,2,691,4.536

8191935,5,B000PITGJS,Harvey the Wonder Monster is a great film.  It's amazing what they did with the budget they had.  It's funny and a great movie for the whole family.  The kids will love it.  This is a must have for anyone who loves the Muppets.  This is a must have for fans of superhero movies.  Lets face it this movie is just a must have period.,1177977600,3,331,4.015384615384615
