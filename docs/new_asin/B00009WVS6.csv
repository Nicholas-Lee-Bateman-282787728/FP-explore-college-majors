I personally haven't watched the entire thing, only bits and pieces at school. But of those bits and pieces they were very informative, and often times shocking.

I've watched a clip on the Tamil Tigers, Chemical warfare during WWI and WWII, the Irgun, and a few others. It only makes me anxious to see more of whats in store. IF anyone can find it at a lower price than here on Amazon i'd love to know.

So honestly if you are as willing to learn about things as I am, you'll probably find your eyes glued to the entire showing of this DVD set.",1178236800,4,671,4.275590551181103
7994114,1,B00009WVS6,This movie was good but was worth about three fifty.  And I got conned for paying 65 dollars for this nickle and dime film.  But good film if you can get it for under 5 dollars (which would include shipping and handling of course). So that means somebody would have to be selling the film for about two dollars.  Great movie netherthelessy.,1075766400,,340,4.451612903225806
