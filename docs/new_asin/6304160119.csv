802153,5,6304160119,"I thought this movie was wonderful. I have always dreamt of getting into Narnia and seeing Aslan. I recommend the other videos and books: The Magican's Nephew, The Horse and His Boy, Prince Caspian, The Voyage of Dawn  Treader, The Silver Chair, and The Last Battle. It helps teach children  their values and how to not be selfish or greedy. Kids will love this video  and will want to watch it over and over again.",923184000,2,415,4.506666666666667
802204,2,6304160119,"Hoping for a good visual treatment of Lewis' Narnia books, I ordered this tape. My kids and I were appalled by the adult actors in cheaply made animal costumes, as well as the creepy special effects for all the non-actor animals apart from Aslan (looks like all the $$$ went into Aslan).
Now with all the great digital computer animation possible, will someone please redo this series, a la Harry Potter or Lord of the Rings?",1037145600,4,425,4.605263157894737
802205,1,6304160119,"Hello! Just like to say that the video is NOT as good as the book. There are so many cheap effects. The lion Aslan is like an old old man with athritis or something... basically a big cat in a puppet suit. The characters are a big dissapointment too. The character of Lucy is too childish. Peter looks younger than Edmund. All ""special"" creatures (except dwarfs) are full-sized men or women in puppet suits (imagine the GIANT-size Beaver). The video is still too expensive. It is actually a BBC and Wonderworks production. They're the same thing, so don't get tricked if you only see ""wonderworks"". Definitely NOT for adults, you'll find it too childish and even ridiculous to look at. For the kids--stick to the book!!!",1035676800,2,720,4.722222222222222
802206,5,6304160119,"I watched this movie on [T.V.]... when I was a young girl and absolutely fell in love with the story.  Not having read the book, it made me want to learn more about these wonderful children and their adventures.  I have waited for years for [them] to repeat the series, preferably around the winter holidays and thought I might never get to see it again.  It's so great that it's available on DVD/VHS so that one day my own children can see how wonderful these stories are.  The special effects might be dated, considering the sophistication of today's childrens' films, but like all classics, it's a timeless production that never loses its charm. My only hope is that PBS shows it more regularly so that more people will know about this wonderful production of their favorite children's series. Amazon should refer people who love the novels to this video site as well!!",1034035200,11,872,4.717105263157895
802207,4,6304160119,"We rented this movie while we were overseas, and had to extend the rental period several times, as it became a hit for the entire neighborhood.  The animated version does not do justice to the story, but this version follows nearly word for word.  Granted, it isn't made with special effects to rival modern sci-fi or fantasy movies, so if your children pay more attention to the special effects than to the story, then this might not be for you.  Perhaps someday soon someone will remake the story with modern technology, but until then, this remains in my opinion second only to reading the book.",1027296000,4,598,4.6761904761904765
802208,2,6304160119,"This movie was amazingly [dull]. I can't believe all the good reviews it got. Maybe we were watching different movies? The costumes and makeup were really bad. The acting was overdone or underdone, but never believable. Even my kids agreed it was pretty bad. I love the books and I enjoy Christian themes. But just because I want something with a religious theme doesn't mean I'll settle for something bad just because it includes some Christian allegory. Do yourself a favor and just read the book.",1023494400,17,499,4.813953488372093
802209,5,6304160119,"This film version of Lewis's classic tale remains very true to the book and is very well done.  I do recommend that you read the book in order to truly appreciate the story.  By the way,the music at the beginning is so beautiful that it makes me cry!",1022025600,2,250,4.1875
7863923,5,6304160119,Great addition to my family movie library. I grew up watching this and used it in my school lesson plans quite often. The tapes were ing great shape. Thanks,1448582400,,156,4.413793103448276
7863924,3,6304160119,"The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe (1988) on 2 cassettes, edited to a single feature. I have seen three versions of this story, plus read the original novel. On the whole the most enchanting version  was the one made by the Children's Television Workshop in 1979--as I was the right age for it then. Much later, when I saw that version again, I could only remark on how poor the quality of the animation it was. Yet it stuck mostly to the novel, which I read after seeing the 1979 TV animated film.
  Much later I saw the Walden Media theatrical version of 2005 and was very much impressed with it. Only now (2014) have I seen this BBC 1988 Tv version. It is adequate but only adequate. The special effects are poor, the animation shoddy and a joke. The white witch overacts and shouts too much. I prefer Tilda Swinton's more more subdued performance. Also, the two other versions have Edmond thrown into the white witch's dungeon-- which does not happen here. The beavers are silly and rather bourgeois, perhaps on purpose. The costumes are not very good except Aslan who does indeed look like a real lion. One major fault is the casting of Richard Demsey as Peter. He is much too young. The novel and the other film versions show Peter and Susan as young adults. The BBC version has them as all children. I would say it is not a bad film, but I was not impressed. It began well, but by the big battle near the end the story's presentation began to strain and I was bored.
  PRINCE CASPIAN
 THIS DATES FROM 1989. THIS APPEARS ON THE FIRST CASSETTE OF THE BOX LABELED PRINCE CASPIAN AND THE VOYAGE OF THE DAWN TREADER. It is announced on the tape as Part One, but it is two episodes edited together. It is also only 59 minutes long. The story is abbreviated from the novel -- too much so and is much shorter than the Walden Media version of 2008. Nevertheless, though the story is simplified it is still enjoyable -- at least for children, less so for adults. The animation is still terrible, but an improvement of the Lion of 1988. Aslan appears, and again the lip sync is ridiculously incompetent. The she-badger costume is better than the beavers costumes of the previous film. Prince Caspian has Lucy, Susan, and Edmond, and Peter.
  The plot however, has serious problems. Problems that are derived from the original novel. C.S. Lewis was terribly sexist and here Susan and Lucy were denied the right to fight by Aslan. They even protest, but are prohibited from combat. This despite Susan having a quiver of arrows and a magic bow. Also the prohibition of Peter and Susan from coming back to Narnia is ridiculous but is also found the original novel. Lewis had problems with adulthood--that is something a Freudian analyst should figure it out. Magic is used to disguise illogical plot developments. Here they become an annoyance as the arguments and presentation don't hold up. The production itself is low key, not exactly cheap, but it sometimes seems so. I think the plot has been overly simplified. All squashed into one hour.
THE VOYAGE OF THE DAWN TREADER This is on the second cassette of the box labeled Prince Caspian and the Voyage of the Dawn Treader. Made in 1989. The tape announces it is The Voyage of the Dawn Treader Episode II, which is deceptive as there is no other episode number given. The entire story is on this one cassette. Episode I is in fact Prince Caspian on the other cassette. This story shows a grown up King Caspian. Here it is Lucy, Edmond, and Eustace. Eustace thus only knows Caspian as an adult not as a child, something the director forgets at the very end of The Silver Chair. Caspian is on a quest to find seven lords, some turn out to be dead, some are found. The production is still rudimentary, but gets better as it goes on, to the point that I found the last half to be quite enjoyable. The scenes of Eustace as a dragon are too brief (Walden Media version had much long sequences of Eustace as a dragon) and not convincing. The special effects are still poor but the animated birds flying around Aslan's table on that final island are actually quite well done.
  On the whole a good, but not great effort to present The Voyage of the Dawn Treader. Some economies were made, and the Walden Media version is longer, includes more scenes. The BBC version cuts the encounter with sirens/mermaids that the Dawn Treader has to pass through. Also the Walden Media version has a considerable longer time with Eustace as a dragon. This happens much too quickly in the BBC version. The script is abridged a bit too much here and there. Well worth seeing, but rather undemanding. The whole point is to teach Eustace how to work with others and more cooperative. Somehow, what is really missing is a strong villain. The slave traders were won over too easily, and no other villain appears.
  THE SILVER CHAIR. Made in 1990. The first cassette says 111 minutes, but it is more like 150 minutes, definitely more than two hours. The story is slow and drags. The plot is obvious, a cliche from many fairy tales. I knew that Eustace, Jill, and Puddleglum were directed to the giants' castle by the green lady to be eaten as soon as she talked of the Feast. It is ridiculous, after so many heavy-handed hints, for the characters to be shocked when they find the receipes on how to cook Men and Marsh-wiggles. The special effects are adequate, but nothing special. However the forced perspective between the giants and the heroes is well done. Puddleglum is very interesting and entertaining, and the chief reason to watch the show, Tom Baker keeps up the eccentricities as a way to muddle through the adventures. He sometimes plays the fool to defend himself, but many times he reveals himself to be a wise man.
  The second cassette is only 57 minutes long. and feels rushed. While the first cassette was slow in unfolding and got boring, the second part of The Silver Chair had the heroes in the underground kingdom of the green lady, where they meet some one who is obviously Prince Rilian enchanted. He is neurotic yet courteous, bipolar, under a spell by the Queen Green Lady. When she finally arrives on the scene the last sign of Aslan's instructions have been carried out. The silver chair is a restraint for Rilian when he is sane, but he is free only when his amnesia returns. It is Puddleglum who releases the sane Rilian, and when at last the Queen of the Underworld comes, she lies and psychology to convince that her lies are truth and their truth are lies. (Sound like certain religions in this world). Eustace and Jill are hypnotized but not Puddleglum. Rilian eventually fights the green lady -- and she becomes a serpent. Moral of the story: all adult female authority figures are serpents that must be killed. C.S. Lewis has serious problems with women.
  Then the underworld collapses-- just like so many other sf and fantasy stories. The evil is slain and the world entirely collapses. I suspect Freudians would have a grand time dissecting the allegories in this story.  I would say the story ends rather too easily, even with some incongruities as a boyish spirit of Caspian going back to England just to frighten the school kids that were chasing Jill. And, Eustace never met the boy prince Caspian (that was Edmond), so that scene is nonsense.
  In the end the Christian allegory gets unwieldy as Aslan says he is known by another in their world. (Why, Jesus of course, but why not Krishna? He is just as real) The story is some times painfully old fashioned, and often sexist.  Where is the line drawn between young enough and too old to go to Narnia?",1401148800,,7615,4.589403973509934
7863925,5,6304160119,"Both children and adults will be enchanted with this magical adventure. In addition, older children and adults will see the strong Christian parallels in the story. Good clearly wins over evil as the Christ figure, Aslan the Lion, gives his life to redeem one of the child adventurers and then rises again to ensure the defeat of the wicked white witch. Christian adults will see and hear the strong biblical echoes.",1105142400,11,416,4.873239436619718
7863926,3,6304160119,"I love the books, and think of them as some of the best literature ever written.  I enjoyed watching the animated movie as a kid, but longed for something that was more real- namely, live action.  And in an age when Harry Potter is big, and The Lord of the Rings has been updated into live action from it's original animation, why not also Narnia?  And here it is.

It kept very close to the book, which was helpful.  And it is overwhelmingly British- which is just right, since Lewis was British and wrote about British children.  This is a production that needed to be done in England to do it right.  The acting is certainly superior to anything you see in Harry Potter, thank God- these children can actually act, and emote.  But as many have pointed out, the special effects really drag the movie down.  It's a bit odd, as the movie obviously has the money for location shooting that put it above a high-school project.  But every little while through the movie, you see bits that look like high-schoolers plugged sequences in.  The beavers look like people in costumes, with make-up.  There's no attempt to hide that they are people.  The wolf transforms (very sloppily) from a dog into a guy in a wolf costume, who doesn't look scary as much as humorous.  A bit of Babe or Animal Farm (live-action version) technology, with talking animals, would have done well here, and not have been that hard to do.  And the painted mythological creatures are really badly done.  A computer would have touched this up very easily, very cheaply, to make the special effects realistic- or even some costumes for mythological creatures.

The telling point is a final fight scene between Peter and a wolf, in which the background suddenly changes, inexplicably, into a set for a play, throughout the entire fight.  It was then that I realized that this would make an excellent play.  There was nothing wrong with the acting, or costumes, or sets, were this a play.  It just doesn't measure up to what we have come to expect from movies or even TV.

7863927,4,6304160119,"For those unfamiliar with the story, this is an allegory for the story of salvation through Jesus Christ.  Even without the spiritual understanding, however, it's a captivating fantasy story, part of a seven-book series written decades ago by British scholar/apologist C.S. Lewis, and this filmed version (originally broadcast on the BBC in England and on PBS in the States) does a beautiful job of capturing the spirit of the story and its characters.
My 5-year-old daughter, thankfully, loves it as much as I do.  The story essentially includes four London children in 1940 who are spending their school holiday (summer vacation) in the country, sent by parents who are worried for their lives in wartime in London, when Hitler was intent on bombing that city into oblivion.  They discover a hidden door to a magical world of fawns, nymphs, talking animals, giants, a white witch, and a majestic lion called Aslan.
And oh, what a lion!  If only the filmmakers had been able to better solve the problem of making a lion's mouth speak English.  Therein lies the only problem I have with anything about this film (first in a series of three films about the Narnia Chronicles).  The lion costume is spectacular otherwise, but the FX are severely curtailed by a BBC budget.  Some of the more magical creatures, when the filmmakers couldn't put an actor into a costume, were simply drawn, creating a jarring effect.  Even my 5-year-old asked why the flying horse was a drawing.
If this series could be redone with 21st-century FX and a ""Lord Of the Rings"" budget, it would be equally spectacular.  But we have what we have, and what we have is uplifting, enchanting, memorable, and thoroughly entertaining.  Suitably melodramatic at times, with the kind of uneven acting one might expect from children and other disguised little people, it plays like an upscale ""Doctor Who"" episode with a gospel overtone.  And yes, that's a good thing.  (In fact, ""Doctor Who"" actor Tom Baker plays a major role in the third part of this series, ""The Silver Chair."")",1045785600,20,2047,4.901449275362319
7863928,5,6304160119,"Excellent miniseries version of the classic C.S. Lewis tale. A talented cast, great script and a heartwarming musical score add extraordinary beauty to this BBC classic. Standing out in her performance is Barbara
