44581,5,0782010040,"This is one of the best (if not the best) war movies John Wayne ever did. Here he plays a hard-nosed leader but with a soft side too (which of course he doesn't show to his men). He was nominated for an Oscar (and should've won). He wouldn't be nominated for another 20 years, until True Grit. This shows how good of an actor Wayne really is. He is about the only great actor that could've done this great of a job with this movie. It has an excellent script and cast. It is drama, love, war, (sounds like Vietnam, doesn't it?) all into one unforgettable movie. It is a must for the true John Wayne fan.",1005868800,3,603,4.162393162393163
44582,4,0782010040,"John Wayne leads his men into battle in the Pacific in this film that pays tribute to the work done by the Marines during World War II.  Wayne plays it tough as the no-nonsense sergeant that clashes with marine John Agar, the son of his mentor.  The emphasis in this film is on the action, which is what it should be, although the usual stock characters are brought out to round out the supporting cast.  Real life battle footage is effectively mixed in with studio work to create a realistic feel to all that is happening.  When you watch a John Wayne war flick, you pretty much know what you're going to get, and this one hardly surprises.  But it is competently made, well acted by Wayne, and an easy way to fill in a couple of hours.",1003536000,2,737,4.311594202898551
44583,5,0782010040,"If John Thomason and Robert Leckie authored the written definition of what it is to be a Marine, Sergeant Stryker is the film definition.  As a retired Marine, I cannot count the number of offices I have entered to see John Wayne -- chin strap dangling and helmet cocked on his head -- staring back at me from a Sands of Iwo Jima poster. (Often, there is the caption added: ""Life is tough...but it's tougher if you're stupid!""
 In my office when I was a rifle company commander, it was next to my copy of the photo of ""THE"" flag raising.
My Dad was at Tarawa, and my generation of Marines idolized those who had fought their way across the Pacific.  This film is one of their lesser memorials.
After having seen it some 25 times, imagine my shock last week when, listening carefully as Sergeant Stryker sets his men in position on the first night at Tarawa, I heard for the first time ""...and McCarty, here.""
He should have gotten the Oscar.",1002585600,6,941,4.427745664739884
44584,5,0782010040,"John Wayne once again plays the all American hero. This time he trains a group of young men as a drill instructor in the Marines,then takes them into combat.  It,s generally routine Wayne stuff, but it has a good story,good cast and a lot of action.  If your not a Wayne fan you would probably give this a three,because John Wayne almost always plays John Wayne, but parts like this fit his mold.  I found it entertaining all through.",996969600,,434,4.468354430379747
44585,5,0782010040,"No one ever gave a performance in the 1940's about men at war like John Wayne! Sands Of Iwo Jima was the first film to give full credit to the Marines. By the time 1949 had come around (when this film was released) every branch had several films made about there own. Only the Marines had a few before, and they were far and few between each other. The film starts out as Cpl. Dunne (Arthur Franz) who is our narrator, informs us about his rifle squad. His squad saw action on Guadalcanal and from there on were battle harden Marines. Only himself Pfc. Bass (James Brown) and tough as nails Sgt. Stryker (John Wayne) survived to fight another day. When the squad is sent to New Zealand to recieve even more training. The new replacements just from the states arrive. Cpl. Thomas (Forrest Tucker), who already knows Stryker and hates him. The Flynn brothers from the city of Brotherly Love, who fight all the time (Richard Jaeckel and William Murphy.) and Pfc. Conway (John Agar) who's father fought on the ""Canal"" with Sgt. Stryker, he is only there because of ""tradition."" But the person that helps shape the film as a supporting actor is Pfc. Benny Regazzi (Wally Cassell) who gives a better than note worthy performance. Regazzi always carries a flag tucked into his shirt to raise over the island once it has been secured, but is always too late. The new formed squad heads to Tarawa, this is where the new state side men get there taste of combat. They go up against Japanese Marines, thats the best they got. From the begining Stryker and  Conway go at it all the time. Conway who hated his father for more than one reason, finds another reason to hate Stryker because of his admiration for Conways late father. Conway falls in love with a girl Allison Bromley (Adele Mara) and finds a reason to come back from the war. But in the end he can't help but hear a voice in the back of his mind saying he might not return to her. But he along with his men start a slow relationship of respect torward Stryker. Great editing is used to mix real combat footage with the actors in the film. In some places it is so real, one has to look closely to tell them apart. Even then you can't at times. Wayne's performance earned him along overdue Oscar nomination for Best Actor. Although he did not win. What he gave us was a believable, flawed, loving and troubled man at the same time. This war movie has stayed at the top of many list, and it is still loved to this day. Get the original black and white version. The color one just doesn't do it! Grade:B+",992822400,12,2550,4.414012738853503

44587,4,0782010040,"It is difficult to decide if the Duke is at his best in westerns or war pictures, but the Sands of Iwo Jima is Wayne at his hard-hitting, flag waving best.
The story follows U.S. Marine Corps sergeant John Stryker  from a stint as a boot-pusher through the brutal battle on the slopes of  Mount Suribachi.  The troops include everything you'd expect in a World War  II movie; the smart-mouthed, know-it-all rich kid; a street-wise hispanic  kid from a tough neighborhood; a pleasure-loving goof off and just about  every other stereotype of the American fighting man you can dream up.  Of  course, the Duke is there to guide them with just the right combination of  verbal wisdom and right-crosses.  There's even a healthy serving of  sentimentality to round out the tour of cliches.
Nonetheless, the Sands  of Iwo Jima rises above its predictability to be a solidly entertaining  action film and a rousing tribute to the tenacity, sense of self-sacrifice  and fighting spirit of the Marine Corps.  Despite its rampant and obvious  emotionalism, you can't help but feel a lump in your throat as The Shores  of Tripoli is played to segue from the final scenes into the closing  credits.
Like most Wayne pictures, the emphasis here is on the action,  and the movie provides plenty of it, mixing actual combat footage, stock  film and original cinematography into a tightly knit, effective  product.
This may not be the best picture John Wayne ever made, but it's  way up the list.  Highly recommended for anyone who loves action films,  Mom, the Flag and Apple Pie, or the Duke himself.",947116800,31,1584,4.824626865671642

Just two things (not really spoilers, but you've been warned): 1) In the fight between John Wayne and Forrest Tucker, Wayne's first punch sounds before he actually strikes Tucker; 2) Wayne meets a lady in a night spot and goes back to her place.  When she leaves for a couple of minutes to get more liquor, he hears a noise in another room and opens the door.  There's a baby boy in crib.  So the mother was out and left the kid home alone for who knows how long.  I just thought that was odd.  But otherwise, this was a generally solid movie.",1503532800,,703,4.225563909774436

44657,4,0782010040,"With the possible exception of Terence Malick's superb ""The Thin Red Line"", ""Sands of Iwo Jima"" is the best and most entertaining movie covering the Pacific theatre of the Second World War, and particularly the landings at Tarawa and Iwo Jima. As one song pointed out, John Wayne did not fight on Iwo Jima, but watching his performance today you feel that perhaps he could have done. He was deservedly Oscar nominated for his portrayal of tough Marine Sergeant John M Stryker, but eventually lost out to Broderick Crawford. Tough sergeant John Strycker leads a troublesome group of new recruits into battle. John Wayne plays his usual stereotype tough guy but does what he does very well and like his men you do find yourself warming up to Strycker. Based on a true story, the infamous battle of Iwo Jima this has very good performances from the whole cast and good battle scenes but although they are often interwoven with actual newsreel footage I could easily discern every time the real scenes from the fictional ones, hence it loses one star. Perhaps it's the way actual Marines moved on the battlefield, or the load they carried, or how they took cover than no actor, however well taught, could imitate. But a film made so closely to the actual era is surely unbeatable in terms of authenticity regarding the faces, the attitudes, the material, the scenery and the language.

44694,5,0782010040,"Although a great movie, this Blu-Ray transfer leaves a lot to be desired.  It's not a bad transfer, just not anything better than good.  It's hard to believe it was a transfer from original film elements, because the resolution, clarity and sharpness seem more on par with DVD quality rather than Blu-Ray.  One thing that makes a good Blu-ray noticeable is how the fabric of shirts and dresses appears in close-ups and closer shots.  Blu-Ray transfers allow us to see the makeup of the fabric.  You can nearly see the thread count.  But DVD quality won't show this.  This transfer gives the impression of being a DVD quality transfer that was put on a Blu-Ray.  Disappointing in that respect, but the movie itself, regardless of being an inferior transfer, is still a great movie.",1484524800,6,780,4.768656716417911

No one seems to appreciate that discipline and watching each others back might just keep them alive.

I have been trying to replace many of our VHS tapes with DVDs, so I decided to start with the husbands stuff because most of my movies are already DVDs and he has a lot more VHS than I do.  I thought it would be nice to give him these for Christmas this year because he is a bit hard to buy for, he already has enough clothes and such and tools, etc.  So I figured this is what I would do this year.  By buying some of the DVDs with several movies on them, I have already been able to replace all of his John Wayne Collection and then some.

This review is primarily about the Blu Ray transfer, which yielded decent video quality, considering how old the film masters would be, but terrible audio, which is mono only, and could not be decoded by my consumer-grade Samsung 2010-era Blu Ray player.  A recently acquired higher-end Oppo player does decode the mono audio track, but the signal is of limited usability except to play 'as-is' (strictly mono thru center channel of my 5.1 layout).  This blu ray disc could certainly have used some audio post-processing to deliver a much better audio experience to a wider variety of players.

I got out  my DVD of The Sands of Iwo Jima and started to watch it.  To my surprise the items that I mentioned in the Blu-ray version were not to be found in the DVD version.  Also the DVD had a bonus feature, the making of Sands of Iwo Jima that the  Blu-ray  didn't have.

44980,2,0782010040,"****The following review is NOT based on the movie itself, but rather the quality and features the disc offers.****
Though the picture was much more clear and crisp, it still lacked ANY special features, which is a big deal to me, hence the 2-star review. The disc menu literally has 2 options- Play Movie and Chapters. This is pathetic for a Blu-Ray movie, let alone a blockbuster hit movie full of awards and fantastic trivia and facts. I would expect this from a DVD but not a $17 Blu-Ray.
Also, they did not format the movie to fit flatscreen TV's. So don't expect this movie to take up your entire screen.
Lastly, a couple of suggestions of how to access your own special features of this film:
1. IMDB has a lot of interesting information and trivia about the movie that will leave you more fulfilled from the Blu-Ray.
2. There was a complete ""Making of"" Sands of Iwo Jima made in 1993 that I'm sure you can look up on YouTube.
Hope this helped. Semper FI!

P.S. Look, i'm not knocking the movie or John Wayne. I absolutely love both. I think it's weird that 3 people took the time to say that my review wasn't helpful. Like I stated at the beginning, it's not a review of the movie. If you want special features, you have to look harder.

The video was clear, excellent black & white contrast.  The special making of feature was with Leonard Malton with interviews with John Waynes son, John Agar and others.

It was interesting seeing what the think was at the time regarding the Marines and the war effort at Iwo Jima.  Forrest Tucker was especially good as Thomas, a foil against Stryker (Wayne), and John Agars character, trying to live up to his fathers fame as a Marine but would rather not.

The death scenes were heart-tugging and authentic.  The Japanese were portrayed as pretty evil and heartless, which is what I would expect from a film made only a few years after World War II.

The sideways romance with Agars character was played up but was not really a vital part of the film.  Waynes performance was flawless.

Critics on Amazon seem hard on Wayne for not being in the military which is quite unfair and they should really get their facts straight.  In the film, Waynes son says his father was a great supporter.  The USMC actually reviewed the film and made suggestions for its production, and even provided Camp Pendelton for the invasion scenes.
Recommended.

PS:  If you were ever a fan of F-Troop, it is interesting to note Forrest Tucker later becoming a TV comedian.  And if you were a fan of the police show Adam 12, a very young Martin Milner makes an appearance.",1417132800,5,1610,4.619718309859155

I personally would have liked more scenes about how the unit cohesion develops.  The love story was insipid, the female character wasn't developed enough and had the sex appeal of a water buffalo.  But, it was a different era in our history, and it seemed to me the way headquarters saw the women at that time.  The tactics and strategy again reflected Headquarters attitude.  As for the interaction within the squad, that was perfectly drawn, because the 'real' corps does not always march in lock step with orders or headquarters.  Out of survival and daily living, sometimes marines adapt to the time and place; respect, love, and hate, rise and fall daily like the tide. Sometimes a good 'kick in the ass' does more than reams of orders.  Leaving out the 'sex', so called, would have made it a superb movie.",1371513600,,915,4.68125

45137,5,0782010040,"""Sands of Iwo Jima"" starring John Wayne is a movie that is a little hard-to-find, but well worth the effort.
  Wayne plays the classic Platoon Sergeant Stryker character ""to the hilt"" as he did with his westerns.  Hard-hitting, no-nonsense leader who cares much about the men under his command.  Training hard as Marines have done for about 170 years (circa point-in-time of WWII) Wayne's character leads his men on many successful missions with a minimum of men lost during the battles preceeding Iwo Jima.  He trained his men well.
  In the climatic ""flag raising"" scene, the men who participated in the movie are the actual men who both fought on Iwo Jima and raised the flag for real, including American Indian, Issac Hayes.
  Keeping in mind that ""Sands of Iwo Jima"" was filmed shortly after WWII, the sound is not what we're used to in the 21st century.  I would suggest for the music soundtrack & battle scenes to ""punch"" the Equalizer & sub-woofer to the max.
  Can't say for certain, but since ""Sands"" isn't that available for general sale (brand new), poke around on Amazon.com as I did.",1352419200,,1097,4.746031746031746
45138,5,0782010040,"This old, black and white film, made in 1949 in a very jingoistic style proper to the war time Hollywood productions, is still (in my modest opinion) the best film on battle of Iwo Jima ever made - and yes, even if I am a huge fan of Clint Eastwood, I still consider this movie as better than his double film ""Flags of our fathers""/ ""Letters from Iwo Jima"". This film also is the only one until now to show the hellish battle of Tarawa in 1943.

John Wayne plays here one of his pretty stereotypic characters - an extremely tough Marine Sergeant, John Stryker, a professional soldier who was already a veteran when war started and who earned quite a reputation on the battlefield at Guadalcanal (this battle is not shown in the film). The film begins, when Stryker's section receives replacements and starts training preparing for another operation - it will be the short but incredibly bloody and intense battle of Tarawa. Stryker is almost unanimously hated by his soldiers, because he makes their life a hell... But later, those who survived the battle of Tarawa, change radically their perception of this tyranic, hard drinking, brutish sergeant, recognizing that he prepared them the best he could for the REAL hell... After a period of recuperation and more training Marines are headed towards their toughest battle ever - Iwo Jima...

Although maybe a little bit aged in the dialogs, this film is surprisingly realistic in the battle scenes. Some real veterans of Tarawa and Iwo Jima played themselves in this film and that includes three surviving Marines out of the six who put the American flag on the top of Mount Suribachi. Just to be clear, John Wayne's character is nowhere near this great scene...

This is also I believe one of the very few old war movies, which show so clearly how hard those times could be on civilians, especially those more vulnerable. One of the best parts of the film is that in which Wayne's character answers to the advances of a girl in a bar. But once he arrives at her little appartment, he realises that she is a single mom and even if she has a daytime job, she still doesn't earn enough to support herself and her baby - and therefore she more or less prostitutes herself when she can not make the ends meet at the end on the month... This is a pretty strong scene for 1949.

Stryker's character, once we get to know him better, becomes quite interesting. His long term conflict with one of his soldiers, a particularly hard-case of bad mouth and mean attitude, is well described. And the ending of the film is pretty strong and rather atypical for John Wayne's movies.

And finally, this is also the first film in which we can hear the expression ""load and lock"". Used by Wayne's character as an order to get ready, this expression since then entered the English language for good.

So bottom line, this is a very fine war film, which aged much less than one could expect and still packs some considerable punch. It is a pity, that although nominated for the Oscar, John Wayne didn't get it for this role (he had to wait 20 years to finally get this reward). Recommended to all John Wayne's fans and all the amateurs of war movies. Enjoy!",1350604800,,3186,4.590509666080844

Marine Corps platoon-leader Sgt. Stryker takes charge of his unit of mostly inexperienced infantrymen. They see action on Tarawa and Iwo Jima, with many weeks/ months of training in between battles.

Sgt. Stryker attempts to guide one wayward junior Marine in particular, ...the son of his former commanding-officer. The new junior man, an idealist and self-proclaimed intellectual, doesn't care much for the Marine Corps, didn't like his father's guidance, ...and likes Sgt. Stryker's guidance even less. The two eventually come to a grudging understanding.

Although somewhat of a melodrama, Sands of Iwo Jima is still a John Wayne classic!
The film is stocked full of actual war-footage, featuring amphibious landings, logistical sites, and battles. Watch for appearances of Japanese soldiers retreating from advancing Marines in the Tarawa scenes!

No, John Wayne didn't serve in World War II. Many other Hollywood actors did.
-He was 34 in 1941, but there were plenty of men during this time, who at the mere age of 30 were denied enlistment due to age and/or health.
-John Wayne had some health issues that probably would have prevented his assignment to a combat-unit anyway, but his deferment was based on family issues. In fact, John Wayne applied to join the O.S.S. to serve under John Ford. John Wayne was interviewed by ""Wild Bill"" Donovan himself, ...who told John Wayne he should reconsider.
-Well, ...John Wayne was ALWAYS a GOOD AMERICAN, and stood for the right things, ...and I bet he would have made a good Marine too, had he pressed the issue!",1315958400,2,1603,5.083650190114068

45144,5,0782010040,"An absolutely great film!  It is set against the backdrop of WWII in the Pacific, with new 'boots' (recruits) being assimilated into a rifle squad led by one of the toughest Marines they'd ever want to meet (John Wayne plays Sgt John M. Stryker). He has his failings (an estranged wife and an alcohol problem), but is deadly serious when it comes to getting them ready for combat. John Agar plays one of Sgt Stryker's recruits, and is a highly intelligent young man who reluctantly joins the the Corps not out of a sense of duty, but because of family ties to the Corps. He is belligerent to Stryker's entreaties to get him to come around to the training and importance of what is at stake, but Stryker will get his squad 'squared away', no matter how much all his recruits hate him. Its 'his way or sickbay'. Sent to fight in the battle of Tarawa, all his charges soon learn how deadly serious combat is. Of note in the Tarawa sequence are the cameos by Gen. David Shoup and Major 'Jim' Crowe, veterans of and leaders at the battle for Tarawa.  In a scene were Stryker's given the command to stay put so as not to give away the thinness of their understrength line to the enemy, he shows how far he will go to carry out orders, no matter how terrible the circumstances, or the personal pain or cost. In the Iwo Jima sequence (complete with cameos by three surviving flag raisers on Surabachi), he leads from the front, and though not as graphic as some would want in this era of 'Saving Private Ryan' realism, the human cost and sacrifice is always portrayed. The negative reviewers must put into perspective the time this film was released (1949). For a movie of its day, it was full of about as much realism as was allowed. As a Marine of 24 years of active service, it does say something when, to this day, Marines want to have all the positive virtues of a Sgt Stryker. It is an enduring legacy left to us by the toughest Marines of the past and embodied in this truly iconic film.",1269820800,5,1986,4.394021739130435

45156,4,0782010040,"I liked this film even though I found it a bit contrived. John Wayne is of course effective in the lead, but as one of the few elligible Movie Stars who did not enter the service in World War II his performance is more Hollywood than Parris Island. Ironically their was a true story that could have served as the basis of a more authentic film. The story of Marine Gunnery Sgt. John Basilone. Basilone won the Congressional Medal of Honor at Guadalcanal but he turned down a commission and insisted on returning to combat ""to be with his men"". He was killed at Iwo Jima and was awarded the Navy Cross. I believe he was the only serviceman ever to receive both decorations. Basilone was the son of Italian American immigrants and was from a large working class family. He may have been too ""ethnic"" to be the subject of a major Hollywood production. Ethnic soldiers were usually in supporting roles in A budget World War II films of that era. The leads were usually ""All American Boys"". Perhaps it was better box office.
  Nevertheless, I enjoyed this film. The Wayne character was shown to have his flaws. The direction was not brilliant nor was the script, but it told the story in an efficient manner which kept things moving to the inevitable conclusion - the raising of the flag on Mt Suribachi, one of the mythic moments of American military history. In my opinion, not as good as ""Flags of Our Fathers"", but less emotionally draining. A good example of the ""Hollywood goes to war"" genre.",1251417600,,1493,4.567164179104478

45160,4,0782010040,"''The Sands of Iwo Jima'' covers far more than the Marine invasion of Iwo Jima in World War II.  The film follows the seemingly real Sergeant John Stryker (John Wayne) and the men he was commanded over a period of a year or so in the South Pacific. While the film's script is only loosely based on actual events, it's not hard to believe the men in the film and events that they experienced could very well have happened in real-life.

The film opens with the U.S. Marines regrouping in New Zealand after the fight for Guadalcanal had ended. Sergeant Stryker is assigned to command a platoon of Marines who are anxious to see some action. Stryker's hard-bitten, by-the-book command style (''Saddle-up! Saddle-up!'') soon rankles many of the men, especially Private Thomas (Forrest Tucker) who had fought alongside him before, and Private Conway (John Agar), whose recently killed-in-action father was a carbon-copy of the hard-nosed Stryker.

Stryker's attempt to whip the men into a fighting force has mixed results. Some are incompetent, while Conway and Thomas try to buck his authority. Stryker tries to win-over Conway by expressing his admiration for Conway's father. But Conway, who is somewhat arrogant, despised his father and now takes his hatred out to Stryker. On top of that, Stryker is battling his own personal demons which he tries to drown in alcohol when off duty.

Over the course of the film the Marines see action in Tarawa and later Iwo Jima. The film effectively captures the camaraderie amongst the men and also their fears, bravery, and successes. Although the film is not gory, it does show the death and destruction of warfare. The film also shows how some men made terrible mistakes that cost the lives of others and how Stryker tried to show leadership under extremely stressful conditions even as some of his men battled him every step of the way.

''The Sands of Iwo Jima'' is a must-have-film for any World War II buff. Director Allan Dwan did an excellent job of capturing the toughness of the Marines along with their softer moments and devotion to each other. There are some corny scenes in the film and it's not as realistic as war films made since the 1990s, but I rate the movie as a strong 4 stars and recommend it to anyone interested in learning about World War II, the U.S. Marines, or John Wayne in one of his finest roles ever.",1223164800,,2371,4.759124087591241

45162,5,0782010040,"This film had the three surviving flag raisers: Pfc. Rene A. Gagnon, Pfc. Ira H. Hayes, PM3C John H. Bradley. This film was dedicated to the USMC, who aided in its production. The screenplay was written by Harry Brown, the author of ""A Walk in the Sun"", and has some of the actors from that earlier film. It begins after the Battle of Guadalcanal. The men are sent to New Zealand to rest, retrain, and get more replacements. Sgt. John M. Stryker is the squad leader. He will learn the men what isn't in the books; their lives will depend on this. Sgt. Stryker leads the men in their drills and exercises. One soldier, Conway, joined for the family tradition. Stryker drives his men hard, they need training. He also has a family problem. The men have liberty in Wellington.

Stryker advises Conway against a long-term commitment. Stryker uses a novel training technique for bayonet drill [comic relief?]. Then the men get sent to their target: Tarawa. Stryker warns them of a difficult combat, no matter what the Navy guns and fliers have done. Actual scenes from combat are used. There are realistic combat scenes. Lives are spent to destroy enemy machine gun nests and take their objective. A few men are pinned down and short of ammunition. One returns for bandoliers, but tarries for a cup of coffee. The delay costs lives. ""What kept you?"" The marines must hold their position in spite of reduced strength. Tarawa was secured after four days of battle. The survivors leave the island for retraining in Hawaii. When mistakes are made, men die needlessly.

Sgt. Stryker learns about civilian life in Honolulu. Civilians also have a hard life. The unit has been trained and tested in battle. They are shipped out to another Pacific island with three airfields. ""War is trading lives for real estate."" When the naval bombardment ends, the men move out to attack. They can advance only so far. A tank arrives to spread napalm. Rocket launchers are used as well. In the morning they advance on Mount Suribachi. They will raise a flag when they reach the top. Sgt. Stryker will not make it to the top. ""Things just turned out that way."" The famous flag raising is recreated, a symbol of the coming victory.

This film recreates history and provides lessons that are educational. I think the screenplay of Harry Brown and his advisors made this the best WW II film if not the most successful.",1210550400,2,2389,4.7105263157894735

Many modern war movies are sanitized of the realities of war. Not this one! There are numerous scenes of soldiers suffering and dying. There is a scene where a Jewish soldier says his last prayers in Hebrew. There is no happy ending for Sergeant Stryker himself.

The viewer sees the progression of the US island-hopping campaign. The islands of Tarawa and Iwo Jima are seized from the Japanese. In each case, there first is the ""softening"" of Japanese positions by massive bombing by airplanes and shelling from battleships.  Then comes the invasion by amphibious craft. The US soldiers are under constant fire. They must crawl from one hiding place to another in their advance against Japanese positions. The Japanese have a habit of jumping out of their hiding places in caves and attacking unsuspecting Americans from behind. The entrenched Japanese have to be driven out by bazookas and flame throwers. Some of the latter are hand-held, whereas others are tank-mounted.

The conflict focuses on Stryker and Private First Class Conway (John Agar) who in the end will assume Stryker's position...

At the Battle of Tarawa, one of the bloodiest fights of the whole Pacific campaign, director Allan Dwan establishes his ground rules for describing combat, mixing authentic combat footage with shots of his actors... The few casualties in Stryker's company justifies his methods, and the men begin to respect him...

Allan Dwan's 'Sands of Iwo Jima', anticipated the new vogue for action-packed war movies... His film is quite hypnotic in its flag-waving way...",1168560000,2,1472,4.923387096774194

45188,5,0782010040,"I always find it irritating to read analyses of military movies by obvious civilians who know nothing about the military, combat and specifically about the Marine Corps.

This is one of the best movies John Wayne made and was the one, at least, for which he should have won an Oscar.

The Stryker character, played by Wayne, was not a ""martinet"". He plays a Marine sergeant, a combat veteran, the way a Marine sergeant is supposed to be. Tough, but fair. He pushes his people, boots (recruits), because he wants to help them survive when they hit the beach. If they don't survive they are no good to him and no good to the mission. Wayne does an excellent job of portraying that.

The surviving flag raisers who were in the movie were Marines Gagnon and Hayes, and Navy Corpsman Bradley (whose son wrote Flags of Our Fathers), not, as one previewer noted, ""three Marines"". Navy Corpsmen are proud to be Navy Corpsmen and are respected as such by the Marines with whom they serve.

Also, the characters were not ""soldiers"" and it is really irritating when that term is used to describe Marines. The men this story is about were Marines and the actors play Marines, a title that is EARNED.

In short, even though actual combat footage is spliced into the movie's action, given the time it was made, it is well done. There are some romantic lulls, but given the period the movie was made, 40s and 50s, this was fairly typical. Overali, this is a great movie, even if you are a civilian. It will give fans of the Duke something memorable to watch. It may also give critics of John Wayne a new view of the man as a solid actor.",1161043200,12,1622,4.466216216216216

45192,3,0782010040,"In 1945 Associated Press photographer Joe Rosenthal took what is probably the most famous American photograph of World War II, Raising the Flag on Iwo Jima.  Rosenthal won the Pulitzer Prize in 1945 for the photograph, five Marines and one Naval Corpsman planting a large American flag on the hard summit of Mount Suribachi.  The photograph has inspired memorials, books and movies.

  Movies like 1949's SANDS OF IWO JIMA, whose reason for being is to faithfully recreate the flag-raising incident and, coincidentally, nudge John Wayne down the path that took him from movie star to American icon.

  Wayne plays Marine Sergeant John Stryker, a tough-as-nails type who has to whip his squad into shape during a rest, refit and replacement stint between battle action in the Pacific theater.  Among his charges are John Agar, Forrest Tucker, Wally Cassell, and Richard Jaeckel.  Agar plays resentful, Tucker irresponsible, Cassell and Jaeckel provide comic relief that isn't.

  Wayne, as usual, plays the tough guy role with great verve, and has the acting chops to handle the introspective moments with delicacy.  The real scenes of beach battle are well integrated in the studio stuff to good, if not great, effect.  It's interesting to see real flame throwing tanks attack real pillboxes, but for the most part it's a chaotic melange of exploding sand and expiring actors.  As usual, the ebb and flow of real battle is ignored.

  What isn't ignored, unfortunately, is the story of rancorous PFC Pete Conway, the Agar character, who plays Wayne's main antagonist.  Conway woos a USO women, played by Allison Bromley, and the movie sags considerably in the handful of courtship scenes Agar is involved in.  The making of feature (hosted by Leonard Maltin) tells us that Wayne wanted Agar in the movie, which goes to show you that great actors don't necessarily make great casting directors.

  I'm usually a reliable sucker for tear inducing final scenes, but I didn't lump up at the end of SANDS OF IWO JIMA where and when I was supposed to.  SANDS OF IWO JIMA is an important film in the career of John Wayne, and on that basis I tepidly recommend this movie.",1112400000,18,2164,4.92797783933518
45193,5,0782010040,"John Wayne stars as Sgt. Striker.  Striker is a marine who

is given a group of misfits to turn into men.  Striker is

also dealing with problems at home.  His wife hates the military

and has left him taking their son away.  Wayne is obviously

concerned about what will happen to his son in the clutches of

someone who may teach him none of the values of being an

American.

Making it worse, one of Wayne's men is the son of a famous

soldier but has been so brainwashed that he hates America,

everything it stands for and the military.  Its obvious that

this guy represents what Wayne fears his son will be turned

into by his wife: an anti-american/anti-military peacenik

liberal weakling.

Wayne is the pure image of the american fighting leader.  He is

a machine that crushes everyone in his path.  He knocks one

old troublemaker soldier around as an example and that brings

the men into line.  By the time they get to Iwo, Striker has

built them into a fighting unit.  No personalities, no thoughts

except for battle, no fear.  They have been perfectly prepared

for the battle.  And having accomplished his task, Striker is

killed during the battle.

His death teaches us as Americans a final and most important

lesson.  None of the men are important in their lives or what

they do.  Leaders are not important either.  Whats important is

that the corps as a big machine keeps going.  Striker builds

the new leaders in battle and then the torch is passed to them

to go on and do the same thing.

War builds character and burns away the phony idealogy of

45206,5,0782010040,"Admiral Nimitz was commenting on the marines' successful efforts to secure this very strategic island during the 36 day battle, starting on February 19, against this Japanese stronghold.  Of the six marines who raised the flag on Mount Suribachi, only three survived, all of which led quiet lives afterwards, never boasting about their achievements; many of their comrades died there.  This movie was made right after the war just when the U.S. government was considering nixing the marines.  John Wayne was one of many who came to the rescue, and in the movie, he does so as the brave Sargeant Stryker.  The marines were instrumental in taking the island, as the VHS version documents after the end of the actual film.  This movie was one of my dad's favorite WWII films; my dad was only 16 at the time the war ended, yet had a friend who survived this battle, yet with the loss of one of his legs.  Almost 7000 Americans died, many tens of thousands were wounded.  The Japanese population on this small island was very nearly annihilated.  John Wayne's first Academy Award nomination for Best Actor came from his role in this film.

Though many of the actors in this film were well known in their day, the only one I had heard of was John Wayne, although I'm sure my dad would've known them all.  The movie is very dated, over 50 years old.  I didn't get really interested in the story until half way through in that it mainly depicts barracks life for the marines until their deployment.  The actual battle takes up only a fraction of the movie's time, the majority of it more concerned with the personalities and conflicts within the corp pre-engagement.  I had hoped the movie would contain more historical details than it did since I knew precious little about it; however, probably in 1949, most Americans knew all about it from the news, newspapers and from friends and relatives who knew of people who had fought there.  (The quote from Nimitz was not in the movie, nor the historical facts).  Still, the movie's a classic, and I can see why my dad loved it.  We're not a marine family, but Semper Fi!",1098489600,2,2110,4.631720430107527
45207,5,0782010040,"""Sands of Iwo Jima"" was the first movie I ever saw in which John Wayne played a character who actually died, which was certainly one of the more shocking deaths I can remember ever seeing in a film.  Wayne plays Sgt. John Marion Stryker and since Wayne's real name was Marion Michael Morrison there seems to be an additional level of identification between actor and character here, while the power of the name ""Stryker"" is obvious.  Stryker seems a bully to the green recruits he is training to be U.S. Marines in 1943.  When the men of the rifle squad learn that Stryker's wife had taken their son and left him they think they know the reason why the man who was once the epitome of the tough Marine has become such a martinet.

Of course when Stryker and his men hit the beach at Tarawa and are fighting for their lives against the Japanese troops defending the island, they understand that his hard lessons are the difference being life and death in combat.  Then comes the last hard nut to crack of the islands occupied by the Japanese, the volcanic island of Iwo Jima.  As the officer briefing the troops says, ""nobody knows exactly what they've got on this island, but they've had forty years to put it there.""  Director Allan Dwan takes advantage of actual combat footage from the documentaries ""With the Marines at Tarawa"" and ""To the Shores of Iwo Jima"" to provide an added dimension of realism to the battle sequences.  The reenactment of the flag raising on Iwo Jima involved Rene Gagnon, Ira Hayes, and John Bradley, the only three Marines in the celebrated photograph who survived the battle.

Since this is a Hollywood war movie Stryker's rifle squad consists of not just new recruits but a few veterans, including Al Thomas (Forrest Tucker), an old enemy who is perfectly willing to bad mouth the sergeant at every opportunity, even after he is taken out behind the tents by Stryker to be reminded who is running the outfit.  The recruit who absorbs all of this venom the most is young Peter Conway (John Agar), whose father was Stryker's Commanding Officer at Guadalcanal.  The old man felt his son was too soft to be a Marine (he reads books and went to college) and the kid resents the particular interest Stryker is taking in his training.  Even when Stryker saves Conway's life when the kid is too busy reading a love letter to notice a live grenade gets loose during a training exercise, Conway refuses to show gratitude.  So in addition to their relationship and sergeant and private Stryker and Conway are playing out their own familial relationship problems with each other as well.

It is in battle that Stryker is at his best, blowing up a Japanese bunker to save trapped Marines, and once he proves himself to be a warrior god his squad, now tested in battle, finally becomes a true band of brothers.  But ""The Sands of Iwo Jima"" has the elements of a Greek tragedy and at the moment of his apotheosis the hero must fall.  Adding insult to injury the blow comes from behind and the shot of a bullet hole beneath Stryker's stenciled name on the back of his fatigues is even more powerful than the reenactment of the raising of the second American flag on Mt. Surabachi.

This is not the best war movie of 1949; that honor goes to William Wellman's ""Battleground,"" which remains one of the very best of the best in the World War II genre.  Wayne was nominated for Best Actor, the only other time he was up for an Oscar besides ""True Grit,"" although he arguably gave a better performance that same year in his previous film ""She Wore a Yellow Ribbon.""  Despite the pair of strong performances by the Duke the Academy Award went to Broderick Crawford for ""All the King's Men,"" but ""Sands of Iwo Jima"" remains Wayne's best WWII movie and one of the few that stands up with his classic westerns.""",1097366400,33,3818,4.580029368575624
45208,5,0782010040,"I am neither a fan nor a detractor of John Wayne, but it's true many of his movies I have trouble finishing -- they just don't capture my interest very well. This movie is an exception. I find myself watching this one repeatedly.

I understand the Marine Corps had some misgivings about their story being told by a B-movie studio (Republic), but I think this film brings that studio great credit. Wayne was nominated for Best Actor for this film, and in restrospect, I think he should have won (Jose Ferrer won that year).

This movie has quite satisfactory subplots, more than passable acting, some nice crisp, intelligent dialog in places, and some characterizations that can evoke the interest and sympathy of the audience. The scene where Stryker (Wayne) visits the apartment of a woman he meets in a bar is particularly edifying. This is a surprisingly good movie, and it's wearing well over the years.

I hate to nitpick, but there is an error or two on these pages concerning the historical accuracy of this film -- which also is surprisingly good; it's clear the film's makers were as careful as they could be. The landing craft at Tarawa in the film are LVTs (Landing Vehicle, Tracked), and this is correct for the first wave. The planners of the assault knew these would be important to surmount the reef, but their numbers were limited, so ensuing waves used LCVPs which could not cross the reef, and these are the troops who were slaughtered while wading in. Also, the movie correctly portrays the Marines in training for this assault as being stationed in New Zealand.

Furthermore, the actual ascent of Suribachi was indeed relatively easy after five or so tortuous days of preparation -- but most of the carnage lay ahead; the battle was just getting warmed up. About 15% of USMC combat fatalities from 1776 through the Gulf War (1991) occured on Iwo Jima.

This movie succeeds very nicely to tell an important war story without unnecessary violence, and some touching love relationships without lewdness. As an ex-Marine, and pretty serious student of the Pacific War, I like this movie.",1091836800,6,2103,4.814404432132964
45209,4,0782010040,"Although my first thought would not classify this as a recruiting film, the movie does just that.  Within the story we see a few people who are trying to earn respect from loved ones, the fellow soldiers, or themselves.  This fits most of the themes for WWII movies starring John Wayne.  If the formula works, don't mess with it.
A hard-core Marine, played by John Wayne, has seen a lot of action, but he has also lost quite a bit of rank due to a problem with getting a bit too drunk on his off duty time.  This drinking comes from his trying to deaden the pain from the estrangement from his young son.
One of his squad is having trouble dealing with his world also.  His father was a famous commander who wanted to see his son be a brave soldier.  His trouble with his family leads to friction between him and Wayne.
One soldier gets his buddies killed or injured due to his taking a break from the battle.  From this, he must try to regain his respect for himself.
All these men fight their inner battles as they fight the outer ones.  This movie is a tribute to duty and honor.  I would recommend watching this movie.",1076630400,8,1122,4.304761904761905
45210,4,0782010040,"John Wayne stars as Sargeant John M. Stryker in this very well-done movie about what is perhaps the most famous battle of the Pacific campaign--Iwo Jima.  The special effects are good for the time (1950), and the scenery adds greatly to the overall effect of the film.  Wayne does an excellent job as Stryker, the tough-as-nails marine who is hard on his men but soft at heart.
The most compelling thing about this film is Wayne's character.  He is no great war-hero--in fact, he does very little on the battlefield of any great consequence.  Instead, he does his duty, unglamorous though it may be.  He is human, and this is what sets him apart from many war-movie heroes today.  The movie lacks any intense combat or epic battles, but its strength lies in the character of Stryker and in his relationship with his men.
The reason I don't give this five stars is because it's scope pales in comparison with many other war movies.  Part of this is due to technology, but much is also due to more action-intense films which (I think) help us understand better the battles and conflicts which the movies portray.  Such movies as Gettysburg, We Were Soldiers, and even old films like All Quiet on the Western Front do a much better job than this film of showing the various positions of the battle, and of the obstacles the soldiers faced.  The marines in this film have a relatively easy time getting to the top of Iwo Jima, but I would have liked to have had a little more information about the battle.  Were it not for this, I would give the movie five stars without hesitation.",1051228800,3,1578,4.5638297872340425
45211,5,0782010040,"Iwo Jima was one of the most bloody battles of the Pacific war.  Thousands of Japanese and American soldiers lost their lives fighting over this island which was barely five miles long and two miles wide.  Republic Pictures produced this timeless movie about that battle.  John Wayne gives a stirring performance as Sergeant John Stryker, a tough-as-nails yet compassionate marine who is trying to mold his squad of raw recruits into a fighting machine.  John Agar stars as PFC Peter Conway, a college-educated marine who truly dislikes Stryker and his tactics.  However, over the course of the film, Conway develops a genuine respect and friendship for Stryker.  Forrest Tucker does a marvelous job as PFC Al Thomas, one of the few combat veterans in the squad.
The movie begins with the marines training in Hawaii.  After completing their training, the squad is sent as part of the invasion force of the island of Tarawa.  I found some mistakes made by the producers dealing with this part of the movie.  In the film, the landing craft are seen driving directly up to the beach and discharging their men.  This is inaccurate.  In reality, the marines who actually invaded Tarawa were forced to deploy from their landing craft as far as one half mile from the beach due to a low tide which didn't allow the amphibious craft to get close to the beach.
After the Tarawa invasion, the squad goes back for more training and replacements.  Finally, it was on to Iwo Jima.  The actual battle scenes on Iwo Jima only last about 15 to 20 minutes, but the fighting was very realistic, especially the flag raising on Mt. Surabachi.  The three surviving flag raisers, Rene Gagnon, Ira Hayes, and John Bradley, actually took part in the flag raising in the movie.
I enjoyed this movie very much.  The colorized version was especially good, although some of the colors looked strange.  John Wayne, John Agar, Forrest Tucker, and the entire cast helped bring the war in the Pacific and especially Iwo Jima to life.  This rates as one of John Wayne's best performances. For more information about Iwo Jima, I recommend the books ""Iwo Jima"" by Bill Ross and ""Flags of our Fathers"" by James Bradley.",1051142400,7,2183,4.778666666666667

The Sands of Iwo Jima combines all of the elements for a great movie, and does it well.

45214,4,0782010040,"The battle of Iwo Jima was actually the most successful defensive action the Japanese fought in the Pacific. Their strategy had been to set up a defensive perimeter and to then inflict heavy casualties on the attacking American and Imperial forces. This way they hoped to offset the material and technical superiority of the allies by the fanatical courage of their troops. The problems faced by the Japanese was that often local commanders would lose patience and order their men to attack. These attacks were easily repelled by the superior allied fire power.
Iwo Jima was a battle in which the Japanese dug in away from the beaches and stubbornly fought  a defensive battle making the Americans pay for every inch of territory that they moved over. At the end of the battle the Japanese had caused the greatest number of casualties for their own losses in any of the later Pacific Battles.
It is thus no surprise that a film was made about this action. In addition the battle gave rise to one of the more effective symbols of any action in the Pacific. The raising on top of the Mount Suribachi of an American flag by seven members of the US armed forces.
The film itself is very much a film that has been made close to the Pacific war. The portrayal of the Japanese is not good and the aim of the film is to celebrate the courage of the US marines who took the island. (And of course courage they had in abundance)
The way the film is designed is to initially concentrate on the training of the recruits with the suggestion of its importance in steeling them for battle. It has always surprised me how much Americans have been addicted to methods of troop training which were designed to coordinate the movement of musketeers in the time of Frederick the Great. The characters are pretty much stereotypes rather than real people but to concentrate on that would be churlish.
Never the less the film is a classic of its type. Perhaps not so much propaganda but a celebration of the actions of brave men who gave to their country what was asked of them.",1014854400,4,2055,4.569105691056911
