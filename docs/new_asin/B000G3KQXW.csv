8128864,5,B000G3KQXW,"The book ""The Creature from Jekyll Island"" is a bit of a thick tome, but still worth the time and effort to read it.
This video, takes less time, and is very informative, although it lacks some of the details found in the book.
I am quite pleased with this video.  I recommend BOTH the video and the book.",1494547200,,305,4.169491525423729

goes bad and/or the Fed screws up. The Fed represents the large banks not the gov't or the taxpayer. Personally I don't

I rate this recording excellent.",1326240000,6,308,4.049180327868853
