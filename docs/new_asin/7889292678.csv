7900641,3,7889292678,"This is a great movie, which I saw long ago as a student in the Army Japanese Language School and have remembered ever since. I met the main actor Hanayagi Shotaro in Tokyo. Now I would like to buy a DVD of it, but there is none with English subtitles! I've twice bought the one you advertise, only to find that it has only Chinese subtitles  (produced in Korea.) Please find a way to make an English-subtitled DVD of this great film available so that I can watch it again! (I am 86 years old.)
