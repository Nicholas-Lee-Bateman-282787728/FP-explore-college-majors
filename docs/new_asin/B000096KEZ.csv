1879979,5,B000096KEZ,"I was enthralled when the original series of Tenko came on PBS, I never missed an episode and had some on tape. I want them to make this series for playing on DVD's compatible with those in the U.S. and also at a price that is not outrageous, such as the prices that can be obtained for the Monty Python entire series and for the World at War. I would truly love to see this series again, why are they making it so difficult?",1185062400,50,425,4.071428571428571
1879980,5,B000096KEZ,"Region 2 is nice, if you live in Region 2.  When will they come out with this in Region 1 format.  This was a fantastic series when it aired on PBS and the only T.V. show I watched faithfully.
A follow-up:  One of the posts said to try Santa Flix to find Tenko, all three seasons and the Reunion special on DVD and in Region 1 format.  I did just that and ordered them today, at $25.95 each (a special price if you ordered all three).  I'll have to wait to receive them to see if they are what they're supposed to be, but it doesn't look like we'll ever see them through Amazon.",1180569600,34,578,4.035087719298246
1879981,5,B000096KEZ,"This series set a standard for its genre and I've yet to see anything comparable.

Attention to detail was one of the hallmarks of this series; after all these years I still remember how each actresses' physical appearance was carefully altered to reflect dietary and other physical deprivation; I wonder how many of today's actresses would allow themselves to be seen week after week in such realistic fashion.

It also was shown on the BBC where it gained almost cult status and BBC TV offers a box set of the entire series in DVD PAL format.  On my list to buy since one can download an all region DVD viwer and watch on computer.",1137369600,8,633,4.535087719298246
1879982,5,B000096KEZ,This was one of the very best shows that I have ever seen on TV. Educational and asorbing. A DVD is a great improvement..no commercials and no waiting to see more a week later. I could hadly wait for the next episode when it played in America for the first time on the Arts cable channel. That was a pay channel that was combined with the Entertainment channel and is now A & E.,1135296000,4,378,4.121621621621622
1879991,5,B000096KEZ,"You have got to give it to the British. They know how to do great quality drama that is understated but powerful at the same time. The story of moral fortitude in the face of adversity enthralled me from the beginning. It's particularly surprising as this is a 'chick drama', with strong female leads and focusing mostly on the emotional toll of internment of European civilian women by the Japanese during WW2. If you are a guy, don't let this put you off. You may enjoy it as much as I do, and come away with a new-found respect for what those women went through during the war. On a side note, this show was particularly relevant to myself as I stay in Singapore, and was already familiar with the stories of mistreatment of both European and native population by the Japanese. Not given as much attention here was what the local populations had to endure, and how some suffered torture and death because they tried to help the Europeans. Scenes of old Singapore, now long gone, are also very welcome.",1401235200,,1004,4.552486187845304
1879992,5,B000096KEZ,"Really wish this would come out on DVD for Region1l (United States).  I watched this 30 years ago when I was waiting the birth of my son.  I couldn't wait for each episode to come out.  I have been repeatedly looking for this DVD set and then when I find it I can't get it because it is not formatted for Region 1.  Please, there are a lot of viewers in US whom would love this series!!!!",1391385600,,388,4.0
1879993,5,B000096KEZ,I enjoyed this series when it first aired on PBS and always wanted to see it again.  Thank goodness for the new DVD players that play ALL videos not just US ones.  Great cast and acting - very compelling drama!,1381881600,5,210,4.225
1879994,5,B000096KEZ,I wish it was available on region 1 but I will take it on region 2. I gave it as a gift and it was a huge hit.,1372377600,,110,2.9642857142857144
1879995,5,B000096KEZ,"My wife and I first saw Tenko on the BBC when we stayed in England for a few months with my Mum. We liked it very much, my wife especially. It's the kind of show that both sexes would like; women because of the obvious ""women in a prisoner of war camp"" setting, and men because it's about the war (duh!). The series stays at the level of a drama pretty much all the way through, resisting falling into a soap opera through the fine writing and acting. The actors who play the part of the Japanese officers and soldiers are brilliant throughout too. There is some excellent character acting in this show.

This is a good series because it shows accurately how the Japanese behaved during WWII. Probably shows them in a slightly more favourable light than how they acted in some of the male camps, from what I've read from first hand accounts of WWII prisoners of war. The initial idea for the series came from the actual experiences of a female WWII prisoner.

One important factor to bear in mind - you will need a multi-format dvd player. A US format player won't work for these disks.  Fortunately, the multi-format dvd player cost substantially less than the Tenko series, just $55 from Amazon.",1370044800,4,1197,4.532407407407407
1879996,5,B000096KEZ,This is a great series which I happened to catch many yrs ago. Really wish they would make a Region 1 version and make a more cost effective so even though I am on a fixed income I could purchase.,1367884800,,196,3.925
1879997,5,B000096KEZ,"I've been so frustrated over this not being available here and having to watch my old VHS copies taped off the air.  This version listed here is for players in England (UK), so that does me no good.  I finally found the complete series, all three season and the reunion movie, at Santa Flix (santaflix dot com).  And its like finding an old friend to see them better than even the first tv broadcasts.  We love this series--I feel live I've lived a dozen lifetimes by the time its over.  Up there with All The Rivers Run and A Town Like Alice for me.",1366848000,32,550,4.25
1879998,5,B000096KEZ,"I have watched PBS MASTERPIECE THEATRE FOR DECADES.  THIS IS ONE OF THE FINEST and longest series.  IT HAS MANY ""CHAPTERS.""  You get to know the characters so well you feel as if they are old friends.  When you see them in other productions or movies---you feel like you are seeing an old friend again.  The series is a tribute to the power of the human spirit.

Another of my favorites from PBS is the DUCHESS OF DUKE STREET.  Recommend watching that also.

Please do NOT watch Tenko to reinforce prejudice against various races.  This is based on similar happenings to women like these in World War II.  I hope you will view TENKO with understanding of the kinds of people involved and what they learned in their various ways of life prior to WWII.

1879999,5,B000096KEZ,"I am utterly amazed at the number of reviews whining about this series not being available in region 1 format.. Do you not see the irony?! This series is based on real life experiences of women from differing backgrounds surviving in POW camps, all the stories are real, but they've been put together to make up the series. So this, therefore is a dramatisation of real life events. And people have the out and out audacity to complain about this not being available as region 1- yes, you're absolutely right, it's outrageous! Reality check please...",1347494400,,550,4.8

1880001,5,B000096KEZ,"I love Tenco, and kept catching the odd episode on the ukhistory channel. I decided to get the story right from the beginning, and this excellent set is perfect for that. The acting is great, and although a lot of people find the story cold at times - you have to remember that this is a very realistic depiction of what those poor women went through during that traumatic time.

I'm halfway through this set, and I certainly intend to purchase the following seasons once this series is complete.",1307404800,3,496,4.573033707865169

1880005,5,B000096KEZ,We have been waiting over two decades for Tenko to come out in a Region 1 format.  I guess they are just not interested in profit or sharing what we think is the most enthrauling series ever made.,1271376000,10,196,4.157894736842105
1880006,4,B000096KEZ,"This is such an excellent series. I don't understand why they don't release it for Region 1 - echoing most of the reviews here. In the same general subject, you can get ""Paradise Road"" and ""Three Came Home"" which are very good but ""Tenko"" is by far the best.",1262649600,8,258,4.285714285714286
1880007,5,B000096KEZ,"To be quite honest, I was a toddler when this broadcast in the early- to mid-'80s, and I remember very little about it.  However, I know that my mother was hooked on it, and I have been searching for YEARS to find the Region 1 DVDs for her as a surprise birthday, Mother's Day or Christmas present ... with no luck.

Has anybody else heard anything about them releasing this for Region 1?  It looks like there are quite a few people interested in seeing this happen, so I looked up the contact information for Acorn, the company that released the DVD collection.  If you want to see this on Region 1, I suggest contacting them, as I am about to do. [...]

Good luck!  I hope I can get this for my mom in the near future!",1254873600,6,720,4.181159420289855
1880008,5,B000096KEZ,"In the 1980s, The History Channel used to play and repeat this series once or twice a year for several years. My father was a POW of the Japanese for 3-1/2 years, and he rated it as fairly realistic, although didn't claim to be an ""expert"" because his capture was in Bataan, and Tenko is set in a different region of SEA.

I've long wanted to get the set, but up until recently it was available only for Region 2. However,multi-region DVD players are now available, so now I can get this most prized British WWII POW series.",1253318400,6,524,4.346938775510204

1880010,5,B000096KEZ,This is the only review I've ever submitted to Amazon.  I too have waited in vain to be able to buy this in Region 1 format.  I still have my original VHS tapes from the 80's - and they are fading and will not last forever.  I have even looked into buying a multi-region DVD player in desperation.

1880013,5,B000096KEZ,"This morning my husband and I were talking about worthwhile TV and I mentioned my favorite PBS series Tenko and the fact that I have looked for it for over 20 years. As he went into the shower, I decided to go online and  take a look as it has been a while since I went on  a search for it. I was thrilled to find it and very excited at the prospect of ordering it even at the exorbinate price. I then became disappointed upon learning it is only available in region 2 format. We even fought the cords and wires pulling out our player to make sure we were, unfortunatly only a region 1 format. What a way to ruin a nice Sunday. Please, please, please come out with this in region 1 format and make my day. Just email me it's availability.",1235865600,12,738,4.082758620689655

Very sad that I have yet to see this series available for REGION 1 for we Americans to purchase and revisit from time to time..

1880019,5,B000096KEZ,"I am over 50 and no great fan of TV.  But I watched every single episode of this astonishing series with my ex in the 1980s.  We both agree - this is probably the finest television series ever created.  For its realism, its emotionality, its even-handedness of a difficult, sensitive and human button-pushing political period (immediate post-WWII)-- not enough praise can be found. All the more remarkable in that the entire cast of primary ""heroes and villains"" is --female! (except for the Japanese commandant). On the issues of gender, roles (and their reversals), cultures in conflict, hypocrisy, colonialism, and -- ultimately -- humanity, there is nothing that can touch this series.
I have been searching for it on tape, and then on DVD for two decades with no luck.  Now at least it is available -- if only in zone 2.  That makes (cynical) sense -- one of the greatest performances in the history of TV should be made as difficult to come by as possible, right?  The fewer the number who understand quality, the better.  Otherwise people might demand more of it.",1205452800,18,1070,4.814207650273224
1880020,5,B000096KEZ,"When Tenko first aired in the UK between 1981 to 1985, it held a nation enthralled. Never before had the experience of the former colonial Singapore dwellers from England, Australia and Holland in WW2 been depicted with such gritty, unabashed and uncensored reality.
The three series take the viewer from the heady, luxirious days of somewhat aloof and arrogant colonial, late 1930's days of the small eastern enclave, through the very real horrors of the POW experience of civilian women in the War years, at the hands of their Japanese conquerers and the much altered aftermath and adjustment of a changed and uncertain world contemplating peace and normality from 1945 up to a one off reunion special set in 1950. This series, believe it or not, was pivotal as a BBC drama for it's subject matter and almost entirely female cast. Tenko is gripping, real and enormously emotional. Stand out performances include Stephanie Cole as the fearsome and principled Dr Beatrice Mason, Patricia Lawrence as the kindly Dutch Nun, Sister Ulrica, Stephanie Beacham as the spoiled and fiesty Rose Millar and Anne Bell as the bored but humane army wife, Marion Jefferson.
You will not fail to be moved, educated and enthralled by a drama now some 25 years of age and still an outstanding body of work. The blistering heat and deprivation of the POW camps give no hint of the Dorset used quarry, in England, in which the main body of the series was actually filmed. Excellent TV!",1193702400,33,1466,4.868
1880021,5,B000096KEZ,"This was an excellent series; I watched it faithfully and have a couple of the episodes on tape.

7989855,5,B000096KEZ,"This was an incredible, intense production. The show centered on the lives of European women and their families before, during, and after their interment in a Japanese prison camp. You get to follow the characters from their comfortable lives before WW II began, and watch them adapt to the shock and horror of becoming prisoners. Many of the characters that you come to care about do not survive. The characters that do survive all undergo metamorphoses. This was an extremely satisfying series, and I was fortunate enought to purchase the entire collection that played on American DVD players from a British seller who sells on Ebay.",1419811200,3,635,5.0
7989856,5,B000096KEZ,"This is without doubt the best mini series that ever played on PBS and one of the best ever on television.

I watched it faithfully over many months with fascination.  The stories of the individual women imprisoned in a Japanese POW camp during WWII were moving and powerful, and their tale of survival was riveting.  The writing was outstanding and the acting was brilliant.  The women in Tenko lived boring and desperate lives punctuated by times of terror.  They were in an extraordinary and brutal situation yet the series is full of day to day stories that are intimate and believable.  Some of the women grow to great stature under the stress of their imprisonment, others accept the degradation their captors subjected them to, but all of them touch the heart.  Tenko is based on a true story and the author had a deeply compassionate heart.  Even the villains have some light in them.  Because the series went on for so long viewers had an opportunity to really invest and care about these characters and to watch them grow and change for better or for worse.

This is one of the best things I've ever seen on TV.  I've waited for these DVDs to become available in the U.S. for years.  What's the problem?!",1412121600,3,1214,4.621495327102804
7989857,5,B000096KEZ,"The natural bonding that goes on with souls of similar caliber is effectively depicted here.  It sort of echoes what marines say about their experience in the Pacific - that band of brothers but I think it is more obvious here about depth and total commitment because here, it is about civilians and women so it is domestic.

We take care of family because of many reasons but in Tenko, people care for each other because they genuinely care for one another - not every inmate is going to be a friend or part of your circle so it's not automatic.  It's about this experience in its torment SMELTING out impurities so that all that is left is not only ""depth of feeling"" as the song goes but purity of feeling.  I've never felt the ""friendship"" in Sex and the City to be effective at all.  To me, that show was about amazingly expensive clothing on display.

Some of the Tenko characters are offputting and default flinty but ultimately the surviving characters are not corrupt and that really becomes the litmus test - is this person's life caring about - everything gets taken away, stripped down, one's health is in jeopardy, the impetigo on their faces grows and is so disheartening and heartbreaking to the viewer including fellow prisoners that another person's distress - the sight of it - not only carves out scars but also carves out deeper emotional ties.

I absolutely understand Marion offering and WANTING Dr. Mason to live out the rest of her life with her and you wouldn't offer that to just anyone.  The lovely thing is that it is understood that the feeling is mutual.  None of the group wants anything to happen to the others in a deeply felt personal way rather than a general default benevolence.

I think the Japanese occupation had the opposite effect.

Tenko was filmed because the Changi experience was too hot to depict.  Changi is the elephant in the room and its now the site of Singapore's awardwinning airport so it will never fade away.

I watched blurry uploads of these episodes including the reunion on youtube.  Each fifty minute episode is PACKED with events unlike the state of episodic television today which drags on until the last four minutes that end in a cliffhanger only to be followed with yet another drawn out affair and yet another jampacked ending.

I found it exhausting to watch because it clearly was aware in the 1980s that it could not be too accurate so the daily beatings reported in memoirs of woman prisoners are not depicted - the awful suffering of being struck with hard objects is not conveyed at all - there is definitely diplomacy going on in the writing and no sexual assaults so there are red herrings.

Despite all of this, it must have been a very powerful experience watching this group of actresses in reenacting prolonged distress.

I understand better now my own very slight experience with impetigo in tropical Southern Taiwan which I ignorantly accidentally held at bay by constantly swabbing a strangely-unhealing blemish with alcohol swabs and antibacterial ointment.  The blemish did not go away until I returned home and took antibiotics.

Impetigo is disfiguring, disheartening and if left untreated as was the case in the camps, frightening and uncomfortable.  It's a burning active itching movement sensation at the site and these women's faces show the growing abuse of forced lack of hygiene and refusal to provide access to the stored simple medicinal solutions on site.

They do not show the worse and constant afflictions from the unsanitary conditions such as carbuncles, infected wounds, the lice, the scabies - just the marks on their faces like growing port wine stains and the sores of impetigo.

VERY EFFECTIVE despite distilled for the sake of diplomacy.

The Japanese Embassy first raised concerns with the Foreign Office's Far Eastern Department in London about both the content and timing of the show. Diplomats feared it could damage Anglo-Japanese relations, the Foreign Office files show.

A Foreign Office official wrote that the embassy was not trying to deny the historical facts, but felt there was a ""danger that the association of past Japanese violence, and its gratuitous screening at this moment, with the cultural manifestations of the exhibition, would create a bad impression.""",1405468800,5,4659,5.090670170827858
