4893959,5,B005UKIM82,"My boys love Chuggington because of course they are talking trains, little do they know but there are great lessons to be learned.  The characters in Chuggington need to learn to work together to accomplish tasks, accept responsibility, problem solve and have fun with friends.  This DVD is a great addition to any child's DVD collection, especially train fans!  With six episodes too it is a great value!  We love the DVD too because we always seem to miss the show on television.",1330732800,,481,4.759036144578313
4893960,5,B005UKIM82,"Since my 6-year-old can't get enough Chuggington, I've become quite well acquainted with all the 10-minute shorts about the Trainees and the other Chuggers that populate the sunny, colorful town of Chuggington. The best description of this DVD is: It's exactly in keeping with the past DVDs. Which is great, as far as I'm concerned, because these shorts are cheerful, sometimes witty (even to adults), and mercifully short. And, importantly, they teach good values without ever being preachy or heavy-handed. My son gets quite involved in them, to the point where he won't watch certain episodes sometimes because they are a bit emotional for him. There's certainly nothing scary, but often the Trainees have to suffer the consequences of their own poor decisions, and he takes that a bit to heart. (That's a good thing, in my opinion -- besides, everything always turns out well and ends with a laugh before the 10 minutes is up).

Very highly recommended to children who like colorful cartoons with engaging characters and pleasant music -- and to parents who want good values reinforced in a way that's memorable to little ones.

The episodes in this DVD are:

Brewster's Little Helper
Koko Takes Charge
Brewster Knows Best
Zephie's Zoomaround
Nurse Wilson
Wilson and the Paint Wagon

Many of them can be previewed on the Disney website, in case you haven't seen the show.",1330214400,8,1375,4.991266375545852
