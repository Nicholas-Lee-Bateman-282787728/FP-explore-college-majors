2772802,5,B000NO1XHW,Deepak Chopra is the real deal. Follow his advice for a more meaningful life and see how the world around you quicklychanges.  Find the path you've been looking for  and the light appears. Breath easier when you discover your real place and your destiny in this twisted world.  The light is near and peace glows.,1197849600,,312,4.636363636363637

2772804,5,B000NO1XHW,"Wow!  What a visual feast!  And the book is such easy reading.  After watching it twice w/ my wife, we followed along for a third time with the book and handy study guide (included w/ DVD).  Dr. Chopra has hit this one out of the ballpark and I'm hoping to see more visual adaptations of his teachings.  I hear How To Know God is even better and I can't wait to get my copy!

Thanks Deepak!",1187740800,,390,4.065789473684211
2772805,5,B000NO1XHW,"I have also read Deepak Chopra's book ""Seven Spititual Laws of Success"" before I watched the DVD movie.

I believe that you should read the book before you watch the DVD to get full understanding of the natural laws.

Simply brilliant & yet simple to incorporate in your everyday life. Key is to practice these laws everyday.",1186704000,14,325,4.684210526315789
2772806,3,B000NO1XHW,"I have previous tapes of Depak Chopra that I found very enlightening.  I felt that Olivia Newton John was featured primarily in this DVD and I did not receive the same uplifiting message as I did when only Depak Chopra delivered his message.  By the way, I like Olivia Newton John very much.",1183420800,2,291,4.471698113207547
2772807,3,B000NO1XHW,"This may be effective if you've never encountered Dr. Chopra's work before, but I found it more than somewhat cloying and insipid. I'm a huge fan (and own practically all) of Dr. Chopra's work. I'm a less-than-avid fan of Olivia Newton John (whose music is inescapable in this production -- I appreciate her accomplishments on a hard journey, just not her music). Having been completely blown away by his previous DVD, ""How to Know God,"" I was really looking forward to this one, but having also read -- and heard the audio version -- of 7 Spiritual Laws, I was frankly appalled by the mediocre production values and limp and materialistic dramatizations. No transcendence here. Again I say: READ THE BOOK, LISTEN TO THE AUDIO VERSION if you really want to receive the message in its highest form. Also, watch How to Know God for a really transcendent experience. (Blessings to Dr. C, Oliva N-J and everyone involved...)",1180828800,3,920,4.829113924050633
2772808,5,B000NO1XHW,"The spiritual lessons offered by Dr. Chopra are always worth obtaining for positive personal growth. Sometime ago, I purchase the book. However, my lifestyle and the lack of quality time wouldn't allow me to complete or concentrate on many of the chapters. Needlessly to say, I didn't receive the benefits his teachings. However, watching a DVD requires more of our attention and senses. This DVD provides an audience such as myself, curious seekers and students the focusing, listening and learning tool needed there bye improving our learning abilities. Incidentally, the DVD includes a free 20-page study guide. Please become pro-active, be a seeker of spiritual & personal growth. Just check it out for yourselves, It has help me to become more spiritually aware therebye making it possible for me to get the next level; This is a great personal gift; Deepak Chopra ""The Seven Spiritual Laws of Success"" it's available in book form, audio CD and DVD.

- Intention and Desire
- Detachment
- Dharma (Purpose of Life)

The video is only an hour long, so this is more of an overview than anything else. If you are a follower of personal development and spirituality, you will recognize some of the concepts here. It is a synthesis of information from various sources, old and new. You will still gain some good knowledge and direction so it is a worthwhile view.

If you are new to this realm, it is a great place to start. From here, you'll find some topics worthy of further research. The key thing to remember is that no one source is going to give you everything. What I like about this video is that it places responsibility on the individual, as the individual has choices.

Overall, whether you are experienced in the realm of personal development and spirituality, you stand to gain from watching this.

He has no shortage of books, CD's, DVD's, and he is constantly on the lecture circuit. The Seven Spiritual Laws of Success is a film we share with our guests at our recovery retreat. Spirituality is the foundation of successful recovery from addiction, and Dr Chopra is always non-threatening and inclusive. His lilting dictation commands a respect from even our most jaded guests.

I saw this first at the Spirit Cinema International Film Festival in Hamburg last year.  Was great.  One of the better 'talking heads' spiritual movies of late.  However still a talking heads, lecture type film, which I think is a little overdone at this point.  For me I like to be entertained AND enlightened at the same time - for example a movie like 'Spiritual Warriors' accomplishes giving the audience invaluable info and principles, while helping to give folks an actual experience through taking them on a journey, an adventure - a story to relate and live through.

I don't know.  Maybe later....much later, I will try reading it again.
Material is vague, and seemed to me at least to be written in riddles.

--Michelle Crisp, New World Music Melbourne Australia

  ****  newworldmusic.com/aus  ****

Based on the phenomenal best-selling book by famed author Deepak Chopra, The Seven Spiritual Laws of Success DVD offers a life-altering perspective on the attainment of success.

Beloved singer Olivia Newton-John and acclaimed actor-director Bill Duke (X-Men: The Last Stand) share powerful personal stories about challenges they've faced, which have nonetheless placed them firmly on the path towards experiencing life's fullest potential. Their compelling narratives are intertwined with Deepak's essential teachings, distilled into seven simple, yet profound, principles that anyone can employ to create success and abundance in all areas of life.

Featuring all-new original music by Olivia Newton-John and beautiful cinematography, this uniquely satisfying film is one you'll view again and again - and derive something new each time.",1211760000,,1190,5.7988505747126435

2772856,5,B000NO1XHW,"Truely, words of wisdom; and if not laws of common sense, most definately a guide to live by for those planning on learning to go further than this life on the next go round. Thank you deepak and Olivia for taking time to share your thoughts with all of us.",1207526400,,257,4.16
2772857,4,B000NO1XHW,"The audio/video quality of this DVD was very good.  The author's use of short testimonials from a singer, actor, golf-pro, and musical director, as well as, the use of nature scenes, actors, titles to accentuate and emphasize his concepts were excellent.

The seven Spiritual Laws of Success based on the book by Deepak Chopra are:

1. The Law of Pure Potentiality
2. The Law of Giving and Receiving
3. The Law of Karma
4. The Law of Least Effort
5. The Law of Intention and Desire
6. The Law of Detachment and
7. The Law of Dharma or purpose in Life

Each edict is thoroughly explained in the DVD.  The seventh law is the culmination of the others.  Deepak states that Dharma is ""a shift in consciousness that begins by aligning higher visions and then becoming the manifestation of that vision.""

I have neither read the book nor listened to the audio and do not feel it is necessary.  I rented the DVD through NETFLIX.  This one hour and 4 minute DVD can stand on its own merit, but may spark an interest in purchasing a book.  I recommend renting this DVD before making the investment in time and money reading it would entail.  It is a good source to peak an interest in searching for one's gifts and spiritual purpose in life.

As an avid reader of self-help books I found it a good view.  I think you will appreciate it too.",1205971200,30,1331,4.42798353909465
