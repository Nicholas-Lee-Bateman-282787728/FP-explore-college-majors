5726405,5,B00CMCCAH0,My children have learned so much from the Leap Frog movies. I've always been obsessed on them not watching too much TV and really careful on what they watch (it must be educational). But I don't mind them watching these.  Both just love all the programs.,1376956800,3,254,4.521739130434782
5726406,5,B00CMCCAH0,"We have purchased the ""Baby Einstein,"" ""Baby Genius"" and ""Scout & Friends"" videos for our now 2+ year old granddaughter.  All of them have entertained and educated her from the early months until now.  However, these ""Scout & Friends"" videos have by far been her favorites.  She will watch them 2 and 3 times in a row while she plays or eats.  The only negative comment I have is how addictive the music and songs can become.  Sometimes after hearing them all morning I find myself humming them in my head later in the day.  Nevertheless, without hesitation I can recommend the ""Scout & Friends"" collection to all parents and grandparents of young toddlers.",1376697600,,657,4.719298245614035
5726407,4,B00CMCCAH0,"This set includes four DVDs originally released between 2011 and 2013, starring Leapfrog mascot Scout and his friends Violet, Penny, Eli, Axel and Dash.  The four discs include ""Phonics Farm"", ""Number Land"", ""Adventures in Shapeville Park"" and ""The Magnificent Museum of Opposite Words"", which are exactly the same as the individual releases.  So if you're new to the party or only have one of these, it's a cheap and easy way to get them all in one package. Together, they aim to teach basic math, vocabulary, reading and comprehension skills for kids approximately aged 2-4.

The first three are good to excellent, with interesting characters, colorful animation and fun songs (and since they're already available, detailed reviews aren't hard to find).  The last one, ""Magnificent Museum"", is the weakest of the bunch: it's hard to follow, not very intuitive and overall just sloppy compared to better outings like ""Shapeville Park"".  But overall, this four-disc set is a good value for the money, as it's less than half the price of buying them separately.  The packaging itself is kind of a letdown, though, since the DVDs are stacked on a spindle and must be removed to pick out the one you're looking for.  Tough to do without eventually scratching them up, especially one-handed while balancing a sippy cup and a stack of board books.  :)

5726413,5,B00CMCCAH0,"My kids (3 and 10 months) both adore these videos. The preschooler pays very close attention, and probably learns more from his leapfrog videos than he did from the first level of Hooked on Phonics (we like some of the other leapfrog videos as well, like the talking words factory, amazing alphabet amusement park, numbers ahoy, and math adventure to the moon.)

5726434,5,B00CMCCAH0,"As a parent I only promoted educational TV with my toddler and Leap Frog (with Tad and Lily) was one of the favorites for her and myself.
When I became a preschool teacher I brought my collection with me as well as new ones (Scout & Friends) and my students love them.  It helps reinforce their learning.  The construction with shapes help them to identify shapes in their surroundings as well. They just love to sign along with the videos.  They each have their favorites but enjoy each one I have introduced to them (age and learning level appropriateness).",1469491200,,559,4.626262626262626

He watched it everyday and requested it when i didn't put it on. The letter factory has a fun storyline and catchy songs. My son knew his ABCs and was able to identify all the letters in any order, anywhere he saw them before he turned two. Although lower case letters were visible, the capital letters stood out more so that's what my son knows. We're working on lower case now.",1427673600,,506,4.28125

The music and dialogue is pretty rough from an adult's standpoint just as a warning.  I would put them on the same irritation scale as Barney but your child will learn SO MUCH from these movies if you can stomach the tunes.  Also, the characters are diverse and very friendly and helpful to each other which always earns points in my book.",1425513600,5,503,4.434782608695652

5726487,2,B00CMCCAH0,"This is more entertaining (for adults) than the Preschool Prep series (fun songs, storyline, etc) but not as educational.  It also has inaccurate information in them, such as saying that vowels are letters that have more than one sound (many consonants have more than one sound) and that squares are shapes with 4 equal sides (they also must have 4 square corners - parallelograms can also have 4 equal sides).

However, the packaging is difficult for Mommy. All four of the DVDs are on one little pop up thing. Basically, it's just like a single DVD case except the round part in the middle is longer so you can stack all four DVDs on it. I have to take all of the DVDs out if the one I want is on the bottom. I was going to upload a picture of this, but didn't see that as an option for this product. Would still buy again, however, since the price is so much better than buying all four DVDs individually.

5726495,5,B00CMCCAH0,"My son is turning 2 tomorrow and for the past six months, he's obsessively watched the Scout shows and Sesame Street - he likes the ""frog"" LeapFrog shows, but Scout is his favorite.  He knows all his letters and what sounds they make, he can count to 20, knows all his shapes and most colors, and the best part is he's known most of that stuff for 5-6 months now, largely courtesy of LeapFrog.  Phonics Farm was amazing for learning letters, the animals and songs helped him sit still and enjoy it, and after just a week or two he started reciting the letters and sounds along with the show.

Slightly disappointing that Numberland only goes up to 10, but Sesame Street covered the gap for us. :)  I agree with the other reviewers that have said Opposite Museum is the weakest of the lot - the songs are disappointing, and the entire concept is difficult for a toddler/preschooler to follow.  It's not enough to drag down the rest of the series, though, so absolutely still worth picking up the box set if you don't have Netflix to watch them.",1392854400,,1043,4.468421052631579

5726498,5,B00CMCCAH0,"We are generally a TV free house. We don't have cable and can usually just get in the football games as needed with our antenna. We do like movies every now and again, but my kids for the most part have no clue who the newest rage in cartoon viewing would be, and we're ok with that. With that said, this is terrific viewing!! Our son loves these episodes and he really does pick up learning concepts. They are fun and catchy. I've worked with kids for going on two decades and I do feel like the message and delivery system of these DVDs are educational and worth it for young children to view. They do not have any hidden agendas like some educational shows, they have a pure innocence about them and I think that's why kids love them. My four year old son loves it and his almost 8 year old sister likes to watch them, too. And as a parent, they are not hideously annoying should you tackle a load of laundry while watching along! I recommend and would easily purchase as a gift.",1387929600,2,982,4.25668449197861
5726499,5,B00CMCCAH0,"Wow, these are the best learning DVD's on the market. My year old ask me every day to see Scout. She sings the number song, she knows all her vowels, not to mention the phonics and ABC's. I have to brag because she can knows all her ABC's, counts to 40 and says phrases  like ""Good to see you"" How are you? etc., I could go on. We started watching the Leap Frog DVD's since before she was born, along with Baby TV's DVD. The songs are happy and educational, your child will love all the adventures they have. I relate everything she sees to everyday life like counting, site words, ABC's plus  I've managed to learn most of the songs, so I sing them to her through out the day. She love it she's learning and I Loves it, and I'm positive your child will too.",1387238400,7,758,4.149659863945578
5726500,5,B00CMCCAH0,The four pack is a great value and my 2 1/2-year-old loves all of them. Their songs are adorable and she has learned a lot from them. Educational and fun.,1384560000,,154,4.166666666666667
5726501,5,B00CMCCAH0,"I choose this rating as my daughter has Violet, and my son has Scout, so they like the videos with their buddies in them.  They go thru the material in a fun learning way that keeps them watching.",1383264000,5,196,4.157894736842105
5726502,5,B00CMCCAH0,"Got it for my 2 years old.  He would sing and dance to it every time it's played.  Keeps him busy and give us a chance to relax.  The best part is that it's an excellent learning tool.  He can count from 1 to 10 and know all the letters, as well as learned many words.  Would get more Leapfrog DVDs.",1382832000,,299,3.8360655737704916

educational, and delightful video per their parents.",1382572800,,188,5.482758620689655
5726505,5,B00CMCCAH0,"We purchased this on Amazon for a great price.  I pop one of these videos on in the car for my two year old while I'm running errands.  I figure this is better for him to watch and is educational.  The videos are very repetitive, which is great for learning and I think it's great he shouts out the answers when the TV asks him questions.  He is definitely learning his numbers and shapes without even realizing he's learning.",1381104000,,426,4.3544303797468356

8583288,5,B00CMCCAH0,"My kids watch these in the car and actually get mad when I change videos. The musical tunes with learning are a big hit and are easily remembered.  After a few days, they sing along and have them memorized. Even my son with special needs enjoys them. He's non-verbal right now, and it gets him to use his words, on his own, and without my prompting. I swear by these!! We own most of this series! Would def recommend!!!",1528156800,,419,4.30379746835443

8583290,4,B00CMCCAH0,"Pretty good set. My 5 yo likes the letter and sounds one the most , he gets bored with the counting one. Downside is that the dvds are only about 35 mins each.",1523145600,,159,3.8484848484848486
8583291,4,B00CMCCAH0,"Love the videos, but I really wish they were all on one dvd. I didn't read the description well enough and I didn't realize the videos were so short, and all on separate dvds. They also don't auto replay. So if you're a mom who limits screen time, these are perfect for you. But, if you're a lazy mom that uses the tv as a distraction to get something done, or as a way to keep the kids quiet in the car (both me), then the need to change dvds or press play again every 35 minutes is a bit annoying.",1522627200,2,499,3.9504950495049505
