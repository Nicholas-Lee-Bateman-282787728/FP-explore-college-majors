2792851,5,B000O785V0,"Simply put, this is an amazing story, even more so because it is true!  It is a TV movie, first shown on November 23, 1987, but it doesn't seem like a TV movie at all.  In a way, it is a sort of story of both penance and Lena's growing love for the children.  Lena, although a Jew, posed as a Catholic during the war.  Feeling a bit guilty, after so many other Jews lost their lives in the gas chambers, when Lena discovered there were many orphaned Jewish children, she made it her mission to care for them as a way of making up for her 'sin' of denying her heritage.

It seems that Jews were as much hated by the Polish after the war as they were hated by the Gestapo during the war.  So, she faced many difficult and even harrowing situations in her effort to protect, care for and educate those orphaned children.  One interesting aspect was how the children who never denied their heritage felt toward those who became 'Catholic' when they lived as the children of many courageous Catholic families who adopted them for the duration of the war as a means of saving them.  When circumstances in Poland became too dangerous to stay there, she began an odyssey, that would last two years, to smuggle the children across many borders to resettle in Palestine.

This isn't a classic movie, and I don't know how many Holocaust movies their needs to be.  But, this is one certainly worth watching for the simple reason that it in many ways shows the persecution from a child's point of view.  It also shows that Polish Jews - even innocent Jewish children - were in great danger after most people thought the Jew's 'War of Survival' was over.

Unfortunately, the real Lena Kuchler-Silberman passed away just a few weeks before this movie was first televised.",1181260800,67,1756,4.504731861198739

8183977,5,B000O785V0,"What love, what passion, what courage and commitment Lena had for her children. I could connect with her having worked with children over thirty years. You have to have a love for children,a passion and commitment so that you can stay the course when things get rough, when discouragement or disappointment tries to overcome you. You may feel like giving up, but  with love, passion, courage, and commitment present you will see the completion of the calling and mission upon your life. I would recommend this movie to my church, my family and friends.",1382400000,3,552,4.872340425531915

8183979,5,B000O785V0,"I took a chance one day and searched this title under DVD's. It was truly surprising to discover that it was available. This is a stunningly poignant, true story of what happened to the only 100 Jewish children who survived WWII (in the camps or in hiding)when a scholarly Jewish woman discovers them in the streets of Krakow. This film was a TV movie that I loved in the mid-'80's. Get it. Trust me.",1277424000,4,400,4.418918918918919
8183980,5,B000O785V0,"This movie even tough it is from the late 80's is great. It's able to show the struggles from different points of view. The Lena side and the kids side. It is quite interesting the fact that even when the war ""ended"" people still hate each other. This will be a great movie add to any collection or perfect to analyze...",1224201600,5,320,4.262295081967213
8183981,5,B000O785V0,"Fabulous movie, showing the character of a woman who loves children and fights for their safety. Their plight is obvious, they are Jewish children, want to learn, want to live. They were packed up in a place like chickens in a coupe, but this woman gave herself and her life to save these children and bring them to safety. Suspenseful and capturing the attention throughout the movie. We are passing this movie around among friends and everyone says: Now, THIS is a movie! A must for any movie library. I do not hesitate to highly recommend it. It must have been quite an undertaking to create this movie with all the clothes of that area and the props, etc. My hat off to all involved. Fabulous!",1218240000,7,697,4.5396825396825395
