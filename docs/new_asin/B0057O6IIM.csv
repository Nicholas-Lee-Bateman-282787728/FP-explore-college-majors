8460913,5,B0057O6IIM,"Considering I purchased these first 12 episodes for less than 10 dollars, I'd say this is an excellent deal. Amagami SS has quickly become a favorite of mine because for lack of better words, it's touching, with enough romance, drama, and comedy to keep viewers who want what I'll call ""the fuzzies"" to be entertained. In this batch of episodes, we have 4 episodes featuring each heroine as an alternate universe (and alternate personalitied, though such a word doesn't exist) Junichi interact with each heroine resulting in a romance blossoming at the end. What's also nice is that each arc features some of the other heroines we'll meet in short clips, so we have some sort of inkling on their personalities before their arc even starts, which builds familiarity with the characters. I personally like the fact they have done this sort of omnibus ""what if"" format, allowing each girl's personality to shine, and I've gotten some replay value out of each arc. (Personally my favorite thus far is Kaoru, though I get the feeling Rihoko's arc in the next collection is going to be adorable.)

 I would say that this series based on this first set of arcs is good for those who are, like myself, looking for something warm and fluffy to watch, each romance standing alone and being interesting. If however you're looking for a more dramatic series, this would not be your best bet.",1434240000,,1379,4.7899159663865545
8460914,5,B0057O6IIM,"I love this series. Wish it came in one big DVD set, but if you love this anime as much as I do it's well worth it. I've noticed some of the translations are a little funny compared to the version I watched online, and it also misses some of the touches too, but despite that this is just what I wanted, and even a bit more.",1419811200,,324,3.8507462686567164
8460915,5,B0057O6IIM,"In this genre I find myself rooting for one of the girls, and usually I a go for the looser. That is part of the fun of this genre. Although the living of multiple lives in one world is later lamely explained, I think they could have just left it as it is to leave us guessing. If you like harem, you will love this.",1368403200,,316,3.876923076923077
8460916,4,B0057O6IIM,"The Amagami SS series is an adaptation of the dating sim by the same name. In the game, through the choices you make you end up becoming close with one girl out of a number of options. In an intriguing move, instead of just picking one outcome and making a series out of it(as a number of visual novel/dating sim to series work) the anime adaptation actually plays out 6 of the different scenarios. This first disc follows Tachibana-kun in his pursuits - alternatively ecchi and awkward - in his pursuit of three of the female characters: the lovely Morishima-senpai, tomboyish ""buddy"" Kaoru, and the as-shy-as-she-is-adorable Sae-chan.

The odd thing about the series is that, given the shifting narratives, you end up with very different stories, feels and even a rather different Tachibana in each arc. I find him annoying with Morishima and Sae, but he is rather likable in the Kaoru arc. Given the differing stories and feels, you may find yourself liking some arcs and not really liking others. I loved the Kaoru arc but really didn't enjoy the Sae arc. To each their own? But expect the shifting tone and pace.

Overall, as cliched as it can sometimes be (the out-of-reach sempai, the tomboy-ish friend, and the cute kouhai), the romances are all rather cute and endearing. If you are a slice-of-life/romance genre fan, this is a good watch. If you aren't...then might not be for you.",1314576000,11,1391,4.791666666666667
