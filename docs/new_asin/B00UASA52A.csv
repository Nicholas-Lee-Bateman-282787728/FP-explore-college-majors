7032936,3,B00UASA52A,kitschy and cool but really outdated film quality. Its really more of a content issue. looks like 1990s PBS quality...,1453939200,,118,4.95

7032938,3,B00UASA52A,Too much time spent on interviews.  Interesting but not vital.,1449014400,,62,5.2
7032939,3,B00UASA52A,This wasn't as interesting as I thought it would be.  No subtitles or closed-captioned.,1435708800,,87,5.214285714285714
8705025,3,B00UASA52A,too many interviews and not enough scenery,1533081600,,42,5.142857142857143
8705026,3,B00UASA52A,This is an up to date review of what used to be route 66.  It centers on a luxury motorhome which is pictured on the back cover.  The 56? Ford pictured on the front cover did not appear in the segments we watched.  There was very little mention of the old route 66 that we used to travel and love in the 1950s and 1960s.,1528675200,,320,3.8923076923076922
8705027,3,B00UASA52A,"A lot of people talking about Route 66. Not the road trip I was expecting. Also, each disk is a stand alone segment with the intro repeating on each one - not a seamless itinerary.  It's informative but not as entertaining as I had hoped.",1509235200,,238,4.288888888888889
8705028,3,B00UASA52A,Strange that it focused more on Illinois than it did the western end.,1504915200,,69,4.384615384615385
8705029,3,B00UASA52A,It has some nice clips but some of the interviews get a little long-winded.,1502755200,,75,4.428571428571429
8705030,2,B00UASA52A,"The interviews and information are from 2003!!  Not helpful if not current.
We are planning a trip next month and I had to do additional research to see if the places/restaurants/hotels were still in operation.
The opening 5-minutes of repeated information was boring.
I did like the large map and postcards, the DVDs - very disappointing.",1474934400,3,339,5.053571428571429
8705031,4,B00UASA52A,A little different than I thought it would be.,1468108800,,46,4.222222222222222
8705032,3,B00UASA52A,"Too many and too long interviews with people along the route. Would prefer to have more scenic and geographical oriented views of road and towns it passes thru. This video seemed more like advertising the RV used for the documentary. The huge, heavy RV can't possibly travel over some significant parts of the old road such as Sitgreaves Pass in Arizona which the video barely touched on.",1467072000,2,388,4.8059701492537314
8705033,5,B00UASA52A,"Fabulous!!!!  Just like being there in person. My trip is planned for July 24th and I feel like I know all the great places to go to and step back it time.
So gla I got the DVD's",1466640000,,178,3.6842105263157894
8705034,4,B00UASA52A,One version did offer the option of starting in California instead of Chicago.  The others were a pain as you had to work from the back of the book forward.  But all helped us to understand the importance and history of Route 66.,1463011200,,229,4.3023255813953485
