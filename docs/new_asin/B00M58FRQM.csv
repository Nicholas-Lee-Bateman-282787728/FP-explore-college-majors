6561686,5,B00M58FRQM,"This is a great documentary unmasking the nefarious lobbying of the mobile industry to block anything even remotely suggesting that cellphones might be hazardous to your health. The real enemy, it seems, isn't mobile phones themselves, but an industry with incredible power to affect media, government, and average consumers.",1438214400,,325,5.653061224489796
6561687,5,B00M58FRQM,"Could our beloved devices cause harm if not used properly? Use an Ear piece & keep Away from your body.
We have been misled about the safety of our most trusted sidekicks, we must force OEMs to update
their designs, make these devices as safe as possible we know that they have the financial means.
 Our flagships should have the lowest SAR ratings possible, not biggest screens or slimness.
We all love technology, but we love our families more and we want them to be around. We need to seek out the safest devices, we vote with our dollars, vote for health and awareness. We need more research to be done, we don't even fully understand what kind of damage it does.
After watching this film I researched that my phone (iPhone 6) is literally .01 from the FCC legal limit, definitely will be looking for a different device, although beautiful, she is killing me.
Be sure to research WiFi as some countries have issued warning to their citizens (Germany) in regards to WiFi Dangers.
Great film to raise more awareness!",1426550400,7,1018,4.624309392265193

6561689,5,B00M58FRQM,"This documentary is very educational and raises serious concerns about the risks posed by long term use of cell phones and other wireless technology. All parents should see this film, especially now that even toddlers are using toys like IPADS, and the potential long-term effects are quite scary",1412985600,11,296,5.1875
6561690,5,B00M58FRQM,Great film- a must  see for anyone using a cell phone- I guess that is everyone!,1412985600,4,80,4.0
6561691,5,B00M58FRQM,"My wife who is a public health professional and specializes in environmental health problems and solutions said it was a great documentary.  Very well done and informative.  A co-producer is Dr Joel Mascowitz, a UC Berkeley Professor who is also interviewed in the film among other experts in the field.  It's about the risk from cell phones, but touches briefly on the cumulative risk from wireless technology that needs to be addressed.  Anyone using a cell phone more than a few minutes a day would benefit from seeing this film.  also addresses cell phone receiving towers.. very important for the community to work with local governments to make sure that the telecommuications industry does not pay off schools, churches and towns to place receptor towers within 1000 feet where children in particular spend much time.",1412985600,10,824,5.074074074074074
6561692,1,B00M58FRQM,Kevin Kunze performs an amazing magic trick by making an entire documentary without one shred of credible evidence.  Using the same interview techniques employed by comedy shows he twists common scientific vagaries to sound ominous.  Despite being well studied and employed by hundreds of millions of people there is not one shred of proof of any harm caused.  Kunze disregards this huge hole in his logical progression and proceeds to leverage tricks used on the scientifically ignorant to pursue a pointless crusade on a medically and socially irrelevant issue.,1412294400,,563,5.303370786516854
6561693,5,B00M58FRQM,"A must see for all cell phone users, especially for parents. You will not use your phone the same way after seeing the doctors and scientists in this film reveal what they really know about the dangers of cell phone radiation. You probably won't let your kids use phones at all. Recommended for everyone.",1408406400,8,304,4.648148148148148
6561694,5,B00M58FRQM,"If you are holding a cell phone to your head, this is a film worth seeing. It certainly got my blue tooth turned on, and even then I am made to wonder. Well thought out and put together, this is a film that we need to all be watching. And the cast is formidable:

8670379,5,B00M58FRQM,"Excellent documentary.  It raises the questions that need to be considered.  Regardless of your interpretation of the data from the 'science' that has been done so far - the fact that there is no 100% clear cut answer, gives every viewer a heads up that there is a personal choice to be made.  That's what we need in this world of money first - safety later.  Sometimes the truth lies in the big patterns rather than in the details.  People can nitpick about the details and skew the interpretation of the data to fit their perspective.  Time will show us the big patterns.  You get to decide if the long term risk is worth the immediate benefit.",1465603200,,646,4.47008547008547
