5915062,5,B00EI2CUN6,"Currently, this twofer is the only way to get Blake Edwards's clever and wondrous film THE TAMARIND SEED. With nods to Hitchcock and James Bond, this film epitomizes all that was best about film in the Seventies, combining the British Cold War thriller with the American romance film and succeeding in a way that keeps eyes, ears, head, and heart constantly and completely engaged. A stunningly beautiful film.",1408233600,7,410,5.044117647058823
5915063,2,B00EI2CUN6,"If you're interested in this for ""The Tamarind Seed"" (which I was), better look elsewhere--great movie but the pic's really really soft--imho below VHS quality.  The 2.2:1 widescreen makes it even less viewable.  ""Brief Encounter"" is sharper, but only 3:2 aspect. But at least you can make out the actors' facial characteristics with acceptable SD detail.

Have noticed Amazon also offers ""The Tamarind Seed"" in streaming SD, but afraid to pay a few dollars to find it's just as bad.  Can remember a few years back it was floating around on Cable reruns, and the quality (tho pan and scan) was much better than this.  Wonder what ever became of that version...",1407024000,7,660,4.857142857142857
5915064,4,B00EI2CUN6,"I remember reading&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Tamarind-Seed/dp/0722112289/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Tamarind Seed</a>, Evelyn Anthony's bestselling spy novel, back when it was first published. I lived in the Virgin Islands then, and it was a big deal in the bookstores there because most of the story takes place in Barbados. Then Blake Edwards went there and filmed it with Julie Andrews and Omar Sharif, and that was big local news, too. I never saw the film at the time, and I forgot all about it until a couple of weeks ago, when I found an old copy of the book and read it again. I came to Amazon, hoping to find a DVD of the movie. This odd double album was the only DVD version available, so I got it.

I'm sure there's a reason these two titles were bundled together under the heading ""Dangerous Romance,"" but they couldn't be more different. I watched the BRIEF ENCOUNTER remake with Sophia Loren and Richard Burton, which is okay, but stick with the classic original version from David Lean (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Brief-Encounter/dp/B009B5XHEG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Brief Encounter</a>)--it's #2 on the British Film Institute's list of the 100 best British films of all time, and it's truly a masterpiece.

As for THE TAMARIND SEED, it's a good, solid, old-fashioned spy thriller set against the Cold War, with Julie Andrews as a secretary for an official in British Intelligence and Omar Sharif as a highly-placed military man from the USSR. They meet while both are vacationing in Barbados, and they meet again back in London and Paris. When they fall in love, the intrigue begins.

Blake Edwards keeps everything moving in various colorful locations, with good performances and a lush John Barry musical score. The print on this DVD is in anamorphic widescreen, and the picture is good, but the soundtrack is a bit muffled. Evelyn Anthony's novel was better than the movie version, but fans of Julie Andrews should enjoy watching her looking great (in Christian Dior) and acting sexy (not a nun or a nanny, for once). Sharif is really charming--he's actually the best thing in the movie. The great Anthony Quayle plays a British ""handler,"" and Dan O'Herlihy, Sylvia Sims, and Oscar Homolka costar. Recommended.",1405814400,11,2333,5.368852459016393

Tamarind Seed is dated. Brief Encounter's original version is more plausible and better acted.",1404950400,2,182,5.777777777777778

5915068,4,B00EI2CUN6,"It's not a great transfer by any means, but an anamorphic widescreen transfer of TAMARIND SEED is a must for any Blake Edwards fan.  Great, under-appreciated film gets an ""ehh"" release, which is better than a terrible release.  From the John Barry score to the literate script, this is well worth a viewers' time.  I haven't seen the Burton/Loren film yet, but for under 10 I'm happy to have Tamarind Seed in anamorphic widescreen.",1386028800,5,431,4.797297297297297

8605436,4,B00EI2CUN6,"""Brief Encounter"" seemed more like a T.V. movie with its slow pace, but Sophia Loren and Richard Burton still gave good performances in a rather boring film. The second feature ""The Tamarind Seed"" was a big departure from most Julie Andrews movies, here she was a widow involved with a Russian spy played by Omar Sharif when he was still a romantic icon. The two have some nice chemistry together and the story keeps one guessing until the very end. It was nice to see the old character actor, Oscar Homolka still playing the bad guy.",1475452800,3,534,4.572916666666667

8605439,3,B00EI2CUN6,"I have mixed feelings about these two movies.  While the plots were interesting and the lead roles were played by Academy Award-caliber actors and actresses, there just wasn't much chemistry between them, IMO.  It almost seemed as though they were miscast -- I think Burton and Andrews would have been better together in Brief Encounter, just as Sharif and Loren would have better in The Tamarind Seed.  Sophia Loren, in particular, was miscast as a married English mother and part-time social worker.  You can thank her husband, Carlo Ponti, for that since he was the film's director.  I think the part called for an English actress, and Julie Andrews would have been a good choice.  Omar Sharif was very believable as a disgruntled Russian intelligence officer, but he and Julie Andrews didn't have much on-screen chemistry.  Sharif and Sophia Loren would have been an interesting pairing.  All in all, both movies are quite well done and certainly worth watching, but they could have been so much better with different people in the lead roles.",1469577600,5,1047,4.977011494252873
8605440,3,B00EI2CUN6,I bought this movie for a friend who wanted The Tamarind Seed. Wasn't really my cup of tea but I bought it for her at a good price on amazon and it came with a bonus movie.,1445472000,,172,3.675675675675676
8605441,5,B00EI2CUN6,"The digital transfer to DVD was not as bad as I expected, based on reviews from other people.  Both films on this DVD were very acceptable quality, considering they were transferred probably from an earlier VHS format. And I'm delighted that I could finally get to watch The Tamarind Seed, especially.  Glad that I now have them in my film library.",1443830400,4,348,4.688524590163935
