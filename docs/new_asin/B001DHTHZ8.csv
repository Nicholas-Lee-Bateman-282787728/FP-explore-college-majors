3531082,5,B001DHTHZ8,"I bought this series for my Mom but have used it more than her.  If you like conservative views like Mark Levin, you'll love the subtle, yet confident delivery of Friedman.  He genuinely acknowledges differing points of view, then picks them apart, asking you not simply to rely on his opinion, but the real world examples of why his observations are true.  This information must be re-learned by our population before it's too late.  As Regan said & Friedman verifies ""Government is the cause of, not the solution to, most of our current problems.",1345334400,6,548,4.797872340425532
3531083,5,B001DHTHZ8,"This series is excellent. It was truly prophetic when it came out and human nature being as it is, is as up to date as can be.
Well done in every way.",1333238400,6,150,3.71875
3531084,5,B001DHTHZ8,Everything expected and more. Arrived in a timely fashion well packaged also. A very fine addition to the books and videos on similar topics already owned.,1327276800,2,155,5.0
3531085,5,B001DHTHZ8,"Milton Freedman shares his views on what made America strong and how to keep it that way.  It is a wonderful and powerful examination of our country form the economic, social and political points of view.  He describes how America can get back to its roots and prosper again.  Even though these sessions were produced in the '70s, upon close examination it is realized that the principals he expouses can and will work in today's world.",1288310400,10,436,4.7105263157894735
3531086,5,B001DHTHZ8,"This video series is a phenomenal teaching tool from a champion of the free market.

It is very well made considering when it was produced.  Every issue Friedman tackles in this series is (unfortunately) still around 30 years later for us to debate, so the material covered is not dated (however, the fashion and hairstyles recorded here are dated and it can be hard not to notice and snicker a little).

Friedman visits many places around the world, shows the origin of the issues through history, compares and contrasts arguments, and brings the material into perspective showing any hidden, visible, and ecomonic costs.

This series shows that Friedman has to be one of the most civil human beings to have graced this planet.  He is articulate, thorough, and detail oriented when needed.  He teaches by backing up his statements, and does so professionally, without malice and without raising his voice... all of this is starkly contrasted to his opposition whom he tries to debate at the end of each show.

I cannot say enough good things about this series.",1282176000,26,1061,4.893854748603352
3531087,2,B001DHTHZ8,"I got this documentary in hopes that it would translate economic concepts and explain how free-trade economic policies help economies grow.  Unfortunately, there is more emphasis on advocating free-trade, no-regulation policies and little is done to explain, in depth, how these policies will help an economy.  While these basic ideas are clearly the foundation of strong modern economies, he takes these good ideas to ridiculous extremes. The real low point of the film is when he finds a labor-sharing agreement in the Hippocratic Oath.

The best parts of the film are the segments of how inflation happens and how the Great Depression began.  These parts of the documentary really get into the mechanics of how these phenomena occur, though the part on the Great Depression is marred by his making the overarching conclusion that the government screws everything up.

I could not help but wonder if his total faith in complete free-market economics would have been as shaken as Greenspan's after 2008 meltdown, when the private sector screwed everything up and the criticism was that government did not intervene as much as they should have earlier on.",1279843200,11,1155,5.1550802139037435
3531088,5,B001DHTHZ8,"This video should be required viewing for every school child.  It is amazing how accurate Milton Freidman's predictions for the future were, especially since this video was made in 1980.",1279065600,21,186,5.2
3531089,5,B001DHTHZ8,"This book truly puts in place the evil forces in our nation & world that would and is erroding freedom. Free to Choose shows how individule ""selfishness/greed"" is only one doing best for himself and strangely benifits others in each persons quest to do what is good for them.

The evil that gets in the way of our freedom is associated with others forcefully spending our money and our time rather than let individules decide what is best.

This came out of the 1980's but sounds like today.

This book is great and hits the point with a good personel evaluation from Milton and then a open group discussion later after each subject from a diverse group.",1278892800,7,654,4.572649572649572
3531090,5,B001DHTHZ8,"This PBS television series proves there's nothing new under the sun. In these times of economic and political turmoil, Dr. Friedman brings clarity and understanding for those needing answers to the confusion of health care reform and much more. This series should be required viewing in economics classrooms everywhere.",1250208000,37,319,5.530612244897959
3531091,5,B001DHTHZ8,Series is over 30 years old but still timely to help understand what has gone wrong in the economy. It repeatedly proves with empirical evidence that results are more important than intentions.,1232150400,46,193,5.0625
3531112,5,B001DHTHZ8,very enjoyable watching an economic genius at work .  should be mandatory viewing by all  college students before they are permitted to graduate . further all persons running for political office should also be required to watch these DVDs,1453680000,,239,5.102564102564102

3531117,5,B001DHTHZ8,I absolutely love this product excellent series and excellent discussion at the end of every segment. This is a must have for everyone who loves their freedom as well as any teacher of economics. wish I had this in my classroom.,1410480000,,228,4.585365853658536
3531118,5,B001DHTHZ8,A visual preface to the book and a chance to listen to and see some of the people discuss the relevant issues facing us today.,1403136000,,126,4.08
3531119,5,B001DHTHZ8,"Very interesting series. Each episode starts with a video by Milton Friedman presenting his thoughts on a given subject, followed by debate between public intellectuals of the day, liberal and conservative. Several things struck me. First, the continued relevance of the subjects covered, and the continued clarity and sense of Friedman's analysis. Second, the debates are remarkably civil; it is a reminder of how far public discourse has fallen. Third, it is very interesting to see folks like Thomas Sowell and Donald Rumsfeld in their youth! Finally, it reminded me of the bad old days when the left controlled nearly all media outlets; there was no internet and no talk radio, and when something like this slipped through, it was something unique and special. Of course, you will also observe that AETN did not let Friedman have the last word most of the time. But the arguments stand on their own merits, and Friedman is undiminished as a keen thinker and a winsome communicator. May we see his kind again!",1401753600,,1012,4.958823529411765
3531120,5,B001DHTHZ8,"This is one of the best gifts anyone could give to their children (teens and up) to help them understand economics.  This man is simply brilliant, but manages to make it easy for anyone to understand, as well as interesting.",1396224000,,224,4.6
3531121,5,B001DHTHZ8,It.s like a holy grail of economics. I highly recommend this. My kids and I watch and I enjoy hearing what they have to say afterward.,1393545600,,134,4.1923076923076925
3531122,5,B001DHTHZ8,A Noble Prizing winning economist illustrates economic theory in very simple terms and it's impact on history and your everyday life.  Truly interesting and enlightening.,1381017600,,170,5.8
3531123,5,B001DHTHZ8,I was first introduced to this video series 13 years ago in high school by my economic teacher.  Every other Friday he would show us an episode of the series as a break from our lectures and math work.  I might also add that it was followed by our fantasy stock market scoring event(we weren't allowed to conduct insane margin trading back then but we were allowed to leverage our current holdings value and borrow at the current prime rate haha).  I'd have to admit while I didn't give the concepts the attention they deserved even for a football player who was more concerned with that nights game or the girls in my class the videos sparked a curiosity that found me years later as an adult reading his book and viewing all the episodes of this series again.  I'd recommend this series for ages 13 to adult because Friedman had such a marvelous ability to reduce complex issues in to easy to understand concepts that could be digested by someone who might have the most basic of economic understanding.  My favorite part of the videos happens at the end of every episode when he takes on all comers as a collection of intellectuals on the right and left in the library of the Chicago School of economics.  What a treasure of a video series that is as relevant today(possibly more so) than it was when it was aired.,1377216000,,1317,4.489539748953975
3531124,5,B001DHTHZ8,"This video digs deeper than the politics. Where today all you hear
is politicians telling people what they want to hear instead of how
to fix problems with common sense and practical answers.
Nearly everything in this series is applicable to the economic
problems of today. Including the immigration problems of today.",1367971200,2,318,5.134615384615385
3531125,5,B001DHTHZ8,"One of the foremost economists of our time. Not only does Milton Friedman understand how it works, he articulates it so well that anyone can understand it",1363651200,,154,4.7407407407407405
3531126,5,B001DHTHZ8,The set is a recorded series that aired on tv.  There are several episodes detailing certain topics in economics.  Friedman goes through each topic like a lecture for about 40 minutes and then at the end of each episode is a round table discussion in moderated by a host.  The round table are four people who try to poke holes in Friedman's arguement.  There are some famous people in the discussions.  Beware the programs were recorded in the late 70s but the topics still have meaning today.,1360195200,2,493,4.620689655172414

Never again will the world have so many people of such high ideals in the same place at the same time with the same opportunities.  But I thank God for men like Milton Friedman who has the courage and ability to articulate a wholesome respect for the life, liberty and property of his fellow man.",1357084800,4,363,4.484848484848484

3531131,5,B001DHTHZ8,I read the book a few years ago.  It is one of those works that completely changed the way I look at the world.  This series should be mandatory viewing for any young person beginning their journey in life.,1352160000,,206,4.256410256410256
8293501,5,B001DHTHZ8,"Dare to dive into the reason and sense of Milton Friedman--Nobel Prize winning economist.  He makes the complications of economics completely understandable to anyone who will go on this amazing historical journey that brings us right up to the present day--clarifying issues that are still with us, but for which the solutions are patently obvious, simply presented with Friedman's genius.",1526774400,,390,5.5
8293502,5,B001DHTHZ8,"The best part of these series is that they are completely relevant today.  When Friedman talks about what is about to happen if the society stays on the course of socialism and control of the markets (for all the best intentions, as usual), given that 30+ years have passed, we can actually see the results that he postulated.  And he was spot on.  I watched the series on-line and then ordered the 1980 version, as I found it more interesting and more detailed than the shortened 1990 version.  As to a comment here that this is more about politics than economics, well, politics determines the economic system.  Milton does not get into detailed spreadsheets and simulations of this vs that; they are unnecessary.  He shows broad areas and provides ample real-life examples of what happens when various economic/political choices are made.  These series are guaranteed to drive a Progressive/Socialist crazy and force them to change the subject.",1488758400,,947,4.993630573248407
