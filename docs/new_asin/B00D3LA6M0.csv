5772262,3,B00D3LA6M0,"I give ""No One Lives"" three stars, because it was well crafted with excellent acting, but how about a little bit of believability
here. We have a serial killer who has an unlimited repertoire of ninja skills, never slips up or gets killed, and ends up walking
away at the end of the film, like he's taking a stroll through the park.

It's simple mathematics, if you make a film with some realism, it does become more interesting and exciting. It also doesn't insult
our intelligence out here, in the viewing audience.

Cordially,

5772263,5,B00D3LA6M0,"The film opens with 3 subplots. Emma (Adelaide Clemens), an heiress is kidnapped by a psychopath. Meanwhile our unnamed star (Luke Evans) and Betty (Laura Ramsey) are relocating. He is somewhat of a sociopath, an idea role for someone who can't act. The third subplot concerns a group of criminals who are robbing a mansion when the owners come home and surprises them with deadly results.

About 20 minutes into the film the subplots come together and we find ourselves rooting for a sociopathic killer.

The film contains gallons of blood and gore. It is smartly done for a low budget. It has a decent script along with good characters, dialouge, and some decent acting. Luke Evans has a cold delivery that is darkly comical,""You people never heard of zip ties?"" Adelaide Clemens as Emma was equally cold and darkly comical.

Not for everyone, but one I liked.

5772264,5,B00D3LA6M0,"I bought this from Flex View and it was a blind buy but thankfully it was a great film .I watched it twice back to back and enjoyed it the second time even more than the first.

A group of inept criminals fail at robbing an estate. After the failed attempt they see a couple in a nice car and decide to rob and kidnap them instead. Bad Idea especially when one of the people they kidnap is a sadistic serial killer.

The acting is top notch as are the gore effects. The gore is extremely well done and will satisfy the most die hard slasher fanatic. We get severed heads,face and head bashing,slashing,gunshot blasts,arrows through the torso and even a guy put through a huge industrial grinder and that's just some of the kills.

The film starts off fast and never lets up, it's high octane all the way. Luke Evans known only as ""Driver"" really took this role and ran with it using restraint where it was needed and went full throttle during his murderous rampage.
This is a new favorite for me,everything worked. There were a few unanswered questions but I think it was for the sake of ambiguity.",1375833600,7,1098,4.425742574257426
5772265,5,B00D3LA6M0,"I just finally watched this film just a few minutes ago... however ironic that it is not on dvd yet until August... But, regardless it is a good film, with plenty of blood, and action to keep things moving at a decent pace. The story revolves around a couple travelling, who get abducted by a gang of home invaders, who robbed a house and killed the family in a panic. Soon they discover a kidnapped girl inside the trunk of the couples car, and soon are being killed off one-by-one by a psychopathic killer... and it never lets up from there.

There are really no likable characters, even the kidnapped girl is kind of a pain in the ass... and you kind of wish everyone dies... You can't really like the psycho killer, but you kind of feel like he is dispensing some justice against the thugs he is stalking...

There is nothing really original here, sort of a been there, seen it before kind of thing... but still it is quite well done... I say, check it out.. and it'll ""kill"" an hour and a half easily...

This film is part of WWE studios and WWE wrestler Brodus Clay appears in the film as one of the home invaders...",1372723200,3,1122,4.333333333333333

When they run into a couple at a local diner they think the found their targets. Things go a little too far and now the criminal group finds themselves on the run and in danger. This is another movie where it is entertaining and fun to watch but really is nothing original. This is really nothing more then an I Spit On Your Grave type movie. Someone who wants revenge begins to pick off the perpetrators one by one in increasingly awful and gory ways. I am almost ashamed to admit it but as bad as this movie is I was entertained the whole time and it actually was pretty faced paced so that also helped.

5772267,5,B00D3LA6M0,No Back Story At All BUT Good Gory Movie,1524096000,,40,3.5555555555555554
5772268,5,B00D3LA6M0,"The premise for this is, Backwoods bandits find they've made a grievous error when they victimize a couple who are not nearly as helpless as they seem. Its a good summary, but an even better one would be A disturbingly likable psychopath terrorizes and mutilates a bunch of dumb redneck criminals after they mess up his escape plan.

It has some awesome lines (I'm a sucker for great one-liners)--the last few of the movie are the best, but there are some other great ones throughout the whole film. If you're looking for a realistic movie, why are you even checking this out? ;) It's a ridiculous, fun, slasher (but not horror) flick, where the bad guys get victimized by an even worse guy.

Im sure if Luke Evans himself wasn't so likable, this might not be as good. But omg, I cant stop laughing at his wonderful sociopathic character. Im super glad I splurged and bought this for a whopping $6 before I watched it, because its quickly made its way to my Top 10 Favorite Movies list.",1523232000,,986,4.533707865168539

5772276,4,B00D3LA6M0,"Luke Evans plays a terrifying individual who is a cross between a serial murderer, and a total psychopath....you know a director is doing his job when you are actually rooting for this amoral person:  and the reason is because he gets wronged by a motley crew of backwoods robbers who think they know cruelty until this Evans character shows them what REAL cruelty is.

They may be a bunch of ""demons"", but he is Satan incarnate, an inexorable killing machine with absolutely  zero compunctions or regard for life.

amongst the explicit carnage there is a lot of eye candy thrown in, especially the adorable Lindsey Shaw, but a stern warning:  you better have a strong stomach for this movie, as the violence is gory to the max, and unrelenting. Somehow, it works, primarily because of the riveting portrayal of the ""protagonist"" by Luke Evans.

There is a decided creepiness in this movie from beginning to end.  But what rescues it from the typical slasher film is the quality of acting and direction.",1515369600,,1003,4.796511627906977

This could have been a cult classic.  Luke Evans is such a great actor and honestly made this whole film.  There is so much potential for his character and what motivates him.  You can see that under the right circumstances he could be the bad ass who is unleashed on the world's worst.  For all we know he may have been a trained assassin of some sort who just became a bit twisted.  Either way I love his character and wish this really took off.

5772292,4,B00D3LA6M0,"I suppose first thing is first - expect a film titled to imply violence to likely contain violence.  There is no doubt this film is violent and bloody, perhaps more so than many would want to watch; however, when the protagonist is a psychopath obsessed with killing as almost a brutal art, the context needs to be believable.  This isn't the sort of mindless torture-porn that you find in Hostel, but it doesn't hold back.

The main character, the ""Driver,"" is travelling with his assumed wife; they are eventually provoked by a gang member named Flynn, perhaps equally psychotic as he is depicted gunning down a family a few scenes prior without any real reason, but is quickly reigned in by the gang's leader Hoag.  Flynn, however, has already established them as a target and quickly strikes - the couple is captured, taken to an unknown location to be interrogated/exploited and likely killed.

During these moments, certain revelations are made and we discover the calm, emotionless ""Driver"" hides his true nature; the gang may be quite capable of terrifying many who encounter them, but they are substantially under-equipped to handle the nightmare they have captured.  The ""Driver"" has no motive to kill until his assumed wife gives him the motivation needed.  Hell is unleashed as the gang is systematically taken apart.

There is a secondary story more profound that is revealed piece by piece throughout the film, but I will not give it away.  It is what really makes this film interesting - the film has a killer who acts on impulse and little remorse, the film has another killer who acts with cunning and purpose; both would be considered insane.  The film also alludes to the even more frightening killer that exists within every person; if that potential is brought to the surface through exceptional stress and circumstance, even the least threatening person can become the Driver's equal.

If you can stomach violence and gore, I'd say give it a viewing - definitely an above average vengeance/crime/horror film.",1507939200,,2030,4.958702064896755

5772296,4,B00D3LA6M0,"The cleverness of the plot twists, well written dialogue and juicy gore was enhanced by the very well done performances by Evans and Clemens. I found the dynamic between Evans and Clemens beyond fascinating, their character portrails truly made this movie stand apart. I also want to add in the unique relationship between Evans and Ramsey which causes you wanting to see a prequel just to see how it all started. It was interesting to watch as if Evans was on one side of a wheel and then either Ramsey or Clemens were on his opposite side, both bringing him to action. The supporting cast did a great job, especially Knapp and Shaw with Magyar following up behind. Overall I was delighted and engaged in this intellectually campy horror film....

Luke Evans is brilliant in this tale of a criminal gang who takes on someone who's more than a match. It is VERY gory but it is brilliant, and has a few great twists that help it transcend the genre.

I listened to a podcast where one guy (a director or screenwriter) said he was in a relationship but when he watched this movie with his SO she broke it off! lol. I don't much like gore but I could watch this again and again.

I hate straining my ears in movies.
So the sound guys in this movie need to all be fired..haha!!
I also wish they had given a back story on the killer and why he was immortal and couldn't die.
The gore is excellent and there is no cgi used here!!Im 45 and love my special effects cgi free..Ive seen it all in the gory movie department in the last 30 something years so im unshockable.
Not a horror movie in my opinion but a nice graphic revenge, action packed thriller that delivers the goods in the gore department..Its hard for movies made in the last 16 years to impress me and keep me entertained all the way through.
So sick of remakes that are all horrible and the pg-13 garbage constantly being shoved down our throats.
Although we lack in story and are left asking questions this movie was a blast and had me smiling and entertained all the way through. I like seeing fresh faces and not the same actors all the time in my movies. This cast was a nice group of actors ive never seen before.
Anyhow..i reccomend watching this movie twice to pick up certain things missed on your first viewing. If you hate gore move on and don't watch this..I see some reviews complaining about it Lol...get over it people..this isn't the 80s..regular t.v.shows gore on a regular basis these days.
Anyhow..if you are like me and are hard to please these days with all these stupid movies being thrown at us and love special effects minus cgi..then i highly recommend you see this movie.",1461196800,,1726,4.396875

5772401,5,B00D3LA6M0,"Though I went into viewing this movie with the knowledge something bad was going to happen, I actually had no idea it was going to turn out as it did. A relocating couple are harassed by a gang of thieves who are already quarrelling among themselves. That's a bad enough start. There are cryptic references to why they are moving and veiled references to a mysterious ""she.""  When they stop at a motel, mention is made of the man's unusual name which he says is of historical significance but the name itself is never spoken. Although the fact of his name comes up later, the name itself is never spoken, making one wonder what it is, and creating a little mystery inside this bigger one.

From the moment, the couple is captured by the thieves and the woman kills herself, the story does a complete turnabout from what the audience is being led to expect.

This is a chilling, frightening movie, a slasher film to be sure but not your average slasher. This one is has a thoughtful script and some very good acting in it. It's suspenseful, and frightening as the killer goes so about methodically and calmly dispatching his victims. The characters are all flawed and have no redeeming qualities, not even the supposed victim, and there won't be much sympathy as each dies. In fact, the audience will probably wonder why they hadn't killed each other off long before.

If Luke Evans had brought this characterization to the screen when he was in ""Dracula Untold,"" that movie would have been a masterpiece.

It is a weird experience.

Basically, a bunch of low-life, criminal rednecks screw-up a robbery and decide to make up for their financial loss by kidnapping a nice couple who happen to be eating at their favorite redneck diner.

Big Mistake.

Before you can say Jason Voorhies, there is redneck gore flying everywhere as it is shot, woodchipped, knifed and whatever you call the bit with the car engine.  Don't get me wrong, the rednecks deserve it, but....actually, I started feeling sympathetic for the rednecks about half-way in.

Fortunately, there is a twist in the form of a kidnap victim that the audience can root for in what is otherwise an ""Aliens v. Predators"" situation.

5772421,4,B00D3LA6M0,"No One Lives was produced by WWE studios but don't hold that against it.  This is a sometimes smart, and generally enjoyable films where the tables are turned on a gang of road thieves and the hunters become the hunted.  Hoag (Lee Tergesen) leads a band of thieves that includes Flynn, Tamara (America Olivo) and Ethan (WWE wrestler Brodus Clay).  Flynn, looking to get back into Hoags good graces for a botched job, targets a young couple at a roadside restaurant who are in the process of moving.  Flynn runs the couple off the road and brings them back to the gangs hideout where they go through their belongings.

However, the mysterious man (Luke Evans) is more than the mere yuppie that he appears.  As Flynn searches the trunk of his car, he finds a hidden compartment where a teenaged girl is being held hostage.  They discover that the girl is a wealth heiress named Emma, and she was the only survivor of a bloody rampage by a serial killer.  There is a two million dollar reward for Emmas safe return but collecting the money will be easier said than done as they man they kidnapped is the very same killer and Emma warns the gang that he will kill them all.

Evanss character, referred to only as The Driver reminds you a bit of Gerard Butler character in Law Abiding Citizen.  Hes a genius level intellect that is capable of killing with clever traps from a distance or close up and personal.  He quickly makes short work of several of the gang in devious and bloody fashion and begins to toy with the remaining survivors.  Evans fits the low-key, urbane killer perfectly, playing an almost emotionless Michael Myers characters sans the mask.

The one glaring weakness to the film is that there is no surprise to Evanss character. We know from what transpires before he is kidnapped that there is something strange about his character.  What could have been a nice swerve is needlessly tossed out the window so shame on Director Ryuhei Kitamura for that.

The rest of the cast is nothing to get excited about although Adelaide Clemens as Emma does give a strong performance as the victim who begins to bind with her captor.

To the point it's comedic. If you're like her, might as well check it out, I've never seen so many higher end actors in such a shoddy affair, they almost make it worthwhile... I'm being unkind and a little harsh, let me step back.

 I'm not going to lie, over a few beers and some pizza it wasn't a waste of money. But I doubt I'll be watching it again and it's by no means a ""good movie"".",1436140800,,562,4.054054054054054

I love how the film doesn't dawdle, and the gang quickly realizes they've made a fatal mistake. Awesome action and gruesome gore.

5772434,5,B00D3LA6M0,"A lot of movies toy with the idea of evil being the good guy, or at very least the sympathetic protagonist. In many cases this premise is subverted and what starts out as the evil turns out really to be good, the good then becoming evil, etc.  No One Lives looks as if its headed in that direction until it abruptly doesnt. A slick and polished slasher film, No One Lives decides to play, what might otherwise be a subversive anti-hero trope, as a serious evil vs evil duel of sorts. It works well when done correctly.

The story follows a rich couple, played by Luke Evans and Laura Ramsey, who are relocating for an undisclosed reason. There is something different about them right from the get go, something eerie and undefined. Next we meet a group of highwaymen who are certainly the type of people your momma warned you about. Thieves, killers, lawbreakers, you name it. Lead by Lee Tergesen the group cross paths with our rich couple. Predictably the loose cannon of the group decides to waylay the couple and from there things begin to get good.

As mentioned above, convention typically dictates that even if your protagonist isn't a good guy in a traditional sense they should still be empathetic or audiences won't care about their struggle, conflict, or outcome. The one exception to this?
Make your protagonist The Unfettered. An extremely version of the anti-hero, the Unfettered has no limitations, no boundaries, no inconvenient moral code, no scrupules. They are unique in their focus on a specific goal or outcome. They care not for the ripple effect their actions cause to others or society at large. They may have emotions but don't expect those to get in the way of their objective. Ruthless and cunning (assuming they are smart), devoted to to the end game, and completely immune to bargaining, reason, pity, remorse, fear, you name it.

Sound scary? Absolutely.

So when our protagonist decides these less than reputable people have made a mess of his grand plans, well all hell breaks loose.

I try to avoid spoilers here so Im not going to get into any more specifics. Just know that this movie takes a bad guy vs bad guys plotline to the extreme. Uber violent, super bloody, over the top gory on a couple occasions, and unrelenting make it very hardcore film indeed.

All that aside, its more an action movie than a horror film. Think Taken mashed with Friday the 13th. Can you imagine Liam Neeson on screen gutting a body, dropping arms and legs into a woodchipper, slicing off a womans face while smiling? You can? Youre a sicko who will probably really enjoy this film.

No One Lives is a fun gore-ride through vendetta turned sport. Luke Evans is fantastic from beginning to end. His counterparts, the beautiful Adelaide Clemens and creepy-ass Derek Magyar, are also dazzling throughout.

The film lacks in quality script, the dialouge or screenplay is attracious, almost sounding like slapstic comedy.  The film borerlines on thriller/dark comedy. This is not a horror in my opinion. No One Lives (2012) is kept in similar atmosphere like You Are Next (2011), Evil Dead (2013) or even The Cabin in the Woods (2012).

The film has a good plot/concept but it could have been done better.  I think the ending sort of ruins the entire film, and the soundtrack is really poor.

It's a bloodbath for sure, but I won't hesitate to say that the performances by the cast are extraordinary in a genre where the acting frequently doesn't much matter.  Luke Evans is riveting in his role as a serial kidnapper/killer and electrifies every scene he is in.  You even root for the skilled assassin because he has a twisted sort of code of honor he exists by, that and because the gang of criminals he has his sights on is even more hateful than he is.  Matching Evans' performance is a wonderfully convincing Adelaide Clemens as a young kidnap victim of his that has gotten away and has ended up with a sleazy group of criminals who have botched a major job and unwittingly taken their frustrations out on the killer at a local cafe.  Boy did they make a mistake.  Evans and Clemens are stunning in the film's denouement, as well written a script as you're going to find in a horror movie.  The production values are high and the editing gives the story the proper pace and tone.  No One Lives does its genre proud.",1416614400,3,1119,4.424390243902439

5772486,5,B00D3LA6M0,"No One Lives equals a highly literate horror/slasher film with great twist.  I actually just caught this the other night, and absolutely thoroughly enjoyed this film. I am not all that big on slasher films, but thought this was a tremendously fun twist on the genre.  And it answers the question... What happens when you terrorize the wrong person, and that person is a whole lot more vicious than you are?  No One Lives is a whole lot of things including ultra gory (but done in a fun exciting horror film manner), very suspenseful, outright fun, and extremely well acted by the main actor Luke Evans.  It is also extremely literate in the dialogue, especially as we learn more about Luke Evans, and what drives him and his main co-hort Adelaide Clemens.

I am not the biggest fan of the horror genre, but No One Lives is a cut way above the rest.  Highest recommendation.

P.S. One comment about a similarly themed film called ""You're Next"" in which the main character is a woman who takes takes vengeance upon a group of killers.  Although the critics seem to love that one (mostly I think because the lead role is a woman kicking butt in a bow to satisfy some politically correct agenda), No One Lives is in every way, and I mean every way, superior to You're Next.  If you are going to spend your money, spend it on No One Lives.  It is so much more entertaining in my opinion.  Thanks for reading.",1408665600,,1403,4.484251968503937
5772487,5,B00D3LA6M0,"No One Lives is a FANTASTIC slasher/revenge movie with a sudden and dramatic plot twist 20 minutes in I did NOT see coming!

After a group of thugs shoot a family while they're pulling up in their driveway in graphic bloody windshield-shattering fashion, they set their sights on a couple inside a restaurant because the thug actor played by Derek Magyar has an irresistible attraction to the wife of Luke Evans character.  Of course Luke plays it off as just another idiot who should be ignored when he approaches their table but Derek, well, he's a persistent one!  He wants Luke's wife and he wants her NOW!  He doesn't skip a beat in revealing how much he desires Luke's wife so later that night when Luke and his wife are driving down the road, Derek crashes his vehicle into theirs causing a wreck and kidnaps the two of them right on the spot.  Oh Derek you foolish man you.  He just didn't realize how big of an irreversible mistake he made!

Soon after, Luke Evans reveals he's no ordinary human after his wife is murdered in surprising gunky blood-squirting fashion (involving a butcher knife and a sudden forward jolt of the throat) and sets himself free to murder the entire gang!  Yes that's right- he ALONE goes out on a mission to make every single one of those criminals pay hard for what they'd done to his girl.  You're all gonna pay!

Throughout the entire first half of the film, Luke comes up with his own bag of twisted, methodical tricks to kill each one of those criminals as they hide like cowards in their homes scared to death to come inside for fear of Luke.  Honestly for a bunch of tough guys (and girls, many of which are really cute) they all suddenly change their act the moment they realize what kind of person they're dealing with.  Luke's not a person!  At least, I think they mention he's the undead or a ghost or something.  Never quite sure.  Either way he's out for revenge so look out!

The amount of blood is deliciously high with every single death.  I guess I should have known given the name of the movie that, well, you know.  Just read the name of the movie!  What does it say?  It certainly doesn't say Everybody Lives now does it?  But does everyone die?  Hmmm... Well to be honest without spoiling the ending, I'm surprised a certain someone died a couple minutes before the movie concludes.  I mean that particular person really should have lived given everything he or she's been through, don't you think?  I like the guy who gets his head chopped up just a *little* bit, haha!  Just enough to cause bleeding, but keeping him alive for the time being to allow him a special moment to spill his guts (no pun intended).  And the sound he makes while dying?  It turns my stomach since it sounds somewhat authentic.  What about Brodus Clay?  I thought he looked familiar but I wasn't sure it was him until I came online and did some google searching.  He's not exactly the brightest guy in the world and certainly not a survivor.

I'm really surprised Derek Magyar lives for the majority of the film given he's the type that usually dies early, but he IS perhaps the best actor in the movie.  He's very believable in his scumbag/criminal role.  Of course Luke Evans is magnificent as well.  Adelaide Clemens is unfortunately a not so good actor.  Yeah she's cute and yeah she has that innocent way about her that appeals to me, but I dunno, her emotions were never believable when she should have been expressing EXTREME DIRE fear.  Instead her voice shakes in a fake and unnatural kind of way like she sees a mouse in the corner of the room instead of totally freaking out (which is what she SHOULD have done).  The movie focuses on Adelaide quite a bit so it's impossible not to notice her acting abilities or lack of.  Still, she's cute and good enough for the role I suppose.  She's a key part of the movie anyway.

Otherwise, great movie!  You can't go wrong with violent deaths, blood gushing awesomeness in the night, pretty good acting from most of the cast, and a quality storyline.",1408665600,,4039,4.515862068965517

But this takes the art of killing to a new level and more importantly is that it is killing for a purpose. If you enjoy a movie where the bad guy meets someone that is worse than him, this is the movie for you. Horror movie acting is never good, but this is better than most.

It was a hard time rooting for anyone because they're all quite evil, but then you have a moment of softness every now and then for some and wished they would see it through the movie.

Interesting characters and storylines, and the four main females are great fun and act brilliantly. The locations are Hospitals, Motels, and assorted properties in quite remote wooded areas of Louisiana and this Bluray print copes really well with the occasional dark patches. The colors and blood colours are excellent. Very bloody and the violence is usually of the onscreen direct variety. The shower scene, although intercut with dialogue, is one of the better ones and quite Hitchcockian in its presentation and clarity.

This movie is rife with dishy indictments on the character of the perpetrator BUT it also is an amusing hint at the US relationship with its two enslaved World War opponents.

The perpetrator can be interpreted as some NEET shut-in fantasizing about what an awesome ninja he is and is capable of pulling off all these unbelievable scenarios (coincidentally, the Japanese director hired to shoot this script has claimed interest in making a ninja movie in the future) while undeserved compliments are thrown his way by attractive young women including the waitress' ""Very funny.""  Like Wolverine in Japan, this film relies heavily on the innate talent and ability to pull in the audience of its leading man.

The dialogue between the main character (or some murderous unattractive dork fantasizing in his bedroom about his ideal dating situation) and his two female victims is INCREDIBLE.  There's no express revelation that he is forcing the longer-trained one to act out a script of making him feel desired and fought over by more than one female but the scenes between Betty and Driver are AMAZING - very thoughtfully, incisively written.  I was thrilled - it was like having a very well prepared meal.

Why do they call it Joy Division?  Because if you don't smile and pretend to like your ""boyfriend,"" they kill you, feldhure, they kill you.  But actually, they always kill you once a fresher one is available hence  ""You know how these things turn out.""

Then, after reading, I thought...Oh, what do those nitwits know!  So I rented it cuz I needed to kill (pun) a couple hours and this seemed like a good way to accomplish that.

Sheesh!  Do you know any Sociopaths?  Well, watch this movie and be sure to stay aware of the expression on the face of the main character.  This guy knows how to act and if you are a fan of great actors...watch the movie.

I liked this movie.  It was entertaining and chilling at the same time.  The reason for the four stars, instead of five was because of the over-abundance of the red stuff.  It was pretty much overkill (pun).

We meet Thomas (Mathieu Amalric - `The Grand Budapest Hotel' and `Quantum of Solace') who is putting on an adaptation of a play about sado masochism in its highest arty form. He can't cast the main character and has given up for the day as all the wannabe's are useless.

Then in walks Vanda played by the superb Emmanuelle Seigner; she at first comes across as a bit inept and unprepared. But slowly she reveals more and more depth to herself and the character she is to play.

She convinces him to read for her and they start going through the play analyzing all of the nuances - especially the sexual connotations. Then fiction starts to blur with reality as they both immerse themselves in their characters.

This is like a stage play and indeed has been adapted from one - there are only the two characters and the whole thing takes place inside the theater. However, it is absolutely engrossing both actors put in mesmerizing performances and the sexual tension is palpable throughout as is the intrigue.

5772547,4,B00D3LA6M0,"Twisted, bloody and extremely entertaining thriller by the director of Midnight Meat Train and Versus.  The movie plays with viewer expectations in smart ways so it's probably best to go into the movie knowing as little about the plot as possible.  I will say that No One Lives is a spiritual cousin to the 1984 thriller The Hitcher, but with much more violence and a bigger body count.  Michelle Williams lookalike Adelaide Clemens (Silent Hill: Revelations) makes a strong impression as the plucky heroine and the rest of the cast is uniformly fine.  This is a lot more suspenseful and fun than most theatrical thrillers I've seen so far this year--the only one I can think of that's really comparable is You're Next.  If you don't have a problem with gore and violence and like thrillers this is very highly recommended.",1379203200,,823,4.808510638297872

5772549,3,B00D3LA6M0,"There are some intriguing elements to this film, though most of them overrun one another. Presented by WWE Films and from the director of The Midnight Meat Train, NO ONE LIVES has a cast of talented character actors: the very lovely Laura Ramsey, the always memorable Lee Tergesen, Gary Grubbs and genre-staple America Olivo. However, none of the actors are given the chance to shine due to a sore lack of character development. This movie felt more like a sequel than an introductory tale. The back story of Evans' ""Driver"" and the women in his life would have made for a far more interesting story, especially given the chemistry that existed between Luke Evans, Laura Ramsey and Adelaide Clemens, whose work I was previously unfamiliar with.

The gore is excessive and the cinematography unremarkable, serving only to dilute the stronger points of first-timer David Cohen's script and borrowing more than once from Ted Demme's Silence of the Lambs visuals. The script is chocked full of familiar catchphrases, which standout even more given the sparse amount of dialogue. The humor is occasional but works, thanks to the effortlessness Luke Evans conveys in the lead role and a well-choreographed, if not misplaced, ""chick fight"". I'd suggest this as a rental but viewers might wait a year or two in hopes that it becomes an Amazon Prime freebie.",1379116800,5,1349,4.995555555555556

5772559,1,B00D3LA6M0,Disappointing movie.  Makes no sense. It started out dumb and I thought I give a a little time -- the movie only got worse.,1377302400,3,123,4.125
5772560,5,B00D3LA6M0,"- Synopsis - If you've seen the trailer then you know basically the entire movies premise. A couple is driving down the road looking to 'relocate'. They stop for a night at a motel and get some dinner. While having dinner they are harassed by a member of this group of criminals before the leader stops him. Later on the couple is run off the road by the man who harassed them and kidnapped. Though at first the leader disagrees when finding out what has happened, he changes his mind soon enough. One of the bigger members of the group is threatening to torture the couple in a secluded location. Suddenly the lady takes her own life before anything can happen to the surprise of the torturer and dismay of her handcuffed lover. The man escapes his handcuffs and kills the torturer, showing a violent well trained side to him and sets out to get revenge on the rest of the group. But the couple have been hiding a terrible secret this entire time that will disturb even the ruthless criminals who kidnapped them. Thats just part of the plot. There are some more small subplots, but you'll just have to see the movie yourself to find out!

This movie caught me by surprise. Of course anyone who has seen the trailer knows that the twist of the movie is given away. Even the DVD/Blu Ray cover itself gives away the twist. This movie could have had a wider theatrical release and could have been more successful if the marketing was handled better. I feel like, if under the right marketing hands, the movie could have been just as financially successful as the WWE studios last horror movie ""The Call"". I initially thought this was going to be another mindless B movie from the mostly horrible films the WWE studios puts out. I was dead wrong. Even though what could have been one of the more interesting twists in recent horror movies was given away so carelessly, this movie still packs a decent punch. The Director is Ryuhei Kitamura. He directed his first American movie ""The Midnight Meat Train""(No it's not a porno) starring Bradley Cooper and based on a story by Clive Barker. That movie was visually stunning for the Horror genre and was a okay horror movie thanks to the ""Clive Barker"" aspect. Parts of this movie contain the visual cleverness of ""Midnight Meat Train"", but some parts do look a bit amateurish. Some say because it's supposed to pay homage to 70s Grindhouse movies. I bought this impulsively and decided to save money and just get the cheaper DVD, but now I kinda wish I had bought the Blu-Ray because I would like to have seen how some of the more visual scenes would have looked in HD. Like most horror movies, this is best viewed at night, literally.

The first 20 minutes are really good and tension filled. The middle part of the movie slightly goes a bit downhill in the horror aspect. The killer wasn't used to his full potential in some scenes and the editing seemed choppy at times. But it was still full of serial killer tension. Some of the dialogue from the less talented actors ruined some of the middle scenes, but it didn't turn into a disaster. The last 20 minutes is where the movie shines the most. It has action, killing, decent dialogue for a horror movie, a good ending, and a nice soundtrack similar to the Saw theme. The movie had decent horror movie music, but the final scene/credits is where the soundtrack really shines. I think the ending was clich, but very well done. Dexter fans, the last 20 minutes might remind you of that show a bit.

Luke Evans(Immortals, Fast and Furious 6) does a great job in his sociopath role. Some said he seemed wooden and couldn't act well. That was the way his character is supposed to seem. Wooden and awkward, yet charismatic! He plays a great psychopath! The only other notable performance is Adelaide Clemens(Silent Hill 2) who reminds me of Michelle Williams! She was nice in her ominous role. She is also very pretty. The rest of the cast are decent at best, but still better than B-movie standards.

I'm not saying this is better than recent horror movies like ""The Conjuring"", ""Insidious 1 and 2"", or ""You're Next"", but I still think this movie is better than most horror movies that get a wide theatrical release. It was definitely way better than the 2013 Texas Chainsaw Massacre! This had a theatrical run, but barely. ""No One Lives"" has the potential to become a horror cult classic. I hope that the DVD release will expand its audience! This is a good way to spend a boring night when you have nothing else to do. You don't have to buy it, but at least give it a rental. It is one of the better horror movies in recent memory truthfully.",1377129600,38,4635,4.54066985645933
5772561,4,B00D3LA6M0,I love twisted movie villains but most aren't worth the time it takes to watch them. This guy was right up there with the best. I have no use for professional wrestling or the idiots  that watch it but they hit one out of the park with this. Just plain fun to watch didn't have to hit fast forward once. If you like twisted done well this is for you. Hope there's a sequel with the same two main characters.,1377043200,,407,4.0875
5772562,2,B00D3LA6M0,"Low budget slasher movie that starts out dumb and actually manages to get dumber as the movie progresses. A bunch of thugs take a couple hostage, but unknown to them, is that one of their hostages is a serial killer, kidnapper, social experimenter, mad scientist with implantable glowing red balls, and some shapeshifting properties. If you watch this with the expectation of seeing something along the lines of ""Death Wish"", you will be very disappointed. However if you want something similar to ""Attack of the Killer Tomatoes"", then this movie might satisfy you.",1377043200,5,565,5.086021505376344

Hardcore action, blood, and gore all the way through. A group of career criminal thugs happen to cross paths with a real (Serial killer). The criminals make the deadly mistake of pissing him off, and he teaches all (roughnecks) a lesson they will (NOT) live to regret. A great story! Its stunning how well this movie was both written and produced. Its a (5) star movie hands down! There are NO flaws in this movie. It's shockingly good! Its pure entertainment and action all the way through. The sets, props, wardrobes, effects, and acting were spot on. The cinematography was very good. Every aspect of this movie was well managed;it was money well spent and my compliments to all producers involved. Luke Evans, the only (A-list) actor in this movie, carried it very well and gave a hardcore performance that only a seasoned actor could do. However, be warned, this movie is very gruesome and bloody, and the gore factor is very high! This movie is a true masterpiece, and I highly recommend purchase on Blu ray.
