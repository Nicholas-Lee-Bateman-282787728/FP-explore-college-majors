6257085,2,B00ICWO144,If any of you that saw the mini-series The Bible on the History Channel they have basicly taken parts of that 10 part series and combined it into this movie. But one scene that they did not show in this movie was the scene when Jesus is confronted by Satan and put through tests. They didn't show Satan because the actor that portrayed Satan looked like President Obama and did not want to cause any contraversary.,1399334400,,414,4.4605263157894735
6257086,5,B00ICWO144,This is a good movie to also watch with your small group or Bible study or at a church event!,1399248000,,93,3.7
6257087,5,B00ICWO144,"This movie is every bit as good as 'The Passion of the Christ' For starters, this movie was selected scenes from History Channel's 'The Bible miniseries' Unlike The Passion, this movie delves into Jesus's teachings and spreading the word of God, whereas The Passion just specified on how brutal and gory the Crucifixion was. Diogo Morgado was great as portraying Jesus Christ. You can tell he was very passionate in playing the role.

Jesus and his Disciples travel to cities to spread the word of God until the King believes that he's just a blasphemer. Jesus is crucified and dies for our sins. Hopefully, this movie will make you want to be a better person. I highly recommend SON OF GOD!!!",1399248000,3,693,4.7272727272727275
6257088,5,B00ICWO144,"I watched this movie and I had tears for the simplicity and spontaneous way the actor play the part of Jesus. That's how I think of Jesus, a wholeheart Master.

I see that the Blu-Ray version is 48 minutes longer than the DVD version, which means that those of us who don't own Blu-Ray players are once again being cheated.

6257090,5,B00ICWO144,"I, am totally amazed that someone would give this movie only 3 1/2 stars!! You, must be totally out of your mind.. I saw this movie at the show, and I thought it was an awesome movie.. I haven't seen the movie passion of the christ. Regardless of that fact. I donot see how this movie compares with that movie at all. All, I can honestly say here is shame on you for giving this movie only 3 1/3 stars. I gave this movie 5 stars because it is deserving of 5 stars. Next, time someone does a review of a movie or a cd, they should do their homework first. then, that way you will be better prepared to give a more honest review here.",1398384000,17,632,4.023809523809524
6257091,4,B00ICWO144,"As a Christian, and a movie fanatic, there are times (many times) when these two life choices don't exactly equate.  The snarkiness that is often a given when writing movie reviews may not be listed as a sin via the Ten Commandments, but sometimes it's just not...nice.  And Christians are nice people, for the most part.  This film, which was generally panned by critics and loved by audiences, suffers from the same duality.  SON OF GOD rated a dismal 23% likability by film critics on Rotten Tomatoes, while at the same time pulling down a sky high 82% likability by audiences, which just proves my point.  Movie reviewers hated it, audiences (I'm going out on a limb here and saying that most SON OF GOD audience members are Christians) loved it.  So as a Christian and a critic, where do I stand?  Pretty much in the middle.  I found SON OF GOD better than most of the critics believed, but not up to the near adoration of the public. A solid 3 and a half stars.

Am I setting this movie up then, for a snarky review?  Sort of, but not completely.  There are some very good things happening in SON OF GOD, but to find them you must sit through some silliness and more than a few liberties taken by filmmakers eager to pander to the public's thirst for a story told simply with beginning, middle, end, some blood and gore and very clearly defined good and bad guys.  The story of Jesus Christ is much, much more than this, but to tell it in the two hours that today's movies seldom surpass is impossible.  You've gotta cut corners, but SON OF GOD cuts more than a few.  Way more.

The film opens with a quick (and I mean QUICK) montage of the Old Testaments greatest hits;  Adam and Eve, Noah, Moses, Goliath and Abraham. That this film was cut from the much longer mini-series becomes fairly obvious here.  Next comes the similarly condensed version of the birth of Christ, after which the fully grown Jesus appears (the swoon inducing Diogo Morgado), ready to begin the true work of man's salvation, beginning with his plea to Peter the fisherman to become ""fishers of men"".  From here on in the road to Calvary is fast and furious, and it is here that my biggest issue with SON OF GOD occurs.  Many of the works of Christ, as well as the teachings of Christ, are glossed over, or ignored completely.  If you know the story of Christ, the teaching, the miracles, the parables, then this isn't too terrible.  We understand that the Lords Prayer is longer than one or two  sentences, that the beatitudes contain more than ""The meek shall inherit the Earth"".  But gone are so many of the works of Christ, his miracles, that if you are not well aware of the biblical stories in the New Testament, then you may very well wonder what all of the fuss was about.

So many of these glaring oversights are addressed with one or two sentences that it's a bit giggle inducing.  ""Do not doubt, Thomas"" and ""Where is Judas...have you seen him?"" are just a few of the examples of storylines brought down to their least common denominator with one sentence, implied but not addressed.  John the Baptist rates no more than a few seconds shown in a flashback, and the temptation of Christ by Satan is ignored completely (although the outcry over the resemblance between THE BIBLE's Satan and President Barak Obama may have something to do with this omission).  The period prior to the Palm Sunday entrance of Jesus on the back of a donkey is the weakest of SON OF GOD, but thankfully following this the film begins to finally gain steam.

The days leading to the Crucifixion are the backbone of SON OF GOD, and the best and most emotional moments fall within this section.  After Jesus enters Jerusalem on Palm Sunday, the film slows down it's breakneck narration to actually illustrate the events that led to the death of Christ. It's always interesting to see who gets the brunt of the blame for the Crucifixion of Christ in these bliblical films...will it be Pontius Pilate? The Jewish Temple leaders? Judas? The Roman Guardsman?  Every movie seems to point fingers at one group more than others, and in SON OF GOD the winner is Pilate, wonderfully played by Greg Hicks, who is portrayed as more psychopath than ruler.

While SON OF GOD doesn't even begin to touch the savagery of THE PASSION OF THE CHRIST, the brutality of the Crucifixion is present within SON OF GOD, and is troubling and difficult to watch (as it should be).  Morgado does his best work here as Jesus, able to drop the Colgate smile and finally ACT, for heaven's sake.  Roma Downey, however, is just awful as Mary, and she seems to do nothing more than look pleadingly (but still beautifully!) at Jesus in all of his agony, tears glistening on her lovely cheeks as she stretches her hand to her son.  As a mother, if I was watching one of my sons go through something like this, I would be screaming and frothing at the mouth.

SON OF GOD is a good, but not great film of the life and death of Jesus Christ.  That it is better at depicting the death of Jesus, in all of its misery and degradation, may be due simply to the belief that the public wants to see the torture more than the miracles.  But isn't the life of Christ, and his teachings, more important?  I think so, but I don't have millions to make a movie.  See the film, by all means, but remember how much more there is to the story of the Son of God than the tragedy of his death on the cross.  That, my friends, is the real good news.",1398384000,42,5460,4.459214501510574
6257092,3,B00ICWO144,"The film starts with some narration by John, whose gospel introduces the concept of the ""logos"" or ""The Word"" and equates this Greek theological idea to Jesus . It places Jesus with God the father from the beginning of time.

It jumps to a quick Matthew version of his birth and then to collecting apostles, making his first miracle being a human fish finder. Yes the Lord God creator and all being of time, space and dimension must stick his face into the water to locate fish. My LOL moment.

The movie introduces historical background, but does so briefly. The famous Sermon on the Mount, what I consider to be the inspirational center piece of Christianity is not used, save for The Lord's Prayer. Even ""Life of Brian"" did that aspect better...""Blessed are the cheese makers...""

The film nicely modernizes the King James version, even with the actors having varying accents. The film attempts to follow the story through the Gospel of John, which may be why they cut the sermon on the mount, but then they added other aspects that were not in John, but Matthew.

The production makes Jesus look like a cult leader with a rock star following. The last hour which concentrates on the Passion of Christ, I couldn't help but compare it mentally to the far superior Mel Gibson production. Indeed, in many ways this film isn't any better than some low budget church productions.

I liked the idea of opening with John. If they had made this film based strictly on the Gospel of John, they could of had a first. The story assumes we know the characters and never builds or develops them. The plot has wholes in it, like what was Pontius Pilate supposed to do with his wife's dream she considered a warning? Say, ""Okay Jesus off you go then."" Wouldn't that screw up everyone's salvation?

On the plus side Jesus Christ handled hecklers better than Chris Christie, but then, who doesn't? The film takes some dramatic liberties utilizing long ""William Shatner like"" pauses before Jesus says a line we know is coming. The scene of Judas ""returning"" the 30 pieces of silver, was nothing like what I imagined, my bad I guess.

I really loved the rock star Jesus for the first 30-45 minutes of the film. But the second half felt like they changed Jesus and not for the better.

3 1/2 stars",1398297600,,2280,4.626237623762377
6257093,5,B00ICWO144,"Although this was taken from The Bible Miniseries which aired last year on the History Channel, this does very well as a stand
 alone production. It's simple and straight forward .Some may quibble that it jumps from one scene to the next and doesn't spend enough time fleshing out details. For example in the raising of Lazarus, viewers should have been introduced to Mary, Martha and Lazarus prior to his death. Showed no connection to Jesus and the 12. Actual raising didn't have the impact it should have had. All in all Diogo Morgodo was an inspiring, compassionate Jesus and the rest of the cast did quite well. I think this will become an annual Easter classic.",1398297600,50,667,4.700854700854701

6257111,5,B00ICWO144,I am a Christian and find that this movie portrays the ministry of Jesus and his last days and the crucifixion very true to the Bible.

One of my favorite scenes in the movie is when Jesus finds Matthew the tax collector collecting taxes and tells the story of the Pharisee and the tax collector and as Matthew,who silently mimics the words with Jesus as Jesus is talking, that's because Jesus was there in the  Church temple when this was going on with that Pharisee and Matthew and also it was that Pharisee who was standing there...
With whom Jesus says,'And God blessed the tax collector... not the Pharisee!"" Then He tells Matthew to come with Him and the other apostles....I loved that part!!!",1524096000,2,687,4.585365853658536

6257116,2,B00ICWO144,"On the surface, the movie is an ok depiction of Jesus' ministry and maybe 6 months ago, I would have thoroughly enjoyed it. But the last few months of bible study completely ruined this movie for me lol I personally feel if you are going to do a movie on the books of the bible you should stick to what is recorded as much as possible, especially when it comes to what Jesus did/didn't say. I understand for purposes of time that they could only include but so much, but they excluded a lot of important dialogue, added dialogue that did not match what was recorded in the bible and many scenes were out of order. The scene where Jesus kissed the dead Lazarus to wake him up (who was said to be dead for 4 days in the bible-thus at the point of decomposing) definitely had me very perplexed. It may seem trivial but seemingly small things like this really bothered me, and I'm sure it would bother anybody else who is a stickler for biblical accuracy!",1522454400,,951,4.348314606741573
6257117,2,B00ICWO144,"The movie was appropriately reverent so that is good.  But, there were several scenes from the bible where the filmmakers' vision overrode the details actually recorded in the bible.

6257140,2,B00ICWO144,"Four fishermen- in the movie it only showed Peter in his boat.

Healing's- in the movie it only showed Jesus forgiving and healing the Paralytic, no other healing was shown.

Jesus walks on the sea- in the movie Peter did not ask Jesus to command him to come to Him on the water. They never climbed into the boat, nor did the wind cease. But the movie mad it appear as if Peter was dreaming all this.

Lazarus Raised from the Dead- was completely wrong in the movie. The only accuracy was that Lazarus was raised by Jesus, but the way it happened was far from Truth.

In the movie they had Jesus kissing everyone and everything, including a scroll (the book of the prophet Isaiah) when he was through reading scripture says that He sat back down and much more was spoke, but in the movie He leaves after reading the scripture.

Many Many inaccuracies. More than I have said in this review. So much of Jesus beautiful life missing. Could have been done so much better. I believe that we all need to study Gods Word, because there is inaccuracies in movies, tv shows, pastors sermons, OTHER Christian books, etcetera. But if we know the truth we will see the inaccuracies in these things and we will not be lead astray. I do not believe you will find a movie that does not have inaccuracies. Just didn't expect A movie about Jesus life to be sooo far from what actually happened. Very upsetting.

6257205,1,B00ICWO144,"First I would like to state that I am a true believer in Jesus Christ.  Second, here is what I think about the film:  While there were very few good pieces of cinematography (because some were taken from The Passion of the Christ as the makers of this movie didn't even take the time to come up with their own original cinematography), it didn't take very long during the film for me to realize that this movie was a comedy movie.  There were plenty of events that were clearly out of the right sequence and I ask myself ""how can this happen when there is already a book that specifies this very clearly.  It got to the point that made me question if the director(s) have actually read the gospels in the bible.  Very poor choice of inserted events; there was even a part where he is telling a kid that ""there will not be a stone left on this place,"" referring to the destruction of the temple and this was the part when I almost threw myself on the floor laughing.  The Bible clearly states who he was communicating with at that time, but it is also common sense that Jesus was not smiling to a kid at this time and that God is not going to make a kid understand that he is going to destroy the temple to symbolize his death.  The parts where Mary Magdalene appears in the midst of all the disciples was beyond ignorant, particularly when he was about to be arrested by the Romans.  What in the world was Mary Magdalene doing there???

At times I could have played a synchronized piece of the cinematography of The Passion of the Christ alongside this film - what a coincidence that when this and that happened, it perfectly matched The Passion of the Christ in a similar order with almost identical picture frames.  The makers of this movie were trying to make some quick $$$.  I don't even know why I continued watching this movie till the end.",1482883200,,1847,4.355685131195335

 Son of God traces the familiar story of Jesus Christ with drama and dignity.  This is the latest in many attempts to describe on film what certainly to Christians is the Greatest Story Ever Told.  Believers will recognize and emphasize with the story and I think will on the whole be satisfied with the film.  It nether trivializes the Deity, making him into some extra good Gandhi figure nor makes him into a magician of great skill.  Christ is a warm, loving human being and at the same time, He is God.

When this ""Jesus"" quoted the words of Jesus from the Bible they totally came alive and seemed loving, instead of angry or judgmental.

6257458,1,B00ICWO144,"Awful movie doesn't follow the scriptures, and has Jesus kissing the DEAD body of Lazarus in the tomb! Jesus fulfilled the LAW never BROKE the LAW. It was truly UNLAWFUL to kiss or touch a dead body. The leaders always accused him of violating the law, but it was their traditions and interpretations of the law. Even though he said its not what goes into a body that makes one unclean but what comes out of the heart, doesn't mean one can take this Liberal NON Scriptural view that he would kiss a dead corpse. Mind you the kissing was not an act of touching to raise him but in the movie he just kissing him first and then prays!  More important that was never in the Bible he called out to him from outside the tomb which is more powerful as he showed he had the authority to even command one to live again without touching.

Then there are many more things that don't follow the bible, there are MANY more movies that follow the life of Jesus that stay with the scriptures and are fun. Visual Bible series has Gospel of Mathew, and Acts of the Apostles, Gospel of John. All use word for word from the Bible using the NIV which is my pick for a bible version, but its still holy scripture and they show there is NO reason to add things that take away from the message and pervert the scriptures for the children and those who don't read their bible daily.",1447891200,16,1358,4.280155642023346

Son of God is a grandiose, high-profile production.

Many desire to know if it is true to the Bible as it claims, and rightly so.

For you to be discernibly tutored, many aspects must be investigated, including the character and motivation of its producers.

God declares in His Word that those who are involved in presenting the Word of God must be above reproach in every way and 100% faithful to Biblical truth. This includes owning a working knowledge of Bible texts.

Teachers must be separated from the ungodliness of this worldits questionable ways, philosophies, unholy activities, etc.

Various texts in the Bible are set before us to test if one is qualified to represent it.

Two key people we need to test for godliness are the producers, Roma Downey and her husband, Mark Burnett. Roma also plays Mary in this portrayal of the life of Christ.

To be forthright, Roma is a Catholic/new ager.

Roma and Mark are all about Hollywood, and are one with the stars of Hollywood, and boldly state so. Their entire lives are wrapped around this false glittering world of sin.

The couple stand with homosexuality and premarital sex. They lived together prior to marriage from all appearances. Hollywood tells their story, including the fact, they were married at their home. Also they were vacationing in Mexico when they became engaged.

Regarding their marriage, they were married by new ager Della Reese, who is one of Romas main spiritual advisers. Reese, in one of her new ager roles, appears in commercials for psychic community hotlines. She brims with all sorts of strange doctrines and prosperity beliefs, including the New Thought Movement that basically lets you get whatever you desire through thought requests.

She never seems to acknowledge Jesus Christ in any sincere and true way. Mostly, she addresses god or father who is not the Biblical God.

Reese does not believe in followers going through trials and problems, because existence is to only consist of a prosperous, good life. She never deals with sin or the word sin from what I have researched. It is about God being in everyone, just as Roma believes.

Reese's new age thinking emerges with voices focusing on all that we have regarding inside powers, which all good things emerge from.

Of course, being a Hollywood musical and acting legend, Reeses life was all about dressing sexy when she was young to sell herself. Being one with the big ranks was her lifeand still is. God commands Christians to come out and be separate, Reese represents the exact opposite.

******

This is Romas third marriage, and Marks second. God says adulterers and fornicators He will judge, but the marriage bed is undefiled. This entails a lifelong commitment to the marriage covenant; understanding a husband and wife are bound to each other as long as they live. (1 Corinthians 7:39) Of course, forgiveness of all sins can be found in Jesus Christ.

God also proclaims, the sexually immoral will be cast into the lake of fire. And God Almighty, who is all holiness, never lies. This is why men must recognize their sin and desire forgiveness through Christs shed blood to enter heaven. God can forgive all sin. Jesus Christ died for all of us wayward people. However, one must come to the Biblical Christ to be saved. He loves the weary and heavy laden and desires to grant them rest. (John 3:16-18 and Matthew 11:28 in the Bible)

Roma and Mark have no true Christian testimony of being washed from their sins by the shed blood of Jesus Christ. They appear to have very little problem with evil and any bad thing can be overcome with will power and the god within everyone.

Roma explains she has known Mary and Jesus all her life. Of course, this is the Catholic, idol Mary and false christ; the idolatrous deities of Catholic demonic, mysticism.

The true Jesus Christ is undefiled, separated from sinners and exalted above the heavens, and someday everyone will stand before His throne of judgment, acknowledging all judgment has been handed to the Son from the Father. (John 5:22 and Hebrews 7:26)

Roma attempts to sound Christian to recruit people into new age Catholicism. You can see she lists herself as Catholic in Wikipedia if you research her name.

She and her husband, unfortunately, run in the most conservative Christian circles when they desire. This allows them to have the backing of the most influential and famed Christians in America or so-called Christians. They do this to maintain conservative patrons, thus procuring momentous, mega bucks from believers and church attendees who do not know their Bibles, or do not care what Scripture exhorts.

Since Roma and Mark relish the Hollywood square, it is no wonder they adore President Obama. Obama stands for every vile way and has done all he can to remove rights of Christians, while ushering in complete perversion. He also ruthlessly applauds murdering babies before their birth, and soon after they are born, if unwanted. He lies to Americans with no conviction of wrongdoing, and his list of fraudulent plots marches on within his powerful reign. (I must add, Christians are exhorted by Scripture to pray for government leaders1 Timothy chapter 2. Above all, I believe, we need to intercede for their salvation and to perform God's will not their own.)

******

The previously celebrated, religious movie was the Passion of the Christ; and it too was crafted to recruit people into the devilish religion of Catholicism. Its director, Mel Gibson, being a Catholic, plotted to have Mary strangely glorified.

Roma is following in Gibsons footsteps, recruiting people into worshipping ""mother Mary."" And she uses this term as her role in the movie to plant idolatrous seeds. Mother Mary is how idolatrous Catholics pray liturgy to a being they believe is a perpetual (unending) virgin, and is mother god.

The actual Biblical Mary had other children, after Jesus, as the Bible explains. She was only kept a virgin till the birth of Christ, upon which, she and Joseph engaged in natural marriage. Two of their five sons (Matthew 13:55), James and Jude wrote two books in the New Testament. Humbly, they did not set themselves above other believers, and rightly so.

Mark 3:31-35 clarifies the Biblical Mary in this regard: And His mother and His brothers came, and standing outside, they sent to Jesus and called him. And a crowd was sitting around Him, and they said to Him, Your mother and your brothers are outside, seeking you. And He answered them, Who are my mother and my brothers? And looking about at those who sat around Him, He said, Here is my mother and my brothers! For whoever does the will of God, he is my brother and sister and mother.

******

Roma talks about feeling herself levitate in her new age sphere and Mark is in full-hearted agreement with this demonic activity. This exposes the fact, demons have ahold of her being, and no doubt, influence Mark.

Roma has appeared on television with psychic, Jonathan Edward, where she has reportedly talked to her deceased mother. (Though this would not be her mother but a demon, knowing a persons soul does not remain on the earth, whether hell or heaven bound.) Such a practice is called necromancy, which is a witchcraft practice, and forbidden in the Bible. This is demonic communication. Anyone who engaged in demonic communications in the Old Testament was to be executed in punishment by Gods judgment.

Roma also believes in female angels and appears to believe in children angels as well. She has penned a childrens story line on children who are little angels.

There are only mature male angels in Scripture and the Bible does not lie. Angels were formed countless years before a female ever appeared on the earth, or a child.

Roma can appear most strange in her words, using common Christian clichs when needed to sound evangelical. She never comes across as totally sincere from what I have noticed in web video clips.

What is also unnerving, is this lady can dress like a whore and talk about Christianity, as if this all is normal.

******

Let us now consider another key component to this film, Diogo Morgado, who plays a handsome, charismatic christ; all to the pleasure of the sensual flesh, which relishes gazing upon the captivating.

Gods Word warns, the heart of a person is what is important, not the outward appearance.

Hollywood refers to Diogo Morgado as a hot Jesus, and Morgado delights in this title. This is all blasphemous beyond belief, in the most improprietous sense. However, this is how the producers designed it to be, to usher in countless greenbacks.

Sensuality is forbidden in the Bible and is addressed as an evil fruit of the flesh. Men and women are to look at one another in all purity. Men are to look at women as sisters in all purity. And women are responsible to dress in shamefacednessin bashfulness towards men and in the fear of God.

This popular, posted comment is also reprehensible knowing Jesus Christ held no fleshly appearance that would draw men to His outward self. (Isaiah 53:2) And the true Christ certainly did not come across hippie-like, as the antichrist in this movie.

What is most perverse is Diogo Morgado is living in a state of fornication, living with a gal out of wedlock. He does pornography shots; yet, attempts to sound religious. Is it any wonder that Roma and Mark adore this man?

Imprudence does not stop here regarding this antichrist Jesus. Roma and Mark have fine tuned him the best they can to sell him as a Christian. However, he lets it be known, his coming movies are completely different in story line.

******

Son of God is an epic production in the eyes of Catholic and Christian; and is causing many people to get rich. Side items are also being sold to increase the pocketbooks of 20th Century Fox, Roma and Mark, and others.

Let us probe Fox within a paragraph. This mega corporation recently fired a newscaster for being pro natural family and not pro homosexuality. Fox is not known to promote modesty, prudishness and chastity. Rupert Murdoch, owner of Fox, is a Catholic who appears to own few morals.

******

Let us consider outside movie promoters which include Rick Warren, Focus on the Family, Max Lucado, Joel Osteen, Pat Robertson, Della Reese. Oh, and I cannot forget Oprah, a good friend of Romas, who supports every evil thing and is known to be a lesbian.

The list of strategists for this monstrosity of a movie, appears to be endless; all are positioned to catch and deceive.

One movie promotion link:
http://sonofgodresources.com/leader-commentaries

(You must scroll to the bottom to view all these promoters.)

Naturally, none of the flicks endorsers address the lies, false doctrines, mysticism, motivation, etc, that hides behind this silver screen gilding. Of course not! Their doctrines are full of lies as well. Their religion is ecumenical, the religion of todays apostate church. And who knows how much of a kickback they might receive under the table and for showing their face.

The so-called Christian theologians certainly shame themselves in their Bible illiteracy, not even able to address the obvious, blaring lies.

God commands every Christian leader to know the Scriptures thoroughly.

******

During the Revelation apocalypse, the planet will be encased in a one world religion. This is what famed religious leaders are promoting today. The Bible states the apostasy (abandonment of the true Biblical faith) must arrive first, and this apostasy continues until Christ returns to rule the earth from Jerusalem.

******

Besides the above link with advocators, you have a website that orchestrates more Catholics weighing in under the direction of the movies creators.

One such person, an agent of satan, is Cardinal Wuel. He is sat before the public to promote Catholicism and to reveal the Catholic content of Son of God:

http://www.historyvshollywood.com/video/son-of-god-peter-goes-fishing-scene/

Catholics believe Peter was their first pope so this movie leaves out Andrew, Peters brother, at the calling of being a disciple. Both were called at the same time to leave their nets and follow Christ; Matthew 4:18f. Progressing in this passage, you read of James and John, being summoned to follow as well.

The movie also misrepresents truth when the anti-jesus states, they will change the world. The Bible never speaks this, nor does it voice, that Christ said to Peter, Just give me an hour of your time and I will give you a whole new life.

You also have the movie scene of the nets being hauled in by Peter that are full of fish by a miracle of Christ; yet, the net never breaks as the Bible records. Plus, the movie only shows Peter with Jesus in the boat when this miracle occurs. However, it was Peters commercial fishing boat and others were working too. Peter tells Christ to depart from him (he being a sinful man), when he comes face to face with the holy One. This is not exposed in the depiction.

James and John, who were partners with Peter, were also present at the fish netting miracle. At this time, the LORD Jesus Christ tells Peter, that he will be a fisher of men.

The Catholic cardinal states, this is all taken from the Bible; well, a great deal is not. Catholics have no problem lying to recruit, as I have learned personally.

Also, this movie's fishing segment is demonically mystical regarding the false Jesus preparing the fish catch, though not shown in this particular clip review, but is in the trailer.

It is unbelievable that Christians would accept as truth what is made to be strange magic, that of an unfamiliar spirit!

Also on this webpage, you have Joel Osteen, who reviews the storm scene, which includes Mary being in the boat, an outrageous lie of satan who always wants to rewrite the Word of God. This scene too has a miracle performed in a blasphemous, mystical way. (The true account is located in Mark chapter 4.)

Does Osteen correct this mysticism and false doctrine? Of course, not. He is all about lies that include a contrived prosperity Gospel, which arises from the pit of hell. It is no surprise that this ecumenical man and his wife are friends of Roma and Mark.

Regarding the productions content, it has been rightly declared, this movie is to please all, including feminists through Marys forthright and bold ways. Of course, the Mary of the Bible held a quiet, gentle, and submissive spirit, holding no acclaimed aspirations within womens lib.

She did not appear most everywhere with Christ and the disciples, as the movie places her. She was not the thirteenth disciple!

On the same webpage of the fisherman review, you have a video link to a Catholic archbishop who weighs in too. Of course, Catholics desire to appear Christian in adherence with many of the cults we have today. It is all about deceiving and sending the Biblically uneducated to hell; all part and parcel with satans rulebook.

Catholics certainly view this movie as a good work toward salvation. They do not believe in salvation through grace, receiving the Christ of the Bible as ones personal Savior. They think they are good enough to make it on their own efforts, no matter their inward filthiness.

It is far far better to read a Bible of a good translation, and obtain truth from God directly, and not from Catholic mystics.

Looking at the Bible, there is no other book whereby the author will come and be with you as you read, and in the most discerning, Holy Spirit filled way.

Everyone has sinned and falls short of Gods glory (Romans 3:23), and can only receive eternal life in heaven by calling on Jesus Christ of the Holy Bible, not by watching a movie about God or anything, anyone would consider a religious act. Every human being requires a holy Savior, the One who hates all sin that leads to death. (Romans 6:23)

******

More to consider within the film frame:

The Scriptures never state Jesus smiled nor laughed, because it is not important, though this movie seems to make it terribly important. We do know Jesus wept and this is significant, because it is recorded in the Word of God. He grieved over the sinfulness of men and their rejection of Himthe only One who can save from sin.

The only place we see God laugh in Scripture is when He laughs in judgement over those who reject Him in the tribulation or last days, before they are cast into the lake of fire for their hatred of the Savior. God will break them with a rod of iron and dash them into pieces. (Psalm chapter 2)

This flower-child like, movie star antichrist displays many arrogant, pompous looks as does the majority of Hollywood entertainers. Christ never displayed an arrogant look. God hates a proud look! (Proverbs 6:16-17)

Arrogance is forbidden in the Scriptures and Christ walked in all lowliness of person, though with righteous, commanding power. All the fullness of the Godhead dwells in Christ in bodily form, and He is the head over all principalities and power. (Colossians 2:9-10)

Also consider, Christ never posed before an artist. No art pieces of him were to be made and preserved. No one knows the appearance of Christ from this period! All works of art are a lie regarding how Christ or anyone else appeared.

It is oddly strange, that such artworks are endless. Religious artisans even believe their lying likenesses are true to form no matter how many types of Jesus and Mary renderings are produced. Absolutely ridiculous! Much currency is manufactured and the artisans naturally enjoy this fact.

This is akin to what we read in Acts chapter 19, regarding merchants making money from idol artworks. The merchants hated Paul because he exposed that statues were not gods at all and were not to be worshipped!

The sellers felt the effects of now losing money and they ruthlessly attacked Paul.

(Many true believers in Christ have been murdered by Catholics and other idolatrous followers over the centuries for this same disclosure.)

Of course, idols of all religions pull in the dough, and just think of all the crosses that gross money.
Today, discerning Christians are being ridiculed from all corners for not standing with this movie of money, and its idol Jesus.

******

Regarding how Christ appears now, we do know He has white hair, as white as snow. His eyes are a flame of fire, and His feet are like bronze, as if burned in a furnace. He has a long robe with a gold sash. And a two-edged sword extends from His mouth to reveal He is a God of judgment. (Revelation chapter 1)

Additionally, the Bible tells us we no longer know Christ after the flesh. (2 Corinthians 5:16)

******

Other lies are presented with the raising of Lazarus of Bethany. (John chapter 11) Jesus knew all the time Lazarus had died and was not surprised as the movie attempts to portray. Jesus Christ is omniscient (all-knowing) and all omnipotent (all-powerful), and therefore, could and did raise Lazarus when he called upon His heavenly Father.

Jesus did not go into the tomb as the movie depicts, nor does it say Jesus gave him a strange kiss in the tomb (very questionable in presentation).

In truth, Christ called out to Lazarus to come forth and Lazarus did, still bound in grave-clothes.
Martha and Jesus did not enter the tomb together and then all three emerge to the happy cries of an awaiting crowd of spectators.

Due to this resurrection miracle, the religious leaders sought even more to put Christ to death and also desired that Lazarus be put to death as well (John 12:10). These were murdering, cunning Jews who could never be placed in a good light! From what I understand, the movie tries to tie some goodness to the Sadducee and Pharisee religious sects. How unbelievable!

******

Another item of interest, which viewers have observed, is the fact Judas is made to be a victim by Christ to betray Him. This is blasphemy to the hilt!

Judas the betrayer, is a son of perdition or a son of hell (John 17:2), rightly designated by God Almighty! He was satans child and satans children attempt to justify Judas.

Judas was a wolf of a man; one who stole from the money box for his own prosperity ... a man of greed. He was an actor who portrayed a righteous man in order to deceive and take all he could from the Savior and His ministry.

Also the kiss that Judas gives Jesus in the film is homosexual-like. A kiss of Hollywood vileness that makes your heart sick.

The Bible teaches, all the deep rooted sins within Judas drove him to betray Christ in a murder driven way. Psalm 109, verses 6 and following, in the Old Testament, is a prophecy Psalm of exposure, referencing this despicable man, who became cursed of God and his family.

Judgment says, Let his days be few and let another take his office. Let his children be fatherless, beggars, and their seed cut off, and his wife made a widow.

Acts chapter 1 also exposes the character of Judas, which declares he was a guide to those who removed the Savior; and he rightly died, seeing his bowls gushed out.

Another dubious lie to those who know the Scriptures, is the crying out of Mary, Let Him be, when Jesus is arrested and beaten.

The false Catholic mother Mary is always guarding Jesus, and is inseparable.

Catholicism, New Age, Hinduism, Buddhism, all provide glimpses into Mystery Babylon that will appear in the tribulation, in all its idolatrous vileness. Idol worship will prevail everywhere as I have addressed in my book, Revelation the Explanation:Revelation the Explanation Book (Part 1)

True believers know they can obtain holy, superior truth by sitting down and reading the Bible for two hours, as opposed to driving to a theatre to glue the eyes to a silver screen, upon which the Word of God is added to, subtracted from and blasphemed.

******
Hollywood is a harlot and a producer of lies, rarely substantiated truth.

Christians are called to dwell only on truth, not that which is manufactured in the mind.

Unfortunately, despite all the movies flaws, Christians still say, It will draw people to Christ. I say God does not need this blasphemous movie to draw men to Himself. He can cause the stones to cry out a correct Gospel that adds no extra words or actions, nor subtracts them. Nor does He require mysticism to save men.

Having all virtuous Christians in America going door to door with the true Gospel of salvation would accomplish great things. Christians must continue to pray for more to enter Gods harvest. This includes supplications to God, to raise up godly men to street preach in populated locations to those who have never heard of the saving love of Christ. Most people need to hear the unadulterated Gospel. We must stay on the right tract and not deviate to the worlds entertaining deceptions.

True love equals all truthColossians 1:9-14,

6257561,3,B00ICWO144,"The costumes, sets, and casting are quite well done.  However, the character of Jesus seemed a little weak to me.  I would encourage anyone interested in this movie to read the Gospels first.  What will become very apparent by such an effort is that Jesus, the Son of God, is in complete command in the biblical account.  Jesus, after all, was and is God in human flesh. In understanding this, it becomes hard to reconcile the weak performance of Jesus in the movie.

Recognizing that it is extremely difficult to tell the story of Jesus ministry in a mere 2 hours, the movie still seems lacking in giving an accurate account.  For example, Mary, the sister of Martha, although a key figure in Jesus ministry, was not a traveling companion of the 12 apostles, nor was she present at the Last Supper.  However, the screen play virtually makes her a 13th apostle as she is in almost every scene.  This is not her character as told in the Gospels.

There are other major errors in the movie such as the events surrounding the raising of Lazarus from the dead, the events at the last supper, the arrest of Jesus in the garden of Gethsemane, the taking of Jesus body down from the cross, and the washing of Jesus body in the tomb.
Again, it is difficult to tell the story of Jesus on screen, but I felt that the richness of the biblical account was ignored in many cases, in favor of movie making convenience.  However, even in the face of these criticisms, I think it is a movie worth watching.  Read the Gospels, watch the movie, then read the Gospels again; cinema is no substitute for substance.",1438214400,,1594,4.5

6257617,5,B00ICWO144,"The dramatic, biblical saga of THE BIBLE/Mini-Series phenomenon continues, in this sequel film: SON OF GOD. The third being: A.D.-THE BIBLE CONTINUES. Each sold separately. This second of three - Old and New Testament films, focuses on Jesus the Anointed, Risen Christ, in accordance to the New Testament Gospels of: Matthew, Mark, Luke and John. It is a good movie which was done in such a way, that from start to finish, it is a full-length movie..., in and of itself. Meaning, you don't necessary have to watch Part 1- THE BIBLE, in order to understand and appreciate what's going on in this Part 2- SON OF GOD, movie. The husband and wife team of Mark Burnett and Actress Roma Downey (Touched By An Angel), bring the SON OF GOD story to you, on this single DVD disc, as you have never since Him depicted, before. The supremely handsome Actor - Diogo Morgado in the title role, leads the cast of hundreds, in order to bring Holy Scripture - as it was written by the inspiration of God, to the big-screen (II Timothy 3:16). Meaning, very little theatrical license was taken. It is therefore, spiritually and historically accurate. It comes complete with a lot of Special Features, including: 'Faith in Practice' and SON OF GOD-'Reborn from the Set.' This is a film which you will want to watch more than once. Why? Well, if anything, to reaffirm your faith. Secondly, to strengthen that faith which may be the size of a tiny mustard seed (Matthew 13:31-32 KJV). Thirdly, to spiritually educate you, a friend or loved one. And lastly, simply put... to entertain you. It is, after all, a movie! All in all, an appealing film for both Christians and non, alike. And a wholesome addition to your home or church DVD library. Nina Kish",1430697600,,1731,4.678688524590164

We rented it so we could introduce our 3, 7 and 10 year olds to the Jesus ministry, the crucifixion, and the resurrection. We do not attend church so they have only had basic Christian exposure and their Easter education is mostly rabbits and candy. I thought the show was really well done. They did a good job showing the progress of Jesus's ministry and showing the many powers at play leading to the crucifixion.....Ah, the crucifixion...while this isn't The Passion by Mel Gibson, it also doesn't shy away from the gruesomeness which is the death of Jesus. We were a little surprised at the graphic depiction (we assumed it would be ""family friendly"" whatever that means), but our kids really got a lot from watching his suffering. The violence (IMO) wasn't gratuitous...It added to the story and to the sadness of the death of Jesus. The movie sparked a lot of questions which is what we wanted.",1429228800,35,1055,4.587301587301587

6257665,3,B00ICWO144,"When I began watching the movie, I was thinking that this film was going to get a one star from me because so many things about the life of Jesus's ministry (especially the events at the beginning of his work) were left out and not referenced.  However, if you stay and watch the credits, it shows several scenes (such as His baptism) that were not shown, but were included as a type of appendices.  I only gave this movie three stars because I felt it left out key points to Jesus's ministry, especially his fasting in the wilderness.  I already know why they left it out, as I heard the producers talking about this in social media.  However, I thought it skipped a very important part of the beginning of His work.  Also, too many events seemed to have been blended as opposed to how they are read in scripture, especially His quotes and where they took place in the movie vs. in the Bible.

One thing I have noticed about modern day Jesus films - as opposed to earlier versions - is that modern day producers are hesitant to allow their Jesus actors to show real anger in scenes such as Christ tipping over the money changers' tables.  In this version, as well as other modern day ones, Jesus looks more worried and distraught than angered.  The Bible teaches us that he not only turned over the tables, but made a whip and ran the transgressors out.  I don't think he was doing this from the emotion of sadness.  He was angry because of their underhanded sales practices as they ripped people off while selling the sacrificial animals.  Why are producers afraid to show their Jesus with anger?  The Bible clearly speaks of God's righteous anger.  Why are people afraid that showing Jesus as angry will overshadow God's love and mercy?  In fact, Ephesians 4:26 says ""Be angry and do not sin...""  I guess they are afraid they will offend people?  Read the Bible and you can see that Christ is not only loving and kind, but he also was passionate, even angry (in a righteous way) when people, who called themselves Holy, disregarded the Law and made God's work the work of men.  Besides all of that, I did not like that they basically made Pilate's wife ""topless"" as he spoke with her about her dream (she was covering her front side up with a sheet, but her bare shoulders and arms showed).  I thought that was unnecessary as this movie appeals to a young audience as well.  Why expose them to a tempting thought when it is completely unnecessary?  One other thing that stood out to me, the raising of Lazarus was not portrayed at all in this movie like what the Bible account gives.  The producers/director really missed a great opportunity here, in my opinion.  If they had stayed with the Biblical account, this scene could have been one that people would have walked away talking about.  However, in the movie, it was a ""quiet"" miracle that didn't cause much awe from the observers in the film.

On the good side, I did like Diogo's acting.  He played the part well according to the script that was given him.  His work gave you (what I believe is a realistic view) a Jesus who had a sense of humor, showed heartfelt compassion, and was steadfast in his ministry.  I know many older movies tend to portray Jesus as always serious.  I think He behaved the same way any person would, that includes having a sense of humor.  However, we all know that he was the bravest man who ever lived.

There wasn't anything that I recall that was so ""far away from scripture"" that it was dangerous for a non-believer, or a young Christian, to see (unlike some of the more recent ""Bible related"" movies), but I was a bit disappointed for the reasons mentioned above.  I think it deserves a three, no more, no less.",1428364800,5,3706,4.494768310911809

But how can any movie convey years with power and accuracy of such an event?  It's like taking a photo of a majestic mountain; when seen later, it has lost it's raw power. Saying that, I found it a great and uplifting movie. Very enjoyable to remind us of what we already know and love about the story. A great start for further discussion. This movie can be the spark for a beginning of a lifelong journey. Another movie, ""The Passion of the Christ"" took only a Biblical chapter and thus could convey some of the power and develop details and characters. Enjoy Son of God and let it's story speak to you.

6257744,5,B00ICWO144,"Although this movie was based on ""The Bible"" miniseries that came out earlier and it has some of the same footage as that miniseries, it is nonetheless very well done, IMO.  Very nice to see a modern film about Jesus - one that wasn't done in the 1950s.  The acting in this movie was well done, and in particular the actor who played Jesus did an outstanding job.  Whether the actor's skin was the same color as the skin of Jesus is irrelevant, even though some people may try to argue otherwise.  If you read ""the Book"" first, you know the plot of the movie -- haha -- but it's one that is of the utmost importance to all mankind.  The movie will be very well received by Christians, I think, and is great for Evangelization.  At times this movie is very gripping and awe-inspiring.  The best part about it is that it represents real events, and a real Son of God who is alive today and calls us to follow Him.  People who think it is okay to be spiritual, but not religious, or that it's okay to follow tenets of various religions but to disregard Jesus' teachings, should keep in mind what Jesus said in John 14:6 -- ""I am the way, and the truth, and the life; no one comes to the Father, but by me.""",1424476800,15,1203,4.222707423580786

6257747,5,B00ICWO144,"Themes: Jesus was the Son of Man. Cultural aspects were in line with Catholic tradition. Main theme was the Kingdom of God and that Jesus was the Messiah to bring about the Kingdom of God. Jesus is merciful, friend to the poor, has great compassion and love for the people.
Purpose for the audience: To show that Jesus was God in the flesh who came to dwell with us. It demonstrates that Jesus was for all people and not just the Jews. It also brought in the idea that Mary and Jesus knew his mission and fate all along.
Historical prospective: The movie follows St. John very closely, but does not give the whole account of his ministry. Clearly demonstrates the brutality of Roman rule. People are oppressed and occupied and if anyone spoke against them they were killed. It showed the soldiers moving a cart out of Pilates path that killed a boy on it. It also demonstrates the Pharisees plan to stop him from interfering with the Passover and the great length sought to discredit Jesus.

Cheap production - it looks like an extended ""History Channel"" show, just missing the narration.  Check out the long shots of Jerusalem - not a person in sight.  The actor who plays Jesus is lame - simpering looks, wooden acting, monotone line delivery.  Some scenes are laughable - the storm at sea & the water walk are really cheesy.

The sword-and-sandals aspect has been cut out, because the movie focuses solely on Yeshua ben Miriam and his ministry; but if you liked the miniseries, you should enjoy ""Son of God"". Judging by the other reviews, the movie is poor on religious messages (I wouldn't know...not Christian); but to me, the scenery, the costumes and the talent of the actors are the most important parts--and ""Son of God"" has all three in spades.

Mother Mary is largely out of the picture after Christ's birth. Mary Magdalene appears as a member of the core group of disciples and balances the mostly male cast by admonishing Peter, asking Jesus questions about his teachings, and blatantly confronting him in the feeding of the 5000 scene, telling him that the people are starving and that something must be done. The story is told from disciple John's POV. Jesus's closest relationship seems to be with Peter. Martha and Lazarus appear in the timeline. Very little emphasis on background, extensive emphasis on personalities. Jesus appears utterly confident in one scene and compelled but bewildered in the next. Excellent performance by most of the actors except for the priest who continuously harasses Jesus. The movie started to remind me of Robin Hood versus the Sheriff of Nottingham after a while.

There are many films that have been made on the life of Jesus and I have watched several. This particular movie left me with much positive contemplation about the impact of Jesus as a human, able to connect with others yet remained set apart but without religious indifference.
Intelligent portrayal. Inspiring. Beautifully done. Worth watching.",1421020800,,537,4.977777777777778

The only little down side, if there was something, is Mary (mother of Jesus), because the actor looks like if she try too many plastic surgery in her face, but not a big deal.

6257838,3,B00ICWO144,"This movie is very pretty. Diogo Morgado is a beautiful looking Jesus, Darwin Shaw is a sexy beast as Simon Peter, and Roma Downey is an adequate and age appropriate Mary. Sebastian Knapp was tender and soulful as John. The three minute clip where we see Said Bey as the tax collector in the Calling of Matthew is not only the best part of this movie but of the whole The Bible series. So, this is the good part.
The bad is that Jesus is far less interesting and charismatic than He is in the actual Gospels. It is hard to believe this Jesus is divine since he is constantly shocked and surprised. We are given the importance of Baptism in his conversation with Nicodemus but the Last Supper is very cursory. We are constantly told about peace and forgiveness and a ""different way"" but we never see the importance of God and sinner reconciled. I particularly was disappointed when doubting Thomas sees the Lord but he did not reply ""My Lord and my God."" That is very important theologically. Mary Magdalene's part is greatly expanded and it comes across as a cheap PC play to ""modernize"" the story.
The casting, the costumes, and the cinematography are all gorgeous. I understand that poetic license must be taken in a movie. The Calling of Matthew was a brilliant example of that being well done. But overall, as a believer, this movie for me is a pale shadow of the real Jesus and the real Gospel.",1419120000,4,1399,4.511811023622047
6257839,2,B00ICWO144,"I was disappointed in this movie. It was not accurate to the gospels and left out core tenants of the faith. This is not an accurate retelling of the gospel.

6257909,5,B00ICWO144,"The ""Son of God"" is a wonderful movie that depicts the life of Jesus Christ, who showed us his love and compassion to bring salvation to mankind. The story, which is according to Gospel of John, brings out many messages that shows how much Jesus loves us with his passion and willingness to forgive:

- Calling of Matthew:  Matthew was shameful about his job as a tax collector. Jesus had listened to his prayer and confession at the church and he called out Matthew to become one of his disciples. Jesus's great love has enabled us to convert our lives and to become a better person regardless of who we were before.

- Forgiving the woman about to be stoned:  Jesus realized the woman was repentant for her sins and was willing to give her a second chance to live. He also reminded people not to condemn others, as only God has the authority to do so.

- Restoring life of Lazarus:  Jesus was joyful in seeing his dear friend Lazarus back to life. But realizing that his time of suffering was coming closer, he mourned over those who chose not to believe in him even though they had seen his miracles. He felt that those people were blind and their hearts made of stone. At the same time, he told his disciples that whoever followed him would see life in resurrection.

- Feeding thousands of hungry people:  The followers were satisfied with the food that Jesus has provided and wanted to proclaim him as King who would restore the nation. Knowing that he had to follow his father's plan and die of humility, Jesus refused to be honored and went on to do God's work.

- Message about the temple in Jerusalem:  Seeing that the temple has been turned from a house of worship into a marketplace for merchants, Jesus showed grievance among the crowd, as he saw that the people's relationship with God has changed. He was also sorrowful to foresee that this particular temple would be destroyed in the future. Lesson: are we also turning our temple in our heart (supposedly reserved for God) into something different?

- Promise of bringing the prisoner to paradise:  Jesus showed his compassion for us by dying on the cross and giving up his body and blood so that all our sins are forgiven. One of the two prisoners alongside him had confessed his sins before he died and recognized Jesus never committed any sins. Jesus promised to him that he would bring him to paradise the same day. For the same reason, we would enter heaven if we repent and accept God's mercy. His mission was to show us the path to light and save us from being a slavery to death. Thanks be to God",1415059200,2,2571,4.493562231759657

The Bible min-series was around 8 hours long and included stories from the old and new testament. Son of God is reduced to two hours and focuses primarily on the New Testament's Gospel of John. It is a wonderful film. I enjoyed it better than the Passion of the Christ, since this doesn't have as much blood and gore hence the Pg-13 rating. The production company did a fantastic job. The actors were great and the score is fantastic. Diogo Morgado who plays Jesus is very talented.

6257959,2,B00ICWO144,"An ok drama, but not enough based on scripture, with too much paraprashing of what Christ actually said, and much of what He said missing. Far too much scripturally unfounded drama was added, such as the scene of Pilate striking a soldier across the chest with his sword in what appeared to be a physical workout for him. Why was that even there? What a waste. Christ had so much good to say and did so much good that was not included in this movie, so let's distract us from the real message here by showing Pilate working out in a savage manner. What a senseless scene to me.
  Anyone who has seen this movie is likely to have seen the movie 'The Passion of Christ', so we didn't need another long drawn out Passion drama. For a movie called 'Son of God', it did not spend nearly enough time showing us how Christ actually demonstrated the infinite love of our Father in Heaven.

The scenes of the crucifixion are hard to watch, but it's very realistic and shows man's inhumanity to man in very graphic ways.  Very timely, as the teachings of Jesus are so distorted these days. The peace and love that Jesus radiates throughout, even on the cross, is a reminder of what real life is and how people might feel inside if they chose to love and be tolerant of others, including, and especially, the poor, instead of hating and mocking them.",1412208000,,574,4.607843137254902

6258002,5,B00ICWO144,"I myself am a Christian.  But admit that until the last few years was lost and believed in what I was taught by society.  If there is honestly anyone who watches this movie and can not feel something after or during watching this movie all I can say is I hope you one day try again and continue to try until you do see what the truth has always been.  The truth that even I did not see or believe in until recently.  The actor who portrays the ""Son Of God"" in this movie had a way of just getting to me by the way he was able to portray what our God did then and what he also was capable of doing.  This movie was not one that I was going to purchase, but I will say that I am so happy and full of love just from my transformation that has taken place.  I know a lot of people don't believe in any of this, or just did not like this movie.  I just want to say that we all need to realize that no one can honestly say they are not a sinner, but what you can say is that you are living right now on earth because of a man, a son, who chose to forgive people who were not even yet born from their sins that would be made years after he died so that our world would be a better one.  That is the amount of faith he wanted us all to have and he had the hope that we would become better people.  I have already known this, and knowing it more now, is helping me not just realize that a man who did not even know me, wanted to forgive me so that I would help in making a world full of chaos and fear a place full of love, faith, belief, and peace.  This is the journey I am now on and hope to find more people like myself on the same journey.",1411344000,2,1635,3.754385964912281

6258009,4,B00ICWO144,"I never saw any of the TV broadcast of The Bible mini-series, so the film was new to me and I have no complaint on that count.  On the whole this was a solidly-made, well-acted and well-written adaptation of the Gospel accounts.  My number one praise of course is that it doesn't water down or cover over the plain historical record of who Jesus was & is -- none of that ""great human teacher"" nonsense here.  Other standout positives include Judas' motive for his betrayal; it's very believable to have Judas sitting on the fence between the concerns of this world and the hope of the one to come.  And the characterization of Pilate is by far the most realistic I've seen yet.  Granted, what we see of him in the Gospels can make him come across as a weak-willed appeaser... but people like that didn't exactly rise to high places in the Roman Empire.  This movie gives us a Pilate that you don't dare cross or screw around with. He sends Jesus to the cross not out of cowering timidity, but brutally pragmatic apathy.  ""They'll forget about him in a week"" are his final dismissive words when his wife pleads on Jesus' behalf.

The only reason I drop it to 4 stars are some small but bothersome 'misses', mostly near the start of the film.  Peter's call becomes a private conversation instead of occurring in the context of a public event, without any apparent reason for the change.  And when he asks Jesus what they're going to do, Jesus' answer is ""Change the world.""  Sorry -- fail.  Jesus' teaching was plain that ""the world"" was always opposed to Him and always would be.  ""Save the lost sheep of Israel,"" or ""Build an eternal kingdom"", would have been far better and more accurate.  Another minor miss was the through-the-roof incident; as played out on screen, Jesus was outside and there was plenty of space to bring in the paralyzed man, so the roof breakthrough looked pointless and silly.

That said, some bits of artistic license worked wonderfully.  I loved the way they merged Jesus' parable of the Pharisee and the tax collector, in with His calling of Matthew -- under the surface, playing it as though Jesus was relating an actual recent event in Matthew's life.  Why does this adaptation of the history work?  Simply because it affirms and strengthens the key Gospel themes of repentance, forgiveness, grace, and most of all who Jesus is... He didn't have to be there in the synagogue when it happened, He simply KNEW.

So on the whole, not perfect but even so I highly recommend it.",1411084800,7,2503,4.609480812641084

6258020,4,B00ICWO144,"The movie Son of God is a good look at the life and death of Jesus Christ.  If some of these scenes in the movie were taken from the History channel mini series The Bible then I plan to ask for The Bible mini series for Christmas.  The good parts were the actor playing Jesus did a very good job in the role and many more actors were very good also.  I still gave the movie a four star rating because of the acting, shots of the surrounding area of the location where they filmed the movie.  I also enjoy almost all the movie because I was finishing the lines in the movie of the Bible qoutes.  I am personally a Catholic and found the movie moving, powerful, but the scenes of Jesus 40 lashes and his death on the cross very intense and would not reconmend anyone watching this under a certain age.  But I feel if your a truely believe in God, Jesus, and Holy Spirit then you will enjoy the movie and the message it contains threw the telling of Jesus life and death that he is the way and if we believe then we will be with him in the Kingdom of Heaven.",1410652800,5,1055,4.072463768115942

6258035,1,B00ICWO144,"i have not seen anything within this movie that was not already shown in the series The Bible. In fact i believe there is LESS than was shown in The Bible.
Never shows Jesus as a small boy, never shows Jesus being tempted by satan in the desert. When Jesus is baptized it is only a very brief clip in a flash back form. Even some of Jesus' words from the Bible series are edited out.
For example, in the bible series when Jesus is angered in the temple and specifically says ""you cannot serve both God and money"". they sho the scene where he is angered by the buying and selling but they totally CUT that last statement about serving both God and money...???
it is really upsetting. i can't think of 1 scene in this movie that was not already shown in The Bible, not even 1!!!!!
And this movie had sooooo much potential too because there is still sooo much in the Bible that Even the series left out a really great deal of Jesus' life and mission!!!
They could have shown Jesus studying in the temple as a child, or Jesus turning water into wine at the wedding, or Jesus talking about the Parable of the Fig tree, or Jesus talking to Simon !!!!!! i can go on and on!!!! seriously!!! they had sooo much material to use and they could have easily reused old scenery stage sets for scenes like that too!!! since they obviously already had a temple stage set !!!! i saw lots of scenes with trees that they could have reused.
i see no good reason to remarket the exact same overly edited movie twice.
that being said, i will always say that all they actors in the film did a great job. and its not their fault about the greedy marketers choices to milk money out of those who are thirsty for God's message.
I just recommend that if you want the Whole story unadulterated, please seek it from The Bible.... not the series but the BOOK !!!!",1410307200,,1833,4.285302593659942

After the violent excesses of Mel Gibsons The Passion of the Christ, Son of God feels like a bit of a throwback to the days when Hollywood churned out homogenized biblical spectacles with almost as much regularity as it does superhero movies today. This two-and-a-quarter-hour film, expanded from a shorter version originally shown on the History Channel as part of the miniseries The Bible, plods its way through the familiar story without bringing anything particularly new or interesting to the material. It even has a conventionally European Jesus in the person of Portuguese actor Diogo Morgado, which undercuts a good deal of the movies authenticity from the outset. That, combined with an unwillingness to offend anyone, turns the greatest story ever told into a great big heaping helping of pabulum, an Illustrated Highlights edition suitable for a Sunday School lesson perhaps but little else.

The mood is so reverential, in fact - so filled with tired bromides, swelling music, cheesy narration, and endless shots of awe-stricken onlookers - that we are unable to connect with any of the characters as actual human beings, to see them as anything more than actors in a long and very elaborate Easter pageant. The paint-by-numbers screenplay goes through the motions, but it leaves us unimpressed and uninspired. We seem to go from one overly familiar incident to another without the slightest pause for reflection or introspection to help us determine what it all means.

Setting aside, for the moment,  Martin Scorseses mega-controversial adaptation of The Last Temptation of Christ, its not as if there haven't been any GOOD movies made from this story - Pier Paolo Pasolinis The Gospel According to Saint Matthew and Franco Zeffirellis Jesus of Nazareth being just the first examples that spring to mind. And Gibson did bring a unique perspective to Passion, for all the controversy he ended up generating with the film.

And indeed its that very passion - for characterization and human conflict, if not for the subject itself - that Son of God most sorely lacks.",1410134400,2,2085,5.102639296187683

What I did come away with was a beautiful movie that highlighted the familiar parts of the New Testament.  You would have had to already know the whos and whys but for the most part, the story played out.  Beginning with a quick replay of the Old Testament to get the viewer up to speed, then delving into all the stuff that I remember from Sunday school ending with a brutal depiction of the crucifixion and closing with the resurrection.

Are there things that I would have preferred that they correct before the movie hit the big screen? Of course, but that would have involved Roma Downey never having had plastic surgery and the voice coach hired to help Diogo Morgado paying better attention, and Mary, Mary, and the other Mary being better defined for the viewer.

Overall, would I recommend it?  Yes.  Do I now think that I just might have to rent The Bible to see all the other parts that I missed?  Yes",1408924800,2,1101,4.389162561576355

This film covers more than just the conviction, death and resurrection of Jesus, unlike ""The Passion of The Christ"" did, but it also seemed a little rushed with the miracles a bit too close together.

6258116,3,B00ICWO144,"Likely the most uninteresting and culturally inaccurate version of the life of Jesus I have ever watched.  Compared to Jesus of Nazareth and even the various versions of ""King of Kings"" this falls short.  Jesus is just a bit too pretty and non-Jewish in iit.  But some of the scenes are technically well done.  The gospel is quoted well here for the most part and you can't say that for some versions.  And it is in English rather than another language like Gibson's, Passion of the Christ.  Susposed be a "" believer's"" version..appealing to those who already believe.  I believe and I thought it fell short of the real Jesus in the Gospel narratives.  Plus Irish ladies don't make very good Jewish mothers..like Roma Downey as Mary, the Mother of Jesus.",1408320000,,754,4.702290076335878

6258119,5,B00ICWO144,"Good Lord this is a moving movie. Just like the Bible miniseries (from which it was taken) was. This movie, The Son of God really does portray the true Jesus, the truth about Him. I feel much better owing it because it is a great tool to have when friends come over. Hopefully you will have that chance & be able to use it to being others to our Lord.
This movie shows the love that Jesus had for people, the love that He had for children, the love that He had for us by coming down & becoming the sacrifice needed for our relationship with God to be restored.",1408233600,,560,4.1

The people that made this movie don't know the bible and people that rate it high also don't know squat. If you want a movie that is biblicaly correct ""Gospel of John"". Read your bible. Stay away from the NWT bible, book of mormon and Apocryha these are demonic. Read your bible and study your history. Jesus is GOD!!!",1408060800,,455,4.3023255813953485

6258130,1,B00ICWO144,"Opening scene, first 10 minutes was ok.  Otherwise, very poorly done and very little attention paid to accurately portraying the biblical text.  If you want to see a really good story that is well done and absolutely follows the Gospel of John, buy this.  You will love it.  I have watched it over and over.  I never get enough of it.

There was a lot of liberty taken with added content. As a Christian I was very upset watching it, I would think if you were going to the expense to make a movie about the Son of God you would be very careful to use God's word as a reference and guide.

After 5 weeks of waiting, he finally received the movie this morning.  Later today, I was trying to reach him and instead of writing me back, he just sent me a quick snapshot of his face. I could tell something wasn't quite right and asked what was wrong. He told me he was crying.  The movie touched his heart so much that he was in tears. His little niece (5 yrs) was sitting on his lap watching with him and he told me she had her hands together in the praying position and just kept saying, ""Jesus, Jesus"" over and over.  Even though I haven't seen it myself, it brings me great joy to know that this movie means so much to someone like him. He has plans to create a public event and show this movie so that many people will have the opportunity to come to know Jesus. That is priceless to me.",1407110400,4,1036,4.118811881188119

The overwhelming truth of His divinity is  beautifully explained as viewers see God's love for all of His children.

6258234,1,B00ICWO144,"The trailer was a bit deceiving: although the story line is taken directly from the Bible, character introduction and development was very poor. The story line was also very compressed that it made it hard to follow.

6258236,3,B00ICWO144,"1. An OK movie, but did it add some perspective beyond previous films?  Gibson was more gothic and brutal (& more authentic in using the original languages--admirable), Zeffirelli more lavish and moving, Scorsese went deeper.  If I had to come up with an adjective for Morgado's portrayal it would be casual.  Some Netflix wiseacre said West Coast Jesus.

A bolder producer might have pursued something outside the box, say Jesus as Essene or travelling to India.  (Both have been theorized.)

2.  And it is a movie, not theology.  The film should be assessed by its effectiveness as a story told, strength as narrative.  If a film were to be made about any other historical figure it's unlikely there would be a barrage of 'reviews' howling about doctrinal interpretation.  (Face it, evangelicals have control issues:  everyone has to have their eggs one way.)  One wouldn't expect a movie about Mozart to reflect the depth and range of his works, or promote one interpretation.

The response to any movie about Jesus is more disturbing that anything found in any script.  Some folks need to lighten up.

Jesus is the living Word of God but unfortunately, this movie seemed to skip and miss things of importance in the scripture.  The chronicles of events weren't accurate and there were some things that just didn't go along with what's written by the disciples from Matthew to John.  Can't say this movie left much of an impression on us.  I honestly would love to see the writers redo this film and make it accurate to the scripture.  I love seeing movies, scripture come to life on a screen such as ""One Night with the King"" but when things are missing and the accuracy isn't there then it takes away from the scripture in my opinion.",1405728000,,776,4.398601398601398

6258271,4,B00ICWO144,"It's difficult to write about a movie that focuses on the life of Christ without bringing your own personal beliefs into it. How can you claim to be offering an unbiased review if you believe in Christ to begin with? I do and always have, but I intend to try and hold my personal beliefs in check while writing about SON OF GOD, new on DVD.

If you haven't heard about this film then you've not been paying attention. In 2013 producer Jeff Burnett and his wife Roma Downey put together a TV series that no one expected anyone to watch. What happened surprised the doubters when THE BIBLE went on to become one of the most watched min-series of that year. With that triumph the pair decided to focus on the life of Jesus and made this film which was released to theaters. Once more some were surprised when the film did well financially.

The film opens with Jesus birth but then moves fast forward to his gathering the apostles starting with Peter. As he moves forward the film doesn't stay too long on any given moment but puts together bits and pieces from Jesus life in the order they happened. Given the subject matter and amount of time allotted for a feature film there is no way that the entire story of Jesus could include everything from start to finish. What the makers of this film have done is touch on many of the momentous items and miracles that happened in that time.

While the first hour of the film touches on his earlier life, teachings and miracles, the second hour begins by setting up his crucifixion. The political ploys between the Romans and the heads of the Jewish religion at the time to insure stability of their personal power is covered here showing that they had no belief in Jesus' teachings and feared him more than anything. He was a disruption to the same old same old, putting their control in jeopardy. As this second hour begins we see them maneuvering him into an arrest which culminates in his conviction and then crucifixion. While painful to watch there is no way it compares to what we saw in Mel Gibson's film THE PASSION. In truth, we don't need to.

What separates this movie apart from so many others is the final 18 minutes of the movie. Where THE PASSION showed the death of Christ, SON OF GOD shows his resurrection and appearance before the apostles after rising from the tomb. This was a complaint many religious leaders had with Gibson's film so they should be satisfied with the presentation of it here.

All of that being said, a short description of what the movie is about, the question becomes is it worth watching? Was it entertaining? To answer honestly I'd have to say for the most part no. It moves along at a slow pace and uses dramatic music in the background too much. Things that happened in Jesus' life seem to be pushed out and then moved aside to get to the next thing and yet the pace drags. The acting is solid for all involved but no one stands out here. The story for most of us is well known and with the exception of the resurrection offers little that we haven't seen before.

That being said, there is a reason to watch the movie. While it may not be a whiz bang movie that holds you by the throat, it does offer an introductory presentation of the life of Christ. If you have children that can't seem to focus on reading the Bible, or if you have problems sticking with it, this movie might offer some insight as to what you'll find there. For some it will give them a glimpse into what Christianity is all about. If nothing else, it could be a good conversation starter that will make people either defend their convictions or defend why they don't have them.

I'm glad I watched the film. I'm glad that it was made and that it was successful. I would guess that a number of people will add it to their collections so that they can watch and remember what they should already know if they believe. Perhaps it will cause a few people to reconsider what they should be doing with their Sunday mornings, perhaps not. In the end the determining factor of whether to watch this movie or not, and if you will enjoy it or not, depends mostly on your own personal beliefs. For me it was a nice reminder of what I hear every week at church.",1405382400,,4211,4.404884318766067

On the other hand, Son of God provides a final that closes the whole story and leaves a clear message that coincides with the whole purpose of Jesus having come to life on a human form. Where the Passion drops the ball, giving a weak ending with the already expected resurrection, Son of God takes it a bit further and closes with the ultimate objective for Christians worldwide.",1405036800,,756,4.649253731343284
6258299,1,B00ICWO144,"I wasn't planning on seeing this film, seeing that the mini-series The Bible took so many liberties with Holy Writ, but I thought, Its a Christian film, and its good to support it.

The one scene I did like was when the Jews protested unto Pilate, the Roman procurator of Judea, that he had used the Temple money to bring a stream of water to Jerusalem, and he ordered his guards to conceal daggers underneath their clothing, and at a given signal, a massacre ensued. That was taken out of Antiquities of the Jews, written by Flavius Josephus, a Jewish historian who lived from 37 A.D - 100 A.D. Even that scene, though, was badly done, in my opinion.

And the key verse was taken from an inferior translation of the Bible. The correct reading is For God so loveth the world, that He hath given His only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in Him, should not perish, but have everlasting life. The Holy Gospel of Jesus Christ According to John 3:16.

The word begotten is critical to the understanding of the text, and is taken from the Greek word monogenes, which has 2 meanings, which you can look up on any search engine, and it will guide you to an appropriate website.

I must add that Jesus baptism was only partially shown, and the Holy Ghost coming on Him in the form of a dove was omitted.

I do NOT recommend this film version of Jesus life. However, if it does get people to actually read the Bible, all well and good. Laud be unto the Father, who liveth forever and ever. Amen.",1405036800,22,1492,4.430656934306569

We do have a problem with the marketing. No where was it made clear that the movie - ""Son of God"": was just the excerpt of the life of Jesus Christ from the recent mini-series, ""The Bible"".  In the beginning of the movie, there is a commercial for ""The Bible"" mini-Series now available on DVD.  We didn't think anything of that - that was ok. But then, when the movie began I realized that we had already seen it - in ""The Bible"".

It is unfortunate that the marketers are more concerned with making an extra buck by getting people to buy the mini-Series and the separate movie which more than likely comes on its own DVD in the mini-Series pack.

6258359,1,B00ICWO144,"The film did well in two areas.  As a whole, the cinematography wasn't bad.  Also, they were true to the accounts of Jesus in that they portrayed His death, resurrection, ascension, that He was the Son of God, and that He is the only way to God.

That being said, the film poorly portrayed the Gospel accounts.  I realize a little creative license has to be taken in some situations.  But the film went off the charts in creative license.  If you are closely familiar with the accounts in the Bible, you will notice that over and over again, the film changes what actually happened (like Jesus going into the tomb to resurrect Lazarus instead of simply praying outside the tomb).

But the place where the film erred the most was in their actual portrayal of Jesus Himself.  He comes across as a celebrity Jesus, instead of a humble servant.  His facial expressions, personality, the way He talks, even the way He walks, all come across as some kind of charming hero.  They also seem to present Him as someone caught up in ""The Cause"".  Here's what I mean.  A frequent trap for those in any kind of Christian ministry is to fall into a hero mentality -  ""The Cause"".  They are so busy doing things, even things done in the name of God, that they forget to take the time to really care for and love those right beside them.  (Why do you think so many pastor and missionary children have ended up such a mess?)  Sadly, by portraying Jesus as someone for ""The Cause"", they misrepresent Him as the one Who really loved and cared for others.  One of the examples from the film was when Jesus calls Peter after the catch of fish.  He does tell him that He will give him ""a chance to change your life.""  But when Peter asks Jesus what they are going to do, Jesus says (almost to Himself, in a rather distant sort of way) ""Change the world.""  Did Jesus change the world?  Yes.  But He comes across here as Jesus for ""The Cause"", not Jesus Who truly loved Peter and Who truly loves you and me.

I hope that, as they were at least true to the bare bones accounts of Jesus, that the film will point people to Him.  But I hope that those who watch it spend time reading the actual accounts of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John, and that they are careful to realize that Jesus was not properly presented in the film.

6258371,4,B00ICWO144,"For people who have never read the biblical accounts of Jesus they will find no fault with this movie. If however you have read the Bible you may wonder about a few things.

I would not say this was a totally accurate portrayal of the life of Christ but it did affect me more emotionally than other Jesus movies I've seen. I felt that Diogo Morgado was probably the best looking Jesus I've ever seen. He also played his part especially well during the crucifixion. How many actors could play that part as well? I doubt many. He also portrays Christ as very compassionate and loving.

Yes there was a lot of violence in this movie but it was not as bad as I expected. There were also some very profound moments when Jesus speaks the truth. Although some liberties seem to have been taken with the dialogue at times. Overall it stayed true to Jesus' message. I'd have preferred to have listened to Jesus' words as recorded in the King James Version but I guess it is too much to expect in our modern age.

There are also a lot of things missing from this movie that would have made it more complete. Like besides Jesus' birth there is nothing about his childhood. While the movie focuses very much on the deep relationship between Jesus and his mother Mary there seems little about Joseph. Even a small scene with Joseph teaching Jesus about carpentry would have been better than nothing. And how about a few scenes of Jesus being lost as a child and being found in the temple? Those things are missing from the life story. But the most important parts of the story are not missing so that is some consolation.

What I did especially like about the movie was the portrayal of the miracles although no one blind was healed. And when Lazarus is raised from the dead Jesus goes into the tomb which is not what really happened. I believe Jesus called Lazarus forth from the tomb. But it makes it way more dramatic when Jesus kisses Lazarus' head and he opens his eyes suddenly. I can see why they made things the way they did but I felt sad at the lack of accuracy at times.

I guess from reading other reviews I get why they left out the temptation of Christ as well. So overall I liked this movie but did not love it. So I give it four stars because I think this movie makes the story of Christ more accessible to the general public. I would however recommend a reading of the New Testament accounts along with viewing this movie. Also there seems very little indication why Jesus is dying in the first place. Viewers who are not Christians already may miss the whole point because it is not explained well. So for the record Jesus died for the sins of the world. If you believe in Jesus you will be given eternal life.

  I'm sorry guys for whoever loved this film. This is a sorry excuse for a Christian film. I would doubt whoever wrote it was a Christian. THe biblical accuracy was maybe around 75-80% if that. The story was there but maybe in wrong chronological order and most of the little details were wrong including very simple famous passages and verses from the bible that even children would get right. I understand you can take certain literary liberties but when dealing with historical and biblical text you don't want to stray from the actual truth for any sort of dramatic or personal literary effect.  Okay they need to make a whole movie the way they did the first 5 minutes. It was a bad tease to make the most awesome 5 minutes I've ever seen about any sort of Christian movie then all of a sudden be like now it's about Jesus who is lame, dumb, and boring. Jesus was/is a powerful, most fascinating, almost mystical and magical divine supernatural being. they need to make it like mortal kombat, harry potter, any of the marvel avenger movies. With all that special effects. Why is it when they make a movie about Jesus it's always slow, boring, puts the viewers to sleep and not accurate? Are they seriously making this movie to the best of their ability?Who did they make this movie for? Christians? I'm a Christian and sort of offended at how bad this film was. For non believers? They would turn it off within 10 minutes or less... It's almost like they are trying to turn people away from christianity rather than showing people the awesome wonder of HIs majesty the King! This is beyond disappointing. I was looking forward to this because others had told me they enjoyed it. I had so much trouble just sitting here watching it. I was bored out of my mind. I don't recommend this movie unless you can watch for free and even then prepare to fall asleep, better yet if you are having trouble falling asleep pop this in your dvd or bluray player and you'll be out like a light.

NOw it's not all bad. The story is always positive. The message of Jesus is always strong. Obviously parts touched my heart because I hold a soft spot in my heart for Jesus so yes there are parts we can connect to but for the most part anyone could make a better movie in their garage! If you are from Hollywood and reading this make the whole movie like the first 5 minutes and you'll have a winner! A 5 star Jackpot!

6258376,2,B00ICWO144,"This film could have actually done a lot of good, yet instead it skips the whole point of Christ, just as the TV series did in addition to warping biblical facts.
""I am the way, the truth, and the life....""
Sounds flowery and poetic and people generally don't have too big a problem with that part of John 14:6.
Secular humanity and even non-gospel churches will tolerate Jesus as long as He is just some historical figure and nice guy. He can even be a great teacher.
But it's the last part of the verse (that is usually skipped) that becomes a great offense - ""... no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.""

It's tolerable that Jesus went around teaching people to love one another, but the instant He becomes the Son of God sent to earth as the ONLY means to save humanity which was otherwise undone and hopelessly lost it becomes offensive. Why do I need a redeemer? I'm a pretty good person!

Remove the true message of the gospel and viewers are left wondering why He went to the cross. Why did He even need to come in the first place?

The account of Jesus is the most powerful, compelling, beautiful and loving message of all humanity.  It stands strong left untampered. Hollywood's modification of it waters it down and removes the true meaning and purpose which in essence is an attempt to undermine God.

I urge you to read your bibles and let God's spirit speak to you so you can know the truth.  Jesus dying on the cross wasn't a blanket forgiveness for everyone or some vain sacrifice or mistake.

 The standard for being with a holy, righteous God is perfect righteousness which none of us have because we have all gone astray and are sperated from God by our sin.  So unless you are perfect, you must have a perfect,sinless sacrifice to take your place for the judgement. Jesus lived the perfect life we can't live (tempted by everything we are yet never sinned),took the sins of everyone upon Him, paid the debt we can't pay, defeated the death we can't defeat and through His substitutionary death He provides atonement and the only way to get to the Father in heaven.
 All we have to do is repent, renounce our claims to personal righteousness, commit our lives and believe in what Jesus did for us on the cross:  Receive Him as your Lord and Savior. Believing God exists isn't enough. The devils believe in God.  You must also belong to God and that's the part where our selfish nature often keeps us seperated from Him.

Hmmm....Funny how none of that comes through in the film...
READ YOUR BIBLES so you can know the truth and the truth will set you free.

EDIT
It's very disheartening to see how many are endorsing this film and how many churches are showing it.  In a biblical church, this film could only be used as an example of how we try to water down and mold Jesus to more of our liking. We continuously seek to deify man and humanize God. If you don't see the huge problems in this film, I pray you will seek the scripture and get alone with God to find the truth. The Gospel is God's chosen way to reach the hearts of man. Remove the Gospel and you remove the whole meaning and are left with nothing but ideas and emotions.  No one comes to Christ due to an emotion or idea. The Gospel convicts and shows the truth and jeopardy of a person's true condition and seperation from God in sin. Upon that dark realization it then shines the light and one answer found in the only redeemer.",1404259200,3,3423,4.40952380952381

6258415,5,B00ICWO144,"what i like most in this movie is that it presents our Lord Jesus Christ as a friend, a contemporary friend I mean. It has some scenarios that are not exactly as the Holy Bible describe them, e.g., the movies shows that St. Thomas was there with the disciples in the attic when Resurrected Lord Jesus Christ appeared to them first time. The Bible is clear that this was not the case. But as you know, each movie about Jesus Christ is the interpretation of the scenarist, director and even the actor.

My personal opinion is that it is good to spend leisure time watching such movies, but it is super dangerous to rely on them for example in teaching or evangelizing. God loves each single person and wrote a personal message to each individual in the Holy Bible, and therefore each person should read the Bible. The movies are the actors/director/scenarist personal message.",1403481600,2,874,4.675324675324675

6258418,3,B00ICWO144,"Son of God is a biblical film based on the ten-hour miniseries,The Bible. It stars Diogo Morgado in the title role as Jesus. It was a re-edited version of 5 episodes about the savior to fit into a 138-minute film. It starts with the birth up to the passion,death and resurrection of Jesus.

The first hour maybe somewhat flawed due to lack of continuity. Blame it on poor editing. It was more that the editors cherry-picked a collection of memorable events from Jesus' life that were gathered together from the life of Jesus in sixty minutes instead of a story being told in a continuous fashion. But nevertheless,the second hour made up for it as makes up for telling the passion,death and resurrection of Jesus. It was like a political thriller in the sense that we get to see how determined the Pharisees in conspiring with Pontius Pilate into putting Jesus into death by manipulating him. Added to that,we also get to see the transformation of the apostles from their weakness into courageous individuals that would spread the Good News to people around the world. Overall,it was a pleasant film but it was far from being a great and memorable one.",1403481600,,1152,4.731343283582089

6258422,3,B00ICWO144,"I found this movie to be a much lower version than the movie ""Jesus of Nazareth"" back in the 60's. The reason I say this is that it is not biblically correct. Some of the scenes, (e.g. When they are having the last supper. In those days in Israel they did not sit at a table with high legs.) They would lay or half sit on cushions on the floor with a table only a few inches off the ground.
They did not have chairs or tables like later on.. The other thing is that when Christ raises Lazarus from the dead, He does not go inside the tomb at all. He also knew four days before that Lazarus was dead. He let Lazarus lay in his tomb 4 days. He did feel sorrow as a human. But after he reached the place where Lazarus was buried. Martha, Lazarus' sister said, ""If you had been here Lord , he wouldn't have died."" That is when Jesus  said , ""I AM the resurrection and the life"".
He then stood by the tomb and prayed for a while. Then stood in front of the tomb and yelled in a loud voice, ""Lazarus, come forth"" ...Lazarus came out of the tomb.
Also, I don't know why people pick actors who are handsome , Hollywood types to play Jesus. Jesus was a Jew in Israel.

Israel is very hot in the summer.  He was dark and with Jewish features and as Paul says later in his Epistles, ""for we all know it is shameful for a man to wear long hair. For a woman it is her glory.""  In those days it was not acceptable for a man to wear long hair in their culture. There are a lot of misguiding things I have seen in the movies concerning Jesus. The movie ""Passion of the Christ "" was better but still out of context with the descriptions of the Bible. If they had whipped Jesus as shown in that movie, He would have died when they whipped Him tearing off his rib cage. He would have bled to death long before he reached the hill of Golgotha.

I liked it because it had been a long time since anybody had made a movie about our Lord. But I could have watched ,""Jesus of Nazareth"" . It is more biblically correct.  Sorry! But that is my review and honest opinion.",1403308800,,2043,4.0320987654320986

If you do not believe in Jesus as your personal savior, perhaps this movie will touch your heart and allow you to accept Him into your life.

The movie's actors and settings are beautifully done making this movie a visual treat. The story is simply told allowing the true magnificence of truth to shine brightly.

Finally, read John 3:16 to learn about how you can have eternal life and enter paradise as depicted in Son of God.

The speed and timing of scenes were like molasis...and yet...they drug out telling the story.  This is a terrible depiction of Jesus' life.  And they misconstrued his mission and message.  not to mention making melodramatic many of the anecdotes from Jesus' life.  The use of setting and scenery is horrid and not as it was in Jesus' time.  Really...it is difficult to find any good in this movie...which is such a shame...because it is so hard today to get the story of Jesus across in a meaningful way to a new modern generation which is largely un-churched.

So why didn't the movie depict it accurately??? If to appeal to new Christians, it is doing a disservice to the Truth -and- to Christianity as a whole.
The event of the woman accused of adultery, leaving out the part about writing in the earth, was to leave out the WORD of YHWH who had something to say about that in the Book of Jeremiah.
Also all throughout the movie, no mention of many of His miracles and that many were done on the Sabbath. Again, not true to the WORD.
And the most important omission was in the Garden when He asked the soldiers: ""Whom do you seek?"" They answer ""Jesus of Nazareth"" and He says "" I AM He"" and the soldiers fell backward because of the Power in the saying of the Name. Except He wasn't asked in the movie and so didn't answer. This being a crucial understanding of the tying together of the Great I AM of the OT to the I AM of the NT.
The depiction of the Last Supper (The Jew's Passover) and the next day's true Passover. There is historical evidence that two calendars were being kept back then and the acceptance of that then clears up the mysterious last supper, what it really was and why EHYEHshua was able to then, go out to the Garden that night when clearly Torah commands against leaving one's home on Passover evening. To mesh the two events together as being one only serves to confuse the Truth and confuse those seeking the truth.
I don't recommend it to serious students of Scripture because of this and even more so to new Christians because it has inaccuracies and omissions.
Many movies are made from books and many movies fail to depict those books faithfully. The Bible is one that should not be allowed to be cherry picked to fit into a short amount of time.

Those who already own The Bible series on DVD or Blu-ray may want to pass up on Son of God if you're looking for something different.  Most of the footage is re-used but re-arranged to focus on Jesus ministry, persecution, death, and resurrection.

The movie is 138 minutes and there are lots of extras with commentary from Joel Osteen, Rick Warren, Charles Jenkins, and Touched by an Angels Dr. Della Reese-Lett.  Theres footage from behind the scenes and a promotion for Compassion International.

Son of God is rated PG-13 for violence due to the beatings and cruel death our savior endured for our salvation.  The message is bold and powerful, my kids were moved to tears for the suffering Christ endured for them.  While this movie isn't as child friendly as Miracle Maker, its not as gory as The Passion of the Christ.  Id say its a happy medium and a great evangelistic tool.",1402358400,,1048,4.591397849462366

You felt like they were rushing through just so they could fit it all in the 2:18 hours.  Also, the actors were pretty amateur and didn't fit these important roles.

The decalogue expressly forbids making any false images of God, yet this movie (that is actually made up from a tv series),does just that. All in the name of capitolstic profit.

My personal impression of this film is that it is a hypocritical gathering of speculation and conjecture put together to make money since no one has an actual first hand account that he ever existed. There is not even any attempt to finally explain the thirty or so years when he went missing from all accounts, why is that?

But that won't stop the true believers from flocking to this movie like the sheep they are. True spirituality does not need poorly made movies or a collection of contradictory books in the bible to confirm the existence of true spirituality. In my opinion it is but yet aother money making scheme of cynical and greedy people.

6258520,3,B00ICWO144,"When I first heard about the movie SON OF GOD, I didn't think it was a good idea. SON OF GOD is a movie that mostly contains re-edited scenes about Jesus from the 2013 miniseries THE BIBLE. There are some additional scenes in the movie, but the majority of it already appeared on television. I understand wanted to reach as large an audience as possible about the gospels (good news) of Jesus, but personally, it reeked a little too much like a money grab to me to simply re-edit television footage and add a few deleted scenes to make a movie that would be released in cinemas. However, I was willing to give the movie a chance and ended up seeing it in theatres twice.

The movie begins with the apostle John, brother of James, on the island of Patmos. John begins to tell about Jesus in the form of a voice over, ""In the beginning there was the Word and the Word was with God and the Word was God."" The short intro takes the viewer through the creation of the world, the destruction of the Earth through flooding, and other events until the birth of Jesus. Then the movie quickly skips over a lifetime.

When we next see Jesus, he is walking towards the shore (from out of the wilderness and the temptation with Satan it is to be assumed) and begins gathering disciples and followers and soon he has a core group of thirteen (that's right, thirteen; more on that later) disciples that travel with him as he goes about teaching, preaching, performing miracles, and seeming to ridicule the Pharisees who question him.

Meanwhile, in Jerusalem word is brought to the high priest of the Jews, Caiaphas, of this man named Jesus. At first he doesn't think much of it and with the arrival of Pontius Pilate to the city, Caiaphas has more important matters at hand. However, as Jesus continues to do what he was doing, Caiaphas comes to see Jesus as someone who could bring harm and suffering to the Jews and, therefore, he must be eliminated.

Jesus is betrayed, captured, and killed, but he rises from the grave. He appears to his disciples and suddenly disappears. The end of SON OF GOD returns to John on Patmos.

In terms of cinematography and film values, SON OF GOD is an average movie. Some of the dialogue is taken from the Bible, but some of it is not Biblical and is very cheesy. The acting isn't terrible, but there are no outstanding or noteworthy performances, either. In terms of production values, SON OF GOD is better than most low budget movies, but it does not have the feel that a big screen movie should have. As mentioned earlier, SON OF GOD is mostly re-edited footage from the tv miniseries THE BIBLE and, for most of the movie, SON OF GOD looks like a tv movie. This won't be as big an issue with the DVD and Blu-ray releases of the movie, but if you watch SON OF GOD on a larger screen television, you can definitely notice a difference in the production values.

In terms of a movie that's supposed to be a Bible-based movie, SON OF GOD is pure fluff that only uses the Bible for its core values, while ignoring the details and some of the more difficult and darker parts of scripture.

Personally, the biggest Biblical error with SON OF GOD is that instead of twelve disciples there are thirteen and the thirteenth disciple is a woman named Mary. Yes, there were woman who followed Jesus around and some of them (not just one of them) was named Mary. However, there was never a disciple named Mary. When I first saw the Mary character I thought, ""Oh, that's a little different, but I understand why she's there."" However, it took me a little while to understand that this ""Mary"" wasn't just going to be a close follower of Jesus, she was actually going to be a disciple. She follows the men wherever they go: eating and sleeping in the same places. Not only that, but ""Mary"" is given some of the better lines in the movie. She jokes around with the boys, is outspoken, and reproves the other disciples for not having enough faith (also suggesting that her faith is stronger). She's there to comfort Martha at the death of her brother and she's there at the foot of the cross when Jesus is crucified. She's the first (and initially the only one) to see the empty tomb and it is she, not angels, who reminds the other disciples that Jesus said he would arise on the third day.

There are many other Biblical changes, inaccuracies, alterations, and outright errors in SON OF GOD (for instance, Jesus doesn't know that Peter is going to deny him until he gives him a hug). Movies are a completely different medium than literature. I understand that. In telling a story on the screen, especially a story that covers three years (or all of history, really), you have to make changes and sacrifices to make a 2 - 2  hour movie that is not only appealing to believers, but to those who might not really know much about Jesus. I get that. However, there's no cinematic reason to add another disciple and make her a woman. I believe that the reason for doing so was to appeal to a wider (and more female) audience, but in doing so, SON OF GOD dilutes not only the message, but the messenger of Jesus himself.

Overall, I was really disappointed with SON OF GOD. On a cinematic level, I expected the movie to be a better movie than it was. However, as a movie, SON OF GOD feels more like a big budget tv episode than it does a feature-length motion picture. In terms of Biblical and scriptural accuracy, SON OF GOD verges on heresy and seems to be more similar to the books&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Holy-Blood-and-the-Holy-Grail/dp/0099682419/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Da-Vinci-Code/dp/0307474275/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Da Vinci Code</a>&nbsp;than the Bible.

6258521,4,B00ICWO144,"It is part of ""The Bible"" miniseries. Which I skipped a few of the smaller stories and went onto the meat of the series so to speak. I found this to be a very likeable telling. Jesus is portrayed very well and when watching this I could see the others in the story learning from him even though they were not suppose to. As one person kept saying...""There is something about him""...he did not agree with the elders whom wanted him gone. He was the one who tried to bait Jesus when he asked him about taxes and Jesus replied ""Render unto Ceaser that which is his"".
  I can only speak for myself when I say that I think this would be more entertaining to someone whom is already familiar with the Bible. I say that because it all happens so fast and there is not a lot of development of characters. There is so much to tell and so little time.
 As for myself....I more than likely will buy it.",1399334400,,891,4.1988304093567255

8640894,3,B00ICWO144,"Compared to the myriad of movies about the life of Jesus, this one seems to leave too many 'good parts' out. Covers too little of the miracles and tempting by the devil. I Like the lead actor and the production video but it was a bit too scant on meat of the story of the Son of God. In fact, it looked like some recycling off the cutting floor of their production of 'The Bible' - the New Testament part. Still good educational movie - but there are better planned ones out there.",1531699200,,481,4.182795698924731
