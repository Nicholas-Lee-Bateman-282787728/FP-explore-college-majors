15 minutes with me adjusting all the equipment to no avail.

I shut it off and filed it under ""to be trashed.""

We think the content was good if we could stand the awful audio production.",1426723200,,258,4.446808510638298
8353306,5,B0026OIBFE,"After having seen this performance live, I purchased the video and have also given it as a gift to several friends.  It is wonderful.  Everyone who received it as a gift has said the same.  Some are opera lovers and others are new to the art form.  Once they have seen this, they fell in love with Madame Vera.  She is one of a kind.  The parody and the humor will surely bring a smile.  A great way to look into the soul of a true artist.  I agree, Madame Vera, there is nothing more healing than the sound of your own voice!!!  Brava!",1319760000,2,536,4.076923076923077
8353307,1,B0026OIBFE,"I love opera and spoofs of opera. BUT this one was simply terrible, it was not funny, it was unlistenable, it was stupid. I would be happy to sell it for 25 cents.",1278892800,,163,3.9696969696969697
8353308,5,B0026OIBFE,"I, too, came to buy this wonderful disk via the review in Opera News.  While the reviewer does say its length might be too much of a good thing, the operative phrase is ""good thing"".  If you love opera, in spite of its sometimes wretched excesses, then you will be totally charmed by this send-up of all its gloriously wretched conventions, lovingly spoofed, beautifully (mostly) sung.

I wish I'd been in that audience, an audience which obviously understood the layers upon layers of meaning -- listen for the undercurrent during Kavatina Turner's ""battles"" to get every little thing just the way she wanted it, listen for Sylvia Bills's lament about the few notes she had at the end of her career...oh, what the heck, just listen, because you'll have a hard time catching it all the first time through.  And you will watch and listen over and over, I guarantee it!",1274918400,6,867,4.7218543046357615
