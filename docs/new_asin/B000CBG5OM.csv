8324093,1,B000CBG5OM,"was very upset that this DVD did not specify that you could not play it in the United States.  Why was it on Amazon, USA. False Will not deal with this vendor ever again and will make sure my friends and colleagues are aware of it..",1261526400,,232,4.043478260869565
8324094,5,B000CBG5OM,"There is no doubt that Anthony Callea has one of the best voices of all time. This DVD was recorded after his first album was released. It has a great variety of songs, including his big hits, like ""The Prayer,"" ""Per Sempre,"" ""Bridge over Troubled Water,"" and ""Rain."" I think my favorite might be ""Wanna Be the One,"" which is infectious and upbeat.

Though this wouldn't play on my old DVD player, I had no problem playing it on my computer. Besides the concert, there are five videos, a making of, and a behind the scenes. All in all, it's one of my favorite concert DVDs ever. Now I hope my dream comes true and he duets with Leona Lewis someday.",1233360000,,648,4.355371900826446
