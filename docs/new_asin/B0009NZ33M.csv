8314774,5,B0009NZ33M,"This is a wonderful way to watch this series whether you have seen it already or not.  The price point is comparable to completing the series on DVD, however you will have twice as many discs, and will have to wait longer(the DVD releases have a head start).

The UMD has excellent PSP presentation.  When you have selected Video, UMD on the PSP menus, you are treated to a series themed wallpaper, upbeat trip hoppish music, and action sequences playing in a small window.

Once you enter the UMD, you get three trailers which is nice.  They range from mecha, to thriller, to bizarre comedy.  They all look and sound great, but the widescreen shows have full screen trailers(4:3 and with black bars on top/bottom and left/right).

You get your usual two audio tracks with subtitles available, and both are excellent.

The image quality is excellent and really shows how well animation works on PSP.  This series is in a widescreen format originally and looks like they nailed the PSP screen format perfectly.

If you have 1.5 firmware you might notice this, but with 2.0 firmware, the transition from the UMD menu to the actualy show is glitchy.  The series name is supposed to slide down and fade to black, but it freezes with 2.0.",1126656000,6,1233,4.688372093023256
