7925037,5,B00004WCC7,"Una DVDmagazine de lo mejor hasta la fecha. Trata campos como el modelado, props, efectos especiales, etc. La pena que solo esta en ingles y con las posibilidades de ese soporte se puede subtitular en otros idiomas y tendrian mas probabilidades de venta. Porque la verdad es que esta muy interesante.",1015977600,,300,4.901960784313726
7925038,4,B00004WCC7,"I love movie F/X and with so few mags out there now it's nice to see something I can get. I do have a few problems with it.
1) The background music is not in the background. I have to strain to hear the people talking. Tone down the music it's just too loud.
2) I just want more detail, I enjoy what you do and it's great but I hunger for more detail. How about taking a prop build from the start to finish. It know it's a lot of work but it would be great to see.",999043200,,464,3.696969696969697
7925039,4,B00004WCC7,"I wanted to comment on this DVD. Since Movie Magic ( the tv show) went off the air I have been looking for something like this, found reference to it on the Discreet support forums and bought the first issue as a 'test' ..There is some great material in here, my favorite being the maquette sculpting piece. I am on my way to order the second issue, All in all its a great e-zine, which will go well with my Cinefex magazine.",979603200,2,425,4.195121951219512
7925040,5,B00004WCC7,"I read the following review of MovieFX by Jim Brachman on his  entertainment site, got the magazine and got exactly the behind the scenes  perspective on special effects I was hoping for.  I got to see effects  explained in motion -- just what I wanted.  Here was his review:
Premiere  Special Effects by Jim Brachman
As more and more movies continue to fall  into the rehash of a rewrite of a repeat category, special effects, though  dismissed by critics as mere hocus pocus; have long been critical to the  creative process in Hollywood. George Lucas and Steven Spielberg, as well  as other prominent directors, though obviously talented in their own right,  clearly owe a tremendous debt to a quiet army of special effects artists  and craftsmen.
With ever-increasing frequency, special effects, or FX  experts are entering ""above the line"" deal making; only in recent  years have they come to be considered as important as writers, directors  and actors. Case in point: ""The Legend of Sleepy Hollow.""  ""Sleepy Hollow"" didn't begin as a script, a development project  for star Johnny Depp or something director Tim Burton wanted to do. It  began when special effects wizard Kevin Yagher (""Chucky"" and  ""Crypt Keeper"" creator) decided to bring an updated version of  Washington Irving's masterwork of terror to the screen and was given the go  ahead.
""Movie FX"" is a brand new quarterly DVD magazine devoted  to the art of special effects. The premiere issue is very impressive.  Lovers of science fiction and fantasy will love this material. Critics, if  they ever hope to know what they're talking about, need to see it, too. For  anyone hoping to break into the business in the special effects field, I  can't think of a better place to start.
The DVD format beautifully lends  itself to showcasing the development and execution of special effects; much  of this material would be wasted in a print media format.",965260800,4,1918,4.927899686520377
