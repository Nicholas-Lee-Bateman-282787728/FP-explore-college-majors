8346536,5,B001VKSPUK,Part one of two sets. Must get the second set if you buy the first. Really enjoyed the story line but had to watch it twice to better understand some of the reasons for the story.,1472860800,,179,4.0
8346537,5,B001VKSPUK,"This is definitely a girl's anime. I love love love this movie! In fact, this was the very first anime movie (excluding pokemon, dragon ball z, inyuasha, Cowboy beepop since those are the first series I ever saw) I ever watched. And I watch this like every 2 years it seems haha! I get a urge to watch it and I do! LOOOOOVE It! So dramatic yet entertaining. Everything is interesting from the start. I love me some Reika! Beautiful animation.

I don't know why the DVD cover has them almost appearing like they're naked...not true. When you buy each episode separately, they have a much cleaner DVD cover. Oh well! Still loves it! haha!",1392768000,,636,4.530434782608696
8346538,5,B001VKSPUK,I love this movie alote I seen it when it came ot an had to wait to buy it till  it came out on dvd,1388275200,,99,2.96
8346539,3,B001VKSPUK,"The story itself is pretty good.  It has a good plot and characters, and the show could have been great.  The problem is 'literally' half of every episode is comprised of musical montages.  There are up to 3 montages in an episode (when there's only 1, that 1 is very long).

I know what you're thinking, ""The show is about music"" ""They have to have montages to diplay the character's improving their musing and performing on stage"".  Well... yes.  But, there are only 3 songs in the series, and 1 of those is only used for 1 montage, so the other 20-something montages use the same 2 songs, over and over and over.

Scenes of the show are repeated in the same way as the music.  There is (again) 'LITERALLY' a flash back to a scene that was shown 1 MINUTE EARLIER.  Most of the montage scenes are used several times through out the series.  So the montages later in the show are the same music with the same images as the ones in previous episodes.

If they had not been so cheap? lazy? as to reuse scenes, and had used more than 3 songs (say 10-ish) the montages would not have been so mind numbing.  After a few episodes I was fast-forwarding through them all to get back to the plot, which was really good and worth watching.",1330041600,3,1229,4.318777292576419
8346540,5,B001VKSPUK,"The reason for the title of my review is this, the cover art kind of makes it look like one of those fanservice/hentai'ish anime when it is completely not.  If anything, it is the complete opposite.

I first saw this title in Best Buy but avoided it because of what the cover art seemed to suggest.  About 2 years later (after I completely forgot about this title) I saw this anime on a legal stream site (Crunchyroll) and was very impressed and inspired by it.  Looking for it on Amazon, that was when I realized that the title I watched online and the title I left untouched 2 years prior were the same.  All I could think was, ""wow, I totally missed out then!""  I just want to be sure that other people don't miss out on such a wonderful and subtle title due to misperceptions caused by the cover art style.

For people looking for anime that they can safely share with friends and older family...or simply just want to enjoy without worry about (or annoyance of) the overt fan service stereotypes of many other anime titles, this would be a good pick (though, if the cover still bothers you, you can just purchase the 3 individual volumes...personally, I think the individual volumes are much more artistic and a truer representation of the story; you can also do the classic white-out-the-cover or totally put the discs in another container).  One thing I would say is to rent/stream it (legally) first.  Because, to be fair, for some people some of the dresses can be considered somewhat ""short"" (they are striving to be Japanese stars after all).  We are talking about a ballet tutu, a bare-midriff with a skirt cut at mid-thigh, and for the other girl, a slightly shorter skirt with blue dancing tights underneath...all of which are for their show outfits.  Yet, it still somehow plays out very conservatively.  In all honesty, it's really no more than what you would see at a ballet concert...and the girls really are that conservative haha. When not doing shows, they all wear long skirts or long pants, and not once are they risque or anything like that (on and off stage).  The overall perception of the show is really conservative, wholesome, and friendly.  They aren't the Pussycat Dolls dressing, dancing, acting, and singing for what has kind of become synonymous with a lot of ""girl-assertiveness"" and ""girl-power"" initiatives these days.  These girls (Akari, Yuki, and Nozomi) are singing simply because they want to touch the souls of people.  Also, the show avoids a lot of the goofy anime stereotypes (which I, myself, can find annoying).

This is a very inspiring series about three different girls from completely different walks of life pursuing music.  You've got the Church choir girl, the street performer, and the rich celebrity-star-struck girl.  Beyond this, I'm not going into any spoilers.  It is true, as some others pointed out, that it is very obvious about where it's headed.  So if plot twists are your thing, this is most definitely not it.  BUT THAT SAID, I don't think this anime was even about plot twists and turns.  Rather, I believe that the producers' intent was more about showing the influence of Fate, how bad events aren't the end of things, redemption/reconciliation, and about the life journeys of the girls.  An orchestra conductor wrote in a book, and I paraphrase, that in order for a musician to be good, he must not only be musically savvy - he must be a student of Life and the experiences contained in it.  Thus, it is the journey that makes the a worthy musician.  This anime really captures that well.

As the girls progress, you really get to know them and find yourself personally involved in their affairs.  I came close to tears at times...both of joy and of sorrow.  In the end, the series really leaves you with a warm feeling inside...a hopeful one.  With a lot of films that try to garner viewers through intrigue and a darker (or what is sometimes mistaken as a ""realistic"") look at life, this show was a very well needed breath of fresh air.  I can only take so much corporate greed/corrupted institutions stories, after all!  ""Chance Pop Session"" was definitely a good reminder that in even difficult times, there is hope in hard work and diligence...especially with friends, fellow colleagues, and family.  So, if you love music, going into the business, or just want a warm, hopeful story...this is definitely a good place.  And perhaps it may help brighten your life and the way you interact with others as well :-)",1326240000,2,4489,4.734877734877735
8346541,4,B001VKSPUK,"This is a great anime series--excellent character development for both the main and secondary characters.  Surprising plot developments.  Not for young kids.  The story is five stars, but the May 2009 complete collection is a disappointment though.  We had first watched the series years ago, borrowed from the library.  We enjoyed it very much and when I saw it here I decided to acquire it.  While the animation is all the same, for some reason the subtitles for the song lyrics are not translated into English on this version.  We always watch films in their original language, with subtitles, and the one from the library provided English subtitles for the lyrics--this one has subtitles, in Romanjii (our letters spelling Japanese words); entirely unhelpful and frustrating.  As I write, the site says that there are only a few copies left, with more on the way.  Hopefully they will fix the translations.",1266105600,,910,5.013333333333334
8346542,5,B001VKSPUK,"Chance Pop Session. Where do I start? This anime was one of the very few that touched me with it's story about starting from the bottom, then rising all the way to the very top. The art is unique and the english voice acting is perfect. Top notch ADV VAs like Shelley-Black, Monica Rial, Christine Auten, Hilary Haag, Kelli Cousins, (and my all time favorite...) Tiffany Grant have done wonderfully to bring their girls to life. The english VAs never came up short and really nailed who they were playing. ADVFilms has been gifted with the best in voice acting. Chasing dreams and being inspired is never cliche, it's what normal people face everyday and it's wonderful to see an individual complete his/her mission. Chance Pop(Triangle) Session is that story.

The story is about three girls, each one comes from a different background and lifestyle. They all attend a concert which features blonde bombshell/singing sensation Reika. Reika is one hell of a singer from watching the first episode, it's no wonder the girls became inspired. All three girls, now inspired by the beautiful blonde, have set a goal to become singers. First we have: Akari, the easy going polite girl who sings like an angel, always had the talent and never showcased it till now. Second, Yuki: Yuki started out as a crew member for Reika's concert. She works several jobs, saving up for her chance at singing. Third, Nozomi: Nozomi comes from a rich family with over-protective parents, but her obsession for Reika has given her a push to become singer as well.

All three girls eventually overcome the odds and end up becoming R3, a trio group. However, there's a connection between the three and many road blocks they must overcome to succeed. In addition to their story, the touching and powerful moments between strict, but intelligent manager Kisaragi Akiba and adopted daughter(Reika) are beautiful to watch.

The music is amazing. People have complained that the same song repeats itself, however I feel that each song can be heard a million times but they never grow old. Kinda like Survivor's Eye of the Tiger or Michael Jackson's Thriller. Feel the music, those songs are the catchiest I've ever heard. The entire CPS soundtrack was stuck in my head, can't say the same thing for most anime soundtracks. And I don't care what anyone says, ""Priority"" is one of the greatest J-POP songs to come along in years!

This is a story about overcoming the hard life reality and working hard to achieve your goals. No battles with Majin Buu, or whacky harem mayhem, just good old anime storytelling of overcoming the odds and singing, singing, SINGING to your hearts content.

*sweatdrops* On a less serious note, I wish I got the thinpak! Looks beautiful! I got the single DVDs years ago ^o^;

Very recommended anime title. If you wanna grow up and become a singer, (and love anime) here's a good way to spark that passion.",1158796800,7,2903,4.819277108433735
8346543,5,B001VKSPUK,"Chance Pop Session is a fun, warmhearted story which has more going for it than you might think. Parents should note that this is a ""safe"" title, with no sex, violence etc... but it's still a compelling story that's fun to watch! In some ways Chance Pop Session is not unlike the very popular ""Kaliedo Star,"" which emphasizes effort and teamwork towards success. The characters have depth and personality, their issues are meaningful, and the overall mood of the series is one of hope for the future and the warmth of bonds of family and friends. Chance Pop Session hasn't been discovered by many anime fans in America, but it's one of the good ones.",1157673600,7,650,4.660869565217391
8346544,3,B001VKSPUK,"Chance Pop session is the story of three different girls that have same desire:To become a singer like their favorite singer Reika...They make a group called R3 & start growing up in the charts...But you'll find out that the story is not just about the music...

The thing that I can say about this title is that from the beginning you can guess what's going to happen next, although the plot is ok but nothing is unexpected here; And one thing that bother me alot was that from the 1st episode to the end, R3 just keep singing 1 song ""Pure Blue""!!! Come on you can see much more music in ""Key the metal idol""(Which has 1 of my favorite soundtracks) than this title. I'm not saying the songs are not good (Opening & ending songs are really nice) but you need more in such an Anime...
