I can't complain about the great animal shots and video quality and excellent narration but I don't need to spend an hour learning about frozen frogs, beavers birthing mooses, bears and ground squirrls!
In an hour, I saw little of the majesty of the park's scenery. Nothing on how it was settled or it's people. What I got was a lot of animal close ups. I saw so much underground footage that I was becoming claustrophobic. Enough of the frozen wood frog already!!
Yes, I am a lover of animals but this aspect was over done. I never saw a park ranger or saw or heard anything that would help me plan my upcoming visit to Denali.
Sorry PBS! This video belongs in a High School Biology class! If you are planning a visit to Denali you will do better by surfing the net or finding a good book about the park.",1341705600,,889,4.2976190476190474
8059486,5,B0009E32GG,"Alaska's Denali National Park is one of the world's last untouched places and rightfully is one of the world's last places that could be considered an ""Eden"".

The DVD captures a year of time in Denali, beginning with late winter when almost all life is in hibernation or trying to find food during the Denali winter.  As time-lapse and time-recorded video photography shows, life is reborn during spring. Although the Denali growing season is short, videographers and narration describes life in a variety of detail, from caribou to wolves, from moose to hinds, to ground squirrels and beavers, to a fascinating look at a wood frog that is all but resurrected from a frozen body to live during the Denali summer.  The video shows life living in the moment and preparing for the eventual return to winter as the seasons change during the video.

If you enjoy National Geographic or BBC Life productions, you will not be disappointed by this video.  The Living Edens: Alaska's Denali The Great Wilderness relates life in the wild on a simple and exquisitely beautiful level, serenely video-graphed and documented for those of us who wish to view one of the world's remaining last places where few humans have set foot.",1305417600,5,1217,4.888349514563107
8059487,5,B0009E32GG,"I watched two Alaska videos this week.  The first one is not impressive, and it seems to be produced in 1 week.  The second one (the one I am reviewing) is from PBS, it is excellent.  It does not only have beautiful scenes, but have a lot of parts about animals.  It covers the four seasons of Denali.  PBS did spend a lot of effort to take this video.  I am very impressed.",1142467200,30,374,4.054794520547945
