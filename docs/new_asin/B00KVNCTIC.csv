6451526,4,B00KVNCTIC,"Well acted - worth seeing simply due to the talented actors (e.g., Paul Scofield & Malcom McDowell, etc.).  SPOILER ALERT - goof at the final section of movie - date stamp on film indicates it is May 1945 when the SS want to ship the riders to Germany to be melted down to become bullets.  Holland was liberated May 5th - the war in Europe was over May 7th.  By the 1st week in May Germany did not possess any infrastructure that would have allowed them to move these items to Germany - the war was basically all but over by ""May 1945"".  Not sure if the book indicates this critical part of the story took place in May 1945 or the filmmakers did not research - but certainly a ""goof"" on someone's part.",1434931200,2,702,4.2164179104477615

6451533,5,B00KVNCTIC,"4 1/2 STARS FOR A FAMILY FRIENDLY WWII TALE ILLUSTRATING RESPONSABILITY, BRAVERY, PRE-JUDGING OTHERS, PERSONAL LOSS, DUTCH RESISTANCE IN WWII

This adaptation of the book aired on the Disney Channel in 1996 and features a terrific story and wonderful performances by well known actors.  In this version, young Johanna's mother is Dutch, not her father.  A few other things are changed as well, but the spirit of the book is maintained in my opinion.  I have no emotional investment into the book of the same name, so perhaps fans will have to judge for themselves.  The movie is terrific on it's own.

THE PLOT:  Johanna is brought to the Netherlands to visit her grandparents.  However, the German occupation threatens their stay and Johanna's mother begs the grandparents to accompany them out of the country.  Through a series of events, American Johanna ends up staying with her grandparents in the village of Kerkendam, Holland for over three years and the German Army ultimately occupies their small town.  A central part of the tale is the clock in the town square which is maintained by Johanna's grandfather and features miniature Cavaliers in 1700's style that rotate outside the clock.  These ""Little Riders"" are a symbol of Dutch pride from an ancient battle.  Johanna assists her grandfather in their upkeep and protection.  As the Germans arrive in Kerkendam, we see a commander CPT Kessel who seems to understand the concept of stepping lightly and winning hearts and minds.  Conversely, LT Braun has just arrived from the Russian Front and appears to be somewhat ruthless.  As the German officers are assigned billets with the local populace, it is this very LT Braun who will stay with Johanna's family. Complicating things is the fact Johanna's father is an American aviator dropping bombs on Germany at the time.  Johanna must act carefully and reign in her hatred for the Nazis which is explained in the movie.  As you might expect, everything isn't black and white.  Johanna struggles with her preconceptions and the humanization of her enemy as they grow to know each other.  Evil is not always where it seems, yet can come from other sources.  Ultimately the Little Riders are at risk because of their symbolism and the lead content which is of use to the Germans in their war effort.  We see the different shades of grey in kindness from some Nazis, collaborators who work with the Germans, and the resistance that fights them behind the scenes.  We end in a race to save the clock figures and Johanna will find herself in harrowing circumstances as the situation calls for her to act on her own initiative.

This is a wonderful tale and not a bad place to start introducing young family to WWII issues based on your own judgment.  It does have a Disney feel, particularly of older classics than a relatively recent 1996 release.  There is some violence including a public execution which is handled as modestly as could be under the circumstances.  For those looking for a gritty, realistic WWII war movie, this isn't really that by design.  I found no historical connection for the basis of this tale and see no claims of such.  However, authors often take some kernel of history somewhere for inspiration.  I cannot say in this case and this should be considered a fictionalized tale.  Besides historical concepts, it's a wonderful example to inspire courage, responsibility and fairness in youth.

It's just a great tale and can likely be purchased for little more than the cost of a rental or download.  I highly recommend it!",1414281600,6,3555,4.883138564273789
6451534,5,B00KVNCTIC,"Loved this. I really enjoy Nolie Thornton. I enjoyed her in Heidi and of all the Hiedi movies done, hers with Jason Robards is my ultimate favorite.",1478908800,,148,4.518518518518518
6451535,5,B00KVNCTIC,"This tv-film gives visually a good impression of the German occupation of the Netherlands 1940-1945, in which the practice of the German soldiers grew in brutality by stealing the bronze ancient church bells to melt down to war equipment in their weapon industrie. The filmstory has conversations that I could not adequately translate immediately because of lack of Dutch subtitles (alas I found no copy of the film for the Dutch market).
I remember to have seen in 1994 or 1995 the recordings in Holland in the village De Rijp, only 13 kilometers east off my home town Castricum. I was there during a pause in the actor sessions and I saw the filmset on the central square in De Rijp, with large swastika nazi-flags hanging on the front of the town-hall, and large direction-indicatorboard ""Ortskammandantur"" (region commander). It was a frightening scene for me, realizing that I was a little beggar during the 2d World war, in which my parents suffered hunger in Amsterdam during the winter 1944-1945, when I was 3 years old and only remember a cold water washing-glove in our dark kitchen with candle-light.",1474329600,,1111,4.914893617021277
6451536,5,B00KVNCTIC,"Another version of the Holocaust, lest we forget that horrible tragedy.  I hope we always make movies of horrors like that so we never forget and never let it happen again, in any country, to anyone.  It's about a brave little girl - just a story - I think it isn't based on truth, but could have been.  Let us hope there are always little boys and girls who are brave like she was, who do the right thing.  Recommend this movie to watch with the children in your life.",1472601600,,469,4.177777777777778

6451538,5,B00KVNCTIC,"Its an amazing movie!! I saw it years ago on Disney and have loved it ever since.

6451542,5,B00KVNCTIC,This is a good movie. It brings across a very difficult situation and subject in a way that is made for Family. More people should see this movie then probably have. All children should watch it once they reach the age able to understand it. And many people don't realize that it was more than Germany that was hurt in the war. And they need to realize this! This movie shows all of that very well.,1454630400,,398,4.25
