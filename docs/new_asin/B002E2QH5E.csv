8366766,3,B002E2QH5E,"This documentary starts with a summary of the situation of Germany (on the western front) at the beginning of June 1944 and ends with Operation Marketgarden in Holland in September 1944.  It covers the Normandy (Operation Overlord) and Mediterranean (Operation Anvil) Allied landings, the Oradour reprisal by the SS division ""Das Reich"", the liberation of Paris on 24 August and the ill-fated Operation Marketgarden, but only in very general brushstrokes, with few and poor maps.  It does not cover the massive Soviet Operation Bagration in Belorussia, from the Dnepr to the Vistula north of the Pripiat Marshes, which occurred during that time period and resulted in the near complete destruction of Army Group Center.

In fact, most of the DVD is spent on two other topics:
A) short biographies of von Rundstedt (Chief OB West in 44), Goering (Chief OKL), Doenitz (Chief OKM), Keitel (Chief OKW) and Jodl (Operations Chief OKW); there are some mistakes: von Rundstedt is said to have retired in 1938 and to have been recalled four years later, i.e. in 1942, but he actually commanded Army Group South in 1939 (Poland), Army Group A in 1940 (France) and Army Group South in 1941 (Barbarossa, Ukraine).
B) A detailed (and fast paced) comparison of divisional organizations and armaments between 1941 and 1944, especially of Panzer divisions, to the brigade, regiment, and battalion levels.  That coverage is actually the most interesting one in this DVD.

Of note is that this DVD is the first in a series of three (with the same cover art) followed by&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hitler-s-Twilight-Battle-for-the-Fatherland/dp/B002TLRG8W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hitler's Twilight: Battle for the Fatherland</a>and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hitler-s-Twilight-The-Race-To-Berlin/dp/B0030Y11RO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hitler's Twilight: The Race To Berlin</a>.",1341014400,3,1960,6.138686131386861
8366767,2,B002E2QH5E,"One has to wonder if this is only a part of a series and they simply forgot to finish it...the first 20 minutes or so are devoted to the early years of the war which leaves less time to cover what is the central theme of this documentary, namely Hitler's increasing paranoia concerning the OKW and how his decisions shaped the final year of the war. This film takes you to Operation Market Garden (the attempted capture of Arhnem) and then abrupty ends. Such compelling events as the Bulge, Operation Bagration, and the defence of Berlin are not covered. Not a bad documentary, for example, the OOB comparisons of the Army of 1940 and 1944 were very interesting,  but overall,  it could have been so much more. Not recommended as a purchase but OK as a rental.",1337385600,,760,4.54014598540146
