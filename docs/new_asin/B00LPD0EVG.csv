6497898,1,B00LPD0EVG,"Agree with ""ridicules"", this Season 6 Volume 1 skips the first 8 episodes of Season 6 according to IMDB.
I have never seen this before from a company. Not only was it split into parts but parts were left out. Amazing.

6497958,4,B00LPD0EVG,"Just finished watching ""Ancient Aliens - Season 6: Volume 1"" released by the History Channel.
As faithful readers of my reviews know, I always admit if I have a connection of any kind to anyone who writes novels, short stories, movies, television shows, and/or audio productions.  I kind of - sort of have a connection with High SETI Priest Cultist Seth Shostak, who is prominently featured in the Season 6 episode ""Aliens and the Red Planet"" which postulates that the planet Mars was once home to a technologically advanced civilization billions of years ago.  SETI Cult Leader Shostak gives, whether knowingly or unknowingly give a LOT of credence to this wacky theory be providing commentary about past conditions on Mars being conducive to host life.
Time to set the WayBack Machine about 10-to-12 years ago when George Whitesides was the president of the National Space Society and editor of it's monthly magazine Ad Astra.
Shostak wrote an opinion piece that was a hatchet jog ridiculing ""Creationism.""  I approached the magazine about writing an opinion piece rebutting Shostak.  My opinion piece never saw print in Ad Astra and Whitesides yelled over the telephone at me that if he had published that piece my writing career would be over because I would be exposed as a Christian!  Gasp!  How insulting!  I'm Jewish!  It was my last dealing with George Whitesides and the National Space Society - by then I had had my fill with both of them and I'm sure the feeling was mutual.  Whitesides had to give me the full rights back to the article and he wasn't a happy camper about it back then.
So I'm quite bemused that SETI Cult Leader Shostak is espousing that, despite evidence to the contrary, that a highly advanced technological civilization escaped from a dying Mars to Earth on an episode of Ancient Aliens.
""Ancient Aliens Season 6: Volume 1 has deliciously funny shows ranging from ""Aliens and Stargates,"" to ""Aliens and the Lost Art,"" and  ""The Star Children.""  Whizbang graphics up the visual anty and make the show worth watching - especially when my favorite SETI Cult Leader makes an appearance, wide-eyed and beaming in a comfy chair.
Recommended for light viewing.
Four Stars because of SETI Cult Leader Shostak's belief in an ancient Technologically Advance, Space Traveling Martian Civilization!  Well Worth The Price of Admission!",1450224000,,2355,4.964376590330788

6497961,1,B00LPD0EVG,"This is incredible nonsense. I couldn't even finish the first episode, ""Aliens and Forbidden Islands"", it was such an incredible time waste. It quickly jumps from one speculative, unsubstantiated story to another. According to this DVD, entire islands, rising thousands of feet from the ocean floor (namely, ""Sandy Island"", can totally disappear. But nobody was ever on Sandy Island. According to Wikipedia, this location is prone to pumice rafts from undersea volcanoes. Why didn't the DVD mention this plausible explanation? According to the DVD, there are many underwater UFO bases. On other islands, giant multi-ton stones are levitated by sound waves. ""Experts"" from various conspiracy journals lead the gullible and self-deluded to swallow just about any fish tale you might want to dream up, I didn't even find it entertaining, the weak claims were so wildly over-exaggerated.",1446508800,,883,5.452554744525547
6497962,5,B00LPD0EVG,"I remember as a kid Time Life books used to advertise a series called Ancient Mysteries, yes this is way back when people actually used to call toll free numbers to order books of all things, forget about videos (maybe VHS). Anyway I think that Ancient Aliens has taken alot of the theories and ideas of many of those old shows and series and has run away with them (in a good way). I collect the series in part just to see how Georgio's hair gets wilder from season to season, but seriously even if you don't believe all of the interviewees conclusions, the footage and locations are worth having this series in your collection, by far one of my favorite shows and best shows on television ( in my opinion).!",1443830400,,709,4.419847328244275

As others have commented these episodes, like other seasons, tend to retread some material. But, if you are collecting them pay the money and add it to your collection! I don't necessarily believe the conclusions of many of the interviewed researchers--some episodes are really reaching for straws--not everything unexplainable ""clearly"" involved aliens, ancient or otherwise.

6498031,5,B00LPD0EVG,"Some may call Ancient Aliens far-fetched but no one can accuse it of not being well thought out and entertaining. I find it interesting how the show can take pretty much any subject and somehow tie it in to the ""Ancient Alien Theory"".

Here we have the first eight episodes of Season 6. The episodes are new but some of them retread past themes and gives you a feeling of deju vu. You would think that with the recycled footage the show uses it would be saving enough money and wouldn't have to resort to splitting up the seasons into two volumes in order to obviously increase profits.

The first eight episodes of Season 6 are evenly spread across two dvds and are as follows...

Disc One:
01 Aliens and Forbidden Islands
02 Aliens and the Lost Ark
03 Aliens and Mysterious Mountains
04 Aliens and Stargates

Disc Two:
05 Aliens in America
06 The Star Children
07 Treasures of the Gods
08 Aliens and the Red Planet

Video: The episodes are presented in a solid 1:78 anamorphic widescreen transfer.

Audio: The only audio track on this set is English 5.1 Dolby Digital. It is clear sounding and I have no complaints

Subtitles: There are English SDH and Spanish subtitles.

Extras: None",1426204800,15,1187,4.566037735849057
6498032,5,B00LPD0EVG,"This series (which I think is poorly titled) gives an overview of many  curiousities  that have been left as a part of the historical record.  It poses many provocative questions....and for me, more importantly, takes their cameras to these places with experts (sometimes theorists) to discuss the implications.

6498111,5,B00LPD0EVG,"I just received season 6 vol1. I have all of the seasons and already pre-ordered the next volume. I find them fascinating. My theory is this; I don't believe we were visited in the past by extraterrestrials. I truly believe that the ancient aliens were us. I believe these ancient civilizations existed tens of thousands of years ago. They advanced far more technologically then we are today. But for some unknown reason, maybe the population could no longer be sustained by earths resources and the earth cleansed itself. All the oceans covered past land masses and new land appeared where oceans were. History just keeps repeating itself. We excavate and find these highly intelligent civilizations but they are us. If we could excavate a mile below the oceans floor I bet my theory would be correct. And one day in the far future, it will happen again. Thousands of years in the future someone will dig in the earth and find some of our inventions and wonder if we were gods. Enjoy ancient aliens. But keep an open mind. I also enjoyed meeting georgio big hair on 12-21-12. He was on bourbon street in New Orleans.",1416096000,10,1117,4.704081632653061

6498118,5,B00LPD0EVG,"Arrived well packaged and in bubble wrap (which is more than I can say for the last set of DVD's I ordered. And I bought those through Amazon too!). Love this show, even though a good bit of it is pretty farfetched. At least this show relies on actual historical and archeological evidence. You know, real places and things. (Take that Honey Boo Boo and Duck Dynasty!)

Yes, Ancient Aliens actually challenges me to see things in a different perspective, even if I may not believe it wholeheartedly. It keeps me open and creative to the possibilities that life has to offer. The content may cause skepticism in me at times, but that's okay. Its what brings beauty to my world and a smile to my face.

And, everybody else may come back just for your hair, George Tsoukalous, but if I ever get the chance to meet you for real, I am waiting for the moment your face lights up as you speak with the strength of your convictions!

And with that, I will close with saying that Honey Boo Boos sister can keep her definition of what 'vows' are. Duck Dynasty can keep their beards. I am stuck on something that truly is out of this world!",1414972800,3,1129,4.392344497607655

6498120,5,B00LPD0EVG,"Another fabulous series of what you've never been told! I've got the whole series (so far) and it's all great! I get to travel all over the world and and see things I would never get to see otherwise, and some places that the general public is not admitted. I love this whole series!!",1414972800,,284,4.277777777777778
6498121,5,B00LPD0EVG,Love the series.  So this was a MUST-Have,1414800000,,41,4.125
6498122,5,B00LPD0EVG,"The fact that people believe in aliens is a fascinating subject. It brings up a lot of questions and makes you think, can it be true? That makes the show fun to watch.",1414454400,,167,4.090909090909091
6498123,3,B00LPD0EVG,"I would like to give two reviews one for the season and one for the actual release.  As others have mentioned which must be repeated you are getting 8 episodes of Season 6 which in reality had 19 episodes.  If you look at the airing dates of the show and breaks the Sixth Season really began with the ""Power of Three"" on September 30, 2013.  There was more than a five month break between Power of Three and the last episode of Season 5 so how can Power of Three be part of Season 5? I still have all the AA DVD sets but this is nothing more than greed in dividing the sets and changing episodes from one season to another season.  Season 6 really is Power of Three up to Alien Breeders.  Season 7 which is resuming on Halloween 2014 really started on July 25 is now considered to be part of AA season 6 volume 2.  We now know that Season 6 Volume 2 will go from Aliens and Insects through Aliens and Superheroes.

We remember that Season 3 had 16 episodes and all were included in 4 discs.  Now people are paying full price for essentially half the episodes.  This set like all Liongate releases won't include individual chapters for each episode which was helpful in the earlier releases (season 1-4).  There is no bonus material,interviews, or deleted scenes.  Subtitles are a decent addition, but do you care for all that shameless Liongate advertising. The only bonus ever provided was Season 1 that included the original Pilot which meant that people like me who bought the pilot paid twice for it when it came in Season 1.

I do think Season 6 which i believe is the 19 episodes that runs through Power of Three through Alien Breeders is in my opinion the best AA season since Season 2.  This set includes interesting topics as  Stargates, Ancient Treasures, Lost Ark, Starchildren,  Forbidden Islands, Mysterious Mountains, Aliens in America, and Aliens and the Red Planet. The Cinematography is among the best the show has had and the topics interesting even if you don't agree with most of the theories.  I think this material is more compelling than Season 4 and 5 which included nonsensical filler topics as Bigfoot, Einstein Factor, and Von Daniken Legacy.

Good news is that AA will be back for more episodes October 31 and hopefully they can make the next release better for those who buy these sets.  There should be more offered than having someone simply burn DVR copies of these episodes.

6498144,5,B00LPD0EVG,"I love this show. If your in to the more tame end of alternative thinking you will love it too. I think the best thing it has going, as some times they get way off track , is the places they take you to during the show. So many unexplained places that just amaze. Just a really fun and entertaining experience even if you don't agree with the talking heads of the program. Humanity is much much older than you were taught in school. My take on a lot of it as I have no doubts of extraterrestrial existence , is the ancient advanced races of humans or other beings that have been washed away by time. Check it out if your new to it. Sit back with a cup of coffee and enjoy. Even good for family viewing I'd say.",1414195200,11,710,4.042553191489362

Disk 1 starts with at least 10 advertisements, so the ""Pawn Star Channel"" is starting to put their inane advertisements on their DVD's. It's just an irritation because there's always the fast forward.... But the nerve!!!!! I paid for Ancient Aliens, not advertisements.",1414022400,40,383,5.0
