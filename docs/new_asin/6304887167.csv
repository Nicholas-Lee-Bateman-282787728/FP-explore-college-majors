7879511,5,6304887167,"I bought this video a long time ago (even before it was available through Amazon!) and I keep watching it over and over again.
It even made me go to Manu in 2000.
Kim MacQuarrie gives you an amazing view of the richness of Per's amazing nature and the work of the scientists over there, plus an insight into the world of the native people and the threats they encounter.
Jennie Muskett's music is enchanting.
Watch this video and you'll get hooked to the rainforest.",1314230400,,466,4.4941176470588236
7879512,5,6304887167,"Saw this film while in Manu National Park in Peru, so wanted to buy a copy. It won two Emmys
and remains one of the best feature documentaries on the rainforest that I've ever seen. And
interesting mix of scientists, wildlife, and the native Indians who live in the reserve.",1269129600,,274,4.5
