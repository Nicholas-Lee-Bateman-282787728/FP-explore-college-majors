2968330,3,B000WG97YW,"This is an animated film, but not necessarily for children -- there is a sequence involving an artist's woman model in the nude, though handled without titilation.  A ho-hum story line about treating everybody as equals, but what kept me watching was the beautiful use of colors.",1378512000,,279,4.9361702127659575
2968331,3,B000WG97YW,"I'd imagine that most American critics will be tripping over themselves to sing the praises of this visually stunning French animated film.  Hey, it's got a great premise AND it's subtitled, so what's not to like?

Quite a few things, unfortunately.  But first, the good: this film's terrific and unusual style literally feels like a painting come to life.  A handful of scenes also blend more realistic CGI and live action footage with the colorful CGI characters in a convincing, surreal manner.  The story itself features a number of interesting allegories, especially the representation of class division based on appearance (sketches, half-finished drawings and finished characters), which could be substitued with the race/culture/relgion of your choice.  At the end of the day, it has a good message that, thankfully, isn't just aimed directly at kids.  Most American audiences equate all animation with children's movies, and I'm glad films like ""The Painting"" exist to prove otherwise.

So why didn't I like it more?  The allegories are, at times, heavy-handed and a bit too obvious.  Two of the central characters are of different ""class"" but fall in love (talk about predictable), and the film feels padded even at less than 80 minutes.  The ending also falls flat, closing on a half-note that would feel more appropriate in a short 7-8 minute production, not a feature-length film like this.

Two other complaints, sadly, stem directly from this Blu-ray/DVD combo pack.  The dialogue at times is a bit corny, but mainly because the English subtitles are simply a port of the optional English dub track.  They're not a more literal translation of the original French audio (also included), which is unfotunate.  I almost feel like I can't give ""The Painting"" a fair and objective review because of this...but since I don't speak fluent French, I can only make do with what we get.

As for the A/V quality and extras, they're fairly good.  The 1.78:1 transfer looks crisp and colorful with minimal problems; there's some moderate banding during at least one sequence, but it's not overly distracting.  Non-music surround effects sound flat at times, but there are moments when they create a convincing atmosphere.  Extras consist of a 34-minute behind-the-scenes featurette, a self-playing art gallery and the film's trailer.  Not bad for a lesser-known French import.

So ""The Painting"" is still enjoyable from a visual standpoint...but like many modern animated films, the story doesn't consistently reach the same level.  It's still worth a look for animation fans 13 and up, as I doubt younger kids will really get much out of it.  There's also brief artistic nudity, mild language and one or two violent (not gory) scenes, if that makes a difference to you.",1377129600,13,2772,5.111111111111111
2968332,5,B000WG97YW,"This is another gem in the series of foreign animated films from GKIDS being distributed by Cinedigm. Starting with the fabulous ""Chico & Rita"" (a must for fans of Latin jazz) and moving on through ""The Rabbi's Cat"", the films (which I urge you to get on Bluray) are a joy to behold. Though ""Chico and Rita"" will probably remain my favorite ""The Painting "" by French animator Jean-Francois Laguionie may be the most artistically beautiful. I recently bought a new Hi-def TV and the Bluray discs I've been watching lately have been great but the brilliant colors in this 78-minutefilm blew everything else away! It's that captivating.

The ""plot"" of the film is how characters on a large canvas in an artist's studio actually are part of a caste system. There are the ""Allduns"" (fully finished), the ""Halfies"" (the characters that the artist has not yet finished) and the ""Sketchies"" (the ones which are only a pale outline).  As a parable on modern society, we see the first group as the ""wealthy"", the second as the ""middle class"" and the third as the ""downtrodden"". Trust me, it will all make sense.  You might find yourself - as I was - so enraptured by the artwork (which uses CGI graphics along with - in a few cases - real images) that you lose the story line and have to go back and watch the film again.

Unlike many of the other GKIDS, this film has an English audio track (as well as the original French one with subtitles), this works great.

There are a few bonus features including a 10-minute ""Concept Art Slideshow"" to a music score and a 30-minute-plus ""Making of Featurette"". I was really looking forward to the latter but haven't made it through that yet because it is in French with subtitles. This would be fine but the subtitles are in small print (even on my 40"" screen TV - and in white lettering which is often hard to read because some of the scenes have a white background! (This has been an issue on a few of the GKIDS bonus featurettes.

But even with the problem of reading the ""Making of"" featurette, this Bluray gets five stars from me. It's truly an animated ""work of art"", which, of course, is appropriate, given its title.

The combo pack includes both the BD and a DVD copy.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

2968333,5,B000WG97YW,"Easy to see what he is doing, as he does it, step-by-step.  Covers the entire process, from beginning to the end.  Easy to follow and understand.  Much better than most of the other painting videos I have collected over the years.  He is one of my favorite artists. I learned serveral useful concepts and techniques just from this one video.  My favorite, was about how to paint the leaves, and how to flow in the color.  I just love the realistic way in which he paraphrases nature.  It inspired me to get out my paints and give it a try, which resulted in a beautiful work of art I would be happy to give to anyone as a gift.  The fact that I was able to join his blog and interact with him and other artists was an additional bonus.  I would highly recommend this instructional video to anyone interested in watercolor.",1374883200,9,822,4.355263157894737
2968334,5,B000WG97YW,"Just brilliant. The visual style is unequalled: hand drawing and wet media meet computerized rendering in a uncommonly successful merger. The social message is about tolerance at many levels, to the point that skin color is the least of the issues. Characters have some depth (maybe not all that much, but some) and really make you want to like them.

But, at least one serious irony inflicts itself, and in multiple ways. The Alldunns, the self-proclaimed higher caste who identify themselves by their fine rendering, elevate themselves above the mostly-finished halfies, and everyone abhors the loosely-drawn Sketchies. Well, declaring yourself superior based on some trait over which no one has any control is human enough. In this case, though, the loose and painterly style even of the Allduns looks like kindergarten scribbles compared to the hyper-realists of the 1970s and 80s, or even to the oil masters of every century up until this. For them to declare degree of finish to be degree of value simply devalues themselves, when taken in the wider context of what painting can be.

And, in a second irony, I think of Rembrandt's etchings. Central characters appear in passionate detail. Just a few inches away, minor character fade out to circle faces, dot eyes, and lines for mouths - if that. Rembrandt used degree of finish as a way to direct the viewer's attention - ""Here, this matters, there's a lot to look at."" The more loosely drawn characters don't detract from the composition, they define it. They are equal members in Rembrandt's compositions, and I do not feel qualified to dispute Rembrandt's judgement in creating effective imagery. I do feel qualified to defend every level of detail in his renderings - loss of any would be a loss for all.

So, I love the imagery (except for some of the motion, but I quibble). I like the in-your-face message about equality, even if Dr. Seuss's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sneetches/dp/0394800893/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sneetches</a>&nbsp;said it more directly. And I like the rich visual style. I find a few points not so much to my liking, but that's just life. My highes recommendation, for anyone who wants a bit more from their animations.

I must say that in an age where majority of movies are purchased through streaming, it was refreshing to purchase not only a quality DVD in a quality case, but one with quality content. I watched this with my two year old son - he enjoyed the animation, and I enjoyed the various messages within the film. The charactors are all seemingly abandoned by their creator, ""The Painter"", each members of one of three class systems depending on how far The Painter came to completing them.  This resulted in a class system and the inherent topics surrounding it. Depicting various artistic styles and the ideas that arose as humanity questioned their existence during these particular eras,  this film is part art history, part entertainment, and entirely purposeful. Self determination, inequality, and the search for meaning, or rather, what truely determines meaning, are some the topics that exist in this film, and within society since societies began. This film is one which can easily be watched and pondered more than once, is great for adults and children, and when purchased as a DVD, provides the quality oft missing in the age of streaming.",1468886400,5,1216,4.955882352941177

Watch the French dub for the original experience, but the English dub has some great voice-actors too and is well worth your time.
The story is intriguing, and while some parts don't really get resolved and the plot does drag occasionally, it is an excellent commentary about imposed social restrictions, prejudice bordering on a sort-of racism and that eternal quest for understand one's own place in the world.

2968367,4,B000WG97YW,"This beautiful, thematically complex animated French film centers around a painting that holds characters who live and breathe as you and me: the Alldunns, who are finished characters who live in splendor and label themselves rulers of the land; the Halfies, whose colors were never fully painted in by the artist (the lower middle class, if you will); and the Sketchies, those who are but rough drawings never fully realized by their creator.  When an Alldunn falls for a Halfie, upsetting authority, an Alldunn, a Halfie and a Sketchie all go on a quest to find the painter, in the hopes he or she will finish them all, making everyone in their world equal.

2968387,4,B000WG97YW,"The world of The Painting is a riot of color & imagination -- but not all of its inhabitants are complete. The Alldunns are finished figures, opulent & very full of themselves & their sense of natural superiority; the Halfies, lacking some color, are second-class citizens; and the poor Sketchies, little more than rough line drawings, are fair game for the cruelty of the Alldunns. Thus far, an obvious allegory of social status, as well as a satire of religious snobbery & intolerance, as evidenced by the leader of the Alldunns, the Great Chandelier, who claims The Painter is never coming back & thus he, the Great Chandelier, should speak for Him.

But what happens when a young man of the Alldunns falls in love with a lovely Halfie girl?

Since this isn't a Hollywood film, the story takes some unexpected turns. The young Alldunn is determined to find The Painter -- but when he flees through the Forbidden Forest of the Death Flowers, it's not with his beloved, but with her best friend, as well as a Sketchie. And when they emerge from The Painting into The Painter's studio, some interesting philosophical & theological questions are raised. The love story is a real plot thread, but an increasingly minor one as the film progresses.

I won't spoil the rest of the story for anyone. Instead, let me praise this beautifully animated film for actually making inventive use of computer graphics, not to mention its welcome lack of fleeting pop culture references. The only culture referenced here is the rich history of painting. While certainly an all-ages film, there's no dumbing down for children, who are given credit for being intelligent viewers along with the adults. And the final scene is pleasingly inconclusive & open-ended, as is life itself for anyone who seeks his or her own answers to the Big Questions.

2968394,5,B000WG97YW,"This is a treasure chest of animation delights. The filmmakers borrow from Manet, Gauguin, Modigliani, Picasso, and others  to create a fascinating set of universes - one where the characters of the main painting are able to leave the canvas and visit the other worlds of pictures done by the same artist in different styles.  Just about every reviewer will comment on how stunning the film looks - because it is a moving painting in a riot of colors.

In the first canvas, there are characters that have been fully painted, some partly painted, and some just sketched out. The plot is intriguing in which the Alldones believe themselves to be the superior race, reject the Halfies, and truly persecute the Sketchies  (Is this France under the Vichy regime?).  Of course, when one of the Alldones falls in love with a Halfie, he creates waves of discord from his group...but he insists on following true love.  Of all the characters, the one I liked most was the Sketchie, perhaps because he has the most ""humanity.""  He carries a bag with the broken body of a Sketchie who was once his friend.

The quest begins -  to find the original painter and ask him a favor.  The rebels want to ask him to fill in the colors for all the personalities in the main painting so that all can be equal.  However, when the dissident group does locate him, the man offers his own views of art which are far less simplistic.

There are lots of ideas in this film...so it is definitely something to share with children over 7 years old. Indeed the film may ignite their imagination to create their own unique visual styles.",1385251200,5,1605,4.5929824561403505

3202828,3,B000WG97YW,"I'd imagine that most American critics will be tripping over themselves to sing the praises of this visually stunning French animated film.  Hey, it's got a great premise AND it's subtitled, so what's not to like?

Quite a few things, unfortunately.  But first, the good: this film's terrific and unusual style literally feels like a painting come to life.  A handful of scenes also blend more realistic CGI and live action footage with the colorful CGI characters in a convincing, surreal manner.  The story itself features a number of interesting allegories, especially the representation of class division based on appearance (sketches, half-finished drawings and finished characters), which could be substitued with the race/culture/relgion of your choice.  At the end of the day, it has a good message that, thankfully, isn't just aimed directly at kids.  Most American audiences equate all animation with children's movies, and I'm glad films like ""The Painting"" exist to prove otherwise.

So why didn't I like it more?  The allegories are, at times, heavy-handed and a bit too obvious.  Two of the central characters are of different ""class"" but fall in love (talk about predictable), and the film feels padded even at less than 80 minutes.  The ending also falls flat, closing on a half-note that would feel more appropriate in a short 7-8 minute production, not a feature-length film like this.

Two other complaints, sadly, stem directly from this Blu-ray/DVD combo pack.  The dialogue at times is a bit corny, but mainly because the English subtitles are simply a port of the optional English dub track.  They're not a more literal translation of the original French audio (also included), which is unfotunate.  I almost feel like I can't give ""The Painting"" a fair and objective review because of this...but since I don't speak fluent French, I can only make do with what we get.

As for the A/V quality and extras, they're fairly good.  The 1.78:1 transfer looks crisp and colorful with minimal problems; there's some moderate banding during at least one sequence, but it's not overly distracting.  Non-music surround effects sound flat at times, but there are moments when they create a convincing atmosphere.  Extras consist of a 34-minute behind-the-scenes featurette, a self-playing art gallery and the film's trailer.  Not bad for a lesser-known French import.

So ""The Painting"" is still enjoyable from a visual standpoint...but like many modern animated films, the story doesn't consistently reach the same level.  It's still worth a look for animation fans 13 and up, as I doubt younger kids will really get much out of it.  There's also brief artistic nudity, mild language and one or two violent (not gory) scenes, if that makes a difference to you.",1377129600,13,2772,5.111111111111111
3202829,5,B000WG97YW,"This is another gem in the series of foreign animated films from GKIDS being distributed by Cinedigm. Starting with the fabulous ""Chico & Rita"" (a must for fans of Latin jazz) and moving on through ""The Rabbi's Cat"", the films (which I urge you to get on Bluray) are a joy to behold. Though ""Chico and Rita"" will probably remain my favorite ""The Painting "" by French animator Jean-Francois Laguionie may be the most artistically beautiful. I recently bought a new Hi-def TV and the Bluray discs I've been watching lately have been great but the brilliant colors in this 78-minutefilm blew everything else away! It's that captivating.

The ""plot"" of the film is how characters on a large canvas in an artist's studio actually are part of a caste system. There are the ""Allduns"" (fully finished), the ""Halfies"" (the characters that the artist has not yet finished) and the ""Sketchies"" (the ones which are only a pale outline).  As a parable on modern society, we see the first group as the ""wealthy"", the second as the ""middle class"" and the third as the ""downtrodden"". Trust me, it will all make sense.  You might find yourself - as I was - so enraptured by the artwork (which uses CGI graphics along with - in a few cases - real images) that you lose the story line and have to go back and watch the film again.

Unlike many of the other GKIDS, this film has an English audio track (as well as the original French one with subtitles), this works great.

There are a few bonus features including a 10-minute ""Concept Art Slideshow"" to a music score and a 30-minute-plus ""Making of Featurette"". I was really looking forward to the latter but haven't made it through that yet because it is in French with subtitles. This would be fine but the subtitles are in small print (even on my 40"" screen TV - and in white lettering which is often hard to read because some of the scenes have a white background! (This has been an issue on a few of the GKIDS bonus featurettes.

But even with the problem of reading the ""Making of"" featurette, this Bluray gets five stars from me. It's truly an animated ""work of art"", which, of course, is appropriate, given its title.

The combo pack includes both the BD and a DVD copy.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

3202831,5,B000WG97YW,"Just brilliant. The visual style is unequalled: hand drawing and wet media meet computerized rendering in a uncommonly successful merger. The social message is about tolerance at many levels, to the point that skin color is the least of the issues. Characters have some depth (maybe not all that much, but some) and really make you want to like them.

But, at least one serious irony inflicts itself, and in multiple ways. The Alldunns, the self-proclaimed higher caste who identify themselves by their fine rendering, elevate themselves above the mostly-finished halfies, and everyone abhors the loosely-drawn Sketchies. Well, declaring yourself superior based on some trait over which no one has any control is human enough. In this case, though, the loose and painterly style even of the Allduns looks like kindergarten scribbles compared to the hyper-realists of the 1970s and 80s, or even to the oil masters of every century up until this. For them to declare degree of finish to be degree of value simply devalues themselves, when taken in the wider context of what painting can be.

And, in a second irony, I think of Rembrandt's etchings. Central characters appear in passionate detail. Just a few inches away, minor character fade out to circle faces, dot eyes, and lines for mouths - if that. Rembrandt used degree of finish as a way to direct the viewer's attention - ""Here, this matters, there's a lot to look at."" The more loosely drawn characters don't detract from the composition, they define it. They are equal members in Rembrandt's compositions, and I do not feel qualified to dispute Rembrandt's judgement in creating effective imagery. I do feel qualified to defend every level of detail in his renderings - loss of any would be a loss for all.

So, I love the imagery (except for some of the motion, but I quibble). I like the in-your-face message about equality, even if Dr. Seuss's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sneetches/dp/0394800893/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sneetches</a>&nbsp;said it more directly. And I like the rich visual style. I find a few points not so much to my liking, but that's just life. My highes recommendation, for anyone who wants a bit more from their animations.

3202884,4,B000WG97YW,"The world of The Painting is a riot of color & imagination -- but not all of its inhabitants are complete. The Alldunns are finished figures, opulent & very full of themselves & their sense of natural superiority; the Halfies, lacking some color, are second-class citizens; and the poor Sketchies, little more than rough line drawings, are fair game for the cruelty of the Alldunns. Thus far, an obvious allegory of social status, as well as a satire of religious snobbery & intolerance, as evidenced by the leader of the Alldunns, the Great Chandelier, who claims The Painter is never coming back & thus he, the Great Chandelier, should speak for Him.

But what happens when a young man of the Alldunns falls in love with a lovely Halfie girl?

Since this isn't a Hollywood film, the story takes some unexpected turns. The young Alldunn is determined to find The Painter -- but when he flees through the Forbidden Forest of the Death Flowers, it's not with his beloved, but with her best friend, as well as a Sketchie. And when they emerge from The Painting into The Painter's studio, some interesting philosophical & theological questions are raised. The love story is a real plot thread, but an increasingly minor one as the film progresses.

I won't spoil the rest of the story for anyone. Instead, let me praise this beautifully animated film for actually making inventive use of computer graphics, not to mention its welcome lack of fleeting pop culture references. The only culture referenced here is the rich history of painting. While certainly an all-ages film, there's no dumbing down for children, who are given credit for being intelligent viewers along with the adults. And the final scene is pleasingly inconclusive & open-ended, as is life itself for anyone who seeks his or her own answers to the Big Questions.

3202888,5,B000WG97YW,I really enjoyed this animation. I like the fact that this film makes you think. I watched with my 10 years old daughter and she also enjoyed with a good lesson in her own way.,1389139200,,176,4.057142857142857
3202889,4,B000WG97YW,"I saw this film with my children. I am a cinefile and I want my children to grow appreciating the seventh art. Well, they loved it and love the characters, the colors and everything about it.",1388966400,,191,4.333333333333333
3202890,5,B000WG97YW,"I love this movie. The animation is so original and beautiful and the tale, if a bit moralistic, is charming as well. The story is good for everyone, children and adults, with the caveat that there are some paintings portraying nudity.(I would have no problem showing that to children, myself).  One wonders how it can possibly end, and this artist pulls it off - so poignant and novel an ending, so satisfying Very droll, his caricatures of Matisse and other artists. I would be interested to see more of this man's work, his art is extraordinary.",1385856000,,548,4.708333333333333
3202891,5,B000WG97YW,"This is a treasure chest of animation delights. The filmmakers borrow from Manet, Gauguin, Modigliani, Picasso, and others  to create a fascinating set of universes - one where the characters of the main painting are able to leave the canvas and visit the other worlds of pictures done by the same artist in different styles.  Just about every reviewer will comment on how stunning the film looks - because it is a moving painting in a riot of colors.

In the first canvas, there are characters that have been fully painted, some partly painted, and some just sketched out. The plot is intriguing in which the Alldones believe themselves to be the superior race, reject the Halfies, and truly persecute the Sketchies  (Is this France under the Vichy regime?).  Of course, when one of the Alldones falls in love with a Halfie, he creates waves of discord from his group...but he insists on following true love.  Of all the characters, the one I liked most was the Sketchie, perhaps because he has the most ""humanity.""  He carries a bag with the broken body of a Sketchie who was once his friend.

The quest begins -  to find the original painter and ask him a favor.  The rebels want to ask him to fill in the colors for all the personalities in the main painting so that all can be equal.  However, when the dissident group does locate him, the man offers his own views of art which are far less simplistic.

There are lots of ideas in this film...so it is definitely something to share with children over 7 years old. Indeed the film may ignite their imagination to create their own unique visual styles.",1385251200,5,1605,4.5929824561403505

3202893,4,B000WG97YW,"Visually stunning! The plot line is familiar.  Boy meets girl, their romance forbidden by social class differences.  The setting is surrealistic. They all live in a painting!  Social class differences are due to how completely painted the individuals are.  The boy goes on a quest with other social outcasts.  Their journey takes them out of their painting and into other paintings looking for ""The Artist.""  Film sends message about consequences of prejudice based superficial differences.  Parental Guidance alert . . . there is a partially nude painting.",1378771200,,557,5.333333333333333

However, while the animation is certainly worth watching, I recall the story as being ... not so hot.

The music was night and it was a good plot, maybe not the most gripping in terms of suspense but good none there less. I would recommend this for anyone who wants something a little different from your typical everyday American/Disney animated film (which I often love) but this was a breath of fresh air.",1495324800,2,424,4.592105263157895
