4545530,5,B0053O8A8M,"Give me your hands
Show me the door
I cannot stand
To wait anymore
Somebody said
Be what you'll be
We could be old and cold and dead on the sea

But I love you more than words can say
I can't count the reasons I should stay

Give me some rope
Tie me to dream
Give me the hope to run out of steam
Somebody said it can be here
We could be roped up, tied up, dead in a year

I can't count the reasons I should stay
One by one they all just fade away

I'm tied to the wait and sees
I'm tired of that part of me
That makes up a perfect lie
To keep us between
But hours turn into days
So watch what you throw away
And be here to recognize
There's another way

Give me some rope
Tie me to dream
Give me the hope to run out of steam
Somebody said it can be here
We could be roped up, tied up, dead in a year

But I love you more than words can say
I can't count the reasons I should stay
One by one they all just fade away
Oh I love you more than words can say...",1327363200,9,955,3.5454545454545454

4545532,5,B0053O8A8M,"This show is seriously one of the best shows on tv now. It is the comedic successor of arrested development; it contains all the wit, play on words, intelligent and observational humour that arrested development had. Unfortunantly because this show doesn't have a laugh track and requires some thought to enjoy it isn't getting the attention it deserves.

It takes numerous views to get most of the jokes and after watching the first two seasons at least 4-5 times I still catch things I've missed. It's hilarious, the acting is superb, the attention to detail is astounding, and the writing is at another level. Preorder this and I guarantee you won't be disappointed.

Here's hoping for 6 seasons and a movie.",1325548800,62,711,4.867768595041323
4545533,2,B0053O8A8M,"Like all good things, Community has appeared to come to an end.

The first two seasons were fantastic.  So far, I can't even watch the entire episodes of season 3.  The only absolutely stunning episode was the apartment episode with the multiple universes.  That was amazing.  The rest are just awful.

I'm very sad, Community is literally the only sitcom I can stomach and it's gone down hill so fast.",1321833600,,402,4.671428571428572
4545534,5,B0053O8A8M,"Everything about the first two seasons was top notch. The acting, writing, and directing just continued to get better and better as the story unfolded. It's safe to say that this is STILL the case with the third season of this critically acclaimed comedy!

The writers are taking the excellence of this show very seriously, and it has already paid off in spades for fans. This season, they've truly gone all in, and its easy to see why: This is re-writing all the rules about what a TV comedy can accomplish within 22 minutes. It's smart, hilarious, edgy (and even a little weird - but in a good way). I hope that by the end of this season it'll no longer be the most underrated comedy on TV today, and will begin to gain the popularity that it's deserved for the past three seasons.",1318723200,98,783,4.4375

That is the packaging. I've paid a bit for brand new (for a season one.) and I expected it to be, well in great condition. But it wasn't. There were dents, close to dog eats, and the corners were damage. Sure I could have return and get a better quality. BUT this was a gift for someone. I just can't take it back.
That's the only thing I really got to complain about. Just how it was presented for the amount of money I paid for it.

4545651,5,B0053O8A8M,"Another brilliant season from Dan Harmon and the Community writers. Outside of season 2, this may be the best. You can watch this season from episode 1 through the end and enjoy every episode, which is unusual for most comedies today.

Remedial Chaos Theory (episode 4) is beyond genius. The Law & Order homage/spoof (episode 17) is so well done that even new watchers can appreciate it. Although if you've never seen an episode of Community, go back (at least) to Season 2 and start from there, you'll be happy you did. With the exception of Documentary Filmmaking: Redux (episode 8), because Jim Rash's performance might just transcend everything.  And you get a dose of Luis Guzman for good measure.

This is a great comedy staple, buy it.",1424476800,,742,4.78125

From the hilarious back-and-forth between the Greendale ""Seven"" family, to the posters lining the walls, there are just so many small details that make this show one of the greatest on television (soon to be online).

Once again, a commentary on every track, though some of them are a bit tedious, like where Dino (star burns) makes a few phone calls, and some of the commentary was rushed through before the episodes were even complete, or before Dan Harmon's hangover was complete. These are minor bumps in the road of a very rewarding season, with great extras. I hope they tide you over till Season 5 (and the couple ok episodes of Season 4).",1383091200,,510,4.554347826086956

4545808,5,B0053O8A8M,"This is my all-time favorite show, and this season has most of my favorite episodes. It's crazier than the first two seasons, and some people don't like that as well, but for me, it's great. I love that they do a lot of nutty things, but they don't really try to tell you that the impossible things are real. I don't like having to suspend disbelief in a TV show that is ostensibly about reality (albeit weird reality), and it's great that they are able to tweak things to take a different look in a plausible (although unlikely) way. I laughed out loud over and over during this season, and I wish this show could last forever. It has such a passionate fan following, and the actors are amazingly warm toward their fans in appearances I've seen. They seem to truly, truly love being part of the show. I truly, truly love being part of the audience. It's not just funny; it's warm and it's important. It's community. Truly.",1381881600,,923,4.4674556213017755
4545809,4,B0053O8A8M,"It's the group's third year at Greendale Community College and once again their attempts to get good grades are threatened by their flamboyant Dean, the mentally unstable Chang (now unwisely made part of the college's security force) and a new threat in the form of Vice Dean Laybourne, head of the Air Conditioning Repair Annex, who now seeks to take control of the college for himself.

After the second season of Community, which featured an overload of classic, high-concept episodes and an internal battle between the other members of the group and Pierce, it was unclear which direction the third season would go in. For the first couple of episodes, it's clear the producers don't either. The addition of John Goodman (as Laybourne) and Michel K. Williams as Professor Kane are good starts, but it's not until the third episode, Remedial Chaos Theory, that the show hits its former stride again. The Emmy and Hugo-nominated episode, which revisits the same events in six different timelines and cleverly comments on each character's place in the group in the process, is flat-out hilarious as well as being clever, and sets up a couple of recurring elements that are periodically revisited throughout the year.

However, despite this early high point, the third season remains patchy. The decision to tone Pierce down this season results in his near-total absence from many episodes. Without him in an adversarial role, the writers seem to struggle to find something plausible for him each week without him falling back on his traditional (and now rather tired) homophobia and casual racism. There is a potentially promising storyline when Pierce's ancient and even more horrific father arrives in town, allowing the writers to show how the group has made Pierce (relatively) more tolerant and understanding, but even this is under-explored.

In the meantime, we have yet more adventures with Chang being insane, which is getting old. Ken Jeong is funny enough that this - more or less - works, but you can't help feeling it's a bit of a cheap stand-by. Even worse is the decision to make Dean Pelton a regular character. This results in a lot of running gags and very broad comedy based around the fact that the Dean is gay, which feels odd for a series that spends so much time trying to avoid cliches. Having said that, the Dean's battle with his nemesis Laybourne does give the season a dramatic spine and a sense of direction.

Elsewhere, the performances of the regulars remain superb, individual gags are often hilarious and, after taking a back seat in Season 2, character development moves to the fore, with the show concentrating on Abed as an actual character than an ongoing commentary on what's happening in each episode. Annie, Shirley, Troy and Jeff also get good moments of character evolution throughout the season. On the flipside of that, Britta fares poorly, with the slight turn she took into 'dumb blonde' territory in Season 2 now turning into a full-scale character regression (so overt that it's even lampshaded at one point). It's a shame that a character who was an essential foil for Jeff in the first two seasons is now being treated as a hate figure by almost everyone.

In terms of the episodes, Remedial Chaos Theory is the undeniable high point, but other episodes are strong. Horror Fiction in Seven Spooky Steps, in which the gang tell horror stories (so Britta can try to work out which of them is a sociopath-in-the-making) is extremely amusing, especially Abed's remorselessly sensible and logical take on a horror movie narrative. The Ken Burns-influenced mid-season two-parter, which presents an epic blanket fort vs pillow fort war fought across the whole college (complete with detailed, animated maps of the battle lines and commentary from those involved), is another instant classic. Basic Lupine Urology isn't just a great episode, but also a phenomenal mickey-take of the Law and Order franchise (and Michael K. Williams gets to make a few references to his former role as Omar on The Wire, which takes place in the same fictional universe). Curriculum Unavailable tries to recast the events of the entire series with the study group being inmates at a mental institution, a successful satire of unconvincing 'plot twists' in long-running series. Digital Estate Planning, which forces the group to play an 8-bit video game, is almost as good as Remedial, with the video game being used to expose both rifts in the group (not to mention the Christian Shirley's suppressed homicidal streak) and encourage their cooperation as well.

Against this, there's probably a few too many episodes centred around the Dean and Chang, whose broad characterisations don't lend themselves too well to central roles in an ongoing series. There's also the feeling that Community's meta-awareness and commitment to avoiding cliche is too often turned into distinct smugness at its own cleverness. This is most notable in the first few episodes, before it calms down and just gets on with having fun again.

After the third season, Community wouldn't quite be the same again. Showrunner Dan Harmon was taken off the show for the fourth season (though he would return for the fifth) and Chevy Chase would depart in the following year.

The third season of Community (****) is relentlessly entertaining, very funny and often very clever. Where it falls down is not matching it own very high standards and occasionally getting too tangled up in its own desire to be funny whilst avoiding stereotypes, whilst not always having anything new or interesting for the characters to do (particularly Britta, Pierce, Chang and the Dean). But ultimately this is still one of the funniest shows on the air. The season is available on DVD in the UK and USA.",1381536000,2,5777,5.004162330905307

Does it restore the series to its former glory found in Season 1? Or does it dive into a sea of pretentious, relentless wackiness and over-the-top movie parodies like Season 2?

If you were to pose to me that question, there is no simple answer I could give you. Summing up Season 3 of Community is certainly difficult. It began with a booming, sensational musical number with all the characters we've grown to love and ended with a dark and complicated mess. With Season 3, I experienced some more of the major belly laughs that I constantly had while watching the first season and that I experienced maybe two or three of for the entirety of the second one. The first two or three episodes here was when most of these laughs arrived. As for the rest of the episodes? It's a bit of a mixed bag of episodes that were good-humored (albeit not hilarious), a few decent ones, a couple that were simply mediocre and at least four duds (or episodes that were trying so hard to be funny that they just came across as boring, uninspired and inane). Let's recap some of this season's moments: (SPOILERS FOLLOW - IF YOU HAVE NOT WATCHED ALL OF THESE EPISODES, DO NOT READ ON!)

- The soft, yet shrill scream that Abed seems to emit almost subconsciously when Cougarton Abbey, a spin-off of his favorite TV series Cougar Town, comes to an abrupt and tragic end. Absolutely hysterical!

- Shirley and Pierce attempting to start a sandwich shop in Greendale cafeteria, the dean takes their idea and gives it to the company of Subway who ends up opening the shop. The manager of this shop is a man directly from the company and who has been given the name Subway after the company erases his identification, documentation, etc. Britta falls madly in love with him (against the company's policy which states that he cannot have romantic affairs) and they meet in secret to make out, touch each others bodies, etc. At best, this is mildly amusing.

- The entire subplot involving the devious vice dean of the school's air-conditioning repair unit trying to drag Troy into their group against his will was...I don't even know. Seeing John Goodman play this character was interesting, but in the end it all came across as very silly (and in a pretentious way, not in a good way).

- Troy and Abed starting a war with each other in the school with blankets and pillows. The winner of this war has to tear down his fort (Abed's is a pillow fort, Troy's is a blanket one). These two episodes were quite the example of what I mean by when the show's later seasons occasionally try way too hard to be funny. I smiled at some moments of it like Abed's references to the Rambo movies. Other than that, I didn't laugh at all. And I was just shaking my head when Jeff had to retrieve the two nonexistent magical friendship hats and put them on Troy and Abed to get them to stop fighting at the end, that was so stupid.

The main problem I have with the later seasons of Community is how much this show has changed. It went from being a whimsical, dialogue-driven, light-hearted and occasionally wacky comedy in the beginning to this weird, bizarre, mind-bending and more mean-spirited comedy by Season 3's climax. Evil Abed taking over the real Abed and trying to kill Jeff in what was once a very light-hearted show made me very uncomfortable to say the least, that was way too dark and way too soon (if they had stepped up the darkness in the previous episodes little-by-little as they progressed until this episode was here, it may not have been so unsettling). As much as I never thought I would say it, maybe the fact that Dan Harmon was fired during Season 4 was the best thing for the show.

However, even for all of its occasional stupidity, mediocrity and jokes that were just plain unfunny, I cannot give this season as low of a rating as I gave the previous season. This is due to the fact that I definitely had a more fun time watching this one. 2 1/2 stars would probably be more appropriate, but Amazon does not allow such a rating. In conclusion, I will continue to watch this show simply on account of how even with all of its current flaws, Community seems to be the only series on broadcast television right now that is worth watching. Based on what I've heard regarding Season 4, I'm not exactly looking forward to sitting through it, but who knows? Could it be possible for the rest of the Community TV crew to cobble together enough good material to make Season 4 memorable without Harmon? I will have to see for myself.",1377043200,,5251,5.001144164759725

like far too many i discovered 'community' late (or early if one considers that oddballs like this are not broadcast on afn europe - besides which i don't even own an afn decoder).  in fact i cannot even remember how it was that i first heard about 'community', certainly no one i knew was talking about it,  however our little campus library is pretty hip and i soon found a copy.  i was hooked from the pilot on - it positively reeked o' genuinely creative writing!  and i truly believe that the first 2 seasons o' this wonderfully surreal series cannot be touch by anything currently airing (xcept by '30 rock'.......ok, maybe 'children's hospital'); however after the inspired opening song & dance o' s3 i actually found myself losing focus (and i honestly tried by checking this season out more than once)

the magic about the first 2 was they made everything seem effortless.  there was almost a perfect balance in seasons 1 & 2; but in s3 the show seems to be struggling to maintain its creative footing on the rich tapestry (which obviously fell on the floor to be walked on - duh) o' dan harmon's delightfully well-crafted 'meta' comedy, as this season seems more than a bit forced.  and with all the hullabaloo surrounding s4 i can only guess that the series is suffering from even greater creative fatigue

now having said that, i still believing season 3 o' 'community' stands head & shoulders above the VAST majority o' other so-called 'must-see' comedies.  and while i know 3 stars may not sound like much, it's still at least 2.5 more than i would give most o' the crap networks churn out just to get a person to watch their commercials;  and if anything i believe s3 midwifed two o' the most xcellent episodes in television history : 'pillow & blankets' and 'digital estate planning', both o' which highlight the sublime genius that was the hallmark o' so much o' the first 2 seasons

don't misunderstand, i will still purchase this season if only for those 2 episodes; and if i haven't made it obvious seasons 1 & 2 are absolutely ESSENTIAL purchases !",1371340800,,2318,4.626829268292683

4545856,5,B0053O8A8M,"Community is a great show. Its certainly my favorite show, and enough has been said about it that I won't repeat all that. I hold a personal connection with the show, and have been following it since the very first episode back in 2009, and have always loved it. The parody/spoof episodes, I feel, can often be the best episodes not just because of the heavy references and epic paintball bombs, but because they always managed to make it work within the elastic reality of the show, and often come out with some of the more dramatic and emotional moments the show has ever produced (AKA Claymation Christmas and My Dinner With Andre). However, this third season, to me, is simply perfect. Dan Harmon's serialized comedy experiment has worked so well, with the hokey air-conditioning repair school filled with laughs providing much of the Troy-Abed drama in a real and serious way. The timeline episode is the perfect concept episode, because its high concept and yet high emotional content simultaneously. The Halloween episode is a deep psyche examination along with skewering classic horror tropes. And the second half of the season, with the ramped up pillow fight and Chang takeover plot is a fitting climax for Dan Harmon's era, and it's very clear it was intended this way. The Law & Order episode is so spot its not even funny, and the Videogame and Heist episodes are similarly climactic, and the final of the season being Abed's own fragile mind is a spot on summation of the season's intimate dissection of him. Speaking of which, the Dreamatorium episode. Controversial in so many ways, but hands down and far and away my favorite episode of the entire series. Abed taken apart results in Abed becoming the members of the study group that has surrounded him for so long, and Annie being the one to rescue him from himself is so fitting it could have another episode devoted to it. This is all inherent to my argument that this show cannot be enjoyed fully jumping in the middle. You need to meet these characters as Jeff met them, grow cautious of them, and grow fond of them, for you to enjoy and appreciate the emotional places this season takes them all to. Its always hit the right emotional spot for me, and even though I'll watch the new seasons without Harmon, I'll always love this one the best.

4545857,5,B0053O8A8M,"This year we are treated to guest stars John Goodman, Michael Kenneth Williams and French Stewart. I missed John Glover but this season was still great. The change in Britta's character almost made her my new favorite character. My favorite is Annie. I thought Britta was hilarious. One of my favorite episodes was the Christmas episode. Alison Brie had a fun scene seducing Jeff while singing a funny Christmas song. Pierce's role in the show seems to lessen but he still makes his prescience felt in episodes like Advanced Gay, Basic Lupine Urology, Digital Estate Planning. The Halloween episode is great just like the previous season's episode. In this episode each member of the study group tells a spooky horror story and it's something fun to do on Halloween. In Pillows and Blankets the two inseparable buddies Troy and Abed are split in war. Things continue to put a strain on their relationship when Troy discovers he has special feelings for one of the girls in the study group. I found that story in this season interesting and exciting for the character of Troy. Another one of my personal favorite episodes was Foosball and Nocturnal Vigilantism. Jeff and Shirley discover they have a prior history that was not so good. It was a touching episode and further develops Jeff into a more likable character as we see the time he spent with the study group is changing him for the better. And of course there is the widely talented Ken Jeong playing a villain. He is good at that. Even Pierce who most of the time is a jerk and unlikable has some good moments. I was never so happy to hear there was a Season Four because I think this show is great. I love the humor and characters. I respect the fans of this show because they helped make this show last longer than a couple seasons by speaking out for the love of their show. I am so happy it got a fifth season. I am excited to see what is in store for the study group. I hope Community stays on the air for a long time.

1) Way too much Chang. Having a side character who, in my opinion, always had the stupidest humor take such a big role led to episodes filled with stupid humor in a series which was built on cleverer things.

2) Too much Abed. Now I am sure this is where I am going to lose some people. Abed is great, especially with Troy and the way their combined wackiness fits into the group. However, on his own he is either morbidly depressing or too far removed from the comedy aspect of the show. Especially morbid are the episodes in the dreamatorium. Also, bringing back evil Abed was just depressing. What I always loved about Community was that it would occasionally take a pop culture reference and work it into the on-goings at Greendale. That way it managed to have its own personality while parodying or commenting on various things. When entire episodes turn into parodies of those things though, it turns into just a low quality rip off.

3) Pushing the Dean into further ridiculousness. I enjoyed the dean in the first two seasons. He was a desperate, weird, oddball, leading a school which would never go anywhere. In season 3 though, most of what he does is dress in various women's outfits and emphasize his crush on Jeff.

4) The whole Troy and A/C school thing. Good for one episode but just not fun or interesting enough to keep bringing up.

I know Community fans are rabid and will, at best, ignore this review or, worse, start nasty comments. Keep in mind folks, I was one of you. I wish I still could be.

I compare to shows like Seinfeld where you could pick up from any show really and know what is happening, this show has a deffinate plot and character stories.  And its hilarious.

It's not just that Community is a great show, this particular episode is on a different level.  Not merely a string of jokes held together by a plot, t his episode is a finely crafted masterpiece.

If you haven't seen the episodes leading up to this one, I wouldn't just recommend jumping into the series with this episode.  The accumulated character development is important for the context of the episode, and I don't think it's possible to enjoy it quite as much without that context.

I just watched the episode again, for the 4th or 5th time.  I still marvel at it, each time being amazed that it can still have the same emotional effect on me that it did when I first saw it.",1359331200,2,792,4.503496503496503

4545964,5,B0053O8A8M,"Great cast. Consistently creative show. So many amazing episodes this season. To name a few: Regional Holiday Musical (Glee Parody), Remedial Chaos Theory (they play out six alternate story lines), Studies in Modern Movement (#anniemoves in with Troy and Abed), Pillows and Blankets (civil war documentary style coverage of a pillow/ blanket fort fight), and finally Digital Estate Planning (the study group plays a video game, with 8-bit versions of themselves). There were so many other great ones, but eventually I would just be listing the entire season three episode order.

The commentaries (for EVERY SINGLE EPISODE) are a great listen. The cast really seems to enjoy each other's company, and that's very apparent during the commentary.

Sad to see Dan Harmon go, but he left with an amazing season to show for his time on the show!!!",1359072000,,842,5.094202898550725

By this point in the series, the cast gels well together and has great on-screen chemistry.  The writing is sharp and the humor is top-notch.  Meta-references abound, as is Community's custom, and all the major players (and some of the minor players as well) get a chance to develop.  There are quite a few classic episodes in this season, including ""Horror Fiction in Seven Easy Steps"" and the classic Christmas episode that serves as a send-up of Glee, while also giving Alison Bree an excuse to dress up as a sexy Santa's helper.  Come to think of it, the Christmas episode alone justifies this purchase.",1357603200,,704,4.785123966942149

2. The commentaries are awesome. People on it are the people who you actually want to hear. joel McHale, Danny Pudi, Dan Harmon, everybody is on it.

4546041,3,B0053O8A8M,"I give the show itself, including this season, five stars.  The DVD, however, appears to reflect ongoing cost cutting against ""Community"" by Sony & NBC:

1.)  Much of the background music that played loud and clear on TV and Hulu is subdued or absent from the DVD episodes.  For example, the ""Dark Knight"" theme of Abed's Batman appearances in ""Foosball"" is gone.  Was this to keep licensing costs down?
2.)  There's just a smattering of deleted scenes and none of them have any text or commentary to establish context.
3.)  No extended episodes?  Not even for ""Remedial Chaos Theory"", which everyone agreed was a giant project that had to be whittled way down to fit into a half hour time slot?
4.)  On the commentary voice-overs the actors and writers frequently spend most of each episode making irrelevant small talk, seemingly assuming the viewer is already familiar with the episode's creative process.

I give Sony credit for brightening and correcting what had been gloomy, apparently underexposed video.  You can really see the difference between the DVD and the broadcast/online versions.  But other than that, Hulu preserves the original content and appeal of Season 3 much better than the DVD.",1356134400,2,1205,5.0

Community is a rare confluence of comedic timing, tight writing, and expressive directing. It's clear that everyone who is part of the show is committed to creating a lasting work of art. Like many shows, season three finds the characters hitting their stride while continuing to develop and surprise the audience. One of my favoriate episodes in all of the TV shows that I've seen is in season three.

Unfortunately, season 3 was a bit of a disappointment, It felt more like a new show trying to find its pace and fell flat just as often as it soared. I give seasons 1 & 2, 5 stars, but this season will have to make do with a 3.5.

Despite the hiccups, the show overall has been such a breath of fresh air that I am happily purchasing Season 3 to add to my collection and EAGERLY await the arrival of season 4 - hoping that despite the production team problems, it will get back on track in a more consistent way and return to its full glory.",1353888000,,596,4.008403361344538

The show isn't just funny, it's sincere, it's subtle, it comments on the dynamics of people, and culture. It can be downright wacky, or insightful, or intelligent, or even all of those things, at the same time. It's truly an extraordinary show with an all star cast and top-notch writing team. All of my friends, love the show in sometimes very different ways. In that way, Community is little like the schmoo. It's something for nearly everyone.",1353715200,,745,4.775193798449612
4546090,5,B0053O8A8M,"After singing and dancing and letting us know that they won't be as weird this Season, they immediately proceed to be just as delightfully weird and satirical as in seasons past. This third season continues in its departure from the first seasons more ""Arrested Development""-esque gradual plot development, in favor of biting episodic send-offs of rival shows and our society.
  If anyone is a villain in this season, it is Jeff, whose vanity and self-absorbed nature are a major engine driving the plot developments of the season, even though none of the main story arcs are about him. However, once Evil Abed makes his appearance, and Chang launches his coup, we recognize how close we all are. There are three terrific story arcs this season, which gel well and make use of all the characters, including Jim Rash as Dean Pelton, reoccurring guest star John Goodman as Vice Dean Labor, and Ken Jeong as ""Chang.""

With a fantastic spoof of Glee (featuring Taran Killam as the Sweater Vest wearing Glee instructor), the show continues to show that it is not only a wonderfully funny show, but also quite capable of pointing out our societal foibles, with regards to our entertainment and predilections.

This show is simply, BRILLIANT! It is funny, clever, and exceptionally well-written, with pithy dialogue, and a great development of plot. The cast is one of the best on television, and the writers make sure that each character receives a fair share of story time and screen time, so that we can full appreciate their talents. There is no weak link anywhere!

Dani Pudi is a prodigy, and yes, I will go there... even though exceptionally talented actors in their own rights, Gillian Jacobs and Alison Brie was simply STUNNING to look at, to compliment their great comedic character development.

Chevy Chase delivers, as we might expect.

Joel McHale carries off his arrogant, over-grown emo kid with finesse, Donald Glover is great throughout the season as he matures from high school jock to adult, and Yvette Nicole Brown is wonderful, as the kind preaching Christian who is ubiquitous in American society. The strength of this show is that we either are or know every single one of these characters.

It is a crime that this show struggles to stay on the air season after season. It is, likely, the result of the poor taste of so much of the TV audience that leads to this, and is something of which the writers are keenly aware, as they sprinkle lots of references to the show's struggles in the dialogue, while skewering the more ""popular"" tastes.",1353715200,,2557,4.848623853211009

It may not have the mainstream appeal like a ""Seinfeld"" or ""Friends"", but it is certainly should have a larger following than it does.

Between Digital Estate Planning, Curriculum Unavailable, and Remedial Chaos Theory, that would be enough to satisfy any fan for a full season, but lucky for us, there are 19 more episodes to enjoy.

Unfortunately, it appears the DVD budget must've taken a hit, because there is not nearly as many features in the S3 set as there were with the previous two seasons.

I love Community, and it deserves 5 stars, but that's not why I'm writing this review.

I purchased Community: The Complete Third Season from Amazon.  It was fulfilled by Amazon but sold by a seller called ""Omers Treasures.""
When I received the DVDs I knew almost instantly they were fake, but they were a pretty good fake.  At the time that I bought the DVDs a few weeks ago (and still today) Omers Treasures is the default seller (through Amazon) of the 3rd season of Community, so I am betting that many people have purchased the fakes from this seller and don't even realize it.

So how do I know they are fakes?  Well, I am in the digital design/printing industry so I pay special attention to the packaging details.
I have also been to south east asia (China & Vietnam) and have seen firsthand how good the fakes have become.

Basically, on Community: The Complete Third Season, the way you can tell if you have a fake is this:
1) Paper insert slipped into jewel cover (instead of being sealed in)
2) Look closely at the printing quality on the packaging, and compare it to a legitimate copy or previous season.  It will appear lower resolution and grainy.
3) Look at the cut line at the top of the outer package insert.  It probably isn't a perfectly clean cut, and you might see some white on the edge.
3) Look at the difference in hue of the color between the inserts in each of the DVDs in the set - on mine they were slightly different hue.

So that's it folks.  My recommendation is to complain to Amazon and return your DVDs, then re-purchase DIRECTLY from Amazon.  Do not use a third-party seller that is fulfilled by Amazon.  This is where a seller ships a box of their products to Amazon's warehouse, and Amazon fulfills it for them.

We need to stand up as a COMMUNITY (get it?) and not accept counterfeit discs & packaging that are of inferior quality and probably won't last as long as the real thing.  Plus supporting the counterfeit industry is not great.

Also, Amazon get it together and take care of this problem!! You don't want your rep being undermined by shady vendors do you???",1349913600,4,2295,4.846153846153846

4546174,5,B0053O8A8M,"Community is one of the best, well-thought-out series for many years.  Hopefully for a few more years to come.
In a glorious homage (not ""spoof,"" per se) of Doctor Who, ""Inspector Spacetime"" captures the attention of not only the characters and fans of Community, but also people who have never seen the series, drawn to this new take on a science fiction icon and legend.
The Inspector has rightfully grown his own fanbase (many of whom are mutual Community fans), and with their help via Kickstarter, has produced a web series to fuel our desire to continue following his adventures in Space & Time.
It's not about ""if"" you'll buy this season of Communtiy, and begin your enjoyment of The Inspector's travels, but ""when"" you will buy it.

4546247,5,B0053O8A8M,"Community is THE best television show created. Now while my opinion may be a little subjective, the writing, the characters, the entire premise of the show just appeals to me in a great way and I'm sure to millions of other people as well. I am sad to say that this wonderful show doesn't have the highest ratings on television, and I cannot find the reason why? This show is ten times funnier than anything on CBS, and yes I do mean ""The Big Bang Theory"" as well. Seriously, this show is 10x more ambitious, and dares to be different which just makes me appreciate the creative road this show just continues to take really pushing a lot of boundaries taking unexpected risks that the show is famous for. This season is noticeably different than the previous 2, I will say that this season is a bit darker in tone because of the focus on exploring some of the characters psyches and back stories a bit more. Character developments continue to raise more questions than answers, but the characters are just so loveable and intriguing that sometimes you forget about their personal bios and just enjoy whats happening in the moment of the episodes... To be perfectly honest, the episodes of this season is what hooked me on Community in the first place so I can't say I'm a hardcore fan being that I only came across the series on a happy accident not too long ago (not to mention I'm a huge Donald Glover/Childish Gambino fan). I was just surfing through demand on my DVR and I watched ONE episode, just one, and that episode happened to be ""Pillows & Blankets"" after watching the genius in that episode alone was enough to pull me into the ENTIRE series buying the Season 1 DVD not too long after and my love fandom just grew from there. I will take season 3 with a grain of salt to say that this season is slightly weaker than the previous seasons not in quality, but in storytelling, it really gets darker and loses some of the fun from previous seasons. Season 3 is the most experiemental season so far of Community and I guess I just wasn't prepared for that. Needless to say Season 3 is still fantastic in every sense.

Love the DVD, commentary on every single episode (once again), great featurettes on the making on some of the more ""special"" episodes, and hilarious outtakes which I have always found enoyable on every season release of Community. Point being, I hope that this show continues to do well and gain more viewers, and even though the creator Dan Harmon may be out of the picture, I hope the new season can still capture all the things that make this series so special.

If your a fan of Community like I am, continue to support the show, if you don't watch the show WATCH IT!! its as simple as that, you will not be dissapointed.

Can everyone PLEASE stay home on friday nights this fall, watch this show, so it can beat out that lame show about four nerds and the one girl who likes one of them? I don't even want to say its name...

Community and Archer are the two best-written and witty shows to come out in a long time. But it seems as though the masses aren't bright enough for them, so we have to do our part. Buy their DVDs, Blu-Rays, watch the episodes either live or within one week of DVR'ing them, and together we can keep quality television alive.

But anyway, back to ""Community"", the best audio-visual anti-depressant out there.  It's like Seinfeld, but with better writing, better acting, and a better looking cast.  It has a slow start in Season 1, but after a few episodes in, you'll be feeling the vibe and it only gets better.  Even after you have watched the shows once, when you go back a second time, you see more.  For the comedy angels had friends, sneaky and intelligent little devils, who leave all sorts of clues, jokes, hints, and visual gags that you never see unless you aren't watching the main action going on; Pause on a school poster, and try to read the 'message'. Watch Annie and Britta oil wrestle as Abed experiences a secret miracle. Find yourself wondering which timeline you yourself are actually in... The more you watch this, the more you see.  I've never had comedy in so many 'layers' like the way Community does it. I'm 48, and I've watched a lot of TV, seen a lot of movies, and read a lot of books in my life, and I am at the point where plots don't surprise me much anymore, and the formulaic way sitcoms are run are things I've seen over and over again to where I can guess it in the first five minutes.  This show is so creative that I find myself surprised many times per season.  What a joy, to find something actually fresh and new.

This is Season Three, I am writing this review for the person who might have stumbled upon this.  If you're not sure, buy Season 3 and watch, and I'll hear your scream of joy as you quickly go back to order Season 2 and 1.

This puts added emphasis on extra DVD features, the only reason I am ever tempted to buy a DVD. The first two seasons of Community's DVDs set the bar really high, specifically the quality of the commentaries. This was their greatest season yet, so I was very excited for commentary on some of their more daring episodes, but overall it was kind of a let down. I am sure that this has something to do with the Dan Harmon feud, but he's on the way out because of his commitment to the product (well, more specifically because that commitment allegedly made him a beast to deal with). You'd think he would want to wrap up this one final item. More likely, it was outside of his control, but he was actually on the commentary! He should know it's not great. (In fact, I think he mentioned this during one commentary, so he knows it's a problem!) They should have brought in a hard core fan to interview people during the commentaries so they wouldn't devolve into listening to other people watch the show and laugh at their own stuff or explain the episode like we've never seen it before. Previously, they came prepared with Twitter questions, which would have been a great idea. I usually found that the Twitter questions answered in the commentaries of the first two seasons were questions that I was wondering. I still have loads of questions, and I feel like we got only a fraction of the information (meaning of the entertainment value) than in years past, and this was a disappointment. However, the fact that the commentary is substandard compared to the first two should NOT stop anyone from buying and enjoying this DVD.

Community is easily the best comedy on NBC. Each season challenges the format and its characters to grow in ways that other comedies don't even consider. Even when it's reach goes beyond its grasp, it still manages to succeed on some enjoyable level, and its audacity and imagination will still impress.

4546287,5,B0053O8A8M,"Community has been one of the most joyous surprises on network tv in years. When it first debuted, it seemed like it was going to follow the basic sitcom strategy we've seen so many times before. By the time we saw the first paintball episode though, we knew this show was destined for greatness. Season two improved on the first in nearly every way, and set the bar for season three impossibly high. The good news is, Season three delivers in almost every way but one; consistency.

Season three starts off with two enjoyable, but disappointing episodes. The third episode however, gave us a glimpse of what this season truly had in store for us. ""Remedial Chaos Theory"" is Community in it's purest form; taking tried and true sitcom cliches, turning them on their head, and then slipping LSD into their drink when they aren't looking. This episode shows six alternate timelines created when Jeff suggests rolling a die to decided who goes downstairs to get the groups Pizza. What follows practically defies description, though I will say if the darkest time line didn't seem dark enough to you, stick around after the credits roll; it gets so much better.

Overall, season three is much darker than its previous seasons, but never too dark. The next few episodes are great, but brilliance once again shines through in ""Documentary Filmaking: Redux"". Dean pelton has been given permission to update Greendale's woefully out of date promotional commercial. What follows is so wonderfully extreme, the absurdity of it seems natural. Luis Guzman makes a welcome appearance, and Joel Mchale's Dean impression is worth the price of admission by itself.

From there, the season takes off at a sprint and never lets up. What follows are some of the best half hours on television ever created. From ""Regional Holiday Music""'s pitch perfect lampooning of ""Glee"", to a parody of law and order in ""Basic Lupine Urology"" so flawless you'll be waiting to see Detective Munch stroll through the set, Community shows what is possible when the writing, acting, and directing are all in perfect synch.

I feel special mention should be made as to ""Digital Estate Planning"", and the fact that it is one of, if not the, most accurate representations of a video game I have ever seen in Prime time television, ever. The level of detail that went into this tour de force is only enhanced by the presence of the incomparable Giancarlo Esposito, of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Breaking-Bad-The-Complete-Second-Season-Blu-ray/dp/B0030T1NAO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Breaking Bad: The Complete Second Season [Blu-ray</a>] fame.

The two part finale perfectly wraps the season up. Community season three contains the best episodes of the series, and is without a doubt the pinnacle of the series so far. It is an absolute classic, and a must buy.

On an unrelated note, Dan Harmon, the showrunner of this series from conception, has been removed. What this means for the upcoming season remains to be seen, but I encourage everybody to at least give it a chance. Even though it will surely be different, that doesn't necessarily mean that it will be worse. Lets agree to be cautiously optimistic.",1345248000,3,3219,5.145315487571701
4546288,5,B0053O8A8M,"I love having the DVD to this show. There's so much that the writers, props department, and actors bring to each episode, that a lot is lost when watched on a weekly basis.

Having just finished the DVD, Season 3 is now my favorite season. During the Fall, particularly with the Winter hiatus, Season 3 really flew under the radar. Reading through the reviews, it seems that a lot from this season was just overlooked. I think a lot of that is in part, because each episode this season dared to add that little extra. Where the last 2 seasons brought to the table great episodes such as paintball, stop motion Christmas, and Dungeons and Dragons, Season 3 was able to take the qualities that make those episodes stand out, and bring them to pretty much every episode this season.

It gets off to a rocky start, with some lackluster episodes early on (mostly model UN), but it quickly picks up the pace and keeps it there the entire season. Re-watching the episodes back to back, I found so much more life in them than I remember when watching on TV. I don't know how I missed Michael Haggins' ""Daybreak"" as a running joke throughout the season, but it's the little things like that that make Community the best show on TV.

I'll spare going into detail about episodes of the show, as I'm sure most of you buying the DVD already know and are a part of an unfortunately small (but loyal) fanbase. For the uninitiated, I will urge you not to be put off by the nature of the show. While the allure of Community is its over the top nature, it is as every bit endearing. No episode is without a nice emotional ending that brings you closer to the group. Community is a show that embraces the outlandish to highlight the very real situations the characters find themselves in.

As for the DVD, there is less content that the previous 2 seasons. There is still commentary on every episode and four sets of outtakes, however there are only two dedicated featurettes. Last season had two just for the Christmas episode, on top of the commentary for that episode. With that said, it is still a jam packed DVD and the featurettes are very informative.

Any show that has a great first season, and beats the odds with a perfect second season, always stumbles in its third outing (see also : 30 Rock, 24, Arrested Development) While this is still the best and most adventurous comedy on network television, Community is no exception.

Community's greatest strength is that even at its most absurd, its equally balanced by a genuine warmth. This season the show finally collapsed under the weight of its absurdity with Chang's arc, which takes up a large chunk of the season. The attempts at furthering character development with the group aren't as organic as previous seasons and are frequently introduced, forgotten, and shoehorned in at a later time.

As for the actual dvd set, this time the season comes on 3 discs with 8 episodes instead of 4 discs with 6 episodes. This isn't a special effects heavy show, but the drop in quality can be a bit distracting.

This season simply proves that this show can go anywhere, do anything, and still be the funniest thing about my week. The sheer talent that the writers, cast, and crew put forth is seen infallibly, though every single episode. But, in this third season, there are definitely some standout stories.

These episodes, Pillows & Blankets, Remidial Chaos Theory, The First Chang Dynasty, and more prove how seamlessly our study group can be thrown into any situation/genre, and come out as the same brilliant, hilarious bunch.

4546310,5,B0053O8A8M,"There have been times where I have been concerned about how long Community can continue to create its high level of layered, meta-content.  I've also taken the time to watch some videos of Writer Dan Harmon and this has greatly helped me to understand his vision for the show and how well thought out the entire show is (not just each individual episode).  This is where these DVDs really start adding their value as Dan Harmon commentary, palyfest, comicon, etc. really help you understand the genius he brings to the show.

Season 3 is the dark season.  Its how Harmon characterizes the growth of a relation and its the part that will test the friendship endured so far.  It will either tear them apart, or drive them closer together.  Once I understood this, each episode made much more sense.  I was also concerned that there might not be much else to do outside of the study room.  With 3 paintball episodes, and far too many dances, I was worried about where we would go to keep the show popping.  My worry was in vein.

Season 3 contains the study group tackling a new Biology professor who has a special appreciation for life gleaned from years spent in prison.  It dares to explore the group as they encounter separate timelines.  We become privy to Brita's declared major and how she will work within the group with her new skills.  We see Jeff play Foosball, the study group sings, Shirley makes sandwiches, we get a law and order spoof, someone dies, and we are presented with a fantastic 8 bit episode.  In short... We don't need no stinking paintball.

The show continues to delve deep in multi-layered plot twists chocked full of cleverly written pop references and dynamically acted out by a superb cast.  The musical talent of the cast is once again brought to light, but so is the talent of the song-writers and directors on staff.

Three years in and this show still gets an A+ in every conceivable category.  Sadly, this season marks the end of Dan's writing and leadership.  It also marks the apparent end of a full season as season 4 has only been ordered with 13 episode across the board from NBC.  Two more reasons to complete the Community trilogy with this season 3 DVD.  While it doesn't look like this show will complete its ""6 seasons and a movie"", It did release 3 full seasons + in less than ideal circumstances, and remains one of the most intelligent and underrated comedies of its time.

I recommend Community to any sitcom fan for a fresh look at life, politics, pop culture, story telling, acting, music, and more.  Community contains the entire academic experience ;)",1341878400,15,2604,4.637554585152839
4546311,5,B0053O8A8M,"This is one of those comedies that is funny on SO many different levels... for people who want to be mindless and just have fun, it provides silliness. For people who want complexity and satire and parody, it provides that too. The character development is honest and funny, and doesn't shy away from letting characters be unlikeable (see: Chevy Chase) as well as making them grow as human beings (see: Joel McHale). It has adapted over the last 3 years; pre-determined storylines have changed and grown, and characters who were initially meant to just be supporting have risen in focus. It refuses to fit within typical TV comedy parameters, but at the same time parodies EVERYTHING TV currently offers (see: Law & Order spoof over a ""murdered yam"").

4546312,5,B0053O8A8M,"Community is still on top and proves it once again with this highly enjoyable Junior Year.

Community's writing is smart, original, creative, funny and subtle. It is an ambitious, laugh-out-loud comedy, unlike any other show ever. In one word : deancredible. Despite the crazy stories hommaging films, TV shows or specific genres, they never lose track of the characters.

Community's cast is flawless. I won't go in the details of why this cast is the best comedy ensemble on TV (alongside Parks and Rec's), but it's worth noticing that Jim Rash got a promotion this year, and he deserved it -- Documentary Filmmaking: Redux, particularly focused on him, was changtastic.

You can feel the impact of NBC's shady scheduling on the last 5 episodes of the season, with a storyline mirroring the fact that the show was kicked out of the schedule for 3 months. But in a way, I wonder if they had not planned that storyline involving Chang all along. No matter what, I loved it. Chang was used much better than in the previous season, btw -- if, under torture (e.g : forced to watch Glee with Jim Belushi), I would have to admit one flaw about the show, it would be Chang's use in season 2.

As always, there are so many memorable episodes this season, like Remedial Chaos Theory, Horror Fiction in Seven Spooky Steps, Documentary Filmmaking Redux, Regional Holiday Music, Pillows and Blankets, Virtual System Analysis, Digital Estate Planning or Curriculum Unavailable. The weirder the better, I say, and with Community's precarious status, they pulled out all the stops more than ever.

NBC has such a great show in theirs hands, it's a shame that for season 4 they fired the creative soul of the show and sent it at 8:30pm on Fridays after Whitney, a sitcom that couldn't be less compatible with the groundbreaking brilliance of Community. It's never going to be a hit (and thankfully because otherwise it would mean the show has gone mainstream), it won't last 10 seasons, so they might as well let the writers do their thing and not britta everything up. When a comedy has such devoted fans, it's not a coincidence. Dan Harmon, we'll miss you.

As Leonard would say, ""Community: The Complete Third Season [DVD]"" is a buy -- although a Blu-ray release would have been cool. Cool, cool, cool.

In the same vein, there's also Party Down, Spaced, Better Off Ted, 30 Rock, Scrubs, Futurama and Sit Down Shut Up. Other amazing comedies (not in the same vein but I think Community fans should enjoy) include Curb your Enthusiasm, Seinfeld, It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia, Parks and Recreation, Bored to Death, Eastbound and Down, Archer, The League, Wilfred, Louie, Veep, Episodes and Raising Hope.

However, Season 3 falls victim to its previous seasons as both the character development and the comedy of Season 3 are nowhere near the levels we saw in Seasons 1 & 2.

The problem with Season 3 is the overuse of Pierce and Chang.  I loved both of these characters in Seasons 1 & 2 because they were awesome compliments to the others in the study group.  In Season 3, the effort to include them in more of a principle role is apparent as they have more stories revolve around them and they are just generally on camera more.  The episode when Change becomes a security guard, while still funny, pushed me to my limit of how much of his screeching character I could take.  Pierce, similarly, steps into the limelight and the stories around him and his dad are flat-out difficult to watch.

Despite it's flaws, there are so many genuinely hilarious moments in this season you just have to own it.  You can skip the 2 or 3 crummy episodes and bask in the glory that is everything else.

Actually, I'm loving it so much, I'm finally buying the DVDs from the previous seasons (I am slow to decide that I want to watch something again and again) and looking forward to the S3 collection! Thank you, cast, crew and writers of Community, for making such a consistently smart and funny show!",1332547200,4,395,4.577464788732394

This will not be appreciated for the humor until is long gone. Years from now people will watch the reruns and ponder. Why wasn't this a bigger hit. Don't wait catch the shows now, you will laugh and enjoy them.",1331856000,5,362,4.260869565217392
