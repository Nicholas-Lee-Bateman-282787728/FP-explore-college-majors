One of several A.F.T.R.S. Workshops, this one is 55 minutes. In all four of the 55 minute workshops filming takes place on 2 studio sets simultaneously, each the same set: a deserted Australian Cafe at Xmas in the summer. Two different masters were asked to run a workshop with the same theme. The script contains no dialogue and is flexible to the style of the cinematographer. The scenes were directed by the school's Cinematography department head.  The final footage did not have to cut together as a short film and some shots were static.  The entire package shows about 8 different ways to light & shoot a short on the same set.

A note about the A.F.T.R.S.: This is a hands on workshop for students. Students do the set ups and ask questions. There are moments in this entire set of training videos when this adds something of interest to an understanding of methods used on a set. For instance, a master cinematographer tells one student to never use the video assist to determine whether an exposure or light set-up was correct on a set because it is deceptive, and another tells not to use the black and white split in the video assist  to determine an exposure of black and white film because it is panachromatic. Although, it seems simpler to have students shoot black and white still film in order to develop an eye for tones.

THIS TRAINING WORKSHOP:
Lenoir carries a pocket book of notes he has made for himself since he started to learn cinematography. He divides it into technical and critical sections.  He tells students not to be embarrassed to write things down and to track their own progress. This is a somewhat amusing account of what he wrote down in his early years. Lenoir also speaks about what he thinks the job of the cinematographer is comparing it to that of music or of subtext of the film. Commenting briefly that the lighting with meaning is very important.  The Fantasy part consists of snowfall falling in the Cafe and in the case of Vierny's shoot a ray of light appearing magically after a blackout. Both Fantasy shoots are shot from Dusk on until evening light, no day scenes. The setting up of a special effect on the set is part of the workshop. Besides the lighting set up some time is spent on metering the scene and deciding what changes needed to be made.

As instructional videos these workshops have been produced so that they could be used in an educational arena, but at what level? First, although the overhead diagram showing each lighting setup with a narrative was very good, it would have helped greatly to have had at least one point in the instructions with a labeled diagram of the interior. I found some difficulty when attempting to quickly make notations about the interior lighting setups when the unlabeled overhead diagram was turned! The bigger problem may be that lighting jargon and shortened names of lights were used. That was not as large a problem for me, but I've read over 70 textbooks on filming. An advanced or intermediate student with access to lights should have no problem. This group of 4 videos actually showed more of the actual lights, gels and camera equipment than the others. Although some of the technology might be outdated, the basics of lighting remain the same.
