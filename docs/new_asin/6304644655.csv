7875714,4,6304644655,"I would never claim that the later seasons of Tom Baker's run as Dr. Who were the best of his tenure. For my money (and that of many others) the show never really recovered from the departure of Philip Hinchcliffe as producer in '78 -- an event which eventually contributed to its ultimate cancellation about a decade later. Still, like pizza and sex, classic DR. WHO tended to be good even when it was bad, and the E-Space trilogy is not bad: in fact, to some extent it shows that even in 1981 this series was still capable of spasms of true greatness.

The E-space trilogy, which takes place entirely in ""exospace,"" occurred in Baker's final season as the Doctor (Season 18), and consisted of the following stories:

""Full Circle"" - The Doctor,  Romana II (Lala Ward) and their robot dog K-9 (voiced by John Gleeson) accidentally blunder into E-space, a sort of alternate universe which exists in tandem with our own, but which is much smaller. While trying to find a way back into their own reality, they land on a strange planet populated by the descendants of a spaceship crew who crash-landed there, and who spend all their time trying to repair their damaged spacecraft and return to their own home planet. The Doctor soon discovers, however, that the motives of those who lead the ship's crew are not what they appear to be.

""State of Decay"" - Still trying to escape E-space, and now burdened by a a stowaway from their previous adventure -- a brilliant but morally ambiguous teenager named Adric (Matthew Waterhouse) -- the Doctor and Romana arrive on a medieval-style planet where all knowledge and learning are forbidden by ""The Three Who Rule,"" and the youngest and strongest of the peasant population are taken away to their Tower, never to be heard from again. After meeting the mysterious and sinister Three, the Doctor begins to suspect that a terrible secret lies behind their power, one as old as the Time Lords themselves...and that Adric may have fallen under their spell.

""Warrior's Gate"" - The Doctor finds a possible way out of E-space, a mysterious gate which exists in an ever-shrinking void where events seem to be occurring in the past, present and future simultaneously. Unfortunately they are not alone: another ship has arrived at the gate as well, one which is stuck there like a cork in a bottle. The Doctor and his companions soon discover a grisly secret behind how the alien ship is powered, as well as the dark history of the gate itself, and must find a way to ""do the right thing"" in a situation where the victims may be as bad as the offenders and time -- the one thing you'd think Time Lords would have in abundance -- is running out.

The E-space Trilogy is really only a ""trilogy"" in the sense that the Season 12 stories ""The Ark in Space,"" ""The Sontaran Experiment,"" ""The Genesis of the Daleks"" and ""The Attack of the Cybermen"" were a quadrilogy: that is to say, they are only linked by location and not by an over-arching plot. And the main purpose of them seems to have been to map an exit strategy for Lala Ward and an entrance strategy for Matthew Waterhouse. Still, they do produce the desired effect of putting our heroes in a sort of cosmological cul-de-sac that they desperately want to escape. As for the episodes themselves, I didn't particularly care for ""Full Circle"" -- although Baker gives a surprisingly impassioned performance, I feel it draws out the mystery entirely too long and then attempts to solve it entirely too fast (it also suffers from an overly exuberant use of music and background noise that made crucial dialogue hard to understand). On the other hand, ""State of Decay"" is an absolute masterpiece, almost literally a flawless episode that does everything DR. WHO does well, and does it brilliantly. (Everything from the script to the music and the production and costume design are superb, as is Terrence Dicks' take on the vampire legend.) ""Warrior's Gate"" is not on that level, in fact it is a little overly reliant on annoying visual effects and lacks really sympathetic guest characters, but it has a very cerebral plot and balances it with a lot of witty writing, and is a fitting send off for the character of Romana, who had been with the series (albeit not as the same actress) since 1978

A word on the quality: I bought the trilogy on VHS because I wanted to complete my collection of Tom Baker WHO tales which I have in this medium. I found the quality very good visually, but on two of the stories there was a certain wavering effect on the images themselves for which I don't know the technical term -- a slight bend or wobble to the image which came and went and wasn't effected by adjusting the tracking. This was kind of annoying, and possibly the result of a VCR problem, but also possibly caused by the old age of the tapes themselves. I believe at this point that VHS tape quality is ""luck of the draw"" in that the tapes are now so old that some of them are bound to show some slight deterioration even if never-before viewed.

All in all, I'm extremely pleased with the Trilogy. One mediocre episode, one classic and one very respectable outing are not bad batting averages, especially after a season that began with such forgettable storylines (""The Leisure Hive"", ""Meglos,"") This was well worth the money and proved a very pleasant trip down memory lane, to a time when DR. WHO was as uncool a show as an American kid could watch and the few of us who did (on public TV, usually late at night) were like an underground resistance movement against crappy network TV. I hope you enjoy going back and time as much as I did...even if you didn't get to use a TARDIS to do it.",1422230400,,5669,4.605940594059406
7875715,4,6304644655,"These stories will be released on a three dvd boxset early 2009 in the uk. In the early months of the year,  with a later release that year in other parts of the world.  So that's more good news for dr. who fans.
And this is one of the best series of stories that doctor who ever produced.",1229731200,,289,3.9655172413793105
7875716,4,6304644655,"This trilogy gets 4 stars on the strength of State of Decay, by far the best of the three.  Perhaps this is so because it could easily be fit into the gothic theme of seasons 13 & 14, one of the best Doctor Who eras.

Individual ratings of the stories go as follows:

Full Circle: 3 Stars
State of Decay 5 Stars (one of the top 5 Who stories)
Warrior's Gate 3 Stars

Full Circle is a simple story containing far too many plot holes.  For instance, when Mistfall arrives every 50 years, are the existing humans killed off only to be replaced by a new set as marshmen evolve into them?  Or is their lineage continuous?  The story never fully explains this.  If the former, then why does one of the deciders say he remembers the last Mistfall 50 years earlier?  If he developed from a Marshman, he can't possibly recall it as a human.

State of Decay represents the best and most understandable of the trilogy, easily the most accessible.  The atmospheric setting of the forest and the castle serves to enhance the viewers enjoyment of the story.  Plus the straightforward plot is a welcome relief.

As for Warrior's Gate, the same plot holes exist as in Full  Circle, with a not-so-straightforward plot that is difficult to understand.  What exactly does navigating the time winds mean?  And if it does mean travelling through time, why does Romana intend to give the Tharils time-travel capabilities when they already have it?  Critics love this one (why?) and recommend viewing this one multiple times to fully understand it.  However, it is so cryptic that even that may not work.  Your best bet is to find Doctor Who story guides by some of those aforementioned critics and read up on it.  And why should we sympathize with the Tharils when they started the slave trade during the height of their empire?  They are simply getting a taste of their own medicine.",1106524800,,1862,4.598784194528875
7875717,4,6304644655,"Still trapped in Exo-Space, The Doctor, Romana and K-9 land on a strange planet where science and knowlege is forbidden, and the peasants work in the fields to please the Lords, who protect them from the wasting...! A  better than average vampire/horror story incorporated into Who mythology is  handled with considerable style(except for the wonderful ""Short trip,  quick flip"" effect). The design of the adventure is top notch. The  Lords are very well realised, and there is even hints of bi-sexuality  intermittently thrown in. Adric is a little annoying, his immaturity, as  K-9 mentioned, is quite apparent. Although, I hardly think that the ancient  computers and scout ship could work after so many years of disuse. Still,  some wonderful lines from Baker(""You jumped on my toe!""), and a  cast that's aiming to please make this more than just an average runaround.",961545600,,872,5.127659574468085
7875718,3,6304644655,"On their way to Gallifrey, the TARDIS and her crew inadvertently pass through a C.V.E., a doorway to Exo-Space, where they land on Alzarius, during Mistfall, when Marshmen leave their swamps and the humanoid  inhabitants retreat to the Starliner. The first 3-story arch in the JNT  era, starts off in an uneventful fashion. ""Full Circle"" has the  feel of a Davison story. Almost as if the the production crew is gearing us  up towards the Davison era. With the exception of the Marshmen and some  ridiculous dialogue, ""Full Circle"" a good traditonal  straightfoward story. It feels a little inconsequential, but it really  isn't bad, it's just a little pedestrian. Adric is a little hard to take in  this one. You're just not sure where his loyalties lie until  ""Warrior's Gate"". Looks and sounds good, though......",960768000,,815,4.977777777777778
7875719,5,6304644655,"Dr Who was by the greatest adventure series ever to grace the airwaves. If you haven't seen it, you really should try this selection. If these three episodes do not grab you - nothing will. The Haunting parallels with modern  life - the fear of the unknown and the threat of that which we do not  undrestand is captured powerfully in 'Full Circle'. The gothic splendour  and romatic notions of old Transylvania are central to the vampiric myth  surrounding the 'State of Decay' Thirdly and perhaps most chilling of all  is the wierd story encountered in at the end of the Universe at 'Warriors  Gate' A spirit of romance lingers here.
Really, if you like to dip into  the fantasy of other worlds and cultures, and yet want to remain in touch  with a semblance of reality - then dip into the Time Lords travels!
Go on  you know you want to !",955152000,,840,4.437908496732026
