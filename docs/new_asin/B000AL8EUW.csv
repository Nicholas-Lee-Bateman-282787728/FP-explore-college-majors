3649592,5,B000AL8EUW,Moyer's is wonderful in this film.  He illuminates the many conflicting forces associated with holding on and letting go of life.  It is particularly instructive that some people who declare that they don't want to live beyond a certain point change their minds.  The drive to survive is powerful voice.,1382313600,4,303,5.02
3649593,5,B000AL8EUW,"How is it, that it took thirteen years after Moyers made this documentary, that I finally found it?!  I read about it in a book I just bought, and ran over to my computer to order it.
Since it came, I have steadily, and thoughtfully watched the whole four films FOUR times!  It is deeply moving and full of bare truth.  So refreshing!
You see, I became the mother to 26 children over the past 43 years.  I adopted as a single mother, and 19 of my children have handicaps.  7 of those children had terminal illnesses, and one by one, they have gone on to be with the Lord.  I will meet them again there some day.
So many people in the medical field tip-toe around issues of ethics, and of dying.  It is a great comfort to me to hear honesty, and reality spoken freely.  Mr. Moyers, you did a magnificent job making this.  Thank you from the bottom of my heart.  I also thank everyone else who is on this film.",1373155200,11,908,4.166666666666667
3649594,5,B000AL8EUW,"This is SO relevant to caregivers, Baby Boomers, aging seniors, and family members of a terminally ill person. Oh yes, and a MUST SEE for every medical care giver from doctors to employees washing linens. Finally an HONEST look at the unspoken segment of life we call death. Death and breathing are things all people have in common, and now the terms of death's door are discussed through the eyes of caregivers and the dying themselves. Powerful. Honest. Provocative. Yet presented gently. It's a WOW experience.

My credentials include death escapes from 2 heart attacks and 3 `iffy' liver surgeries. I've experienced hospice care through a mother and a mother-in-law. I've experienced 4 family hospital deaths. I've experienced parents in short and longer-term nursing home care. This series is right on. It might shake you out of ignorance of the death process, or it might fine-tune your understanding of what the patient's experience might be. YOU WILL NOT LEAVE THIS DVD EXPERIENCE UNTOUCHED.

All 4 episodes have subtitles and each lasts about 1  hours. Bonus is but a Moyers bio. The value of this DVD set is not extras, but the feature content. This should be required viewing for any pre-med student, new medical care facility employee, and patient with a diagnosis of a terminal illness.

LIVING WITH DYING
.....deals with hospice care (comfort, not treatment) and takes an in-depth look at more than one person as they pass through the dying process as well as caregivers & family who are left behind.
A DIFFERENT KIND OF CARE
.....palliative (comfort) medicine helps to take the fear and pain from dying for the patient. It differs from the Medicare Hospice in that the disease can yet be treated. Pain control is key. Plus cost.
A DEATH OF ONE'S OWN
.....If the patient chooses death; how are medical persons, caregivers, family, and friends to react? What is legal?
A TIME TO CHANGE
.....Can the culture of dying change with modern medicine advancements? Is it all about $$$ ?  This episode looks at the Alabama project ""Balm of Gilead"" which serves those who can't pay. What is America's future with the dying?

A so-called ""VIEWERS GUIDE"", a 12 page booklet accompanies the series, but is extra content. It contains an Intro by Moyers; How to be With a Dying Person; a chart; Grief; Hospice Care; Physician-assisted Suicide; & glossary. This booklet should be in every hospital, library, nursing home, hospice center, medical school, counselor's desk; etc. etc. But it only comes with the DVD series.",1316649600,15,2518,4.954976303317536
3649595,5,B000AL8EUW,"(From the back of the box) ""On Our Own Terms"" presents remarkable human stories of the dying and their wishes to meet life's ultimate passage with compassion, comfort, and dignity.

Emmy award winning journalist Bill Moyers looks at how we die in America, providing an intimate window into the daily experience of patients, their families, and their caregivers, including the decisions they face and the changes they undergo. Along with this deeply personal perspective, we meet the medical, legal, and public policy experts who offer suggestions for improving conditions for terminal patients.
