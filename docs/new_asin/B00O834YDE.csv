Loved this program about the historical launch of Apollo 11s mission to the moon. Lots of space footage and dialogue with the three astronauts. Fantastic shots of the lunar landing! Extremely informative program about how astronauts train to go into space, what tasks they were required to perform while in space and on the lunar surface, and what it takes to prepare for such an undertaking. I learned so much about the space program and all the effort it required to put astronauts on the moon.
Launched by a Saturn V rocket from Kennedy Space Center in Merritt Island, Florida, on July 16, Apollo 11 was the fifth manned mission of NASA's Apollo program. The Apollo spacecraft had three parts: a Command Module (CM) with a cabin for the three astronauts, and the only part that landed back on Earth; a Service Module (SM), which supported the Command Module with propulsion, electrical power, oxygen, and water; and a Lunar Module (LM) for landing on the Moon. After being sent toward the Moon by the Saturn V's upper stage, the astronauts separated the spacecraft from it and traveled for three days until they entered into lunar orbit. Armstrong and Aldrin then moved into the Lunar Module and landed in the Sea of Tranquility. They stayed a total of about 21 hours on the lunar surface. After lifting off in the upper part of the Lunar Module and rejoining Collins in the Command Module, they returned to Earth and landed in the Pacific Ocean on July 24.

Broadcast on live TV to a world-wide audience, Armstrong stepped onto the lunar surface and described the event as ""one small step for [a] man, one giant leap for mankind."" Apollo 11 effectively ended the Space Race and fulfilled a national goal proposed in 1961 by U.S. President John F. Kennedy in a speech before the U.S. Congress: ""before this decade is out, of landing a man on the Moon and returning him safely to the Earth.""

This program was beautifully produced and presented. Chock-full of information and excellent footage and dialogue. A very riveting program you cant help but watch! A day that made history and will never be forgotten by the whole human race!

The Eagle Has Landed - The Flight of Apollo 11

On July 20, 1969, Apollo 11 would take three American astronauts far from home. Seven hours after landing on the moon, the first astronaut stepped onto the moons surface, and history was made.

The items the astronauts left on the moons surface included; an American flag, medals of former astronauts who lost their lives in space missions, and a small dial which carried a message of good will from 73 nations on Earth.

Rare and compelling footage make this program a wonderful watch! Youll never look at the moon the same again..",1412726400,,2758,4.71933471933472
