4314170,1,B004B93RH4,"When i first saw this advertised, i thought i was dreaming. In fact, i'm still not sure i'm actually writing this. But just in case this is real, here's the definitive review, and special thanks to Seth Roberson, who acquired this DVD for me on the black market..as far as bootlegs go, it's totally awesome! Thanks, Seth-keep it up, bro, and don't let anyone tell you otherwise! Not Vince, and certainly not the local police in Bixby, Oklahoma, where you live and develop these in your garage. (He said not to give him a shout-out, but he's just shy!)

The first match i ever remember watching was 35 years ago-Terry Funk defeating Jack Brisco for the NWA title, from Miami, Fl. Since, i've seen every either famous or classic bout. I've watched thousands of matches featuring the greatest legends in the business-From Funk and Brisco, to Flair, Thesz, Hart and Austin.

But I can honestly say, without exaggeration, that John Cena is 1,000 times better than all of those greats combined. Did you know that when Cena lost a decision on a house show a few weeks ago, it was the first match he'd lost at a house show since 2006? In any way-he didn't lose by DQ, countout, pinfall, or submission for over 4 years, at an average of 3-5 shows a week. That confirms his greatness-I hear that the longest Lou Thesz went without losing was like 3 years, when he lost in some obscure city in Thailand, which was never officially recognized by the NWA or anyone in this country. But it happened, and it proves what i just said-comparing Thesz to Cena is like comparing your mother to Velvet Sky. Sure, they both give it up on occasion, but it's a lot easier to nail your mom than Sky. Am i right?

I didn't put a rating because it'd be impossible. How would you rate the Holy Bible? Could you give it just 5 stars? Well if so, ""The Cena Experience"" is a 6...because let's face it, there's only one TRUE J.C.-and it's not the hippie carpenter, you know what i'm sayin'? Because i can honestly envision John Cena walking on water-but can you see skinny lil Hay-Seuss executing a mediocre standing fireman's carry and calling it something cool like the 'Attitude Adjustment'?? And then getting the pin on, oh i don't know, like maybe Satan? I don't THINK so, Einsteins. If you don't believe me, ask Satan yourself-on this planet he has the initials VKM, and he owns some huge conglomerate fake sports business, or somethin.

Anyway, Cena-holics, enjoy! I'm a proud Cena-holic myself; meaning, everytime i hear the name 'John Cena', I get drunk.",1288224000,4,2531,4.6177777777777775
4314171,5,B004B93RH4,"Well, let me first start off by apologizing in advance for giving a 5 star review to a product that hasn't even come out yet. But I feel that it is only fair to do so due to the fact that the previous reviewer would rather rate the John Cena character rather than the actual product being advertised! He has completely sabotaged this product without giving the slightest bit of constructive commentary on even a single match! To give this DVD set a 1 star review based on the fact that you despise the character is not only unfair but extremely immature as well. I mean, at this point we don't even know which matches are going to be included in the set!! Amazon is an online marketplace, not a pro-wrestling forum for ""Cena-haters"" to express their hatred for the man. A John Cena ""fanboy"" I am not, but an avid collector of quality wrestling DVDs I am. If you want to give the DVD set a 1 star when an actual breakdown of the matches is available then that is not only appropriate, it is your right! But until then, if your sole agenda for leaving bad reviews on this product is to demonstrate your disgust for the man and not to provide an honest and unbiased review of the product, then take your Cena bashing to a more appropriate forum. I'm sorry but I find it highly illogical to seek out products on Amazon and then give them low ratings not because the items being advertised are necessarily bad quality, but simply because I am not a fan of the products themselves. This makes absolutely no sense to me whatsoever. If you hate John Cena then what are you doing searching out his products in the first place?? If you hate Cena then just don't buy the DVD set people! It's that simple... I look forward to an actual review of the product when more details are available. Thanks.",1284768000,8,1786,4.398791540785498

4314229,5,B004B93RH4,Girlfriend  is  a  huge  john  cena  fan.  So  i  started  my  Christmas  shopping  early  i  saw  this  documentary  years  ago  and  honestly  it  was  meh. I  would  have  loved  it  if  they  had  done  it  in  the  style  of  the  Stone Cold documentary  and  Rock Documentary  Going  from  his  child  hood  all  the  way  to  the  events  that  are  this  documentary.  It  didn't  even  feel  like  an experience  it  just  felt  like  he  was  going  through  the  motions  and  doing  his  thing  and  it  wasn't  very  exciting  the  rock  and  stone cold  documentaries  felt  like  a  genuine  experience it  made  you  feel  like  you  knew  them  here  i  feel  like  i  don't  know  cena  at  all.,1406419200,,713,4.224137931034483

4314245,5,B004B93RH4,"John Cena truly seems to be the ""real"" deal,a wrestling superstar,plus a really nice guy.
Until I watched this video I was not aware of all of the visits and work that John Cena does with our deployed soldiers scattered *around* the world, and doing the same with our wounded warriors, not to mention visiting hospitals and children's wards.
 John Cena appears to really care, and watching this DVD was a true pleasure.
I recommend this video to anyone who is interested in activities related to John Cena's ""Good Will"" efforts to support our troops and wounded warriors.",1380240000,,571,4.826530612244898

4314250,4,B004B93RH4,Great dvd on John Cena but a little bummed that it doesn't have more of a bio on him...It kinda just jumps right into his appearances but it's pretty in depth and it's a great price for 3 dvd's ...I got this as a present for my brother and he loved it!,1353888000,,252,3.8653846153846154

I thought it was his life and how he got to the WWE, but it's not. It just a bunch of things that John does outside of the WWE. This thing is 2 hours long! And, I found it boring to watch after an hour or so.  The John Cena Experience doesn't have any matches until almost till the end of the movie and that's for less than a minute. Just warning everyone that wants to see more about John in the ring, you do not want to get or watch this at all!",1335744000,,564,3.7796610169491527

4314258,3,B004B93RH4,"What hasn't already been said about John Cena?  The man has virtually done it all and this DVD gives you a chance to see how hectic his day to day schedule really is.  For all the crap he gets from the WWE Universe about being a poor wrestler, he sure does go through an awful lot to try and make all of us fans happy.  He's on tv, he's in parades, he's flipping coins at football games, he's granting wishes, he's making music, he's signing thousands of autographs in one sitting, he's entertaining us every week on RAW.  John Cena is like a machine the way that he works.  I only wish he was as good in the ring as he is out of the ring.  That's the only reason why Cena receives so much hate.  His matches come off as stale and boring because of his lack of in-ring manuevers.  All in all I thought this was a good set.  If your a fan of the backstage aspect of wrestling then I suggest picking this up.  There are some pretty good matches on here as well.  I had a good time watching this.",1292803200,4,993,4.06701030927835
4314259,2,B004B93RH4,"I got to tell you people, this is the worst DVD ever put out by the WWE.  And I can say that because I own almost all of them.  I would have given it 1 star except some of the matches were OK.  The documentary part was totally awfull.  All it shows is Cena going to car shows, doing radio shows, and other garbage to fill up the DVD.  Trust me when I say don't waste your time or money on this crap.  Worst Ever?......I think so.  C'mon WWE you can do better than this.",1292371200,4,469,3.873684210526316
4314260,4,B004B93RH4,"I really like the behind-the-scenes DVD's, so I truly enjoyed The John Cena Experiment. WWE took a break from the documentary DVD's to deliver a DVD release similar to Stone Cold's ""Hell Yeah"" or The Rock's ""Just Bring It"". Basically a camera crew followed Cena from late 2009 with the Tribute To The Troops to mid 2010 around the time of the Money In The Bank PPV. Footage includes Cena making appearances on Psych, late night TV, and ESPN as well as his Legendary movie. They also show some of his stops with charitable organizations and festive events, like Make-a Wish, the Fiesta Bowl, Barrett Jackson car show, and the WrestleMania golf tournament. The matches are hit-or-miss and a few other reviews already have the line-up. Overall, I think this DVD delivered with just disc 1 alone, but that's just my opinion. BTW, the only reason I gave it 4 stars is because WWE is apparently opting to not include content inserts anymore.",1290211200,2,935,4.742331288343558
4314261,5,B004B93RH4,"The John Cena experience collects every great and feud PPV match from Cena's awesome career.

Here's some small reviews of my favorite(er) moments in the DVD:

WWE Championship - Edge vs John Cena - Royal Rumble 2006 : John Cena wins his title back from that loser Edge. I nearly cried when Edge cashed-in on Cena at New Years Revolution. But when John Cena put Edge in the STF and won back his title at RR 06, there were only tears of happiness. YOU TAPPED OUT!! Shortest MITB reign in history! Congrats Edge, you cashed-in on the wrong guy!

WWE Championship - John Cena vs Randy Orton - SummerSlam 2007 : John ""The Great"" Cena faces Orton for the WWE Championship for the first time! Randy Orton thinks just because he's #1 contender he can attack Cena whenever he wants! He hits the RKO on Cena through chair!! He even punts Cena's father!! But John Cena ""Never gives up"" and he managed to get RKO'd, get directly up, and hit the Attitude Adjustment out of nowhere! 1-2-3! He retains the WWE Championship!

John Cena Returns - Royal Rumble 2008 : After the Summerslam match Orton cowardly attacks Cena and injuries him! Orton goes on one of the worst WWE title reigns in WWE history.. but wait -- Who's the 30th entrant in the Royal Rumble?.. OH MY GOD... IT'S JOHN CENA!! John Cena wins the Royal Rumble! He then goes on to face Orton at No Way Out and puts an end to Boreton's reign!!

My only downside is that John Cena's career is too awesome for only 3-disc. I mean, 3-disc? Really? REALLY? Make a 10-set DVD BOX SET, WWE!!
