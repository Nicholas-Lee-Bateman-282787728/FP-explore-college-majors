8569028,3,B00BIG0R6C,"Of the 4 Elvis Presley films here, the only one that's among his best films is ""Jailhouse Rock."" It's got quite a good story, good songs and dances, and is one of Elvis's best movie performances. Of the rest, ""It Happened at the World's Fair"" and ""Charro"" are pretty much in the middle quality among his movies. They're OK but nothing to go out of your way to see.  On the other hand, ""Stay Away, Joe"" is rightly considered to be at or near the bottom of the barrel since it's very strange, portrays Native Americans with negative stereotypes, and the songs in it are subpar, with only ""Stay Away"" being any good. To sum it up, if you've already got DVDs with most of Elvis's better films this set might be an OK addition to your collection, but there are several other sets of his movies that are better. I should note that I have seen these movies elsewhere so I'm assessing the movies themselves but I can't comment on these actual DVDs - picture quality, sound quality, extras, etc.",1492473600,,986,4.447513812154696
