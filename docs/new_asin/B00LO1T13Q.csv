6494695,5,B00LO1T13Q,"This movie shows a very believable view of the gritty reality showing how most of us end up failing in life until we hit rock bottom, made worse by disbelief in God mirrored by not fully believing in oneself, which makes it all worse because we blame ourselves more than people would ever catch on.  The thought struck me as I watched it that when we don't believe in God, it makes it impossible to believe in ourselves, and failures tumble one after another from that rocky crag and we end up drowning in self guilt.  The only way out of this conundrum that I know is to grasp onto the redemption of Jesus Christ to try and make our way out of the resulting doldrums, and thankfully this movie does that by the end of it, resulting in belief in other human beings coupled with belief in oneself - hope, which is needed to sustain life.  Forgiveness - including self forgiveness - is a truly powerful concept that is very well demonstrated in this movie, which demonstrates the lack of same throughout the first 80-90% of the movie until one reaches a *believable* happy ending, not fairy tale or fantasy fiction, but one which is well demonstrated.  By the end it isn't just a fairy tale, but the failed characters have begun reaching up and now see themselves as *capable* of constructive efforts at life, with each other supporting the others.  This movie isn't just about one person failing in life until they change their ways.  All four main characters have failed.  One of them in her past (drugs and abuse), another agrees to stop lying about the death of her son's father and forgives that ex-husband during the movie, and the other two, father and son, with the encouragement of the first two, reach a decision to stop their self defeating ways (here mostly depicted as booze, one night stands and violence, as well as past drug use, as ways of hiding from their failed current reality, although thankfully, not graphically depicted for the sake of families watching) so there's a sense of them all being in the same boat, wallowing in the same mud as they fail in what they need in life - no high and mighty self righteousness in this group of lead actors.  The end is satisfying and provides hope, again without an unbelievable fairy tale ending, but grounded in reality and rock solid believability, which is a real selling point for what could have otherwise turned out as an amateurish, cheesy movie.  The entire tale comes across as authentic and believable and is very skillfully woven into a tale of the all too typical reality of today's failed world, until one reaches out and touches the hand that can feed us all.  There's not a lot of preaching - perhaps even unbelievers will feel the hope that is palpable by movie's end - self defeating behaviors such as slipping into substance dependence and short sighted selfish behavior and the resulting self loathing are replaced by a confidence in self and the hope to carry on, due to accepting each other's needs and a willingness to rely on God above self, but there are no cheesy revival moments, just acceptance of what is real, including one's need for each other and the need to all work together to escape what is otherwise the loneliness of a short sighted, selfish and self defeating existence.",1412121600,11,3271,4.633851468048359

6494723,5,B00LO1T13Q,"Not sure why all the negative reviews but it was a positive story with a true life message and a great ending.  In REAL life there are REAL people who struggle with things like drinking, drugs, addictions and make bad choices.  Unfortunately sometimes there is bloodshed.  So this was a story that truly touched my heart.  I came here and found this movie kind of by accident as I had been looking for a movie for hours and nothing interested me.  Then I found this and the movie hit home. I needed to hear this message on this night.  Even though this was made a few years ago...I needed it and I thank God for it!  I cried at the end and had to put the movie on pause so I could have a moment... I am so thankful for these kinds of movies.... people who still believe that sharing their faith in film matters and that peoples lives are touched.  I wish I could personally thank everyone that was a part of this but most of all I want to thank God for His amazing Love and for always being right where and when I need Him!! Praise Jesus!!!",1492041600,8,1040,4.165

6494852,3,B00LO1T13Q,"I wanted to give this movie 5-stars, but I just couldn't. The actor of the lead character was not a good fit for this role.  The only emotion he brought to the table was anger and entitlement.  Over and over we heard: ""I'm the best singer you got!""  The problem was there wasn't enough singing to make that declaration.  I felt this movie could have explored more of the relationship between the characters, instead of springing up the ""disastrous accident"" until the end of the movie!  Billy Ray Cyrus' acting is good, but again, the lead character not-so much.  Billy Ray's character is a father who abandoned his family many years ago, and comes back to town to play some gigs.  The mother grew very cold and bitter and the son is a spoiled brat who lacks morals and common decency.  He takes his talent for granted and treats people like dirt.  In certain lighting though I thought he looked like a cherry-red lipped cherub!  Billy Ray used to party hard, but discovers all of his new band mates are clean and sober and reading the Bible.  That's great, but it's as if there is only one verse in the entire Bible: Matthew 11:28-30.  We keep hearing that verse over and over.  We never really hear any singing from Billy Ray except at the very end...and the band playing is not the same as the one's showing up for all the meetings!  Weird.  Going back to the lead character (the son): he is so unlikable, even at the end. I just think he was miscast for this role.  The chemistry was awkward between him and his love interest.  Put a different actor in the lead role and I probably would have given it 5 stars.  The only characters I truly liked was the Roadie Manager and of course, Larry Gatlin!  The original songs were fantastic (they made the movie actually) and worth a listen, but overall not enough singing to be 'Like a Country Song'.  Sorry.",1467504000,2,1855,4.464285714285714
