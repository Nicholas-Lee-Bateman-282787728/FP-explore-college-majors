3904735,4,B002C7ELPY,"My son really likes Fireman Sam. The show is computer animated, keeps his attention, and also provides facts and information that a toddler-early elementary children can understand. This recent video is 45 minutes and is well worth it for the 10 dollars + dollars Amazon is offering right now. This recent one is all about fire safety and goes through the many different kinds of fires providing information and safety tips. It can also make a great rental from Netflix, or a check-out at your local library.",1251158400,3,508,4.850574712643678

3904774,5,B002C7ELPY,"I watched this video with my 3 yr. old grandson, who is all over firefighters, rescue workers, and big machinery right now. This fun video is right on for the preschool set, with kindhearted characters, some real life examples of firehouse work, and even a female firefighter. It is done by British actors, which was of no impact on my small fry audience; just noted here. Overall, a good show for youngsters who are into such topics and enjoy watching action shows. Very well done. This was even a fun show for this middle aged grandma.",1391904000,2,537,4.604166666666667

Just mention his name around them and watch the interest; even the shiest among them begin to talk excitedly!!",1380585600,,331,4.238095238095238
3904781,5,B002C7ELPY,"What I really like about this show is that it teaches my children about responsibility. We are a firefighting family and it is nice that they can relate to the show. I also like that it is not a 10 minute clip, I can turn it on and know the boys can watch for 30 minutes or so.",1380499200,,277,3.793103448275862

3904783,4,B002C7ELPY,"We love Fireman Sam but it is only on Sprout at 2 in the morning, so Amazon Prime is great.  With the short episodes, I can tell the toddler that we will watch three of them (while I scurry around doing chores) and then we can stop the streaming and carry on with the day.  And nice that every episode has a moral to the story.  I have even been asking if thinks Norman Price is making the ""right choice"" to push the message home.",1376784000,,430,4.035294117647059

3904790,5,B002C7ELPY,"I bought a Fireman Sam dvd for my 3 year old grandson in a sale bin for $5. and he loved it had to watch it 4-5 times a day. He talked to everybody about how Firemen not only put out fires but saved people who were lost,. and cats up in trees. the DVD not only entertained but taught him about the job of being a fireman. He would run around saying Fireman Sam to the rescue wearing his fireman costume. So I decided I needed to find more to give us a little variety. All bought get plenty of air time.

They were getting bored with the same old selection so I splurged and got a Prime Membership.  From my older kids I knew Bob the Builder was a big hit, but I had never heard of Fireman Sam.  They loved it!!  Not a peep during the whole show!  I wish there were more than one on the Prime for them to watch.. Super Cute!!",1328227200,,414,3.8117647058823527
3904796,5,B002C7ELPY,"My 2 year old absolutely LOVES Fireman Sam, particularly the newer DVD's like this one (digitally animated).  The stories are fast paced, so they keep a toddler's interest.  The DVD has several stories on the disc, and each story features a different fire equipment, like the fire truck, the hose, the fire/rescue helicopter, the rescue boat, etc.  Lots of fun and also very educational!  If your child likes fire trucks, he/she will love Fireman Sam!",1310428800,,451,4.973333333333334

3904801,1,B002C7ELPY,"the older version using claymation design is better espically as it shows dimensions and is understood by really young children not just the cartoon crazed older ones.  I was very dissapointed and whoever decide to change the format wether it be for money saving purposes or design was wrong they will loose more money using this so called new version.  I doubt I will buy any of the new version ones using animation I loved the claymation type and I hope they continue to use that for wallace and gromit and shawn the sheep cartoons, my children and entire family loves those type more.",1254787200,3,587,4.634615384615385
3904802,3,B002C7ELPY,With this release HIT entertainment switched from stop-motion to computer animation. So much seems lost. (including Sam's hair color) Not as good as the other DVD's but my 2 year old still likes it.,1254441600,2,198,4.852941176470588
3904803,5,B002C7ELPY,"Fireman Sam was the first TV show my son fell in love with at 15 months and now at 28 months he still love the show.  My son likes both the old and new Firemans Sam series.  They were made 12 years apart.  I personally like the original series better but my opinion does not count. My son loves Firman Sam better than Barenstein Bears and Cilou but he love all three. Oh, and thumbs down on Harold and the Purple Crayon and the Wiggles. Oh for our son's 2 birthday, the theme was Fireman Sam.  The UK has a lot of stuff to sell on Fireman Sam but you have to go to the small stores because the big ones cannot ship to the US because some of the toys do not meet US Fed Safety codes.  I went to Fire Emporium in the UK and Safeway airburshed Fireman Sam on the Cake.  Hope this helps.",1253664000,2,783,3.9554140127388533

He watches it over and over and still laughs hysterically at the new & improved Norman Price. He will repeat the safety message in each story.  Great fire safety video for children!",1252886400,6,402,4.391891891891892
3904805,2,B002C7ELPY,"My son was very disappointed with this dvd. He said, I want to watch the ""plain"" Fireman Sam....
