7920063,4,B00004CUZG,"Fairly average sci-fi fare of an scientific project experiments with matter transferring and the horrible outcome after being pressured thru limited funding, facility skeptics and desperate sabotage. This rare creature features oldie comes off as a cross between 1950s The Fly and The 4D man
Not exactly must see but worth a look for the nice 2.35.1 2K widescreen transfer. comes with the original trailer, interviews and deleted scenes",1517356800,,436,5.333333333333333

7920065,3,B00004CUZG,"First things first, if you live in the US, this DVD will not play on Region 1 players; it is Region 2 and 4 compatible (Europe and Australia), so you will need a Region-free DVD player to view this. If you can overcome that threshold, ""The Projected Man"" is a 1966 film starring Bryant Halliday (""Devil Doll"") as Dr. Paul Steiner, who with costar Mary Peach as Dr. Patricia Hill is trying to perfect a machine that will project matter from one place to another (it's kind of like ""The Fly"" without all the drosophila mandibles). It has been perfected for inanimate objects and after some adjustments a monkey is successfully sent through the device.

All is not as it seems at the lab, though, and there's political intrigue and a sabotage subplot that isn't really satisfactorily explained, though what is clear is that Steiner's boss Dr. Blanchard (Norman Wooland) is a double-crosser with a keen interest to see Steiner fail for his own purposes, presumably financial, but that part of the story is both ill-defined and extremely boring so I may have nodded off among all the talk about grant money appropriation. Steiner is determined to put on a memorable demonstration for the visiting Professor Lembach from Geneva (Gerard Heinz), and boy is it! Steiner gets a curvaceous assistant to help him materialize in Lembach's anteroom, but things go horribly wrong, of course, and Steiner gets disfigured and electrified in the process, leading to no end of plot complications and mayhem.

Director Ian Curteis was fired as the film was being completed and it was finished by John Croydon (who wrote the screenplay and was not credited for his directorial stint), although I doubt it changed the final outcome substantially. The film is a mixed bag, which is why I gave it three stars: it has some compelling plot points and some decent acting (and some subpar performances, too) but the effects were laughable even by mid-1960's standards (the film was shot on a modest budget) and the pacing is extremely inconsistent. It is definitely a more European take on the subject matter than later American productions about similar predicaments, and while that's neither a virtue or vice per se, it definitely leads to a much slower film.

If you have a region-free DVD player this is a curiosity that those of us who love 1960s monster movies will enjoy, but there are certainly more exciting films out there if you are not wholly committed to the genre.",1436832000,7,2450,4.842482100238663
7920066,4,B00004CUZG,"Wonderful movie!  I love the makeup for its' time, reminiscent of Phantom of the Opera.  Now you can get it NTSC region 0!  Get it from mariobavafan at yahoo.com which is widescreen and includes trailer!",1430784000,3,203,4.742857142857143
7920067,4,B00004CUZG,"Great little horror feature from England. The plot has been done before like in the fly,return of the fly but the acting is very good,the picture quality great and the monsters very ugly. The story concerns a scientist working for the British government who is trying to transport matter,the director has got in financial trouble and gangsters or foreign governments force him to sabotage the scientist test so he loses funding and they can steal the project. The test fails when a fellow scientist comes to observe the project and the scientist finds work of sabotage. He tries to go through the machine and be sent by telephone to the scientist who had been sent to observe the test. Naturally things go wrong and half his face is turned inside out,plus his body has become electrically charged so his touch kills. Revenge insues. A very good little b movie that horror fans will love",1304640000,4,886,4.759740259740259
7920068,4,B00004CUZG,Classic Sci Fi Horror.  Very hard to find but Surprisingly good story of Matter transfer and Betrayal.  Predates The Fly but uses same Idea of Matter Transfer.,1284163200,2,159,4.851851851851852
