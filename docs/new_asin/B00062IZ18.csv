8037482,5,B00062IZ18,Very good family movies. Great cast of actors. I highly recommend!,1431561600,2,66,5.090909090909091
8037483,1,B00062IZ18,"I know Echo Bridge is not in the same league as Criterion but to date I have found their releases quite satisfactory. No longer. These 2 movies (both on one disc) are so grainy that you would have trouble enjoying the picture on an old analogue system.  Whether it is EB's idea to cut costs by putting both on one disc that has resulted in too much loss in resolution or whether it is just a bad transfer period I don't know. Either way... avoid this double release. Likewise, I'll be avoiding Echo Bridge releases in the future.

BTW The audio was OK but for those with hearing problems, no subtitles.",1406505600,,602,4.414414414414415
