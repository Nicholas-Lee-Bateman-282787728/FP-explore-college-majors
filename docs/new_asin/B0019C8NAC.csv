8273388,5,B0019C8NAC,"I purchased this video recently after it was recommended to me by multiple people and businesses. I got through the first four workout cards before I had my next Olympic distance tri. I'm happy to say that I shaved a minute off my swim time. I'm extremely impressed by how quickly I have seen results. The lamented cards are brilliant. The fact that I can watch a novice do the drill and then turn around and watch an Olympic Gold Medalist do the same drill is awesome. I'm an extremely visual person and this suits me perfectly. If you want to improve your swim, BUY THIS DVD!",1216080000,11,577,4.401869158878505
