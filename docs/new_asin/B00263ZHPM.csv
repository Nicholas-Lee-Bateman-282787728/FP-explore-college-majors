3850749,5,B00263ZHPM,"This 3-DVD set was filmed at the very first Anusara Yoga Grand Gathering in Estes Park, Colorado.  It features Anusara Yoga founder John Friend welcoming the crowd of 800 participants in an opening gathering, leading three master classes, and being interviewed on his thoughts about Anusara Yoga and life in general.  During the Welcome Gathering, Friend talks about the growth and development of Anusara Yoga.  Similarly, in his interview with Denise Benitez, he discusses Anusara as a method, including the association between Anusara Yoga and John Friend the man; he also answers questions about additional issues such as bringing the sacred into class, honoring tradition, and addressing suffering and despair.

The Master Classes feature Friend on stage teaching while one of his students, Tanya Beilke, beautifully demonstrates the postures.  Each Master Class is approximately two hours in length, as it includes an opening talk by Friend, the Anusara invocation chanted by the musical group Shantala, long asana sequences interspersed with additional teaching from Friend, and an ending kirtan (chant), also sung by Shantala.  Although Friend refers to savasana, the sessions conclude directly after the chanting.  I have listed the Main Menus for each disc and have offered some further information for each of the three master class practices below.  [Note:  I have added approximate times for each segment in parentheses.]

DISC 1
Welcome Gathering (25m)
Interview with John Friend (48m)
Master Class Day 1
*Play All (1 hour, 54 minutes)
*Introduction (6m)
*Opening Invocation (11m)
*Warming Up (20m)
*Balancing (16m)
*Backbends, Hip Openers, Twists (26m)
*Forward Bends, Supine Poses (24m)
*Ending Kirtan with Shantala (11m)
Day 1 is a bit shorter and gentler.  However, Friend still gets in a wide variety of postures, from triangle, side angle, half moon, and standing splits to pigeon, bridge, and wheel.  For forward bends, Friend seems to particularly like pyramid pose, as he includes this in all three practices.

DISC 2
Master Class Day 2
*Play All (2 hours, 22 minutes)
*Introduction and Invocation (34m)
*Warming Up (15m)
*Standing Sequence (20m)
*Balancing (24m)
*Backbends, Hip Openers, and Stretches (36m)
*Forward Bends (20m)
*Ending Kirtan with Shantala (10m)
Friend introduces longer sequences and a bit of partner work (warm-up stretches and balance assistance) to Day 2.  He adds plank/chaturanga flows to the standing series as well and has Tanya perform a handstand demonstration at the end of the standing postures.  Friend also increases the challenge with both the balance work (standing hand-to-foot, side plank, boat, crow) and the backbends (cradle, lizard, pigeon, bow, bridge, wheel).  Forward bends again include pyramid but also add a nice reclined leg series as well as a head-to-knee series.

DISC 3
Master Class Day 3
*Play All (2 hours, 43 minutes)
*Introduction and Invocation (23m)
*Warming Up (21.5m)
*Standing Sequence (27m)
*Twists and Hand Balances (14.5m)
*Backbends (48m)
*Forward Bends (7.5m)
*Ending Kirtan with Shantala (21m)
Day 3 starts of similarly to Day 2:  Friend begins with partner stretching, performs a similar warm-up flow, and includes balance poses such as hand-to-foot, half moon, and a half moon variation during the standing sequence.  However, this session adds more challenging one-arm balance work and an extended backbend sequence.  During the latter, Friend provides detailed instruction for King Pigeon pose, using not only Tanya to demonstrate but also a member of the band, Benjy, as well as another audience member.

Throughout the practices, Friend does not devote much time to discussing Anusara Yoga's Universal Principles of Alignment, particularly the loops and spirals; instead, he focuses on joy, from enjoying the breath to enjoying the presence of each other.  His sense of humor is ever-present, frequently soliciting laughter from the audience.  (Surprisingly, the cameras rarely scan over the large gathering of people in the room, instead remaining trained on John, Tanya, and occasionally, the band Shantala.)

This DVD set is described by Yoga Journal as being for all levels of practitioners, but I'm not sure that I'd agree; although I don't think prior experience with Anusara is necessary, I do think that those brand new to yoga might feel a bit overwhelmed by the intensity of the long class sessions--really, they are more like workshops--and the challenge level of some of the postures.  (Furthermore, Friend uses mainly Sanskrit terminology to cue the poses).  However, no inversions are included in any of the practices, and Friend does encourage a spirit of playfulness, making these sessions accessible to a wide range of experienced yoga students.

For those who, like myself, have never had the opportunity to see John Friend live, I can't say that this set is just as good as being there, but I can say that it is the next best thing.  Although the workshop-like format may not easily lend incorporating these discs into regular home practice, the exposure to Friend in this way is a unique experience and one that I would recommend highly.",1245369600,4,5152,5.319358816276202

8351815,4,B00263ZHPM,"I needed a DVD that would aid in my home practice.  I enjoy this style of yoga.  Unfortunately, my yoga instructor has taken a new job.",1370908800,,135,4.153846153846154
8351816,4,B00263ZHPM,"After having one class with a teacher who mentioned anusara yoga, I was determined to find additional resources on it. She told me that her focus on alignment came from the anusara school of thought. I tried all DVDs that came up when I did a search for the term ""anusara,"" but until this one, none of them provided the instruction on alignment that I'd hoped for.

On my first viewing of the first DVD, I hated this program. John Friend talked a lot about non-physical energy and the type of thing commonly referred to as ""New Age"" talk. Chakras and the like. I am not a fan of such things, to put it mildly. But because this was my last hope for an anusara resources, I tried the second DVD. Thank goodness. Even though the wooga-wooga continues (as is his right -- surely many people want that out of a yoga experience), the physical instruction itself is brilliant.

The programs are long but entirely worth it if you can get past the chakra/chi/energy business. (Apologies to anybody who really values that aspect of the program. I'm including this warning for those of us who have a difficult time with that aspect.) His points on alignment have transformed my practice. I am able to find deeper poses while still being restful in them, and I'm doing poses that didn't seem possible just weeks before starting these DVDs. At no point do I push myself into poses that feel strained or unsafe. Instead, he walks you through progressions until suddenly you find yourself ready to get into the full pose that you thought was far beyond you. Brilliant, really.

His demeanor took a short while to grow on me, but now I enjoy the playfulness. And the woman who demonstrates the poses does a fantastic job and has a great attitude.

Of the approximately 25 yoga DVDs I've used in my life (some much more than others, of course), this one has helped me the most. It's not great for everyday practice unless you have two hours, but otherwise -- highly, highly recommended.",1354060800,3,1969,4.5852272727272725
8351817,4,B00263ZHPM,"im only through the first disc, and i skipped the interview and the opening, i don't really seem to care much for the ideology being promoted, ""feeling energy"" isn't really my thing, but if thats what you're into change my four star review to a five star review and continue reading.

seems to be this is very similar form to the anusara class ive been taking on and off for five plus years, save for the excessive vocabulary and a singular moment of rambling about travel, which, luckily came after shivasana (ill explain). the form basically went as such: couple sun salutations to warm up, some lunges and twists, couple balancing poses, PIGEON, runners stretches, back bends, sitting twists, then something random im forgetting, and then shivasana. all around this was a great stand-in for ordinary class and im looking forward to the next two discs.

the only confusing thing was that after shivasana - which for some reason only lasted for about thirty seconds (so hit pause if you wanna enjoy it a little more) - he did some more leg stretches, but whatever. these stretches came after the rambling.

my only real qualm was kumbaya song at the end, but i watched it in fast forward and it was pretty funny looking, the lead singer has really found his calling.",1333152000,,1267,4.698198198198198
8351818,4,B00263ZHPM,"This is a good collection for beginner to intermediate students.  He starts off fairly easy, and throws in some more challenging poses toward the end of discs 2 and 3.  It's cool to get the experience of a John Friend workshop without shelling out the couple hundred bucks to see him in person.  He occasionally addresses the home viewer, which is nice, too, and the musical jams at the end of each disc are wonderful.

Although it's no substitute for attending a class in person, it's great if you either don't have an Anusara class near you or just can't afford to take one as often as you'd like.",1268265600,6,599,4.467889908256881
8351819,5,B00263ZHPM,I love this Dvd set- so grace filled and joyful.  What is fabulous is how John Friend makes yoga so doable and I am not sore afterwards like some workouts.  I think it is because the principles are so completely balanced that the joints and muscles work together with grace.,1261612800,3,274,4.46
8351820,5,B00263ZHPM,"I was reluctant to order this set because of the sheer size of the group gathered (800 students???!!!).  Even though I love Friend's Omega series, I didn't see how the material could be presented in a clear enough manner in the even vaster scope of this event.  However, the focus is so consistently on the model Tanya (who executes the postures and transitions beautifully) and Friend's instruction and sequencing that the set is a real winner for me.

And the chapter points have been a great help in integrating sections of these practices into my home routine.  I focus mostly on my own practice, but like to add in material from DVDs and CDs for spice, balance and sometimes (even) depth.  I've taken class with various anusara teachers for years and did two days with Friend when he came to NYC during his Mystery tour and love how the DVD releases help reinforce what I've learned.

Great grounding in the standing poses and exploration of hip openers and then there's the fun circusy stuff that you can try just because.  Day 3 is my fave.  It's been with me to Argentina, and now it's keeping me company in Spain.

This set is best for people with a little yoga experience under their belt.  If you're really attached to fast flow vinyasa, this set may not be for you.  Anusara is a strength and spirit building practice, with long holds and explorations of the poses through the anusara principles involving organic and muscular energy and the spirals and all the other stuff that makes this style so flavorful.  I would use the word alignment of course, but that term has become so over and miss used that it's pretty meaningless today.

My own yoga background: I've been doing daily yoga since the mid-90s, taken class since 2000 or so, completed teacher training and done a little teaching.",1258934400,25,1803,4.667721518987341
8351821,4,B00263ZHPM,"We are so fortunate to be able to buy items like these, well recorded, well presented. It is almost as good as being there. John Friend gives a good class with inspirations and messages. These classes are well balanced with secret knowledge leaking out. Aimed at the average yogi, but sometimes mentions a little more advanced posture to work towards. Well done! A beautiful asset to my bookshelf and practice. Thank you!",1255564800,2,421,4.861111111111111
8351822,5,B00263ZHPM,"I love the DVD I received and use it very often. It adds to my joy! Thanks for sending it so quickly and in such great shape. Namaste, Karen",1251244800,,140,3.8620689655172415
8351823,5,B00263ZHPM,"While I wish I could have attended this event in person, the dvd is the next best thing. John Friend, founder of Anusara yoga, skillfully and playfully leads three master classes while clearly articulating the alignment and keeping the practitioner focused on the breath and the deeper meaning of the practice. Classes are both accessible and challenging. Depending on your level of practice, you may sit some poses out, but John offers modifications, and for me, being challenged with more advanced poses just inspires me to want to keep learning. The poses are beautifully and precisely demonstrated by Certified Anusara yoga teacher, Tanya Beilke. Enjoy!",1250726400,13,657,5.266666666666667
8351824,5,B00263ZHPM,"All i have to say is, ""WOW"", I have heard about john and took a chance on this and it was MUCH more than I thought it was.  Great set and he made me think, work, experience and feel like he was in the room with me.  Very good instructor.",1245974400,7,237,3.72
