8506373,5,B006Y0RJM2,"Overheard 2 is a sequel to the film Overheard. It has a different story line and although some of the actors are the same as in Overheard they play different parts in this movie. You do not  have to have watched Overheard to understand Overheard 2. They can be watched in either order.  This movie like Overheard is also about the Hong Kong stock market. This time it involves insider trading by a Triad group and Surveillance by the Commercial Crime Bureau division of the police force. When I first watched this movie I thought that I liked Overheard better as I had watched that movie first but upon subsequent viewings I came to like Overheard 2 just as much as Overheard. There are some very good car chase scenes in this movie with one involving a motorcycle and an exciting foot chase as the cops try to hunt down Daniel Wu in downtown Hong Kong as Wu lets firbombs go off in the streets in an attempt to evade the police. This is another intense, exciting crime drama with great actors and a solid plot. I particularly thought Lau Ching Wau was excellent as the stock broker for the Triads. Louis Koo also puts in a good performance as the head Crime Bureau detective. Daniel Wu is a guy out for revenge but you come to feel for him too. There is a lot of background character development in this movie of the main players and that makes the characters seem much more like real people you can become interested in, relate to and care about. A definite 5 star movie for me!!!",1335571200,,1482,4.405109489051095
