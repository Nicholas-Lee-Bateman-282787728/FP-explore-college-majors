3830483,4,B0020PFNF0,"If you have not seen this movie yet, I highly recommend you do! Just for the reason my title suggests! Marcia and her daughter play mother and daughter in the movie Home and do an amazing job! I could not believe that even though Inga (played by Marcia) went through her ordeal by herself! Her husband is to busy with work, which I believe is an excuse so he doesn't have to deal with his wife's illness! As for Eulala - Marcia's real life daughter, she can act! See the movie!",1403308800,,477,4.252747252747253
3830484,4,B0020PFNF0,"A little hard to follow but it may have been the mood I was in. Great cinematography. If you have been in a family systen with an addict, it may prove healing.",1261872000,3,159,4.0
3830485,5,B0020PFNF0,"This is an excellent poignant movie that is well worth seeing. Marcia Gay Harden and her daughter are fantastic actors. If you're considering bringing your daughters, would be mid-teens or older--very moving, emotional and not always kind relationship between mother who is battling alcoholism and recovering from breast cancer with her daughter and a disconnected husband.",1258416000,3,373,5.678571428571429
3830486,3,B0020PFNF0,I was a bit dissappointed with this movie. Such great cast but the storline was very slow.,1252886400,,90,4.352941176470588
8348595,4,B0020PFNF0,This movie was okay for a drama.,1493856000,,32,3.7142857142857144
8348596,2,B0020PFNF0,"I'm a huge fan of Marcia Gay Harden and she never disappoints with her range and ability to bring anything character to life, however this story challenges ones ability to stay focused and interested as it moves at an excruciatingly slow pace. I had to force myself to keep watching and found myself fast forwarding just to see if the story would sooner or later capture my interest but it never did. Her daughter did an amazing job and it wasn't a matter of acting; the story just never got me intrigued or wanting to see what would happen next.",1490572800,,546,4.47
8348597,5,B0020PFNF0,I can only imagine what it would be like to act opposite a parent this Mother and Daughter duo is a wonderful team. Marcia and her daughter did a wonderful job I can't even imagine how they were able to do one particular scene which was hard for me to watch the first time I hope to see the now grown  Eulalia on the big screen again maybe perhaps directing her mom this time,1487030400,,375,4.0675675675675675
8348598,4,B0020PFNF0,"Liked the honest portrayal of the relationship between real life mother and daughter...Marcia  Gay Harden and Eulala Scheel. Very sweet, uncomplicated movie.",1481241600,,157,6.136363636363637
8348599,5,B0020PFNF0,"This was a great movie; I appreciate movies that reflect realistic perspectives on human interaction, and Marcia Gay Harden in this movie is alternately PAINFULLY and DELIGHTFULLY accurate in her portrayal of that. All of the actors did a wonderful job; and the script was well-written to allow us to feel sympathy for all at some point, (I'm not a big fan of the idea that life is made up of ONLY villains and victims). The fact that her own daughter is playing opposite her in this particular movie could offer her opportunities to be a adjunct professor, or consultant on ""how to work with children on set without damaging them for life...""; LOL! Seriously, this is a ""thinking person's"" movie; - The test of such a movie for me is that I don't want to multi-task while watching it. Believe me, I used closed captions to catch all the meaning,  AND put down the knitting while this one was on.",1474588800,,896,4.565217391304348
8348600,4,B0020PFNF0,"I can hardly watch Marcia Gay Harden for some reason; it's a personal chemistry thing. That being said, I've never seen her as good as she is in this one.  It's a rather complex character study of a woman in transition and a family in trouble.  The mother/child relationship is terribly honest, at terms moving and disturbing.  This film is ultimately well-acted, well-written, and thought-provoking, and well worth the time.  An interesting tidbit: the young actress playing the daughter is Harden's real life daughter.",1466553600,2,520,5.154761904761905
8348601,2,B0020PFNF0,"Guess it would have been an OK movie, but kept reloading 4-6 times.",1459814400,,67,4.230769230769231
8348602,1,B0020PFNF0,Audio difficult to understand because they spoke quietly and background music was too loud. I did not watch entire movie because I did not like the direction the story was going.,1451174400,,178,4.774193548387097
8348603,4,B0020PFNF0,Marcia Gay Harden brings her character to life with depth and expert acting. Very interesting movie - I recommend it!,1449014400,,117,4.9
