I like all of the above and really enjoyed this movie.",1123804800,2,117,4.086956521739131
2301794,5,B0009ML2V0,"I went to see this in the theater.  The tension is pretty non-stop from the beginning to the end.  The whole time you are wondering who the killer is and I don't think anyone I saw with had it figured out.

I was originally interested because of Adrian Paul but Grayson McCouch really steals the show.

Definitely worth seeing.",1123027200,6,327,4.491525423728813
2301795,4,B0009ML2V0,"Parking garages have always been a little creepy to me.  However, after seeing this movie the phrase ""park at your own risk"" takes on an all new meaning.  Newcomer Grayson McCouch is a business man trapped in an underground garage who finds himself being chased by an insane truck driver.  Reminded me of films like ""Joyride"" where a hidden killer lurks behind the wheel.  While the romantic/sex scenes didn't add up and I wish they didn't reveal the killer at the end, overall this movie was more entertaining than many big budget action movies from the last year.  **** out of *****",1122336000,6,584,4.686274509803922
2301796,3,B0009ML2V0,"Seems like the directing could have been better. The lead actor handled his part as well as the bad guy. Others seemed a little stiff. Some aspects strained plausibility,  but otherwise decent enough for watching during treadmill workout.",1454112000,,238,5.2631578947368425

2301798,4,B0009ML2V0,"The killer in the car-park is now a pretty standard storyline. ""Throttle"" adds a bit of a twist to it. The twist is not dreadfully original. In fact, I figured out what it was fairly early in the movie. But the acting and photography is good. There are some good action scenes. Personally, I thought the wife was pretty and also a good actress. I would have liked to see more of her. I enjoyed watching the movie to the end. It isn't Oscar material but definitely a good way to spend a little over an hour.",1446249600,,506,4.22680412371134

2301803,4,B0009ML2V0,"Once upon a time, movies lived up their name. They lived up to where the word 'movie' comes from: motion picture. Enter Throttle. After spending $4.99 on yet another over-praised blockbuster on Amazon, I came across this purely by accident while surfing for something with a riveting, sustained pulse. This baby moves so well, I overlooked its not-a-few slower stretches with pleasure and forgiveness. Grayson McCouch comes across with the kind of screen confidence that, in the 1970s and 80s, would have resulted in roles once reserved for the likes of Steve McQueen. James Seale is the kind of director who, in the 1970s, would have been lauded far and wide. You can't look at Throttle and not at least think Spielberg/Duel. The entire production scales thrilling heights on clearly very little, except its never-ending verve. I am one of those moviegoers who still remembers what movies feel like when they are intelligently edited (the epitome of which is Scorsese's GoodFellas), so I looked up IMDB to call out both Peder Morgenthaler and Seale, who put together Throttle in the cutting room. Am I over-selling it? Probably. Does the movie know its own limitations? Absolutely. With a title like Throttle, is it honest in its kinetic ambitions?

2301812,4,B0009ML2V0,"This movie is another one I'd heard nothing about but rented it from Netflix and felt like I could at least sample it.
I finally watched the whole flick, thanks mainly to a fantastic Grayson McCouch. He's totally new to me but he had the star role and he literally ran with it.
Of course there are a few holes in the plot--a man is trapped underground in a multi-level parking garage--and his enemy drives a truck to kill him--but this is forgiven given the overall excellence of production and performances.

One fault were the flashbacks that interrupted the tension. Also, why didn't our hero just walk up to the main entrance and wait for a car--or, were all the fire alarms out of order?

In any case, this was a fun two hours of tension and excitement and now I'm going to see what other movies Grayson McCouch is in so I can check him out. He's great.",1368230400,,858,4.389937106918239
2301813,5,B0009ML2V0,"This movie was really good. It has a lot of non stop action !

2301814,3,B0009ML2V0,"Films like Throttle are why I watch direct-to-video films. There's almost no budget, no one of name in it, and still the movie has you on the edge of your seat the whole time. Throttle was very entertaining and did a lot with what little they had. A businessman, leaving work finds himself stuck, in the basement of a parking garage, with nowhere to go, and a killer on his tale. It's a definite thrill ride, albeit a very predictable one. I'm no super sleuth, but I had the killer pegged within the first 25 minutes. The acting, is what you'd expect in these types of films. Some were pretty good, while others were terrible. The lead, Grayson McCouch was great. He doesn't have much under his belt, but if he keeps putting on performances like this one, it won't be long until everyone knows his name. Throttle is electrifying and exciting, but isn't going to blow anyone away. If you're looking for something simple and entertaining, be sure to check it out!",1361577600,,961,4.5606936416184976
2301815,2,B0009ML2V0,"Two unlikable characters plot a robbery of sorts (it's never seen but 10.6 million dollars is mentioned in passing).  We have to take their word that they were successful.  The movie, but for too many flashbacks, takes place in a parking garage of undetermined levels.  People are few and far between and only provide fodder for the killer (an obvious choice among a limited cast).  There's a lot of running, a lot of squealing tires, crashes galore, impossible stunts (I don't know of any person who could outrun a vehicle).  Preposterous to the nth degree, very little makes sense.  The main character/crook (Grayson McCouch) has several opportunities to kill the driver of the truck who's after him, but doesn't seize on any of these few chances.  It's a slim plot stretched beyond its capacity to entertain.",1328745600,,811,4.919117647058823
2301816,4,B0009ML2V0,"I have been a fan of Grayson McCouch for a very long time, he has the ablility to bring drama and realism to any situation just by his facial expressions.  This is quite an interesting situation where he is literally fighting for his life and a couple of times it looks like he definately won't make it.  The ending was a little silly because I don't know why his wife would be hunting him down so late, why didn't she try sooner to contact him.  But I guess that wouldn't have made him the hero in saving her also.  It wasn't a great movie, but it did keep me glued to the screen.",1286236800,,581,4.115044247787611
2301817,3,B0009ML2V0,"Directed by James Seale, Throttle (2005) is an effective thriller, but one that requires you to accept a very unlikely premise.  If you can, you may find this strangely manipulative tale set in a parking structure, to be quite entertaining.

Tom Weaver (Grayson McCouch) and his partner Gavin Matheson (Adrian Paul) are involved in a shady scheme to acquire millions.  Exactly what they are up to is not explained, but after executing their plan, Weaver has second thoughts.  After arguing with Matheson in the parking garage of their office building, he backs out of the deal.  An angry Matheson departs.  Weaver attempts to follow, but finds that his car has been sabotaged and won't run.  The doors and elevators have card readers, and Weaver who does not have his access card, finds himself ""trapped"" on the fifth level of the underground parking structure.

In this situation, most rational people would simply walk out of the structure.  It may take a while, but you will eventually get out.  This obvious path is not taken, which allows this drama to continue.  Another key factor is the lack of cell phone service, which prevents Weaver from calling for help.

Weaver is suddenly confronted by a SUV that attempts to run him down, but unbelievably outruns the vehicle several times.  Matters turn more deadly, when he asks a woman leaving in her car for assistance, while on Level 4.  Weaver is backed up against a wall and almost crushed by the SUV, but mysteriously his life is spared.  Snippets of Weaver's backstory keep unfolding in a series of flashbacks.  Bits and pieces are revealed, but the overall picture isn't very clear until near the end.

The level of violence escalates, as Weaver's long strange journey through the almost empty structure continues.  Despite the ridiculous premise, and the cheap trick of obscuring the garage with mist, the film is successful at creating suspense, and generating genuine scares.  One is when Weaver manages to crawl on the roof of the mysterious SUV, only to have the sweat dripping from his nose onto the windshield, give his location away to the unseen driver, who then tries to fling him from the roof.

Weaver should just continue on his way out, but on Level 3 he stops to ask for help, and again almost gets killed.  This guy is pure poison, as everyone he asks for help, winds up dead.  Still, it is kind of fun watching him bolt like a jackrabbit, continuing to outrun that SUV.

Throttle is pretty well executed, and acted, featuring some decent cinematography, and nicely executed stunts, within the close quarters of the garage.  Grayson McCouch is quite entertaining as the hapless, continuously squinting, Tom Weaver.  Dan Mundell turns in a fun performance as Eddie the garage attendant.  There are some big problems, however.  Besides the utterly ridiculous premise, and completely idiotic overdramatic ending, the film has a basic problem with pacing.  Things just take way too long.  Tom Weaver arrives at his car about 1am, and finally reaches the garage entrance gate about 6am.  They should have tightened things up, five hours to navigate five levels is insanity.",1278460800,,3144,4.922053231939164
2301818,1,B0009ML2V0,Why didn't he just wait by the doors for other cars to exit and then walk out?,1221868800,,78,3.6470588235294117
2301819,5,B0009ML2V0,"Wish Grayson McCough would make it big. He has great screen presence. This was a great movie. Same old same old theme, but it kept me at the edge of my seat. Pretty intense, I'd recommend it to anyone.",1168473600,,201,4.17948717948718
2301820,2,B0009ML2V0,"`Throttle' (aka `No Way Up' begins effectively. It builds up the tension considerably in the opening 20 minutes, and then suddenly stops moving. It is a great pity that the film, of which actions are competently done, just couldn't keep the initial pace through its 90 minutes.

It is one of the numerous clones of Spielberg's `The Duel,' but the film sets its location in underground car park, which is a very clever choice. One businessman Tom Weaver (reminding us of the name of leading actor in `The Duel') enters the underground parking lot around 12:00 pm, but he soon realizes that someone has designs against him. And in his case a truck (not monstrous, but still huge) chases him around the parking lot.

There are several characters who might be seeking for the life of Tom. But the mystery part of the film, some of which are seen in the several flashbacks, is perfunctory (and probably unnecessary). The main attraction of the film is its stunts, and they are very good. The actors - Grayson McCouch as Tom, Adrian Paul as his business partner, and Amy Locane as Tom's wife - are all good, especially McCouch, who appears as slightly arrogant guy whose ego must be humiliated by the cat-and-mouse chase.

But for all its great set-up, `Throttle' runs out of ideas pretty earlier than it should. You see, Tom is trapped in the underground space, and a truck chases him around. The cell phone is dead. The exits are all locked. Now, before you watch the film, you know there is little else for the film to do, and actually it has few options to choose. It tries to stretch the story by including several episodes, but none of them works. Flashbacks are boring, and the characters often act in the most unbelievable way, which only makes the running time unnecessarily longer. Why cannot Tom escape from the place when he encounters not less than three people after being attacked by the truck? Why doesn't he think of using a gun? I love watching action films, and I can stop disbelieving while enjoying them, but so many plot holes (and the black-outs which suggest we have to wait for the next action to begin for a while) are too much for me.

`Throttle' starts very well, but soon runs out of gas. It is an enjoyable B-action, has thrilling action sequences, and the acting of Grayson McCouch is impressive, but it still needs more tricks to keep us interested in the story.",1135728000,3,2388,4.625
2301821,4,B0009ML2V0,"THROTTLE is one of the best ""Duel"" copies out there.  If it weren't for it's over the top and unsatisying ending, I'd have rated it higher.  Writer/director James Seale sets up a labyrinthine plot which keeps the audience guessing on who is driving the nasty truck.  Grayson McCouch gives a visceral, masculine performance as our hero, a would be thief who finds himself trapped in a parking garage with a demented truck driver.  Numerous flashback sequences give us plenty of suspects, and the villian's identity comes as a bit of a surprise,which is to Seale's credit.  Unfortunately, the confrontation between our hero and the villain isn't written as sharply as the rest of the movie and the villain's fate is a copout.  The movie deserved better.  Still McCouch and company (especially Amy Locane and Adrian Paul) keep us interested.",1131062400,4,838,4.985611510791367
2301822,1,B0009ML2V0,Need I say more? This is a c-grade garbage. Probably the whole movie costs under $10k to make in some underground garage. How can people give it anything above 1 star is beyond my imagination. Avoid it!,1127779200,3,202,4.486486486486487
2301823,4,B0009ML2V0,"I really enjoyed this movie.  I initially bought it because Adrian Paul is in it, but enjoyed it on its own.  I was skeptical at first about the whole story taking place in the parking garage, but it worked.  I enjoyed the suspense, unknown factors, twists & turns as well as trying to figure out the who and why.  The flashback style was good in moving the story and added just enough to keep you thinking and guessing.  It held my attention and interest throughout.  I know my teenage son is going to love the action and suspense too.",1126224000,7,536,4.363636363636363
2301824,3,B0009ML2V0,"Grayson Mccouch is a yuppie trapped by a killer truck in an underground garage in this thriller obviously inspired by Spielberg's ""Duel"". Director James Seale knows how to create paranoia, suspense and terror.",1125792000,4,209,5.363636363636363
2301825,5,B0009ML2V0,"I don't recall seeing this movie in theatrical release so it may have gone straight to video.  Since its better than most of the other movies I've seen this year I'm not sure why is may have gone straight to video.

The plot revolves around a youngish corporate executive involved in some mysterious dealings and now someone is trying to kill him.  As he desperately fights to stay alive he's trying to figure out who's out to get him.  I was on the edge of my seat through out the movie.  I won't say anything else about the plot lest I give away too much other than it has a great surprise ending.

I'm glad a friend recommended this to me.",1125532800,5,642,4.264462809917355
8063354,5,B0009ML2V0,"Parking garages are inherently scary places and It quickly becomes apparent why. This movie did not disappoint as I'm a sucker for crazy car movies. ""Throttle"" was full of suspenseful action. The flashback scenes took up maybe 15 minutes of the movie. I see people complaining about them and don't know why. The monster truck in this movie does have a driver but Its not a secret and the truck is downright scary. I love that I got to watch it for free!
