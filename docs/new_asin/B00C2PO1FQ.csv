5689124,1,B00C2PO1FQ,"I thought this might be a cute movie for my preschooler. Wrong! The animation is TERRIBLE, looks homemade. And the first scenes of the movie include a bird yelling at and punching a cat in the face. We just turned it off and watched something we already had on hand. What a disappointment! Wish I had researched first.",1372377600,3,318,4.5
5689125,1,B00C2PO1FQ,"Everyone in our house had no clue as to what was going on the whole time the movie was on. None of the mouths of the people talking matched with their mouths and the animation was horrible. Like the other review, my kids said it was bad and they usually like anything.",1371945600,3,268,4.173076923076923
5689126,1,B00C2PO1FQ,Bad animation and monotone voice overs my children even said it was bad which is saying something because they will watch anything,1371772800,5,130,4.954545454545454
8576677,1,B00C2PO1FQ,So weird... Def low budget film,1469232000,,31,4.333333333333333
8576678,1,B00C2PO1FQ,Horrible.  And the characters look baked out of thier gourds.  I think whoever wrote this crap sure was.  Not suitable for kids with the subject matter at times. Hard to follow as well.  Just flat out annoying.,1415232000,,210,4.594594594594595
8576679,1,B00C2PO1FQ,"I don't even understand how this would make ANY money, I watched it on netflix and even then I felt cheated, definitely not even good for a laugh. Poor sound, poor animation, abysmal plot. To think any child would watch this is an absolute joke, a joke that is funnier than anything this movie could ever wish to be.",1387065600,,316,4.372881355932203
8576680,1,B00C2PO1FQ,"This is hands down the lamest excuse for a movie my family has ever seen. Take my word for it and save your money before renting this! Or if you have to spend it, go buy a sharp pencil and stab it in your eye..... It would be more enjoyable than this sad excuse of a movie.",1381017600,,273,3.807017543859649
8576681,1,B00C2PO1FQ,Dont buy or rent this movie unless you are 2 years old. I wasted 30 min of my life trying to watch it.,1375401600,,102,3.4782608695652173
8576682,1,B00C2PO1FQ,"I agree with most of the reviewers here. My children (aged 4 and 10) are typically easy to please when it comes to movies. This is the first cartoon/animated movie of ANY variety they have rejected. They picked it out as a rental last night because the movie they wanted was out of stock and they thought the box looked cute (plus my kids like bugs, lol). They asked me to turn it off only about 30 minutes into it. Very difficult to follow, drab sound, animation not completely horrible but when compared to Pixar or Dreamworks it's quite lame. I cannot honestly think of any English audience that would enjoy this movie.",1375142400,,622,4.513274336283186
8576683,1,B00C2PO1FQ,"It was Saturday night and the movie selection at the Red Box was a bit thin.  Brought this sorry excuse for a movie home for the kids and it literally made my eyes and ears bleed, plus I'm not certain but it may have given me a brain tumor.  It was so awful it gets my official vote for worst movie EVER... it even made my two year old cry and he likes anything.  I understand it is an English dubbed Russian made movie, but I think the person who wrote the English script just watched the original on mute and tried to make-up a ""story"" (I use that term lightly) on the fly because it absolutely makes no sense and there are NO redeeming qualities.  I can't believe that a paid professional in Russia could have written such a horrific script if they tried. The computer animation looks like it was done by a middle school computer science class as a rough-draft to their final project and the audio is so horrible that it sounds like it was done on someone's home cassette deck.  Finally, they must have pulled homeless people off of the street to do the voice work because I've never heard anything that was so amateur... it is just plain embarrassing.  Amazon won't let me rate this movie negative stars, but I would if I could.",1375142400,,1232,4.334782608695652
8576684,1,B00C2PO1FQ,"can't believe that any studio would produce the movie. Use of language ie. Stupid, loser, fat and other derogatory language not suitable for very young children. Looks like a 5th grader wrote it and drawn by their 6th grade brother.  Couldn't get past the first 10 mins. Steer clear.  Sound was horrible. Looks and sounds like it was re dubed into English .",1374796800,,357,4.650793650793651
8576685,3,B00C2PO1FQ,"REVIEWER ALERT: Although unaccredited except as a voice, my son David Yuzuk, actually wrote the English script and arranged for all of the voices on this animated cartoon from Russia. This was an adult and politically oriented cartoon in Russia--converting it to a children's story was not easy, but it was done quite nicely.

Unfortunately those responsible for the sound quality were irresponsible and the impact of the dialogue is ruined. The sound is murky. That said, this is a visual success and the story is a positive one for young children.

My suggestion is to rent the DVD, it's $3.99 here at Amazon, and let your child decide how good it is.",1374624000,,653,4.769911504424779
8576686,1,B00C2PO1FQ,"This is the worst animated movie I've ever seen.  The voice acting is terrible! The characters all talk at the same time so you can't hear any of the dialogue, though I suppose it doesn't matter as there is no plot to speak of.

Absolutely awful.",1373241600,,246,4.326086956521739
