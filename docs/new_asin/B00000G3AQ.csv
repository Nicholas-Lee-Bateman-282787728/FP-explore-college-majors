1214829,4,B00000G3AQ,"Gene Autry was a recording artist, a radio performer, and a business man, and in his films he played Gene Autry, a recording artist,a radio performer----etc. This strategy, plus his singing, helped to make him the No. 1 Singing cowboy and it's all  there in this film. The movie also shows that he knew the value of a good supporting cast, in this case including Ann Miller, who became a major star in Musicals, comedian Shnozzle Durante,
and Gabby Hayes. Players of this calibre, plus Gene's delivery of several songs, guarantees an entertaining 84 minutes. Of course I really like it because (a)I first saw it in 1942,(b) I always liked his singing, and it takes me back....",1008288000,,676,4.728813559322034

7908833,4,B00000G3AQ,"While I've always liked and respected Gene Autry - an American hero who was a singing cowboy, a businessman who was the long-time owner of the baseball team now known as the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim, who won their only World Series (as the Anaheim Angels) in 2002, years after Gene's passing - I don't own any of his movies.  When I saw that Ann Miller was in the picture, I checked out her dance routine on YouTube, and, wow, it is fantastic, especially considering that she is only 17.  So I ordered the DVD from an Amazon Merchant.  I hope that the rest of the movie is as entertaining as Annie's dance, which includes her trademark rapid-fire tapping and an ""a cappella"" solo.

The rest of the movie, is, in fact, very entertaining.  Gene returns to his hometown after being named honorary sheriff, and then, when he discovers how crooked the town is, runs for sheriff on a permanent basis and wins, and has a love interest in Julie Shelton (Miller).  The great Jimmy Durante portrays Gene's radio sidekick, and other cast members include Barbara Allen (a.k.a. Vera Vague), Barton MacLane, Gabby Hayes, Mary Lee, and of course, Champion.  And Gene Autry is no sissy, despite what some people say about singing cowboys.

The DVD is loaded with bonus features, including a 1940 episode of the MELODY RANCH CBS Radio show, which is a mini-version of the movie; reminiscences about the film from Gene and sidekick Pat Buttram from the 1987 Nashville Network series MELODY RANCH THEATER; still photos and promotional material from the movie; a couple of bonus Autry songs, and much more.

Michael Nesmith, a huge Gene Autry fan, named his Videoranch company and Web site in honor of Melody Ranch, which was not only a ranch that Gene actually purchased in 1953, but a movie studio as well; it is now a museum and major tourist attraction.

I cannot believe that one Amazon Merchant is charging $117,653.33 for a new copy of this DVD.  Not even a die-hard Gene Autry collector would go that far!  There is a&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Gene-Autry-Collection/dp/B00000G3AT/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Gene Autry Collection</a>&nbsp;box set available, which includes MELODY RANCH, but it's VHS, not DVD.  So buy one of the less expensive used DVD copies instead.  It's a good movie to show your kids; it has good moral values, a story that makes sense, and Ann Miller is a far better and classier dancer than Miley Cyrus could ever hope to be, and a far better ""Lady"" than Gaga.",1377302400,,2525,4.938534278959811
7908834,5,B00000G3AQ,"Gene Autry's MELODY RANCH is a classic of comedy with Jimmy Durante, Smiley Burnette and so many others combined with Gene's and Mary Lee's vocals.

7908836,3,B00000G3AQ,"Wonderful Ann Miller During Her Teen Years Dancing and Lovely Gene Autry Singing in Melody Ranch (1940 Republic).

Melody Ranch (1940 Republic) starring Gene Autry, Ann Miller, George ""Gabby"" Hayes, Jimmy Durante, Jerome Cowan, and Barton MacLane is an OK ""behind the scenes in Network Radio"" movie mixed with a standard ""B"" cowboy movie plot where a new sheriff (Autry) saves a town dominated by bad guys terrorizing the town until ""the man on the white horse"" arrives, saves the day, and rides off into the sunset with the prettiest girl in town (Ann Miller, only 17 years old in 1940 if her standard biog 1923 birth date is correct...even if it isn't, she was very young and beautiful in this black and white movie, which includes a song and dance sequence, ""My Gal Sal,"" which shows off Miller's incredible dance abilities and breathtaking shapely legs.)

Jimmy Durante is also featured in this movie. He was a major Broadway stage show comedy star along with Bob Hope and Ethel Merman in the Cole Porter ""Red, Hot, and Blue"" stage musical of 1938 only two years before this movie, a major entertainment world star back then, and still relatively young (in his 40's).

Durante's non-western, non-cowboy persona is justified by casting him as a radio show personality part of the ""Gene Autry Radio Show"" which is a centerpiece of the movie.

Ann Miller plays the role of a radio show actress courted by the radio show's ""big boss"" producer, played by Jerome Cowan in yet another ""likeable, classy rich guy who doesn't get the girl"" (see Cowan in both Shall We Dance [1937 MGM] starring Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers where he woos and loses Ginger Rogers, and also in The Maltese Falcon [1941 Warner Bros.] starring Humphrey Bogart and Mary Astor where he woos and loses Mary Astor.....Mary shoots Jerome dead in The Maltese Falcon [1941 Warner Bros.] which is a harsh way to be rejected).

Barton MacLane plays the head bad guy. One of three bad guy brothers in a small, dusty western town called ""Torpedo"" which, in the movie, is Gene Autry's home town.

Gene's home town calls him home from his radio show singer career to be the sheriff back in Torpedo, terrorized by Barton MacLane and his two brothers (brothers who are bad guys also appear in Stagecoach [1939] in the town of ""Lordsburg,"" and also in the movies titled My Darling Clementine [1946 Fox] starring Henry Fonda and in Gunfight At The OK Carral [1956 Paramount] starring Burt Lancaster in a town called ""Tombstone."")

Melody Ranch (1940 Republic) starring Gene Autry and Ann Miller is a more expensive than average, more romantic than average, more polished than average ""B"" western movie from Republic Pictures.

It was placed on the justifiably prestigious Library Of Congress National Film Registry List probably as an homage to ""B"" cowboy movies made before World War II.

It is an OK but not great movie with some of the best singing ever done by Gene Autry and show stopping dancing and sexy leg display by then young, 17 year old Ann Miller (she died at age 80 in 2004, RIP). The LC National Film Registry List honors American movies noted for aesthetic, historic and/or cultural importance, and Melody Ranch (1940 Republic) was picked mostly due to importance historically and culturally, it appears.

7908837,4,B00000G3AQ,"Like many of Autry's pictures, this one's different from your average run of B-westerns, all right, and that's why some film reviewers over the years have acted as if Gene Autry's movies gave them the toothache. But I believe his pictures have to be considered on their own merits, not according to some rigid formula, and on that basis I found this one funny, tuneful, with some excellent action, some good romantic scenes and beautiful cinematography, and a plot that, while it meanders a little, is nonetheless interesting and reasonably believable.

 Radio singing cowboy Gene Autry returns to his hometown Torpedo to be proclaimed Honorary Sheriff. He finds that three brothers, bullies he remembers from his childhood, run the community, and he undertakes to bring real law, order and justice to his hometown.

 Smiley Burnette is absent from this 1940 flick (that year was the peak of Gene's popularity), and in his place are Jimmy Durante and George ""Gabby"" Hayes, two of Hollywood's premier ""characters"" of their era. Durante is hilarious, although occasionally ""over the top,"" and Hayes is his usual cantankerous but capable self. Comedy actress ""Vera Vague"" adds to the humor as Durante's love interest.

 Autry's encounter with the three bullying brothers during the film has its basis in a real incident from his childhood. When in grade school Gene Autry was often chased home by a group of older, bigger boys who didn't like him; his sisters would slam the front gate shut behind him to keep them from catching Gene. His father, witnessing this one day, proclaimed, ""No son of mine is going to hide behind his sisters' skirts!"" The next day, Autry Sr. was at the gate when his son came racing home, the bullies on his heels. He forced Gene to confront the bigger boys, who beat him bloody. But it is believed that Gene Autry learned a lesson from the incident, about standing up for oneself.

 The DVDs recently released of the restored, complete versions of Autry's movies are a godsend to those of us who had seen the earlier ones only on TV ""western"" shows beginning in the 1950s. Those shows often were of battered prints that were then further mutilated to make them fit the program's time limitations. I've seen scenes in these DVDs, especially this one, that I never knew existed.

 This is well worth watching, if you're an Autry fan, or are broadminded enough to view his movies for what they were and are: Different and unorthodox by B-western standards -- but great entertainment.",1191110400,5,2506,4.875294117647059

Date of Death: 2 October 1998 - Studio City, Los Angeles, California

Special footnote, Orvon Gene Autry was an American performer who gained fame as The Singing Cowboy on the radio, in movies and on television --- Discovered by film producer Nat Levine in 1934, he and Burnette made their film debut for Mascot Pictures Corp. ""In Old Santa Fe"" as part of a singing cowboy quartet; he was then given the starring role by Levine in 1935 in the 12-part serial ""The Phantom Empire"" --- Shortly thereafter, Mascot was absorbed by the formation of Republic Pictures Corp. and Autry went along to make a further 44 films up to 1940, all B westerns in which he played under his own name, rode his horse Champion, had Burnette as his regular sidekick and had many opportunities to sing in each film --- Autry became the top Western star at the box-office by 1937, reaching his national peak of popularity from 1940 to 1942. His Gene Autry Flying ""A"" Ranch Rodeo show debuted in 1940 --- Gene Autry is the only celebrity to have five stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, one in each of the five categories maintained by the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce --- Radio, Films, Recordings, Television and Live Theater.

2. Smiley Burnette (aka: Lester Alvin Burnette)
Date of Birth: 18 March 1911 - Summum, Illinois
Date of Death: 16 February 1967 - Encino, California

Second special footnote, Lester Alvin (Smiley) Burnette an American singer-songwriter who could play as many as 100 different musical instruments, was a successful comedy actor in Western films over three decades --- The popularity of Burnette's Frog Millhouse character, with his trademark floppy black hat, was such that when Autry left for World War II service he did sidekicks duties with Eddie Dew, Sunset Carson and Bob Livingston, plus nine other films with Roy Rogers. After leaving Republic Pictures in 1944, Burnette became the sidekick to Charles Starrett at Columbia Pictures in the long Durango Kid series. Starrett starred in the series from 1944 until 1952, and that pairing resulted in more than 50 films. After the Starrett series was over, Burnette joined Autry for his final six films, all released by Columbia Pictures in 1953.

7908839,5,B00000G3AQ,"This movie was a classic western musical. It had the talents of lovely Ann Miller, famous dancer, the fabulous comedy of Jimmy Durante and Gabby Hayes and of course the sweet voice of young Mary Lee. Gene, a radio star, returns to his home town of Torpedo as honorary sheriff for a day and winds up running for a permanent place as sheriff. The bad guys were ruling the town and Gene had to stop them. This was classed as a musical because of the many songs and dance routines, but it was also a classical Autry action movie as only he could make..If you have never been an Autry Fan or seen any of his movies this is the one to start with....Strangly enough, this is the very one that made this Autry collector fall in love with the life and legacy of Gene Autry and I have been collecting since that time....I highly recommend this movie!!!Give it a try and you'll become a fan of America Greatest Singing Cowboy!!",1009756800,16,916,4.362573099415204
