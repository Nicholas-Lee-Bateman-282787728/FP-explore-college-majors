6937572,5,B00RZXWWGU,What a way to kick off this DVD series!  It's the true story of how the heavy metal scene in LA took off!  Cannot wait for the ensuing issues to come out!  Great stuff.,1430784000,2,168,3.8823529411764706
6937573,5,B00RZXWWGU,"This is easily the best music documentary about the 70s L.A. music scene ever made, if not the best music documentary period! There are tons of insider stories that will both surprise you and crack you up - Jon Hyde from Detective's story of a late night encounter with John Bonham is reason enough to get this DVD! - and the storyline leads you thru the formation of the foundation that eventually led to both the 80s Sunset Strip glam scene and the budding L.A. Thrash Metal scene. Great DVD, I highly recommend it.",1428019200,5,517,4.51063829787234

6937606,4,B00RZXWWGU,"Would of been better without Lars Ulrich. Metallica can claim the bay area, but they were not the same type of metal band as the groups in the L.A. scene. May as well of brought out Henry Rollins.",1472515200,,196,4.184210526315789
6937607,1,B00RZXWWGU,"Wayyy too long for no good reason.  Pretty much a bunch of nobody's talking about the past and telling stories about not really  much of anything.  Very amateur, seemed like whoever did it couldn't get anyone to be in it except a couple of washed up ones.  It's long and pretty boring.  the guys voice is not fun fo listen to for that long either.  I feel bad to say this but it's more a waste of time to watch it than a waste of your money.",1470960000,,441,4.011494252873563
6937608,2,B00RZXWWGU,"I bought both Parts 1 & 2, and was disappointed in both, it's basically a guy who was on the seen in the early days that got some
other guys who were on the seen, most of which never made it any further than the local clubs, and they told some stories about the good old days on camera.
there was some interesting stuff about how the scene started, but they could have probably condensed all the interesting stuff down to about twenty minutes. very boring, it dragged a lot. The covers of the discs are misleading, The production is kind of Amateur, low budget.
I do not recommend these discs, save your money.",1468886400,,610,4.359649122807017
6937609,5,B00RZXWWGU,Excellent tale of the musical life on the Sunset Strip!,1463875200,,55,4.6
6937610,5,B00RZXWWGU,I really enjoyed parts 1 and 2. It was great to hear the stories about the bands we heard about and also the bands in the scene that didn't get that record deal . I took pictures of a few of these bands and a few made the film. Glad to be part of it even though I am from Northern California.,1463616000,,292,3.725806451612903
6937611,5,B00RZXWWGU,Great!,1458864000,,6,6.0
6937612,3,B00RZXWWGU,"Way too much talk, and not enough ROCK !  It seemed interesting and I invited a bunch of guys over to watch it.  Everyone in the room agreed it was way to much talk, and not enough rock.  I was hoping to see more live footage, most of what I saw was guys re-living the glory daze, talking about how great it was.  It was great, but what I really wanted more rock and roll.",1457913600,,372,3.92

YES IT MET ALL MY EXPECTATIONS AND IS A PERFECT ADDITION FOR MY PROJECT WITH KETRINA MARIA GORDON.

UNFORTUNATELY LOS ANGELES & CALIFORNIA MAY NOT LET KETRINA DO THIS PROJECT WITH ME, IN THAT CASE I WILL DO IT IN EUROPE.

ALL THE BEST TO YOU,

6937622,5,B00RZXWWGU,Just as described good to see the seen still active.,1440028800,,52,4.3
6937623,5,B00RZXWWGU,FINALLY the true story of the L.A. Hard Rock And Metal scene told by the people who lived it ....  Also on a personal note its nice to Finally wash the bad taste in my mouth left all those years ago by that Hatchet Job Decline of The western civilization part II the metal years. which did nothing but kill the whole scene ... Only my personal view....  BUY THESE FILMS !!!!  You will not be Disappointed ..  AAAA+++  10 stars !!!,1435017600,,430,4.195121951219512
6937624,5,B00RZXWWGU,"Loved the DVD. If you thought you knew everything about metal, after watching this you will learn quite alot of things about bands you were not aware of.  Interviews were great to listen too as the members go back to the days they remember lol. Great production. Job well. Done. Doing review party of part 2 next week",1434153600,2,317,4.4655172413793105

6937626,5,B00RZXWWGU,"Until now, this great era of the early Sunset Strip Metal days had never been thoroughly covered this extensively. Can't wait for Volume 2, to complete this awesome set.",1431129600,,169,4.862068965517241
8696503,5,B00RZXWWGU,"1 of 5 in the DVD series some of the best watching out there, highly recommend. Well done and put together just right and loaded with old lost and often never seen footage. A+ all the way",1524614400,,187,4.081081081081081
8696504,5,B00RZXWWGU,"There are plenty of superlatives that could describe this: interesting, informative, engrossing, educational.  I think it might have been only mildly entertaining, but I was so engrossed, hanging on virtually every word, that I might have neglected the fact that I was also being entertained.  If you are a fan of the Metal Revolution of the 80s, you will get a real kick out of this film.  Keep in mind that it is a documentary, though, in which the history of that Metal Revolution is told through the stories of the L.A. club scene and those who frequented those clubs.  As an educational venture for someone who cares about the music of the era, there aren't enough stars to give.",1519948800,,684,4.675
8696505,5,B00RZXWWGU,"Easy purchase, and received the items when I expected them.  I would purchase from seller again, and recommend to others.",1513900800,,121,5.05
8696506,3,B00RZXWWGU,"If you're looking for material on the bands that are printed on the cover of this DVD, be prepared to be a bit disappointed.  The focus is more on some bands from the late 70's who you have probably have never heard of.  You don't get much on the bands printed on the cover. That being said, it still has a few points of interest. Like how things began in the LA scene. But you only need about 5 or 10 minutes for that.  You get a quick word from an artist you recognize here and there. But if you're a fan of the 80's bands, you're not really going to recognize most of the people being interviewed.  Almost no footage either. Just old pictures.",1501718400,,646,4.144
8696507,5,B00RZXWWGU,"AMAZING series. If you're only able to watch a documentary with lush production and HD shots, this series isn't for you. Yes, its low budget and some of the footage is low quality but what would you really expect from amateur video footage from 1975-1982?  If you dug the LA scene and wanted to know lots more about different bands of that club scene and hear about the early days of the bands that ""made it"", this is for you. All four discs are great. My only complaint is that all could have fit on one blue ray or at most 2 DVDs.  Having to buy 4 separate packages was lame.",1493251200,,577,4.1891891891891895

8696512,5,B00RZXWWGU,This is a great documentary of a great era. I loved all of the interviews and i watch a lot of documentaries on this era and it was nice to see interviews that i had not seen before.
