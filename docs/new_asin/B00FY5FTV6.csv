6038838,5,B00FY5FTV6,Excellent as always.  One needs a multi-region or region free DVD player but these are not expensive and worth having for this series alone.,1428192000,,140,4.833333333333333

8619364,3,B00FY5FTV6,"I must admit to being surprised by so many 5 star ratings.  I simply did not find the show to be that interesting.

This is a really specialized series and I could understand some people watching this and enjoying it.  Essentially, it is a mix of a reality show and a historical documentary.  Some Brits try to live like people lived on Tudor Monastery farms from many centuries ago.  They raise the same foods, try to steep themselves in ancient Catholicism, use the same tools and resources.  They essentially try to live that life on camera.

It has taken me 2 weeks to get through 3 episodes.  I have fallen asleep or decided for days on end, I am not interested in picking back up.  It is just not keeping my interest.

I am not saying it is a terrible show; but it may or may not be right for you.  The episodes are on youtube, so my recommendation is to try half of an episode and see what you think.  Just don't make the mistake that I did and buy this because everyone gave it a high rating.  I don't even know that I will finish the entire series.

Also, another thing missing here are the 1 star ratings for this being a DVD from a different region.  Make sure you have a region free DVD player before buying this dvd.",1487980800,,1229,4.237068965517241
8619365,5,B00FY5FTV6,"I watched the set all at once and I am going to do so again and again.  They go into the economy of the monastery farms and villages.  The things that needed to be done, and how they did it, from clearing and plowing a field to the harvest and everything in between.  Anyone that is interested in Tudor life will love this video set!",1473120000,,333,4.092307692307692
8619366,5,B00FY5FTV6,Enjoyed the series very much.  Worth getting.  The only problem I encountered with the company I ordered from was they didn't know you needed a pal dvd player for all regions.,1459382400,,175,4.612903225806452
8619367,5,B00FY5FTV6,"I enjoy living history, so this series is a treat. The focus is on life early in the Tudor period, around 1500.

I live in the US, so our DVD player doesn't play these disks. However, I am able to watch them on my computer using Media Player.

If you are interested in this period of history, I believe you will thoroughly enjoy this series. They have done a fine job on it.",1459209600,2,374,4.109589041095891

Lord let us remember just how much effort goes into putting food on the table. Peter Ginns mealtime prayer may not have been in the idiom of the time, but in spirit it captured exactly the essence of Tudor Monastery Farm.

Ever since Tales from the Green Valley, when Ginn and his historian colleague Ruth Goodman recreated living conditions on a Stuart-era farm in England, they have been bringing history brilliantly to life on BBC Two. How machines revolutionized the traditional ways of farmers was the focus of their follow-ups on Victorian, Edwardian and wartime England.

But here they ventured a full five centuries back to an almost recognizably primitive pre-industrial era, where the only machine in the village was a tread-wheel for drawing water from the well.

This was a world in which almost everything  from houses to tableware  was hand-made from wood, windows had no glass, and what light glowed after dark was cast by rush stalks soaked in boiled pig fat. Food was not bought but reared or grown, fields were ploughed by obstreperous oxen, and peas were a staple food alongside bread and beer because potatoes hadnt yet been discovered on the far side of the Atlantic. Every resource was natural, and all the more precious because so hard-won.

But the point made most forcefully was that it wasn't just farming that was different 500 years ago. Pre-Reformation England emerged as a fundamentally different society, with Catholicism and its rites infusing every element of daily life. As tenant farmers Goodman, Ginn and a newcomer to the series, archaeologist Tom Pinfold, worked land owned by the local Benedictine monastery, and paid their rent in wool.
As ever Goodman was brilliant at picking out the fine domestic detail and the menfolk demonstrated just how much grunt and resourcefulness was needed to make the land yield its bounty. Overall it wasn't the recreation of hardship and toil that impressed as much as the remarkable sense of social evolution.

Ruth Goodman is as giggly as a schoolgirl, and who can blame her? Shes seen her fascination with the Tudor times take her from being laughed at for her obscure hobby of historical re-enactment into an unlikely TV star.

And now  after experiencing farm life from the Edwardian, Victorian and Second World War periods for her hit BBC2 series  she finally gets a chance to experience life in her favorite era.

Ruth has been badgering producers of the popular farm series to do a Tudor version since it started four years ago. That they finally listened is a dream come true, she laughs.

Arent I a lucky girl? Clearly shes loved making Tudor Monastery Farm. But even shes amazed at how much; she says it was not only one of the best times of her life, but an experience thats changed her forever.",1456358400,5,3109,4.897142857142857
8619369,5,B00FY5FTV6,"Ordered this after watching Edwardian Farm on Amazon Prime. Really nicely filmed, entertaining, and informative. A real pleasure to watch whether you would normally have an interest in history or not. Truly engaging. Will be exploring more of the programs these three (or two of the three) have done.",1453075200,2,300,5.142857142857143

8619371,5,B00FY5FTV6,"This series will give a practical, informative and entertaining insight on what it was like to live as average people did in England in the late middle ages.  I was inspired to be more self reliant in what i saw in the world around me, especially in my view of ""weeds"".  (Have to watch the show to see what I mean) What a wonderful series!",1432252800,3,339,4.2
