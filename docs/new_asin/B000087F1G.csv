1828967,4,B000087F1G,"In several ways this is a tolerably sad movie.  It is tolerable because you keep hoping things will change for JohnJohn.  I suppose it does for him when he shot his father, then leaves when his mother runs off to San Francisco.  His father was very cruel to him, and to his mother, so they had good reason to leave.  But, when the movie switches to present day, JohnJohn treats his son the way he was treated as a boy.  Even worse, one of the women who knew JohnJohn as a little boy tells his son to cut him some slack because of the way his father had been treated.  So, being abused as a child gives one the right to abuse his or her child?  I don't think so.

I am giving this movie a 'B' rating because it is a compelling movie, and one does feel for little JohnJohn.  His love-hate relationship with Zeola is interesting, as are all the very colorful characters.  And, you keep hoping his father will change.  I would suggest that parents who see this movie make it very clear to their children that JohnJohn's father's treatment of him is unacceptable, even if it is done in a clumsy manner in an effort to raise the child right.  If they know a school mate like JohnJohn, it can help them be more understanding of the friend.

Another objection I have to the movie is that JohnJohn's father is made out to be a Christian.  My father was a slumlord, and I guarantee you that there were far more abused children in one of his apartment buildings than in any genuinely Christian church.  Another minor objection I have is that so many of the characters talk in a gruff, almost angry manner.  If you find this movie, it would be worth watching, but, unless you are looking for depictions of child abuse, not worth too much effort to seek it out.",1227139200,6,1748,4.315950920245399
1828968,4,B000087F1G,"Do they still make movies without that ""once scene"" you have to fast forward through?  Do they make movies where you see both the good and bad side in everyone, not just one dimensional?  Yes, they do.  My wife and I rented ""John John"" knowing nothing about it and were very pleasantly surprised.  The little boy acts and talks like a little boy would under the situation.  The black/white relationships are well done, being set in the South in 1968.  The retarded woman's party was very touching.  It left my wife and I talking for quite awhile about the characters, why they behaved the way they did.  If you are looking for an action film, keep looking.  But if you want to see a movie that looks at issues in human relationship, gives this one a look.",1063584000,2,755,4.452554744525547

1828970,1,B000087F1G,"Where should I begin?  Poor direction, an unintelligble script, and inconsistent acting doom this movie.  The film has an amateurish feel and huge gaps in the narrative.  Stay away from this one.",1050883200,2,195,5.03125

7979808,2,B000087F1G,THAT THE RANDY TRAVIS CHARACTER SUDDENLY BECOMES SYMPATHETIC AFTER BEING SHOT IS HIGHLY UNLIKELY SINCE HE WAS NEVER SHOWN AS BEING ANYTHING BUT THAT BEFORE HAND ISNT THE WAY THINGS HAPPEN IN REALITY.TRUST ME PEOPLE IVE KNOWN MEN LIKE THAT AND THEY DONT MAGICALLY BECOME GOOD GUYS AFTER A MISFORTUNE OR BEING PUT DOWN.AND THERES MISSING PARTS TO THE STORY THAT THE AUDIENCE IS EXPECTED TO FILL IN THEMSELVES OR NEVER ASK TO BEGIN WITH.SUCH AS WHY DOES JOHN AS A MAN NEVER QUESTIONS THE OUTCOME OF HIS FATHERS SHOOTING.HE OBVIOUSLY LOVED HIM OR HE WOULDNT HAVE LOOKED HIM UP AS AN ADULT.ARE WE THE AUDIENCE TO ASSUME JOHNS MOTHER IS RESPONSIBLE TO TAKE HER YOUNG SON TO A COMMUNE OF STRANGERS AND ALL THEREAFTER WAS IDEAL?MOST OF THE ACTING IN THIS FILM IS MEDOCRE UNLESS THE PERFORMERS ARE PORTRAYING SLIGHT VARIATIONS OF THEIR OWN PERSONALITY.RANDY TRAVIS IS BEST SINGING OR WHEN HES ATTEMPTING COMEDY.THIS DEFINITELY WAS NOT HIS HIGH POINT.,1397088000,,941,4.850931677018633

7979811,5,B000087F1G,"John John in the Sky is a very touching movie and it helps us realize the seriousness of abuse and the many effects it has on our lives as we grow into adulthood.  The movie touches on many point of abuse such as verbal, emotional, financial and physical.  I totally recommend this movie very enlightening.",1347148800,,306,4.545454545454546
7979812,5,B000087F1G,"I saw much more depth in this movie than others have expressed. I thought Rusty's performance as Zeola was wonderful, and Randy Travis did well in portaying the domineering father. I've let many others borrow this film, and they thought it was just as emotionally moving as I did. Although my personal opinion, this movie is well worth watching.",1335657600,,345,4.864406779661017
7979813,1,B000087F1G,"Not going to same much. Hated that Randy Travis played such a bad guy since I love him and his music.  Not a positive video or chear you up movie. Bad language, violence and the hopelessness of poverty and the cycle of violent parents producing violent children. This movie was a real downer.",1264118400,,292,4.509433962264151
