917464,5,6304547188,"This is a massive and extremely well integrated series of documentaries that exhaustively depicts, explains, and examines the nature of the Soviet society at the time of the great patriotic struggle (as they called it)  against the Nazi forces that invaded Russia during World War Two. It finds  its beginnings in the post-revolutionary struggles of the Russian civil  war, and the Russian resolve to be better prepared for the next inevitable  invasion from the west which communist doctrine taught them to always  expect. As a consequence the Russians painstakingly and consistently  rebuilt their forces and manufactured arms and armaments to prepare for  that terrible prospect. Of course, they also sabotaged their own interests  along the way, in a story that one has to know the Russian mindset well to  fully appreciate.
Yet the series does much more than give us a skeletal  overview of the nature of Russian preparedness and the eventual invasion by  the Wehrmacht in operation Barbarossa in June of 1941; it puts all of it in  an excellent historical context by showing the nature of Soviet internal  repression under the brutal and brazenly paranoid policies of Joseph  Stalin, who systematically purged anyone of consequence from the upper  echelons of the military during the years just preceding the onset of the  Second World War.
Of course, much of the film used in this depiction  was produced for use as either German or Russian propaganda, but this  unfortunate limitation of the documentary material is scrupulously balanced  and buttressed by both the narrative as well as other materials provided in  the series. There is a companion text written by noted historian Richard  Overy (see my review) which threads through the same material and provides  a lot of interesting information that aids one in maximizing the benefit of  the film series itself. I plan to use this informally for a high school  class in European history as a way of engaging lethargic teens into some  interest in modern history. This series isn't intended as an instant  graduate course in Operation Barbarossa, but can be quite informative if  used in conjunction with the text and some other materials (such as the  recent excellent book on the subject, ""When Titans Clashed"").  Enjoy!",964915200,58,2284,5.1138211382113825
917465,5,6304547188,"The is an ambitious and brilliant documentary, focusing primarily on the blood lust and psychosis of Sovet Dictator, Joseph Stalin. Multiple interviews with Societ citizenry and historians prove conclusively that  Stalin was the greatest mass murderer in history. His purges against the  Russian peasants killed 3 million people alone. The depictions of his vast  Gulag system are sobering and depressing.
The strongest parts of the  documentary focus on the Russian attempts to thwart Nazi invasion. The  heroism of the civilian populations in Stalingrad and Leningrad is  harrowing.
The weakest part of the documentary is the ridiculous and  unnecessary inclusion of Henry Kissinger, who is not noted to be an expert  on Soviet History. Thankfully, you can fast forward through his 5 minute  introductory segments.
This documentary will fascinate anyone with an  interest in Russian history, Stalin or Hitler.",962668800,11,911,5.536231884057971
917466,3,6304547188,"This set of ten half-hour PBS videos is overly ambitious in that it addresses four topics: (1) the political perfidy of Josef Stalin, (2) the various atrocities against his own people orchestrated by Josef Stalin; (3)  the atrocities committed against the Russian people by their German  conquerors; and (4) an analysis of the war on the German eastern front,  i.e., the war between Germany and Russia.
The fourth topic is presented  the least successfully. The presentation of the sequence of battles is  short, disorganized and generally unintelligible. Those interested in  military history and analysis should look elsewhere -- the four-tape series  entitled ""The Russuian Front,"" featuring Professor John Erickson  is infinitely superior.
There is, unfortunately, only so much that one  can say or show about the specifics of mass murder. This series suffers  from two defects in that regard: (1) it relies upon propaganda films  produced by both sides, and (2) the viewer eventually become benumbed by  pictures of innocent civilians hanging from telephone poles or stacked like  cordwood in mass graves. This is not to say that this subject is  unimportant, simply that the mode of presentation does not support the  level of consideration that the subject deserves.
The series is most  successful in its detailing of Stalin's treachery towards his political  comrades, the Russian army and the country's peasants. The man was a mass  murderer, plain and simple. This film, based upon recently released  information, details his treachery and should be of interest to students of  the history of the Soviet political system
And Dr. Henry Kissinger? He  makes a cameo appearance at the beginning of each of the ten segments, says  a few eminently forgettable words, and then disappears. As is so often the  case, PBS wasted his talents.
In summary, this series is like a dinner in  a Chinese restaurant -- you enjoy it at the time, but are hungry again an  hour later.",955843200,48,1974,5.132075471698113
917467,5,6304547188,"The willpower of the Soviet peoples comes to the forefront in this series. The average Ivan and Ivana won the largest and most terrible war in history in spite of Stalin's paranoid purges. These videos prove that an unbroken  human spirit can overcome all tyranny, even that on the homefront.",950832000,4,292,4.84
917468,5,6304547188,"I have always loved to read books and watch videos about World War II and this was an excellent series. First of all, it showed many new video clips that I had never seen before which helps to better illustrate the excelent  narration. The introductions by Henry Kissinger also added greatly to the  whole peice.  I especially remember the segment on Staligrad. It told an  informative story from both sides of the battle which gave it a more human  feel. Additionally, it illustrated just how brutal Stalin was in his push  to free his country from the Nazis. It also raised an interesting question  about whether or not Stalin may have been planning an invasion of Hitler's  domain just before Hitler attacked. I also agree with a fellow reviewer  about its coverage of the Battle of Kursk, very informative. Overall, I  learned a great amount from this documentary and it is well worth its  price.",947548800,8,900,4.741935483870968
917469,5,6304547188,"War on the Eastern front, the bloodiest and the most destructive war in human history, has been downplayed in the west for too long. It is a great insult to the supreme sacrifices of the soviet people who not only had to  contend with the forces of a rapacious external enemy but also with an  equally destructive war that was being waged from within their own state  agianst them. After watching this program, I assure you that the allied  landings in Europe on D-Day will seem nothing more than a slight diversion  from the main theatre of war and also a weak attempt to prevent Russian  tanks from rolling right up to the English channel.",946944000,4,641,4.530434782608696
917470,5,6304547188,"This is an outstanding history of the contributions of blood, sweat, tears and treasure spilled by the Russian people during WWII. It is a pity that the contribution of the Red Army and the people of the Soviet Union were  downplayed in the age of the Cold War. Why weren't we taught about the  battle of Kursk? The Red Army broke the back of the German military-  victory was sealed there- it was only a matter of time. A painful and  enlightening series. D-Day and Kursk the two major military operations  carried out by our American and Russian grandfathers- the grandfathers that  saved the world...",945993600,12,603,4.695238095238095
917471,5,6304547188,"This is an astounding 5-volume set of video that made me wonder why this history is not more well known in the U.S. as it appears the soviets lost up to 40 people for every single American loss in WWII.  Volume 3 has an  hour-long documentary on the total German obliteration of Stalingrad and  the wintry turn of events that led to the destruction of the entire German  army that found itself eventually surrounded within Stalingrad.  This  segment left me wondering why a single battle that appears to have had more  casualties than the total casualty loss among the U.S. and British during  the entire war gets so little attention in American schools.  Also  extraordinarily notable are the sections on the siege and starvation of  millions in Leningrad, the arrest, trial and execution of many (most?)  soviet military officers before the war by Stalin, the mass exterminations  at Babi Yar, the virtual civil war between the nationalist, anti-Stalinist  partisans and soviet partisans in the Ukraine (all the while both groups  were fighting Germans), and the interviews with soviet soldiers whose job  it was to shoot fleeing soviet soldiers at the front.
This film is an  outstanding choice for anyone interested in history.",942278400,119,1231,5.014851485148514
7876522,5,6304547188,"We all know something of the Stalin era but this strips it down to the raw meat and in a way that leaves you waiting for the next episode. It is a documentary, but not dry. Not something I, anyway, had to wade thru. If you like history, you need to view this series.",1394496000,,266,3.9444444444444446
7876523,5,6304547188,"I learned about this VCR tape series from friends who grew up in the Soviet Union.  Fortunately for them, soon after the Hitler-Stalin war began they and their parents were relocated east of the Ural Mountains.  They were primary-school age kids at the time  and avoided the horrors.  But when they returned to their homes in the Ukraine, or what was left of them, they began to understand just how awful it had been.

This series of videos brings all of this back to one's recall, depending on one's age and experience.  It is not pretty, some of the scenes - actual footage taken at the time by some very brave cameramen - are macabre:  mass killings, open-pit burials, etc., as Hitler tried to solve his ""Jewish problem"" on Russian (Soviet) soil.

Of course, as we all should remember, Stalin was no saint either, and his treachery and brutality, against his own people, is well documented.  The footage covering the battle at Stalingrad is especially vivid, with a number of reminders about the ""key players"" of the time:  Zhukov, Beria, Malenkov, some footage of Lenin's last days and, of course, many scenes of Stalin himself.

There are many recorded interviews with survivors of the war, both Russian and German, with admirable translations into English, and these add to the sense of ""being there"" that the viewer cannot avoid.

For anyone who wants a ""refresher"" about one of mankind's darkest days, this production is a must-see.",1340150400,,1440,4.83265306122449
7876524,5,6304547188,"This series of videos truly brought out the brutality that was Russia during the terror reign of Stalin. It shows rare footage of Russia during the wars and the war for independence. It is brutal in its illustration of a bygone Russian era,but it is true to its plot to show how a nation can embark on a disastrous history. It was a good series to watch for a history buff like myself.",1327968000,,385,4.287671232876712
7876525,5,6304547188,"This is on par with the World at War documentary, with the emphasis on the rise of Joseph Stalin and the war he waged on his own people and the Nazi Empire.  Extremely well done and a must for historians focusing on this genre.  It would be nice if PBS would digitize it so that it would be more readily available.",1251158400,2,314,4.131147540983607
7876526,5,6304547188,"There are a lot of World War II documentaries out there, but I found this one to be compelling and perhaps authoritative. Terrific images, a clear editorial perspective and excellent editing. Really excellent editing.",1213315200,2,217,5.411764705882353
7876527,5,6304547188,"Yes, yes, yes, we know.  The series doesn't cover all the details of Russia's involvement in World War II (or the years leading up to it). And, yes, it does reflect the perspective of the people who put the project together.  And, yes, yes, there are other ways to interpret the material.  Good grief! Do we really need a lecture on the fact that documentary films are made by people who do, in fact, filter material through their own experiential and cultural viewpoints?  Documentaries are not absolute truth; they are interpretive communication.

The point is that this series displays photographs and film footage which have never been available in any format prior to their sifting and presentation in this production.

Surely the people who are carping at the series because they feel that the filmmakers have not presented the entirety of the story can understand the realities of trying to organize literally hundreds (if not thousands) of hours of randomly accumulated footage discovered in heretofore sealed archives in Germany and Russia into a manageable package.

So some of the narration is a little clichd.  So all the details of every event and all aspects of every personality are not fully developed.  If you want additional perspective, watch other documentaries.  Read some books. But view these programs for what they do offer--an amazing collection of images that expand our understanding of the terrors of both the prewar and wartime events. Bravo to the filmmakers. I guarantee that at least some of these images are going to make your eyes grow wide.

This is an excellent series that fills in some very large blank spots about the Russian side of World War II.  No doubt other documentaries will be produced in the future that make use of the same archival material and reach different conclusions, but this was a commendable and ground-breaking effort that should be purchased for every school and community video collection. My only regret is that it is not currently available on dvd. C'mon, PBS; respond to the advancement in technology and publish this series on dvd so that it is more user friendly and can be adapted to wider applications",1205452800,9,2171,4.966850828729282
7876528,4,6304547188,"This very fine PBS broadcast details Stalin's War against the Russian People and the German War against the Soviet Union.  It seeks to detail these two wars and how it combined cost the Soviet Union 45 million people.  Why does it matter?  Because in today's world, the Germans are scorned for what they did to the world, but very little is said about what Stalin did to the peoples of the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe.  That is why it matters and why this film series shows Stalin and his henchman for what they really were.  This film is not for the weak of heart, as it shows some very disturbing scenes and talks about some very revolting subjects.  I watched in amazement as people gloated over a person being hanged.

This is a true horror film starring Stalin and Hitler.  It shows mans inhumanity to man.  This is very much worth watching.",1108944000,22,850,4.503267973856209
7876529,5,6304547188,I learned so much from this series! You will want to keep it forever so you can watch it periodically. There is so much info here you will have to watch it more than once to catch it all. The creators of this series really tell it like it was.,1105747200,4,243,3.88
7876530,2,6304547188,"I have a standard by which I judge documentaries: if they present what happened as we know it with as little bias as possible while keeping it interesting, I admire them. If they use adjectives like 'evil' or 'barbaric' to describe ANYTHING, I start getting annoyed with them; the actions should speak for themselves. I'm quite sure most people can draw the conclusion that Hitler and Stalin were evil, nasty people without having to have those adjectives repeatedly shoved in their faces.
Alas, this documentary falls very clearly into the latter category. They describe the Hitler Youth as ""innocence devoured by evil"", the thousand year Reich as ""Hitler's dark vision"", and so on. They use corny phrases like that from the first tape to the last.
Outside of that, the actual coverage of Russia's War is actually minimal. These tapes seem more focused on the atrocities commited by both sides, with the focus on the War itself being somewhat more sporadic. If you like that sort of thing, this might be your series. Otherwise, look for the more enjoyable series ""War of the Century"", and give this one a pass.",1021075200,25,1111,4.852631578947369
7876531,4,6304547188,"""Russia's war - Blood upon the snow"" portrays a present
day Russian view of WWII, and a very impressive one.
This massive, 10-hour-long series contains much information
and many images largely unknown for war series fans in the
West.
On the whole, the series is fairly loyal to the established
Russian view of the relevant period, however, the need to
present an acceptable product to Western markets tends to
soften its impact.
I strongly believe that Russian citizens, especially those who fought the war - despite the fact that they know full well the bloody history of Stalin's crimes -, would not go along with the films' view that Stalin's unethical diplomatic manouvering was any worse than that of the Western powers. But that's exactly what the makers of the film believe the West wants to hear.
The film's insistance on the Katyn forest' massacre
looks very much as another wink to the Western viewer.
Horrible as it was, the killing of 20 thousand officers
of the Polish army is unlikely to inflame those who suffered over twenty million casualties, including over 40 thousand Russian officers killed by Stalin's orders before Operation Barbarossa.
The introductions by Dr. Kissinger appear as an additional way of dressing the Russian bear in something
like an ill-fitting tuxedo.
I believe that the strengths of ""Russia's war"" must be
looked for -and easily found - underneath such dressings,
so much loved by post-1989 Russian intellectuals.
All the savagery and all the heroism of the ""great
patriotic war"", as Russians call it, is laid bare
in front of us. Many of us may learn a thing or two
about Russia, about the Soviet period, about WWII and about the 20th century by watching the ten thrilling and gruesome hours.",1001289600,8,1735,4.924914675767918
