Judging by the cover it looks sick about a psychotic clown with a vengeance for blood! well i opened it already and discovered 2 disc, one sloppy the psychotic and then other 21st century serial killer. I didn't see them yet but i will get a chance to watch it eventually.",1491350400,,347,4.1940298507462686

He's a real natural when it comes to acting and no matter
what the role!",1479600000,,131,3.8518518518518516
7987412,5,B00005QIVG,"When i saw the cheap price ($10.00) of this movie i thought it was going to be a bad bad movie but i was very surprised to find that this is one of the best films i have seen and i have seen many. the acting was top notch, if you want a good drama/action movie about asian mafia, romance and friendship then this movie is for you.",1161302400,,330,3.8676470588235294
7987413,4,B00005QIVG,"Killer is an okay HK film with a familiar storyline.  Jordan Chan is a well respected hitman who wants to go into legit businesses with his crooked homies.  However, he's trapped in the game and his world is starting to fall apart.  The performances are good and I really cared about the main characters.  Sexy Yoyo Mung is always a treat for my eyes and I was really surprised and thrilled to see Shaw Brothers veteran, Lo Meng as a rival mob boss.  I just wish there was a little more action.  Director Billy Chung should have asked Johnnie To for a few pointers.  With more action scenes and a better ending, this really could have been a Killer.",1136937600,,649,4.4033613445378155
