3557100,5,B001EQPD0Q,"I am so glad to finally see a movie that has a happy ending or the kind of movie that ends with ""and they lived happily every after."" A lot of gay movies have tragic endings. It's as if gay couples can't have happy lives together. I was gettng fed up with those type of movies. If you love love stories with a happy ending this is the movie for you!",1230422400,6,349,3.9295774647887325
3557101,4,B001EQPD0Q,"This movie proves once and for all that not every gay love story on film depends on sex scenes to keep the audience interested... this one certainly does not.  It's the love between the two lead characters that comes first and foremost.  Like some other viewers here, however, I found this film, at times, to be a series of some contradictions... a couple scenes are indeed a bit long in the tooth in regard to dialog and a couple supporting characters weren't really needed for the most part ...or their scenes, at the very least, did not need to be quite as long.  However, there is one scene and one performance in particular that for whatever reason rang absolutely true in my heart and head and left me in tears.  When the adult actor Eric Dean (Jake) tells his childhood friend, Kyle (James McCabe), that he still loves him, and that he has always loved him, I have rarely seen a performance that hit home with that kind of heartfelt veracity. Please do not miss this film for that one scene alone!!",1228867200,39,1005,4.5054945054945055
3557102,5,B001EQPD0Q,"This is a blatant feel-good movie. At the end of the third-last scene I skipped the Kleenex tissues and advanced immediately to the kitchen paper towels.

3557103,1,B001EQPD0Q,"The captions aren't readable as you fast-forward through this cringe-inducing mess, and believe me you will want to fast-forward or just hit Eject.

There's a commentary track that I decided to skip entirely. I imagine that the director explains that the tall actor with the pretty eyes is straight, which would explain the total lack of chemistry and the unsexy little smooches that he exchanges with the other lead.

Thanks to Netflix, I only wasted a queue rental and 45 minutes of my time.",1228348800,3,493,4.857142857142857
3557104,4,B001EQPD0Q,"First off, I loved this story.  Great idea, some very good writing, and two actors who are clearly both skilled in their craft and who worked hard to execute the story's goals.  It also shines in the slow, methodical way it develops, and the time the writer/director is willing to take to let ideas and interactions develop.  Moving and heart-felt.

That being said, the film needed a little more editing, and perhaps a couple of scenes needed more time to gel/come together.  Sometimes the actors are spot-on, and sometimes the scenes feel rough-hewn - like they needed more time to hit the right tone/cadence.

Definitely a B+, and a keeper.  Looking forward to the next work by this writer/director.  And off to look for other work by both actors.",1227830400,18,750,4.75968992248062

The scenes between the two main characters looked like they were constipated, so poor, we laughed. Obviously a low budget film, small things were so blatantly missing..when the cousin punches the main character after finding out he is gay... no sound. Little things like that.

3557107,4,B001EQPD0Q,"I really enjoyed this film - I thought it was very moving, and quite lovely - made even more so by the actors being ordinary-looking guys, who find each other, and, at first, are just as awkward as they were as adolescents.  But love conquers all - and it does in the end.  I would highly recommend it for viewing by all gay men.  I do not mean to exclude others, just that gay men would more readily relate to it.",1227225600,6,414,4.08641975308642
3557108,4,B001EQPD0Q,"Two teenagers, Jake and Kyle, camping out under the rural ""Arizona Sky"" (2008), realize what they feel for each other is much more than ""best buddies.""  But Jake's father is forcing him to move away the next day, and Kyle is afraid of others finding out about their relationship, so they never get the chance to express their love physically.

Fast forward fifteen years, and Jake is a successful filmmaker in Hollywood, a job that has more than its share of 24/7 pressure.  The job's demanding nature actually made it easier for him to excuse the fact that he had no social life, and is, indeed, still aching over the unrequitted love for Kyle.  At the urging of his straight best friend and roommate, they take a week off and go back to visit Jake's home town, and he looks up Kyle, who still lives in that town.  Does Kyle still feel the same way, and is there any chance they can pick up where they left off so many years ago?

Director Jeff London is known for these overdone syrup-sweet gay romances, and this is better than most, including some great casting.  The young actors who play the leads as teens have a real chemistry, and actually resemble Eric Dean (Jake) and Jayme McCabe (Kyle) who play them as adults.  The supporting cast is also excellent, but all suffer a bit from the heavy-handed direction.  The sound is a bit strange, as the microphones seem to be switched on to capture a line, then turned off immediately, so background noise comes and goes with it.  DVD has director/actor commentary and chapter stops only.  Overall, it is a pleasant film, and I'd give it four stars out of five.",1226707200,17,1612,4.5432525951557095

3557110,2,B001EQPD0Q,"""Arizona Sky"" is an attractive title.  Unfortunately, it seems to have little to do with this amateurish /independent film.
The  film consists mainly of  two men, at different times, talking  to each other. One has been or is /is in love withe the
other, who seems increasingly , unattractive in each conversation ,, with a scruffy beard marring what might possibly have been m  average looking young man. But his scruffy beard eventually becomes e a bit revolting, thus inclining  the viewer to fast  forward through  the seemingly t
interminable conversations.

3557115,4,B001EQPD0Q,The story line of this movie is really convincing. The acting is inconsistent from scene to scene. This may be the director's fault because the same actors will be unconvincing in one scene and then deliver a stunning performance later on.  It is very much worth watching.  You will need to watch it for the content and story line. There are scenes that are poignant and emotionally stirring.,1385942400,,392,4.75
3557116,3,B001EQPD0Q,"I was really in the mood for a heartwarming romance when I popped this DVD in, and I so wanted to love this movie, but instead came away only 'not totally hating it'.  Though handsome, the lead 'adult' actors weren't great - as many other reviewers have said, they either over-acted or under-acted and never seemed genuine.  Rather, both seemed to be forcing their performances without really understanding what they were actually trying to convey, and they didn't have any chemistry - they may as well have been reading monologues in an empty room as facing each other during most of their scenes.

And the disappointments didn't end there - aside from a painfully poor script, there was nothing organic or natural about the performances of any of the 'adult' actors, except perhaps the actresses who performed the aunt and the destitute neighbor, both of whom appeared to have done the best with what they were given.  And, that confrontation scene with the cousin - ouch!!!  Watching that scene hurt on so many levels.

Conversely, the young teen actors who portrayed the characters as youths were good, they came across as real people.  And their well done entry scene which displayed lots of chemistry between them made the rest of the film that must sadder to see, because the characters you started to care about in that first scene were nowhere to be found in the remainder of the film.  One thing I didn't get was why the writer didn't want them to be able to share a little tenderness for the last time out in the open countryside where no one could see them.  Again, though nicely acted, Kyle's reluctance to share a last embrace with Jake in that scene didn't make any sense.

But, I can't say it was all bad, aside from the overall good entry scene, I actually got teary for a moment when the aunt character encouraged Kyle to embrace his chance with Jake - despite the fact that the scene was very contrived and predictable.

I don't mind low budget films, or novice actors and I can deal with some cliched dialogue, stilted plot turns, and even some weak direction, but, when all those negative attributes coalesce at the same time, in the same film, the result can be painful to watch.  I'd say this film is rentable, but not buyable.  I'm glad my copy was purchased as a discounted used item.",1382313600,2,2309,4.629901960784314
3557117,3,B001EQPD0Q,"Jeff London films tend to have a formula.  Two guys who are attracted to each other overcome drama and tears, always tears, to end up together with a Hallmark moment final scene. This film has two leads, one who can barely act (Eric Dean who is too stiff) and one who barely can't (Jayme McCabe who sounds like a cross between Forrest Gump and Ennis from Brokeback). The actors (Blaise Embry and Kyle Buckland) who portray these characters as teenaged boys do a better job and have better chemistry. However, the film is worth watching for two reasons. One is Patricia Place as the aunt who tells her nephew to come out of the closet and be gay without using either the word closet or gay. The second is Bernadette Murray in the small role of Cora who is perfect. It is a good sentimental romance which is enjoyable if you like that sort of thing.",1369353600,6,847,4.42948717948718

3557121,4,B001EQPD0Q,"""Arizona Sky"" is fine simple film to watch.  A LGBT 2008 Film
by Jeff London, ""Sky"" is about how two young boys (around 15 or
16), close friends, are split up as Jake (Eric Dean) moves away
(presumably to Los Angeles, though the city is never mentioned).
Jake becomes a film producer in ""Hollywood"" while his friend, Kyle
stays behind, and becomes a ""cowboy"".  The story is touching as
Jake returns to his home town to get away from all the pressure, and
re-kindles his friendship with Kyle, now both in their 30s.

The only drawbacks to the film are certain unneeded scenes concerning
people having nothing to do with the film (the poor woman coming for
groceries for example), cold coffee no ones takes a drink from in scene,
and the character of the adult version of Kyle (Jayme MacCabe).
Jeff London should have given the role of  adult Jake to Emerson
Smith (Smith plays Kyle's cousin) simply because he looks more like the
adult version of Kyle (Kyle Buckland plays the younger character of Jake).
Jayme MacCabe is not right for the part of the older Kyle, he is simply
too old, and does not fit the mold of Kyle Buckland (his 15-year-old
character).

We would like to point out that our favorite character of the film,
Jake's present Roommate ""Steve"" (Brent King) is absolutely adoring in his role.
Steve is so friendly and supporting to his gay  roommate, that, well,
its not so easy to find a straight man being so gay-friendly and show
this type of rare support in a relationship. The beautiful instrumental at the
end of the film has become a staple of the Walters Judson Group's Song Masters
We liked the film.",1354060800,,1622,4.595155709342561
3557122,5,B001EQPD0Q,"A friend shared this film with me - not as a must see, but to resell online.  Of course I was curious to see this film that has reviewers split down the middle between the best and the worst film they have ever rated.

What I found was an incredible story line - that probably speaks to many a viewer.  The film is about the friendships we make as teenagers, and how life gets in the way of finding who and what we really love.  This is a story of conflict - country vs. city - happiness vs. being content - family values vs. truth in ourselves. The film never eludes to a specific time or place, referencing only 'the city'. The film opens as we meet Kyle and Jake as teenagers celebrating a friendship, and mourning the pending move of Jake with his family. It gently references sexual energy, tastefully and with only a single kiss, on the lips.  It speaks of a time and a place where anything out of the norm was not accepted.  If you were a young person pre-1990's, you'll understand the angst and pain in young Jake's face as he spends one last night camping with his best buddy.

Jump ahead 15 plus years, and we find Jake living the big life - but not a happy one.  A stress filled job fulfills his financial needs, but his heart is empty. He decides after all these years to return to the small town he left decades ago, to find his friend Kyle, with whom he lost contact.  Upon his return, he finds Kyle living a remarkably different life from Jake.  The two recollect, share their lives, and a story of friendship and love unfolds.

If the film had the production budget of Brokeback Mountain, we could have experienced a stellar story set with a remarkable soundtrack and unlimited props.  The film is low-budget in production, but high on content.  Trust me, I'll take content anytime over budget (just look for my review of War of the Worlds).  The content and quality of the story are moving, emotional and compassionate.  Acting ranges from good to excellent, like in most films.  Editing is limited, and some scenes probably could have been cut.  If you're looking for your typical gay-themed love story complete with sex, skip this film.  If you're looking for a slow moving film about following your heart, see Arizona Sky.

But in the end, you have a touching film and story about being happy in your life - about finding true love, about following your dreams and desires.  Is that how life really is?  Maybe not as often as it should be, but the film can serve as in inspiration to those seeking answers.",1336780800,,2526,4.447826086956522

Ok first off I can deal with low buget and sets that scream it,but when the script yo-yo's sooo flatly ouch! The ""Lost love"" could be reasonably good looking I kept thinking shave & haircut the whole movie. The lead being a ""Big Shot""whatever was too weak to believe he could have such a job. Way too much of this movie was spent on these two not being able to face what they each wanted,just not well done .It could have been a really good story,but not this dvd....Get ""SHELTER"" if you want a well done DVD.",1306972800,,627,4.233333333333333
3557125,4,B001EQPD0Q,"The story opens with 15 year old best friends ""Jake"" (Blaise Embry) and ""Kyle"" (Kyle Buckland) taking a camping trip to the desert in the wake of circumstances which will soon seperate them. The boys have been best friends for 6 years and have spoken of their love for each other but have never acted on those feelings, as Kyle is deeply fearful that someone else may find out. Jake's father has accepted a position out of state and his family will soon be moving away. Kyle's parents are divorced, his abusive father is no longer in the picture, and he is needed at home with his mother to help make ends meet and keep things together. He knows he will likely be forever stuck in small town Arizona and must keep his life on the down-low to protect his reputation. The boys vow to remain in close contact and visit each other as often as possible. Somehow Jake got too wrapped up making new friends and adjusting to the move that the two boys lost touch completely.
Cut to fifteen years later, when Jake as an adult (now played by Eric Dean) is a successful film maker in California and about to break emotionally from the stress of his career. Knowing he needs a break from his daily grind Jake decides to follow his heart back in time and try to reconnect with the best friend he has never stopped loving. He journeys back home to the small town in Arizona in search of Kyle (now played by Jayme McCabe). As the two meet again, even with the help of others and the ambiance in those arizona skies, is there any possibility that Kyle still feels the same about Jake, and can the love they once shared ever truly be rekindled?
I absolutely love the original and refreshing scope of this film. There are however some things I found quite disappointing by the execution of the plot. Embry and Buckland give shining performances as the adolescents, as does Dean as the adult Jake. Dean makes a very believable transition into the character now at age 30. Same height, build, hair, similar facial features, personality, etc. He was quite well cast in the part and pulls it off to a tee. McCabe however as the older Kyle simply doesn't fit the role. He is obviously too old to play the part, has the wrong build and doesn't meet the physical characteristics of a 30 year old man who is supposed to be a cowboy, mechanic and cook in a small town restaurant. His personality and manner of speaking is not the same as the younger ""kyle"" and nowhere in the film does he even wear a cowboy hat unlike his younger protege. I felt this film would have been MUCH better with more believable casting for this role. That being said however, it would be unfair to say he didn't try to fit into the role. He gave it his all and definitely attempted to make his character work. A bit overacted at times, but a good performance nonetheless. Perhaps the biggest flaw in the whole film was the absence of footage in the beginning, to lay sufficient background of the strong relationship between the two young characters. As adolescents we see them maybe 8 minutes before the movie progresses to the present time. It simply wasn't enough to set the premise for the love that is trying to be revived 15 years later. Those young tender years needed to be explored much more and allow the viewer to witness the strong bond as it developed. There were several characters which should have been completely edited out altogether as they weren't needed. Kyle's cousin for instance, a poorly acted part which added zero to the content of the plot. Kyle's needy neighbor appeared in a long boring scene that wasn't necessary, as were the scenes with Jake's adult best friend Steve. Patricia Place who played as Kyle's aunt gave a great performance, but her character was given way too much time in the film, and took away from needed time to display the relationship of the two lead characters. Such things as this took away from the film and kept it from coming anywhere near it's potential.
In spite of it's many flaws however, the film still works somehow as if the plot were so strong that it insisted on finding a way to be expressed. I am not at all regretful for making this purchase, I absolutely like this film very very much. It is a story that most of us can relate to. Long after viewing the film, my mind reflects on the emotion and strong impression the story made on me. It is a low budget film, so don't try to compare it to some extremely well made movie with great resources spent to ensure a flawless execution of the plot. Judge it simply for what it is and you should enjoy it's refreshing appeal. You will find pieces of it's content that will disappoint, but allow yourself to overlook the flaws and let the true concept of the film work it's magic on you. It will, if you were ever an adolescent exploring love that you simply couldn't quite have the way your heart desired. Innocence sometimes leaves painful scars which we carry for a lifetime. If you've been there, you should be able to relate and enjoy the concept of this film.",1306454400,6,5027,4.48309705561614

3557127,3,B001EQPD0Q,"I bought this movie because of the two handsome guys on the cover and the setting was out in the country. Eric Dean's character Jake was irratating to me, like someone who drums their fingers on a desk just to do it. You could tell he liked Kyle, but kept pussyfooting around that part of it and instead, found every feeling or word reasoning not to start the loving relationship with Kyle up again and leaving Kyle on tenderhooks with Kyle's more honest and true feelings for Jake. Jayme McCabe played Kyle with utter conviction and he was very believable with what he had to work with (the bad writing). The theme here is tenderness between two men and Jake's pussyfooting and the other characters in this movie (besides Jake and Kyle) just seemed to be not needed. In this 90 minute movie, I think there are 2 minutes of actual kissing and tenderness shown between Jake and Kyle. I don't need the raw sex (and there wasn't any) but there were plenty of places where holding hands together should have been taking place, instead of needless dialogue. Kyle's person is so genuine and caring that you instantly like him. Jake's hemming and hawing around Kyle just makes you want to punch him. C'mon Jake, stand up for you man! Kyle has no problems decaring his love in his soft spoken way. Too much footage was spent on the other characters in this movie, which made me antzy to get beck to Kyle and Jake. Much of the dialogue wasn't needed; hand holding would have said a lot more and stuck with the tenderness theme and been more enjoyable to watch between the 2 men. You can talk all day long or hold hands all day long. Given 24 hours and 1 man, skip the talk and let's get right to the hand holding through the day!

3557129,4,B001EQPD0Q,I really enjoyed this movie.  It doesn't seem to have the usual stereotypes.  Just honest emotions from the principal players.  One doesn't have to be gay to appreciate the feelings the two lead characters so obviously have for each other.  Sweet and touching and I would highly recommend it to anyone who's grown a little tired of the trite gay coming out movies so abundantly available these days.  Sure it's obviously made on a budget but the simple story more than makes up for it.,1251158400,3,485,4.658823529411765
3557130,3,B001EQPD0Q,"Writer/producer/director Jeffery London is back with another of his simple gay love stories put to film.  And, although the results aren't brilliant in any way, he definitely deserves a ""most improved"" award.

London's 2001 ""...And Then Came Summer"" ranks in my book as one of the worst gay-themed films ever made.  Parts of it are, literally, unbearable to watch.  Thankfully, he's learned a lot in the seven years between that film and ""Arizona Sky"".  Also, thankfully, he hasn't lost any bit of that big heart that he wants to bring to the big screen.

Technically, this film has a long way to go.  There are a lot of clunky moments in regards to editing, and the soundtrack is scratchy and amateurish.  Likewise, some of the writing and acting choices left me scratching my head... it's hinted that the character of Kyle is originally from Oklahoma, but his southern drawl is far too prominent, especially for someone who relocated to Arizona as a child.  The references to ""Brokeback Mountain"" simply shouldn't be there, and the confrontational scene with Kyle and his cousin, Heath (Heath???) features the single worst on-screen punch in cinema history.  No lie, it made me laugh out loud.

That said - and like so many others here - I couldn't help but like this little film.  There's a sincerity here that's very engaging, a desire to tell us a simple story without a lot of distractions.  And I'll admit that I found myself rooting for the two main characters... that Jake would come to grips with his desire to leave the big city for a simpler life, and that Kyle would come to grips with his long-hidden sexuality.

The film works best at its simplest moments.  No, it isn't much of a story, but it is a little nugget that's conveyed with tenderness and a sense of honesty.

So, no, ""Arizona Sky"" isn't going to win any awards.  But if gay romance is your kind of thing, you'll probably enjoy it.",1247529600,3,1907,4.678678678678678

In part, it was the simplicity and down-to-earth nature of the story. In part, it was the fact that it's about gay men who AREN'T shallow teenage or twenty-somethings. In part, it's that it deals with a topic you almost never see in films: gay people who live in small, rural towns (yes, they really do exist!).
Unlike the other movie I've seen by this writer/director, The Last Year (which was a soap opera without a single authentic moment), this is a sweet and simple little story.
Yes, you will cringe at the bad acting, especially when the character actress who plays Kyle's aunt shows up halfway through and puts all the others to shame by demonstrating how a real actor delivers a performance. And yes, some of the story elements and dialogue are clunky and heavy-handed. But for me, it was nice to see a movie about gay men that isn't set in LA or New York, isn't about sex, drugs, fashion and club life, and deals pretty realistically with some of the issue that gay people in rural settings face. It's kind of an amateur, zero-budget, less epic Brokeback Mountain, but with a happy ending.",1244419200,4,1264,4.647321428571429
3557134,4,B001EQPD0Q,"Arizona Sky is not the most polished movie that you will see, but it has a good story line and a good lesson. Jeff London's movies usually are not the big budget Hollywood ones that come out, but don't let that stop you from seeing them.

Things that I might have wanted if I could have changed them was a bit more interaction between the friends when they were younger and a bit more development of that part of the movie. I enjoyed the part with Kyle's aunt and it helped show the type of family life that there was for him. London does bog down the movie with a little more dialogue and time in some parts that I didn't feel advanced the movie too much, but that is a minor issue.",1240185600,2,683,4.135338345864661
3557135,4,B001EQPD0Q,"This little tale of lost love found is low budget & the acting is below par, but the story ultimately moved me. The story also makes  references to ""Brokeback Mountain"" in a cheesy way. Two teenage boys had a tentative love for each other, but the one moved away from the small town, while the other stayed. When one returns and re-discovers his roots and ultimately his continued desire for the other fella, their subsequent reunion will bring a tear to your eye. Forget the production values, the hokiness of some parts; just enjoy the tenderness displayed between the protagonists.",1239926400,3,584,4.84
3557136,5,B001EQPD0Q,"Low budget, yes.  But that doesn't mean the movie has to be bad.  And this one isn't.  In fact, it's great!!

What makes it great???  THe acting for one.  It is so sincere by the principles.

Any movie that makes me cry because it has touched me is saying something!!

Any movie that keeps the profanity to the minimum (because profanity is a big turn-off for me) is worth watching.

Any movie that keeps the sex to the minimum and leaves it to the imagination (which is certainly a big turn on for me) is worth watching!

Any movie that tugs at the heartstrings with the true depth of feelings featuring non-stereotypical gays who do NOT jump in the sack with everyone they meet is worth watching!!

This movie is worth watching!!  I loved it!!",1239926400,7,745,4.437037037037037
3557137,1,B001EQPD0Q,"Inept on every level (writing, acting, directing, sound, etc.).  Do yourself a favor and buy ""Big Eden"" or ""Latter Days"" if you want a good, gay love story.  Or, do what I do, and host a ""Turkey Movie"" every so often where it's not only permissable to hiss and boo and add color commentary, but it's encouraged!  This film will bring out the best (or is that worst?) in your captive audience.  Really...it's just bad.",1232841600,,417,4.52
3557138,2,B001EQPD0Q,"For some reason, I had it in my mind that this was supposed to be good.  It wasn't.  The real entertainment for us was making fun of it as it went along, adding in our own running commentary in the MST 3000 style.

I believe the film maker had noble intent to tell a story of two men reconnecting.  But the acting, aside from Jake (Eric Dean) was comically bad.  I mean BAD.  I found it painful to watch many of the scenes, in that they were directed as if to radio dialogues.  The characters remained frozen in place, delivering predictable lines.  The emotional overplay on the part of ""Kyle"" was laughable.  Lastly, the inclusion of Jake's Friend ""Brian"" should have been left back at home.  I never did figure out why he was part of the visit back to Jake's hometown.

This film takes the lead in our running BGFF (Bad Gay Film Festival).  That said, it may be fun for party viewing, as it is unintentionally funny.",1232841600,2,919,4.372781065088757

We catch up with him when he finds his life to be lacking meaning after college. He has been working establishing himself as a filmmaker, but life has lost the edge it should have. He returns to Arizona to see what he missed out on, only to find his best friend has had the same kind of disappointments, but in a drearier way. He finds out some wonderful aspects of his friend's personality & decides that he can create films ANYWHERE- not just in California!

The problems came with deplorable execution.  BAD script!  Can only  partially blame the actors for a lack of motivation.  I could have written and directed better than this (and I am in no way qualified).  Is affection such a foreign concept to the actors that they could not display some? Zero chemistry.  The characters had longed for each other for more than a decade and that's all the pent up  emotion they  had?  Sheesh. The tragedy  is that it could have been done so much better.  For  anyone interested in  a good version of this theme, watch Esteros.  Really good. Organic plot and dialogue with genuine emotion and believable characters.",1489536000,,820,4.784172661870503
