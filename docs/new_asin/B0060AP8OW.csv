8490233,5,B0060AP8OW,This is the tragic story of Mata Hari.  This is the French version and to me seems closer to the original story than the American version.  However the American version is good as well and I recommend them both.,1487462400,,211,4.384615384615385

8490236,3,B0060AP8OW,"The true story of the Dutch spy Margaretha Geertruida Zelle has yet to be told. It is much more fascinating than any of its film incarnations including this French one from 1964. Though it receives a much less slick treatment than the Garbo MGM version, and is head & shoulders above the execrable 1985 Sylvia Kristel one, it still relies on a made-up romance to make its heroine more palatable to a general audience. (The real woman had a lousy love life, and was a spy strictly for the bucks). Its stronger points, however, are that it presents more aspects of the politics of the day and the consequent loss of lives on the battlefields due to Mata Hari's work spying for the Germans. It is a suspenseful tale, as told in a script written by Franois Truffaut, with a couple of heart-stopping set pieces along the way. Moreau, always a fascinating screen presence, carries the film effortlessly. The period is re-created in stunning detail - obviously there was quite a generous budget here.

The b&w print offered here is as I remember it: kind of dim and a tad inky. This is not helped by the absurd fact that it is not presented in an anamorphic format (in this day & age!). Mercifully, you can zoom in the image and not lose the subtitles (you get a choice of either white or yellow letters). And this is the reason that it gets only a 3 star rating from this customer. However, if you're a fan of Moreau, romance or spy yarns, and you don't mind zooming in the image and losing some sharpness in the process, you will enjoy this Jean Louis Richard (Moreau's first husband)-Franois Truffaut (her ""Jules & Jim"" director) tailor-made vehicle for her. BTW, Jean Pierre Leaud makes a brief and unbilled turn just as Moreau made in his debut film, ""400 Blows.""",1394755200,3,1761,4.555205047318612
8490237,5,B0060AP8OW,"I love this film! Not seeing it in Leonard Maltin's book, I was a bit hesitant about getting this 1964 French version, but I'm glad that I bought it. It's full of incredible suspense, along few scenes of nice action. When you're not on the edge of your seat, there's some truly beautiful scenes of romance, along with a wonderful soundtrack, great scenes of tragedy, and a tiny bit of minor humor. Kudos to Francois Truffaut for writing this film, and to the director for knowing how to play the audience just right. The star, Jeanne Moreau also does a great job.

This is probably my favorite version of the story. Garbo was sexy, but this film has it all: sexiness, suspense, love, romance, tragedy, action, humor. Highly recommended!

It does come on a DVD-R. Unfortunately, this particular release is also non-anamorphic, so you can use the zoom feature on your TV. It comes with a  option  for white or yellow subtitles. This is probably the only release that the U.S. will see of this film, so I still recommend it.",1361836800,5,1021,4.624309392265193
