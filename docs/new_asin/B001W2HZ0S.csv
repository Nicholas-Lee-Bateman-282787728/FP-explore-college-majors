3823740,5,B001W2HZ0S,"I would like to thank's Amira, my Bellydance teacher who gave me the possibility to continue her cours and to improve my knowledge of dance thru ""Bellydance 101"" DVD. Now that I am in Asia, I really appreciate to have with me Amira's DVD which is fun,organiezed, easy to follow and which offers me the choice of different levels. I'm working now with good teachers in Singapore, and I value even more Amira's work. She gives me inspiration and motivation.",1135209600,4,455,4.7
3823741,5,B001W2HZ0S,"A Personal Letter I Recently Wrote To Amira:

""...I gave my Mom your bellydance dvd a month before her birthday, so she can perform a routine for the family on her birthday. Her confidence and commitment to bellydance has skyrocketed already, and it has barely been a week.

So I just wanted to thank you for being one of those teachers who proper posture and technique is important to while also teaching at a pace that is truly welcoming to all! You have given my mom the courage to step into the spotlight and be beautiful. THANK YOU!

Sincerely,

Your Student,

Damien aka Maharasha

I have been Amira's ONLY regular male bellydancer in her weekly classes at the Las Vegas Athletic Club for 3 months... I say this without exaggeration: Amira's DVD is made for everyone and everyone can learn something from it, no matter if you are the budding enthusiast or a seasoned professional!  I will start teaching bellydance in early 2006 at the same gym she does and without question, I am using her DVD to develop my curriculum.  It has been an invaluable help!

PLEASE check out this DVD... It will pay for itself time and time again in the techniques you will master and the confidence you will inevitably gain. Enjoy!",1135209600,3,1244,4.686635944700461
3823742,5,B001W2HZ0S,"This DVD is all that & more. I learned so much after watching it only once & was actually doing some of the sexy moves! I would highly recommend it to anyone that wants to add that missing or somewhat lacking ""something"" back into their lives. It also helps that my hubby of 20 years loves what I've learned.

It's a no brainer to me!",1135209600,5,334,4.138461538461539
3823743,5,B001W2HZ0S,"Very clear. Instruction takes good care to avoid harm. Great workout! Who knew how much of a workout Belly Dancing could be. Enjoy Amira, the music and the learning. Amira is really getting your money's worth.

3823770,5,B001W2HZ0S,"Exceptional for beginners like me!  I have invited some of my friends over to preview it, and all of them have expressed the opinion that Amira's instruction was very clear and easy to follow.  She explains each movement very well, and by following her video instruction we feel we have a better idea of what the belly dancing should start with. I am very happy with my purchase!",1422835200,,379,4.5588235294117645
3823771,5,B001W2HZ0S,"A very good video for people like me who don't have a clue and are not in good shape.  The explanations are very clear, and the workout starts out easy and gets harder.

3823774,5,B001W2HZ0S,"I want to make it clear that I am 61 years old and after many years of wishing I'd danced as a child, I finally decided to take matters into my own hands. I think Amira is a great teacher for beginners. Her little dance is pretty easy to learn and she repeats it often enough that I soon got it. Wish all the Bellydance DVD's were so easy. I really like that. For a longer lasting DVD--as far as usefulness and beauty, I would recommend Sara Skinner's Wedding Celebration DVD. I also really like Sadie's Sultry Slow moves.",1413244800,6,522,4.282828282828283

3823779,5,B001W2HZ0S,"I originally bought this DVD as a gentle ""workout"" when I don't really feel like working out. Let me tell you though, if you are not used to moving your hips and belly like a true belly dancer, you will ache in places you didn't know existed. Overall, the DVD is easy to watch and follow along and Amira is an absolute doll. I was able to learn the moves, but I am definitely no Shakira.",1407110400,8,387,4.105263157894737
3823780,5,B001W2HZ0S,I bought this for at home practice for my belly dancing class. Great for beginners!,1406073600,4,83,4.6
3823781,5,B001W2HZ0S,"I bought this video as a refresher course in belly dancing 101. I had taken an 8+ year hiatus from the dance, but recently realized that I had let go of doing something I really and truly loved, so I decided to pick it back up. Since I am currently in grad school, my funds and time are limited, so going to a class was out of the question. After reading the reviews for this video, I decided to give it a chance, and I am so glad I did! This video was PERFECT for learning and perfecting the core belly dancing moves. The pace was comfortable and the instructions were easy to follow. Amira herself is an absolute joy - I love her accent, her warm demeanor, her positive attitude, and her encouragement. She is passionate about the dance, and she is supportive of all women learning, regardless of body shape or size. The intro segment was welcoming and I believe dancers of all experience levels would appreciate the reminder of why we love this dance. I used this video every day for a month straight, until I felt comfortable practicing the moves on my own as I started to put them altogether, and this will be my go-to video for instruction in the future.",1403136000,8,1160,4.375
3823782,4,B001W2HZ0S,I got this DVD but have yet to look at it yet. My schedule has been very busy...but it came quickly,1402963200,,99,3.761904761904762
3823783,5,B001W2HZ0S,"I did some research on what were the best DVD's on belly-dancing for beginners and this one came up on top on most of the blogs I read.  After using it now, almost daily, for a month, I am feeling more smooth and confident with my moves.  Amira is very pleasant to listen to and her grace, beautiful to watch.  The moves are broken down, and she explains exactly how to do it correctly, and you can SEE what she means. I haven't tried other DVD's yet, but will most probably go with hers.",1402704000,5,488,4.170212765957447
3823784,5,B001W2HZ0S,"I've just recently started to learn how to belly dance. I thought this video was very informative on the basics of posture and the most common moves that are utilized in the art of belly dance. I would definitely recommend this video for beginners. It wasn't too long and it wasn't too short. She gives enough instruction to give you a pretty clear idea of what you should be doing, and often reminds you to check your posture so you don't hurt your lower back. I didn't think this video would be much of a workout, but I did muster up a light sweat and I felt very good, very relaxed afterward.

EDIT: I've ordered and tried out some other belly dance DVDs, which has given me a deeper perspective on the effectiveness of this one. While learning to this DVD, my middle back muscles started killing me, to the point where I couldn't sit or walk for extended periods of time. I figured I must be doing something wrong with my posture, but I didn't know what I was doing wrong. I thought I would benefit from other instructional DVDs, so I purchased Sadie's Complete Belly Dance Guide and Leila of Cairo's Belly Dance for Beginners. The instructors in these other DVDs go into a lot more detail about what you should and shouldn't be doing. I think Amira is a great instructor and I still use her video for the Combinations and stretch segments -- not to mention that her DVD has a very peaceful ambiance -- but her explanations for the movements are rather bare. I STILL recommend her instructional video, but I wanted to update my review after experiencing other beginner-friendly DVDs for belly dance.",1401062400,22,1603,4.546712802768166
3823785,5,B001W2HZ0S,This was fun sort of serious but helped me work on some moves from my belly dancing class.  Worth it if you are trying to learn the real thing.,1399593600,,143,3.9310344827586206
3823786,5,B001W2HZ0S,With this instructional bellydance DVD you'll be able to shake it better than Shakira. It will make you feel sexy and sensual. True story.,1398038400,2,138,4.791666666666667
3823787,5,B001W2HZ0S,Amira gives a lucid presentation of basic belly dancing moves for the novice.  I aim to improve my spinal health and spend less time and money with the chiropractor.  This DVD is really FUN.  Belly dancing is challenging but all the instructional elements are on this DVD and I will eventually 'get' it.  Hopefully I will also develop a more flexible spine.  I have a stack of exercise DVDs and this is my favorite by far.,1396915200,,422,4.5
3823788,4,B001W2HZ0S,I thought the filming quality of this was really good. I would have liked it if the audio was a bit clearer and if there were some samples of the dancing itself - that would be helpful in getting a picture of the moves all together. I liked how the video was laid out to be a complete practice routine.,1394928000,,302,4.05
3823789,5,B001W2HZ0S,"I have to be honest I just bought this a couple of days okay but I love it so much I wanted to review it. I have many other Belly Dancing DVDs and this has to be one of the best. Amira is so calm, patient and really makes you understand the movements. I had no idea I was doing so many moves wrong until I viewed this DVD. Amira's instruction doesn't intimidate you and it's not so easy that it bores (unless you are already an intermediate dancer). The set in the background is beautiful, and I loved the background music. One thing I really like about Amira is that she really wants you to learn and you can tell she enjoys dancing. So many DVD's I have it seems like the instructor has not put their heart into it, but with this one you can tell Amira truly loves the dance. This DVD is a must for any beginner Belly Dancer. Also although it's not technically a work out, my arms and stomach are already feeling tighter.",1394150400,3,923,4.162011173184357
3823790,4,B001W2HZ0S,I am a beginner and it helps me get a good idea about the body movement of belly dancing. It's good exercise .,1386806400,,110,3.8260869565217392
3823791,5,B001W2HZ0S,"my daughter loves doing this, the instructions are really easy to follow,  i even tried it a few times need more practice",1386288000,,121,4.5
3823792,5,B001W2HZ0S,A ver good disc that is informative as well as entertaining.  Good visually with clear sound.  A good bargain.  WOW,1384992000,,115,4.65
3823793,4,B001W2HZ0S,"This was my first belly dance DVD, and I absolutely loved it until I bought some other ones and could feel the difference. Amira is charming, she is always properly dressed, so that you can see exactly what you need to copy the move. But her explanations are pretty superficial. She doesn't give you detailed instructions on muscle work, nor safety tips. After I bought Belly by Sandra (it's really awesome and I recommend it to everyone), I realized that my hip drop and hip slides (based on Amira's instructions) were performed in a way that could hurt my hip joint, because I was not instructed how to use my muscles and keep the joint safe.
This DVD is not bad, it's pleasant to watch, but its not about precise technique. If you want a fun introduction to belly dance, you may buy this one to get you started. If you want really good instructions, skip this one and go to Sandra or Sadie.",1384992000,2,893,4.451219512195122
3823794,5,B001W2HZ0S,"This is a good DVD. I wish I could move my body better but alas, even the best DVD can't help how stiff and awkward I am. This is a fun DVD to watch though.",1383523200,,156,3.4857142857142858
3823795,5,B001W2HZ0S,This is a great step-by-step video presentation of belly dance moves and techniques. The pace is good for beginners. Love this video.,1380672000,,133,5.090909090909091
3823796,5,B001W2HZ0S,"This DVD is very good for beginning Belly Dancing. Amira gives clear instructions. She goes through an entire class; starting with the warmup and ending with the cool down. For each segment, such as shoulders, she goes step by step from easy moves to harder ones. She also gives information during lessons, such as ""if you are pregnant, you should not do this step.""
  I am taking lessons weekly and this DVD provides me with a good practice session during the rest of the week.",1379548800,,478,4.6117647058823525
3823797,5,B001W2HZ0S,I just got interested in Bellydancing. Amira lays it all out in an easy way for us noobs to understand. I like her style and she doesn't rush you through it.,1375660800,,157,4.096774193548387
3823798,5,B001W2HZ0S,I have always wanted to learn and this is a great starter to learn the basic moves.  With all the sections being played together it is an AMAZING work out!  I have been doing the dvd 4 times a week for the last 2 weeks.  Along with a moderate diet I have lost 4 pounds and my waist has pulled in 2 inches and my hips 1.  My biggest improvement since I have started is I now have a bum!  The muscles are becoming more firm in the old junk and i no longer have pancake bum :D heh,1374710400,6,477,3.7777777777777777
3823799,4,B001W2HZ0S,It is a good product and it meets my expectations. I have used it and i would tell others about it.,1374451200,,99,3.761904761904762
3823800,5,B001W2HZ0S,This is a pretty intense workout. But it is a lot of fun. I think that it's a fun way to exercise.,1369094400,,98,3.5
3823801,4,B001W2HZ0S,"I learned a lot about belly dance from Amira. I liked the different sections for arms, hips, etc. I like how she goes through each movement at three different speeds -slow, medium and fast. I like that (except for the end routine), the dancer is not wearing performance wear, but rather clothing that makes it easier for you to follow the movements.

The warm up for this DVD is probably my favorite part. It is so much fun, and even freeing. I find myself using this warmup in conjunction with other workouts, because I like it so much.

I enjoyed the routine that you can follow at the end, where Amira puts all the dance movements together into one beautiful, theatrical experience.

I found myself after using this DVD for a while, with better posture. I also found myself moving with greater grace. This is a wonderful benefit to me, as I tend to slouch and can be quite clumsy.

The one thing that I really dislike about this video is that it feels homemade. The quality isn't the greatest, and the transitions can be a bit awkward. If this DVD were more professional, I would have have given it 5 stars.",1369008000,6,1110,4.48019801980198
3823802,5,B001W2HZ0S,"I would recommend this product to those who are new to belly dance. She moves at a pace that is good for beginners and she keeps the movement simple, yet fluid. On top of all of this, she teaches you an easy choreography at the end; which is not common on most belly dance videos! I really appreciate that because that is what I wish more of these belly dance videos would have included in the lesson. I am a fan Amira!",1366243200,2,419,4.121951219512195
3823803,5,B001W2HZ0S,"I started belly dancing with ""Jenna's Belly Dance Basics and Beyond"", which was a good introduction to belly dancing.
I have been using Amira's video daily for 10 days now, and I really like the fun, hour-long workout.
You get to do the warm up, then practice some head, shoulder, chest, hip moves and shimmies. After that you do a little fun combination dance and at end comes a good stretch.
You can do the moves as she introduces them or, if you are already comfortable with one move, you can practice at your own pace as she goes from one exercise to the other (you just tune out the instruction and listen to the music).
One thing to consider: Amira doesn't reverse the side when giving directions, so that might be confusing at first.
I recommend this DVD to any beginner who wants an enjoyable core workout.",1366156800,3,814,4.506756756756757
3823804,4,B001W2HZ0S,I like that it is easy to follow and she is a great instructor. I would recommend buying the DVD.,1366156800,,97,3.9
3823805,5,B001W2HZ0S,"...I enjoy the DVD.  It's straightforward, paced right, informative and - well, kinda fun.  Her voice is soothing; you get the feeling that ""hey, maybe I don't suck at this as much as I thought I would"".",1361145600,,203,4.45945945945946
3823806,5,B001W2HZ0S,MY weight has yoyoed up and down for years. I finally discovered I liked belly dancing. It was fun and didn't seem like work but I wanted something instructional without being boring. This is it. Amira takes the time to show you each move and gives you time to practice. She includes a warmup and cool down. By the time it was over I was felt a little tired and had no idea I had been through an hour's worth of instruction. But while doing it my muscles definitely felt it. What I did have was a lot of fun. Its perfect for the out of shape exerciser looking to try something new or the beginner belly dancer wanting to see if this is for them.,1358553600,2,645,4.126984126984127
3823807,5,B001W2HZ0S,"Amira demonstrates and explains very well.  I haven't had it long, but what I have seen and experienced, it will be fun for a long time.  Belly dancing is a very good exercise for all ages, shapes, and sizes of women.  With a little modification, women that are 80 can do it.  It is low impact so those with arthritis or other health issues (like me) can belly dance.  It's a fun way to get more flexible and more exercise.  It would be advisable to modify some of the movements for your own particular issues.",1358467200,,510,4.315789473684211
3823808,5,B001W2HZ0S,"This is a great DVD for beginners.  She shows a basic move, then dances it for practice right away.  She gets you dancing right away even if you have no experience with any kind of dancing before.  This DVD is perfect for someone just thinking about learning belly dancing.",1357862400,,273,4.530612244897959

She breaks the movements down for you so you follow along, then you put it altogether.  The pace was perfect in terms of my trying to learn how to do belly dance.

She has a good personality and makes you feel like you can do this as she brings you along.  Really nice set and music.  If you are a beginner, this one really works.",1356566400,,536,3.9626168224299065

The way Amira teaches is not interesting or engaging.  I was very bored, and I've never been bored dancing before.  I'm a beginner, and even I found this to be way too easy.  Dancing should be fun, yet this DVD makes it incredibly dull.  Amira's instructions were not clear, and she talked a little too much about irrelevant things.  I like it best when instructors are concise and to the point.  It was very hard to get through the entire DVD.

I would not recommend this to anybody.  If you are new to belly dancing, this will most likely turn you off from it.  It sure did for me, though I hope to find a better DVD sometime soon.",1351036800,6,760,4.244755244755245

If you already know the basics, then you won't get much out of it, but if you want to learn how to do snake arms, basic hip movements and shimmies, this is perfect.

Gradually, I feel I'm building better coordination and technique and can execute more complicated choreography by regularly returning to Amira's basic warm-ups.

In the past, I had purchased a few videos and they were disappointing, and ended up being sent to a thrift store. ""Hokey"" comes to mind for some, and for others, they were too advanced, as one needs to learn the basics before you can ""layer"" moves. Amira explains posture and proper technique and the instruction will progress with the DVD. The setting of the DVD takes you to another place and inspires the inner artist.

Beyond the belly dance instruction, this DVD has given me so much more. I no longer endure crunches, or ab machines to tone my abs, the movements taught are enjoyable, and soothing, and I lost inches. I also gained inner confidence in learning an ancient dance that fascinates people all over the world, my posture is better, I have become more graceful and aware of how I project my body and the way I move. The DVD gave me the basics and much more. When I took classes, I was able to participate with confidence. Although I have advanced, I still use the DVD to perfect what I have learned!

Buy it! You will not go wrong! A testament from someone who spent too much money on poor videos!

Dance with joy,

I love the fact that she gives about a five minute warm up before actually getting started. The setting was great. It did not give all those weird angles that a lot of others do. I was able to see all the important areas when I needed to. Her voice is calm and soothing. She really takes time to explain every step. I don't think I was doing the body wave correctly, even though I am pretty sure that I did what she instructed. Guess I'll have to get a dance teacher to explain that one and tell me what I am doing wrong. Over all, I think this is a good introduction to Bellydance. I was able to keep up with the moves and transitions. However, it was just too slow and dull for me. Yes, I'll probably go through this DVD again, but I might put it in my PS3 and speed it up a bit with my own music in the background.

Amira is a great instructor, the routines are easy to follow, and you really get a good workout! There is so much more to the movements in bellydance than I had ever thought. There are subtleties of movement that make all the difference, and let me tell you, you will find muscles in your waist, stomach, back and hips that you didn't even know were there. All the movements are extremely controlled too, so you end up keeping your muscles tight and drawn in at all times, which helps with toning. Plus, the workouts are fun, and you get to shake your hips and feel a little sexy! I highly recommend this DVD!",1336867200,4,744,4.321428571428571

There isn't a class available in the town I live in, so I looked into DVD instruction. I had originally ordered a beginning Belly Dance DVD by Veena Bidasha and Neena Bidasha. It was a good video, but IMO didn't focus on the beginning student. Their DVD's are for more advanced Belly Dancers. They weren't as detailed in INSTRUCTING a person on what to do, how to do it and slowly like you'd find in a dance studio setting. Amira's instruction starts off with a little history on Belly Dancing. Then she SLOWLY and WITH GREAT DETAIL instructed the viewer on how to do belly dancing, including where to place back, hips, feet, etc. This DVD is MUCH BETTER when it comes to teaching someone how to Belly Dance than Veena Bidasha and Neena Bidasha's DVD. Amira's DVD is broken up into chapters (Introduction, Position, Warmup, Heads and Shoulders, Chest, Hips, Shimmies, Combination and Stretch) so you can pick and choose which area you want to work on.",1336694400,5,1077,4.643979057591623

I like all of the DVDs for different reasons, but this one is my MOST FAVORITE, and the ONLY ONE I'm doing on a daily basis at the moment, because it has been the best for beginners. I love the way that she breaks down the movements and reminds you which muscles the movements should be coming from. You start out each movement slowly to gain the control and awareness of the muscle that's used, and she is good at instructing you on how to keep your form as you pick up the pace. Her voice is warm and encouraging, she's a great teacher. She also demonstrates the movements beautifully. I will keep doing this DVD for awhile until I feel like I've mastered the moves in this DVD, before I move on to the other DVDs that I've purchased.

I was looking to see if she has anymore DVDs and I came across her website. She has a DVD for pregnant women, and as this doesn't apply to me and I didn't see any others, I emailed her to ask if she had any others or if she's making anymore.

Her shimmy lesson is fabulous. she really breaks it down. I personally could not learn the camel from her, but that's just me. For that I recommend Tribal fusion with Rachel brice dvd or Tiazza Wilson's Belly dance video blog. And just so you know, there really is no dance at the end of this. it's just a simple repetitive practice combo. I was a little disappointed by that at first.

3823826,5,B001W2HZ0S,"I've been practicing belly dance for a while now with DVD's of Neon, Blanca, and Sarah Skinner being amongst my favorites; however, I just popped in Amira's DVD and learned quite a bit though I'm familiar with these basic moves. She focuses on posture, which is critical to get correct, and on the basic movements. I learned I had not been tucking my tailbone in, which had been leading me to some lower back discomfort after belly dance workouts. Unless I am forgetting something, I do not believe this was focused on in some of my other DVD's. She also helped me understand how to improve some movements by helping me understand them better. The filming is very clear and the shots and angles are in the right places so you can see what is going on.

Amira outlines the basic, fun moves of belly dance in a very clear manner. Though I would not use this DVD repeatedly for long workouts, it is:

1.) a great place to start to learn how to belly dance by developing a strong foundation and putting these movements into your muscle memory strongly and correctly so that they are there when you need them, and so that you do not injure yourself by incorrect posture.

2.) helpful even if you already have some belly dance experience, like me. It is a good refresher, and indeed acted as a corrective measure for me. There is always room for improvement!",1314403200,6,1352,4.510204081632653

3823828,4,B001W2HZ0S,"I was very impressed by this DVD. Amira shows the basics of head/shoulders, chest, hips, and shimmies. After you have mastered all the movements you can combine all of them by copying her, first doing 8 beats at a time then four beats at a time. There also is a recorded performance by her so you can see her style when she's not teaching.
She clearly explains how to do each move and demonstrates how it is done, breaking it down in stages from the very beginning up into what the completed move will be. If you're not careful, though, you might get overwhelmed. Even though you have to understand that you need to work it up slowly and go at your own pace, it sometimes scared me a little but when I was just getting the hang of something and she'd say ""Now do it faster!""
I also wish she had broken down the Snake Arms part a little more. It certainly is a very difficult move, but after watching that part countless times and practicing, I just can't get the hang of it. If there was a way to make shoulder shimmies more comfortable for larger-chested women I also would have liked that. I just can't seem to do it without feeling like I'm sending them flying everywhere.

Overall this was a very helpful instructional DVD and I would recommend it!",1309737600,2,1252,4.373390557939914
3823829,5,B001W2HZ0S,"Very nice DVD. She doesn't spend too much  time on each move, she just teaches them. Many times she will show an optional way to make each move a bit more difficult, so that you improve further.

I'm at fault for that, though; I mean, it's called ""Bellydance 101"", so what'd I expect?

Anyway, I'd recommend this to someone who is wholeheartedly looking to learn the art of belly dancing. If you are looking for instructions followed by a workout routine, look elsewhere.",1306800000,2,540,4.556701030927835

I was originally expecting more lively choreography throughout, or for a longer period of time at the end, but as Amira went through each move step by step, I realized that as a beginner how important it was to invest more time in those steps to ensure I have the correct posture and control to advance. The video runs for about an hour, but only feels like 30 minutes, so I was surprised when I reached the end.

I thought the video was informative, fun to follow, and I appreciated that it stressed proper positions to ensure the viewer's safety. It will probably take some time dancing in front of a mirror and watching it 3 or 4 more times before I feel ready to take classes or buy a more advanced video. Again, it's not a lively aerobic workout, but it offers some great exercises for you to practice and hopefully tone up with.

Amira is a good instructor, really encouraging.  She'll not only break down the movements, but she acknowledges that it might take a few tries to get a movement down (like the neck slides....for most of us it probably isn't the most intuitive movement).  Throughout the DVD, she reminds the viewer the keep a good posture and the knees soft.  And what a natural and engaging smile!  A lot of instructional or workout DVDs have the person leading it smile, but those always seem so cardboard.  Amira seems so relaxed and natural about showing each of the movements.

 trust your moves to be safe and not harmful to the body of older dancers like
 me. I will not loan my DVD to friends any more since it is TOO difficult to get them to return it. I think they wait until they get their own. Once they see and hear how calm and fun you make learning with your lovely voice and excellent moves they HAVE to have one.

Even for someone who has never had a real life teacher I BELIEVE if you took this DVD broke it down (which actually she does for you, in that she teaches one step at a time) so that if you took that one step as one lesson spent say a week or even longer if a week wasn't enough for you for that particular move. Then practiced & practiced that move until you owned it then moved on to the next move, do the same with each move until finally you have them all as ""your moves"" you would be able to do a nice little dance. And all you've spent is the very reasonable price of the DVD, the time it took you to learn & you're on your way! Now get a couple friends to join you & you've added fellowship, fun & time well spent exercising all your muscle groups & you hardly even knew you were exercising & getting into the best shape of your life! Your self esteem will grow, your whole outlook on life will improve! I can say this because Bellydance DID CHANGE my life!! What most people don't realize is Bellydance is & always has been a dance by women for women, I know our men love it too BUT it started out as fellowship among women.  Amira shows you how to put your moves together to do just that---a nice little dance of which you'll be so proud! I can't tell you how many dancers I've seen in the 35yrs I've been doing this, how many videos, performances, workshops, teachers, & even some of the most famous dancers & if I were going to make a DVD I would want it to be like this one. First & foremost she is a BEAUTIFUL & ACCOMPLISHED dancer, then remarkably is JUST as PERFECT a teacher. Trust me it rarely ever happens in one package but HERE IT IS! I've seen so many beautiful dancers that try to teach & just can't impart what you need to learn the move! And actually most of the dancers that are making the DVDs are not even mediocre dancers never mind the teaching part, so you spend the money looking forward to seeing something outstanding & beautiful then the BITTER disappointment when you view it. I promise you this one will not disappoint, especially if you're looking for a GREAT instructional DVD & she truly is that rare thing---a graceful, beautiful accomplished dancer! I've recommended this DVD to more people than I can count! I'm eagerly awaiting a second DVD & hope she does one soon!!!! I'm continually checking Amazon to see if she's done a second one! I would love to see her in action live! And would also love a strictly performance DVD. I found her web-site the other night & on there is a link to an on-line costume shop, which trust me you'll WANT a costume! I checked briefly & their prices seemed reasonable.",1266364800,2,2943,4.264758497316637

Their review talked about this DVD like it had no flaws.. When  it arrived usualy u have to sign for items that are shipped to u, not this time, I so just happened to look down and I saw an envelope..I opened the package and saw the DVD.. I was so exicted to recieve the package.. popped it in to the DVD player.. It started off  wit a nice introduction to the culture, cool. Then they started showing u how to do the moves, waiting when they will give a good workout, get some cardio up in there, do a dance, something, I wiated went to different chapters, DISAPPOINTED.. I'm looking for a dvd that gives me a good workout.. Trying to lose some weight and tone up my body.. I thought belly dancing will be the best since it has the major areas where I want to lose weight, hips thighs, stomach... this dvd is good when u want to learn the moves.. not for a workout..

3823853,5,B001W2HZ0S,"An excellent beginner's video, Bellydance 101 goes through drills for all the important body areas: shoulders, neck, hips, chest, head, arms. Each section drills an area and Amira spends ample time drilling the basics, but also gives a taste of the more intermediate variations to be formed from each move. She is charming, with the continual reminders for good form that are to be expected from any good teacher. I like the fact that she changes outfits for every section so you don't get bored with the visuals. There is no troupe of people behind her, which helps the lesson seem intimate and focused.

Right now I am not very fit or coordinated, but even after six times practicing this video I can feel my form and my fitness improving. For the uninitiated, bellydancing is very focused and difficult. The isolation of certain muscles, while others are to remain still, is tough but rewarding.

I get so board with weight lifting or walking and running and swimming.  Belly dancing gives me the freedom to shake up my own routine and allows me to feel sexy at the same time.

The setting is lovely and restful, with beautifully sensuous pillows and gauzy drapes hanging in the background. The music is exotic and hypnotic, and Amira's voice and pleasant accent make you feel you're on a nice vacation, far from your own stressful world. The exercises are explained carefully and done slowly, so that you can pick them up. They are filmed in such a way that you can see the movement (no cutting away to a face while you are trying to figure out what the hips are doing.) There is a warm-up at the beginning and a gentle stretch at the end. If you skip the combination, which you might want to do at first, while you're learning the movements, you can do the whole dvd in an hour. The sections are short enough so as not to tire you out or frustrate your beginner's attention span. At some point this workout might become too basic, but I suspect I would always want to come back to it sometimes, on days when I'm not feeling so strong, or when I just want to de-stress.

I thought it was a beautiful art form and a great workout, but no matter how many DVDs I tried, something was still wrong when I watched myself performing the moves in the mirror.  I couldn't figure out what I wasn't doing right.  And I've been working at it.  I've got over twenty bellydance DVDs.  The Goddess Workout (which was my favorite up till now), Veena and Neena, Suhaila, Rania, Blanca, Neon...I swear I have everybody represented.

My point is that Amira explains the moves in a way that I was able to understand and grasp.  i can finally do the Camel and it looks right!  I get it now.  This new understanding affects my ability to do all my other bellydance workouts and videos, and I think Amira has been instrumental in that change.

I practiced athletics for more then 10 years and classic ballet before. So I managed to ruin my lumbar vertebrae and the only recommended physical exercise was swimming. It helped a lot but I could see a decrease of my lower back mobility and it was worsening no matter my efforts to stop it. My physical therapist (an Egyptian girl) recommended belly dancing. First I thought she was making fun of me but after I gave to this suggestion two months of thinking I bought Amira's bellydance DVD. I received the DVD 8 months ago and practiced at list 3 times a week; it was the exercise I needed. When I decided that I could ace :) the beginner level I looked for an Amira's intermediate but unfortunately didn't find it. So I chose Jena's intermediate bellydance and I had no problems with following Jena's instructions; she's great too. In fact a pleasant surprise was to see Amira invited to one of Jena's demonstrations.

Amira will walk you through the basic moves and instruct you on the correct postures.  Her voice is very soothing and the background is very pretty.  The reason why I gave this DVD 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the way the menu is set up.  Usually I skip the intro once I see it the first time and go directly to the warm up.  The DVD will then automatically go to the next chapter without my having to stop and physically press it to go to the next one, which is the case with this DVD.  Every time a chapter is finished, it stops and go back to the menu.  I then have to move the cursor and select the next chapter.

Last year I took some bellydancing classes, and had such fun I grabbed up some DVD's for extra practice.  If you are looking for a thorough, well thought out basic introduction to bellydancing technique, this is the one for you!

The set is lavish, the music is mesmerizing, and Amira is lovely and thorough in her instruction. She has great tips to help you visualize exactly how to perform each movement.  I also really love how the instruction is never rushed -- I never felt frustrated or behind, never had to press pause. On the other hand, I didn't feel like the pacing was too slow either.

In addition, there are multiple viewing angles used during instruction, and this is very effective.

The DVD is broken down into several chapters (starting with a warmup) to take you through each area of focus, such as head and shoulders, hips, and so on.  This is quite helpful and convenient -- I sometimes just pop it in and go to a certain chapter for review of personal ""trouble spots"" (i.e. for me, undulations!).

Wrapping it up - after you learn your basics, you can put them to the test by going to the chapter with combinations of the moves.

Using this DVD never fails to leave me feeling graceful, feminine, and exotic!

I'm now more in the advanced beginner/intermediate range, but I still refer back to her DVD from time to time...it never hurts to brush up on the basics to see if you are maintaining correct form (it's easy to lapse into bad habits).

I still don't find it boring...think of ballet--they practice plies, releves, etc every day, no matter how experienced they are. No matter how advanced you are, it doesn't hurt to occasionally go back to the basics.

Also, Amira herself is adorable. Her instructions are clear, she provides great analogies (""think of having little pistons on your hips..."") and she just plain has a sweet, encouraging attitude. On a lighter note, I love her accent. (""Put your hand on your 'ties' (thighs)..."" LOL)...very sweet.

I emailed her and asked if she is putting out an intermediate DVD and she says that--since people ask her that every day--she has decided that she will. I will be one of the first ones to buy!!

If you are even considering learning belly dance, get this video; if you are more advanced and want to practice drills, get this video...it is the best one I have so far!",1190764800,7,1350,4.635983263598327

Now I am a total couch potato, but I have always wanted to learn to belly dance.  I saw that this DVD got great reviews, so I bought it.

Well, I also ended up buying a couple of others that were supposed to be good for beginners -- not!  Maybe beginners who are fit to begin with, or who already know the proper belly dance posture and warmup routines.  But Amira's DVD -- this I could do.

The DVD covers:  proper posture, warmup routine, isolations for:  head, shoulder, torso and hips.  Shimmies are also included -- shoulder and hip.  And something I've always wanted to do -- snake arms!

Amira is also great because she looks like a normal person -- not someone so skinny that you see their hipbones jutting out.  And it doesn't hurt that Amira's quite pretty.

One other thing Amira does that I truely appreciated -- she mentions a few times to try your best *but* respect your body's limitations as well.  She doesn't come across as being a drill seargent, but rather radiates a gentle encouragement.

If I had one wish, I would have liked to see a little bit about hand movements.  Amira covers arm movements, but not the hands.

This is one DVD that deserves more than 5 stars!",1185494400,14,1309,4.3875
3823900,5,B001W2HZ0S,"This DVD is definitely for begginers belly dancers.  Amira does a great job at demonstrating the basic moves and keeps each segment long enough for you to get the idea and practice but not so long you get bored or tired of it.  She explains and talks through each move to ensure you understand the movement or isolation and I enjoy the music in the background. There is a nice combination at the end that is easy to follow and fun to do.  I can tell there is a underlying hint to yoga practice in her style of teaching and I do not mind it since I do yoga to. Amira has a pleasent voice which makes it pleasent to follow her instructions.  However, I found the segments to be very basic and the overall lenght of the instructional piece to short.  I would have like to see other isolations or moves in the DVD.  I use this DVD when I do not have a whole lot of time and do not want to miss a day of practice.  Amira included a performance at the end of the DVD but even though I think she is very skillfull and a great instructor her performance was disappointing and did not impress me it lacked vibrance.  Overall, great instructional DVD and I highly reccomended for begginers only.",1182556800,5,1185,4.235555555555556

3823903,4,B001W2HZ0S,"This is a good production quality dvd with chapters & bonus performance by Amira.

This is set so that it looks like Amira is in a traditional Middle Eastern tent. The choices of volors/fabric & decoration is wonderful, though to me it felt a little claustrophobic but doesn't hamper/distract the great teaching.

Amira is very relaxed, friendly, patient. This is a learning like a class dvd, not a workout, though she does have you practice for a decent amount of time before moving on. Even better, the music is slow/soft to start which bored me, but it increased in tempo so that I did full speed on moves since I already knew them from my many other bellydance dvds. Even though I own more, her teaching is great, she taught me that snake arms come fron the shoulders, not the arms which makes a huge difference.

Amira starts with a short 3 min intro about belly dance history & benefits.

There is about a 5 min stretch with head rolls, shoulder rolls, hip stretch, squats & spine stretch movements.

Head/Sshoulders - head shifts, snack arms, wings

Chest - shifts, vertical & horizontal chest circles, camel

Hips - hip single & double bumps, hip circles, hip lifts & drops & w/kick & diff directions, hip twists, figure 8s, vertical figure 8 is touched on,

body wave

Shimmies - Lebonnese/hip focused & Egyptian knee focused

Combinations - simple routine of shoulder shimmy, chest lifts, shoulder roll, hip lifts/drops, body wave & ends in shimmy done 4x in faster succession.

The learning/practice  portion ends at about the 55 min mark.

This dvd is best for people new to bellydance or feel that they didn't get enough detailed instruction on ones they already own. If you feel you already happy with how you execute with the moves listed above, skip this dvd.

The music is great, the instruction is great, and like others said: the camera work, voice over work, and the like are wonderfully the way they should be - in stark contrast to many other bellydance videos.  Amira takes the time to go over and explain movements, and also includes an effective warmup and cooldown.

I am not in the best of shape so I was looking to find something fun to do so I could get off my butt. I am not able to keep up with most cardio or dance dvds as I am uncoordinated...so I was apprehensive about buying any dance dvd including bellydancing....Let me tell you I was sweating after the warm up(did I mention I was seriously out of shape) I did the first half and will do the second half tomorrow.(again seriously out of shape) I highly recomend it for beginners.

She has a very soothing tone which you won't get sick of hearing. She isolates all the movements and then does a combined move. She breaks down the parts of the body head, arms, chest, hips, shimmies, ect. You can play all from the beginning or go through individual chapters. So if you have the shimmies down but really need to work on the chest you can with out having to run through the whole dvd. The music is great to because it goes to each move and at the correct speed for the section she is showing you ( I know that last part is a little hard to understand but when you get the dvd you will go ""I get what she was saying""!).

I would recomend for anyone wanting to learn or perfect there technique. For some like my self you will get some cardio benefit, but for girls that are in shape the best that this can do is perfect your movements. All in all it is a win win for everyone.",1176508800,7,1556,4.0816993464052285

I can't dance to save my life, but she breaks it down and makes it simple and not intimidating, so that even someone as totally un-coordinated as I am can actually get it.  (although I'm still working on doing the opposite snake arms...) And it is too much fun!  I have a very hard time sticking with any form of exercise, but I really look forward to doing this every day!  I am out of shape after my 3rd child and having knee problems; this is no impact but you are working your muscles and really feel it the next day.  I have also seen an amazing decrease in general ""aches and pains"" since starting this; I don't know if that's due to posture improvement or better muscle tone or what, but I'm thrilled and I know it's related to doing this DVD.  I am a total beginner and obviously  no expert on belly dance, but I can say that this is a lot of fun and really makes you feel good!!!  I think that someone who really picks this up quickly might  want something more challenging, or maybe just a longer section of actual dancing, after several times through.  I agree with the person who suggested having a mirror when you do this; that really helps.",1173744000,12,1282,4.238683127572016

I believe that is the way to go and I recommend getting a dvd even if you are taking a course.  I researched which belly dancing dvd's were great for beginners and Amira is definitely up there.  She teaches you some of the very basic belly dancing moves.  The dvd is broken into sections isolating the hips, the chest, shimmies, etc.  She gives you verbal and visual instruction on how to perform the moves.  There is a descent warm-up and cool-down and a nice comibnation at the end that puts together some of what you have learned.  After a while I had become bored with the dvd not because I had mastered all the moves but because I noticed other beginner dvd's had some more advanced moves in addition to what Amira was teaching.  You feel a slight burn as you do with most physical activity but this is not a cardio dvd, not much for fat burning.  I don't think Amira covers the most important basic movements of belly dacning but she does a great job with what she does cover.",1173225600,13,1106,4.330097087378641

Anyway I bought this DVD and did not use it until many months later when I found an excellent teacher in my area which I am still learning with now.  The moves in the DVD are clear, easy to understand and the ladies voice makes me feel like I can do it.  She gives a lot of compliments throughout and this is very supportive.

My teacher even borrowed my DVD as she found the description on the shimmies an excellent way to teach and was new to her which she now teaches in all her beginners classes.

I have a great time with this beginner's session every time I pop it in.  It moves at a reasonable pace for my 44 year old self.  By the end, I'm ""glowing"" but not actually panting.

Yet, I am aware at my age that fitness and flexibility are important.  Muscular women standing at the front of a class yelling out the tired old motivation phrases in a gym doesn't do it for me. I was cruising around here on Amazon and I found belly dancing for fitness. The reviews helped me make up my mind and I bought Amiras DVD. While Amira is gorgeous, young and a body to die for.  You soon forget all those details as she takes you through the routines.  Perhaps its the cultural background she gives, belly dancing is by women for women.  Size  or your present fitness levels should not restrict you from at least trying belly dancing. Amira shows warm up and warm down exercises that naturally flow with the dance routines.  Slow, methodical and easy, and yet she tested body parts I didn't even know I could move.  Rewind to your hearts content until you get it right.  Amira has a nice soothing, inspirational voice.  Great camera angles to show you how to do certain steps.  Practise your shimmys while you do the dishes.

Only one gripe,  the DVD format is being sold as all regions.  It's not. It's probably US & Canada. Luckily my daughter has a laptop, and I use that for viewing.",1170201600,10,1333,4.477178423236515
3823914,5,B001W2HZ0S,"I've often thought that if having a belly is a criterion for belly dancing, I was certainly well-qualified; further, if I'm going to cart this belly around, I might as well tone and slim it down.  Since I am a woman ""of a certain age"", there are muscle groups I haven't used since grade school, so I was anxious that I not rupture anything.  Amira's Belly Dance 101 provides simple, straight-forward, easy to understand directions (including what NOT to do) for each movement.  At first, my brain sent signals to large muscle groups that were ignored, as though the muscles were on a coffee break and couldn't be bothered to respond, but by persistently sending the signals over time I could see things like lateral chest movement, alternating shoulder thrusts, and smooth hip slides.  I used Amira's warm up, isolating exercises, and cool down like a regular exercise tape and disregarded combinations until I had every one of the individual isolating movements down pat.  Then I moved on to Ansuya's Lavish Layers in much the same way I approached Amira's 101, and now I do both tapes. Ansuya's tape is also excellent, but for jumping into belly dancing as a rank beginner, Amira's Belly 101 is far and away the clearest route.  In addition to toning up my mid-section, I've increased my spine and neck flexibility, and mobility of movement overall.  Want to know the best part?  IT'S FUN!",1169078400,17,1391,4.7907949790794975

Amira's Bellydance 101 is the very best instructional video for the absolute beginner and I beleive Amira can teach anyone to bellydance.

She also has great warm-up and cool-down routines that start and the the DVD (I also use the warm-up in the morning bfore starting my day). The movements are also divided into catagories by what part of the body you are using (Head and shoulders, chest, hips, etc. also has shimmies).

Amira gives clear explanations and visual demonstrations step by step to help you understand the basic moves that are the foundation of bellydance. She teaches many foundation movements from hip drops to basic shimmies, pays special attention to proper dance posture, and includes a warm-up/cool-down.
The overall production of the DVD is very professional, good lighting and sound. There are no annoying, abrupt camera angles or zoom effects. Amira's outfits are tasteful and appropriate, and do not distract from, or hide her movements.

Though I enjoyed the ""combinations"" section, a short repetitive drill of the moves learned, I have to say I was disappointed that it did not show how to layer the moves together to create a simple dance routine.

Overall, I would highly recommend this DVD to anyone who is a beginner to bellydance. It is a good ""starter"" instructional DVD for the person who does not have access to a bellydance class and great for ""at home practice"" for those that do. Another great beginner bellydance DVD to try is Bellydance Basics and Beyond with Jenna.

The first sequence about posture is very informative and I like Amira's efforts to contrast 'this is the correct way to do a move', and 'this is not the correct way to do a move'.  It gives you great pointers and I find it most effective to have a full-length mirror next to the TV so I can see my form properly.  I would like it if there was a second combination at the end or more moves to grow with.  Lastly, I don't recommend this for 'production snobs'- this is about bellydance, not cinematography.

3823926,5,B001W2HZ0S,"First of all, I think the best instructional and workout DVD is ""Learn lavish layers with Ansuya"".

But Amira's disk is also of exemplary quality, and I can see how for some people it might be the best place to start:

-  Amira teaches the proper posture and reminds you about it throughout her lesson. Majority of instructional videos neglect that.
-  Her instructions are more thoughtful than in any other bellydance program I've seen so far (except Ansuya's).
- Unlike some instructors who don't realize that you need to practice the moves individually before you can put them together and up to speed, Amira makes sure you absorb each movement by repeating it many times.
- The camera is always where it belongs (which is rare in the world of bellydance videos).
-  Amira's style is very soothing and helps focus on movement execution. There are bellydancers that are more picturesque, but their intense Mideastern charm might overwhelm or distract a beginner. Their bodies also may intimidate an overweight novice, whereas Amira shows that you don't have to be slender to be able to move with admirable grace. And Amira is certainly pretty as well.
- Amira's appearance and the choice of background and music are very tasteful.

This video is probably the gentlest, non-intimidating introduction to bellydance I've seen so far. But the drawback of this approach is that you might outgrow it rather quickly. ""Learn lavish layers with Ansuya"" will prove much more efficient in the long run.",1146787200,309,1493,4.9282868525896415
3823927,5,B001W2HZ0S,"I must say this DVD is an excellent start for anyone interested in bellydance. Not only does Amira break down and explain the movement and how to execute it, she also shows you different ways of learning and breaking down the moves. It is extremely helpful as everybody learns differently. I have been bellydancing for a little over a year but rarely get to take a technique class anymore. I do this DVD everyday. It has definately helped me improve, especially my shimmies. One of my favorite aspects of the DVD is that Amira not only focuses on the movement and technique but your breathing and mental clarity as well. She uses some ""meditation-like"" visualizations during the warm-up and cool down that I find help calm me down and relax. Having taken class with Amira a few times, I can tell you she is an absolutely amazing and beautiful person inside and out and it shows through on this DVD. A definite must have!

Let me tell you they are few and far between.  This is an EXCELLENT instructional DVD.  Amira gives you wonderful tips and visuals for learning the different moves.  Besides the quality instruction, this is shot very well: the camerawork and the voiceover are right on cue, and that is not easy to find.  If you are interested in learning to bellydance, do yourself a favor and buy this DVD.  You will get a lovely introduction to this dance from a very good teacher.  I promise you will not regret it.  If you are still unsure after reading these reviews, then look at the price.  Amira's DVD is half the cost of other instructional (not fitness) DVDs out there and she is a far better teacher than many of them.  You won't regret it.  I hope she comes out with more DVDs soon!",1136246400,25,943,4.325714285714286
3823931,5,B001W2HZ0S,"I know Amira personally & like her very much; however, this review is NOT based on that.  This DVD is a very good start for anyone interested in belly dancing - Amira has studied with several professionals herself & done research before putting this DVD together.  This DVD is easy to see what's being done; easy to understand; is well put together; and will benefit anyone getting started in belly dancing.  I definitely recommend this DVD for your beginning collection.

It's not only the best way of working out, it is also a key to the magic and beautiful world of bellydance.

8346883,5,B001W2HZ0S,"I admit, I have two left feet, and coordination issues. I also have back problems, but needed to find a way to exercise that keeps me interested. I'm 48 years old, and decided to try belly dancing for the first time. If you are new to this, or are a slow learner like I am, this is the best instructional dvd out there. (I compare this to the 4 other instructional dvds i have).  Amira has a very soothing voice and is VERY thorough. There's a warm up (and a cool down). She flows from the warm up, right into the instruction, and before you know it, she has you doing isolations, and various movements. She starts with proper posture, which is extremely important before doing any belly dance. She reminds you where you should be feeling muscle involvement, and where you shouldn't, which is so helpful to avoid injury. She starts from the head/neck, to arms, to chest,  to diaphragm, to hips,  and does each section slowly enough for you to get it before moving on. Towards the end, she has you putting it all together for a slow dance routine, which she  repeats  enough for you to actually feel like you've learned something (which I've honestly never felt with other dvds).  The other dvds were lacking in certain areas, such as what to do with my arms, or warm ups/cool downs,  or which muscles to focus on,  but NOT this one. It has it ALL.  I wish i had bought this dvd before attempting any of the others!! If i could give this one 10 stars, i would. VERY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!",1526083200,,1486,4.413919413919414

8346885,4,B001W2HZ0S,I love the instruction and do work up a good sweat for someone that is not very flexible and haven't workout for awhile. I just wish it had more combination segments. Once you get the movements down it seems like it needs to be longer because I feel silly just going through the instruction again just to add more to my workout. I did end up purchasing other videos that were either way to slow or way advanced. I looked for an intermediate by Amira but unfortunately didn't find one.,1518825600,,484,4.388888888888889
8346886,5,B001W2HZ0S,This video is a good place to start learning to belly dance. It takes it nice and slow and really shows you the moves before it speeds up. I feel like it would be more fun if you had one of those cool coin belts. So them you can hear the sounds. Just a suggestion,1502841600,,263,3.8
8346887,5,B001W2HZ0S,Amazing! This is a SPECTACULAR video for beginners such as myself.,1498521600,,66,5.090909090909091
8346888,5,B001W2HZ0S,One of the best instructional belly dancing videos that we have tried!!  She makes it so much easier to actually figure out what you are doing...

8346890,5,B001W2HZ0S,"Finally a true beginner's guide.  She breaks everything down and has exercises that you do for each move.  Filmed well and the instructions are clear and straight forward.  If you are looking to build a good foundation and how to do the moves properly, this is for you.
