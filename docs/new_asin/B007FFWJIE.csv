5081071,5,B007FFWJIE,"If you are a fan of exploitation films, this is a must have.  I especially enjoyed the commentary (which clocks in at 3.5 hours...the length of the feature).  Can't imagine sitting and watching in one sitting but great in short bursts or as something to have on during a party or gettogether.  If you don't like the trailer, wait a couple of minutes and there will be more.",1357776000,,373,4.455882352941177
5081072,3,B007FFWJIE,"I always loved the trailer compilations of movies from the past. My favorite being Afros, Macks, and Zodiacs hosted by Rudy Ray Moore. With that, I would always purchase the 42nd Street Forever comp jobs (exception: the Triple X edition since I never cared for that genre) This edition of 42nd Street Forever consists of the first two editions with a random sampling of at least a dozen or so extras. The commentary on this disc make up for the fact, I'm watching a rehash of parts 1 and 2. Anyway, a good way to spend a dull evening in front of the Blu-Ray player, but where was Charlie and the Hooker? I would have been curious to hear a commentary of that trailer. Can't wait for part 6",1350172800,,689,4.348837209302325
5081073,5,B007FFWJIE,this is simply a great overview of all grind-house cult explotation films from various decades. I was highly entertain watching this for hours over 80 movie trailers for the price of this blu-ray is well worth it. Maybe this could be the best purchase i've made in 2012. 42nd street rocks 4ever.,1349308800,,295,4.6923076923076925
5081074,5,B007FFWJIE,"This Blu-ray combines most of the first two volumes of '42nd Street Forever', with a few deletions and additions.  However, the real selling point, besides the nearly four hour running time, is the audio commentary.  While you circle the globe a couple of times with these trailers, three exploitation experts - Edward Samuelson of AV Maniacs, Micheal Gingold of Fangoria magazine, and Temple of Schlock's Chris Poggiali - go through the endurance test of trying to find something to say for 89 mostly crappy movies.

They succeed, for the most part, due to their immense knowledge of all things sleazy.  Things do flag a bit during the second hour but when the horror section comes up, they rally and sprint to the finish.  As for the trailers themselves, they are the cornball exploitation material, full of boobs and blood, violence and politically incorrect commentary that we all love.  So the commentary gives the disc a reason for repeated spins, since it acts as a virtual encyclopedia of all things exploitation.",1345334400,3,1021,4.976470588235294
5081075,4,B007FFWJIE,"This is a collection of the best of this fine series showcasing the glorious sleaze that was the grindhouse film.  It is a collection of trailers showing the best of the most awful of this gutter trash that is just so much fun to watch when you are in the right mood.  It covers all the genres: Crappy Slasher, Weird Comedy, Outlaw Biker, Teen Rebel, Blaxploitation, Chop Sockey, even more adult entries.  If you want to get a feeling of truly crappy cinema that is absolutely NOT to be missed, the ""so bad it's good"" stuff, this is a perfect introduction to what you can expect.  Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino seem determined to bring this small theater sleaze back with Grindhouse, Machete, Hobo With a Shotgun, Hellride, and other fine pieces of cinematic sludge.  I am not being ironic or hyperbolic in my comments.  I love these movies when I am in a certain mood.  Check out this collection, and you'll laugh, gasp and say to yourself disbelievingly, ""My God, we were louts back then.  I gotta see that!""",1343088000,2,1019,4.622222222222222
5081076,1,B007FFWJIE,"""Exploitation fans"" that care about 1080p and Hi-Def bells and whistles!?!  Gimme a break.  Synapse are the worst offenders.  I'm a fan of this stuff because it looks filthy, not because it's beautiful and pristine... *shakes head and sighs*",1343001600,3,241,5.128205128205129
5081077,4,B007FFWJIE,"For those familiar with Grindhouse movies and/or the 42nd Street Forever series this is a ""must have""!  With almost 4 hrs of the trashiest, funniest and downright coolest movie trailers you may ever see, this is an excellent collection for any fan of exploitation cinema.  And you get to witness all of this debauchery in beautiful blu-ray - pretty sure this is the best these movies have ever looked/sounded.  The only reason I didn't give this disc 5 stars is because it is essentially a collection of the first two 42nd Street Forever DVDs (which I already owned), although a few new trailers like ""Honky"", ""Dr. Butcher, MD"" (LOVE this one!) and John Carpenter's ""Dark Star"" are great additions.  I highly recommend checking out this compilation!",1342915200,,749,4.920634920634921
5081078,5,B007FFWJIE,"Synapse's awesome 42nd Street Forever series finally makes its Blu-ray debut, and we should all be thankful for it.  A best selling and beloved series that collects a smorgasbord of bizarre grindhouse-era movie trailers and presents them in all their nasty glory, the Blu-ray edition of 42nd Street Forever features trailers for a whole mess of horror, science fiction, exploitation, blaxploitation, and other assorted unsavory flavors of trash including The Deadly Spawn, John Carpenter and Dan O'Bannon's Dark Star, David Cronenberg's underrated Rabid, They Call Her One Eye (Thriller: A Cruel Picture), Ms. 45, Sugar Hill, Chained Heat, Flesh Gordon, The Italian Stallion, They Came From Beyond Space, and tons, tons more.  Outrageous, gratuitous, ridiculously over the top, and featuring a bevy of familiar faces peppered throughout a number of the films advertised here (including Tommy Lee Jones, William Devane, Sharon Stone, Ernest Borgnine, Linda Blair, Marilyn Chambers, Sylvester Stallone, Sybil Danning, Kennan Wynn, and lots more) all help make this collection an excellent pick up.  If you already have the DVD's that Synapse released originally, there's no real reason to rush out to pick up this Blu-ray edition, but if you don't have any of the 42nd Street Forever series and any or all of what I said sounds right up your alley, you need to pick this up.",1337990400,8,1372,5.2272727272727275
5081079,5,B007FFWJIE,"Exploitation fans, drive-in buffs, and aficionados of cult and obscure cinema have long regarded Synapse's 42ND STREET FOREVER compilations as some of their favorite video releases. A retrospective of movie trailers culled mostly from the `60s and `70s - some for independent films, some for obscure studio product, and many hugely entertaining - this bestselling series has finally released its first Blu-Ray edition and the results do not disappoint.

If you're a series fan, the content here won't be a total surprise, the bulk of it coming as a mix of trailers previously released on the first two DVD editions. However, a few new surprises have been added in, with of course the enhanced benefit of having 1080p AVC encoded transfers that further transform your home theater set-up into a cavalcade of politically UN-correct gore, sleaze, sex, and comedy.

At nearly four hours and with 89 trailers on-hand, it's difficult to comment on them all, but here are a few of my favorites:

-Raiders of Atlantis: Hilarious ""Road Warrior"" rip-off with one of the all-time funniest decapitation scenes ever - and it's in this trailer! (Incredibly, the film itself just surfaced on DVD, in 16:9 no less, as a part of Mill Creek's 2011 ""Sci-Fi Invasion"" 50-movie bargain pack).

-Skatetown USA: Scott Baio, Epstein from ""Welcome Back Kotter,"" Marcia from ""The Brady Bunch,"" Ruth Buzzi, Flip Wilson and ""introducing"" Patrick Swayze? Someone tell me why this disco-skating flick isn't on DVD!

-The Crippled Masters: A favorite from the earlier compilation, in full scope widescreen.

-Wicked, Wicked: Early `70s MGM B-movie offered the first - and last - usage of ""Duovision,"" a two-camera set-up that failed to sell this bizarre looking camp horror outing.

-Welcome Home, Brother Charles: `70s Black exploitation outing with a particularly memorable trailer.

As with the prior 42nd Street Forever retrospectives, the trailers are grouped together by category, from sleazy soft-core sex flicks to biker pictures, martial arts outings, sci-fi and horror, with the occasional big-studio film worked into the mix (like, say, MGM's hysterical Japanese co-production ""The Green Slime"").

The transfers are all superior to Synapse's admittedly terrific DVD sets (with many in anamorphic widescreen), but are also a mixed lot in terms of their condition, as you'd anticipate from materials that aren't pristine - but that only adds to the disc's inherent nostalgic, and overall entertainment, value. In fact, I've found that playing just a few minutes of these trailers is perfect for certain houseguests and friends you might have over, who are certain to get a kick or two out of them. Commentary by exploitation fan/webzine authorities adds some insight to the fun as well.

Here's hoping Syanpse doesn't wait so long to bring us a second volume!",1337472000,9,2837,5.229074889867841
5081080,5,B007FFWJIE,"Oh man, where to begin. This is one of the most excellent blu ray releases ever, from one of the leading providers of cult film cinema, Synapse Films!

225 mind numbing minutes of trailers, from some of the most insane genre films imaginable. Nothing more, nothing less (well you do get a commentary track with folks from Fangoria and the like, which is pretty entertaining).

A good number of these films I have never even heard of, while other ones I feel I saw the whole movie before the trailer ends! We're talking a good time here folks, moreso if you are a horror, cult, sleaze, action junkie. Perfect for a long night of drinks and hanging out.

Synapse rules.",1336780800,8,667,4.541666666666667
8515684,4,B007FFWJIE,"This is a great collection of trailers. I consider myself fairly knowledgeable about old exploitation films, yet there were still a handful of flicks presented here that I was completely unaware of. The three hours of trailers can also be played with a commentary, so buying this Bluray basically gives you six hours of entertainment. It's a great deal!",1508889600,,353,5.0

8515687,1,B007FFWJIE,"I bought this on a recommendation from a horror podcast based on their claim that it is a great thing to have on in the background of a Halloween party or the like. Fortunately I previewed it. This is at least 80% porn trailers having nothing to do with horror or anything except porn.

Sure, I was misinformed by the podcast, and that's not the product's fault, but even as a stand alone product it is basically unwatchable, in any setting I can think that I would find myself. Call me a prude, but there's nothing for me here.",1428364800,,528,4.333333333333333
8515688,4,B007FFWJIE,"If you're already the proud owner of the first two DVD volumes of Synapse's 42nd Street Forever series -- in which case you probably own all five of them, or six if you count the porn compilation -- you'll need to hang onto them. Despite some claims that this Blu-ray edition combines the contents of those two compilations, it actually drops several trailers from both while adding several more that, as far as I can tell, are not on any of the other four releases in the series so far.

For the record, here are the trailers from the Volume 1 DVD that are NOT on the Blu-ray:

Corruption
The Butcher of Binbrook
Italian Stallion
CreamPuffs
Wicked Wicked
Charlie and the Hooker
Destroy All Monsters
Behind Convent Walls
Confessions of a Summer Camp Counsellor
Death Will Have Your Eyes
Death Has Blue Eyes
A Black Veil for Lisa
Ironmaster
The Rape of the Sabines
The Legend of N****r Charley

And here are the trailers from the Volume 2 DVD that are NOT on the Blu-ray:

Hellcats
Dragstrip Riot
Tick Tick Tick
Take a Hard Ride
Pickup
Female Jungle
Gigantic The Fire Monster
Giant Gila Monster
The Hideous Sun Demon
Monster of Piedras Blancas
Murders in the Rue Morgue
Woman Eater
Texas Chainsaw Massacre
The Clones
Mission Mars
Trunk To Cairo
Amazon's of Rome
Samson and the Slave Queen
Revolt of the Slaves
Revenge of the Gladiators

In exchange, and to ensure that the Blu-ray isn't a straight HD upgrade of Volumes 1 and 2 which then reduces the value of their DVDs, Synapse has added the following trailers to this collection:

Honky
Act of Vengeance
Chained Heat
The Teasers Go To Paris
The Teacher
The Tale of the Dean's Wife
The Minx
The Sun, The Place and the Girls
Fairytales
Flesh Gordon
Dark Star
They Came from Beyond Space
Eye of the Cat
Mark of the Witch
Dr. Butcher M.D.
Dr. Tarr's Torture Dungeon
Pornography in Denmark
Taboos of the World
Salo
Supermanchu
Devil's Angels

So on the whole, this is a fine addition to the 42nd Street Forever series, even though a substantial portion of it is repeat material from the first two DVD volumes. It's not hard to imagine that future Blu editions -- IF we get them at all in this day and age -- will follow a similar pattern of mixing previously released trailers with material not included on prior editions, possibly on any home video label. Gawd knows there's enough of this stuff floating around out there, much of it still unseen since it first unspooled in theatres, and considering how many trailers from the grindhouse/drive-in era oversold the movies they promoted, the 42nd Street collection and its spiritual kin are an affordable way to get a taste of this influential, bygone period of film history. But if you're an existing owner of the DVD sets, be prepared to have some serious overlap in your collection.",1420243200,15,2782,4.653767820773931
8515689,5,B007FFWJIE,"Wonderful collection of exploitation trailers grouped into different subgenres. Put it on, pick a mood and party!! So many films shown need full-fledged releases, specifically THE GREEN SLIME!!!",1393027200,,194,5.964285714285714
8515690,5,B007FFWJIE,"Straight to the point, this is an outstanding collection of beautifully remastered exploitation/horror film trailers. Synapse have collected this ""Best Of"" together and offered up some gorgeous transfers. I'm pretty well-versed in genre cinema and I was shocked to discover a few films on this release that I'd not seen yet! I love it when that happens.

There are a ton of trailer compilations out there but very few have made it to Blu-ray and even fewer have made good use of the technology. Synapse's 42nd STREET FOREVER: THE BLU-RAY EDITION though is exactly what it says and it gives you the very best visual quality for your dollar.

8515691,2,B007FFWJIE,"I received this blu-ray. I should have read things better, because I thought it was a compilation of movies rather than trailers.

8515693,5,B007FFWJIE,"Not all of the coming attractions are interesting, but I had a lot of fun watching this since I have seen most of the films. Not for all tastes, but if you are a fan of horror and ""grindhouse cinema,"" see it.",1358812800,,208,3.9761904761904763
