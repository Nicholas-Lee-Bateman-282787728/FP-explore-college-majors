2554446,4,B000F7MG28,"I thought this DVD was pretty good (I found a new easier way to do a slip knot!) but was annoyed with the instruction on the purl stitch.  The instructor did a good job of explaining what to do with the right needle but then when she got to the left she went a bit faster and I had a heck of a time copying what she had done.  What really bugged me is that she kept chirping ""see how simple it is!"" which made me feel like an idiot because I couldn't get it until I watched it 10+ times.",1206316800,3,487,3.8118811881188117
2554447,2,B000F7MG28,"Someone else pointed out that there were a lot of suspicious 5-star reviews for all the DVDs in this series. Sure enough, if you click on a good number of them, they have only reviewed this series and ohmigosh they just love each and every one of them!! What a pain. There are some authentic reviews of the DVDs, both positive and negative. I checked this DVD out from the library and I would say it's about average. Some good content, some just so so. Definitely one to see if you can get it from your local library first.",1194825600,34,523,4.292929292929293

2554449,5,B000F7MG28,"What else is there to say about The Art of Knitting!?! I love it! This dvd started it all for me. I learned to knit like a pro in no time and even though my knitting dvd library is much bigger now...this is definitely one of the dvd's I use the most. I can't say enough about it, just get it and see for yourself!!!",1161907200,,315,3.8615384615384616
2554450,5,B000F7MG28,"I am an expert knitter/designer and I also teach.  I really expected very little from this DVD.  I got this DVD because I am most comfortable knitting ""continental"" style, and I HOPED to: 1) get a refresher on American style, 2) pick up some alternative beginner techniques, and 3) find alternative/clearer language to improve my teaching.

  I found all this and MORE.  This is a marvelous teaching tool that I would highly recommend to any begginning knitter, and I will recommend it to anyone taking a knitting class to augment the hands on teaching with additional info.

  If hands on teaching is not available, this should do it... going alongside a teacher and a novice knitter - it's a great set up.  For me, the begginning steps got a bit tedious, but I expected that - I would expect it to be very comforting to someone who is new to it, and just the right pace for a begginner.

  My only tiny qualm with this video (if you watch ALL the sections) is a focus in two segments on Buddism.  I expect this from the author of THE ZEN OF KNITTING, but it was repeated in a knitting circle segment that was heavily religious.  This CAN be informative as to how a knitting group can become an affinity group for people of a religion, but... it's off-putting in a begginning knitter class.

  DO watch the extra features, the ones on the making and dying of yarns are so informative, and the artist who talks about color theory has wonderful things to think about that will influence the way you combine color and think about your knitting.

  Simply fantastic.  GET IT, and Get knitting!",1159920000,33,1590,4.544169611307421
2554451,5,B000F7MG28,"The Art of Knitting was great for a beginner knitter like myself.  A few minutes after popping in the DVD I was on my way to knitting my first hat.  The Knitting Library was great for help w/ terms and abbreviations and the jazz selection  to knit by was wonderful.  This DVD is a great introduction to the world of knitting and has a ton of exciting projects for beginner and advanced knitters alike.  If you feel overwhelmed when looking at knit book instructions and illustrations then I would highly reccmmend this DVD because the knitting lessons with Jennifer makes you feel like you have your very own personal instructor.  There's so much on this DVD you just have to see it for yourself, I know you'll love it too! I can easily see why this is the #1 knitting DVD on the market. Go and buy it!",1158883200,12,802,4.385135135135135
2554452,5,B000F7MG28,I reviewed this DVD before n Amazon maybe therre's 2 versions. This is the one to buy. It's great!,1149206400,6,98,4.2105263157894735

8118642,5,B000F7MG28,This is one of the best knitting videos I have seen.  The section making socks is going to teach me how to make socks!,1470268800,,118,3.9166666666666665
8118643,3,B000F7MG28,"This DVD has some good tips, but it's very hard to find a particular topic as you cannot just click on a certain chapter, but have to go through the whole thing.  It also contains two totally worthless sections: one on knitting or crocheting bikinis, and one on making wire jewelry.  It' s okay for what I paid (very little) but due to the fact that I can't look up specific chapters, I haven't even had the time to watch it all the way through.",1411689600,,445,4.223529411764706
8118644,5,B000F7MG28,It gave me some very helpful tips on knitting and I just love knitting because it's fun and very relaxing.,1386979200,,106,4.35
8118645,5,B000F7MG28,"I am a beginner knitter and this video is a must have!  I have other knitting videos that I bought at the same time, but this one is my favorite and I go to it many times when I need help figuring out how to do something.  Would highly recommend this video!  If you can only purchase one video to learn to knit, I would suggest you get this one. I knew absolutely nothing about knitting before purchasing the videos and so far have had all my questions answered mostly by this video.  I have made some dishcloths, a potholder, a head band and am working on a poncho.  I am loving it!",1374969600,,583,4.123893805309734
8118646,3,B000F7MG28,"The 'getting started' section that covers casting on and knit and purl seemed amateurish in quality. The lighting is not very good, the camera shakes and moves way too much and the sound is horrible. I wanted more focus on the teacher and how she could do it correctly. The novice knitter was good to include as she was making some of the same errors as a lot of other beginner knitters so we could see what the teacher said about those errors, but at times, I found her giggling and ad libbing to be distracting and annoying. Its a knitting video, not a dating show. There was not enough focus or close ups on the teacher who was very good with her explanations and demonstrations. I don't watch a how to video to see another beginner. I want to see the teacher.

The segment on continental vs english knitting was much better quality in video/sound recording as well as content. I just wish it was longer.

There is a lot of other content that is interesting to watch but as a how to video for a true beginner, I found it lacking in more instructional content and would choose another DVD over this one.",1307145600,,1105,4.385365853658537
8118647,5,B000F7MG28,"I purchased this DVD because I thought I might see what I already knew from a different angle. I had no idea how packed with information and ideas ""Art of Knitting"" is.

The first five minutes paid for the effort. And I had no idea that it would go on for hours and hours. You need to have plenty of coffee ready and forget about doing anything else the day you start to watch this DVD.

It is organized like an animated magazine with articles and sub-articles to those. Each is well titled and gives further reading or viewing references. Like a magazine not everyone will be interested in every section; yet you can always find something and much is serendipity.

Not everything is physically knitting yet they go through all types of knitting forms. There is a quick section on the difference in holding thread as in American vs. Continental. If you ever watch any Agatha Christy miss Marple movies with Joan Hickson then you get a good dose of Continental or European knitting methods.

Everyone knows that the process of knitting is just mechanical; you can do most while watching TV or holding a conversation. But what to knit, what looks good, and what works well as clothing, accessories or art is another matter. We even get a crash course in color psychology.

If I covered everything on this DVD it would take a book. And this is just one of a series.

It is safe to say this is one of the best investments you could make.

8118648,5,B000F7MG28,"I am delighted to find in this DVD that it teaches both American and European style of knitting.  As you progress in this art it is very useful to be competent in both!  A DVD is such a great way to learn how to knit!  The close up views of what goes where, and when, are so very helpful - the only thing left to conquer is holding the thread to achieve a desirable tension, and that is very particular to each person.  I highly recommend this DVD and have watched mine several times already!",1240099200,,492,4.147368421052631
8118649,4,B000F7MG28,The DVD is a clear instructional for beginners in knitting. It provides the basics as well as information on designer styling. I am a self-taught knitter and I learned a few new tips.  I would have liked more details on yarn selection.  This is a good buy for someone who is still learning how to knit.,1238371200,3,302,4.375
8118650,4,B000F7MG28,"I am a beginning knitter and I picked this DVD up from the library to help me with the visual aspects of more advanced stitches so that I could move beyond scarves.  This is a very comprehensive DVD which starts in section 1 with the basics of casting on, the knit stitch and the purl stitch.  The DVD then moves on to consider common knitting abbreviations and the other stitches I was looking for.  To me, as a beginnig knitter, the only downside to this DVD IS the beginning section.  The instructor first teaches ""casting on"" using what I consider the most complicated method of casting on.  Trying to watch a DVD on the TV while doing it up close with your own knitting needles, her explanations are confusing.  I would have stopped there if I hadn't known how to do this already.  She goes on later to cast-on using the easier method, but I'm not sure why she didn't intro this one first.  Again, the only downside to this DVD is the first section, but this is a critical section for a true beginner.  The instructor is unclear, and her ""student"" keeps pointing out how she's not sure what's she's doing, and as they work through it, the camera seems to focus more on them than it does on the stitching.  Having said this, the rest of the DVD is better.  The 2nd instructor goes through knit/purl again using both American style knitting and continental knitting (she's clearer in 2 minutes than the whole first seciton), then goes on to describes increasing/decreasing stitches with much clearer pictures.  Also helpful: 1) a great description of the different types of yarn and how to use them for summer vs winter weight garments, and how to care for these garments, 2) a chiropractor who outlines proper body mechanics/stretching to prevent knitting related shoulder pain/carpal tunnel, 3) color value to aid with putting projects together, 4) index of knitting abbreviations, 4) a link to local knitting shops by state.",1234915200,10,1930,4.711309523809524
