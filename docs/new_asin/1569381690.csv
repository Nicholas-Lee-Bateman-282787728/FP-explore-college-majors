8216129,4,1569381690,"One of the most beautiful passenger routes in North America is Amtrak's Adirondack between New York City NY and Montral, Quebec.  The line follows a north-south alignment through eastern New York state, following the Hudson Valley, penetrating the Adirondack Mountains, and skirting the west edge of Lake Champlain.  This show, narrated by actor James Coburn, begins with a montage of film scenes followed by the series' introduction featuring computer- animated train.  A map is used to trace the route of the train.  In addition to typical lineside and on-board views, there are some nice aerial shots.
The journey begins at Penn Station in New York City with views of the lobby and office.  Amtrak conductor Rick Palmer talks about his job, greets passengers (some of whom he knows personally) and collects tickets.  Northbound train #69 leaves the station with Genesis unit 702 in charge, passing under a high bridge over the Hudson River.  Riverkeeper John Cronin patrols the river, and we get to see what it looks like from his boat.  Conductor Rick answers a question about the ruins of the castle on the Bannerman estate.
First stop is Tarrytown, location of Sunnyside, the estate of famous author Washington Irving who rote ""The Legend of Sleepy Hollow"" and other stories.  The story is told of how Irving resisted the New York & Hudson River Railroad laying tracks past his residence, but finally gave in for a sum of money and became a regular rail passenger.  Other estates include Lyndhurst; Phillipsburg Manor; and Kykuit, owned by the Rockefeller family, where many art sculptures were collected and are still on display.
Science teacher Michael Rourke, riding on the train, explains the history of the Roosevelt and Vanderbilt estates in Hyde Park, and how the local train station was saved, while several photos and a film clip of Franklin Roosevelt's funeral are displayed.
Another fine estate is Montgomery Place in Annandale -on- Hudson.  A docent leads visitors on a summer evening tour through the lovely gardens.
After a stop at an unnamed station, #69 continues north with conductor Craig Allen and stops in Saratoga Springs.  Crystal Baker owns Hattie's Restaurant, and she talks about how much she enjoys riding the train.  After she detrains, she takes us for a look inside the restaurant, shows how it operates, and discusses its background.  Saratoga Springs was named after its carbonated mineral springs, around which were built several resorts.  Horse racing is big here, and some race scenes are provided.  Actor David Hyde-Pierce, who grew up in the area, shows us the Batchelor Mansion and other buildings and discusses local events.
Heading out again, the route cuts through the eastern edge of Adirondack Park, the largest state park in the U.S.  A photographer talks about the park over a series of his photos.  Colorful hot-air balloons are launched at a balloon festival in Glenns Falls.  Next, the line passes Fort Ticonderoga on Lake Champlain, and we get a brief tour of the fort with its stone fortifications and cannons, as well as some of its history dating back to its founding by French colonists in 1755.
Conductor Craig talks about the area and the train's crew as Lake Champlain dominates the landscape on the east side of the tracks.  In Port Henry, a lifelong resident talks about sightings of a Loch Ness- like creature nicknamed ""Champ""; there's even a photo showing some sort of animal with a small head and long neck poking out of the water.  From Westport, a side trip is made to the town of Lake Placid, situated on Mirror Lake.  A number of private camps for the wealthy were built around Upper Saranac Lake, and Charlie Ritchie was fortunate enough to have inherited his family's camp.  We see a number of photos of camp life in the early 1900s; many of these camps are now private resorts.  One such camp is The Wawbeek, a very rustic and beautiful place.  Saranac Lake itself is like a wilderness paradise.
Another side trip is made to the AuSable River which has carved a narrow but deep gorge (the AuSable Chasm) through solid
shale and sandstone, and there are waterfalls and other intriguing rock formations in the area.  Boat tours may be taken
through the chasm.  The tracks leave Lake Champlain and cut through forests before entering crop fields of the Saint Lawrence Valley, crossing a high bridge over the Saint Lawrence River, and entering Montral, Canada's largest city.  Only fleeting glimpses of picturesque buildings in Montral are shown before the show concludes with a reprise of some previous scenes.
-----
This show was done in travelogue style and is not your typical hardcore railfan video.  There are some shots looking out the locomotive's windshield, the window of the rear coach, and side windows, as well as a couple from the nose of the locomotive as the train races along. All of the filming was done in summer and early autumn with healthy does of colorful fall foliage.  Skies are mostly sunny but the area's beauty is not lost even on overcast days.  Eastern New York state is rich in not only natural beauty but also history; it's not a wonder that so many rich families built estates in this area. ""ASRJ - The Adirondack"" makes a nice keepsake for anyone who has ridden the Adirondack train or would like to get to know the region or plan a vacation there.
