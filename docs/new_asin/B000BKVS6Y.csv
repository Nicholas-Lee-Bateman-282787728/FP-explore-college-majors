8088489,3,B000BKVS6Y,"Only so-so story.  A Spanish-language (no-subtitles), Spanish-Mexican made Santo flick.  This time he goes against jewel thieves who have stolen a fabulous gem.  Not as fun as when our masked hero battles monsters.  I bought the Rebel Crew Films DVD (not pictured here) release and the quality is only fair and the picture is not clear.  Recommended for die-hard Santo fans only.",1420502400,,379,5.048387096774194
