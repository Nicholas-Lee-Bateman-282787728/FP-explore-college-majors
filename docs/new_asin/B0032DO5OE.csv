4055866,4,B0032DO5OE,"The problems of the world can seem so vast and insurmountable at times that our natural inclination may be to simply throw up our hands in despair and determine that nothing can be done to rectify the situation.  This is exactly how professional photographer and filmmaker Tuck Pipkin (""Nobelity"") used to feel, until he realized that if he simply broke down the problems into smaller, more manageable units, he - or anyone else, for that matter - could actually make a difference.

The documentary that he narrates, ""One Peace at a Time"" - which describes itself as a ""movie about a messed-up world and how we can fix it"" - attempts to show how millions of individuals, working separately or together on a smaller scale, can, when taken in the aggregate, have a profound effect on the world at large.  Pipkin travels the globe in search of individuals and organizations that have found successful ways of coping with problems.  He takes us to an orphanage in India, a family-planning program in Thailand, a water project in Ethiopia, an AIDS-treatment program in Sub-Saharan Africa, a model school in India, an innovative loan program in Bagladesh, a medical center in Napal, a community center in Nairobi.  And that's just scratching the surface.

Pipkin and the filmmakers posit that every person in the world has the right to clean water, adequate nutrition, health care, education, and a safe and nurturing environment.  It is this simple and basic philosophy that informs both the movie and the actions each of these individuals is taking to make life better for those less fortunate.  Pipkin interviews many of the movers, shakers and thinkers on the issue, some well known, some known only to the members of their own communities.  Heck, at one point, even Willie Nelson moseys on by for a sit-down with Pipkin to discuss how we can all learn to live in greater harmony with the environment and each other, all based on the choices we make.

Beyond making us all feel better about the world and its prospects for the future, the movie's main goal is to inspire its audience to take an active role in making that world a better place.  ""One Peace at a Time"" is no great shakes as a movie per se, and it does have the air of a glorified public service announcement about it at times, but if it motivates us to get up off the couch and actually DO something for others, it will have fulfilled its purpose.",1285200000,,2410,4.7007125890736345
4055867,4,B0032DO5OE,"I feel lucky that I had the chance to see this film.

Early in the film the 6 human rights of children were listed:
1. the right to clean water
2. the right to adequate nutrition
3. the right to health care
4. the right to an education
5. the right to a stable loving environment
6. the right to live in conditions of freedom and dignity

Then the question was asked about each right: ""Why and where is this right violated and what are the solutions?""  This provides the organizing framework for the rest of the film.  We start by going to places with inadequate water supplies.  We get to visit with the women and girls who spend hours every day carrying water.  Then we get to see how the problem of clean water distribution is being addressed.  Next we go to places with inadequate food supplies and learn about the causes and solutions to hunger.

The only reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5 is because the producer didn't bother to provide English subtitles.  Sure everybody spoke English, but I had to watch the film 3 times to catch everything.  It also tended to ramble a bit, spending way too much time playing chess with Willie Nelson for example. But I'm thankful that I had the chance to see the world as one family with quantifiable problems and quantifiable solutions.",1275091200,4,1285,4.452991452991453
4055868,5,B0032DO5OE,"Turk and his family are truly making each day count, and this film shows that you don't have to be Bill Gates to make important, life saving change or to increase the economic viability of a community by supporting a few special organizations that provide children and communities with basic rights--clean water, nutrition, education, to name a few.  We don't have a lot, but now we are supporting a group home in India via Austin's own Miracle Foundation for the cost of a good haircut and color each month.  We are addicted to Kiva and all our $25.00 loans have paid back or are current.  Watch the film and find your passion as Turk and his family have found theirs.",1270598400,8,669,4.558333333333334
4055869,5,B0032DO5OE,"""One Peace at a Time"" is a follow-up of Turk Pipkin's movie ""The Nobelity Project,"" in which he interviewed Nobel Prize laureates all over the world about the major problems facing the Earth and humanity.  In ""One Peace"" he highlights people and organizations that are doing something about these problems--nonprofits like The Miracle Foundation and A Glimmer of Hope, people like Willie Nelson.  Each segment tells a story, and while the movie covers some very serious topics, at the end the viewer is left feeling hopeful and inspired and ready to go out and do something good in the world themselves.  It's appropriate for children - even my 8 year old daughter got something out of it.  We saw it last Summer and she still talks about it a year later.",1270598400,6,755,4.740458015267175

8387436,4,B0032DO5OE,"This film seems to be a sequel to the documentary ""Nobelity.""  In the first film one sees a wide range of authors, scientists and Nobel Prize winners.  It tended to cover both abstract topics (ex. climate, physics, energy) and practical solutions.  Here, in the second film, the focus is nearly all on the practical, small scale or local solutions.

That shift in focus provides some good ideas but is also inherently limited.  For example, high school graduates featured in this film need reliable power grids to support their future jobs.  As some other films have shown, India and countries like it have power grids that are overly reliant on coal and have interruptions in power.  There are even places in Brazil and India where people routinely hook up wires to power lines.  ""One Peace at a Time"" is thus provides only small fraction of solutions needed to achieve the UN's Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).  State level solutions, done well, will be more effective than local ones.",1418342400,,991,4.921686746987952

I've watched many audiences, young, old, and in-between, walk out of showings both inspired and a little awe-struck.

8387441,3,B0032DO5OE,"A man with the irresistible name of ""Turk Pipkin"" went to a variety of locations in developing nations, and reported on Nobel-prize-winning efforts to bring a better standard of living to the peoples there. This DVD is a record of his journey.

Unfortunately, while the writer/producer's name might be irresistible, this DVD is not. The featured aid projects are by-and-large retreads of the same old missionary-type projects that have failed to make any lasting improvements for decades and even centuries.

There are a few exceptions. For example, the KIVA project reported on here organizes small individual loans to people (mostly women) so that they can launch cottage industries that will boost them and their villages out of poverty. This novel venture of ""micro-financing"" shows some real potential for making lasting change.

For the most part though, the emphasis of most of these projects is more than ever on delivering some service to the struggling peoples, especially to the children. The projects are geared to supplying the United Nations Rights of the Child - which specify such commodities as ""clean water, education, and health care."" The problem is that these needs have indeed been firmly conceptualized as commodities - as nouns. I wish the reformers would take a page out of the writings of Ivan Illich and see their way to turning some of these nouns into verbs. Instead of delivering ""education, health care, and shelter,"" I wish the reformers might think in terms of enabling ""learning, healing, and building."" Such a shift in emphasis would open the door to some truly innovative ways of combating global poverty and oppression.

I also find myself wishing that some of the activists at work here might have read some of Jane Jacobs' books before once again trying to achieve any lasting improvements by simply digging wells or building shelter compounds. Jacobs outlines what is necessary for any such technological improvements to be sustainable and to ramify into more lasting economic advancement for developing countries as a whole.

So watching this DVD can be sort of a frustrating exercise in ""same old, same old."" Unless you contribute to or are otherwise involved with any of the highlighted projects, such as Glimmer of Hope (which helps build schools and clinics) or Miracle Foundation (which sponsors orphanages), and want to get a first-hand view of their on-going activities - you probably won't find this documentary very compelling. Also, the music that its jacket promises - contributed by stars such as Bob Dylan, Cat Stevens, and Willie Nelson - is too incidental to be a reason to buy this DVD.

However I still have to give the film 3 stars for the aura of hopefulness it generates, for its generous spirit, and for the wonderful, vivid portraits it provides of people. Pipkin's camera pans over a gamut of faces - some worn and world-weary - many shining with the sheer joy of being alive, even under very difficult circumstances. This gallery of beautiful faces from around-the-world provided the main rhyme and reason of the film for me.",1295913600,3,3090,5.049019607843137
