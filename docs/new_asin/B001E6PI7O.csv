8296917,5,B001E6PI7O,"Let me explain about how I came to love a short film from the 1970s titled Winter of the Witch:

Before the internet, before the overhead projector, even before the now-nearly-defunct VCRs, the public school system's brilliant idea of combining education with entertainment consisted of filmstrips (that beeped when each frame advanced, thanks to a cassette recorder embedded in the contraption) and the 16mm film projector. And nowhere were these wonders of technology more frequently put to use than my favorite class of the week--LIBRARY TIME!

As a elementary school student (int he late 70s and early 80s), I remember that we always got a treat of a short movie (though without the joys of popcorn and a cold refreshment) before we got to select our books from the library shelves (shelves that I vividly remember were even shorter than us students. And every year in every grade at around Halloween time (which, even in adulthood, remains my very favorite time of the year) we would watch this movie about a witch who lived in an attic that made magical pancakes that made people see colored spots and make them happy--only in my late teens did I remember the title of the film as Winter of the Witch. And I looked forward to this movie every year (sometimes they showed it twice during Library Time in October).

Cut to my late teens. My brother and I taped four large white poster boards together and borrowed a film projector 16mm films from the public library watch classic flicks on the big screen in our homemade home theater. Practicality every weekend for about a year, my brother and I made this a weekly ritual. And on this homemade big screen, we watched Annie Hall, Casablanca, West Side Story...and Winter of the Witch, which our library had (a pristine 16mm copy, by the way) in their collection.

But aside from avid film collectors, 16mm films and the soothing sound of the running projector have vanished...and so had Winter of the Witch, or so I thought.

The film was released in a VHS format to schools as well but, regardless of the hours and hours spend on the internet, my brother and I were unable to secure a copy.

NOW FINALLY it's been OFFICIALLY been released on DVD!

And watching Winter of the Witch as an adult, I can fully appreciate the LSD overtones I missed as an innocent child.

The first shot of the film is a really hideous looking painting being removed from a wall by a Barbara Parkins knock-off. According to the narrator, she and her son (the film never mentions what happened to the husband/father) are leaving the hustle and bustle of the city for the country. By sheer luck, they manage to purchase a huge estate for $400. However, what the real estate dealer doesn't tell them is that the house is haunted.

But they fund out soon enough. A 300 year-old red-headed witch (played by the stage and screen legend Hermione Gingold) insists that the house is hers. The mother compromises and agrees to let the witch stay in the attic, where she listens to the ""I'm Unhappy, You're Unhappy"" song over and over and over again on her Victrola.

Soon enough, the boy and the witch become fast friends. He learns that the witch, who used to be a cook for the group of witches that used to occupy his new house, is unhappy because she feels so useless in the ""modern"" world, which is so scary as it is that it doesn't need witches. Suddenly, it dawns on her that what the world needs is blueberry ""happiness"" pancakes. So in her big, black pot, she mixes up a batch of pancakes. After seeing LSD-esque spots, anyone who eats the pancakes becomes obscenely happy. The mother decides to open a ""pancake parlor"" in her redecorated house and make the world happy...one pancake at a time. And in the end, the witch is the happiest of all--because now that's everyone's happy, she can start scaring them again.

Now this may sound simple and stupid but, as a sex-year old, this film was Citizen Kane to me. And, to this day, Winter of the Witch remains one of my favorite films of all time.

The print on this DVD hasn't been remastered, and $60 can be viewed as a steep price, but you can't put a pricetag on your favorite childhood memories, can you?

Thanks for finally releasing this on DVD!",1252454400,27,4231,4.610372340425532
