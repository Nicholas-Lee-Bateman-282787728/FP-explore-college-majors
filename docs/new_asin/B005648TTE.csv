4586197,5,B005648TTE,This movie was very well written. It was not your typical bachelor party movie. I found it to be surprisingly very funny. Great job to the cast and crew!,1309219200,,153,4.310344827586207
4586198,4,B005648TTE,"David Branin's ""Night Before the Wedding"" is a dark but moving immersion into what should be the most celebrated night ever for a group of men bonded since childhood. Bronco, played by a brooding and ever-convincing Gregor Collins, takes the lead in planning an epic bachelor party at a rented house for the most idealistic and seemingly responsible of the friends, Will, who had wisely planned to merely make an appearance, and then retreat back to safe refuge in his own quarters for a restful, harmless night alone before marrying his best friend and love of his life, Beth, the next day. But after Bronco and the gang lay on the guilt trip, Will agrees to let his buddies entertain him, gambling that his good judgement will sustain him through the night. By morning, not only are the friendships in jeopardy, but so is Will's future...",1309132800,,840,4.760273972602739
4586199,5,B005648TTE,Elated to finally see this released on DVD.  I saw this movie at a screening and was blown away!  Gregor Collins is a commanding presence and a force to be reckoned with.,1308960000,,170,4.28125
4586200,5,B005648TTE,"David Branin's ""Night Before the Wedding"" delivers...almost too much! If you've ever wanted to peek into a man's mind to see what really goes on during the infamous ""Bachelor Party"", then this a must-see film for you. Gregor Collins brings his usual A-Game - so much that I caught myself cringing, thinking that I was actually going to be in trouble with the little woman after watching this. Night Before the Wedding has a-lot-a bit of everything from Drama to Comedy. It tugs at every human emotion. Definitely recommended.",1308960000,,525,4.910112359550562
4586201,5,B005648TTE,"This movie is excellent! The cast is very talented, I'm sure we'll see some of these guys in Hollywood soon. The director is obviously a professional. Actually, these guys are 100% dedicated to their film careers and it shows. The movie itself isn't a ""Hangover"" so don't expect a wild un-realistic story. Rather, the plot is as close as it gets to the reality of a ""Night Before the Wedding"" that will put its characters at risk of loosing it all (including of course, the groom's marriage) over the obsession of a full-production bachelor party. The twisted ending will send chills down to the spine of any man that has been or will ever attend such a gathering. While throughout the movie, we found some funny material.  A MUST SEE for any male, and any adventurous female that dares to wonder into the realities of this man-ritual. PLUS, you are supporting independent artists as they fulfill their dreams; and ours...",1308873600,,922,4.7625
4586202,4,B005648TTE,"NIGHT BEFORE THE WEDDING is a terrific blend of comedy and drama. Actually, the word ""drama"" may do this film a disservice. David Branin's cautionary tale about one raucous night and a single decision that could forever alter the life of a mild-mannered groom-to-be borderlines on the tragic towards the final minutes of the film. Oh, it's got its fill of laughs, eye candy, and even a bit of bromance we've come to expect in most male-driven movies today, but NIGHT BEFORE THE WEDDING also manages to touch us on a much deeper level--a basic, human level, one which most other comedies and dramas can only dream of reaching.",1308873600,,625,4.743119266055046
4586203,5,B005648TTE,"I'm a fan of Indy films and have seen a bunch of movies over the years.  This one really was satisfying and delivers. It had solid production value, solid story and the standout performance from Gregor Collins made this film work. I'm about to buy it, so should you!",1308873600,,266,4.428571428571429
4586204,4,B005648TTE,"This is definitely a tough movie to watch if you have someone special in your life.

To be specific, the ladies might actually like this movie more than the men.

I'd maybe call it a Comedy/Horror.

There are stand out performances by William Shay and Gregor Collins, among many, many others.

Ultimately, I think this movie is worth buying because of the great casting and obvious thought put into the production.

I will honestly say that it was intense and something no modern movie studio would ever make.

That said, I did laugh, but I was appreciative of the brains ultimately behind it all.

I give it a 4 out of 5 for some shaky acting at the beginning, maybe some camera values that I didn't really notice after first 20 minutes,but really I'm glad I got to see this movie.",1308787200,,782,4.50354609929078
4586205,5,B005648TTE,"I thought this movie was a very good independent film. The movie was tense and dramatic, with some lighter moments, as you would expect from a bunch of guys at a bachelor party. The dramatic moments in this film had a way of building up until just when you thought it was going to go too far over the edge, it would ease into a believable, real-life resolution. John Keating did a masterful job as the conflicted good-guy groom-to-be Will; you cared about him because you could relate to him and his dilemma. His acting rings true: Will's good intentions are clear, and his pain as a result of poor decisions is palpable. Gregor Collins inhabits the dark character Bronco, a friend who wants to be in control of everything and everyone and who clearly is suffering from a tragic event in his past he couldn't control. The movie is well-made and well-acted with a thought-provoking ending that will make this film stay with you for a while!",1325203200,,939,4.595238095238095
4586206,3,B005648TTE,"An intriguing premise with colorful characters, NIGHT BEFORE THE WEDDING delivers! John Keating as Will is particularly great, as the groom-to-be with a particularly difficult decision to make.",1323648000,,193,5.928571428571429
4586207,4,B005648TTE,"A bachelor party gone wrong--or did it? Tight childhood friends gather to give a good send off to a buddy, Will to marriage and adulthood. Feeling as though watching a teeny-bopper movie about men who never grow up, the movie takes a dramatic turn when the groom finally turns up. Will doesn't understand his buddies anymore. the party then becomes a humorous, and confusing conflict between friends toward the transition to manhood.

Although a slow start, the writer brought out real issues that individuals go through stages of life. Will's performance, from deep within his soul, brought the movie together.

Sram",1322006400,,617,5.099009900990099
4586208,5,B005648TTE,"Great acting, well written, not really about bachelor parties but more about the dynamics of male relationships in a group setting.  From my own personal experience, I could definitely relate to the ebb and flow of the interactions between the characters.  The primary ""dark side"" character, portrayed by Gregor Collins, effectively sets the stage for the powerful conflicts that the group confronts.  Equally effective was the ""good guy"" character, portrayed by John Keating.  As the movie progresses, Keating paints a vivid picture of a man of high values who slowly (and tragically) crumbles under the pressures that continue to build.  His performance draws the audience into the movie, as you root for his character to defend his moral standards. Extremely well done, this movie will stay with you for a long time.",1321315200,,819,5.174242424242424
4586209,5,B005648TTE,"I was pleasantly surprised by this film. It was tightly scripted and director David Branin kept the focus on the character-driven story from beginning to end. It's a small film whose ambitions never exceed its reach. The movie centers on a group of friends who get together for a bachelor party. But it isn't the typical sex-drugs-rocknroll ""bachelor party"" movie. This one is more of a drama where the underlying tensions of a group of old friends come to boil at the party. It's this fascinating character dynamic which propels the narrative. If you're looking for another Hangover, look elsewhere. But if you want a nice break from the manufactured swill that Hollywood pumps out on a regular basis, you can't go wrong here.",1320278400,,727,4.870967741935484
4586210,5,B005648TTE,"Night before the wedding hits all the spots of comedy, drama, suspense, action, and a little extra ""something."" Good for an Independent and a must buy!",1319760000,,151,4.846153846153846
4586211,3,B005648TTE,"I have to say...there always seems to be the same issue with men and marriage, that marriage equals a loss of freedom, but William isn't one of them. The Night Before the Wedding is a great fly-on-the-wall perspective of every man's dilemma. I am definitely rooting William in his journey to make the right decision, but what is that really?",1319328000,,341,4.7
4586212,3,B005648TTE,"The actors bring life to this new take on an old ritual.  Despite some convoluted plot points, the performances are never anything but genuine and passionate.
The two actors who had the most difficult work in the cast - those who played the ""good guys,"" or morally upstanding men - were particularly compelling.  Kevin Deen as the virgin with principles, made moral indignation sexy.  And John Keating, as the groom-to-be, gave us a wonderfully complex portrayal of a man who is deeply in love, knows who he is, and believes in walking his talk.  His fall at the end of the movie is handled deftly, and the emotional ruin in which he finds himself leaves us deeply concerned for his safety of body and mind.  A complex and heartfelt performance.",1316908800,,745,4.7
4586213,3,B005648TTE,"Though this is not my style of film, it did a great job of creating the characters and leaving the viewer wondering what would happen next.  It held my attention throughout.  Very interesting movie.",1316217600,,198,4.794117647058823
4586214,4,B005648TTE,Acting was great.  The character of Will was portrayed perfectly.  Shows how one person's behavior can affect so many other people's behavior.,1315872000,,142,5.409090909090909
4586215,5,B005648TTE,"This director/writer really knows how to tell a story in a way that captivates...no big budget. No fancy SFX. No big name celebrities...just raw talent. I was especially impressed with John Keating as well as the actor who played ""Bronco""...I look forward to watching these careers....",1313107200,,285,5.217391304347826
4586216,4,B005648TTE,"At first I thought that this would be yet another comedy surrounding a bachelor party.  I was very pleasantly surprised that this drama explored more the characters of the usual cast of suspects.

More than that, I never knew which direction this thing was going to take.  It had that uneasy feel of not knowing whether things would turn bad, funny or just whatever, that you get in a group of drunken friends of varying emotional stability.  What I relief from the canned script approach.  I would recommend the movie for that alone.

Watch it.  It's a good evenings entertainment.",1312761600,,582,4.76
4586217,4,B005648TTE,"I found the Night Before the Wedding to be funny and entertaining with interesting character development, insightful themes, and a stellar performance by the lead, Gregor Collins.

Despite a large cast of party-goers, Director David Branin develops multiple characters with different personalities and ethical views on marriage.  The energy of the party-goers and the sexy porn stars make for exciting scenes.

Branin develops an interesting moral theme with the main character, Bronco, portrayed by Collins.  Bronco harbors painful feelings about marriage and uses his friend's bachelor party to work through them.  Collins' outstanding acting makes it clear that he is approaching the party on a deeper level and that the film is leading us to a moral insight.  The complex character development by Collins allows us to reflect on what marriage should mean and how the world of reality and temptation can affect our view.",1310947200,,923,5.3310344827586205
4586218,5,B005648TTE,"Don't watch NBTW expecting to see ""The Hangover."" While it does have some requisite bachelor party moments--the drinking, the drugs, the strippers, the tying the bride's cousin up in the garage--it offers so much more for the discerning viewer, who is after a little truth. A very well played moral drama that speaks to something all of us guys feel, but rarely let on about. This film is a perfect example of what an independent filmmaker focuses on when making a movie vs. what a studio focuses on.  If you like that honest, truthful perspective, than this film is for you!",1310515200,,575,4.693069306930693
4586219,5,B005648TTE,"Night Before the Wedding is exactly what you would hope from an Indie film - great story, humor, and a cast that is surprisingly talented.  Gregor is a standout!",1309910400,,161,4.551724137931035
4586220,5,B005648TTE,"This movie was a great buy!  The writing was fantastic, sparing viewers the typical predictable lines and platitudes that we always see in a film about a bachelor party.  This film was very realistic, and while the idea of debauchery at a bachelor party is indeed nothing new, this film instead captured the essence of what most such parties are really like . . . (Okay, so one or two twists were not typical, but by and large, this film showed what most of our parties are like, though we deny it all later!)

The other part of the film I enjoyed was that its character development was equally unpredictable!  Just when I thought a particular person was about to become the focus of the movie, a new twist took off, leaving me wondering where the film was heading.  There are more than a few surprises in this flick!  Watch it through to the very end . . . You'll want more.",1309824000,,875,4.37037037037037
4586221,5,B005648TTE,"Like someone mentioned, it is not your typical bachelor film.  Intriguing and engaging character study.  Loved the ending.",1309305600,,122,5.722222222222222
4586222,4,B005648TTE,"Night before the Wedding is a good indie comedy, with strong performances by a talented cast of actors. This a top notch production for an indie film.  Believable characters and realistic situations, add another layer and give the film more character depth and emotion then you would expect to find in a comedy.",1309305600,,311,4.867924528301887
4586223,4,B005648TTE,"Enjoyed this film! The acting was superb, and the rawness of men at bachelor parties was well-developed with lots of surprises. It also explored the challenges to friendships among men when they enter into marriage.",1309219200,,215,5.171428571428572
4586224,4,B005648TTE,"Night Before the Wedding was an interesting foray into the male psyche at a bachelor party. Kudos to director David Branin, who delivered a story centered around more than just the strippers...and still left me wanting more!",1309219200,,224,5.081081081081081
8459186,2,B005648TTE,"Wow a lot of fluffing here on these reviews. If you watch the film it's screamingly clear the filmmakers have recruited everybody and their uncle to write a positive review of this film. It had a nice performance by lead John Keating but most of the other performances were pretty awful (like Kevin Dean). The ol cast all my pals type deal. Gregor Collins wasn't bad but he too tried to bum rush the show and steal the film when it really wasn't his to steal. The script needed way more work, but not bad for a debut. THeir other film Goodbye Promise is way better!",1519776000,,565,4.339622641509434
8459187,1,B005648TTE,This movie had the worst acting and plot! All of the actors talked at the same time and they stay in the same room. I would not recommend this at all.,1452902400,,150,3.870967741935484
8459188,4,B005648TTE,"NIGHT BEFORE THE WEDDING was both enjoyable and a wonderful surprise for an independent feature film debut. The story centers on a common subject of the bachelor party gone awry. However, the filmmakers did not take the easy way out, which is quite refreshing, and makes the film special. Unlike some lowbrow comedies of late, NBTW has highly entertaining characters with multi-faceted relationships, which are allowed to unfold with unexpected results. The ensemble cast was solid especially Gregor Collins and John Keating, who really deliver the goods in this rich story about true friendships among lives in transition.",1343001600,,623,5.36734693877551
8459189,5,B005648TTE,"Dave Brainin's ""Night Before the Wedding."" [...] Finally caught up with this former co worker and ""fantasy football"" buddies film (sorry for the delay Dave) and was pleasantly surprised!
This is a low budget independent film that deals with a bachelor party of a seemingly normal, straight laced guy the night before he ""ties the knot"" and how things slowly but surely escalate out of control. There is drinking, drugs and debauchery to be sure, BUT don't go in expecting ""The Hangover"". This is a smartly observed character piece that isn't going for the easy laughs you tend to associate with the bachelor/ bachelorette ""T&A- fests"", while still managing to avoid the stuffy, preachy pretension that plague smaller indies whose aim is too deconstruct those films. Its a film that focuses on what goes into a man's ""last night of Freedom"" and how he's expected to behave by not only his bride to be, but his family, friends, society (even the ""paid help"") and how his choices can affect those relationships for the rest of his life.
I know what that last sentence sounds like, but fear not friends! Its not a ""snoozer"". The film manages to have some genuinely funny moments that arise organically and is well balanced with the more dramatic moments, making the 97 minute run time go by quickly. The cast is solid throughout and the direction is assured without drawing attention to itself.

If you like true ""indie films"" that aim to observe a situation plainly without too much over-stylization and strong character work then I highly recommend this film.

Note to ""film buffs""...Brainan has an ""eye"" for subtle behavior in his characters that hints at bigger things to come. I predict he is going to make a film that will blow the ""indie world"" up in a few years. You can see a distinct style taking form in this movie and when this style finds the right subject matter, it should lead to something truly special.",1341792000,,1916,4.768072289156627
8459190,5,B005648TTE,"What began as a predictable ""bachelor party movie"" evolved into a poignant story illustrating the consequences of making choices in the moment. John Keating's portray of William Shay, a groom trying to dodge temptation the night before his wedding, is both heartfelt and tragic. Well worth viewing.",1339286400,,298,5.361702127659575
8459191,5,B005648TTE,"I was fortunate, in several ways, to be able to keep up with this film (before, during and after production). First being my brother, John Keating, had a starring role, it was featured in our area for a screening and I received my autographed copy after the release. I was so impressed with the story and the acting of all the characters. There are so many aspects of this film that each of us could say they have ""been there or thought that"" about some of the situations. Of course that pool shrinks when you throw porn stars it it!! Personally, after it was over and I had time to digest it all, it was a little odd to watch my brother (as our mother put it) simulating sex on a big screen but by the time we get to that part...well....I had forgotten it was him I was watching!

I have read some terrific reviews and have to say you are doing yourself a disservice if you don't give this film a shot, it is so worth it!

Kudos to all involved in every aspect of this film!!!",1336521600,,977,4.164021164021164
8459192,5,B005648TTE,"Not that I am biased and I haven't really seen much of his work, but my brother's performance was really impressive to me.  Up to now, I didn't think he could pour piss out of a boot even by reading the instructions on the bottom.  However, in this instance, he did a job which was so amazing to me, I forgot I was watching someone I knew, and used to beat up when we were kids.  I only hope he will remember the little people when he makes the big time.  Oh, yeah, and I hope he is generous with his money.  John, I wrote this review really slowly because I know you can't read very fast.",1336262400,,589,4.0
