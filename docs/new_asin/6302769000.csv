7831150,4,6302769000,"A surprisingly entertaining movie with grade A studs Christopher Atkins and Julian McMahon showing it off to impress the ladies. This movie has decent story and likeable characters , nudity , great scenery, and it just a good fun movie to watch on the weekend.",1419552000,3,260,4.8
7831151,4,6302769000,"Christopher Atkins shirtless and in biking shorts is enough for me anytime.

Not enough Speedo shots of the golden boy, however.",1188000000,,128,5.095238095238095
7831152,5,6302769000,"5 stars for Julian McMahon's visible nether parts only! This director has a penchant for gratuitous butt shots, male and female alike, but Hurrah for time spent on Julian's anything! Usual 80's-like teen fare, but very watchable indeed! A great date movie, as there is plenty of eye candy for boys and girls! Hurrah, I say!",1155600000,3,323,4.785714285714286
