The quality of it is a basic in home canera on a tripod. I was very disappointed but I may not have looked enough into it before I bought it.",1512432000,,264,3.9074074074074074

8317965,5,B001LF368Q,"Thoroughly enjoyed all aspects of Stacey's workout dvd as it was REAL, non intimidating as she demonstrated all levels from advanced to beginner and especially liked the ending of slowing the workout down with a short meditation to come full circle.

Also loved boxing techniques with small weights and careful alignment which is very important for martial arts/boxing exercises.

Her second segment carefully demonstrated proper techniques for kicks and for all workout levels.

If you're looking for a well balanced cardio/mind body workout..give this DVD a shot and more!",1233273600,9,574,5.426966292134831
8317966,5,B001LF368Q,"My girlfriend bought this video, along with the ""Secrets of Splits & Flexibility"" for me recently as a birthday gift. To be honest, I wasn't sure if it was going to be any good at all. I have been practicing Kung Fu for many years and have come across numerous so-called martial arts with made-up names backed by marketing hype. Does Tae-Bo ring a bell?

After watching ""Anytime, Anywhere Kung Fu"" I must say that I was pleasantly surprised. I found it refreshing that someone is presenting no-frills fundamental self-defense techniques in a simple and friendly manner that is easy to follow. There are many martial arts experts that are not good teachers. However, I find Stacey to be an excellent teacher, and she certainly has a resume to back it.

I believe any beginner will be able to quickly pick up on the training that Stacey presents and build from there. Although I already have years of Kung Fu experience, I also found it very useful to be reminded of the basics and why they are so important. Very often, seasoned martial artists simply neglect that part of their training and concentrate on perfecting their latest trick move. I, for one, am guilty of that more than I would like to admit. I was especially impressed with the inclusion of a meditation section in this video, because that aspect of Kung Fu is often overlooked in training.

I was hoping that this video would also show some more intermediate or advanced skills, but since this is Stacey's first offering -- I anticipate that there will be other videos from her in the future that would address those skills. After all, one must learn to walk first before they can run. Overall, I highly recommend ""Anytime Anywhere Kung Fu"" and look forward to others that may follow.",1227571200,12,1748,4.687296416938111
