8502233,5,B006OT0SPI,Murnau meets Dali meets Greenaway. Brilliant and deeply disturbing. Art house quality film; like being at The Angelika.,1422489600,,119,5.666666666666667
8502234,1,B006OT0SPI,"I've watched ""Head Case"" and nearly had to force myself to finish that.  Problem was that I purchased this and then found out Head Case was one to be watched before this.  I tried to watch the entire movie, I really did.  But as with Head Case, it was just long, boring, and drawn out.  I made it through nearly half before I couldn't take it anymore.  The movie is now sitting with Head Case in my garage to go into the garage sale.",1392508800,,433,4.107142857142857
8502235,3,B006OT0SPI,I was not very impressed with The Ritual.  It was long and drawn out and on the boring side.  It was very easy to get up and get a cup of coffee without hitting pause without worry of missing anything.  More of a Drama style and very slow moving.,1375315200,5,246,3.979591836734694
8502236,3,B006OT0SPI,"The first entry, ""Head Case"" was the most interesting and weird. The partner-in-killing, the wife, seems like a demented Joy Behar. She hardly appears in this film. Her son, from a previous marriage,  borders on an interesting character but the storyline is too long- just as all 3 films are. However, as a trio there is something worth watching. Something.",1374105600,2,357,4.95
8502237,1,B006OT0SPI,"Not sure why but I thought this was a documentary, instead it's a terrible student-quality film. Low budget, bad acting, absolutely terrible.",1369872000,5,141,5.454545454545454
8502238,2,B006OT0SPI,"Not the greatest but it was ok......I think it was low,low,budget lol......I wouldn't waist my $ if I were you",1369699200,3,110,4.55
