8186411,5,B000ORALQW,"I had seen this particular Rocketbook at the library several years ago and this year, when I knew I would be teaching Beowulf, I decided to purchase my own copy.  In a piece of literature like Beowulf, I try to find all kinds of background information, analysis, even pronunciation of words (taking this in college was a long time ago!!), in order to pass along all I can to my students.  Rocketbook Presents: Beowulf is very clear, very succinct and includes information that will help make what could be a difficult read an adventure, rather than a chore!  Thanks for helping this teacher.",1374710400,2,591,4.718446601941747
