8008590,5,B000198AMK,"I really enjoyed this presentation of Handle ' s Messiah, because this was a ""real "" choir rather than a professional choir. The singers are ""mature"" but knew their parts well! Some of the arias or recitatives were exchanged  among the soloists, theses were also done well! The sound engineering was outstanding in this biblical historical setting! This is  great addition to  your holiday music collection!",1389484800,,407,5.136363636363637
8008591,4,B000198AMK,"I recently sang in a ""Come and Sing"" Messiah.  For non-UK readers, this is a British thing done around Christmas and Easter time.  A group of accomplished instrumentalists and soloists will join with a group of enthusiastic amateur singers of varying abilities and experience to rehearse Messiah intensively over a weekend, and sing it on the Sunday evening.

The one I sang in was at Leeds Metropolitan University with soloists from Opera North and the famous Black Dyke Mills Band.  The excellent conductor, Andrew Dean, observed that it was far more important to sing the work with conviction than with meticulous accuracy.  This reflected the intended spirit of Handel's masterpiece - and with regard to some inaccuracy, well, the work could take it!

How well Dean's comment sums up this charming and poignant performance by an Israeli choir of the Christian story told in Handel's reputed response to a sermon by John Wesley.  True, it is clear that the soloists are amateur performers.  But their voices are pleasant, and the soprano in particular has a tone that some professional singers might envy.  The chorus is very good indeed and the Ranaana Symphonette is at least equal to most of the professional orchestras that I have ever heard perform the work.  The highlight of the performance for me was the spontaneous clapping and cheering from the Israeli audience even before the orchestra had finished the last bars of the Hallelujah Chorus.

To sum up.  If you are satisfied with nothing but professional slickness and accuracy then this is not the recording for you.  However, if you want to hear a recording which I think would have warmed Handel's heart, then you might give this one a try.",1137283200,3,1707,4.926573426573427
8008592,5,B000198AMK,"Wow, what a great experience this live performance is!  Instead of a slick, impersonal production, I was treated to something very organic and engaging.  How the producers controlled the sound so expertly in that stone environment is beyond my knowledge, but it is wonderful.  The 5.1 surround sound really filled my room.  That combined with the video angles and close-ups really showed the inner workings of a major concert.  I felt as though I was there.  This is an amazing piece with a Jewish orchestra and choir singing a Christian Masterpiece in a Catholic church run by German Benedictine priests.  Think about it.  There's alot to consider here.  Truly inspired.",1076284800,5,671,5.027272727272727
8008593,5,B000198AMK,"I received this version of Handel's Messiah as a Christmas present and couldn't be happier.  Handel's piece is obviously brilliant.  The sound track on this DVD gives the piece its rightful respect - it is fabulous.  To me, the performance location at the Church of the Multiplication of Loaves and Fish provided an intimate and informal, yet, inspirational setting for such a majestic piece.  The details of the video were well thought and, in my opinion, added to the intimacy of the concert.",1075852800,5,494,4.9156626506024095
8008594,2,B000198AMK,"It was clear from the start that this was going to be an amature performance when the 'Father' of the church instructed the audience to turn off their cell phones - why in the world would you record this in 5.1 for all to see over and over again!  The musicians are of average quality and the performance seems to be home-grown.  The emotional appeal (in Israel where Jesus walked) is not enough to make this DVD anything but interesting.  Get the Handel Messiah w/Cleobury, Dawson, Summers, & Brandenburg Consort - they get an A+ in my book.",1075593600,9,542,4.510204081632653
