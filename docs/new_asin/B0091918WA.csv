8533872,3,B0091918WA,"This is a good presentation of his work, but it duplicates my other DVD docs. A shame he is no longer with us and that a more professional presentation of his work doesn't exist.",1384732800,,178,4.264705882352941
8533873,4,B0091918WA,"I gave this a four because the documentary is long and the quality of the footage is not as good as I had hoped it would be. That said, it does a good job of showcasing Zecharia's work from the book, Lost Realms. I had read the book a number of years ago and believe this documentary to be a good cmpanion to the book! I am a big fan of Zecharia's and I didn't mind sitting through the long presentation. I believe UFO enthusiasts would love to have this dvd for their collection but someone who is not a UFO enthusiast may not like the length of the presentation.",1363392000,2,564,4.136363636363637
