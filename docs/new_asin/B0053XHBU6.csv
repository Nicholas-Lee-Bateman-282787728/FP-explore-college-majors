Flying a desk at the moment with hopes to have a flying lesson one day (its been on my bucket list since I was 14 (now 52).

Your footage has certainly helped to keep the dream alive.

8455818,5,B0053XHBU6,Got this and his 101 taldragger DVD. They were well produced and had a ton of real-world utility.,1451001600,,97,4.444444444444445
8455819,5,B0053XHBU6,I bought DVD from Crazed Pilot and it was delivered on time.  This is a great training video. Damian the instructor did an excellent job,1432944000,,136,4.44
8455820,5,B0053XHBU6,Great insight into intricacies of tailwheel design and nature at flight,1424736000,,71,5.545454545454546
8455821,3,B0053XHBU6,OK to know but not a training video ....,1415491200,,40,3.5555555555555554
8455822,4,B0053XHBU6,Flying the Tail-wheel plane is a BLAST! Damian provides the knowledge for you to learn techniques how beyond the basics..,1363824000,,121,5.1
8455823,5,B0053XHBU6,"This is a great CD. Five Stars for well done. Great editing, sound, video, and set up for each move. It's all this and a sack of chips. A must see ! I have 101 & 201, both are great viewing.",1335916800,2,190,3.658536585365854
8455824,5,B0053XHBU6,"This video is the perfect training tool for instructors and a must have for any tailwheel pilot.  I got 201 by mistake and immediately ordered 101 because the quality of the first one was so good.  101 is also a must.  There is much useful information for any pilot in these videos, especially if you plan on doing any backcountry flying.",1315353600,3,338,4.508196721311475
8455825,5,B0053XHBU6,"Got both 101 and 202. Definitely learned a lot.

Instructor did a great job of explaining why ground loops happen in 101 - and how to avoid them.

The instructor had a great point that you can use taildragger techniques on a tricycle gear plane, but you can't use tricycle gear techniques on a taildragger.

Instructs and then demonstrates using slips to both reduce altitude on base/final, and how to flare the plane to lose excess speed WHILE SLIPPING.

Hadn't heard the term ""ground rush"" before, but I've definitely seen it while landing. Probably won't do that again after I learned what was going on.

This is a long training video, where everything is explained and demonstrated in detail - enough so you'll be able to do it yourself. It's the most detailed aviation training video I've seen.

Oh. And this ain't your father's cub they're using. It's a pretty neat plane.",1307923200,4,878,4.743421052631579
