8477255,1,B000O77QQ0,There is only one(1) episode per season. This season is incomplete. Where are the rest of the episodes? There are supposed to be the whole season of What Not to Wear.,1418169600,,166,4.387096774193548
8477256,3,B000O77QQ0,"What Not To Wear is a show that offers women (who have been nominated by their friends, colleagues or family members) an entirely new wardrobe worth $5000, IF they're willing to listen to the stylists' suggestions and give up anything and everything in their current wardrobe if the stylists say it goes. They're also given a hair and makeup makeover to complete the new look.

The show really works because of its two talented stylists -- Clinton Kelly and Stacy London -- who teach woman how to dress their best and (oftentimes by the end) how to learn and feel better about themselves in the process. Stacy and Clinton are sarcastic, funny and highly entertaining hosts. They offer quick and clever quips, cracking jokes about their participants' crappy clothes, but what's more special about Stacy and Clinton is that they aren't just there to crack jokes like some Joan Rivers red carpet wannabes. They offer their participants helpful suggestions on WHY their crappy clothes don't work for their bodies. They offer alternatives for looking your best, demonstrate why clothes right off the rack aren't always going to fit perfectly -- finding a tailor to hem or take clothes in is a helpful tool! -- and how to start looking at clothes with your body shape in mind so that you can highlight your best assets.

What's also terrific about Stacy and Clinton is that they don't pull punches. They're honest with the participants, they don't allow excuses, they push the women to try new clothes they might have skipped in the past, and they teach how to look at clothes in the stores with a more open mind. If you don't try something on, how do you know it won't work with your body shape? You have to try things in order to start narrowing down what types of clothes work best for your shape. You can't automatically assume that nothing will look good on you, and you can't automatically say 'this looks awful on me!' when a simple fix by a tailor might actually solve the issue (changing the hem length, bringing in the waist a bit, shortening a strap which will lift the whole bodice, etc.).

What really draws me in are the episodes where the participant gets a great makeover and learns how to appreciate herself and her body and see it all in a new light. Some participants can't make that connection or they don't want to change and think the way they look is just fine (there are have been some inappropriately dressed participants who don't seem to think there's anything wrong with looking like a Playboy bunny and even after their makeover refuse to see why the new outfits work better and make use of their physical attributes without 'putting it all out there'). But the best episodes are the ones where Stacy and Clinton manage to get through to their participants in a positive way, acting almost like counselors more than mere stylists, and showing these women that they are beautiful and vibrant and that the outside can match the inside.

It's a fun show worth watching.

That said... this pricing is RIDICULOUS. Are they seriously charging $20 for ONE episode of the show? This program has run for over 10 seasons; it would cost THOUSANDS of dollars to buy all the episodes (if all of them were even made available). These days season sets for most TV programs (including reality how-to shows like this one) run $20 - $50 for an entire season. Not just one episode! This is an outrageous rip-off. Who's going to buy each episode singly at this cost? Especially if you can't remember the exact participant and want to see all of them, not just one. TLC needs to put out full seasons in sets, like Bravo/Lifetime does with Project Runway. Otherwise, they won't be getting my money and shouldn't be getting yours either.

I'm giving the show 5 stars, but knocking it down to 3 for the cost. TLC needs to make this more affordable.",1380672000,4,3847,4.666666666666667

There must be a marketing person reading these reviews.  If so, what are you thinking?

$20 for a single episode?

This is why people pirate.  And in this case, I support it.",1320019200,9,192,4.371428571428571
8477258,1,B000O77QQ0,"Wow!  I dropped cable about a year ago, and I've been missing my What Not To Wear fix ever since then.  Since WNTW is one of the few shows you can't find streaming, I first checked netflix for a DVD, and when that produced nothing I came on Amazon expecting to spend $40-50 dollars for a season.  Instead I find the price is $20 for an episode!
Yeah, I love the show - but no where near that much.
I'll keep my money, thanks, and when TLC decides to make the show easily and reasonably accessible - that's when I'll get my Clinton and Stacy fix.  Until then, I guess I'm out of luck.",1284768000,17,583,4.087719298245614
