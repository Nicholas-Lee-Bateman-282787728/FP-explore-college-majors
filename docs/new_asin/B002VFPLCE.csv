8382030,5,B002VFPLCE,"I watched this as a teenager back in 04 when it came out. I wanted my Sunday School class to experience it as well. However when I moved from my childhood home, I wasn't able to bring all my VeggieTales DVD's  with me.  My students they loved it as I did 'all those years ago'. I was singing along and laughing and the silliness of it all. Brought back some great memories. It's hard to find age appropriate, bible based teachings for kids these days. I'm just glad VeggieTales are still available.",1492128000,,498,4.4021739130434785

8382033,5,B002VFPLCE,"This is another in the Veggie Tale series, and teaches about Sharing. It is super cute and keeps my 3 year old's attention. Lyle is the smallest in a group of Vikings that set out to 'pillage and plunder' the nearby monastery. Lyle takes his portion of the goods back to the monastery and apologizes for his friends' actions. Very cute how it turns back to helping others and sharing. Highly recommended!!",1372723200,,405,4.638888888888889
