2600070,5,B000G2YC74,"If you haven't seen this movie,and you like yugioh,please do,both of them,all of them. Thus if you like to play yugioh,then youl feel the energy coming out of these movies.",1168473600,4,172,4.766666666666667
2600071,5,B000G2YC74,after watching the first film my son could not wait for the next . when he finally got it he but it on and watched it and was not disapointed with it,1168300800,2,149,3.6875
2600072,5,B000G2YC74,"This was the movie we should have had, instead of that one that was all about the game and Anubis.  The writing was really spot-on!  This movie had a lot of real closure and warm and fuzziness.  What is the power to rule mankind?  It's all about what it takes to be a king.  Someone even refers to Yami as Nameless Pharaoh!  We also get to meet a former possessor of the Millennium Ring from 2,000 years ago, and someone else carrying an evil spirit!!!  Cool!",1159401600,6,459,4.267441860465116
2600073,5,B000G2YC74,"Part 2 brings just as much fun as part 1 did. Yugi has completed 2 tests already but the hardest are yet to come. Yugi must fight Joey when he becomes captured by an evil force, fight the five-god dragon and much more. The real challenge is the fight between Yugi and Alex the great, if Yugi loses then Alex will have the power to ruel the world. Part 2 is a must-have but you have to have seen the first one before the second or it will never make any sense. Yugi combines with yet more monsters in the second half, and he looks really good all dressed up in armor!;)",1158796800,3,568,4.080357142857143
2600074,5,B000G2YC74,"I've seen only a few episodes of this DVD on a few websites and it's just as good as the first DVD.  The graphics are great, although in some places you can tell the difference between images and animation.

All in all, it is definitely worth buying.",1155340800,6,250,4.297872340425532

8128816,1,B000G2YC74,"If I could give this a -0 star I would! First off the package was left on the front door so it was stolen by our neighbors kids! We got our item/ items back later that night I also bought part 2 and the 2nd and 3rd box season of the original show, But that's not why the low rating! I decided to save money and buy the capsule monsters movies used/like new big mistake! The case had a few scratches, but that's ok because it's used I expected that, but the DVDs kept pausing for long periods of time then skipping! I tried cleaning the disk but that didn't help!  I understand it's used but the condition described was like new! Witch was total Bs! It's unwatchable! I will post this review on the 2nd movie as will.",1470182400,,716,4.151079136690647

8128821,4,B000G2YC74,Good movie to finish the first part of the story. A little different then what we're used to. For posterity it does fit nicely if you own the first part.,1375401600,,153,4.133333333333334
