6104511,1,B00GRZPQ74,"Very disappointed, overall color is bad, surprised at the actors inability to deliver a quality movie. Story line is good but not worth the money spent on the rental.",1393632000,,166,4.758620689655173
6104512,2,B00GRZPQ74,"In the year 2037 Beverly Hills is part of a quarantine area. An earthquake occurred and there were three ""future reactors"" in the area which contaminated the land. The area has been taken over by drug lords and various homeless people because everyone wants to live in a poison zone when the beaches are all pristine. The story centers on Hammond (Michael Jai White) a police officer who operates outside of the box. He is assigned an android cop Andi (Randy Wayne) as a partner. Then the film gets weird, It seems the mayor's daughter (Larissa Vereza) is in a coma...her body anyway. Her consciousness is located inside an android that looks like her and is inside the quarantined area, one that has 14 drug lords and she doesn't know she is an android. Our team's job is to go get her and bring her back in the Asylum production of Robo Cop Escapes from LA.

Now that is not it for the major twists, they do make it weirder with a few more.

The film is supposed to be an action comedy with CG flames and guns that never need reloading. The dialog didn't make it. The humor was flat. Comparing an android to a soda machine was supposed to get a laugh. Surely they could have come up with something better than that. The action consisted mostly of bad gun play. I was bored. Kids might like it.

6104537,5,B00GRZPQ74,"I loved every minute of this movie. While a lot of people might quickly dismiss it as a robocop knockoff, it actually deserves more respect. The action is great, the special effects are some of the best from the asylum, and the actors were well casted. I especially loved the futuristic helicopter. The scene where it is on pursuit of the good guys was my favorite of the whole movie.",1443657600,2,384,4.5

6104544,5,B00GRZPQ74,Interesting story line shot on a tight budget (by the producer's own admission) but entertaining nonetheless.,1421798400,,109,5.875
6104555,2,B00GRZPQ74,"I had high hopes of enjoying this film, Micheal Jai White is one my favorite living martial artist. White is a genuine lifelong student of various fighting styles and has plenty of belts and trials to validate his greatness. He is also one of the few genuine martial artist still standing in an age of CGI and Hollywood styled fighting ripping off the arts. However... this movie sucked! It was cheap, corny, and beneath Whites capabilities. When I returned this movie to my local video store I demanded a refund. Yes, it's that bad! Maybe he took the role for the money, maybe he's just trying to stay relevant, who knows. Its sad to see such a genuinely talented actor/martial artist submerge himself in sub-par films. White may not be the best actor, but he's definitely not terrible and he's definitely by far the leading man out of America when it comes to athletic ability and martial arts. Micheal Jai White should be the number one go-to guy when it comes down to any serious martial action thrillers... maybe someday.

A few films that displays Micheal Jai Whites athletic ability, power, and martial arts are: Undisputed 2: Last Man Standing, Blood and Bone, Universal Soldier: The Return (the fight scene with White and JVCD was awesome), Exit Wounds (the fight with White and Steven Segal was equally as awesome), Never Back Down 2: The Beatdown wasn't spectacular but displayed Whites greatness as a martial artist.",1420761600,7,1428,4.828571428571428
6104556,1,B00GRZPQ74,"Acting was terrible, director did a poor job of building connections with the characters, plot boring and poor transitions.  Do not waste your money like I did.

6104557,3,B00GRZPQ74,"Not the best B-movie, but it has a good soundtrack; animations from time to time appear to be good, but in general, special effects are weak. Still it's not an awful movie and not really a bad one.",1418256000,,197,4.2105263157894735

6104562,3,B00GRZPQ74,"Standard Asylum style film, filled with plot holes, bad acting and effects. The only reason I gave it three is because its a Mockbuster of one of my favorite films, RoboCop",1407369600,,172,4.580645161290323

8626451,3,B00GRZPQ74,"This is an Asylum production and they are relatively low budget maybe one step up from the Scyfy movie with bad effects. That is to let you know what you are in for. Now let me also say I found it entertaining, not great by any means and very predictable too but still fun enough to pay 6 bucks. Randy Wayne as the android partner given to Michael Jai White and his trainer are pretty good together, there is some banter and not all bad either. Don't really expect too much from the rest of the cast as it is very downscale. Again this is predictable fun.",1485993600,,555,4.196261682242991
8626452,3,B00GRZPQ74,"Not Robo-Cop and not that other android cop TV series - perhaps somewhere in between.  Cop gets android partner and they go up against trouble-makers within and without the system.  The ending was a surprise (truly, I never expected that to happen) but it was telecast by some of the dialogue that I dismissed at the time.  Worth a watch.",1482883200,,338,4.6

8626457,4,B00GRZPQ74,"This is a good movie. Just don't expect it to be Robocop. It's inspired by that film but it has it's own flavor. White shows his sense of humor and he plays off his Android partner well. Hardison is very good and Dutton is excellent as always. There are several exciting, hand to hand fights with White. There is a cool helicopter that eventually is used as a weapon. The special effects are pretty good. There is blood, but it doesn't look real so the violence is lessened. I would've liked to see more fights but as it is this film is good. White shows off his comedic chops while playing a tough cop who hates robots due to a deadly robotic malfunction early in the film. This film shows how talented an actor White is. He can be tough, humorous and then sensitive all in one scene. Recommended for action fans looking for a martial arts adventure featuring an African American lead. This film would be rated PG-13.",1463788800,2,918,4.437869822485207
8626458,4,B00GRZPQ74,"Michael Jai White performs stunningly with other supporting cast in this movie , it maybe an low budget movie but sometimes those are the best movies made , i gave this movie 4 stars due to its intense action and relevant storyline of futuristic police ,  and sci-fi concept of humans using robotic interfaces made in their own individual, images , i recommend other customers view this movie im glad i got since my local video store refused to order the movie by unpopular demand.",1461801600,2,481,4.658823529411765
