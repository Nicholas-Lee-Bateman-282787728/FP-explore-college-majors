3790866,5,B001TJYFRU,I have seen other productions of Emma and Jane Eyre. They can't top this one. Kudos to A&E! Absolutely the best!,1334188800,,112,4.380952380952381
3790867,5,B001TJYFRU,"I totally enjoyed both films. The stories of Emma and Jane Eyre are timeless and no matter who the casts are, you can't go wrong. Kate Beckingsale, and Mr. Strong are terrific. So is the rest of the cast in Emma. Great story. This version of Jane Eyre is very good. Samantha is great and she is in both films. If you are fans of period films, you'll love these two timeless classics.",1312329600,8,383,4.260273972602739
3790868,5,B001TJYFRU,"I love movies like this. These where excellent movies, enjoyed them very much. Shipped in no time and could sit and watch them within days. Loved them much, hahaha.",1300665600,4,164,4.689655172413793
3790869,2,B001TJYFRU,"I have seen five different versions of Jane Eyre and this one was by far the worst. It was almost too painful to watch. Many things were changed and left out. The one thing that most upset me was the interaction bewteen Mr. Rochester and Jane. From what they presented it would be difficult to understand why the two fell in love in the first place. I recommend the 1983 BBC version with Timothy Dalton and Zelah Clarke or even the 1973 BBC version with Sorcha Cusack and Micheal Jayston. The 1973 version is shorter, but it includes scenes that are missing in the 1983 version.
Emma, however, was a well written adaptation. I had pleasure watching it, though it was rather short. This movie is the only reason that it got two stars. Emma would have recieved four or five stars from me, but Jane Eyre is on the negative scale. I suggest buying Emma seperatly.",1274140800,9,859,4.477707006369426
3790870,3,B001TJYFRU,Received the DVD later than expected.  When I played it there were several damaged spots on the DVD and my MAC player skipped over these areas.,1270080000,2,143,4.5
3790871,5,B001TJYFRU,"If you like the period pieces, set in Victorian England, then you will love both of these excellent renditions.  One is by Jane Austen, Queen of the Romance Novels - the other by one of the Bronte sisters - both of whom each wrote an incredible opus.  These two movies are a delight to watch.  They take us back to a simpler time - except it was not simple to navigate the very difficult nuances of moral behavior.  The slightest hint of scandal, associations with people below your station - all pitfalls that seem unbelievable to our modern society.  However, they were all too real to the people who lived, loved and balanced their hearts against the mores of their day.  These romance novels have been copied, but never equaled.  Don't miss either of them!",1239840000,8,760,4.5851851851851855
3790872,5,B001TJYFRU,"Great value, Well-packaged in a plastic DVD case. We ordered this for the Emma which is our second favorite Emma (a very close second only to the 2009 version) and you get a Jane Eyre along with it. We love the scenery, acting, and music in all of the Jane Eyre movies but just have a difficult time with the message to choose a rich rude woman-hater and you'll live happily ever after (there I said it).",1419638400,,404,4.259740259740259
3790873,3,B001TJYFRU,"Jane Eyre was good, but much prefer the other versions of Emma (Gwyneth Paltrow from 1996 http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0116191/ or they 2009 miniseries with Romola Garai and Johnny Lee Miller)",1410739200,,191,5.857142857142857
3790874,5,B001TJYFRU,great service and good product,1408147200,,30,5.2
3790875,4,B001TJYFRU,"Emma was very well presented, and ""reasonably close"" to the actual book. Light, comical and entertaining. Suitable for children, especially those who study the books in school. Jane Eyre was okay - if you know the story, it is rather dark-sided. So was the movie. I would not show it to any child under 12 or 13 (that's just me). My daughters (12 and 15 yrs old) thoroughly enjoyed Emma. I only let my older daughter see Jane Eyre, as she knows the book, and even she found it to be rather dreary. Emma was done almost in the same style as BBC's Pride & Prejudice, except it was not a 6-part series - but the good quality was similar.",1395619200,,634,4.291666666666667
3790876,5,B001TJYFRU,"I have 4 different copies of Jane Eyre and I love every one of them for the different interpretations they have of this book.

I have 2 copies of Emma and love both of these too.",1367539200,2,178,3.9444444444444446
3790877,5,B001TJYFRU,"The only word that comes to my mind and heart about this film is that it just makes me happy!
I can watch it over and over and it brings me such joy to watch. I always compare any version
of Emma to this one. This one to me tops the rest....it's simply delightful.",1361232000,2,264,3.9074074074074074
3790878,5,B001TJYFRU,"I love both of these movies. This is my favorite movie of Jane Austen's Emma. This version of Jane Eyre may not be perfect, but it is still very good and one that I will watch again. The price is great.",1360108800,3,202,3.951219512195122
3790879,5,B001TJYFRU,I love both of the movies.  I had looked for them at several stores but couldn't find them.  I am pleased with my purchase.,1355184000,,123,4.083333333333333
3790880,5,B001TJYFRU,"I saw this version of ""Emma"" with Kate Beckinsale long ago and loved it, though it has practically disappeared since the overly simiplistic version with Gwyneth Paltrow was released.  I am so happy to find it coupled with my favorite version of ""Jane Eyre"", which portrays the relationships between all characters most clearly, and through seamless action and dialogue.  Need this DVD to replace my old VHS of ""Jane Eyre"", and add this favorite version of ""Emma"" to my collection. Come on, Santa!!

8341718,4,B001TJYFRU,"I have mixed emotions about this one. I thoroughly enjoyed Jane Eyre. However, I didn't care for this adaption of Emma. Maybe it had to do with the casting. I prefer other versions I have seen. Overall I give it a 4 star in favor of Jane Eyre.",1473120000,,243,4.083333333333333
8341719,5,B001TJYFRU,Awesome double feature. Kate Beckinsale is the best Emma version I prefer. Closer to the book.,1467676800,4,94,4.9375
8341720,4,B001TJYFRU,"Emma (1997) Starring Kate Beckinsale - 3 stars
I tried to watch this as though I had never read the story or seen any of the other film adaptions. And I have to say Emma just came off as mean and snobbish. I didn't find her charming and couldn't even imagine liking her at all. The ending scene of the harvest ball was probably my favorite and Emma started to seem likable by then but I still found her quite unlikable for most of the film and couldn't image why he would be in love with her. The sets and clothes were nice, so the visuals were good but I still felt many of the actor/actress left something to be desired.

Jane Eyre (1997) Starring Samantha Morton - 4 stars
Only the second Jane Eyre film I've seen but I do believe I like this one more.",1451001600,,755,4.136054421768708

8341726,4,B001TJYFRU,As a huge fan of Jane Austen and Charlotte Bront these adaptations are lovely; of course they omit plenty and condense for time but it's still nice to watch the stories...Samantha Morton is in both movies...and she's a great actress...,1421366400,,235,4.9
