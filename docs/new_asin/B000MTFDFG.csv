8172204,4,B000MTFDFG,"Although not great quality, this DVD represents the best print of this film I've ever seen.  The DVD is complete, and features a pre-credits prologue that reveals important information about one of the main characters.  That prologue was missing from most VHS transfers.

The film itself is wonderfully bizarre, like remaking Ed Wood's GLEN OR GLENDA in a film noir style.  A young college man becames enamored of a porn actress, and follows her through an increasingly strange subculture.  The plot is almost too weird to describe, but read the following for a hint:

About a third of this film appears in an anthology film entitled NIGHT TRAIN TO TERROR.  That truncated edition adds some special effects, but drops much of the original film's strange plot.  For example, a formerly female character suddenly appears as a male character without any explanation.  The original film, DEATH WISH CLUB, details that dramatic change.

UPDATE: Under the alternate title GRETTA, this film will be included in its entirety on the October 8, 2013 release of the film NIGHT TRAIN TO TERRROR, from the Vinegar Syndrome label.  GRETTA (aka DEATH WISH CLUB) will be the 91 minute version, completely uncut.  Vinegar Syndrome will be releasing a dual Blu-ray/DVD set of NIGHT TRAIN TO TERROR, and GRETTA (aka DEATH WISH CLUB) will appear as an extra on the DVD disc.  GRETTA will not appear on the Blu-ray disc.",1359417600,3,1399,4.952789699570816
8172205,1,B000MTFDFG,"This particular version of the film is incomplete. The tape ends right in the middle of the movie, literally end of the spindle ends. Unless mine was a fluke copy, which I doubt, the whole movie is not on the tape, which is lame, because you're going to want to see where this film goes. The movie itself is pretty good and weird, but this release of it is the pits.",1355616000,,366,4.169014084507042
