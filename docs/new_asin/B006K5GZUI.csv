8500083,5,B006K5GZUI,"If you like sword battles, you will like this series.

The Executive Producer of this series was David Abramowitz, who was also one of the co-producers of Highlander The TV Series [&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Highlander-The-Complete-Series-Seasons-1-6/dp/B0007DA3V6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Highlander - The Complete Series (Seasons 1-6)</a>&nbsp;], which also had lots of sword battles.  Both series offered more than just sword battles.  There were also rich plots and stories, romance, character development, drama, adventure, along with sprinkles of comedy.  Considering that 22 episodes were filmed in less than a year, it is amazing the level of quality that was achieved.  Granted some episodes were obviously not at the same level of quality as most of the episodes are in this series.

Watching Tessie Santiago play as the main hero was a treat.  OK, it seems pretty dumb that no one recognizes Senorita Alvarado to be the Queen of Swords, since all she does is wear a flimsy mask.  The produces should have at least braided Tessie's hair when she played as the Queen of Swords.  But I guess the Producers chose not to, because Tessie does look sexy with her long flowing black hair (by the way, Tessie is a natural blonde, which I find funny, because most women seek to dye their hair blonde, like Elsa Pataky, instead of brunette).

All the other Actresses and Actors in this series were great.  I especially loved the episode where Bo Derek was a guest star in.

What ""killed"" the show was probably the Legal Issues, mainly copyright infringement with Zorro.  Fireworks (the company producing and filming the series) defended itself by stating that Zorro was now in the ""public domain"" (i.e. more than 50 years have past since Zorro was first published).  Even though they won their legal battles, the costs of defending themselves probably caused the series to be cancelled.  I find this upsetting, because I loved the series, loved the characters, loved the stories, loved the sword fights, loved the scenery/locations, ...  It is rare to have such a relatively high quality show anymore.  I wish there were more seasons of this show.",1464134400,,2198,5.2701149425287355

8500086,1,B006K5GZUI,"I don't know of any shows that were produced 1.77:1 back then.  With the exception of ""the secret adventures of jules verne"" which I wish they would release.  This is probly cropped on top and bottom like V and Dark Shadows revival.  Dvd's should only be produced in their original aspect ratio and NEVER cropped.  If anyone can confirm this is ""not cropped"" please post the fact, and I will buy it.  But I never buy cropped shows.

  ATTENTION;  UPDATE;
I did purchase these and yes 1.77 is indeed the proper aspect ratio for this. (Thanks to the poster that provided the info)
 However;
The dvd's will not play smoothly.  When you see scenes where there is a lot of movement and especialy the camera pans, the action is jerky.  I tried 2 different phillips players, 2 different apex players, a cyberhome and a toshiba.
  I have tons of PAL region 0 and region 2 dvd's.  They all play perfect on all my machines and my Brother's machines.  These do not.
  Obvious encoding problem from the dvd production company.  I will not purchase anything from that company again.  Sent it back for a refund.",1395014400,2,1097,4.556701030927835
8500087,5,B006K5GZUI,"I stumbled across this TV show by accident. I'm a big Zorro fan so this piqued my interest. I bought an inexpensive regional code free 1080p DVD player just to watch this series and after watching the complete show I have no regrets. It's a very enjoyable show for most ages and beautifully filmed in wide screen. This DVD set played fine with no problems, I selected the English soundtrack and then disabled the subtitles.",1391990400,4,423,4.653333333333333
8500088,5,B006K5GZUI,You can watch it with French language and English subtitles or in English language. When viewing it with English language it defaults with French subtitles. All you have to do is first switch to English version then turn off the subtitles on your DVD player. Then you can watch it in English without subtitles. Just finished watching the entire set. The picture quality is outstanding and looks great on a widescreen set. This is one of my favorite shows. I wished it had lasted longer then one season.,1387411200,13,502,4.715909090909091
8500089,5,B006K5GZUI,"This show used to be syndicated, airing on a local TV station on Saturday afternoons, and I used to love watching it. I was bummed when it went off the air after one season. I had many of the episodes taped on VHS, but I was so glad to find it on DVD. The gorgeous Tessie Santiago stars as a character that is, essentially, a female version of Zorro, and we see her adventures against a corrupt government leader. It's nice popcorn fun.",1363910400,4,436,4.265060240963855
8500090,2,B006K5GZUI,"The DVD set I received has no English only edition. The English language version has French subtitles in the center of the screen. To say that is a pain is being polite. If this is not a problem for you, the quality and authenticity is good.",1357776000,4,241,4.260869565217392
8500091,5,B006K5GZUI,"I've had the original VHS release of this show for years, but I've been afraid to watch it lately, lest my VCR eat a tape. Love this French edition DVD! I don't have a region free player, but it works if I watch on my computer. :D

Highly recommend this show to anyone who loves Xena or Zorro.",1354406400,5,293,4.051724137931035
8500092,5,B006K5GZUI,"This is a wonderful action adventure series of how Zorro should have been done. Quoting lead actress Tessie Santiago in an interview the characters are ""real people"". There are no buffoons. The series strives for realism and the interaction between the characters very believable.

Adults storylines, profanities are said, blood is spilt but not gratuitously. Some of the fights are full blooded. Sex (including the attempted rape of Tessa) is intimated but not explicit and all the women are unbelievably beautiful.

Beautifully photographed in spaghetti western Almeria, Southern Spain, in Super 16mm film. This DVD is widescreen so you get the missing 45% cut when originally broadcast in pan and scan. Looks super on a big television.

The acting is top notch (Tessie Santiago does most of her own swordplay) from the main cast. Many British actors appear in starring roles including many Spanish parts. International actors such as Bo Derek, Sung-Hi Lee, Elizabeth Gracen, Ralf Moeller, Christian de la Fuente  appear as guest stars and David Carradine as The Serpent, a sword wielding bandit pre Kill Bill, in my favourite episode with superb support from regulars Peter Wingfield and Valentine Pelka (Highlander).

The horse and wagon stunts are classics from westerns down the ages as far back as Stagecoach. If it is in a western, it is here. The extremely violent episode The Hanged Man has two such scenes.

One word of warning the DVD is in production order so the continuity is awry. Consult wikipedia or EpGuides for correct order to watch the developing relationship between The Queen and Dr Helm.

A fun thing you can do is watch for the shortcuts when scenes are reused by using retakes and reversing film. There is one huge continuity error in episode two. It has a cost saving flashback episode but it is one of the best of it's type with half old and half new material featuring The Queen and Capt. Grisham trapped in a mine filmed incidently in studios in London.

I purchased from amazon france and at this price is a bargain.",1328572800,13,2048,4.915942028985508
