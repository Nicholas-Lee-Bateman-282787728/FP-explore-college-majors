8358108,4,B0029R81GM,"Totally weird. Love it.
Kelley based this fantastical, low-fi musical on a real high school yearbook he came across, basing his characters and sets and scenes on the photos of student activities found in the book. Hilarious, engrossing and strange.",1320105600,3,248,5.225
8358109,1,B0029R81GM,"Be warned, if you're considering this, it looks like something thrown together during a lunchbreak or two at some high school. There's absolutely zero entertainment value, zero ""art,"" zero behind-the-scenes revelations of Mike Kelley. I'm pretty familiar with Kelley and other artists of his ilk... but this looks like something he might have thrown together in 8th grade. There's nothing to look at, nothing to decipher or think over.",1288569600,2,435,5.318840579710145
