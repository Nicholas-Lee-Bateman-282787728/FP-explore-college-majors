4489085,4,B004WSA4AM,I loved this movie! I saw it in Phoenix a few months ago. I have been so anxious for the DVD since then. This movie is hysterically funny and a bit gory at the same time. It has some great comedic acting. One of the best horror comedies I have seen!,1310601600,,249,3.9019607843137254
4489086,5,B004WSA4AM,"I saw ""Man Who Collected Food"" at the Sacramento Horror Film Fest in October of 2010, and I fell in love with it. This great piece is the kind of movie that makes horror fans and fans of independent films jump for bloody, hilarious joy. Watching Miguel struggle with his food collection fetish, his mother's embarrassment toward his behavior (the restaurant scene is just plain fantastic), his nut-ball alien hunting neighbor, and an even funnier ""Anonymous"" meeting is something every fan of the genre needs to experience. Mike N. Kelly was an amazing choice for Miguel, and brings a sort of Hannibal Lector charm to the screen.

You won't believe the quality the non-Hollywood budget can breed, and as the director of MWCF, Matthew Roth knows how to tickle the funny bone... right before he sucks the marrow right out of it. If you love horror, a brilliant and original story telling experience & larger than life characters, you need to own ""Man Who Collected Food"".

So... tell me... What do you collect?",1307577600,3,1008,4.820809248554913
4489087,4,B004WSA4AM,"I saw The Man Who Collected Food at a preview screening in LA.

Fans of Kubrick, horror-comedy (think: Re-Animator) and great writing, do not miss this!

Collectors of all sorts with a stomach for horror--flea market hounds, pack rats and fans of the shows Pickers and Pawn Stars--will love this.

The story is cunningly simple: a midwestern man with trailer park neighbors and an alien-obsessed neighbor loves to collect food. He's obsessed with the packaging, to the point where he'll shamelessly steal a can of display food from the themed restaurant near his home (his aging mother's reaction is priceless).

He becomes so fixated on keeping his food collection in mint condition (think of eBay--NRFB!) that he stops eating. But he's hungry. What can he eat that isn't considered food, but that will satiate and nourish him? Well, humans, of course.

There are a few incredible shots in the film, especially one of the main character being dragged across a black-and-white tiled floor.

The music is also exceptional, written for the film by a new classical composer, in the style of the old greats. There is a killer scene (pun intended) that you will want to replay multiple times just to hear the score. If you remember and loved ""Ludwig Von"" playing in A Clockwork Orange, you will go wild for this.

A solid film from a burgeoning new director--I look forward to seeing what else Matthew Roth has for us in his twisted bag of tricks.",1306108800,5,1442,4.813765182186235
4489088,4,B004WSA4AM,"Saw this great film at the Phoenix Fear Con last night and I can't wait for the DVD release.  I loved it.  It was histerical and disgusting all at the same time.  Not to mention, it has an incredible lead actor and a great story with a few surprise twists. Anyone that is a collector can relate to Miguel's (the main character) over the top obscure obsession. He's just a little psycho! I will be purchasing this film the day it hits amazon because I love ""collecting"" quality underground horror flicks. Do yourself a favor and see this film you'll be telling all your friends about it after you view, I promise. Thankfully we have indie filmmakers that make movies for the fans not just for the $$.",1306022400,3,699,4.4453125

8445636,4,B004WSA4AM,"Miguel collects food like a kid who collects sports cards. He wants one of each package and in mint condition. This quirky obsession has caused him not to eat conventional food, so he resorts to cannibalism in order to preserve a box of cereal.

Miguel has mother issues, a neighbor who claims he shots aliens, and he tries a support group who frown on his cannibalism.

The film is humorous, but not a belly laugh. Fans of this film might want to watch ""Microwave Massacre.""

Parental Guide: Frequent f-bombs. No sex or nudity.  3 1/2 stars",1404950400,,541,4.604166666666667
8445637,4,B004WSA4AM,I really liked this movie ........ its was original and fun to watch ......... certainly worth owning  ...... decent acting for a low budget horror film and it has some pretty good laugh out loud scenes ........  GET IT,1402358400,,219,4.589743589743589
8445638,2,B004WSA4AM,Friend of mine was in the movie as the actor's mother. Found it very scary & surprised that Lila was involved in the movie. Don't want to read the book.,1376956800,,152,4.1
8445639,4,B004WSA4AM,"As a horror comedy this is no evil dead but it definitely has it's moments where it shines. First off the original score is fantastic. It delivers mood and setting where the writing sometimes fails. Second is by far my favorite part of the movie which was the crazy neighbor played by Gary Wagner, he literally makes the whole movie for me, I only wish that he got more screen time. Overall this movie is in my collection and I'm happy that it is. The movie is not going to win an academy award by any means, but that doesn't mean that it's not well put together and a ton of fun to watch.",1327017600,,589,4.175438596491228
