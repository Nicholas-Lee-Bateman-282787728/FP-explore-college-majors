4513989,1,B0050DOGTI,"I've been a practicing LMT for 2 and a half years and I recently decided to expand my skills to include Thai massage. I bought Chuck Duff's Hands Free Thai Massage DVD and absolutely loved it. I need to learn some techniques for the table, so I thought renting this video would teach me some good table Thai techniques.

It failed for several reasons.

1) I work at a spa with about 1,500 regular clients, most of whom are either overweight or inflexible. I see very few clients who are the size of the model in this video. Therefore, the lifting of the limbs recommended in this video is impractical and dangerous on my clientele and the majority of the stretches would be impossible.

2) The vast majority of my clients come in with the complaint of back and shoulder pain. This video spends maybe 5 minutes addressing these commonly tense and knotted up areas. I have had exactly one client in two and a half years want extensive work on his legs, which this video spends almost all its time on. I don't see all these lower body techniques as useful at all.

3) This video recommends cracking the toes, flattening the feet out to the side and manipulating the patellas, none of which I would ever recommend because it doesn't feel good.

While I don't think this video is worth $1.99 for its techniques, I found it quite humorous and laughed harder than I have in days at the phrases ""Drop it like it's hot"", ""like a large cat stalking through the jungle"", and ""simply throw the arms, Thai style!""

If you work exclusively on Yoga instructors and ballerinas, by all means watch this video. But if you're working on typical Americans, drop it like it's hot.",1362268800,8,1659,4.531772575250836
4513990,3,B0050DOGTI,"I recommend for those who what to learn some basics. If you are looking for advanced moves it is not the tutorial for you.
Great directory and commends.",1358553600,,152,4.464285714285714
4513991,5,B0050DOGTI,This is a great dvd for learning & practicing thai massage therapy. Excellent & clear instruction. Makes it easy for continued practice & building your skills,1358294400,2,158,5.115384615384615
4513992,5,B0050DOGTI,"I recommend this dvd for anyone interested in learning Thai Massage. Heath & Nicole are excellent instructors, and make it easy for you to learn and practice this modality from this dvd.",1358294400,2,186,4.84375
4513993,5,B0050DOGTI,"The Table Thai Yoga Massage video is an excellent source to learn from. The demonstration is done at a nice pace that makes it possible to take notes and really see what is being done. As an established yoga teacher about to get trained in Thai yoga, this was perfect.",1350864000,3,268,4.38
4513994,5,B0050DOGTI,"This DVD was great, i found it easy to follow, and some of my clients even like it during a session because it promps them to breathe! Wonderfully put together, thankyou!",1350864000,,170,4.516129032258065
4513995,5,B0050DOGTI,"The quality of this video is excellent. It is easy to understand and follow. I, personally, already knew some of the stretches, so I think this DVD is great for those beginning to learn Thai Massage Techniques.",1316563200,6,210,4.702702702702703

4513997,4,B0050DOGTI,"Love the video. Easy to understand and implement. My wish for future is for the video duration to be longer and inform us what muscle or benefit it tries to address. Otherwise, it is such a pleasant and easy dvd to watch and learn.",1411257600,,231,4.2727272727272725
4513998,5,B0050DOGTI,"I love this video! I've been receiving emails from Heath and Nicole Reed for years now regarding their workshops, and I've never been in the right city at the right time. Enter a new job in Chicago, new colleagues with ideas, and this Amazon rental.  Perfect timing and perfect execution. If you want to up your game and move beyond the exhaustive, repetitive Swedish traditional massage, rent (and or buy!) this video. Clients are desperately seeking this work! Save your body and help your clients at the same time by stretching, compressing, and working smart. Best money I've ever invested in my career.",1404000000,,607,4.893203883495145
4513999,5,B0050DOGTI,"I am absolutely pleased with that purchase! It is a superb DVD! The lady seems to enjoy giving the massage and it is so inspiring!
The narrator gives great detailed comments. I can't wait to include many parts of the routine into my own massage protocol!",1395705600,2,254,4.543478260869565
4514000,5,B0050DOGTI,"I took Heath and Nicole's Thai class in Telluride Colorado about ten years ago.  They are excellent teachers... I bought this video to learn how to adapt my thai floor massage for my massage table... this is, as everything these two do, very professional and informative and I highly recommend it!",1381017600,,297,4.823529411764706
4514001,4,B0050DOGTI,"If you are looking for a place to get started ,look here.
This video is well done and easy to incorporate .",1379980800,,107,3.909090909090909
4514002,5,B0050DOGTI,"Easy to follow, Thank you! Hope all is going better for you and yours..thank you again! Good bye for now.",1378166400,,105,4.3
4514003,4,B0050DOGTI,I foun this video to be a very basic table Thaiassage routine that is easy to learn & replicate. The video was not great in that the recording was clearly done on a budget but I could understand and see eerything clearly. Worth the 1.99 for a seven day rental!,1376611200,,260,4.22
4514004,5,B0050DOGTI,This is by far the best Thai massage instructional DVD that I have seen so far.  I would strongly recommend that all massage therapist watch this DVD.  I have incorporated many of the stretches performed in this DVD into my own practice and I do not specialize in Thai massage.  The techniques demonstrated in this video can be used by massage therapist of any discipline and can add a new depth to your own massage routine.,1372204800,6,424,4.552631578947368
4514005,3,B0050DOGTI,This video demonstrates the adaptation of Thai massage moves for a massage table. It's organized well. Chapters separate the sections of the body being worked. This makes it easy to go directly to the group of moves you want to concentrate on learning. I am a massage therapist but I have no training in traditional Thai massage. I bought this DVD to learn new moves to add to my repertoire. I have started to use some of the moves in my practice already. My biggest criticism is the price point. It was about $36 plus shipping. The video is about an hour long. The quality of the production is semi-professional at best. Most popular movies and exercise DVDs are much less expensive and the production value is much greater.,1369872000,7,725,4.627906976744186
8451106,4,B0050DOGTI,"I've been studying Thai massage/bodywork for about six years now. Every once in a while I like to see what others are teaching and putting out in the world. This is a well thought out sequence with solidly displayed body mechanics on the part of the therapist, and good quality production. The only complaint I have is what I generally disagree with on most of these kinds of DVDs--they always show you all these great movement/stretching techniques on someone who is a yogi. Just once I would love to see an extra 20 minutes of video demonstrating what happens when you get an average American who can touch their toes on the table/mat, and how to modify.",1481155200,,656,4.615384615384615
8451107,4,B0050DOGTI,ok,1476662400,,2,2.0
8451108,4,B0050DOGTI,"I have some background in Thai massage - I appreciated this instructional video for doing Thai Massage on the table.  I know most of my clients are not as ""flexible"" as the model they used but it's good to know the range that you are able to take them through. Definitely love the emphasis on ""metta!""",1473033600,,301,4.375
8451109,5,B0050DOGTI,"A great,  basic table routine.",1467417600,,30,5.0

8451111,3,B0050DOGTI,Just another DVD,1457913600,,16,4.666666666666667
8451112,5,B0050DOGTI,"I am a massage therapist who practices Thai massage. I have taken many courses in person and was looking for more techniques for my practice. This video offers good, clear explanations and demonstrations of side lying and sitting Thai massage techniques. They offered really nice self care stretches using your massage table too! The video was clear and well filmed with good voice over for step by step instruction.

I will buy more from Nicole and Heath Reed",1446163200,,460,4.897435897435898
8451113,5,B0050DOGTI,I love the it!!!,1435881600,,16,3.25
8451114,5,B0050DOGTI,"I found the video to be of good quality, peaceful, with instructors that obviously love what they are doing.  As with any bodywork modality, the instructions are to be modified based on the clients' (and therapists') needs, but I thought it was fun and informative, showed some new holds to consider, and another tool for the studio toolbox.",1417824000,,341,4.879310344827586
8451115,4,B0050DOGTI,"Starts off a bit slow with too much chit-chat for my taste.
Gets into self-exercise for the massage therapist - good, but again - too long.
I then wondered ""does this one show massage techniques for us practitioners to work on clients?""
Yes ! It finally got there.  I haven't gotten through to the end yet.  While I appreciate the focus on our own self-care (us massage therapists), it needs to open with an option of where a viewer wants to go.  This one (as I recall) doesn't offer this and we are guided through and don't know the when or what - and have to watch it to find out.  I feel it will eventually be a good value.  Recall some of the techniques 'shown' are filmed from the 'wrong side' so we can't see what the technique or or what the hand/body is actually doing.  I feel these folks are new at creating a DVD of this quality or type - as well, their enthusiasm and integrity is very impressive and offsets most of the annoying aspects; they want to offer useful and healing techniques as well as emphasize how important it is to take care of our own body(ies) while we focus on the well-being of others.  They mean very well and their hearts in in the right place - for sure.  I haven't gotten to the chair part yet.  Overall, one can't go wrong with this one - it is just a bit rough around the edges as these kinds of DVDs go - and that appears to be a lack of experience and/or the lack of professional video makers.",1417305600,3,1434,4.204379562043796
