4982157,4,B006B9XBL4,So cool to see the Special Forces of other countries in a movie.  It's usually just the special units of the US and many times a little hard to believe.  Great action scenes and realistic for today as far as I know.  Not that I've seen action in a few years.  As far as crossing frozen mountains with no specialized gear...........it's a movie.  If I'd wanted a mountain climbing documentary I'd have watched one.  I wanted action and drama.,1350604800,9,441,4.518987341772152
4982158,2,B006B9XBL4,"An article is written by a French journalist named Elsa (Diane Kruger) with the intention of exposing the Pakistani warlord named Zaief (Raz Degan) for what he really is. Seeking retribution for being called ""the butcher of Kabul,"" Zaief captures Elsa and her friend Amen (Mehdi Nebbou) and holds them both hostage. A French Special Forces team lead by Kovax (Djimon Hounsou) is sent in to rescue them, but when a stray bullet severs their only means of communication they find themselves journeying back to Afghanistan on foot.

The French war adventure film opens with what is quite possibly the most ridiculous music to try and accompany soldiers or a war. There are helicopters flying in the air, soldiers scouting out the landscape, and this extremely serious tone but it doesn't feel sincere because Big Audio Dynamite is blaring in the background. It just doesn't seem to fit the tone of the film at all. In the meantime, the rest of the score is completely generic. There's this guitar heavy piece that's used literally every five minutes or so. If the inadequate music wasn't enough, the film is edited like a bad music video with constant quick cuts, flashes of light, and even slow motion.

The first half of the film is nearly unbearable; there's no character development and these really lame attempts at humor. ""We need to be set up at the landing site in an hour and a half."" ""Oh, no time to go shopping then?"" It seems like ""Special Forces"" is just going through the motions at first. It's a rescue mission with no depth, but things begin to turn around once they reach the village. The action picks up and suddenly everyone realizes that, ""Oh crap, we should actually be trying to invest in people's emotions here!""

Diane Kruger has the most draining performance. Elsa is put through hell and you can see the toll it takes on her both physically and emotionally. What's unfortunate about her is that she's so stubborn that it completely voids out rational thinking the majority of the time. She is given at least half a dozen signs and told just as often to leave the country, but decides to stay to try and protect her informer Maina (Morjana Alaoui) even though she never sees her after the opening scene. She's also given a gun by Lucas (Denis Menochet) and is told something along the lines of ""just in case"" and ""you'll never know."" Even when things go south, she's never seen using it. Instead she's given another gun later, which she also doesn't use. So Elsa can be a successful journalist and gain worldwide attention, but can't use basic logic even though her life in addition to eight others depends on it.

Djimon Hounsou has a really passionate performance, as well. He's so devoted to his mission and his men. Benoit Magimel as Tic-Tac is able to add some awkward charm. Raphael Personnaz is the biggest bad ass. The sniper exchange at the village is just insane. Raz Degan is fairly impressive as Zaief. While the character is pretty flat, it does seem like he does the best he can with what's in front of him. His cold eyes accompanied by his loathsome actions cause him to stand out in a sea of mediocrity.

""Special Forces"" is incredibly similar to ""Act of Valor"" in story and tone. On the positive side, ""Special Forces"" doesn't feel as force fed as ""Act of Valor"" and has better, more emotionally charged performances in its second half. It could have been so much more though, especially if the first half of the film was written better and had more depth. You might actually care about the events that unfold in the process. ""Special Forces"" isn't very special at all. Predictable and run of the mill with terrible music and the most generic editing around, ""Special Forces"" feels like it lasts the 11 days it chronicles.",1350172800,2,3761,4.683812405446293
4982159,2,B006B9XBL4,"Who crosses a mountain range in a raging blizard with no winter weather gear in a few days and lives to tell about it, apparently most of the main characters in this film. Aside from that nonsense this film wasn't bad to watch with your finger on the fast forward button. Want to see a more realistic special forces film watch Act of Valor.",1350086400,,340,4.328125
4982160,3,B006B9XBL4,"With an immediate subject matter, stunning locations, and solid acting from an attractive cast including Diane Kruger, Djimon Hounsou, Benot Magimel and cameo Tchky Karyo, a 2011 French movie ""Special Forces"" (""Forces spciales"") has potential for a great action movie, which the film almost is. The film has all the ingredients of a great action film but one: a script.

In ""Special Forces"" Diane Kruger plays a French journalist Elsa, who is kidnapped with her friend Amen (Mehdi Nebbou) by a Taliban leader Ahmed Zaief (Raz Degan) in Afghanistan. To rescue Elisa and Amen, now imprisoned in a fortress in Pakistan, the French government sends out a team of six Special Forces soldiers led by Sgt. Kovax (Djimon Hounsou).

What follows is a standard war action film with fierce combat sequences and heroism. The film's story moves along fast, keeping you interested with decent action set-pieces and impressive aerial shots, but about halfway through the film, where the rescue team encounters an obstacle or two, ""Special Forces"" suddenly gets slower. The French soldiers and freed prisoners have to fight not only the Taliban soldiers chasing them, but the harsh nature of the Afghanistan / Pakistan border.

Some characters are stock types, but the cast has turned in solid performances. The beautiful on-location shots (filmed in Tajikistan and Djibouti) are authentic, lending credibility to the all-too-familiar storyline. Acting and locations aside, however, the film clearly needs improvement, especially its storytelling that tends to be sluggish in the second half of the film. Also, if I am wrong, please correct me, but some part of the story (an elite military team without a backup plan, for instance) seems hardly credible.

All in all ""Special Forces"" is a respectable effort, but does not break any new ground.",1349308800,,1828,5.207482993197279

4982179,4,B006B9XBL4,I did enjoy the movie. The only negatives that distracted was that the title of the movie is Special Forces.

4982191,3,B006B9XBL4,"Yes the movie is in a French, however, I do not think that is where it fell short. It needed more of a plot than just walking with occasional gunfights, frankly, only the Lord of he Rings could pull that off... because the story line and character building. Most of the main characters in this movie are hard to have a connection with due to the limited backstories given. The main antagonist only being a figure for the majority of the movie kind of seemed rushed, much like the middle and ending of the movie. The beginning had me fooled into thinking that there was going to be good writing throughout, but i was mistaken. With little dialogue and predictable points in the movie you can almost imagine how it is going to end from about the second they leave the compound. It's an overused rescuing the damsel in distress then running into problems on the way, kind of movie, but if you are watching for the gunfights and a happy ending go ahead.",1527033600,,949,4.459770114942529
4982192,5,B006B9XBL4,"Five DANGEROUS Stars. The well-made, modern day French war drama, Special Forces, takes the viewer into a wild and dangerous attempted rescue of a war correspondent by a crack globe-trotting French special forces unit in a Middle English eastern setting. In spoken French, English, and Arabic with on-screen subtitles when needed for English speakers, the cast is superb and once the plot gets rolling, the realistic action is non-stop with unexpected and poignant elements, along the way.  BTW, there is a short film clip at the end of the credits. Starring Djimon Hounsou, Diane Kruger, Benoit Magimel, Denis Mnochet, Raphael Personnaz, Alain Figlarz, Marius, Mehdi Nebbou, Raz Degan, Tcheky Karyo, Morjana Alaoui, and more.

4982194,5,B006B9XBL4,"It is a very well made movie. There are a few realism issues but, and this is a very big BUT, you do not need total realism to capture the spirit and feelings that situations and hardship invoke. Sometimes exaggeration is needed to convey to someone, who has never experienced anything close to the story you are trying to tell, the emotions and intensity that people who live through an extended, life threatening situation go through. It wasn't a story of Special Forces just going in and kicking everyone's ass; it is a story of human beings surviving the best they can while carrying out a mission that only most well trained, best, and brightest warriors could have a chance to pull off successfully. If you like war movies with brotherhood and grit then do yourself a favor and give this one a chance.",1526947200,,807,4.611111111111111

The sub-titles interspersed do not take away but make you concentrate more on the movie as it is worth the extra brain power to enjoy a foreign film produced with a talented cast of actors. The cast may not be the US headliners, but if you check out the bio's they will stand on their own by European experience standards. Well shot, excellent audio, and the aviation footage is a treat.

Every single time they get into a gun fight, rock music starts playing and then the soldiers all run out from behind cover and stand in the open facing their enemies while they exchange gun fire.  Often, they firing their weapons from chest height and completely ignore the sights.  It's like you're watching a serious action movie that's trying to achieve some sense of realism, but in every single gun fight the movie goes full Schwarzenegger.  I enjoy a good 1980's bullet spraying action movie as much as anyone, but I'm sure the real French special forces were utterly ashamed of this film. If you enjoy this kind of film purely for the drama, you'll probably like this movie.  If you're looking for a movie with good action sequences, this isn't it.",1512604800,7,923,4.5636363636363635

4982284,5,B006B9XBL4,"Although I am not a film student or have a theatrical background, I am fascinated by the film making process and usually like to see a movie again with a commentary if available. This movie list a making-of featurette, which I assumed was a 15-20 minute short video of how they made Special Forces. Well it turned out it was an hour and a half documentary of how they made the movie and it was even better than a commentary. It covered pretty much every major scene, very cool.

According to the documentary, no cgi at all was used, every shot was done on location, which I was amazed at. The flyover scenes in the snow covered mountains looked surreal, almost fake, but they were the real deal. Explosions, firefights in rugged mountain territory, etc. contained no cgi sfx. Dangerous locations in Afghanistan, high altitude snow covered mountains in France, treacherous dirt road travels in Tajikistan, and desert flatlands in Africa were some of the locales the film making crew including cast went to while making this movie. To appreciate the logistics, the director equated the movie production as a military operation as several embassies and countries were contacted in order to gain permission to enter the country and transporting a movie crew and truckloads of equipment to to remote areas with no literally no roads or airport.

The director was an actor's director, very friendly and patient with everyone, and he explained many facets of the film making process in in several of the scenes they were shooting. Diane Kruger's presence was minimal in the documentary, much of the focus was on the actors portraying the French commando team including their short military training before location filming started.  I was really surprised how emotional the actors would get after their death own scenes, it must be a mix of complicated emotions. Taliban soldiers were locals in Tajikstan they recruited and I thought the interpreter for them looked suspiciously like the stout fighter in Taken 2's last boss fight with Liam Neeson. The Tajikistan countryside was breathtaking and how this area of central Asia lies within the borders of Pakistan, China, and Afghanistan so that was something new I learned. I did not know a country named Tajikstan even existed so now I know. The cinematic highlight of the French snow covered mountains doubled as the Hindu Kush mountain scenes and filming required some unique efforts at the time that had not been attempted before.

So even if did not like the movie, you might appreciate the daunting experience of hundreds in an international community making a movie. This was literally a movie within a movie, like watching reality tv on the Discovery channel on making the hardest movie possible.  Also at the end, they showed the musical artist with the harp and orchestra that made the incredibly stirring music featured in the second half of the movie. The deleted scenes were ok and once you see them you understand why they were edited out of the final cut. The third bonus features Marius, a true French Marine commando veteran, who was one of the operators in the movie's special forces unit and how invaluable his experience helped in the movie.

I did watch the movie twice, once with english dubbing first and the second twice with english subtitles. The dubbing was so-so, but I did not want to miss any of the action by reading subtitles the first time. I liked the subtitled version better hearing the actor's real voices. And the music was incredibly moving in the second half of the movie, it was one of my favorite parts of the movie.",1505260800,,3601,4.856677524429967

Another thing that irks me is the action of the female reporter. She is so selfish that she put her colleague's life in danger. For example, she insisted him to drive to the house of the woman she had just interviewed even though he warned her it would be dangerous.

4982340,5,B006B9XBL4,"It's been a looooong time since I cried watching a movie...and on DVD? Never!!! But this incredible surprise of a French war film caused me to cry. Why? You get so emotionally involved with the characters. You love them. And when they get hurt, or killed as several do, you share in the pain, loss, and heartache.

As a director who is described as ""an actors director"" by the Los Angeles Times, I found the performances top-rate.

In the beginning I was sort of laid back, not too impressed by Diane Kruger nor her journalist character, but she rose triumphant both as a character, journalist and actress...her performance became glowing.

Outstanding performance from veteran Djimon Hounsou (Blood Diamonds)...I didn't know he spoke French fluently. He was powerful. And when agonizes over his buddy getting killed who we as the audience also love, you cannot help but shed tears as well.

Handsome Israeli actor Raz Degan who plays a cold-blooded Taliban overzealous with a chip on his shoulders killer was so convincing he made me shudder. Interesting to note that many Israeli actors are cast as Arabs, i.e., the Arab bandit in THE MUMMY, and Saddam Hussein in the HBO mini-series was played by an Israeli whose family came to Israel from Iraq.

Suffice to say, I was moved, and thrilled by this French made war movie.

Last week I saw Act of Valor which also dealt with Special Forces, US...I bought a copy because the action scenes and characters were terrific. But in comparing that film, Black Hawk Down, this French film rise way above them because it makes you FEEL. And when you feel, you share in the experience that the characters on the screen are going through. And that's cinema at its best.

My screenplay IN MY FATHER'S FOOTSTEPS is like that, and when it gets made with the right cast and director, it will resonate with audiences as well. I just pray it's directed and cast and shot as well as this marvelous film. I also watched EXPANDABLES this week and when I compare the two films, what a piece of garbage that was. I also saw the new Conan, and what trash that was too with all its expensive CGI action. (BTW, in Expendables, the best line is spoken by Schwarzenegger saying about a Smart car: ""My shoe is bigger than this car"". The only amusing line in the film - which does have exciting action).

Talking about action, the French Special Forces has a lotta EXCELLENTLY SHOT action, but even as we're in the midst of the danger and violence, we are still connected emotionally with the characters which we cannot say about most US action films.

Which is why when I run across great films like this French made Special Forces, Silver Lining Playbook, The Fighter, This Is 40, etc., I sing its praises. Special Forces will not make the mega bucks of some of our US made comic book garbage that passes for cinema...and even well intended bores like the pretentious Lincoln that made me fall asleep with its overwrought bedroom melodramatics and over-intellectualized flowered lingo, but I hope people here discover the film and see it

Take my word, you will not be disappointed by this superior feature film of honor, and integrity. Congrats to all who made it including Canal Studio who financed it.

4982345,2,B006B9XBL4,"I gotta give this movie credit for its title.  It's a perfectly accurate representation of this movie:  A bland generic military romp with nothing to make it stand out.  It's just special forces.  That's it.  A simple flick about a mission to go save some reporter who is kidnapped by some bad guy and his army of generic bullet catchers.

Along the way, the team runs into things that are beyond the scope of their mission, but of course they do the right thing and get involved anyway.  Pretty expected fare, but touching all the same.  Beyond that, the acting is pretty good, and the equipment is impressive too.  They certainly are decked out like a special forces squad, with a massive array of rifles, pistols, and machine guns, all of which are heavily utilized.

But what really drags this down is the absurdly unrealistic battle scenes.  Our intrepid special forces members routinely fight out in the open.  They often just stand around in plain sight and blast away hoards of mindless enemies who somehow can't bring themselves to hit these large and easy targets.  I remember one battle involved absolutely no cover whatsoever.  Just this six-man special forces squad standing in open ground in shooting it out with about 50 bad guys and coming out completely unscathed.  The team also seems to fire thousands of rounds from their primary weapons, but hardly ever has to reload (though to their credit it does often show them transitioning to their pistols).

Their rescued reporter also has a pretty dismal role.  She does pretty much nothing of value in the whole operation despite many chances.  Twice she's handed a pistol from one of the soldiers, and does nothing with it either time.  Talk about a letdown.  When I see someone handing her a pistol, I naturally assume it's going to be her time to shine, or that she'll at least attempt to make herself useful, but nope, no point to these scenes at all.

All in all this is pretty much a standard mindless action movie with superhuman heroes vs a mindless hoard of drone enemies who serve no purpose beyond dying en mass.  It's a standard enjoyable fare, just don't expect anything to make this memorable.",1370908800,3,2172,4.736

From there, it's a study of how things can go wrong and how something can turn from bad to worse in the flip of a dime. And from there to a story of survival on the run. Along the way we get to learn more about the soldiers that are fighting and our main heroine Elsa, the writer/journalist.

While some might say that this is just another Rambo type movie I would have to say that they are wrong. This is a movie that is a story about survival and how teamwork can get you through, much like how these Special Operations commandos work.

4982355,3,B006B9XBL4,"I wanted to like this movie.  The acting is good and the photography and scenery are beautiful.  It has some interesting moral ideas and aims to be more than the result.  Diane Kruger is perhaps the most beautiful woman I have ever seen on film.  I don't even like blondes but she is a natural wonder.  She also does a good job with her role.

The main problem is that the main plot device is just totally unrealistic.  The idea that an elite French special forces unit would not have additional methods of communication (flares, smoke grenades, a laser device, even a mirror to signal) and would have a extraction point rendezvous point 20 plus klicks (kilometers) away from the position where they rescued hostages is preposterous.

Another unrealistic aspect of the movie are the gun fights where both groups are standing up firing away when there is available cover.  Also, there are almost no scenes of magazine changes. Plus each SF troop would have had to have an ammo load of 2,000 rounds. One 30 round M-16 magazine weighs about a pound. No one is carrying 70 magazines into combat.  The film did have one realistic thing not seen in most movies and that is the good guys do pick up enemy weapons but they don't collect ammo or magazines.

Act of Valor is not a great movie but it is generally realistic.  If this movie were set in the 70's then the communication failures would be realistic, but not the mission planning and the firefights. The movie also borrows a number of themes and clichs from every war movie from Gunga Din to For Whom the Bell Tolls to Platoon.

The cast, the viewers, and the French military all deserve a better plot and a better movie.  I give it three stars because of the acting and cinematography.",1368057600,,1737,4.561290322580645

Elsa Casanova is a war correspondent caught behind enemy lines in Afghanistan when she's taken hostage --- which is basically her own fault since she went looking for her friend (even though she was warned against it) who was taken hostage (and later killed).  She did not have any assets other than her good looks and that was not enough to prevent her and her companion from being taken hostage and their driver being killed.  Her captors took her to their Pakistan stronghold where they give her the third degree and want her to read a statement.  The French send in a squad of Special Forces to rescue her. However, the helo extraction fails and leaves them with having to trek out on foot.  There is decent action throughout the movie but not of Hollywood quality.  The French have back pack radios (kinda look like ww2 radios) which of course get shot up --- surprised the French don't have satphones or at least compact radios.  Of course they have ""John Wayne"" type guns that never seem to run out of bullets.  The dumb  French let their guard down and are attacked in the streets of a village they are resting in.",1367971200,,1363,4.433734939759036

4982361,3,B006B9XBL4,"I find myself not as interested in war movies these days. This is possibly because of the world we live in, there's so much war on TV that I don't particularly want to be entertained by it. Sometimes they can be pulled off effectively though, and realistically which is both impressive and scary at the same time. Films like Act of Valor and The Hurt Locker of late are examples of films so well done, so believable, that it's almost hard to enjoy. Special Forces could be one such example. Starring Diane Kruger, the film follows a group of special forces operatives in Afghanistan rescuing a journalist. The modern warfare action and real-life scenarios that we see all too much of on the news is plentiful. The drama between the characters makes us care more about what's going on rather than just taking in all of the action. The film was expertly put together as well. For a movie of its kind, it nails most attributes. However, one area that didn't pull me in was the story. The hostage-rescue scenario is quite common for these types of movies, and I didn't see a whole lot here that made it stand out. Had there been a little something unique, this film would easily stand amongst some of the best modern warfare style movies, as just about everything else was nicely executed.

There are no actors you will likely recognize in Special Forces. That shouldnt keep you from watching this mesmerizing film.
It is a French film but the voices English, no subtitles.
A French journalist, Elsa (Diane Kruger) is working on a story about Maina, a woman sold to a man when she was the child, Taliban leader Ahmed Zaief.
Taliban are nortorius for their treatment of women. Women should not appear in the streets without a blood relative and without wearing a Burqa. Women must not speak loudly in public as no stranger should hear a woman's voice. The list goes on and on.
So when Zaief captures Elsa, he finds hes met a woman who will not bow to him. He orders her killed, but with knife to throat, Elsa taunts her captor, saying hes not man enough to watch her being killed. He blinks and lets her live.
He is chastised by those above him for not killing the woman.
In the mean time, French special forces perform a bold reconnassance mission, freeing Elsa and her fellow journalist.
Now Zaief is forced to find and kill all to prove himself.
Set against the harsh background of Afghanistan this small sleeper film is gripping and dramatic, more so than most of its American counterparts.
The film which is based on a true story, shows not only the precise nature of the French Special Forces but also the harsh brutality of Taliban fighters.

4982370,3,B006B9XBL4,"This review is for the English Language version.

Director Stephane Rybojad builds a wide-screen sweeping landscape with travelogue and adventure visuals but rudimentary storytelling and simplistic characters.

""Special Forces"" follows a team of French special operations soldiers of the Brigade des Forces Spciales Terre during a hostage rescue mission to free a captured French journalist. The mission takes a turn for the worst and becomes a survival ordeal that takes the team across the Hindu Kush, a brutal mountain range in northern Pakistan.

The film takes queues from survival classics like ""Touching the Void"" and, while short on dialogue, acting and general story line the visuals make the experience survivable.

If you don't expect too much from ""Special Forces"" beyond a simple survival tale and a good film travelogue you won't be disappointed. It isn't a profound movie, but it is a nice visual experience that pays cool tribute to the French Special Operations teams.",1361318400,2,985,5.335483870967742

This one came through fine, and I continue to use Amazon Prime Movies service, with a cautious recommendation.",1356739200,,530,5.273809523809524
4982377,5,B006B9XBL4,"I am a combat veteran and there are few movies that I can watch due to my PTSD.  However, this one was awesome. Even though it is about French special ops, I have a very warm spot in my heart for all spec ops people. I thought this really gave a realistic portrayal of what it is like. The charachters were human and not just made to look like supermen. This movie will make you laugh and cry and think.  I was kinda leary at first so I didn't get my hopes up but it was a very surprising film.  They did not pull any punches. I got goosebumps during several scenes.",1356652800,9,566,4.035714285714286

4982379,5,B006B9XBL4,"I'll watch just about any movie with a military theme. I wasn't expecting much, and really hate subtitled movies. At least this time the actors mostly spoke in their own languages or at least that of their characters (French special forces and Afghani civilians and Taliban). Some speak occasionally in English - and of course the English is subtitled as well - in English! And I found myself reading the English subtitles as well. LOL! I didn't mind paying for the rental, but if you're uncertain about this one, and you have Netflix, get it that way. I thoroughly enjoyed this one, partly because I was expecting something a lot worse - think SciFy-level quality, but this was far better.",1356307200,,690,4.758333333333334
4982380,3,B006B9XBL4,"The movie itself is a generic ""war/hostage"" movie. The editing is overly choppy in some places. The scenery is gorgeous though, and I am not just talking Raphael Personnez and Denis Menochet. The mountains were nice too.",1356307200,,220,4.972972972972973
4982381,4,B006B9XBL4,"This was an honest attempt at making a movie that was not all flash, bang.  And there were some very nice moments.  The movie gave the actors a vehicle to, at times, give some very fine performances.",1356134400,,199,4.351351351351352
4982382,4,B006B9XBL4,"This was a surprisingly well made movie.  Often times these types of films are hastily made and low budget.  This film was well acted and most of the dialogue was in fact in english.  Although I am not well-versed in French equipment and tactics, it seemed fairly authentic.  Diane Kruger is always pleasant to watch.",1355788800,,317,4.709090909090909
4982383,5,B006B9XBL4,"Filmed with the incredible reality of professional soldiers in war and in the same vein as 'Tears of the Sun' (2003) and more recently 'Act of Valor' (2012). This was made possible because of the assistance provided by the French armed forces with equipment and expertise. French journalist Elsa (Kruger) and her local colleague Amen (Nebbou) are following a story in Afghanistan when they are abducted by Taliban leader Ahmed Za (Degan) and taken to his hidden fortress in Pakistan. Faced with Elsa's imminent execution, a French special forces unit is dispatched to free her.

Commander Kovax (Hounsou) and his team of SF soldiers are completing the final part of their mission when they react against the cruelty of the Taliban against local villagers who had aided the French soldiers. The team then miss their RV and play a cat-and-mouse game with their pursuers through a harsh mountainous region to complete their mission and avoid death at the hands of either man or the elements.

4982386,5,B006B9XBL4,"This is not your 80's Delta Force or another round of the Expendables.  This is more of a modern war movie /rescue mission involving the French army's special forces.  War is ugly and much of that is portrayed in this movie even though the director took care of not being too graphic.  This movie relies on a fictional storyline, which I would agree with the other reviewers has been used before.  But the acting was excellent throughout.  The sets and the characters felt real.  The photography was beautiful.  This is also a French movie.  If you understand French, you will enjoy the joking and endearing terms the soldiers give each other.  I felt the movie was pretty gut wrenching at times and the directing was smooth and smart.  No, it's not as gritty as the Hurt Locker.  It has more of action movie flow, but it is a good compromise.  Other reviewers have mentioned it, but there is definitely a sense of homage and respect paid here to all the servicemen and servicewoman that have served all over the world.  All in all, I really enjoyed the movie. Thought I'd share the review and maybe someone else will pick up this little Friday night gem.

4982387,3,B006B9XBL4,"Like most Special Forces these men have talent and with most operators it is simply in the genes. like a musician, sculptor, and painter, they are true artisans of their field. It is not the country and unit that failed to pull me in, It was the movie. I am a fan of Djimon Hounsou and the other leading actors but I just couldn't get past the dubbing over voices. If they are speaking a different language then subtitle it but subtitle everyone not just the main characters. you can hear the French in the background but not its translation so instead of becoming entranced by the complete situation in detail you are left with quite a two dimensional understanding. What I enjoy about movies are the details your mind puts together to draw a emotional response and this film fell short for me.",1353110400,4,795,4.527777777777778

4982390,5,B006B9XBL4,"I have not seen any movies of the French military's role until this movie.  It is about a rescue mission by the French Special Forces.  I found the story line very good in pulling in the (at least) two different ways the Muslim faith is lived among the Muslim community, the way women are treated in the Muslim community and the great courage and warrior training that the French Special Forces live by.  Great line of action to see along with a great amount of things to think about in the crisis between the Muslim community of Pakistan and the Western community of heros just as fervent about how to live life as the Muslim communities' views.",1351296000,9,646,4.504273504273504

The way these guys love their job and support each other makes me want to inprove more on my work ethics and reminds me to always do what I love. Never loose hope or faith... injured, tired, hungry, walking for days yet they still believed all hope was not lost.

8495951,4,B006B9XBL4,"I look for action movies to watch while I'm on my elliptical walker, because I tend to run subconsciously during fight scenes.  LOL!  This movie was perfect for that.  What fascinated me about it, though, was the similarities between the French depiction of their Special Forces and military as compared to the US depiction of our Special Forces and military.  If not for the French language,  I would have thought that this movie was made in the US about a US military mission.  A US Army veteran recently told me that he'd been deployed all around the world, and one thing he learned that was despite differences in language and customs and dress, we are all the same.  Now I see what he meant.

The only reason I didn't give this 5 stars is because I compare all movies to ""Deadpool"" and ""The Greatest Showman"".  Those are my 5 star references.  To give it a 4 star means A) I will DEFINITELY watch it again, and B) it is a movie that I will think about from time-to-time for many, many years.",1528502400,,996,4.423076923076923
