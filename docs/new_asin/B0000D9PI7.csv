I'm an avid independent movie watcher but this one is exceptional in the making, cinematography, and casting.  The story blew me away and the emotions that ran through the screen were quite something extraordinary. Watch it, you won't be disappointed.",1375833600,,346,5.035087719298246

8000156,2,B0000D9PI7,"I ordered this movie as a gift for my cousin. She watched it, didn't care for it and sent it to me to watch.  I didn't care much for it either.  I had to really force myself to watch it to the end.

It is nice to see a film about Armenians, especially one where the characters are speaking Armenian.  Other than that, I found the storyline terrible at best, mediocre acting, with very little insight of life in Armenia either before or after independence.  If one gauged life in Armenia from this film, it would seem that all people did there was to sit around a table and eat all day long.

Except for a couple of outside shots, the film could have been  made entirely in a film studio, anywhere. I found viewing another relative's collection of digital photos from a recent trip to Armenia, much more interesting and enlightening.",1145836800,2,832,4.434210526315789
8000157,5,B0000D9PI7,"This DVD was the first Armenian patriotic movie I had seen in years, mixed with social and romantic events in an environment of excellent cinematography and appropriate screenplay with the right flavored talented actors. Armenian nation needs more similar movies for the younger generations raised and born outside of Armenia.",1077926400,4,326,5.54
8000158,5,B0000D9PI7,"I love this movie. The story is set in 1991 and is about Eve, a photojournalist who is sent from New York  to her native Armenia, where political changes are rapidly occurring and the country is moving toward independence.
In the process of covering the events for her magazine, Eve comes to terms with herself and falls in love.
I highly recommand this film.
A Must Have DVD!",1076889600,8,376,4.529411764705882
