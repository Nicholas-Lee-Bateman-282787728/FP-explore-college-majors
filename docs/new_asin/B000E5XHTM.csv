8106256,5,B000E5XHTM,Now this is fun! I have always been a huge fan of kettlebell training and consider myself as an advanced kettlebell user. Doing 100+ swings or long cycle workouts can be very boring. H2H keeps it entertaining and really works hand eye coordination. This is a great KB training video for those days where you want a break from mundane KB circuits.,1465171200,,346,4.596774193548387
