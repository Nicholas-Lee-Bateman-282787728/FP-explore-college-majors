3820145,5,B001V9K8JC,"After catching some of this on the history channel, I knew I had to have it.  I love this kind of stuff.  The science of how things work combined with how they can fail... blended in with a whopp upside the head of ""look at how much we effect the world around us"".  It's very cool.  Great learning tool for kids too.  The special effects are very well done, the information is sound.  It's fun to watch.",1265328000,,403,4.1688311688311686
3820146,3,B001V9K8JC,"What would happen to all the great works of the human race if there were no one to maintain them?
It is an interesting idea for a documentary and I can`t find much to fault in their conclusions. Nature, and life itself are very
rough on everything in the long term either natural or man made.
The reason I only gave it three stars instead of four or five is that it presents the same thing over and over again. It is
interesting to know what lack of maintainence will do to a suspension bridge over a couple of hundred years, but there really
isn`t any significant difference between what happens to such a bridge in San Francisco, New York, or Michigan. Same holds true
with most tall buildings, homes, ect.
More than half of each episode is basicly a repete of the others in a different location. Granted, there are some differences in
how things will fall into disrepair in a desert as opposed to a wet climate, but not as much as you might think.
The series is worth watching, but they should have found more things to examine than going over the same things again and again.",1259971200,12,1079,4.4

3820148,5,B001V9K8JC,"This is an absolutely fascinating show that I think anyone interested in anthropology, really any type of science or humanities would love. It illustrates with astonishing detail all of the mechanisms humans build and use in order to co-exist with nature. And what would happen once humans are gone and they can no longer maintain structures and buildings, trim down kudzu and vacuum up sand to artificially build up beaches around the Hamptons, among many other examples. It is an absolutely intriguing and unforgettable series and I'd recommend it to anyone.",1255392000,12,560,5.164835164835165
3820149,5,B001V9K8JC,"The basic premise of Life After People is that humans are suddenly gone and it doesn't matter how such a disappearance happens.  The movie explores the question of how long would it take the physical remains of human presence to completely disappear and/or be transformed.

The movie particularly resonated with me because I have often wondered the same thing.  I have even done sketches of, say, the Statue of Liberty toppled over and half-covered with sand, or Big Ben in London halfway submerged, or the Golden Gate Bridge collapsed.  I supposed that this line of thought was inspired by my observations, over the years, of the ruins of ancient civilizations, coupled with the realization that nothing lasts forever, leading to speculation as to what might the ruins of our current civilization look like.

Life After People is, above all, an excellent presentation of entropy in action.",1252454400,11,890,5.068493150684931
3820150,4,B001V9K8JC,"This is a great series.  I saw the original show which has now been turned into this series (which has been shown on TV).  What this does is to raise up your imagination to think on a larger scale about the future.  What if so many of our leading scientists are right?  What if we are creating a global disaster in environmental terms?  This shows what the world will look like if all the human arrogance fails.  You must remember that this series is not very likely from a scientific point of view.  Sadly, humans will take a larger part of other living things with them if they really make a mess of things.  However, what this series does do is make you think about time.  The world, nature, is five billion years old.  People have been here for a mere 30,000 years.  The suicide of our species is a real possibility, although not in the exact manner shown in this series.

3820179,5,B001V9K8JC,The 'Life After People' series is altogether fascinating.  It is one of those ideas that seldom come along.  I probably re-watch the series once a month.,1417392000,,153,4.846153846153846
3820180,3,B001V9K8JC,"I originally watched this series when it was available as an instant view in HD on Netflix. I was fascinated with it. The fact that it was taken down led me to buying the DVD. As was said in another review, the series season 1 does not seem to be available on Blu-Ray. Not only that, but it seems that at the time of this writing that both seasons are now out of print with Season 1 being more rare, causing this Season 1 DVD to actually be more expensive than the Season 2 Blu-Ray! To me that is absurd,  because the transfer quality of this product is sorely lacking in comparison to Season 2's Blu-Ray.
This season 1 DVD set has black bars on the top & bottom AND sides of the screen and has very low quality audio compared to Season 2's Blu-Ray. I own other DVD's that will play upscaled on my Blu-Ray player to look VERY close to Blu-Ray quality, such as Legend of the Seeker, which is unavailable on Blu-Ray. Unfortunately the history channel did a cheap transfer with this series' DVD version. It makes me wonder if it's on purpose, because its so simple to just have the picture fill up the screen like every other series on DVD is!",1416700800,,1140,4.277777777777778

3820185,5,B001V9K8JC,"Love this series, a thought provoking look at just how insignificant we are in the scheme of things; and just how quickly the earth will purge all traces of our existence in a relative short amount of time.

Now about the availability, this is where I am puzzled. The premiere episode and season 2 are readily available with both DVD and blu ray formats to pick from. Why is season 1 in DVD format only and so limited in its availability? I paid $40 for this out of fear that once it is gone it will never be seen again. I just can't figure out why History Channel is snuffing out this title. I looked on their website to see if a blu ray was available and I couldn't even find the title for this release anywhere. Again, why?",1399939200,4,726,4.223021582733813
3820186,1,B001V9K8JC,"Life After People was a great idea for a movie special on the History Channel, but Life After People: The Series - The Complete Season One is not such a great idea. For indiscriminate folks who still like to see buildings crumble - we'll see how many viewers Emmerich's 2012 brings in - this series blandly fills that need. It's full of experts explaining exactly why those buildings eventually fall, and other stuff happens too; animals run rampant and stuff explodes. Ultimately, it's an incredibly repetitive series that becomes tedious quite quickly on DVD. It may fill a need once in a while, but as far as this set is concerned, structural entropy dictates you skip it.",1391904000,,675,4.777777777777778

These are all What if's but fun to watch if something like this would happen. The only thing I do not like is how fast some scenes switch from one topic to another on some of the programs shown. They talk or show something then suddenly switch to something else which is distracting and takes away from enjoying the scene you were currently watching.",1391558400,,558,4.214953271028038

I wanted to buy this program (Season One) on blu ray, but it is not available in blu ray format.

not worth it if you prefer close captioned or subtitle.

History Channel...get with the program and add all caption/subtitle to all your title which was captioned on TV to begin with. Why eliminate caption/subtitle from DVD?",1303257600,4,436,4.345679012345679

3820203,2,B001V9K8JC,"While the idea is a good one, the execution is long tedious and boring. Alan Weisman's 2007 book The World Without Us pretty much kick started this whole speculative idea of the Green Apocalypse and is a much better source to get both the information and entertainment from.
I really don't know why the producers stretched this out over so many hours of episodes when you can pretty much wrap up the entire idea in a 2 hour feature.
Even the first episode feels drawn out. For example the point of episode one is to speculate on what happens to the human remains after we are gone. Sounds interesting right? Not after a few minutes when we realize the episode is NOT discussing the mounds of rotting human corpses left behind from some sort of mass genocide that would make the population zero but talks of mummies in museums and frozen bodies left in cryo as living humans magically vanish and there is no one left to keep the lights on. Even that somewhat interesting fact fails to warrant 43 minutes of TV time so what do they do. We spend some time talking about the Sistine Chapel, wooden ships in Boston, abandoned islands around Japan, Bridges, Guano, Parrots...
I have no idea what any of that had to do with human remains left behind after the population is reduced to zero.
Surely the speculation concerning the decaying corpses of 6 - 8 billion people laying in streets and houses across the planet will be much more interesting. Maybe new organsims that feed off the bacteria that decays human flesh will flourish and result in a new and complex food chain with human corpses being the base or progenitor.
 In fact what the first episode actually does is just cover a lot of other questions you would ask on the subject. because of this I'm not sure what the other 5 discs, 2 seasons and 19 episodes and 800+ minutes cover.

I already spent a weekend out of my life with Alan Weisman's book so there is no way the pilot episode for this series convinced me to dedicate 800+ minutes more of my life to revisit what I already read.",1295136000,5,2041,4.498652291105121

3820205,3,B001V9K8JC,"The concept is fascinating; the production good; and, in my opinion, the emphasis wrong.  A production that emphasizes the dissolution of buildings and monuments grows old--quick.  Yes, given enough time and without people to repair them, manmade structures ultimately turn into dust.  No great insight.  Should the human race suddenly disappear, for whatever reason, most cities and towns would largely burn to the ground in a few weeks or years.  Fires would start from equipment suddenly untended and fires would start from natural events like lightning and other forms of natural combustion.  Gutted buildings would be weakened and many would collapse rather quickly.

Still this isn't very interesting.  More interesting would be the adaptation of animals and plants following human departure.  Would dogs and cats continue to live on indefinitely as feral species or would they ultimately go on to extinction because of more efficient wild competitors?  What about cattle, horses, goats and sheep?  Would any of them make it for long?  Yes, horses have gone 'wild' in many parts of the West but, thus far, few have been exposed to truly effective predators like wolves.

How about animals that escape from the untended zoos?  Would lions, tigers, leopards and snow leopards become new native mammals?  Why or why not?  Would bison again roam the plains in their millions?  Would African and Asian elephants find a permanent home in the Americas?  Why or why not?  Would cheetahs again pursue pronghorn antelope?  Would eland and kudu browse the brushlands of America?

What about the seas?  Which plants and animals there would thrive and which could be expected to go on to extinction in the absence of Man?  On land, which plants and animals, wild and domestic, would suffer reductions or extinctions without the protective influence of Man?  Which creatures would greatly increase in numbers with Man gone?  Like I say, the crumbling of buildings isn't very interesting.

It would have been interesting to discuss some of the ways Man could go to extinction leaving his structures intact?  Warfare?  Obviously not.  Disease?  Much better possbility.  What if the HIV virus, for instance, mutated and became highly infective via airborne transmission?  In that the HIV virus usually produces no symptoms for approximately 9 years, the possibilities are horrific.  The virus is nearly 100% fatal [antivirals give some item of hope in developed countries] and, with an incubation period of 9 years, virtually everyone on earth could be infected before our medical scientists discovered that we were at the edge of an abyss.

Great idea and presentation although I am not sure how many seasons they can keep the show fresh.

The original 90 minute show and Series One in very interesting as they show how time, nature and elements reclaim signs of man's civilization ranging from private homes, monuments, grocery stores, shopping malls, famous monuments, amusement parks, nuclear power plants, urban cities like New York, etc....

But after awhile of course this must become a bit repetitive because there is a limit to the variety of ways nature, insects, animals, rust, rot, corrosion and vegetation will cover signs of our existence.

I am buying the original special and first season DVD for sure... they are THAT GOOD !

But my gut feel is this will be a 2-3 Season show at best.

I think it is a great idea that is well done, but I don't know how much you can do with it after 2-3 Seasons.

Maybe they will have a ""Return of People"" series, where they try to show how man would try to rebuild human society in this scenario 3000 years down the road after a long absence on the planet with much information lost to the ages and us needing to rediscover many scientific advances.",1266624000,,1271,4.626666666666667
