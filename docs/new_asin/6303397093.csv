638612,4,6303397093,"I very much enjoyed the movie for reasons that I can relate to the stress military life brings to a family.  My husband is active duty Army & our family has endured the moves to various places much like the ones depicted in the film.  I can relate to Jessica Lange's character, because I know how challenging it is to try and make inadequate housing feel like a cozy home.  It can definitely bring out the *crazy* in any sane person!
I feel both Tommy Lee Jones & Jessica Lange gave stellar performances in this film!!",1070928000,10,518,4.375
638613,5,6303397093,"This story brings home the conflicts, stress, emotions, and hardships of being a family in the Army. (A situation I am glad I never endured) An emotional and sexually charged wife of a career military man trying to deal with family, loneliness, and the stress of moving alot and her adoring, but career minded husband.
Her sexuality and infidelity strain the marraige and he is torn between his morals and ability to do his job, and keep his family together. Emotionally riveting!!",1002672000,4,481,4.878048780487805
638614,5,6303397093,"When Jessica Lange won the Best Actress Oscar for this film, few people in the USA had even seen it.  For one, its release had been held up for several years and it sat gathering dust in its film cans in the studio.  Her Oscar win though finally made many scurry to the theaters to see it.  Lange plays a military wife to Tommy Lee Jones' career military man.  They have 2 children and have followed him from base to base.  What absolutely defines Lange's character though is a combination of constant sensuality with a personality that totters on the edge of breakdown.  She is hot for her husband, Jones, but she also acts like a sexual lodestar to other men.  Her very presence on a military base can cause incredible unrest among the other husbands and wives.  I wish Lange and Jones always had screenplays this good to devote their talents.  Often, their talents are wasted on less well written and directed works.  If you have overlooked this character-driven masterpiece of acting, don't overlook it any longer.

638615,4,6303397093,The acting of both leads in Blue Sky is magnificent. The result is a genuinely touching love story. Some plausibility is lost when the conspiracy plot kicks in; at this point you may get the impression that  quality was to some degree limited by budget.

638741,4,6303397093,"I went into Blue Sky with a certain level of caution; military romance movies are notoriously saccharine. I was afraid it might be another cliche look at uninteresting characters involved in the military, but I was very surprised with how much I liked it. Blue Sky is a very genuine story about loving people for who they are, and not by what they do, even if they are emotional wrecks or make poor choices. If you love someone, just love them.

Good acting from all, Tommy Lee Jones and Jessica Lange were perfect in their roles, they make a great pair together. Powers Boothe turned in a fine supporting performance, and a wonderful surprise performance from the elusive and mysterious Carrie Snodgress, who felt a little underused if you ask me... Writing was very good, with a standout monologue from Jones about water; a very memorable scene. Music was good, I really loved the addition of the bass guitar.

What I enjoyed most about Blue Sky was its refusal to be like other romance-military movies; although it follows the formula, the story went in different places that were truly and refreshingly unexpected. It felt almost realistic. The characters were not mean-spirited. It wasn't too dark, and actually, there were a few moments with great humor. The scene with the grenade is absolutely hysterical! The movie never seemed to take itself too seriously, which is so nice.

All in all, it's not a perfect movie, but I liked Blue Sky a lot more than I was expecting to, and I'd feel good recommending to just about anyone looking for a nice, fluffy(but not too fluffy) romance movie. Solid, enjoyable filmmaking; 8/10. Great for couples who have been together a long time and put up with their sweetheart's bulls&@# with a roll of the eyes and a begrudging smile.",1457568000,3,1774,4.771986970684039

638765,3,6303397093,"The plot has been discussed on here by several people so I won't get into that. I have to say, the reason I purchased this film, having never seen it, is because of Jessica Lange. She is my favorite actress and she doesn't disappointed in this movie. I don't believe it's her best performance, but of course still wonderful. She is one of the few actresses that you just KNOW is giving it her all 100% of the time.  Tommy Lee Jones is also excellent in ""Blue Sky"" and I can't say I've really been a big fan of his. That being said, I honestly didn't enjoy this movie very much. I think it was worth seeing once, but the plot just isn't all that exciting and it takes a long time before the movie really gets anywhere. I just wasn't impressed with the story, in fact, I found it rather boring. When the movie ended I had the feeling I hadn't seen a movie that amounted to much, and I rarely have that take away...even from movies that everyone considers ""bad"". The blu-ray, however, has excellent picture and audio quality!
 Just a word of caution to people who are new to this film. Proceed with caution.",1432166400,,1104,4.328502415458937

638769,5,6303397093,"I never understood why this movie never got the praise it deserves. It did win awards and was nominated for many awards, but it seemed to vanish after that. I feel this is a movie with stunning acting by a wonderful cast of performers. The direction I feel is solid. The story is dramatic and most of all a drama that lingers on the watcher long after it is over. This stars one of the greatest female actresses ever to grace cinema. Her passion and extraordinary ability to bring characters to life, shine in any role she does no matter of TV or feature film. I speak about, none other than, the beautiful, vibrant, sexy and stunning Jessica Lange. A pivotal actress in cinema history. She owns the character of Carly Marshall in this period piece drama. Like always, Lange is able to place you in the situation through her dramatic, emotional reality on screen. She is able to bleed perfection and give off the vibe, that her plight is real.

Next up that makes this film shine would have to be, the brilliant actor Tommy Lee Jones. What can be said, that has not already been said about this master talent of acting? Jones is an actor that is what I call real. He is a man. Not a shining boy toy of Hollywood, or a fabricated reality of cinema, but just a man. He is a real actor. He is in the class and category of Clint Eastwood, George C. Scott and all those men, men actors. Jones just like Lange, brings reality to his character of Hank in Blue Sky.

I think that is what stands out the most in this film is the chemistry between each performer. Jones and Lange play off each other, as if you and I the watcher are going through it. The acting, solid direction, and story all become real. The cinematography is eye opening. The story gives vibes of history and struggle.

The awesome and amazing Powers Booth plays the character Vince in Blue Sky. Booth has always been a wonderful performer, and always comes across as professional and real in his parts, and the character of Vince is no different. Also the very talented and beautiful Carrie Snodgress plays the part of Vera. She is always a treat to see perform.

638819,5,6303397093,"Jessica Lange won an Academy Award for her performance in this movie.
She plays the role of a 'bi-polar' housewife who is fixated on famous movie stars.
She has NUMEROUS BREAKDOWNS during the course of this movie.
Tommie Lee Jones plays the role of an 'enabler'; consistently excusing her behavior based on a highly charged (and perhaps) dysfunctional sexual relationship.
I have never seen a better performance out of her other than co-starring with Tommy Lee Jones in the AUTHENTIC PERFORMANCE written by Tennessee Williams as 'Maggie The Cat' on the ""remake"" of CAT ON A HOT TIN ROOF.
She blows Elizabeth Taylor away.
It was said many years ago in VANITY FAIR that the camera LOVES HER.
And her being cast as the lead actress in AMERICAN HORROR STORY is something that we should all be grateful for.

639021,4,6303397093,"Shot in the Fall/Spring of 1989-90, ""Blue Sky"" wasn't actually released until 1994. The story involves a military family in the early 60s who move to an Alabama base. The wife (Jessica Lange) is erratic & bipolar and behaves like a loony Marilyn Monroe while the husband (Tommy Lee Jones) is unshakably faithful. The two daughters lament their mother's disorder, but the family's strong nevertheless. When the father goes to Nevada to work with bomb testing the commander of the base (Powers Boothe) has his eyes on the sexpot wife.

I don't follow film awards, but Jessica won an Oscar for her performance as the hysterical wife and she deserved it. For this reason many hail the first two acts of the film, and Tommy Lee as well. Unfortunately, her character comes across as unlikable and even scary. You start to feel sad for the daughters!

Some people criticize Boothe as being too dastardly of a villain. Don't believe it. Do these critics really think there aren't any high-ranking military personnel with a Genghis Khan complex? Men who think they're above the rules and can get away with anything their arrogant butts' desire? Boothe's character comes across as a solid military leader who's tempted by a subordinate's sultry wife and then does everything he can to save himself. This type of behavior is older than David and Bathsheba.

Some complain about how unbelievable the last act is. Two things: (1.) This is a movie and movies always amp up the dramatics. The filmmakers essentially have to do this because, well, it's a movie and they only have 2 hours to tell the story. (2.) Besides, the film's making a point about Lange's character and it's important to the story. ***SPOILER ALERT*** It shows that, as erratic and unlikable as she is in the first two acts, she redeems herself in the final act by literally risking everything for her husband. It's a powerful and necessary point. ***END SPOILER***

This is also a good film about life on a military base, like ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Great-Santini/dp/0790742799/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Great Santini</a>"" with some similarities to ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Desert-Bloom/dp/B000085EFF/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Desert Bloom</a>"", albeit not quite as good as either.

The film was shot in Selma, Alabama, Florida and El Paso, Texas. It runs 101 minutes.

The movie begins with pictures of women in magazines. Helicopters fly over a beach where a lone woman gets a tan. Then we see men in protective gear on sandy soil picking up small metallic rods. Major Henry Marshal has an attitude, his wife is from Virginia. We see an old Studebaker taxi, and a woman who enjoys attention. [The automobiles are from the late 1950s.] The couple arrive at a new army post. Will they fit in? They have two teenage girls. The wife has emotional problems. [Does she blame others for her problems?] Suitcases spill out of the back of a station wagon. ""Are you OK, dear?"" Carly sees radiation on her husband. ""Mom is tired, she needs a little rest."" The daughters recognize the problem. ""You're right, Dad."" Carly has a doll collection. Is her memory plastic? Carly returns with gifts. There is an outdoor garden party. How to keep looking young?

There is a reference to the proposed nuclear underground testing ban. ""Its only make believe"" sings the band. Carly has another problem. ""An exceptional woman."" Can Henry cool off Carly? ""She had an accident."" Are they fighting to make up afterwards? A new nuclear test presents a crisis, Henry goes away for two weeks. Playing with a found grenade is a bad decision. [Is this credible?] They are caught. The underground test releases a lot of radiation. Two men on horseback intrude into the area. ""It's a crime."" Carly dances at a rehearsal. Is it too risqu? ""Zip me up."" [Its easy to predict a bad ending to this story.] The older daughter dials her Dad so her Mom can tell all. The other officer's wives gossip about Carly. There is a conflict between Major Marshal and Colonel Johnson. [Is this believable?] Carly gets hurt. ""Hank is in big trouble.""

Carly needs Henry. Can he be helped out of all this? Was it due to stress? A court-martial would be a disaster. Colonel Vincent Johnson gives an order. Carly and her daughters visit Henry, who is sedated like the other patients. Carly creates an incident at a parade. ""Is craziness inherited?"" Carly opens a locked briefcase then takes her girls on an early morning trip across country. She wants to make a fuss, but those two ranchers don't' agree with her. Carly leaves the motel to return to the ranch. A lone rider is at the test site! She is arrested, reporters see this. What will they do with her? Television news reports on Carly - the usual story from a press release. There is a shake-up at the army post. Henry is out of the hospital and the Army. ""Are you happy?"" Henry will become a Professor at a university in California. [Is this the end of their problems?]

This could have been a better drama with a better and credible story. A military officer who questions the nuclear testing program? Personal conflicts between officers? An officer's wife who doesn't fit in? Changing attitudes and policies in the early 1960s? Suppose this movie used nerve gas testing instead of the nuclear bomb testing? I wonder if the reason for this movie was to create the worst movie that would still return a profit at the box office from those who go to any movie each weekend? Does this movie show Hollywood's opinion about their audiences?",1321315200,,3193,4.646017699115045

I was somewhat confused at first and didn't pick up on all the nuances of the script/plot and therefore, I opted to watch the film a second time, paying closer attention to detail and the motivation of the characters and ALL aspects of the intense plot. It was well worth the second watch! Lange definately deserved the Oscar for this performance but, I still can't believe that THIS is the film she finally gets the Oscar for! Oh well... a good performance deserves the kudos it gets and her incredible sexual smoldering in this film kept it interesting and is a good portrayal of what a wife will do when she's left to her own devices too often. No matter what anyone else says about the plot, it was pretty much how I remember the time that the film is set in, including the state of treatment for mental illnesses (the film doesn't pretty them up or horrify them like some do...it's pretty much just the facts, here), the nuclear issue, and the beginings of the era of free love and open sexuality...and so for that reason, I really enjoyed the film that much more. The main issue here is the incredible script, cinematography, and performances! Jones and Lange showed the deep down, dirty, gritty, fire and emotion that both of these fine, high caliber actors are capable of and I'm surprised that Tommy Lee Jones didn't take home a few awards for this film, himself. Also, what an incredible supporting cast! More like an ensemble....Chris O'Donnell, Carrie Snodgrass, Powers Boothe and the likes all turn in performances worthy of their abilities. This film is destined to be a cult classic favorite by most film buffs and historians as well as fans of the members of the cast and crew but, none the less, I'd put it high on a list of ""must be watched or mandatory viewing"" films.",1265328000,2,2001,4.607843137254902

639101,5,6303397093,"The a-bomb that Hank Marshall (Jones) has to inspect or his marriage to tempestuous Carly (Lange).  Carly ran away from her home in Virginia because she 'wanted paradise.'  When Carly's topless sunbathing gets the Marshalls busted from Hawaii to Alabama, their marriage goes on the rocks.

Carly's badly unstable.  We'd call her bipolar today. Her mood swings go from effervescent highs to devastating lows that frighten the two Marshall kids.

Hank describes Carly like 'water.'  Sometimes, she's  flowing and sometimes she's like ice.  The kids describe them 'he's blind and she's crazy.'

Matters go from bad to worse when Colonel Vincent Johnson (Boothe) gets interested in Carly and transfers Hank to Nevada bomb tests.  This project ""Blue Sky"" is going to be an aboveground test since the Soviets have detonated a bomb aboveground and we have to stay ahead in the arms race.

You'd think it's a rotten marriage and in some ways you'd be right, but when a test goes awry and the military wants to cover it up Carly is there for Hank.  Jessica Lange won an Oscar for her role in this film, but Jones deserves accolades as well for his elegant, understated role as a science-minded military man.

639159,3,6303397093,"This movie is bizarre and out of whack, because it tries to fit a fascinating, Tennessee Williams-style character study into a tired, cliched paranoid conspiracy story.  But the movie is worth watching for its first half, when the focus is on the sexy, needy and dysfunctional marriage between the stolid, ambitious military engineer played by Tommy Lee Jones, and his attention-getting, Marilyn Monroe-like wife, played by Jessica Lange.

Both Jones and Lange are excellent. Their characters have many responsibilities:  their children, their reputations at the military base, the protection of the Free World.  But the actors convince you that they would throw all of that over, temporarily, for each others' hot love.  But once you understand that, the filmmakers insert these great characters into a predictable, hackneyed plot that draws on ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest,"" ""Silkwood"" and the entirity of Oliver Stone's career.

The hinge for all this is a very unwise sexual encounter between Lange's character and Jones' Evil Boss. The Evil Boss, played by Powers Boothe, is a real Snidely Whiplash.  From the first moment you see him, you know he's just a dastardly fellow without a conscience. Boo! Hiss!  By having sex with this Bad Man, and then believing another obvious lie he tells her, Lange unwittingly aids in the coverup of a nuclear accident, which she then must go to preposterous lengths to expose in order to save her husband from having his mind stolen from him by the Evil Boss.

Some have wondered why this movie sat on the shelf for several years before being released, given that it won Lange an Academy Award.  The answer's obvious; the plot is an embarrassing joke.  But we should be glad it got released. Lange's performance is stunning, and Jones' is not far behind her. It's hard work to suspend disbelief through this story's many dumb moments (do you really think a lifelong army brat would pull the pin on a grenade and then casually toss it to her boyfriend?), but it's worth trying to, just to appreciate Jones and Lange's acting.",1107820800,24,2069,4.9508670520231215
639160,4,6303397093,"It's not always true, of course, but very often the Academy Awards'  ""Best Actress"" category proves one of the hardest to handicap, and therefore one of the most interesting.  The nominees in this category are frequently from ""smaller"" films, and are ofttimes the best thing about the movie.  Sure Jodie Foster's second win was for a commercial and critical blockbuster (SILENCE OF THE LAMBS), but her first Oscar for the less heralded THE ACCUSED, which many critics found to be seriously flawed and wasn't exactly a runaway hit at the box office, but damned if she didn't earn that Oscar.  She was riveting in that film.

Almost a decade later, Jessica Lange performed a similar achievement and walked off with an Academy Award for a ""smallish"" film that almost never saw the light of day. BLUE SKY, director Tony Richardson's final film, has powerful performances by Lange and Tommy Lee Jones (as her beleaguered husband) and a solid supporting cast is solid), but it suffers from a somewhat rickety storyline that gets increasingly implausible as the film goes on.

Much of the movie is devoted to Hank and Carly Marshall's complex and largely dysfunctional family life, and those scenes are certainly compelling.  The dynamic between Jones' solid, supportive Hank and Lange's vulnerable Carly is somewhat reminiscent of  that of  Peter Falk and Gena Rowlands in Cassavetes A WOMAN UNDER THE INFLUENCE.  But BLUE SKY'S mad scene seems a little rushed--heck, it's not even ten minutes into the movie.  If Carly's going to break down by that point, we're either in for a lengthy psychodrama, or a sharp divergence in the plot.

Turns out it's the latter.  What some have described as the film's nuclear coverup subplot pretty much becomes the main plot by the movie's end, serving to provide Carly a chance to find her own strength and to come to the rescue of her man.  Tricked by Hank's villainous commanding officer (the ever sinister Powers Boothe) into having her husband institutionalized, Carly can only redeem herself by taking bold initiative and effecting his escape.  It all gets a little preposterous plot-wise, but the strong performances, the sharp depiction of early 60s mores, manners and sexual politics make BLUE SKY well worth seeing.",1097280000,12,2255,5.008042895442359
