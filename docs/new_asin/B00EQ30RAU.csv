8608420,5,B00EQ30RAU,"So I read mixed reviews for volume 2 which we haven't seen.  However our little one adores this dvd; vol 3. Although I agree that this dvd is a bit cheesy and low graphics from an adult perspective, our 21 month  (now 22 month year old) LOVES it, loves it, loves it. Did I say loves it?  She sings and dances along with the DVD.  Even when it's not playing she'll spontaneously start singing ""happy birthday Jesus"" and ""Jesus loves me, Bible tells me so"".  It's repetitive, but changes it up so that the concepts and words associated with the Christmas story remain interesting (to a little one) and learned; overall well designed for a baby-toddler.  After watching this dvd, she shows a lot of interest in all the words associated with the dvd (jesus, bible, joseph, mary, bethlehem, star....).  I'd highly recommend it as part of a greater picture of introducing a Christian perspective on Christmas",1483488000,,902,4.707006369426751
