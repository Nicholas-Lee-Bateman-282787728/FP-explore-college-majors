8361302,4,B002BEXFGE,"Lost TV Shows of the 50s features two episodes from 1950s detective programs and three unsold television pilots, all of them well-done little adventures.

The first episode, ""Mark of the Octopus"" from Sea Hunt (1958), aired early in the show's first season.  Scuba diver Mike Nelson (played by Lloyd Bridges) is asked by the Coast Guard to investigate when two maritime geologists disappear under puzzling circumstances.  The mystery deepens when one of the bodies washes up on the beach with marks that appear to be made by a gigantic octopus.  Featured in the cast are Steve Mitchell, Willis Bouchey and Mari Aldon.  This episode escaped into public domain long ago and is included in many other DVD sets.

Front Page Detective (1951) was a short-lived series that ran on Dumont for several seasons. Newspaper columnist David Chase (Edmund Lowe) investigated various forms of murder and mayhem as grist for his articles and was aided, reluctantly, by Lt. George Andrews (George Pembroke), his friend on the local police force.  In this episode, ""The Little Black Book"", Chase is beset by criminals trying to recover a small leather notebook that details extensive criminal activities - but Chase can't tell them where to find it because it was never in his possession.  In addition to Pembroke, the episode co-stars Joe Besser, Jean Willes and James Craven with Pamela Duncan as Chase's wise-cracking secretary, Dorabelle.

The crimes depicted in the three unsold pilots are as wide-ranging as the locales the plots are set in.  The first pilot, ""Beach Patrol"" was filmed in 1959 and starred Alex Nicol as Lt. Roy Cahill, a police detective called in to assist the local life guard service investigate a murder that took place on a boat less than a quarter-mile from the beach.  The cast included Russ Conway as the Beach Patrol commander, Captain Bronson, and Joanna Barnes as a third-class night club chanteuse who gets mixed up in murder and blackmail.

""Alarm"" (1954) was the first (and more interesting) of two attempts by Roland Reed Productions to create a TV series focusing on the exploits of a major metropolitan fire department.  Captain Logan (Richard Arlen) and his assistant, McCuen (Chick Chandler), are detailed to investigate a series of arsons and are confronted by a number of possible perpetrators, all with motives for starting the fires.  The investigation is treated as a police procedural with the firemen following up methodically on each lead.  Like any good whodunit, all the clues necessary to solve the crime are fairly presented and viewers could have reasoned the solution before the investigators if they had been clever enough.

The final pilot, ""Assignment: Mexico"" (1956) starred Peggie Castle as Grace O'Conner, a crime-fighting travel agent who lives in Mexico City and just happens to be the love-interest of the local police commissioner.  Because of her beauty, intelligence and contacts, Grace is occasionally called upon to be an ""agent without portfolio"" as she puts it, to act as an undercover agent for the Mexican federales.  In this program, one of Grace's customers, a gangster with important connections in Europe, has come to Mexico to kill his estranged wife who is cooperating with the police's investigation of her husband's illegal activities.  Grace is asked to keep discrete tabs on his activities in the capitol city until she discovers that she's been tailing an imposter leaving the crook free to track down and murder his inconvenient spouse.  The well-acted program features Eduardo Noriega as Commissioner Juan Diez with Roland Winters, Rebecca Iturbide, I. Stanford Jolley and Douglas Kennedy in important subordinate roles.  As an added bonus, the pilot was shot on location in Mexico City.",1288483200,14,3756,5.134646962233169
8361303,4,B002BEXFGE,"I found this little collection of 5 episodes quite interesting,
apart from the ""lost"" Sea Hunt episode which for me at least is not lost as I possess
4 years of that show.
The ones that interest me are:
""Beach Patrol"" 1959 starring Alex Nichol and Russ Conway, this turned out to be an
unsold Pilot with some Detective work on and under the water.
""Front Page Detective"" 1951 starring Edmund Lowe ... ""Presenting an unusual story of
love and mystery on Front Page Detective""... about newspaper columnist David Chase.
""Alarm"" 1954 starring Richard Arlen as a fire investigator.
""Assignment Mexico"" 1956 starring Peggie Castle as a travel agent assisting a dashing chief of
police in Mexico  ""Oficina De Seguridad Federal
  Diputado Comisionado
  Juan Diez""  ......... on his door.
I suppose I enjoyed ""Front Page Detective"" most of all for its relaxed form of acting,
searching for an important black book, with a middle aged star for a change.",1285027200,9,943,4.89937106918239
