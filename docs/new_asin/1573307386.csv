191069,5,1573307386,"My 3 year old daughter, Olivia, has several of the Kidsongs videos.  I can let her watch them and not worry about the content or language (there aren't many videos like that anymore).  This one is like the rest; entertaining and fun.  We both love it.  I'm sure we'll be singing Jingle Bells all year long.  Thanks, Melissa L. Florence, South Carolina",1168300800,2,351,4.596774193548387
191070,5,1573307386,My sister and have watched this every Christmas since we were little. I don't know why it is getting bad reviews because it is one of our favorite holiday traditions! Check it out!,1132185600,3,180,4.484848484848484
191071,1,1573307386,"I was looking forward to my daughter's first christmas and her 1st birthday (She was born on christmas day 2003) so I bought this dvd so she could enjoy some Christmas Songs.  What a disappointment!  They should call it Happy Holidays as it deals with Christmas from a secular point of view.  My daughter loves it, her face lights up when she sees Santa Claus but I wish it had more Carols and more holiday spirit.  It's easy to see that it was shot on a sound stage with lots of fake snow.  The main Story line is about a boy who goes to the North Pole to see Santa because he has been naughty all year, and he still gets a gift because he did one good deed.  Another little girl gets a pony.  (I guess all of it is done in a dream sequence, because as soon as the boy opens his eyes on Christmas morning he asks for a present).  Still if you child likes Christmas music, you can try it out.",1100995200,4,892,4.057142857142857
191072,3,1573307386,"My 1 1/2 year old loves all of the Kidsongs dvds, but this is not one of her favorites.  The main beef I have with this one is that just about all of the songs center around what people want/ are getting for Christmas.  I don't like all of the emphasis on getting presents, and  think the true meaning of Christmas is completely ignored here.  Even Silent Night is an instrumental (the rest are sung by the Kidsongs gang).
Songs Include:
Deck the Halls
All I Want For Christmas is my Two Front Teeth
Silent Night
Frosty the Snowman
Jingle Bells
Santa, Please Don't Forget Me

191073,5,1573307386,"I love this Video. In fact I love all of the Kidsongs Videos, with somewhere around 22 videos that were Produced. This is a live action video starring Billy and Ruby Biggle and the Kidsongs Kids. It has such popular tunes as Deck the Halls, We wish you a merry Christmas, Jingle Bells, Frosty the Snowman, Twelve Days of Chrismas and other Favorites. I highly recomend this Video as well as all Kidsongs Videos. They are worth the investment.",980899200,3,442,4.6075949367088604
191074,5,1573307386,I have bought several copies of this DVD for my special needs son over the past ten years. He loves the Kidsongs series. As a mom I'm happy to give him the Christmas experience throughout the year.,1360195200,,197,4.351351351351352
191075,3,1573307386,I found it a little outdated but still worth viewing.  My kids ages 2 - 6 enjoyed some of the songs more than others.,1358812800,,117,3.875
191076,5,1573307386,Made a young girl very happy and will be used for quite a long time. Recommend to young children that like this type of show.,1357689600,,125,4.04

191078,5,1573307386,My four granddaughters--aged 3-1--couldn't get enough of this video.  They watched it again and again as they sung along to the songs they knew.  It was a real hit!!!,1231891200,,166,4.689655172413793
191079,5,1573307386,"This is an excellent children's video, as are most of the Kidsongs productions.  Children are engaged in age appropriate singing and movement to traditional Christmas/Winter music.",1231891200,,180,5.923076923076923
191080,2,1573307386,"The DVD was just OK. It only had 1 or 2 traditional Christmas songs and the remaining 5 or 6 songs were orignal songs that no one either don't know nor probably never heard before. I was hoping this DVD would have been a great way to introduce my 2 year old to all the traditional Christmas songs, but not the case. Also, the dancing wasn't the best either unlike many other Kidsong DVDs. I would not recommend this DVD if you want to enjoy it as a family, but as a toddler, like my daughter, would probably like it because of the many children that are on the DVD that are dancing and singing, plus seeing Santa Claus several times through the DVD.",1198713600,2,649,4.241935483870968
191081,4,1573307386,"I have a 4 yo brother who's absolutely in love with this series.  He watches the Christmas special repetitively and sings along passionately (he'll actually replay his favorite songs over and over again on the DVD player.)  Great for kids, because it keeps them happy & thoroughly entertained; maybe not so good for you, because you'll have these melodies ringing in your ears for a good 24 hours.  The cheese factor and the over-the-top nature of this series are really what keeps the kids absolutely mesmerized and entertained.",1197936000,2,529,4.988636363636363
191082,5,1573307386,"I bought this DVD for my [...]grandaughter before Christmas. This is one of the few DVD's that she wants to see over and over. She is still requesting to watch it in February! The songs are great for young children to sing along and the kids singers are delightful. Easy for young children to follow and understand. Very colorful also. I will definitely be looking at more Kids Songs DVD's, hoping they are all as good as this one.",1171670400,2,431,4.468354430379747
