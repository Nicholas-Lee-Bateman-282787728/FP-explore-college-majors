8416294,5,B0044TD99M,Thank you. The item arrived in excellent shape and as described.,1415491200,,64,4.909090909090909
8416295,2,B0044TD99M,I sent it back because I couldn't use the subtitles and still can't on the church resource DVD U version,1384473600,,104,4.25
8416296,3,B0044TD99M,This DVD has become a nice addition to our church's Christmas music/video repertoire. I would recommend it to any church and small group. Sometimes the lyrics lag a little behind the music but otherwise is fine.,1357776000,,211,4.888888888888889
8416297,3,B0044TD99M,I was more than a little disappointed that over half the songs did not have the lyrics on the screen. Makes It hard for family worship when the music isn't traditional and therefore you don't know the words and they aren't on the screen.,1356739200,,237,4.409090909090909
8416298,3,B0044TD99M,I like the songs that are on the DVD.  Some of the words appear late on the screen and a couple of the songs don't have lyrics at all.  I guess they assume everyone knows those words.  A little disappointed.,1354924800,,207,4.125
