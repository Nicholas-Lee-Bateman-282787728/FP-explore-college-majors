7915150,5,B0000214FD,"The music for this great quirky film about city politics gone absurd in Los Angeles was written by songwriter / composer Stan Ridgway. The score alchemizes a number of ethnic instruments, ( Spanish harps, Tibetan bowls, gut string guitar,Indian oud and Russian bozuki) into a style hybrid that totally reflects this tragi/comedy without sounding like anything specific to any group or ""race"". Music for the L.A. melting pot. Five stars.",976406400,3,436,5.242857142857143

7915152,5,B0000214FD,"I watched this film on HBO this weekend and was pleasantly surprised. CCH Pounder and Paul Rodriguez give excellent performances in this flick about two people running for a vacant city council seat. It is an excellent  examination of how ordinary ""good"" people can get caught up in  mudslinging and the ""game"" of American politics. The talented  multiracial cast offer a fresh perspective on the political process that  usually gets cut-out in an age of sound bites.",958953600,5,467,5.025974025974026
