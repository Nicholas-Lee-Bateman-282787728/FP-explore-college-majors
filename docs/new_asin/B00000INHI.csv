1226080,1,B00000INHI,"15th November 2013

It is now 13 years since my review and Amazon have once again added a review for a different product to a newer release.
They have also included 3 VHS reviews that (other than the performance) have no relevance to any subsequent DVD release.

The 2 DVD releases of this 1980 Metropolitan Production that I know of;

(i) the May 2000 Pioneer Classics release (which is still available).
(ii)the 2006 Deutsche Gramophon release.

Not having seen the 2006 Deutsche Gramophon DVD I cannot comment on the quality of this release.

There is also 1 DVD review dated December 1999, so perhaps there were 3 releases.

My review therefore only refers to the 2000 Pioneer Classics release;

1st July 2000

Good Performances, Good Music and Production spoiled by the quality of the DVD. This production was described as ""A Manon Lescaut of fluid movement"", I have never come across a DVD with such jerky movement, in  addition there were numerous irritating pauses, the lips of the singers  were continuously out of sync with the sound (remeniscent of movies where  the sound was added later). Never having encountered this before I assumed  the problem was with my player but after trying the same disc in another  player with the same result, I conclude that the problem is the disc. I  found myself so irritated by this that after the first Act I turned the  picture off and listened only to the sound.

Anyone who buys this DVD  should do so only with the proviso that they can return the disc if these  problems occur.",962409600,26,1531,4.713207547169811
1226081,5,B00000INHI,"The singing is great, with Scotto at top. Scotto acts as I've never seen her before and Domingo isn't bad in that either.  Levine's orchestral work is the best of his that I've heard.  The camera work is excellent too, with  almost flawless composition.
But what sets this opera apart is the  passion and emotion binding these elements and its principals together,  rendering it much more than the sum of its parts.
Yes, I thought that in  Act I they hadn't really gotten into yet, I wouldn't have minded a bit more  lushness from the orchestra, and the VHS sound is definitely no CD, but no  matter for a performance like this.",958694400,9,628,4.544642857142857
1226082,5,B00000INHI,Here's a wonderful performance of Manon Lescaut. The Met's lavish production is complemented by the most wonderful singing I have ever heard from Renata Scotto & Placido Domingo. Scotto's voice nearly at her best  is sung with the most passionate drama quite rare these days. Well  recommended!,953164800,13,294,5.23404255319149
1226083,4,B00000INHI,"The singing and sound on this dvd are generally very good, but they should have done something to clean up the video quality.",944092800,3,125,4.478260869565218
7911134,4,B00000INHI,Great. Wonderful opera with fantastic staging.,1495324800,,46,6.833333333333333
7911135,5,B00000INHI,"Perhaps Manon is not your favorite Puccini and you find the story stretched and more improbable than most operas...but Puccini is Puccini and well sung Puccini is worth listening too, even if the plot line challenges your tolerance.",1391558400,,232,5.131578947368421
7911136,5,B00000INHI,"I have recently been on a ""Manon Lescaut"" kick--having watched this
version of the opera, the Kiri/Domingo version, and the recent Met
production starring Karita Mattila.
I watched Renata Scotto in this dvd of the opera last night and just
loved it! She was a WONDERFUL Manon--the entire Act II was especially
enjoyable, as was Act IV. Scotto is a great actress, as well as having
a beautiful voice, and she seemed to really sink her teeth into the part.
For me, this performance was equal, though different, from the Kiri Te Kanawa ""Manon Lescaut"". It is true, Kiri and Placido Domingo had lots
of chemistry! They are awesome together. That is a hard performance to
top. But Renata Scotto's portrayal was so much fun, I think I enjoyed it
just as much. Maybe the Kiri version is slightly more romantic.
(I would mention that for me the Mattila/Giordani MET performance was
 sadly disappointing. No sparks there. And some less than shimmering
 vocals as well, at times.)
I highly recommend this Renata Scotto ""Manon Lescaut"". You will love the
singing, the passionate performances of all the singers, even the beautiful sets and costumes. All perfection.",1227916800,6,1154,4.912820512820513
7911137,5,B00000INHI,"This is my favorite opera production.  I consider it to be one of the greatest ever (as did Domingo).  Occasionally there is a camera problem, but it's minor.  This is a sexy opera and the stars give it right back to us.  Yes, I prefer Freni (my goddess) than Scotto, but Scotto makes up her vocal shrillness with her incredible acting.  This is a must see for Manon lovers and I can't wait to see it next year live at Seattle Opera.

Enjoy, friends!",1099785600,15,450,4.2976190476190474
7911138,5,B00000INHI,"I dislike reviewers (or anyone else) who use expressions like ""must have,"" ""must read"" or ""buy it!""!  The first two expressions are just in, and I'll buy what it pleases me to buy.  But Manon.  This I thought was glorious music gloriously sung and acted to within an inch of its life by everyone involved.  Manon has always been one of my favorite operas, this is the first time I've seen it, and I doubt I'll watch it again, nothing happens, I'll just listen to the CDs.  I only had 2 objections.  Scotto and Domingo were both a bit long in the tooth for their roles which to me anyway was very hard to take, the illusion that they were 18 or 20 years old was impossible to maintain.  Both were wonderful of course, just too told for their parts.  And (sigh, which is typical of an opera), it took forever for Scotto to die, in fact, the music notwithstanding (and I've always loved listening to it), I got bored and started laughing at the dialogue or lyrics or whatever its called by those who are in the know.  The sets (as others mentioned) were really wonderful.  Levine performed as well as the actors on stage.  He always seemed to be looking right into the camera or at least facing it, this was particularly prolonged during the intermezzo.  I liked Levine (or at least, never disliked him) up until this DVD.  The subtitles were thorough, a thing I've not encountered lately on other DVDs.  I recomend this DVD 100% musically and for everything except the age of its stars, and if you can find a version as perfectly done with younger lovers (and by younger, I mean young), I wish you'd recommend that to me.",1089936000,11,1619,4.444067796610169
7911139,4,B00000INHI,"""A woman like Manon can have more than one lover"", this is a statement made by Puccini when he decided to write his opera of ""Manon"", facing the already universally successful ""Manon"" by his French predecessor Massenet. Distinctively, he brought out his Manon with innocence, vanity, and cupidity, and Des Grieux, Manon's passionate lover, with Italian blood.
There is an abrupt jump from Act I to Act II, which may result in discontinuity of Manon's characters, as well as her love to Des Grieux. But as it goes on and as Puccini's music gets more deeply into the agony of the lovers, it gets better. In Act III the emotion has reached its hilt when Des Grieux sings his desperate pleading ""Guardate, pazzo son"", begging the captain to let him aboard with Manon. The strong dramatics then carries on and gets intensified in Act IV, and ends on Manon's tragic death and Des Grieux's helpless sobbing.
Soprano Reneta Scott, who sings Manon, is impressive in singing. Giving the best performance in Act IV, she is amazing in her vocal power, in forte or in piano. But portraying an eighteen-year-old character, Scott needs more than she could in order to be convincing. She delivers Manon with accuracy, if not vividness.
Although it is the story of Manon, on the stage of Met shines the brilliant Des Grieux, played by Domingo. His voice is lighter and brighter, and yet, more expressive, and his big outbursts are wallop. He looks young and lean, and his acting is full of feeling. Act IV is purely Pucinni with great intensity. Domingo portrays desperation and rage brilliantly. His sobbing is heartbreaking.
One big problem with this DVD is its video and audio quality. Almost every motion on the screen has a ghost tail following behind, somewhat distracting, and at times, annoying. The audio is not as bad as video, but just acceptable. What a pity that this production couldn't be caught on camera with the same sharpness as the opera itself!",1043798400,21,1948,4.817910447761194
7911140,2,B00000INHI,"I have contributed this video to the library because I couldn't stand the singing. Both leads sing uncharacteristically but consistently flat in the early part of the opera. The chorus is limp and other minor parts are are sung with too much wobble to be distinct. The strongest part of the singing is the excellent Lescaut of Pablo Elvira, but it just isn't a big enough part to make up for the rest. The orchestra plays well and the last two parts of the opera are well staged.",998870400,7,479,4.454545454545454
7911141,5,B00000INHI,"This is well done and I have had in my collection for years along with Domingo and Kiri in Covent Garden production.  I love them both but prefer Covent Garden just a little over this one due to the chemistry of Domingo and TeKanawa who's singing is better than Scotto's as she was beginning to dim vocally.  However, the two productions are so different that they are both required for any opera collection.  Domingo fans will just love him in what he used to say was his ""favorite role"".  I recommend both versions!",996192000,16,517,4.526881720430108
7911142,4,B00000INHI,"A suberb production well worth the preserving.  The audio is specatular.  Domingo and Scotto are stunning.  I've never heard this sung better!  The only disappointing feature is the spottiness of the video.  Most of the  time it is acceptable, but there are intermittent periods of  ""ghosting"" where the video is indistinct. While distracting to  the viewer, its effect on the overall performance does not diminish the  impact of a vocally wonderful performance.  I hope this there will be more  DVD's of some of these Met performances that truly rate as classics.  I  have many of these on Laser Disc and hope that the Dolby 5.1 will add to my  enjoyment.",964742400,28,656,4.845454545454546
7911143,5,B00000INHI,"Unfortunately I never had the opportunity to see Renata Scotto live in the theatre, but I am told that she is an excellent  singing actress.  Witness that for yourself in this magnificent production of one of my favourite  Puccini operas. When Scotto is on stage you can't take your eyes off her,  and watch her face at the end of Act III as DeGrieux pleads  with the  Captain to let him join her on board ship - what an amazing actress she is.  She makes you laugh, she makes you cry - what more can you ask for? There  is a chemistry between her and Domingo that inspires him to give one of the  greatest perfomances I have ever seen from him (and yes I was at his Covent  Garden Otello in front of the late Princess of Wales). The other principals  are excellent, but this is an opera about two people, and they carry it off  to perfection. The production is near perfect and the Met Orchestra give a  faultless perfomance.  I urge you to buy this DVD at once - you will see  and hear no better.",964051200,57,998,4.2063492063492065
