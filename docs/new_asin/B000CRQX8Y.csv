I really liked the premise shown, and a few years down the line decided to pick it up and watch it. Unfortunately, the story doesn't have an strong overall arc that pulls you in and keeps your interest. I felt like each time a new exciting element was introduced, they only let it ride out for one episode and then never mention it again. The basic premise is your main character Hajiki finds a Gad - a mech, for lack of a better classification - and goes on with his rather... uninteresting... teenage life, which includes other teenagers who have Gads. The human characters are likeable enough, but their Gads have humanoid features(look at the eyes!) yet remain completely emotionless through the entire series, resulting in a balance of... meh. The last few episodes proved to be a decent finale, but it wasn't enough to boost this over three stars for me. Probably not something I'll rewatch any time in the near future.

8101491,5,B000CRQX8Y,"My husband and I recently finished watching this series online, and were very impressed, having never heard of it before and thus having had no idea what to expect from it.

As some other reviews have stated, this show is very character-centric, with a great deal of depth to the storytelling, accompanied by beautiful artwork and an interesting soundtrack.  The characters are drawn very uniquely; and while there are a few skimpy outfits here and there, the series overall lacks the ridiculous gravity-defying boobs, unnecessarily frequent ""butt-shots"" and other silly characteristics common to fanservice-oriented anime.  That's not to say there's no humor in this series, though; there are plenty of comedic moments that are played out in other ways. and which are placed appropriately so that they don't detract from the more serious moments of the story.

The huge mechs, or Techodes, which play a part in this series, are very interesting to watch, for reasons which I can't really mention without spoiling anything.  But basically, as they are a curiosity to most people who live within the universe of the story, rather than being commonplace, they add a fair bit of awe and mystery to the story.  And the relationships between them and their owners are far from simple or ""cookie-cutter.""

The conflicts the characters must deal with, both external and internal, were nothing short of captivating; we were often glued to this show after seeing certain things happen, and had to immediately watch the next episodes to see what the outcomes were.  Hajiki, the main character, is not some stereotypical ""hero;"" he has a few character flaws here and there which make him seem more like a real person, easy to relate to in many ways, and thus all the more enjoyable to watch as he juggles work, family, school, and personal relationships, on top of owning a Techode.  Without giving away too much, the friends he comes to meet throughout the series are a variety of interesting characters as well, all from different backgrounds and having their own personal issues to manage.  And Katana, one of the main antagonists throughout the story, is particularly intriguing; he is an unconventional villain to say the least, and he ended up being one of my favorite characters, largely due to his unpredictability.

Even the more secondary characters contributed to several great moments; for example, one of the most hilarious scenes involved Mr. Hachisuka and Catherine.  And having Hajiki's mother as a significant presence in the story was refreshing as well; in so many other fantasy stories, the hero's parents are conveniently killed off before the main storyline begins, so that their opinions and safety don't have to be dealt with.

Overall, I would give this series a 6/5 if it were possible.  Gad Guard is thoroughly entertaining from start to finish, and is definitely worth a look if you need a new anime series to watch but aren't sure where to find a good one.",1352160000,,2974,4.9818181818181815
8101492,3,B000CRQX8Y,"I ordered this after seeing a trailer , then reading the reviews here. I don't understand what demographic they were after , there was too much violence ,smoking and swearing for kids , there wasn't enough excitement for younger adults and the character development and story depth weren't there for older adults.
  The artwork is great , the soundtrack good , voice acting was also ok.
 To me there was nothing there to keep my attention. Nothing kept me waiting to see what was going to happen next. I was going to throw in the towel after the first 2 discs but I toughed it out .
  So in my opinion I'd have to honestly say its just ok ,nothing more. I wish I'd have spent my money on something else instead of a show that will sit around collecting dust .",1274313600,,759,4.316901408450704
8101493,5,B000CRQX8Y,"I received the item right on time, it was in perfect condition, and I also watched the whole thing in 5 days.  The animation is really well done, it's funny, it's well drawn, and the robots are just amazing.  I like the rollercoaster of emotions that you go through while watching it and it's a series I would definatly suggest to anyone if they haven't see it or heard of it.",1248825600,3,376,4.28169014084507
8101494,4,B000CRQX8Y,"There's legitimate complaint from anime lovers that mecha (meaning shows based on robots) is guilty of being too formulaic.  The formula, in case you're wondering, typically goes something like this:  Young kid with a heart of gold happens upon a giant robot that even the engineers who created it cannot master.  Said youth possesses the skills required to tame this complex piece of machinery and thus uses it to save the world.  Okay so maybe that's a bit broad and generalized but I'll be honest: Mecha is my own personal passion and the stuff that got me into anime in the first place (anyone else remember Voltron and Robotech?)

These days' mecha shows have become a bit more complex than what we enjoyed in the early 1980s and while there is some legitimacy to the complaints that the genre is formulaic, studios like Gonzo countered by adding unique art elements to their robot shows.  Enter Gad Guard; a 26-episode mecha television series directed by Hiroshi Nishikiori that hit airwaves back in 2005.

I've been eagerly awaiting Funimation's release of this property since word of their acquisition of the show reached my monitor.  Released across 4 discs, the Complete Series contains all 26 episodes and comes in at a total runtime of 600 minutes.

The set comes packaged in a pair of think packs (each housing two discs) within a beautifully artistic cardboard slipcase.

The show wears a fairly conservative PG 13 rating due, presumably, to themes of voilence over foul language or nudity.

Language options are thorough with both an English dub and Japanese original dialog option (each in stereo) with English subtitles if so desired.

As is so often the case in modern anime, Gad Guard warns of the cautions of humanity's continual use (abuse) of natural resources.  Set several hundred years in the future, the resources of the Earth have all but run dry. Populations are now divided into crowded slums called Units.

The story follows a street-smart delivery boy by the name of Hajiki Sanada who is struggling to provide for his mom and little sister in Unit 74, specifically in a ghetto known as Night Town (because in effort to converse what little natural resources remain, the electricity is shut off each day at midnight). When this knit-hat donning errand boy happens to botch a delivery involving a mysterious black cube, Hajiki finds himself mixed up in a massive struggle for the forbidden technology contained within. Suddenly the show's title makes a lot more sense, as in attempt to retrieve the black cube (called a powerful stone); Hajiki accidentally releases a 20-foot-tall robot (called a Gad) that answers only to his beckoning call.

What we have, in simple terms, is the robotic equivalent to the old classic genie in the lamp mythos. Only rather than grant wishes, the Gad ends up disposing of the cast of goons who were seeking the black box (and with it Hajiki) in the first place.  Nearly a happily ended fairy tale in and of itself, the real action begins when a second Gad ends up in the control of one Katana (the main bad guy).

Robotic clashing ensues and the simple life of running deliveries for chump change is forever relegated to Hajiki's young memory.

What the story lacks in originality or risk-taking is more than made up for by its abundance of charm.  Gad Guard is rife with stunning visuals that make use of an intentional washed-out appearance sprinkled with small flashes of color.  The Gads themselves are nearly colorless save for their bird-like eyeballs and our hero comes decked out in earth tones except for his bright pink vest.  Many of the robotic combat sequences take place after dark (unfortunately) which only further adds to the overall dimness.

The look isn't only for uniqueness sake however as, don't forget, this is a tale told in the slums of the city about a poor family struggling to make ends meet.  As such the shades of gray and grit go a long way in depicting this motif.  Additionally the small details (such as the dogs) actually look as if they could have been penned up by contemporary artist, Gary Baseman (kids, google this guy if you don't know who he is).  Now that I think on it, it almost appears as though the whole show was infused with his influence.

The soundtrack matches the art with smooth jazz numbers filling in between soaring orchestration at the show's key moments.  The English dub is surprisingly solid as well and can honestly be considered one of few dubs that's nearly as emotionally-powerful as the original Japanese source material.

The show's pacing is consistent with tech-heavy action sequences taking the spotlight away from supporting cast character development.  However, there is enough personality among the main characters to compensate.

In all this is a charming mecha entry that proves without a doubt that the genre still has a lot of life left in it.  The artwork and music are stunning enough to carry the show if necessary but the story comes on strong and remains so solid that the odds and ends are never asked to overextend themselves.  Funimation deserves total praise for ensuring that titles like Gad Guard will not fall away into obscurity as a result of Geneon's untimely demise.",1242604800,10,5223,4.846846846846847
