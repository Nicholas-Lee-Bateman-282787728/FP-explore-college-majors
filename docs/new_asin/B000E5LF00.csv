2492865,5,B000E5LF00,This was funny when it was on TV so I was glad to see it on DVD.  It was just as good as I remembered it being.,1221782400,3,111,3.111111111111111
2492866,4,B000E5LF00,This DVD never ever fails to make me laugh. It's so ridiculous that it's just fun to watch. And Tommy is funny and charming in his own way. I'm still glad that I bought this.,1219968000,5,174,4.0
2492867,4,B000E5LF00,"Being fans of Tommy Lee, my girls and i loved this dvd.  I had quite a few chuckles during the viewing of this series and even my husband did too, who isn't a big fan of Tommy's. Tommy is very cheeky and a big kid at heart and he never ceases entertaining us. It was good to watch the complete series continuously without missing an episode.",1205625600,2,341,4.166666666666667
2492868,3,B000E5LF00,"Tommy Lee is super talented and remains relevant in the music scene and scores with the younger fans.  His marketing of his album along with this ""reality"" show are true genius.  He is truly a fish out of water which is a riot to see.  While Tommy remains the fun spirited rocker dude it is hysterical to see his piercings and tatoos intermixed with midwestern sweaters and average looking college students.  Usually it is the average looking kids who feel out of place while the pierced and tatooed are the cool mysterious people.  Now the rockstar looks like a goof!  My personal favorite episode is when he has to make it on the drumline to play at halftime.  Just a blast.  His hot tutor is funny also, along with his goofy average joe dorm roommate.  Even if you are not a big Tommy Lee fan, you will enjoy these DVD's.",1190332800,4,824,4.44

2492870,1,B000E5LF00,"I bought this DVD because I used to be a fan of Motley Crue and thought it might be kind of fun. Well, I'd like to shout at the devil that made me buy this stupid product. The entire show is staged and is purposefully set up to make it seem as though Tommy Lee is clueless and the university staff is shocked by his every move. From the frathouse pranks to the initiation ceremonies to the toga party!! Gee, very original concepts. I can hardly guess what might come next. There are no cool extras like a ""making of"" documentary, just a couple of crappy videos. And does Tommy Lee pass his courses in the end? Well, he's not even officially enrolled in the school so it hardly matters. This is one little drummer boy that needs to go back to what he does best, making porn videos.",1148774400,2,780,4.241610738255034
2492871,3,B000E5LF00,"6 episodes! That's it? There has to be more.

I surprised even myself when I tuned into this show. There was something about it that drew me in. I guess I tried to imagine Tommy Lee coming to my college when I was there and imagining how INSANE that would have been. Of course that was late 80s & early 90s when Motley Crue was REALLY POPULAR, but still.

Tommy Lee goes to classes, he struggles, his mind wanders, he gets a roommate, they play video games instead of study, he tries to join the band, struggles and then finds his niche and actually plays during the Nebraska Halftime show.

He gets a tutor and... YOWZA!! The tutor is a nice, cute, highly intelligent, brainiac named Natalie Reidman. She's such a looker, you wait around patiently for the moments in the episode when she comes back. Tommy Lee's no dummy. He needs lots of tutoring. Then it really gets good when this girl in one of his classes makes a move on him. I wondered when this was gonna happen.

Then the tutor and the classmate have a study clash.

Then Tommy Lee starts up a fraternity with his roommate. Pledges an Animal House looking bunch of goofballs and... then the season FINALE!!! WHAT!!

As much as it pains me to say it... I wanted more. I wanted more Natalie Reidman. I wanted more hijinks. I wanted to see REAL COLLEGE LIFE. Instead, we saw a scripted... just scratching the surface midseason time waster.

I had hoped that the DVD release would incorporate more episodes or longer episodes or more story, but apparently it is just the same episodes that aired. Frankly, without Natalie Reidman, the hot blonde tutor, I probably wouldn't have kept watching.

Every T.V. show, movie, song or concert sets out to accomplish something. In 6 episodes, Tommy Lee Goes to College accomplished NOTHING. It didn't show us real college life. You can't tell me that Tommy Lee went to Nebraska University for a semester and THIS was all that happened. Besides... in 6 months, all they got was a little over 2 hours of useable footage which was mostly scripted, staged, and mixed with special effects and music montages.

I'm sorry. I just wanted more. I wanted to see what REALLY happened. Not this sugar-coated, made for T.V., scripted bologna.

When it's all said and done, my entire 3 stars goes to Natalie Reidman, the hot blonde tutor, who we'll most likely never ever see again, because she's WAY TOO SMART to pursue any sort of acting career.

The show, on the other hand, was a starless stinker. It could have been great, if they'd chose to tell us THE REAL STORY and the WHOLE STORY!",1144800000,12,2572,4.569565217391304
2492916,3,B000E5LF00,"I was on campus at UNL when this show was filmed. This show is absolutely horribly ""acted"" and is full of inaccuracies (as with most reality shows), but it's completely nostalgic and fun to watch every once in a while because it reminds me of that particular time in college. Unless you are a Nebraska fan/alum and/or Tommy Lee fan, you probably won't like this show. Even if you are, you probably won't like this show!",1358640000,,419,4.526315789473684
2492917,5,B000E5LF00,"Let's get one thing straight...I don't enjoy this because of how ""good"" it is. Most of the scenes are pretty clearly staged. But that's not the point. As a comedy show about a rocker stepping out of his comfort show, this is great. As a Motley Crue fan, this was a cool thing to see. I also have a personal connection, considering I grew up 20 miles from the University of Nebraska-Lincoln and am currently a student there. For less than $6 though, if you like laughing and are at all interested in Tommy Lee, this is a great find!",1357171200,2,531,4.32
2492918,5,B000E5LF00,Great DVD. Very entertaining if you like Motley Cre! We have already watched it several times and will many more! Thanks!!,1346976000,,122,4.857142857142857
2492919,2,B000E5LF00,"This is just what you'd expect, only not nearly as exciting as you'd hope. It's so obviously staged from start to finish that it's really not that entertaining.",1330992000,,160,4.75
2492920,5,B000E5LF00,"I'm a 1978 graduate of UNL so I had a little extra interest in the show, still I didn't watch it until recently when I picked up an inexpensive copy from an Amazon seller. I was really taken with the program. Tommy was flat out funny and he tried really hard to fit in with the Nebraskans. And the huskers reciprocated. It's not a raunchy show at all, I think a family would have a good time with it.",1329782400,,400,4.075949367088608
2492921,1,B000E5LF00,"Is this what we have come to for entertainment? Truly, if this is what passes as something worthwhile, then society in general is dumber than I thought. I have a hard time believing Tommy Lee even knows how to spell 'college'. Please! This is so stupid, it was not worth me typing this review. The world is a dumber place for having this 'movie' in it. May God have mercy on our souls.",1265155200,,385,4.287671232876712
2492922,5,B000E5LF00,Any and all Motley Crue fans should have this dvd in their collection - It is laugh-out-loud funny; very entertaining. The title explains it all.,1260144000,,145,4.84
2492923,4,B000E5LF00,"Not to be too long, nor too repetitive of other reviews, but my main problem is that the show was not as long as I expected. Another major annoyance is how tame it was. After having read Tommy Lee's ""Tommyland"" biography and the Mtley Cre biography ""The Dirt,"" I had expected something completely different. The only difference between this reality show and a similar reality show also taking place at a college would be that the star of this show was famous before the show. Other than that, this might be a reality series taking place anywhere. Admittedly, that tameness factor is most likely due to the fact that it aired on TV first, and wasn't released straight on DVD.
It was also somewhat dull to see Tommy struggle with his bizarrely chosen curriculum. Honestly, who in their right mind chooses somewhat advanced courses, both in Chemistry and Physics, along with a Biology course in identifying trees and a Literature course that they are completely unprepared for? Wait, I did say ""right mind,"" didn't I? Never mind, then... ;-)
All in all, in my opinion, the most entertaining element of this series is the chance to ""study"" Tommy doing what he does best: Have fun.",1256515200,2,1176,4.741463414634146
2492924,4,B000E5LF00,"We enjoyed this Tommy Lee slice o'life as he attempts to integrate into the college curriculumn in Nebraska, i.e. do well enough in skool to make-the-band. Watch, enjoy and dream of being him as he cruises thru a quarter of academics and with a bit of tutoring, achieves his goal with style.",1245801600,,291,4.615384615384615
2492925,3,B000E5LF00,"I had fun watching myself this series on the TV and decided to show it to my son, just to give him an idea what college life is like.
Being a Motley fan, we both had fun watching this and good or bad, my son was able to see some ""real"" campus life and activities.
It is difficult to explain how much fun you can have in college, but showing the DVD, they understand better what is like to be there.
One thing for sure, my son decided not to take physics and chemistry.",1223337600,2,468,3.9893617021276597
