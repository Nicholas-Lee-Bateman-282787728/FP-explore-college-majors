There are supposed to be interviews with the actual spy that caught (but did not shoot) this particular Latvian Nazi, but really -- who's to know if it was the real guy or not? There is a lot of shaky camera work which hurts the eyes after a while.",1527811200,,294,4.0

8436097,5,B004MLXR3A,"This is the same series that comes on the American Heroes Channel. I call it the Hitler Channel.  Thirteen episodes about nazi war criminals.
The only drawback is that the format is region 2. Not all dvd players can play this. Fortunately I have a portable DVD player that will.
