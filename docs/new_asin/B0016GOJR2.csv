8262335,4,B0016GOJR2,"This film has an amazingly ambitious story for its time. a story about poorly treated coal mine workers and a deeply powerfull hero destined to a life of pain and suffering for his mistakes in his past. this film boasts some powerfull performances from Amithab Bachan and Shatrugan sinha. Rakhee plays the soulful doctor destined to help the unfortunate wherever they may be thus on of the most famous lines in bollywood history when Rakhee is trying help The injured Amithab. ""please why don't you try uderstand"" ""Pain is my destiny doctor and I can't avoid it!"" Shashi kapoor plays the Dashing young romantic engineer together with Parveen Bhabi the news reporter who plays his girlfriend in the film. The story works well on a whole though technically the film leaves a lot to be desired. Though the scenes in the coal mines are well done. The rest is a bit shoddy in places, but some brilliant acting is what takes this film beyond its rather dull appearance. This film comes with a soulful soundtrack that really works well and some fantastic songs to be rememderd forever... they just don't make stories like this anymore.....shame really",1301875200,,1144,4.841836734693878
