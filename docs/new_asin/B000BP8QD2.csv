8090536,2,B000BP8QD2,"Watching this film in light of today's sophisticated productions, it appears almost comical ( bad dubbing, directing that makes the characters reactions unbelievable, amateurish script writing ), but get past all that and you have an imaginative take on the time around the crucifixion of Jesus Christ. This film have been in our collection for some time and we still say lines from the film when we want to make a point and laugh about the point in the film the line is delivered. Some lines are comical, without trying to be, such as the scene at which Joel is invited into Stephens's house for a meal. At one point, Stephens mother announces "" Breakfast is ready, boys! In almost perfect North Carolinian accent.
Given the resources and the time in which it was produced, Wine of Morning is almost a period film within a period film, reflection the USA of the 50's take ( and portrayal) of Biblical times. The recommendation is to read the book on which the Film is based, rather than trying to watch the film with all its idiosyncrasies and anachronistic accents and lines.",1278633600,6,1077,4.703703703703703
