8167116,3,B000M7RAZE,A friend of mine got me this at The Cracker Barrell Country Store.  It was a bargain dvd.  So the price now is pretty outragouus.  This is just what it says.  Four complete episodes.  The Loaded Goat about a goat that eats some dynamite is my favorite but they are all good.  Who didn't like The Andy Griffith Show.,1474416000,,315,4.254237288135593
