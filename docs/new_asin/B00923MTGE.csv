8534534,3,B00923MTGE,This was an interesting film about a mans obsession with the the presidential election. There were several story line's and they were not all convincingly resolved. It was interesting to see how far a man would go to get a presidential candidate elected. Katt Williams gives one of his best performances. The acting and direction are fine. Dutton is great as usual. Recommended for fans of Indie African American dramas.,1410134400,,420,5.014285714285714

8534537,1,B00923MTGE,"This gets zero stars.  I could not finish watching this Obamination.  Nothing but liberal propaganda and more lies about what history will remember as the worst president of the United States.  Feel good about the destruction that is happening now, Obamacare etc.?? If you light candles at the foot of Obama's picture and think he's your lord savior, then by all means watch this trash.  You low information voters will love it!",1383264000,2,428,4.902777777777778
