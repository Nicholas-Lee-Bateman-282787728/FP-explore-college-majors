7207603,5,B00Y250IOM,"I received a sample copy of this DVD for no charge as part of a preview pre-release. I was not required to provide my opinions in exchange for my copy but have chosen to do so on my own. My oldest started Kindergarten a couple weeks ago, and as a shy child with speech delays she had major fears about going to school. I used the Daniel Goes to School DVD as a tool to calm her fears and get her excited about Kindergarten.

I am a huge fan of Mister Rodgers' and the Fred Rogers Company, and my children are now growing up on the same lessons Mr. Rogers provided through Daniel Tiger's Neighborhood. If your child is a fan of Daniel Tiger's Neighborhood they will have most likely already seen most of the episodes featured on this DVD, but the compilation is a great edition to a child's library that can be viewed whenever they want. This DVD includes 8 episodes that aim to get kids excited about school and learning. Each episode pertains to school in some way.  Children learn valuable lesson such as problem solving, sharing, working together, and following rules. The insert inside the DVD case includes activities and games from many of the PBS KIDS characters, and there are also back to school tips included inside the case.

Both my 5 year old and 2 year old love Daniel Tiger and Daniel Goes to School. My 5 year old now asks to watch the DVD when she gets home from school during her time to ""unwind"" from the day away from home. I let my 2 year old choose a movie to watch while we wait in the school pick up line everyday, and every day this week she has chosen Daniel Goes to School.

I would recommend this DVD to anyone with a child heading off to school for the first time or with a child who is a fan of Daniel Tiger's Neighborhood.",1441497600,,1753,4.287009063444109
