4374245,5,B004GTVU78,"Eddie Griffin is so funny I have followed his career since 1985 when I first saw him at a club in Kansas City, Mo where is is from and he was amazing then.  So if you want to laugh get this video.",1355702400,,196,3.6666666666666665
4374246,5,B004GTVU78,love comedy anyway this took the cake love you eddie griffin please buy everyone. bring it out to watch regularly,1355356800,,113,4.7
4374247,5,B004GTVU78,"Once you get past the act of n#gg@ this and n$gg@ that and the constant swearing- you realize that it serves as a deeper pun to his message with every political or controversial topic.  He doesn't bash one group over the other like other fellow comedians, he bashes everyone.  Beyond the fascade, he backs his comedic routine with educated reasoning to prove his point.  He does it in a very unconventional manner that makes his comedy hilarious.  So when you watch him at first, it's easy to jump to conclusions that he's another Kat Williams or spin off of Chris Rock.  While I really enjoy Rock's work, Griffin's routine is definitely his equal.  I think anyone who enjoys comedy should give Griffin a try.",1348358400,,709,4.67741935483871
4374248,5,B004GTVU78,If you get offended easily go find a Robin Williams or other mild comedian. EG speaks his mind and entertains at the same time. Wonderful comedian.,1343433600,,147,4.6923076923076925
4374249,4,B004GTVU78,"Very funny comedy material with only  a few slow parts near end of the show.  For those who bad mouth his preformance because of the Christian part, I am Catholic and I found that part of the show very humorous.  People as a whole have to have a sense of humor or they will never get threw life as a whole.  I just let myself go and enjoy life when I can enjoy it when not working, so if your looking to unwind with another good comedian pick this comedian up and listen and watch this preformance with an open mind and might be amazed just like I was with this preformance.  So don't listen to the bad reviews just make up your own mind about the preformance.",1341705600,,660,4.125
4374250,5,B004GTVU78,"Eddie Griffin is ""off the chain""!!!. He's comical, down-to-earth, serious, and  definitely keeps it ""100""!  This is a MUST see DVD!",1337385600,,131,5.190476190476191
4374251,5,B004GTVU78,"Eddie Griffin is hilarious and once again extremely funny in this movie.  I love it, my husband and my sister and I watch and laugh throughout.  It's a great buy!!",1336780800,,163,4.4
4374252,5,B004GTVU78,"With the bar so high with the likes of Richard Pryor, George Carlin, Eddie Murphy, Dave Chappelle, Chris Rock, Louis CK, etc it was a pleasent surprise to hear Griffen's brilliant comedy and commentary - as good as any of the above in it's intelligent content and hilarious narrative.

First time I got a clear street lesson on bloods and crips and drooping pants!

Paul Mooney's influence is clear with the Brink's truck reference.

I urge all to hear a refreshing take of the current politico-social climate from a proud black man (no Eddie - you are NOT a n*****) - though I cannot say I approve of how many kids he has - that is not something to boast about expecially having several ex wives and kids out of wedlock - I am not a prude but this is not something to be pleased about - be pro life if you must, but enough already of prooving your manhood with rampage procreation!

Still Eddie Griffen was a pleaseant surprise and I will be searching for all his albums, the dude has paid his dues and deserves all the success he can get as long as he stops having more babies!",1327536000,,1079,4.353233830845771
4374253,5,B004GTVU78,Eddie Griffin has been a long time favorite for me...He has his usual routine but he is so versatyle with his style and you've never knew of or seen any of his stand ups...you wouldn't know but I like how he kicks just a little knowledge to make you think...A true master of turning thoughts into comedy...Educate your minds yunginz...THINK it aint illegal yet....,1311033600,3,364,4.703125

4374255,3,B004GTVU78,"Thought DVD would have been better as I like Eddie Griffin, but talking about church beliefs the way he did turned me off.  Plus way, way too many 'F' bombs...took away from the context. Had I watched it somewhere before, I would not have bought it.",1308700800,,249,4.413043478260869
4374256,2,B004GTVU78,"Don't get me wrong the dvd did have some laughs. Before you buy be advised this standup is mostly white jokes and ni**a every 18 seconds. I understand that this is his style but it has me asking myself if this dvd was really made in 2010,i feel like im watching stand up from 2001. He does make some valid points,some good jokes and even takes a stab at religion but the rest of it feels recycled.",1307491200,,397,4.1688311688311686
