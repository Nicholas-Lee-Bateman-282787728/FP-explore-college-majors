8119179,5,B000F9JDP4,"This fact-based drama is about a high school teenager's courageous fights after a school bus accident leaves her emotionally and physically handicapped. Stephanie Zimbalist (star of ""Remington Steele"") gives an outstanding performance as young Celia, the teenager who is the focus of the story. Wonderful performances are also given by Cloris Leachman (as her mother), Mike Connors (as her father) and Katy Kurtzman (as her younger sister).

The overall story is how this family comes to cope with and get through a very tragic situation. It is very believable, touching and, by the end, extremely uplifting. I would recommend this movie to everyone!",1144713600,3,650,5.310679611650485
