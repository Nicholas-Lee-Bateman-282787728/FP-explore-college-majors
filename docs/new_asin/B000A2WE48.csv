8072795,1,B000A2WE48,"It was very hard to follow what was going on in this film. Not least because I couldn't be bothered giving it my full attention because it was so boring. It was scary at all, the American versions of the Grudge films are far superior.",1399075200,,234,4.222222222222222
8072796,1,B000A2WE48,"Ju-On The Grudge 2: 3 out of 10. When horror franchises go back to the same well over and over again, they often attempt to at least make superficial changes in the main character's circumstances. (It's Jason but he is in 3-d. It's Jason but he is in New York. It's Jason but he is in space.) Now I'm not suggesting these efforts actually worked. (Leprechaun in Space or Children of the Corn in the ghetto are two abominable examples but I have to give the Halloween people credit when their main killer Michael Myers went off to do Wayne's World)

However at least these franchises have made the appearance of some effort. Ju-on the Grudge 2 on the other hand is actually the fourth or fifth Ju-on movie depending on who is counting, and it is the exact same house with the exact same ghosts and the whole grudge part, needless to say, makes even less sense than ever. (Even the Amityville Horror series had the decency to leave the damn house eventually) To make matters worse we have had approximately 100 white screeching ghost chicks with black hair Asian horror films since the first one.

It seems like every Asian culture is raping their heritage to come up with their own home grown spook. (Strangely enough one of the recent knockoffs I saw Thailand's Ghost of Mae Nak used Final Destination death scenes rather than the black haired, white faced knockoff to get scares. Even the Johnny come lately countries realize that this genre is spent.)

The ghosts once again are the marshmallow boy and the scary woman with hair of death. The movie is shot Memento like completely out of order. Needless to say this does not help matters. The death scenes are generally not shown but suggested which can add to the confusion. By the time you figure out what is going on the movie is half over.

There are some effective scares but the wig bit in the middle and the Omen stuff at the end had me laughing with disbelief.

Large amounts of silence and a ridiculously slow pace will challenge even the most caffeinated viewers to stay awake. The main characters don't help as they are remarkably boring (and I have a decent attention span for Japanese woman wearing schoolgirl outfits) and lack any personality or spark.

Ju-On the Grudge 2 is the same movie as the others but with less. This sequel is for a fanatic or completist only.",1258156800,2,2334,4.585131894484412
8072797,1,B000A2WE48,"I would give this movie a big fat ZERO if it was possible!!  Also, the couple  mentioned in the other reveiw DO NOT die and she wasn't PREGNANT with the ""star""...pay more attention!  This is REALLY a milk toast attempt to re-create the great creepiness of the first Juon.  While the concept was really good, when all is said and done it falls WAY short of coming NEAR scary or creepy.......as usual, a few scenes may give a couple of chills, but it is far below what fans of Asian Horror have come to expect.  If you are a fan of The Grude, as I am, you will probably want to see it...RENT it or buy it but DO NOT pay over 8-9 for it, it just isn't worth it!!",1151193600,4,659,4.038461538461538
8072798,5,B000A2WE48,"Ju-On 2 is a very great scary sequel with millions of thrills. I was lucky enough to find a bootleg DVD at West Edmonton Mall, (I live in Edmonton) so I bought it, and when I watched it, I immediately started jumping.

The movie starts off with a couple who die in a car crash, the woman pregnant with a star named Koyoko. She turns into a real big movie star, and stars in lots of horror movies. But when she is forced to shoot a documentary about the ""haunted house"", eveyone in production is missing. Now, she discovers she's next.

JOTG 2 is a very good sequel. Prepare to start screaming and jumping!",1149465600,7,605,4.298245614035087
