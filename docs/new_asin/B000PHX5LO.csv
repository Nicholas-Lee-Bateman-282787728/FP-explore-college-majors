2823691,5,B000PHX5LO,"The ""Nick Jr"" DVD's are a great alternative to watching a DVD with the same characters over and over again.  The kids enjoy the change, and I enjoy not hearing the same theme song over and over and over again  :-)",1218326400,,213,4.170731707317073
2823692,3,B000PHX5LO,"I am a home daycare and have bought this DVD because of Summer, Winter and Spring breaks when Nick Jr. stop playing as early as 9:00 am. If I had known what shows where on this DVD I would bought another. Also my daycare kids don't want to watch it. THey LOVE Nick Jr. Favorites - Vol. 5 but don't care for this one.

Here's the run down.

Dora the Explorer
""Backpack"" On dora and Backpack's first adventure together, they need your help ato return Dora's eight books to the library before it closes.

(It is cute but I already own this one.)

Wonder Pets
""Save the Cow, Save the Skunk""
The team needs to save the Baby Cow stuck in a tree in Oklahoma, and then they bring along Ollie the Bunny to rescue a scared Baby Skunk.

(The Save the Skunk one has Ollie the Bunny who has an attitude problem. I have never care for it.)

The Backyardigans:
""Monster Detectives""
Sixties, style rock underscores Tyrone's adventure as a non-nonsense detective helping his client Uniqua retrieve her soccer ball from the castle of the Soccer Monster.

(This is one of my least favorite The Backyardigans. It's just really dumb.)

Jack's Big Music Show:
""Marching Band""
Jack, My and Mel aren't going to let the rain outside stop their marching band, so they march inside! With music videos from Laurie Berner and Milkshake

(This ok.)

Blue's Clues""
""What Did Blue See?""
See if you and Steve can find the clues to figure out what Blue saw in this sense-sational game of Blue's Clues!

(I love Blues Clues and this one super cute)

Little Bill
""Ready, Set, Read-I Got a Letter""
Little Bill asks his teacher to help him read like his brother Bobby. Then he masters the mystery of the mail with his dad.

( I love Little Bill)",1217980800,60,1707,4.467741935483871

Personally, I find it to be the most boring of all of them.  My advice, don't waste your money on this one.

2823712,5,B000PHX5LO,"With a two-year-old in the house, it's easy to get addicted to shows that come on Nick Jr. and its sister cable channel, Noggin.  This compilation has six of the best, from the adventurous Dora the Explorer to the imaginative Backyardigans to the rescuers known as The Wonder Pets to the precocious-tyke-with-the-winning-laugh, Little Bill.

The appealing animation - each is distinctive in its own way - to the lessons learned, the six respective shows provide entertainment as well as educational value that can be appreciated by young and old alike.  None of the shows are condescending to little kids, respecting them for the blossoming intelligence that is present in young minds.

The set comes highly recommended, as do the daily showings of the shows on the network(s).",1245456000,,777,5.094488188976378
