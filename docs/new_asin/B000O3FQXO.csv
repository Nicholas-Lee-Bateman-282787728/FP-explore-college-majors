8182747,5,B000O3FQXO,"I am a dyed in the wool Lovin' Spoonfuls fan and have been since they began.  I never thought they got the attention they truly deserved.  This DVD gives them that attention.  I got to see them perform most of their hits, some I had seen, most I had not and got to hear John Sebastion talk about their hits and where they came from.  For me, that was wonderful.  I'd have loved more on just his work after the Spoonful as well, other than Welcome Back Kotter, but maybe another DVD.  If you're a fan, this is wonderful to own.",1176076800,,526,4.158415841584159
8182748,3,B000O3FQXO,"I give this 3 stars not for what it has but what was left off. Instead of

Darling Be Home Soon from Ed Sullivan, it has a Sebastian solo performance

from 1970. Instead of Welcome Back from Sebastian's Saturday Night Live

performance, we get a ""rock video"".

Peformances from the Big TNT Show would've been better then the Hullabaloo or

Shindig clips (the TNT performances are full live, not live vocals to pre-

recorded tracks).

The film promos for Summer in the City & Rain on the Roof, would've been nice.

And with all the nods to Zally as a performer, why not Bald Headed Lena from

Sullivan or There She Is from Hullabaloo?

Maybe there was copyright issues with the SNL clip, but other performances

from Sullivan & Hullabaloo are included.

All the commentary is from Sebastian (except a couple of comments from a

college professor I never heard of). I would've loved commentary from other

members of the Spoonful,their peers (Chris Hillman,David Crosby,Stills,

Henry Diltz),producer Erik Jacobson or those influenced by them (NRBQ,

Elvis Costello-, David Lee Roth-'Coconut Grove' on 'Crazy from the Heat').

John, you want to make up for it?  Release the cancelled live release from

the Night Owl.

Also, John, you wrote Daydream on the Supreme's tour in 1965 not 1966.

love you anyway",1174435200,3,1305,4.867579908675799
