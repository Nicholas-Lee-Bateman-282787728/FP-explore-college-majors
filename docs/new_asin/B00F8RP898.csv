5970675,5,B00F8RP898,HIS MUSIC MAKES ME SOOOO HAPPY.  I LISTEN TO IT  EVERY DAY.  NO ONE BETTER THEN HIM. IT'S HEAVEN LISTENING TO HIS MUSIC!!!!,1391299200,,123,4.260869565217392
5970676,5,B00F8RP898,"Both DVDs Andre & Friends-Live in Maastricht"" and ""Live in Brazil"" are excellent production and great relaxing entertainment for audience. Andre Rieu is an excellent conductor and musician.",1390089600,5,189,5.785714285714286
5970677,5,B00F8RP898,"The DVD gave the title with II . Is there a forerunner with I ? Or another one as III ? The year was 2013. A short response would be very much appreciated. Also, graphics with 480p are brilliant. "" - Live in Maastricht"" has an eye appeal which some of the other previewed, NOT from Maastricht locations, cannot quite reach. Any suggestions from your end?

I had ordered, and gratefully received, four DVDs. Overall Rating also five stars.

Thank you.

5970680,5,B00F8RP898,"We loved his show. However the DVD had a defect. About the 16th number static appeared and the sound shut down. I advanced the disc and returned to number sixteen and it played normal then. Playing it for the 2nd time the same problem appeared. I am disappointed that this product shipped from Thailand does not stand up to the normal standard.

5970688,5,B00F8RP898,"I am watching this now, and loving it. We have seen many (all?) of his concerts and always enjoy them. Yes, some of the songs are repeated, but they are always fantastic. Each concert includes something/someone new. And half the fun is watching the audience - singing, laughing, crying and of course, dancing along. This is definitely one of the best.

5970694,5,B00F8RP898,"I'm a great fan of Andre and this is the best.  He just makes his events so awesome.  The crowd was exceptionally large and everyone had a fantastic time.  The number of musical pieces was longer than usual, but certainly not boring.  He plays to mixed audiences and as a result some of the numbers are in foreign language, a lot of German.  I have never found this to be a problem as I recognize most off the melodies.  The music is what we should be dwelling on.  Andre loves to interject humor and the piece about the bull fight was very humorous. Of course there were a few numbers that brought tears to my eyes, as well as people in the audience.  This is quite a gift to have your music elicit such emotion.  You can't go wrong listening to any of Andre's DVDs.",1491782400,,767,4.23448275862069

5970696,2,B00F8RP898,"As someone already said here, ""This one was very particular to his audience in Holland."" I bought this for my mother, but she doesn't care for it at all. When, surprisingly, it began with ""76 Trombones"", there was no where to go but up. Out of three sets of songs, it seemed that surely there would be something of interest for her, but it never happened outside of 2-3 token Strauss waltzes. I understand the Orchestra must be heartily sick of Strauss by now, but there was hardly a piece on the entire program for her to recognize and enjoy; guest performers, anthems, national songs very meaningful to the local audience, but not to us at least (in the U.S), however many here gave the selection high reviews. I will be throwing it away, and next time look past reviews to the actual content, as I should have before purchasing this without looking into it.  Nothing wrong with production values, unless, like me, you find the constant sight of a crowd in the throes of their own party ultimately boring. Would much rather see the performers, but for some reason, the handsome orchestra is mostly shown only from far away. The audience and orchestra antics at last descended into something close to hysteria and the music into noise.",1490745600,,1236,4.669724770642202
5970697,1,B00F8RP898,"When I received this CD  I was so excited to listen to it. Once put into my CD player  I was unable to play it. The player kept saying "" no disc."" I tried numerous times to no avail. Now what? I spent money on something I cannot play.",1490572800,,234,3.7551020408163267
5970698,5,B00F8RP898,"I bought this for a friend who is very fond of Rieu's music and has several of his DVDs. This did not disappoint; it's her new favorite. However, in shopping, it pays to be careful. Some DVDs are re-edited from other shows and may result in repetition. Nevertheless, he's wonderful to watch and to listen to.",1489449600,2,308,4.517857142857143

5970706,5,B00F8RP898,"The music was of the highest caliber, the setting was beautiful, the orchestra and singers were costumed beautifully, the audience was there to not only enjoy the music, but to feel the sentiment of the music, and Andre Rieu was at his very finest.  There is something to be said for a huge crowd turning out for a live performance in the open air and not one incident of complaint, fussing, or getting rowdy.  The music brought so much happiness and often, tears to the eye. I so wanted to be in the live audience to feel the sensation first hand.  And yes, I admit, I often had tears in my eyes--tears of joy, sorrow, and thoughts of long ago. I can't possibly find enough words to adequately praise this video.  I wish I could have been there in person!",1483315200,13,756,4.378571428571429

This was the ninth show and once again it was more incredible than last years. The audience sees and feels that the heart and soul of everybody on the stage is in the music; the careful selection of songs sends the audience on an emotional roller coaster from dancing to tears. Bringing in a local star from the Netherlands next to an international icon like Trini Lopez, remembering Michael Jackson with his favorite song, and playing with Europes only band of handicapped people shows how music connects people and how Andre and his orchestra make people from all over the world come together and celebrate.

Quality of product excellent.
Rieu programming, guests, top quality as usual. He is one of the best, most quality oriented entertainers now playing and  sharing the stage with the challenged men's and women's orchestra was frosting on  the cake.",1392854400,,266,5.309523809523809

And it came to my house a couple days before I expected it, so that's even better yet! Good deal!",1391385600,,258,4.14

Out of 48 Toner ink cartridges I have purchased in just the last few months the PREMIUM IMAGING CARTRIDGE SET OF FOUR (XP 6022) were all no good.  Kept getting the CRUM error on all four---must be the wrong ink toner for my Xerox 6027 printer  These toner cartridges only had 4 contacts on the top when the other brands (mentioned) had 4 contacts plus another small contact along side the 4 all worked.  Would you please refund my purchase price back to my checking account.

Secondly---I am very satisfied with the LD brand of ink toner cartridges, however, two blacks were empty-didn't last the afternoon  ( 8 43964 07208 5).  Would you please send me the two black LD cartridge replacements.  Thank you---

8613181,5,B00F8RP898,"I love Andre Rieu and I loved watching his concert on the video! It brings you in a wonderful mood. Andre is such a talented an uplifting person. I had been to his live concert in San Diego before I purchased the DVD. The concert on the video is longer than what he did on his last tour in the US. As this concert is recorded in his home town it shows a spirit of the Netherland, the local people and gives you a bit different cultural prospective, which makes it even more interesting. Highly recommend this DVD even as a gift to someone who admires his talent!",1513641600,,562,4.212962962962963
