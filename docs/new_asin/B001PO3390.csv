8333935,5,B001PO3390,"A very interesting documentary, I enjoyed it quite a bit. It gave me much to think about and added to my resources on world religions,",1363651200,,134,4.4
8333936,1,B001PO3390,"I was shocked to purchase this film and to find that it is an almost direct ripoff of Rick Ray's excellent ""The Soul Of India"". It appears the filmmakers have simply copied Ray's program, removed the intelligent narration, and inserting their own shrill British narrator. The end result is a mishmash and probably a serious copyright violation. If you want a much more in depth film about the subject, go to the source film for this cheaply made mashup.",1347753600,5,453,4.746835443037975
8333937,4,B001PO3390,"This video is a very good overview of Hinduism for novices.  The only drawback is the thick British accent of the narrator, which makes some of the place names difficult to understand.  If you want to get a primer on Hinduism, this is well worth the price.",1296000000,5,256,4.425531914893617

The project could have been dealt more in depth.",1261872000,6,83,4.6
