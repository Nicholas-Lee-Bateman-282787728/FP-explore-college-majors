1833950,1,B00008AOTW,"Extremely bad acting, appalingly flat direction and an atrocious screenplay  make this one of the most tedious films I have ever had to endure watching.",1051574400,13,152,5.08
1833951,4,B00008AOTW,"Okay, first a word of warning: don't go looking for top-notch Hollywood production quality in this movie -- it's nowhere to be found in ""Under One Roof"".  The script needs work; the editing leaves much to be desired; the acting is pretty bad; the music is even worse.
And I loved it.
Despite its technical flaws, I found myself wrapped up in the story pretty quickly, and by the time the end came along, I was grinning from ear to ear.  ""Under One Roof"" may never win any production awards, but the story is solid and there are many great moments during the movie that had me laughing out loud.
As I said earlier, don't look for A-list production quality.  It's more like a film class project meets ""The Real World"" meets public access television meets soft core porn.  Let me clarify that I don't say 'porn' because of the full-frontal nudity or the sex scenes -- they are almost always appropriate to the story in context (and the guys are cute!).  Plus, I've seen MUCH more explict hetero sex scenes on network TV. I said 'porn' because that's what the acting and music quality reminded me of several times throughout the film.
Despite the weak acting overall, however, there were some very real moments which struck a chord with me.  When they happen they really stand out, at least to me.
I gave it four stars and higly recommend it.  If you overlook the technical shortcomings and approach it with an open mind, you'll find a touching little love story with quite a few laughs.  I'll keep this one in my collection.",1050969600,108,1521,4.545787545787546
1833952,4,B00008AOTW,This simple movie was fun to listen. It showed a relationship of two young guys within a family environment. Not abvious for a mother to realize that her son was gay and his  boyfriend living with them in her house. There is a nice endding. You should see it.,1050883200,,259,4.285714285714286
1833953,4,B00008AOTW,"This movie answers the question: What would happen if a closeted gay guy should happen to fall in love with a tenant in his and his unsuspecting mother's house? This sweet movie, while far from being polished is very absorbing.
I began watching this movie and was somewhat conscious of the fact that this was not a big production. As is the case with many gay films, it makes up for in story what it lacks in production value. Still, about 10 minutes into the movie I found myself completely involved in the story.
Jay, a closeted young man still lives with his mother and grandmother in San Francisco. While there are others who he is out to (his female best friend who his mother is desperately trying to set him up with and his very out gay best friend who keeps trying to set him up with anything that moves)he keeps his sexuality a secret from his mother who he feels would not understand. That is until the day his mother rents their basement to Robert, an adorable gay guy, and things start to heat up immediately.
Should he risk losing his mother's approval on what could be true love...or risk losing the man of his dreams?",1049155200,25,1132,4.447115384615385

1833963,5,B00008AOTW,"The idea is good, the realization maybe a little low budget, but at least the romance feeling of the movie was preserved. Daniel is really a cute guy, a little nerdy, a lot sweet; such sweetness is well matched into Robert, country boy who moves to big city and rent a room from Daniel's mother. If being gay and in the closet while living with your mother was possible until then, now Daniel has temptation under the same roof, a temptation that is more than willing to help Daniel out of the closet. I liked the romantic feeling of the movie, and also that basically it remained light: Robert's relationship with his own family is good, and his own mother knows about her son's homosexuality and is supporting; but also Daniel, when it will be the time, will not have so much trouble, that is since, in the end, both mothers love deeply their sons. One thing I didn't understand, but in the end it was more funny than anything else, is the free nakedness all over the movie: not only Daniel, but also a lot of supporting characters were not shy with their naked flesh... as I said, since it was done with a litght tone, it was more funny than sexy.",1301788800,,1150,4.403755868544601
1833964,3,B00008AOTW,"This very simple story is produced in a very simple way; ""Making Love"" or ""La Cage"" it's not. The cultural crosscurrents are not deeply examined; other than the leads, the characters are cut-outs. The only other character with much depth is the Chinese grandmother, who here takes the role of Guanyin. Yet the obviousness is sweet, and the very basic cinematics and the somewhat stilted acting drop away. The story's development is at a coloring book level and that's what gives its charm. Not challenging, not great cinema even by lowest budget indie standards, ""Under One Roof"" nevertheless makes a charming light entertainment for dinner.

You can find much better gay themed movies out there. I read so much about this movie and finally decided to get one and see myself. The quality of acting wasn't what I expected and entire movie looks like a cheaply made movie with the budget as little as possible. I really wonder if those actors and actresses were found on the street to make this movie !?! The story wasn't that good either and every other scene is kind of awkwardly put together. If you like to see a movie with bad acting and a bad story but to see a few scenes of full nudity(even an elect penis in one scene,they could have had real sex scenes if they wanted to show this much nudity),this one is for you but don't expect anything more.",1286236800,2,857,4.263803680981595
1833966,4,B00008AOTW,"Synopsis

We've all been there when it's time to come out to your mother but you're still pussyfooting around telling her. That's exactly what we have in this movie. Under One Roof was directed by Todd Wilson. An Asian American family rents their downstairs to a gay male (Robert). When a pipe bursts within the first weeks of him moving in the mother decides it wold be okay if her son (Daniel) can share his bedroom with him. Things get complicated as they must acknowledge the feelings they have for each other and getting around Daniels mother.

Plot Rating

We've seen this plot before so it's nothing to write home about. There have been other movies that have executed, such as, Mambo Italiano. I'm not tired per-say of all the stereotypical gay movies but the good thing going for this movie is that it didn't rely on hot guys, too much sex, or ass hots to keep the story going. It stays true to it's plot and creates a nice story. Plus, Jay Wong is rather adorable in this film. For this reason the plot gets a 6 out of 10.

Actors/Actresses

Jay Wong is the closeted Asian boy who wants to please his mother rather than be happy. This movie is the only thing he's done and it's a shame because he was rather convincing as a struggling guy. I would like to see him in more things but I don't know how far his acting abilities really goes. I think I'm biased because he cute. James Marks plays Robert and there isn't much to this character. It's merely to play a love interest for the main character. His development isn't necessary but he has a very accepting mother. I guess you could say he acted alright in this film, nothing really to complain about or praise. They get a 6 out of 10, only because Wong carried the film.

DVD Extras

We've got another TLA releasing film and it's some some stuff on it. There are outtakes that aren't funny but interesting to see how the cast interacted with each other and they seemed to have a pretty good time while filming the movie. There's a trailer for another film and we also have a commentary which is always cool to have. I'm a stickler for interviews though and this DVD tacks in that so I'm only going to give it a 5 out of 10.

Personal Thoughts

I found this movie enjoyable but it's no brokeback mountain and let's be frank here, it didn't have half the budget that movie had. It does a convincing job at showing a young boy trying to find happiness between love and his family though.

I recommend this movie to first time gay film watchers or hardcore fans of gay film. The DVD gets a 17 out of 30.",1265932800,,2562,4.341004184100418
1833967,5,B00008AOTW,"This was a really touching ""first"" love story. It was sort of like watching a home movie, rather than a professional job. We have watched it several times and enjoyed it thoroughly.",1229731200,,181,4.6875
1833968,4,B00008AOTW,"As other reviewers have stated this is a low budget independent movie and that does show in the technical details. However, that does not take away from the story (which is enjoyable) or the lead actors (who are attractive and do an excellent job in their roles). This is a straight forward love story with the basic plot that most loves stories have. The differance is that you come to care about and root for the characters. This movie is a fun way to spend 75 minutes.",1228521600,,471,4.425287356321839
1833969,1,B00008AOTW,"This movie stank from the very beginning and never got interesting or possessed any redeeming value.  Living in SF the idea of an Asian family dynamic appealed to me.  The mother was the best thing in the movie, no wait, the grandmother didn't say much and was possible the actor in the movie- just out of default.  The rest of the film, from the editing, sound, set design, actors all stank stank stank.  No more articulate review is required for such a time waster.",1207526400,,467,4.523809523809524
1833970,4,B00008AOTW,"A nice love story. Really great independent film. Love shows up in the weirdest places and here, right in your basement. Don't miss out on this film. Very simple but has the major cute factor.",1199923200,,192,4.514285714285714
1833971,4,B00008AOTW,Encouraging film letting us know that we can't give up on what we want.  The acting was kind of so so but I did enjoy the plot.,1184889600,,127,3.7037037037037037
1833972,5,B00008AOTW,"I watched this movie the other night with some straight friends. Sure, the director seems to be scoring some attention by showing some (really modest!) nudity, but the plot is intelligent and takes some unforeseen turns. The leading motive of two cultural backgrounds clashing might be disaggreaveated by the fact that the main character, a young asian twenty-something guy, is living with his mother after his dad died a few years ago. So there is only the mother-son conflict about the gay son shown.

However, the director develops those characters wisely and takes time and empathy to push the plot forward. So we learn about the inner feelings of the main characters, their fears and doubts. Thus, in the end, we are left with the encouraging fact that most of our fears about being gay are just internal and are not in fact backed up by real arguments. The mother learns to love her son and her new son-in-laws in the end.

It's refreshing that the film does not try to score political arguments about the two cultural backgrounds gettings along, but shows normality.

And by the way, it features some real nice shots of San Francisco, the city where I live. Now watch the movie!",1180915200,,1185,4.742718446601942
1833973,4,B00008AOTW,"The acting wasn't the greatest, but the movie itself was good.  I especially liked the ending.  Must have been made on an extremely low budget.  Again, another movie I am glad I added to my movie library.",1171497600,,204,4.45945945945946
1833974,1,B00008AOTW,"Within five minutes of watching this movie you can pretty much predict the entire plot. No surprises or anything all that interesting to watch in this movie. There is a lot of full frontal male nudity, but it certainally does not add to the plot.  Anyone with a camcorder could have shot this movie!",1164758400,2,299,4.537037037037037
1833975,5,B00008AOTW,"This film has won many awards, and now I know why! I love it! The two hot young stars, Jay Wong (Daniel) and James Marks (Robert) are great together in ""Under One Roof"". Their chemistry is awesome and they appeared to have enjoyed doing this film together as evidenced not only in the film, but the outtakes as well. A must see movie for anyone who loves gay themed films. It is dramatic, funny, romantic, erotic and adventurous. A great cast and a wonderful story blend together with great directing and a really well done film. Not a top notch Hollywood budget, but unless you're just looking to criticize, you will never notice. I thoroughly enjoyed watching it, and enjoyed the second run-through just as much. The DVD offers some nice extras as well, such as outtakes, a trailer and more. Video and sound quality is good. I have no beef whatsoever with anything I seen in this film. I highly recommend it! A very nice ""feel good"" movie with a happy ending.",1161993600,3,961,4.5606936416184976
1833976,4,B00008AOTW,"I enjoyed this movie so much. The main character, Robert, was pretty hott!! He was nice to look at. I'm not a big fan of Asian men, like Daniel, but I liked the relationship that Robert and Daniel formed. They had a sweet chemistry going, and it was sweet to see them together on screen. I thought that the best scene between them was when Daniel just got home from the ball, his phone rang, and Robert and him were already trying to get intimate. Daniel was talking to his mother, but Robert was still trying to keep the sexual agenda going. He was un-buttoning his shirt and kissing his neck and stomach. But then it got to be too much for daniel to handle while he was on the phone with his mother, that he told her that he had to go. It was cute and funny at the same time.

This movie is really good. I enjoyed watching it. I'm very pleased to own this dvd. A-.",1159401600,2,866,4.124260355029586
1833977,4,B00008AOTW,"I disagree with the review that says this is badly acted.  It may not be Streetcar Named Desire, but it is a gentle story of love, and the acting helps to bolster the clash of cultures and beliefs.  I enjoyed it, and the chemistry between the two handsome young men is quite believeable.",1154390400,3,287,4.39622641509434
1833978,4,B00008AOTW,"I'm sorry, but I looked beyond the quite obvious flaws and absolutely loved this film. I would have re-cast the mother, re-written several parts of the script, and directed the actors differently in a couple of scenes, but I still loved this movie! The guys are so cute -- especially Jay Wong (to steal a phrase from the character, 'I'd love to dip my chopsticks in his rice bowl!'). and they had a realistic chemistry going which came across quite nicely. Genuine and fun. That winsome smile of Jay's just grabbed me and I loved the very real way in which the two principle leads played with each other and obviously had fun in some of the more intimate scenes. I have several favourite gay movies which have a much larger budget, better scripts and direction, and better talent, but this one still managed, despite the problems with the film, to take me into the lives of the characters and engage me. I've watched it many times since my initial viewing and still find it a joy. That's more than I can say for other gay films I've purchased, films with impeccable production values. Time for me to go out and find my own Asian boyfriend!",1148256000,3,1139,4.533980582524272
1833979,3,B00008AOTW,"I felt the Asian actor attempted to do a good job in his part.  However, I got the impression the white guy never got into the part and was ""just there"".  Overall a good script that would have been excellent with two actors who were excited to play the parts they each signed on for.  Maybe one day it will be done again with actors who want to act.",1143504000,4,349,4.028985507246377
1833980,1,B00008AOTW,"If you are looking for a story line, good acting, secrecy, suspense, unsuspecting love. then buy Maurice. Under One Roof has none of the qualities that makes a movie, not only a hit, but at least interesting enough to watch all the way through. I had to force myself awake through endless minutes of idiocy where I just thought- what is the big deal. It seems to me that the movie focused on how the love between two mean was so hidden for the danger it would impose on the two of them. Honostly, how long does it take for two gay men who attracted to each other and to realize the attraction. Apparantly it takes the never ending length of the movie. Perhaps it should be titled ""The Tale Under One Roof That Never Ends"". My recommendation is to save your money and buy something else. If you are looking for a type of move that identifies impossible attractions then I recommend The Trip, or Maurice.",1127692800,5,902,4.407185628742515
1833981,2,B00008AOTW,"I've seen many 'gay themed' movies but this one has to rank as one of the worst!  The acting is horrible, the lighting is horrible...well, it is a low budget offering.  But this is about as low as one can get.

The movie does have some redeeming qualities:  the casting of the two leads is o.k.  Not great, but o.k.  The casting of the best friend of the Chinese Boy (I think the character's name was Tony) was horrendous.  Where did they find this guy?  I can't believe anyone would touch him with a ten foot pole.  He gave me the creeps...yet he had so many affairs in this film...something that was totally unbelievable to me.  I give this film two stars instead of one because of the believability of the two main leads.  But the script, the supporting cast and all the production values are simply terrible.  This movie was a complete waste of time and money.",1107043200,3,864,4.39873417721519

1833999,5,B00008AOTW,"Yes, it's low budget.  Yes, it's not refined.  That is precisely what makes this movie special and believable.  It is almost like a watching a documentary about a young man reaching a crossroads in his life and nearly botching it, simply because he has never been at such a crossroads before.  I know the acting is not refined.  While I was watching the film I came to believe the two actors were lovers before they started filming, reliving what had happened to them in real life.  Of course, they weren't.  I forgot they were acting.  The script doesn't sound like a script.  It sounds like real people talking.  This is the way two fairly vanilla people of whatever gender do fall in love.  Seems to me something so true to life can't be bad.  Another reviewer came down hard on the woman playing the young man's mother.  She sounded to me precisely like Chinese-American women of her age I have heard on the street in NY or San Francisco.  They don't speak English with the same intonation as Tom Brokaw.  Yes, the ending is predictable, or is it? No one in the film comes down with AIDS.  Now isn't that a switch?  It is simply a typical love story with the young people in conflict with a traditional parent.  It's almost, ""oh, by the way, the two protagonists happen to be of the same gender"".  That's its strength, taking a predictable story, dropping two guys instead of a guy and girl into it, and acting like it is the most natural sort of film in the world.",1099785600,5,1469,4.4344569288389515

Well, I was just too curious to let this go so I went a head and took the movie home thinking ""hec, this movie cannot be a true disaster because it received many reputable awards"".  I raced to my bedroom, closed the door, dimmed the lights, took a deep breath, got really comfortable, turned on my portable DVD player, and quietly watched the movie.  Well, I was pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed it.  Yes, the acting and dialogues were quite stiff and most of the technical aspects of the film needed much rework.  For some strange reasons, perhaps it was due in part to this amateurishness that gave the film some of its youthful, inexperienced charm.  Anyway, I think the film does have a convincing story line - witty, touching, and sexy.  Give the movie a try.  You will be surprised.",1083369600,19,1030,4.524324324324325

It was cute, and I didn't mind the production values or performances at all, and the sex scenes were very sweet and sexy, but at a more intellectual level this seemed to promise so much only to then fail to deliver.  This would be ok were it not for the fact that the hype around this seems to present it as some sort of exploration of White/Asian interactions in the gay community.  Given how non-white guys are oft viewed (if we are recognized at all) as trophies among some in the gay community (speaking as as a non-white gay guy), if we are willing to play out certain stereotypes, I assumed this would be quite a provocative theme to explore.  No such luck here.

I don't care what the description might lead you to believe - don't look for anything smart here.  It's a nice gay soap opera - which is great at that level.  Look for anything eles though and you'll be disappointed.

1834004,4,B00008AOTW,"I can't disagree with others that this wasn't a great movie. It's certainly low-budget, not well directed or edited, and decidedly amateurish. But it's entertaining and fun, and maybe hits a few chords just a little too close to home.
Daniel, the perfect Asian son, lives with his widowed mom and his grandmother in San Francisco, as filial Asian boys tend to be expected to. Also in the vein of the perfect son, he can't come out to his family, and his mom relentlessly keeps trying to set him up with women.
The family rents out the downstairs room, however, and a cute boarder (Robert) shows up to take the place. Sure enough, the two slowly but surely get together....
This movie is not totally about Daniel and Robert's budding romance.  Well, it is, but there's more to it than that.  The magic of the movie is the family's reaction, Daniel's newfound priorities, and how Robert's unassuming yet formidable role in each. It's the standard stuff the coming-out flicks are made of, but hey, it always manages to tug at the heartstrings, right? We've all been there before, or know someone who has.... or at least we all know how difficult it is to stand up against unreasonable expectations.
So yeah, everything about this DVD just screamed ""so-so""... but it's still worth a viewing.  Oh, and because this IS a DVD, after all... don't forget to take advantage of the special features, including the Director's Commentary cut.
