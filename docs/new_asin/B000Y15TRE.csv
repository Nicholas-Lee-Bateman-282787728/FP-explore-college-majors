It has really brought my playing to the next level.  The highlight is Black Stick, her final number that was absolutely incredible!  Thanks, Del!!",1251849600,,287,4.377358490566038

time music with interesting arrangements and chords. The songs and chords are presented well, I only wish there was a songbook with it that included the songs and chords for reference.",1471737600,,213,4.783783783783784
8230634,2,B000Y15TRE,"This is not an instructional video.  She plays lots of songs, sings along with them, and tells many little anecdotes.  I felt there was too much off-topic information.  Within the first five minutes she got confused at what she was trying to demo and what key she was in.  She even said:  This is where I always go wrong, so it makes me even more confused what chord I'm playing.  She demonstrates some licks, but she does not really know how to teach them. She said:  This is good practice for you to figure it out on your own.  I'm a high-intermediate player, and I had trouble following along. It was more of a cabaret performance than a teaching video.  She's a great player, but not a teacher.",1444867200,2,698,4.390625
8230635,5,B000Y15TRE,"This is a great tutorial by a brilliant artist. Very clear pictures and instructions. Going to be a lot of learning!
Few people can both play this brilliantly and teach. Very highly recommended",1440806400,,193,4.878787878787879
8230636,5,B000Y15TRE,"Stunning music but I thought I was getting something that would teach me a beginner about the various styles for the blues and indeed this steller performer shows me that but she is so skilled it is a little scary for me.
Yet the production value and the wonderfully open and generous performances are just magical.
Perhaps it is meant to be a star to aim for but right now I am only looking for clear examples of different styles and this was more than I could handle.
I am keeping this as inspiration but it is too advanced for me...as of yet.",1430784000,,545,4.300970873786408

8230638,4,B000Y15TRE,"Del Rey is a good teacher.  However, it will take me some time to figure out how to do this.  I would consider this intermediate to advanced.  I am a beginning and will need to take it slow.  It is great to hear her play her Ukulele.",1378857600,2,233,3.893617021276596
8230639,5,B000Y15TRE,This is a highly edUKEcational ragtime and blues video. Del Ray is both a great teacher and player!  Highly recommended for intermediate and advanced players.,1376438400,,158,5.32
8230640,5,B000Y15TRE,"Del Ray is affable, accomplished, and fun.  She teaches five blues songs, plus a couple of scales.  I'd wish for more blues basic scales and patterns, and less songs, but this is still a great DVD if you wish to learn one of the five tunes it teaches.",1372464000,,251,4.208333333333333
8230641,4,B000Y15TRE,"I found this DVD more for the intermediate/advanced student. Good to see some very old material covered from the early part of last century. My only criticism was that no mention was made of being able to adapt these learnings to more contemporary material. Del is an excellent player and this would be a great acquisition to any serious student's libary.

8230642,3,B000Y15TRE,"Good to watch and listen to, but I was frustrated because I couldn't follow the picking paterns. I think it is presumed the listener knows and understands music language. You need to watch it many many times and in slow motion to learn anything. Wow can she play tho.",1330300800,4,267,4.469387755102041
