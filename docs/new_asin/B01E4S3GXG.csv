7730179,5,B01E4S3GXG,"A fantastic idea to release this version of Tarzan. It contains far more of the original author Edgar Rice Burroughs' science fiction element than the Disney version, and also presents a far more articulate and well groomed (haircut, that is) Tarzan. Although titled ""The Complete First Season"" here, this is actually the entire series of the Filmation cartoon show ""Tarzan, Lord of the Jungle"".
That said, I think WB gave it their new title, because there were additional cartoons made (some running only 11 mins instead of 22) for Filmation's subsequent shows, ""Batman/Tarzan Hour"" (1977),  ""Tarzan and the Super 7"" (with Web Woman, Superstretch & Microwoman, Manta & Moray, Freedom Force, Jason of Star Command; 1978-79), and ""Tarzan/Lone Ranger Hour"" (1980) and ""Tarzan/Lone Ranger/Zorro Hour"" (1981).
My guess is WB might be planning to release those as a 2nd season of Tarzan later on. The Batman segments were released around 2007 as ""New Adventures of Batman""(under which title the cartoons were once also originally screened). The Freedom Force segments were released in 2006 as part of ""Space Sentinels + Freedom Force"" box set, as Hercules was a character in both shows. The Lone Ranger & Zorro segments were released as ""Lone Ranger/Zorro Hour"" in 2 volumes a few years after that. And a complete ""Jason of Star Command"" box set also came out in the late 2000s, as well as its prequel series ""Space Academy"". So if you want my recommendations, (1) check Amazon marketplace for those great releases already out, and (2) order this Tarzan series too. The animation, 1970s incidental music by Yvette Blais and writing quality in all of these great shows are among Filmation's best, even ahead of He-Man and She-ra (good as they are). I'm really pleased that WB are making these terrific shows available on Amazon now.",1462838400,41,1826,5.026402640264027

7730186,4,B01E4S3GXG,"Like other posts, this is both brilliant and bittersweet, in one collection.  We all have waited years to have a quality TLOTJ on DVD. We finally get the DVD, but it was rushed to market. Case in point: The 3rd Episode ""The Golden Lion"" is missing a small part of the story. When the episode comes back from commercial break, there is already dialogue going on between Tarzan and the monkey people. They cut the part where the village is ransacked and N'kima is taken. Seems minor but it leaves out a key part of the story. I have bootleg copies that are better quality and include this scene. Simple editing and care would have caught this. However, I too digress. I think we all need to see the other 20 episodes get released, as there are 36 total and this contains 16. This is a solid buy to have for your collection. I just have to agree that with modern technology, WB could have polished this up and restored a classic, to all its glory.",1501632000,,944,4.363636363636363

7730193,5,B01E4S3GXG,"This was my favorite cartoon as a kid, and I'm glad to say that they held up pretty well over the years.

This animated Tarzan is more faithful to the Edgar Rice Burroughs version than any of the movies.  The stories are quite good, considering they've got about 21 minutes for each one. The art is highly realistic, though they've taken shortcuts in the animation, but that is as I remember it as a kid, so I am not disappointed in that.  This is a noble, intelligent Tarzan that we can all look up to. Now, if only they would put season 2 on DVD!",1490486400,,548,4.2

7730198,5,B01E4S3GXG,"Yes, video quality is an issue.  But for those of us who waited for Saturday mornings just to see this show, and have waited since DVDs first came out to collect these, this set is pure nirvana.  Would I want to see these remastered from the original films, of course.  But considering how many companies have had their hands on these after Filmation closed up, we should consider ourselves lucky we've gotten this.  All Filmation shows that have been released on DVD by various companies look bad.  The only exception is Star Trek The Animated Series and that's only because Paramount got their hands on the film right from the start.

This is the best representation of Tarzan, bar none.  Whenever I read any of the stories or comics, these are the voices I hear (sometimes with the music too).

7730204,5,B01E4S3GXG,"Don't let the unimpressive artwork and logo on the cover fool you: ""Tarzan, Lord of the Jungle: The Complete First Season"" is a treat for Tarzan fans, and for those who just want to relive childhoods sitting in front of the TV with a bowl of cereal on Saturday mornings.

This series, produced by the now-defunct Filmation Associates, is the most faithful screen treatment of Edgar Rice Burroughs' jungle hero, even adapting several of his novels, including ""Tarzan and the City of Gold,"" ""Tarzan and the Golden Lion,"" and ""Tarzan and the Forbidden City.""

Tarzan himself is intelligent and well-spoken, not the ""Me Tarzan...you Jane"" simpleton depicted in the low-budget live-action films and perpetuated in popular culture. He's accompanied in his adventures by N'kima the monkey, as in the novels. And as voiced by Bob Ridgely, he's the noble savage, rather than than the enlightened surfer dude of Ron Ely's live-action prime time TV series from the 60s.

The jungle man also speaks Mangani, the language Burroughs invented for his great apes. Tarzan refers to the animals populating his jungle by their Mangani-language names.

Filmation's animation also shows what creators who care can do on the limited budgets of 1970s Saturday morning television animation. Animators used the rotoscoping technique to create realistic action, and blended the Filmation house style with that of Burne Hogarth, the illustrator best known for his work on the Tarzan newspaper comic strip.

Writers attempted to appeal to children as well as Tarzan fans. In addition to venturing to lost cities, this jungle lord also battled space aliens in UFOs and medieval knights.

Still, this series is an excellent example of a Saturday morning cartoon series that both children and adults can watch without having their intelligence insulted.",1477008000,3,1822,5.222602739726027

Filmation Studio's Tarzan was the best looking animated series on the air from the 1976-1977 season and made other cartoons look like stick figures in comparison.  The series boasted rotoscoped action sequences, lush backgrounds and great stories.  As a testament to the ratings success of Tarzan: Lord of the Jungle, the following season, Filmation Studios was given carte blanche to create any action series that the studio desired which resulted in Tarzan and the Super 7.

7730221,5,B01E4S3GXG,"With the release of The Legend of Tarzan to theaters, naturally anything Tarzan from the past has been brought to the forefront. One of those is the DVD release of the first season of Tarzan, Lord of the Jungle, the 1976 animated series. The 1970s was the Golden Age of Saturday morning cartoons when all three of the major networks (ABC, NBC, and CBS) broadcast cartoons from morning until noon. There was something for everyonefrom superheroes and science fiction to teenage hijinks and a dog that helped solve mysteries.tarzan 2

Tarzan, Lord of the Jungle ran on CBS from 1976 until 1980 and was produced by the Filmation studio that also produced cartoons such as The Archies, Batman, Superman, He-Man And the Masters of the Universe, Star Trek, and the live-action Shazam series. Along with Warner Brothers and Hanna-Barbera, it was one of the three major producers of animated programs from the 1960s through the 1980s.

The two DVD set collects the first 16 half-hour episodes of the series and was one of the best animated shows of the era for several of reasons. First, it featured an animation style based upon the art of longtime Tarzan newspaper strip creator Burne Hogarth. Secondly, the series was one of the more faithful adaptations of the works of Edgar Rice Burroughs. And finally, Tarzan is depicted as extremely intelligent and articulate instead of the grunting jungle man of many of the films.

In the series, Tarzans sidekick is a monkey named Nkima which again, is faithful to Burroughs novels while Cheetah was created strictly for the movies. Tarzan was voiced by actor Robert Ridgely who appeared in many films and TV shows as well as providing the voice of Thundarr the Barbarian in that animated series. Another regular was Alan Oppenheimer who voiced a couple of different characters in the series. The venerable Oppenheimer also provided the voices many other well-known animated characters including Skeletor, Man-At-Arms, BlackStar, Ming the Merciless, and even Mighty Mouse.

The series debuted with Tarzan and the City of Gold as Tarzan must aid the beautiful Thia against the evil Queen Nemone. The episodes not only feature adventure but also elements of fantasy, science fiction, and mystery. In Tarzan and the Vikings Tarzan encounters the descendants of Vikings who were blown off course and ended up in Africa several centuries earlier. Tarzans Rival finds him facing off against a robotic duplicate that is blamed for mistreating animals. He even has to battle aliens who are trying to take animal specimens back to their own world in Tarzan and the Strange Visitors.

Like a lot of animated shows of the era the violence was extremely tame and Tarzan often finds ways to solve problems without fighting. But while the show is kid friendly, Tarzan, Lord of the Jungle still has enough action and adventure to keep things lively.

Unfortunately there are no extras in the set which is a disappointment. It would have been nice to get some thoughts from surviving cast members or Tarzan historians. A must for Tarzan fans!",1469577600,,3063,4.97265625

7730225,5,B01E4S3GXG,"I have waited many many years for this and I was not disappointed, the quality is wonderful and the discs work great.  Normally I don't get things like this so soon after they come out.  I tend to wait for the full series release.  However, I was not inclined to do that because I did not want this to be another Godzilla situation (STILL waiting for the commercial release of the second season of that 80's cartoon.)  My hope is that, if they get enough early sales, they will see that they would do well by releasing the rest of it as soon as they can.  Let's hope that works.

I have been seeing, in other reviews, complaints about the poor picture quality of the videos.  I have to say that the quality isn't the best BUT I'm okay with that.  I think that, from a purely nostalgic sense of things, having the video images look like they did when they aired on TV back in the days of antenna's and CRT sets, it really gives a greater sense of the show and the time it came from.  Too many attempts at enhancing the quality of older shows I think actually detract from them as the images from the time are more reflective of that time.  I think with things like this, having the images on par with original broadcast quality brings back more of the connection to the show than do images that have been retooled to such a degree that you can count the hair's on Nakima's tail.

The typical Filmation animation style is used, but the series is much better animated than similar shows of the time. Please note that the episodes have NOT been remastered at all and while the viewing experience is overall ""okay"" (about a 6-7 out of 10), there are persistent vertical light white lights that display through the episode's run.

7730235,5,B01E4S3GXG,"Debuting on CBS in Fall 1976,""TARZAN,LORD OF THE JUNGLE"" was a fresh and well made animated TV series,based on the Edgar Rice Burroughs creation! this Filmation Associates produced cartoon series was a first for the studio,since making the scene on Saturday morning TV with ""THE NEW ADVENTURES OF SUPERMAN"" in 1966,and other cartoon shows based on DC Comics' iconic characters,at that time! the TARZAN cartoon series was well animated,using very realistic animation rotoscoping,for a limited animation series! Filmation's artists and animators did incredible justice to the looks and design of Tarzan,even going so far as to use the famous ""Ape Call"" from Johnny Wisemueler,to give their cartoon series an authentic and accurate look,which was first class all the way,and damned good! the cartoon series was extremely superior to most of Saturday morning's Fall 1976-77 TV season,where it would dominate CBS Saturday mornings for the next several seasons! the DVD box cover however,does this Filmation production no type of justice,whatsoever! veteran actor Robert Ridgley,a one time cast regular of Warner Bros. Television's ""THE GALLANT MEN"" series for ABC in Fall 1962,was the voice of Tarzan,along with various voice actors such as Linda Gary,shortly before joining CBS""s popular ""DALLAS"" TV series,and Alan Oppenheimer,who went on to voice ""Skeletor"" in Filmation's ""HE-MAN"" series in 1983,and Ted Cassidy,""Lurch"" from TV's ""THE ADDAMS FAMILY"",who had also began a successful voice over career in cartoons throughout the 60s and 70s,also contributed to this 1976 cartoon series!  ""TARZAN,LORD OF THE JUNGLE""  stayed very true to the character,and was well depicted in this cartoon series,as it kept the adventures on a basic and non violent pace,along with the educational and ecological values that Filmation was known for,with many of their shows! but the real star of this series,was the well made animation that was used,which was something of a first for Filmation,back when they made their cartoons on a cheaper budget,which,by the way,were still well made!
the studio's animation budget was obviously given a little more funding,for their next,and greatly impressive TV animated film called ""FLASH GORDON:The Greatest Adventure Of Them All"",which showcased Filmation's superior production values at the time,but it had first started with TARZAN,and it made a great difference,here!  Lou Scheimer & Norm Prescott,may they truly rest in peace,were Hanna-Barbera's main competition in those great days of the cartoon business,,and while they had to endure their share of unkind and harsh criticism with their cartoons,they were still superior enough to hold their own,and TARZAN was a great example! i recommend this DVD to only the finest of groups,who knew and understood the marvelous animation production values that this show used,as it was actually twice as good as Walt Disney studio's previous full length cartoon in 1998,if not better,and especially for a Saturday morning cartoon series of it's type! Robert Ridgley also went on to voice ""THUNDARR THE BARBARIAN"" for Ruby-Spears in Fall 1980,and later became a Network TV announcer in the mid 80s!",1466985600,3,3166,5.496919917864476
7730236,4,B01E4S3GXG,"While the show was toned down in terms of violence (the show was made in the late 1970s during the height of non-violent children's television programming); Tarzan, Lord of the Jungle, was one of the most accurate depictions of the character created by Edgar Rice Burroughs. The imagery was based on Burne Hogarth's work, a favorite of ERB. They show Tarzan as an intelligent and articulate individual. The use of N'kima, Tarzan's monkey friend, and the language of the Mangani (the ape-like beings who raised Tarzan) was refreshing as decades of Cheeta the Chimpanzee and Tarzan's monosyllabic utterings.

While it was great to see these episodes of Tarzan, Lord of the Jungle, once again; the experience was bitter sweet.
- The cover art should have been taken from the series itself. All they used on the box were two small images from the shows and those appeared on the back cover. (I've been noticing this type of artwork on many new DVD releases of older movies and television shows. Are the studios trying to denigrate these older productions?)
- The DVDs were made from worn master copies with obvious impairments. Surely, better masters could have been found and used!
- This set is labeled as ""The Complete Season One"" and, while that is accurate, the company would have done better for itself and the customers by releasing the set with all of 36 episodes from the shows four seasons (Tarzan, Lord of the Jungle; The Batman/Tarzan Adventure Hour; Tarzan and the Super 7 [season 1]; and arzan and the Super 7 [season 2]). Was this done to test the waters to see if customers are interested? Or for budgetary reasons? Or is there some legal issue with the other three seasons?

My fervent hope is that they will release the remaining seasons soon. As a fan and a collector, I would love to watch ALL of the episodes again!",1466899200,6,1832,4.739811912225705

7730241,3,B01E4S3GXG,"First of all, Filmation Studios' TARZAN, LORD OF THE JUNGLE is one of the best Saturday morning adventure shows of its era (1976-1979). Well-written and extremely respectful to the spirit of Edgar Rice Burroughs' character and stories, this Tarzan adaptation stands among the best to date. Yes, 1970s animation was limited compared to today, and Filmation relied heavily on re-using animation in order to stay within budget and keep the work in the U.S. rather than farming it out to inferior overseas contractors like rival studio Hanna-Barbara. But the show is extremely well-designed, with lush backgrounds, fine character design, and a generous use of rotoscoping, which helps keep our hero's movements realistic and dynamic. Voice actor Robert Ridgley (who also voiced Flash Gordon and Thundarr the Barbarian) is perfectly cast as the Lord of the Jungle. The stories are very much in the mold of Burroughs' later Tarzan novels, with the ape man encountering a plethora of lost cities and civilizations in his remote jungle home.

So why only three stars? Well, because Warner Brothers has completely messed up this blatant cash-grab release. The prints used for this collection of the series first ""season"" of 16 episodes are in terrible shape, with an almost unrelenting barrage of scratches, specks, dirt and faded colors. No effort whatsoever appears to have been put into this release. There certainly was no restoration work done, and I can't prove it, because I have nothing to compare against, but it appears that these are syndication prints with a few seconds missing, as evidenced by awkward cuts halfway through each episode.

And I don't want to even discuss that horrid, eye-bleedingly amateurish cover art, which is completely off-model and poorly drawn. Heck, even the logo is wrong.

I'm pleased to finally have these great cartoons on DVD, and hope they'll eventually release the remaining episodes. But this two-disc DVD set is just an embarrassment to Warner Brothers and an insult to the creators of the series... and its fans.",1466380800,27,2052,5.156156156156156
7730242,2,B01E4S3GXG,"I gave two stars to the mastering and editing. The picture quality leaves a lot to be desired. There are lines and blemishes in the episodes. It looks like whatever tapes they had lying around, they transferred to disc without any restoration or repair. Some of the episodes have missing sequences that make the episodes confusing. For years I had bootleg dvds of the entire series and I was hopeful that an official release would have better picture quality. I should have skipped this release and just watch the non-commercial videos I own.

The show itself holds up very well for being 40 years old and is very faithful to Edgar Rice Burroughs (except that all the blood and violence have been removed. It was a Saturday morning kid's show after all)",1466294400,7,753,4.704545454545454
7730243,2,B01E4S3GXG,"While I was very excited to see this cartoon was coming to DVD, as it was one of my favorite Saturday morning shows, I am very disappointed with the treatment the material received in being transferred to DVD.

The low rating reflects the quality of the DVD, not the program itself, as this was a five-star Saturday morning cartoon show featuring many elements faithfully adapted from the original Burroughs stories. The overall quality of the presentation is disappointing -- Tarzan deserved better!

Watching the first episode had me wondering if this was a bootleg of some sort rather than an official release. As noted in other reviews, there were horizontal lines running through pretty much the entire first episode. Worse yet, the first time I screened the DVD I had a friend over who I wanted to share the show with. Needless to say, the poor quality of the first episode didn't make for a good first impression.

And yes, I am going to complain about the cover art. The awkward looking cover does not reflect the actual appearance of the series, another element that gives the impression that this is some sort of bootleg set.

But the bad news is that this is the official release for this series. At $15, this DVD is overpriced for what you get. Pass this one by until it goes on deep discount.

Hopefully this series will one day get the high quality release it deserves...",1466208000,7,1385,4.683127572016461

7730245,3,B01E4S3GXG,"First off: this review is in two parts.

The show: ""Tarzan, Lord of the Jungle"" was a huge part of my childhood -- along with the Johnny Weissmuller movies that showed on one of our local UHF stations, this was my introduction to the Ape Man.  The series does a great job of showcasing two relatively little-known features of Tarzan: his intelligence, and the incredible worlds he would encounter.  Because of that, this is my favorite Tarzan TV series, and I highly recommend it to fans of Tarzan and of fantastic adventure.

The DVD: I get that this was a low-budget 40-year-old Saturday morning cartoon, and the only reason we have this DVD is because there's a new Tarzan movie coming out... but I really wish Warner Brothers had invested some time and money into cleaning it up.  Some episodes look good, others look faded and washed out, on a par with bootleg VHS dupes I've seen at comic book conventions.  I was hoping we'd get something at least as good as the DVD of Filmation's Flash Gordon, so this is disappointing.

So... if you love Tarzan and can get past the video quality and invest in the show itself, this is a great DVD.",1466121600,4,1141,4.536585365853658
7730246,4,B01E4S3GXG,"There's been allot already written about the quality of this DVD series that was released June 14, 2016. While I realize the profitability of a DVD set with a pristine cleanup and color correction (like Spider-man '67) was probably not likely here, I do think some basic cleanup should have been considered as part of standard procedure for anything coming to market. At bare minimum the white lines in the first 15 minutes of play should have been digitally taken out. Not at all hard by today's standards. At any rate between that and the noted edits, the studio should have been respectful to the consumer and at least stated these problems with a note about the fragile nature of the master tapes resulting in a collection that does not meet all modern day standards. Other sets have done this where little to no improvements were made, most notable Rocket Robinhood. That was even stated on the box set cover so that the consumer understood what they were buying. So I can appreciate some of the dismay expressed by a few of the reviewers here.

With that said, I did find the picture to be better than any secondary market versions that have been available for years. No, those versions didn't have the white lines in them but the image and color is much better defined here than any multi-generational copy on the secondary market. Anything coming from the master tape is, by rule going to trump anything recorded off of television from inferior recording methods used decades earlier. So there is still some warranted value in having this series, although the edits in places make for a solid argument if you are a completist and want the intended version of those episodes on display. Translation: Keep those secondary copies for those reasons. But if I'm wanting to just enjoy the show on it;s own terms for nostalgia sake, this DVD set will easily fill that void. It looks descent on a 47 inch HD television so whatever master tapes they had available did not degrade that bad.

When it comes to television shows being released with a bad picture, the biggest loser remains Beauty and the Beast. That show barely passes for VHS grade quality, so seeing what the bottom looks like certainly allows room for interpretation moving upward. If I were going to just look at animated features, I would say 1980's Flash Gordon is near the bottom. This is not remotely that bad. It has more than enough presentation to be watched on a big flat screen television so that's a good starting point. No, it's far from perfect, but the picture is not degraded enough that it can't be enjoyed as presented. I would say the Groovie Goolies is a good comparison to the quality noted here. So while the criticisms are absolutely merited here, I do see value in getting an improved picture than what has been available by any other means. So lets support this installment so we can hopefully get the remaining episodes on a second collection. I think the show deserves to be released in it's entirety, but that won't happen if no one gets behind the debut release. I think master tape copies without basic fixes is better than nothing at all.",1466035200,5,3133,4.684210526315789
7730247,2,B01E4S3GXG,"I love this series, but due to the poor transfer, I'll hold on to my bootleg copies.

7730248,2,B01E4S3GXG,"I grew up watching cartoons like this and have many fond memories of this show in particular. I rushed to buy this as soon as I saw it so I could relive a small part my youth.  I wish this set was up to those memories.

As has been said previously, the cover art is atrocious.  It looks nothing like Tarzan from the series.  Why didn't they use a still from the show?

It has not been cleaned up, let alone remastered.

There is missing footage.  I spotted it first in Tarzan and the Golden Lion.  When Tarzan returned to the village, in the original broadcast we saw the damage to the village and the missing villagers, only the mother was there - hiding, and N'kima was missing.  On the disk, it jumps to her accusing Tarzan of causing trouble.  There are other episodes showing similar jumps / missing scenes or lines.  (Golden Lion was my favorite episode, so I noticed the missing footage right away.)

I wish I had waited until the set had been reviewed.  I can live without the remastering, but the missing footage is going to diminish my enjoyment.",1465948800,12,1056,4.409326424870466
7730249,4,B01E4S3GXG,"Filmation shows have had a very rough time on DVD. Most of their shows and movies have been released time-compressed, occasionally edited (""Diamond Ray of Disappearance"" from He-Man and ""Busted"" from Fat Albert being the two most notorious examples), and with messy noise reduction that turns fast-moving objects into featureless blobs. Warner and Paramount have had better luck, as the Filmation shows they own have, until now, been nicely restored from high quality elements. Now, with Tarzan, Lord of the Jungle's first season, Warner breaks form.

As seen on&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Saturday-Morning-Cartoons-1970s-Vol-1/dp/B001QU880W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Saturday Morning Cartoons: 1970s Vol. 1</a>, Tarzan looked its age: instead of a fresh transfer, we were presented with a very old video master that, while watchable, was definitely in need of a good restoration. This release is the same: the episodes are watchable, but clearly very old transfers (the Warner Bros. logo tacked on after the end credits look particularly dark and muddied). ""Tarzan and the City of Gold"" has some rather annoying white lines across the screen for a lot of the episode (which explains why it was taken off that earlier set at the last minute) and the commercial bumpers have been taken out, but if you have that DVD, you know what you're getting here. To further add to the air of ""we didn't spend much time on this"", the DVD immediately started playing the first episode when I popped it in. No menu, no ads, no FBI warning, nothing.

The show itself is pretty much what you remembered: the most faithful adaptation of the Tarzan books ever put to film. The writing, by Len Janson and Chuck Menville, is strong throughout, and multiple episodes adapt the actual books (or elements of them). The Mangani language is also liberally used, further enhancing the connection to Edgar Rice Burroughs' work. The art, while it of course uses stock footage and other ""cheats"", looks very good for its time, especially with the rotoscoped elements. The voice cast is excellent: Robert Ridgely soars as Tarzan, and Alan Oppenheimer and Lou Scheimer voice a wide variety of supporting characters with great skill. Guest actors are equally stellar, with Ted Cassidy, Joan Gerber, Barry Gordon, and (in the first of many roles for Filmation) Linda Gary are just as good here as they are elsewhere. And the music by Ray Ellis is some of the best he ever created for the studio: it sounds hot, primal, and suffocating, just like you'd imagine a jungle would feel like.

The bottom line, however, is that a lot of people are going to complain that this release ""looks like a VHS tape"" or ""my old bootlegs look better"" because there has been no restoration work AT ALL. Granted, there have been problems in finding suitable masters for many Filmation shows, as Lou Scheimer's personal vault and a recent UK vault find (which is how we got the recent He-Man soundtrack CD) have apparently been of little help with Tarzan, but Warner could have done a lot with these old tapes. Color correction and a simple round of dust-busting would have done wonders, and maybe solved a good deal of the issues with ""Tarzan and the City of Gold"" (because, as critics of Filmation incessantly point out, the animation is rather limited). Furthermore, there's the issue of the packaging: it's awful. Yes, there are minimal promotional materials in existence (and most include Batman, The Super 7, The Lone Ranger, and/or Zorro), but this series famously modeled its look after Burroughs' favorite artist, Burne Hogarth, and there are a great many artists out there who have been inspired by Hogarth and/or the animators at Filmation (just look at the cover art for all of those other Filmation DVD sets: they are way better than the editing, time-compressing, and poor restoration work would imply). They didn't even use the series' logo, WHICH WAS THE OFFICIAL TARZAN LOGO when the show aired. This whole release seems to be sloppy, and if the show wasn't SO good, I'd have docked well more than one star.",1465862400,58,4119,5.081240768094535

DVD QUALITY: The quality is extremely poor with white lines running through the episodes and other issues throughout, I have seen better bootleg copies, honestly I have. However, it is watchable.

I fear this was just a rushed set to promote the new Tarzan movie as the trailer for it is included on the set and thus no more will be released in the future. There are no other special features for this set.

I remeber when BCI released the Filmation titles years ago I collected pretty well all of them except 1 or 2 wich I just didn't care for. Sadly this wasn't released because of a dispute from what I recall on who actually owned the rights to the series. This is most likely the closest we will ever have of what Tarzan was truly meant to be. I no of no other version of Tarzan animated or real life that comes this close to the true image of the character. Unfornatly like 1 post has said this is not the entire series, this is only about half of the series. Their was a total of 36 episods wich at 22 min would be ruffly 792 min and according to Amazon this is quite a bit more than whats listed. I no for me and lot of others this was considered the best show of the Filmation titles, ya some may say He-Man wich I never cared for was but He-Man was just a spin off of Black Star and came out in mid 80's. Tarzan goes way beyond that. The music score is so perfect for this series the animation was well done even thou it was done in rotoscope and ya they did reused a lot of the cells but Filmation was on a tight budget and time restrictions at the time and that's the way things were. I for 1 will be preordering this and be glad to add it to my Filmation collection wich in my opion made the best kids shows during the 60's and 70's.

Filmation's ""Tarzan - Lord Of The Jungle"" series is perhaps one of the more faithful cartoon adaptations of Edgar Rice Burroughs' Tarzan novels; which makes this release by Warner Brothers of this highly popular Saturday morning shows a bit infuriating because the studio did not bother to clean up the videos and restore it to pristine condition for the transfer to dvd.  That said, all 16 episodes of season one are here to enjoy.
My favorite episodes were:  ""Tarzan and the City of Gold,"" ""Tarzan and the Strange Visitors,""  ""Tarzan and the Knights of Nimmr,"" and ""Tarzan at the Earth's Core.""
Perhaps the most intriguing episode is ""Tarzan and the Olymiads"" which is a very sly commentary on the dangers of idolizing sport heroes.

The noble Lord of the Jungle protects all of the beasts and jungle from harm in Season One of ""Lord of the Jungle"" by Filmation.  ERB fans are delighted to see Jad-Bal-Ja, the golden lion, and little N'kima, Tarzan's buddy.  Mangani is spoken here.  In 16 episodes Tarzan faces many adversaries including some from the fabled books.  Without even a knife this animated  Tarzan is a hero who upholds justice and moral principles.

If you've never seen this program do not be dismayed by the poor restoration ""effort"" or cheap packaging.  Since these episodes were new in the seventies, I still hear Robert Ridgely's voice as Tarzan.  Other voice actors are superb including the well known Ted Cassidy  and Linda Gary.
