1339320,5,B00004CQ7Q,"Like another reviewer, I saw this film years ago when it came out--having won some award or another and therefore in the theater for awhile--in Seattle. It was funny enough to go back a couple of times, and I have lamented the fact that it has only been available on quite hard to find VHS (mostly because I live in Taiwan), so I'm overjoyed to see it out on DVD. If you balk at watching dub overs because they usually can't keep the ball moving after the first bit of fun, you shouldn't worry about this one. The voice characterizations are tremendous, and the makers must have put their brains on overdrive to come up with the amount of continuity that does thread through the film--remade from the inside. The frame around the dubbing bit is contrived, but forgivable, and it's sort of humorously dated (cell phones the size of shoeboxes and all that). Don't miss this wonderful and very much neglected gem.",1227657600,3,910,4.588957055214724
1339321,5,B00004CQ7Q,"I'm an Aussie and I saw this movie years ago and had to buy a copy so I could watch it again and again.  There are some classic Aussie sayings in it, but overall it is just a very funny movie.  The scenes in the movie room are hilarious and how they do the voice-overs and sound effects which they had to ad-lib as the movie went along as it appears they had never seen it before.  It's not an example of how we talk all the time, but some of the sayings are just ""dead set"" Aussie.  If you want a good laugh, get this one, it's just pure entertainment.",1224115200,2,553,3.954954954954955
1339322,5,B00004CQ7Q,"I am Australian, and I so often get turned off by Australian movies that all seem to have to be done in some certain way that makes it look like the 1940's in country towns or deserts. But this one is the one I think of when thinking of not only my fav. Australian movie, but the top 5 all time favorite movies.

Now, don't let the title make you think it's a regular Hercules movie... let me explain.

The movie starts off with a guy who works for the biggest cinema chain in Australia. And while in a meeting with the president of the company, he hates what he is seeing that will be shortly distributed by them, and hates the way it is run. So he quits his job to go into business for himself.

He finds an old friend and re-opens a place called The Picture Palace, an old cinema complex that shut down years before the time of this movie (story wise) and it was once a great evening and special night out like an event for the people. So he does it up and on opening night, the other guy who owns the other cinema chains wants him to fail.

His idea was to show the last movie that showed there as the first movie to be shown on the opening night, the movie is Hercules. However, the other guy sabotages his plan by replacing the film of Hercules in English, to one in Italian. They only discover this 5 minutes till show time and the only thing they can do... is do the voices themselves!!!

Now the movie kicks in, you are seeing the original Hercules movie, or one of them, but with dubbed over voices... and the lines are hilarious. It becomes a complete redub of Hercules in a comedy and does so until the final 5 minutes of the film when it goes back to the characters who started it.

Don't be put off by comparing this to stupid re dubs that have infested the internet in recent years, this one is actually funny and doesn't rely on useless swearing to aim for humor. It has classic lines and memorable quotes galore.

It's a shame that this movie is not more popular then it is. It never gets mentioned in any top 10's, and hardly anyone seems to have ever heard anything about it. Maybe it did not get promoted well or something. But anyone I show it to, or the rare person who has seen it all love it and agree it is one of the funniest things they have ever seen.

Anyone who has seen this film always want to know when it is going to be released on DVD.

I can confirm it has been released on DVD. However, it does not seem to be a wide release in Australia. The only site I have seen it on is AtlanticDVD, in which I brought my copy from there. So that should answer the question for those who are despretly trying to find it on dvd. Use a search engine and type in that name i gave without any spaces and you will find them located in Australia.

The DVD does not contain any bonus features or subtitles. Not unless you consider biographies of the actors a bonus feature, I don't.

Believe me, if you are a fan of Mel Brooks, Monty Python or The Abraham/Zucker Brothers, then you should definitely find this movie to be up there amongst theres, as one of the funniest films ever made. And I Highly recommend this to anyone with a sense of humor.",1195084800,2,3164,4.170491803278688
1339323,5,B00004CQ7Q,"I saw this film while living in Australia and it is simply hilarious. A down-and-out loser decides to re-open an old theater and convinces two friends to help him. With opening night packed, they find that the film they're showing--Hercules, the last film shown before the theater closed--is in Italian with no subtitles. The trio decides to show the film anyway with their own voice overs. The result is so hilarious it makes you wonder what the heck the original plot was. I just wish this film was available on DVD!",1163808000,,518,4.7032967032967035

Light hearted and fun.",1382054400,,124,4.9523809523809526
1339374,5,B00004CQ7Q,"I first saw this when it came out and thought it was funny then. But since then my own humour has changed and I wondered if i would find it as funny now. The simple answer is yes. This excellent movie follows on the traditions of The Castle, The Dish & She's a Weird Mob (Nino Collota - Spelling?). This really is australian humour at it's very best and funniest. i thoroughly recommend this film to anyone and everyone. Great script, original idea and well executed by all involved.",1373760000,,483,4.438202247191011
1339375,5,B00004CQ7Q,Seriously. I've been looking for this here in the US for years!! I ordered a VHS but it was a euro format and would not play on any of my DVD players!,1362614400,,150,3.71875
1339376,5,B00004CQ7Q,This is a stupid movie overdubbed but hilarious. It is jaw droppingly inappropriate but so so funny. I have watched it many times,1357776000,,129,4.6521739130434785
1339377,5,B00004CQ7Q,"I heard about this movie from a good friend, who apparently had seen a showing of this in Australia.  Based solely on his description, I searched around the US for a copy, and was lucky enough to score a DVD on the east coast through Amazon.

Quick synopsis - a disgruntled large movie house chain employee decides to purchase a local, derelict movie house.  His aspirations of bringing back traditional movie house experiences (usherettes selling ice cream in the aisles!) is potentially scuttled after his evil, former boss, switches his opening premier movie with an italian-language version!!  The only response that he has, in a last-minute attempt to save the day, is to gather his forces and dub the movie in english.  Not knowing the plot doesn't slow him down, but it does result in unexpected hilarity!!

This has to be one of my favorite movies in the ""replaced soundtrack"" genre (think ""What's Up Tiger Lily"")!  Even though the setup is a bit slow, once the lunacy commences (our long-suffering movie house employees who are forced to over-dub the original movie with their own best guess on the plot) the movie quickly spirals into one of the absolutely funniest events I have ever had the pleasure to witness.  I can't imagine how many times the actors had to run through these lines before they were able to complete their dubs without cracking up!!  The quick and pithy replacement dialog is, as I note, sheer genius.  Having actually sat through the original of this movie, the dubbed dialog is worlds, nay, universes away from the mind-bogglingly boring real plot.  Whoever discovered this movie and decided to remake the wonderfully comic re-dubbed version should be immediately knighted!  Better yet, they should be tasked with finding other movies and making more of this genre!",1354060800,,1799,4.940199335548173
1339378,5,B00004CQ7Q,"Caught this movie many times on cable when I was back home in NZ ... a decade or more ago.  Been looking for it ever since.  Great down-under humor, great scripting.

The first bit, all the setting up of the plot is slightly boring... but if you can't watch through that, and get to the proper movie, you won't be disappointed!!!",1285977600,,336,4.524590163934426

7920014,5,B00004CQ7Q,"Gag dubs are a pretty common occurrence now, since any idiot with a computer and some film-editing software can create his own.

But not so much in 1993, when Australia produced one of the funniest gag dubs in existence, in a little movie called ""Hercules Returns"" -- a tongue-in-cheek redub of the old Italian movie ""Samson and the Mighty Challenge,"" which overflows with sex jokes, muscled men and wacky misunderstandings. You'd expect the framing device of plucky cinemaphiles saving an old theatre to be boring by comparison, but it's almost as funny.

Brad McBain (David Argue) is a prominent employee in Australi's largest theatre chain... but he's unhappy. His boss Sir Michael Kent (Michael Carman) is a cruel, callous employer who is always searching for ways to make money at the expense of his patrons. So Brad quits his job and leases the old Picture Palace, hires his porn-projectionist buddy Sprocket (Bruce Spence) and feisty publicist Lisa (Mary Coustas), and decides to show the last movie the last movie shown at that theatre.

But when the night rolls around, the trio discover that the Hercules movie is in Italian with no subs. Yep, Kent switched the film reels, as a form of revenge against Brad. So Brad, Sprocket and Lisa have only one option: live-dub the movie themselves from the projection booth.

In THEIR movie dub, the mighty but pinheaded Hercules goes to the land of Chlamydia, where he rescues Princess Labia from drowning. He's delighted to find out her mother Muriel owns the Pink Parthenon nightclub, but Muriel is determined to have Hercules marry her daughter -- which is complicated by the fact that Labia is in love with Testiculi, the son of Muriel's greatest rival. She makes it very clear she's uninterested in Hercules, whom she refers to as looking like a ""condom full of walnuts.""

So Labia arranges a fake message from Zeus saying that Hercules is actually gay, and that his perfect partner is Samson. Yes, Samson from the Bible. He's in this. Somehow. So Hercules is expected to fight Samson -- if he wins, he gets to marry Labia; if he loses, he marries Samson. And while the powerful yet wimpy Samson is quite enthusiastic about fighting Hercules, his girlfriend Delilah is not so pleased -- so she gives him a quick haircut. And somehow two other muscle-men -- the Scottish brawler Ursus and the flamboyantly gay Machismo -- are involved.

One of the best things about ""Hercules Returns"" is that it more or less follows the original plot of ""Samson and the Mighty Challenge."" The original movie was obviously pretty silly (one scene has an Irish little person clobbering an oracle with a giant matchstick) and was just an excuse to bring together four musclebound heroes from Italian cinema, even if their presence together makes NO sense at all. Seriously, Machismo and Ursus don't really have a reason to be here.

So obviously the movie becomes even more entertaining with a gag dub -- lots of sex jokes (""What is that man doing with his hand on my Labia?""), ethnic accents, Hercules frequently breaking into song, and making loud slurping noises anytime someone kisses. It's just far enough from the original movie to not just be riffing (Fanny is a crepe cook just PRETENDING to be a medium), but with the freedom to mock whatever is going on onscreen (""I'll fight you on one condition... that you lower your nipples!"").

It sounds like the framing device would be extraneous, but it's almost as funny to watch the projection-room mayhem as they produce all the necessary sound effects with nothing but their bodies and a few props. And it's kind of fun to see these passionate cinephiles (see Bruce Spence almost throttle someone over the autobiographical content of Scorsese's movies) going up against a scenery-chewing mogul who just wants money, money, money.

For people who love riffing, sword-and-sandal movies and/or Aussie senses of humor (""But she's only popular with Cretans!""), ""Hercules Returns"" is an absolute delight. Tie a yellow ribbon round the old oak tree...",1427414400,,4035,4.922058823529412
7920015,4,B00004CQ7Q,"This hard-to-find Aussie comedy is done in the style of Woody Allen's 1960's classic ""What's Up Tiger Lilly?"" or the ""Fractured Flickers"" TV series in that you have a film whose original dialogue has been stripped and replaced with new dialogue by a group of talented voiceover actors. ""Hercules Returns"" is a bawdy, very politically incorrect and wildly funny send-up of the Italian ""sword & sandal"" movies from the sixties.

I saw this film debut years ago while visiting Seattle (where the audience was given paper Hercules masks as souvenirs) and have always been surprised at how difficult it was to find on VHS & DVD. Admittedly, the jokes can get pretty raunchy, but they are, for the most part, integrated so cleverly that the end result puts this film in the top 10 of it's genre (whatever genre re-dubbed films are in!)",1426377600,,829,4.7972027972027975
