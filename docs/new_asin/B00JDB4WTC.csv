8649818,3,B00JDB4WTC,"My first spaghetti western (Those Dirty Dogs) and it was fun and kind of goofy.  Stephen Boyd is not known for lighthearted movies so watching him not snarl through this was interesting.  His was the only believable performance, and he is eye candy.

The action moved at the right pace.  The transfer was clear although there was a freeze up in the beginning of the movie.  Sound was good.  No close captioning.  Haven't watched Wanted yet.",1467849600,,440,4.7105263157894735

8649821,3,B00JDB4WTC,"Wanted

This film was also known as ""No soy un asesino"" (I am not a killer). This Spaghetti western was directed by Giorgio Ferroni, the same Italian director of some nice and interesting horror films such as Mill of the Stone Women and The Night of the Devils. Anyway, Ferroni directed Wanted in 1967, a film why a fine plot. Our hero, Gary Ryan (played by Giuliano Gemma) is appointed as Sherif in a town where some local guys lead by Gold and Frank Lloyd keep a lucrative business, stealing cattle, ruining and killing any competition in the neighborhood. As a result, Lloyd comes with a plot accuse of murder our new Sheriff, which manages to flee. During the rest, Ryan goes in a crusade to find the critical evidence to demonstrate how cattle are being stolen and his own innocence. Our bad guys try to avoid such a quest by the worst means possible.

Overall evaluation: This film is slightly under the average Spaghetti western. Despite this rather entertaining story, a main problem here is Giuliano Gemma and hos cardboard looking face. In short, did Gianni Garko play the leading role, this would have been a better film. In other words, Gemma is not convincing as the main character here. Second, the film is overall a bit more on the adventure side like many American westerns rather than your greedy Spaghetti western, the ones I like the most. On the good side: lots of shooting and killing (not a drop of blood though).

Technically, the DVD transfer by Wild East Productions is very good. I did not notice any of the issues of some previous reviewers. The film runs for 99 minutes. The audio is in English, without any subtitles.

Those Dirty Dogs

This film, also known as ""Los cuatro de Fort Apache "" or Charge!, is a good mid class Spaghetti western, when you rate Lone's films as first rate. This film was directed by Italian director Giuseppe Rosati in 1972. The film has a good story, where two Army officers and a sergeant led by Capt. Chadwood Willer (played by Stephen Boyd), and joined by Korano (played by Gianni Garko) go behind a gun and ammunition cargo previously stolen by Mexican revels and helped by an Austrian general who wishes Mexico to be part of the Austrian empire. The movie works fine overall, except may be for some short (fortunately) comedy like dialogs, particularly by this Austrian general. The acting is good enough. Overall, a worth watching movie for Spaghetti western fans.

Compared with Wanted, the DVD transfer by Wild East Productions on this film is excellent. Image is clean and comes in a nice widescreen format. The audio is in English, without any subtitles. . The film runs for 99 minutes.",1424563200,,2653,4.694623655913978
8649822,1,B00JDB4WTC,"One reviewer says the transfer of Wanted is jerky, another says it is fine. Well I am here to set it straight and say that the transfer for Wanted is wonky, annoyingly so. What we have here is a botched attempt to transfer a PAL sourced movie to NTSC which gives the image a herky/jerky movement when action is on the screen. I run into this problem myself on occasion re-encoding PAL discs to NTSC for personal use. Wild East, though a company full of heart for the genre, is rather shady when it comes to licensing films and actually take many of their transfers from foreign sources which usually results in what is known as ghosting as they do not properly convert the PAL speed up to NTSC and, as like the other reviewer stated, is present on many of their earlier releases. Wanted is the result of the worst of the worst and goes beyond ghosting to small jumps, or hiccups, when movement is on the screen. The reviewer that stated nothing was wrong obviously wasn't wearing his glasses while watching the film. Basically he seems to be like my grandparents who watch pan & scan full screen television stretched out on a widescreen television and they cannot tell the difference.  Yeesh",1421884800,4,1191,4.565420560747664
8649823,5,B00JDB4WTC,"Reviewer said that Wanted had a bad transfer so I went in expecting worse than the worst vhs transfer possible. Got a very clean print with a few blemishes. What is he smoking? Some of blondie's cigars? Those dirty dogs was pretty good. Wanted is always great. Buy Wanted with confidence. You will be pleased. Does not look bad at all. Guiliano Gemma is one fine specimen. If he brings the rump roast, I'll provide him with the tube steak and nuts. Also got plenty of squirt for him. It gets lonely on the trail, you know. Gianni Garko ain't too shabby either.",1420416000,,560,4.446601941747573
8649824,2,B00JDB4WTC,"I love Wild East and own over 40 of their releases in my collection and it pains me to give one of their DVDs a poor review since the company is purely a project of love for fans of the genre, but I have to say I was sorely disappointed with their recent double feature of ""Wanted"" and ""Those Dirty Dogs"" due solely on the transfer of ""Wanted"".

""Wanted"" looks to be taken from a PAL source which usually results in some ghosting when transferred to NTSC but ghosting I can easily live with. Wild East discs in the past have had ghosting and that doesn't bother me one bit. The problem with ""Wanted"" is that the picture has a jittery effect whenever there was action on the screen or when the camera moved. Another way to describe it is ""hiccups"", small little skips when things moved on screen. It was so annoying that I couldn't even finish the film, which is a dang shame as the film seemed to be a solid Giulliano Gemma effort.

The transfer of ""Those Dirty Dogs"" is great, making this release not a total wash. I will hold onto the DVD simply for ""Those Dirty Dogs"" but the transfer of ""Wanted"" kind of soured me on blind buying their discs in the future. I will have to hold off and wait for reviews for any future Wild East releases before purchasing, which is a shame as the quality of their releases was continually rising until this botched transfer of ""Wanted"" making this the most disappointed I've been with one of their releases since the flagging issues on the anamorphic widescreen transfers of ""Gentleman Killer"", ""If You Meet Sartana Pray for Your Death"" and ""Ringo the Lone Rider"".",1396569600,7,1600,4.4573378839590445
