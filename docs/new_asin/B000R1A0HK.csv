2856752,5,B000R1A0HK,"This show is imaginative (as implied by its own title) and clever.  It's good enough that adults can enjoy it, too!  The characters are well developed, the plots are often unexpected and there's plenty of nods to comedy classics (like Benny Hill and The Big Lebowski, for examples).  This is a great show.",1214438400,5,305,4.716981132075472
2856753,5,B000R1A0HK,"If you've ever had an imaginary friend or not, this hilarious and hysterical cartoon from the Cartoon Network is both entertaining and funny. There are some hidden jokes that the younger kids won't get and adults will not be able to not laugh at. The reference to 80's British band Frankie Goes To Hollywood was classic and quick witted and funny all at the same time. Some jokes fly by so fast that you don't get them until watching them over and over again and then you just laugh harder because you missed it the first time; at least it is in my case. I am a fan of cartoons like this and wish that there were many more shown like this. The characters themselves are all total and complete individuals of people that we all know or have known. There's a bully, a hero, his sidekick, a rich snob, an ecentric older person, a rebellious teen, and many more that you can identify with. The episodes are all funny and I have yet to see an episode that I didn't enjoy and or laugh out loud at. I love the character Cheese just because he's so darn annoying and loveable at the same time; he reminds me of young kids that want every last bit of your attention as you're trying to accomplish somethhing that's meaningful and important to you and here comes the little destructive and loud annoyance to remind you that they're there too and you need to provide them some attention...RIGHT NOW or suffer their wrath of a tantrum or just getting into trouble. Fosters is a show for the whole family. Sit down, watch it with the kids, and enjoy the laughter that follows.",1202515200,9,1563,4.411764705882353
2856754,5,B000R1A0HK,"I still love this series! It's a shame that it isn't on tv anymore but with these you'll find all those episodes you laughed along with! I watched them all back to back and I was surprised by how many episodes I missed! It's a great deal for a lot of cartoon viewing. Cartoon series on dvd are ideal for cartrips or sickdays and this one is entertaining, fun, and the animation is pretty good.

11/26/12 Edit: If you're a fan of Dexter's Laboratory, Powerpuff Girls, Edgar & Ellen, Total Drama and more recently Gravity Falls, you'll love this series.",1200355200,4,551,4.51

The only problem is that only two seasons are available on DVD.  There are six seasons of this show available on iTunes to purchase now.  Don't hold your breath waiting on Cartoon Network to release more DVDs.  Enjoy!",1314576000,,386,4.846153846153846

I guess it's actually supposed to be for kids, but I can't help laughing right along with my son at all the antics of the show's main character Bloo.  All the character's have their own quirks, and downfalls, but it's hilarious to watch them through every single episode.  It's a shame it's not on anymore, but we always have dvd!",1274659200,,399,4.513888888888889

It is cooler than Red Spider Lilies on toothpaste, not really, but a shrimp. Or a chicken leg with quite a historical background. Also tune into DS's FHFIF: 'Imagination Invaders'

Very fun for all ages (we actually purchased it for a ~30yr old :) )",1218153600,2,241,4.127659574468085
