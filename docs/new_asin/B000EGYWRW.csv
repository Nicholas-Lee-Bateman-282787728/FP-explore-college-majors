8221142,3,B000EGYWRW,"The Animated Hero Classics are great narratives, and the kids in my history class love the stories; however, the DVD quality is lousy. When reviewed at home using a DVD through the TV, the video looked good, but at school using a computer hooked up to our projector, the video appeared choppy with colored lines and boxes all the way through interfering with the quality of the presentation. This has been the case with both AHC DVD's I've purchased. Too bad because the stories are well presented and keep kid's interest. For this reason, I will not purchase another produced by this company.",1364515200,3,593,4.766990291262136
8221143,5,B000EGYWRW,"My kids love these dvds!  The whole series is wonderful. We use them to supplement their history curriculum.  They really enjoy giving themselves the little comprehension ""tests"" at the end.  I have also used them in the classroom and recommend the books to go with the dvd!",1210204800,4,274,4.787234042553192
