3729085,5,B001O5LVVW,"I am a preschool teacher and love this DVD set!  I first read the book to the children, then show them the DVD.  This helps the children that need the visual reinforcement.  They get so excited seeing the story that they are familiar with on the screen!  50 stories...most classics...great value.",1286064000,6,296,4.745098039215686
3729086,5,B001O5LVVW,"My four-year-old son just started reading, and when people ask me if I taught him, I say, ""No! The Scholastic DVDs did!"" (Much like the Leap Frog DVDs taught him his letters when he was 21 months old.) We went to the library and got the corresponding books with each DVD. He watches them over and over and OVER. He asks what words are, and then he learns them. And while most of these books he has memorized by now, he can read other books because of the skills he has learned. I would say age two is too young to be able to appreciate most of the stories. Put them away until age three or four and then try again.",1279756800,24,614,4.082644628099174
3729087,5,B001O5LVVW,"We love these stories on DVD.  My two yr old will watch as long as I will let her.  A great alternative to cartoons, real stories being read to her like I would.",1273708800,6,161,3.8484848484848486
3729088,2,B001O5LVVW,"Just that, He did not like it, He prefferes Cat in the Hat, Dora the explorer and little Einsteins, maybe a little young for this staff",1271635200,3,135,4.230769230769231
3729089,5,B001O5LVVW,"Why must children's videos scream at them?  Hyperkinetic television conditions kids to expect fireworks from all of their entertainment, so that even the creators of the good stuff (Little Einsteins, Team Umi Zoomi and even the later versions of Dora the Explorer) believe everything must be BIGGER to compete.  Scholastic classic stories provide a gentle, welcome respite from the usual kids' DVD.  These are perfect for wind down time before naps or bedtime, or for in the car.  The storylines are deceptively simple enough for preschoolers, but provide the substance and depth to condition children to appreciate literature over the flash and twaddle that constitutes junk food TV.",1268265600,45,684,5.305555555555555
3729090,2,B001O5LVVW,I was hoping this would give us hours of great videos for our toddler....but these are NOT like you would expect them. They seem very outdated and for the most part just show illustrations from the book while it is narrated. This has no ability to grasp the attention of a toddler for more then mere seconds...I wouldn't recommend to a friend and certainly not for this price point...they are just way too boring,1247097600,4,412,4.581081081081081
3729091,5,B001O5LVVW,"We love, love this collection!  It is chock full of stories every preschooler will love.  My childrens' favorites are in here, as well as some stories that are new to us.  Tight packaging is less bulky.  This collection-in-one has been long awaited in our family!",1238457600,5,263,4.777777777777778
3729092,5,B001O5LVVW,The DVD set came quickly and was in great condition.  I love Amazon!  I do wish there weren't so many repeated movies in these Scholastic sets.  I already had more than half the titles in other sets.,1378080000,,199,4.324324324324325
3729093,5,B001O5LVVW,"We don't watch a lot of tv, and I am picky about what my kids do watch.  But this is the sweetest compilation of classics.  My 2 year old loves them because we own or have checked out most of the stories, and my 5 year old loves the added bonus of being able to read along with many of them.

These are also great when you need to keep your kids occupied for a few minutes after a busy day, without getting them riled up.",1377648000,,421,3.872093023255814
3729094,5,B001O5LVVW,These are simply amazing! My one year old actually settles down to watch these (especially the knuffle bunny). I would strongly recommend these to the mother who needs a break without feeling guilty.,1377302400,,199,5.0606060606060606
3729095,4,B001O5LVVW,"My 2 & $ year old boys love Good Night Gorilla, and Corduroy.  The other 2 movies don't hold their attention very well, but might when they're older.",1376784000,,149,4.321428571428571
3729096,5,B001O5LVVW,My four year old loves these. She likes to take her books and follow along with the dvds. I plan on buying the other collections in the future for my one year old.,1376092800,,163,3.9696969696969697
3729097,5,B001O5LVVW,"We found this collection of stories to be very appropriate for Preschoolers.  They are short, which is helpful  with young children's attention spans.  The stories are familiar and well loved!  This is a big hit!",1366588800,,212,4.9714285714285715
3729098,5,B001O5LVVW,"Weston Woods, New Video, and Scholastic teamed up to create a truly wonderful DVD collection of stories old and fairly recent, all with excellent video/audio quality. I would very highly recommend this set to anyone who either remembers these stories themselves as well as those who wish to pass along classic Children's Stories to succeeding generations. Having the option to use read-along subtitles is also very useful, especially for young children just learning the language. Spanish language versions of a few of the stories is also appreciated.

My only concern was that one of the DVDs in the set, which was shrink-wrapped and packaged carefully for shipping, arrived with several scuffs and had a nearly two-inch crack all the way through the disc at its center, leaving that disc unplayable. This disc was firmly lodged in the DVD cover and was not loose during transit.. I have purchased separately a replacement disc, because we had a need for other discs in the set during the days it would take to ship the entire set back for replacement.

For a good price, this is a set of pure entertainment for children of all ages!",1362009600,,1134,4.870466321243524
3729099,5,B001O5LVVW,"We've only had time to watch a few videos, but my students have loved the ones we watched!  These are quality videos of famous children's books. A good value, too!",1360886400,,163,4.433333333333334
3729100,3,B001O5LVVW,"This is our toddlers least favorite of them all.  She likes some of the stories but others she gets bored.  It may be the age.  She is 2 1/2.  She is more into the video books that have added music and have songs made by Scholastic like ""Wheels on the bus.""",1357776000,,257,3.980392156862745
3729101,5,B001O5LVVW,"Anyone who works with children should purchase these collections, they are without a doubt a real treasure.  Each story is as different as the next, uniquely told with it's own style of annimation.  The stories leave you wanting more and more...you can't get enough......That is why I've bought so many.......they will genuinely keep you and your child's interest...",1357689600,,366,5.293103448275862
3729102,5,B001O5LVVW,This is a great set of books for kids to enjoy. They are super fun to watch and good entertainment,1357430400,,98,3.95
3729103,5,B001O5LVVW,"good little videos which the kids enjoy. THey are fun, easy to understand and the kids really enjoy the variety.",1357171200,,112,4.65
3729104,1,B001O5LVVW,"I was misled in ordering this collection because it contains duplicate titles from the 100 Classics set that I ordered. If there was a list of titles, I did not see it.  Now I want to return the 50 classics. Also,the fact that the stories are narrated animation needs to be stated in the product description. As a positive suggestion, the fact that some of the titles are on required reading lists for kindergarten could be advertised.",1312934400,8,435,4.64935064935065
3729105,4,B001O5LVVW,"There are so many stories in this little box!  It truly is a video library.  Some of the stories are animated.  Corduroy is a short film!  Children will recognize many of the selections as books they've read (which they find very exciting).  A few of the titles aren't that exciting, and require adult guidance to keep children focused, and learning.  Overall, this was a great investment!",1308960000,,389,4.818181818181818
3729106,5,B001O5LVVW,This is a great dvd for preschool kids and younger.  I ordered it for my neice for her 2nd birthday and she loves it.  What a great way to introduce classic children books.  Now she can watch them and then read them with her parents.  I plan on ordering a copy for my house just to have on hand because it's such a great dvd.,1306108800,,325,3.953846153846154
3729107,5,B001O5LVVW,"Reliably, Scholastic has done it again.  These are classic, timeless books set to video, non-violent, not scary, completely enriching.  The bonus stories are wonderful too.  My 3 yr old loves these, and I do too (there aren't a lot of young children's videos that parents actually want to watch as well).",1297900800,,304,4.921568627450981
3729108,5,B001O5LVVW,"Really like this set! Lots of cute classics and a great assortment of animation, storybook stories, song stories etc. My daughter also recognizes a lot of the stories because we also have the same books. Great value for the money! Glad we got this!",1296691200,,248,4.659090909090909
3729109,2,B001O5LVVW,"Some stories are good and others are not worth the money my wife and i spent in purchasing this. It is supposed to be something that catches the attention of children and in my opinion, it doesn't really measure up.",1296432000,,215,4.4
3729110,5,B001O5LVVW,There's lots of great stories to choose from.  I love the old favorites and the newer stories.  The children also like the live-action stories.,1294790400,,143,4.916666666666667
3729111,4,B001O5LVVW,I bought it for my nephew who thoroughly enjoyed all the stories.  My favorite was the DVD on bed night stories it did make him sleepy!!!!!,1290816000,,139,4.346153846153846
8329727,5,B001O5LVVW,Great gift for young children.,1436745600,,30,5.2
8329728,5,B001O5LVVW,"Beautiful - my daughter loves it.. so do I. There is one ""Dem Bones"" that is not really for kids - But it is only one. Otherwise, I think it's great!!!",1415404800,,151,3.903225806451613
8329729,5,B001O5LVVW,"These are such a great alternative to TV.  Both my three and six year old enjoy them.  They are books that they are both familiar with and they are read with a soft and gentle tone.  The pace is slow and I think they are very calming unlike many other shows geared to kids which can get them overly excited.  A few of them (like harold and the purple crayon) seem dated, but they kids don't seem to mind.  I am very happy with this set and may even buy a few more.",1406073600,,464,3.946236559139785
8329730,5,B001O5LVVW,great,1405209600,,5,5.0
8329731,4,B001O5LVVW,My grandchildren are enjoying some of the videos but a few are a little scary.,1404432000,,78,4.266666666666667
8329732,5,B001O5LVVW,"My daughter received this for Christmas when she was 4. I now have two daughters; they're 6 and 3. They both love watching these videos. The set includes some classic stories and some we didn't know.

The videos aren't flashy Disney-worthy cartoons. They stay true to the look of the original book. I also love how the words of the story appear on screen.",1386028800,,355,4.546875
8329733,4,B001O5LVVW,"My kids like some of these and not others, I think each child will be the same. These are not all great, some of them are even bad, but there are a lot and I promise that your kids 4 and under will like some of them. I will note that I paid 15 bucks for this set so it was way worth it. I would not pay over $30. So keep in mind the price.",1384992000,,339,3.473684210526316
8329734,5,B001O5LVVW,I bought this for a gift.  The boy I got it for loves it.  He plays it all the time when he is going somewhere in the car.,1382659200,,122,3.3214285714285716
8329735,5,B001O5LVVW,"This was a spur of the moment purchase because of the price.  I didn't really know what it was that I was buying, I really thought they were actual books.  But they are movies of books.  And my kids love them.  The voice on the movie is quite with soft music and lights.  The kids really do watch it before bed and it helps calm them down.  On busy nights when I don't have time to read a bedtime story I do think this is a good substitute.  This keeps my 3 year old entertained and on up to my 10 year old.  Would recommend!",1379894400,,525,3.933333333333333
8329736,5,B001O5LVVW,"I am a preschool special ed teacher and I love the Scholastic DVD series. Of course so do my students and what a great way for the children to take a short break and watch excellent literature like Cordoroy, The Little Red Hen and many other classics. I was thrilled to find this 6 DVD set on Amazon for an affordable price!",1379635200,,324,4.241935483870968
