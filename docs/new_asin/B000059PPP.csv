1409084,3,B000059PPP,"Here are two examples of what I like to call ""post-production creation""; i.e., shoot some intrinsically compelling footage and then subsequently ""make something of it"" in the editing suite and at the typewriter.  The earlier film here, Fata Morgana, dates from the early '70s and features a barely coherent narrative built around some hauntingly surreal images shot in the southern Sahara/northern Sahel region of Africa.  An off-camera narration tells of an Ancient American story of creation while we see images of desert ecology, eerie natural phenomena, and human dereliction.  Along the way, we're ""treated"" to an interesting myriad of both native and European personages and creatures.  The late appearance of an apparent husband & wife musical duo (and a quite bad one, at that!) is a most comical non sequitur in this piece of concocted ""alien reportage"". I have no idea what the opening sequence of repeated passenger jet landings represents other than perhaps a very far-fetched depiction of a supposed alien landing on this strange planet with its forbidding landscape -- work with me here, folks!  Considering that much of the footage in Fata Morgana is roughly shot (jerky pans, static handheld shots, etc.), the film in totality leaves one mostly earthbound emotionally.  The eerie images of desert mirages do linger in the mind, however.  This film is an obvious indulgence by its creator and possibly a peculiar treat for the more open-minded viewer.  Much like Herzog's very fine later masterpiece Fitzcarraldo, the story of its making may actually be more compelling to some.

The more technically accomplished film here, Lessons of Darkness, dates from the early '90s and is almost entirely comprised of incredible footage of the massive oil well calamity in Kuwait perpetrated by retreating Iraqi forces in the wake of Operation Desert Storm. Interestingly, it presents much the same otherworldly ""apocalyptic"" narrative as Fata Morgana; this one, however, is shorter, more compact, and is definitely more compelling from beginning to end.  The dramatic images are not only beautifully shot (steadicam and/or tripod must've been used and the aerial shots are nothing short of spectacular!), but are juxtaposed in such a way, and in concurrence with the fatuous narrative and a poignantly moving ""human"" element, as to make for a most lasting visceral impression.  This time, Herzog gets it right!",1233619200,6,2416,5.281984334203655
1409085,5,B000059PPP,"I first saw Fata Morgana (the ""bonus"" movie here) on a double bill with Even Dwarfs Started Small at Facets Multimedia.  They were both 16mm prints, and while I adored Dwarfs (and still do), I actually feel asleep during Fata Morgana.  Now, having watched it again, it is one of Herzog's strangest films and arguably one of the strangest films ever made.  Herzog shot a ton of footage in North Africa, brought it back to Germany, then added a strange narration reminiscent of the Mayan creation myths (with Popol Vul music and a touch of Leonard Cohen).  The film cannot be honestly described, only experienced.  The footage and terrain are absolutely fascinating to look at (even if there was no sound, it would still be fascating), and it's a testament to Herzog's genius that he made one of his most fascinating, surreal, and mystical films ever.

Lessons of Darkness is an astounding documentary, one of Herzog's best docs.  It consists of mostly helicopter shots of the awe inspiring (and environmentally disasterous) oil fires set by the fleeing Iraqi army after the first Gulf War.  Herzog wisely avoids the politics of the war and gets at something deeper with this film.  Set to Wagner music, the shots of the oil fires say more about the war and man than probably all the CNN reporting ever did.  The film runs a mere hour, but still manages to say more than films do today.

This is one of Anchor Bay's best DVD's.  You get two films for the price of one.  There's a great commentary on Fata Morgana, as well as absolutely fascinating production notes about Herzog and Fata itself.",1221955200,2,1592,4.703971119133574
1409086,4,B000059PPP,"Fata Morgana, the 1971 documentary-like film by German filmmaker extraordinaire Werner Herzog, filmed over several years in the late 1960s, is one of those rare DVDs that should be listened to with the commentary turned on. It is a visual feast of North African (mostly Saharan) imagery that is timeless. You simply could not tell that it was made over thirty-five years ago. The soundtrack to the film, including German classical music (Mozart and Handel), and rock music by Blind Faith and Leonard Cohen, also lends its timeless quality. The narration by three different German narrators (German film historian Lotte Eisner, Eugen Des Montagnes, and Wolfgang von Ungern-Sternberg) is solid, and Herzog goes on and on of Eisner's import to this project, himself, and film history, but the English speaker of the translation, James William Gledhill, has a voice that seems downright deific, which lends itself far more perfectly to this project, even though much of the text- in either language, is rather superfluous. Yes, the faux Biblical sounds of the Popul Vuh Mayan creation myth in the film's first part, Creation, is interesting, but the text Herzog wrote for the remaining two parts (Paradise and The Golden Age), along with quotes from a German poet Herzog names as Manfred Eigendorf, almost seems a satire of the first part's somber tone.... The film, it seems was pieced together during the shooting of several other Herzog projects concurrently- the fictive Even Dwarfs Started Small, and the documentaries The Land Of Silence And Darkness and The Flying Doctors Of East Africa, but these projects' rejected material only add to the beauty of this film, such as aerial scenes of a flamingo mating lake from afar that give one an eerie unearthly sense, one which Herzog crows about in his commentary. This unearthly feel is present right from the film's start of several airplanes landing on a desert runway, with their images getting successively blurrier as the heat from the ground rises, and increases the distorting waves that mar the images. That this film was influential in the -Quatsi films of Godfrey Reggio is an understatement. But, whereas Reggio is content to just toss images at you, Herzog has an ability that only American filmmaker Terrence Malick also has: to make a wholly self-contained vocabulary out of the juxtaposition of images and words, and one dependent upon an emotion-first thrust. Analysis can fail when brought to such endeavors. Herzog often does not understand even why his art is great. The best he does often is wholly unconscious and mesmeric. This is why his contempt for the Lowest Common Denominator pap of Hollywood is openly stated on the commentary.
  Perhaps the best illustration of this comes in a scene that, on the commentary, Herzog tells us followed a severe drought in Cameroon. It shows the jerkied carcasses of cattle, and Herzog describes the unbearable stench. Yet, the viewer can sense this all from the images, the blackness of the sun dried portions of animals, and the blanched bones. Yet, even in that commentary, Herzog focuses on the stench, not any deeper meaning. He is content to let you imbue and interpret what you will into and of his work, such as the almost erotically feminized shapes of sand dunes, which recalls a scene from Ingmar Bergman's Hour Of The Wolf, where Max Von Sydow, runs his hand over Ingrid Thulin's beautiful nude body's curves. But, the archetypal image in this film, which symbolizes much of Herzog's career, is of a mirage of a faraway car driving back and forth on the surface of what appears to be a lake. It is deep, hypnotic, illusive, elusive, supernatural, yet real, just as Herzog, the believer who came from a family of militant atheists, is. But, then, like everything else, it ends.",1221091200,3,3798,4.979527559055118
1409087,4,B000059PPP,"This dark documentary is disturbing in showing the depths of evil. I purchased the movie and from what I gather, Hertzog assembled it solely from CNN clips (from the credits at the end of the film), his original commentary, quotes from the Bible, and classical music.

Not easily awed, I was by the panorama of destruction of the oil fields and by the vastness of it, disgusted by the revelations of torture and murder by the Iraqi occupation through interviews with relatives of two victims, and struck by the beauty of the music Juxtaposed with it.

There are deep lessons to be learned from this movie.",1216944000,,605,4.69811320754717

1409089,5,B000059PPP,""" Fata morgana "" means mirage, a metaphore used by german filmmaker Werner Herzog to show us our decadent world as a phantasm, connecting in a very personal way with the pessimist and romantic philosophy of Schopenhauer and a mayan ancient myth that explain the world as a creation that has not been finished. "" Fata morgana "" is at the same time a disheartened and mesmerezing movie: during the two first parts of the film Herzog blends apocalyptic and ghostly images of Sahara desert ( animals skeletons burned by the sun; tumbledown airplanes in the middle of nowhere )with segments of the mayan myth of Creation ( the "" Pupul-Vuh"" ) narrated by prestigious cinema essayist Lotte Eissner. The third and last part, ironically entitled "" The golden age "", of this shatteredly lyrical movie introduces several sardonic and bizarre vignettes as that one of a west scientist dressed with a picturesque clothing to fit to the new environment holding a lizard, a creature older than man. The message is clear: man is shown by Herzog as an alien; as a grotesque creature that has broken the eerie order of nature in the name of cosmic boredom. In Herzog's words: "" Fata morgana"" is a ""science-fiction elegy about demented colonialism"" ( 1 )

"" Lessons of darkness "" is a haunting documentary shot in Kuwait where Herzog follows the traces of the disasters perpetrated during the Gulf war. ( 2 )

1409090,4,B000059PPP,"Werner Herzog has been possibly the most intrepid director I have ever known. He likes to drown in deep waters where the edge conditions are present to break the unthinkable limits.

And this a powerful statement. Fata Morgana is a true jiurney to the desert's sands and still more. He filmed too a very special document around a vulcano just hours before to make eruption in 1977.

So this is an important document; visual and existential.",1117497600,,440,4.776315789473684
1409091,5,B000059PPP,"No aspect of Lessons of Darkness can be praised too highly. What I'd like to know is, how can I find out the artists who performed the various musical works? Herzog has chosen the most sublime renditions of his sublime selection: Verdi's ""Recordare"" from the Requiem, and similarly the best of Strauss, Wagner and so on. I'd like to gt the same recordings. Any help? Thanks in advance: send to johnwood@umich.edu",1063324800,2,412,4.816901408450704
1409092,5,B000059PPP,"Fata Morgana is an absolute masterpiece. It's Werner Herzog's most unconventional film and the most bizzare film I've ever seen. It doesn't have a plot or story. Instead, we're presented with a brilliant collection of images, words and music woven together by a master filmmaker. Fata Morgana is not a documentary either. Most of the people in this film are directed and given lines to read. It has some of the most beautiful and haunting images ever commited to film. Herzog photographs actual mirages and we see cars and people floating around in the middle of the desert who aren't actually there but hundreds of miles away reflected due to the heated strata of air. All of the tracking shots were done with a camera mounted on top of a VW van that Werner Herzog drove himself. The use of music in this movie is amazing; from Leonard Cohen, Mozart, Blind Faith and the Third Ear Band. Imagine Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey taking place in the desert instead of outerspace. Fata Morgana is so hypnotic that it has the ability to make you feel as though your spirit has left your body. This film is a must see and is not recommended for conformists who've been forced fed a steady diet of Hollywood-commercial fast food movies. It will change the way you view films.

7934041,4,B000059PPP,Lessons of Darkness is a visually fascinating record of the aftermath of Saddam Hussein's failed invasion of Kuwait. Retreating Iraqi forces were ordered to blow up Kuwait's oil fields. Hundreds of well heads were destroyed and then lit on fire.

7934045,2,B000059PPP,"No rhyme or reason, no explanation why you see what you see. Never an indication where the film was shot (Cameroon), and why he went there with his crew.

Lotte Eisner's narration has nothing to do with the images. Her's a tired old woman's voice. What was his fascination with her? Why not find a younger, dynamic, more fascinating narrator? (Note, a few years later Werner Herzog walked from Munich to Paris, hoping the fact of his walk would help her recover from serious illness.)

In addition, ugly images of carcasses rotting in the sand. Ultra slow, never ending shots of empty expressionless faces, of objects and animals, without ever a message.",1391126400,,654,4.830357142857143

7934047,4,B000059PPP,"I've seen Fata Morgana four or five times--twice with the commentary turned on--and I'll return to it again in the future. For me it's like a piece of music that reveals more with each listening while retaining an enigmatic atmosphere. The film isn't demonstrative, it's not telling a story or making a point, but has a stream of very compelling images of vast and desolate landscapes that sometimes flow into each other, and sometimes are abruptly juxtaposed with images of lush tropic zones.  The sense of desolation is enhanced by shots of industrial detritus, abandoned construction, and animal carcasses.  It's all somehow tied together with a tripartite structure, Part I being ""The Creation"", Part II ""Paradise"", and Part III ""The Golden Age"".  Herzog says in his commentary that he wasn't trying to use the images to portray what is in the narration, rather he felt the narration provided a certain tone that interacted with the moods evoked by the images.

This doesn't seem like a film you watch as much as a film you dwell in for a while.  I don't think repeated viewing of it is useful to ""get"" the film, rather it's a way to re-experience the feelings produced by its mysterious imagery.  Maybe that means it's just a confused jumble of vague intentions, and in some ways you do start to question if it holds together at all; but I'll set that question aside until I've seen another half-a-dozen times. It may not even be that important an issue.

One of my favorite scenes is still the drum-and-piano duo that provides ""entertainment"" in The Golden Age: one of the strangest musical acts I've ever seen. And it provides a bit of comic relief after the intense mood that preceeds it.

One practical point: rather than pay $15-30 for this single disc, why not pay $31 to get the Herzog box set that includes it, and you'll get five more early Herzog films, each of which is worth watching as well.",1364083200,,1909,4.711711711711712
7934048,4,B000059PPP,"I always give Herzog benefit of the doubt, but Fata Morgana's narrative isn't worthy of the stunning images.  4 stars just for going into the heart of the Sahara desert in the hottest and rainiest season (and adding Crispin Glover's Q&A) but needed research on Saharan landscapes, people, & animals.  Update 7/19/12 Lessons of Darkness is more hypnotic with better music and less talk but only 54 minutes",1339372800,,404,4.926470588235294
7934049,4,B000059PPP,"I can only comment on ""Lessons Of Darkness"" as I have not seen ""Fata Morgana"".  The former is an utterly fascinating film, filled with unforgettable images of the horrors left behind by the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait.  Though frequently described as a documentary about the hundreds of oil well fires which were a portion of the devastation, that is only a portion of the film.  Nearly the first half is dedicated to elegant aerial footage of Kuwait City before the beginning of the 1991 Gulf War, followed by largely unnarrated sequences of destroyed buildings, vehicles, and military facilities.  The camera's unblinking eye strays into a torture chamber and across a table strewn with bloody torture instruments (this sequence alone makes this film most definitely adults-only territory), then wanders to the oil fields, pausing occasionally for a brief interview sequence.  One especially eloquent and almost unbearable example shows a woman whose sons were tortured to death, who has been unable to speak since.  She struggles to speak, all the while attempting to tell her story through hand gestures which break through and language barrier.

In classic Werner Herzog form, ""Lessons Of Darkness"" presents an unvarnished look at the utter horror of war as seen through what it leaves behind.  Smooth, elegant footage presents details that leave the viewer wanting to flinch despite their frequent beauty.  You will come away from this film haunted by a view of the Gulf War that most definitely did not make it onto television, enhanced almost to the point of agony by Herzog's classical score and minimalist narration.  Once seen, this film may never be forgotten.  And what it depicts should not be.  Here is war without glory, without purpose, without patriotism.  Here is mere pointless destruction, tragedy, and death, the underlying ingredients of any war in any age.  This, above all, we should remember.  So speaks Herzog.  And I agree.

A somewhat enigmatic and ambiguous ending is the only flaw I find in this shocking film.  But real life does not provide Hollywood endings, and the stained sands of Kuwait are most definitely not Hollywood.",1298678400,,2156,5.111428571428571
