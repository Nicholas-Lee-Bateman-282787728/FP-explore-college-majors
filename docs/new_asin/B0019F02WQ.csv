I found it really made me laugh and having grown up in New York in the 80s, triggered a lot of memories. I could relate to the humor and found the plot/story line/characters really entertaining.

Recently I visited LA and did a tour of Paramount Studios. We were in a group of 4 people and the guide. He took us on the soundstage (the set was of the apartment the family lives in, and it was amazing to walk through the rooms where they all ""lived"" and even get the chance to sit on the living room couch).

When we were done (being all sound stage struck) the guide told us that they were filming part of the last episode in series 4 in the other studio (the scene took place in the high school) and we were welcome to go and take a look.

We were welcomed with open arms. Ali Le Roi introduced us to the cast that was filming and we got to take pictures with and talk to all the talented wonderful people who were working that day. I have to say that the cast of this particular show are the most warm hearted and fun people I have met in a long time. Tyler James Williams (Chris) joined us and agreed to let us take a picture of us with him. That picture is of a young man with a winning smile and a whole lot of talent.

We spoke to the producer who let us listen to the takes on the head phones while they were taping, and he told us that what make this show so special is the amazing relationship the cast and crew share, and this was very apparent.

Since then I have bough series 1-3 and have enjoyed every minute. This series radiates the love and dedication that all these talented people put into every episode. I love this show, and can highly recommend it to anyone who wants to experience a series where the people who make it love what they do.

My hat is off to Chris Rock and Ali Le Roi for creating a show I will watch again and again, each time feeling like I have just experienced something great.

Thank you to the cast and crew who let us see what happens ""behind the scenes"". In my opinion, anyone who watches this show has a widow into what may seem like a normal sitcom, but in reality is a true labour of love which makes you laugh out loud again and again.",1227052800,,2288,4.1512415349887135
