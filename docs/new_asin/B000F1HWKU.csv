8116357,2,B000F1HWKU,"Living in North Carolina, I purchased this product expecting some insight on ""Successful Strategies"" approaching our small,tight,rhodo choked mountain streams.  Please note as an experienced angler I wasn't expecting secrets to be revealed, but what I received was a 101 version of flyfishing, period.  No advanced strategies to approach bluelines, nothing. I DO WANT TO MAKE A POINT that this is not a direct ""stab"" at the author or his wife. In fact, they are one of the foremost professional guiding services in all Southern Appalachia and their knowledge is seldom surpassed! I just feel this product targets only the fundamentals and nothing else. To the beginner, I give two thumbs up! For anyone else, I'm sorry, but it's not worth it.",1331424000,,742,5.073770491803279
8116358,3,B000F1HWKU,"Watching Ian and Charity fish the Great Smokey Mountains is more like fishing the streams here in Maine and New Hampshire. For that reason, I find their demonstrations more helpful than watching someone make beautiful backcasts on some Western river with big sky. The fishing in the Northeast is varied, but more often you are fishing over boulders and around brush.
The production quality of the video could use some polishing but the content is worth it.",1206489600,,456,4.935064935064935
