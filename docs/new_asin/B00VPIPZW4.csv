(I have not watched ""Doa Diabla"" but Mara Fliz is pretty much a guarantee that it will be well worth the money.)  Yes, it is true that the movies are in black and white and the quality of the picture is only adequate.  However, for someone like me who grew up watching these movies as a child and young adult, these ""detracting"" factors actually give the movies a certain degree of authenticity.",1515888000,,487,4.438202247191011
