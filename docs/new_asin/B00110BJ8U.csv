8239695,5,B00110BJ8U,"This DVD is supurb. It continues the series of Beatle songs. The instructor, Robb Taylor, follows the same format as the previous titles in the series. There is no written tab or standard music notation. Yes, I agree that you will repeatedly play the DVD over and over again to get the songs down. I will listen to small segments and pause the disc and practice. This can be tedious. However, the songs are played correctly the way the Beatles recorded them. I have played several pieces for various people and they think the arrangements are spot on. As Ringo said, ""you know it don't come easy"" but the time and effort is well worth it.",1375488000,,638,4.508620689655173

8239697,1,B00110BJ8U,"What a pity the creator of the DVD didn't put more thought into a better way to guide learners through the steps of each song (on this and other DVDs in the series).

For some inexplicable reason, he has chosen to dispense with the traditional (and easy to work with!) way of showing tab (i.e. numbers on measure lines) and gone for a quite ridiculous fretboard display option where dots flash before your eyes and are gone before the brain has a chance to work out what's going on.

He knows his stuff, for sure, but some songs taught on this DVD can take anyone below high intermediate DAYS to figure out, because of the need to stop/pause every second to figure out fretboard dots to LH/RH fingering relationship.

I found the only way to get through this lot was to stop/pause a song (over MANY hours) and write up the tab myself on paper. Good teaching material shouldn't require that, and in fact some of these songs can be got through on YouTube in a few minutes vs the many hours or days needed to figure out this crap on-screen tab 'system'.",1272067200,9,1050,4.430051813471502
8239698,5,B00110BJ8U,"If you've ever wanted to learn how to play Beatles songs, and have been confused by the many different chords/leads that appear in so many books, THIS is the DVD for you!

Rob has done EXTENSIVE research into the songs of the Beatles and has produced two prior DVDs (Vol. 1 and Vol. 2,which are BOTH Great) but Vol. 3 is just INCREDIBLE!

The chords and leads are shown in split screen AND split sound! Rob makes it easy to learn in this user friendly DVD.

This DVD is a MUST for any Beatles fan or musician who wishes to learn how to Play Beatles To-A-Tee!!",1201651200,6,559,4.254716981132075
