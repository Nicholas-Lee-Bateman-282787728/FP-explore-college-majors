7084346,1,B00VARC0B4,"No offense to the actors, or the director in this movie because I am sure they wanted to portray Jesus in a positive light. However, somethings when not given are best left alone! As a Christian, I am anxious for movies about Jesus like many of us who love him, but we are adding confusion more than truth in some of these movies this being one. It's best to stick mainly to what is given in the bible, and if there's not enough in the account of that part of his life, then it's meant to be a mystery...just as many things when it comes to Jesus. He is sacred, He's God's son, He's Divinity that lived in humanity, not humanity living in Divinity!",1484352000,4,648,4.233870967741935

7084351,4,B00VARC0B4,Good movie.  Low budget but a good movie nevertheless.,1477699200,,54,5.0
7084352,4,B00VARC0B4,"Well, it's not a big Hollywood -Mel GIbson-style production but it is very insightful, inspirational, and leaves a lot to meditate upon. Children will not understand it...but it is deep.",1476403200,2,186,5.233333333333333
7084353,3,B00VARC0B4,Straightforward approach. Would appeal to fundamentalist church groups.  John the babtist and Jesus looked too well fed.,1475971200,,120,6.0588235294117645
7084354,5,B00VARC0B4,"I was pleasantly surprised at the story of Jesus in the desert.  This whole movie was just Jesus and his temptations by the devil in the desert.  Something we really never could imagine and the ending really touched my heart,",1475280000,3,225,4.6
7084355,1,B00VARC0B4,"Sadly its a 1 star, i wish i could give more but i want to be fair on the rate system.",1474675200,,86,3.142857142857143
7084356,5,B00VARC0B4,I really enjoyed and agreed with the film's interpretation of what could have likely happened during Jesus's fast. The film really stuck to the Bible and used it as a main reference. I would highly recommend,1473811200,2,207,4.777777777777778
7084357,1,B00VARC0B4,"Terrible, terrible, terrible production. The story and dialogue are contrived. With beads around his neck, Jesus(?) looks more like a hippie than a teacher and preacher. John(?) wears a really nice fur coat from Saks Fifth Avenue Furs(?), and with a beer belly he does not look starved in the wilderness. Either pity the poor producers and actors, or have them hanged.... LOL...LOL....LOL....",1473206400,,392,5.238095238095238
7084358,1,B00VARC0B4,One start for the effort.  My family of four could barely last ten minutes.,1472688000,2,75,4.357142857142857
7084359,3,B00VARC0B4,fine,1469232000,,4,4.0
7084360,5,B00VARC0B4,So amazingly portrayed!!  A must see!!!  This will transform you and help you to see your life with more open eyes!  The cinematography was phenomenal and the dialogue was accurate and moving. The role of the Devils was done in such a creative way and it felt as though you were actually witnessing the real situation of Jesus being tempted by the devil!  Personally I never put a lot of thought into Jesus' forty days of fasting and I didn't think of how much he suffered and why he did so!  This really educated me and inspires me to love him more deeply!,1468713600,,557,4.368932038834951
7084361,5,B00VARC0B4,Excellent script about an unknown subject matter. When you try to imagine what was said in the historical situation it is difficult not to step on someones toes compared with their views of the subject. The dialogue maneuvered very comfortably through these deep waters. Even a stiff neck Christian would appreciate the clever way it was portrayed what Christ might have went through. It was very believable that it could happen that way. The accuracy with Scripture was very pleasing. This allowed me as a viewer to trust the script to take me in any direction. The story line inspires the viewer to think about what could have happened with an open mind. A truly beautiful film. The shooting location looked like right out of the holy land. The cinematography is first-class. The editing of the film was so smooth it was hardly even noticed. You certainly have a great crew working with you. I would give it five stars and encourage all believers to view it. Good job!,1464825600,3,970,4.745562130177515
7084362,5,B00VARC0B4,"Great quotes found in this film. It's a great way to start a trilogy and it hasn't been done before to my knowledge. Very thought- provoking and real, testing  faith and how easy it is to be persuaded. We need powerful movies like this for the new millennium. D.J Perry's performance was natural and heartfelt.  I enjoyed Taymor's performance as his nemesis. Great cinematography and truly a great feel good movie that will make you think, which is desperately needed in today's society of reality television.",1462924800,,509,4.906976744186046
7084363,5,B00VARC0B4,Good movie that protrays Jesus' 40 days and nights in the desert. The movie really shows Satan in a different way than other Jesus movie I have seen. Recommend this movie.,1462838400,,171,4.548387096774194
7084364,5,B00VARC0B4,"This was the last film that the iconic actor Dan Haggerty (aka Grizzly Adams) was in. He is heard at the beginning as ""the voice of God,"" which is interesting as he died not long after of January 15th. 2016. Dan was my dear friend and business partner for about 20 years, he was always good with exits, but wow! What a way to go - as the voice of God!

I enjoyed watching the film 40 Nights and I have to say that it was challenging and encouraging. The film uniquely tells the story of Jesus and the 40 Nights in the wilderness after he was baptized. Beautifully shot in the desert, Jesus is confronted by the enemy. Flashbacks take the viewer back into the life of Jesus and addresses real issues that we all face every day. The film stays true and doesnt try to reshape Biblical truth, it is a glimpse into the lives of those in time of Christ. It portrays the eternal messages in a powerful but simple setting that is enjoyable to watch. It is a film that will build your faith and inspire you as you apply it to your life. The ending is especially direct and challenging. Watch it, you will be glad you did.   Terry Bomar, Minister, speaker, (Former manager to Dan Grizzly Adams Haggerty  this was Dans last movie)",1461542400,2,1219,4.310043668122271

8709722,4,B00VARC0B4,I must admit i yelled at my laptop watching this. I felt bad for Jesus. The acting is good and the guys who play satan are despicable. It was a slow start but got better. I enjoyed it.,1496102400,,184,3.8684210526315788

8709724,4,B00VARC0B4,Very good movie.  Though some situations or circumstances were not expressed in the Bible they may have occurred and gives an insight to what Jesus may have gone through during those 40 days.  Very deep concept of life here on earth and hell man and women pursue glory and riches here on earth without a concern of life after death.,1491955200,,332,4.516666666666667
