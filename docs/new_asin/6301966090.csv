399768,3,6301966090,"Not only in ""Cleopatra"" but in her next two films as well, ""The V.I.P.s,"" and ""The Sandpiper,"" Taylor was more the world-famous celebrity and less the conscientious actress than at any other time in her career... The three movies exploit the public's fantasy of what the lovers must be like: tempestuous, as in ""Cleopatra;"" quarreling, on the verge of separation, as in ""The V.I.P.s;"" illicit lovers, defying the moral norms, as in ""The Sandpiper.""

As the ancient Queen of the Nile, as modern day grande dame, or as a hippie artist, Taylor is Taylor, hemmed in by her spectacular fame... The international celebrity, the world's most famous lover, takes over from the burgeoning actress of the Fifties, and Taylor walks through the movies as the fabled beauty she'd become rather than the high-strung Southern belle she had been before Rome...

Playing an unmarried woman who lives with her son exactly the way she wants to live, in harmony with the California coast, Liz Taylor, for once, gets to talk about ideas: her character proclaims the joys of independence and self-expression... Taylor is no Jane Fonda, alight with radical fervor, but the role does express something of herself; it lets us see a side of her that differs from the standard screen Taylor...

Here she's a 'new' woman, free and wise, who teaches a thing or two to a rigid churchman... The film's symbol is the sandpiper with a broken wing which she offers as proof that every creature should be allowed to fly free...

We know too much about her to believe her as a hedonistic artist who would dress so fashionably in such an impossibly expansive beach house... The character's broad humanistic philosophy--her objections to organized religion and to formal schooling, her advocacy of free love and her celebration of the naturalness of physical love--are, oddly enough, at the film's center...

The story that interrupts the characters ongoing declarations about life is the old number of a minister tempted by a beautiful woman... Bombarded by the artist's charms, the man succumbs, only to depart at the end, weighed down by, guilt and vowing to seek the way of repentance and purification...The movie's morality is thus a mingling of the old and the new...

The movie plays it both ways, admiring the woman's freedom and righteous self-justification, but making the clergyman pay dearly for his indulgence in forbidden fruit... It's an old Hollywood romance trying to masquerade as a love story in the modern manner...

Burton's prude is impossible and he plays him in a harsh oratorical manner, as if he's deadening himself to the pain of it all, but Taylor's character almost approaches being a real rebel with ideas... The movie exploits the public image of her as a challenger of conventions, but the role also gives her a chance to sound reasonably articulate about matters other than love... Under Vincente Minnelli's graceful guidance, Liz is sweet if not entirely convincing...",1168560000,4,2964,5.012195121951219
399769,3,6301966090,"This movie has remained with me long after seeing it for the first time.  I even found the soundtrack in a local Record store.

When I hear the great song Shadow of your smile I find myself sad that Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton's love didn't survive in this romantic movie. Then I stop to think and say ""wait a minute they had many more years of love at its best in real life, it did survive"".  Not the greatest script but a memorable experience to watch just the same.",1133395200,3,476,4.266666666666667
399770,2,6301966090,"The odd thing about Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor's weakest films is the feeling that their personal lives of high drama and turmoil were far more interesting than any scene concocted for them.

Burton looks torn and haunted with an intensity that rises above his role--and his role is a preacher having an affair, so you can't get much more dramatic than that!  Taylor is stunning and passionate, but she looks like she has to work way too hard to worth all the trouble.  Their personal lives sound so much more interesting and, after watching each scene in THE SANDPIPER, I kept wishing the camera wouldn't cut and just keep following them to wherever they went after their scenes.

Other reviews have pointed out the other faults: the over-the-top dialogue, older hippies living like millionaires, completely wasting Eva Marie Saint, etc.

The best reviews come from people who remember seeing the film when it opened, when they were young or living in the Big Sur area.  It's impossible to be a fair judge of film when you're young.  I knew a lady who grew up in on the beaches of Southern California and her favorite film is a terrible Elvis beach movie.  I don't think she loves it because it's good, she loves it because, like an old song, that bad movie just takes her back.  I can see where THE SANDPIPER does that with its beautiful scenery, nice musical soundtrack and Sixties atmosphere does that.

In a biography of Richard Burton, he was quoted as saying that he and Elizabeth were really George and Martha in WHO'S AFRAID OF VIRGINIA WOOLF?, easily their finest film.  He also earned Liz's wrath for that too--probably a lot like Martha as well!

The scenery is nice in THE SANDPIPER, but check out VIRGINIA WOOLF if you really want to see both of these actors at their best.",1128643200,7,1796,4.666666666666667
399771,3,6301966090,"The 1965 melodrama, ""The Sandpiper,"" stars Elizabeth Taylor as free-spirit/painter Laura.  Her son gets in trouble and is sent to a strict private school run by the Rev. Dr. Hewitt (Richard Burton) and his wife (Eva Marie Saint).  Laura dislikes all authority and flaunts her ""wicked ways,"" much to the consternation - and delight - of the good Reverend.  Their affair is a foregone conclusion, played out against the crashing Big Sur surf.

Burton is pretty good in his role, but is given such corny  dialogue that he must have been embarrassed.  Taylor overacts horribly, shrieking her lines, writhing with fake misery, and she does it all with a British accent, even though her character is from Indiana.  The middle-aged crowd she parties with aren't very convincing as ""beatniks,"" she wears way too much make-up, and sports silly caftans that were someone's idea of avant-garde fashion.  The little subplot of healing an injured bird is sweet, but actually becomes laughable when the bird nests in Taylor's hair during a supposedly torrid love scene.  Beautiful music and scenery; corny dialogue and mis-cast Taylor.

399772,3,6301966090,"Ah, Big Sur in 1965... the world's two biggest stars descend upon this gorgeous town in California to film this travesty of a movie. But wait... There are redeeming features to this campy, excessively poorly-acted soap opera. There is Elizabeth Taylor at the age of 33, looking more gorgeous than in any film except ""A Place in the Sun."" She is overweight (""zaftig,"" as she preferred to be called), barefoot and dressed in frumpy caftans throughout this film, but who cares? Liz is still breathtakingly beautiful here. Richard Burton also never looked better. At 39, his pockmarked, booze-soaked face seems fit, tan and marvelously sexy. He overacts miserably and shouts lines which should be whispered, but when you look as good as Burton did in 1965, few would complain.
The actual plot of the movie is interesting: Burton is a minister who meets Taylor, an artsy Bohemian painter who sells her work once every Leap Year. One wonders how this starving artist can afford a multi-million dollar pad perched on the shore of Big Sur? Burton mightily struggles with guilt and wants to remain loyal to long-suffering wife, Eva Marie Saint (who is totaly wasted in this role), but of course he eventually succumbs and embarks on a passionate affair with Liz.
Predictably, there are oodles of love scenes between Burton and Taylor; they kiss reclining on the floor, the beach, standing in restuarants and carparks, in bed... in the surf... you name it. All titilating to the audiences of 1965, who followed the couple's every movement. Charles Bronson shows up as a beatnick and gives the only sane performance in the film. The script is wretched and offers up some incredibly campy moments, such as when Liz shouts wearily, ""Men have been following me around since I was 11 years old!"" Another hilarious scene has Burton stumbling from Liz's beachside mansion after kissing her and then beating the roof of his car with his fists, screaming, ""I must not succumb to temptation!!""
The scenery around Highway 1 is spectacular, the ""Shadow of Your Smile"" remains a compelling soundtrack theme, but the real reason to enjoy this movie is to see Taylor and Burton in their only decent love story. Their chemistry is real and never forced and neither ever again was as beautiful as they were in this campy movie. Watch it and own it if you are memmerized by their debauchery and mutual beauty. Several scenes will have you in stiches, guaranteed!",1082332800,47,2434,4.881642512077295
399773,2,6301966090,"Like the previous reviewer, this film has haunted me since first seeing it at a Sacramento drive-in during the late 60's.  But, not for the same reasons.  The movie itself is interesting, but barely so.  What is  exceptional is the opening titles.  A beautifully crafted montage showing  the Monterey and Big Sur coastline while 's lush, haunting arrangements of  ""The Shadow of Your Smile"" played in the background.  WOW!

The theme song is perfect for this movie and I think of Big Sur and this film whenever I hear it. So glad that it was here to rent, I feel I'll have to buy it as well.

SPOILER:

Having her son kill a deer to find out if it's pleasurable is a bad beginning. I hated that part. would a mom communing with nature actually give her kid a gun to hunt with? That seemed really weird. Then there is the unlikely casting of Liz Taylor as a hippie artist, complete with her usual colorful eye makeup and clingy designer sweaters. She did not look like the kind of person who would be living on a beach, painting and hanging out with beach bums, it just didn't fit.

I did like Richard Burton's portrayal of the minister caught in the throes of duty and loving his wife and his lust for Liz at the same time. But the dialogue was soooooo cheesy at times, even for the time period it was set in.

I'm not sorry I watched this film, it even has it's moments of LOL, due to the dialogue at times between Liz and Dick, but it's not one of their best, that's for sure.",1417824000,,1152,4.270642201834862

She (Liz) is a painter and a free spirit who does not send her son to school but teaches him at home.  This is long before the now-accepted home schooling came to be.  Her son is ordered to go to the school by the local authorities when he gets into trouble.  The two start an affair but it comes to an end when a ""friend"" of the pastor intentionally lets is slip in front of the wife that the pastor was not in San Francisco when he was supposed to be.  The affair ends and the pastor leaves the area.  What happens to his marriage is left up in the air.  I felt that Richard Burton's acting was incredible but that Liz over acted in some scenes.

Her brilliant acting was too often overlooked, and I think that is very sad. Some of her monologues in this movie are so telling that one could almost see into the depths of her soul. One reviewer mentioned ""philosophy"" in describing her acting in this role, and I must agree. There was something lonely in her, I think, and all the accolades in the world could never erase that inner pain. I believe it showed throughout her life, but she did not intentionally reveal it, nor did she intentionally hide it. Rather, she allowed it, which, for me, made her all the more genuine. Despite anything bad ever said about her, I do believe the good in her (and the good that she did) outshone anything else. Sometimes, it was if she were cursed with beauty, because some individuals (and the public in general) seemed never to see beyond her remarkable face -- especially during her prime. Don't deny yourself this movie -- take time to see Elizabeth, really see her; and watch her movements, the castaway glances; enjoy more than just her looks. Sometimes, one has to look away from the image on the screen to relish the nuances of her voice and what she is really saying. Watching this movie twice has its advantages.

400102,5,6301966090,"Rare is the movie whose opening frames and notes from the musical scoring can very quickly draw you into a lush romance from l964.
""The Sandpiper"" does just that.
You're instantly entranced with the gorgeous waves and water at Big Sur, filmed in slow motion. Johnny Mandel's Oscar winning song, ""The Shadow of Your Smile"" is played by a solo trumpet and this strongly enhances the whole ambiance of ""The Sandpiper.""
We then behold a cast of truly bigger-than-life movie stars who were already being pushed aside because of the changing tastes of the public. And most importantly, we have one of movie's true legendary directors, Vincente Minelli, saturating this love story with old-time glamour and gloss.
From the stunning wardrobe of Elizabeth Taylor by Irene Sharaff-who also won an Oscar for her wardrobe designs for ""Cleopatra""--to the unforgettable ""beach cottage"" of La Liz to the beautiful photography and supporting cast, this bears all the earmarks of MGM doing what it did best--but not for long. It was on the verge of closing its doors and having that horrendous auction where everything from Tarzan's G-string to Dorothy's Red Shoes were sold.
Elizabeth Taylor was at the peak of her phenomenal beauty and career. Never again would she be so lush and staggering until the l973 cult classic ""Ash Wednesday"", where her beauty was so surreal that even her worst critics--all male--had to admit she was a once-in-a-lifetime miracle of womanhood.
Dame Taylor plays Laura, a free spirited artist who begins an ill-fated romance with a priest, Richard Burton. Taylor plays her role with gusto and complete conviction whereas Burton hambones his role with theatrical flourishes--as if he's on stage and performing for Shakespeare lovers.
This movie reflects the changing times. Hippies were now coming forth. Sexual traditions were being turned upside down. Elizabeth Taylor was personally repulsed by sexual hyprocrisy. She lived openly with Richard Burton before they became married--a terrible taboo for any movie star at that time.
In this movie, we see the fabulous Liz at the peak of her lush beauty and charisma. Even if you ridicule the movie you have to admit this is a very attractive way of seeing a capsule report of a fascinating time in American history and dramatized by a bigger-than-life movie star: Elizabeth Taylor.",1369699200,,2341,5.114882506527415

Krasner's expert cinematography. She was at the height of her notoriety as a Hollywood star enflamed by the media for her highly publicized affair with and marriage to Richard Burton, who looks understandably embarrassed as her smitten co-star, probably the least of their big-screen couplings back in the 1960's. Consider that&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Who-s-Afraid-of-Virginia-Woolf/dp/B000I2JDEY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?</a>&nbsp;was their next film. Taylor is hilariously miscast as beatnik artist Laura Reynolds, a free-spirited unwed, single mother to ten-year-old Danny. They live a solitary life in a striking,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Architectural-Digest/dp/B001U5SPHO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Architectural Digest</a>-style home overlooking the rugged Pacific coast. How she can afford such prime real estate on just her paintings is one of many suspensions of belief the movie asks of the undemanding viewer.

The threadbare plot, written by four screenwriters including the legendary Dalton Trumbo, has Danny being sent to a local Episcopal boarding school for killing a deer out of curiosity. The pompous headmaster is Dr. Edward Hewitt, who feels constantly cheapened by his glad-handing efforts to raise funds to maintain the school and build a new chapel. His repressed wife Claire teaches there, and in no time, Danny starts to enjoy school and the company of the other students. Meanwhile, Laura is initially resentful of Hewitt's academic approach, but of course, given this is Taylor and Burton in their prime, they fall quickly into a torrid love affair. Of course, Hewitt grows guilty for his uncontrollable passion and confesses to his wife. This leads to a rather absurd but inevitable conclusion. The film's director is surprisingly Vincente Minnelli who can't seem to do anything intelligent with the limp script handed to him and lets his two stars flail excessively onscreen. With her zaftig figure and designer outfits, Taylor simply looks disengaged, while Burton tries to inject some dignity to a basically unsympathetic character but to no avail.

Poor Eva Marie Saint is left stranded by the script's short-sighted treatment of Claire through her character's frigidity and willing ignorance. Charles Bronson has a few silly scenes as a sarcastic bohemian sculptor, while Robert Webber has his standard role of a wealthy cad lusting after Laura. Morgan Mason plays Danny insipidly, though interestingly enough, he would grow up to become Reagan's Chief of Protocol and marry Belinda Carlisle of the Go-Go's. Much of the dialogue is painfully bad with a lot of counter-culture talk that sounds hopelessly pretentious out of Taylor's mouth, yet for all its flaws, the film is utterly watchable as a trash wallow. The familiar Johnny Mandel song, ""The Shadow of Your Smile"", comes from this movie and plays over the opening and end credits. The 2006 DVD contains two vintage featurettes: ""The Big Sur"", narrated by Burton, about the challenges of filming in the area, and ""A Statue for The Sandpiper"", featuring the artist who carved the redwood statue of the bodacious Taylor, used in the film. Those viewers familiar with the area will likely recognize Point Lobos, Bixby Creek Bridge, and a sound-stage replica of the Nepenthe Restaurant.",1337126400,3,3567,5.753787878787879

anything in the script that may have been lacking.

Both actors looked spectacular and I was surprised to see how fit and striking Burton looked DESPITE his alleged notorious drinking binges.  One could clearly see why Taylor was acclaimed for her exotic beauty because it really came through in this film.  One scene in particular had her looking very tan and void of makeup and she looked absolutely amazing.

I kept imagining what they must have looked like together spending time at their villa in Puerta Vallerta;  Relaxed, bronzed from the sun and basking in their love for one another...  I have seen photos of them together there which were taken years ago and they did indeed look extraordinary.

The fluctuations in Taylor's weight throughout the movie were very obvious to me.  In one scene in particular she had her midriff showing and she looked pretty trim whereas in other scenes she looked like she had put on some  weight.  They lived well and I'm sure it was difficult for her to maintain her body weight.

Sidebar:  Most indoor scenes of this movie were filmed in Paris, France.  For tax reasons, at that time,  the Burtons could only work for no more than 4 weeks in the USA;  Therefore,  those 4 weeks were spent filming the Big Sur outdoor scenes while the the indoor scenes were actually filmed in Paris.

Robert Webber is best here, turning in his usual reliable callous cad part. The beatniks are laughable. They  might have taught Taylor how to hold a paintbrush to at least hint at some authenticity. I have never been a fan of her touted beauty, but think she looks best here, even  with the extra weight.

400164,3,6301966090,"Once you get past the uneasy casting of Richard Burton as an Episcopalian minister, and Elizabeth Taylor playing a free-spirited hippie artist, it's quite easy to enjoy THE SANDPIPER (1965) for it's fresh adult love story, but more so for the beautiful location photography, mostly captured at Big Sur itself.

Single mother Laura Reynolds (Elizabeth Taylor) lives in a ramshackle house perched on the Big Sur coastline.  She has raised her son (Morgan Mason) as naturally as possible, so when he is expelled from public school and forced to enroll at the San Simeon boarding school, Laura--who rails against organised religion in any form--is horrified.

The school's headmaster, Dr. Edward Hewitt (Burton), is fascinated by Laura's views and asks her to provide some artwork to use for a stained-glass window in the chapel he plans to have built.  Soon, Edward finds himself falling in love, despite being already married to Claire (Eva Marie Saint in a thankless role); and at last, Laura discovers the mutual passion that can be shared by a man and a woman, yet, like the injured sandpiper bird she has rescued, Laura realises that true love is ultimately learning how to fly free...

The love story itself is quite predictable and moralistic even for 1965 (a man of the cloth compromising his vows for an affair with an athiest; shades of ""Sadie Thompson""), but THE SANDPIPER is one of the better titles from the lengthy Taylor/Burton screen partnership.  Director Vincente Minnelli, who had previously guided Ms Taylor through one of her first big ""adult"" roles in 1950's ""Father of the Bride"" (and it's sequel ""Father's Little Dividend"" the following year), keeps everything as tasteful as possible.  This was his third-last film.

Taylor comes off more successfully than Burton, who seems to sink under some particularly awkward dialogue and a rigid, sometimes unsympathetic character.  The cast also includes Charles Bronson as a sculptor (the actual redwood statue of Elizabeth Taylor in the film was provided by Edmund Kara).  Jazz composer Johnny Mandel supplies the Academy Award-nominated score, highlighted by ""The Shadow of Your Smile"".

It espouses the then radical ideas of personal freedom, women's rights, new ways of seeking spirituality and sexuality. In other words, if viewed in the historical context of when it was made it is much better than it seams. Sure Burton walks through his part, Eva Marie Saint's talents are wasted, and Bronson is not much more than eye candy.  But in Taylor's performance you see her commitment to her role as a free spirited artist. A character she herself could relate to since she herself was a sexual rebel, and an independent woman in a time when that was rare.
Someone who had and would continue to show she was not afraid to stand her ground against popular moral opinion. ""to know myself, be myself"" as Laura says and both Laura and Taylor achieve that goal in the end.  In many ways Laura is very like Miss Taylor or so it seems and this character must spoken to her in some deeper way.  Her Laura also spoke to many of us just coming of age in 1965 in ways that were eye opening. On this level the film as a social historical significance. The biggest star in Hollywood was promoting a new way of thinking and living and the kids were listening. A movement was being born. You might even say Miss Taylor was the mother of the sexual revolution.
  On an entertainment level it is pure Hollywood soap opera set amid incredible settings. It's all silly romantic fun that by the end is actually touching.  Beautifully photographed and with a lush jazz score by Johnny Mandel it is a visual and auditory feast.",1231804800,47,1613,4.450847457627119

Taylor is supposed to be a painter living in a ""shack"" overlooking the beach at Big Sur. It's hard to know exactly when real estate prices skyrocketed there, but that ""shack"" would cost millions today. Taylor has an awfully big wardrobe and an awfully comfy lifestyle for an artist who does not appear to sell many paintings. Her makeup is garish. Her costumes are in hideous, lurid colors so obviously designed to de-emphasize her heaviness that they inadvertently draw attention to it. (Not that it's necessarily a bad thing to have a romantic lead NOT be a size 4.)  Her line readings mostly are forced and unconvincing, making us long for the freshness and enthusiasm she brought to National Velvet, the casual grace of A Place in the Sun, or the fire of Cat on a Hot Tin Roof.

Burton, so brilliant in films like 1984, has his knickers in a twist here. His notorious charm is entirely absent. His big speech from his pulpit at the end, obviously meant to elicit tears--Julie Andrews' autobiography said he could in fact make audiences cry at will--falls flat.

Fascinating Eva Marie Saint (see North by Northwest) has little to do but act saintly and suffer with dignity.

The campy fun comes from the dialogue, which is purple enough to give Taylor's costumes a run for their money and swings from trite to goofy, the actors' obvious struggle to find anything convincing to do with the dialogue, and the fact that every cliche about ""the bohemian lifestyle"" and the reaction of ""straight society"" to it is on display here. An authoritarian judge sends Taylor's son to Burton's school without bothering to examine whether he's learning under her home tutoring, but then Saint discovers that Taylor has taught the child to read Chaucer in middle English--ah, the mindlessly oppressive establishment. The ""bohemians"" romp around a campfire and Charles Bronson, ridiculous as a temperamental sculptor, uses Taylor as a nude (are we shocked? shocked!) model for a driftwood sculpture that looks like one of those things you stick on the prow of a ship--ah, the joy and creativity of the free spirits. Burton veins pop as he struggles between ""morality"" and ""desire""--ah, the establishment figure yearning to break free from his shackles. The adulterers plot and execute rendezvous in various glamorous locations--ah, the romance of it all. Does anyone ever wonder: wouldn't all that sand in your swimsuit make it pretty darned miserable to make love in the crashing waves on the beach?

The other plus is the theme song, which has become a classic standard, and it's still a great song. Pity we don't her more of it in the film. Burton gives the best performance, but we want him to lose control at times, to give the film a kick. But if you're in an indulgent frame of mind, it's enjoyable enough.",1510358400,,778,4.5177304964539005

Aside from the star-duo, the plot of a religious man who strayed, learned something, and had to deal with it was pretty good.  The California Big Sur scenery is awesome, and still timely.  Look for Charles Bronson in his worst role ever!  LOL.",1500508800,,338,4.491803278688525
