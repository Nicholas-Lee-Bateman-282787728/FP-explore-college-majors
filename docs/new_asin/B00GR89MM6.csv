6104405,5,B00GR89MM6,"Sean Connery is the absolute best Bond! Out of all the Connery Bond films, From Russia With Love is the absolute best!! A heavy dose of serious spy stuff, only slightly cliche in all the right places. Has one of the absolute best fight scenes ever put to film; on a train, with a very formidable Robert Shaw (remember Quint from Jaws?). I can watch this one endlessly, and do!",1468368000,,376,4.385714285714286

6104408,5,B00GR89MM6,"I have seen many of the more recent 10 or 12 Bond films many times in my lifetime, but I haven't seen some of the earlier Sean Connery ones nearly as much. So I decided to make it a point to go back and review all of the Bond movies in chronological order.

After just now watching From Russia With Love, I can honestly say that this really captured the classic Bond feel. This was the debut of ""Q"" and his wonderful gadgets that help bring a sense of uniqueness to the franchise. The real standout performance here though is from Robert Shaw. He does a fantastic job and is to this day one of my all-time favorite Bond villains.

It's easy to see why they were able to make so many Bond films since this, and Dr. No really helped to set the picture for what was yet to come.

Pour yourself a martini and kick back and enjoy the movie that some consider to be the best 007 film of all time.

6104410,5,B00GR89MM6,"From Russia With Love, 1964 film

It begins in a garden. A man is stalking James Bond. He uses a garrote and is timed. Then a mask is removed! The credits are superimposed on a dancer. Next its Venice for a chess championship. Spectators watch a game; white wins. SPECTRE wants to steal a Lektor coding machine. Kronstein has a fool-proof plan to trap James Bond. That killer lies on a lawn in the sun and gets a massage; he gets his orders. Tatiana Romanova [the family name of the Tsars] reports to Colonel Khleb [Bread] for her important assignment. Bond receives a summons from work. He must go to Istanbul to meet Tatiana and get that machine. He is issued a trick attache case. He arrives and passwords verify his drive. Then he inspects the paintings in his hotel room

There is a ruse to cause conflict. Bond is shown a periscope that can look into the Soviet Embassy. Krylenko is in town, he is a killer. A young woman performs a belly dance. A guard isn't vigilant and pays for it. Two girls will fight over a man. [Where is Jerry Stinger?] There is a sudden attack by men with pistols! They are repulsed, both sides take casualties. They will go after Krylenko next. Bond has an AR-5 survival rifle which fits into a compact case. Back at his hotel room Bond finds a present. Tanya greets him. A two-way mirror allows photography. The next day Bond visits Hagia Sofia as a tourist. He sees another man. Who did it? It all seems too easy. Bond boards a ferry boat in Istanbul harbor and meets Tanya. She describes the machine. How many keys? HQ accepts the description, it is genuine, the mission will proceed.

There is a big noise for a distraction, Bond enters the code room to retrieve the Lektor and escape with Tanya. They rush to a train, but a man recognizes Tanya! They are on their way to England. [An airplane ride would eliminate any threat.] Something happens on the train. Karim Bey had many friends. Bond questions Tanya. The train arrives at Belgrade. Bond meets a contact and asks for help. Next stop Zagreb. Will Bond meet the right contact? Mr. Nash arrives late. Did he order the right wine with fish? Nash directs Bonds view to a map. There is a surprise. Nash talks to Bond about his exploits and explains the plot (he has an anger management problem). Will he take gold coins for cigarette? There is a fight. Will Nash get the point?

There is an unscheduled stop to let two passengers out. A small helicopter attacks a truck. Can that AR-5 save Bond? [It takes a good guy with a gun to stop bad guys with a helicopter.] They board a motorboat and head to Venice. Back at SPECTRE there is a penalty for failure - a very early retirement. [Why blame the planner rather than the operator?] There is a motor boat chase for action. A flare gun sets a gasoline drum afire. [Believable?] The pursuers break off their chase. There is an incident in a hotel room, a cleaning lady makes a mess. Bond and Tanya ride in a boat in Venice. Mission accomplished!

After fifty years it is still a good movie (as long as you don't question some of the events). Note the mixture of action and humor. The Bond stories are similar to the old private detective stories but with more action and a bigger budget. [The Charlie Chan movies often used foreign locales for its stories.] Ian Fleming was more than an author of adventure novels; read his biography. Bonds physique is like that of an office worker rather than modern action heroes.",1430870400,,3452,4.481717011128776
6104411,5,B00GR89MM6,"James Bond returned in FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE and it has always been considered to be one of the better Bond films in the series. It follows the directorial style of DR. NO but embellishes it with layer upon layer of style, mood and a richly woven texture unique to the cinematic world of 007.

Sean Connery continues his portrayal of the character in the Fleming literary mold but simultaneously continues to refine his performance adding more depth to the character's worldliness, intellect, social graces and wry humor.

The plot also offers a more substantial challenge to Bond and poses a dichotomy of villainy represented by the unwitting Soviets and the independent criminal organization known as S.P.E.C.T.R.E. headed by Blofeld (named in the end credits). Interestingly, John Barry began his ""official"" scoring duties in tandem with his screen credit on FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE bringing a highly recognizable and definitive substantiating sound to the Bond series that distinguished it with his unique and inimitable musical style. That has been a hallmark, which brings a cohesive quality to the whole series.

FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE is exceptional filmmaking. When compared to other films in the series it stands alone bringing in very few, if any, elements of the fantastic allowing Bond to rely on his own wit and skill for survival to overcome the opposition.

Over the years FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE seems to have been forgotten and gotten lost from the cinema conscious minds of the movie going public and even some Bond fans. I think with the advent 2006's CASINO ROYALE there has be a resurgence to look back at the style of filmmaking found in FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE. James Bond is that dedicated civil servant who can handle himself in any situation. From a realistic standpoint, I think we can find that in FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE and in some ways Sean Connery's performance here as James Bond is the definitive performance of the entire series.",1420848000,6,1956,4.9361702127659575
8626331,4,B00GR89MM6,"The tremendous success of Dr. No instantly demanded a follow-up leading to Sean Connery returning as James Bond in From Russia with Love a year later.  The film, based on another Ian Fleming novel of the same name, continued to create elements that would define Bond film franchise for the next 50 years.

The criminal organization SPECTRE begins the film looking to get its hand on a Soviet cryptographic device, the Lektor, as well as get revenge on James Bond for his actions in Dr. No.  Using the plan created by Number Five with personnel selected by Number Three, Bond is lured to Istanbul with full knowledge that hes being set up.  Followed by both Bulgarian and SPECTRE agents, Bond meets station chief Ali Kerim Bey before heading to his hotel.  Afterwards, the SPECTRE agent Donald Grant kills one of the Bulgarians beginning a blood feud between the British and Soviet agents that Bond and Bey have to deal with before meeting with Tatiana Romanova.  With Grant providing unknown aid, Bond and Romanova are able to plan and steal the Lektor then aided by Bey they board the Orient Express in an escape planned by Bey.  Grant though kills Bey and a Soviet agent then a British agent in Belgrade taking his identity so as to kill Bond and take the Lektor.  However, Bond is able to kill Grant then use the SPECTRE agents own escape plan to get Romanova and the Lektor to Venice only to face Number Three in one last fight to secure both the Lektor and the girl.

Though quickly written and filmed, the plot of From Russia with Love is actually better than its precursor.  Though filled with more action than Dr. No, the story is tight and avoids any serious plot holes allowing Connery to expand his characterization of Bond.  The film also showcases one of Bonds most dangerous antagonists in Donald Grant that is played by the excellent cast Robert Shaw, who is probably best known as Quint in Jaws.  As stated above, the film added more motifs to the franchise: a pre-title sequence, the Blofeld character (referred to as Number One, a secret-weapon gadget for Bond, a postscript action scene after the main climax, and a theme song with lyrics (though this films is at the end instead of the beginning like those going forward).

Given the quick time turnaround from the success of Dr. No to when From Russia with Love was released, it is surprising about how good the film is.  Though its not perfect, its a tighter yet action-packed film that continued the slow build-up of the emerging James Bond film franchise.  Whether or not you enjoyed Dr. No, From Russia with Love is a better all-around film.",1511136000,2,2616,4.668845315904139

8626334,3,B00GR89MM6,"Like many second efforts, sequels, ""nexts,"" sophomore productions, etc., this is a weak sister in the Bond franchise.  Not a lot here to quite get the motor revving.  The underground tour of Turkey was nice and educational and we learned how to pronounce Karim Bey.  There is not a lot here that is memorable.

If they had had to hang their hat on this movie to continue the franchise to get to ""Goldfinger,"" I would say that they were fortunate to do so.

The title attracts a lot of attention and offshoots and wordplay(s) on the title even now decades later, but beyond that there's not a lot of substance.",1503100800,,609,4.5
