Another actor in the role might've been boring. Needed better writing overall and a smarter plot but it still entertained me and for some reason, regardless of me pointing out its flaws, I just kind of like it. And Fran Kranz is in it<3",1465862400,,397,4.527777777777778

Great film if you're aiming for mass suicide. Maybe something that should be considered for population control. You know, handing out cyanide capsules with every rental? But then you have to ask yourself what kind of moronic banal cretins would be generated from those that suffered to the end and didn't take the pill.

Thank God for fast-forward.

Basically a student film that would've gotten an 'A' for effort and an 'F' for everything else. Unfortunately, effort counts for crap in movies. Either you deliver the goods or you failed.

Failed.

The title perfectly fits my thoughts on how Colin Hanks and Tony Shalhoub were talked into this travesty.",1301788800,2,741,5.090909090909091
