3503416,1,B001C0L7TK,"I try to appreciate independent movies, because they usually have perspective that you don't get through mainstream cinema.

The plot of this independent movie, shot on one location with digital video, makes little sense.  An abusive husband, an abused wife, a psycho sister, a confusing plot revolving around revenge.  Mix them all together and you get a muddled mess.

Save your money and avoid this one.",1226793600,10,406,5.106060606060606

8285485,2,B001C0L7TK,"This movie is a bit bizarre. The acting is melodramatic, I mean Soap Opera.",1405900800,,75,4.428571428571429
8285486,2,B001C0L7TK,"Never liked people who deceive -and murder - each other on the flimsiest of reasons. Here it`s done by salt. If I belive it ? Naaawwww. So to spice it up the produsers have added a little lesbianism to it. Not much - because one of the participants do not want this ""she just want LOVE"". A dreary film that might appeal to some - not much to me.",1381536000,2,345,4.0144927536231885
8285487,5,B001C0L7TK,"this was a very cool little indie movie... the acting is really great, and the husband is really creepy. the actresses are cool, too. just have fun with this one.",1336176000,2,162,4.433333333333334
8285488,5,B001C0L7TK,"This movie has an intriguing premise.  If you despised someone such as your husband, your brother, or your lover so much, could you try to ""salt"" him to death?

  Within the confines of an artists own home, his wife and sister conspire to murder him.  At the same time, the two women express their true feelings for one another.  It's a recipe for an exceptional, twisted drama with all the necessary ingredients and pinch of salt.

  Writer, director and star Bradford Tatum has created a simple and effective independent film about desire, sex, and revenge that is truly thought-provoking.  Alexandra Wilson plays the disturbed wife well.  Stacy Haiduk as the sister is mesmerizing.  The scenes with her are the most intense.",1335916800,5,727,4.917355371900826
8285489,1,B001C0L7TK,"This movie most certainly wasn't what I expected.  Poor acting and ""NO"" plot or let's say a very weak plot.  Probably one of the worse DVD movies I have bought on Amazon.  I don't recommend buying this movie; its weak.",1325894400,4,218,4.4
