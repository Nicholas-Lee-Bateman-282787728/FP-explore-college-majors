1648191,1,B00005QBY8,"These DVD's are nice and ""The Honeymooners"" is also great for I do have the all 39 episodoes DVD but for what little amount of the ""The Honeymooners Lost Episodoes"" that each DVD has on them, there is no reason why they can't have them all in one DVD, and for a smaller price too which I might add. Look at the regular episodoes DVD (All 39 episodoes) the price is fair and it has 39 episodoes on it. Now could they not had done the same to the lost episodoes? Thank about it!!! REPLY TO THAT COMMENT: I'm not  cheap like that person say I am that posted the comment of my feedback, Now look what he did, he posted the feedback 4 times. Just goes to show that this person must not have anything better to do other then posting stupit things on the internet. GET A LIFE CHILD!!!",1093305600,31,777,4.145695364238411
1648192,5,B00005QBY8,"Really love this one.  I particularly like the extras that these boxed sets have, such as the occasional ""out of character"" skits that have been included that were originally part of the old gleason show (Reginald Van Gleason is hillarious).  As for the quality, it is exactly the same as when you watch it on TV.  Contrary to the generation X & Y folks who expect nothing less than digital clarity beyond what the human eye can process; these shows are in the same quality as they were recorded and as they aired.  This coupled with the black & white format makes for classic memories!  Buy all 3 boxed sets.  For any fan, it is worth OWNING these, instead of waiting for them to come on tv.",1087430400,,692,4.409448818897638
1648193,1,B00005QBY8,"I hate to give anything Honeymooners related a one star review but ALL of the Lost Episodes boxed sets are a joke and an example of pure greed. In set one you get nine episodes and then five bonus features that I'm not sure of exactly what they are, I'll guess either episodes or clip montages. Then if those ""extras"" are episodes then there are fourteen episodes. Then there is the fact that they are spread out so far over four discs, that is just plain stupid! If there are nine episodes plus reterospectives then they should be on two, maybe three discs, and the same really goes if there are fourteen episodes. Next is the packaging, could it BE any worse? First all that ever changes for the front cover from each set to the next is the color, how creative! (Note:I'm being sarcastic) Then there is the box itself, it takes up so much shelf space that you might as well just own the stinkin tapes. Finally the price. Oh the price! For five bucks less I can own The Classic 39 (on only five discs by the way). The price is FAR TOO expensive, if all six sets were combined into one package onto fewer discs and with the price given, maybe even a little more, this set would be more exceptable. What it all comes down to is that I and many others are content with The Classic 39 on DVD. I can honestly live without this, and I'm a rather large fan of the show. MPI, who released this, needs to shape up and when I see all six boxed sets condensed and put into one set at a reasonable price then I'll shell out the cash for this. Unil then, to the moon MPI, to the moon!
P.S. I notice that some episodes get an 'extended version' in later sets, one version (the longer of the two) is enough.",1087257600,32,1693,4.212307692307692
1648194,3,B00005QBY8,"OK: the bad news first.  This is a fairly uneven collection of ""Lost Honeymooners"" episodes.  The transfers are of wildly varying quality; some are quite watchable, while others are extremely grainy or not taken from the proverbial ""best available sources.""  The 4-disc set comes in a clunky box which easily could have been half the size.  The extras are OK; some are actual episodes, while others are compilations of scenes (some taken from shows elsewhere in this set) that merely serve to pad the running time.
But when all is said and done, it's still ""The Honeymooners"" - which means it's very funny indeed.  The classic cast is here (Gleason, Carney, Meadows, Randolph) and for the most part in top form, although some of the episodes are not as well rehearsed as others.  The highlight of the set is the ""New Year's Eve"" episode, a 40-minute extravaganza featuring cameos by Tommy and Jimmy Dorsey.  Another treat is the Christmas show, although it's a bit disconcerting to see Jackie Gleason playing his other characters (including Reginald Van Gleason and Fenwick Babbitt) in a ""Honeymooners"" episode.
If you're looking to start your ""Honeymooners"" DVD collection, the now-available ""Classic 39"" set is obviously the place to start.  But if you're a huge Honeymooners fan (as I am) and can't get enough of their good, clean, raucous brand of humour, you will definitely want to own this collection as well.",1077840000,60,1416,4.970338983050848
1648195,2,B00005QBY8,"I'm not buying these and judging by reviews, you aren't either. Firstly, I have these on a very capable VHS set by MPI, and judging by screenshots, the quality isn't any better on the dvd's. Also, they seem outragously high in price for something I already have on VHS. They do not seem to be in any order and the packaging is totally unattractive. Hey MPI, condense the discs, put these all in a reasonably priced massive set, remaster them, perhaps include extras, and we will buy it. As it stands now, I've been in a holding pattern for over a year.",1049328000,63,552,4.421568627450981
7950408,5,B00005QBY8,"Absolutely fabulous....lost episodes worth a million to me...Lovely ladies Joyce Randolph and Audrey Meadows in their 50's gear, guest stars and the fantastic Jackie Gleason and Art Carney..laughs and fun...not to be missed.

7950413,3,B00005QBY8,"Mine is not so much a review but a request. That someday, the producers would put together a ""complete series"" set, a la the ""I Love Lucy"" set, which would include everything, Classic 39, Lost Eps and the 50th Anniversary special.",1293840000,,230,4.634146341463414
7950414,5,B00005QBY8,"Though not as clear or crisp as the (so called) MAIN ""39 episode"" Collection. It's a small price to pay for these classic, rare episodes of The Honeymooners. Although they vary in length of time and some episodes are funnier than others, watching Gleason, Carney, Meadows and Randolph work their magical chemistry together is, as always thouroghly enjoyable. I HIGHLY recommend this collection to any fan of Jackie Gleason, The Honeymooners or of classic comedies that stand the test of time. I will most anxiously be completing my own collection soon.",1210377600,2,552,5.076923076923077
7950415,4,B00005QBY8,"I bought this boxed set as a gift for my father this Christmas and he went crazy for it. The same box set was 25$ more expensive through one of the main department store retailers here in Canada. I have heard nothing but great reviews from my parents, who are both thrilled with this product. Really and truly a great purchase value that will be sure to put a lot of smiles (and grins) on a lot of the Honeymooners fans' faces out there!

7950416,5,B00005QBY8,"The legion of true ""Honeymooners"" fans has NO room for snobs.  I'm amazed by the number of people who have no interest in the Lost Episodes due to the ""I only love the Classic 39"" syndrome ---- indicating that they regard the LOST as somehow inferior, often without having even SEEN them!  (Odd that Jackie Gleason actually regarded the LOST as generally FUNNIER than the 39).

The ""LOST"" cover 4 seasons before and after the ""39"";  they are absolutely of the same vintage AND inspiration, using the same CAST, WRITERS, DIRECTOR, SETS, etc. as the ""39"".  The only difference is their LENGTH---all are significantly longer or shorter---but the basic material and Comedic Level are the SAME!

True, occasionally the longer shows are padded a bit--but SO WHAT?--it's GLEASON/CARNEY/MEADOWS in their PRIME!! How can you not TREASURE it!? And let's be honest---the quality of the ""39"" varies quite a bit;  ""Please Leave the Premises"" and ""Unconventional Behavior"", for instance, leap to mind as pretty sub-par shows.

And since when does the saga of an ""Everyman"" Bus Driver struggling to eke out an existence in a New York tenement in the 1950's require PRISTINE video quality in order to appreciate it?
C'MON! Just be thankful that these shows were preserved in ANY format!

A few real ""LOST"" Highlights---Buy with Full Confidence!

VOL 1 --""Letter to the Boss"" is beautifully scripted and executed (plus you get to see the great character actor Robert Middleton as Mr. Marshall).

Vol 8--While 4 of the shows on this dvd are only average, ""Ralph's Sweet Tooth"" (a full 36 minutes) is a good as anything they ever did.  The scene with Ralph and Ed rehearsing the TV script must be among the funniest scenes in comedy history.

VOL 12-- At 13 minutes, ""Double Anniversary Party"" is a perfect microcosm of the relationship between Ralph and Alice. It's very funny AND wonderfully touching;  a real gem.

VOL 18---""Stand-In for Murder"" -- A Tour-de-Force for Gleason, playing Kramden AND a dapper doppelganger Gangland Boss---often within the SAME scene! The intricate timing is simply amazing, with Carney, George Petrie, Les Damon and John Marley all performing like the true pros they were under the pressure of Live TV. Unfortunately, the end gets lopped off, since the show ran overtime!

VOL 21---""Stars Over Flatbush""  Norton + Astrology = Hilarity!

VOL 22---If you only buy one dvd, this should be it.

""Catch a Star""-- See Gleason, Carney and Meadows play their onscreen characters AND themselves in real life--all filmed LIVE!

""Battle of the Sexes""---the final 5 seconds of this show contains, in my opinion, the SINGLE FUNNIEST MOMENT in Ralph's comedic output.  It's not a BIG moment--it's very subtle and realistic.

""SONGWRITERS""----This episode should have been held back and broadcast as the VERY LAST show of the entire series--it would have made a fitting conclusion to the Honeymooner's saga, with one of Ralph and Ed's crazy schemes FINALLY paying off!!  It's so sweet, so funny, so profoundly REAL. The interaction between the 4 principles during the final 2 minutes represents humanity at its finest. (Plus the show contains a catchy novelty tune that you'll be humming after a single viewing!)

So don't whine and moan;  GET the ""LOST"" Epsiodes and help preserve the greatest comedic legacy of all time---ALL of it!",1149811200,71,3334,5.029143897996357
7950417,3,B00005QBY8,The Honeymooners is a classic and the programs deserve 5 stars. No doubt about it. The pricing of the lost episodes sets gets zero stars from me. The 39 episode box set costs less than these sets and these sets have a fraction of the material on them. The studio is getting very greedy and trying to milk us for every dollar they can. I'll continue to enjoy the orginal 39 episodes and wait for the price to come down on the lost episodes.,1094515200,34,439,4.238095238095238
