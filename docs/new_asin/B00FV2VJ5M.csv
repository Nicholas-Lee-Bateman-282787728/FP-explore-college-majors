6031638,4,B00FV2VJ5M,"If you like action scenes, Dead Drop has plenty of them and they're done well. Luke Goss is great at playing tough, brooding characters and he doesn't disappoint in this movie. The secondary character Ozzy was likable and worked well with Michael. The relationship between the hero and villain was more complex than in many action movies. The elusive, piercing-eyed villain is played well by Nestor Carbonell. It would have been nice to see a stronger female lead, like the ones in Blood Out and Interview with a Hitman, but the movie didn't really call for it since a large chunk of the plot was based on a damsel in distress. This is one I will watch again.",1405123200,,659,4.593220338983051
6031639,2,B00FV2VJ5M,"""If you come clean to me, if you confess then maybe I'll let you live."" After Michael Shaughnessy (Goss) wakes up he begins to piece together what happened to him. He was thrown out of a plane and left for dead and now he wants revenge. He tracks his target to a Mexican drug trafficking ring and infiltrates it. He seems to slip in too easy but the farther in he goes the more dangerous and twisted it becomes. There isn't really all that much to say about this one. Another in the long line of B rate action movies that are at the same time generic and not sure of what they want to be. There are some good action scenes in this that keep you interested but then other scenes slow it way down and makes it hard to stay interested in. Unfortunately the boring scenes take up most of the movie and by the end you don't really get the emotion the movie was going for. This type of movie has been redone a million times and it needed something more to keep you interested. Overall, the kind of movie that you forget what your watching as you watch, which really hurts the end. I give this a C.",1401408000,4,1091,4.150943396226415
6031640,1,B00FV2VJ5M,"This movie doesn't have a plot, it opens with the main character being pushed out of a plane then he's alive again.  Then I really have no idea what was the rest of the 85 minutes, (spoilers if you still decide to watch it, but I'm assuming you'll probably have pressed stop on this one fairly early on and if so read on to find out what happens), he turns up at some bar in Mexico where his girlfriend tries to hit him by throwing various objects at him then tries to stab him only stopping when her I assume dad tells her to knock it off.  Then some old lady tells him to sign in with the organisation, he says no I want to go back undercover, she says no sign in, he says no I'm going back undercover and they re-meet and do this a few times.  More people try and kill him, he tries to find some guy by shooting, fighting those who won't tell him, constantly interrupted by replaying the pushed out of plane scene every about five minutes probably to make the minimum length of footage to qualify for a movie, I can't think of any other reason. Then he locks some guy in the boot of a car, drives it around, with just a handgun he walks out in the open and takes out four guys with machine guns.

I have absolutely no idea what his motivation was about, why his girlfriend got all stabby or anything, the movie doesn't make any sense at all, or even try to explain anything with a plot or anything.  To say it's not exactly believable would also be a sheer understatement.",1400284800,4,1475,4.179577464788732
6031641,2,B00FV2VJ5M,"Michael (Luke Gross) is shot and tossed from a plane. He survives. He is a CIA agent who has spent 2 years in deep cover. He wants to go back and kill Mexican crime boss Santiago (Nestor Carbonell), the man who shot him, and to hook up again with Rosita (Carolina Castro) but ""it's not about the girl."" The CIA doesn't want him to go back. Don't worry, if you missed Michael getting shot and falling out the plane, they play it over and over again as a memory return flashback, adding a little bit more each time.

Michael does go back to avenge his own death, sort of speak, with a plot that lacks complexity. Except for the f-bombs, the PG-13 love scene, and one hip-hop song, this could have been a made for 70's TV movie down to the lame sound track. Luke Gross fans should enjoy his deadpan mannerisms, chase scenes, and shoot outs...especially the one where he is in the open with two hand guns walking/shooting at 4 men with assault rifles using a car for shielding. Don't try this at home.

This is one of Luke Gross' lower tier films, not recommended for people outside of his die hard fan base.

Parental Guide: F-bomb, brief sex, no nudity.",1382745600,6,1151,4.394366197183099
8618707,2,B00FV2VJ5M,I am a huge Luke Goss but this was not a good movie. The story was okay but all of the long silences and overdone sound effects combined with never ending flashbacks left a lot to be desired.  I barely paid attention to most of it because it lost me about 7 minutes in.  I see why this went straight to video. I would rather have watched it on YouTube than pay the 3.99 I spent to rent it. Wasnt worth that.,1513987200,,407,3.951219512195122

8618715,1,B00FV2VJ5M,"Where to start... I think this movie was made by a poor high school. It's incredibly bad from the lines to the action. The main character should of been shredded due to lack of firepower several tmes. Let alone never taking a bullet. The Mexican gangsters look like a joke and don't even really fit the part. The CIA people are a joke.

Let's just say no... Pass if you can.",1407974400,,374,4.267605633802817
8618716,3,B00FV2VJ5M,"The actress Carolina Castro was my favorite.  I would love to see her in many more movies.  Only a couple of lines can be attributed to her but this was enough to convince me she should be in better films.

This was a ""c"" movie, not ""b"" but ""c"".  It is amazing that Luke Goss continues to make these type of films.  It is obvious to me the objective is to sell this genre of film to a market sector somewhere in Asia or India where language can be altered because I can not imagine this film selling in North America.  If it does then I am so out of the loop of what is good or not that maybe it is time to retire from watching movies.  Is it really possible someone could invest in producing this film?  It is terrible.",1407196800,,720,4.02112676056338
