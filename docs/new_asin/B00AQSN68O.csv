8556602,5,B00AQSN68O,"Excellent DVD.  I found it particularly interesting, because the history backs up the point recently made by politician Boris Johnson regarding the European union. .  Boris said that whenever a ruler destroys democracy in Europe and tries to establish a superstate, it has led to war and suffering. His comment was vilified, but he was merely making an accurate historical point.

Caligula is an example of this, together with Louis XIV, Charlemagne, Napoleon and Hitler.  They all  tried to establish superstates with varying degrees of death and suffering as a result.  I found it particularly interesting that whereas some historians insist that Caligula was mad, the
 film explained that much of his bizarre behaviour was down to his dark sense of humour and the enjoyment he extracted from humiliating others.

A fascinating and well crafted film, that brings Caligula to life.",1469318400,,882,5.205673758865248
