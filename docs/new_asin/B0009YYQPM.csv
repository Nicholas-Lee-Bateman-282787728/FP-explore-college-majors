8070673,1,B0009YYQPM,Super lame. Literally just teaches you how to do a revised sun salutation. Save your money and buy a video that incorporates the sun salutation into an actual workout or something.,1454976000,,180,4.838709677419355
8070674,5,B0009YYQPM,"I love this DVD! It is very basic so beginners could easily do it.  But after the intro and a quick version, there is a holding version that lasts about 12 minutes. I do this segement every monrong. The lady on the DVD uses a prop, but I just do it all the way to the ground. It is a wonderful way to wake up and stretch every morning. It has helped my mind stay calm, do deeper breathing throughout the day and stay limber. If you are looking for an extremely challenging prenatal DVD, this may not be it. But if you are lookin for a relaxing way to stretch, breath and tone, I recommend this DVD.",1383436800,,598,4.067796610169491
8070675,3,B0009YYQPM,"This is not a great dvd, its very slow and boring. Maybe okay for someone who has never done a bit of yoga before but for most not worth it.",1304726400,,140,3.7
8070676,5,B0009YYQPM,"I first checked this video out from the library and then bought it.  It is my favorite prenatal yoga video.  It modifies the classic sun salute series of yoga poses for pregnancy.  There is a 20-minute segment that teaches the routine, a 10-minute segment that leads you through the routine, pausing to breathe at each pose, and there is a 5-minute segment that goes through the routine without pausing to stay at each pose.  There is also a 2-minute relaxation.  Sometimes I do several or all of the segments for a complete practice, and sometimes I choose to do the 5 or 10-minute segment in addition to one of the segments on the Prenatal Yoga DVD that is also by rudra press.",1256169600,2,679,4.532786885245901
8070677,5,B0009YYQPM,"I absolutely LOVED this DVD during my last pregnancy. I did it just about every day. It was nice and short, so very doable on a daily basis, and just felt so good. This is not ""exercise"" in the cardiovascular sense -- it's basically just good stretching and I found it incredibly helpful. I could do this right up to my delivery date, and it was great postpartum as well. The stretches really helped with my typical pregnancy aches and pains.

I've not been big into yoga, mainly because I find most DVDs are too earthy/new age for my taste. But since I do like the physical yoga exercises and stretches I tried this DVD and it was perfect: the basic ""sun salute"" modified for pregnancy, and lacking the typical new age talk. There are two versions of the same routine on this DVD -- one takes 5 minutes, the other has you holding the positions longer and takes about 10 minutes (my favorite!!).

Some days that was the only ""me"" time I really had, so it was a real mental and physical lift for me. Two of my other children (2yo, 4yo) would even do it with me sometimes and they loved it too. lol",1250208000,2,1096,4.315533980582524
8070678,5,B0009YYQPM,"I bought the Prenatal Sun Salute DVD for a friend, but decided to check it out before I wrapped the gift.  After only a week of trying this wonderful program, my back and shoulders are more flexible!  The ""holding version"" only lasts 10 minutes, and it is easy to find the time.  A beautiful, soothing way to start the day!  So yes, I highly recommend this DVD.  If you are a grandmother-to-be, get an extra copy for yourself!",1126051200,8,426,4.410256410256411
