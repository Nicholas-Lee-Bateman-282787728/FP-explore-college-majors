7167255,5,B00XDBMBAK,"GEORGE GENTLY Set 7.  The newest release in this popular, long-running British television series, which debuted on British television in 2007, recently premiered to a mind-bending audience of seven million in the United Kingdom.  In this detective drama, which was originally set in 1964, we now find ourselves in 1969.  The 60s are clearly drawing to a close, as Queen Elizabeth II unnecessarily points out in her Christmas speech. And we find  Detective Chief Inspector George Gently (Martin Shaw, DEATH IN HOLY ORDERS), sensing the world is changing around him at a dizzying paceeconomically, politically, socially, culturally. As the 1960s draw to a close and a new era beckons, he feels more and more estranged and ill-equipped to cope. But for Gently and his fellow officers in this police procedural, one thing remains constant in their northeast England beat: violent gruesome crime. The detective drama is based on novelist Alan Hunters decades-long series.  In four all-new, feature-length British mystery episodes, Gently is again assisted in his crime-fighting duties by Detective Sergeant John Bacchus (Lee Ingleby, PLACE OF EXECUTION), who is up for promotion to inspector, and Constable Rachel Coles (Lisa McGrillis, HEBBURN), who was introduced in the previous series, 6, is now preparing to take her sergeants exam.  The boxed 4 disc set, which was given me as a review copy, includes four feature-length productions, running approximately 371 minutes, no bonus material, and subtitles, thank goodness, for whom among us can claim to understand Geordie-speak?

Gently has been characterized as a former top Scotland Yard sleuth, who left the force after the  hit-run death of his wife, planning to retire.  Then the detective  discovered that Joe Webster, the sadistic criminal who killed Isabelle, his wife, had retreated to northeast England, and follows him there.  He is made a DCI, a very high rank for the vicinity; the local force, in fact, appears to have been built around him.  Of course, he finds the local force corrupt, as he also considered Scotland Yard. While Gently, in his fourth year of grieving widowhood, and Bacchus, who yearns to drive his sports car to London and never come back, collaborate as usual in their investigations, both are harboring secrets from each other that threaten to bring their professional careers to an end. Gently, who has no wish to go back to London, is no spring chicken  hes gray-haired on-screenand old enough to be pensionable off-screen; has been diagnosed with a serious disease.  The cocky, easy to dislike Bacchus has gotten involved in an unfortunate relationship. The episodes are:

1. Gently with the Women. To Coles' disgust, Bacchus and his male colleagues are dismissive of a prostitute's claims she was raped, urge her to drop the charges. In the meantime, a prostitute has been killed, a new policy  adopted that requires police  to warn patrons of brothels and street prostitutes that such behavior is illegal.
2. Breathe in the Air. The seeming suicide of a lovely young blonde doctor, of noble birth and ample trust funds, by lethal injection. has Gently wondering why she had a bruise on the side of her face. Even the discovery of a suicide note leaves him unconvinced.  This episode frankly, was a bit silly, and left us in this house worried that in the next episode the cops would achieve world peace.
3. Gently Among Friends. The body of a cash-strapped property developer is found beneath Newcastle's Tyne Bridge; Gently again suspects a murder dressed up as a suicide. The death followed a fight with two childhood friends, one a union organizer, the other a restaurateur. This episode includes some pretty funny scenes of the otherwise somber Gently and Bacchus.
4. Son of a Gun. An armed robbery at a bank interrupts Christmas Eve celebrations at the station, sets Gently, Bacchus, and Coles on the trail of a gang of local skinheads. Coles cuts her hair, goes undercover.

Outstanding photography of the threatening northeast environment; compelling, complex, multi-level mysteries that address modern problems despite having been set decades in the past; seamless performances in the lively cop shop continue to make this one of the most successful detective dramas on British television (Daily Express Saturday Magazine, UK).  We here find it  addictive, sure hope the team can last another season.",1443225600,2,4397,5.147471910112359
7167256,5,B00XDBMBAK,"George Gently series began well in 2007 and has raised the bar ever since. Competes in quality to Midsomer Murder, especially with the two-generational leading characters. A great series that always gets better & better. It's the multi-generational comradery that makes this series unique. Of course there is crime violence and blood, it is murder investigations, but suitable for older teens through adults. Dramatic HD cinematography. Packed suspense & cop action. 4 [cinema feature length] exciting episodes have different themes. Great adaptations of Alan Hunter crime novels, filmed in HD [great for Blu-ray fans.] All episodes depict rural Durham England set in the year 1969. As always period background music is fun.

George Gently (Martin Shaw) is a fine copper, yet grieving widower of 4 years. His assistant John Bacchus (Lee Ingleby), and there is the regular PC Taylor (Simon Hubbard) both with Gently forever. Rachel Coles (Lisa McGrillis) also returns from last season and takes a major role in the investigations.

SDH SUBTITLES for this 6th series of 4 long feature episodes
----1 Gently With the Women--
DS Bacchus and other male cops laugh off a prostitute's cry of `rape.' Coles is outraged. DCI Gently begins to tie together unprosecuted rape cases with a strangle-murdered woman. Bacchus has his own mistress liaisons with Gemma (Annabel Scholey) a mother of 2 & wife of a DI across the river. She and the affair are an ongoing sub-plot as is Gently's health. Derek Riddell (The Village) is in this and the next episode.
----2 Breathe in the Air--
Was it a doctor's suicide by injection Gently's unconvinced. Asbestos manufacture seems connected to the Northumbrian lady doc. Gently secretly ponders his medical diagnosis. Bacchus is up for promotion to Inspector and his married secret lover moves to London. See Lesley Nicol (Downton Abbey).
----3 Gently Among Friends--
A victim amid a rubbish pile during the bin strike (garbage strike), under Newcastle's Tyne Bridge, looks to Gently like another murder dressed as a suicide. Coles digs into the spouse's side while DI Bacchus goes undercover. This episode includes the most hilarious scene between Gently and Bacchus ever created in the entire history of the series. DC Coles takes the Sgt test. Louise Brealey (`Casualty' `Bleak House') guest stars.
----4 Son of a Gun--
Christmas Eve Newcastle bank robbery ends with a dead getaway driver. Coles goes undercover infiltrating a suspect skinhead gang, which goes awry. Gently confides to Bacchus about his condition. An intense season-ending episode.",1442275200,15,2578,5.239709443099273
7167257,5,B00XDBMBAK,"George Gently is one of those series that draws you back each season. Martin Shaw, who plays George Gently, seems to be the quintessential man of the 1960's. He is fair, upholds the law, does not suffer fools gladly, and as he says, ""We are there for the dead, to speak for them.""

Series 7 is the best in my opinion. Gently is not afraid to face any issue, put his job on the line, and face the obstacles put in his way. His Sergeant, Bacchus, played by Lee Ingleby, is a difficult man to like. He is brash, impulsive, jumps to conclusions, negative about many situations, sexist like many men in the 60's, but there is some spark there. He seems to grow on me. In the past series we were introduced to WOC Rachel Corse played by Lisa McGrillis. She is the perfect match for Bacchus. She is smart, clever, unafraid of speaking her mind, and Gently likes her,and he becomes her mentor. Of course, Bacchus is jealous, she is everything he is not.

Gently came to the Northeast of England after his wife was killed in London. He gave up his Scotland Yard position, a place Bacchus yearns to go. Now firmly planted here, Gently faces some difficult circumstances. Bacchus finds love in all the wrong places and Rachel shows her smarts. This series handles delicate matters with grace and dignity, the scripts are first rate and the acting is sharp and clever.

There are four episodes each about 90 minutes long. The filming is superb, the countryside glorious, the dialect I have no trouble understanding, but there are subtitles if you need them. I saw this series via Acorn TV, the best place to find mysteries.

7167259,5,B00XDBMBAK,"BREAKING NEWS: GEORGE GENTLY RENEWED FOR SEASON 8 - THE FINAL SEASON.
Scheduled to air in the UK in late 2017, in the US in early 2018.
----------

D.C.I. George Gently (played by Martin Shaw) debuted on British television in 2007.
The first episode was set in 1964 .
The final episode of Series Seven takes place during the final week week of 1969.

All seven series have English SDH subtitles, and are uncut - Unlike the PBS Masterpiece Mystery broadcast versions.
Extras: Season Seven has three brief interviews with cast members.

He was Inspector George Gently of Scotland Yard when his wife was killed by a hit-and-run driver.
Overcome by depression, he retreats to a small city in Northern England *, where everyone speaks in a bizarre pseudo-Scottish dialect (children = ""bairns"").
Gently is appointed Detective Chief Inspector of the local police.
DCI Gently is a big fish in a small pond.

The police force he joins is remarkably corrupt (as was the force he left).
DCI Gently does not approve of local policing methods, but he is not above looking the other way if it will advance his investigation.
His sergeant is D.S. John Bacchus, young and trendy and thoroughly unlikeable (played by Lee Ingleby with a Beatles haircut).
Sergeant Bacchus' goal in life (frustrated by DCI Gently) is to drive his sports car to Swinging London and join Scotland Yard.
I'm not sure why Gently keeps him on, but they are still together after seven seasons.
Sergeant Bacchus did mature a bit following the traumatic events of the Season Five finale (""Gently in the Cathedral"") -
the best episode in the series.
It featured a guest appearance from Kevin Whately (better known as Inspector Lewis) as George Gently's old friend Inspector Don McGhee.

Season Six introduced a new character: WPC (Women's Police Constable) Rachel Coles, (played by Lisa McGrillis).
Unfortunately she brings out the worst in Sergeant Bacchus, who is jealous of the [professional] attention paid to her by DCI Gently.
I'm worried about Sergeant Bacchus.

Season Seven struck me as the best writing so far (though episode two - ""Breathe in the Air""-  is incredibly manipulative).
There is some re-thinking of the series:
-- George Gently has health worries and is drinking too much. Ominous.
-- On DCI Gently's recommendation, there are two promotions:
Detective Inspector John Bacchus and Detective Sergeant Rachael Coles (could a sequel be in the works?).

The Season Seven epilogue indicates that another Season is planned, but I am worried.
George Gently, a World War II veteran, is in his fifties.
The actor Martin Shaw just turned seventy and can't keep this up forever.
I will miss him when he goes.

* The largest city in the area is Durham (population 50,000), home to Durham Cathedral - featured in the Season 5 finale.
Rev. John Bacchus Dykes (1823-1876) was a famous Nineteenth Century clergyman from Durham (thanks Wikipedia).
Seasons 3-7 were filmed at several locations in Northeast England including Durham.
[ Seasons 1 and 2 were filmed in Ireland ]

Dalgliesh and Gentry have a lot in common.

7167260,5,B00XDBMBAK,"Okay I have loved Martin Shaw since I first saw him as a Welsh intern in 1973.  Then 5 years later he was in roll I discovered in 1990.  Tracking down Ray Doyle, I discovered a few movies, TV specials, a chief of police, a judge and lately from Scotland Yard whose personal tragedy made him move north and remain being a copper.  He is nearly 35 years older than Ray Doyle at age 70.  And still a fox!  Have recently learned that his 2 co-stars in The Professionals are both dead!
Anyway I am looking eagerly for season 7 of George Gently.  But anyone have access to DVD doctors in the house, Ladder of Swords or A&E?",1438128000,7,617,4.186440677966102

That said, the change in this DVD is much bolder, and I don't think most shows could have pulled it off.

It's almost refreshing to have someone killed by strangulation or knife. The insecurity of John Bacchus, his partner and I really don't know how Rachel puts up with his male chauvinism. It seems to run ramped throughout society and makes me realize, it hasn't changed much. Rachel is extremely tolerant and maybe females are tolerant in general considering how deep and wide the attitude is of females being inferior humans.

7167366,4,B00XDBMBAK,"This is the next entry in a good series from the BBC loosely based on books by Alan Hunter. This George is a grittier Gently, but Martin Shaw is spot on with his portrayal. The supporting casts are always good.",1453248000,,210,4.275
7167367,5,B00XDBMBAK,"If there is a better police drama on television I'm not aware of it. GEORGE GENTLY is superb. Martin Shaw is the spine of the show and his presence transcends the slickness and cosmetic polish of so many contemporary programs. GEORGE GENTLY is set in the midlands of England and it's not a pretty place a lot of the time. Rain, grey skies, their fair share of criminals. But it never gets depressing, mostly because Shaw's George Gently is also a man of great principle and morality. His sense of right and wrong shines through even the bleakest story-line, a reminder that audiences crave a hero, a protagonist they can admire and cheer. George Gently has survived the death of his wife at the start of the series, a near-fatal bullet wound and sundry other close calls. If anything overtakes him it may be his own mortality. But we'll have to keep watching to see what happens next.

Shaw is 100% supported by the outstanding Lee Ingleby as Gently's professional associate and now friend, John Bacchus. Bacchus is no shadow of Gently, although he is greatly influenced by him. He's a fully-realized characterization in his own right.

And in series seven they are further complemented (after her arrival in series six) by WPC Rachel Coles, played by the delightful Lisa McGrillis. She makes for a brilliant addition to the team. And in those '60s skirts! Wow...

GEORGE GENTLY is truly the cream of the crop, one show that you can hardly wait to see the next installment.",1451606400,,1473,4.723735408560311

8715754,4,B00XDBMBAK,"""George Gently"" Series 7 takes place in 1969 as the end of the sixties fast approaches. DCI George Gently (Martin Shaw) experiences deteriorating health, as DS John Bacchus has his first serious romantic relationship since his divorce. He's become a hard worker, regularly going above and beyond the call of duty, but it's not clear what prompted his newfound diligence. WPC Rachel Coles (Lisa McGrillis) takes on a larger role this season, as Gently encourages her to join CID and to take the sergeant's exam. I didn't find Gently as likable this season as in series past. He is not just an ethical cop trying to fight corruption anymore. Rather, he is overbearingly self-righteous, and some of his social attitudes are anachronistic for a member of the Great Generation who is a  police inspector in the 1960s. The often-impromptu undercover work also struck me as unrealistic. Sexual politics, corporate corruption, public health, and wildcat strikes are some of the social issues incorporated into this season's mysteries. Series 7 is entertaining, but this is not Gently's best season.

The four 90-minute episodes are:

""Gently with the Women"": DS Bacchus and WPC Coles are staking out a brothel in Durham with the intention of naming and shaming the customers when they stop off-duty police officer Walter Nunn (Derek Riddell) from entering. Bacchus gives Nunn a pass, much to Coles' disgust. Unbeknownst to her, Bacchus is having an affair with Nunn's wife Gemma (Annabel Scholey) and doesn't want to draw attention to himself. A prostitute named Tina Hall (Emily Woof) comes to the station to report an alleged rape by three men outside a pub, but Bacchus and his colleagues dismiss her complaint. The body of a strangled, unidentified young woman is found in the woods near the river. As DCI Gently and DS Bacchus search for her identity, Gently's attention turns to the men who patronize local prostitutes, including Nunn, and an earlier rape complaint made by Tina Hall against a client. Meanwhile, Gently seeks diagnosis of an apparent neurological condition.

""Breathe in the Air"": Dr. Valerie Cullen (Deirdre Mullins) is found dead, propped against a tree by the roadside with a syringe of barbiturates nearby. DCI Gently's suspicions are aroused by a bruise on one side of her face and corresponding loose teeth. When Gently and Bacchus speak to Dr. Michael Plant (Jonathan Cullen), with whom she shared a practice, they learn that Valerie suffered from depression, a motor-neuron disease, and was separated from her husband Andrew Cullen (Jason Done), also a physician. The state of Valerie's apartment deepens Gently's resolve to investigate, which takes them to WPC Cole's hometown Easterhope. From the parents' of Cole's childhood friend, Bridget (Lesley Nicol) and Norman (Nicholas Woodeson), they learn that Valerie was investigating the effects of asbestos exposure on employees of the old Dennig's Linings factory. Meanwhile, Bacchus is promoted to inspector and Gently encourages Coles to take the sergeant's exam.

""Gently Among Friends"": During a wildcat strike of garbage collectors in Newcastle, the body of a man with a head wound is found on the growing rubbish pile. When they try to track down his identity from a pawn shop receipt and dog racing ticket found in the dead man's pocket, DCI Gently and DI Bacchus found that he used names of local civic leaders. He is identified as Scott Parker (Nicholas Sidi) when his wife Jo (Louise Brealey) reports her husband missing. Scott and Jo had attended a birthday party for Scott's friend Petey Mcgath (Anthony Flanagan), along with another friend Michael Woodruff (Adrian Bower), who was leading the bin strike, earlier in the evening. Petey and Michael say that Scott walked out of the bar in the wee hours after a brawl involving broken chairs. The discovery that Scott was deep in debt and had lost money on an idealistic real estate project casts the friends' relationship in a different light. This mystery is uncommonly plausible.

""Son of a Gun"": A week after the death penalty is abolished, the police in the Newcastle station are celebrating Christmas Eve when they are interrupted by a bank robbery. A gang of skinheads armed with reconditioned WWII-era Sten guns held up a bank. A teenager named Kit McDonald (Patrick McNamee) tussled with one of them, and the bank security guard (Danny Cunningham) fired at the getaway car. DCI Gently knows the young man; he is the son of a soldier Gently served with in the war, and his mother Edith (Elizabeth Carling) is worried about his well-being. The detectives are up early to work on Christmas Day trying to locate the getaway car and are saddened to learn that the driver was a teenaged girl named Lexie Dodds (Emma Lundy). Bacchus wants to focus on the skinheads, but Gently insists on pursuing the source of the guns. To this end, newly-promoted DS Coles gets to know a skin called Jonjo Burden (Jody Latham).",1515110400,,4948,5.028048780487805
