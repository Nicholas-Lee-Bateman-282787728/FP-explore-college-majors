5011669,5,B006OVPPHM,"I am an American living in France and I think it should be shown in the USA.  It is a fantastic series with great characters and acting.  It is important to see what humanity can do to others and learn a lesson from it.  We still haven't learned that lesson whether it is over religion or race or pure self interest.  This series, and I have seen all of the 5 seasons, will give the viewer a real insight of the atrocities that occurred in this war.  Let us not repeat history.",1436918400,3,477,4.141304347826087
5011670,5,B006OVPPHM,The stories were so well written that I could not take my eyes off and trying to guess who were the murderer. So far the DVDs that I had viewed were very clear and without any distortion - well beyond my expectation.,1406332800,2,216,4.166666666666667
5011671,5,B006OVPPHM,"I bought seasons 1-5 of this show and I was hooked by about 2 mins in. A absolutely fantastic series, though yes, you will need at least conversational french knowledge to follow it.  Only seasons 1 and 5 had french subtitles.
It gives you a window into the lives of people from all sides. The Germans, the french villagers who just want to get by, the collaborators and the conflicts between De Gualle and Communist resistance groups and the Maquis. Beautifully and tastefully done.
Highly anticipating Season 6 as Season 5 left us with a lot of cliffhangers.

Only downside, this does not have english subtitles which means that, while raving about this show to my friends, none of them will be able to watch it. They don't speak french.",1393804800,12,739,4.676923076923077
5011672,5,B006OVPPHM,This is an addition to my collection of favorites. Have watched all shows on television and I am thrilled to have them available to watch whenever i want to.,1389830400,3,157,4.448275862068965
5011673,5,B006OVPPHM,"What would you have done when, in June 1940, the French Army collapses, and suddenly the Wehrmacht has come to your little village, not far from Switzerland, and the supposedly free region of the Vichy government? Would you try to live life as usual? become a collaborator? join, or at least help, the resistance?  (Remember that at this period, Hitler and Stalin were still embracing one another as allies, which makes things all the more difficult if you're a communist).

Emotionally gripping and gritty, but if you're looking for a French Downton Abbey, look elsewhere. This ain't it.
PS: At the moment it seems you will need an all-region player for these disks, which are PAL, not NTSC. And you will need some knowledge of French; subtitles for the hard of hearing are there, but they're in French.",1375142400,9,804,4.818840579710145
5011674,5,B006OVPPHM,"I loved how the characters evolved over time, the 4 years of German occupation of France.  They changed their politics, achieved heroism or villainy while still remaining human, and most of them fell in love with someone on the other side, of course.  French is clear and easy to follow, the acting superb.",1515456000,,306,4.754716981132075
5011675,5,B006OVPPHM,"This is a excellent, often riveting story of ordinary people in a small village in Eastern France trying to survive the German occupation during WWII. They all seem to make a variety of difficult decisions on a daily basis. Where is right and wrong in such situations? Does survival trump everything else? One might like a character in one scene and then be disgusted with him or her in the next. You will empathize, admire, critique and judge them. You will fear for them.

So much of history is battle scenes, heroes & villains; they avoid that here. We learned a few things about the war we didn't previously know. Both my husband and I are totally hooked and we are well into the second season (and we just bought the next four seasons).  For those of you who have watched the French crime series ""Spiral"" you will recognize two actors who were in that series.",1513382400,3,864,4.532051282051282
5011676,5,B006OVPPHM,"This is an important series depicting the complex issues of occupied France during the war. The series examines the role of the Resistence, the Nazi occupation, and collaborators during the daily life of a town.
The series is highly realistic, might be a bit gritty and shocking for some viewers. English subtitles are not a problem.
The series starts before invasion. The behavior under great danger of numerous villagers and the consequences.",1512432000,5,444,5.180555555555555
5011677,5,B006OVPPHM,"My husband and I could not find anything more in Italian that we wanted to watch on MHz so we tried French and are so glad we found this one.  It is very authentic, according to my Italian husband who lived in a small village in Croatia, which was Italy at the time.  He was too young to remember much but his family told him similar and sometimes much worse stories.  A couple of uncles were taken to the ovens and the Americans bombed and killed one uncle.  No hard feeling toward the Americans, though, but can't say the same about the Germans of that time.  Anyway, the stories, the acting and the scenery are all very good in this rendition of the time and place.  We have been spending too much time binging on this series but it is worth every minute.",1509840000,,758,4.265734265734266
5011678,5,B006OVPPHM,"This is indeed an outstanding series with strong production values, excellent acting, fine directing and tight editing. It's always a good sign when a 55-minute episode seems to fly past and all too easy to binge watch a whole disc at a time. However, something - or rather almost everything! -  appears to have gone awry in Series 4 (or Series 5 as listed by IMDB), including direction, editing and worst of all, script. Almost the entire 12 episodes gets bogged down in some young male resistance fighters (or draft dodgers) performing a play in a forest (in World War 2, as if!!). The many main characters make very brief appearances in these 12 episodes and we're left with the B-Group of talent who are lumbered with a poor script and who perform their lines as in ""eating chestnut and nettle stew"" but look like they've never missed a meal in their lives. What should have been an unbelievable story diversion for 15 minutes is spun out over about 5 hours and 7 episodes. As for the main characters, there are several instances where they act completely out of character (like leaving a note in a cafe for the Nazis to find, after 3 years of strict security protocols to name but one). And then, just like that, everything returns to top-quality with the start of Series 5. Was their a pay dispute with the entire production company about 2013? I know not but don't let the quite average Series 4 detract you from the rest of the other excellent 54 episodes.",1509235200,2,1464,4.587786259541985
5011679,1,B006OVPPHM,"Just could not adjust to the English subtitles.  Looked like a GREAT series, but couldn't enjoy the acting, since I spent all my time reading subtitles!!  Would love to see the series with English DUBBED instead of subtitles!!",1506038400,,226,4.921052631578948

5011683,5,B006OVPPHM,I love this series and have ordered the next 2 seasons. I watch French movies in an attempt to further my limited French language skills.

5011687,5,B006OVPPHM,"If you love French and are interested in the history of the German occupation of France during WWII, this TV mini-series is for you.  It investigates the question, ""How is survival possible--whether personal integrity is maintained or not--when under control of a foreign invader?""  Historically accurate, the fictional drama, although somewhat soap opera-esque, comes alive with complex interrelationships and plausible development of characters.  Every episode is a true nail-biter because all characters live under the burden and fear of not knowing who can be trusted and who will denounce whom.  The episodes also accurately portray the philosophies of competing factions in France:  the collaborators, the communists, and the Resistance.  Sex, money, torture, and power can save or condemn the guilty and the innocent.  In a nutshell, this mini-series is a spectacular depiction of France's past and its continuing anguish over the German occupation.  The episodes are in French with English subtitles, which translate the French very well.  I highly recommend this mini-series.",1495843200,,1084,5.6419753086419755
5011688,5,B006OVPPHM,"My wife and I have purchased and watched the entire series of A French Village and regard it as a significant dramatic and historical achievement. This lengthy, thought-provoking, occasionally melodramatic, deeply engaging drama examines the terrible decisions and horrendous life faced by everyday people in a small French village that falls under Nazi occupation. The acting is superb, the characters filled with contradictions and imperfections as they make grim and not always successful efforts at humanity or collaboration. We were impressed with the willingness of the French to face a past that generations before have whitewashed. The series does descend into soap opera from time to time, but it's a very long series and the soap opera helps hold the determined viewer. There are also moments and scenes of disturbing and moving drama that are high art: spoiler alert - the discussion between the Nazi sympathizer mayor and the Communist on the night prior to their double execution, as the two opposites find themselves united by surprising common bonds, would be but one example. Somebody who knew the subject, knew the human heart, and knew how to write did that one, and the actors brought it home. There are others equally shattering. The human train wreck represented in the series is both fascinating and repelling to watch; the choices faced by people trying to cope under a vile regime were very often terrible ones, the risks often fatal - no matter which side was chosen. The rewards of collaboration were a sugar high that didn't last, except for a few who got away with it. One resounding lesson is the need to never allow a repeat of this awful chapter of human history or anything close to it. Vive La France for producing an historical drama of artistic merit that looks at a long-ignored past with relevance for us today.",1495152000,9,1848,4.964516129032258

5011690,5,B006OVPPHM,"This is actually a review for the whole series, not just season one. To sum it up in one word, it's FANTASTIC. The show is exciting and very informative as well. You really get a sense of the French people's experience during the Nazi occupation in WWII and you live their triumphs, dilemmas and pain right along with them. My only complaint is that some of the storylines and relationships seemed quite implausible to me (such as Marchetti and Rita and Lucienne and Marguerite). Also, the town of Villaneuve is supposed to be fairly small, so it was hard to believe that a well-known French Resistance member could creep around town on a secret mission and not be recognized! So expect to ""suspend disbelief"" at times during the series, but certainly don't let it stop you from watching this wonderful show.",1493510400,,808,4.73758865248227

5011695,5,B006OVPPHM,"One of the best series that I have watched. I have only seen three of the seven seasons; but the acting, production quality, and historical significance make it a must see.  Painful, the series tells part of the story of what it was like living under German control during  WWII.",1491782400,,279,4.56
5011696,5,B006OVPPHM,"Wow! Despite the subtitles (I don't speak French), this series will carry you you into the story as if you had lived it. The author must have interviewed dozens of the old timers who lived during this period as it is full of the trials and tribulations as well as the everyday life the French experienced in German occupied France. Interesting as to how it compares occupied with Vichy France.",1491609600,2,393,4.628571428571429

5011698,5,B006OVPPHM,If you are thinking about purchasing a French Village I would strongly suggest you do. The stories of each & everyone of the characters is addicting.,1490313600,2,149,4.769230769230769
5011699,5,B006OVPPHM,"First episode I was hooked. Next two I though it was going to spiral into telenovela territory it seemed but Episode Four and onwards ratcheted it up. So much happens each episode although the pace is that of village life. Plenty does happen but at as sinister a pace as you'd expect in 1940 Nazi-occupied France.

You do learn a lot as not much has been put on film or TV about what life was like for civilians during World War II. It's pretty eye opening. It's also super heartbreaking as we have the hindsight of knowing what will happen. When the Jewish principal of the school after getting fired for
""being Jewish"" and asks her cop friend whether she should register as a Jew with the authorities, he naively at that point in the story just shrugs and says basically it can't hurt.

Also, the female characters bar Fake Older Roger Federer's wife  (as I call the sawmill owner Mr. Schwartz) are all very well played right from their first appearance in the series. The postlady is one who really sparkles from her first scene--so bubbly yet practical. The teacher Lucienne also grows on you as the series progresses and her meeting (SPOILER ALERT) with the Gestapo head is doubly heartbreaking. Lastly, is it just me or does farm wife Marie look a bit like Ashley Judd?

Finally, the French reputation for having mistresses holds but I was surprised by how much the attitude of the cheated-on was pretty standard to ours in North America. In other words, no one likes being cheated on AT ALL in this. I actually expected more a laissez-faire attitude to this among French people but maybe it's more a country vs. city thing there. I really thought the other spouse would then cheat on their spouse as revenge or just because. It's definitely added in because sex sells but it's done where it seems pretty realistic.

There are 30 minutes of extras on the DVD and all feature clips of actual French survivors of the war talking about such things as the black market, fate of the Jews, the Resistance, the exodus of war refugees, the attitude towards Marshal Petain and how German-occupied France ran on German Time (literally and even more literally being an hour ahead of Vichy France to the south).

Can't wait to start in on Season Two.",1490140800,,2244,4.625628140703518
5011700,2,B006OVPPHM,"Turns important, little-known history into slow-paced, common melodrama. One's

5011702,5,B006OVPPHM,"Years ago I was told about my family""s experiences in occupied Holland. Season 1 of a FrenchVillage put it in clearer perspective. They, too, had to deal with the loss of freedom, collaborators, persecution of Jews, etc. The new angle in this first season covering the first months of the occupation was the role of the communist party, which had no interest in joining or supporting the Resistance. The reason: solidarity with the German working class. Looking forward to next six seasons as conditions are sure to deteriorate",1489276800,4,527,5.0

Characters are completely addictive, and so many of them possess that magical quality of being both appealing and detestable, often at the same time.  The first few episodes were a little slow but by mid-season it is rocking and by season 5 you won't be able to stop thinking about it until the next viewing.  Incredible actors that not only make you forget that you're reading subtitles but, eventually, that they are even speaking another language.

5011710,5,B006OVPPHM,"The French occupation by the Germans and their collaboration in the WWII has been a vast source of inspiration for writers and filmmakers since shortly after the end of the war. For rightful reasons, It doesnt take much to define the good and bad guys and the drama around the web of incoherences. History provides that for free. Just recently, we had The Nightingale, All the Light We Cannot See and Sarahs Key.

A French Village surpassed everything that was ever done. This is an epic proportion French produced mini-series that recounts the occupation from day one until after the war. As the name implies, this is about the occupation of a fictional small town. It is not about life in Paris. In a small town, people know each other. So we have the relationship of these natural acquaintances evolving as war progresses. Some people got closer to each other; some people got more distant; some of them went away; some of them showed up.

The cast of young and promising French, Belgian and German actors is beyond fantastic. The production is top notch. They transported us to that small French Village during the war. We live their drama.

Each season captures the event of one year. We have all the elements of the war that we all know well (if you dont, one more reason to watch the show). It is a TV show, so we have a little bit - just a little bit - of inconsistencies. Thats way beyond reasonable. In overall, the show is very respectful to History.

This is a must see to anyone interested in high quality TV,  WWII History, or both. A very good supplement is Marcel Ophus The Sorrow and the Pity (Le Chagrin et la Piti&eacute;). Watch the ""French Village"" and then Ophus documentary. It will all come together.",1481673600,3,1724,4.584415584415584

5011712,5,B006OVPPHM,"This review is for Seasons 1 through 5

This is a very rare, focused series on WWII occupied France and in particular, as the title suggests, in one village. The perspective is primarily from the French point of view and addresses some conflicting and painful historical moments in French history with regards to patriotism, collaboration, and resistance mitigated by circumstance and survival. No one wears a complete white or black hat.

The cinematography and acting are mostly excellent and clearly show France has reached parity with other high level international film productions. There are very few special effects thereby relying on strong character development and human interest stories. The series initially moves along slowly while building characters and scenarios but later begins to elevate the tension and action as it progresses through the war years.

I wavered between four (like) and five (love) stars but obviously decided on the latter because I feel it is mostly engaging and warrants a look. For those with short attention spans who thrive on cinematic bling it may be a little slow and droll. There are six and supposedly a final coming seventh year series to this program so if one cares to watch all, be prepared for hours of viewing. English subtitles.",1478563200,2,1281,5.119617224880383

School children on a picnic are attacked by a Nazi plane as it makes a strafing run on them, because they are playing on a cannon.  Families are separated.

The demarcation line literally cuts their community. I'm not going to go into details. The characters are so well developed. You cannot tell who is a French loyalist, who is siding with the Germans-some are communists. There are secret trysts, marriages breaking apart. Just a beautifully told story of a sad piece of history. Trust me. You'll be left wanting more. Shouting at the TV to tell folks to look out!

5011737,5,B006OVPPHM,"Unlike current American films that portray hero-like characters in violent and sexual content as a focus. This French production depicts vulnerable, earthy characters who fall into frightening situations, sometimes caused by their own foibles. WW II presents violent footage; sexual promiscuity is handled in a 'natural' situation and the viewer can understand their predicament. Gallantry and courage are portrayed as a measure of commitment to a common cause.

The characters are believable and as you go along, you will have your favorites.  We are so removed from war (thank Heaven) in America.  It's been hundreds of years since our country was occupied that I don't think we really appreciate the stress and sacrifice that goes with occupation.  I will be buying season 2 also and probably, honestly, the whole series on DVD at some point.

Highly recommend!

I had 3 years of French in high school and 2 semesters in college.  I would by no means say that I'm conversant.  I do understand much of what's said and think that watching the series (it has English subtitles) could help students of French get a feel for normal conversation.

This is very revealing regarding what ordinary people had to deal with in circumstances over which they had absolutely no control. I grew up in France and came back to the US when I was 12 years old. I go back every chance I get because I love the culture, people and history so much.",1452988800,11,470,4.119565217391305
5011749,5,B006OVPPHM,"A detailed, brilliantly-produced story of the German occupation of a typical French town during the Second World War, A FRENCH VILLAGE is an absolute revelation for fans of WWII programs. It is exquisitely produced, with the ring of truth that comes from being made by filmmakers who grew up knowing this was their actual history. The ensemble acting is flawless and there isn't an inkling of vanity from any of them, even when the women are required to look anything but glamourous.

Leading this stellar ensemble is Robin Renucci as Daniel, the village's main doctor who is also the mayor. Caught in a private moral dilemma with his wife, Renucci plays his character with an air of fragile authority that just barely masks his underlying panic. One wrong move and he and his wife will be exposed (they have used false pretenses to ""adopt"" an infant). Just as dangerous is Daniel's careful maneuvering around the Nazi occupiers of their village, who view Daniel as the man responsible for implementing and enforcing their new rules. If he does anything to fall out of favour... well, we all know our WWII history, don't we?

This is the genius of the series concept. Most of the central characters have a personal problem they have to reconcile all while being concerned about how to carry on living under German occupation. For many, like Daniel, ""the war is over"", so just cooperate--up to a point--and hope for the best. Others are more cautious about doing anything that could be perceived as aiding the enemy. Every person must make a choice, then co-exist with everyone around them. And rarely, as we see as the show unfolds, is anything or anyone black or white.

The deliberate pacing of A FRENCH VILLAGE might seem slow for some, but taken as an opportunity to depict a panorama of stories in realistic detail, it perfectly suits the low-key but epic approach.

Those who appreciate military history will positively revel in details like the German tanks, half tracks and cars, not to mention the uniforms and weaponry. The casting directors also deserve a nod for finding the rich assortment of faces. All the actors are perfectly cast for their look as well as their talent, whether as German soldiers (officers or enlisted men) or villagers. No single person stands out for being too good-looking, for example, yet there are plenty of people who are attractive for other reasons. Belgian actress Nade Dieu as Marie, for example, is astonishingly sexy, even though she isn't wearing an ounce of obvious makeup and her hair looks like it hasn't been washed in weeks. There's a simplicity, an earthiness about her that is very appealing.

Few, if any, of the actors will be well known in North America, not even Nicolas Gob (surely a name one would remember!). This is an asset. No distracting stars. Everyone is completely believable in their role.

Morally complex, filled with multi-layered plotting and rich attention to period detail, A FRENCH VILLAGE is a must-have for anyone who luxuriates in period pieces. Perfect for binge watching on a cold winter's day.

And the glorious thing is--this is only season one! There are more coming, with six in total (thus far) produced in France.

A FRENCH VILLAGE is sure to occupy a place in the very best of film collections. Thanks to Mhz Networks for their continuing commitment to seeking out and making available some of the finest European television programs for North American audiences.",1451606400,41,3452,4.898972602739726
5011750,5,B006OVPPHM,"I lived in Poitiers, France, for three years (1962-1964) which were for me the second half of elementary school. That was only twenty years after the occupation. My family lived one year among French people in a house on Rue de la Grange St. Pierre at the edge of the city. Fortunately, I was old enough to still have extremely vivid memories of my experiences. Unfortunately, I was too young to fully appreciate the opportunities I had. I wish I had asked Monsieur Thomas, our landlord, and Gabby, an elderly neighbor who was our first baby sitter, if they would mind telling me about those terrible years for the French people. Though I went to American school, my 4th grade class went to the cole in Poitiers for one period each week and French children came as exchange students to our school. I feel like I'm back there each time I watch an episode. This specific series is the primary reason I subscribed to the MHZ Choice streaming channel, though I *will* be buying the DVD sets as they're released.",1451433600,27,1007,4.6

5011752,5,B006OVPPHM,"I have been watching Seasons 1 and 2 streamed on MHz Choice and am seriously considering buying the DVD's as they are issued.  (So far 6 seasons have been shown in France.)  I had a little trouble getting interested in the first episode of Season 1...after I watched it a second time the characters and their relationships finally started to make sense and I have binged on every episode since.  Nothing is sacred in this phenomenal series about the inhabitants of a small village in France from the time of the invasion by the Wehrmacht in June 1940 to VE Day.  Every character is a complex mix of cowardice and heroism.  No one group, from the elite wealthy villagers through the German soldiers down to the lowliest sharecropping farmers, is painted with a broad brush.  The series is accompanied by short 5 minute documentaries by a French historian and survivors of the war years about different aspects of life in those years, including the difficulty in finding food, the influence of the communists in the resistance movement, antisemitism in French culture, and the black market, to name a few.  I rarely give any book, movie, or series 5 stars.
