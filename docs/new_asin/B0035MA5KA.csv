4071124,5,B0035MA5KA,We are so glad that there is finally a way to view these in the United Stated (other than YouTube).  These are the best  supplement  for our homeschool history curriculum.,1349481600,10,171,4.633333333333334
4071125,5,B0035MA5KA,"We first saw ""Horrible Histories"" on the BBC when we were on vacation in Spain this past summer.  My kids were ENTHRALLED by the gory but funny stories and truthfully, so were we! British humor at its best and unlike anything on US television.  So glad it's available for viewing here.",1347926400,5,285,4.568627450980392
4071126,5,B0035MA5KA,"Hi!  I'm a shouty man!  And I'm here to tell you about new Horrible Histories!

This is the funniest thing I've seen in ages.  For those unfamiliar with it, Horrible Histories is a comedy sketch show which explores the vile side of history with plenty of gore, poo and wee thrown in (often literally).  It's ostensibly aimed at children, but it's even funnier for adults.  Most of it's true, as unbelievable as it may seem, and the host, a talking rat puppet with his own sense of humour, is always on hand to point out what's not.

The show is divided into segments based on different historical periods - like Rotten Romans, Terrible Tudors and Woeful Second World War - and has a combination of actors and short animations.  The show is British, so a lot of the material is focused there, but it goes further afield as well.  The sketches are frequently based on things you might see on TV, such as news reports, reality TV shows and advertisements, and there's a song in each episode.  Though the material covered can be truly vile, the show's so light-hearted, and the actors have such talent and charm, that you laugh even when you're wincing (or trying not to throw up!).

There are so many good moments in this 13-episode series that it's really hard to pick my highlights, but here are some:

1) Historical Wife Swap - Mrs Athens is appalled that Mr Sparta expects her to hunt something for dinner; the puritan Mrs Fight-the-good-fight-of-faith Miserable refuses to join in the fun of Mr John Merry's lifestyle in the reign of Charles II; and the Georgian Lord of the Manor dons gloves and pegs his nose to welcome Mrs Peasant.

2) Bob Hale's reports on HH News - hyperactive, CNN-style Stone Age Report, Roman Report and British Empire Report, complete with animations, helicopters and hamsters.

3) The myth of Zeus' birth, told in daytime talkshow format as the audience boos and surprise guests are revealed.

4) Stupid Deaths - the recently deceased tell Death the story of their demise.  If it's funny enough, they're through to the afterlife.

5) Roll-call in a Vile Victorian school with real Victorian names.  Would you like to go through life called Minty Badger or Princess Cheese?

6) Born 2 Rule - England's four King Georges sing in boyband style (""I broke records with my sixty-year reign .""  ""And I broke the scales with my giant frame.""  ""We were born to rule over you ..."")

Good times.",1327363200,7,2413,4.668246445497631
4071127,4,B0035MA5KA,"I was introduced to Horrible Histories by songs on YouTube, and I wasn't sure when I bought this if the skits could be as good as I was expecting.  However, aside from the immaturity factor, we love this series!  We go around now making reference to it all the time!  It's good for everyone from 10-adult!",1325548800,,305,4.410714285714286
4071128,5,B0035MA5KA,"I bought this for my 10 year old son.  He's been reading the books and has enjoyed the videos tremendously.  We watch them on the PC using VLC Player (which is free and doesn't care about the region stuff).  If you like the books, you'll probably like the DVD.",1312329600,6,260,4.26530612244898
4071129,5,B0035MA5KA,"This Program is fantastic with wonderful actors that bring to life the scripts that are hilarious.  It something that the whole family will enjoy.  I love BBC show and this one they hit it out of the park.

Downside the DVD is not region 1 (US) so if you buy you will need a multi-regional DVD Player.",1311379200,2,301,4.245614035087719
4071130,5,B0035MA5KA,"We saw this series on a return visit to the UK, and had to have it!!  We even invested in a multi-regional DVD player in order to watch it in the USA.
The BBC team which produced this programme have just excelled, the visual presentation is top notch with great costumes and sets, the scripts are laugh out loud funny bringing modern day touches to ancient and not so ancient events.  It's entertaining the adults in the family down to our ten year old.
Job well done  BEEB!",1301270400,,474,4.363636363636363
4071151,5,B0035MA5KA,"This show is hilarious! It's like kid-appropriate Monty Python, mets history facts. My whole family loves this show! I just wish Terry Dreary had TV series for Murderous Maths, Horrible Science, and all the rest.",1467504000,,212,5.085714285714285

4071156,5,B0035MA5KA,"The TV Shows come with a very British perspective - but make history a lot of fun.  I watched a few clips on youtube and then decided to commit and purchase some on Amazon to share with my nephews and nieces when they come to visit.  Educational, funny- a little crude (But so is history).  If talking about the ways we use to deal with waste gets kids more interested in history - then all the better.  The effects get a little better as the seasons progress, and there can be fun songs to help engage kids.  It is all done through short skits moderated by a talking rat puppet. I encourage you to check out an episode and see if it might be right for your kids (or even yourself).

4071189,5,B0035MA5KA,We absolutely love Horrible Histories. The Amazon download is really the best option for those of us across the pond in the US. We homeschool in our family and got started with HH as a history supplement. The skits are hilarious and the writers have done a great job with their history research compared to other programs. It's impossible to have every fact 100% correct for any venue but HH does do a better job than most programs on the history channel and actually holds a child's interest. My daughter asks to watch the videos for fun outside of school work.,1414627200,4,562,4.574257425742574
4071190,5,B0035MA5KA,Funny and sometimes crude but accurate historical shorts. Parents should preview first.,1414540800,,87,6.333333333333333

4071203,5,B0035MA5KA,"This may be one of the most bizzare yet comical shows I have ever watched. It's the dirty, unfiltered side of history - but for kids. The tone is perfect - it's funny enough to hold kids' interest about history and yet still teaches enough to make it worthwhile to watch.  The actors clearly are playing to their audience -- you are going to find very few (if any) inside jokes or references that only adults would get. Instead, you get thoroughly good historical entertainment that isn't afraid to pull punches, with a good dose of scatological satire thrown in for good measure, cause if there's one thing that kids love, it's a good poop joke!",1412294400,5,646,4.568965517241379
4071204,5,B0035MA5KA,Clearly one of the best history education shows ever made to date.,1409443200,,66,4.583333333333333
4071205,5,B0035MA5KA,"I love Horrible Histories!  It is my 9 year old nephew's favorite and I watched it with him in the UK.  I was excited to find it here and bought the whole season and have been enjoying watching it before bed.  Songs are great, but probably don't watch it while eating.",1387497600,3,268,4.215686274509804
4071206,5,B0035MA5KA,I love that it makes history fun.  I used it on our computer with an DVD drive that hadn't been altered like the new ones.  We used a program as a previous reviewer mentioned and I can watch different regions.  We were prepared if it didn't to buy one region free DVD player off ebay if it didn't.,1386892800,2,297,4.086206896551724
4071207,1,B0035MA5KA,I don't see how anyone could prefer this t.v. series to the books.  It only took one episode for me to stay away from this series altogether.,1375747200,,141,4.222222222222222
4071208,4,B0035MA5KA,it's irreverent and witty and totally enjoyable.  I crave these quick fixes on esoteric facts that are always kept from our history books.,1372204800,,138,5.0

8389150,5,B0035MA5KA,"Funny, disgusting, shocking...and hugely entertaining for kids and adults.  A super way to learn AND REMEMBER history and historical figures.  It's slanted toward British history, which is not a bad thing. Lots of toilet humor.  After all, history was not that clean. At least, not by our standards.  Historical habits and rituals can be incredibly vile.  Be ready to gag a lot at some of the puns and retellings.",1502150400,,413,4.927536231884058
