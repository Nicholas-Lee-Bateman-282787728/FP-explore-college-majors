2711574,5,B000LP5FXG,"This show's a decent way to pass the time.  Lots of action and explosions, little to no touchy feely stuff. Definitely for the action anime buffs.",1188172800,,146,4.615384615384615
2711575,5,B000LP5FXG,"Burst Angel is about a group of 4 'outlaws' living in future day Japan, where the common person can carry a gun and is even allowed to use it. It is up to the team of 4 'Angels' to keep the peace and unrail the corruption taking place in Tokyo. From watching the entire series, the story focuses on Jo (a 17 year old girl who has forgotten her past and armed with only her name and fighting skills) and Sei (19 year old heir to her families Bai-Lan organization and leader of the 4 girls) while at the same time involving the other chars of Meg (15 year old orphan who saved Jo and joined Sei's team) and Amy (the 11 year old hacker genious). So long story short, it focuses on two chars while at the same time involving the other chars as an essential parts.

The character designs aren't what I am used to watching but I have to say that the anime designs were great. From long haired to short haired,  shapes and sizes, every character was excellently designed. Each character also had their own figures of speech and dialect I guess you could say. Jo with the short answers, Meg with the American slang, Amy is childish when not involving computers, and Sei as the mature calm one. Gonzo and FUNimation did an excellent job on the angels I must say.

Music in the series wasn't the best I had heard but then again it did fit the purpose. Some points I found myself bobbin' my head alittle bit to the beats. I noticed that another reviewer had said that the music kept chainging from a 'western' style to a techno like style and that they kept getting confused (or something along those lines). I personally did not have this problem, I thought that the music was actually pretty consistant.

The extra features in the series has got to be mentioned. I can't go through all of them but the one thing that stood out to me were the episode commentaries. These were HILARIOUS because of people like Monica (Jo) and the others who participated in the project were always having a good time and making jokes about one another. I was laughing so hard I watched all of them over again! The box set also comes with guidebooks for the each of the disks, which can help greatly with undersatnding what is going on in the series.

The series did have some bad spots but not many. The 'bads' being that the series left some things unanswered. The series also is built for non-linear (people able to look back and say 'ah ok so thats why this was shown and that happened) thinkers. If you are a linear thinker (a person who has to have everything put out there and not able to look back), you might have some problems following the series.

This can either be good or bad depending on how you look at anime. The angels are sexually dressed, I guess would be the best way to put it. Meg has more undergarment shots than the rest and Jo just doesn't wear much in general. There is also an episode where it is clear as day, called the 'Swim-suit Episode' by all who watch the set.

Stick with the ratings if your getting this set for someone. Like I said, the series does contain 'sexy' shots and does contain alot of killing and blood, not as much as other series, but a fair amount none the less. Other than that this series kicks a** and takes names! I love the Angels!",1186444800,6,3259,4.332786885245902
2711576,5,B000LP5FXG,"Burst Angel takes place in a future tokyo where there is a lot of crime because of this there was a law placed letting civilians walk around with guns. the main characters are a group of mercenaries consisting of 4 girls: there is Jo the 17 year old silver haired girl she has some super human ablilities and comands a Mech called Jango. then there is Meg the 15 year old redhead she has a close connection to Jo (The only thing she is really good at is getting kidnaped). Then there is sei the 19 year old leader of the group and she really does not do anything but give the missions she recruits a cook to well cook for them. Then finally there is Amy the 11 year old computer wiz, she is an awesome hacker.

Burst Angel's fight scenes are total EYE CANDY there is not just Mech fighting there is also a lot of gun play involved it and it has it's share of funny moments and Drama.",1186185600,,883,4.133720930232558
2711577,4,B000LP5FXG,"Burst Angel got 4 stars from me. Why? Well for a couple of reason. Before I begin a warning, this show is not for the young. There is a lot of fan fair and I mean every few minutes, though usually nothing more then a slight pantie shot or something. Then there is also truly grotesque imagery that could disturb a young audience.

Now then to the review, first the positive. The character designs, appearance wise, are excellently done. Everybody is rather atractive and a lot of detail was given to each characters appearance. The voice acting was also on the good side, though as usual the English dub left a good deal to be desired. The mech. designs were also excellently done, though they weren't on the realistic side of things. The animation and art work were top notch everything was very fluid and pretty. The choreography was also well done especially near the end. The plot was also well done, subtle and suspenseful which is always a good thing. That's it for the positive stuff.

Now then to the bad, which is pretty much everything else. The characters though likable were shallow, I never once felt attached to any of the characters. Nor do you learn anything about them beyond the surface stuff. This is especially a shame as the characters were begging to go into more detail. Another glitch was not until you're 3/4th threw the series do you realize whom is actually the main character. Also they start out by describing the main character as an outlaw then half way threw start trying to depict it as an angle. Needless to say such a server change just didn't work right. Lastly on characters while I do highly respect their gender reversal from the typical usual standard I think it would have been more effective, given where they ultimately went with it, if they had done it completely rather then only half in order to lure fan boys by lesbians. The next bad thing was the music, it felt completely out of place. Half the time the music was cowboy movie music the other cyber anime rap/rock stuff. I had a great and deep desire to grab the music director and shake him and yell at him to make up his mind already. Next was the shows attempt to have the main world to be betrayed as a lawless place full of brutal criminals and worse law enforcement. However in a few episodes from the start the series falls completely flat leaving you wondering how was it any more dangerous then a normal city. Even at the end with the exception of a few times the cops act normal. Next was the fluff, I can usually forgive a little fluff in most series but there was absolutely no need for it in this series as the time could have been used much better. Lastly and worst, at least to me, was the ending. It wasn't bad so much as it left you with the feeling of, ""Huh? That's it?"", that is the only way I can describe it. You were left staring at the screen scratching your head thinking there had to be more then that. In the end Burst Angle had everything it needed to become a truly legendary series with the exception of the most important thing, a skilled writer that could have fixed and over came the amateur-istic mistakes in character designs and plot made threw out the series.

In the end Burst Angel is one of those series that had promise and only partial lived up to it. This said there are better choices to spend you're money on. If you want fan fair with decent plot go buy Ikki Toushen or Mouse. If you want political intrigue based plot line with awesome giant robot fight go buy Gundam Wing. If you want a dark gritty show buy Elfin Lied. If you have all these and can buy Burst Angles for about $50 dollars do so, if not then you're not missing anything all that special.

Now then for the actual box set review. The six discs come in one of those cardboard all in one holding cases with the booklets held in a separate slim cardboard sheath both of which are held in a even bigger box. The is rather sturdy and is covered in nice artworks and is quiet nice too look at. The problem with the box set that everything is made to exact measurements. Sounds like common sense right, not really. For example I've only removed the booklets from their sheath twice and already the things falling apart dew to the difficulty of trying to get booklets back in their case. This wouldn't be a big problem except the box can't be stack with other DVDs unless it had the support of the booklets sheath, with the booklets in it. Still it's a very nice pretty box set just don't expect it to stay in top quality for very long.",1185494400,12,4540,4.394768133174792

2711615,2,B000LP5FXG,"Burst Angel is titled correctly.  The narrative is centered on a group of fem fatales' whose primary function is to burst from their garments.  Their other qualities and motivations come second.  This show is packed with many attributes that should work, but all fall short, delivering a blindingly bright yet ultimately dull product.

The pros and cons are one in the same, so I'll approach it as such:

- The setting is in a dystopian future Tokyo.  While that's never a fresh concept, it's still a great platform for telling stories.  They set the tone in the first episode by showing lawlessness, violence in the streets, and mech-wielding criminals.  As later stories emerge, the cast of heroines investigate a rich all-girls-school, attend family outings on wealth engorged dragon yachts, and attend culinary schools.  The hard boiled landscape they tried to create disappears to a memory.

- The character designs are cool, sexy, and unique enough to look great on a cover.  Yet the animation is subpar, so they look washed out and flat in the show.  Detail is removed from them, and choppy, 3 frame movements steal whatever cinematography is being attempted.

- Computer animation is used heavily on the robots, so that saves the mech battles from being as poorly animated as the characters.  The only problem is that this show was made before anime learned how to integrate CG effects properly, so it's also jarring and poorly done.

- The characters are somewhat interesting, but don't venture far from classic anime archetypes.  The main female character is very boyish, which lends to the show championing a Yuri (girl on girl) love tale.  I read other reviews on this and other anime where the Yuri aspect is the center of gripes, but I've found that emphasis comes from younger crowds who simple don't want their sexy heroines removed from the heterosexual palette, denying the possibility of them living vicariously through the male characters romantic exploits.  The Yuri aspect of Burst Angel is taxing in dialogue only, but is actually one of the only unique and interesting parts of the show.

- The music is a mix between grunge rock and twangy western like they were trying to inject a ""Trigun"" feel to it, but instead, the two styles clash quickly and the shows' soundtrack is rendered clunky and ineffective.

- The only male character is the mercenary groups cook, and provides little comedic relief while he tries to fend off the advances of the pixie girl character ensuring the show doesn't avoid the classic Lolita angle.  He is mildly entertaining but suffers from extreme castration and as a result curtsies to the back of the show.

All in all, Burst Angel provides a format that could be successful to most fans and would be, but it's completely beaten in all categories by 90% of other anime.  It's hard to declare mech fights, battling vixens with jiggly parts, and frequent gun bouts boring, but it is.  This show would be best served as a S.A.V.E. title, providing entertainment to younger crowds who are strapped for cash, but as it's not, I'd warn fans to spend their money elsewhere on higher quality.",1387843200,7,3140,4.870056497175141

2711636,5,B000LP5FXG,"I've loved Burst Angel ever since it came out in English. I collected all the DVDs as they came out years ago. Unfortunately, more than ten people have borrowed every volume of my series, so they've accumulated a LOT of scratches over the years and skip constantly.

I was looking to get the complete set when I came across this. It is not only a Blu-ray set of the entire series (Blu-ray is an amazing plus for me, it looks fantastic!), but it also includes the OVA and specials as well. I love the box and packaging it comes in; it's very space efficient (for someone who already has all the DVDs) and well-made. I couldn't ask for any more from a set.

For those interested in the series, it's futuristic, sexy and a whole lot of badass! It's a futuristic western based around pretty girl bounty hunters. Some people find that they don't like the series, but as long as your aren't too offended by some scantily-clad, big busted women, most people just love it. I've watched the series over and over and over again, and the more you watch it, the more in-depth you realize the story actually goes. The story unfolds more and more as it goes on, so you slowly get the pieces of the real story and what's been happening in New Tokyo.

The characters are great and very well-written, the voice acting is great in both Japanese and English (a rarity in itself), the English writing is amazing and the art may very well be the best part. The style is so unique from any other anime, and the scenery and new world that Gonzo created to go along with this series is one-of-a-kind. This girls have the coolest outfits I've ever seen in an anime, and I just love how main character Jo was designed to look like an angel, from her hair all the way down to the tattoo that appears on her back when she is fighting.

It DOES have a little bit of robot action in it, something I'm usually not too keen on, but it's done so perfectly, I actually like it. Still, most of the action is gun-fighting and it's even got some hand-to-hand combat fighting and girls with superhuman strength. Probably the best part is that most of the main characters are just average people with basic skills, who don't know how to fight at all. It's not just some far-out, unrealistic anime where everybody's a superhero. I think that's what makes me love this anime so much and makes it so easy to relate to the characters.

I only wish there had been a second season made, as good as this one had been.",1338854400,4,2471,4.38646288209607

This is one of those that I really had to refresh my memory a bit to do this review. It's not a bad series but somehow the end left me feelings as if I'd been cheated a bit. Some series put their heros thru hell then they either don't get the break you sort of feel they deserve in the end, or they get really creamed at the end. This was one of them. It's got a lot of action but I felt let down at the end. Still feel it was worth the purchase price however.",1338249600,,609,3.9193548387096775

About the new Classics Line
~~~~~
Funimation has been re-releasing old titles left and right. Between Viridian collection, SAVE editions, and Classics Lines it's easy to see how people could get confused if you didn't keep up with this stuff. To put it simply, this is the same thing as the previous release released under a product line (Classics). The SRP is dropped and the set has a slimmer box. If you have the original, don't worry about buying this. If you didn't buy the original, then buy whichever version is cheapest.

~~~~~
The Anime itself
~~~~~
To be completely honest, this anime is not for everyone. This anime can definitely be enjoyable as long as you know what you're getting into. The story follows four girls who are part of a large organization and perform many missions. That's pretty much it - don't expect some intellectual drama or some deep conspiracy story. This show is almost completely straightforward (maybe with an exception here or there). The story takes place in a future Tokyo where many organizations have developed great technology. And with great technology comes great corruption.

The four girls are mostly flat and what you see in the beginning is what you get in the end. Amy is a computer wiz who looks like she's 12 years old and acts that way at times. Sei is the leader of the group and is the heir to a powerful syndicate, so she has a strong sense of tradition and duty. Meg is the damsel in distress that really doesn't do much except eat and get captured. Jo is perhaps the most developed character as her full back-story will be revealed. She is an incredible gun-wielding fighter that really only cares about Meg. In my opinion, she's the coolest character in the show and a total BAMF. The sad part is that there was much more potential to develop these characters. Instead we get flat, face-value girls with plenty of fan service as they continue on in their skimpy outfits.

The best part of the show is the action. There are plenty of fights and are fun to watch. Bullets, explosions, and giant mecha robot battles galore. This is the saving aspect of the show. Time and time again, you get to see Meg captured by some bad guys and Jo kick some serious butt.  This anime has some great fighting sequences and memorable moments. I'm sure you'll enjoy watching it as long you approach it as entertainment and not some college thesis that needs to be graded. Entertainment is meant to entertain, right?

CONCLUSION: Burst Angel suffers from a mediocre plot with unsteady pacing, one dimensional characters, and an unfitting ending (I won't discuss that as this review is spoilerless). If you can put that aside, Burst Angel is a very fun show to watch for its entertainment value. Take off your critic hat and be entertained - plenty of 'splosions, bullets, fights, giant robots, and fan service headed your way.

English Dub review
~~~
I watched the show twice: first Japanese Dub with English Subs then the English dub. Well, frankly, neither dubbing was spectacular - both had some awkwardness and unfitting voices. The English dub was done ok - Jo's voice was great, Amy and Sei's voices were fine since their one dimensional characters didn't require an extreme amount of voice acting talent, and Meg's was below average. Meg's English VA did all the ""normal"" lines fine, but when she needed to sound surprised or shocked, it jut didn't sound right. Another questionable part of the dub was giving all the people of Osaka a southern accent. Osaka has a dialect different than Tokyo and sometimes is stereotyped as country bumpkins. So, I guess Funimation figured a Southern Accent would be a good equivalent in the USA (many other companies have also dubbed this Kansai accent as a US Southern accent). I suppose it makes sense in a way, but it distorts the cultural significance when stereotypes of a US southern accent are superimposed on the Osaka area.",1311120000,17,4072,4.726760563380282
2711639,5,B000LP5FXG,"Alright, I'll admit it, I like action movies.  I also like giant fighting robots like in Battletech and Mechwarrior.  Based on what others have said, I'm more than likely going to enjoy watching this.  Yes, my foray into Anime continues and I greatly enjoyed this action packed series.  The series began on fairly loose footing, but by the end I was sucked into it.  I won't pretend that Burst Angel is going to revolutionize the industry or even has a wildly new kind of story line, I won't even say it's worth the full five stars, but I think it's a strong 4/4.5 (so I'm rounding up since Amazon doesn't let me rate something in halves).  If you're looking for a really fun anime to watch that's action packed, I would definitely recommend this.  It's not the kind that makes you sit down and question existence or anything profound, although towards the end they do have a bit of that, but for the most part it's pretty straightforward.

Welcome to a future Tokyo that is mostly in shambles.  Citizens can legally carry guns to defend themselves and society has simply degenerated.  The organization RAPT has been called in to ""police"" the city, but their motives are almost anything but dealing out justice.  Instead they look upon the populace as their little area to conduct strange biological/technical experiments.  It feels like there are only four people ready to stand against RAPT and they make up the main team for Burst Angel.  Granted some new friends step into the ring from Osaka as things escalate.

The primary fighter is Jo and her Cybot Jango.  She has a mysterious past, but has a huge purpose and destiny to fulfill.  The series mainly focuses around her character, especially since she basically does all the fighting... and this is an action Anime of course.  Then we have Meg, who was a character I really didn't like at first, and granted she is kind of useless, but I really did end up enjoying her in the end.  Basically she's more there for comic relief and it seems like she's always getting captured.  I really did wish she had some serious fighting skills, like martial arts of something to go with Jo's intense gun wielding prowess.  I smiled with pleasure during the episode when the old guy enhanced her warrior chi; I was hoping she would stay in that mode!  Alas, my wish was not granted, however, she does seem to have a bit of a purpose in performing a lot of reconnaissance missions for the team.  She's also one of the main characters that adds the ""sexiness"" into the show with her practically ""bursting"" out of her clothes, if you will, for an animated person at least.  I did really like the comic relief she provided when interacting between the other characters though.  I tend to like this humor a lot more because it's based around wit rather than solely on slap-stick humor where characters are falling all over the place or what have you.  Although, I have to point out I really didn't get her outfit.  I know she was American, but what's with the cowboy styled outfit?  In her background story she's from New York.  (Yes I know people from New York can dress like that if they choose, but it's hardly a defining element of that region.)  That's really the primary thing that made no sense to me.  The youngest member of the team is Amy.  She's certainly not to be underestimated, because she's actually the computer hacker genius of the group and in a technological charged world of this Tokyo, she's absolutely essential.  She was really funny to watch interact with the others, especially when she gives Meg a hard time!  The final member of this four angel team is Sei, heir to the Bai-Lan organization and basically the source of all their funding.  She's basically the voluptuous organizer behind all their missions that get directed through Bai-Lan.  Now the stage is set for action to start!

The opening episode was sort of loosely put together and I thought the show was going to focus more on the misadventures of Kiyohei, the aspiring pastry chef.  But that was more of a random chance meeting between him and Jo to preface the fact he would be hired as a cook for the girls.  The bizarre thing is he ends up going on a few missions here and there with them.  Considering he's usually afraid of most of those intense situations, I always wondered why... I assume it's for the general comedic factor.  Anyway, there isn't a huge amount of character development, but this is an action film.  You do get into the characters a little more and their backgrounds do get explained for the most part, which I thought was really awesome and interesting.  For example, Jo likes to spend her free time watching a lot of grotesque horror movies, but is otherwise very unemotional about almost everything except when fighting.  Other than that there isn't a huge amount of depth to the characters until you really get to the end with the tragic ending, but it really is a blockbuster ending for sure!  There are a lot of story arcs based on government intrigue and what seems like average missions turns into so much more throughout the series.

I have to say I did enjoy the animation in this.  I really appreciated the character designs a lot, because it didn't rely on overly busty females being put in provocative situations.  Rather Jo is average sized and should be for her role!  I think this was a smart move because you're not going to have a single audience group watching it for that reason.  The Mech's were awesomely designed though, and Jango was one of the coolest.  Granted it's completely unrealistic for robots of that size to pull off some of the martial arts maneuvers Jo does with Jango... but this is animated after all.  All the monsters had a really cool and strange design, at least different from most of the monsters I'm used to viewing.

If you like an action packed anime then I definitely have to recommend this.  It has just enough comic relief throughout the show to make you laugh when it comes up, which made me glad because sometimes these shows can be overly saturated with such things.  The writing does take a serious tone most of the time as the characters try to overcome new obstacles and new missions.  I was also surprised at the low levels of gore, there were some parts that were pretty violent and bloody, but nothing compared to something like Elfen Lied.  The box set is wonderfully designed and comes with six booklets of character overviews.  These include sketches of the characters, some backgrounds, weapons detail or common items the character has.  It was a really awesome addition to the box set and I'm really glad they included that.  So, are you ready to fight with the Angels now?",1215561600,3,6690,4.634664401019541
2711640,5,B000LP5FXG,"It's not often that there's truth in advertising these days...but when it comes to ""Burst Angel"" the reviews hit home. This anime is excellent on all fronts. Visual effects, story, drama, comedy, action, and most importantly...hot chicks in skimpy outfits and big guns. Studio Gonzo really outdid themselves on this series.

Admittedly I was a bit put off to buy this one when I first heard about it but I got the first two discs of the series and was hooked in. However I didn't have the time or money for a long time to purchase the rest of the series. Finally the boxed set came out and I said, ""Ah, why not."" and picked it up. It was WELL worth it.

The box is really nice looking with a metallic sheen that really sells the whole imagery, which is equally complimented by the amazing artwork of Ugetsu Hakua. Inside the box are two smaller boxes, all decorated with more of Hakua's stunning art. One box has all the guide books for each disc that you normally get with the single discs. This is unlike usual boxed sets, in a good way. The discs come in a special 6 disc case which is pretty well designed to not take up the massive space the whole collection would if you just bought the single discs. Each disc has loads of extras and everything you'd expect from a series of its caliber.

My vote: BUY IT!  For any fan of giant robots, sci-fi, westerns, gun slinging on a matrix-esque playing field, and did I mention the hot chicks in skimpy outfits and big guns?",1202601600,,1471,4.397058823529412
2711641,2,B000LP5FXG,"How I wanted to love this show, but I just couldn't, there was something missing from it, and I think the fanservice was tame, too tame, like, there was none to speak of, I gave this show some chances, but I am done with it, I wouldn't buy it, and I stopped renting it, its too bad",1201132800,2,281,3.9473684210526314
2711642,4,B000LP5FXG,"It's a good series with light stories, there were one or two episodes where there are a little more 'fan service' than you'll expect from this series and it actually threw off one of the characters out of well.. 'character'. The animation is good and the 3d robots blend well with the 2d backgrounds and characters.",1200182400,,315,4.642857142857143

Well worth the price for a complete box set. However, I haven't finished watching the whole set, so keep that in mind.",1199750400,,265,4.638297872340425

The little memo book with everyone's profile really helped me understand everyone's persona.  Every episode was action packed with a little eye candy in some!  The ending was a real tear jerker but made me crack a smile otherwise.",1188864000,,323,4.423728813559322
