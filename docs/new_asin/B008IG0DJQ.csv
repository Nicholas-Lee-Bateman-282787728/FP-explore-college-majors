5167637,5,B008IG0DJQ,Wonderful family movie! We really enjoyed seeing Melissa Gilbert in a good Christmas show. Would recommend this movie to anyone wanting to see a nice Christmas movie.,1354579200,,166,5.185185185185185
5167638,5,B008IG0DJQ,What is not to like about this movie. I enjoyed the characters playing out this story. Sit down with your family - and enjoy a bowl of popcorn while you take in the theme.,1354060800,,171,4.0588235294117645
5167639,5,B008IG0DJQ,"What are the Holidays without a poignant Melissa Gilbert movie?  We love her, and she delivers once again with this familiar Christmas tale of finding what's truly important in life.

Gilbert's character is a Broadway director with all the right stuff to succeed but floundering because of personality problems.  She pursues her profession without regard to anything else.  Now, because no one wants to hire her, her agent forces her to take a menial job directing a small town Christmas pageant.  Not only that, but her ex-fiance, with a cute daughter, recommended her.

Yes, yes, a thousand times yes, we know where all this is headed; however, such is the nature of these family friendly, part romantic comedy, part mushy drama, with endearing oddball characters, small town folksiness, overly sentimental, but gotta love them anyway, type flicks.

It's well filmed and acted for the genre.  Pot-bellied Edward Herrmann plays a jolly innkeeper. The story's fine and fun.  The cons: There's too much sappy music throughout- after a while we just toned it out, and characters are somewhat stereotyped and one dimensional.  May I also say, it's not as good as ""A Holiday for Love""- which is one of our favorite Gilbert and Holiday movies.

I'm saying all this to be as critical as possible so you know what you're in for.  If you hate predictablity and goofy, gooey stories- seek other forms of entertainment.  We're suckers for it, and for our family movie night, it's right on the money for all ages.  For that and Melissa Gilbert, 4 1/2 stars.",1353369600,16,1546,4.8961538461538465
5167640,3,B008IG0DJQ,"Every since Little House on the prairie, I have always supported her movies.  This one is a little weak, but a nice story line.  Worth the purchase, will be keeping, but not one of my favorites.  Family freindly.",1353110400,,212,4.526315789473684
5167641,4,B008IG0DJQ,"Good family movie.  A little schmoozey at times, but who doesn't want a little schmooze at Christmas time? My kids and I enjoyed it.",1352851200,,132,4.5
5167642,5,B008IG0DJQ,A very nice story about multiple characters and their challanges in a close village near a big busy city that shows people dealing with their own situations. You feel good about their growth and how they get to know one another better while helping each do better and recognize what is important in life. Highly recommended - - - for a Christmas movie.,1352505600,,352,4.603174603174603
5167643,4,B008IG0DJQ,"Okay, so this movie was enjoyable and fun in a corny kind of way.  I bought it on a whim and I will watch it again.  Not reality, but good none the less. Glad that we added it to our Christmas collection.",1351209600,15,204,3.8333333333333335
5167644,4,B008IG0DJQ,"Vera is a diva director who gets fired from her third job in one year in the opening scenes of this movie. When all else fails, her manager (played well by veteran singer Steve Lawrence), lands her a job as director of a Christmas pageant in a small town. Shortly after arriving she encounters her former boyfriend, Jack, in the local coffee shop, which he owns. After her first disastrous meeting with her cast of characters (and you can apply that in two ways), she packs back up and calls a taxi to come get her so that she can catch a train back to New York. But with encouragement from the perceptive owner of the B&B where she was lodging, she remains.
She alienates herself from some of the townspeople by her desire to change things and endears herself to others by bringing out their hidden talents. And along the way she is enchanted by Jack's young daughter (who is charming) and her heart is touched by the genuine warmth and acceptance of the community.
*Spoiler Alert*
Then her manager calls with a too-good-to-be-true offer to direct back in New York--starting in two days. Vera is torn, but feels like she would be crazy to turn down such a career opportunity. Much to the disappointment of her cast, Jack and his daughter, she returns to New York. But this is a feel-good Christmas movie, so you know there is a happy ending.
This is basically a family-friendly movie. I caught one use of the Lord's name in vain. There were no illicit relationships, no crude language, nothing suggestive. I like Mailhouse and Gilbert and this was a heartwarming little holiday flick.",1349222400,89,1585,4.624113475177305
5167665,4,B008IG0DJQ,"A good movie, but not as good as Melissa Gilbert in Holiday for Lovers.",1483747200,,71,4.142857142857143
5167666,3,B008IG0DJQ,It wasn't bad but it wasn't the greatest Christmas movie out there.  I loved Ed Herrmann - he is always a wonderful actor.  Storyline was okay and the little girl is a scene stealer so it wasn't a complete loss.  Might not watch it again though.  There are other Christmas movies so much better available.,1482451200,,305,4.490909090909091

5167669,5,B008IG0DJQ,"The movie was a wonderful family old town Christmas with the Nativity as the theme for the Pageant. I really like Robert Mailhouse I have several movies with him in it. Melissa Gilbert's performance was as usual good also. However, she would have been better of in her appearance if she would have had the breast implants removed before filming the movie in stead of after. She looked like she would fall forward. She should also not have had the Botox injections in her lips. Her exaggerated mouth movements were very in becoming. I went back and viewed other movies I have of her and she did not have big lips which were very unbecoming. Otherwise I recommend the movie to anyone especially as family entertainment.",1478044800,,717,4.698412698412699

5167703,4,B008IG0DJQ,"A persnickety director (Melissa Gilbert as Vera Parks) is fired after attacking a writer, causing his downfall.  After that, no one wants to hire her.  Shes forced to take up residence in a podunk town in the middle of nowhere and direct a traditional Christmas pageant for the local yokels.  She was hired by an ex-boyfriend (Robert Mailhouse as Jack Harmon) wanting to reconnect.  Naturally, she feels too high and mighty for the job.  Shes snotty and snide and needs a good comeuppance.  The townsfolk give her all that and more.

I suppose it did have a measure of Christmas cheer but you had to dig for it.  The plot relied too heavily on stereotypes and contrivances guaranteed to elicit the expected response from people wanting to feel all warm and fuzzy for the holidays.  If you enjoy being manipulated in this fashion, then this is as good a choice as any to watch.",1449360000,,876,4.636363636363637

She hates the idea but has little choice in the matter because she can't get a job in New York City anymore.
  If you like Christmas romances with a somewhat different story line and characters who are little different -- if you like a little variety in your holiday fare -- you might like this one.  I found it entertaining and at times downright delightful.",1418601600,,537,4.448979591836735

5167893,5,B008IG0DJQ,"I enjoyed this movie, which stars Melissa Gilbert, when I first saw it. At Christmas, it is hard to find on cable, and was happy to find it here at Amazon. I wanted to be able to watch it each Christmas. Melissa is a director with an attitude, and after losing her job, finds being employment difficult, because of her reputation of being difficult to work with by fellow actors. A boyfriend from the past, in her small town, secretly suggests that the town get her to direct their Christmas Pageant, and they bring her to town. He still loves her, and the question is whether or not that spark can be found again. Yes, I'm sure you can predict the ending- and it is a cute move, and just what I like to see at Christmas.

5167937,5,B008IG0DJQ,A good wholesome film for the whole family to enjoy. A real heart-string tugger that makes you miss that small town feel and that big welcome feeling. A total must see for the holiday season.,1386374400,,191,4.485714285714286
5167938,3,B008IG0DJQ,"Oh, right, that old gripe. The one where you sulk because there's no original programming anymore, nothing new on Earth anymore when it comes to plot lines. This applies exceedingly well to holiday pictures. The plot is familiar, the sentiment borders on cloying. The hope lies in the execution and on the likability of the cast. Once upon a time, Melissa Gilbert was a likable child in Little House on the Prairie. That jarring swerve I felt when I saw her in The Christmas Pageant, seeing her all grown up and playing a nasty-tempered Broadway director, is why I stuck around.

Vera Parks (Gilbert) just got her third sacking of the year, this time for inadvertently pushing the playwright during a dispute. Vera refers to herself as ""abrasive"" and ""dictatorial,"" whereas her friend would rather dish out more damning adjectives (such as ""opinionated"" and ""insulting""). But Vera gets another crack at employment when she's hired to direct a small-town theatre production of a holiday pageant. Off she goes to Ashton Falls in upstate New York, dreading that this town would prove so provincial it probably won't have peppermint tea, her sip of choice.

She meets the Ashton Falls City Players and she isn't impressed. She's also not taken with the cramped chamber in which they'll be rehearsing AND holding the play. But at least the town has peppermint tea.

There's an old tradition that dates back to 1893, Vera is told (and you can see her trying hard not to roll her eyes). In 1893, President Grover Cleveland was scheduled to pass thru Ashton Falls the week before Christmas and so the town organized a Christmas pageant in his honor. Except that the President ran behind schedule and so his train never did stop (he did wave at the good citizens, though). Anyway, there's been an annual Christmas pageant since.

In Ashton Falls, Vera unexpectedly runs into an old flame, this guy Jack Harmon (Robert Mailhouse), now a widower and father to Kristen, a little girl with whom Vera forms an immediate bond. And those are the principals in terms of characters and narrative. I guess I could mention that one grouse in the theatre troupe, her what's a stickler for tradition and always undermining Vera's efforts to spruce up the production. We anticipate Vera's settling in and, as always goes with these kinds of movies, learning that she's actually content in Ashton Falls. And then there's that thing that comes up to provide that one final dramatic conflict.

I rate this a better-than-average 3 out of 5 stars. 2011's The Christmas Pageant is oh-so-predictable, but so what? Them rubes from Ashton Falls are so over-the-top corny, but so what? The cast is amiable. The story is sweetly told. It's the holidays, yo! And it's fun to eyeball Melissa Gilbert in (for me, anyway) unfamiliar territory. She handles the comedic moments just fine, even the farcical bits just fine. And Lennon Wynn - the little girl who plays Kristen - is very charming, and you can see why even someone as demanding and temperamental as Vera would thaw in her presence. Theirs is the relationship to savor. The romance between Vera and Kristen's dad is strictly of the ho-hum persuasion. So, yeah, The Christmas Pageant, look into it. It's a diverting enough slice of holiday hokum. There are even snicker doodles.",1385769600,,3299,4.873440285204991

5167981,1,B008IG0DJQ,"Oh how I wish I had listened to you Mrs. Chocolate, before I bought this piece of shlock. I too grew up watching Melissa Gilbert and have enjoyed her performances. I also own another Christmas movie she starred in, which I like, called ""A Holiday for Love"". However, ""The Christmas Pageant"" is a HUGE disappointment. The word that comes to mind is BORING and my expectations for Christmas movies isn't very high. I own at least 80 christmas movies....yes I love them. But this movie was a waste of my money, for all the reasons you described and more. The plot was contrived and predictable but that was not the death nail. Mostly, the character development was so underdeveloped I just didn't care about the main character...and neither did my companions watching the movie. The movie centered more on the trial and tribulations of directors and/or actors.  A Christmas message or even the relationship between her and single Dad seemed to be an after thought. If you are either a director or actor you might like the movie, but on second thought, I am sure you would prefer to spend your time watching something of value. I agree with you Mrs. Chocolate. I advise watching ""A Child's Christmas in Wales"" or for GOOD cheesy love stories try, ""Christmas Romance"", ""Christmas in the Clouds"", ""The Christmas Card"", Fallen Angel"", "" If You Believe"", ""The Holiday""....so many to choose from.

5168004,2,B008IG0DJQ,"I grew up watching Melissa Gilbert and was interested to see her as an adult, but this movie was a disappointment.  This movie had a lot of promise---the plot was predictable---and could have been carried off well, but it was just too overdone in many ways.  The small town people were embarrassingly corny instead of simple.  The character development was stiff and too sudden in several situations.  There were an over abundance of Christmas decorations to the point of feeling like you stumbled upon the clearance aisle at Walmart.  The big city girl was too much lip gloss and put on attitude.  The costumes of two of the women in the last major scene were completely out of place for a small town.  Even a big city girl with a major attitude would have felt awkward in the dress Melissa Gilbert wore.  Like I said, the plot could have been carried off sensitively and been an enjoyable.

Try instead ""A Child's Christmas in Wales"", ""Silent Night"" with Linda Hamilton when it becomes available, ""The Christmas Miracle of Jonathan Toomey"" if you want a movies you will watch year after year.",1354579200,9,1094,4.71578947368421
