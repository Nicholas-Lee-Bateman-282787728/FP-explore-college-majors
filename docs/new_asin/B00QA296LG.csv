8690957,3,B00QA296LG,"This film is not as good as ""UN DIOS PROHIBIDO'', is of a similar theme.
About horrible events that happened during the Spanish civil war and that not occurred precisely in the field of battle.
The performances are not very good, the directing and the editing either. The soundtrack is beautiful and emotive.
It's a very low budget film that is seen.
Although it has quite a few negative points, I recommend it to know a little more about Spanish history.",1431820800,,455,4.62962962962963
