546348,5,630305725X,This movie was very good because it gave me a full picture of the Normandy Invasion.  I have studied it before on my own (I am 8) and I recommend it for children who are interested in why the allies won the war.  My favorite  actor was Robert Mitchum.,918172800,,251,4.081632653061225
546349,5,630305725X,"Having recently spent 4 weeks holidaying in Normandy and retracing the events, and visiting the sites of the D-day landings I could hardly wait to get home and look at this video. I was not dissappointed. It matched very  well all of my observations at Normandy and my readings while there of the  landings. It was a revalation to me to see the huge role the USA played it  freeing the world from Hitler. This is a great historical learning for our  children. The young people who died, average about 23, deserve the current  23 year olds time out to see this video and reflect on the sacrifices that  have been made for them.",913939200,2,626,4.447368421052632
546350,5,630305725X,"Where Saving Private Ryan had no redeaming value to the efforts of 10 members of the Squad thatwere sent in to retrieve him, The Logest Day redeamed itself in the single line of Robert Mitchum when it was suggested  that they retreat. He said ""there are only 2 types of men on this  beach... those that are dead and those that survive. This movie has  captured the real essence of war. Saving Private Ryan was another Spielberg  exploitation movie of the ""grunt"" soldier just as was ""The  Color Purple"", and ""Schindler's List"". Any condition that  can be exploited; Spielberg will exploit it. PAD",911952000,2,596,4.737864077669903

546447,4,630305725X,"RELEASED IN 1962 and directed by several directors, The Longest Day chronicles the Normandy invasion by the Allies on June 6, 1944, known as D-Day when American, British and Canadian forces boldly landed on five beaches over a fifty-mile stretch.

Whats interesting about this classic war flick is that they used Americans to play Americans, Brits to play Brits, Germans to play Germans and French to play French. In addition, each of the segments was shot by five different directors, including the parachuting episodes.

The all-star cast includes luminaries like John Wayne, Robert Mitchum, Richard Burton, Robert Ryan, Eddie Albert, Henry Fonda, Red Buttons, Sean Connery, Jeffrey Hunter, Steve Forrest and Roddy McDowall. Furthermore, the opening military percussion-oriented score is superlative. The movie saves the compelling invasion of the Normandy beaches for the last act (unlike the mawkish Saving Private Ryan, which starts with it).

Unfortunately, the movie loses points for the B&W photography, which is inexplicable for such an all-star early 60s blockbuster. There are also some hackneyed or awkward parts, like the scene where a ravishing French woman & her bicycle suddenly appear at the railroad tracks by two skeptical German soldiers. Why Sure! Another arguable problem is that the ambitious scope of the film prevents the story from focusing on any one group of notable characters, which make the proceedings seem like a thrilling docudrama rather than a gripping action/drama.

Nonetheless, The Longest Day is a must to catch a glimpse of what it was like on D-Day on several fronts, not to mention you get to see the proverbial big picture.

THE MOVIE RUNS 2 minutes shy of 3 hours; and was shot in France. WRITERS: Cornelius Ryan with additions by several others.

About the Normandy invasion.  Well acted with an all star cast that includes John Wayne, Henry Fonda and Sean Connery among others.  At the time I mainly knew Eddie Albert from Green Acres.  He is I think especially good.  The movie takes you through all the emotions that the people who actually involved must have felt.  Although nothing on film could really make you feel the danger of thinking you could get killed at any second.  Every one should see this movie.  If you are younger and have seen Saving Private Ryan and haven't seen this.  You probably won't think this is as good.  And the filming of the landing probably isn't as realistic.  But in this day and time when everything offends everybody.  This is why we owe our Military so much.  And why we have the freedom to protest anyway.

The Blu-Ray is just another standard black and white version of the Longest day, it IS NOT the color version of the longest day. For the record I enjoy black and white films, but this was one of the few, that turned out to be better with color. The color added a whole new depth to this movie, its hard to describe. Essentially making this movie into Blur-ray was pointless, as Blu-ray players can play regular Dvds. There was already plenty of black and white dvd copies out there.

546594,3,630305725X,"Could have been a great movie but some name actors at the time ruin it. The worst is Peter Lawford who is a British commando of some sort who refuses to don a uniform, preferring a vanilla turtleneck Irish wool sweater of some sort. Red Buttons bad as paratrooper stuck on side of church with silk on chimney. A constipated John Wayne with his stupid cricket clicker breaks his anckle on landing. Ethel Merman would have been more fit than Rod Steiger. Richard Burton,as always, plays an efficient English officer, this time an RAF pilot. Like many WWII movies with Americans back in the old days, most seem to have just got done filming Bowery Boys shorts with Sach and Leo. All seem to be from Brooklyn/the Bronx, Queens none from Tupelo, Mississipi, Greenville, SC or Sioux City, Iowa. The Germans are really confusing. When among themselves, they speak English (Oxford English, not Bronx English, thank God), but when they intermix with French or Americans, they speak actual German. French resistance look very stylish in berets and beatnik cafe attire. Also too many bloody ""let freedom ring"" speeches by each actor like the Yankee soldiers in ""Gettysburg."" Watch ""Kelly's Heros"" instead, filmed in Croatia, not a Hollywood backlot.",1501459200,,1238,4.956730769230769

546644,5,630305725X,"This movie is a good respite from today's world of extreme blood and guts in movies.  The movie shows some of the activities, and tough decisions, especially by Ike, leading up to D-Day as well as the event itself.  Often I watch this movie around June 6th as a reminder what a lot of brave men did for all of us.  Combine this movie with Band of Brothers, Saving Private Ryan, The Pacific and Flags of Our Fathers (all more intense movies) and you have a real perspective on WWII.  It would nice if there was a good movie that dramatized the U.S. Navy's overall WWII effort in the Pacific.

It's good that the British side of things is included, we American's often portray that the Brits were along as observers.  It would have been even better if the contributions of the Canadians were also emphasized.

It's nice to see many of the movie stars, from the period when the movie was made, in the movie.  It truly has an all star cast.",1498521600,4,936,4.369942196531792

546649,4,630305725X,"The events of D-Day and the night before are chronicled in this epic war film written by Cornelius Ryan from his book of the same name. The movie is epic in scale, in scope, and in cast. Even though the events place in little more than 24 hours, the movie ranges from the various UK Allied camps to the various German headquarters in occupied France to the beaches and towns of Normandy. Some of the battle scenes have amazing long tracking shots, showing almost entire towns with fighting in the streets or long stretches of the beach. Visually it is quite impressive.

The cast features over forty named stars with John Wayne, Robert Mitchum, and Richard Burton being the biggest. Many of them are introduced with the cliched zoom in to their backs and then the star turns around. They all do a good job, some better than others (sometimes the performances are hampered by implausibly historically aware comments by the actors, like one or two of the Germans who say, ""This is the most important moment in the war, we can't lose the initiative!""). The wide range of characters allows for many different small stories to be told, like the paratrooper who was hung up on the church tower in Ste Mere Eglise while his unit dropped into the town and was slaughtered by the local Germans, or the British commander who landed with the gliders at Pegasus Bridge and had to hold the bridge until relief came. The D-Day Invasion was probably the most logistically difficult assault in modern history and the detail is impressive and apparent in this film. Also fascinating is the various problems and failures on the German side to react in enough time to stop the invasion.

The movie is an impressive tribute to the men who fought and died during World War II. Recommended!",1496188800,,1768,4.681672025723473

546815,4,630305725X,"(4.5 stars) Not being familiar with the actual events depicted in this movie (and since it's a movie, I'm sure liberties were taken), I have to judge it by a different standard.  Basically, did I enjoy the movie.  The answer to that is, Yes.  I thought they did a great job of moving back and forth between different story lines on both sides of the war and it really made me feel the anguish of having to rush a beach facing enemy gunfire.  Some other points: I found it amusing that God was referenced quite a few times, including people on both sides wondering whose side God is on.  I happen to think there is no creator god -- and especially one who takes sides -- and not sure how someone can believe this after watching a movie like this.  The way so many people were slaughtered points to an uncaring universe (or an uncaring or absentee god if you believe in one).  If there is some kind of godly overseer, it's not involved in our daily lives no matter how much many wish that it were.  Lastly, the ending didn't seem to bring closure to the movie in a way that I felt satisfying after all the carnage that preceded it.  Maybe there was no way to bring closure to such mass destruction of human life.  But there should have been something about whether or not D-Day was worth it, how it affected the rest of the war... some context to what the viewer just watched.  In closing, this was a powerful movie (despite any flaws) about a momentous event in human history.",1485216000,,1475,4.346715328467154

Richard Burton and Roddy McDowall begged to be included out of boredom (they were filming Cleopatra at the time).  They appeared for free.  Everyone else was paid the tidy sum of $25,000.  Except for John Wayne who demanded to be paid $250,000 to get even with Zanuck for a snarky comment he made about Waynes film The Alamo.

Filmed on location in glorious black and white (Jean Bourgoin and Walter Wottitz won the Oscar for best Cinematography).  This is a good example of why war is hell.",1475366400,,636,4.684684684684685

So, technicians went to European museums to photograph World War II gum wrappers and printed reproductions for the film.
.
I wished that it was produced in color. However, the makers wanted to include actual footage from historical films. Since most were black-and-white, the movie was made in that format. A colorized version was available in VCR tape. Some reported that a colorized Japanese DVD also existed.
.
That being said, I wish to critique the quality of the movie in Blu-ray format. In general, there is little difference between the Blu-ray and the DVD versions. Both look the same. In black-and-white format, the textures are there in different shades of gray. The finer details are hard to see, unlike a colored film.

547680,5,630305725X,"The art of movie making inevitable continues to evolve and mostly improves.  Therefore, I think that some older movies need to be appreciated for the artistic efforts that they are.  I agree with another review that I read here, that the scene of Omaha Beach in ""Saving Private Ryan"" was a much more realistic scene than this in ""The Longest Day"".  But I stil greatly enjoyed that part of th movie and the movie as a whole.

The cast itself is one of the greatest casts ever assembled.  One could spend years just studying the lives and artistic careers of the cast.  John Wayne, Robert Mitchum, Henry Fonda, Richard Burton, Shawn Connery, and on and on, holy cow...  I am not a true Hollywood historian, I just play one on Amazon, but I truly cannot name another movie with this number of iconic actors.

The movie is not simply one ongoing story.  Rather it is a series of stories about D Day that progress parallel to each other.  The action shifts from story to story.  It easily holds my attention although it is a long movie.

One of my hobbies is comparing and contrasting movies with the literature upon which they are based.  I recently read the book, The Longest Day.  That is why I again watched the movie and am now writing this review.  As I understand it, Cornelius Ryan, the author participated in the screen play for the movie.  As much as I enjoyed the movie, I liked the book more.  (Yes, I have no life...)

In a sense this is a jingoistic movie, making it seem a lighthearted day at times. I believe this is a cinematic technique, using wry or black humor to diminish the awfulness of that day's carnage. Of course, it made the Germans seem bumbling idiots, and the GIs and Brit soldiers as intuitive geniuses.

548155,5,630305725X,"A great motion picture and one of my fondest childhood moviemaking experiences. That said, I'd like to focus on my last viewing of this classic.
So I'm watching it and playing a memory game of naming every actor as they show up. I begin to realize there's generally three types of acting going on: Method, RADA, and ""Hollywood Star"". Surprisingly, the Duke is coming off most effectively in the pre-invasion scenes. The method actors (Beymor being the most guilty) are overly obsessed with hands all over themselves and cutesy use of props. Whether this is to ""get into character"" or just steal the scene, I don't know. Maybe this is due to big stars in small roles wanting to be sure they stand out. Two examples are Rod Steiger and Mel Ferrar. After Steiger's scene, I only recall his interaction with a coffee mug for some reason. As for Ferrar, he's in a command center scene fidgeting so much, it's just short of Matthew McConnaughy's chest slapping in Wolf of Wall St. I blame the director for this sort of expressiveness. All this really benefits the Hollywood stars like Wayne, Mitchum, and Fonda who come off more natural.
Then there are a few missteps with the star power depth chart. These are three of the most glaring in descending order:
John Wayne's last scenes have lines delivered that must be the basis for all his comic impressionist. He begins to sound like he's more at Ft. Apache not Normandy.
The overreacting dead guy. Spotting the stars can really distract from the drama. When Roddy McDowell flips over the dead guy, all I can do is think, ""Dewey Martin!"" Also, the expression on Mr. Martin's face tells me he was going all out for this tiny cameo.
Finally, in glaringly bad casting, is Roddy McDowall in some poetic rambling as a southern boy out huntin' and fishin' with his dad. You gotta wonder how in tarnation somebody cast him for that. ""Juuuuuuuuune!""
Anyhow, I would still put this movie up against more modern fare such as Saving Private Ryan. Take away the shaky cam and special filters from SPR  and The Longest Day more than holds its own.",1465689600,,2078,4.662125340599455

There were so many stars, they were listed alphabetically, as I have listed them here. The movie chronicles D-Day, from the point of view of the Allied and German forces.

The Longest Day is one of those movies that's just too good not to be watched not just a few times but MANY times.

The cinematography is excellent, directing is spot-on, and the stars provide credible acting of historic men leading the battle. There is humor injected at certain points in the dark moments to show the resiliency of the men in excruciatingly tough circumstances. This is a movie that is a must see for those who want a feel for what it is like to live through waging a battle. One gets the impression that the margin of victory is very small, and the tides shift on little things and war is as much about luck,of the draw as it is planning, and determination and spirit can make the decisive difference in a battle,  as well as the overall war.

It just hangs and locks up the disk in limbo.  You have to eject it and restart.  Furthermore, there is a major blooper in the opening when Field Marshall Rommel is issuing orders to his commanders in front of an ocean backdrop. Right in the middle of his pacing from the right to the left, he vanishes, and all you see is the ocean.  His voice continues and so do the subtitles. Then poof! About five seconds later, he rematerializes in front of the ocean just like Barbara Eden in I Dream of Jeanie.  This isn't a fluke associated with my copy. I played both DVDs in multiple machines and they performed exactly the same. Language Selection menu freezes, and Field Marshall Rommel pulling a Samantha Stevens (Bewitched) thing.

While doing so would make a too-long movie even longer, the movie may have just over-reached.

Overall the story is one of valor and heroics of the average American and British as well as French and Polish  soldiers who perserverd on the beaches of Normandy and got past the Atlantic wall.  The film made the hostile fire minimal when any D Day veteran will tell you the enemy fire was horrendous and almost cost the invasion to turn back.
This was the largest fleet ever assembled and they had minimal ships so, i guess they did not use enough soldiers and sailors to truly depict the size and scope of this invasion.  In the end, this is an enjoyable film but lacks the true hostility all the soldiers encountered on this most heroic day.",1457308800,4,762,4.467625899280575

Consider that most of the stars whose performances made this film what it is are now in Valhalla, along with the military personnel who participated in the actual Longest Day.

It follows a broad selection of soldiers from both sides through the events of June 6, 1944. The only complaint I have about the movie is that, in the style of the time, they use as many of the top movie stars of the era in small roles to act out the events. At the time it was made, this was done in many movies, but by today's standards it looks contrived. Other than that, it is a fantastic film.",1454198400,,572,3.8559322033898304

Andrews Blu-ray Review: Sometimes a great filmmaker's best intentions can be swamped by the dictates of the marketplace. 20th-Century-Fox producer Darryl F. Zanuck hoped that The Longest Day [1962], a blow-by-blow account of the Allied invasion on D-Day, would be an anti-Hollywood war film, a picture that would, once and for all, show audiences what war is really like. But Darryl F. Zanuck, who may well have been viewing the picture as his swan song, knew that an undertaking of this size was a risky business proposition to say the least. So he hedged his bets by casting as many name stars as he could get his hands on, thus nixing any opportunity he may have had to fully immerse viewers in a realistic, documentary portrayal of the events and the ultimate price of victory.

Everyone from John Wayne to Henry Fonda to Robert Mitchum to Eddie Albert gets a few moments of screen time, with teen idols like Paul Anka, Tommy Sands, and Fabian thrown into the mix to attract the younger viewers. Darryl F. Zanuck was operating on such a grand scale; he needed no less than four directors to shoot the film, with numerous assistants working the perimeter. The final product, though often memorable, seems more like an exposition-laced military manoeuvre than an actual narrative. Regardless of what's going on and there's always something going on and it's not hard to imagine Darryl F. Zanuck standing beside the camera, heatedly chomping his cigar while he writes his OSCAR acceptance speech. Much more to Darryl F. Zanuck's liking was a young French actress, Irina Demick, who was one of the few women to appear in a substantial role in the film. Brigitte Bardot and Marina Vlady had originally been approached for the part but turned it down. Irina Demick not only won the role, but also became Darryl F. Zanuck's mistress during the production.

All of the massive organisation of that most salient invasion of World War Two, and all the hardship and bloodiness of it, all the courage and sacrifice involved, are strongly and stalwartly suggested in the mighty mosaic of episodes and battle-action details that are packed into this film. From the climactic concentration of Allied forces along the English coast, ready to launch the invasion in early June, 1944, to a few sample incidents at nightfall on D-Day, June 6, the immensity and sweep of the great battle to crack the Nazi's hold on France are portrayed.

There's the highly suspenseful moment when General Eisenhower has to make the fateful decision as to whether the invasion will go or have to be postponed. There's the nervousness and impatience of officers waiting the word, the restlessness and time-killing pastimes of soldiers poised to go. And then there's the breathless excitement of the Pathfinders being sent by air to parachute into Normandy at midnight to light the way for the following Para troopers; the tension and terror of the airborne strike of Canadians to secure the critical Orne River Pegasus Bridge; the violence and confusion of the experiences of elements of the American 82nd and 101st Airborne Division before dawn around Sainte-Mre-glise.

As daylight comes, there is the thunder of the first landing craft piling in on the fortress-fringed Normandy beaches, the bloody battles along the fire-raked strands of the Utah and Omaha sectors, fought by the Americans, and the assaults upon Sword, June and Gold by the British and Canadians. There's the smashing fight of French commandos to capture the seaside town of Ouistreham and the terrible climb by American Rangers up the sheer cliffs of Point-du-Hoc. And there's a lot about French Resistance people fighting behind the main assaults. Nor are the Germans neglected. Indeed, the picture begins with the cameras glimpsing their activities and anxieties behind the Atlantic Wall. Field Marshal Erwin Rommel is here to state the tension of German uncertainty and to cue in the picture's main title with his famous prediction as to the actual ""the longest day."" And then, all the way through, the bickering and bunglings of the German general, from Gerd von Rundstedt down, are interlarded, historically and dramatically.

No character stands out particularly as more significant or heroic than anyone else. John Wayne is notably rugged as Lt. Col. Benjamin Vandervoort, the dogged officer of the 82d who hobbled through D-Day on a broken ankle, using a rifle as a crutch. Robert Mitchum is tough as General Norman Cota, who led his men of the 29th Division onto Omaha Beach and then off it after a day of deadly pounding by forcing a breach of the Vierville-sur-Mer roadblock. Red Buttons is very effective as paratrooper John Steele, who watched the pitiful slaughter of many of his buddies in the town square of Sainte-Mre- glise while hanging from the church steeple in the harness of his parachute. Richard Beymer does well as a young soldier who wanders dazedly through the whole thing, never connecting with his outfit and never firing a shot. And dozens of other actors are convincing and identifiable in roles that call for infrequent appearances or only single shots in the film.

It's difficult to pinpoint the real ""star"" of The Longest Day film, but Robert Mitchum would have to rank high on the list. As Major General Norman Cota, Sr., of the United States Army, the Allied commander of the Twenty-ninth Infantry Division, he somehow manages to convey the gravity of the situation without coming across like a movie star wearing an Army suit. Many of the other faces are so familiar such as John Wayne, Henry Fonda, and Richard Burton that it's hard to convince yourself that these actors represent real people caught up in earth-shattering events.

Intelligently made, and the picture has been photographed in Black-and-White to give a virtual newsreel authenticity to the vivid, realistic battle-scenes. And the illusory aspect of reality has been achieved in other respects, notably in the use of their own languages by the Germans and the French, with English subtitles appended to translate what they say. The total effect of the picture is that of a huge documentary report, adorned and coloured by personal details that are thrilling, amusing, ironic, and sad. It makes no conclusive observation, other than the obvious one that war is hell and that D-Day was a gallant, costly triumph for the Allied forces, not for any one man. It is not hard to think of a picture, aimed and constructed as this one was, doing any more or any better or leaving one feeling any more exposed to the horror of war than this one does.

This sort of production is always a breeding ground for oddball occurrences and trivia, and The Longest Day is no different. Perhaps it's best to simply list some of the more interesting titbits:

Roddy McDowall only appears in the film because he was in Italy, pulling his hair out over the endless delays on Cleopatra [1963]. He begged Darryl F. Zanuck to cast him in The Longest Day simply because he wanted a chance to actually act for a while!

Richard Todd [Major John Howard] actually fought at Normandy on D-Day while a member of the British Air Force. He entered the fray, as did hundreds of other men, via a highly dangerous parachute drop.

The real-life American soldiers who Darryl F. Zanuck hired to storm Omaha Beach in the picture were reluctant to enter the water because it was too cold, but they finally relented when a disgusted Robert Mitchum jumped in first.

The producers had to make certain that members of a nearby nudist colony didn't wander onto the beach during the ""invasion.""

Sean Connery, who of course, would make his name playing James Bond, and appears in The Longest Day film opposite Gert Frobe and Curd Jurgens, two future James Bond villains.

Dwight D. Eisenhower was interested in playing himself in The Longest Day, but it was determined that he simply looked too old to pull it off! Forget World War Two, several years in the White House will do that to you.

Perhaps the most important piece of information, as far as Darryl F. Zanuck was concerned, was that The Longest Day cost $10,000,000 to make and a totally astronomical amount at the time in 1962. But it earned back every penny, and then some. In Hollywood terms, anyway, that's called winning the battle.

Blu-ray Video Quality  The Longest Day storms onto Blu-ray format with an awesome and impressive Black-and-White 1080p encoded image, with an equally impressive 2.35:1 [Cinemascope] aspect ratio. If this is what classic Black-and-White films, especially War Films are going to look like on Blu-ray, I enthusiastically recommend that the studios bring them on and congratulate 20 the Century Fox for producing something so totally stunning and awesome at the same time. The 1080p image is remarkably sharp with excellent detail on the 2 All Region Blu-ray discs. Even though this is a classic Black-and-White images, there is still excellent separation of shades, and black levels are strikingly solid. There is also some wonderful cinematography in this film; especially with a long, continuous and panning shot of a running gun battle is mesmerising, and one of my favourite parts of this brilliant war films scenes, ever. The downside of the increased Blu-ray clarity is that it's far easier to notice the special effects, such as the placement of these actors, pre-digitally, over a background shot elsewhere at another time and the clarity even benefits the action scenes. Note that the original subtitles were replaced with more aesthetically pleasing text during the remastering process and appear overtop of the image.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  The 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio sound presentation on The Longest Day this Blu-ray disc, is a totally awesome solid one. Surround sounds manage to be in use a good bit of the time, delivering both ambiance and action. They aren't always active, especially in a few spots where we would expect them to be in some scenes. The militaristic, percussion-heavy music sounds wonderfully powerful and engaging, as do the opening credits featuring Beethoven's Fifth symphony. As planes strafe troops or drop bombs during the film's landing sequences about two hours in, you'll feel the impact of the munitions and almost constantly hear echoes and the distant sounds of gunfire and explosions. It's a nice effect, and a chilling one. This lossless soundtrack is obviously the best I've ever heard this film, and easily surpasses the totally inferior DVD disc I owned for some time, but I have now dumped into the total oblivion of ghastly 480i inferior images.

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:

Audio Commentary: Historical Commentary with Mary Corey: This first historical audio commentary with Mary Corey, who is a post-World War II professor of intellectual and cultural history at UCLA. Corey discusses the importance and nuances of the musical cues of the film, points out some historical inaccuracies, like the hair of the bicycle girl at the beginning of the film, and also provides some really fascinating trivia about The Longest day film, where we are informed that at the time in 1962, that it was the most expensive Black-and-White film ever made.

Ken Annakin discusses and informs us the origins of the film, and especially covering much of what is discussed in the other supplement extras, but this track remains totally fascinating to listen to. Ken Annakin has plenty of amusing and interesting stories to inform us, but never allowing us to become totally bored with listening to him speak about The Longest Day film and filling us in some gaps about what input the other co-directors put into making their part in the film, and Ken Annakin also discusses both the German and American actors, but unfortunately does not just focus on Kens segments in the film sadly.

Finally, this I one of the finest Second World War films of all time, and The Longest Day remains a total crowd pleaser and first-rate war epic of all time. It has the combining of intelligence and definitely the thinking man's war film. The Longest Day stands proudly near the top of the list of the all-time greatest war films, and this comes from one of the genre's biggest fans. 20th Century Fox has once again gone above and beyond the call of duty, providing fans a glorious transfer that feels larger than life and looks fantastic, too. The audio quality is a marked improvement over any version I've heard before, and the supplemental materials are exhaustive and interesting. As far as classic Second World War films on Blu-ray go, they don't get a whole lot better than this, and The Longest Day comes with brilliant pedigree and an honour to add this to my Blu-ray Collection and especially it is now in the brilliant designed Limited Edition SteelBook. Highly Recommended!

I'm not a big fan of war movies in general, and certainly not a fan of seeing them more than once, but my history-loving husband insisted that this would be worth it.  With its star-studded cast, bits of humor and fairly accurate depiction of all that happened the day of the Normandy invasion, told from both the Allied and German point of view, it's a truly compelling story and gets to the heart of some of the small serendipitous moments that made this a successful invasion. What if Rommel hadn't gone to Paris to get his wife shoes for her birthday? What if the Allies had decided not to take advantage of that tiny window of reasonable June weather?  What if Hitler hadn't been asleep or the lower-level Nazis had pushed harder to get the attention of their Berlin superiors and get more planes or panzers to the Normandy coast?  The beach invasion itself is heartbreaking to watch, but it's a great story of a key moment in recent western civ history.

choosing to take a young lady on a first date to see it, almost
certainly on reflection an inappropriate film for such an occasion..

Inaccuracies are common with many films telling true stories for many reasons. I was surprised to see that Ike walked out of the movie early on. I am sure many vets who were there felt it was dramatized and the actors were of the wrong ages, etc. Even in the 21st century, a story like ""Band of Brothers"" has inaccuracies. However, ""The Longest Day"" was and still is an extraordinary film.

At the age of 10, I read the book and then when the film appeared, my father dragged my mother and sister along with myself to see it on the big screen. I remember there being an intermission and being anxious for the rest of the film to continue. At the end, as a kid, I was craving for more, as the day had yet to end when we last saw the men and machines moving off Omaha Beach.

Some of the German actors like Kurd Jrgen's was imprisoned by the Nazi's for his anti-Nazi statements, and others fought in the war as members of the German Army.  As the day unfolds we meet various officers and soldiers and some we follow through the day as the battle begins and moves forward.  Some die and some survive the day.

552207,3,630305725X,"I own many black and white movies, (800+).  However, the producers of ""The Longest Day"" did consider shooting in color, but they thought the movie-going public ""couldn't handle it"".  I've seen this movie several times, both in black and white, and in color.  The color version is vastly superior.

Modern colorization is virtually indistinguishable from color done originally.  The correct way to proceed with this movie would be to offer both versions, color, and black and white.  Remember, the actual, real, war, was very much in color.

The movie itself is 5 stars.  If you are after a ""pure"" movie review, I suggest you go to the International Movie Database. There, you will find many movie reviews done without regard to the delivery mechanism.  This review is for the item I received from Amazon.

552208,3,630305725X,"On June 4, 2015, I watched a NOVA program called ""D-Day's Sunken Ships,"" which originally aired on May 28, 2014.  When I realized that the D-Day anniversary was only 2 days away, I decided to watch ""The Longest Day"" to commemorate the event and see how close the movie was to the details described in the documentary.  While the details lined up pretty well, the movie as a movie wasn't that great.  I was the young daughter of a career Marine during the '60s, so I have watched pretty much every WWII movie made during that time frame.  ""The Longest Day"" is one of my least favorite.  The primary problems with the movie are the direction, cinematography and staging.  The film was treated as a stage production, which should be hard to do with a war movie.  Stilted and flat are the two words that some to mind.  As far as the acting is concerned, it is interesting to see the good actors and not-so-good actors side by side.  Acting talent clearly isn't the criteria for how famous some people get.  My personal favorites were Richard Burton, Red Buttons and a pre-Bond Sean Connery, primarily for the twinkle in their eyes.  (For you Star Trek TOS fans, Captain Pike is in it; see if you notice him.)  Finally, I can't believe how the international languages weren't more fully subtitled.  I have no idea how they did releasing this film internationally if they subtitled English as poorly as they did the German and French.  You get the drift of what's being said, but you don't get the depth.  If you want to watch a much better WWII war movie that's based on reality, try ""A Bridge Too Far.""  Or better yet, ""The Great Escape.""",1433548800,,1634,4.525597269624574

552375,2,630305725X,"During the couple of decades after World War II, Hollywood made movies about the war that were really fantasies disguised as histories. Many aspects about World War II are incorrectly portrayed in ""The Longest Day"". First, not all of the German high command were complete idiots. Second, not all the French were in favor of the allied invasion. And last but not least, it was not as easy for soldiers coming from the naval war carriers to hit the beach at Normandie. When it was released, ""The Longest Day"" was probably appropriate for its audiences who were only a stones throw away from the war and probably wanted to see escapist fair. However, 45 years later, the film does not uphold as well against far more realistic depictions of war such as ""Platoon"", ""Saving Private Ryan"", even ""Patton"". Except for a sequence in the latter part of the movie in which the allied forces move inland, much of the movie suffers from too many clichs, too many unrealistic situations, and dialog that has become almost laughable.

If someone who had never been taught anything about World War II were to see this movie, he or she might well believe that all the Americans were heroes, the English were constantly ingenious, the French loved Americans (and maybe the English too), and the Germans were a bunch of nincompoops. The problem may go deeper as this is the portrait that is often painted in US High School text books. The picture on this Hollywood canvas is over the top idealism in both directions.

It's hard to believe, based on this movie, that the Germans were smart enough to get their uniforms on correctly, let alone almost capture Europe. When the Germans learn of the shrewd moves made by the allies, their reactions remind me of the bad guys in the old Batman TV show. Or maybe Colonel Clink in Hogan's Heros. The Germans either blow their tops (I almost expected smoke to start coming out of their ears) or they dismiss what they're hearing. The movie shows a German lookout at the beach becoming frantic, dropping his binoculars at the sight of all the war ships. When he phones the high command, they at first insist that the allies don't even have that many ships before realizing the invasion is on and they go crazy. And the few references to Hitler make him seem more like a spoiled grammar school boy than one of the most feared men in the world. One officer says that the Fhrer is having another one of his tantrums.

The problem is the movie rarely breaks away from its own clich rhetoric. The characters constantly talk about ""making history"" and heroism as if ground soldiers would say such things in the heat of battle. It just gets a little much. While the German high command are insulting each other, the American and British high command are portrayed as much more organized and deliberate in their actions. Robert Mitchum and John Wayne who play the high ranking officers at the ground level seemed like they were plucked out of a novel rather than portraying real people. Every line, every command, and every decision is prophetic. And the men obey their commands as if they came from Moses! And every time the allied forces were about to attack, a high ranking officer always prefaces it with a patriotic speech! Maybe that was a motivation to go and fight so you didn't have to hear another one!

The actual invasion at the beach is probably the weakest and least realistic aspect of the entire film. In reality scores of men were mowed down by gunfire long before they ever got to the beach. Here, about 1 in 50 seems to get hit by gunfire. I guess the Germans just weren't very good shots. Another rather insulting piece of Hollywood melodrama shows a Frenchman becoming overly ecstatic at the appearance of the allied forces at the Normandy beaches. (I guess he couldn't wait to get an autograph from a movie star, considering just about every major Hollywood talent was drafted into this movie, including Richard Burton and Roddy McDowell.) In reality, the attitude toward the invasion was more ambivalent. There were many French who were not thrilled with the allied invasion, but these diversities are never touched upon.

There are some good visuals in the film, and some great shots from above. Overall, a rather mixed movie that has a few moments of interest and a lot of clich silly lines, and parts that are simply bad history. But as the old adage says, the heroes write the history. Or re-write it.",1431734400,2,4441,4.6811779769526245
552376,4,630305725X,"Darryl Zanuck spent vast sums of money to re-create D-Day, and did a fairly formidable job of accurately depicting what John Wayne calls ""the most crucial day of our times.""

Millions of people have seen this flick since 1962, so there probably isn't too much to add -- it makes excellent use of its vast array of stars, many of them still familiar today, to tie together the vast threads of the invasion into a reasonably coherent mass, tightly focusing on June 6, 1944. The star of the movie is not any one actor, even Mr. Wayne: it's the day itself, and the hordes of men and women who fight, endure, survive, or are killed during it.

There are weaknesses and annoyances...John Wayne at age 56 plays a man who was 26...the gore of the day is not re-created at all, because of the movie censorship of the times...except for a pair of paratroopers, the Canadians, who provided an entire division to the invasion, are invisible, while the French, who only provided a battalion and some Resistance fighters, have vast screen time...the British seem to provide mostly comic relief (most of the British actors were comedians, as it happens)...Jim Gavin, as played by Robert Ryan, is far too old for his role (he was 36)...and the map of Normandy behind him is one that was made AFTER the battle, and shows the various arrows that resulted after the briefing Gavin gives...the real Rangers who stormed Pointe de Hoe or Pointe du Hoc (I call it Point Ad Hoc) found the guns some distance away, as they were being brought up to be installed...the American paratroopers jumped from American C-47 Dakotas into Normandy, not British Stirlings.

But for the layman, who is learning about D-Day for the first time, this is a good place to start. It captures many of the realities of the battle, such as the famous glider assault on Pegasus Bridge, the struggle to clear Omaha Beach, the paratroopers in the swamps, and the stunning indecision with which the Germans faced the invasion. That alone should shock most casual students of World War II or movie fans, who are probably used to seeing hawk-faced German officers figure out brilliant moves that annihilate the incompetent (usually British) forces with great speed. In fact, the Germans faced the Normandy invasion with incredible levels of incompetence and indecision, with numerous key German officers (like Rommel) far away from their posts, and others reluctant to make a decision or even wake the Fuehrer.

The fact of the matter on D-Day was that ample bravery, determination, and courage was shown on both sides, but the Allies had more of it. Cornelius Ryan's closing lines in the book upon which this movie is based are absolutely borne out: ""From this day, the Third Reich had less than one year to live.""

The DVD pack also has commentary by a historian on the film and the war, who notes important points about how the film conveys the battle, the British director of the film, who reminisces about his work, and a second DVD with a History Channel documentary comparing the movie with the reality -- real Rangers and paratroopers compare their experiences with those of the film. Mr. Zanuck himself narrates a 1968 documentary about the Normandy battlefields as they appeared at that time -- the tourist industry for those sites was just building up.

Because of the weaknesses of the film on the reality of death and dying on D-Day (Spielberg does it better in ""Saving Private Ryan"") and the slighting to the British and Canadians, I can't give this film five stars. But it remains a classic World War II film, and a must-have for your movie library.",1431475200,7,3611,4.7696

552667,5,630305725X,"Darryl F. Zanuck's THE LONGEST DAY may well be the definitive film of D-Day June 6, 1944. THE LONGEST DAY is probably one of the most ambitious WWII films ever produced. It's all encompassing scope of the invasion and the combatants and both the individual and collective personal stories of some of the combatants is extraordinary and contributes to the overall depiction and sense of calamity and coordination of the Allies on D-Day June 6, 1944. THE LONGEST DAY is based on the book The Longest Day by Cornelius Ryan and in the book the focus is on the people, the combatants as well as civilians. The integration of both the military aspects and the people that were part of and affected is what producer Darryl F. Zanuck was striving for and he achieved this brilliantly bringing the humanity to the forefront. The cast is a strong one and they all seem to give performances of a high order and they all seem rather inspired by the scope of this film. The cast includes John Wayne, Henry Fonda, Robert Mitchum, Richard Burton, Richard Beymer, Stuart Whitman, Sean Connery, Richard Todd, Robert Wagner, Tom Tryon, Eddie Albert, Kenneth More, Gert Frbe, George Segal, Robert Ryan, Wolfgang Preiss, Peter Lawford, Sal Mineo, Curd Jrgens, Edmond O'Brien, Rod Steiger, Irina Demick, Alexander Knox, Jeffrey Hunter, Donald Houston, Steve Forrest, Fabian, Paul Anka, Ray Danton, Red Buttons, Hans Christian Blech, Mel Ferrer, Leo Genn, Fernand Ledoux, Christian Marquand, Norman Rossington, Tommy Sands and Peter van Eyck and many more. There were several directors. Ken Annakin shot most of the British and French exterior episodes, Bernhard Wicki directed the German episodes and Andrew Marton the American exterior shooting. Jean Bourgoin and Walter Wottitz won Academy Awards for Best Cinematography. Robert MacDonald and Jacques Maumont won Academy Awards for Best Special Effects.

I don't know about accuracy, aside from the fact that John Wayne was way too old for his brief role. I read somewhere that Eisenhower walked out of the film after 20 minutes due to the inaccuracies. Hopefully he left before the dismal performance by the actor portraying him. I mean he looked like Ike...but really struggled with the few lines he had to deliver. The highlight of the first half-hour had to be Sophia Loren riding a bicycle in low-cut blouse and a skirt...viewed from the front (if you get my drift). I'm sure I'll watch the rest of the picture again some day, but I'll know what to expect. Good quality B&W version..the best way to view an epic WWII pic, in my opinion.

The plot, the ambitious and multi-talented cast, special effects, dazzling photography are by themselves one of its major virtues, plus the clever dialogues of the high command of both sides -as well as the concerns of the common and single people- are told and recreated from the most objective angle you may expect.

Far from the common places, the movie captures the viewer from the very first sequence, and introduces him ""literally"" into the war-field. Scenes filled of crude realism with astonishing handle camera and superb travellings will blow you away. The historical documentation and support of many personalities who were there, accent still more the grandness of its proposal.

Not to be missed.

552805,5,630305725X,"When this came out in the 1960's, Hollywood had film studios fighting TV and this film, like Ben-Hur and others, was an attempt to make something 'too grand' to be on the little 10 to 18 inch TV screen in black&white.
This film is not 5 stars for any one thing; it's 5 stars because they showed a massive undertaking(D-Day) in a massive way, with truckloads of materiel, aircraft carriers of planes, and busloads of great actors, including John Wayne, Peter Lawford, Richard Burton, Red Buttons, Henry Fonda, Robert Ryan, and Robert Mitchum.  To me, the most interesting scene was Richard Burton's.  You might also note the star of West Side Story in a minor supporting role.
The director during the film had one of the largest air forces in the world at the time.
The plot, as you surmised, is D-day, the Allied invasion of mainland Europe in Normandy, June 6, 1944.  It was the long awaited 2nd front to finish off Germany which had already had devastating defeats in Russia(Stalingrad/Kursk) and North Africa(Tunisia surrender).
John Wayne plays a blood n' guts general, Red Buttons an airborne soldier caught up in the air while landing, Richard Burton an injured Brit, Peter Lawford an officer with the Brits on their beachhead, etc.
Unlike Spielberg's wonderful Saving Private Ryan, this was not a narrow view of D-day beaches.  One might have had the impression that they were a disaster from Saving Private Ryan, but this film(Longest Day) corrects that.  The beaches were a blend of hellish combat(Omaha) and other beaches almost undefended.  It was only a combination of factors that led to the travails at Omaha.
The film shows a sampling of all the beachheads(there were 4) and also the operations inland, mostly airborne--conducted in the dark the night before.
The film had a massive undertaking, showing D-day in perspective, and they achieved most of their aims, just as our brave men and women did on that fateful day...
The greatness of the film was its success in communicating the size and power of the invasion and the drama that inevitably ensued...",1419811200,,2071,4.886039886039886

Saving Private Ryan may have a great opening 20 minutes, but The Longest Day is much more satisfying!  This movie was made by the legendary Darryl Zanuck.  It was shot in glorious Black and White!

I have walked the beaches near Rye in the UK where much of this movie was made.  British beaches look much like Norman ones I suppose.  There are more WW2 vehicles in Britain than anywhere else in the world which is why Band of Brothers was also filmed in the UK and many other WW2 productions.

This is apparently in some ways, the definitive re-enactment of D-Day on World War II.  It was made at a time when many of the commanders who went through it were still alive and able to provide accurate advice on details.  It was after the Nurenberg trials and plenty of opportunity to also hear Germany's experience of the event.  The movie is morally pretty neutral: it does not try to depict one side as ""good guys"" and the other as ""bad guys"", but shows officers and soldiers on both sides doing their duty in the face of the horror of intense ground combat.  Yet it is way less bloody than contemporary films.  It was shot in black and white, but in addition to that, there is almost no attempt to even depict blood: just the falling of troops hit by enemy fire, or the dead lying on the ground, without obvious blood.  Even less realistic: hardly any swearing by anybody, while in reality [yes, even then], it is pretty ubiquitous in such situations.

I expected the film to be dated; it was made in the acting and cinema style of the late 1950's and early 1960's.  Indeed, the dialog was a little stilted, and the characters were rather stereotypical of Americans from the World War II time period.

Given the above mentioned reservations, I nevertheless gave The Longest Day five stars because I remained riveted to my computer screen for the entire three hours.

The difference between the production in this film and that of A Bridge Too Far, filmed 15 years later, is striking... let alone comparison with the truly great opening sequence of Saving Private Ryan.  Given the number of actual participants in Operation Overlord who were still alive when the movie was made, there must be significant accuracy in the depiction; but many of the small-unit tactics shown seem to me to be somewhat, well, questionable. (Maybe the actors just all needed to be in the camera shot.)  I do respect the extras who participated in the beach assault scenes, as they likely had to attack across the sand in American uniforms, then again in British, then again in French; and some were surely injured by the pyrotechnics. Although the tracking shot of the French urban advance was very well done, the role of the French forces and resistance is over-depicted; for a more nuanced view read Verdict On Vichy by Michael Curtis. If The Longest Day were not an epic motion picture of an epic battle, working upon the sentiment of the period, I would not recommend it; but the film is a document more than it is a means of entertainment, and I believe it should be seen.

My father was a paratrooper in the 82nd Airborne and landed in the village square of Ste. Mere Eglise on the night of the invasion. He ended up in a tree with a German machine gunner shooting at him from the church steeple. He managed to cut his parachute lines and drop to the ground and get away. He was one of four that survived from his plane that night. John Steele, the man hanging on the church steeple, was another.

The acting has some bright moments, and some not so bright. I thought most of the British and German actors did a fair job, I found some of the American ones to be a bit ""stiff."" Henry Fonda did a decent job, as did Eddie Albert, but I thought John Wayne sounded like he was reading from the script.

The Longest Day features an all star international cast, some of whom were veterans of the Second World War.  Indeed, veterans of all the various armies portrayed in the movie.  The movie is delightfully free of the lurking Hun stereotype as would be seen in a Spielberg flick.  German fighter pilots, staff officers, and soldiers are often portrayed as conscientious defenders of their homeland.

The valor of the American Paratroopers is especially highlighted.

The film's realism is further enhanced by the deliberate use of black and white.  Additionally, veterans from both sides of the battle hired on as advisors so the actors are further able to portray the terror of being under a bombardment, injured and abandoned, or lost.

I have always felt it was extremely fortunate that Hitler didn't listen to Rommel and invade England. It would have been logistically much harder to set up the invasion of Europe if England was in Nazi hands. I used to talk to an old vet who was in the invasion and he said the first thing he remembered clearly was a church bell sounding in a French village at midnight. He said I suddenly realized I was alive and in France. I couldn't tell you exactly how I got from the beach to that little town. His recollections bought home the chaos and carnage that storming the beaches was.

The film is full of multiple story lines which detail the invasion from various view points. One of my favorite scenes is the look of horror on a German bunker officers face as a wall of ships appear out of the fog on the sea's horizon. He calls his commanding general to report it and the guy doesn't believe him ! Only after the general hears the officers  bunker being pounded by heavy naval bombardment does he realize the German general staff has made one of the biggest mistakes in history.

My mother was a nurse in London during the war. I asked her, did the hospital get bombed? she said, ""Yes."" What did you do? ""We picked up the ones who were still alive and moved them to the end still standing.""

554341,5,630305725X,"I have seen lots of movies of D-day, but this was a first.  The companion disk with this movie explains a lot that I never knew.  There were four directors for:German, French, British and American involvements.  There were also 42 international stars including three teen heart throbs of the day in the movie, but the movie focused on the common soldiers and not the stars.

The filming began in 1961, so men who participated in the Invasion were contacted to add their experiences to the book and screenplay.  A British actor actually participated in a mission that he played in to capture an important bridge.  So when the scene was being filmed, the director turned to the actor who was actually there for help.

Each country represented 'loaned' their armies to the film.  The invasion was an actual war game exercise by the US Army.  The actors played men who actually participated on that day.  Everything in the film happened, but Hollywood put its spin on certain scenes.

The producer wanted to make an anti war film, so he added or exaggerated things that did not really happen.  But the actual soldiers told us what really happened and how the movie portrayed the same events.

The movie was not allowed to show the slaughter on Omaha Beach in the 60s.  We had to wait until ""Saving Private Ryan"" before that was shown.

This black and white film reflects the newsreel reports of the day.  This movie depicts the heroism and courage of the soldiers of each country.  Each was doing what they believed was right.",1374105600,2,1522,4.683018867924528

He talked about what the Germans were doing in France and back in Berlin in addition to what the Allies were planning.  When we saw the movie, it pulled together what we had heard and seen during our visit to Normandy and brought the D-Day landings to life.

554489,5,630305725X,"It is only justice that the BEST WAR FILM EVER MADE describes what was the most crucial battle in all modern history of humanity. Below, more of my impressions, with some limited SPOILERS.

As far as I understand the history of World War II, allied landing in Normandy on 6 June 1944 and its immediate aftermath all the way until the success of Operation ""Cobra"" and the battle of Falaise Pocket, were THE decisive campaign of the whole conflict. The landing itself was the most crucial and the riskiest moment - and considering the disasters at Dieppe and in Dodecanese campaign and the close calls allies got at Salerno and Tarawa, there was always the possibility that the landing forces are rejected back to the sea...

The consequences of such defeat would be considerable, because it would take at least a couple of months to make another attempt - and in the meantime, on the Eastern Front, things could develop in many ways, few of them pleasant for Americans and Europeans. Hitler could avoid the great defeat in Belarus during Operation ""Bagration"", stabilize the front and maybe in time sign a separated peace with Stalin - or Red Army could win in Operation ""Bagration"" anyway and continue its march to the west. In the latter case, the time the allies make a second landing, let's say in September 1944, Soviet troops would have advanced already well into Poland (as it happened in real history) and as a result, in summer 1945 Red Army and allied forces would meet not on Elbe, but on Rhine... The Cold War could have later turn quite differently with Soviet empire controlling ALL Germany as well as Austria, Netherlands and Denmark and maybe also Finland, Sweden and Norway, not even talking about the dreadul damage communism would do to those countries...

Once this possibility is considered, it is clear that on 6th of June 1944 on the beaches of Normandy it was not only Hitler who lost - but also Stalin was defeated and as the result had to satisfy himself with a much lesser loot than what he could expect in the best-case scenario... And with two of most evil dictators of all time defeated on the same day, Normandy landing can claim to be possibly the most crucial battle in ALL MODERN HISTORY!

This black and white film was made in 1962, when thousands of veterans were still alive and could give advice - that included some important players, like generals Gunther Blumentritt and James Gavin, allied special forces and commando officers Lord Lovat, John Howard and Philippe Kieffer and German major Werner Pluskat, the first German officer to spot the allied fleet. Luftwaffe ace Josef ""Pips"" Priller was also consulted for the needs of this film but he died before its release.

Adapted from a brilliant book by Cornelius Ryan (a recommended reading!), this film takes its name from a sentence pronounced by Rommel to his officers when inspecting the Atlantic Wall in months preceding the landings: ""We must stop and defeat the invasion here - on the beaches! Both for allies and for us, the first 24 hours of invasion will be the the longest day"".

The film is very dramatic, from the very first moments, even if initially it describes mostly waiting and waiting. But even then there is a feeling that something absolutely enormous, of monumental size and importance, is approaching. Then, once Eisenhower takes the decision to proceed even if weather is unfavourable, events start to accelerate and from that moment on there is no respite, until the final credits. At 3 hours this is a long film, but I guarantee that you will not even feel this time passing!

The quality of filming is incredible and the music written by Paul Anka is extremely powerful, with the final song being posibly the best military march I ever heard (and I heard a lot). It is possible to buy this film in coloured version - but I always preferred the black and white original and I purchased at purpose such a copy.

Although this film doesn't describe all the important aspects of D-Day in Normandy (it would have to be 10 hours long at least to do it), it still includes a great number of most famous and most significant episodes: the diversionary landings of ""Ruperts"" in Pas-de-Calais, the night air drop of three allied airborne divisions over Normandy (including the horrible drama at Sainte-Mre-Eglise village), the attack of Pegasus Bridge by gliders, the sabotage attacks by French Resistance, the landings themselves, with the bloodbath at Omaha Beach being particularly well covered, the incredible attack of US Rangers against Pointe-du-Hoc, the Free French commandos attack against Ouistreham, etc.

The cast is simply incredible: Henry Fonda, John Wayne, Richard Burton, Robert Mitchum, Robert Ryan, Curd Jurgens, Gert Frbe, Sean Connery, Robert Wagner, Peter Lawford, Kenneth More, Paul Anka, Mel Ferrer, Jeffrey Hunter, Sal Mineo, Rod Steiger, Richard Todd, John Robinson, Tom Tryon, John Gregson, Leslie Phillips, Eddie Albert, Roddy McDowall, Peter van Eyck, George Segal, Steve Forrest, Bernard Fox, Bourvil and Arletty, just to name the most known ones. And they all give a great show!

It is also worth noticing that many of actors served in allied armed forces during WWII - this was the case of Henry Fonda (US Navy), Richard Burton (RAF), Robert Ryan (US Marines), Kenneth More (Royal Navy), Rod Steiger (US Navy), Richard Todd (British Army - 6th Airborne Division), John Robinson (British Army - Royal Armoured Force), Tom Tryon (US Navy), John Gregson (Royal Navy), Leslie Phillips (British Army - Royal Artillery), Eddie Albert (US Navy, decorated with Bronze Star for his actions during battle of Tarawa), Peter van Eyck (US Army), Steve Forrest (US Army) and Bernard Fox (Royal Navy).

The case of Richard Todd, who plays Major John Howard, is particularly interesting, as this actor took REALLY part in D-Day landings and participated in fight for Pegasus Bridge, under the orders of REAL Major John Howard - and in this film he is himself played by another actor (sadly uncredited)!

The intensity of battle scenes, the drama and the tension, the shocker scenes, the nasty surprises - all of this gives a uniquely powerful war film. And there is also humor amongst all this tragedy - I will certainly never forget the scene picturing one of British beach-masters and his dog Winston and I almost died laughing during the appearance of ""traitor"" pidgeons...)))

Bottom line, this film is an IMMORTAL MASTERPIECE, which can be watched as many times as you want - and it never gets old... One of few films in history which reached PERFECTION, together with ""Star Wars"" (the first one), ""Gone with the wind"", ""Seven samurai"", ""Excalibur"", ""The man who shot Liberty Valance"", ""Harakiri"" and ""Alien"". To buy, watch, keep, re-watch and never give away. Enjoy!",1372723200,3,6797,4.910278745644599

554585,5,630305725X,"I am well familiar with the criticisms of this movie.  Yes, it includes an unnecessary all-star cameo cast, many of whom go through the motions of acting.  Yes, it is unrealistic and bloodless, unlike the Saving Private Ryan, which brings the full horror of the Normandy landing to the screen.  Yes, it has some terrible script-writing and poor ironic humor (""I wonder what bitte, bitte means"").

But, this needs to be placed into context, less than 20 years after Normandy.  Darryl F. Zanuck was determined to bring a war movie of unprecedented realism and scale to the screen before the memory of D-Day was a distant memory, and the heroes who made it possible to reclaim Europe from the tyranny of Nazism had passed from the awareness of their families and buddies.  He did that, and very well.  No war movie had really done that before.

Then, there are some truly great scenes.  To me, all of the scenes with the Germans are well-acted and true-to-reality.  I think that the French also do a great job.  The English also do well.  It is only the American portions of the movie where some of the acting is truly hideous.  John Wayne, as always, is.... well.... John Wayne.  The cameo that Rod Steiger does is truly forgettable.  It embarrasses me every time I see it.  There is also some bending of the truth, as the scene with Brigadier General Teddy Roosevelt Jr. on board ship.

I think this is a solid picture made within the confines of the 1960s.  It raised the standard for historical dramas to a new height, which later made pictures like Patton and Private Ryan possible.  So, I give this picture 5 stars, just as I do Birth of a Nation.

We spend five minutes watching a paratrooper hanging from a bell tower by his chute chords, seeing his comrades being shot by Germans.  Plenty of action and authenticity - no need for more blood or bombs - we just don't need a separate up-close vignette with each and every one of the 47 stars in the film, which is what we get (i.e. Richard Burton gets two extended theatrical scenes; Robert Mitchum gets close ups fumbling for cigars in his vest) For sweeping WWII classics, ""Saving Private Ryan"" IS better, and from the same mid-60s era, ""Midway"" (also with Henry Fonda and Robert Mitchum) is much, MUCH better.",1359244800,4,1008,4.748571428571428

555045,5,630305725X,"What is there to say about 20th Century Fox and its legendary and cantankerous studio chief Darryl Zanuck's monstrous 1962 World War II epic THE LONGEST DAY that hasn't already been said?

Taken from Cornelius Ryan's excellent book of the same name (with Ryan and various others working on the screenplay) about the D-Day invasion of June 6, 1944, an invasion officially known as Operation Overlord, THE LONGEST DAY shows how numerous elements of planning and chance helped bring about the single biggest military campaign in history, one that led to the eventual end of Hitler's Third Reich.  And for this, Zanuck had assembled a massive crew in which three directors (the legendary Andrew Marton for the U.S.; Ken Annakin for the Brits; and Bernhard Wicki for the Germans), special effects men, and a huge cast of Hollywood stars put themselves in service of this epic true story.

While certain elements are inevitably fictionalized, notably elements of the landing itself (which, as SAVING PRIVATE RYAN's opening sequence shows, wasn't a cakewalk by any stretch of the imagination), the film does capture the behind-the-scenes planning amongst the top men and officers on both sides of the conflict, including the Germans, whose soldiers are seen accurately in this film as basic foot soldiers just doing their job, and not the goose-stepping Nazi goons in Berlin who sent twenty million people to their deaths.  At three hours, this still may be a lot for people to take in, even if their attention spans haven't been warped by the sound and fury of war movies past and present.  On the other hand, if the length of the film is a bit much, and the film itself is old-fashioned by today's standards, there is always that unbelievable gathering of Hollywood heavyweights to keep one's attention focused: John Wayne (who, ironically, never served in World War II), Henry Fonda, Robert Mitchum, Rod Steiger, Robert Wagner, Edmond O'Brien, Robert Ryan, Sean Connery (just as he ascended to stardom as James Bond), Roddy McDowall, Red Buttons, Richard Burton, Richard Todd, and tons of others.  All of this was done at what was then considered an exorbitant cost of $10 million (though Fox had poured $40 million into CLEOPATRA at the same time, and almost went bankrupt doing so), and it became one of the biggest moneymakers of its day, as well as the most commercially successful black-and-white film until Spielberg's 1993 masterpiece SCHINDLER'S LIST.

Unlike a lot of war films of its time, THE LONGEST DAY, while stirring and stunning, doesn't make any heavy pretenses or apologies towards patriotism, because it was understood that Operation Overlord was an absolute necessity in order to save Europe and the world at large.  Those men who fought that day, regardless of their nationalities, are to be saluted for their courage and bravery; and even though it may have been surpassed by SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, THE LONGEST DAY still remains one of Hollywood's great war films, one to be remembered for many more decades to come.",1320969600,,3032,5.001984126984127
555046,5,630305725X,"This is a great film, it was one of my early motivations to want to become a paratrooper.  This version has great extras, however the commentary by ""historian"" Mary Corey is both unintentionally funny and jaw dropping biased against the American view.  She seems to be wanting to really be talking about the Vietnam War rather than WW2 during much of the commentary.

When a group of US troops are shown she goes into a long discussion about how the US army was not racially intergrated and talks about a Stevie Wonder Vietnam War song and scenes of blacks in Appx Now.  When an older, balding padre is shown she mentions that in Vietnam the average was only 19. One of her more laughable commenst is during the paratroop drops when some troopers land in a cow pasture.  The cows look at the men and move on, Ms Corey compares this to the movie ""The Thin Red Line"" (1997 version). She believes that the cows are the same as the bushmen in that movie, which she says was about fighting in Fiji, I guess her history degree didn't cover the Guadalcanel invasion.  She really misses on the US rangers cliff assault.  Again she seems to want to talk about VN movies and not what we are watching.  She makes no mention of the rangers mission and wether or not it was a success.  During this scene, when not talking about her favorite Vietnam movies she is silent.  When we are indroduced to Henry Fonda as Theordore Roosevelt's son she goes into a ridiculus version of TR and the rough riders, who she says were a bunch of polo players, atheletes and small time movie actors who make up their own uniforms ands invade Cuba. She than tells us that after TR's presidency he went to Afica and killed 2000 animals.

When the film is ending and we see our last sights of Robert Mitchum and the music score begins.  Our historian informs us-""now we have the triumphant music that so often ends American war movies like The Bridge on the River Kiwi.""  That's funny sense that film was made and about the British military.  Mary Corey is a historian from UCLA and specializes in WW2 and 60's cultural events.

A message is intercepted by the Germans; does it mean the invasion is imminent? No, the stormy weather makes that unlikely. The Americans prepare for an invasion of France - the most crucial event of this time. Troops play dice while waiting. The top Allied generals chose the time for an invasion; its not perfect but good enough. Pathfinders will light the landing zones for paratroopers. Can dummies fool the enemy? A toy clicker for signaling. Another message warns of the impending invasion. This tell the French Resistance they should destroy telephone lines, bridges, and other means of communication or transport. British gliders transport soldiers to capture a bridge intact. [Was this more cost-effective than paratroops?] Lights on the ground identify the drop zones for paratroopers. A German train is derailed by an explosion. Paratroopers mistakenly land by a village, some are killed or captures. The fortunes of war.

Paratroop companies landed in a scattered manner. The Germans regard the Normandy landing as a diversion. They need permission from Hitler to move the reserves, but he is asleep. Dawn brings ships at sea, some of them bomb the fortified positions. Soldiers are ferried ashore in landing craft. They land a low tide to avoid mines. The troops move to the land. German troops march to the shore. Allied fighters strafe troops and trucks. Other troops climb tall cliffs under fire. Note the use of Tommy guns and grenades for close combat. A bagpiper leads the British troops. The Free French attack a port town. A tank cannon destroys a German pillbox. The Americans ask for bangalore mines, bazookas, and wire cutters to advance inland from Omaha beach. Obstacles are destroyed so they can advance inland. More troops and vehicles come ashore and move inland. The invasion succeeded.

The credits present the players in alphabetical order. You may recognize some names, but they are not linked to the characters. This was adapted from the book of Cornelius Ryan. Note the inclusion of different nationalities. Missing are the air forces and tanks, but that would have resulted in a much higher production cost.

With an international cast of heavweight actors led by John Wayne, Henry Fonda and Robert Mitchum- amongst many others, this film depicts the events of June 6,1944 with depth and precision.

Too much for one director, this film had several directors shooting their scenes at the same time, and Zanuck got the Department of Defense to lend massive aid- the invasion sequence is breathtaking and quite real; no CGI effects here.

Look for a young Sean Connery in a small role; a nice bit of trivia is that the 007 producers held up the production of 'Dr No' while Connery was busy with this shoot...

555117,5,630305725X,"The Longest Day is easily one of the finest epic movies ever made, probably the best epic war film ever made (well, one that focuses on battles), and easily outclasses all other old fashioned war movies.  One heck of a picture, the film is still stunning today, thanks to amazing cinematography, detail, and a balanced look between the men and the massive battle (though there's a substantial more of the latter).  The sixties and seventies created some great epic films, many of them war films that stand out even today.  The decades also produced some stinkers including the Battle of the Bulge, but this is easily the most memorable and best of the lot, given the high amount of great war movies made during that time.

Like Tora! Tora! Tora!, The Longest Day makes a very important monumental battle get it's justice, as producer Darryl F. Zanuck and company portray one of the most important battles in history from all major sides with great detail, highlighting and recreating this massive day with four directors (all in their own native languages), an all star cast of forty eight major roles (including Wayne, Burton, Connery, Mitchum, Robert Ryan, and Fonda), and over 23,000 extras.  Almost split into three hours each, the film covers various aspects of the landing process and decisions, then focuses on the airborne and ground landings, respectfully.  There's hardly any parts that will bore you in this film.

One thing I noticed about this film is that it's absolutely gorgeous piece of film making.  Really!  Shooting the film in grim black and white gives it a newsreel vintage look (and film is actually interjected with REAL newsreel footage), and I wouldn't have the film any other way.  Using color would only diminish the film's impact.  The staggering cinematography captures the sweeping battle sequences, grim imagery and images galor, and the period look of WW2 is intact here.  Deep focus captures scenery with depth and vast beauty + grimness, and the battle is captured with an organized, visually compelling way, but never feels too static and deliberately made.  Hats off for the great special effects lending an air for an authentic movie experience, and the cinematography too.  Both aspects won Oscars.

The Longest Day, unlike other older war movies, never feels like propaganda, for the most part, it just shows the battle.  Yeah, a little bit of color and emotion is put into the film's style, but there's a refreshing lack of musical cues and other such crap telling US (no, not U.S.) how to feel about the war.  And it certainly isn't pro-war either.  Anybody who watches this thinking war is cool has to be high out of their minds.  It's true that the film is somewhat sanitized in the violence/intensity department compared to other films, but there's still a great emotional context, and you won't be sitting there bored out of your mind.  The score sometimes highlights the good in the soldiers, but it didn't bother me.  It's not a crime, and I'm sure some people can understand the concept of having some sort of respect for the people who fight these wars.

Don't be deceived by the G rating or the fact that this film was made in 1962, the recreations of the actual battles themselves are quite stunning.  While it lacks the brutality of later war films (especially movies post SPR), it's depiction of the battles are stunning, non glamorous, and completely believable and scary; soldiers fall realistically and there's tension and chaos within these scenes.  I was really impressed, actually, by the way that sound design didn't get in the way.  Despite some obviously dated explosions sounds and bullet sounds, I felt the battles themselves were completely the opposite of tinny, they are very effective and also manage not to glorify what they are doing.  And hey, in my opinion, the depiction of the paratrooper planes is better here than in Band of Brothers.  Really!

Regarding the comparisons between Saving Private Ryan and The Longest Day, don't be fooled too much by other people comparing the two.  In my opinion, the only thing these two films have in common are the Omaha Beach landings, and both are set during Normandy.  Even then the latter similarity is different: Ryan ignores all of the other portions of Normandy, and the rest of the film starts three days after June 6th (after a sequence starting the story of saving Ryan, that is).  Furthermore, The Longest Day actually shows Omaha Beach more accurately, it shows that it took almost a whole day to clear the beach.  Ryan is a much more personal story as well, while The Longest Day focuses on the battle itself, it's essentialy about D-Day, the Sixth of June ONLY.  I personally love both of the films, but please keep in mind, despite what others may think, the two films really don't have much in common with each other besides loose source material.

Either way though, The Longest Day is easily Hollywood's finest old school war epic.  Tora! Tora! Tora! and A Bridge Too Far come close, but none of them come close as much as this film does.  Easily the best of the lot. They sure don't make em' like they use to.  Just ask Michael Bay.",1281484800,3,5164,4.814058956916099
555118,5,630305725X,"Directed in part by Ken Annakin, war epic THE LONGEST DAY was originally advertised as having a cast of 42 stars. For some reason, several of these were North American pop singers: Panl Anka, Fabian, Sal Mineo (yes, he recorded for EPIC) and Tommy Sands. One drawback of such an enormous roster is many actors (like Rod Steiger) are limited to a minute of screen time.

You have to admire the scope of this work in its attempt to simultaneously depict events of 6/6/44 from four points of view: German, French, British and American. Three languages are spoken (subtitles provided) and a limited amount of vintage stock footage is included.

Besides military actions of that day, we see activities of French civilians and Resistance operatives as the Normandy shoreline is invaded by the largest military force in history. Brief comic relief in what is deadly serious business provided by Sean Connery (who looks GREAT!) and Red Buttons. Events are personalized as we witness behaviors of leaders, private soldiers and anonymous citizens.

From the German point of view, blame is placed for a successful Allied invasion on Adolf Hitler, who'd taken a sleeping pill and issued a ""DO NOT DISTURB"" order. But the reality is: nothing short of a miracle could stop such a colossal movement of men and materi&eacute;l. The best the enemy could've hoped for (if they had available panzers to augment a Luftwaffe force of TWO planes) was a delay of the inevitable.

The Allied incursion into France along with an approach of the Russian Army from the west, plus overwhelming numbers would eventually crush German resistance like a bug between a giant thumb and forefinger. But first, for these events to happen must come ""The Longest Day.""

It's a film that engrosses viewers for its full 175 minutes, and leaves you wanting more-- the sign of a cinematic masterpiece. For any history or military-minded person, this one is absolute required viewing.

But that shouldn't detour anyone from enjoying this well made war epic starring film greats like John Wayne,Robert Mitchum, Red Buttons, Richard Burton, Eddie Albert, Sean Connery, and Henry Fonda and many others.  The picture appears crisper here than on any other edition too. My Late Uncle who fought in this battle and accross europe watched this and said it was in spirit at least a good movie representation  but the violence was of course on a different level. More like ""Saving private ryan"" and he told me of many planes coming down in flames and  piles of corpses human and animals everywhere.  This type of war movie salutes the troops and doesn't as few movies did until recently show war in realistic manner. Things like Heads flying off and piles of guts that were once people laying around. That shouldn't detour anyone from watching this and enjoying the story and fine acting. After all my uncle liked it and he was there. And like he said later at least they didn't make it like so many other movies  in which american troops were depicted as the villians.

555224,4,630305725X,"There are many reviews of the movie posted.  I wanted to give some thoughts on the Blu-ray disc.  I would rate the transfer as good, but not great.  Granted, this is a 47-year old film, so your expectations have to be lower than for a current film.  The opening sequences are very good and you begin to think that this is literally a clearer, sharper version than any that has been seen before, even on the film's opening day.  But then about 20 minutes in some problems with the transfer crop up.  It's most notable in the faces, which become quite washed-out.  Several of the scenes with John Wayne suffer from this.  The problems last for perhaps 15 to 20 minutes and then intermittently thereafter.  These scenes are still very watchable, but the transfer problems become a bit of a distraction; as the scene changes you wonder -- is the next scene going to be a good transfer or a bad transfer?  There are also a couple of short scenes that appear not to have been processed at all.  I'm not referring here to the documentary footage, which presumably could not be processed, but to regular scenes that for some reason are not in HD.  The Blu-ray process also causes some problems with rear-projection scenes, where actors are shown in front of canned backgrounds.  Here the Blu-ray process accentuates the fact that the backgrounds aren't live.  So, all told, I'm glad I now have a Blu-ray version of this film, but it's not quite as a big an improvement on the DVD version as I had hoped.

The extras are decent, but not exceptional.  On Disc 1, the commentary by a UCLA history professor is pretty awful.  She is very condescending and seems to assume that she is addressing an audience of 12-year olds who know nothing about WW II.  The various ""making of"" types documentaries on Disc 2 are ok, if somewhat repetitive -- the same interview with Red Buttons is used in a couple of them and many of the same points are repeated.  One of these documentaries appears to have been prepared for showing on AMC and another for the History Channel.  Probably the best of the lot is an interview with Ken Annakin who was hired by Darryl F. Zanuck to direct the British sequences and ended up directing a considerable chunk of the film.  Although Annakin, who recently passed away, was probably in his 90s when the interview was filmed, he is interesting and informative, particularly about filming the difficult aerial footage of the French commandos taking the casino.  (Annakin also supplies a commentary track on Disc 1.) Missing from these documentaries is the kind of detailed discussion of the film that goes into the difficulties of coordinating such a huge project or how the choices were made to include some sequences and cut others that fans of the film would love to hear about.  I've always thought that the film as we have it is probably missing some deleted scenes.  To take one obvious example, where is the scene showing how the Red Buttons character got down from the church steeple?  There are a couple of other plot lines that seem to be dropped a little too abruptly.  No deleted scenes are included on the discs.

555230,4,630305725X,"This was an another one of these all-star casts that you don't see these days in which about everyone who was actor at the time made an appearance....or it just seems that way.

Some of them, to be fair, had very short roles in here, but this is a real ""Who's Who"" of the acting profession in 1962. There are also a lot of German actors in here speaking German (with subtitles provided), perhaps numbering even more than the English-speaking stars. That's because the famous day of June 6, 1944, is seen from both sides of the conflict.

At three hours, it gives you plenty of D-Day World War II action. Almost two-thirds of the movie involves action from that famous invasion. In some spots, it just gets to be too much. Frankly, the whole film is too much and almost bogs down in too many areas....and it shouldn't, but it is a very technical film.

Special-effects-wise, for a film 45 years old, the action is pretty realistic. I thought the best shots were the overheads during one particular scenes when the Allies were going through a town.

I am not  a WWII expert so how much info of the infamous 'D-Day"" here is correct, I don't know. Since they went into such detail, I'll assume they were fairly accurate. I can say one thing I learned at the time I first saw this as a late teen: I had no idea ""D-Day"" was this huge in scope: three million men and 5,000 ships??!!!

The blu-ray version of this film is terrific. It looks as good as it did when I saw it at the theater. I couldn't recommend this movie any more highly.",1235174400,2,452,4.592592592592593
555283,5,630305725X,"In one of this special edition's most intriguingly kitschy extras, the 1968 TV special D-Day Revisited, the erstwhile head of 20th Century Fox and producer of The Longest Day Darryl F. Zanuck takes a colour camera crew (most of whom worked on the film itself) to the real-life locations of the D-Day landings. Whether explaining D-Day to an ignorant young French bit part actress pretending to be a waitress at the cafe by Pegasus Bridge while waiting for cameraman Henri Decae to set up a shot (""What is D-Day?""), offering his interesting interpretation of how the French language should be spoken or briefly taking off the dark glasses he wears even in his office to discuss strategy, his eyes darting from left to right without ever looking at the camera even when addressing it directly, oozing sincerity from every pore, Zanuck is a screen natural.

That said, for all the egocentric camp value on display, there is also a good visual imagination at work to remind you of just why he was one of the legendary studio heads, with excellent use of a camera helicopter and an extraordinary final shot of the Allied cemeteries that is remarkably powerful and genuinely touching. For all the hokey presentation and grandstanding, there is no doubting his sincerity. When he made The Longest Day he set out to make money, but he also set out to make a tribute, and that comes across powerfully in the film itself.

The all-star approach does have its drawbacks (I remember seeing the film at the Imperial War Museum where the couple in front kept on arguing over the names of the stars and the parents in the audience read the titles aloud to their children) but works here better than most, largely due to the quality of the vignettes: paratrooper Red Buttons hanging from the church spire while all around him his comrades are massacred before they land by waiting Germans; Sal Mineo discovering that the identification signal for the Allied troops is identical to the sound of a rifle bolting; a group of Germans and Americans unwittingly passing each other by while looking up at planes; Richard Burton and Paul Anka's meeting in a farmyard. What is also interesting is that not only does it go to surprising lengths to avoid phoney war movie heroics but it does not overlook the Allied mistakes either.

Considering the visual flatness of many CinemaScope epics - particularly at Fox, where long takes and a stationary camera often seemed de rigueur - it is visually astonishingly ambitious. If there is the odd camera shadow on the massive tracking shot of the landing at Omaha Beach, it is entirely forgivable in context of a stunningly executed sequence. The aerial work is also particularly memorable, with striking shots of the attack on Ouistreham and a spectacular p.o.v. sequence from the cockpit of a German plane strafing the beaches.

With an international cast to take advantage of the foreign markets, here were minor differences between versions released in various territories, but this restores many of the cuts from previous video releases (such as Jean Servais' scene reluctantly ordering the French to shell their own homeland).",1232496000,3,3150,4.915413533834586
555284,5,630305725X,"""THE LONGEST DAY"", based on a book by Cornelius Ryan, tells us of the events of and surrounding D-Day, the World War II invasion executed on June 6, 1944. We see almost everything from the perspectives of both the Allied and Axis forces. It is a brilliantly made, extremely well-acted, and above all, a genuinely felt war epic. Just about every actor that ever worked in Hollywood during the ""golden age"" is here to lend their excellent acting abilities- John Wayne, Robert Mitchum, Richard Beymer, Robert Ryan, Edmond O'Brien, Henry Fonda, Red Buttons, Stuart Whitman, Roddy McDowall, Robert Wagner, Curt Jurgens, Sean Connery, and so many others. But even more worthy of top billing is the invasion itself. The actors and actresses, great as they are, are far outshined by the scope and grand scale of the invasion, which, in turn, gives the film immesurable quality. The entire film is perfect. Every part of it is a complement to everything else: the acting, the black-and-white cinematography, the music (by Maurice Jarre and theme music by Paul Anka), the wonder, the awe, the irony-absolutely nothing is out of place.
  I believe the only reason that movies, television, documentaries, and anything else to do with the art of film should or ever needs to exist is to make us believe in the subject matter. It's not about the paycheck, the latest romantic scandal, or to show off. The purpose is to make us believe, recognize the character's attributes (or lack thereof) within ourselves, and for the cast and crew to do their best. Not every movie has succeeded, but many have, and it's a pity that many of today's films do not. Even though World War II did occur, as well as D-Day, Pearl Harbor, and all the rest, the audiences of war films could never believe for themselves that those things did happen if the movies were not believable. Fortunately, this film is very believable and realistic, and the stock footage from the actual invasion is a great asset.
  As a matter of fact, ""THE LONGEST DAY"" is probably one of the best films ever made (on the subject of war or otherwise). It defies the use of unneccessary gore in ""SAVING PRIVATE RYAN"", and even uses all the elements from many other films - such as the ""get-in-blow-it-up-get-out"" theme from ""THE BRIDGE ON THE RIVER KWAI"" and ""THE GUNS OF NAVARONE"" (both great films). The unrest and comraderie among superiors and subordinates, the escapism, the adventure, the horror, the frustration - all have been used before, and not just in war films. Not to mention that this film also succeeds as both a ""buddy film"", and, of course, a ""guy movie"". But it is this movie that, even though it was one of the last of the greatest war movies, sets the tone for all the others.
  As a final note, ""THE LONGEST DAY"" also has some of the best scenes ever captured on film. A lot of the old cliches are used, and some new ones as well. Kenneth More's entire performance, the two guys with the pigeons, John Wayne exhibiting his tough guy persona, etc. The sporadic wry humor, the great action pieces, the use of actual footage from the invasion, is all used very well. To list some of my favorite scenes from this movie would take forever and a day, but my top favorites are as follows: John Wayne's first scene when he suddenly turns around and you're thinking, ""Holy Smokes! It's the Duke!"" (let me assure you that those are my exact feelings every time), the introduction of ""Rupert"" (and when he is introduced to the German officers), the use of codes, the boats unloading the troops onto the beach, the guy on bagpipes, the ""hold until relieved"", all the character pieces, and so much more. A tried-and-true, dignified, immensely entertaining, miraculous, illustrious slice of history.

The scale of this film is incredible and the amount of back-stories incorporated into the tale from Burtons injured pilot to Waynes gung-ho C.O. Obviously every facet of the D-Day invasion could not be covered, but this film makes a good effort at chronicling one of the most important days in world history in a reasonably accurate and unsentimental way.

555290,5,630305725X,"This is a 1962 attempt to be an accurate rendition of D day, based on Cornelius Ryan's book, ""The Longest Day"", when the allied forces of world war two crossed the English Channel and fought their way up the beaches of France.  The whole film is of the events of that day.

The list of popular actors playing the parts of the various countries and ethnicities of the time is too long to mention in this review. However Eddy Albert (a method actor) was quite believable and contributed much to the energy of this rendition. Be sure to see Eddy Albert again in uniform in ""Teahouse of the August Moon"" (1956.) And that little cutie Irina Demark was the girlfriend of the producer, Darryl F. Zanuck.

You can tell this picture was remastered some time recently as it looks as crisp as the day it was made. And you can only find a few missed specks on the Blu-ray rendition. The Blu-ray version has the obligatory voice-over recollections forom the only remaining director.

The film is a keeper and is worth the purchase.

Compared to excellent B/W DVD releases such as Warner's presentation of ""Citizen Kane"" (1941) or Criterion's release of David Lean's ""Great Expectations""  (1946), this Fox release of ""Longest Day"" is totally unacceptable.  To make matters worse, this disc begins with a burst of noise accompanying a preview which cannot be defeated with the menu button.  A real bummer over-all.  How would the public feel if every music CD began with commercials for new CD releases?  How are they getting away with this?

 If, at the beginning of this practice, consumers returned dvd's with commercials on them to the manufacturers or the dealers, it probably could have been stopped fast.

555363,3,630305725X,"I've just been listening to a BBC program called ""And The Academy Award Goes To..."" when I heard a film reviewer make a sacrilegious statement, ""The Longest Day is not a very good movie"". I've felt that for years. The first weekend The Longest Day opened, my buddy & I rode the bus 14 miles into Seattle to see this. We were thrilled, but since we were watching through our clear 10 year old eyes, we could spot a ""fakey"" movie when we saw it. The use of Messerschmidt bf-108's was glaring, but when the film was made there were few(if any) bF-109's flying(except for with Franco's air force), and of course most of the cast was too old, like John Wayne as Lt. Col. Benjamin Vandervoort(no wonder his ankle broke, the Duke weighed about 500 pounds), or was too phoney, like Paul Anka. Still, at least this was not ""woven around the love of a man and a woman"", and this is a decent interpretation of the events around the D-Day invasion. The scenes of Omaha & Utah beaches were too wide open, the weather too good. The cinematographer should have concentrated on quality of image, rather than always going for sweeping views of the beaches, where the 2- or 3 thousand extras were swallowed up by the vastness of the undertaking. I feel the best battle scenes are around the fortified casino in Ouistreham.

The contribution of the Brits, Commonwealth Forces, and French were overexpanded, everyone knows the US did this alone. HEY, I am KIDDING about that- I'm sick of war flicks where so-called artistic license is taken to overemphasize, maximize, or invent the American contribution, such as in the equally overrated ""The Great Escape"", and one of the most glaring Hollywood fantasies, the absolutely shameful ""U-571"". At least this isn't colorized, which some people think would enhance this film. Personally, when I think of the war in the Pacific, I think in color, for the ETO, it's black & white, ""The Great Escape"" notwithstanding. The bottom line: this isn't a ""great"" movie, only a fair one, but the events depicted are pivotal to civilization. If the panzer reserves were closer to the beaches, if the weather was worse, or too fine, the Allies could easily have been thrown back into the sea. Like the Battle Of Britain, El Alamein, the Coral Sea, Midway, the Normandy invasion plays a pivotal role in the recovery and preservation of a free Western Europe. And ""The Longest Day"" played a pivotal role in the preservation of 20th Century Fox, to make Fox safe for reality TV and to help establish tabloid sports reporting",1221350400,3,2533,4.71783295711061
555364,5,630305725X,"Other than the James Bonds, this is my favorite film and my favorite war film.  I remember seeing it at my local theater at age 13 in 1963, a year after its first run reserved-seat engagement on Broadway.  I watch it every June 6th. and have yet to tire of it.
Starring John Wayne, Robert Mitchum, Henry Fonda, Richard Burton and a pre-Dr. No, Sean Connery, among numerous others.  (The only film I can think of with a better cast is probably ""How the West Was Won.)  The film had three directors and the massive action sequences are still breathtaking: The 82nd. airborne division disasterous drop in German-occupied Ste. Mere Eglise, the 2 Luftwaffe plans strafing the 2 British beaches, the Ranger division's incredible attack of the German-held Pointe du Hoc and especially, the French Commando raid on the french town of Ouestram with one long several minute helicoptor shot that has to be seen to be believed. (Like other films of this period the end-credits are shockingly short.  Today the credits on a film of this size would last ten minutes.)
I have this film on video and DVD.  While it was nice that they added a few extra features on its most recent DVD release, I truly wish they could have located a few deleted scenes. (You can see a scene not in the film briefly in the trailer included.)  In 1994, on the 50th anniversary of D-Day, a colorized version of this film was released on video, (the film is in black and white.)  The colorized version was pretty good and should have been included with the recent DVD and blu-ray release.
This film lost the best picture Oscar to ""Lawrence of Arabia"" and amazingly only won 2 technical Oscars.  While Lawrence is a great film also, ""The Longest Day"" is a greater and more important achievement and it continues to annoy me to this day that it did not win the best picture Oscar.

The hours upon hours of boredom.  And then suddenly, you get the word to go.  There is confusion, stupidity, heroism ... it shows it all.

Many, many of the accounts in this movie are true to history.  These were ordinary men on all sides who were caught up in history.  The casting is terrific.  My personal favorite is Kenneth More (and his dog).  But others are outstanding - as usual - Henry Fonda, Robert Mitchum, Eddie Arnold, and of course, John Wayne.  For those who question The Duke's acting ability, just watch his reaction at seeing the paratroopers hanging from trees.  That's acting.  Other notable performances are Red Buttons, Robert Wagner, Richard Burton, Sal Mineo and Jeffrey Hunter.  But be prepared:  with a cast this size, some of them come and go before you realize it.

555418,4,630305725X,"1962 was a banner year for John Wayne. Four movies were released that year that he was in, Hatari!, The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance (which didn't do that well at the box office), How the West Was Won (which he was barely in) & The Longest Day. How the West Was Won was #3 at the box office while The Longest Day was #5.

As to who was the star of this movie is debatable, I would say the special effects crew & the cinematographers. The movie was nominated for four Academy Awards; winning two, Best Cinematography (Black & White) & Best Special Effects. The cast was an international who's who that allowed the fan to play 'name that star'. At a time when Hollywood began to import foreign actors for roles they weren't particularly suited for, producers actually used the right actors in this film; Americans played their parts, British played their parts, French played their parts & the Germans were cast as Germans. One of the other great things about the film is that the Germans, nor anyone else for that matter, were personified as idiots. Though there is very little room for character development I never felt that I was seeing caricatures.

The movie is mostly from the viewpoints of the Americans & Germans though the British & French get some attention. The first third of the film deals with the 24 hours previous to the invasion. The remainder of the film deals with the actual invasion. We get many vignettes within the film & some humorous moments. The film does have flaws but none that can't be overlooked. The worst thing is the number of characters that are presented, one almost needs to have a scorecard in order to keep up with everyone.

555419,5,630305725X,"""The Longest Day"" is a sprawling depiction of one of the most critical battles of World War II, D-Day, the invasion of France through Normandy's beaches.  Darryl Zanuck, as head of 20th Century Fox, fastened upon Cornelius Ryan's bestselling book and decided to acquire the rights and make the movie.

First, the all-star cast is worthy of note. Included in the cast: John Wayne, Robert Mitchum, Robert Ryan, Sean Connery, Richard Burton, Henry Fonda, Rod Steiger, Red Buttons, Eddie Arnold, Peter Lawford, Roddy McDowell, Kenneth More, Fabian, Tom Tryon, Sal Mineo, and so on. And Gert Frobe, from ""Goldfinger"" fame!

Second, the movie was shot in black and white. Oddly enough, this works for me. It provides a grittier look and fits with the semi-documentary style adopted by the movie.

Third, it is one of a series of such epics that appeared over a period of time, including ""Tora, Tora, Tora"" and ""Midway."" All incorporated, to some extent. actual footage of war film.

Fourth, the story takes us from the preparation for the invasion and the precarious weather reports, to the launching of the forces to precede the invasion (e.g., glider troops and paratroops). Snafus are portrayed as well as successes.

Fifth, some scenes that I found interesting. . . .  Pluskat's finally seeing the American fleet bearing down on his bunker on the beaches of Normandy.  Teddy Roosevelt, Jr. finagling his way into the invasion.  ""Rupert's"" diversionary tactics.  Red Buttons' terrifying parachute drop into a key town. The swirling bagpipes of Lord Lovat's troops (Lovat played by Peter Lawford). The nuns. . . . Scene after scene. It's a very watchable movie.

So, how to evaluate?  War is portrayed in a pretty antiseptic manner.  After having watched ""Saving Private Ryan,"" D-Day will never look the same, so the portrayal of the landing does not have the same punch (but it was an earlier era, and this is probably unfair to raise as an issue). In the end, though, this is one of the best versions of the events of June 6th, 1944.",1211846400,7,2031,4.886297376093294

John Wayne and Robert Mitchum head the all-star cast in this star studded recounting of the Normandy invasion during World War II.  This is one of the greatest war movies ever made.  It tells the story of the Allies leading up to the Invasion and some of the events that happened that day.

Highly recommended for fans of World War II movies, and fans of John Wayne and Robert Mitchum.

555481,5,630305725X,"This movie was based on a hit 1959 book of the same name.  It came out in 1962, only 17 years after the war ended.  That would be like the movies being made now about the first Gulf War.  It was so recent that many of those soldiers being portrayed by actors in the film were not only advisors in the film, but given bit parts on screen, as well.  There are so many stars in the film (most of whom would be unknown to those under 40 or so unless they are film buffs) that you can have fun playing a kind of ""star bingo"".  Because so much material is covered in this film, nearly all of the roles are small with some being no more than cameo appearances.  But hey, they got in the biggest film about the biggest event of their lifetime!

Remember, this film captures the triumphalist spirit of the allies that I knew growing up.  It was pre-Kennedy assassination, pre-Vietnam (we were just getting into it as ""advisors""), pre-Watergate, and pre- the kind of pervasive cynicism our culture suffers with today.  Nor was it burdened with the faux sophistication of constant irony (you know, so you can avoid being accused of actually believing in something).

This is a very intelligently done film.  It captures the massiveness of the invasion and actually mixes in a bit of footage from the war, and is intense enough to get the idea across without the fear of traumatizing the kids you want to teach about the war.  Sure, ""Saving Private Ryan"" has more intense fighting sequences, but is it a better movie?  I don't think so.  And I still fear showing that open half hour to even my older children.  This movie, though three hours long, moves quite rapidly.  I also enjoyed that the Nazis are not portrayed as stereotypes.  All the characters speak in their own language as appropriate (with subtitles).  That is, there are times when they do speak English when English is called for.

I recommend this film to anyone who hasn't seen it and that those familiar with the events, watch it with their kids and grandkids.  Feel free to pause it along the way to talk about what is happening, because they won't pick up on everything.  Remember, the film was done for the generation that lived through it, so the movie didn't need a lot of exposition.  You will have to provide some of that for the younger generations.

555482,4,630305725X,"The story of the D-Day landings in Normandy in 1944, this 1962 black and white war classic sprawls across the screen and across its three hours with such intensity and realism that it is hard to maintain any kind of viewer objectivity about it. Considering that World War Two had ended only seventeen years prior to its release (and D-Day had occurred only 18 years earlier), the film has a kind of ""You Are There"" immediacy that is simply lacking from World War II films nowadays.

THE LONGEST DAY stars everyone, or perhaps it's more appropriate to say everyone appears in it---42(!) actors are credited on the theatrical poster, but the real ""star"" is D-Day itself. A tremendous ensemble cast of British, French, German and American film stars, ranging from the about-to-be-famous Sean Connery, Gert Frobe (later the Goldfinger of GOLDFINGER), teen idols like Fabian and Tab Hunter, war film stalwarts like Bernard Law and John Wayne, and diverse performers like Red Buttons and Robert Mitchum, make up the front line of THE LONGEST DAY, along with about 10,000 extras. The film required four directors, one each for each nationality represented.

A little sanitized for viewer comfort, this film nonetheless does succeed in encapsulating June 6, 1944, its horrors and its heroics. The ""easy"" landings on Gold and Juno Beaches are counterpoised to the near-disaster that was Omaha Beach; the American paratroopers' exection deaths at Ste.-Mere- Eglise are rendered honestly but not gratuitously; the fear, shock and dire realization of the Germans is palpable; the moments of irony (such as a Frenchman appearing on the beach to toast the liberators with champagne) lighten the mood at random moments.

Is it perfect? No. For one, THE LONGEST DAY is really not long enough. A series of snapshot-newsreels, it examples the day but can't capture it in depth (but could any film do that?) For another, this huge project stops so abruptly that it causes the viewer vertigo. Day's over---Film's over! A ten second crawl describing the subsequent liberation of Europe would have anchored the film in real time.

These small flaws hardly detract from this gargantuan effort, which is a classic of its genre and a valuable history lesson, to boot.",1188086400,10,2242,5.051351351351351

555551,5,630305725X,"This is one of the most exceptional, brilliantly mounted WWII films ever made.  It tells in very realistic, meticulous detail about the invasion of Normandy from all sides (American, German, French, British, etc., etc..).  There are a lot of big stars in this film, but they never becomes gratuitous.  Since the stars are playing real people, you don't ever go ""look, there's John Wayne, there's Robert Mitchum!"".  There are always inevitable comparisons to Saving Private Ryan, but this film trounces that one.  First, this film details ALL sides of the Normandy invasion, not just the American one.  Ryan gave the impression (perhaps erroneously) that only Amercians invaded on D-Day (which is so incredibly false).  This film doesn't have the graphic violence of Ryan, but it doesn't really shy away from the brutality, boredom, horror, and anger of war either.  It just doesn't wallow in violence.  And by showing all the aspects of the invasion, you get an incredible sense of the planning and the sheer scope of the invasion, and how it's incredible that the Allied forces pulled it off so well.  The Germans here aren't portrayed as caricatures, but as humans who are losing the war and are trying desperately to retain some dignity in the face of defeat.  Another great touch here is the film is in several different languages, contributing even more to its authenticity.  Normally, big budget epics like this would all be in English, especially today.  The film is remarkably cohesive considering there were 3 directors on it, but the reason is because of its producer, Darryl F. Zanuck (who fought in WWII as well).  This is HIS film.  He was the main creative source behind it, and it shows.  Zanuck was one of the great old Hollywood producers, like David O. Selznick, Samuel Bronston, and Irving G. Thalberg, who all had their own distinctive touch on the films they produced.  They were as much the auteurs as directors are, but they rarely get credit for it.

555554,4,630305725X,"'The Longest Day' is June 6, 1944, the day the Allied assault on Hitler's Fortress Europe... And when it came everything went much according to plan... But fighting through the tough country of Normandy took much longer than had been expected...

Dwight D. Eisenhower, the four-star Supreme Commander of the Allied Expeditionary Forces, made up the force of some two million men massed in England for the strike at Europe...

Combined American, British, Irish and Canadian forces assault the beaches of Normandy in an effort to gain a foothold on the continent... From the viewpoint of the Americans and Germans involved, the story unfolds through numerous episodes highlighting the 'Longest Day.' We see the commands posts occupied by the Germans; Caen, the starting point; the French underground network; Omaha Beach; Utah Beach; Ste-Mre-glise; as well as sites and camps in England...

The film is a clear examination of D-Day looked at from almost every viewpoint, particularly from that of the Germans who are overwhelmed by the forces brought against them... It is in fact Field Marshal Erwin Rommel (profiled against the French beach thoroughly planted with mined obstacles) who looks out to where the invasion fleet will appear later-or sooner, and gives the film its title: ""The first 24 hours of the invasion will be decisive... For the Allies as well as the Germans, it will be the longest day.""

In the first half, much attention is focused on the weather, as the troops... American, British, Irish, Canadian and French are poised on board their boats and ships, waiting for the rain to stop... In the key scene when Gen. Eisenhower (David Grace), makes the decision to go ahead with the invasion on June 6, more than 5,000 ships moved to assigned positions... The importance of time is emphasized by increasing the ticking of a clock... On the other side of the channel, the German generals, who know the invasion is imminent, see the same nasty weather and decide to take some time off for war games...

French Resistance fighters receive their coded instructions from BBC radio and increase their sabotage activities... Much of the early going is also devoted to some of the Allies' more unorthodox ideas, the kinds of things that make more sense cinematic ally than militarily: the use of metal clickers by paratroopers for identification, and parachuting mechanical dummies loaded with firecrackers behind German lines to create confusion...

The film reaches its peak when the two sides in the battle are finally engaged...

The first assault wave hit the Normandy beaches at 6:30 A.M. on June 6... The soil of France looked sordid and uninviting... Planning has been as complete as possible, but in the vast confusion of invasion under enemy fire, so many men fell uselessly when they left their landing craft, and stepped into water... Others fell into underwater shell craters and drowned...

The Allied air bombing that was to have knocked out German beach defense guns had not been accurate, especially on Omaha Beach where the bombs had been laid down too far inland to do much good... As a result, the gunfire that met American troops there was more murderous than anything they had been prepared for..

Today it is difficult to watch the invasion scenes and not compare them to the opening of Steven Spielberg's 'Saving Private Ryan,' but that really is unfair... Zanuck manages to display the image of thousands of young soldiers who were killed fighting to liberate France...

A long aerial shot from the point of view of a German pilot Josef 'Pips' Priller (Heinz Reincke) strafing Normandy Beach reveals a shore-line of successive waves of men running for their lives trying to secure Omaha Beach... This awful waste and destruction of war: scores of trucks and boats hit by shells, or sunk by mines with their crew lost... Trucks overturned and swamped, partly sunken barges, and many jeeps half submerged...

Field Marshal Rommel set to work to do everything possible to make the beaches if not impregnable, very uninviting indeed... 'The war will be won or lost on the beaches,' he states... The German command was slow to react to the invasion... They had been misled by the weather and the Allied deception plan that Normandy was a diversion and the main landing would be at Pas-de-Calais...

Shot in CinemaScope and in black-and-white, 'The Longest Day' captures the history of the moment... The film tracks the book very closely, shifting the viewpoints from German to French to American to British throughout... In three hours Zanuck and his staff expand on the scope of one day, to tell mostly everything, with an exceptionally strong cast playing cameo roles... The cast could not be better, in spite of the brevity of their roles:

- Bourvil is the French Mayor of Colleville who welcomes the British soldiers with a bottle of champagne...

- Irina Demick is Janine Boitard, the sexy good-looking Resistance member...

- Henry Fonda is Theodore Roosevelt Jr., the Brigadier General who limps ashore with the first of the assault boats landing on Utah Beach...

- Christian Marquand is Philippe Kieffer, the French Commander in desperate situation in Ouistreham...

- Robert Mitchum is Norman Cota, the Brigadier general who chops on his cold cigar, and walks along the beach and rallies his men... Mitchum gets some great lines and delivers them with the right amount of idealism and cynicism...

- Richard Todd is John Howard, the major who lands by glider at Bnouville to capture the canal bridge over the Orne River...

All the characters speak in their own languages... The motion picture is Winner of two Academy Awards for Cinematography and Special Effects, Zanuck's 'The Longest Day' is one without doubt an absolutely remarkable film, one of the most impressive and most authentic documentation of war ever put on film...",1168041600,14,5871,5.015416238437822

555557,5,630305725X,"Come on, this has to be the movie against which all other ""war movies"" are measured!!  This was 1960's Hollywood loving tribute to the sacrifices made by the men of the Allied armies, who liberated France by making it across the English Channel and surviving one of the bloodiest days in history.

Every star who could be in this movie was in it -- John Wayne, Sean Connery, Richard Burton, Fabian!!  The special effects were laborious and the directing often magnificent.  (The long sequence by which the Free French attack a German Stronghold stands with the best movie shots of all time.)  Hollywood used ""all of its skills"" to make this one of the great epics of all time.  Even the score is instantly recognizable.

The movie itself is based upon Cornelius Ryan's book of the same name -- and that may be the primary frustration for newer generations of movie watchers who see this movie for the first time.  Ryan's book is anecdotal, focusing upon individual stories -- there are some loose efforts to explain the overall situation to the movie goer, but the DDay story was so ingrained in the group awareness of the Free World that a great deal of back ground knowledge was simply taken for granted.

I recall picking up the book upon which the movie was based at the library before the movie came out -- not knowing what D Day was (I was pretty young).  And when I say that I did not know what D Day was, that was literally true, I did not understand the term -- which had become a socialogical shorthand taken for granted by generations of americans.  I remember attempting to look it up in dictionaries, in all sorts of non fiction books -- finally some footnote explained that there was an H Hour and and M minute, and the light bulb went on.

So, for viewers born after 1980 or so, enjoy the film for what it is -- a munificent love letter to the soldiers of WWII -- pick up Stephen Ambrose on DDay before or after if you need a context and enjoy.",1167091200,2,1959,4.441340782122905
555558,3,630305725X,"Not only it is not, this movie has aged badly over the years. And I don't mean just its special effects, which were the best at the time but now look understandably dated. I mean the picture itself; the attitude it reflects.

Soldiers fall nicely in bloodless deaths. Grenades only kill when needed, enemies fire only when you keep your head down, dirt only stains your cheeks, and wounds mean only scratches and cuts, not gory carnage. There is no pain or terror; no one cries in agony, grief or desperation.

No one kills civilians, not even nazis, not even by accident. There's your standard scared kid, or the classic Brooklyn wiseguy among the grunts to be sure, but every officer is a ""Father-knows-best"" square-jawed tough hombre. Germans always yell on the phone, whether in anger or affection, and all Frenchmen belong to the Resistance; their girls flirting like sluts. No kidding. And talk about the All-Star cast!:

Robert Mitchum storms the beaches of Normandy as the quarterback of a football team. John Wayne delivers his tiresome lines on automatic cowboy. Richard Beymer has to verbalize everything he sees, feels or thinks, just to spare you the effort of figuring it all by yourself. Sean Connery, Roddy McDowell, Red Buttons, Rod Steiger and Richard Burton compete each other for the Ham-Of-The-Year Award in the brief cameos they're given. Even thespians you don't see overdo it: that ""hold until relieved"" order, for instance, keeps changing its intonation everytime time it's echoed in the paratrooper's head (the actor then makes a face accordingly). And every once in a while there's the Deep Thought, mused over by someone with eyes wide open in Revelation.

In short, it is a big movie, but a bad one. Badly done, badly played and badly written. Cornelius Ryan may have been a good journalist but he certainly wasn't a good screenwriter. His script tells you more about old Hollywood than what World War II was like.

Time has nothing to do with the movie's dated look. ""Is Paris Burning?"" -in many respects a clone of ""The Longest Day""- was filmed shortly after. So was ""Patton"" a few years later. The former has aged horribly as well, if not more; the latter remains present. Both were written by the same fellow, young Francis Ford Coppola. His next movie would be ""The Godfather"".

Authenticity is the hallmark of this enormous production (although some of the equipment shown didn't come on line until AFTER June 1944), with each character representing an actual participant in the battle---American, French, British, and German. Oh, and this was one of the first Hollywood movies in which German soldiers weren't portrayed as savages, arrogant warmongers, or sadistic brutes (one can really sympathize with Curt Jurgens' General Blumentritt, who knows what needs to be done but can't get the Nazi hierarchy to listen).

  Minor quibbles: It would have been nice if the extra features had had more in-depth information about the historical invasion, including its strategic context.

""The Longest Day"" has two commentaries: one by Historian Mary Corey and another by Director Ken Annakin(one of the five directors of the film.) All three feature a ""History through the lens"" featurette about each one of the films and how they recreated the event(s) portrayed in the movie. They are narrated by Burt Reynolds. ""TLD"" has an episode of AMC's Backstory series about the making of ""TLD"". Another feature on ""TLD"" is a 1968 documentary called ""D-Day Revisited"",which shows,in technicolor, the real places where the invasion of Normandy happened, accompanied by segments of the movie that portray the battles that happened there. A still photo gallery, a featurette called ""A Day to Remember"",a five-minute featurette called ""Richard Zannuck Remembers 'TLD'"", and ""TLD""'s original theatrical trailer wrap up the DVD's special features, making this special edition special.

  This film received five Oscar nominations, including Best Picture, two of which(Best B",1154390400,5,1297,5.348039215686274

555598,5,630305725X,"As it is with many such movies, the first of its type is the best.  In a documentary style the story of the D-Day invasion is told with possibly the greatest cast ever assembled and yet there is no star to this movie.  This was tried again years later in ""A Bridge Too Far"" but not as well.  Each of these great actors and actresses come to the screen and bring to life a true historical figure.  In some ways it is done with a reverence rto the person portrayed.  It is amazing that this great invasion of Europe went as well as it did.  This is brought out in the movie that despite the carefullest planning of men, Battle is often won by factors of chance that no one could forsee.  To those who have watched ""Saving Private Ryan"" and feel they know how the battle was, watch this movie to see historical truths.",1149206400,4,815,4.219354838709678
555599,5,630305725X,"This commentary is about the technical aspects of this release.  In this 2000 edition, TWENTIETH CENTURY FOX produced a digitally remastered video resulting in a crisp, clean master with sharp contrast.  Best of all, they placed the German and French subtitles in the lower ""black bar"" area provided though letterboxing.  This makes a BIG difference and provides a gratifying viewing experience for an almost 3 hour movie.

Though not historically correct in just a couple of scenes, it is for the most part right on target.  Because of studio self-censuring, this movie is purposely devoid of blood and gore that the butchery of war brings.  But sometimes blood drenched beaches and hillsides can be a bit gratuitous and the movie's objective can be made without such scenes, as is with this movie.",1148947200,10,799,5.015151515151516

The multiple directors seamlessly piece together the events leading up and to the invasion at Normandy.  My problem with the film is twofold. I can't help but think that if the film had a singular artistic vision that it would resonate more with me.  Instead of feeling like a first person witness to the events of D-Day I feel like I'm watching a re-enactment.  Secondly, there are too many characters here to get an emotional involvement with.  Blink and you'll miss Richard Burton, Sean Connery, Henry Fonda et al.  Honestly, the most fully developed characters here are the German ones.  If the film focused on fewer characters and we got to know their backstory, like in ""Saving Private Ryan"", then we would have more of an emotional investment to them.  In the end what we are essentially left with is a lot of gunfire and explosions.",1148860800,6,916,4.68125

Examples of the latter include the corpse of the German soldier with boots on the wrong foot, the German general's admission that the day of the invasion would be the longest day for not only the Allied invaders but also the Germans, the Frenchman toasting the impending Allied invasion while shells are exploding everywhere and his house is being turned into a shambles, and the German Werner Pluskatt (sp?) being told by the German command over the field phone that the Allies don't have nearly as many guns as Pluskatt is seeing with his own eyes, bearing down on his very position along the coast.",1148515200,18,687,4.781512605042017
555671,5,630305725X,"Here we have the consummate of all war movies of the D-Day invasion of Normandy in WWII in a 2-disc release.

Disk 2 bonus features include - A Day To Remember; Longest Day: A Salute to Courage; Backstory - The Longest Day; D-Day Revisted; Richard Zannuck on The Longest Day and a Still Gallery, all well worth owning this release.

However, in 2000 when FOX released a new digital but non-anamorphic transfer, they wisely placed the German and French subtitles in the lower ""black bar"" area left vacant due to the letterbox format, making for a very pleasant viewing experience.  In this release the subtitles are restored back onto the main body of the film.  As the text is white and the film being B&W, this makes for a very fatiguing 3 hours of viewing.  Sometimes the text just disappears in the white portions of the film.

***Mini update!  As someone politely pointed out, with newer HI-DEF 16 x 9 widescreen TV's, the subtitle text would disappear with the non-anamorphic 2000 version.  As HDTV has superb color and grayscale resolution, this is probably a moot point.  As I and many are still waiting for HDTV prices to come down & the technology to go up, it may be advantageous to own both sets.

Otherwise a great movie portraying a fairly realistic look at that fateful day of June 6, 1944. Filmed appropriately in Black & White with complementing WWII stock footage. This is a film for the whole family as it truly does represent the carnage of war without the blood and gore that can disturb some viewers (like myself).",1147132800,142,1535,4.651851851851852

While there is action in this movie that is not really the point.  The point of the movie is to show the PEOPLE involved in the war from both the Allied and German sides.  Seeing Field Marshal Rommel talk about the first 24 hours of the invasion makes you realize that human beings made up both armies.

The movie is based on an excellent book by Cornelius Ryan.  Highly recommended as well.",1145232000,9,563,4.365384615384615
555674,5,630305725X,"The first time I saw ""The Longest Day"" in a movie theater they got a couple of the reels mixed up. The only way I knew this was that every time a major figure shows up in the film we are told their name, rank and unit. This mistake did not hurt the film all that much because this sprawling story of the D-Day invasion sixty years ago today was so huge and complex that it had four directors: Ken Annakin (British scenes), Andrew Marton (American scenes) Bernhard Wicki (German scenes), and the uncredited Darryl F. Zanuck. Granted, the realism of the opening scenes of ""Saving Private Ryan"" make the storming of Omaha Beach in this 1962 film look like a walk on the beach in comparison, but ""The Longest Day"" remains along with ""Battleground"" one of the most realistic portrayals of what it was like for the infantry in World War II from what we will know have to call the old school Hollywood and which ended with ""A Bridge Too Far"" in 1977.

Based on Cornelius Ryan's celebrated book of the same title, ""The Longest Day"" is almost three hours long and has one of the largest all star casts every assembled (42 international stars according to the poster), albeit with big names like John Wayne, Henry Fonda, Robert Mitchem, Richard Burton, and Rod Steiger playing supporting roles because, to tell the truth, there is nothing else to play in this film. If you are telling the story of D-Day, no single figure is going to emerge as the star, which is the point (Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower, played by an uncredited Henry Grace, has one scene). Sean Connery was about to become famous as James Bond in ""Dr. No,"" and familiar faces include Red Buttons, Curt Jrgens, Edmond O'Brien, Kenneth More, Robert Ryan, Robert Wagner, Eddie Albert, Roddy McDowell, Peter Lawford, George Segal, Gert Frbe, and Jeffrey Hunter. The idea of throwing in teen idols like Paul Anka, Fabian, Sal Mineo and Tommy Sands makes sense because a generation earlier they would have been storming the beaches of Normandy. However, you might have a hard time picking up the likes of Richard Dawson and Bernard Fox in the crowd. Several minor players in the film were involved in D-Day, and the piper playing as Lord Lovat's commandos storm ashore is the man himself, Bill Millin. The key thing is that the story being told is so big that it gobbles up all the stars.

The film shows events on both sides of the English Channel both before and during D-Day. On the side of the Allies there is the bad weather, troops tired from being on constant alert for several days, and the sheer size and importance of what is about to happen. Meanwhile the Germans are confident the Allies will attack at Calais and certainly wait for better weather, which explains why the key commanders are away from the front. One of the strengths of this film is that it also tells the story from the German's side. Not only do we get necessary exposition and explication concerning German troop movements before and during June 6, 1944, but there is also the human element of Maj. Werner Pluskat (Hans Christian Blech), the guy sitting on the Atlantic Wall who looks out one morning and suddenly sees the Allied invasion fleet when the fog lifts and we hear the ""da da da daaah"" of Beethoven's 5th (it is also Morse Code for ""V,"" used to denote ""Victory"" by the Allies). It is Field Marshal Erwin Rommel (Werner Hinz) himself who calls the coming battle ""the longest day."" There are also the efforts of the French Resistance (""Wounds my heart with a monotonous languor"") and French troops in helping to free their own country as well as the British efforts, so this is not just the Americans versus the Germans.

There are several sequences that stand out, most notably the paratroopers of the 101st Airborne landing directly into Ste. Mre-Eglise and being butchered by German troops. The shots of a a terrified and helpless Red Buttons stuck on a church steeple are probably the most memorable in the film, as is the reaction of John Wayne's colonel when he sees the carnage and orders the bodies be cut down. The assault on the cliffs at Omaha also stands out, with Mitchem sending a series of men off to their deaths trying to blow a hole open to get the troops off the beach. Again, there is not the bloody carnage of Spielerg's ""Saving Private Ryan,"" but the scene still retains an emotional power even by contemporary war movie standards.

""The Longest Day"" was the most expensive black & white film ever made until ""Schindler's List"" in 1993 and in both instances not using color works; after all, our ""memory"" of World War II is based on black & white images. The DVD has some solid extras, with ""Hollywood Backstory: The Longest Day"" providing a 25-minute documentary on the making of the film, focusing primarily on Zanuck and a 50-minute documentary on ""D-Day Revisited,"" while offers the rather strange sight of Zanuck telling strangers about D-Day and providing historical commentary mixed with clips from the film. In addition to the trailer for ""The Longest Day"" you get those for ""Tora! Tora! Tora!"" (certainly a comparable film), ""Patton,"" and ""The Thin Red Line.""

Certainly ""The Longest Day"" is one of the best World War II films, even if we now have to talk about it as representing the old school of that genre. At some point, given the success of ""Saving Private Ryan"" and the early chapters of ""Band of Brothers,"" I would expect that someone is going to again try and do the macro view of D-Day. But clearly the next time around it is going to take a mini-series or limited series format to come up with something grander than this 1962 film.",1143158400,144,5612,4.636180904522613

555676,5,630305725X,"The Longest Day is an exciting and mostly historicly accurate movie that will fit nicely with any WWII movie collection. It tells the invasion of Normandy from many different perspectives. It follows the American, British, German and French forces through the beach and airborn landings. The shore landings are on a massive scale with hundreds of soldiers swarming the beaches. The paratroopers perspective shows the confusion of the whole attack as the U.S. airborn divisions landed all over the countryside and were seperated from their groups. The British troops are shown at the begining of the invasion landing by glider and raiding a bridge key to the sucess of the invasion that the German forces are preparing to destroy. It then moves on the the airborn landings and the American, British, and French invasion forces landing on the beaches. The German perspective is mostly the commanders trying to make sense of the neverending stream of reports about paratroopers, allied navy, decoys, and their inability to launch their Panzer devisions because Hitler went to sleep and was not to be awaken. The name of the movie says a lot as well, as this is a very long movie (three hours), requiring the viewer to have a good attention span to watch it from beginning to end. Some of the beach landing scenes are just five or more minutes of soldiers charging up the beach with no sounds other than constant explosions and gunfire. However, the length of the movie is necessary to show the battle from all sides. This is definitely one of my favorite war movies of all time and has most of the historical facts in place.",1133049600,11,1621,4.83453237410072

555678,2,630305725X,"This may well be Hollywood's definitive D-day movie. It may be a classic. It may feature an unbelievably star studed cast.... but its still boring as watching paint dry.

The movie does indeed take in many important persectives of the D Day ladings, but in doing so the plot reads more like a documentary than a narrative, and as such it fails to really grab attention. Which makes it all the more tempting to fast forward through the many tedious and slow moving scenes that fall in between the action.

There is far too much dead time in this movie. Characters pause for dramatic effect where there's little to be gained, their dialogue is often expositional and pedestrian and their reaction times to dramatic events (including getting shot) are unbelievably slow.

While there's a need to illustrate the sense of suspense preceeding the invasion, there is a limit to how many pregnant pauses you can take in the course of a 3 hour movie....

Once the action gets started it's entertaining enough (barring the insertion of further dramatic pauses), but clearly not up to the level of violent realism of Private Ryan - soldiers getting shot have a tendency to freeze in motion (more pauses...) and then fall in the direction the bullets have come from, etc. I'm sure that for their time the special effects are pretty good, and the scale of the scenes is admittedly spectacular, but lets face it its still black and white, pre-CGI stuff.

This movie could be compressed to half its running time without the viewer missing much (except lots of pauses and a few redundant characters and sub plots....). I'd be happy to have this on in the background on a rainy Sunday afternoon but I wouldn't recommend watching it from beginning to end...",1122595200,3,1739,4.764119601328904
555679,4,630305725X,"""The Longest Day"" is a telling of the invasion of Normandy that depicts the horror of war, the viewpoints of the leaders and the grunts, the chaos inherent in battle, the fog of war and, especially, the complexity of an operation of this scale. It does each of these things well.

There is no real story to this movie beyond that of the landings themselves. It starts slightly before them and ends with the push off of Omaha Beach. Instead of trying to give some grand narrative, it concentrate instead on indiviual vignettes that make up the whole.

The movie is filled with stars of the first rank but none of them really star in the movie. Instead, they all have cameos and play their parts. Like the battle itself, the success is made from the combined efforts of all those parts.

It is not only the US point of view that is depicted. So to are those of the British, French and the Nazis. The story unfolds in chronological order and we get to see the things that went wrong as well as those that went right on both sides of the battle.

For an overall view of the landings on D-Day, this movie cannot be beat. The graphic nature of later films such as ""Saving Private Ryan"" do a better job in depicting the nature of the landings themselves but do not tell the grand story like this one does. Each has its place. The place of this one is at the top.",1115251200,3,1355,4.301960784313725

I have not seen another movie do a better job.  This is more a movie for lovers of history and war.  I wouldn't recommend it for those who liked ""A Thin Red Line"" or ""Platoon"".  It doesn't have much self reflection or moments of doubt.  It is very matter of fact and in your face.  This is a great movie to learn the back story behind ""Saving Private Ryan"" if you don't know much about the Normandy Invasion. So set aside about three hours to watch it this Memorial Day and realize what the Greatest Generation had to overcome to liberate a continent.",1111795200,2,866,4.276073619631902
555731,5,630305725X,"Featuring a stellar international cast including Eddie Albert ( Col. Thompson), Richard Burton (RAF Officer David Campbell), Red Buttons (Pvt. John Steele), Sean Connery (Pvt. Flanagan), Henry Fonda (Brig. Gen. Theodore Roosevelt), Robert Mitchum (Brig. Gen. Norman Cota), and John Wayne (Lt. Col. Benjamin Vandervoort), this fine movie takes a look at the D-day invasion from both the Allied and German perspectives.

Cornelius Ryan, who wrote a book by the same title, was brought in to write the screenplay for this movie, and he divides the film into three parts.  Part one, ""the wait"", focuses on the days before the actual invasion.  The weather leading up to the invasion date had been very stormy, with the English Channel experiencing some of its worst weather in over twenty years.  The Allies were faced with a dilema; to invade during such terrible weather, or postpone the invasion and wait for better weather, which, according to Allied weather forecasters, wasn't supposed to happen until July.  The decision was made by General Eisenhower and his staff to invade despite the terrible conditions.  On the German side, they were convinced that the invasion was going to occur at Pas-De-Calais, not Normandy, so their initial preparations focused on that area.

Part two, ""the night"", focused on the airborne drop behind German lines.  The objective was to cause confusion among the German troops while destroying some key initial points.  The air drop scenes are extremely well-done in the film.

Finally, part three, ""the day"", focuses on the invasion itself.  One scene of the movie that is very vivid is a German officer looking out over the Channel and seeing nothing but water, and then minutes later, the Allied invasion fleet appeared.  The landings and battle scenes on the beaches are very well done, although much of the blood and gore is nonexistant in this movie, unlike ""Saving Private Ryan"", where the landings are much more graphic.  Despite this omission, the battle scenes are very good, particularly the scenes of the American troops climbing the cliffs using nothing but rope and grappling hooks.  Another exciting scene is when the Americans use their Banglor Torpedoes to overrun a German obstacle which was holding up the American advance.

The acting in this movie is very good, but John Wayne and Robert Mitchum give perhaps the best performances of all.  I especially liked Mitchum's line of ""There are only two kinds of men on this beach, those that are dead, and those that are going to die"". Wayne's character of Col. Vandervoort, who suffered a compound fracture of his ankle while parachuting in but still walked despite the injury, was another of my favorites.

This is an excellent movie.  Although it is a little long at 178 minutes, it does a very good job of covering the events leading up to and the invasion itself.  I give this movie my highest recommendation.  The historical accuracy is very good and the story is told with attention paid to both the Allied and German sides.  Watch and see why The Longest Day ranks as one of Hollywood's greatest war films.",1108684800,5,3112,4.980657640232108
555732,4,630305725X,"A grand blockbuster in the great old Hollywood tradition, ""The Longest Day"" successfully tackles the intimidating concept of covering the June 6, 1944, D-Day invasion of Normandy, the turning point of WWII, from all sides concerned:  The French Resistance, the German occupiers, the RAF, the Americans, and others who had a part in what went on in throwing the yoke of Nazi tyranny off of western Europe.  The fact that it's done with few noticeable loose ends is a testament to what a labor of love this project was for mogul Darryl F. Zanuck and company.

Other reviews on this page do an excellent job of detailing what this film is all about and why it is great.  In fact, the NY Times lists it as one of the 1000 best films ever made.  In this era, almost a half-century after its creation, it's natural to think of more recent WWII films like ""Saving Private Ryan"" and its sister mini-series ""Band of Brothers,"" and BoB fans will be delighted to know that the 101st Airborne figures into this film fairly prominently as well.  The gut-wrenching taking of Omaha beach is expanded in ""The Longest Day,"" finally taking center stage for the whole picture here (if any part of D-Day could be said to truly be at center stage), whereas in SPR it was the setting of a phenomenal opening 20 minutes of that film.

One of the biggest hurdles to overcome for the first-time viewer of this film is the distraction of seeing some of the best-known actors of all time popping up in cameo roles.  Perfectly ubermacho guys like John Wayne and Robert Mitchum fit their leadership roles in this film as well as if no one else could have played their parts, and Wayne's magnetism triumphs in spite of how stilted some of his lines are written.  Richard Burton hams it up in a limited role as well, as does Sean Connery, and the momentous pronouncements by a number of characters in the film's first hour are spoken with a ""stage aside"" air that the art form has long since outgrown, but other than those moments any melodrama is certainly called for in this setting.

Further, a number of events portrayed here transcend the ""traditional blockbuster"" format that's been so often satirized over the years, as they strike the viewer as falling into the category of ""fact is stranger than fiction.""  A group of American paratroopers march past a wall with a group of Nazis marching the other direction on the other side of the wall; they can see each other's helmets over the wall, yet there is no confrontation since the GIs are the first insurgents of the invasion to come and neither side yet expects a confrontation.  A paratrooper hangs from the steeple of a church, his night drop interrupted by the architecture, and views the carnage of the battle below while the church bells ring all night and leave him at least temporarily deaf.  Brigadier General Theodore Roosevelt, Jr., played by Henry Fonda, convinces those in command to allow him to physically accompany his men to the taking of Utah Beach, stating that his arthritis isn't bothering him, then has to take a cane with him into battle.  And so forth for a great number of scenes.

Any fan of heroic war films, especially those in their 20s and 30s who've more recently been drawn toward the genre by the aforementioned Spielberg/Hanks productions and others, must see this film.  It's unique and a valuable addition to anyone's library in this regard.",1107302400,4,3403,4.684563758389261
555733,5,630305725X,"I grew up watching a lot of WWII movies.  Some were based on fact and plenty of others were based on fiction.  There don't seem to be too many WWII movies made anymore although great ones, such as ""Saving Private Ryan"", will surface from time to time.  A good debate would be deciding which WWII movie was the best of all-time.  Personally, I'd have to give a slight edge to ""Bridge on the River Kwai"" but surely ""The Longest Day"" should be on everyone's short list.  It has all of the elements of a great movie; excellent directing, acting, script, cinematography, sound, editing, special effects, you name it.

The movie, based on the excellent book by Cornelius Ryan, strives to be a sort of dramatic documentary.  The Germans speak German and the French speak French.  There are even seperate directors for the German, British, and American scenes.  I came to know a lot of German actors watching this movie.  With all of those directors, special kudos have to go to the editing department.  The camera work and the special effects help to achieve that sense of documentary (the black and white film helps as well).  The battle scenes are very realistic for its' time (pre-""Saving Private Ryan"").  There is one scene in particular, the assault on Ouistreham, in which an extended camera shot (From a helicopter, I presume) follows the evolving action continuously.  The fact that the whole scene was done in one shot is amazing.

The acting is outstanding and literally includes a cast of thousands.  There is a lengthly list of ""stars"" and the multiple stories within the movie gives all of them a meaningful amount of time on the screen.  It would be hard not to cite all of the preformances but I was particularly impressed with the acting of John Wayne and Robert Mitchum.

This is one fantastic movie and can be enjoyed by those who like action, those who like drama, and those who like history.  If you haven't seen it, don't miss it the next time it's on TV.

Zanuck.  Granted, the realism of the opening scenes of ""Saving Private Ryan"" make the storming of Omaha Beach in this 1962 film look like a walk on the beach in comparison, but ""The Longest Day"" remains along with ""Battleground"" one of the most realistic portrayals of what it was like for the infantry in World War II from what we will know have to call the old school Hollywood and which ended with ""A Bridge Too Far"" in 1977.
Based on Cornelius Ryan's celebrated book of the same title, ""The Longest Day"" is almost three hours long and has one of the largest all star casts every assembled (42 international stars according to the poster), albeit with big names like John Wayne, Henry Fonda, Robert Mitchem, Richard Burton, and Rod Steiger playing supporting roles because, to tell the truth, there is nothing else to play in this film.  If you are telling the story of D-Day, no single figure is going to emerge as the star, which is the point (Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower, played by an uncredited Henry Grace, has one scene).

Several minor players in the film were involved in D-Day, and the piper playing as Lord Lovat's commandos storm ashore is the man himself, Bill Millin.  The key thing is that the story being told is so big that it gobbles up all the stars.
The film shows events on both sides of the English Channel both before and during D-Day.  On the side of the Allies there is the bad weather, troops tired from being on constant alert for several days, and the sheer size and importance of what is about to happen.  Meanwhile the Germans are confident the Allies will attack at Calais and certainly wait for better weather, which explains why the key commanders are away from the front.  One of the strengths of this film is that it also tells the story from the German's side.  Not only do we get necessary exposition and explication concerning German troop movements before and during June 6, 1944, but there is also the human element of Maj. Werner Pluskat (Hans Christian Blech), the guy sitting on the Atlantic Wall who looks out one morning and suddenly sees the Allied invasion fleet when the fog lifts and we hear the ""da da da daaah"" of Beethoven's 5th (it is also Morse Code for ""V,"" used to denote ""Victory"" by the Allies).  It is Field Marshal Erwin Rommel (Werner Hinz) himself who calls the coming battle ""the longest day.""  There are also the efforts of the French Resistance (""Wounds my heart with a monotonous languor"") and French troops in helping to free their own country as well as the British efforts, so this is not just the Americans versus the Germans.
There are several sequences that stand out, most notably the paratroopers of the 101st Airborne landing directly into Ste. Mre-Eglise and being butchered by German troops.  The shots of a a terrified and helpless Red Buttons stuck on a church steeple are probably the most memorable in the film, as is the reaction of John Wayne's colonel when he sees the carnage and orders the bodies be cut down.  The assault on the cliffs at Omaha also stands out, with Mitchem sending a series of men off to their deaths trying to blow a hole open to get the troops off the beach.  Again, there is not the bloody carnage of Spielerg's ""Saving Private Ryan,"" but the scene still retains an emotional power even by contemporary war movie standards.
""The Longest Day"" was the most expensive black & white film ever made until ""Schindler's List"" in 1993 and in both instances not using color works; after all, our ""memory"" of World War II is based on black & white images.

(1) Contrary to the impression  that the Hollywood movie industry gives, the Americans and British did not defeat Germany alone.  Three-quarters of the strength of the German Wehrmacht was destroyed by the Soviet Union.  I realize that this film was made a the height of the cold war, but still some mention should have been made of their contribution to victory.
(2) The most impressive part of Overlord were the meticulous preparations made.  Some mention of it was made, but more of it should have been shown, such as the various special weapons and ships that were made to ease the assault on the fortified beaches. Archive film could have been easily procured to show the various devices used to clear mine fields and barbed wire.
Most crucial was the development of the ""Mulberry"" artificial ports.
(3)  This film used several Germans as advisors such as Blumentritt who were in the Wehrmacht High Command.  They use this film as a vehicle for pushing the now largely discredited line that ""if only Hitler had let the Generals run the war, they would have won it for him"", and the also the myth that they opposed Hitler and held nothing but contempt for him (von Rundstedt calls Hitler ""that Bohemian Corporal"" in the film).  In reality they were all very loyal to him and they really strongly supported him and his criminal policies when they were winning the war.
(4)  The importance of the deception campaign making the Germans think the assault will be at the Pas de Calais and not a Normandy was very important and continued even after the landing on D-Day to make the Germans think Normandy was just a diversion.
This was not mentioned.  A whole ""virtual army"" was created with fake radio traffic opposite Calais.  This could have been shown as well.

555832,5,630305725X,"Just a quick note here in responce to the ""spotlight review"" by sixtiesuniverse.
  In correctly praising The Longest Day, you saw fit to critize Spielbergs Pvt. Ryan. I find the claim that Ryan lacked substance almost laughable,and that TLD was loaded with substance not very accurate.
  First, we really shouldnt compare these two films as they are very different, not only in the technology but in their messages and goals. Yes some of both seep over to the other, but not for a fair comparison.
  TLD was not as much a movie of deep substance as it was a grand reinactment of a very historical battle. Zanuck decided to tell the whole story of D-Day in much the same manner as Cornileus Ryan had written the history. This he did brilliantly, and the film to this day is a marvel to watch and a great national history lesson.
  SPR on the other hand was about the very personnal sacrifice, and answer to the call made by the young men who hit those beaches and jumped into that night sky. Yes, Spielberg had great EFX, and used them well in the harrowing opening of the film, as well as all the other battle scenes. But the fact that there was rarely a dry eye in the theatre at the end, tells me his emotional goals were met, and we got a little better understanding of the sacrifice.
  Brilliant....this word applies to both of these great achievments in film making and in departing history to those of us not old enough to remember.",1085011200,5,1438,4.475095785440613
555833,5,630305725X,"Take your ""Saving Private Ryans"", your ""Big Red Ones"", your ""Band of Brothers""', put them together; they'll never match the excitement and apparent authenticity of this 1962 gem.  Unlike ""Ryan"", which followed a powerful subplot, ""TLD"" relies on the experiences of the average soldiers, the resistance fighters, and leaders (both Nazi and Allied) in a chronological retelling of the D-Day Invasion itself.  Eisenhower is seen making the final decision to invade; Rommel leavinig Normandy because he knows the Allies would never land in the rain.  In other words, this film tells the whole story, American, British Commonwealth, German, and French.  Those who complain that this seems too broad a brush with which to paint would be surprised at how well Zanuck knit the various scenes together, in part because of the comeraderie built among the allied troops and their leaders.
It is true that ""Ryan"" showed a bloodier, and therefore probably more war-like, beach landing, but once again this is due to different motives:  Speilberg's, to bring our emotion around the suffering of the main characters; Zanuck et al to show the events of the war in a human context, without being glib.  And the black and white shots make it more family-friendly.
""Patriotic"" films, especially from former decades, tend to portray the enemy as cartoonish or monstrous; TLD is not one of those films.  The German characters are portrayed as human; their place in the film seems to illustrate the tragic mistakes their leaders have made in their plans, not to show us how ""bad"" Germans were. (This was not a film designed to explore the horrors of the Nazis' extracurricular activities; but it does not give a sense of avoiding them).
The French and German characters speak French and German, not English with French and German accents, and not bad French and German.  In many cases German actors portray the Nazi leaders and soldiers at the beach.
And who can beat this film for it's star-studded glory?  Henry Fonda, John Wayne, Sal Mineo, Eddie Albert, Paul Anka as a Ranger scaling Pointe du Hoc, Sean Connery, Richard Burton...Red Buttons has the unenviable job of playing paratrooper John Stele, 101st Airborne, who ended up with his chute caught on a church steeple, German gunfire all around him.  (The church in Ste. Mere Eglise still has a ""dummy"" chutist hanging there to memorialize Steele, who died in 1969, as well as stained glass windows telling the chutists' story). In one of the neatest twists, British D-Day vet Richard Todd, a screenstar there, plays Maj. Richard Howard.  One wonders where Brigadier General Jimmy Stewart was at casting time...maybe he was already too busy with ""Cheyenne Autumn"" or ""How the West Was Won."" Regardless, if you like American film from this era, you're sure to find one or two of your favorite male actors here.

555837,5,630305725X,"D-Day, June 6, 1944, indeed turned out to be a long day for many soldiers from many nations as the Allies landed on the beaches at Normandy. The scope of the invasion was incredible: 5,000 ships of all sizes (ranging from battleships to landing craft), 200,000 assault troops from 4 Allied countries, 11,000 planes, 13,000 paratroopers, and as Brig. Gen. Norman Cota (Robert Mitchum) says early on in this very expensive film, ""God knows how many gliders,"" participated in history's greatest amphibious operation.
Darryl F. Zanuck's The Longest Day, based on the book by Cornelius Ryan (who wrote the screenplay), takes its title from a quote by German Field Marshal Erwin Rommel (Werner Hinz), ""Believe me, gentlemen, the first 24 hours of the invasion will be decisive. For the Allies as well as the Germans, it will be the longest day..."". It has a huge cast, including 48 major stars from four different countries, and until Steven Spielberg's 1993 Schindler's List, it was the most expensive black and white movie ever made at a cost of $8,000,000 (in 1962 dollars). Additionally, 23,000 soldiers from three NATO countries were used as extras for the huge battle scenes.
The Longest Day covers the events of June 5-6, 1944 as the Germans and Allies prepare for the long awaited invasion of France. We see the Germans desperately fortifying the northern coast of France with mines, obstacles, pillboxes, and lots of barbed wire to prevent any Allied soldiers from setting foot on the beaches. They also intercept the coded messages from Britain to the French underground that will alert the Resistance that the invasion is 24 hours away. However, they don't know where the landings will take place; their logic tells them that the Allies will attack at the Pas de Calais, the closest point between England and the Continent.
Little do they know that even as Rommel heads back to Germany to spend leave with his wife and son (June 6 was Frau Rommel's birthday), thousands of British and American paratroopers, including Lt. Col. Benjamin Vandervoort (John Wayne) are preparing for a risky night drop to secure the flanks of the five beach invasion area. The invasion has already been postponed once and the weather is looking pretty gloomy. But fortune smiles on Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower (Henry Grace) and conditions improve just enough to allow Ike to say, ""I don't like it, but there it is.  I don't see how we can do anything else but....Go.""
At this point The Longest Day really gets going, switching narrative gear from talky buildup and exposition to the more action-oriented (yet still talky at times) recreation of the events of June 6 (the capture of the Orne River bridge, the scattered airdrops of the American paratroopers, the desperate struggle for Omaha Beach).
The Longest Day features one of the biggest all-star casts assembled for one film, including Eddie Albert, Paul Anka, Richard Beymer, Bourvil,  Richard Burton, Sean Connery, Henry Fonda (as Brig. Gen. Teddy Roosevelt, Jr, who, upon seeing that the U.S. 4th Infantry Division is landing on the wrong part of Utah Beach, says, ""We'll start the war from right here.""), Gert Frobe, Curt Jurgens, Roddy McDowall, Robert Mitchum, Robert Ryan, George Segal, Rod Steiger, Richard Todd (who had actually fought on the Orne River bridge on D-Day), and John Wayne, who not only got a separate credit but also was paid more than his fellow actors.
Although its battle scenes, particularly the airborne drop and the seaborne landings, are somewhat dated and tame by today's standards, the movie still manages to convey to modern audiences the scale of the Normandy invasion (which, if we counted the follow-up divisions that were based in Britain, involved 3,000,000 troops in addition to the initial 200,000 assault troops).  The use of black and white -- which was still prevalent in 1962 -- not only kept costs from rivaling Cleopatra (which 20th Century Fox was filming at the same time -- but allowed the three directors (Ken Annakin, Andrew Marton, and Bernhard Wicki) to seamlessly blend footage shot in different French locales and stock documentary footage.  And although D-Day veterans point out that Ryan and the other screenwriters (including novelist James Jones) made some gaffes (the soldiers didn't scramble off the landing craft and onto the beaches yelling like banshees; they were too seasick and tired), this is still one of the best war movies ever made.",1074470400,10,4443,5.008119079837618

555911,5,630305725X,"This epic 1962 film about the D-Day invasion has got a lot to it.  First the all star cast.  Henry Fonda portrays Teddy Roosevelt's son, John Wayne as a Lt.

We get D-Day from the German's point of view (In German with subtitles) as well as the French, British, American, and even Irish (Connery's line ""yeah, it takes an Irishman to play the pipes).
  There's some good humor here as well as realism, even if you don't see much blood and gore.  But though Saving Pvt. Ryan had more gore, it had much less substance and aside from the 25 minute beginning was less realistic than this.  This one really sets the whole day of June 6th, 1944 in a way that you really feel the importance of it.  The license they took with some of the facts doesn't detract from it's realization of one of the most important days in history.  And this of course was one of the few wars where the US fought on the right side (though pre-war US corporate-Nazis ties are a whole other discussion).
  The 3 hour film has a few scenes with Rommel (Werner Hinz)as well as the beautiful Irina Demick as a French resistance fighter.

555912,3,630305725X,"The Longest Day was one of the most anticipated films ever when it was about to hit the theaters over forty years ago.  A lot of people really love this film, and don't get me wrong, this isn't a terrible film, but I don't love it and I don't see what makes it so special.  The Longest Day is a long movie, which is a given, but the movie is a one time watch.  After seeing it for the first time, I know for a fact that I doubt that I shall want to see it again.  Again, it's not because it's a bad movie, or I don't like historical war films, it's just that it does very little as far as entertainment value and progression of the characters.
I gave it three stars because it is historically accurate, it is pretty easy to follow (the battle of Normandy I mean), and it does use some live footage that helps enhance its realness.  This earned it three stars, but there is more to a movie than just realness or accuracy.  There are things like character development, or main characters at that.  Also, there is something called a consistant storyline, something within the plot that tells of a story.  These things lacking reduces the star count to three and no more.
Let's talk about the missing consistancy in the story.  Now, what is a consistant story?  It's a story that has a beginning and an end, a conclusion.  There is no one single consistant story in this film.  The movie is about the Landing at Normandy, but it has a bunch of scenarios that kinda pop up during the film.  These are the storylines, but they aren't consistant.  For example, within the first hour of the film the story of the French Underground prior to the Landing is told.  But it goes for say 20-30 minutes and then it just quits.  The film doesn't go back to it, it just leaves it and its characters that they were shaping kinda out in the dark, forgotten about.  This is a no no in story telling.  You don't introduce characters, tell a story with them in it, but never go back to them.  But rather just introduce new characters in new situations and scenarios.  This isn't a consistant storyline, it's bouncing from one scenario to the next, shuffling characters and sub-plots around like some talent show.
Let's talk about the character development, or the characters in general.  Most of the characters in the film are historically true.  But like the storyline, it shuffles the characters in and out like a talent show.  In fact this movie really is more talent show than movie.  The reason why I say this is because this film has no real main character or even primary characters.  Because it has so many scenarios, and different characters within those many scenarios, no character or characters emerge as a focal point.
However, this isn't a bad thing necessarily.  Take a film like Tora!  Tora!  Tora! and this multi-scenario/lacking main character(s) chemistry works.  But it doesn't work with the Longest Day.  Why?  Well in Tora!  Tora!  Tora!  the cast consisted of nobodies.  There really isn't an actor in that film that one would expect to take a leading role.  In the Longest Day, there is an arm full of actors that you would expect to be the focal character.  Not to mention, the characters and scenarios in Tora!  Tora!  Tora!  didn't just vanish like they do in the Longest Day.
The Longest Day is not a film with an intent to tell an entertaining story, with characters you can follow.  No, it is rather just a cameo movie.  Think of it, would this film have the reputation, the prestige, the admiration if it didn't have an all-star cast?  It is because it has an all star cast that people like this film, primarily.  It's a cameo film.  In this cameo film is where none of these ""famous"" actors really play a leading role, they just kinda poke their head into the film, supposedly play the role of a historical figure, and that's all there is to it.  Robert Mitchum, John Wayne, Henry Fonda, these actors and more only have like 15 minutes in the film each.  So it's quite clear that this is nothing more but an all-star, cameo movie.  And because it lacks a consistant storyline, with consistant characters who last the whole film, the only way this film could get the admiration it desired was to plug in big names in small roles.
I see the Longest Day as more of a tribute film than a movie.  It's intent was to round up big names and put them in historical roles, although minor roles mind you, and tell the story of June 6th, 1944 in a condensed form.  And this isn't a bad thing, again, necessarily.  It's a film worth seeing once, you'll learn something of the battle of Normandy.  But with me, I like characters that last, I like a storyline that doesn't jump from scenario to scenario leaving sub-plots unfinished, untold.  Not to mention, the ending of this film is for the pits.  Apparently, they were spending too much money for these big name actors that they ran out of budget to end it right.  The abrupt ending is just another black mark against this film.  And it is indeed the Longest Cameo Film ever.

555913,5,630305725X,"This movie is, hands down, one of the best WWII films ever. It's filmed in black and white, which may seem old and boring, but it does quite the opposite. The B&W only makes the movie seem more graphic and more realistic, while allowing the filmmakers to cut in actual WWII footage.
This film has it all, the horror of war without the graphicness of war, the emotional turmoil men go through, a great soundtrack, historical accuracy, (the foreign characters even speak their own languages) and, of course, The Duke. (I mean John Wayne) This covers so much more than Saving Private Ryan did, showing much more than the beach landings, you get the paradrops, the famous assault on Pointe de Huc, and the German perspective on the invasions.
This is classic filmmaking at its best. Simply stunning cinematography, sound, and acting.
The only problem I have with this movie is the portrayal of the assualt on Pointe de Huc; the Rangers that fought there actually did come across and destroy the guns they were sent to knock out. Darryl F. Zanuck (the director) explained this by saying that he wanted to make a statement of the futility of war. I agree with this statement, though he could've done it differently, instead of mocking the sacrifice the 2nd Ranger Battalion made to save men on Utah beach.
This is the only inaccuracy that I could find in the movie. If you want a G-rated, well done, profoundly moving and sometimes funny war film, definately buy The Longest Day. It's superb.",1063497600,3,1486,4.719230769230769

In spite of that, the Canadians succeeded at their objectives better than any of the other participants in the landings. Stephen Ambrose dedicates a chapter of his book _D-Day_ to the Canadians.

556022,4,630305725X,"The Longest Day (1962 film)
In 1959, 15 years after the Allied invasion of Normandy, former war correspondent Cornelius Ryan wrote The Longest Day, his popular and critically-acclaimed account of the D-Day landings.  Based on painstaking research and interviews with Allied and German veterans and the French civilians swept up in the events of June 6, 1944, The Longest Day remains among the best books on the topic.

It is not surprising, then, that 20th Century-Fox studio chief Darryl F. Zanuck bought the film rights and asked Ryan, (who, besides having been a reporter, had also written plays) to adapt The Longest Day into a screenplay for a major motion picture.  Zanuck, who had served in the Army Signal Corps as a lieutenant colonel and helped document the D-Day landings, had always wanted to make a feature film about the invasion.  He also had another pressing reason to make what he thought would be a big hit: 20th Century-Fox, nearly crippled by box office flops and the costly production of Cleopatra, was on the brink of bankruptcy.

In order to attract audiences, Zanuck and his massive production team assembled a cast almost as large as the actual invasion force.  48 major international stars from three countries were signed on to what a World War II trivia book described as ""the most expensive black-and-white movie made.""  Shot in studios near Paris and on the Mediterranean island of Corsica, The Longest Day required not one but three directors.  Andrew Marton shot the American exterior episodes, Bernhard Wicki handled the German exterior episodes, and Ken Annakin directed the British exterior episodes.  Overseeing the entire project were Zanuck and Associate Producer Elmo Williams, who would later executive produce the Japanese-American Pearl Harbor classic, Tora! Tora! Tora!

The movie basically follows the book's structure in its three major acts: The Wait, about the preparations on both sides for the invasion; The Night, about the night airborne assault; and The Day, about the landings on the five invasion beaches.  The DVD breaks these three acts into 12 chapters.

While by early 21st Century standards The Longest Day's combat scenes are rather tame - there are no extremely gory scenes as explicit as those in Saving Private Ryan - they do capture the vastness and complexity of the Normandy landings.  Shot in a semi-documentary style (major characters are introduced with identifying ""credits"" so we know who is who), The Longest Day is as accurate as a 1962-era film studio could depict an actual event.  The black-and-white presentation allows insertion of a few snippets of actual documentary footage (mainly of German soldiers marching through Paris and running to their fortifications near the beaches) seamlessly into the film.

Of course, some characters (such as Eddie Albert's Col. Thompson) seem to be composites or even fictitious, and some actors (such as John Wayne and Robert Ryan) look nothing like the officers they are portraying.  Wayne plays Lt. Col. Benjamin Vandenvoort, who in 1944 was in his 30s, while Ryan plays Brig. Gen. James ""Slim Jim"" Gavin, who at 38 was the Army's youngest general.  (The more accurate, but far less popular sequel, A Bridge Too Far, cast Ryan O'Neal as Gavin.)

Accuracy goes out the window in at least one respect, and this one is at the top of most D-Day veterans' list of gripes.  While the movie does mention the awful conditions on the transports and landing craft (""Man, that stink! Diesel oil, backed up toilets, vomit.  And there ain't no place to get sick in!"" gripes one soldier to Roddy McDowell), when the Allied soldiers get out of the landing craft, they hit the beaches running and screaming like banshees.  In Stephen E. Ambrose's 1994 D-Day, June 6, 1944, veterans scoff at Zanuck's fanciful depiction, pointing out that they were too tired and too sick to run across the beach, much less yell like Confederates at Gettysburg.

Nevertheless, The Longest Day remains one of the best war movies ever made. Released in October of 1962 and enjoying a long run at the theaters, it was the box office's top draw for 1963, earning an Academy Award for special effects and, luckily for Zanuck, saved 20th Century Fox from bankruptcy.
The DVD presents The Longest Day to its original CinemaScope wide screen presentation, improving on the CBS-Fox two-cassette VHS version, which was released on  the usual pan-and-scan ""full screen"" re-edit. Other improvements are a sound remastering by THX and a few tiny bits of additional footage.  The single disc, however, has very few extra features; only the theatrical trailers to The Longest Day, Patton, and Tora! Tora! Tora!",1053475200,285,4678,5.05331599479844

My ONLY criticism of the film is the complete lack of reference to the Canadian beach, Juno.  When Sean Connery, who played a Canadian with a bad accent, came to shore, he was greeted by a Frenchman drinking champaign, a fact that does not take into account the battle as it happened. Though a member of the Commonwealth, Canada took the beach as a sovereign army - not mere colonial forces.  Though Canada only had a population of approx. 11 million, it put more people in uniform per capita than any other nation - including Russia. The million Canadians that finally served in WWII (1939-45) earned the right to have their own beach and were the only allied nation to attempt a landing prior (Dieppe 1942).
Though this has strayed from the movie review, I believe that the movie is indicative of the WWII genre that forgets that it was a World War with many players, not just the one that are depicted on the silver screen.

556028,5,630305725X,"This all time classic still holds up well after many years.  Although burdened a bit by the grand review of 40 odd stars, many of which to viewers today would be unknown, the movie still holds up well.  Most roles in it are cameo parts so even the hammy John Wayne is not too hard to stomach as the tough American para commander.  The movie shows well the drama and confusion leading right up to the invasion itself.  Its interesting how the movie provides ordinary GIs mostly.  The British and Germans are mostly shown from the HQ level, not down in the ditches as the Americans are. Kind of a subtle bias here. Didn't the Germans and British also have ordinary soldiers worth portraying as well?  The book upon which the movie is based by Cornelius Ryan certainly had allied and German accounts in it.
As a book and researcher Ryan certainly holds up well to the likes of Ambrose, just as this movie does the same with the somewhat overdone ""Saving Pvt. Ryan""  While ""Ryan"" provides a fox hole perspective, the overly American view point is a bit irksome after a while, and mind you I'm not British or German myself!  Still, its good for today's viewers to see that not only American troops were involved with the liberation of France.
The action scenes in this film are intense, but not overly graphic.  The atmosphere of combat is captured quite well here with squads of soldiers wandering around with the sounds of battle in the background.  There is also quite a lot of sardonic humor in this film which adds to its quality.  Certainly a classic of its kind, I personally would take it over ""Ryan"" on most days.  To view both of these films will provide the viewer with a good movie perspective of the D-Day landings.  The acting is par, and the big names don't get in the way of the overall story too much.  The old b/w picture quality adds atmosphere as well.  The DVD format was ok, the letter box screen I find annoying at times though.

So comparing what was in my mind's eye as a kid (an epic battle with lots of booms and bangs) to a 30 year old adult was quite a different experience.  Now I look at it as if it should have been called ""D-Day For Dummies"".
The acting is pretty much sub-par, but overall the picture shows what happened in a semi-factual sense of the events that happened on that day (even as some other reviewers have pointed out that some of what happened in the film and what happened really are a little skewed).
As stated above, I though the acting was a little off (particularly any of the allies).  They seemed to be just giving off speaches about the whole plan, what was involved and what was happening at any moment in the film as if the people around them (including the audience) had no idea why they were there or what was involve (John Wayne's idiotic speach in the parachute packing hanger was the epitome of these speeches).
At any rate, overall for an earlier film, it was a very good attempt.
Also, comparing the realism of death as to that of Ryan is not fair since movies of this date had to be subdued due to that particular age of movies and the public. So, comparison between the two is hardly fair.",1033689600,2,1310,4.228

There are appearances from Henry Fonda, John Wayne, Robert Wagner, Eddie Albert, Rod Steiger, Sean Connery, Red Buttons, Robert Mitchum, Roddy McDowell, Richard Burton, and Mel Ferrer.  There was also the singing star Fabian.  I would say that the movie did not belong to any one of them, but belonged to the whole ensemble.  Although John Wayne and Robert Mitchum seemed to have more scenes, each stars part is relatively short so that the action will keep moving.
The movie begins on June 5 as the Allies are debating whether to postpone the invasion again due to the weather.  The actors playing Eisenhower and Montgomery will cause you to take a double take.  I thought I was watching old documentary footage.  The movie ends with the taking of Omaha Beach.
You will listen to the Germans go through their plans thinking that the Allies will not invade.  These parts are done in German with subtitles.  Likewise, scenes with the French commandos or the French Resistance are also shot in French.  It adds to the overall effect of the film.

556087,4,630305725X,"It's unfair to compare this epic 1960's recreation of the D-Day landings with the latter retelling of ""Saving Private Ryan"". In this film, we see the battle from many angles - from Generals to grunts, airborne troops to those who came in on the beach in the amhibious LST's, fighter pilots to tankers, civilians to fighters - as opposed to ""Ryan's"" story focused on a single anonymous unit. Here, an all-star cast fights the war on many fronts. It's early summer in Europe - the weather is horrible, but all sides think an allied landing on Europe's Atlantic coast is certain. At zero hour, allied troops pore onto the Normandy beaches, hoping they can seize the beach faster than coastal Wehrmacht units can machine-gun them. Airborne units move silently through the French countryside hoping they can take strategic spots and link up with the amhibious force on the coast. German units plead desperately for reinforcements while their superiors remain mute: whether convinced that the Normandy landings are a decoy for a real attack on Calais or simply because they haven't got the nerve to wake the Fuhrer from his nap. Chaos reigns on the beach, but something keeps the force cohesive - when units are destroyed, individual troops link up and form new ones. There is little gore, but that wouldn't work on a level as broad as this. In one extended shot, the camera follows a unit of Free-French troops trying to seize an occupied town. The charge of the anonymous troops - with the French casulaties simply dropping dead - looks more like something out of real-time strategy game like ""Command and Conquer"" than a war movie, but we know that such scenes were common, and that people did dies faceless, typical and unspectacular deaths. Death in war was gruesome and gory, but the compulsion to base the narrative on gore is pure Hollywood - among other things, it allows todays studios to pat themselves on the back for being more realistic, as well as showing off better special effects. In many ways, ""Day"" is more modern than ""Ryan"" because it relies on less heroism than ""Ryan"" does, and offers more irony in its place. While ""Ryan"" served up plenty of sentiment for the greatest generation, ""Day"" had John Wayne on the verge of tears (when entering a French town and first seeing scores of machine-gunned paratroops hanging by their chutes from the tops of buildings) and Richard Burton appropriately stoic as a downed Spitfire pilot with a shattered leg, cynically dismissing war as being fought by men lost with their guns. Just because ""Day"" doesn't give the ""greatest generation"" the Hollywood treatment doesn't mean it's any less a tribute than ""Ryan"", only one with a strategy of its own.",999129600,6,2703,4.852813852813853

While SPR went beyond the invasion to investigate the effects war has on people, this movie plays more like a history book. That's not to say it isn't moving to watch, there are some scenes in it that I'm amazed at how they did it. When this was made it was well before computer images could give you anything you want on the screen. To watch the scene where German planes attack the allies as they invade the beach you marvel at how much work it must have taken to film that scene. Another one that stands out is to watch Red Buttons as a trapped parachutist stuck on a church steeple watch his fellow soldiers get gunned down as they land. Because this movie plays more like a documentary, you don't get involved with many of the characters. We're really only introduced to the personal feelings of a few, but because there are so many characters, both on the American, European and German sides, it's easy to get lost in the mere scope of everything. It just shows how enourmous this movement was, something that's not always conveyed on films. Many people from all sides were involved, for better or worse. It's an epic in the sense of it's subject matter and how the producers took it on, not necessarily it's story-telling.

556143,4,630305725X,"The comparisons are of course between THE LONGEST DAY and SAVING PRIVATE RYAN. The only similarities are: both movies depict the allied landings at Normandy on D-Day, they are tributes to the servicemen of WWII, and most importantly, both are good movies. That said, general comparisons are unhelpful because the realism that made Spielberg's movie so memorable is totally absent from THE LONGEST DAY; for two very good reasons: (1) technically, the capability was unavailable in 1962 and (2) morally, that level of graphic violence would have been unacceptable. Also, Mr Zanuck, as director, did not want to make bloody messes of his numerous stars.
Realism aside, on its own merits THE LONGEST DAY is a tribute that has stood the test of time. The huge collection of stars (over 40) and the near 3 hour length qualifies it as epic. On an emotional level, it is a patriotic salute to the soldiers who went ashore. With a scope larger than Omaha beach, the focus is not exclusively American; the movie depicts the role of the British, and other allied troops, as well as the work of the French resistance. German dialogue is subtitled to add some realism. Perhaps the best aspect of the movie is that as an adaptation of Cornelius Ryan's book of the same name, it is based on a historically accurate account of the battle.
For realism, patriotism, and a sentimental heroic story, only partially based on real events of D-Day, watch SAVING PRIVATE RYAN. For an old fashioned, ""clean"" war movie based on history with good acting (Henry Fonda, Robert Mitchum, John Wayne, Curt Jurgens) watch THE LONGEST DAY. Better yet, view both, just don't spoil the experience with a lot of comparisons.",994636800,21,1687,4.861111111111111
556144,5,630305725X,"If The Longest Day isn't the best depiction of D-Day, at least it is the most comprehensive. It shows not just the landings on Omaha, Utah, Gold, Sword and Juno beaches, but also the airborne landings made by the 82 and 101 Airborne Divisions, Glider assualts, The participation of the french underground and the actions of the german forces. It has great cinematography (Which is probably why it won an oscar for Black & White Cinematography). The musical score (Especially the theme played during the credits) is very good. It is also very accurate. For example, if you think the people depicted in the movie aren't real, Most of them were interviewed for the book by Cornelius Ryan and, if you look at the end credits, you will see some served as technical advisors It is also nice that people speak their native language, not just all English. Besides, subtitles are better than dubbing.
But it is in the action and acting departments that TLD succeeds. Sure you can tell that the AA Gunfire used against the planes are just pyrotechnics and that the planes themselves are models, but the action scenes for the D-Day landings and for the combat that takes place in the towns between French and German forces is spectacular. As for stars, a total of 42 of them make appearances, if only briefly. They include John Wayne, a colonel in the 82nd Airborne who fights despite a broken ankle, Henry Fonda as General Theodore Roosevelt Junior, Richard Burton as an RAF officer, Robert Mitchum as General Norman Cota, Red Buttons as the private who gets caught up on a Church during an air drop, Robert Wagner as an Army Ranger and Sean Connery as french Private Flanagan. Some complain about The Longest Day's lack of bloody violence and how it does not show how awful D-Day was. This movie came out in 1962. At this time, censors were not so leant on movies like they are today. Also, it was felt that audiences would not want to see violence similar to what happened on D-Day. And it was not yet possible to recreate that kind of gore (Unless you really had the actors get killed).
Thus, The Longest Day does not show the horror of D-Day but instead shows how D-Day happened and the blunders made by both sides. Saving Private Ryan shows the horror of D-Day but not how it happened and none of the planning that went into it.

One can visit Point du Hoc, and see the bombed out bunkers that the Rangers attacked, and one can see the results of the carnage of the beach fronts, Sword, Gold, Juno, Omaha, and Utah in the many grave above Omaha beach, and throughout the Normandy region.  In my opinion, this classic film portrays the greatest military feat in history with dignity and accuracy in so much as was possible at the time it was made.

556146,4,630305725X,"Since it's the anniversary of D-Day today, I thought I'd submit a review for ""The Longest Day"", the grand black and white classic about the Normandy invasion.
""The Longest Day"" is truly a period piece, and by that I mean a reflection on all levels about the men in uniform on both sides who fought the ultimate battle.  Filmed in 1962, with so many veterans still alive, the film is more style than substance, not needing much depth because everything about the characters was either true or familiar enough.  The movie is ultimately a photo album on film, with famous actors of the day like John Wayne and Robert Mitchum capturing the star power of the real-life officers they play, and less iconic (at the time) actors such as Richard Burton and Sean Connery embodying the ""everyman"" characteristics of soldiers that would strike a familiar, resonant chord with the audience of 1962.
The film is properly epic, from its cinematography, its spare no expense use of props, and of course Maurice Jarre's omnipresent score - a call to arms cobbled around Beethoven's Fifth Symphony.  Rather than concentrate on any one character, the film constantly switches between plot lines thus capturing both the memorable events of the day and portraying moments most likely experienced by many who fought in the invasion.
I make the distinction regarding the film's construction of plot, because it is now sometimes unfairly compared to ""Saving Private Ryan"".  Disregarding the obvious technical differences, I think the major difference that must be considered is who the target audiences for each film were.  For ""Saving Private Ryan"", Spielberg made a film that would inspire and educate younger generations who only read about World War II in history books.  For ""The Longest Day"", the film was made as a remembrance to be appreciated by a nation still not far removed from that great conflict.
""The Longest Day"" is a fine tribute and a grand film.  Buy it or rent it.  Either way, you will enjoy it.",991785600,5,1993,4.910714285714286

556149,5,630305725X,"Epic film released in 1962 about Operation Overlord, the Allied invasion of Nazi-occupied France during World War II. The cast is comprised of almost all the top celebrity actors of the time and covers numerous events in the operation that started the second front against the Axis powers in Europe. It is probably the largest production among all existing war movies and is remarkable for portraying notable battles at their actual locations in Normandy. Producer Darryl F. Zanuck was loyal to history and as a bonus highlights interesting little stories that make this an entertaining feature.

Not all is perfect though; there is some melodramatic acting by various actors with dialogue bleeding over with patriotic profoundness. The movie plays out like a grand adventure for the soldiers who stormed Normandy on the 6th of June in 1944, and many of the horrors associated with combat are not vividly portrayed like more recent productions.  It's fair to say the movie was aimed at depicting the triumph of the operation and that audiences in 1962 were not ready to watch gruesome depictions of soldiers dying on battlefields.

Overall, this movie features many terrific sequences. Distinctive to the film is the British 6th Airborne Division's glider assault on the Orne River Bridge, the only production to have depicted a glider assault in detail. Other highlights are the French Commando assault in Ouistreham, the 2d Ranger Battalion attack on Point Du Hoc, and parachutist Private Steele's precarious predicament on the church steeple at Sainte Mere Eglise. Most impressive is how this movie's storyline remains coherent throughout the portrayal of numerous significant events that took place at Normandy.

The film is directed by three directors (Ken Annakin, Andrew Marton & Bernhard Wicki) with each filming the story from the US, UK and German point of view.  The film is authentic as it includes actually military leaders and the German actors speak German (with subtitles).  The fact that the film is in black and white adds to the starkness of the mission that Allied Forces are about to embark on.  The film is tension filled and riveting.  Since the movie was released in 1962, the war sequences are not realistic (certainly nowhere near the graphic nature of Saving Private Ryan) due to violence restrictions that were in place at the time.

556214,5,630305725X,"Unlike Saving Private Ryan, The Longest Day was filmed to dramatize the true, unfolding story of the invasion of France beginning several days before the invasion, which was documented for all time by journalist Cornelius Ryan. Ryan did something few historians have successfully accomplished since the end of the war. He compiled thousands of interviews and wrote a realistic account of the invasion which reads like a suspense and action novel. The movie seeks to combine many characters taken from Ryan's book, and is therefore fiction as well as history, but it is masterfully done and is otherwise true to history. Stereotypes of incompetent German officers and troops, so common in film and television of the early 1960's was not a problem in this movie, nor is the graphic violence of Private Ryan observable. The true story is the focus of the movie, and it was made primarily for veterans who had seen the real violence and had fought tough, intellegent and brave Germans, and had no need to be reminded of those horrors. They did have a desire to see their sacrifices and trials acknowledged alongside the background of historical context. It is a gripping movie. A side note for those who might want to compare The Longest Day with Saving Private Ryan. These should compliment each other, not be compared with each other. The audience for The Longest Day was primarily the veterans, their peers and children. The audience or Saving Private Ryan is primarily the grandchildren of the veterans, young people who are in the main, quite ignorant of history. There is no doubt that Saving Private Ryan is more accurate a portayal of historical American and German weapons and  villages, but this was not even attempted in the Longest Day. If you will read The Longest Day before watching Saving Private Ryan, you will see that the sites and sounds remembered by many of the interviewed veterans who were at Omaha and Utah beaches somehow happened at the same time and place in Saving Private Ryan. That makes Saving Private Ryan as inaccurate for what it shows, as is The Longest Day, for what it doesn't show.  Both movies are excellent, and both are moving.",977184000,19,2165,4.86449864498645
556215,4,630305725X,"Although ""The Longest Day"" doesn't have the sheer visceral punch of 1998's ""Saving Private Ryan"", but it's still a heck of a film, and it's a pretty accurate telling of the D-Day story.
Some of the moments worth noting in this film include:
1) The sweeping, aerial view of the landing beach, told from the point of view of one of two German pilots assigned to strafe it.
2) A German officer is told repeatedly by his superiors that the Allies aren't coming, but scans the ocean with his binoculars anyway. What does he see? Thousands of Allied ships, punctuated with the first four notes from Beethoven's Fifth. Nice!
The all-star cast is also fine, though in the context of the cynical 21st century, their unabashed flag-waving is a little corny. But what else could guys like John Wayne do?
Producer Darryl F. Zanuck basically bet the 20th Century Fox studio on this film, and it shows. It's extremely well-made, and great care was taken to accurately recreate some of the pivotal D-Day battles. True, the film doesn't accurately portray the sheer carnage of the battle, but this film was made in 1962; the kind of filmmaking technology (and permissiveness on the part of censors) that made ""Saving Private Ryan"" so viscerally violent simply didn't exist then.
But it's worth noting that, gore aside, both films' renditions of D-Day are remarkably similar.
This is also one of the first WWII films to portray Germans as something other than Hitler-loving Aryan wannabees; watching the general in charge of the Normandy beaches complain about Hitler's military incompetence, you know you're seeing a new type of WWII film.",975628800,17,1623,4.905454545454545
556216,5,630305725X,"This carefully reconstructed and scripted movie version of famed author Cornelius Ryan best-selling depiction of D-Day on June 6, 1944 has a unique and appealing way of showing the massively construction of the largest single sea borne assault in modern history. The movie powerfully chronicles the events surrounding the fabled Allied sea-borne assault in Normandy on that stormy day that will live forever in history. The total cost of the invasion in terms of human life and destruction is a cautionary lesson for history. This is a story powerfully retold at every level, but concentrating on the faithful recollections of the actual participants in the action. Thus, the viewer is quickly swept into the action as we get a voyeur's view of the moment-to-moment development of the story as the Allies begin to prepare and then execute the attack in all its horrific detail.
There is a virtual cornucopia of information presented here, and director Darryl Zanuck's approach is scrupulously faithful to the facts, all of them, regardless of the particular source. Having already read the book on which it was based before seeing the movie, I was struck by the brilliant way in which the transformation from the book to the screen was accomplished. Therefore, there is a great deal of attention paid not only to the recollections and experiences of the Allied assault troops, but to German defenders and French civilians caught in the terrible crossfire of the opposing forces. This movie wonderfully illustrates the man-on-the-ground perspective that has been subsequently used to such advantage in more recent movies like ""Saving Private Ryan"" and ""The Thin Red Line"". There is little apparent effort here to color the results and make the Allies more circumspect and less provocative in making and activating their star-crossed assault.
One gets the sense that this is the whole story as best it could be visually recreated, and Zanuck makes an extraordinary effort to bolster a comprehensive picture of the battles as they unfolded all over Normandy and its environs. Of course the movie is crammed full of everyone who was anyone in Hollywood at the time, and the fact that each is so believable in his or her individual parts in spite of their status is a tribute to Zanuck's uncanny ability to create a product that oozes of believability. This movie memorably shines the light of truth on one of the greatest moments in modern history, when the Allies stood fatefully in the breach, about to take the European continent back by force of arms from the terrible totalitarian forces that had stolen it so cruelly and violently four years before.",975024000,11,2651,5.041002277904328
556217,5,630305725X,"'The Longest Day' is perhaps the greatest dramatic record of one of the defining moments in world history. After the intimacy of 'Saving Private Ryan', many critics have accused it of being a 'sanitized' version of the Normandy Invasion, but it is a different kind of film, entirely! While Steven Speilberg's aim was to personalize the horror facing the first wave of troops to hit the beach, Producer Darryl F. Zanuck, a D-Day vet, himself, wanted to create a mosaic of the myriad of personalities, events, and experiences that shaped the day. It is a film that looks objectively at all the forces who fought this epic battle, wisely casting major stars of each country to portray actual and fictitious characters. This is a bold move, as subtitles are used extensively, and the film has a uniquely international flavor. This is not your usual war film with 'American actors doing funny accents'!
There are many standout performances; a few that deserve particular recognition are Richard Burton's war-weary RAF pilot; Dietmar Schnherr as one of the last Luftwaffe pilots, facing an impossible order; Jeffrey Hunter, a young sergeant who is 'Dear John'ed and faces the horrendous Omaha landing; Sean Connery (before James Bond) as a cocky Irish infantryman; Sal Mineo, a doomed foot soldier; and John Wayne (himself a war film icon), as Lieutenant Colonel Benjamin Vandervoort, the Airborne commander, whose forces survive a disasterous predawn parachute drop.
Filled with drama, humor, and pathos, 'The Longest Day' works on many levels, and is never dull! Nearly forty years after its initial release, it is still seems as fresh and engrossing as ever, and works equally well viewed by itself, or paired with 'Saving Private Ryan'.

The glider scene where actor Michael Todd (who actually was there as an enlistedman) plays his former CO, Major Howard teaches us that there is a need to bring back the assault glider in high tech-form (NOT towed, but released from B-52 inboard wing pylon and/or as an Air-Mech-Strike Future Transport Rotorcraft pod) so we can seize important objectives like bridges by SILENT coup de main. There are authentic tracked Bren Gun carriers rumbling off the beaches, Commandos with bicycles who link up with Howard's Paratroopers in time to ""hold until relieved"".
The French commando scene is an awesome non-stop flow of action from the air showing how light troops need armored vehicle fire support to overcome enemies with heavy weapons in an urban environment (re: Gen Grange's Air-Mech-Strike book proposes these vehicles be organic to light units). Notice how the French Commando leader doesn't keep rushing the enemy with his men, he goes back at great personal risk and gets a tank and personally directs it to demolish the hotel where a German rooftop anti-aircraft gun and an anti-tank gun at ground-level hold up their advance. WOW. Impressive film making.
In contrast to the British who employed lots of armored vehicles with engineering attachments to overcome obstacles, the U.S. at Omaha beach hand-carries its engineer tools and suffers heavy casualties trying to blast open a way to move inland. Its too bad with the retirement of the U.S. Combat Engineer Vehicle we are about ready to repeat Omaha beach's mistakes in the next war.
The Paratrooper drops that set the Germans in disarray to include dummy Paratroop decoys shows how in war, TIME is a critical element that can mean the differance between victory and defeat and how the seemingly little things (decoys) and the extreme (Airdrop operations) can result in the big pay-off of ""da-da-da-duh!""

""The Longest Day"" set a standard of excellence in war films that is unsurpassed even now, thirty-eight years after its theatrical release.  It remains one of the most popular and successful war movies of all time.

This is the story of D-Day, June 6, 1944. Based on Cornelius Ryan's book of the same name, the film accurately chronicles the strategy, tactics, frustrations, triumphs, and failures of both the Allied and German sides on the day that marked the turning point of World War II in Europe. There are excellent performances all around by a star-studded international cast headed by John Wayne, Robert Mitchum, Richard Burton, (a young) Sean Connery, Robert Ryan, and Eddie Albert. Occasional snippets of silliness rear their head throughout the movie, but are not distracting.  Filmed in black-and-white, ""The Longest Day"" has a documentary flavor and a wonderfully authentic feel that made it a film to view and savor time and time again.

556291,5,630305725X,"Not only is this the greatest War Film ever made, it would also go close to being one of the best in any given category. You can simply forget any  rumors that you've heard about this film being too 'Gung Ho', that is far  from the truth as the documented accounts of the Normandy campaign,  (Stephen E. Ambrose's are the best) will make you realize that D-DAY was  crammed full of heroic feats not only created by fighting men but also by  its leaders. 'The Longest Day' recreates many historical events and  characters including Rommel, Von Rundsted and Eisenhower (and what a great  resemblance too).  The opening hour of the film allows the viewer to relive  those crucial hours leading up to ""the largest armada the world has ever  seen"" and possibly the greatest day in our modern history. The results will  keep you glued to your seat as you will at times feel like a fly on the  wall. The middle stages of the movie detail the strategies which then lead  to the great battle scenes, which are neither gory nor totally accurate but  are still able to successfully captivate the essence of war fare during the  silver screen era. Perhaps Zanuck's greatest achievement in `The Longest  Day' was the way in which he wound down the film as the full irony and  conclusions of D-DAY became apparent. ""He's dead, I'm injured and your  lost...I suppose it's always like that...war I mean"" how could you put it  better? The acting is second too none boasting an international cast, with  John Wayne, Robert Mitchum and Henry Fonda in starring roles and that's  just to name a few.  Surprisingly enough, at no time does any actor  dominate the screenplay or take away the performance of any colleague. That  in it self was a masterful effort. Told from both the Allied and German  perspectives, `The longest Day' is based on the book by Cornelius Ryan and  quite obviously gave director Steven Spielberg a window in which to create  his own film `Saving Private Ryan'  (although these movies have very little  in common). I could not urge you enough to buy a copy of this great film, I  only wish I could see it on the big screen with the added bonus of dolby  pro-logic digical sound.

556292,5,630305725X,"One of the best in its genre this film well deserves the praise it gets.  Supposedly authentic as far as the timeline of events goes. The lack of  color helps and does not detract from it. Here are couple of mild  criticisms though: Too many big name stars which detract from it as it  becomes a game of spotting who's the next movie star that will come on.  Typical of its era the film tends to glamorize the French a bit too much.  France was, after all, the only captured nation that actively collaborated  with the Nazis.  The French resistance was really not very large and it was  mainly communist waiting to take over ater the end of the war. Red Buttons  just looks foolish in his scenes.",965174400,5,696,4.3671875

Many other reviewers have commented on it's content, so I will focus on the  technical aspects instead. The digital remastering and sound track are  outstanding for a movie of it's age.  Letterbox format reveals many details  that are missed on the standard screen VHS version.  The Dolby surround  isn't up to the standards of more recent productions like Private Ryan, but  it does have an impressive impact that is lost on VHS Hi-Fi. All in all, a  well done version of this masterpiece.",964742400,6,640,4.526315789473684
556294,5,630305725X,"The Longest Day is the epitomization of tbe classic war movie. The events it depicts are epic in scale, the cinematography is outstanding, and you sure see a lot of established stars popping up in minor roles throughout.  As a telling of D-Day, it's intelligent and accessible. If you were riveted  by Gordon Prange books as a ten-year-old, you'll immediately recognize and  appreciate its tone.
Many traits make this stand out. First of all,  Longest Day had a massive budget for its day, and you really see the  difference everywhere. There are some pan shots that just keep going,  showing us an entire ongoing battle, in a way that no faked up,  jittery-camera modern movie would ever attempt to do. Yes, there are lots  of big stars, but the production values didn't stop there. Everything feels  right, like it was done flawlessly at the height of this genre.
Above and  away from huge scale and famous stars, too, Longest Day genuinely respects  its audience's intelligence. German officers speak in German, and the use  of the subtitles show that sense of respect for the audience you sometimes  see -- that's subtle, but it's there. German command officers aren't  sitting around debating the romantic character of their allied opponents  (refer to ""Patton"" for a totally ridiculous scene along these  lines with respect to Sicily), they're doing what they can to plan and act  intelligently. The hamstrung German response to the invasion is placed  fully in the context of disrupted communications and tense relations with  high command.
If you look through all the customer reviews, you'll see  that The Longest Day is constantly being compared to Saving Private Ryan.  Fair enough. These are films of different sorts. Private Ryan is a very  individual movie, and highly fictionalized, despite the justified praise  for realism in its Omaha Beach opening. Longest Day explains the invasion  far more completely; it isn't wanting to put you through the war  personally. In the flurry of positive takes on Private Ryan, some great old  movies got dismissed as being less emotionally complex than they are. For  example: Recall the killing of Germans who came out of pillboxes once  they'd run out of ammunition in Private Ryan? Well, Longest Day does  include a moment exactly along those lines; the Germans come out holding  their hands up, saying ""Bitte, Bitte,"" and are killed by a GI who  wonders what ""Bitte Bitte"" means. The subtitles don't translate:  ""Please, Please."" This is a movie that relied on its audience to  react to that appropriately, without having the emotions telegraphed. I  personally found Private Ryan's version more exploitive in tone.
A heck  of a movie. Watch it in the letterboxes.",963964800,6,2721,5.024663677130045

Also to show great battles like the climb up ""Pointe Du  Hoc"" and the battle at ""Pegasus Bridge"" was just down right  smart!

P.S.  A note to the person complaining that none of the main Allied characters getting killed in the movie: Since the film recreates the real-life experiences of soldiers on June 6, 1944 - as told in hundreds of interviews after the war to journalist-author Cornelius Ryan - it stands to reason that every single one of the interviewees obviously - obviously! - survived Operation Overlord (and, indeed, the war).  And if one observes closely, none of the characters played by the major German actors is actually killed either, and that for the same obvious reason.",953942400,15,1098,5.060773480662983

This film did NOT have to have the blood and  guts, and the foul language, as Saving Private Ryan needed, in order to  portray the film as was wanted.

556321,5,630305725X,"""The Longest Day"" is an awesome and engrossing history lesson about arguably the most important day of World War II, the day the Allies stormed Normandy.  It should be watched IN COMBINATION with ""Saving  Private Ryan"".  Private Ryan is great for pointing out the horrors of  war but it falls a little short in the history department.  It does very  accurately depict the Omaha Beach landings, but then it drifts into a  fictional story (a good one nonetheless).  D-Day was about a LOT more than  just Omaha Beach, it was a huge, multi-pronged invasion.
The Longest  Day, meanwhile, meticulously re-traces the events, conversations, decisions  and strategies used by the Germans, Americans, British, and French.  It  builds beautifully in its' tension leading up to H-hour.  Sure, it may not  show intestines and other internal organs hanging out of GI's bellies after  being ripped apart by German machine guns, but it doesn't NEED to.  It has  a different focus: namely, the STRATEGIES, the plans, the deceptions.  Basically, how it all came together.

556322,4,630305725X,I've seen this film several times. When it was release ( around 1963 ) and now ( 1999 ). And I can say that this motionpicture is one of the best concerning the D-Day. Comparisons whith Private Rian are not possible -  they are different. And both good. I recomend.,948240000,4,265,4.3
556323,5,630305725X,"In its day the movie (and book) ""The Longest Day"" was revolutionary in its retelling of history.  It combined individual accounts with ""classic"" military history to tell the story of one the most  important campaigns in history.  At a time when histories written in the US  were basically one-sided chest thumping accounts; this one actually  portrayed the Germans as what most were:  dedicated professional soldiers  who were fighting the Allies and their own high command.  Additionally, the  critical role of the other Allies in planning and execution of D-Day were  finally given their due in a popular history.
In one way at least, the  movie is more historically accurate than the book.  At the time the book  was written (early 1960) common belief was that Erwin Rommel was a  conspirator against Hitler.  The author uncritically parroted that  exaggeration in his work.  However, the movie deletes nearly all references  to Rommel's ""role"" in the conspiracy; modern research bears this  out.  He was a tangential at best member of the plot to kill Hitler on 20  July 1944.
The historical weaknesses of the book replicate themselves in  the movie.  Primarily characters are sometimes given more prominence than  their actual role deserves. This tendency is aggravated in the film by  using ""big name"" stars in those roles. Other reviewers have  mentioned this movie in connection with Saving Private Ryan.  The two  simply cannot be compared.  The Longest Day is an epic told on a huge scale  to match the operation itself.  Individuals therefore die cleanly and  heroically.  SPR on the hand, is an intensely personal account of infantry  combat at the platoon/squad level-the landing of the 2nd Rangers on the  beach is the most accurate ever filmed, period.  Combat IS random, bloody  and revolting; SPR wisely reminds us of this unpleasant truth.  But in NO  way was it intended to describe all of Overlord. All in all The Longest Day  is an excellent movie, and, unusally for Hollywood pretty good history.",947808000,3,2018,5.033536585365853
556324,5,630305725X,"The Longest Day has been a favorite of mine since I first saw it as a kid in the late 70's.  It led me into an interest in the Invasion of Normandy.  Since then I have read a dozen books on the subject including Ryan's book  The Longest Day as well as Ambrose's D-Day: The Sixth of June.  This movie  is a far superior ""historical document"" than Saving Private Ryan.  Although I agree that comparing the two is like comparing apples and  oranges I still can't help doing it.  TLD is an ensemble cast movie that  seeks to teach the viewer about D-Day itself.  The actors play real people  (generals mostly) who have an impact on the battle.  SPR is concerned with  a fictional group of rangers looking for an equally fictional Private Ryan.  There isn't much history to be gleaned from that movie.  While I admit  that SPR presents a more grusomely bloody (and accurate) view of the battle  on the Normany beaches themselves,  it is not concerned with telling the  story of D-Day.  I have a feeling that the majority of the people who saw  SPR in theaters were unfamiliar with the historical events surrounding this  great battle.  It is unlikely that their knowledge of D-Day was increased  as a result of seeing SPR.  If you have seen SPR but not TLD, do yourself a  favor and watch TLD.  It will at least give you context for what you saw in  Spielberg's movie.
The Longest Day is epic storytelling at its best.  If SPR has a cast of dozens, TLD has a cast of thousands.  In addition, the  movie is very accurate as far as Hollywood movies go.  I should also  mention that TLD has excellent acting, cinematography, and directing.  Do  yourself a favor and watch this one in a letterbox presentation.
Which is  the better movie?  I personally believe The Longest Day to be better  although Saving Private Ryan is still good in its own right.
Other great  epic war movies with ensemble casts that attempt to present the historical  ""big picture"" include Tora! Tora! Tora!, A Bridge Too Far, and  Gettysburg.  The Longest Day is my favorite although Gettysburg presents  strong competition.  Great biopic epics include Patton and Lawrence of  Arabia.
Perhaps the ultimate movie would be a version of The Longest Day  with Saving Private Ryan's gory realism.  Sadly, such a movie will probably  never be made.  Still,  The Longest Day stands on its own just fine without  it.",942796800,40,2373,4.611111111111111
556325,5,630305725X,"There have been many reviews of this great movie that have compared it with another great war movie, Saving Pvt Ryan.  This is not just silly, but  ridiculous.  SPR was based on a fictional script, written to become a  movie.  TLD is based on Cornelious Ryan's best selling, AND VERY ACCURATE  book of the same name.  Luckily, MR. Zannuck shared Mr. Ryan's commitment  to reality.
When he filmed paratroopers of the 82nd unluckily dropping  into the town square at St. MereEgleise, he filmed on the actual town  square.  Yes, a paratrooper did hang from the church spire and witness the  slaughter, and yes Red Buttons hangs from the SAME church spire, and was  also deafened from the same bells.
Likewise the portrayal of the 6th  Airborne (British) seizure of the bridge over the canal (Pegasus Bridge)is  portrayed with great accuracy at the actual bridge.  The actor who plays  Maj Howard at the bridge was a 6th Division veteran who had jumped into  Normandy on June 6.  The US Rangers attack on Point du Hoc is filmed at the  actual site as well.  I don't think any other war movie ever had that  attention to detail.
Much is made of the Marine Captain who gave some  instruction to SPR actors.  Long before that, Zannuck had German Army  veterans spend 3 weeks teaching the Frenchmen who would portray the  Whermact soldiers how to handle weapons, equipment and act as German  soldiers acted, (3 Weeks!!)
This movie is great, because in addition,  German actors portray German soldiers, British actors portray their  countryman with that typical British ""at the sharp end"" coolness,  and of course American actors portray the Americans.  About the only  critiscism I'd agree with is Robert Ryan and John Wayne WERE too old for  the officers they portrayed.
SPR was a great warmovie, however, Mr  Hanks, I must disagree, it's no ""Historical Document""  People who  need that sort of graphic violence to show them how horrible war is need to  pick up an occasional book (TLD would be a good start) that has more text  than pictures.
TLD IS a great movie, it's no substitute for reading the  book, but you will understand something of what the Allied soldier faced  when he underwent his ""Longest Day"" by watching it.",941500800,3,2220,4.76984126984127
556376,5,630305725X,"This movie provides a good overview of the Normandy invasion, including the events leading up to it.  Many of the episodes in ""The Longest Day"" actually happened, and are based on accounts that survivors gave  to author Cornelius Ryan for his excellent book.  The movie does not try to  be graphic, like ""Saving Private Ryan,"" and while it doesn't show  all the gory details that undeniably happen in battle, ""The Longest  Day"" is a better movie and still shows the tragedy, loss and heroism  of war. It depicts combatants and civilians on all sides with fairness,  showing the dedication and sacrifice of the Allies and the French  civilians, and also showing that not all of the Germans were bad.  The  preceding negative reviews were very false and poor descriptions of  ""The Longest Day.""

556377,5,630305725X,"I first saw TLD in Paris, when it was released in Europe in 1963. Although the movie was made less than 20 years after the events it depicted took place, for many people in the audience this was the first visual depiction  of this specific day. Until then, an oral history of the  ""debarquement"" was what most French men and women had been  exposed to, and, like most other members of the audience, I will never  forget the German bunker scene when the early morning fog finally lifts to  reveal the allied invasion force. It seemed like the entire movie theater  had held its collective breath only to release it when the naval guns came  alive. The power of the movie, for me, resided in its myriad of small, true  vignettes which eventually help paint the larger picture and its ability to  seamlessly switch between sides and ranks; from the agonizing hours before  the final green light was given, betting the invasion on the accuracy of  the weather forecast to the doomed and useless strafing sortie of the two  German fighter planes. In conclusion, by today's standards, the acting  might have been sometimes crude, the special effects not realistic enough,  but the tone was never jingoistic or overly simplistic.  The movie managed  to convey quite effectively the message that D-Day's ultimate success was  due to a combination of blind luck, careful planning, tangled execution and  countless individual acts of valor and selflessness. That afternoon, in a  dark Champs Elysees movie theater, all of it came to life; and for that I  am grateful to Mr. Zanuck and company...",930009600,2,1585,4.843283582089552
