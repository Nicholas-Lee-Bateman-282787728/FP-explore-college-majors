196011,4,1575238896,"This is a very good video.  My only critique is that he doesn't explain  the alternate nostril breathing at all. And at the end of the plow pose, he  doesn't go into a counterpose--such as the fish pose--which is very  important for the back (especially the neck).  Other than that, I highly  recommend this video.  Cope has a very calming voice and he explains all  the poses thoroughly, as if he's with you in the room.  I come out of it  feeling relaxed and invigorated.",968025600,18,473,4.458823529411765
196012,5,1575238896,"In between poses on this tape, instructor Stephen Cope will urge you to ""take a moment to appreciate the effects of [insert pose here]."" And believe me, you will. I'm a yoga tape addict, with a large collection  (it includes all the standard-issue  tapes by Rodney Yee, Ali McGraw, Kathy  Smith, Tracey Rich, Bryan Kest, Patricia Walden, and Yoga Zone), but this  tape stands out in the crowd for its distinctive inner effects. It's a  strenuous workout, yes--but it's constructed and paced in such a way as to  emphasize the meditative effects of each pose. There's no way to get  through this tape hanging on to anxiety--it's a real stress buster. And  it's a great way to prepare for meditation, prayer, and other spiritual  practice. I can't recommend it highly enough.",960249600,56,773,4.8396946564885495
196013,5,1575238896,"This video is great if you want to feel like a million bucks.  I use it frequently, but not every day since it is 80 minutes long.  The poses contained within are very challenging, but the slow pace and and emphasis  on taking time to feel the energy that has been awakened makes it very  relaxing.  I feel so wonderful when I finish this workout.  If you are a  super hyper and stressed out person like me, this video will do wonders for  your stress level.  If your mellow, it may put you in a coma.",957139200,19,501,4.135416666666667
7798872,5,1575238896,"This is a VHS tape of 30 yoga poses.  Instructor Stephen Cope explains each pose, the breathing and what you're trying to feel regarding your body.  This helps immensely and is worth the time it takes to gain an understanding of these critical poses.

It's not as easy as the picture makes it seem.  Sometimes just holding the pose is a challenge, and one could always make the poses more challenging by holding them longer or doing repetitions.

If one were to merely see photos of the poses, it would be difficult to understand the significance of each to the body.  This tape is great because of the explanations.",1255737600,,616,4.605504587155964
7798873,5,1575238896,"I am an intermediate yoga student, and practice about 3 or 5 times/week. This is my one and only yoga DVD. If I don't go to a class, and I dont' just do yoga on my own, this DVD is on the TV. It is an excellent 80 minutes, although I don't normally do the entire tape. Usually I watch just half of it, which is fine.

The beginning is quite gentle, while the second half is more advanced. It is  vigorous, with pauses between poses to ""reflect"" on the pose. Attention is paid to alignment, and doing the pose correctly. The students in the video are of different ages, and ethnicities, which is great. No 20 yr old hard bodies; these folks are real.",1215648000,,649,4.184
7798874,5,1575238896,"Although this makes me sleepy, I think it's wonderful for relaxation. It's obvoiusly not for everyone but I found it very beneficial.",1198281600,,133,5.090909090909091
7798875,5,1575238896,"This video is a wonderful example of the gentle spirit of Kripalu yoga, allowing you time to explore each pose and use full deep breathing.  However, if you think that by ""dynamic"" you are going to get something resembling power yoga or Ashtanga, you will be less than fully pleased.  This tape is ideal for the advanced beginner or someone moving into intermediate level yoga.  Learning to slow down and move deliberately and patiently is an important part of honoring yourself - a value taught in Kripalu yoga, and something that does not happen in the fast paced classes.",1069977600,8,574,4.777777777777778
7798876,3,1575238896,"I take a Kripalu Yoga class here in Hawaii, and it is absolutely wonderful. While I do not think this video is the best example of Kripalu out there, I feel that gorillagorillagorilla's review seemed to critque Kripalu Yoga itself in a very ignorant and uninformative way. Contrarty to gorilla's statements, it is neither for the emotionally or physically ""fragile"". Like *all* yoga, it depends a lot on *who* you learn it from and *how* they teach yoga. Kripalu, if done correctly, does work up a sweat though obviously not as much as Ashtanga - which I also practice. Kripalu is a very patient, interal, slow and calm form of yoga that can teach a lot about patience, being in the moment and concentration of movements. It's unfortunate that the above reviews from gorilla critiqued the style and not simply this tape.  From a *healthy* and *very strong* (emotionally and physically) Kripalu Practictioner who studies Kripalu more than on a videotape.",1066435200,5,953,4.919254658385094
7798877,5,1575238896,"LIke other reviewers, I think the title ""dynamic"" on this tape is a little misleading. This is definitely not nonstop, flow yoga. But because I prefer a slow-paced, meditative, introspective yoga practice, this video was just what I wanted. Along with Rodney Yee's ""Yoga Conditioning for Life"", this video is now one of my top two yoga favorites.  The narration is in a soothing voice, with a minimum of words, and the guidance focuses on helping the yogi notice inward sensations rather than perfecting the poses. A good antidote to our perfectionistic-oriented culture: support for allowing yourself to be where you are now. The scenery is beautiful: a large darkened studio lit with muted blue and orange lighting, creating an introspective mood. The video doesn't include any poses that I would consider advanced and too hard to do, and offers some unique approaches to familiar poses like triangle, and that variation is appealing.  Includes ""yoga mudra"" poses which I think are especially helpful for the tight shoulders of a lot of us who work at computers.  Alternate positions for the newbie aren't demonstrated, which could be a drawback for some. Props are not used. Compared to Kripalu: Gentle this video may be a notch up from beginner toward intermediate.",1057536000,7,1269,5.062200956937799
7798878,5,1575238896,"Not to parrot the other reviewers, but the use of the word ""Dynamic"" in the title could definitely confuse some folks.  However!  This is still my favorite tape and I own quite a few.  I enjoy the slow, relaxed pace and the gentle movements.  I don't do yoga to work up a sweat, but make no mistake, you'll probably feel the effects of this session the next day or so.  My only real criticism of this tape is Stephen Cope's use of proper hindu terms without explaining them, and the length.  I don't usually have 1-1/2 hours to spend on yoga, but when I do - I enjoy the total body stretch the whole tape provides.  I'd like to try the ""Gentle"" tape, but I can't imagine anything more gentle than this one.  In summary, if you'd like a gentle whole body yoga-stretching tape - this is a good one to buy.",1054080000,10,803,4.2368421052631575
7798879,4,1575238896,"I agree with the other reveiwers that this tape is not very ""dynamic."" It is helpful to be familiar with yoga basics and terms, but not crucial, and it is not physically very strenuous.
That said, I must also add that this tape succeeds at fostering the deeper intent of Yoga asanas: the union of body and mind, the balancing and strengthening of prana (life force), and deep inner awareness. I experienced a powerful emotional release the first time I did this video.
I am interested in learning more about the Kripalu approach due this powerful impact.",1046044800,7,554,4.721649484536083
7798880,5,1575238896,"After doing this routine several times I would say that it's not really a routine that seems to benefit me personally but it may be suitable for others.
 I think that is important to mention something regarding the Title. It is called ""Dynamic"" which may lead one to think that it's more of an Ashtanga or Power type routine. This would definitely disappoint someone looking for that sort of practice.
 To me the word Dynamic implies something with more physical intensity and faster paced. Granted it has it's own sort of ""internal"" intensity I guess, but it's very slow moving and a bit long winded for my taste. It is probably perfect for what it's supposed to be though, which is a very meditative approach with long deep stretches.
 For someone looking for a long, very slowly paced routine to bring them into a very calm state of mind this is probably a perfect tape which is why I gave it a five star rating in spite of my personal preferences. It is also very well done in terms of the production values.
 I guess the thing that didn't work for me with this tape was that I just never felt that deep heat and therefore deep elasticity in my muscles because the pacing is so incredibly slow. For someone like myself who does yoga every morning but who wakes up very stiff, this tape may not be quite as suitable as others. With any of the tapes like David Swensons short forms, or the Bryan Kest tapes I find that my muscles get that elasticity that allows me to move deeper into the poses during the long five breath counts, whereas with this I just seemed to get ""stuck"" at my starting ""edge"" of the stretch. Granted those tapes are a completely different style of practice and it's apples and oranges but for others like myself who start off quite stiff this tape may not be a good fit.

 Perhaps besides the ""lack of heat"", the sequencing itself didn't seem to open my muscles up as well. Interestingly enough though, I personally LOVE the Kripalu GENTLE tape which for some reason works better for me (in spite of the fact that it is also pretty laid back and doesn't give you that deep heat) but the sequencing and pacing of that video is perfection for me personally. For some reason, when I do that routine my muscles, even at their most stiff seem to release gradually. In fact I alternate my ""power/ashtanga"" days (I do make a distinction between those two forms of yoga for you ""yoga purists"" out there) with ""gentle"" days and the Kripalu Gentle tape is the one I use most.
 I don't know if this review helps anyone out there but I am just trying to share my impressions of working with this routine. I know that I've used reviews of this sort to help me make decisions on tapes and just wanted to give as accurate a picture of my impressions of it as I could.
 Still, I will certainly keep this tape and try to work it in occasionally for variety, but perhaps I'll try it on days when I'm not quite so stiff or perhaps not as a morning routine. Maybe if I did some warmups before hand that could be a solution as well, the only trouble with this would be that the tape is so long to begin with it could get ""out of hand"" timewise if one had to warm up first.
If you are looking for a more flow style and in my opinion dynamic tape you might enjoy ""Pure Sweat"" from a new series by Rainbeau Mars called ""Sacred Yoga"". It's part of a four tape set in a vinyasa flow style called ""Sacred Yoga"". The first two tapes are more gentle ""For Beginners"" and ""Pure Tranquility"" and the last two are more challenging ""Pure Power"" and ""Pure Sweat"".

 I hope this helps.
 Namaste'",1024185600,18,3585,4.359820089955022
7798881,5,1575238896,"I highly recommend this tape! I was curious about the Kripalu style, because I felt that all styles of yoga are somewhat meditative and I wanted to see if there was really any difference. Well there is. This practice is slow-paced and relaxing, but the long holds make it vigorous--you will notice your heart beating faster and it will definitely improve strength and flexibility. The meditative quality is noticeable right from the beginning. Taking time to do each asana slowly and fully, and reflecting on the pose afterwards takes you deeper inside yourself. By the end of the session, I was in full meditation. It feels wonderful. Completely relaxing, yet vigorous enough to feel like you got a workout too!",992476800,,712,4.941666666666666
