8302450,5,B001FRNBA8,"I love comic books, comix, animation, graphic novels, cartoons, and Hollywood movies, but there is nothing I enjoy more than an excellent documentary. Plus my hobby is learning about the history of comic books and artists, biographies the most. So I relished every minute of this captivating, informative and in-depth doc on the 70-year career of this legendary artist. Marisa Furtado de Oliveira is a talented filmmaker and I now look forward to discovering her other work.
 Best known as creator of the Spirit and for his graphic novels, Will Eisner is a pioneer in the comics industry who inspired generations of artists and is considered by many to be the most influential person in American comics. The film takes you further and discusses at length his pioneering work in a lesser known but very important area: educational comics. As a school teacher AND comics fan, this part doubly interested me. Will Eisner's fascinating life story, his storytelling, and the terrific way it is presented here is very compelling. The interviews were great; I was delighted by the ones with Ann and Will Eisner, and also Denis Kitchen; and Art Spiegelman's voice-over in the opening sequences and elsewhere made it even more perfect. This doc is a gem. You cant risk missing this one.",1456531200,,1277,4.9672897196261685
8302451,5,B001FRNBA8,"I think this is a marvelous 3-part documentary about Will Eisner's long and varied career. Will himself was very happy with the results, and who would know better? The filmmaker, Marisa Furtado de Oliveira, created this initially in Portuguese for the Brazilian market, but it is now finally available in English. It's been shown in over forty different countries, featured at San Diego's big International Comic Con, and countless other venues. I recommend this highly for anyone who wants a capsule history of Will Eisner. Disclaimer: I'm somewhat prejudiced because I'm in it (as Will's American publisher and more) but I'd also be the first to criticize any booker documentary that didn't do Will justice. I think both new and serious comics fans alike will be delighted with this ambitious overview.",1456358400,,804,5.145038167938932
8302452,5,B001FRNBA8,"I loved this film!
It is very in-depth concerning the very long Eisner's career.
I've got to know so much about this incredible artist, from the very first beginning at the Golden Age of Comics, to the creation of the Graphic Novel, when Eisner contacted some Underground Cartoonists such as Art Spiegelman and Crumb, in the 70's.
It is very interesting to see Eisner's influence on the art work of other cartoonists from all over the world.
The great animatics (very efficient and simple animation not interfering much on the original art), shows Eisner's beautiful and clever line.
The Doc has 3 separated  Episodes and my favorite is the 3rd Episode, Master Class; Eisner teaches how he draws and create narratives.
The 1st and second Episodes tells all about the Spirit, his most famous character and the 2nd, The Dream, all about his Graphic Novels from the beginning in 1968 Contract With God, to 1999.
A very and long fruitful career.",1455062400,,941,4.84472049689441
8302453,2,B001FRNBA8,This is an OK documentary. But most of it is subtitled it seems to have been made for TV in Brazil . They almost exclusively only talk to Brazilian cartoonists. And it has some very obnoxious editing. Lots of motion comics with bad voice OVER acting. And they are a little trigger happy when it comes to clip art. Several points throughout an animated ant will crawl across the faces of the people being interviewed. Was there a point to this? Not a very informative documentary.,1395187200,2,479,4.5813953488372094
