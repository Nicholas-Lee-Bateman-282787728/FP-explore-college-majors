2349212,5,B000A1INHQ,"The dvd set above ""The Adventures of Raggedy Ann and Andy "" is for the Saturday morning television series which aired on CBS in 1988. I've managed to get a look at the packaging and disc episode counts and am glad to say all 13 shows are present so this is really the complete 1988 series which lasted one season. All 3 discs come in nice individual thin dvd cases and fit in the main cardboard slip case. There are 4 episodes on Disc One, 4 episodes on Disc Two and 5 episodes on Disc Three.

There has never been a complete series set of this cartoon. Sometime ago there were two dvds out with a few select episodes each and if one prefers that style there will be single dvd editions again with 4 episodes on each. For those wanting the best bargain and having the whole series this is the set to buy.

The total episode list of the series is as follows:

Episode
1 The Perriwonk Adventure
2 The Sacred Cat Adventure
3 The Little Chicken Adventure
4 The Warrior Star
5 The Magic Wings Adventure
6 The Pirate Adventure
7 The Mabbit Adventure
8 The Beastly Ghost Adventure
9 The Pixling Adventure
10 The Ransom of Sunny Bunny
11 The Megamite Adventure
12 The Boogeyman Adventure

8072077,5,B000A1INHQ,"I bought this book as well as the two dolls, Raggedy Ann and Andy, so that I could read the book to my grand daughters when they visit me. The two girls are 4 years and 8 years.  This book and the dolls seem to appeal to a range of ages.  Many of the stories in this classic book were
read to me by my grandmother when I was this age.  The DVD that goes with these dolls is also a good purchase for today's children.
They will appreciate the stories and dolls when accompanied by the animated videos.",1425600000,4,500,4.03030303030303
