8212548,5,6303698441,I totally diagree with the other reviewer. I thought Sean and Olmos were great together on screen. The movie kept me on the edge and Sean looked beautiful as always. I have this movie in my film collection as I'm a huge fan of Seans. I definitely wasn't let down. I would give it a very good rating!!!,1289174400,,301,4.206896551724138
8212549,1,6303698441,"One of the worst movies of all time.  If you remember Olmos from his powerful brooding character in ""Miami Vice"", you'll be surprised to see him with terrible lines, a squeaky voice, and a ponytail.  Sean Young, who played the beautiful android in Blade Runner, simply doesn't know how to act.  The script is terrible.  Literally, 10 minutes in, you'll have figured out the entire plot.  Awful.",1113177600,2,394,4.82089552238806
