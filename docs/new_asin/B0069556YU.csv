4980296,2,B0069556YU,"Leaving most of the many questions unanswered is not that big of a deal as it becomes clear the real purpose of this series is the interpersonal relationships between/among the various players. Why there is a barren landscape and large bugs isn't really important as much too much of anime has mass destruction of civilization/the environment for any number of reasons and it would be a waste of time to come up with still another reason why it happened this time. It was rather interesting watching the sub-titled version and I should have left it alone and not gotten this the dubbed version as I spent so much time reading the subtitles I did not notice just how damn UGLY the characters are,with a possible exception of Felli and only because a portion of her bangs fell across her face. Anime has always had spotty success with noses but this time they look like diseased growths on their faces and,matched with unattractive eyes,it became unbearable to finish rewatching this series. Monica Rial dubbed Felli and did her normal excellent job and,while Collen Clinkenbeard was heavily involved with production,character design was so bad their efforts were wasted. Even if Felli got naked,which she didn't,it cannot be recommended.",1331510400,3,1236,5.004854368932039
4980297,4,B0069556YU,"In the far distant future, people live in large, domed moving cities, because the outside air is poisonous and bug like monsters known as Contaminoids wander the earth. Zuelleni is an academic city where pretty much the entire population is made up of students and everything is run by the student council president. Layfon, a teenage boy with a mysterious past, comes to Zuelleni to escape said past. He wants to start his life anew, as a regular, average student. But too bad for him - upon arriving at school for the first day, he is immediately forced into the military arts program. He is assigned to the 17th Platoon, after leader Nina asks for him to fill a recently vacated spot on the team. The rest of the platoon consists of mechanical ace Harley, sharpshooter and ladies man Sharnid, and ne'in operator Felli. However, it is pretty soon evident that Layfon isn't in any need of military training.....

I actually quite enjoyed this series. I'm not really sure why, since there are many weak points and plot holes. But I think a big part of my enjoyment was the fact that Layfon starts out as an extremely strong fighter. It was kind of refreshing to have a character that didn't need to push his limits of endurance in order to master that next powerful technique so he can save... who or whatever. In addition, Layfon's technique is just really cool. He has as sword, which isn't very interesting, but he also wields a multi threaded whip like device. The threads are made of up his 'kei', so there are as many of them as he wants to generate, they are extremely sharp, and he has great control over them. It was just fun to watch any fight where he used that weapon.

I gave this series 4 stars, but it is really a 3.5. I enjoyed the world the series was set in, I liked Felli and Layfon, I didn't really hate any of the characters, and the plot was interesting. However! There is no resolution in the end. All those questions raised during the course of the series? 2 are answered. Really. Layfon's reason for coming to Zuelleni and Leerin's relationship to the Queen are the only 2 explained. Out of, I dunno, 10 important questions? Yeah, basically 1/5 of the mystery behind the show is explained. The ending was really pathetic.

But despite the (enormous) setbacks, I still like the show and still think it is something worth watching for the random entertainment. I'll probably buy it once a cheap set comes out. But I will forever be disappointed with how the ending was handled (a note here: this show is based on a book series, so I guess the story continues on a lot longer. Still no excuse for how they handled the anime ending though).",1323820800,20,2661,4.539583333333334

4980305,3,B0069556YU,"I sometimes wonder what the point is of anime reviews on Amazon.  Mostly they seem to be ""fan clubs"" for the shows.  An anime series has to be truly awful to get less than about a 4.5 star rating.  Those reviews that attempt to document the flaws of the show seem to get voted down with low ""people found this review helpful"" counts.

Chrome Shelled Regios is apparently ""loosely"" based on a popular series of light novels.  I mostly enjoyed the show, but there were just too many plot elements that went unexplained for me to give it a higher rating.

Spoiler questions follow:

* Was this supposed to be Earth of the future?  Did the human race polute the planet to the point there was no vegetation left and the air was toxic?
* There was a big subplot about the electronic spirits of depopulated Regios causing problems, but it was never explained what exactly they were trying to do or how they were causing other cities' electronic spirits to act bizarrely.
* Towards the end, some characters disguised with ""wolf's masks"" appear that are from some faction that wants to destroy all the Regios.  Who are they and why do they want to do this?  They seem to be related to the giant bug from another dimension that causes the final battle in the series, but this was not made clear.
* A girl named Leerin supposedly has some mysterious power that will help defend the Regios.  This power is never demonstrated and never explained?  She contains the spirit of or is the heir to... well, something or someone.
* In the last few episodes a red-haired guy appears and battles the wolf's mask characters.  He mutters some stuff about avenging his family, but we never learn who he is, where he came from, what's his history,  etc., etc.
* The queen of the city where the Heaven's Blade warriors reside has something mysterious going on in the deep center of her city.  Does it involve her city's electronic spirit?  We see what looks like an empty mould that contained ... something, but this plot thread was never expained either.  The wolf's head characters seem to be after that something.  Do they want to capture it?  Destroy it?  Take it out to dinner?  Dunno.

Sometimes I have the suspicion that the English dub of a series leaves out a bunch of information and maybe the Japanese soundtrack explains it all.  Either that or you are expected to pick up the information from the novels or mangas that a series is based on.  If you just watch the anime, you are often left hanging with a ""what was that all about"" feeling.  That was definitely the case with this show.",1435017600,6,2572,4.5271149674620395

4980326,5,B0069556YU,"This is one of my all time favorite Animes. It's a harem style anime but that aspect of it is blended into the storyline such that it adds to something already good to make it great. It's got lots of action, great voice acting, a good story set in a sci-fi post apocalyptic world, great characters, and a little fan service. A bad-a## main character who because of trouble in his past at first wants to give up his bad-a##edness - this lasts for only a couple of minutes into the show before we get introduced to his power. (The first couple of minutes is a little slow but after that it just gets better and better).

I've watched this show about three times so far and I enjoy it more each time I watch it. It is pretty unique. Many of the elements in it can be found in other shows but I can't think of another one that blends all the things this has together so well and that is so well made and so enjoyable to watch. Sci-Fi setting, super powerful main character, multiple interesting complex supporting characters, action, fighting, monsters, harem, humor, fan service, interesting storylines, back-story.",1398124800,6,1112,4.532338308457711

4980330,2,B0069556YU,"There are many things to like about this Anime, the art direction, a few of the characters(Felli & Sharnid)and the music. Aside from that it falls a very flat on itself. It focuses too much on ""Competition games"" where it could use more lore and world development.
Then it focuses WAY TOO MUCH on people groping the females breasts and making crude comments. The time spent making crude female sexually objective nonsense could have been used for story  development and world lore. Instead we get somewhat soft core grope porn with a flat story. In the end I certainly wouldn't recommend it for children under 15 nor would I consider watching it a second time.",1393977600,2,660,4.739130434782608

4980332,1,B0069556YU,"This was one of the worst animes I have ever watched. The storyline was a little confusing and the backstory was lacking. It felt like it was supposed to be a sequel but failed miserably. I love animes and own at least 100 titles, so for me to say it was just ok, then this anime missed the spot. There were several popular voice actors, but even that fact couldn't save this waste of a storyline. The majority of the characters were unlikable and hard to relate too, and then there were characters that they introduced but I had no clue who they were or what there roles was supposed to play. All in all, I am not happy I purchased this drivel and I have plans to sell it immediately as it's re watch value is non-existent.",1390694400,3,724,4.253623188405797

4980334,3,B0069556YU,"I must admit that this is an excellent series, but unfortunately creates more problems that it can solve (focusing on story). I'm not giving anything specific away when I say that the amount of love interests throws many other characters onto the backburner, which causes a massive 'pileup' of unresolved issues put on the cast that has faded through the series. That aside the animation and art was well done, the music was mediocre for the scenes used, and the story was phenomenal. Sorry to have given this a 3/5 but when it's not finished (no 'true' ending/open ended ending), it doesn't meet my expectations. Still worth the buy though. ^-^",1386633600,2,645,4.81981981981982
4980335,4,B0069556YU,"Nice visuals, an interesting and engaging story, and many hints made this both a good but frustrating deal. The jumps back and forth through time, tied together with the present left the viewer feeling a bit whipsawed. The basic premise combined with some interesting teasers made this feel like it had great potential. Unfortunately only one of many questions was answered by the end of the series leaving this open to a lot of future interpretation.",1381795200,,451,4.947368421052632
4980336,4,B0069556YU,"So humanoids are living on a barren world surviving in cities called Regios.  They have special abilities that allow them to do extraordinaire things to combat alien monsters that are bent on devouring them.  The main character chosen his path and is expelled from the legendary brotherhood of heaven's blades and banished from his home.  He moves to a another Regios in order to find a new path for life and gets sucked back into fighting.

The character development is very good.  I didn't understand the secondary show like a movie concerning the history of the world and how it came to be about. . .but it kind of makes sense.  It is along the lines of fan fare and harem with 5 women vying for his attentions, but he just wants to be friends.",1380326400,,747,4.496296296296296
4980337,2,B0069556YU,"Okay, so before I go on with my review, I'll just point out that I was disappointed in the end and I'll probably give spoilers during half the review. So if you are not in the mood for a sour review or hearing about details that might spoil it, you should probably stop now.

The setting of the story is on some desolate world where people live in domed cities that 'move.' It seems the outside air is un-breathable (series never explains if this is always how it was), the land is crawling with some unhappy bug like creatures (again, series doesn't deem it necessary to explain if they were always there or new to the world), and our strange unexplained moving shelled cities seem to be possessed by some spiritual entity that 'drives' the cities around pointlessly at its own whim. The citizens of the cities seems to be of various functions, but the main city we follow during much of the series - Zuelleni - is comprised of a mix of academic and military students. The main character is a new student to Zuelleni - named Layfon - who was formally of some special elite military group called Heavens Blade (they do actually get into detail later why he is a former Heavens Blade member). Layfon was trying to make a new life away from military, but life didn't go the way he wanted his first day at Zuelleni.

Alright, so one of my issues with the series is throughout I kept saying to myself 'oh, the series will probably explain that later' or 'series will probably explain who that person was later.' Yeah, never does... So you are constantly left wondering, who is that, why do I can about that person, what are those odd dog faced people doing, etc. Ever read a book not knowing it was number three in a series of five books and thinking the whole time you are missing something? That was how this series was the whole time.

Another huge issue I had was during the first episode you are introduced to this group 'Heavens Blade,' who seem to be some elite fighting team to help protect the cities from the worlds creatures. The first episode had some good battles and the team seemed interesting and had unique abilities. Then.... you never really see much of the Heavens Blade group till the last episode (minus some random unexplained cut scenes). Instead the story meanders off in another slow and painful direction about Layfon and the people he interacts with in the city. There are brief moments of entertainment, but the episodes get stuck with petty issues that don't seem to further the overall storyline. So if you watched the first episode and the last episode you might think the series is pretty entertaining.

I think I could go on about a few other things that I had issue with, but they would minor or just piling on. Bottom line, the series was a disappointment. It could have been pretty entertaining if the story had stayed with the Heavens Blade group. If the story was meant to be a character development about Layfon and his inner struggle with making a normal life I could have accepted that, but then the overall storyline made it convoluted. I would strongly recommend against the series. I did give it 2 stars though, why? Because for the current price under the S.A.V.E listing, you can get a great deal of animation for very cheap. I know that is lousy reason to give an extra star, but at least paying $15-$20 for 10 hours of animation counts for something.",1375660800,2,3395,4.542483660130719

4980347,5,B0069556YU,"Chrome Shelled Regios is not a ground-breaking anime as the other reviewers have pointed out, nor it is free from employment of various anime tropes.  Nonetheless, as a great writer pointed out a couple of hundred years ago (who could that have been?) 'there's nothing truly new under the sun,' and for me the question is not whether an anime series is entirely fresh in its approach, as much as how does it handle the material it uses.  In this sense, I believe Chrome Shelled Regio succeeds admirably.  I had a great time watching the show!  I watched it twice.

That said, I really wish there was a season two.  I believe this is the reason for all the plot threads left hanging.  The end of season one left us nicely set up to deal with the plot machinations of this Ignacious character, whoever or whatever he is.  There were some rumors on the web that a season two was on the way but those were circa 2010 so I have to assume that, for whatever reason, it was decided not to produce a season two at all or alternatively, that there was but it never made it to the US. Perhaps a victim, like so much else, of the stagnant economy.

That said, I highly recommend this series to anyone who enjoys the splendid hero kind of fantasy anime. I found the characters highly sympathetic and I enjoyed the artwork even though the design of the battle armour makes everyone look like he has a bust from certain angles. As other reviewers have mentioned, this character starts off very strong.  He has more in common with anime characters such as Vash the Stampede or Train Heartnet than, say, Naruto (not that I don't like Naruto, it's just that as a character, he starts off very weak & only VERY slowly becomes stronger over the course of time. Lafon Alseif is strong from the very beginning). So anyway, please watch this anime and have fun!

8495145,5,B0069556YU,"I really liked this show a lot, I found the universe that it's based in to be very interesting. I thought the art style was pretty nice, and further to that the fight scenes were amazing. Also I thought that all of the characters were interesting. I only had one issue with the show, and it didn't subtract from my enjoyment I just felt it would have been better otherwise.

The issue is an obvious one, there are a lot, like ton of things that weren't explained well, and plot holes left open. Having enjoyed the show and thinking that I would like to know more, I went ahead and read the books. The problem comes from the show being super condensed. There were 25 light novels in the main series. The show is based mostly on the first like 7, but since a lot of the important plot points were a lot further into the books. It seems like they knew the show was only going to run for one season, and stuffed most of the important stuff in. They did it in such a way that the story still plays out well, and that nothing is like super out of place, but that's my best explanation for all the holes.

Anyways, if you aren't the type to be bothered by unexplained plot threads it's an enjoyable watch. It's a good mix of action and drama, but with enough comedy to make you smile.",1467072000,3,1277,4.208163265306123
