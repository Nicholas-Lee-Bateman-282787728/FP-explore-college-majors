The film follows the book fairly closely and apart from the German laughter which seems to be produced at the point of a sword, is well acted. Please bring it out on DVD as my VHS copy is just about worn out",1077840000,6,320,4.35

279846,5,6300255905,"I saw this movie years ago when it first came out.  Ever since I have tried to find a US Region 1 DVD release.. The plot comes from a 1904 novel by Erskine Childers and it is considered the first modern spy story.  When the book appeared it created a virtual sensation in England and led to a complete re-thinking of England's naval defensive strategy.  Set on the North Sea coast of Germany it describes a plot by Kaiser Wilhelm's Germany to invade England long before the first World War.  The plot is ingeniously frustrated by a pair of amateur British yachtsmen.  Michael York does his usual impeccable job.  The supporting cast is superb and includes Simon McCorkindale, Jenny Agutter and Alan Badel.  The sailing scenes are memorable and the movie features a haunting musical score.  For those who love sailing and spy stories, this one is worth having.  Now the sad part, there is currently no Region 1 release.  I don't know why, there just isn't.  If one comes along, be sure to let me know.",1206144000,17,1000,4.593220338983051
279847,4,6300255905,"Elswhere on these boards I have written a review of the Erskine Childers novel of the same name upon which this movie is based,drawing attention to its significance in helping shape British defence and foreign policy in the first decade of the last century by highlighting the threat Germany posed to Britain's Eastern defences in particular .
No such considerations are likely to enter the minds of those watching this movie as they will take it for what it is -a beautifully shot ,and exciting tale of espionage and sailing .
The heroes are Carruthers (Micheal York ) and Davies (Simon McCorkindale)who embark on a sailing holiday off the German coast where they stumble upon German naval plans to launch on attack on Britain .Can they get the news of the plan back to an unsuspecting British government or will the Kaiser's men get them first?

The movie is well acted with York and McCorkindale giving good performances as stalwart British ""chaps"" -gifted amateurs in the Buchan tradition pitting their wits and nerves against the foe. Jenny Agutter is a personable heroine but the best performance is given by the late Alan Badel as the sneering "" Dollman ""

The location shooting is attractive and the score haunting .This is an adventure of an old fashioned kind-no high tec gadgetry or CGI adversaries

We get instead a rousing ripping yarn of good against evil where nerve and sinew matter more than powerful weaponry

I recommend the movie to those seeking a good family oriented adventure yarn with a period setting",1197763200,2,1526,4.857692307692307

279850,5,6300255905,This film has been a cornerstone in my video collection for years. It has a simplistic elegance not to be found in Hollywood today. The characters are developed and acted extremely well and the plot keeps you intrigued with the mystery of the sea and the developing friendship as a background. I was both saddened and perplexed to see that there is no DVD version of this movie. I will watch anxiously for it.,1133740800,4,409,4.54054054054054
279851,5,6300255905,allow me to add my voice to the plea for a dvd.  my collection will forever be incomplete without it.  a beautiful movie for anyone enamoured with the sea and it periphery.,1125532800,,172,4.34375
279852,5,6300255905,"I came to Amazon looking for a DVD edition of this movie (I have the VHS version, purchased years ago) but a glance at the reviews tells me that, alas, there's no such thing.  I was pleased to see, however, that the reviews were uniformally positive, even glowing.  I'm afraid I've a bit of a complex over this film: I've recommended it to several friends who reacted to it with complete indifference, and I was beginning to wonder... well, okay:  There are no car chases, and the women never take their clothes off, so I suppose it isn't quite up to Hollywood standards.  But then again, it wasn't made in Hollywood.

What it does have is excellent acting, some of the most evocative cinematography you'll ever see, and, incidentally, one of the three or four best film scores ever.  As for the plot --well, if anything, it's one of those rare occurrences of the movie actually improving on the book.  I've read Erskine Childers with pleasure, but The Riddle of the Sands is not one of his better efforts: The book is murky and confused, and whimpers its way to an obscure ending, but in the film version the plot has been tightened and the main characters (superbly played by Michael York and Simon MacCorkindale) are far better drawn.  Jenny Agutter is also wonderful in her role as the daughter of the English traitor.

I'll add my voice to the pleas for release of this item on DVD: It richly deserves it, and I for one would snap it up in a heartbeat.",1124409600,11,1457,4.509505703422053
279853,5,6300255905,"Sometimes you find yourself returning to a film again and again,Riddle of the Sands is one of those films that is still great to sit down to even after the tenth viewing. For me it's like an old friend, tried and trusted, a comfort on miserable mornings or grey evenings. It's got everything, adventure,romance,espionage,the sea, sailing and a great cast of characters. I love this film - I searched for years to find a copy on VHS (years before I got a credit card for online stuff)and got lucky in the end but it's one of a few that I'd definitely get again if it were to come out on dvd whatever the format. Highly recommended!",1121558400,6,630,4.439655172413793
279854,5,6300255905,"1/23/13. Finally, this great movie is out on DVD!  The picture quality is great (I only have a DVD...no BlueRay here), the sound is...well, okay, but could be better to take advantage of the great musical score.

This is the kind of film that's like a mini-vacation to a great Northwest Beach. It's easy to watch while you're in bed getting ready to sleep.  Love the detail, the cinematography, and the music. So glad there's the letterbox now instead of the VHS herky-jerky pan-and-scan.

Any film that draws you in to the point that you'd like to be there with the characters is a great film. This is one of those.

7/9/06  I wrote the review below a year ago, praising this film and unabashedly begging for its release on DVD. My VHS tape is wearing thin and, interestingly, the pan-and-scan aspects seem to get jerkier as it ages.

I check back a few times a year to read even more glowing reviews of this film and to see if a DVD version might be on the horizon.

Is there a petition we could sign? A phone number we could call? A government we could overturn to get this on DVD?

Maybe if I wrote to Michael York and explained that I've been a fan since his turn as Tybalt in Zefferelli's Romeo and Juliet?

Hmmmmmm. . .

The Riddle of the Sands really needs to be put in a letterboxed, DVD format.  The story is great, the cinematography gorgeous, and the theme music haunting.  I defy anyone to watch this film and not have the urge to go to the coast and maybe do a bit if exploring and/or sailing.

Please, please, please bring this title out on DVD!",1118793600,8,1560,4.334482758620689
279855,5,6300255905,"Hi,

I concur with the previous reviews. This is great a spy adventure which deserves the full DVD-treatment. Obviously it would have to be presented in widescreen. The current VHS edition of this classic film is horrible due its pan/scan presentation.

Kind regards, Paul",1093824000,12,272,5.159090909090909

7807477,5,6300255905,"A movie of rare beauty.
The quality of the cinematography is almost luxurious and the soundtrack is solemn yet subtle.
The geographic setting is the North Sea coast of Germany, East Frisian Islands, and as we jump in and out of sailing boats and steamers we can feel the sea breeze and smell the salty air.
The actors present us with a sober performance that doesn't hide its perfectness. Michael York in particular is the complete English Gentleman: the fleugm and purpose of Empire builders.
The plot is based on Erskine Childers spy novel of the same name and it is both plausible and well imagined.
There's also a delicious ambiance of early Twentieth Century quite hard to resist and seldom achieved in Cinema.
An unclassifiable gem.",1346112000,,738,4.818897637795276
7807478,5,6300255905,My favourite story of all time is now on the screen. I think the film recreates the mood and suspense of this classic story really well. The actors bring the characters to life superbly and the scenery adds to the truly outstanding portrayal of this great story.,1316563200,,262,4.595744680851064
7807479,3,6300255905,"Well made, and inevitably somewhat dated version of the book, with more emphasis on the intrigue and plotting than I remember in the book.",1307059200,,138,4.791666666666667
7807480,4,6300255905,"An excellent film because of the realistic sea and yachting scenes and the intriguing story,originally written by Erskine Childers in 1903, presaging the danger to Britain of German invasion. Childers was an Englishman, clerk to the House of Commons from 1895 to 1910, served in the Boer War and then in World War I as an aerial reconnaisance Officer; he then went to Ireland, became involved in the Independence Movemant and was shot by the British in November 1922 for being in possession of an unauthorised revolver.

Regarding the purchase, I had not realised that the DVD was Region 2, whereas Australia is Region 4 but fortunately I have a friend whose DVD player was able to cope.",1293667200,,687,4.822033898305085
7807481,4,6300255905,"The plot is very good, one of intrigue, patriotism and betrayal.
But what puts this film apart is the wonderfull boats, the navigation scenes and the great Frisian scenarios. A region ill known but very interesting.
The actors are very good, all of them, and the film puts us in a time when things happened in a more quiet way.
I really recommend it. Wood boat lovers will be delighted",1257379200,,385,4.514285714285714
7807482,5,6300255905,"The story of what happens in the days prior to the First World War when two friends stumble upon a plot that puts England in danger is a grand adventure of the sort they don't make before. There are no explosions, no car chases, jut a great deal of  adventure and suspense. Trust me this is deliberately paced in such a way as to keep you on the edge of your seat. This is a super super film that is one of my all time favorites. I can't say enough good about it.

I need to point out a couple of things about this region 2 release. First its a region 2 release which means you need a multi region player to see it. This is a sin since the film deserves an American DVD release so more people can discover it. Secondly the transfer itself is for the most part beautiful. Frankly the colors didn't look this good when I saw it in the theaters upon its original release. Its a sterling transfer---HOWEVER it is not anamorphic widescreen. yes the picture is letterboxed but unless you noodle with TV it will not fill the widescreen TV picture (actually zooming or bumping it up will cause a slight picture grain). Why a film that was released on DVD in the last two years was not released anamorphic is beyond me, but there you go. While the lack of an anamorphic transfer is not a reason to not get or see the film, it is reason to not pay a great deal of money to get a copy.

I highly recommend this film, the transfer, while excellent visually, is less recommended because it won't fill your big screen TV.",1240272000,4,1507,4.225694444444445
7807483,5,6300255905,"""The Riddle of the Sands"" by Erskine Childers is a wonderful tale made into a terrific movie. Michael York plays an innocent hero drawn into a precursor of World War I, a cat & mouse game with Germans planning an invasion of England. It is a tense mystery story which unfolds on the North Sea marshes between Holland and Germany. The action takes place while sailing along the coast, and ends up with one of the greatest sailing scenes in all of motion pictures.
  It is essential that this movie be re-released on DVD and given a wider distribution; it is so much better than other adventure/action movies!
