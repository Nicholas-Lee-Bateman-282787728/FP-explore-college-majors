1819682,5,B00007LB4B,"Jessica Alba is not the only reason to buy this DVD. Anyone who has seen Hugh Dancy in films/series like TNT's ""David Copperfield"" (which, sadly, is not yet on video/DVD), ""Black Hawk Down"", BBC's ""Daniel Deronda"" and the upcoming ""Ella Enchanted"" will no doubt want to get their hands on this DVD.
Hugh plays John Truscott, an idealistic and naive British diplomatic assigned to learn about the culture and peoples of Sarawak.  There he meets and is ""given"" Selima (Jessica Alba) as a ""guide"" (his ""sleeping dictionary"" who teaches him a thing or two about her peoples' ways).  The two fall in love and come in conflict with his responsibilities as a diplomat, the rules and mores of British society and her ethnic/tribal customs.  Will love triumph over adversity and social constraints?
The cast is strong (with supporting roles by Brenda Blethyn and Bob Hoskins) and Dancy is charismatic and believable as our hero.
Jessica Alba is perhaps a weaker link but the story itself is compelling and you find yourself rooting for our hero and heroine.  It is a sweet love story and Hugh Dancy is so wonderful to look at, that I find it well worth the price of the DVD just to stare at him for 2 hours (superficial, I know, but the women readers will understand).
If you enjoy this film, may I also recommend Hugh in ""Daniel Deronda"" (an excellent BBC period piece based on George Eliot's novel) as well as ""The Bounty"" starring a young Mel Gibson and Anthony Hopkins (which follows a similar story thread to this film).
All in all, I highly recommend ""Sleeping Dictionary"" and I dare any female viewers out there not to fall in love with Hugh once they've seen him in this one.",1044921600,16,1674,4.664406779661017

1819720,3,B00007LB4B,"I should admit that I was drawn to this movie for a few of the more formidable names in the cast -- in other words, I went in knowing very little about the setting or premise. Turns out it's a ""forbidden love story"" set in late-1930's Malaysia. Hugh Dancy plays a British official who's arrived to help civilize the natives; while Jessica Alba plays his sleeping dictionary -- essentially, a concubine assigned to teach him local language/customs while keeping his nights, ahem, occupied. These two wind up falling deeply, genuinely in love, and complications ensue.

The acting from several of the leads was pretty solid. Jessica Alba adopted a sweetly coquettish demeanor that (combined with her general gorgeousness) was fine for the part, though she didn't really ""sell"" her character as an actual Malaysian native. Also, the first half of the movie is played for amusing culture-clash chuckles; while the second shifts into a much more dour tone that doesn't necessarily blend very seamlessly. Beyond that, the setting is presented as somewhat too modernized to be fully believable. There was also the interesting wrinkle of Hugh Dancy himself -- an extremely gifted and mercurial actor with a boyish face that allows him to play a wide range of ages. After watching this movie, I've come to suspect why Mr. Dancy normally sports his suavely attractive stubble. He plays the first half of this film clean-shaven; and perhaps because it was one of his earlier roles, I found myself with the highly disconcerting impression that I was witnessing the deflowering of a 14-year-old boy. Don't get me wrong; this film has its good points. The setting is lush, Ms. Alba is breathtaking, and the acting is largely creditable. Unfortunately, the movie as a whole didn't quite come together for me.",1458864000,,1793,4.996655518394649

1819744,5,B00007LB4B,"I liked this movie for its portrayal of times gone by in the British Empire and the way British administrators solved problems when there were no other means but local ones to use.  Thus enters the Sleeping Dictionary, in this case a very beautiful young woman whose task it is to teach a young British administrator her language by sleeping with him, and in sharing his bed and all that goes with that, shares her language.  She breaks down his reluctance to sleep with her and from there a truly beautiful love story develops. The commitment of the two main characters make the movie interesting and how that commitment unfolds is truly beautiful, and make the movie worth watching.  The scenery and photography plus the revelation of native customs and lives make the movie even more enjoyable.",1453334400,,797,4.802919708029197

1819776,3,B00007LB4B,Hugh Dancy always does well but I was slightly impressed with Alba's performance. There were some low points but overall she held up enough to Dancy.  The storyline seemed a bit  cliche (opposite of Tarzan) though it was loosely based on what was a common practice back then.,1439769600,,275,4.708333333333333
1819777,3,B00007LB4B,"I'm surprised that this was apparently a direct to DVD release.  The production values certainly don't seem to be reflected in that.  It is a beautify shot movie, with beautiful scenery.  The acting performances are as a whole really quite good.  Alba is certainly serviceable; everyone else is excellent. So why then may you ask did I only give three stars?  Part of the reason is while I did buy the love story at first, I really began to dislike Hugh Dancy's character as the movie went on and how he treated Emily Mortimer's character.  Actually making Mortimer's character too sympathetic may have been a misstep by the movie.  While I don't wish she had been a stuck up bitch, she was also too likable to completely root against.  And by the end she was more likable than either of the main characters.  I'm not sorry I watched the movie, but it's probably not something I'd re-watch.

*Spoiler Alert*

More specifically why I became exasperated with Dancy's character: while he was forcefully separated from Alba's character, he was not forced to marry Mortimer's.  There was no reason marry a woman he didn't love and take away her chance of finding love too.  And yes, I can sympathize with him wanting to know his son, but he knows his son is well taken care of and has a caring father figure and yet he screws everything up and nearly gets a man killed in the process just so he can see the boy.  I also might have been a little more sympathetic if he had seen the least little bit torn between leaving is pregnant wife and running away with Alba's character and their son.  When the romantic rival (and to a certain extent her father) become the most liable characters in the movie, you have a problem with you main love story.",1439424000,,1739,4.528846153846154

The movie is set in Sarawak, Malaysia in 1930. A young British officer arrives with high ambitions to continue the work that his father (killed in the war) had started, namely to bring education to the native Iban tribe. He is paired with a so-called sleeping dictionary, in his case a bi-lingual native (Alba) with the intent to fast-teach him the local language using her bedroom skills.

I found all the acting to be pretty decent, including Alba's. She did go back and forth between having an accent and not having one, and also between being an Iban and being Alba. I admit though that being male it's probably impossible to not like her however bad her acting would be :-) . Hugh Dancy was believable in transforming from a stiff British college grad to a likeable young man. Bob Hoskin (self-proclaimed ""god"" in the colony) did a good job representing the values of the motherland while still showing heart and overall being fair and likeable.

The set of course offers breathtaking views of the jungle, and the depiction of the natives is believable. I was glad for the happy ending (I am a sucker for feel-good movies I admit), although how well both Bob's character and his 100% british daughter, now the wife of the young officer, take his departure (after all, they just learned that his wife is pregnant), is of course indeed very nice and shows their maturity as humans, but altogether not fully believable. This would be too good to be true in real life.

This is a movie that shows some of the conflicts inevitable when such different cultures as the stiff British society of 70 years ago and an unencumbered live-in-the-day people like friendly Malaysian head-hunters of those days interfere with each other. It does not go really deep though in explaining the conflicts and will not leave you all stirred up.",1192320000,,2092,4.692098092643052

1819948,4,B00007LB4B,"The English will go on harping on their colonial past for quite many decades still. That past is for them a source of guilt and they cannot erase it or even alleviate it enough to accept it as past and no longer that pregnant with meaning. In this case we are in Sarawak. A young British officer is provided with a native woman who is supposed to teach him the local language in bed. But this is absolutely secret and even denied, even among people who actually know. The young officer of course is supposed to take advantage of the situation then marry a good English girl to abide by his national duty. And that's it. The film of course takes the case in which the young officer falls in love with the girl. Rejection, fake accusations, everything will be used to force the English officer to do his duty, and to get the native girl and other natives out of the way. And yet the film moves forward onto a rather sentimentalese ending that avoids the tragic force it could have had. It also avoids really discovering the native surrounding culture that remains anecdotal, exotic and rather simplified in feelings. Apart from that it is a rewriting of Romeo and Juliet but with the happy ending of an escape into the wilderness. Furthermore, the film points out the real negative dimension of this colonialism : to force a foreign culture, a foreign language and even a foreign life style onto people who should have been able to righteously keep their language, their culture and their life style and evolve from what could appear as a primitive civilization to a more advanced state but on their own logic and dynamic. No one has the right to force any people to adopt a mode of thinking and a life style that does not come from their own heritage and tradition.

1819952,3,B00007LB4B,"The Sleeping Dictionary (Guy Jenkin, 2003)

I have to admit, I rented this for the sole purpose of seeing Jessica Alba naked (well, okay, Jessica Alba's body double naked). The fact that it had a surprisingly high-powered cast I found out later. And despite itself, the movie managed to keep me interested, so it wasn't that bad.

The time: the 1930s. The place: Borneo, the English bit. John Truscott (Ella Enchanted's Hugh Dancy) is fresh out of school and ready to civilize the barbarians. The local guv'nor (Bob Hoskins) and his wife (Little Voice's Brenda Blethyn) try to keep Truscott stiff-upper-lip British while acclimatizing him to the local customs, the oddest of them being that an Englishman's language tutor is also his bedmate-- the ""sleeping dictionary"" of the title. Of course, said sleeping dictionaries are to be used and left so the stiff upper etc. can go back to society and marry a proper English girl. More fool Truscott, then, for his SD is Selima (Jessica Alba), who is, well, devastatingly hot. Needless to say, his upper lip wilts relatively quickly (all the blood must have rushed off somewhere else)-- just in time to find out that the guv'nor is setting Truscott up with his daughter Cecil (Red Dragon's Emily Mortimer), whom guv desperately hopes he'll marry to keep her out of the clutches of Neville (Max's Noah Taylor), whom no one likes.

It's all got that vaguely superior ""but, fatha, the natives are people just like us!"" feel to it that aspires to equality and yet still retains a distinct, though faint, odor of racism-- lily-white chap learns to love the natives despite their barbaric ways and all that nonsense. Still, for mildly offensive formula filmmaking, it's at least watchable, and Truscott's stubborn refusal to let go of his naivete comes off both stupid and, in its way, charming. The characters are two-dimensional, for the most part (Hoskins' character is predictable, but at least slightly thicker than the rest of the cardboard cutouts). You could pull up the English colonials and drop in thirties superheroes, and they wouldn't really seem out of place.

Despite all this, and despite my best efforts, I found myself-- not liking it, really, but not hating it, either. I probably wouldn't watch it again, but I don't feel like demanding my money back.

1819990,4,B00007LB4B,"In the not-so-distant past, young British men, fresh out of university, were sent to outposts of the Empire to practice their administrative skills on one of the many races subjugated by the British at the time. This film follows young John Truscott (Hugh Dancy) as he arrives in Sarawak (now part of Malaysia) in 1936 for his stint - he is idealistic, and full of ideas for educating and civilising the primitives. He is startled to be met by a tattooed native who speaks perfect English, and who introduces himself as Belansei (Eugene Salleh). Belansei takes him upriver, where he meets Henry Bullard (Bob Hoskins), who is governor of the district. Truscott is assigned a hut, a cook (who cooks well, but drinks heavily), and, to his surprise, a ""sleeping dictionary"". A sleeping dictionary, he is informed, is a young woman who will sleep with him and teach him the local language. Truscott is shocked, and upset, although he feels very attracted to Selima (Jessica Alba). He refuses to sleep with her, but offers to learn the language from her. Bullard is angry, because he is rocking the boat and refusing to follow tradition, even though this is the way things have been done for centuries.

Truscott yields to propinquity, however, and falls in love with Selima, and she with him. This love is deepened when they experience danger together. He wants to marry her, but this is forbidden by British traditions, and all manner of retribution will fall upon them should they persist. Instead, Bullard's wife, the manipulative Aggie (Brenda Blethyn), pushes him to marry her daughter Cecilia (Emily Mortimer, who plays this role in unflattering make-up so she looks plain). This doesn't make the other young British administrator, Neville Shipperly (played with superb chinless sleaze by Noah Taylor) at all happy, for he had designs upon Cecilia for himself.

Jessica Alba's acting skills are fairly limited (not that she's required to do much here), and easily surpassed by Hugh Dancy, who does a superb job of English prig on arrival, gradually learning that the Iban, and others, are people too.

This film was shot in Malaysia, and the river and jungle scenery is really quite lovely.

1820015,4,B00007LB4B,"""The Sleeping Dictionary"" was a direct to video film, which is rather surprisingly given both its cast and its look, as borne out by the film winning four DVD Exclusive Awards in 2003 for Best Actress Jessica Alba, Best Cinematography by Martin Fuhrer, Best Supporting Actor Bob Hoskins, and Best Supporting Actress Brenda Blethyn.  This really is too good of a film to be a DVD Premier Movie, but hopefully word will get around, even if it is to check out Jessica Alba wearing colorful tribal outfits.
The setting is Sarawak, Malaysia in 1937, when young John Truscott (Hugh Dancy), fresh out of university (where he tended to read books), has come to serve his Majesty's government as an official of the Empire.  The regional governor is Henry Bullard (Hoskins), who oversees the Iban, a tribe of friendly headhunters.  John, like his father, has a dream of educating the Iban children, but that requires him to learn the local language and customs.  The governor arranges for John to have a ""sleeping dictionary,"" a local girl who will both teach the young Englishmen to speak the language and tutor him in the ways of love.
The girl selected for John is Selima (Alba), who is half Iban and have British.  John initially resists the second part of his education, but in the end falls in love with this beautiful and sensual woman, which violates the taboos of both cultures.  Meanwhile, the governor wants his daughter, Cecil (Emily Mortimer) to marry John, and the situation conspires to give our young hero no choice but to stick to the elitist traditions of his own people.  Cecil and her mother (Blethyn) know about the sleeping dictionaries, but it turns out that neither they nor John know everything about Selima and the solution to John's problems that is arranged at the end of the film's first act becomes unraveled in the second.
This is a beautiful film from writer-director Guy Jenkin, full of stunning visuals of the lush jungle of Sarawak and the native peoples.  Simon Boswell's musical score perfectly compliments the visual splendor.  The only real weakness on that side of the camera is the editing, where key moments are shoved aside to move on to the next scene too quickly a couple of times.  But the strength of ""The Sleeping Dictionary"" is in front of the camera, not only in terms of the gorgeous images but the solid performances from the entire cast.  Even those who are disappointed that there is a body double for Alba in the nude scenes or that her accent is problematic at times are not going to be disappointed they checked out this 2002 film.
Unfortunately New Line Cinema skimped on the extras for this DVD.  All we get is are trailers, mostly for other films, and no insights into whether the sleeping dictionary is a real tradition or part of Jenkins' imagination.  One of the joys of a well made period piece is a look at the fun the cast and crew had with getting it right on screen.",1084838400,70,2924,4.6875

When cultures collide, there are (at least) sparks.  And sparks there are between Selima and John - what a beautiful couple!  Add to the mix a setting that could be the Garden of Eden, and you have a volatile brew!
This potent combination is not unique, however.  Yet what it points out, in a very satisfying way, is that true and legitimate love does not necessarily have to follow the rigid rules of society, religion, or tradition.  One of the truly wonderful aspects of a story such as this is that it reminds us (those of us with open minds) that there is more - much more - than is dreamt of in our provincial philosophies.
What are you defined by?  Who do you love?  And who decides - you or someone else?
Choose.",1083974400,2,1122,4.552238805970149
1820017,5,B00007LB4B,"Just watched this movie not long ago. I love it! Very romantic with beautiful sceneries and beautiful actors! I was so attracted to Hugh Dancy after watching this. Not only was he extremely handsome, charismatic, but also a great actor! Jessica Alba is very beautiful too. Both Dancy and Alba have great chemistry. The 2 reminded me of the characters, Princess Adrienne & handsome thief, Philip Chamberlain, from romantic the novel ""Sweet Revenge"" (you people gotta read this book! It's fabulous!) by famous author Nora Roberts. Dancy & Alba fits the role 100% if this novel ever being make into a movie. Anyway, back to the movie. For those who loves Romance movies with beautiful actors/actresses, this is a MUST watch for you. Girls will be stunned by Dancy's charisma & guys will fall head over heels for Alba.",1078185600,3,814,4.863309352517986

Most Westerners are unfamiliar with the geography of this country. I visited Malaysia in 2001. I immediately reconized the province of Sarawak in Northern Borneo. The events and life style are true to life for the area. The story is one performed many times, and this rendition is adequate. I was definitely taken back to the forest of Borneo and the Iban longhouse.",1068336000,3,490,4.6976744186046515

Except for Bob Hoskins, I couldn't believe a word anyone mumbled in this incoherent waste of film.  There's a good reason why this never made it to the theaters.  Save your money.  Life is too short to spend 2 hours on a concept that might have been done in 80 minutes, and even that's pushing it. I should agree that Jessica Alba is a lovely young actress, and she's nice to look at.  But go to the internet and look at pictures of her instead, if that's what you fancy.",1065916800,7,558,4.226415094339623
1820020,5,B00007LB4B,"This is a great film! Jessica Alba really made this movie. Her presence alone is enough to carry this story. She's a great actress and extremely beautiful. I'm surprised that she hasn't been marketed better. If you're tired of the same old stars, starring in all of the movies at the ciniplex then watch this film and keep an eye for Jessica Alba I think she's an up and coming star. She may need another manager though. There's no reason she's not being cast in blockbusters. In any case do watch this film weather you rent or buy you'll really like this movie.",1061769600,2,562,4.466019417475728

1820022,4,B00007LB4B,"That's really what the movie is all about.  It's a love story that could have turned out just like any ""star-crossed lovers"" saga.  Instead the storywriter chose to let the lovers ... not just Jessica and Hugh...but also Emily Mortimer, who plays Hugh's wife ... NOT make the same mistake their parents did.  They all chose love over duty and yet they were very human and flawed as they went through the process of making that final choice.  It is a well-acted story, generally, with the characters being much more complex than at first thought.  I believe the story itself is the real star here.",1058918400,,596,4.6380952380952385

Having lived several years past in the Far East, I enjoy many of the movies that take place in that part of the world.  The movie's summary intriqued me, so I watched it and was pleasantly surprised!  It's not a great movie, but it is a good movie and a beautiful movie to watch.  Although they opted to go with Jessica Alba rather than to use an Asian actress, Jessica does a great job in her role as ""The Sleeping Dictionary"".  In fact, I didn't realize it was she until I checked the credits at the end.  It's a good look at British Colonialism during the 1930s in Sarawak and the double standards many of the Colonialists possessed. If you enjoy exotic locales, beautiful scenery, and a good tale, give this movie a look.",1058400000,,797,4.315436241610739
1820044,5,B00007LB4B,This movie was perfect.  It isn't the normal piece of [junk]that is floating around video stores today.  It is truly romantic and the fact that Hugh Dancy is hot is a real bonus!,1056412800,,178,4.363636363636363
1820045,3,B00007LB4B,"Jessica Alba and Hugh Dancy lift up this terribly melodrmatic story about the early 20th century, when an Englishman named John Trascott in the most remote outpost in Sarawak, Indonesia, meets a native girl Selima, 'a sleeping dictionary.'  According to the film, the long-standing custom has it that to learn the language of the place, the newly arrived officers are to sleep with the native girls every night.
Pillow talk is the best way to learn foreign words, so the film says, and most guys would agree with that idea.  Not John.  John refused to follow the custom, but anyway you know it's Jessica Alba.  Selima is a spirited girl, but this time it is not futuristic world of ""Dark Angel,"" but deep in the forest of exotic Asia, so who can resist?  But after they come to really love each other, complicated things start to happen, making them look like Romeo and Juliet, only difference being there could be a way out.
The film is actually good.  Acting is superb, especially the two leads, and you got Bob Hoskins, Brenda Blethyn, Emily Mortimer, and Noah Taylor.  The location is perfect because the film was shot there, so jungles look really jungles, not some park in California.  The humid atmophere which must have annoyed the cast and the crew can be felt on the screen, and Ms. Alba looks like the character she is playing, even though, thanks to her former TV appearance, I still feel that she could get out of any trouble, eliminating every one of them in her way with ease.
But why three stars, you might say?  Sorry, it's the story, which can be divided into two parts.  The first, gentler one is much more engaging and charming than the second, contrived one.  Hugh Dancy and Jessica Alba make a truly charming pair, first spurning then accepting each other, and that type of essense makes a really good film, the first-time director Guy Jenkin should have known.  Instead, like Jodie Foster's ""Anna and the King,"" the latter half goes into a maze of actions and intrigues, never knowing how to get out of that gracefully.  Strangely Mr. Hoskins' & Ms. Blethyn's characters suddenly show the wide variety of emotions, which make them look quite silly sometimes.  The film leaps from one emotion to another without giving sufficient time for us to be sympathetic, and in this way undermines the romance between the likable youngsters which should have been left intact.
The film doesn't know how to tell a good story of love.  We don't need to see a ""villain"" in this boy-meets-girl story -- the same kind of mistake James Cameron did in ""Titanic.""  Watch those two stars, and ignore the incredible story.  Only then you can see the true value of ""Sleeping Dictionary.""",1056326400,2,2688,4.7094017094017095

1820047,4,B00007LB4B,"At first, I got curious with the movie because of Jessica Alba.  But, Jessica Alba alone couldn't make me watch it more than twice.  Other elements must be there.  It has an engaging story.  What's nice is that it's not a straight drama, it has humor making it entertaining.  One would be swept away with the scenery.  It has a great cast that gave a commendable performance.  There's definitely chemistry between Jessica and Hugh Dancy.  Regarding Jessica's accent, I don't know what to think of it since I have never come across a member of the Iban tribe so I wouldn't know if hers sounded fake or authentic.  Because of the accent, it's better to turn on the sub-titles just to be sure that one understands everything in the movie.  Since the movie went straight to video in the U.S., people might think that it's a B-movie but it's absolutely NOT.",1052265600,7,852,4.582781456953643
1820048,4,B00007LB4B,"The love story between an English colonial & an Iban girl set in the beautiful jungle was unlike any other love story I've seen.  The movie was not only rich in romance & passion, but also very artistic in settings & different. Beautiful scenery, you'll love it.  ""Sleeping Dictionary"" Jessica Alba was terrific!  Also, it helped me understand much more about another tradition - the Iban, set in around 1930, which was so interesting.
Again, faith can lead you to a destiny you've never thought you would come to.  Love is powerful!
Rent it or buy it and enjoy this movie for a romantic weekend!!",1047513600,,597,4.6571428571428575
1820049,4,B00007LB4B,"Despite a sub-par performance by Jessica Alba, I still enjoyed this movie.  In fact, I enjoyed it more than I thought I would.  The scenery was beautiful, and the story was intriguing to me of an English colonial attempting to learn the language and culture of a people.  Through his education, he finds himself more comfortable with the natives than with his fellow Englishmen.
Hugh Dancy and Bob Hoskins turn in good performances.  In many ways, they keep the movie afloat.  Jessica just seemed a bit out of place.  I've seen her act.  I know she can do a good job.  She simply didn't seem to have a solid handle on her character.  Her accent was about as credible as Kevin Costner's in Robin Hood.  But, I was able to look past this and enjoy this film.
Also, anyone who rents this film with the hopes of ""seeing"" Jessica topless is in for a disappointment.  It is a body-double, confirmed by Jessica Alba herself.  Any time you don't see the actor/actress's face, 9 times out of 10, it is a body double.  And anyone who knows anything about making movies aside from watching them knows that just because the cut to the face of the actor/actress, is not an indicator that it is the actor/actress doing the nude scene.  Anytime the movie ""cuts"" is an indication of a new shot, therefore, not filmed in a single, unending sequence.
So, if you are interested in a good story and some great scenery, than this film should work for you.  If you're hoping to catch a glimpse of Jessica, then you best move on.",1047254400,53,1506,4.485294117647059
1820050,2,B00007LB4B,"My title indicates why this is a straight to video movie. I first starting admiring jessica in the early 90's when she was in Flipper. She was believable then and just amazing in Dark Angel, so it was surprising that her acting was so awful in this movie. The writing could've been better but the nudity issue is indicative of her acting in this flick. A QUICK SYNOPSIS: An Englishman-officer candidate-is sent to a foreign post to learn how to be an administrator. Soon after he arrives he is told that Selima (jessica's character) is to be his tutor in that tribe's language and customs. Since she needs to be with him 24/7 she is expected to sleep with him as this has been the custom for 300 years. He is horrified at first but succumbs to her charms. Then both violate custom by falling in love. Events snowball after this. Back to the nudity argument. You see breasts, but not at the same time you see her face. At one point you see her bare back as she's in bed with the Englishman. As she rolls off him you can see the pasties she's glued to her breasts. She holds back in the lovemaking scenes and seems apprehensive in half a dozen scenes. Jessica is capable of so much more. As the lovers realize their love is causing harm, jessica's performance is less than convincing. Late in the movie, jessica's character is being abused by the new administrator. With the help of a drunk houseboy, she beats up the administrator, but not very well. Anyone who has dated a Phillipino woman or watched Dark Angel knows that Jesica should be able to trash this guy on her own. Thus my justification that Katie Holmes would've been better in the role.",1046736000,7,1648,4.4784053156146175
1820051,2,B00007LB4B,"Calm down, that was a body double, ignorant goofs. An English colonial was sent to a British post in Sarawak (where in the world is that?), during the 1930's era. There ""The Sleeping Dictionary"" was assigned to him and he received the best tutoring session he ever had! Hugh Dancy played the noisy man who thought he had his morals straight, but he didn't. Good thing Jessica Alba was in this movie. She really needed to pull a ""Dark Angel"" on everyone. Even the guy from ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit?"" was insanely miscast as her father! Can you believe it? I really had high hopes for this movie, but it proved to be a huge disappointment. How shamey.",1045180800,3,649,4.508474576271187

So the whole thing feels disjointed - particularly because you wouldn't expect pregnancy and sex to be a part of a fairy tale. Anyway, it's not the worst thing I've seen.
