1882996,5,B00009EIRU,"The Twelve Kingdoms is a very complex and at the same time very intriguing story about a high school girl, Yoko Nakajima, on her way to discover her destiny as the Empress of Kei.  She was initially transported to a strange land where she finds mysterious wild beasts, strange customs, and unfriendly people.  The appearance of the countries in this world looks a lot like ancient China (500-800 B.C.)  12 Kokuki has all the air of a Fushigi Yuugi (FY) but it is darker and more realistic than FY.  It is more logical and reasonable than FY.  The characters are more matured because they have to face the harsh reality from basic personal survival to furious political fights.
 There are many volumes to the Twelve Kingdoms series.  The first set of books is called ""Tsuki no Kage - Kage no Umi"" or ""Sea of Shadow, Shadow of the Moon.""  There are 14 animated episodes devoted to this set with episode 14 as a recap.  ""Sea of Shadow, Shadow of the Moon"" starts off by introducing us to Yoko, the perfectly nice, considerate class prefect (president) of a typical high school in Japan.  She has been having nightmares lately.  One day, a man called Keiki showed up in her classroom and asked her to be his master.  After getting rid of some troubles, Keiki took her to an alternate world and over there Yoko faced a series of attacks against her.  No one came to her rescue and no one came to give her shelter.  No one fell in love with Yoko but she became a fugitive herself being hunted by the local authorities and giant wild beasts.  Feeling betrayed, Yoko became very aggressive, wild, a little bit of cunning, and suspicious of people.
 The story starts off with a good pace but slows down toward the middle and picks up again from episode 8 on.  I literally glued myself to the screen from episode 10 on.  Scenery is stunningly beautiful and the animation is pristine.  The opening scene of the opening overture, the Twelve Kingdoms Fantasia, is breathtaking.  The music corresponds with the scenery by the use of Chinese fiddle.  The Twelve Kingdoms Fantasia reflects the gallantry, the strength, and the courage of a warrior and the outro theme song, ""Getsumei Tuuei"" or ""the Mystic Moon in the Shadow of the Wind,"" reveals the lonely heart of a warrior.  The end credit song is particularly romantic, displaying the soft side of our heroine.
 The subsequent sets of the Twelve Kingdoms series are:
Ep. 15 - 21: ""Kaze no Banri - Reimei no Sora"" or ""Breeze of Sea, the Shore of the Mystic Palace""
Ep. 22:  ""The Book""
Ep. 23 - 39: ""Wind of a Thousand Miles, the Sky of Dawn""
Ep. 40:  ""Riding along with the Moon""
Ep. 41 - still going  :  ""Sea God of the East, Vast Ocean of the West"" - the phrase ""vast ocean"" in its original language is generally used as a metaphor for sadness and unhappy feelings.
 I originally requested Studio Perriot to have Pioneer distribute the American version of the Twelve Kingdoms because Pioneer did such a great job with FY.  Well, I just hope that Media Blasters would do a good job with translation and English dubbing with this beautiful anime.  For more information about the series, check out 12Kokuki's Japanese official website.  It's got pictures, character descriptions, synopsis of each episode, plus all the latest news and products.  Unfortunately, the website is in Japanese but at least you can take a look at the pictures.  ^_^",1061510400,,3379,4.625210084033614

1882998,5,B00009EIRU,"This series is an incredible adaptation of the wonderful fantasy novels by Fuyumi Ono.  The 12 Kingdoms themselves are a kaleidoscopic tapesty so varied, complex and colorful that they entrance with both their real and fantastic elements.  The politics are real and harsh, the customs are strange and intriguing, the culture is rich, and the natural/unnatural life is both terrible and wonderful.  The growth in all of the characters is so beautifully carried out, with rarely a truly one dimensional character in evidence, that you feel you really come to know them as people -- and people who are capable of winning at least your understanding if only some are capable of inspiring  your admiration. The story takes time to unfold but is truly worth the wait, being a web of personal interaction, politics and history.  The animation is more realistic in style than that of many an anime and is wonderfully rendered.  The music is beautiful and matches the art.  All in all, a highly recommended series -- though not something to watch when looking for a lighthearted view.  Now if only a publisher would pick up the novels and let us read all the things the animators probably were unable to fit within their time limitations!",1059955200,6,1229,4.875
1882999,5,B00009EIRU,"This anime starts a little slow but quickly picks up. The story line and characters are all rich in depth .The animation is high quailty and colorful. It is full of magic,fantasy,and sword fights. I have watched the first 37 episodes and can't wait to see the next 31. There are stories within stories that all tie in together. This is an extraordinary epic for anime.",1059177600,,368,4.590909090909091
1883030,5,B00009EIRU,"First of all, to start this off, I would have to disagree with the reviewer who wrote that there would be no characters in disk 1 to like to begin with. For me, it's not the matter of liking a character, so much as it is being able to relate to one. It's so much more meaningful that way. Nakajima Yoko is in the beginning selfish and despicable, yet despite that she's put in the role of heroine for a specific purpose. Juuni Kokki is one of my favorite anime because it has realistic characters, rather than your average damsel in distress or invincible superman. they face dilemmas that are far-fetched but nonetheless manages to grab your attention or belief that it is also realistic. acting on the voice actors parts are done EXCELLENTLY. well, the japanese audio, that is. i haven't heard the english one, and i don't think i'll ever want to, having had my taste of english dubs already.
Now onto my actual rating of the first DVD:
a bit lacking on the extras department, but what english version of any anime isn't, right? now now, i won't be too greedy. visual quality is excellent, as everything else is all-around nice. i won't comment on the subtitles, since i personally think the fansubbed vers. i downloaded and watched was better in terms of translation. i wish that this first volume did come out with a box for the whole series though, like the other anime generally tend to. or i would have to hope for a boxset, because i am a crazed collector of those things. comparing this to escaflowne is not a far-fetched comparison--they're both leaning towards the side of a female heroine, who eventually learn this and learn that, get transported to different worlds, the etc. bishounen. and juuni kokki plus side, beautiful music and beautiful art. lot of drama, political conflict. only difference between juuni kokki and escaflowne is that hitomi, the main character of esca, tends to save the day with her abilities and whatnot. yoko doesn't. she gets pulled along in other people's plots, and she actually suffers to get what she ends up getting. so in fact, if i had to make a personal comparison..
juuni kokki, or twelve kingdoms, is equivalent to a japanese lord of the rings in animated form.
just check it out. i can talk all day about this. you probably don't have all day to decide what you want to buy. your choice.",1089158400,4,2341,4.616306954436451
1883031,4,B00009EIRU,"You're reading this review, and you're thinking: ""Is this going to be worth it?""
The sort answer is: ""Yes, especially if you like medieval fantasy""
The long answer is, well, read on...
I own disks 1 through 4.  Of all the disks, #1 is the hardest to sit through.  This is because you are going to have a hard time finding anyone to like in the first disk.  Stick With It: you'll find plenty to like in the rest of the series.  There is character development.  The plots are interesting.  The artwork is great.  A good value for the money.
The only downside to the disks is the vocabulary: not only are there a plethora of magical creatures (that have their own names), but a whole vocabulary about how those magical creatures relate to the ""human"" occupants of the lands of the Twelve Kingdoms.  (You'll have to watch the episodes to figure out why I put the word 'human' in quotes...)
If this kind of detail drives you nuts, then this might not be your cup of tea.  For my own part, I figure I'll put that part of my brain on ""cruise control"" and wait until the language lesson seeps in.
I plan to get the rest of the disks in the series, in case you were wondering.",1087257600,3,1167,4.292237442922374
1883032,4,B00009EIRU,"Think: ""The Wizard of Oz meets The Princess Bride"".  This first CD should have been subtitled ""Betrayal"", because our heroine gets sold out by pretty much everybody.
I'm typically NOT a fan of stories where the person we're supposed to be rooting for starts out behnd the 8-ball.  And in the case of the first disk of ""The 12 Kingdoms"" our heroine should  have succumbed to ""Sidekick Syndrome"" i.e. dead in the first 12 minutes of the story.
But she doesn't.  In fact, you're left with a clifhanger worthy of Robert Louis Stevenson by the end of the DVD.  You are either going to be hooked, or not.  If not, no harm done, it's an interesting story.  If you are, you are going to have to buy at least two more DVD's to get to the end of this story.  This is anime, get over it.  If you wanted a cheaper addiction, you should have tried drugs.
What really struck me was the ""instructional"" quality of the story: ""O.K., here the heroine is really beeing too trusting for her own good, you can see how this will not turn out well from a mile away. Now here she's over-reacting to her previous bad experiences.  She's just cutting off her nose to spite her face"".
In short, what I didn't like about this DVD was more a matter of personal style than the content.  Overall, it's very good.  I'll give the series a chance...at least 2 more DVD's worth.",1080864000,2,1344,4.375
1883033,4,B00009EIRU,"I was very fascinated by this anime. It's great, all through this first installment...the only problem is the other world that she ends up in. She is brought there by a mysterious man, 'Keiki', and his summoned beasts. The weird thing is that everything from this other world looks extremely cartoonish, and doesn't seem to fit. Once she enters that world, the animation is inconsistent. It resembles ancient China, and that all looks well. However, the way the beasts are done can leave you pretty skeptical at times. But--the story is really intriguing. Youko is well developed, and since she refuses to accept the world she has been dumped into, she grows slowly. The plot advances in every episode, and it's delightful to see Youko grudgingly drawing her blade (since you know she has to accept it sooner or later, apparently later). It's an unpredictable, exciting story.
My main problem is that randomly shoddy animation. I know the series is long and all, but they surely could've done a little better.",1080777600,,1009,4.906432748538012
1883034,5,B00009EIRU,"Just found out it's 96 eps long which makes it about as long as Kenshin. This one's a little bit Fushigi Yugi & a little bit Kenshin. It's apparently based on a series of books(I usually prefer anime based on literature/manga)
Youko Nakajima(Aya Hisakawa/Midge Mays), a girl who tries hard to do well/be liked/fit in(ok, little bit Kare Kano) is approached by a beautiful tall blond man, Keiki(Takehito Koyasu/Kurt Strauss), who tells her to accept his declaration of loyalty/servitude & as soon as she does, all you-know-what breaks loose. Demons attack her in her classroom, but of course Keiki protects her.
They escape to the roof which involves her ""friend"" Yuka Sugimoto(Aya Ishizu/Kirsty Page) & Yuka's guy Ikuya Asano(Yuji Ueda/Joshua Seth) who Youko also has been eyeing. Sugimoto decides she's the one all this is about & insists on going wherever Keiki's taking Youko, so all 3 end up in another land--the magical 12 Kingdoms where Sugimoto does her best to outdo Yui from Fushigi Yugi in the former friend turning on out heroine, & so far, Sugimoto's winning--she's horrid. In this new land, Sugimoto & Asano are obvious strangers, yet strangely Youko's looks have changed & she understands the local language.
This show has action, but isn't overdone(too much action in one ep), the emphasis is on the storytelling, which is great. The land & its rules seem quite real.",1067212800,,1382,4.987012987012987
1883035,4,B00009EIRU,"First off I don't buy dvds until the whole series is out, that way I don't have to wait in anticipation for the release of each volume. That said, I received a DVD sampler from Media Blasters with my new issue of Newtype USA and a partial preview of the first episode was on it. From what I have seen this looks like a high quality series with great animation and an intriguing story. It will be probably a year or 2 before I buy it but I have plenty of anime to hold me over till then. If your not sure if you would like this series or not I suggest buying the new issue of Newtype it comes with 2 DVDs one from Media Blasters which has 4 different shows on it including this one, and one with Saint Saiya and Pretear.",1066953600,,719,4.0
1883036,3,B00009EIRU,"On first appearances this new series appears to be a more or less typical 'magical girl' clone.  Youko Nakajima is a young student who comes from a strict, traditional family, where her red hair is looked on with dismay.  In fact, she is ordered to dye it black to that it won't look like she dyed it red.  Her friend Yuka Sugimoto is an alienated unhappy woman.  Both are friends and competitors for the affection of Ikuya Asano.  All of these teenagers are a bit too hapless for my tastes.
Suddenly Youko is attacked by mythical beasts at her high school, and Keiki, a spirit rescues her.  He is maneuvered into bring along her two friends.  Youka, who desperately wants to fit in and be normal, is devastated by this sudden incursion into her life.  Catapulted into a strange unknown land, she is more worried about what her parents will think than the nitty-gritty of her survival in a hostile world.  A place where strangers such as herself are labelled Kaikyaku and blamed for a series of natural and social disasters.
When Keiki disappears, Youka, who is supposedly a chosen princess given a magical sword, makes a total mess of everything in which she gets involved.  Her weeping and moans so irritate her friends that Yuka finally decides that some mistake has been made and that she is really the chosen princess.  If it weren't for the fact that Yuka is every bit as nasty as Youka is hapless, the viewer would probably agree with her.  In any case, the dramatic circumstances of being uprooted to a magical land where spirits serve fortunate residents (just as they do in Final Fantasy) take place against a backdrop that plays out a complex of dysfunctional personality traits.
So far the story is showing all signs of being a coming of age story where Youko, whose personality has been totally suppressed by her parents and scholl either develops something that resembles self-definition of dies trying.  Hopefully, the plot will avoid being that quite that predictable, but the producers and writers have been in a great hurry to set up that scenario and develop Youko and Yuka into antagonists.  Artistically, it is an attractively done series, set in a land which more resembles China than Japan (we are assured that it definitely isn't China).
On the whole, I can't get completely excited about this series yet.  Although the artwork and music are good, the acting is stiff and the characters not particularily sympathetic.  Perhaps this will shake out in the end, but right not I would recommend a wait and see attitude.  Two technical issues.  I had repeated problems with this DVD in my player.  One which has so far been completely reliable.  In addition, either the original DVD or the Anime Works remaking left the focus a bit too soft.",1066089600,11,2760,4.746331236897275
1883037,5,B00009EIRU,"Twelve Kingdoms represents a singularly brilliant accomplishment in the world of anime. Incredibly addictive and wonderfully crafted, this is unequivocally the best anime series I've seen.
I can make this assertion with conviction, as I've watched all 45 episodes of the Japanese language version of 12K. (And I couldn't wait to purchase the English language releases!) The story of the Twelve Kingdoms evolves beautifully, maturing into a surpassing fantasy epic that stands head and shoulders above the overwhelming majority of anime series. Similarly, Youko, the protagonist of the series, ultimately develops into one of the greatest and most compelling heroines in anime history.
Twelve Kingdoms, Grave Of The Fireflies and the Ruruoni Kenshin/Samurai X Trust and Betrayal OVAs are now the touchstones by which I judge other anime works. Stick with this fascinating saga to its conclusion and you'll be immensely rewarded!",1065398400,5,927,5.535211267605634
1883038,5,B00009EIRU,"This anime is absolutely amazing.
There are just so many things to talk about. First is the beautiful animation. Although the character designs are nothing I haven't seen elsewhere, they are beautifully rendered. Every character's facial expression is so strong, and close-ups show incredible amounts of detail. People in this anime are ugly, beautiful and everywhere in between; each of them have distinct faces. All the movements are incredibly graceful and the fight scenes are some of the most gorgeously animated since Escaflowne or Princess Mononoke. The music brings us perfectly into the scene; the visuals complement the content.
And what content. This series will have you obsorbed from the moment you begin. Each character is portrayed realistically; Youko, although she is the ""good girl,"" is slowly realizing that her darker side is inexorably attached to her. Yuka has a pathetic realism--caught up in the word of fantasy, she wants nothing more than to be the hero of the story Youko seems to figure so prominently in. This desire drives her mad, making her personality increasingly hostile and delusional. Asano, the pragmatic of the group, seems like a nice guy. But soon even his ""loyal sidekick"" nature begins to show it's weaknesses.
The plot complements the series perfectly. We are only given a taste of the plot in this volume, but it manages to keep it intriguing, without pulling Lain or Evangelion-like tactics where the viewer wants to learn more simply because they are so confused. Things aren't confusing, but they are mysterious. And with a 68 episode series, there is plenty of time to develop each plot point.
Some people will compare the premise of this series to Fushigi Yuugi; I can concede the similarities. The vulnerable heroine, the antagonistic friend, the mysterious Chinese empire. But this series leaves Fushigi Yuugi in the dust. There are no Mary-Sue like heroines, whose greatest ""fault"" is their innocence and kindness. There are definitely not legions of androgynous males chasing Youko. And unlike the sometimes cheesy, unrealistic tone of Fushigi Yuugi, every moment in this series hits you hard and makes you think ""I would do that in Youko's shoes.""",1063929600,4,2202,5.153631284916201

7990830,5,B00009EIRU,"The Twelve Kingdoms is a well-written, magnificently drawn high fantasy adventure series, if one not necessarily to the taste of all anime fans. It stands well off to the ""naturalistic"" side of anime, where the women have normal bosoms, where the warriors fight without taking timeouts for bombast, and where the female lead doesn't spend any time pining after that cute local lord with the big sword and the brooding angst. There is, instead, an abundance of drama, beauty, thought, and humor, all painted on a wondrously enchanted canvas.

The series is based on the best-selling novels of Fuyumi Ono. Forty-five episodes on ten disks provide plenty of room for monsters, swordfights, battles, murder, and intrigue, neatly interwoven with Fuyumi's meditations on character and leadership. The gorgeous backdrops and naturalistic character designs can be stiff or enchanting, depending on your tastes. The musical score ranges from haunting Chinese traditional to thrilling modern classical themes. I found myself listening to the opening credits at each episode on the disk, just to get back into the mystical atmosphere of the story.

The four stories told in the series combine personal journeys with tales of war and political intrigue, a kaleidoscope of characters and creatures, battle scenes that do not flinch from showing the ravages and random violence of war, and a number of asides to educate the viewer about the language and laws governing the Twelve Kingdoms.

""Shadow of the Moon, Sea of the Shadow"" (Episodes 1-13)

The series begins, as apparently all great anime adventures must, in a Japanese high school. Youko Nakajima, an attractive, popular girl, is president of her class, but is nonetheless plagued by self-doubt. When an exotic looking man called Keiki--actually a kirin, an Asian unicorn of immense spiritual power---suddenly appears in her classroom, she is both baffled by his offer of eternal fealty and frantic about the gossipy comments from her classmates. Youma, demonic monsters in the shape of luridly transformed animals, attack the school and attempt to kill Youko. She agrees to accept Keiki's offer and his servant youma carry her and two companions off to the world of the Twelve Kingdoms. There, she learns Keiki has chosen her as queen of one of the twelve realms. Pursued by assassins and youma, she must try to survive and understand what has happened to her.

As events separate Youko from the kirin, she finds herself stalked by monsters, a turncoat companion, a taunting nightmare being, and a mad king. While Youko cries a bit more than the average anime heroine, she has plenty of reason to do so. Her upbringing has left her ill equipped, physically or emotionally, for this violent, hardscrabble world. This is a tale where the goal is less the throne of a kingdom than it is Youko's attempt to recreate herself and become worthy of it. The story follows her as she desperately fights to stay alive, to adapt, and to keep her sanity. If she cannot learn to tell friend from enemy, to believe in her own strength and judgment, she will perish and everyone she meets on her journeys will suffer for her failure.

""Sea of the Wind, Shore of the Labyrinth"" (Episodes 15-20)

Tentei, the creator god of the Twelve Kingdoms, provides each realm with a guardian kirin, a powerful spirit being, wise, pure of heart, and endlessly compassionate. However, ruling a country is a complex matter, requiring knowledge of both good and evil and the ability to make harsh decisions at need. Consequently, the rule of the kingdom is given to a human, a man or woman selected by the kirin through its semi-divine intuition and rendered immortal as long as he or she rules in a way that does not poison the kirin's compassionate spirit. This arrangement, even though divinely ordained, often fails to produce peace and just rule. Such is human nature and folly, and such is the limit of even a kirin's wisdom.
In the Twelve Kingdoms, humans and kirin are not born of the body, but from ranka, the fruit of sacred trees. Parents wishing to raise children gain them by praying at a holy site. Kirin are born of a tree on the sacred Mount Hou, where they are tended by priestesses and guarded by lesser gods. A shoku can carry off fruit from a sacred tree to Hourai (Japan). That child, called a taika, is born to parents in our world in the usual fashion. In the stories, Youko is a taika, as are Shoryu, the King of En, Rokuta, the Kirin of En, and the black Kirin called Taiki.
In the story arc, the tale of Taiki is related to Youko as she meets with Rokuta and Shoryu on Mount Hou. Taiki, like Youko, was brought up in Tokyo and was carried off to Mount Hou as a young boy, ignorant of his true nature. The Sea of Wind, the Shore of the Maze is more a character study than the other story arcs. As Rokuta and the priestesses narrate the tale, we learn how a child from Japan came to terms with the powers, the dangers, and the responsibility of a semi-divine destiny. We also learn how he fulfilled the duty of judging someone fit to rule the kingdom of Kei.

Sadly, this story arc could easily have been subtitled ""First of Two Parts,"" as a mystery is revealed in parallel with the main story. Sugimoto, who traveled to the Twelve Kingdoms with Youko and returned to Japan battered but wiser, realizes that a strange boy in her neighborhood is more than he seems. She suspects, and we know, that this is Taiki, somehow exiled again to Hourai, his memories lost, sickened and alone. His kirin nature makes it difficult for him to pass as a normal boy. Worse, he is guarded in his exile by youma, and people who threaten him are mysteriously injured or killed. The story of how the young black kirin and the ruler he chose were driven from the Kingdom of Tai was left unfinished by production problems with the series.

""A Thousand Miles of Wind, The Sky of Dawn"" (Episodes 23-39)

The third story arc of The Twelve Kingdoms is a grand, complex adventure. We begin with the three young women in three different kingdoms fighting to gain control of their lives and destinies. Their stories are interwoven with a sophisticated tale of political intrigue, brutal oppression, and rebellion in a province of the Kingdom of Kei.

Youko, the newly enthroned Queen of Kei, is profoundly aware of how little she knows of her land and her duties. She flees her palace, leaving the realm in the hands of contemptuous ministers while she tries to learn how to lead and rule. In the Kingdom of Hou, Shoukei, a tyrant's daughter who lived through his reign as an ornament in the royal palace, is cast out of the palace after outraged lords rise up against her father and kill him before her eyes. Too consumed by self-pity to be of use anywhere in her homeland, she decides on a whim to go to Kei to meet and overthrow the girl queen who has all the wealth and respect she has lost. Finally, in the Kingdom of Sai, a serving girl named Suzu also hears of the new queen of Kei. Suzu is also Japanese, carried off to Sai by a shoku a hundred years ago. She escapes from the abusive priestess who has been tormenting her for so many years and flees to Kei, hoping that Youko will free her and take her in.

The mix of secondary characters in ""A Thousand Miles of Wind, The Sky of Dawn"" is dazzling. The story involves conspiring court officials, monarchs both good and evil, corrupt governors and generals, a psychotic town boss, cut-throat soldiers and kindly mercenaries, shape-changers, rebels, and many common folk just trying to survive hard times. Trickery and maneuvering by all the characters and factions bring them together to fight for control of a province of Kei and the attention of Kei's ruler. Even as they do so, Youko hides among them seeking to gain control of her throne and bring peace and justice to her realm. The result is a rousing double ending to the story arc and a profound change in the lives of all involved.

""Sea God of the East, Azure Sea of the West"" (Episodes 41-45)

Five centuries ago, soon after the kirin Rokuta brought the new king Shoryu from Japan to take up the throne of En, the new king faced a possible civil war. The chaos caused by the death of the last king had left En, a devastated and impoverished country. Shoryu's opponent, Atsuyu, was young, popular, and just and wise in the arts of war and governance. He held the respect and loyalty of much of the kingdom, while Shoryu's intentions and worth were suspect. The last completed story arc of The Twelve Kingdoms is the tale of this conflict, related by Shoryu to Youko as a parable. Was there any great difference between the two men, the one who succeeded, and the one who failed? Who would truly have made the better king?

Amid the tangled intrigues and plotting, we learn more of the centuries-spanning big brother-little brother friendship of Rokuta and Shoryu. Both man and kirin were born and lived amid the savage wars of feudal Japan. Rokuta, now the embodiment of the Kingdom of En's spirit and conscience distrusted kings and hated violence. Shoryu, a stranger to the land in that time as Youko is in her time, needed to win the kirin's trust as well as the kingdom's. As the tale of Shoryu's duel of wits with Atsuyu unfolds, we side with the king, but we come back again to the grave Shoryu visits at the beginning of the story, wondering, as he does, if there can be any final judgment.

Episodes 14, 21, 22, 31, and 40 of the series all either review the past story arcs or fill in details about the personalities, people and culture of the land. People who enjoyed the series regret not just the two dozen or so planned episodes that were never finished, but many more stories that could have been told from Fuyumi Ono's published works. Even a casual viewing of the series suggests many more tales to be told. What of the other kingdoms, the ones described only in passing? What of their monarchs, their kirin, their cultures, and their traditions and artifacts, of which we learn so little? What purpose do the lesser gods of Mount Hou serve in the world the Tentei has created?

There are far less colorful and intricate worlds than this that have run on to series after series in the history of Japanese animation. Possibly this one will find a creative team with the means to build on what has already been done. For those who have already felt the wonder of Fuyumi's creation, it would be wonderful to get lost amid The Twelve Kingdoms once again.",1188259200,,10494,4.663783783783784
7990831,5,B00009EIRU,"At first, the set-up for Twelve Kingdoms is very similar to Fushigi Yuugi: A rather annoying whiny schoolgirl and her friend get sucked into another world similar to ancient China, can't get back home, get separated and have a feud and have lots of adventures. But fortunately for us, the resemblance ends there.

While Fushigi Yuugi's charm is fueled by the characters' relationships, the Twelve Kingdoms is far more layered and focuses more on individual character development. The main character Youko Nakajima develops from a very insecure and self concious high school girl to an introspective and self-aware young monarch of the Kingdom of Kei.

I admit that Youko's initial whiny and weepy personality was very annoying to watch. And there is some violence and depictions of cruelty, so this series is not meant for the younger ""Pokemon"" audience.

But the payoff for watching this beautifully drawn and splendidly imagined series is enormous. Twelve Kingdoms is a complex, deeply layered fantasy world whose scope rivals that of Harry Potter or Lord of the Rings. The soundtrack is beautiful and the introductory music is unforgetable. The best thing about this anime are the life lessons it teaches. The characters learn that despite terrible adversity, one should never give up!

Twelve Kingdoms is definitely my all time favorite anime! So to all anime fans out there, I'll use a line often used at the end of the episodes, ""You won't want to miss it!""",1128816000,9,1463,5.033057851239669
7990832,5,B00009EIRU,"From the cover you may think it is an anime for girls, but it is for both, girls may enjoy it, boys probably will enjoy it. It is a slightly morbid story with a relatively slow and unstable start. But it gets its story going in the second half of the first eppisode. I would recamend this anime to anyone who likes a bit of blood and a fantastic morbid story. I would recamand if you like this anime to try ""Wolf's Rain"".",1122854400,,421,4.0843373493975905
7990833,4,B00009EIRU,"If you're familiar at all with Japanese anime or manga you'll find that the story of a young boy or girl being thrown into another dimension and spending the whole series figuring out why they're there is nothing new. But like any good myth, the story is familiar but its the METHOD and SKILL of the storytelling that distracts from the cliches. Twelve Kingdoms is done on a more epic and yet more personal scale than most anime of this type, with the exception of Escaflowne.

High school class president Youko Nakajima is a good girl and liked by everybody and the hardest thing she has to face is her parents telling her to dye her flaming red hair. That is until a mysteriously clad young man named Keiki shows up at her school telling her she has to leave with him because it's the only way he will be able to protect her from her enemies. He doesn't mean a class bully, he means a giant roc-like bird whose attack on Youko endangers the lives of her classmates. He gives her a sword only she can wield to fight against the awesome forces arrayed against her, for reasons she has no clue about. Keiki takes Youko and two of her classmates to another world, a world of magic and 12 kingdoms and spirits that take the shape of animals and humans. Along with Youko is Sugimoto, the class loner who Youko pities, and whose delusional visions and readings of Japanese legends makes the new world her dream come true. And then there's Asano, who both Youko and Sugimoto like. In the land of the Twelve Kingdoms, anyone who comes from our world is hunted down and killed because their appearances coincide with disastrous events.

This first volume started off a little confusing but once you get into the groove, it gets better. There are lots of deep issues here, including the loss of innocence, the desire to belong versus your individuality, and the gaining of spiritual strength. The animation was great and some of the best quality I have seen. The story is epic. I did get sick of Youko at times. She seems to be maturing but she spends a lot of time here crying and having hissy-fits. She's getting stronger though. Seek this out.",1118793600,3,2137,4.51937984496124
7990834,5,B00009EIRU,"I won't get into the plot of this series, because that's already been done by others.  What I will say is, I love this first volume because it draws you in by combining excellent writing with very good pacing (unlike a lot of other ""adventure anime"" which compensates for lack of plot by racing through what plot there is).  I also like the non-human characters, who all have motives of their own.

There are elements of stories like Lord of the Rings, Neverending Story, and others, but the way in which this is told is probably best with a ""Japanese accent"".",1107129600,,560,4.524752475247524
7990835,5,B00009EIRU,"Seldom in animation does a story told through this unique medium reach the hights of the Twelve Kingdoms. This series demands a great deal from the viewers and rewards them with the kind of character development that is hard pressed to find. If you choose too watch this series you will learn the vocabulary of the Twelve Kingdoms but more than that, you will learn about yourself. Because the characters of the Twelve Kingdoms are so thoroughly fleshed out that you cannot help but identify with them. Enjoy.",1089763200,2,509,4.795454545454546
