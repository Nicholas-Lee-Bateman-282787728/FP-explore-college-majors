8376031,4,B002OHROO2,"Rocket Robinhood came from a very eclectic period in television when the format was less defined and wide open to artistic license. So if you grew up watching this program, you will immediately remember (and understand) it's jerky editing and oddly placed musical introductions. If you are new to this format, you will be lost on it's production values. RR is very much a generational piece that does not reveal itself to be stretched beyond the bounds of the children watching it during that period. It was cheap eye candy that will have nostalgic value to those who remember it. Fans of the show will be surprised by it's rich images and suitable sound quality. Nothing that will compete with your standard Blu-ray values. But plenty of popping color and sound that will transmit your senses back to the late 60's when anything was possible on television. A worth while investment for kids of that era.",1339632000,11,904,4.801282051282051
