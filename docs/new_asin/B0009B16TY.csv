2274648,3,B0009B16TY,"I remember this series well...unfortunately.  Oh, don't get me wrong!  I'll still order it, just so I can add it to my ""Bewitched"" collection.  But, I have no delusions about how terrible this series is.  It's not terrible in a campy, John Waters kind of way.  It's just plain terrible.  Lisa Hartman (later, Hartman-Black) was an odd choice for Tabitha in the first place, and had none of the charm of Elizabeth Montgomery.

One of the sure signs that this show was destined for cancellation was the fact that they couldn't get a single person from the original series to star in it.  They had to settle for the occasional walk-on from people like George Tobias (Abner Kravitz), and Billy Hayes (""Witchiepoo"" from H.R. Puffnstuff) who played a random witch in the ""Bewitched"" episode entitled ""Hansel and Gretel in Samanthaland.""  Other than that, they were stuck with David (Back-Into-Obscurity) Ankrum playing Adam (who they re-wrote as a Mortal, even though Adam clearly showed that he was a Warlock in the original series episode ""Adam, Warlock or Washout?"")

In short, this is a must-have for serious collectors of ""Bewitched"" stuff.  A mediocre find for others, at best.",1116115200,15,1177,4.954081632653061

Keep an eye out for some of the characters that reprise their roles from ""Bewitched"" here. They're nice to see again, even if some of them look a lot older (time does that to you, witch, warlock or mortal).
I'm enjoying this a little more than Bewitched, because although Tabitha refrains from using magic, she isn't shy about it, and doesn't have anyone beat her over the head for doing it.",1417564800,,595,4.274336283185841

2274680,5,B0009B16TY,"I likely have a different perspective on this series than many viewers, being that I'm not all that familiar with the run of 'Bewitched.' But being an avid fan of '70s TV, and the half-hour sitcom format in general, I find 'Tabitha' to be a highly enjoyable show. Lisa Hartman is charmingly unaffected in her portrayal of the title character; Karen Morrow is a hoot in her role of Tabitha's ""Aunt Minerva; and the late Robert Urich strikes a remarkable balance between egocentric and down-to-earth in his characterization of ""Paul,"" the TV show host for whom Tab is a production assistant (and love interest).

The story lines revolve around both the professional and romantic life of Tabithaboth of which Aunt Minerva is endlessly meddling in (much to the chagrin of her niece, who thinks very fondly of her nonetheless). One way or another, friends and co-workers of Tabitha's, such as boss Marvin (played by the late Mel Stewart), end up a part of the madness. The tone throughout each episode is bouncy and zany, with the occasional mild suspense element playing into the prevailing ""magic"" elements. The consistent presence of fun scripts supported by appealing, talented character actors makes for the all-around ideal escapist viewing experience.",1401408000,,1253,5.08252427184466

2274684,2,B0009B16TY,"No wonder this was axed.  Don't get me wrong, Lisa Hartman is smoking hot, but I found her performance a little too cutesy for my liking.  Thankfully she had a good singing voice to focus on after the series came to an unsurprising end.  I much preferred the unaired pilot and, had this version been sold and pursued, I think it quite possibly would have become a hit - especially considering it was directed by ""Bewitched"" producer/director, William Asher.  It had the same kind of ""air"" about it as ""Bewitched"" did before it.
For people, such as myself, who have, embarrassingly, watched the complete ""Bewitched"" series at least 20 times (had a lot of time on my hands in my younger years), it was actually hinted towards the end of the eighth season that Adam might indeed possess some kind of magical powers.
By the way, to those who have this series - did anybody pick up the director to the far right of the screen in the first scene of episode 10?  After Tabitha is cut off whilst turning into her work parking lot by a man in a red Bug, there's a hand with a clipboard signalling for the man to drive forward.
Pity no revamp of ""Bewitched"" or its spin-off, ""Tabitha/Tabatha"" (both spellings were used in ""Bewitched"" in different episodes) has been attempted since.  By this, I don't mean the movie which, as far as I'm concerned, was just too pathetic to associate with the original.",1388707200,2,1391,4.566265060240964
2274685,4,B0009B16TY,"Yeah, okay Im old, sort of. I loved Bewitched when it was on and crushed on Elizabeth Montgomery.
the show was simple fun and not brain dead like so much else back then. It spoke about women's equality, race relations, gender relations, species relations(?).
it was fun and it sort of gave out stuff to think about in a sneaky way of not telling you to think about it. You just went, yeah that sort of makes sense. (Hey I was 4 when it started. Didnt like Adam, didn't like the second Darren, and thought Maurice would make a great uncle. Better than insane Uncle Arthur.

So there I am 17 and a new Bewitched with a grown up Tabitha starts. Lisa Hartman, every week, all perky and bouncy and happy. every time she smiles I want to smile She just has that sort of personality that doesnt seem to exist anymore. did i mention I was 17 at the time.

The show is not great, in fact its is written worse than Charlie's Angels was(yes, that bad) mostly. Its very light on plot, mostly just Robert Ulrich being an ass about, whatever that week was about.  but I like it. Im not certain why but I still like it.

It won't tax your mind and NEVER watch more than a couple of episodes at a time, but its a good light background sound to have on while you're doing stuff. just like back in the late 70s.

come on. you know you want to see it again.  she's just so cute.",1379116800,2,1359,4.1679389312977095

2274691,3,B0009B16TY,"The film quality was good, no problems there but the series lacked the witty script and scenerios the original ""Bewitched"" had.

2274692,4,B0009B16TY,"I thought that famous song would be a good title for my ""Tabitha"" review, since the scripts are bothersome and my attraction to this show is bewildering.  The truth is the plots are just dumb; they lack the clever quirkiness of its parent show ""Bewitched.""  And yet, I still like it...for what it is.  And what it is happens to be very fluffy entertainment with some charming actors (some of them O.K., some of them horrendous) in a fun time period, 1977/78.  Don't look for it to be anything more, and you might enjoy it...like comfort food.  So, let me tell you why you might like this Twinkie of a show.

The fresh-faced, adorable Lisa Hartman plays Tabitha Stephens, the daughter of Samantha and Darrin of ""Bewitched.""  She inherited her mother's witchy powers, but she is trying to make it in the mortal world.  Various dating conundrums and idiotic situations prompt her to twitch her nose, however.  Her mind-numbingly dullard brother, Adam (David Ankrum), takes on his father's mantra and wants her to live strictly as a mortal.

Tabitha drives around L.A. looking cute as a bug in her yellow VW Bug.  She works at KXLA Television as the production assistant for loose-cannon T.V. host Paul Thurston, played by the wonderfully good looking Robert Urich.  He and Tabitha have an off-and-on flirtation that leads to dating by the end of this one and only season of the show.

There are 12 episodes with good DVD quality.  Of note, is the music.  Lisa sings the opening and closing theme (which is particularly dancey - I find it funny and good, all at the same time).  Some of the music between scenes also has an uplifting, jazzy 70's sound to it.  Also included is a pilot with an entirely different cast and feel.

Note to ""Bewitched"" lovers:  You won't see Samantha, Darrin or Endora in any of these episodes.  You will see Dr. Bombay and Gladys & Abner Kravitz, however.  Tabitha's Aunt Minerva (Karen Morrow) serves as family and all-around mischief maker.  You will see a few recognizable faces as guest stars, too.  Mary Wickes, Dick Wilson (who played the drunk on ""Bewitched""), Fred Willard, Dack Rambo.

""Tabitha""  may not rank among the best T.V. shows, but it has a feel-good quality to it and that's always kind of...magical.",1344297600,2,2245,4.739018087855297
2274693,5,B0009B16TY,For a short lived show this is a good spin off from the Bewitched show.  I enjoyed the original pilot.  Great staff of actors.,1326585600,,126,4.208333333333333
2274694,3,B0009B16TY,"I first caught an episode of this on TV Land early in the morning back in 2004 I think and it was OK. It was no Bewitched but it was OK. Now after seeing it seven  years later it's still...OK.

But if they were going to do a spin-off, shouldn't they have at least stuck to the actual history of the show? Quite a few writers from Bewitched worked on this show and the show was probably in reruns (I wouldn't know, I wasn't born yet) so they shouldn't have been able to screw it up. I'm not talking about the fact that they aged Tabitha, soap-operas do it all the time, I'm talking about, of course, the fact that Adam is now the older child. Even though it's only mentioned in the first episode when he calls her his ""kid"" sister, it's never brought up again in any of the following episodes! She never refers to him as an older brother, so for all we know she still is the older child. Also after the first few episodes, he never seems to care or notice about her doing witchcraft and hardly features in the show at all in several episodes. Also this disregard of Samantha's side of the family seems odd. He mentions it once but it just bugs me. How could someone with a mom as a witch, who probably taught him growing up to accept witches and other than their powers, are just like everybody else, end up so spiteful? Even if Darrin tried to interfere, I'm sure her relatives would've had a thing or two to say about it. I know we never see the five years in between Adam being two and twentysomething but it's a stupid thing to do just to have a Darrin-esque character. Especially when it was revealed he had powers in the first place! Aunt Minerva I enjoy but not as much as Endora. You see a hint of antagonism between her and Adam but it never amounts to much. I know, I know, twelve episodes and all but consistency would've been nice. She also isn't as confident as Endora, who would obey the Witches' Council but I never got the feeling that she outright feared it as Minerva displayed in the Halloween episode and the final episode. The mortal characters are just BORING! They try to make Paul the romantic interest but for one or two episodes, she never admits that she has a thing for him. She's always pushing him away when he hits on her so what was the point? Would she have eventually liked or fell in love with him had the show continued? And I don't know if anyone else caught this or not but in the final episode, Mary Wickes' character states Samantha and Darrin had been married for 25 years. Which means since they were married in 1964, then the show would take place in 1989! The disco era lasted a little longer than I thought.

The actors are OK, there's nothing special to write home about but I am glad they went with Lisa Hartman as Tabitha. She resembles Elizabeth Montgomery and pulled off her mannerisms very well. Everyone else was just alright. Having Dick Wilson, Sandra Gould, George Tobias and Bernard Fox make guest spots were good and they should've had a couple other original characters pop up. I know Elizabeth didn't want anything to do with it, Agnes Moorehead had died and Dick York probably didn't work much after he left Bewitched (I don't know if he did or not) but what about Dick Sargeant? David White and Kasie Rogers? The only thing from the 70s I saw David White in was a fleeting cameo in a third season episode of Wonder Woman!

The effects seemed dirt cheap compared to the superior effects from Bewitched (it's like Superman IV but on a mircoscopic budget). Other than the continuity issues mentioned above, the writing was OK. I think the only episodes that captured the feel of Bewitched to me was ""The Arrival of Nancy"" (William Asher directed) and the final episode. It was good, however, for the Witches' Council to progess and accept mixed marriages. I don't think enough time had passed between Bewitched and Tabitha. Maybe if they had actually waited until the 80s or when Erin Murphy had gotten older. The writing could've been a little fresher too, most if not all episodes feel like bad rehashes of older Bewitched episodes (even the rehashed scripts from Bewitched were better).

I guess I should also mention the original pilot. I couldn't get past the first 10 minutes. Liberty Williams (the voice of Jayna from the Super Friends) didn't remotely resemble Elizabeth Montgomery. I think the only thing they did right was keeping Adam as a warlock and having him encourage Tabitha to use her powers. It makes sense when compared to an up-until-now never heard of Aunt (though to be fair, Samantha had many relatives on Bewitched who popped in and were never mentioned again).

It's an OK spin-off but it could've been better if they had just waited a little while longer.",1323561600,,4739,4.491879350348028
2274695,3,B0009B16TY,I thought there would be more of Endora and Serena or Aunt Clara in this show.  I would have love to seen Darrin and Samantha.  It is an alright show but it was nothing that I was use to seeing with the original Bewitch shows,1318809600,,225,3.977777777777778
2274696,4,B0009B16TY,"The inconsistencies on this Bewitched meets Mary Tyler Moore one-year sojourn are notable, but is this a crime?  I think not.  Lisa Hartman is so cute and likable as Tabitha that you can believe her being Elizabeth Montgomery's daughter.  Question:  Why is David Ankrum now BIG mortal brother when on Bewitched he was little warlock brother.  The one-off pilot included here with Liberty Williams and Bruce Kimmel shows how much more fun Adam would have been had they stuck to the original format.  Then we might not have needed Karen Morrow who plays the sometimes cute and sometimes annoying Aunt Minerva, who is a cross between Endora and Esmerelda.

How about that Dick DeBenedictus score--or those TWO before they decided it was best to let Hartman sing the theme song and save the disco-jazz era music for the background.  LOL, it doesn't much matter, because the fashions of the time make the show very, very of its late 70s time.

Robert Urich is a younger version of Ted Baxter who morphs later into Spencer for Hire, and Mel Stuart Isn't exactly a crabby boss, so I wouldn't mind working for him.  Favorite episode?  Definitely the very first one with pre-Diagnosis-Murder-with-dad Barry Van Dyke as Tabitha's boyfriend and Paul's refusal to take energy conservation seriously until Tabitha wiggles her nose.

So, is this show magic?  Sometimes, and sometimes not.  At any rate it's fun, and fun doesn't hurt anybody.  Sit back and enjoy when you want a nostalgic, shortlived break.  It's easy to get through all 12 of these episodes (excluding the pilot), and magic is always alluring to kids of all ages.  Guess that's what really counts.",1306713600,,1650,4.898916967509026
2274697,4,B0009B16TY,"I was only 9 when this originally aired, but I remember liking it, so I wondered how it would hold up.  I was pleasantly suprised to find ""Tabitha"" is really quite enjoyable.  ""Bewitched"" has been put on such a lofty perch over the years (and deservedly so), that any spin-off would have a lot to live up to.  The show is clearly inspired by its predecessor, and I had no problem accepting Lisa Hartman as the daughter of Elizabeth Montgomery's character.  Yes, the producers did re-write history by making Adam the older, mortal brother of Tabitha.  But the Bewitched formula is still in place: Adam tries to keep his witchy sis from doing magic, but of course she does it quite often.

Sony has done a fine job of restoring the show, better than one might expect from a decidely minor 30+ year old show that only lasted 12 episodes.  Tabitha will probably never be more than a footnote to a beloved classic sitcom, but it's worth picking up (and at a bargain price as of this writing) if you like Bewitched.",1305849600,2,1009,4.510989010989011

2274699,2,B0009B16TY,"It doesn't share the same feelings like Bewitched even though they tried. I think the issue is they tried to mimic Bewitched too hard and yet they couldn't capture the original magic. As what their title song sung, ""it could be magic!"" Lisa Hartman was too ""trying"" hard to act exactly like Elizabeth Montgomery instead of building her own personality. By doing that, it made the character worst. They could make it a better series if they built on Bewitched but gave the characters different personalities.",1291939200,,507,4.906976744186046
2274700,5,B0009B16TY,"After watching the show one more time its cute and even Lisa Hartman is a little skinny she has a beautiful face and eyes. Could pass off as the Daughter of Samantha Stephens even to the hair sometimes. Great guest stars from the orignal the Kravitz's make an apperance as well as two by Dr. Bombay and even the regular Drunk Dick Wilson still could not make this series a hit. The big mistake is not being true to the original show and making Adam a Warlock like in the original series. Adams powers were revealed in only one episode of the entire run of Bewitched 251 episodes.(Adam warlock or washout).Also shown out of order the episode The Plague and Maurice and Samantha another episode where she looses her powers where Maurice comments on how Adams Witchcraft is progressing. Obviously the actor was not as gifted as Erin and Diane Murphy were at the same age to perform the necessary magic scenes that the twins performed with ease. Half the time he walks out of frame like he is about to fall over and so many times his voice is dubbed cause he was a lousy kid actor. But he was very cute and his role was not very demanding as Erin's. Back to Tabitha enjoy whats there its still fun mindless fluff for a few hours its a shame it did not last longer, however if it had catched on would Urich have been available to do Vegas Swat and Soap?",1285891200,,1348,4.353174603174603
2274701,3,B0009B16TY,"It was a nice idea, but the execution just wasn't ""there"".  On paper, a ""Bewitched"" spin-off centering on a now grown-up Tabitha probably sounded like a surefire hit, but TABITHA only ran for twelve episodes (plus the initial Pilot).

In a ""Mary Tyler Moore""-type situation, Tabitha (Lisa Hartman) works as a production assistant at Los Angeles news station KXLA.  Older brother Adam (David Ankrum) is on-hand to keep an eye on his little sister, more pointedly to make sure that she cuts down on her ""nose action"".  Stirring the magical pot of toil and trouble is Tabitha's Aunt Minerva (Karen Morrow), whilst Tabitha deals with preening, air-headed news anchor Paul Thurston (Robert Urich) and producer Marvin Decker (Mel Stewart).

The positives: Star Lisa Hartman is an absolute delight, and in her poise and mannerisms does evoke a genuine Elizabeth Montgomery vibe.  The casting of Broadway belter Karen Morrow as Tabitha's wisecracking Aunt Minerva serves the scripts well.  TABITHA also boasts welcome cameos from ""Bewitched"" favourites  Doctor Bombay (Bernard Fox) and the Kravitzes (George Tobias and Sandra Gould).

The negatives: The series doesn't follow the ""logic"" of the original ""Bewitched"" (for whatever logic the show had in the first place!).  On TABITHA, Adam is Tabitha's older brother, but on ""Bewitched"" he was a couple of years younger.  Also, Adam is written to not have inherited any of his mother's magical powers, whereas on ""Bewitched"" it was finally proven that he did possess some magic of his own.  Furthermore, the ""timeline"" for the show is completely off - Tabitha and Adam wouldn't have been old enough for jobs, seeing as ""Bewitched"" had only ended five years earlier!

This double DVD set includes all twelve episodes from TABITHA plus the original Pilot (starring Liberty Williams and Bruce Kimmel as Tabitha and Adam).  It's a show that will probably only ever appeal to the ""Bewitched"" fans, but it's a pleasant distraction nevertheless.

Episodes:

""Tabitha"" (Pilot) - Angered that Paul has replaced a fuel conservation expert with a beauty contestant on his show, Tabitha uses magic to make the egotistical host see the error of his ways.

""Tabitha's Weighty Problem"" - Having caught a cold, Tabitha's sneezing, twitchy nose casts an unwelcome series of spells during an international weight-lifting competition.

""Halloween Show"" - Infuriated over an interview where Paul mocks witchcraft, Cassandra (Mary Wickes), an all-powerful sorceress, sends a mischievous 8-year-old ""hit-witch"" to exact her revenge.

""A Star is Born"" - Tabitha becomes an overnight sensation as KXLA's newest weather girl, thanks to her uncanny forecasting ability (and Aunt Minerva's magic).

""Minerva Goes Straight"" - Disappointed with her lovelife, Aunt Minerva gives up witchcraft for normalcy and promptly falls under the spell of a philandering ski instructor.  This could very well have been a storyline for Cousin Serena on the original ""Bewitched"".

""Mr. Nice Guy"" - Aunt Minerva's plan to make Paul more appealing backfires, when her ""Niceness Spell"" induces the conceited star to give away all of his worldly goods and embark to China to become a missionary.

""The Arrival of Nancy"" - When childhood friend Nancy Kravitz pays Tabitha an unexpected visit, chaos - and Aunt Gladys - soon follows.

""Tabitha's Triangle"" - When Paul and State Senatorial candidate Ted Bingham both express an interest in Tabitha, Aunt Minerva puts them under a truth spell to determine their true intentions.

""That New Black Magic"" - Tabitha's old highschool nemesis - a beautiful, troublemaking young witch - decides to cast her seductive spells on happily-married producer Marvin Decker.

""What's Wrong with Mr. Right?"" - Aunt Minerva's attempt to play matchmaker backfires when she sets Tabitha up with Monty The Magnificent, a jealous warlock who wreaks havoc with Tabitha's new boyfriend.

""Paul Goes to New York"" - When Paul quits to move to the East Coast, he's replaced by Renee Cummings, the ""Mistress of the Knife"", a vicious, two-faced host who is loathed by guests and crew alike.

""Tabitha's Party"" - Deciding to allow only one witch-and-mortal marriage per year, the Witches' Council selects Tabitha and Paul as unlikely test subjects for their new policy.",1285113600,5,4280,5.254411764705883
2274702,1,B0009B16TY,"The videos were of good quality so there's no issue with that.

But the storyline was horrible. The timeline was too soon for Tabitha to be grown up. While Lisa Hartman was credible as Tabitha,  everyone else was boring. Robert Urich has no comic ability but was nice to look at. Also Adam refers to Tabitha as his kid sister? He also lacks powers. OK fine the story changes.

The real problem was the lack of purpose. There was no reason for Tabitha NOT to want to use her magic. Samantha had a reason to not use it. She married Darrin who thought she was a mortal. The whole point of ""Betwitched"" that made it so charming is that Samantha COULD have anything, but chose Darrin and the hum-drum suburban life. Why? Because LOVE is better than having the world at your fingertips or in Samantha's case a twitch.

Without that reason, there was no reason for Tabitha not to want to use her powers and no charm. Also the special effects were poor. They were even worse at times than the original show.",1282089600,4,999,4.413043478260869
2274703,3,B0009B16TY,"This show was fine, but I want to set the record straight.  Adam Stevens does have powers as was shown in the original unaired pilot of the Tabitha show.  In season 8 Episode 14, ""Adam, Warlock or Washout?"", Adam proves that he has his own powers.  Shortly after Maurice removes his spell from the shell that has fooled everyone into thinking that Adam was able to use witchcraft on his own, Adam is tested. Samantha levitates the once enchanted shell two times to show Adam how to do it.  Once it's Adam's turn to try, he is able to levitate the shell to himself and proves once and for all that he has powers like his sister, mother and grandparents.

After everyone but his parents leaves the living room, he provides more evidence.  Using his powers, he materializes his own glass of milk.  His mother then sends him into the kitchen.  As Darrin tries to kiss Samantha, she pops out of sight and Darrin isn't sure where she'd gone.  Next Samantha emerges from the kitchen with Adam and Samantha states that Adam teleported her into the kitchen and that she did not do so herself.  I am an avid fan of this show and have loved it for my entire 30 years of life.  I just wish that when shows like this are done that the original show's continuity is maintained and that other people who claim to be fans get their facts straight.  Adam and Tabitha both have powers of witchcraft, not just Tabitha. Diehard fans know this!!!!!!!!!!!!",1280448000,,1434,4.494208494208494

This was a nice series about Samantha and Darin Stephens little girl all grown up and out on her own, working for a low-rent local television station in this enchanting spin-off series. Starring Lisa Hartman (it would have been nice if they could have had the orginial person Erin Murphy who played tabitha to do this series , but Lisa Hartman did do a good job with the part and she does look a little like the orginial star)as Tabitha adds a little magic and fun to the lives of her relatives and friends including mortal brother Adam (David Ankrum) , The unaired pilot made him a warlock, on the orginial series it was made for you to believe he might be a warlock, the unaired pilot is included with this set, but it has a different Tabitha and Adam , guardian witch Aunt Minerva (Karen Morrow) (I think they should have one of the great aunt's from the show , they never showed Samantha had any sisters only a cousin Serena played by Elizabeth Montgomery ) and Paul Thurston (Mel Stewart) . This set includes the entire 12-episode run plus the rarely seen original pilot episode starring Liberty Williams and Bruce Kimmel as the Stephens siblings. Reprising their roles from the original series are Sandra Gould and a bearded George Tobias as Gladys and Abner Kravitz in ""The Arrival of Nancy,"" and Bernard Fox as Dr. Bombay in ""Tabitha's Party . "" So if you collect the Bewitched series this is still a great addition to your collection.

2274705,5,B0009B16TY,I enjoyed the series when it was out so I bought it for my collection of TV shows of my youth.  Good memories!!!,1276214400,,112,3.869565217391304
2274706,4,B0009B16TY,"I enjoyed this for what it really is.  This a 70's type version of Tabitha, Samantha's daughter in Bewitched. Tabitha is totally hot.
The story lines are kind of schlocky, and a more updated version
of the original. Tabitha's aunt is interfering, but much nicer
than the original Endora (Samantha's mother). Adam, Tabitha's brother is dorkish, but a predicatably over protective mortal without any warlock powers. It's a fun DVD as long as viewers don't take it too seriously.
It's 70's TV.",1231459200,,490,4.975609756097561
2274707,4,B0009B16TY,"Lisa had her nose done after this series; she is more beautiful now at age 50 than she ever was then. I had her on my flight (I am a Flight Attendant), and she looks twenty years younger than she is.",1175817600,2,199,3.8780487804878048
2274708,4,B0009B16TY,"I remember watching the show when it was on in the 70's and I do remember how disappointed I was when it was quickly cancelled. I thought it was a cute funny show, but it was just never given a chance, much like the networks do to shows these days (i.e. Book of Daniel, DAYBREAK)  I think if the network had given it a chance and had more Bewitched stars ""visit"", the show may have gotten better. I was so happy when Lisa Hartman moved to the cul-de-sac community of KNOTS LANDING in 1983 though--I love Lisa Hartman-Black. I think she got major talent in singing and acting and loved her as Singer Ciji Dunne and doppelganger Cathy Geary.",1168646400,,639,4.369747899159663
2274709,5,B0009B16TY,"Lisa Hartman has what it takes to to do whatever she darn pleases!  I love Lisa and have all her albums (too few in my opinion!)  She is an excellent singer and it's a darn shame that she doesn't record anymore.

As for her acting, she's a darn good actress too!  But, you have to take TABITHA for what it's worth - pure entertainment.  When I've had a rotten day, I like to put my feet up, with my cat on my lap, and watch this.

Try it, it must be magic, it works!",1165536000,7,466,3.904255319148936
2274710,4,B0009B16TY,"Concededly there was a lot of room for improvement, unfortunately ABC never gave the show a chance to develop further. For a 1970s show, it was par for the course. Lisa Hartman definitely had what it took to carry her own show. And she and the actor who played Adam resembled their TV parents enough to make it seem plausible. ""Tabitha"" is charming in its own way. And yes, the guest appearances of original characters like the Kravitzes and Dr. Bombay were welcome delights (only wish Ms. Montgomery and Uncle Arthur showed up too). The original pilot included on this DVD is just a dull re-telling of the original Bewitched pilot. Too bad this show wasn't given the opportunity to turn into what could've been another classic.",1144972800,15,728,4.74015748031496
2274711,4,B0009B16TY,"After all the negitive reviews, I was very skeptical to buy this. But I said WTH why not! I must say I really enjoyed it. I absoulutly adore Lisa Hartman as Tabitha. She does a very good job. I found it humorous and enjoyful. I guess everyone has thier own opions. Its a real shame that it didn't last longer. it would have been really nice to have more episodes to enjoy, IMO!

Now, a lot of people have been saying how better of the series would have benn if it followed the unaired pilot. I have to disagree. I found the alternate pilot kinda boring. I liked Ms. Williams as Tabatha, but the thing I didn't like, in this pilot and the one that aired, is adam. In the unaired pilot I found him annoying and in the series I found him even more annoying LOL. Although I do think the series would have been more interesting had Adam been a warlock, JMO.

I hope this review helps you out!",1139184000,9,887,4.181286549707602
2274712,5,B0009B16TY,"I was absolutely in love with this show for the short time ABC aired it back in the late 70s and had the sense to ignore the negative reviews here when I ordered it last week.  Verdict:  I'm still guilty of loving the very young Lisa Hartman as Tabitha Stevens.

Now, true, there is a thin resemblance to Mary Tyler Moore, but there is enough Bewitched to make a die-hard fan like myself smile in total approval.  Lisa Hartman wears her hair, wears clothes similar to, and acts enough like Elizabeth Montgomery to pass herself off as Samantha Stevens' magical daughter, while David Ankrum plays mortal brother Adam, who happens to be a chip of the old ""Derwood"" block.  The late Robert Urich as egomaniacal Ted Baxteresque on/off love interest Paul serves to work up some notable sparks, and Karen Morrow as Aunt Minerva is so bewitching all by herself that she often steals the show away from the rest of the cast just by showing up for as little as 2 minutes in a given episode.  Of special note, check out the original pilot with Liberty Williams and Bruce Kimmel to see how much better I think the show might have gone had Adam been kept a warlock.",1135814400,11,1152,4.488038277511961
2274713,3,B0009B16TY,"I REALLY, REALLY wanted to love this show - in 1977 and in 2005. When I was 13, the pilot premiered on ABC as a ""Special"" in the Spring of '77.  It then moved to a regular weekly slot in the fall of '77. I watched it sporadically, and what bothered me then - still bothers me now. Lisa Hartman is indeed a delightful presence, and is totally believable as Elizabeth Montgomery's ""daughter"". But the show was inconsistent with the BEWITCHED backstory (Her brother Adam is powerless, while on BEWITCHED he did indeed possess his mom's gifts), Aunt Minerva (Karen Morrow)seems intent on getting Tabitha into morally questionable situations and there was a disturbing ""occult"" overtone in some episodes (which I didn't feel was present on BEWITCHED). There were a few enjoyable episodes, though, and the ""guest spots"" from original BEWITCHED cast members (the Kravitzes, Dr. Bombay) are fun. Maybe I was hoping for a duplication of the joy I felt / still feel from the first show. As far as the dvd itself is concerned, the picture quality and sound are EXCELLENT, and the bonus feature - the first (and in my opinion, superior) TABITHA pilot from 1976 is included (with a totally different cast).",1130025600,10,1193,4.79126213592233
2274714,3,B0009B16TY,"This spinoff series to Bewitched, one of the greatest sitcoms of all times, tries very hard to capture the magic of the original but just misses. It's cute in it's own way and fun to hear the soundeffects from the original series reused as well as some of the characters such as Dr. Bombay (played again by Bernard Fox) and the Kravitzes (played again by Sandra Gould and George Tobias). And who can deny how cute Lisa Hartman as Tabitha is.

The problem though is that the characters don't seem to be fleshed out until the last couple episodes but by then it was too late. And the fact that this show started in 1977 only five years after Bewitched ended makes you wonder how Tabitha grew up so fast.

The video and sound on this DVD release is awesome! Crystal clear and vibrant!

If you're looking for some light fun you should check this out.",1124928000,31,846,4.410256410256411
2274715,3,B0009B16TY,"After reading the reviews, I was a bit hesitant, so I rented it instead. I will say the show is a bit on the bad side, but it does has a good side too. I really like the more youthful look of the 70s that the show has like the bubble gum lamp in her apartment or her VW bug she drives. And the cameos from some Bewitched stars like Dr. Bombay do may a nice little trip back to the 70s. So if you just want to watch something for a night that you have nothing to do watch this!!!!",1123977600,5,479,3.7524752475247523
2274716,4,B0009B16TY,"I remember watching Tabitha on TV in the 70's when I was a kid and liking it and being very disappointed when it was cancelled. Sure it was a piece of fluff but it was an entertaining piece of fluff. Okay it has some weird plot points that don't make sense like for example Tabitha has been aged to  be in her 20's and it appears that Adam is older than her when he was actually her younger brother. I'm not sure how old exactly Tabitha really should be. The twin actresses who played her in Bewitched, Erin and Dianne Murphy were born in 1964 and that was the year the show began on TV and Tabitha was born sometime in the 1965-1966 season so logically that would make Tabitha only about 11 or 12 years old in 1977 when Tabitha aired on TV but they aged the character but the show is still good anyway and we can always pretend that a spell by bumbling aunt Clara had backfired and it made Tabitha and Adam older and the spell couldn't be reversed.",1123027200,5,949,4.185792349726776
2274717,3,B0009B16TY,"A fair remake, borrowing elements from the Bewitched series.  Would have been better if Elizabeth Montgomery was involved in the series.",1122854400,4,136,5.476190476190476
2274718,4,B0009B16TY,"This show pales in comparison to the original Bewitched series.  But what it does well is capture a snapshot of life in the 1970s and the camp of the later seasons of Bewitched. Sure, Adam takes on the hum-drum mortal role of Darrin, which isn't true to the original, but I think it works...in it's own magical way.  The series is chalked full of Bewitched guest stars and regulars, and fans will learn what Dr. Bombay's first name was and if he does, in fact, enter into a ""mixed"" marriage of his own.  While Lisa Hartman is adoreable (pre-nose job and all) and Karen Morrow as Aunt Minerva has the flair of Mrs. Roeper more than Endora, I think that Robert Urich bewitches me the most.  This DVD is also worth the price just for the rarely seen bonus pilot starring Liberty Williams.  My DVD has a ticking noise in the audio of this episode, but others have said that theirs don't, so I may have received a dud.  It's not enough to return the DVD since it is only one episode.  Overall, fans of Bewitched who grew up in the 1970s or always wondered if Tabitha grew up to be the next Mary Tyler Moore will enjoy this complete series set.",1121990400,6,1138,4.339622641509434
2274719,4,B0009B16TY,"First off, let me say that I am a die-hard Bewitched fan. Always have been, always will be. But I remember being dissapointed, as an 11 year old, that Elizabeth Montgomery wasn't going to be on ""Tabitha"". I remember liking the series, but not being enthralled with it as I was it's originator.  However as an adult, I can now watch the show and enjoy it for what it was...a charming escape.  I wish it had been given a chance is a solid timeslot and allowed to grow on it's own.  Maybe not enough time had passed from the original to it's spinoff.  I think that most people buying entertainment these days will like this.  It view's now like an ""homage"" to ""Bewitched"".  And yes, 1970's TV seems far racier now that when I was 11, but it still makes me smile.",1121731200,9,759,4.309859154929577
2274720,3,B0009B16TY,"Tabitha in itself was not a bad little tv show but as a spinoff it was a failure. The show centered on a grown up Tabitha at work in the big city and her occasional romantic life. The two Stephens siblings I thought were great and a tiny bit of the charm of the original were present however I had several problems with the show.

1. Robert Urichs character made way too unlikeable to be Tabithas love interest

2. No where even close to the same premise or scenario that made Bewitched a hit - Tabitha for the most part centered around the workplace. They should have gave Adam a family and featured a little more of him and in combo with a romance between Tabitha and a more likeable Urich from the start.

3.except for a brief appearance from Bombay and the Kravitz family no other characters from the original show appeared really

so Tabitha felt distanced from the original Bewitched and they

should of ditched the annoying aunt Minerva in favor of someone or something else.",1120608000,4,982,4.49438202247191

2274722,5,B0009B16TY,"Reading the other reviews here, I think there are a lot of people missing the point of this series. It's pure entertainment, plain and simple. It's not entirely fair to compare it to the original ""Bewitched"", although there's a temptation to do so. The casting of Lisa Hartman as Tabitha, and David Ankrum as Adam, works because she resembles Elizabeth Montgomery, and he Dick York, enough to make you believe Samantha and Darren could be their parents. Keeping Adam a mortal was the right way to go, since he was mortal on the original show. The unaired pilot made him a warlock, which would have detracted from the show if he had been portrayed that way. It would have been great if the parents had made a guest appearance (Sandra Gould and George Tobias reprising their roles as Gladys and Abner Kravitz was welcome). Robert Urich as an egotistical talk show host worked; he really looked the part. Karen Morrow was also terrific as Aunt Minerva, Tabitha's ""guardian witch"". Anyway, this is a cute show that deserves a look. Don't judge it entirely as a ""Bewitched"" spin-off. Take it on its own merit.",1120262400,34,1104,4.725388601036269
2274723,3,B0009B16TY,"I had only seen the Liberty Williams original pilot, which is included in this set.  That pilot's script seems to be heavily lifted from elements of the first two episodes of ""Bewitched,"" some of the dialogue quoted almost verbatim!

I will concur with other reviewers that ""Tabitha"" is no ""Bewitched"" and that Lisa Hartman is no Liz Montgomery.  However, let us be fair.  Lisa had some pretty big shoes to fill.  To her credit, the character she develops does seem as though she could indeed be the offspring of Sam and Darrin.  It is great to see the funny Sandra Gould as Mrs. Kravitz, George Tobias as Abner, and Bernard Fox as Dr. Bombay. Watch for some hilarious, catty banter between Minerva and Gladys in Episode 7, ""The Arrival of Nancy.""

As far as entertainment value, the show did have some very funny, catty, witty, and sarcastic moments.  I think everyone involved gave it their best shot.  However, it could have never lived up to the magic of its parent show ""Bewitched.""  The same people were involved in producing the show, but the same magic wasn't there.  I think we all missed Elizabeth Montgomery as Samantha too much to even give the show a chance, quite frankly.  After all, didn't we all really want the old ""Bewitched"" back and not a sequel?  I think the best episodes of ""Tabitha"" are nearly on par with the mediocre or average ""Bewitched"" shows of the later seasons.  (Please don't hex me me for saying that there were actually less-than-excellent  episodes of ""Bewitched!"")

Errors on the packaging:  In the liner notes, Adam is called Tabitha's mortal brother in the description for the original pilot.  Adam played a full-fledged warlock in that pilot!  Furthermore, the original pilot is called an ""unaired"" pilot on the DVD menu.  This is not the case.  That show did indeed hit the airwaves.

Trivia:  There are two major allusions to ""I Dream of Jeannie"" in the ""Tabitha"" series.  On episode 9, Portia, Tabitha's high school friend and witch, actually folds her arms and blinks to conjure up a red velvet coat.  On episode 12, Cassandra pours something from Jeannie's bottle into her cauldron!

It was somehow nice to hear many of the same sound effects from ""Bewitched;""  it gave a little extra to the continuity and familiarity with the old show.

In summary, a great show for nostalgiac purposes and a few giggles.  And for the carnal creatures within us all, neither Lisa Hartman or Robert Urich are exactly hard on the eyes, either.",1119744000,10,2472,4.764150943396227
2274724,2,B0009B16TY,"This is one of the shows that I have very vague memories of watching as a little kid. I was six when the show aired. The only thing I really remembered about it was that Lisa Hartman played Tabitha (which led me to believe for years that she also played Tabitha on ""Bewitched"" this is not the case). The other thing I remembered about this show was her driving a yellow VW. That's all I could recall of this show. So I rented the DVD set to refresh my memory. The show just isn't that good. It comes off as a very cheap attempt at redoing ""Bewitched"". On ""Bewitched"" you believed all the charaters were who they played, you got lost in their reality. That is not the case with this show. You watch the show and you ask yourself, why does Adam have such a problem with his sister doing her thing (witchcraft)? Why does their Aunt Minerva have such disdain for her own nephew? Where did Aunt Minerva come from since everything from the original show led you to believe that Samantha was an only child??? In short you really don't care about these people or what they are doing.

  The gimmick of the show was obviously the whole ""Bewitched"" tie in, however that is ALL it had going for it, and even that wasn't done very well. The overall plot of Tabitha working at a TV station isn't all that interesting. Lisa Hartman and Robert Urich do a good job though, it's just the material they had to work with wasn't that great.

 I suppose if you're a huge fan of ""Bewitched"" or Lisa Hartman (who is still incredibly cute today!) you will pick this up regardless, if you're just a casual fan, you'll do better to skip this altogether, you're not missing anything.",1119657600,35,1656,4.381107491856677

I am glad that I did, because I am extremely impressed with this release.  If you watched the recent airings on TV Land, you'll remember the murky, faded picture quality that almost all of the episodes exhibited.  Well, surprisingly Sony has outdone themselves with this release.  The episodes look incredible!  Sharp, crisp picture quality, with bright, vibrant colors.  It looks truly incredible compared to what was shown on TV!  Plus, it includes the rarely seen pilot episode with a different cast and location.  All of this on 2 single sided discs housed in a standard size DVD ""flipper"" amaray.  I wish that all studios would take notice of the excellent transfer used for this set, and apply it to other TV shows that are released on DVD.",1119052800,46,918,4.576687116564417

Maybe it's Lisa Hartman driving a VW Beetle.  Maybe it's the ordinarily likable and charismatic Robert Urich displaying the comedic timing of a rock.  Maybe it's the fact that it led me to seek out Bewitched reruns.

Does anyone know if Lisa Hartman still uses her finger to twitch her nose like the baby Tabitha did? *Ding ding ding ding ding*",1116547200,9,238,4.173913043478261

8058904,2,B0009B16TY,"As a die-hard Bewitched fan, I was excited to see this spin-off, and had high hopes that I'd be equally obsessed.  I wanted it to work, but it just didn't.  Bewitched was all about the lively characters with big personalities, and Tabitha was sorely lacking in this arena.  In any event, if you're as big a fan of Bewitched as I, it's of course worth a watch just because! :)",1512777600,,375,4.328571428571428
8058905,5,B0009B16TY,"Okay...so I just bought this but haven't watched it...but I remember watching  when it was on in the 70s and being the die-hard Bewitched fan, even my ring tone and texts are sometimes the Bewitched them or nose twitching sound, I'm super excited to own this.  I love old tv shows so I know I'll love this...just like I love The Girl with Something Extra with Sally Field and John Davidson.  I was looking for DVDs of it long before it showed up on TV Land.",1495065600,,457,4.290697674418604

Run, pretend you never heard of this.

You've been warned.",1491782400,,234,4.682926829268292
8058907,1,B0009B16TY,"The DVD came very quickly, no complaints about that. I had vaquely remembered the series so I was curious and I ordered it. I watched a few episodes but, found it kind of boring. There wasn't much magic in it and I was upset from the very first episode because they made Adam older then tabitha and anyone who watched bewitched knows that tabitha was older by a few years. I doubt I can bring myself to finish all the tv series as t just didn't hold my attention",1470268800,,462,4.202247191011236

Look on Google about backstage views of behind the squares. It shows cheap lightbulbs lighting up the square. Lisa Hartman wasn't the original Tabitha.",1460937600,,320,4.836363636363636
