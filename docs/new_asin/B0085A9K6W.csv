5132511,4,B0085A9K6W,I remember watching this show as a kid and I really liked it. Most people diss the show without even having watched it. It's educational and moralistic. People compare this show to Sealab 2021 and say they hate it. Stop comparing and you'll realize this is very likeable series. Highly recommended!,1347062400,8,298,4.862745098039215

5132513,3,B0085A9K6W,I... thought I was buying Sealab 2021. I was amazed to see it at such a low price! My own fault. The show itself isn't bad but shame on me for not reading better. The delivery came really promptly and well packaged (even though I had to return it),1435795200,,247,4.061224489795919

5132515,5,B0085A9K6W,"This colorful undersea show is pro-environment, with people of different ages, races and yes, even handicaps working together to solve problems -- sometimes, urgent ones.  I didn't appreciate Sealab 2020 as much in 1972, but as an adult, I'm not too proud to learn a few things along with my entertainment.  2020 seemed like a long time in the future back then.",1428105600,3,361,4.806451612903226
5132516,4,B0085A9K6W,"Underrated cartoon from prolific animation giant Hanna-Barbera that was initially broadcasted in the early 1970s but now virtually unknown except as inspiration for Cartoon Network's very funny parody Sealab 2021. Yes, this 13-episode series takes things a little too seriously, the environmental message a little too earnest, and some stories are a trifle slow-moving for (IMHO) modern tastes, but there are some nostalgic pleasures to be had. Standout episodes include 'Green Fever' and 'Collision of the Aquarius', ending on a strong note with 'The Arctic Story'. This DVD is barebones but the episodes are bright, colourful and relatively clean, with clear sound overall.",1427241600,6,675,5.563106796116505

5132521,4,B0085A9K6W,"I loved the show as a kid all - even despite its preaching about the environment (which at least was understated and realistic compared to the infinitely more heavy-handed Captain Planet). My only problem is that this collection is misnamed as the complete series. While it's true that it includes every episode that was actually ever aired, there were three other episodes made as well that were never broadcast for some reason. It would have been nice to have seen those as well, as I was expecting from something billed as the *complete* series.",1372896000,7,548,4.840425531914893

8525356,5,B0085A9K6W,"The year before Hanna-Barbera's hour-long ""Superfriends"" series premiered with its environmentally-threatening bad guys...or misguided scientists whose methods of saving the environment ends up causing more harm than good, ""Sealab 2020"" presented stories of underwater environmental threats in half hour form.  Captain Mike Murphy (John Stephenson) and his grandkids Sally (Pamelyn Ferdin) and  Bobby (Josh Albee) were ""outsiders"" to the Sealab colony...rescued from a shipwreck by the Sealab team and remaining as guests and explorers.  Murphy sometimes clashed with the Sealab head Dr. Paul Williams (Ross Martin) on ways to handle certain emergencies or dealing with potential threats or scientific discoveries but they managed to work together to save the day.  Sally and Bobby may tag along with divers Hal (Jerry Dexter), Gail (Ann Jillian) ,and Ed (Ron Pinkard who played Dr. Morton on ""Emergency"") to explore their ocean environment.  The Sealab crew faced threats from natural disasters, hostile sea life, and bad guys from below and above the surface.

Talky at times but the stories did present environmental concerns in an entertaining fashion.  ""Star Trek"" and  ""Space 1999"" writer Fred Freiberger was a story writer for the ""Sealab 2020"" series.",1484265600,,1259,5.589473684210526

Good quality, Good packaging.",1466467200,2,71,6.2
8525358,3,B0085A9K6W,"Saw this show back in the 70's, caught it in re-runs during the summer after the series first aired.  Saw maybe 3 or 4 episodes and then September came along, and with it a whole slew of new cartoons.  Sealab 2020 wasn't amongst them.  It was fully about 20+ years later that I ever saw anything substantial about the show, and that was in print, being model sheets drawn by Alex Toth.  Truth be told, I bought this set because of Alex Toth and his work.
Keep one thing in mind: this is NOT the ""Sealab 2021"" parody series.

The show is dated, the DVD shows the art and animation more clearly than ever before, and probably moreso than ever intended.
You can tell the background are painted on card-stock, and the animation is clearly painted onto cels. Okay......that is how cartoons were done then. The stories are a touch preachy, but the episodes I have watched tried to be more entertaining than educational. The stuff is still aimed at kids.  The ""Toth"" influence is there.....a bit........but most of the sophistication implied in his designs and storyboards is largely lost in the crude limited TV animation. You can see what they were trying for........but the studio/network politics of the day didn't seem to grant the leeway to allow the series to get to what it was intended to be.
This is a nostalgic novelty, probably even an acquired taste. It's not as entertaining or as thrilling as other Hanna Barbera action adventure series, but nevertheless has its place in their pantheon.",1461283200,3,1495,4.708812260536399

8525360,4,B0085A9K6W,No Adult Swim here! A before its time series about what it really means to be aware of our resources - a good choice for re-release,1452038400,,131,4.076923076923077
8525361,4,B0085A9K6W,Quality spin off of Johnny Quest.  Characters have different names but are obviously based on JQ. It's similar to the way Scooby Doo and Josie and Pussycats were similar.  Good stories with a 70s environmental feel. and less action than Johnny Quest due to the 70s anti-violence in cartoons movement. Fun show but plays it straight unlike Sealab 2021 (parody show),1449619200,,364,4.950819672131147
