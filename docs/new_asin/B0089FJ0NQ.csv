8526344,5,B0089FJ0NQ,"It may be a surprise, considering this came out of China's Cultural Revolution, but this ballet is definitely worthy of some respect. The music, choreography and dancing talent are as good as most European ballet companies of the era. The story, based on actual events, is also excellent for a ballet treatment. Much of the choreography and mime is influenced by other Chinese traditional arts, such as Chinese Opera and martial arts, so that is why some of the movements seem a bit strange, but if you allow for these cultural differences, they should not seem out of place.
The story basically is as follows: We begin with a young peasant girl(Wu Qinghua;played by Xue Jinghua) held in chains as a slave of a evil, greedy landlord. She manages to escape and meets a group of young female revolutionaries led by a young man(Hong Changqing;played by Qingtang Liu) and decides it would be to her advantage to join them. But her motive at this point is not political, but to seek revenge on the landlord who enslaved her. She eventually manages to shoot him, but only wounding him and he escapes. The Red Detachment is disappointed in her action and she eventually realizes her error and decides to join the Red Detachment as a loyal member.
One may wonder how a ballet that is so much a product of Western culture managed to be so popular during the Cultural Revolution, whose main purpose was to purge the Chinese society of all Western cultural and political influences. The answer lies with Madame Mao(Jiang Qing) who was trained in Western style cultural arts! Her husband knew enough to let her have her way. But she made sure that these art forms were used for furthering the Chinese political causes.
Xue Jinghua was promoted to Prima Ballerina as a result of her performance in this ballet.
The sound, color, and image of this DVD are very good, typical of movies of that era. The aspect ratio is bit complicated. Normally, movies from this era have the 4:3 aspect ratio, and this is no exception. You will view it in 4:3. But most of the time, you have the option on modern equipment to stretch it(with distortion) to 16:9, but you can't do that with this! Technically, this DVD is already in 16:9 but within the frame, it presents the ballet in 4:3. I have never seen that before. If that makes no sense to you, don't worry about it. You will see it in 4:3, period.
There is also a movie of a dramatic version of this same story by the same name. Do not confuse the dramatic movie version with this balletic version. If you would like to investigate the dramatic version, it, too, is available for Amazon.com. For further research into this era of Chinese ballet take a look at the DVD, ""Yang Ban Xi"", also available from Amazon.com. It contains interviews with artists from the era.
All in all, this is an excellent, well produced in every respect, ballet that should not be missed!",1344643200,2,2892,4.628404669260701
8526345,3,B0089FJ0NQ,"When a product like this pops up on Amazon, I'm sure there must be others who share my curiosity and doubts about ordering it. Is it going to be a take in: dodgy copyright, poor grade and barely watchable? Well, I was intrigued enough to fork out for the first part of this two DVD set. After all, 'The Red Detachment of Women' is one of those ballets you read about in dance histories and old books on Soviet-era ballet.

The verdict? Hmm, yes, it's definitely an amateur job in terms of quality and presentation. The film itself is a proper, professionally-made movie from 1970, but it's a bit blurry, poorly transferred to DVD, and some of the scenes are so dark I'll have to adjust my TV settings to see anything. The disc also came in one of those awful cheap DVD cases that stink when you open them. However, I'm actually pleasantly surprised by the movie (especially its sunnier scenes). If, like me, you have an interest in ballet's history and in narrative dance, then it's worth a look as a historical document. It's kind of what you expect of Cultural Revolution art - lots of gritty, determined expressions; plenty of strong, air-cutting gestures and staged violence to make sure everyone knows who the baddies are. But the dancing is good - there's no doubting the heroine's ability to throw herself into six o'clock penchees and the corps move with the perfect unison we've come to associate with ballet in general and Chinese military spectacle in particular. The acting and pantomime is not exactly subtle, but then that's all part of the style.

So if you're interested in cultural history - and especially in ballet's cultural history - then you won't be totally throwing away your money on this purchase. It's just a pity the film hasn't been picked up by a company like Kultur or Arthaus, who might have released the whole recording on a single DVD with a synopsis, cast list, professional-looking top menu and features, contextual notes, etc. You'll need to be able to read Mandarin(?) to follow what is, presumably, the description of the action contained in the film itself.

I do resent having to buy two DVDs for a film that I'm sure would fit on one (the picture, after all, is only 4:3 ratio and Part 1 goes for barely an hour). And I'm yet to track down an outline of the story, although there'll be one around somewhere.

Certainly don't bother with 'The Red Detachment of Women' if you're anything less than a hardcore balletomane. But if you love all aspects of dance history and are curious to see ballet bent to the most overt of political ends, then be reassured to give this unusual film a try.",1344470400,2,2629,4.623126338329764
