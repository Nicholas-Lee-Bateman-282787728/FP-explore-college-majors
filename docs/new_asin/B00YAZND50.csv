7209358,5,B00YAZND50,Is this a 5 star Hollywood film? No it is not. However it is 5 stars in its genre! This is a great Grind-house style Indie Horror Anthology! If you are like me and LOVE low budget indie horror then this film is for you!,1436400000,4,219,3.888888888888889

7209360,5,B00YAZND50,Great horror anthology. It even has an intro. by Lloyd Kaufman (Troma).,1433462400,3,71,5.0
7209361,4,B00YAZND50,"There is a cool intro featuring indie SOV icon, Lloyd Kaufman, which is carried into the beginning narrative set-up by Dr. Fry. The story we are giving is a bit over complicating to the host segment, not in complexity as much as it is unnecessary. The horror hosts are engaging, the back-n-forth is amusing and the atmosphere is set. All the extra info and back story stuff just bogs down the piece. The segment does hold the anthology together and leads us comfortably into each of the twisted tales. I love horror hosted series and it is nice to see Fry back on the scene.

""Sledgehammer"" has a fun ending with a masked killer, more gore and a bit of dark humor.  ""Cannibal Pen Pals"" is set in the 90's and is a twisted love letter to Dahmer. "" April's Fool Party"" is a fun, totally wrong short filled with geeked-up dope fiends. ""Septic Shock"" follows up ""April Fool's Party"" and tests the gag reflex. ""Deadly Indie Drive-in"" is a fun, entertaining twisted tale that I enjoyed.

Overall ""Scream Machine"" is by far the best of Walter Ruether, and gives good SOV . The jewel of the anthology is of course the horror host segments that hold the series together. Fun, entertaining moments that take me back to the early days of horror hosts. I never got the connection between the anthology's title and the hosting set-up but I like the title, I like the theme song so I am cool with that. The stand out shorts for me personally are ""Septic Shock""and "" Deadly Indie Drive- in"".",1432944000,4,1476,4.5
7209362,5,B00YAZND50,"Disturbing tales with plenty of gore, humor, guts... and brains. Old-school horror anthologies are still fun.  Perfect for short attention spans, and just chillin' with the flat-screen.  Goes great with nachos...",1432857600,3,212,5.806451612903226

7209376,1,B00YAZND50,"I am sorry to say that I bought this movie. It has been a long time since I have been this disappointed. If you want to see outrageous adult comedy, check out The Brothers Grimsby. A Scream Machine, in my opinion, reflects a faint and simple imagination with a lot of vulgarity thrown in to shock, I guess? To be totally upfront, we only made it part way through the third story, and we were not high or otherwise mentally impaired. This might be a good stoner movie, but that is unfair to stoners.",1466208000,6,498,4.308510638297872

7209381,5,B00YAZND50,"I had not watched a horror film in years prior to watching Scream Machine. The format is similar to Creepshow and Tales from the Crypt, that is it's a few short stories. I enjoyed the cautionary tales each one with its own moral lesson. I will keep an eye out for more films of Scarlet Fry.",1441929600,4,290,4.196428571428571
7209382,4,B00YAZND50,"It's almost a knee jerk reaction to rag on low budget films but I have to give these guys their due.  Despite a clearly low budget, they squeezed every ounce of imagination out of these five stories.  From the cheesy and humorously hostile, Son of Svengoolie style, hosting segment to the dark psychological terror of Septic Shock.  Each segment is unique, energetic, and imaginative.  Haters will find a reason to hate but all told id rather filmmakers take a chance on something creative and different, that people might not immediately warm up to, than do the same old same old that audiences may not ""hate"" but they'll never respect.  Three cheers for creativity. Go check out Scream Machine.",1437004800,5,696,4.864406779661017
7209383,4,B00YAZND50,"This was a throwback to those really fun SOV gory films I remember from the 80's When I use to go the the video store, if i brought home something like Scream Machine It was always a Hoot & a great gory good time, I'd recommend this movie to any horror fan who likes Gory fun movies, there is nothing to get bored about here, this movie is an anthology each story has a bloody pay off and leaves you anxiously waiting for the next story, Great job guys.",1436486400,,453,4.101123595505618

8717903,1,B00YAZND50,"This is similar to Scarlet Fry's other work. The anthology was 5 poorly acted, poorly scripted low budget stories with cheap gore effects. The sound quality was bad too. The low spot of the feature was a MM necrophilia scene with two chubbies. 5 tales in 68 minutes.

Lloyd Kaufman introduces the film without Debbie Rochon.

8717904,4,B00YAZND50,"I understand the negative comments, but if you like stupid silly movies that are brainless, gore-filled, and fun, then I say check this movie out. I like all sorts of films, but I've always had a soft spot for indie horror. When you laugh while watching a movie like this, you are laughing with the director and cast. This movie is supposed to be stupid fun. It's stupid. It's fun. If you have higher standards than that, then you are probably great fun at parties. All seriousness, fun movie, micro budget, dumb as hell, but a lot of fun.",1494460800,,539,4.454545454545454

8717907,1,B00YAZND50,"I'm not gonna rag on the effects or music because indy cinema is what it is and you expect that going in.

Bad casting, characters without character, stories that lack cohesion, first short looks like it was filmed with an early 90's webcam, awful pacing, awful camera work, awful editing, awful sound...looks like the first week of film class...in high school.  But - by adults.  It's bad and they should feel bad.

No horror, no psychological tension, no...nothing.  Just apathy.",1485820800,,481,4.9625
