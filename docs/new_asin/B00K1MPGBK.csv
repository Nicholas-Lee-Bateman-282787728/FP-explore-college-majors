6398539,5,B00K1MPGBK,"Love Series 10. Nice mix of things and I feel like I've had a workout with each 25 minute session. My foot and ankle flexibility continues to improve as I consistently use the dvd. Classical Stretch is my go-to workout after a 12 hour workday.  The instruction for the series 10 DVD is just a bit clearer than series 9, which has helped me correct some cheating I didn't realize I was doing.",1402099200,151,391,4.3561643835616435

Because this has also affected my muscles and lungs, I find the stretches and cardio is just what I needed to build up my strength and lung capacity not to mention using every ounce of circulation I need to heal.

6398546,5,B00K1MPGBK,"Miranda Esmonde-White is a genius.  I have been working out with these tapes for 2 years and the difference in my body is phenomenal.  She is amazing and these exercises do exactly what she says they will do, support a healthy, flexible and pain-free body no matter our age.  My back and feet are pain free and that comes from a very painful plantar fascitis foot condition along with an overstressed back from weight lifting and hard core aerobics.  I walk away from these exercises feeling 10 lbs light and 20 years younger.",1515542400,2,526,4.623655913978495

6398549,5,B00K1MPGBK,"I love this workout! I have tried every workout out there including Tracy Anderson with endless reps boring reps and even though I did it faithfully 6 days a week I saw very little change in my trouble spots! But I disproved this by accident early one morning & I thought, hmmm why not it looks easy & relaxing! I was hooked! I started recording them every morning & doing two in a row 6 days a week! And I have a bulging disk low in my spine & also chronic neck pain from a car accident 20 years ago, terrible mind numbing headaches I just thought would forever be my life. This workout not only helped me drop 25 lbs without 100s of reps like Tracy Anderson tortures you with, I went down two pant sizes, I am almost 50 & feel fantastic! Thinner more flexible & my back no longer keeps me awake at night, my neck even feels better more stretched out & I am suffering less headaches per month! I love her positive attitude & she does the workout right along with you! This workout has improved my posture relieved my back pain & put a spring in my step! I swear by this workout!

I am a swimmer. I have a herniated disc and incredible back pain - spending thousands on decompressions, Chiropractors and doctors. Nothing... NOTHING.... has come close to helping like this DVD set has. I've dropped from a pain level of 8/10 to 2/10. Miranda is a fantastic, knowledgable instructor. My bad posture and strength has improved drastically. I feel amazing. Walking tall and loving my fit and firm body. Will always be grateful for this amazing find and will workout to it everyday for the rest of my life.

I watch people abuse, sweat, twist, lift, run, bike like no body should b pushed and Mosta my life I've done it myself... she and Callum have improved my shape , fascia, nerves, ligaments, muscles like nothing else, not even Pilates/yoga. I know that's shocking to u millenials. She is wise and covers all bases..... a shout out to Leslie Sansone also, that I discovered in early 80's when she worked out in her living room, after pushing her sofa aside  and inviting in her neighbors, cause she couldn't leave her lil ones alone- and she couldn't get to a gym after an ice storm....!!!!!

6398563,5,B00K1MPGBK,"I really like the way this dvd set gives you small segments to do each day---and there are at least 50 such segments.  Each segment works a different part of the body
and each segment is different so you never get bored.  You can of course repeat each segment at will.  The music is different
for each part ..  Miranda gives needed information as you exercise, not wasting anytime with a separate ledture.
I've been using these dvds while I'm also listening to my favorite radio talk show--The Thom Hartmann Show--- so I keep the
sound way down on the dvd while keeping my radio show loud enough.  This way I can learn a lot from the show while also
getting in at least two hours of exercise.  I've had a ton of exercise videos through my many years and this set is the very best
I've ever had; wish I'd discovered it many years ago.",1502409600,,833,4.3076923076923075
6398564,5,B00K1MPGBK,"Although she's improved and updated some of the joint positions and body awareness cues in Season 10 (how to properly do a sit-up, for example, has been updated at least twice in the course of all seasons), Season 11 would be the go-to first timer series.

I will start with the cons, but they don't even put a dent in the 5 stars this DVD set deserves.

Miranda doesn't always explain correct joint position, or joint tension (for critical support) in every workout, Season 10 does contain some excellent workouts in which she very clearly tells you to, say, lock in your abs or your knees.  The workout segments with those explanations are gold.  Just wish she'd remind me on ALL the workouts.  She still messes up on counting once in a while, so my advice is to not always mirror-image her, but do the same arm or leg as her half the time.  Eventually, you will even out your two sides.  But it's irksome that she doesn't have a director to go over these with her and re-do the uneven ones.  Every so often there's a workout that is paced too fast for me to perform with correct body postioning, but at least these give me something to shoot for. Probably my only complaints about this series.

The Pro's:  FEEL GOOD through exercise, while miraculously slowing the ageing process and restoring mobility and energy throughout your body!  That's what Classical Stretch is truly all about.  There are way more ""feel good"" workouts in Season 10 than in earlier seasons.  The two Stress Release workouts are GOLD, simply THE ANTIDOTE to a day of muscular aches, random stiffness or pain, etc.
EASY TO DO!  Her explanations are getting better, and the camera angles are almost all the right ones to see what she's doing, if knees are bent, etc.  There are abdominal and waist workouts inside this DVD set that do NOT emphasize situps, the actions which I personally detest.  So that is really wonderful.

I throw on a Season 9 or 10 disc every morning and it really gets me feeling great throughout the day.

If you are an absolute beginner, or you are very out of shape, you could spend a whole month just doing the two Stress Release workouts on this DVD set, and you'd be feeling like a million bucks and ready to try some fo the other workouts!!",1502064000,3,2247,4.5334987593052105

6398566,5,B00K1MPGBK,"I have been doing this series daily for a couple years.  I wake up first thing in the AM and actually look forward to this workout.  When you are done with the work out you actually feel great.  My mom noted that my shoulders are a lot more square as this has improved my posture.  I stand at work and I have learned how to do posture exercises while standing, so it's something you can incorporate into your daily life once you learn the techniques.",1501718400,,450,4.258823529411765

I really like the workouts and have been impressed what you can accomplish in the 23 minutes of time for each workout.  Sometimes I do two of the workouts together to make it 46 minutes.  I would recommend this workout to anyone - old, young, very fit or just beginning to workout.  I workout at least 5 days per week and have completed workouts like T- 25, P90X3, Hammer and Chisel and I do a lot of Cathe Friedrich workouts.  I have been working out on my own for over 10 years. I thought the workouts would be too easy for me but they are not as easy as I had expected them to be.  The workouts are what I would consider low impact - all done in bare feet.  They are kind of a combination of moving yoga, pilates, tai chi and stretching.  I wish I would have known about the Classical Stretch dvd's and started using them sooner.  They really lengthen and strengthen your body.  I have now ordered season 8.",1495065600,,995,4.135416666666667

6398601,5,B00K1MPGBK,"The thing I like most about this is also what I dislike about it (clear as mud, eh?). This set has specific All Barre, All Floor, All Standing (noted on the back of the DVD case) for each episode so I can pick and choose for how I feel at that moment, but some days I would like to mix it up a little so I am asking for a second set for Christmas to solve that minor issue. I am 32 years old and was diagnosed with Fibromyalgia 15 years ago along with struggling with heart palpitations, spina bifida/structural issues in my lower back (I actually don't do many floor routines for this reason, I physically cannot lay on my back without pain, not matter what it is), and a variety of other health things. This is one of the few work outs I can do that doesn't have a negative effect on my body. If I do too much cardio, my heart goes nuts (Rip:60 was an issue). Weight training leads to aches and pains. There are enough episodes in each set to prevent total boredom as well (I can't stand walking/running on a treadmill for that reason.... BOOOOORING).

It takes a little while to get used to her style, so if you find it confusing or hard to follow at first please give it another shot! Watch a few episodes and you can better understand the flow. Keep trying! Never would I have imagined that a series of stretches would be such a fantastic workout! I have had sore muscles where I never thought possible! (My hands and feet? Hello! Not sore, like walked too long in a bad pair of shoes, but the good kind of sore). I have recommended it to a number of friends - one of which mentioned that ballet/dance was the only form of exercise she has every enjoyed but can't find an adult class...",1480809600,6,1691,4.235294117647059

6398621,5,B00K1MPGBK,"After seeing Miranda on a PBS special, I was intrigued.  This is the workout I decided to try.  I am 37 years old and have given birth to 6 children.  I was pretty active until I started having children, but my exercise routine waned with the business of motherhood.  I tried to get back into the swing of various programs, but couldn't maintain anything consistently due to lack of time/energy.  Because we eat a healthy diet, I was able to get back to pre-pregnancy weight between each of my children's births (until this last one), but my muscle tone and strength was disappearing.  I had lower back pain from being pregnant, toting around small children and breastfeeding, my upper back was always tight, my hips hurt (especially during pregnancy), and I had some knee pain in my left knee.  I also noticed when my sixth baby would push his feet into my belly, that my belly button hurt--likely the beginnings of an umbilical hernia.

Enter Classical Stretch.  The workouts were enjoyable and immediately relieved tension, especially in my upper back (the first workout on this DVD is my favorite for a tense back).  I quickly regained strength I had lost in my entire body.  The belly button pain was gone in a matter of 2-3 weeks, because her core strengthening is so effective.  My knee pain was gone after doing the quad-strengthen exercises where you lift your leg in a lengthened position.  I had more energy overall and I was gradually losing that last stubborn baby weight from the 6th pregnancy.

Not only are the exercises effective, but they are also doable for a busy mom.  I can fit in a 23-minute workout (sometimes even 2).  And I'm not sweating profusely like I did with other workouts, so I can jump back into life once I've done it without needing a shower.  I highly recommend this DVD or others from Miranda or her daughter Sahra.",1472342400,6,1854,4.655384615384615

I ordered these after an extended illness as a low stretch ay to get back in shape yet it quickly became apparent that they are worthy additions to daily life even when I get back to baseline. If you are not familiar with Bob Ross, but he was a gentle painter with a soft, sweet voice who would lead you through a televised lesson in painting on PBS.  He really believed anyone could paint and made you believe it too.  Enter Miranda Esmonde-White, age 64 going on 46, she thinks even if you are not fit and your body is stiff etc.  Each workout is different and short and focuses on different body benefits (e.g., strong bones ).  There are enough workouts and DVDs for great rotation.  I just wish it was available for streaming since when I am 64, no one will have a DVD player.",1463702400,3,870,4.274390243902439

I am not overweight so I am not sure how she thinks people with bad knees can do this . I have wasted my money and I'm very disappointed .

6398678,3,B00K1MPGBK,"All four DVDs in the package are marked ""Strength & Flexibility Season 10,"" and as disc 1, disc 2, disc 3, and disc 4.  However, there is no indication whatsoever on the label of the individual discs as to which 23-minute episodes are on which disc.  The back side of the DVD case lists all 30 episodes with a general description of each, but no clue on the packaging as to which disc contains which episodes.

I just received the set, so haven't started to view them yet.  Am hopeful the episodes are recorded in sequential order, the way they are listed on the back cover of the DVD case.

I might update my review if I discover the episodes are relatively easy to find, assuming there are at least chapter stops on each DVD to allow some ease in accessing the episodes, without having to fast-forward blindly through each DVD.

For a standard DVD (it's not Blu-ray), the set is EXPENSIVE at $69.95, so it better be easy to navigate.  Otherwise, I will be returning it!!

By the way, another disappointment with this set is the fact that each disc is enclosed in a flimsy paper sleeve inside the DVD case!!!  Not one of the discs is secured on a spindle.  They are all stacked on top of each other in a squared-out cavity inside the DVD case!!

The packaging of this 4-disc DVD set is a disappointment!!  Let's hope the material on the discs makes up for it, as it is an EXPENSIVE DVD set.

UPDATE (3/29/16):  Well, I have viewed the first disc (labeled disc 1) and fortunately the main menu DOES indicate the episodes on the disc, in sequential order, exactly as indicated on the back cover of the DVD case.  In addition, you need only use the DVD player's remote control to scroll down the main menu to the desired episode, and it begins, so it is fairly easy to navigate.

As mentioned in several other reviews, the episodes go by at a good clip, and there are NO subtitles, so one must have excellent hearing AND be able to watch Miranda at the same time you try to keep up with her as she goes through the routines.  Repeating the routines a few times will likely allow one to remember the moves and hopefully be able to keep up with Miranda as she guides you through the episodes.

I hope to attain better strength and flexibility as I practice these exercises...diligently and regularly!!

P. S.  I purchased the set from Absolute Yogi and shipping was fulfilled by Amazon.  It came well packaged and was delivered on time along with several other titles I ordered.  No complaints about the seller or the shipper.",1459123200,9,2522,4.460698689956332

Such a great reminder to be kind to our physiques and really work for range of motion, not over-exercising and making it too hard.  Lots of great exercises and stretches for the feet and ankles which is really improving my weak ankles and helping to get range of motion back due to tight Achilles.  I can't say enough. I plan to do these for years to come.  My only issue is that I think the DVD formatting is Canadian so there can be some starts and stops.

I have been doing exercising at home since Jane Fonda wore that crazy leotard in the, ah 1980s? And I've curated a collection that is diverse and varied. But that's the point, my choices.
With all the various classes she does on these multiple DVDs, if you don't like one--go to the next. There should be enough to suit anyone.

UPDATE. Now that I've been doing bits of this working my way through all the different...and varied...routines; I love this even more. My only  critique is that if the discs were marked with the routine numbering system--it would be easier to refer to what you want to DO.

6398704,5,B00K1MPGBK,"I am 33 and have pelvic organ prolapse and suffer from sciatica. I was hurting so much that I could not sleep at all. My therapist says, I need to do fascia(connected tissue) release before stretching tight muscles. I know from past that Esmonde's dynamic stretches are hitting that connected tissue between muscles as well. So I went for it. Now after doing those stretches for deep leg and hip flexibility, my pain just vanishes ! Its magic ! I add the foam roller as well. My favorite episodes are stress release, zero impact cardio and deep leg and hip flexibility.

I have been doing these exercises for a couple months now. My lung capacity has increased because of her exercises that open up muscles surrounding rib cage. I could inhale for only 4 secs. Now my inhale is at 4 to 6 seconds, as well as exhale. That means, when I am ready for strengthening/Pilates I can engage core better !
Esmonde is a great find for me :)",1453852800,4,930,4.470588235294118

6398712,5,B00K1MPGBK,"I own Seasons 9 and 10 and will post this same review on both product pages. Classical Stretch has quickly become one of my faves. 1) I feel great and see results. 2) the exercises help alleviate my arthritis. 3), at 22-minutes per episode, I actually do a show almost every day, rather than just think about it. I've been a home exerciser for decades, but as I've aged I've had to adjust. I can't do high-impact anymore, jogging long ago gave way to walking, and arthritis affects even my yoga. My local PBS station airs CS and that's how I found it. Quickly became hooked (made my purchases from the CS website). I agree with other reviewers that the seasons increase in intensity. Season 9 is easier for me than Season 10. Most Season 9 episodes are half standing and half floor work. Season 10 is almost all standing routines. Also, as others have noted, Miranda occasionally moves too fast. I do the movements at my own pace. Ditto for the knee bends and leg lifts, which I do within my range of motion. Classical Stretch has joined Gilad (older shows) and Leslie Sansone as my go-to choices.",1451260800,4,1097,4.517587939698492
6398713,3,B00K1MPGBK,"Average, but could be better if the instructor taught the movements vs gabbing on and on about how good the exercise was or relishing over how beautuful the carribean is. We've been doing the exercises for a couple of months - very good - we are more flexible and feel younger... but MEW is often very difficult to follow, loses her place and the camera angles are wrong for the exercise. For instance, on stretches for hands, the camera continues to take a wide swatch of the background with a full-bodied EMW in the picture and you can barely see the hands. Or they do a front on view when they should be doing a sideview. She often loses track of where she's at and doesn't complete balanced work on each side because the music ends, and a lot of it is due to her continual annoying waxing about how good the exercise is or repeating physiological information over and over... do her good to go for some instructional technique",1450828800,7,930,4.476470588235294

Miranda's focus on full-body flexibility and strength seems geared toward the elderly, but I'm a pretty fit 30 year old and get a lot out of every episode. I would describe the workouts as a blend of tai chi and pilates. My PBS station airs Classical Stretch episodes, so I was able to try out some of the programs before shelling out $60 for this set.

The fourth disk had what looked like a manufacturer's defect on the playing surface. I wanted to do an even exchange for an undamaged set, but I couldn't figure out how to do that through Amazon. The obvious options allowed only return for a refund, so I returned the set and did not reorder.

6398811,2,B00K1MPGBK,The only problem I have with Classical Stretch is it seems to be made for people already familiar with the moves and positions in the exercises.  I found I could not keep up with the fast pace and learn the techniques as well.

6398812,5,B00K1MPGBK,"People around the world whose lifestyles have moved from regular physical labor to sitting in front of computers and other screens most of the day have realized that their lack of regular movement has left us with weakened backs, replacement of parts, and severe weight issues.  Classical stretch is not for sissies:  You sweat as you move --  yet the exercise equipment you use is your own body weight and maybe a chair for balance.
There is no excuse to avoid a segment of the disc:  at most you are doing 15-20 minutes of movement if you only choose one band on the CD at a time.  Afterwards, you feel the accomplishment! and maybe will try another band for a different concentration.  The hardest part for us was to select, sight-unseen, which series to buy.  Will only the one I bought be enough?  Don't know, since I haven't left the first CD yet!",1435276800,2,853,4.529411764705882
6398813,4,B00K1MPGBK,"Think this video series is excellent.  I am unable to get up and down from the floor easily, so the exercises are in groups of all floor or all standing.  They are about 25-30 minutes in length.  She does a good job of demonstrating but gets on my nerves because she talks too much.  It could just be me, but just shut up and do the exercises.

I received the items 2 days ago and started doing the exercises yesterday. I did the first 2 sessions on Disc One.  I am 69 and have been doing yoga for years.
I just love these exercises and plan to do 2 sessions daily.  I was totally energized by the exercises.
I think the pace is perfect. If I don't get the hang of an exercise right away, I just rewind the sequence and redo it until I get it right. It feels like yoga combined with aerobics and choreography. At times it felt like I was learning a vigorous dance routine.

I wonder if this is geared more towards people who watch the TV series, in which case, why would they buy the DVD, but I was very shocked that she just dives in and gives instruction like: ""Now lift the heavy weight, stretch forward...etc"". P.S. you are not lifting any weight. It is mega confusing if you've never done this before. I was basically just flailing around. No instruction on form for most of the session. I am not sure why it is like that. Makes for a very frustrating and confusing workout, which I am sure was not the instructor's intent.

6398838,5,B00K1MPGBK,"A great workout for the middle-aged Public television viewer - and I mean that as a compliment :-).  Now that I'm at an age where my peers and I are more likely to get injuries from things like picking up something or twisting the wrong way while gardening or cleaning house rather than from playing competitive sports, my ideal workout is something that helps me maintain and improve mobility, balance, posture, strength, and flexibility, preferably without the flashy dance-club soundtrack and super-chiseled and impossibly perky instructors that you find in so many workout videos.

Ms. Esmonde-White's workouts fit my needs nicely, and I appreciate how she explains which muscle groups are being used for the different exercises and how those muscles affect things like our balance and posture (guess the educational component appeals to the Public Television nerd in me, LOL).  And of course the greatest workout DVDs don't do much good if you don't use them, so I really appreciate: 1) the 22-minute length of each workout - many times when I haven't felt like exercising, I could tell myself ""It's only 22 minutes"" and get over the mental block; 2) the inclusion of a full season on the DVD set - because no matter how good a DVD workout session is, it can feel stale after a few repetitions, so having a wider variety of workouts also makes me more inclined to work out regularly.",1432598400,16,1388,4.848101265822785

I have set the goal to get in shape every year and then I overdo and get injured or get sick and get derailed. I can do these workouts and even if sick there are two different stress management episodes to use so that I can maintain the daily consistency I need. I have not focused on ""mobility"" (flexibility) and joint health and she teaches that this can cause injuries. I plan to do one a day for a year. I will do other workouts too but I plan this year to mostly use this workout to establish a very needed habit of daily workout.

This workout will not cause me to overdo and will help if I happen to overdo on other workouts. I love the classical music and living with 6 ft snow drifts outside right now her sunny background is wonderful. She is actually in my age range for a nice change and isn't a magazine model. She is also very likable and has a calm but motivational voice.

The DVDs are not labeled and I used a permanent marker to label as I plan to do the workouts by calender dates mostly. I wish the episode info was printed on the DVD because I prefer not to keep the jackets and to store in a DVD binder. I love that each workout is either all standing, all floor or all barre (chair used as support).",1421539200,13,1306,4.137795275590551

Miranda Esmonde-White is an excellent instructor, who teaches flexibility, strength, and endurance in just a 23 minute session.  I highly recommend these for any age.  I do them daily, as do my two daughters.  Marie was a professional ballerina who broke her ankle and had to quit the profession, and Classical Stretch evolved from there.  She has worked with physicians and physical therapists to develop her program.
I highly recommend to everyone, regardless of age or workout level.",1413676800,13,582,5.010416666666667

6398963,5,B00K1MPGBK,"I really like the Classical Stretch program.  I follow the program on Public Television and do it every morning.  I purchased the Season 10 DVD to take with me when I travel.  I find the program has really helped me with toning and movement.  It encourages you to twist and stretch comfortably into positions that one normally would not reach helping to increase one's range of motion.  I only wish I could increase my flexibility, but that may come with time.  I would highly recommended this program to anyone.",1411257600,17,512,4.696629213483146

6398966,5,B00K1MPGBK,"I absolutely LOVE this 10th season of Classical Stretch, ""Strength and Flexibility"". This was my 1st time to order one  of Miranda Esmonde-White's DVDs.  One of the advanced dancers at my dance studio, where I take tap and jazz, recommended it.  I try to do one of the segments 5 mngs a week.  It not only energizes me, but it also is so good for muscles and bones.  I LOVE the music as well as the beautiful scenery of Jamaica.  I am 64, but this DVD would b so good for those in their 20s up thru 80's!!!",1409356800,33,506,4.112244897959184

6398970,3,B00K1MPGBK,"Ms. Esmonde-White is a pro and the moves she shows us are wonderful for keeping your body flexible and strong. What she doesn't do well is keep in mind the fact that some of us would like to do these workouts daily. She over-explains every move. This is good the first time, but after you've got it, having to stop and wait for her to explain and explain and explain is unfortunate. I think it would help if she had people in the class with her so she could see how her stop and start tendencies make for an unpleasant, disorganized workout experience. If these videos are like the classes I've recorded from PBS, I would skip it. If she has moved the instructions to a different section and the classes thus flow smoothly with less conversation, I'll be the first in line to buy ever tape she's made because she knows her stuff. Can anyone tell me, are these the same as the classes on TV?

Update November 8, 2014: I took the plunge. She's a wealth of information so even though her counting is often off and she talks a lot, having so many different workouts keeps it from becoming wearing. What she teaches is just too valuable to skip. Also, the discs are not labeled so you have no idea which workouts are on which discs. I was able to get that information from the editorial section of this page though and I just mapped that out on the back of the DVD jacket. Problem solved.",1407456000,502,1383,4.33976833976834
6398971,5,B00K1MPGBK,"I have been using Classical Stretch's Season 9 for some time now and wanted to add a little more variety to my stretching routine.  If possible, I like Season 10 even more than Season 9, though I'd say they are both excellent.  Miranda Esmonde-White is just so pleasant to listen to and to follow along with, and I can already tell that my strength and flexibility are improving. I am 60 years old, and find the exercises both challenging and do-able.

The seller is also highly recommended, because when I noticed that the sale price came down about $10 just a few days after I placed my order, I brought this to their attention and they very willingly and quickly refunded me the difference!  Excellent customer service! I would definitely buy from them again.",1407196800,148,762,4.664179104477612

6398977,5,B00K1MPGBK,"This is a wonderful stretch and strengthen workout.  Since beginning Classical Stretch, I've been pain free in my back, hips and shoulder.  I suffered a whiplash injury in my back and neck as well as a shoulder injury and this program, in combination with some chiropractic work, has been wonderful for the healing of all 3 injuries.  The workouts are short - 23 minutes - and in this series, they focus on all floor, all standing or all barre workouts. Because they are short, you can do them daily with no problem and I feel better when I'm consistent with the workouts.  All segments feature great leading by Miranda Esmonde-White who is informative and supportive.  You learn not only HOW to do the moves, but WHY you are doing them.  I have learned so much about the physiology of my body and about how to keep myself pain free and moving with more ease.

I have most of her DVD's and the advantage of this one is that each session is either all standing, all floor work or all barre work - so you can create exactly the workout you desire. Other series contained combined workouts - so this one is unique in that regard.
