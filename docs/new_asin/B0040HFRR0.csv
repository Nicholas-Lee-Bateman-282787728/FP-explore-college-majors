4240447,5,B0040HFRR0,"I've been a massage therapist for many years, and it wasn't until a client asked me about craniosacral therapy that I gave it much thought. I understood that these techniques could help clients with issues relating to the neck, back, and brain, but I didn't really know how, and frankly it intimidated me quite a bit.

Since watching this video, I have a much deeper understanding of the craniosacral system, and how I can utilize specific rhythmic techniques and palpations to relieve pain, promote healing, and improve the body's overall function. It sounded plausible when I first read about it, but having the instructor delve deeply into the science of the craniosacral system and how relates to issues of the mind and body, I became a believer and wanted very much to learn.

The instructor in the DVD is really great. John Hoffman is very educated professional and a great teacher. The demonstration is very detailed and I was able to apply the techniques that i learned right away. Learning about this intriguing topic has worked very well in my favor. I am doing even more to relieve stress, pain, and other ailments form my clients, and this was the only resource that I needed.",1428364800,5,1188,4.790243902439024

8412338,5,B0040HFRR0,"This is a finely produced video that seems to very clearly convey the subtleties of the practice. There is an extensive list of chapters including (but not limited to):
Introduction
Objectives
Benefits and Contraindications
Origins and Theories
Craniosacral Anatomy
Application of Theory
Craniosacral Impulse (with subchapters)
Clearing Energy Cysts (with subchapters)
Cranial Work (with subchapters)

I doubt that I will practice this method of healing (as doing so is not safe without proper training), but the information on the craniosacral system and cerebrospinal fluid is helpful for expanding my general knowledge of healing.",1451433600,6,633,5.806451612903226
