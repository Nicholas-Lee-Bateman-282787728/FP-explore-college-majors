8327584,5,B001NOQ8WQ,"Always a lover of Latin music, I had attempted my own arrangements of things like the Girl from Ipanema with mixed results.  This DVD starts at a fairly basic level a works up to advance intermediate level with several Brazilian classics.  If you work at it you will shortly be playing ""One Note Samba"" like a pro.  Great arrangements and instruction.",1401926400,,351,4.721311475409836
8327585,5,B001NOQ8WQ,"Rick Udler & Robert Conti are the two best guitar teachers that I've ever found. They are both masters, Rick Udler Brazilian guitar , and Robert Conti Jazz guitar. I mention both because their two styles blend perfectly together in method and music. The powerhouse of instruction is easy to understand, and I really like that Rick uses a split screen and takes the time to show and tell the names of the chords,rhythms, various tips on technique and then applies them to great songs like One Note Samba at tempo then he plays slowly enough so that you don't have to constantly push the rewind button to learn what he is doing. And if you ever wanted to play happy birthday samba style Rick shows the coolest version ever. Along with plenty of great songs he shows in great detail a pocket book is included with The Brazilian Sound for Fingerstyle Guitar DVD. Rick Udler's dvd is my best money ever spent. In closing I am so grateful that Rick Udler made this DVD and that I found it.",1308009600,8,983,4.466666666666667
