5742328,5,B00CVB6XZM,"The entire movie is a great cinema achievement. Spenser Tracy is simply the best. Though some may consider this too artificial, nevertheless it achieves its primary goal: a motion picture that is full of supreme acting and makes the audience connect to the story & characters with great charm. They do not make them like this anymore  what a pity!",1375574400,,347,4.783333333333333
5742329,3,B00CVB6XZM,"""A Guy Named Joe"" was one of biggest box office winners of 1944. It has a stellar cast, a screenplay by Dalton Trumbo, its director is Victor Fleming {Gone with the Wind, The Wizard of Oz} and it is scrumpcously photographed by ace cameramen George Folsey and Karl Freund. This is a big budget, top quality, ""A Class"" picture AND despite all these assets - it is a overlong, pretensious World War 11 melodrama that has some serious miscasting and screenplay issues and after viewing the film I found it to be somewhat of a disappointment.

Spencer Tracy {Pete Sandidge} is too old and overweight to play a young ""hotshot pilot"". Irene Dunne is way to old {at 45 + years} to play ""Dorinda"" a young seasoned pilot in love with Pete and after Pete's untimely death has hotshot pilot # 2 Van Johnson {Tex Randall} enamoured of her even though he is almost 20 years her junior - this some very strange casting !  MGM had any # of younger actresses who would have been more realistically and better cast -  Donna Reed, Lana Turner, Francis Gifford, Ann Southern and Marsha Hunt who were all long term MGM contract actresses.

The storyline is simple. Pete is a headstrong combat pilot who in an act of heroism {or reckless stupidity?} sacrifices his life and plane to sink an enemy aircraft carrier. He goes to heaven !! {Heaven after committing suicide ?} where he meets ""The General"" an ancient Lionel Barrymore who assigns him the mission as a benevolent, unseen ""spirit mentor"" to watch over the pilots of his squadron and influence them to make the right descisions while in flight training and in combat. Pete takes a particular interest in Tex and steers this raw talented youngster thru the travails of his inexperience and ""period of immortality"" in thinking nothing can ever happen to him with Pete realizing that Tex is a young pilot cast exactly in his mold/mindset.

The supporting cast is excellent and includes Barry Nelson, Esther Williams, Ward Bond, Don Defore and James Gleason. S.Tracy despite being miscast gives a subtle, restrained performance as the spirit guiding Tex talking him thru his implusive recklessness to become the responsible pilot/leader he needs to become. Pete also has to influence a grieving Dornida to put her love for him behind her and move on - this is the wartime love and death aspect of the screenplay that falls flat and leads to the rather contrived and far-fetched climax of the movie. Irene Dunne's performance is by degrees too coy, strained and overwrought and it is not one of her better efforts.

This is the movie that made Van Johnson a star because while filming this movie he suffered major injuries {and nearly died} from an automobile accident it was S.Tracy who  objected to Johnson being replaced and refused to continue the movie until Johnson was ready to resume filming. It was one of the most generous gestures that Tracy ever extended to a young actor - it saved Johnson's career and he never ceased to be gratefull to Tracy for his kindness and how he used his ""star power"" and stood up for Johnson against the MGM top brass who wanted to replace him.

I love World War 11 movies that were made during the war years but this one rings ""Kind of Hollow"" and in my opinion does not hold up very well. This is a strange, strained, hybrid, mixed bag of a movie and despite good direction from Victor Fleming and outstanding production values - the casting, screenplay and other flaws prevent me from giving it more than a lukewarm 3 star rating.",1372896000,4,3505,4.678571428571429
5742330,5,B00CVB6XZM,"One of my best loved movies, took a long time to go to DVD. The quality was good, would like to see more extras.",1372809600,2,112,3.7083333333333335
5742331,5,B00CVB6XZM,"It's a very good movie. It's a very moving movie with Spencer Tracy was so good in it. When he died it was very sad,but he comes back helps other men who want to fly bombers.",1372723200,,174,3.861111111111111
5742332,2,B00CVB6XZM,"The idea of Irene Dunn piloting a P-38 fighter-bomber to blow up a Japanese ammunition dump is just as preposterous as Janet Leigh's role as a Russian jet pilot in the film of that name (Jet Pilot). Spencer Tracy should never have been shoe-horned by MGM into this piece of drivel. Wartime cinemagoers may have been conned into accepting such fantasies, but in retrospect this movie really bombed. When Tracy dies while crashing his B-25 into a German aircraft carrier, I realised that the fantasy lay in MGM producers failing to realise that Germany had only one carrier, the 'Graf Zepelin' which was never involved in any naval activity. Tracy is no romantic lead and it comes as no surprise that on his demise he is supplanted by Van Johnson. What the two stars illustrate in this film is their brashness and rashness. Ward Bond plays the role of Tracy's best friend during his lifetime, while Barry Nelson is his mentor in the afterlife. Lionel Barrymore as the 'heavenly' general is as brusque as usual despite his occasional lapses into lyricism, while Esther Williams makes a brief appearance as Johnson's dancing partner. The only part of the movie which appealed to me was Irene Dunn singing 'I'll Get By' to the accompaniment of Bond on his harmonica. Tracy had a more successful role as a B-25 pilot the following year in 'Thirty Seconds over Tokyo', where Van Johnson also appeared, but this time without dancing because he had lost both his legs.",1365984000,3,1459,4.7936507936507935

5742346,4,B00CVB6XZM,"This film was later remade and called, ""Together"" with Holly Hunter and Richard Dreyfus and John Goodman in a fabulous supporting role.  I had seen this as a kid so wanted to check it out.  I recommend the remake because of the fire scene (instead of Army Air Force during W.W.II) and because Audrey Hepburn is in it as well.

When we finally found a player that would run it, the movie is clear and the sound is good.
However, I didn't find out that it wouldn't play in a DVD deck that can also record.
We do have a play only DVD deck and it plays fine on it.
Wish you would have included this information in your advertisement.
I'd still have bought the movie and have known what I was getting.",1375574400,,413,4.048780487804878
