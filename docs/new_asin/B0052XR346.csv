8627246,3,B0052XR346,"Chalo Paltai is Haranath Chakrabarty's second film in recent times with Prasenjit Chatterjee (WBRi Interview) and appears to be two films rolled into one as both the halves are completely different in nature and the film totally deviates from it's path and message in every form and goes towards a completely different direction.

In the first half Subhamoy is a widower and he has two children Munni and Gaurav who is an extremely talented cricketer, but pretty dull when it comes to studies. His father does not consider a career in the game of cricket acceptable, and though not particularly well-off, manages to buy an expensive dress for his academically smart daughter.

The father at times supports his son and yet at the same time wants him to give up cricket and concentrate on his studies. When Gaurav's principal refuses to allow him to sit for Madhyamik (middle school graduation examination), his father asks the principal to give him 5 days within which Gaurav would produce the desired results. When things remain the same and there is a heated argument one day, Subhamoy strikes Gaurav and his head hits the bed and he starts bleeding and falls unconscious. He is taken to the hospital where he falls in to a coma. This is the first half of the film.

The second half of the film starts with Gaurav being in a coma and Subhamoy suddenly becoming a cricket lover instead of a cricket hater for the sake of his son. He completely changes himself and Subhamoy changes into classic Prasenjit. His body language, mannerisms, his over the top dialogues everything suddenly shocks people. His shouting, crying, giving interviews on the road, on a T.V channel along with the act at the C. M's house makes him an icon overnight! He is able to change the system thanks to his act at the C.M's house, his son also miraculously comes out of coma after an operation, resumes his cricket and even scores a century on his return by hitting a six.

Everything in the second half looks as if the film has been made keeping mass-entertainment in mind. Everything goes for a toss and suddenly a different film is created just for them. Everything looks forced .When Subhamoy is trying to change the system, it is as if because of the flow of the screenplay at that point of the film, no one would remember their tables, no history teacher will remember their history just to make the film work. Then you have Prasenjit's (yes at that point he is not Subhamoy any more) histrionics which would embarrass any one. The act at the C.M's house nothing short of destroys the entire film which had such an excellent first half and this was nothing short of a mockery and extraordinary dramatics. This certainly wasn't expected from someone like Haranath Chakrabarty who was expected to make an intelligent film. The things that he has done with this film for the sake for the box office is beyond words.

Prasenjit is, of course, very good as Subhamoy in the first half, but in the second half it is Prasenjit, the numero uno, the man or the masses who takes over and then the film becomes a massacre. Then it just becomes a matter of playing to the gallery and no one knows better than him how to do it. The cinematography by Soumik Haldar is excellent. The music is by Anupam Roy of Autograph fame who also doubles as the lyricist. His 'Bariye Dao' which keeps on playing in the entire film (a single line though) is brilliant, though it ceases to be so once the song is played in the end in it's entirety and in a faster version and then it becomes just a pleasant number. Rajatava Dutta as Imran is very good while T.V actress Mouli Ganguly who plays a complex character displays restrained acting while playing a character without guilt and is very good. The actors who play Subhamoy's neighbours and double up as his drinking partners play their parts very well. Debdan as Gaurav gets a chance to star along side Prasenjit and he does his job very well, but Tathoi (whom we have seen in previous films) as Munni is brilliant. She plays a character who is caught between her father and her brother and she provides both characters with the neccessary support whenever the characters require it.

The film could have been a good film at trying to reflect on the system, but becomes a complete hotchpotch as the director has little idea as to how to tackle the system or find a solution for it and tries to find a different solution to the matter by playing to the galleries and completely destroying the story and screenplay.",1312416000,,4519,4.628428927680798
