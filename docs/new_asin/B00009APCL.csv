7990283,1,B00009APCL,Can barely see Marcel as the image is so degraded. I think it is a VHS of a VHS of A VHS adapted to DVD.,1401235200,,104,3.2
7990284,5,B00009APCL,"Video recordings of Marcel Marceau's Mimes are rare and difficult to come by : for example none are readily available in France , his home country. This item is therefore unique and precious, in spite of its very modest technical quality. Two of his best numbers can be seen in full ! ""le loubard"" and ""the ages of man"". Strongly recommended for anyone seriously interested in arguably the greatest mime of the twentieth centurty.",1303862400,5,430,4.824324324324325
7990285,1,B00009APCL,"The quality of the filming was so horrible that I could not use it in the classroom.  Very grainy and quality of transfer to DVD so poorly done, that once projected, one could barely see the scenes.  A total waste of time, energy and especially money!  There has to be a better DVD of Marcel Marceau out there somewhere.",1300406400,4,320,4.389830508474576
7990286,1,B00009APCL,"The video quality is pathetic, and my hopes to see good footage of Marcel Marceau on DVD were high. Alas!",1229644800,8,105,4.3
7990287,1,B00009APCL,I am a Theatre teacher who was looking for a prime example of Pantomime to show my students. I ordered this video and was appalled at the horrible quality of the VHS. It is in B/w from the 60's (which isn't a problem) but it is all from one TV show and is hard to see due to a huge horizontal line running through the middle of the screen. I returned the VHS hoping that it was just the single VHS that was bad but it apparently is on the master copy because the one I got back had the same problem. The video is called Meet Marcel Marceau: 1962-today. But it is all one very old performance with no variety and very hard to see. I would try looking somewhere else for a good example of mime.,1094256000,37,692,4.021739130434782
