8490762,5,B0061BEAC6,"The third and final season starts out with some relationship drama as Anna and Daniel, her Swedish fiance, experience difficulties. Daniel, played by Ole Rapace is a complicated character though it's easy to see why Anna was smitten with him originally. As the season progresses, several characters' situations are brought to closure including the very suspenseful, excellent final episode. Anna remained an engaging likeable character and she, her collagues, and Copenhagen were all delightful to get to know.",1352851200,,510,5.551282051282051
