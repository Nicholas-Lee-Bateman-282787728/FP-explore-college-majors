7793423,5,0934803765,"because it was made available on amazon. I owned many years ago, loaned out and it was never returned. The series is no longer made on tape or dvd. Now I will be able to teach more effectively come 1/9/2013. This book of revelation was written for the eyes of people in the present era. Most could not understand the message 70 years ago.
Thanks a million for it's availability.  Marson!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1386288000,2,399,4.619718309859155

7793426,2,0934803765,"I used to love listening to JVI talk about God's Holy Word. I used to find him to be very helpful with his teachings. That was until,I found out that he is buying into the 2012 end of the world lie. How can JVI put ANY thought into this nonsense whatsoever???? It's not even a Christian-based belief. NO WHERE in the Bible does it mention ANYTHING about Dec 21 2012...and there is no ""Bible Code"".That is all garbage. Even If there were such a way of finding out when something would happen like that,that make Jesus out to be a liar. Because it was him that said that on that day and hour knoweth NO man. Not him...not the angels...but The Father ONLY(Matthew 24:36).This is not the first wacky thing JVI has done. I remember years ago,he would critize the Catholic Church time and time again...but then all of a sudden God suddenly ""opened his heart"" regarding the Catholic faith. It seems to me that Mr. Van Impe doesn't know WHAT he believes in. Just remember what God's Holy word says about false prophets and teachers.",1354752000,5,1024,4.510752688172043
7793427,5,0934803765,"JVIM is selling Revelation Revealed as an audio CD set with the book of the same name.  I did buy that audio set and it was very helpful after listening to it several times, then read the book. But with the VHS, you have visual added to it and it makes it even better.  The VHS was made a long time ago and I figure JVIM did not want folks to see them looking younger then they are now and just did the audio copying.  We all age. That is a fact of life.  They should have re-released it on DVD as an original broadcast.",1346803200,,520,3.9238095238095236
7793428,5,0934803765,This has to be the best set of VCR tapes I have on the return of Christ! Mr Van Impe amazes me!  There is an anointing on this study. See you in Heaven.,1245715200,2,152,3.606060606060606
