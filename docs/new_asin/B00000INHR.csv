1226494,5,B00000INHR,"So here it is.  ""Dragon's Lair"" will play withoutpauses on any Apex AD-600A DVD player...  How is the gameplay.  In oneword, ""awesome"".  This game gets you so wrapped up emotionally it is hard to describe.  It is as if you, as an individual are going into the castle and having to face the monsters yourself. When Dirk dies we ""feel his pain"" (to quote someone famous), when he jumps off the falling disc, we hope the wood doesn't bend and break through.  I would have to say my favorite scene is the rafting scene.  It is so beautiful (with that purply water, and green whirlpools,etc.) that I just can't get enough of it.  There are a couple of flaws in the translation.  They aren't that bad though. First off, it would be better if there were random play just like the arcade.  Secondly, sometimes you have to make your move before it is logical to make it (i.e.  during the flying horse scene, you have to move right before the flames shoot up).  Other than that, this is simply awesome with the Apex.  I wouldn't play it without it.",964569600,,1038,4.428571428571429
1226495,4,B00000INHR,"Myself being a HUGE fan of Don Bluth's animation, having played the arcade version TO DEATH as a kid, and managing to play just about every home version from the first attempts, (dust off your memory here) the Commodore  64 version by Electronic Arts, the NES, Super NES, & Game Boy versions,  if you could call them that, (none of which bore any resembelance to the  original laserdisc arcade version) to the early Amiga, IBM PC, & MAC  diskette versions (pre CD-ROM) which were basically digitized and  compressed versions of the arcade game, to every imaginable CD-ROM version,  IBM PC, Sega CD, 3DO, Atari Jaguar, and the PC DVD ROM, I have been  searcing for that ""holy grail"" original arcade version of  Dragon's Lair since the game was brought home....So far, there is NO  perfect arcade version that gives you the TOTAL ORIGINAL ARCADE MOVE INPUTS  AND SCREEN VARIATIONS, however, Digital Leisure has done the best versions  on PC DVD ROM, and for home DVD Players with this version, the play is  solid, and ALL the animation is in tact. Any other gripes aside, the one  second pauses are really not a big deal, because as any fan of the arcade  version knows, most of the pioneer Laserdisc players were pretty faulty to  begin with...so just consider it a ""genuine faulty arcade  feature"" ;-)...secondly, and what I believe to be the most important  reason to own this DVD, is the comprehensive history of Dragon's Lair and  Space Ace....this section is compiled from TV news broadcasts and interview  sessions with Bluth and company from 83-84, which contains deleted game  footage, early production designs, and interviews with arcade patrons with  hairdews and outfits that will make you embarrassed to be a child of the  80's!  TRULY WORTH THE PURCHASE!",962409600,27,1766,4.872053872053872
1226496,4,B00000INHR,"According to the instructions, all the scenes have been put into this game. I played this game in the arcade a lot as a kid, and I don't see any scenes missing.
The game play is definitely different. A little yellow  diamond appears to prompt you to make a decision. Current DVD players have  a hardware limitation that cause pauses when you make a move. The  randomness of the old game are gone. There is one scene that I would always  get caught making the wrong move because many scenes are just the same, but  inverted and the randomness would make you guess which way you had to go.  All these differences can be attributed to hardware limitations.
I heard  the DVD-ROM version will almost eliminate the pauses, so for a truer  game-play, get the DVD-ROM for your PC. For a smoother story line, get  Space Ace or Time Warp. Those two have better continuity. This game was  made in the 80's, and is a little outdated, but I still enjoy playing it.",948067200,,951,4.445086705202312
1226497,1,B00000INHR,"I bought this game with hopes that it would be a great addition to my dvd collection.  Sadly I am embarrassed to tell people I bought it because as a game it just ISNT FUN to play.  I loved the arcade version of Dragon's Lair  and had hoped the transition to dvd would be a smooth one.  It was not.  The animation was great, however key scenes had been cut or trimmed down so  that the story line seemed choppy and hard to follow.  One second you're in  one room and then all the sudden you're in the next.  Fans of the arcade  version will remember the falling platform, in the dvd game this sequence  has been drastically cut down.  Why didn't they include the full arcade  story along with the complete death scenes?  This dvd version should not be  called Dragon's Lair because it's not fun to play and it doesn't capture  the feel of the arcade game.",946512000,7,855,4.283018867924528
1226498,5,B00000INHR,I've loved this movie/game since I first saw it when I was three years old.  The laser disc that supplied this ample animation may not be popular anymore but it paved the way for our current DVD and PC games.,937526400,,208,4.2
1226499,2,B00000INHR,"Remember Dragon's Lair from the arcade? This is the same game but you play it with your DVD remote control. The video quality is top-notch, but the gameplay leaves much to be desired. I expected the game to pause when you  make a wrong move (in order for it to seek the disc for the death scene),  but this DVD actually pauses when you make CORRECT moves. The pause is  about 1 second long. It makes levels such as the chessboard/knight  excruciating painful to sit through. I don't understand why there's a pause  if you make a choice whose animation sequence directly follows the move. In  short, I'd only recommend this DVD for die-hard Dragon's Lair fans. If  Space Ace performance is anything like this DVD's, I'll be sure to skip  buying it. What I'd like to see is a re-release of all of the Don Bluth LD  games on one DVD, with all of the performance bugs worked out.

1226500,1,B00000INHR,"I remember when the game first came out, 1983 and even back then it was frustrating to play. I like the interactively now available through DVD.  Unfortunately this game, although based on interactivity, doesn't offer it  as it is intended. This game could have been re-mastered or even revamped  to suit today's technology.  Its so frustrating to see the same video  screened repeatedly. No skill needed - a basic game that requires very  basic skill, 'pushing the right button at the right time'.  Good for 'old  time', 'reminisce' value - but it ends there.",925344000,,560,4.882978723404255

1226543,5,B00000INHR,"Directed by Don Bluth, DRAGON'S LAIR was the first video game to use regular cell animation and the first to offer a gamer a series of options during game play. Bluth was a famed animator that had gotten tired of politics at Disney and had split with the company to start his own animation company. The company had some success with THE SECRET OF NIMH, but was still struggling. In hopes of reaping financial rewards to booster their animation offerings, Bluth and company took a gamble and entered the relatively new and somewhat-unprofitable world of video games. Despite the financial jeopardy, Bluth knew what he was doing because DRAGON'S LAIR was a mega-success. I remember when DRAGON'S LAIR was first released. At the time it cost double what a normal video game cost (instead of a quarter, it cost fifty cents or in some places instead of fifty cents it cost a whole dollar), but everyone wanted to play it because of the graphics and the non-standard game format. It was like being able to actually play a movie instead of just watching one. Video games have come a long, long way since then, but DRAGON'S LAIR remains as the father of modern day video games.

This box set includes all three of the major animated games that were produced by Don Bluth's animation company. There's DRAGON'S LAIR, DRAGON'S LAIR II: TIME WARP, and the unrelated title of the set SPACE AGE. The animation remains constant throughout the games, but the difficulty in play increases between each of the games. A person can play each of the games if they wish using the DVD remote, or they can skip the play and just watch the story that the games tell. Included in the set are several extra features including interviews with Bluth and Co. about DRAGON'S LAIR as the prepare to release DRAGON'S LAIR 3-D, a featurette about the making of DRAGON'S LAIR (Daphne was modeled after Marilyn Monroe using Playboy magazine pictures as inspiration) archival interviews with Bluth and other co-creators, press releases, previews for other games released by Bluth's company (these weren't near as entertaining or prosperous as the animated ventures because they incorporated live actors in really, really, really cheesy plots), an episode of the television game show STARCADE in which DRAGON'S LAIR was the featured video game; and a few other random items. I found the featurette quite interesting and the STARCADE episode was a serious blast from the past (it even includes some national commercials, such as one for a Disney record--records were cheap). This is a great item for any fan of the original game to own, as well as collectors of pop culture history, and video game enthusiasts.",1448496000,,2671,4.87032967032967

Play-ability is not all there. You have to be exactly on time, I mean just perfect with your button presses. I remember the old arcade version was a little more forgiving as far as timing.

Still, it comes in a nice Box that holds all 3 DVD cases. It's a nice piece to add to your collection but the gameplay is not quite there.",1393372800,,561,4.090909090909091

1226592,4,B00000INHR,"This is great for what it is.  I loved these games as a kid.  Its kind of a pain to get this to run on a computer, and I use ""Daphne Loader"" and some other work-around. But it was kind of a pain, as I'm not particularly computer-savvy. If you're willing to do that stuff, it runs beautifully.  I don't know about the newer blue-ray versions.  I don't think they are supported by Daphne Loader.  I have also tried the iPad version, which is nicely cleaned-up but its really a pain with the touch screen in my opinion.  The game was hard enough as it is, granted its prehistoric by today's standards.  I wouldn't know how to play a Wii if my life depended on it. Anyway Don Bluth's animation is unique and if you like that sort of thing, I highly recommend it. Space Ace and Dragon's Lair 2 are included, which made this a great choice. On my iMac, they really remind me of how the old arcade versions looked.  I probably single-handedly funded these reissues because in the early 80's those machines cost 50 cents a shot and each game, for me, lasted about 3 seconds.",1391472000,,1066,4.321608040201005
1226593,3,B00000INHR,"I played this a lot as a kid.  This is very true to the original, with the exception that it is always in the same order.  the biggest downside is that it is even slower to respond than the original arcade game.  In most scenes, you have to do the correct move before the little glowing thing even shows up, so it becomes more a game of memory than reflexes.  I understand it might be different when played on a computer, but I haven't cared to try that.",1382745600,,454,4.125

1226599,4,B00000INHR,"If you are at all remotely interested in this game, you are more than likely a product of the 70's.  I grew up with all the trappings of early 80's arcade games.  I remember seeing Space Invaders for the first time at my local pizza parlor back in the late 70's..I was probably 7 or 8...The scary big kids would play it wearing their Van Halen and Led Zep T-Shirts. As I grew I became fascinated with titles like Pac-Man, Donkey Kong, Zaxxon, Gorf, Tempest, Wizard of Wor, Joust...to name a few. Along came Dragons Lair, and turned the video game world upside down. Sure the concept seems adolescent compared to todays video games, and probably would be scoffed at from todays gamers, but there was a certain charm that makes this game so unique and loved by classic gamers (aka old guys).  The DVD version is a bit more grainy than I would have guessed (although I see now there is a blu-ray version), and manuvering my XBOX remote was a bit tricky at first, however it does the trick as far as taking you back to when you were stealing quarters from your parents change ashtray so you could feed your arcade addiction. I do have to mention, and I do not know if it is just my computer or my Xbox360, but when I make a move (correct or not) the game pauses, and Dirk either turns into a skeleton (for an incorrect move), or changes from a skeleton into Dirk (for a correct move).  I believe the original just kept going if you made a correct move. A bit strange to see a skeleton Dirk even when a correct move is made...and it does seem to slow the gameplay down a bit...even so, I am glad I made the purchase. I would love to hear if others are having the same issue with this DVD version. The DVD also has a few extras that includes some news footage on the game from back in 84, and some clips with its creators, nice to have some background, but not necessary...the footage just makes me feel old (I guess I am old).  So, if you are a classic gamer like myself, and need a nostalgic fix, grab this one before it goes out of print, like the original, it won't be around forever.",1318896000,,2082,4.260759493670886

NO MORE QUARTERS TO SPEND OR TIME STANDING UP!!! Sit down in your comfy chair and go back to 1984 and waste time in front of your computer instead(as if you don't already)!!! This is the arcade version of all 3 games on 1 disc.

I just want to point out to the people reviewing this as a Blu-Ray or DVD, that this is the HD-DVD version, which is a different type of disc and a whole other kettle of fish. If you bought this version and went and stuck it in your Blu-Ray or standard DVD system, then you should go and remove yourself from the gene-pool right now, as that's probably the reason it's not working properly.
The quality of gameplay is probably affected by the player you are using, as different players may produce different quality results for the same game, due to read and data transfer speeds.
Some of you complain that the game has been edited like a bad Star Wars re-re-release, but have you tried changing the settings? From what I read, there are different difficulty settings and a Home and Arcade version. Try fiddling with those.
This would probably be good on the Xbox 360 with an HD-DVD add-on, or on Blu-Ray with the PS3 as the game controller would be more like an actual game. You can get Arcade type controllers, if you're REALLY into Dragon's Lair.",1295136000,5,1108,4.463054187192118

The only problem I have been encountering in the game is that when I get to the 3rd board with the 3 snakes I can kill all of them but then I can't figure out which control to hit to grab the skull to pull me up.  I first got a used version then I re ordered a new version and both versions do the same thing no matter what control I hit I get wrapped up by the snake.  Also the screen will sometimes freeze for a second. I really love this game but that is as far as I can get.  I used to get to the Dragon board all the time.

The video does look date but sharp.  If there's a defect, it's somewhat grainy.  But again, we're looking at 80s video.

I remember the gameplay more and this hd-dvd has serious branching issues.  I know it's because of the way the designers structured it, but if you die, it randomly jumps to a different scene.  the original game was basically trial and error like learning simon says.  but this one jumps so randomly that you can't memorize the moves like in the original.  the original was like building a story.  you mess up, try a different move until you get it right, move on to the next scene and repeat.  this one, you're constantly jumping so you can't memorize it properly.

For example for every wrong move you make (ie - death) you get sent to a random area of the castle, make two mistakes in a row and you really have no idea how far away you are from finishing. I don't regret purchasing it, but I can't see myself playing this for more than 5-10 minutes at a time.

It skips scenes randomly and acts up.  I have checked the disc for scratches, there are none.  I am currently in the process of trying to get it replaced.  I am curious if anyone else has run into this situation with this game.  It freezes at the opening before the main menu and when I Skip forward there isn't a play or game menu, when I am able to get it going it is skimming scenes right away.

1226777,4,B00000INHR,"Can't say it's a horrible game. Really takes you back to the good old days of mom pulling you away from the direction of the arcade in the mall just so you couldn't dump her money into this machine. Now that you're older and can afford your own junk, a good way to spend money and remember why being a kid will never be the same.

It is what it is, and entertains like it should. I'm stoked that it came with 3 games (never seeing the sequel, anywhere ever!), and have peered through them all. Lots of great bonus stuff (including a ""Starcade"" episode), and extra scenes. My only problem is that the early game is too easy (almost) and the other two (the sequel and ""Space Ace"") are just frustratingly hard! You'll replay scene after scene, dozens of times before you advance to the next one. And then it's your last life and you gotta start all over, hoping you remembered what direction to go.

1226778,5,B00000INHR,Whew!  I couldn't rate the playing as I have not gotten the courage to try it yet.  I had this game before but at the time had windows 95 and game was for windows 98 so couldn't load it.  I have always been curious about it so got it.  Have just watched the play for the graphics and see how it is played.  Wow ... for me the graphics are great but can see it might be over my head as you use the keyboard for play. I'm a grandma over 59 and I just haven't gotten up the nerve to try it yet. I think this one might be over my head (or to quick for my fingers)!  For experienced game players I think they would like it.  Seems to have quite a few levels of play.  P.S.

1226779,4,B00000INHR,"I just got this game today and I am very pleased with my purchase.  Not only did you get the Bluth's three Laserdisc classics, you get some extras that play like DVD extras on your computer.  If you don't remember these games in an arcade, you probably wouldn't want them.  For gamers my age (I am 35), I found this collection to be a hoot and I can't wait to play through all of the extras and see some of the funny ways to die.

Dragon's Lair:
This game reminds me of WarioWare since you have a bunch of different rooms to explore which require a small amount of movements to complete.  The rooms last for a few seconds and do not take too much time to finish.  The tricky part is actually figuring out the correct moves to finish the room safely.  I do feel bad when Dirk the Daring dies, but it is quite entertaining in a cartoon-like way.  This one is my favorite.

Space Ace:
This game (the second in the series) decided to go for a more linear approach.  The game is much faster and a little bit harder to figure out how to move the controls.  I find this to be the hardest game in that respect.  I lost a lot of quarters to this one.

Dragon's Lair II:
I never played this in the arcade, but I would have lost a lot of money.  This game is linear like Space Ace, but it gives you hints for each movement.  You will need those hints since the game is even faster yet.  I like watching this more than playing it, but it is fun.  There are two different endings depending on if you collect some special items along the way.  Don Bluth's company did a great job making the most zany and action packed cartoon ever.

PROS:
+ Dragon's Lair, Dragon's Lair II, Space Ace, and a Disc of extras are all included
+ You can install all of these discs on your hard drive to give you faster play and stutter free videos
+ No more wasted quarters and you can see what you were missing out as a child
+ Dragon's Lair (disc 1) lets you see some deleted scenes
+ Dragon's Lair, Dragon's Lair II, and Space Ace let you watch the game ""movie"" from start to finish

CONS:
- If you are not into these types of games, you can probably see some of this on YouTube
- There were some driver problems I had when I tried to play them, but the support site (linked from the CD) helped me fix it
- They advertise that you want to play them from the CD, but I don't suggest it.  Dump it to your hard drive using the instructions found on the CD (right click on the icon and open the disc to find the file).
- This might be important to a lot of people, but these games are in MPEG format.  While it makes the clips easy to view in almost any player, it is not DVD quality.  This is the reason that there is a new HD version of Dragon's lair on the market.  This may not bother many, but it could be a reason to shell more money for the higher-quality game.

I couldn't give it a 5 star rating because it is not for everyone.  Four stars for this game if you are a fanatic older video games.",1186531200,10,2967,4.054982817869416

I've waited a long time to find these games in a playable home format and this is the best I've seen. It plays on your DVD player, Playstation 2 or X-Box. It also includes  interviews with animator Don Bluth, trailers of other DVD interactive games and an excerpt from the game show ""Starcade"".

1226801,5,B00000INHR,"The original arcade version of Dragon's Lair came out in 1983 when I was 10.  I didn't know what I was doing when I played it back then and as a result, the game would end really fast.  I was upset because I could have played two other video games at the time instead of blowing 50 cents on Dragon's Lair and getting nowhere!  When Space Ace came out in 1984, I played it safe and watched other people play the game instead.  The only problem was not too many people would play Space Ace because they, by then had mastered Dragon's Lair and didn't want to start over on another hard laserdisc game.

Now that I am older and wiser to how these games are supposed to be played, these are 3 great games to play.  Plus the fact that they are the same versions as the ones you may have played in the arcades doesn't hurt either.  My only gripe with the games is the pause in between the moves that you make.  I first tried the Dragon's Lair DVD on my Playstation 2 and the pause was about a second and a half tops which got really annoying.  Then I tried it on my Apple iMac with a 2g hard drive and the pause was practically non-existent!  I managed to finish Dragon's Lair and Space Ace each in two seperate long weekends.  It will, however take a lot longer for me to finish Dragon's Lair 2: Timewarp. That game is really hard and fast!  If you're a fan of laserdisc games, or if you grew up back in the 80's like me, you might want to buy this game package.  It will bring back a lot of memories.  And you won't lose all of your money like in the past!",1175731200,2,1551,4.075907590759076
1226802,4,B00000INHR,"I was originally looking for a DVD-ROM version of this particular Anniversary edition but was informed by Digital Leisure that they did not make one, nor were there any plans to make one.  They did inform me that there is an HD-DVD version of Dragon's Lair, but as I do not own an HD-DVD player, that option was out.

They also said that, when choosing between the two (DVD-Video vs CD-ROM), the DVD-Video has the best quality but doesn't quite behave like the arcade game (different DVD players will have a pause after you make a move that can affect the playing experience).  The CD-ROM version plays more like the arcade game but the quality is not as good.

I went for the DVD-Video version for quality, and I'm not disappointed.  Brought back some very fond memories of spending multiple tokens to complete Dragon's Lair and Space Ace.  I never got to play Dragon's Lair 2 in the arcade so this was brand-new to me.

There are different versions of the 20th Anniversary Edition.  Get the one that's labeled ""DVD-Video, PS2 & XBox Compatible"".  You should be able to play it on any set-top DVD player and your PC's DVD drive.  And one final word:

Just as much fun as I remember. Not the most interactive game in the world but more than enough fun to pass the time in between working from home & marathon sessions of MMORPGs! Not as much fun once you've mastered them but still kinda cool to show off to the kids/neices/nephews/what-have-you when they come over.

The game makers set out to duplicate the arcade version of the game for home users and that is exactly what was accomplished.  The majority of the game play was exactly re-created for the new generation of gamers seeking a little bit of yesteryear and the way in which video games evolved.  Fortunately, with the additional versions being offered with this anniversary set, the game was well worth the purchase price.

Before you say I need a better computer do note that this was on a Core 2 Duo e6600 with a Geforce 7600GT video card.  The CD-ROM version's gameplay is much snappier, plus you get Dragon' Lair II, Space Ace, and a lot of ""Making Of"" type material on the extras disc.

Of course, after purchasing this package I was able to try my hand at two of the other great games in the series Space Ace and Dragon's Lair II.  These two are equally creative and fun (if not slightly more difficult) and are worth one's time and money especially if you're a Don Bluth fan.",1163116800,,572,4.367924528301887
1226807,5,B00000INHR,"Directed by Don Bluth, DRAGON'S LAIR was the first video game to use regular cell animation and the first to offer a gamer a series of options during game play.  Bluth was a famed animator that had gotten tired of politics at Disney and had split with the company to start his own animation company.  The company had some success with THE SECRET OF NIMH, but was still struggling.  In hopes of reaping financial rewards to booster their animation offerings, Bluth and company took a gamble and entered the relatively new and somewhat-unprofitable world of video games.  Despite the financial jeopardy, Bluth knew what he was doing because DRAGON'S LAIR was a mega-success.  I remember when DRAGON'S LAIR was first released.  At the time it cost double what a normal video game cost (instead of a quarter, it cost fifty cents or in some places instead of fifty cents it cost a whole dollar), but everyone wanted to play it because of the graphics and the non-standard game format.  It was like being able to actually play a movie instead of just watching one.  Video games have come a long, long way since then, but DRAGON'S LAIR remains as the father of modern day video games.

This box set includes all three of the major animated games that were produced by Don Bluth's animation company.  There's DRAGON'S LAIR, DRAGON'S LAIR II:  TIME WARP, and the unrelated title of the set SPACE AGE.  The animation remains constant throughout the games, but the difficulty in play increases between each of the games.  A person can play each of the games if they wish using the DVD remote, or they can skip the play and just watch the story that the games tell.  Included in the set are several extra features including interviews with Bluth and Co. about DRAGON'S LAIR as the prepare to release DRAGON'S LAIR 3-D, a featurette about the making of DRAGON'S LAIR (Daphne was modeled after Marilyn Monroe using Playboy magazine pictures as inspiration) archival interviews with Bluth and other co-creators, press releases, previews for other games released by Bluth's company (these weren't near as entertaining or prosperous as the animated ventures because they incorporated live actors in really, really, really cheesy plots), an episode of the television game show STARCADE in which DRAGON'S LAIR was the featured video game; and a few other random items.  I found the featurette quite interesting and the STARCADE episode was a serious blast from the past (it even includes some national commercials, such as one for a Disney record--records were cheap).  This is a great item for any fan of the original game to own, as well as collectors of pop culture history, and video game enthusiasts.",1157500800,5,2686,4.87032967032967
1226808,5,B00000INHR,"Having had experience on genuine Dragon's Lair machines from back in the early 80's, I was surprised at how close this is to the original. The scenes are the same and this edition includes scenes that were not on the original machines. You can turn the new scenes on or off, and can adjust the difficulty level of the game. The only thing that is missing is joystick support. You need to use the keyboard to operate the game, although you can adjust the keys and associated function.

The game allows itself to be copied to the hard drive, eliminating the need to keep the CD in the CD-ROM. You can run the video size at normal, double size, or full screen. On a 1024X768 monitor and using full screen I didn't notice any major video flaws or pixelization.

I have not evaluated the other two games in this CD set.

1226829,5,B00000INHR,"Well, first of all I would like to say that I read at least 50 or 60 reviews on the previous editions of Dragon's Lair, including the one review on this one, before purchasing the 20th anniversary game and playing it for myself.  After doing so, I have come to the conclusion that most, if not all of the negative reviews that I read about the previous editions of Dragons Lair would well, be very wrong about this  edition!  The game is not just ""like the original.""  It ""is the original."" right down to the scene were ""Dirk"" is in the room with the crystal ball, and the magnetic force of the mysterious throne in the room takes his hat and sword. After which, electrical impulses coming from the crystal ball begin to electrify the room and everything in it.  ""Dirk"" makes a series of moves, just like the original game and escapes.  I remember that in the arcade game in the last part of this scene up to the right of the screen, a piece of fuzz or hair was accidently printed in the film and onto the original laser disk. Well this game is not only ""the original""  as far as scene sequence and correct timing, but the same fuzz or hair is on this game as well. Needless to say, I was very relieved that in the CD-ROM version of Dragons Lair 20th Anniversary edition, which has the three games in one. That they didn't take something that wasn't broken in the first place, and try to fix it, or make it better.  ""Just like an expensive Disney animated cartoon production."" All three games are as they were in it's original form and play as if you were playing the actual games in the arcade, just without the quarters. ""Nothing added, Nothing taken away."" Now they do have a section of the CD-ROM where you can see some of the scenes that were on the drawing board and can select to play those scenes with the original game if you wish.

For those of you negative reviewers out there let me say this.  You say that the controls are not very responsive.  You say that the game drags or you die even when you make the right  move. I say this to you, ""not with this edition."" The controls are so simple: up, down, left, right, sword and they have exactly the same response as the arcade game; however you not only have to know which button to push, but ""When.""  Hidden in the code of the game there are certain grunts, yipes, groans, or flashes that are your ""Q"" for pressing the right button.  As far as the game dragging, You must also realize that you can't play this game on some old out dated computer.  Make sure that your operating system meets all of the requirements.  Mine does. This is my review. ""This game is the ""Exact game"" I played 23 years ago in the arcade. They simply took the original laser disk, duplicated it in it's entirety and formatted it for PC operating systems. I would give it a 10 star rating, but I'll give it the most it allows. 5 stars.",1154563200,22,2872,4.310408921933085

I got the Dragon's Lair 20th Anniversary Edition, which includes Dragon's Lair, Space Ace, and Dragon's Lair II - Time Warp and I couldn't be happier.  The game still looks and plays great.  The games run right from the CD Roms, no installation required.  Plus, the bonus CD with documentaries, the Dragon's Lair Starcade episode, and such is a great nostalgic treat.

1226831,4,B00000INHR,"...A fantasy adventure where you become a valiant knight on a quest to rescue the fair princess from the clutches of an evil dragon.
Yes, today that would be an overused plot. Yes, it's not very interactive. But keep in mind - the game is almost 20 years old - it made its arcade debut in 1983. It made jaws drop (especially mine - seeing it in 84 as a 4 year old - hey a cartoon! It's a GAME?) - amazing animation - and you CONTROLLED it! Of course, it's a watch the video press a button game - some newer games today even use a similar control sequence.
Anyone who remembers this game should buy this - anyone who doesn't - rent it from a Blockbuster (it's usually in the Playstation 2 section) and give it a whirl once. You'll likely want it in your collection - even if it's just so you have a ""DVD that's actually a game"". As the other reviews state - it's a riot at parties, especially if you have parties with nostalgic arcade-goers who remember the game well ;-)
Why'd I rate it a 4-star? Because on many DVD players, you'll get 'pauses' every so often - something of a hardware limitation, however.
As always, read the other reviews before making your final decision. After all, I'm biased (Now if only I could remember how to pass that one level!)",1034208000,,1257,4.285714285714286

1226833,5,B00000INHR,"Anyone in their mid 20's will remember this game. Some more fondly then others. And I don't mean that in a bad way.  But a lot of us lost all our allowence trying to get Derk to save the princess.  I frown when I try and imagine exactly how many dollars I spent doing just that. Anybody who was in arcades in the 80's either played this game, or watched people play this game. The graphics were light years ahead of their time, the concept was stunning! For as simple as it was, it ate huges ammounts of mine, and a lot of other peoples quarters. Back then, I was just never that good at it, and all it is, is a game of memory right? I had played the original PC version, it was on floppy discs. It had good graphics and the animation was great, but it wasn't the arcade experince. I was VERY happy [to say the least] when I saw it on DVD. Almost 20 years after my inital encounter I was still impressed. While not as awestruck, it brought back childhood memories of extreme frustration from playing it, but still wanting to find more quarters to plop down. Once you get the pattern down, this game is a snap. There's not much to it, and to boot it's a very short game. To beat it takes all of what? 15 minutes. But it's still good good goodness! It's a perfect game to pull out every 6 months to see if you remember the pattern. The animation is so wonderful to watch. Not many things, especially video games can stand the test of time like Dragons Lair has done. And the DVD is a perfect translation of one of the greatest arcade games ever! I can't recommend this highly enough, if you remember it from the arcade BUY IT. If you're too young, BUY IT any ways, you will be pleasently surprised",999302400,5,1695,4.196319018404908
1226834,5,B00000INHR,"OK, let's start by mentioning that there are TWO versions of this DVD.  There is a DVD-ROM version which requires Windows 95/98 to run, and there is THIS version (called DVD-VIDEO) which does NOT require a computer to run.  Both versions are manufactured by Digital Leisure.
Here is the scoop on both versions...
DVD-ROM version:
 -Requires Windows 95/98 to run. (I don't know if it will work with Windows 2000 or Windows Me)
 -Has smoother game play.  From what I have heard from other people, the game play on this version is practically flawless.
 -I don't think that this version has the ""watch"" feature, which lets you view the entire animation without actually playing the game.
 -I think that this has random game play.  If you remember the arcade version, the scenes were always played in a random order.

DVD-VIDEO Version:
 -Does NOT require a computer to run.
 -When I use this on my Sony DVD player that is hooked to my TV, the game play is painful.  There are 2-3 second gaps between moves that makes the game almost unbearable.  However, when I play this on my computer's DVD drive, the game play is quite good.  There are still gaps between moves, but only about 1/4 of a second or so.
 -Has a ""watch"" feature that lets you view the entire animation without playing it.  This is very cool!
 -Works on MOST DVD players, except some Toshiba models.
 -No random game play.  You must play the game sequentially.

WHY I BOUGHT THIS VERSION:
 Even though the game play is better on the DVD-ROM version, I decided to buy the DVD-VIDEO version for a couple of reasons...
 -The ""watch"" feature was important to me.  I wanted the ability to just sit back and take in the whole beautiful animation without having to do sword, left, left, sword, etc.
 -I wanted this purchase to last.  In other words, I didn't want to be forced to buy a new version of this product when I switch my computer system over to Windows 2000 (or whatever Bill Gates comes up with next).

ABOUT THE ACTUAL GAME:
 What can I say???  This game is an arcade classic, and a personal all-time favorite of mine.  The images on the DVD look EXACTLY like they did in the arcade.  I can not tell any difference.  It is awesome, and I love it!!!",992390400,31,2215,4.517676767676767

Most Samsung players, some Pioneer, Grundig and Philips models are incompatible, and will not allow you to play this as a game. There is only the game animation to 'watch' (it is not long, when you see it- and each scene is repeated once in reverse image- so it's half as long as it says in actuality) and some poor quality interviews to warrent the purchase of this DVD. Don't spend a lot of money thinking it will work, unless you know it will work on YOUR machine. It was a blast from the past- but NOT worth the money, when you consider what you get, if you own one of the many DVD players it will not play on.

If you have no idea what this game  is about, I'm pretty sure you'll hate it, given the dated technique used  for the graphics.
I rate this game 4/5 because the 'extra features' are a  little too repetitive. (same author's comments, over and over...)
I loved  it in 1983, and loving it again :)",965088000,2,558,4.411764705882353
1226838,5,B00000INHR,"The DVD version of this game is the best version yet.  The transfer looks  fantastic, and (depending on your DVD player) it can move faster and more  smoothly than the original arcade version.
For the aggrevated people who  felt cheated because they couldn't figure out when and how to make the  moves, this version also has a hint icon so you can perfect your timing.",964569600,5,368,4.6

It does have a few glitches with the play station version, plays better on a standard DVD Player. Definitely worth playing again at home :-)",1498867200,,253,4.7727272727272725

7911181,5,B00000INHR,"I'm surprised how good of condition it is in. Bought this used for under a dollar just so I can get a legal rip for the Daphne emulator. The DVD plays great on my DVD and Blu-Ray players. This version isn't the enhanced version but it plays in full 1080p wide screen with no stretching. The features aren't much different than CD collection for the PC but it's really nice to have the full game that will work on anything that plays a DVD.

I have to give the supplier a 10/10 on condition and shipment. Tracking was a issue but that was on USPS (They apparently were having site issues at the time). Still I'm very pleased. :)",1474848000,,627,4.26890756302521
