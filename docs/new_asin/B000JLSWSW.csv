8151758,5,B000JLSWSW,"I have worn out 3 VHS tapes of this concert video since the early 1990s, and have been wanting to have it on DVD since I got my first DVD player, but it is a rare find in the USA and often an expensive one too! Finally was able to get it at a decent price on here. I have many concert videos of Yngwie, and this is by far my favorite one. Track listing is easy enough to look up so I won't get into that here, but it also includes a pretty good interview with Yngwie from 2006. One other thing I will mention that others haven't yet is that apparently this DVD is coded for Region 2, which is Japan, Europe, South Africa, and the Middle East. This means that unless you live in one of those places you will need a region-free DVD player to play this video. Fortunately I have such a DVD player and it is the only player of mine the disc would work in.",1441411200,,851,3.953488372093023
8151759,5,B000JLSWSW,I'm surprised that there aren't any more reviews on this.. Alcatrazz and this should be in everyone's collection...as well as the net 10 years footage you can grab.,1297814400,,164,4.892857142857143
8151760,4,B000JLSWSW,"As I said , it's yngwie at nearly his best. Music from his first 2 solo
albums and a few from his Alcatraz days. Good guitar solo because it's
not too overwelming and his choice of songs are good. And it's with his
first singer which was also good. Excellent buy .",1201219200,,264,4.096153846153846
