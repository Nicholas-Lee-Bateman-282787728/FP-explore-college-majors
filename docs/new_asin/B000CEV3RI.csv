2460442,1,B000CEV3RI,"One would think that Fangoria editor Michael Gingold would have seen enough crappy horror movies to know when he was contributing to the problem, but Shadow: Dead Riot stands as testament to the opposite. It's a good thing that a healthy fraction of the horror fan population seems to relish any movie with bare breasts, gore, and heavy metal tunes, because those are the only people who will give this picture's investors a return on their money.

Skip this flick and go with one of the half-dozen GOOD zombie movies released in the last ten years: 28 Days Later, Dawn of the Dead, something else besides this.",1146787200,4,611,4.710280373831775
2460443,3,B000CEV3RI,"There are shelves full of horror films superior to this one. It is not even in the same category as 28 Days Later, for example, and barely allowable on a list including the low budget 2000 Maniacs. That said, Shadow: Dead Riot nevertheless is better than one might expect. It has a watchable mix of mayhem, sleaze, and dark humor. If much of the cast seems plucked off a Jerry Springer Show, this is appropriate for the inmates of the run-down women's prison in which nearly the entire action takes place. Carla Greene makes her rough-edged character Solitaire sympathetic enough to build suspense when she is put in danger. Most horror fans will find this movie sufficiently entertaining.",1144886400,6,689,4.8474576271186445
2460444,1,B000CEV3RI,"Well, you'd think this had the makings of a cult classic ala ""Manos"" or ""Plan 9""...they've even advertised martial arts. How can you go wrong with all these elements? Oh yeah, don't write any type of script, get the worst actors you can possibly find (even Tony's horrible in this) and shoot the whole mess on video. This movie is so awful it can't even be enjoyed in that ""Mystery Science Theater 3000"" way.

""Shadow: Dead Riot"" is, hand's down, the worst movie I've seen in a decade. Stay very far away from this. I'd give it a zero rating if allowed.",1144454400,5,553,4.421568627450981
2460445,5,B000CEV3RI,"Well, I had watched the trailer for this film on the Anthropaphagus DVD, and to tell you the truth it looked weak.  Needless to say, I went to the store today to check out the new releases.  I had already four movies picked out,a nd needed one more.  So I went back to the horror section and happened to see this one, the packaging caught my attention, plus it was really cheap.  I looked at the cover and immediately recognized it from the trailer I had watched.  I tought it was going to suck, but I bought it anyway not expecting much.  I watched it tonight and man it surprised the hell out of me.  It was pretty entertaining if you like horror movies.  I don't think there was any boring part to it.  It definetely delivered.  Plenty of naked girls, plenty of blood and gore, and even some zombies.  I will admit this movie surprised me and turned out a lot better than I had anticipated, I'm glad I bought it out of impulse.  If you like horror movies, then give this one a try. I redeemed myself with this one after having bought Anthrapophagus, that was a let down.",1143590400,19,1073,4.2835820895522385

  Some pretty starge death scenes all very origal.

  Well if ya like Good Gore and just being entertained bu all means  check it out.",1141516800,11,369,4.484848484848484
2460447,5,B000CEV3RI,"The film begins with Tony Todd as Shadow in prison awaiting to be put to death for countless crimes of murder and rape. His teeth are honed into points. During his execution some supernatural stuff happens and a prison riot ensues. Todd and the corpses of his inmates are place in a mass grave....

We now flash forward 20 years to the present. It is now a woman's prison complete with a sadistic lesbian guard (Andrea Langi), shower scene, horny doctor and the new tough girl, Solitaire. Solitaire ends up in solitaire where she touches a carving in the floor made by Todd. She has visions of the ghastly images of his crimes including the torture and killing of a pregnant woman. Misty Mundae (credited as Erin Brown) plays Crystal, the prison girlfriend of Mondo, Solitaire's nemesis.

When blood is spilled on the ground where Todd is buried...all zombie hell breaks loose.

occasional f-bomb, minor sex, lesbian themes, full frontal nudity (only when tasteful and necessary for the plot), girls with tramp stamps, a baby from ""It's Alive"" (they wanted to make sure everything was covered) excessive blood and gore. Grindhouse cult classic. Deleted scenes include tasteful extended shower scenes. Not for everyone. A Misty Mundae prison girl zombie film, a must for discriminating collectors.",1313020800,4,1296,5.018604651162791
2460448,5,B000CEV3RI,I'm a big Tony Todd and horror fan and I seen this movie when it first came out.  I really enjoyed it.  Especially since it is a low budget movie.  Not a lot of good one but this is one.  Special effect are done very well along with story line.  I give it 5 zombie stars for the money.,1297296000,2,285,3.76271186440678
2460449,5,B000CEV3RI,"I'm straight with this one. Tony todd is in this one, he really played a damn good role in this one! Out of sight! And that fine female,""salitare"", she really know how to kick butt! And on top of that, she is fine! Gotta give this one a play, five stars that is! Thanks Amazon for this movie, because i couldn't find this one at Best Buy!

2460450,5,B000CEV3RI,it is a good movie I purchased it a long time ago and didn't finish it and then couldn't find. I needed to see the ending. Just know that it is a good movie typical for its time.,1268697600,,178,3.710526315789474
2460451,2,B000CEV3RI,"This movie is OK. If you like the women in prison exploxiation movies then if kind of your cup of tea. If your a zombie lover might go wrong. You can sum up this movie with chicks in jail,that know some martial arts and Tony Todd the master of rising the dead. There are some good gore effects. There one scene is worht the watch. I would say red box. But its definitely not worth buying. Even Tony Todd couldn't say this film.",1247011200,,427,4.156626506024097
2460452,5,B000CEV3RI,"New from Media Blasters on BD and a decent (neo-'grindhouse'style) film. It's lmpressingly low budget, below the belt entertainment that should satisfy anyone who insists on purity of slease. Actually, better done than its production style seems, even when it gets crazy. Moments of cheesy gore will please many but confound those looking for redeeming qualities. Actually has a decent weird soundtrack and the A/V quality is great for what it is. It does what it intends to do. Your Blu-ray collection look a little too Hollywood? Go for it; your collection could use some trash.",1233878400,7,580,5.052083333333333

2460454,1,B000CEV3RI,"I bought it only because (Candy Man) was in it and I thought it would be a great movie. Boy was I wrong. There is plenty of pretty women in it, but the acting......I could have been in this movie and won an oscar. Even when the ""heads"" was rolling off the bodies it looked really fake. WWE does a better way of acting then these people. Don't waste you money and wait until it comes on the SciFi channel, then change the channel to the something else.",1202256000,2,451,4.136363636363637
2460455,2,B000CEV3RI,"I really think that this was made INTENTIONALLY bad! It must fall under the category of ""so bad its good."" A title bestowed upon classic B movie  cheesey ragu sauce like ""Plan 9 From Outer Space."" Ok so this is no Plan 9  but anything with zombies and Tony todd in the same sentence should be at least DECENT?? NOT SO! Despite having the usually good Tony Todd (Candyman, Night of the living dead remake ) and Tony Leung ( martial arts stunman to Bruce Lee and expert martial arts master hissdamnself ) this is pretty terrible. It is more of an exploitation horror flick, a very cheesy one at that, that has plenty of girl on girl sex and gore. The acting is terrible, and even the stunts are pretty low rate. This is surprising since Tony Leung is a master of the form. The budget they had making this must have been next to nothing. Besides some cool lesbian soft core and a few deent kicks and punches, this is the worst horror movie I've seen in awhile! It incorporates zombies into the already really corny mix of occult and soft core porn. I think this had zombies solely because of Tony Todd, a ""zombie flick"" alumnus. Better than ""Day of the Dead 2"" but will this go down in the annals of a ""Candyman"" or ""Night of the Living Dead?"" Uhhhh, no! the placement of zombies is just a ploy to get Romero fans and general fans of horror to watch this. It comes off more as reason to touch oneself with ya frat buddies! Really bad and only if you MUST go so low at least absorb the cheese factor for all its worth.",1163721600,2,1514,4.253472222222222
2460456,1,B000CEV3RI,"How could director Derek Wan have possibly screwed this one up?

I mean, yes, it was almost certainly going to be campy, mixing in zombies with pretty girls behind bars, but campy is supposed to be fun, isn't it?  This movie is NOT fun.  It's stupid and uninteresting.

Margaret Baker was very well cast as a predatory lesbian guard who sets her sights on pretty female inmates like Misty Mundae and Ruby Larocca.  But aside from some brief conversation, nothing ever happens!  There's not one halfway decent girls-molesting-other-girls scene in this entire film!  Obviously the decision was made to get right to the stupid zombies instead.

What a disappointing dud!",1149120000,4,667,5.0
8098264,5,B000CEV3RI,"This is just for those who are looking for something fun. It begins quickly with a prison massacre shootout that sets the pace for what's going to be a fast-paced, gory and fun flick with lots of violence and nudity. Most of the film takes place indoors at a women's prison with only some parts here and there moving outside to the prison yard. This is just a picture consisting of violence, gore, full nudity and action which is the only reason for it being made. There's nothing complicated about this whatsoever. It's just Tony Todd, who plays an executed felon, returning from the dead with his army of zombies to slaughter the inmates. If you're buying it for great directing, atmosphere, suspense, acting, nice scenery and a good story then don't bother. There's stuff here like this: a monster baby biting a nipple off; a girl being dragged to safety by her friends after her guts have been pulled out; there's prison fighting and lots of gun blasting; plenty of full nudity is here, which is what a fun flick like this should have; a hot nude women in the shower having her boobs fondled by a zombie which then kills her, so she returns as fully nude zombie; and it's just fast-paced and fun with good soundtracks and a gory high body count. I wasn't looking for anything except an exploitive splatter film when I bought it, so it gave me what I wanted.

The quality is excellent, and there's good extras as well. The menu screen has animation with music. However, my Blu-ray disc froze and skipped a bit in a couple of places on my Samsung Blu-ray player. I bought it really cheap and new from a seller, so I didn't bother returning it. This happened with my FLESH FOR THE BEAST Blu-ray as well, which is also from Shriek Show. Some other DVDs that I bought from Shriek Show also had some problems. Those Shriek Show discs sometimes have some problems with defects, or they have some compatibility issues with certain players.
UPDATE
I now tried it on a Sony BDP S3700 Blu-ray player that I bought, and it still freezes. In fact, my disc seems to have gotten more defective. It's skipping more on both players and has gotten worse.",1488499200,3,2140,4.544041450777202

DEAD RIOT

If ever there was a movie that I was going to enjoy it was this one. When this was getting ready to be released I saw an ad for it in an issue of Fangoria. Seeing Tony Todd was in it I had to have it. So when it was released I had to pick it up. So I took it over to my brothers after picking up a homie and we three sat back and enjoyed. What we got was a great bad movie full of women, zombies, voodoo and violence, everything we could ask for in a B movie.

A man is set to be executed at a prison for his vicious killings. This man dabbled in voodoo and was a serial killer. But when things go down something goes wrong, the man is executed of course but his blood infects the prisoners and a zombie horde is born. Years later the prison is now a womens prison and a new inmate is a little more than see seems. It doesnt take long before the prisons secrets and sins resurface.

This movie is hilarious from the start with the quality of some of the acting, straight laughable. I won't point any out because you have to see for yourself. Of course Todd is excellent and his character is a really interesting one. Then of course we have the plot which is just too sweet, a womens prison exploitation flick with zombies and voodoo, I love it. Of course the nudity is there for those wondering, yes you get that as well.

The unrated Blu-Ray comes with a commentary featuring the cast and crew as well as behind the scenes featurettes and a music video among other things. This is a fun flick that is either really bad or good because of it depending on your taste. We loved it and were laughing the whole time. I say check it out if you get the chance especially if you like these types of flicks.",1430265600,,1717,4.071005917159764
8098270,4,B000CEV3RI,"Crazy stuff here. Fun yet it could've/should've been so much better. The lead actress just sucked. She was pretty, but can't act a lick. Everytime it started getting good and veering into horror, it would click to zombies and kung-fu. Still enjoyable, but could've been so much more. Tony Todd is awesome as always, wish his role was bigger.",1428883200,2,341,4.796610169491525
8098271,3,B000CEV3RI,"This movie isn't too terrible.  I think if anything it is a bit too cliche.

 It is borderline supercheez and covers many genre movies just thrown into a blender and yeah, you have this movie...

 Part Hong Kong action/martial arts - right down to the talc flying when they land a punch.  Part zombie flick, Part women in prison flick... with a dash of Re-animator; especially ""Beyond Re-animator"".

 If you enjoy exploitation action flicks, this film should suit you.  It doesn't cover any really new territory, just gives you a hyper reality women in prison movie.",1404691200,,566,4.8125
