8632954,4,B00HHYGFJW,"The latest film from Killerwolf Films is a return to the high octane action that they have been known for. Ninja deals with revenge and trying to save a little girl who was taken captive by a ninja sect. The film opens with a team of ninjas wiping out what appears to be a high ranking mobster's family and their bodyguards. One of the ninjas (played by Renee Porada) balks when they are ordered to kill the children. The rest of the team (led by Darian Caine) turns on Renee and leaves her for dead. Instead of killing all of the children they take 1 of them with them. Renee is found by mobster Lanny Poffo and his team (consisting of Brian Anthony and Leon South, a/k/a Len Kabasinski). Lanny decides to not kill Renee and instead to use her to find the ninja sect and free the little girl. The film continues on with the 2 parties having different and possibly competing agendas. Renee wants revenge and Brian and Leon want to save the girl. The film is chock full of gun play and martial arts action. The cast is well rounded with KWF regulars Deanne Visalle and KK Ryder in it. One major issue is that there is some sound problems and the director (due to being rushed by the distributor) was unable to fix it. It's not a big problem and if you are a fan of KWF you'll probably not notice it.",1398643200,3,1298,4.280487804878049
