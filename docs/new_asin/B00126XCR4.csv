Hollow Man 2? Yes, I suppose it's a bonus - if you're related to anyone in the film. Otherwise, it's junk.

3077924,5,B00126XCR4,"Kevin Bacon is the show (sometimes we forget how very very good he is) in the first of these and his performance makes the movie rise above it's 'B' origins.  He is fascinating to watch and really cuts his teeth on his fellow actors feeding into his descent into madness.  This is a classic on a par with Claude Rains' magnificent original Invisible Man.  Paul Verhoeven has been a hit or miss director his whole career...but when he hits he hits and this one proves it beyond a shadow of a doubt.  But then there is no shadow...is there....and certainly no doubt that this is a great movie. Five Stars

Christian Slater (a much underrated actor) carries the sequel with aplomb but the script keeps him from attaining Bacon's acidity and the story becomes a Verhoeven action wanderer rather than a focus on character and story (mostly misses when he does this).  It's good but not great.  Yet Slater is always fascinating to watch and he does what he does within the confines of this story and direction with his usual unique take on things.  I enjoyed it.  Three Stars for the movie - Four Stars for Slater's work here.

Having them both on the same blu-ray with upgraded sound and picture that looks great is a plus.  Having zero extras is a bummer for some but I don't think I've ever watched an extra on any blu-ray I own and I own 1285 of them as of this writing.  I have approximately 15 to 20 years of life left at the outside and I want to fill it with the entertainment movies offer without shattering my suspension of belief by learning how the craftsmen go about their work.  But that's just me and I know there are those who live for the extras so be warned.

USA
Director: Paul Verhoeven
Writers: Gary Scott Thompson - story, Andrew W. Marlowe - story
Stars: Elisabeth Shue, Kevin Bacon, Josh Brolin

Twice as much Hollow Man and a decent price.  The first Hollow Man is worth the price alone, and it's just as well since the second Hollow isn't on the same level.  Hollow Man is a new take on the invisible man story.  The special effects are far better.  Kevin Bacon and Elisabeth Shue are great.  Bacon plays the scientist that becomes invisible and crazy in the process.  Well worth seeing and owning for this price under $8.

Canada
Director: Claudio F&auml;h
Writers: Gary Scott Thompson, Andrew W. Marlowe
Stars: Christian Slater, Peter Facinelli, Laura Regan

Christian Slater plays a soldier that is used in an experimant and once he becomes invisible, like Bacon in the first Hollow, he goes off the deep end.  He hunts those responsible to kill them.  Decent but no where near as good as the first Hollow.

After all these years since Claude Rains went wacky when he became invisible you'd think they would learn.
