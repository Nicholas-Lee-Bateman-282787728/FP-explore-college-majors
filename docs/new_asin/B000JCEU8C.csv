Please don't waste your money on these.

I returned them to Amazon and they only gave me $1.02 credit on them.",1235001600,,324,4.03125
8149883,3,B000JCEU8C,"This DVD collection contains two three-DVD sets, John Wayne - The Early Years and John Wayne 20 Movie Pack.  The Early Years contains three 12-episode B&W features from the early 1930's.  The 20 Movie Pack contains B&W movies from the 1930's, a 1963 color movie, and a 1971 feature length color documentary ""The American West of John Ford"".  As one might expect, the B&W episode and movie audio is noisy and subpar by current standards, but the entire collection gives an idea of the development of the motion picture technology and the character of John Wayne.  The collection is of historical value for this reason and is more than just entertainment.",1202169600,6,653,4.8558558558558556

The ULTIMATE JOHN WAYNE COLLECTION is quite comprehensive, and a must-have for all fans of Duke.
