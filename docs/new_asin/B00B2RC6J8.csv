5553242,5,B00B2RC6J8,I first saw this on PBS.  It's an eye opening look at the struggle of the Episcopal church and their views on gays!  Very proud of the Episcopal Church!,1373932800,2,152,4.206896551724138
5553243,5,B00B2RC6J8,"Bishop Gene was the first bishop in modern times to be truthful about his orientation while enthroned. His enthronement as 9th Episcopal bishop of New Hampshire was the beginning of a long debate over the inclusion of gay people in church sacraments. If you are opposed or indifferent about the issue, this documentary may change that. You will be moved by Bishop Gene's tears, anxieties, and frustrations as he breaks new ground and perseveres in faith.",1369785600,2,454,4.9868421052631575
5553244,5,B00B2RC6J8,"I've read about this Bishop some years ago, but this documental gave me more info about him and how open-minded Episcopal Church has become regarding LGTB rights and acceptance as equal members of their community. If I still were Christian, I would become Episcopal.",1368316800,,266,5.068181818181818
5553245,5,B00B2RC6J8,"I enjoyed this film tremendously.  It is a sensitive look at a controversial subject.  In my ""straight"" world, I appreciated gaining a deeper understanding of how beautiful love is between two people,  I was inspired by Gene Robinson's courage and positiveness.  Kudos on relaying his message.",1366416000,,293,5.304347826086956
5553246,5,B00B2RC6J8,"Whether you agree or disagree, the essence of this film is the effect  how many people are affected by one man's decision. Not only the principle character but everyone involved in his world.  Watch this film with your parishioners and discuss.  A great topic for Bible study.",1366329600,,276,4.829787234042553
5553247,3,B00B2RC6J8,This documentary is fairly informative and is worthwhile watching. It is however not a groundbraking film that lingers on in your mind hours after you have seen it.,1365984000,,164,4.892857142857143
8561608,5,B00B2RC6J8,"A bold and thoughtful story, with poignant and tragic edges.  Truth will out.",1426204800,,77,4.923076923076923
8561609,5,B00B2RC6J8,Was great to watch and educational as well!!!!,1425427200,,46,4.875
8561610,4,B00B2RC6J8,Great story about Gene Robinson' s decision to come out as a gay man who was in a leadership role in the Episcopal Church.  The support and also lack of support by the lay members of the church are profiled as is the harsh treatment by much of the international church leadership.  Gene's personal relationship with his husband is also presented.,1417046400,,346,4.655737704918033
8561611,1,B00B2RC6J8,"A great documentary takes a fair look and gives equal time to varying viewpoints that exist in a discussion, topic or debate. A biased documentary one-sides the discussion without fairly considering the other side, or fairly representing that other side with equal playtime. This documentary is quite clearly the latter, and will do little to settle the debate on homosexuality and the church.

What is missing from this documentary is the pain that has occurred within the denomination over not only the ordination of Gene Robinson, but the passing of the measures at General Convention near the end of the documentary. A record number of priests and bishops have been defrocked (many of whom were defrocked before they could consider leaving TEC), numerous properties have been seized, $40 million of the church's funds have been dedicated to lawsuits, and more than a quarter of TEC's membership has left (in 2014 TEC's attendance records showed a 2.5% decline from 2013). The Diocese of New Hampshire shrank during Robinson's tenure. Furthermore, the only growing diocese was South Carolina (one of the few remaining conservative strongholds which left this last year).

What is also missing is a fair perspective from the conservative side on this matter (with less than three minutes of personal perspective given to such individuals). There was a poor representation of Archbishop Bob Duncan. The creation of the ACNA was not made in the way put forward. Furthermore, the ACNA invited Rick Warren, but it did not need or seek ""inspiration"" from him.

Bias does not make for a good documentary. It makes for a bad documentary that is not willing to be transparent and honest about what goes on. Really, it becomes an advocacy film, and not a documentary, and that's exactly what this film is... an advocacy film.",1416268800,,1818,5.053333333333334
8561612,5,B00B2RC6J8,It met my expectations,1407628800,,22,4.75
8561613,5,B00B2RC6J8,Very useful to bring unchurched LGBTQ people to a place where they might accept and perhaps even trust some church people.,1401667200,,122,4.857142857142857
8561614,5,B00B2RC6J8,This is a very compelling chronicle of events concerning the first openly gay Bishop in the Episcopal Church. It is well done.  It should be helpful in combating the ignorance of some clergy attacks on the LGBT community.  One cannot help but respect Bishop Gene Robinson for his courage in the face of obvious persecution.,1392768000,,323,4.8545454545454545
8561615,5,B00B2RC6J8,"I have been a admirer of Gene Robinson for a few years. When I heard of this documentary, I looked high and low to find it. I not only have more respect for Bishop Robinson, but also for the American Episcopal church. There courage to ""be on the right side of Justice"" with this issue  was a powerful witness.

For those who says the marriage equality goes against scripture teaching. Scripture also supports slavery, polegomy, stoning those caught in adultry (female only) and other unevolved issues.  Marriage is about Love... not genitalia.",1391731200,,543,4.880434782608695
8561616,5,B00B2RC6J8,"This movie was very well done.  It gives excellent background on Bishop Robinson, and all he has had to deal with.  Highly recommended.",1379635200,,135,4.826086956521739
8561617,5,B00B2RC6J8,"I am a yankee myself and so I know that Gene Robinson must have had excellent qualities for the people of N.H. to put him up to be Bishop. The story that this documentary tells is how hard it was for him and his partner to weather the storm that followed them both while he was Bishop. He blazed the trail and now there will be others to follow, and it hopefully won't be as difficult for them.",1374883200,2,394,4.064102564102564
