8388025,1,B0033PSH3G,May be ok for someone who has never done any yoga. But it is S-L-O-W AND B-O-R-I-N-G! I don't recommend it.,1527638400,,107,4.142857142857143
8388026,4,B0033PSH3G,"This was the perfect video for my 88 year old mother.  She has severe arthritis as well as neuropathy. She ha  very little strength, can barely walk with her walker, and is 98 percent sedentary.  I set up her chair very close to the tv and she attempts to do the exercises.  She  tries everything to the best of her ability.  It improves her sense of accomplishment as well as gets her to actually stretch and flex muscles.  It has been a real blessing to her.  She told me yesterday she keeps rembering that Patricia says to ""relax"" so that's what she is doing.

The tape material is great but the quality is amature, however, we will play it in our home at least three times a week.  It has been a great choice for Mom.",1400889600,4,721,4.235294117647059

it works well for our 'Mature' group.",1361491200,5,158,4.642857142857143
8388028,5,B0033PSH3G,"Patricia's chair yoga dvd is excellent. I received this three weeks ago from Amazon and have been doing it every morning with my wife. I am 72 years old and my wife is a young 70. I find the clear instructions easy to follow and the exercises are not too strenuous for a beginner. I feel better already with more energy and improved strength and balance. I hope to move on to level two soon!

 I highly recommend this dvd",1307577600,8,421,4.25
8388029,4,B0033PSH3G,"This video isn't bad. It kind of looks like a home video, but the practice is good. I am a yoga teacher and I bought this as an educational tool for a chair yoga training I'm taking. I found the content useful.",1270166400,11,210,4.023809523809524
