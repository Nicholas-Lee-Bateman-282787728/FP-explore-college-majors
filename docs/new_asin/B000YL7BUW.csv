8233398,5,B000YL7BUW,"I love this movie. It reminds me of Julio Cortazar's fictions, especially Hopscotch. It's about an apathetic guy, Claude Ridder, who can't decide whether he wants to live or die. He tries to commit sucide, sorta, But he survives. Since he has lost the will to live he is recruited to serve as guinea pig in a very sketchy high-risk time travel experiment (the scientists figure if he dies no one will care, least of all Claude). Claude is drugged (to reduce the stress of time travel) and placed on a very comfortable bean bag chair inside an organic pod and sent back in time to re-live one minute of his past. But the expereiment goes wrong and instead he hops around in time reliving a whole slew of ""random"" moments (it is uncertain whether the moments he relives are entirely random or in some way selected by Claude himself). It's a clever storytelling technique as we get to put Claude's life together piece by piece as he relives it. And I suppose that is what happens for Claude as well, he pieces his life back together as he relives it. Whether he feels any better about that life as he puts together its pieces is uncertain, but he does seem to undergo some kind of change....as he does seem to care whether he will spend eternity re-living his life moment by moment or whether the scientists will find a way to retrieve him. The film is ultimately a clever metaphor for the way we spend our lives mulling over our lives. Claude is somewhat like Proust, he does seem to enjoy or savor life more in the re-livingrecapturing of the past but unlike Proust he is a mere passive subject as opposed to an active creator and this is perhaps the main flaw in his character. Claude surrounded himself with art (each time he hopscotches to another moment in his past we see books and postcards and art images everywhere) but we never see him doing anything creative himself. And this perhaps explains his particular sociopathology, his apathy. Throughout his voyages he is involved in a romance with another apathetic/parasitic soul and we follow this romance from start to finish but whether they are good or bad for each other is one of the more interesting questions raised by this very interesting film.",1437782400,,2209,4.6091370558375635
