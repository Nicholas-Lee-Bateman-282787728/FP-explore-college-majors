7912182,4,B00000JGDZ,I have read almost all of Danielle Steel's books and have like them all.  There have been times when I thought she was too raw in her language but as a whole I have really enjoyed reading most of the books she has written.  I think she has handled most of the subjects she has used very well and most of the time I have found I couldn't wait until I could on reading her book.,1359417600,,376,3.9342105263157894

They wear the most fantastic clothes and furs, they drink out of the most special china cups...they really spent so much money making sure that every i was dotted and every t was crossed to make this movie so very real looking...and then the actors are so pretty and they do a fine job of acting and it's just glorious to watch this show. One of my favorite movies! I wish it would come out on dvd!!  Sue in VA",1097020800,,573,4.305555555555555

Edwina Winfield (Kelly Rutherford), the eldest daughter of a wealthy newspaper dynasty, is travelling home on the Titanic with her family and her fiancee.
The Winfields toast her engagement and the sixth birthday of her sister Alexis.  But fate deals Edwina a horrible blow when her parents and fiancee go down with the ship.
Edwina tries to re-build her life and the lives of her younger siblings, while Alexis turns against the family and becomes a teenage delinquint.
For 12 years Edwina puts her romantic life on hold, while she raises her siblings, but on a trip across the Atlantic to rescue a wayward Alexis, she discovers she cannot keep romance at bay, and has an affair with a dashing Englishman, Patrick (Simon MacCorkindale).  When Alexis is found, Edwina returns home to marry theatrical producer Sam Horowitz (Chris Sarandon).
At last, Edwina is free from the ghosts of that fateful night on the Titanic.
Romantic, dramatic and very well played out, NO GREATER LOVE is one of the best Danielle Steel movies ever made.",989452800,12,1188,4.935
