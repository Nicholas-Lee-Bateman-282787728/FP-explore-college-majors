8198342,1,B000R17RUI,"After ordering products from Lavilla, reviews were not attached when I purchase, I read reviews that state how bad they really are.  The previous reviews were exactly what I experienced. I can't figure out why Amazon even has Lavilla as a seller on their webpage.  I plan to stop purchasing anything from Amazon.com or sellers on their site as I never received my merchandise and never received emails explaining why from Amazon or Lavilla.  I have never had problems with Amazon.com until now and never plan to use them again.",1259366400,,527,4.833333333333333

8198347,4,B000R17RUI,"If only we could all live Christian Troys life for a little while. It always seems especially appealing given the turbulent and overly emotional rumblings of the McNamara's marriage. The fourth season could be dubbed the guest stars' season. Everyone from Jacqueline Bissett to Catherine Denueve appears in the fourth season of the show. With that said, this still may be the lightest and least intriguing installment of all four season. Somehow, somewhere Nip/Tuck lost its luster. While it would be nice to live like Dr. Troy for about ten years, sooner or later, one finds new hobbies. I'm not saying don't buy the fourth season, because it was fun, but the show has lost its cutting edge appeal; thus, my conservative rating.",1189296000,3,729,4.934959349593496
