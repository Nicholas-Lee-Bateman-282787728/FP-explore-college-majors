8288800,2,B000C9U4ZA,"I'm a very big fan of the Beatles. This dvd is somewhat of a disapointment. There are 4 songs listed on the dvd box that are not on the dvd. The fool on the hill, I am the walrus, just to name a few.
Most clips are from the Ed Sullivan show. Quality of this dvd is good and bad. Be sure you want this before you order. I consider the Beatles to be the best band in rock n roll history. Long live Liverpool England!",1196899200,6,414,3.8255813953488373
