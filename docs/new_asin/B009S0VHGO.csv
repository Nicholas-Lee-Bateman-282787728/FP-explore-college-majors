5362075,5,B009S0VHGO,"A major festival award-winner at select regional film festivals, honors include BEST FEATURE at the Real to Reel Film Festival (North Carolina), BEST FEATURE at The Film Festival of Colorado, and the AUDIENCE AWARD at the Garden State Film Festival - where the film broke the ten-year box office record for paid attendance and pre-sales!  Recent festival official selections include the Prescott (Arizona) and CineVegas Film Festivals.

Our movie puts you in a dangerous place: the real threat of a terrorist attack is ever present.  You can feel it in every airport, every train station, and even at the local football game.  We are so proud of our film, and know you will love it!",1356048000,4,682,4.904347826086957
5362076,5,B009S0VHGO,"I had the pleasure of seeing ""A Dangerous Place"" at the Garden State Film Festival. Two things immediately make this film stand out from other thrillers: one, it has an underlying message about beliefs which is very positive and two, the New Jersey locations make it quite real and relevant. The story unfolds in the ""new normal"" of the 9/11 attacks. The characters are still reeling from this tragedy when life in the tri-state area is threatened once again. The action kept me on the edge of my seat, but various references to one's search for answers and what to believe in kept me thinking. My favorite line is when a character explains that our beliefs don't save us...they make us whole. ""A Dangerous Place"" is both thought-provoking and uplifting it its own unique way.",1355961600,4,776,4.7555555555555555
5362077,5,B009S0VHGO,"This is an excellent independent film that captures your attention like a large Hollywood production and it delivers the action, drama, and suspense like one too.  Most of the time I pass independent films by with barely a glance, but A Dangerous Place is a must see.  Great for friends and family alike.  Thank you for showing me this film Garden State Film Festival!",1355961600,4,368,4.71875
5362078,5,B009S0VHGO,A Dangerous Place is an exciting thriller that keeps you on the edge of your seat! Had the pleasure of seeing it at the Garden State Film Festival in March. I highly recommend this indie film.,1355961600,4,192,4.361111111111111
5362079,5,B009S0VHGO,My family and I went to see this movie at the Garden State Film Festivale.  It was very good. I especially enjoyed the ending which was exciting!,1355961600,5,145,4.37037037037037
5362080,5,B009S0VHGO,"Seen it at the Garden State Film Fest and loved it. Not your average thriller in any way, twist and turns from beginning to end.",1355875200,5,128,4.16
5362081,5,B009S0VHGO,"Incredibly entertaining, ""A Dangerous Place"" is full of action and suspense. I would highly recommend as it is one of those movies I could watch over and over again on a lazy Sunday afternoon. I originally saw this film at the Garden State Film Festival and was very impressed. The film premiered on a Saturday night and was one of the featured films at the festival. The two hours flew by and it did not disappoint.

Kristen Daulten, from the ""Departed"", has always been one of my favorite actresses and has a lead role in ""A Dangerous Place"". This movie really makes you think about life in so many different ways. There are several ongoing plots throughout the film and they all tie in beautifully at the end. While the story is based on the outbreak of a deadly virus spreading throughout the Country, the movie also chronicles a family dealing with the loss of a loved one from 9/11. The special effects and cinematography are really well done. This film is not just an action packed thriller, but provides hope and courage for so many people out there. I highly recommend.",1355875200,9,1078,4.614583333333333
5362082,4,B009S0VHGO,It's great to see movies made in the Garden State.  Also proud that I saw at the Garden State Film Festival last spring!,1355788800,5,120,4.217391304347826
5362083,5,B009S0VHGO,"As ""ADP"" isn't the average predictable, cliche thriller, it was definitely one of those few films that left you at the edge your seat, yet you really feel for, root for ""Clairice"" cause she such an underdog against a bunch a legion of secret terrorist minons, she has no one to trust but herself and her own gut instanct.  What the film really also displays is the realism to it, like there aren't any ""Hollywood"" cliche type of scenes that the general audience has grown a custom to expect, the action sequences to ""ADP"" are simply put realistic. This film is not without a great deal of dramatic sequences that have very real, human, emotional layers to it.  What makes this film so powerful tho, and I think it really strikes a chord with anyone that views it, the scary part is this can actually really happen, especially the way things are in this day and age.

  What I also really enjoyed about this movie, is that, its not at all a bite off of any other conspiracy theory/ terrorist based film genre, that's what's great about it, its something fresh, is what makes it special.  As for the film in a whole, I believe its one of the finest releases this year.
  I think this film honestly doesn't cheat or waste the audience/viewers time, the acting is very good, no cheesey pick uplines or quotes, it delievers and has quiet a lot to offer its definitely one of those films that really stands out on its own, as it gives you something alot to think about after viewing it.",1355788800,10,1480,4.455555555555556
5362084,4,B009S0VHGO,"""A Dangerous Place"" is one of those rare movies that presents a scenario so realistic that it is scary.  From beginning to it's thrilling conclusion, it has you on the edge of your seat with excitement!  Kevin Interdonato (Ross) and Kristen Dalton (Claire) play so well off of each other that I forgot that I was watching actors and rather felt like I was watching a true sociopath and a woman determined to stop the horror no matter what it costs!",1355702400,9,448,4.518518518518518

5362098,5,B009S0VHGO,"A DANGEROUS PLACE  is one of the best thrillers I've seen a quite a while.  It kept me on the edge of my seat the whole time.  Gregory Corrado did an excellent job of pulling deep emotions from the cast.  And while I played Flo, I don't think I'm being biased in my review.  Corrado Shoner Films should be proud to have produced such a great film.",1360281600,,347,4.119402985074627
5362099,5,B009S0VHGO,It was an exciting plot with an interesting twist. The movie kept you in suspense and was well paced.  I enjoyed the theme song.,1360195200,,128,4.333333333333333

5362101,1,B009S0VHGO,"These reviews are probably from the same reviewers on IMDB. These reviews appear to be a plug for films and filming in New Jersey and not real. In other words fake.
Another note concerning the bogus reviews, almost every review is from first time reviewers which were much like the ones left on the youtube trailer. On top of that the director himself left a review on this site! boxoffice.com does not even have it listed in it's archives. Heck there aren't enough copies to even sell on Amazon.

The review: ""A Frantic Place"" This straight to torrent film is indeed ""Frantic"".It is continually in a frantic search for an identity. Is it a suspense? Is it a drama? is it a feel good movie? It seems to be several ideas that could have been pursued into several stories but ended up in one. Near the end as the movie's star was fighting for her life so was this film. Character development was so fractured it became convoluted. I did view this without a preconceived notion or expectation.
In regard to the cast,crew and Director writing ""Reviews"" for this Film, I still feel it is a conflict of interest for any commenting here or any other sites by anyone other than the end user or viewer.

To the Director, thank you for your kind note. Feel free to contact me about your future projects.",1358812800,4,1293,4.521367521367521
5362102,5,B009S0VHGO,"I must say that I am a true fan of these film makers. I saw A Dangerous place a few months ago at a screening and it blew me away. This story is so cleverly written and directed, I can't wait for my copy to arrive so i can revisit it. If you haven't seen it please do yourself a favor and get a copy. The team also has another film called Murder reincarnated that stars the beautiful Izabella Miko, and this one is just as good! There needs to be more clever movies like these, I am looking forward to the next one!

5362103,5,B009S0VHGO,"I had the joy of seeing this film at the Garden State Film Festival, and I will tell you that it was quite an experience. The movie makes the clever move of establishing it's emotional side first; the story of a 9/11 widow trying to connect with her traumatized son so that they may both move forward from the death of her husband and his father. While this goes on however, the anthrax crisis unfolds, and we see the far reaches of this expand in a post 9/11 world. I remember the actual anthrax crisis quite clearly, and I followed the story long after if left the news.  Not only did this film capture the atmosphere of those days perfectly, it even managed to include elements from actual crisis's end (namely that the ""terrorists"" in question were a lot more domestic that we originally believe).

This exciting, action packed film has a tender emotional side and is definitely worth seeing. 5 out of 5!",1358035200,2,908,4.530487804878049
5362104,5,B009S0VHGO,"Not to go all Trailer Guy, but we live in a dangerous world, and this Corrado Schoner Production asks you to confront this reality by asking two simple questions: who do you trust, and more importantly, WHAT can you trust? Your friends? Your family? Your co-workers? Your instincts? In a post-9-11 environment where the news slants left or right by channel and terrorism has shattered the American shield of invulnerability, A Dangerous Place makes you go to the dark places. The places where you wonder just how far people will go to make a buck, to make a point, to make things right. And if that isn't an effective thriller, I don't know what is.

I was fortunate enough to see ADP at a sold-out screening at the Garden State Film Festival. The audience reaction was intense as the drama on screen played out-literal gasps came from the surprised, something that I haven't experienced in a movie in a long while. Solid performances from the cast aid in driving home a story that makes you wonder what the people you know are really thinking about. You really feel for the bewildered Claire (Kristen Dalton), and are left wondering just who could possibly want to do such horrific things to their neighbors. Can't wait to see where Corrado and Schoner go with their next project. Bought the DVD and can't wait to see the film again.",1357689600,2,1334,4.676595744680851

5362106,5,B009S0VHGO,"We saw A Dangerous Place at the Garden State Film Festival and soon it will be available on DVD - hope it will be available on Instant Video - will definitely rent!

The film is well written and acted with nice production values and interesting, believable locations. I live in New Jersey, so it is always cool to see places you know on-screen!",1357171200,2,344,4.4603174603174605
5362107,5,B009S0VHGO,I highly recommend this movie. Beautifully made and great acting. A must watch. This movie kept my attention and had me guessing. I like the plot and will watch it again,1357084800,2,169,4.483870967741935
5362108,5,B009S0VHGO,"I saw this movie at the Garden State Film Festival for the first time and it was a great experience. Seeing local, budding actors and actresses work alongside New Jersey filmmakers and talent was truly a rare thing. The state does not get enough credit it deserves and it's a great thing to support a homegrown indie film. For example, some of the scenes were filmed in Cranford and Newark, NJ.

Aside from supporting the New Jersey film scene, it's also really great to see a seasoned actress such as Kristen Dalton (who was Jack Nicholson's GF in The Departed!) utilize her acting talents to her fullest potential. She seemed to effortlessly mold into her role.

After meeting and getting to know all of the different people involved with ""A Dangerous Place,"" I know why the movie came out as well as it did and why it gained such widespread support in the film festival market. Everyone involved was passionate and dedicated and seeing the community it built is all the more reason to support this movie.

...and it will keep you at the edge of your seat!",1356998400,3,1058,4.617021276595745
5362109,5,B009S0VHGO,"I had the good fortune to catch this movie at a local film fest.
What a surprise it was! It's a great movie with a good plot, very interesting main characters (Kristen Dalton and Sal Rendino do a brilliant job), is suspenseful and most of all, an amazing thrill ride all the way to the end.
The phrase ""The World is A Dangerous Place, not because of the people that are evil, but because of the people that do nothing about it"" is ever so true in the society we live in now. This film tackles this question and delivers an answer.
I am an avid moviegoer and it takes a lot to impress me. This movie did.",1356739200,3,603,4.11864406779661
5362110,5,B009S0VHGO,"There seems to be an invisible war going on between the worlds of ""festival"" movies and ""Hollywood"" movies. Festival snobs will accuse the movies produced by the Hollywood machine of being drool-inducing and mindless, while popcorn-crunchers will attack independent productions as pretentious and artsy-for-its-own-sake.

In reality, both categories have their strengths and weaknesses. Hollywood movies take advantage of the massive budgets and A-list talent made available to them, and the (admittedly rare) truly talented creative men and women know how to make immensely satisfying spectacles. Festival movies, made with small budgets and seemingly often willed into existence by the sheer determination of the filmmakers, are usually full of heart and are allowed to experiment a bit more than a Hollywood production due to not being tied down to a money-minded producer's will.

It is only rarely that a movie will satisfy on both sides. A Dangerous Place draws from the thriller tradition of big Hollywood but never loses its ability to involve the audience's emotions and challenge norms. It is a movie about the strength of an independent woman forced to act with the safety of the country on the line that keeps the audience both riveted and intellectually and emotionally involved. Having seen the movie at the 2012 Garden State Film Festival, where it won the best picture award and set attendance records, I was witness to the way the entire audience reacted to both the emotional moments and the thrilling ones. A film with the ability to do both holds a special power and indicates a special talent.

A sight that I won't forget: old ladies in the audience cheering passionately as the antagonist meets his violent demise. This is how you know a movie has succeeded in involving its audience.

A great movie that is relevant to the times, emotionally involving, and as thrilling as anything Hollywood is capable of producing.",1356652800,3,1940,5.1687898089171975
5362111,4,B009S0VHGO,I saw A Dangerous Place a few months ago at the NJ Film Festival.  It is an entertaining and well made movie.  I'm glad to see it is out for the public.  Kristen Dalton did some very good acting here and the ending was great!  I recommend this movie for a Friday night with some friends.,1356566400,5,287,4.071428571428571
5362112,5,B009S0VHGO,Went to the Garden State Film Festival and stumbled open this little gem. I hadn't really heard of it when I saw but love checking out independent movies and this really came through as a great one! It was by far the favorite movie I caught at the festival and definitely ranked as one of the movies I've seen in awhile. I'm not going to give away the end but I bet you won't figure it out on your own. I'm telling you it is a very good twist. All in all I've got to give this movie 5 stars and definitely worth snagging for my collection. Loved it.,1356480000,7,549,4.045871559633028

8544016,4,B009S0VHGO,"Claire (Kristen Dalton) and her son Ryan (Hans Otto Schundler) do not have closure 8 months after 9-11 when her husband Will (Joe Ryan) died. The ghost of Will returns to help the pair in a discreet manner. Claire works for a pharmacy company which produces a drug for TB...and it just so happens there has been an outbreak. She is also being pressured to make a pitch to sell the company during the outbreak.

The film centers around the character of Claire. She is a driver, a super woman. If you don't like her, you won't like the film. I loved her role, the relationships she had with everyone, and the crisp dialouge. The production reminded me of a Lifetime film, except for some strange reason I enjoyed watching Kristen Dalton overcome all kinds of issues.

This is a film I don't normally like, it just caught me in the right mood.

8544017,1,B009S0VHGO,"We tend to forget how really good most movies are until you see one like this. Nothing is quite right. Even the music is out of place. I have seen better acting in college plays. Maybe the director just didn't quite get it, or the budget only allowed one take, whatever the reason, this one stinks.",1366243200,2,298,4.339285714285714
8544018,3,B009S0VHGO,"A DANGEROUS PLACE gives us a disturbing look at big pharmaceutical companies and how far they might go to make billions of dollars at the public's expense.  In this narrative, a deadly new kind of TB  is reaching epidemic proportions and a brave corporate manager (Kristin Dalton) strives to discover the cause for this outbreak.
Ms. Dalton gives a sincere plucky performance.  The movie adds a cliche-ridden subplot about her husband killed in the 9/11 bombings and her son's inability to accept his dad's death.  Dad's ghost also shows up for the obvious reasons.
Ultimately, A DANGEROUS PLACE is manipulative and often hokey, but its intentions are sincere and marginally entertaining.",1366070400,,688,5.171171171171171
8544019,1,B009S0VHGO,"Warning--possible spoilers:  I seriously can't believe all of the rave reviews for this movie.  This is a dopey low budget paranoia thriller about a pharmaceutical executive who finds that her company is behind an anthrax outbreak that they happen to have a cure for so the companies stock price will be raised and the company can be sold for an enormous profit, making everyone who works at the company millionaires in the process.  At one point the authorities even trace the outbreak back to the company, come to the mistaken conclusion that it was the work of a single person who had been framed by the real culprit (the suspect conveniently died of the disease) and then nothing happens.  Literally.  There is no further criminal investigation.  There are no congressional hearings.  There is no negative effect on the company's stock price.  There is no attempt by anyone to stop the company from benefiting from the release of the disease by selling to another company.  There are no threats of lawsuits by families of the victims.  There are no protests outside the offices of the company.  It seems like literally nobody in the United States cares about this other than the lead character.  It's hard to enjoy a movie when it has so little grasp of reality that it seems to actually be taking place in some sort of alternate universe.  There is also a subplot involving the ghost of the lead character's husband, a firefighter who died on September 11th, hanging around her house long after his death.  He can move objects with his ghostly powers but does nothing when someone is in the house trying to kill his ex-wife.  He apparently thinks its more important to build an impossibly high block version of the twin towers for his wife and son during what is supposed to be a moving finale.  A Dangerous Place is undoubtedly sincere but it's clumsy and stupid and generally pretty damned awful.  Consider yourself warned.",1365811200,2,1930,4.8
