8324263,5,B000EMGJOA,"So I married into a family of musicians and before I knew it I'd gone from a classically trained pianist (still play) to playing guitar and bass in the family band and my own father has taken up the drums!  At 64 I think that's pretty cool!  We bought this DVD and after just a few short months my Old Man can keep up with us on the drums with NO problem.  I've tracked this DVD out myself and it is super well organized, very well done, and has even inspired me to sit on the drum throne and learn a few beats!  ""Nice and easy and right!""  Well done Stan Mitchell!  This is a great DVD for beginning drummers young and old!  I highly recommend it!",1216771200,3,648,4.05511811023622
