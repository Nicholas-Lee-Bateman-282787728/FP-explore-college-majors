2063210,3,B00025XGIQ,This movie stars the likeable Jim Hutton in a made for TV mystery. He plays a a small town DA trying to deal with two tough cases. Its a good movie with good supporting cast including Ed Asner. Only drawback is that the copy of movie has some obvious flaws- so picture image is not first rate- not up to modern standards we are all used to. Its a shame cause otherwise movie is a treat. I got by the problem to still enjoy the movie- if you can do the same- you will too- but be warned.,1264982400,8,486,3.9693877551020407
2063211,2,B00025XGIQ,"They Call It Murder, 1971 film

The film begins by showing a courthouse in a small town. At night the Sheriffs car arrives to see a dead man shot in the chest. How did he get into that backyard? D.A. Doug Selby questions the people at the house. The medical examiner finds two bullets in the corpse, each a different caliber! Which one was fired first? A private investigator (Poland) calls on Selby to explain his investigation into the accident that killed Brian Antrim; it seems suspicious. The dead man was identified, his buddy Carter was nearby. Selby questions an actress who was at that sanatorium. On the road back some car tries to force him off the road. Selby asks Sylvia Martin to research Roma Corbin. Police Chief Otto Larkin captured Carter. The film plods on with numerous conversations.

When Carter is being taken back to Los Angeles there is an accident involving Frank Antrim. Later Carter pulled a hidden gun to escape. Selby goes to the Antrim house and finds the Police Chiefs car. Then a body was found at the bottom of the cliff (Poland the private detective). Selby questions Roma Corbin again. Later he visits the Antrim house to learn more. A telephone calls Selby to a houseboat. Shots are fired. There is a shocking discovery. How did it all happen? Selby explains how it all happened. [It seems incredible.]

The colors seem to be off and the contrast too high, as from a poor copy. This film lists Erle Stanley Gardner as the writer. He died in May 1970. This story seems too complicated and has too many villains compared to the novels and the Perry Mason series from the late 1950s. Was it meant as a pilot for a new series? It seems to be composed of plots from other Gardner novels. The original D. A. Doug Selby novels were better than this.",1249516800,8,1779,4.570532915360501
2063212,4,B00025XGIQ,I enjoyed this movie more than I expected.  Jim Hutton was great and probably was the reason the movie worked.  I always liked him in Ellery Queen and this was similar but a different time period.  I like the early 70s feel to it.  There were some twists and turns and it held my interest.,1246752000,18,289,4.2

2063215,4,B00025XGIQ,"I enjoyed watching this movie just for stars who are in it. Jim Hutton, Edward Asner, Nita Talbot, Leslie Nielsen, Jessica Walter and others. It is an interesting story. It is a film adaptation of an Erle Stanley Gardner novel.",1235001600,19,227,4.7
2063216,4,B00025XGIQ,"This is a pretty good mystery based on a novel by Earl Stanley Gardner. The hero is not Perry Mason. It was made in  the early seventies as a made for TV movie starring a young Jim Hutton in a pre Ellery Queen role.
The movie looks like a pilot for a TV series. Jim Hutton went on to make the Ellery Queen Mystery series for TV.
The video quality of the DVD is not good. It looks like it was made from an old VHS video tape. So I wouldn't advise paying too much for it, But if you can get it cheap it's worth it.
This is a nice little movie to watch on a Saturday night.",1186704000,26,570,3.7899159663865545
2063217,5,B00025XGIQ,Great mystery.  Kept me guessing until the end.  Jim Hutton was wonderful in the part.  Wish there were sequels!,1458000000,,112,4.7894736842105265

2063221,1,B00025XGIQ,Jim Hutton is great but even he was not enough that I could tolerate Ed Asner.  I did not finish watching the film.,1449100800,,115,4.0
2063222,4,B00025XGIQ,"Pretty good time-spender for what it is.

What it is is a TV Movie from the early 1970s. That means the city attorney / D.A. is going to be investigating the case as if he were Columbo. It is looking at Hutton's character and thinking, ""Shouldn't you be forgetting where you put your glasses, Ellery?"" It is a whole Seattle slew of 70s name stars who made the rounds of TV sound stages guesting on the decade's myriad police procedurals.

Leslie Nielsen and Vic Tayback ... JoAnn Pflug, Jessica Walter, Nita Talbot ... Ed Asner and Lloyd Bochner ...

OK, yeah, the solution beggars the imagination. But what fun it is to get there!",1446940800,,631,4.517543859649122

2063229,3,B00025XGIQ,"A decent made for TV movie that feels likes a pilot for a potential series. The movie is a window into early 1970s. The lead character is the district attorney, but he acts more like the lead detective investigating the murder. The crime,  when actually explained seems rather complex and over the top. It was fun seeing various characters I recognized from later work when they were in their prime.",1430956800,,399,4.7

2063234,3,B00025XGIQ,"This was a made-for-TV movie based on an Erle Stanley Gardner book (same author who penned all of the Perry Mason books).  The plot was nothing spectacular, but it was fun seeing Ed Asner [with a bit more hair], Leslie Nielsen, Jessica Walter, Jim Hutton and others acting away in a journeyman-like fashion.  So if it's a rainy day and you just want to pass the time, get a bowl of popcorn and curl up on the couch and watch Jim Hutton playing a D.A. who figures out the crime(s).",1416873600,,480,4.322222222222222

2063236,4,B00025XGIQ,"I have always loved Jim Hutton so I decide to watch this made for TV movie.  You must remember it is late 60's early 70's music and background sounds.  After watching a few minutes of this movie, I realized that I had seen it quite awhile ago.

In spite of the music, the story line is interesting.  I would recommend it as long as you remember that it is the late 60's and some of the hairstyles and clothing are quite amusing and might take away from the story!",1393286400,,463,4.168539325842697
2063237,3,B00025XGIQ,"Typical 1970s mystery. But enjoyable. No harsh language, no constant violence and death and destruction.  Good plot line.  Hutton good at his role.",1392854400,,147,5.3478260869565215

2063239,5,B00025XGIQ,They Call It Muredr is a fine mystery made wonderful by the great Jim Hutton. Also the very entertaining Nita Talbot adds a lot of zing in her part as a tempermental movie star.,1373760000,2,177,4.235294117647059
2063240,4,B00025XGIQ,I am a fan of Jim Hutton.  He brought a home town boy into all of his movies; the boy next door. This is a story of Jim Hutton as a prosecuting attorney personally involved in investigating a murder. This was before Columbo but in the same spirit. It was a walk down memory lane with actors that were in their prime and well known.  I would recommend this film as a great nostalgic walk. It seems dated but it was still enjoyable in trying to solve the crime with Jim.,1372204800,,468,4.131868131868132
2063241,5,B00025XGIQ,I love Jim Hutton. This was a movie I was looking for from my youth. Makes a great addition to my collection.,1359590400,,109,4.0
2063242,4,B00025XGIQ,"This is a routine TV film from 1970. It is worth watching primarily for its creator and the later stars who made it. The original novel was by Erle Stanley Gardner, whose Perry Mason,was the basis for one of the Big hits of 1950's TV; with much better production, it returned to TV a couple of decades later as a highly successful series of TV movies, also starring the Canadian actor, Raymond Burr. The lead of this film is Jim Hutton, who died while starring in the short lived but excellent Ellery Queen series (and co-starred as the love interest in Cary Grant's last film). The woman in the case is Jessica Walter, award winning actress. The ubiquitous Lloyd Bochner, fine Canadian actor, who appeared frequently in television and films, was the suave attorney, while Ed Asner, on the cusp of his career breakthrough with Mary Tyler Moore and then his own show, plays the police chief. Other familiar faces fill out the cast, Quality is what you would expect from an (apparently) untouched video from 1970; for me it enhanced the nostalgic flavor of the material.
All in all, it is decent entertainment with a bit of a riddle to it.",1323302400,5,1137,4.633663366336633
2063243,2,B00025XGIQ,The movie was a little hard to watch.  The restoration was not done well and many of the scenes were either very dark or very fuzzy.  It was fun to see it again but it is probably too hard on my eyes to watch to again.,1299110400,,218,3.717391304347826
2063244,3,B00025XGIQ,"As a product, this was not bad.  It was a pretty engaging mystery based on of one of Erle Stanley Gardner's characters. I had never seen any other charcter of his on the screen besides Perry Mason. The Star rating is for the quality of the video. As the previous reviewer noted the video quality is questionable at best. It is still watchable though.

As to why this product comes up in Ellery Queen search results, more than likely it is because they share the same actor (Jim Hutton). I received this as a gift after asking for the Ellery Queen mysteries and figured the gift giver got caught up in only viewing the search results. I am going to keep this gift since I do like it and Erle's work, but I will be ordering Ellery Queen mysteries.",1293753600,4,745,4.35251798561151
2063245,3,B00025XGIQ,"Based on Erle Stanley Gardener's book The D A draws a circle, Jim Hutton and a cast of easily recognized actors star in what was probably intended to be a pilot for a new weekly tv series. This series of books is interesting in that Gardner reverses the Perry Mason formula and has the young D.A. be the crusader for justice. I have often wondered why any of the books were never filmed in the past. Upon reading the books, one can imagine Jimmy Steward playing the part of Doug Selby. Unfortunately, if it was intended as a pilot, it was not picked up. The quality of the film is a bit cheesy as well. It sort of plods along. One would do well to read the book and compare notes. You will find the tv film, whose script was written by the talented Sam Rolfe (the man who invented Palidin in Have Gun will Travel) is actually an improvement structurally. Personally I enjoyed the film. I feel, given the opportunity, it could have made a nice series. Of course, this is still a possibility. Wouldn't it be weird (to say the least) to see the cast of Monk re-assembled to play the parts? Lt Disher would be Doug Selby, Stottlemeyer would play the sheriff and Monk could play the suave but wicked attorney A B Carr. Just kidding. The movie is worth watching but I am not sure about buying it. Bad copy. Probably transferred from VHS.",1286668800,4,1331,4.370967741935484

There were some top flight TV actors in the movie and they did well, it was the script. It was just too complicated and too far-fetched. I figured out ""who dunnit"" almost from the start, but I couldn't figure out how and once the ""how"" was revealed it was so preposterous that it really ruined the movie.
