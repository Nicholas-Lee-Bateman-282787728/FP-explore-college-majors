7891247,1,6305499268,"""Xtro 3"" is one of the worst movies ever made.  I hated every stupid, idiotic, unpleasant moment of it.  The only joy I have from it is getting to write this scathing review expressing my detest.  It is my personal revenge against the movie.

I don't dislike horror movies, but they have to be handled in the right way.  They have to be fun, exciting, and scary.  ""Xtro 3"" is none of those things.  It's disgusting, hostile, vile, and stupid.  It's filled with guts, slime, pulsating things, blood, vomit...things handled greatly in ""Alien,"" but that movie was brilliant and good.

The special effects in this movie are laughable...did anyone notice that the alien makes the sound of a cougar or mountain lion?  Did the filmmakers think no one would notice that?  The alien looks cheesy, the acting is terrible, the characters and dialogue are one-dimension--

And yet all these things would be forgivable if the movie didn't take itself so seriously, and above all, weren't so hostile.  It tells its story as if it's lashing out at the audience.  An unholy and unpleasant experience.",1110931200,,1084,4.820652173913044

I agree this movie is litle bit slow at times but other than that, the director and the actors ( ANDREW DIVOFF rules !!) do their job properly. On top of that, the special effects are indeed great and the plot is maybe not that original but very touching.
Call me naive but a story about a tortured ALIEN, whose wife and unborn child have been killed, who takes revenge upon the human kind in such a wicked way really does it for me.
GORYSSIMO says check this out !!",1099958400,7,656,4.1328125
7891249,1,6305499268,"well just what can you say about a movie like this the effects,screenplay,directing,acting were simply awful none of it was even slightly realistic. To think i actually thought this film was going to be even slightly scary.  Oh yes and by the way i didn't want to put any stars but seen as though its compulsory to put at the least 1 i had no option in large i am basing this revieuw on the vhs version,although in contrast any one buying the digital disc version must be out of their mind.",972432000,2,490,4.326086956521739
7891250,3,6305499268,"The movie was average, it features Tom Hanks brother.  The effects were the best part of the movie.  I have heard that this movie is a cult classic, for a ""B' scream movie is has descent effects.",941500800,3,195,4.243243243243243
