8706501,5,B00UGQD3KM,One of my favorite films. Bette Davis said her performance in this was film was one the performances in her career she was most proud of.  I adree totally. Ernest Borgnine and a young Debbie Reynolds shine as well.,1505865600,,214,4.487179487179487
8706502,5,B00UGQD3KM,"This rarely seen classic has a quircky side, and a tour of all your emotions, but the melancholy nature of the film doesnt take away from the stellar performances in this charmer! A must see for any well made film watchers and fans, can be enjoyed by young and old alike, but may have a bit of hard edge reality for some sensitive viewers, nothing profane or bad, just some harsh reality, but the ending leaves it all well done! Enjoy!",1463270400,,435,4.382716049382716
