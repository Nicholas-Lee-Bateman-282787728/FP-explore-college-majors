4485972,5,B004WBC43E,"For those of you who have not so far seen Reggie Perrie not to be confused with THE FALL AND RISE OF REGGIE PERRIN a much earlier series this is a classic. I had series one given to me as a birthday present and watched the complete series in on one rainy afternoon. Reggie is in a job he hates and commutes by train to his office daily during which time he has fantacy's about his fellow train travelers in fact Reggie has them about almost everyone. I could not wait to see if ther was a second series at last after a long wait it was released with series one so I bought the set and have passed on series one to a friend. I must not spoil too much of the storylines as they are so much fun. Written with a great deal of comic flair and a total understanding of what most men think this is a winner . If you have seen Doc Martin Trevor Clunes will be no stranger to you it a great entertainer for not just the wet days it will brighton up even a sunny day.

Leonard Rossiter is and always will be Reginald Iolanthe Perrin, and Martin Clunes might as well be Richard Mulligan.

4485974,5,B004WBC43E,"What great fun! As a huge fan of Martin Clunes (loved, loved, loved him in ""William & Mary,"" as Masterpiece Theater's Mr. Chips, and most recently as Doc Martin), I was a bit skeptical about him in this role made famous by Leonard Rossiter in the 1970s show, ""The Rise and Fall of Reginald Perrin."" But by golly, Clunes quickly won me over. The first half-hour episode didn't grab me right away, and I was a bit concerned about the addition of a laugh track, but by episode three, I was hooked. I had to hit the Back button on my remote several times to catch what I had missed from all the out-loud raucous laughter (my own that is, not the laugh track). Especially enjoy his essentially-clueless wife (played by Fay Ripley) as well as his Walter Mitty-like fantasies (hilarious, haven't-we-all-been-there fantasy when he's sitting on the couch listening to his mother prattle on and on and on). If you want a feel-good, sit back and laugh-your-bum-off escape for a few hours, order yourself a copy of Reggie Perrin. You'll turn it on every night after you get home from another grueling day at work, having to deal with your own unreasonable boss and wacky workmates.",1317859200,5,1169,4.6521739130434785
4485975,4,B004WBC43E,"Since this is an updated version of an original comedy, I was prepared to be disappointed.  Instead I found myself laughing a lot.  Martin Clunes is great as the frustrated drudge having idealistic fantasies. The other characters are pretty funny, especially the receptionist.",1317772800,2,276,5.395348837209302
4485976,5,B004WBC43E,I couldn't stop laughing so had to stop eating lunch while watching this.  Clunes is one funny dude!!! I am going to watch all the Clunes DVD I can get my hands on!!!,1317513600,12,166,4.03030303030303
4485977,5,B004WBC43E,Reggie is typical of so many of us and we can easily relate to his frustrations.  S o well depicted by Martin Clunes.  Is there some way to geet more than series 1&2?  I'd appreciate some info.  Thanks,1314662400,,201,4.2105263157894735
4485978,5,B004WBC43E,"I wasn't sure if I would give this 5 stars or 1 star. 5 stars because of superb Martin Clunes, his brilliant timing and many hilarious situations; or one star because of that horrible canned laughter. It is totally unnecessary and intrusive.",1313280000,2,241,4.761904761904762
4485979,3,B004WBC43E,"I loved 'Doc Martin', and was left believing he was taking 2 years off and would let us know when or if 'Doc Martin' would be back. Didn't. Instead he made this, Reggie Perrin. Which is so inferior to Doc Martin, in interest of plot, comprehensibility, and cohesiveness -- and point.

My laughs came from the talented office mates. Except for the boss, who is a bit scary, in a hackneyed sort of way. Reggie, has similarities to his Doc Martin, but is darker and more vaguely inept. It is not uplifting to watch a cog in an irrelevant business -- do the sorts of things irrelevant cogs do.

It wasn't clear what this was? Just slapstick? More? Irony? Satire? Those fell a bit flat, and then Reggie goes to the beach, takes all his clothes off and looks out to sea. It appears Reggie has been suicidally depressed all this time! (Or was this just an excuse for Martin Clunes to express his exhibitionism? We've seen his skin before, in this, naked legs, flabby gut, etc.)

Anyway, I didn't get it

Maybe it's me, I don't know.",1312761600,13,1025,4.4361702127659575
4485980,5,B004WBC43E,"When I heard of a potential remake of the revered show ""The Fall and Rise of Reginald Perrin"", I wasn't sure what to expect. I wondered if Clunes' performance could rival that of the remarkable Leonard Rossiter, whose original 70's version of Reggie was quite madcap in his nervousness, agitation, and over-the-top fall from the fable of a perfect ""working life."" And to my amazement, he not only matched the excellent performance of Rossiter, but also gave it a greater edge, in my opinion, of a true midlife crisis tale in the modern era.

From delegating authority to his two bumbling, crawling underlings at Groomtech (who are well-meaning chaps, just a bit ditzy), to his in-office therapist (who is extremely ditzy), and his gorgeous co-worker Jasmine, the character of Perrin finds himself in an area that many of us are familiar with; the trappings of a senseless, moribund office environment,  with the gearshift stuck in neutral within a mid-management career. Oh, and his boss Chris Jackson (paying homage to the original 70's boss ""C.J.""), is pretty much clueless and void of any real ideas or leadership. And in the beginning, Perrin finds himself feeling the same way, but as the series progresses, you'll see his true ""out-of-the-box"" thinking take hold, and the shows gets funnier with every episode.

In addition to his mundane life at the office, his personal life is just as uninteresting. Without giving away too much of the plot, Perrin finds himself face-to-face with the humdrum boredom of everyday married life, temptations, daydreaming, etc., all portrayed in a very dark, albeit comical level. Same routine, same house, same train rides to work (which are usually late), same dull job. You see where this is going.....and eventually that trend will need to be broken. Hang on for a wild ride as Reggie gives two fingers up to the establishment and forges his own trail.

This is truly one of the best remakes I've seen in awhile. Well, I guess it's a remake in a way, but this series takes us on a darker journey than the 70's version did, so in many ways it's a brand new glimpse into the life of a familiar character. It's definitely up to the standards of other fine British comedies (Chef, Are You Being Served, Alan Partridge, As Time Goes By, etc). The DVD set will contain 2 discs (series 1 and 2), and here's hoping the BBC will commission more to come. The series so far has been left cliffhanging, so perhaps if enough fans purchase this set, the further adventures of Reggie Perrin will continue.",1306886400,82,2533,4.816091954022989
4485981,5,B004WBC43E,"Reggie (Martin Clunes-Doc Martin) amid his midlife crisis seems the sane but zany over the series characters. My wife and I laughed out lout, paused till we could regain composure, replayed comical moments that came fast. They could almost slip by the viewer if not paying attention. FAST comedy! Having never seen the 70s version of Perrin, I can only compare the 2009-2010 Reggie Perrin to ""Doc Martin"". Same lead actor, but different job, different office, same situation of eccentric story associates. New cast but the ongoing humor, a mix of plots and events as provided in the outlandishly funny ""Doc Martin"" series. There is adult humor and language, more so than found in ""Doc Martin,"" so keep this one for mature minds.

Story begins with Reggie hating his men's body products job at Groomtech. Frustration follows him, explainable after meeting his associates. His suburban wife Nicola (Fay Ripley-`Cold Feet'), teacher, is almost sane. Then comes the Groomtech staff: hard-body sexy Jasmine (Lucy Liemann), Brainstormer brown-noser pair Anthony & Steve, barmy clueless receptionist Vicky (Kerry Howard) with a stunning performance, ego-head-brain-dead Chris the boss (Neil Stuke), not to mention Reggie's mom (Wendy Craig-`The Royal') and Nicola's dad (Geoffrey Whitehead-`Little Dorrit'). The Groomtech wellness nurse, Sue (Susan Earl) is a scream playing a counselor needing therapy. I found the cast excellent, slap-stick funny, absurdity through good lines of fast comedy dialogue enough for all. Joke's in dialogue flow fast, as in ""Airplane"".
A DVD set to just sit back and enjoy. A non-intellectual humorous experience at the gritty grin level.

12 episodes each about 28 laugh-packed minutes.
SUBTITLES AVAILABLE.
Limited summary for the whacky episodes for those that like details:
Season 1: Episode 1- Bored Reggie gets no thrill from being `Head of Disposable Razors'. Home is not much better so can the new sexy colleague, Jasmine, spice up his life?
1:2- Reggie's mom and father-in-law hinder his marriage relationship. As though Jasmine at the office is not enough.
1:3- Reggie guest teaches at his wife Nicola's school and invites her teenager class to visit his Bloomtech office. Imagine!
1:4- Groomtech global means Reggie and Jasmine business trip together in Finland. Is adultery with a sexy coworker on the itinerary?
1:5- Reggie, although skeptical, must provide CEO Chris with a new product to pitch to the Groomtech board of directors. That's about as easy as improving his personal sex life.
1:6- Reggies's stress & office dismay peaks at the office party. What's new on the horizon for Reggie after his big speech?
Season 2: Episode 1- Employment is needed in the Perrin house. Mom and Dad plan to do WHAT!?!?
2:2- Is baking bread & a farmers' market better than a return to the Groomtech office?
2:3- New Groomtech perks are a plus for Reggie--but not for wife Nicola stuck at home.
2:4- Success of `Grot' products is up/down like any useless products' market but leads to a surprising ultimatum. Romantic couplings also are up/down.
2:5- Reggie's visions of success for Groomtech blinds him to home failure. A Grot-oops!
2:6- Crisis is averted in favor of familiar calamity. MORE PLEASE!!!!!

I'm still laughing over all of the sudden violent fantasies visualized of what Reggie Perrin really wanted to do to people in his life. They are hilarious. Things we've all thought of doing. And the really screwball employees are ever trying to up-stage Reggie who's constantly, and comically, at odds with the train system, office staff, his wife, and his useless men's products. A ten-blade razor? No, but a 5-star funny adult comedy. Ending is wide-open for a continuation...so...MORE PLEASE!

Rapid fire pop culture quotes borrowed from here n there ment to keep u laughing. Playing on the fact that audience being Catholic maybe attended perochial school at one time and being British you might find it funny. His character is not so educated.

Martin Clunes is brilliant as Reggie Perrin, deftly balancing just the right amount of sarcastic (bordering on sadistic) wit with bouts of genuine underlying warmth and affection for others, especially his totally inept assistants.

4486044,4,B004WBC43E,"A good script in Martin Clunes hands is sure-fire comedy gold. An episode of REGGIE PERRIN will light up your day. Clunes dry wit is a perfect match for the classic satire with which REGGIE PERRIN is simply teeming.

An update of the classic British series The Fall and Rise of Reginald Perrin, its important to distinguish the two. Although REGGIE PERRIN is co-written by the original series creator, David Nobbs, the two are vastly different.

While the original is frequently howlingly funny, it veers into very, very black comedy. In fact, Im not sure I should call it black comedy because it does tip over the edge from funny to disturbing occasionally. Leonard Rossiter certainly qualifies as a full-on genius in that series, deftly handling any and all material thrown to him, but at times its just all a bit too much to stomach. Some things just cant (or shouldnt) be funny.

It seems, however, that a few lessons have since been learned. The scripts Martin Clunes gets to work with are consistently, laugh-out-loud funny. In this 2009 rendition, poor old Reggie is permitted to dip his toes in the mucky waters of black comedy (occasionally wading in a trifle deeper), but spends most of his time up on the beach, kicking sand in everyones face with gusto  side-splittingly funny.

REGGIE PERRIN the remake is well worth another look. Youll want to keep your remote nearby  some gags youll just have to rewind and watch over and over and over.",1397433600,,1452,4.764940239043825

I like Martin Clunes, whose presence in this attracted me to it, but the laugh track is so intrusive - even by American sitcom standards - that I called it quits after this episode.",1346457600,8,310,4.271186440677966
4486122,2,B004WBC43E,I labored to get through the first episode and doubt that I will move on to the second. The problem - and I am surprised it is not noted in other reviews - is a laugh track that would be considered intrusive even by American sitcom standards.,1346198400,,242,4.170212765957447
4486123,5,B004WBC43E,"I enjoy British sit-coms very much and this one is no disappointment. I think Martin Clunes is great in everything I've ever seen him in, Men Behaving Badly, Doc Martin, and now as Reggie.

4486125,2,B004WBC43E,"We are Martin Clunes addicts (Saving Grace, Horsepower, William & Mary; Doc Martin especially) so we knew we'd love Reggie Perrin. We were ONLY HALF RIGHT. The original media reviews were a mixed bag. It's now clear why that was.

The first six episodes and series/season are all that we expected: brilliant and uproariously funny. Great characters and situations. We gorged ourselves on them after starting to watch the first episode.

But the second six episodes/season are a big come down. Yes the same story line and characters continue sort of, but the whole second season seems to be searching for some direction while frantically trying to be as funny as the first season.  It's as if the writers wrote Reggie for only one season and then had to scramble to put a second season together when it was renewed.

Martin Clunes fans should still enjoy Reggie Perrin.
But after being totally enthralled by the first season, we wound up with an empty deflated feeling after the second season.",1341100800,38,992,4.85207100591716
