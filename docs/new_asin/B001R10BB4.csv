3772468,3,B001R10BB4,"I've been on the look out for sad and depressing anime ever since finishing Now and Then, Here and There, so when someone pointed me towards Air TV I was more then happy to try it out. At first glance Air seems like the pure definition of a heartwarming, yet sad tale, but once you get past the initial tear jerking moments found in abundance in volume one, the story really has very little to offer. Yukito is a young traveling puppeteer who moves from town to town searching for a mysterious person who he calls ""the girl in the sky."" one day, tired and hungry, he stumbles into a small coastal town and meets a young, energetic, girl named Misuzu who seems to be as clumsy as she is cute and charming. Although Misuzu is the main focus of the show, Yukito meets three other misfit girls, each one, much like Misuzu, hide their own secrets and deal with their own personal problems, some of which will leave your breathless. If I were to compare this show with another anime, I'd say it has a lot more in common with Haibane-Renmei then anything else, but where Renmei slowly builds up its momentum to a captivating finish, Air slowly fizzles out and allows itself to die out long before the closing scene. This show, in all honesty, should have been four episodes shorter, for although I understand where they were trying to go with the ending, I couldn't help but feel that it was rushed, unprepared, and mellow dramatic. Where the opening is nothing but pure heartbreaking tragedy, the ending manages to somehow turn an otherwise great story into a cheesy soap opera with Misuzu and her mom taking center stage at the expense of every other character the creators of this show worked so hard to develop.

And that's where this show ultimately fails, in my opinion. Characters like Kano, Tohno, and Michiru get so much attention in the first half of the series that when they suddenly drop off the map nothing felt right anymore. They are very well developed characters with some very serious problems but after maybe two episodes devoted to each, after their lives are suddenly and magically put back together thanks Yukito they are no longer necessary parts of the story and are dropped altogether. Why, I wonder, did the writers bother to put them into this story if they weren't going to play any significant role in the overall plot? Why bother? It isn't as if the story needed them, although they did add some touching moments. Their characters were far too well developed and their stories far too touching to be dropped completely after they served their purpose.

The art work is nothing sort of amazing. I defy anyone to show me an anime series more visually beautiful then this. Every frame is a masterpiece of artistic brilliance found only in anime movies such as Voices of a Distant Star and Place Promised in our Early Days. the characters designs may be a bit clich, with the stereotypical long hair, enormous water eyes, school girl uniforms, the works, but they have a personal feel that ultimately made the characters seem more real, more alive, and that's all that matters in the end. to accompany these visuals, this show boasts a very quiet, very sweet and haunting musical score, mostly piano pieces that reminded me very much of Voices of a Distant Star. I didn't even realize until the last few episodes that they were just playing the same three songs over and over again, and even then it didn't matter. Numerous times I found myself ignoring the dialogue and just listening to the sweet melodies of the soundtrack and watched the beautiful visuals.

In all this show starts out extremely strong, but somehow manages to ruin an amazing story with an ending soap opera writers would be proud of. The series really ends at volume three, or at least that's where it should have been, everything after that, although it has its occasional moments, ruins all credibility this show had as a drama. Watch this show for the visuals, the soundtrack, and heartbreaking opening, and nothing else.

3772469,5,B001R10BB4,"great animation, personally didn't care for the story, it had its funny points...but I was looking for the happy ending call me a sap!",1259884800,,134,4.625
3772470,3,B001R10BB4,"Of all the Key anime series that have been localized for the American audience, Key is the weakest of the lot. It contains all the usual Key elements - gorgeous back grounds, a tragic story line, a mystical or magical element to the backstory, and lots and lots of cute anime girls. However, for some reason, the elements that made Kanon and Clannad so good don't fit together so well in this story. It's almost as if they put all the various Key elements into a box, shook it up, and poured them out on a table and called the result a new series. I can almost see the lab geek with a clipboard checking things off. ""Pretty Girl cast, check. Mysterious magical powers or tragic backstory for each girl, check. Forgotten past life connection between the hero and the obvious heroine, check. Ambiguous pretty boy hero, check. Single mom/aunt/caretaker for hero/heroine, check. Pretty art, check. Nice music, check. Okay, call it a wrap. Put it in a box and ship it!""

Oops, forgot to write a story that makes sense.

There are two things that should serve as a warning: right on the back of the box, it reads ""The questions are rampant, but the answers float aimlessly in the air."" Which, in plainspeak, means even the people who made the thing can't figure out what is going on. Then, if you read the box for ""Air, The Motion Picture"" (which, admittedly, I have not yet watched) it describes itself as ""a cinematic reinvention of the acclaimed television series"". A good story would not have needed ""reinvention"".

Before you read any further, I will warn you that I do include spoilers in this next bit. The story, such as it is, is this: Yukito is a traveling performer who can make dolls move with his magical powers. He also is looking for a mysterious ""girl in the sky"" that his mother had been looking for her entire life and never found. As the story goes on, we learn that the girl in the sky suffers from sad dreams, but if she should ever stop dreaming, she will die. Then we meet Misuzo, a clumsy ditz who befriends Yukito. She has an odd phobia in that she gets hysterical if she makes a friend because she's lost everybody in her life she cared about up to that point. She is an orphan, being cared for by her aunt who doesn't seem to give a hang about the girl and isn't at all disturbed when she brings home Yukito. Yukito then encounters a wide assortment of other schoolgirl/love interests, any one of whom may or may not be the girl in the sky because most have magical powers of some kind or other. As Yukito and Misuzo get closer to each other, Misuzo reveals that she has dreams about flying, which are very sad dreams, and Yukito begins to wonder if she is the girl he has been looking for.

At this point the story begins to lose its way. We discover that Yukito's mom actually knew the girl in the sky, and promised to take her to the beach, thinking this might make her happy and stop the sad dreams, but the girl in the sky dies before she can fulfill her promise. So the duty passes on to Yukito to find the girl and fulfill her last wish, which is kind of hard to do since she supposedly died. Then, suddenly, we find ourselves in fuedal Japan, where the whole story line of the magical winged girls is explored. Then Yukito, evidently remembering that he was a samarai who protected the winged girl in fuedal Japan, vows to use all his powers to make Misuzo happy before she has the final dream and dies. And things go totally whack-a-ding-hoy. He turns into the idiot bird who has been hopping around in and out of all the episodes. We then see a retelling of Misuzo's life, with minor changes so that things will have a happier ending. So far so good. Then Misuzo's aunt, who now suddenly has really loved her all along, vows to take Misuzo to the beach. This fulfills Misuzo's final wish, so she up and dies, making Yukito's unexplained transformation and sacrifice meaningless. And here the TV series ended. The story left me thinking that the writers had all the elements of a good story but did not know how to put the pieces together. All the side stories, centering around the other girls, seem unrelated and tacked on, the girls seeming to be there only to provide Yukito other love interests.

We then get the ""Air in Summer"" specials, which takes the feudal Japan back story and expands upon it. The only thing the specials explains is that Yukito is the descendant of the two bodyguards for the Girl in the Sky, a samarai and a lady magician, who after the death of the Girl in the Sky, decided that she will probably be reincarnated somewhere down the road so they should start having babies with each other so that their descendants can watch out after the next incarnation of the Girl in the Sky. One again, the whole Yukito=bird and Why the heck did Misuzo Have To Die questions are unresolved.

All these complaints aside, if you like Key series, you will probably like Air. But it is the poorest, so far, of the Key offerings. It seems almost like they were writing this anime following a formula, without any inspiration to guide them. The music is nice, the art is pretty, (though the backgrounds are gorgeous, the characters themselves look like they were lifted out of a video game and don't have the same level of finish as the backgrounds). If you can make sense of the story, you are a smarter person than I am. But even at it's worst, Air is a much better watch than, say, One Piece, Dragon Ball Z or (shudder) Naruto.",1259107200,,5472,4.445219123505976

Music: great...Tori no Uta (the opening song) is amazing and is on my ipod
Humor: I laughed more than once and chuckle over scenes long after seeing it

Bad:
13 episodes but should have been 26
2 extended episodes that should have been included in the main story past arc or left out completely
Character Development: the series was far too rushed for this

My advice is to watch it, especially if you've seen Kanon and enjoyed it. It is emotionally driven and, while horribly rushed, it's still something I'm glad I own on my shelf.",1252886400,,539,4.546391752577319
3772472,3,B001R10BB4,"I really wanted to love the Air TV series. Honestly, I did. The art style mesmerized me from the moment I saw it. The sound of the summer bugs (cicadas maybe?), the vibrant colors of the ocean, blue sky, and sunset all created imagery like no other. The characters were even quite likable. However, the story is where it all fell apart for me. There was just too much unexplained (well perhaps half-explained, but still not convincing) magic bullcrap. Not to mention, almost the first half of the series was devoted to side characters that really didn't do anything to progress the story, so you really didn't get the needed character development to really get an attachment to the main characters. Everything was all just way too superficial to me. In the end, it came off as trying to be sad and meaningful/tragic, but it really didn't quite get there. In short, I just didn't buy into it; none of it was really believable.

I think after hearing so much about how awesome the series was, I just was expecting too much from it.",1249603200,2,1029,4.592391304347826
3772473,5,B001R10BB4,"Before buying a whole season of an anime, I always watch some episodes online. The first scene of ""Air"" convinced me that this would be a good buy, so I ordered not only the series but also&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Air-The-Motion-Picture/dp/B001R10BAU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Air: The Motion Picture</a>. After the first day of watching them, I never watch more than four episodes a day, the tune of the theme song went on constant repetition in my head for days. What I want to say is that this composition is very suggestive, though not for thoughts but for emotions. During the last episode of the second disc, the third has only two alternative episodes to a subplot, you are bound to cry or at least to fight back your tears, or else you would have stopped watching it earlier.

""Air"" has a dream-like world and story-line. There is some magical reality in it and also some sentimentality. It's interesting that you tend to notice only after waking up from this dream-world how few characters are in this small town. And the composition of the visible population: there are only two men, neither of whom native or permanent resident, and the second one has a very peripheral role. All the others are children and women. The notable exception is the main character the point of view of whom most of the episodes are told.

3772474,5,B001R10BB4,"Over a thousand years ago, people born with wings were used by people as weapons in war, some were used for the protection of the world.  A mother and her daughter were the last remaining people with wings.  Those who feared the winged beings were able to kill the mother but as for the young daughter, a deadly curse would be put on every reincarnated winged person and the person that she was close to.

In an effort to break the curse, the young winged girl's best friend and her bodyguard decided to have an offspring in an effort that one day, a descendant with the bloodline will be able to find the girl with wing in their current time period and break that terrible curse.

A thousand years later, Yukito Kunisaki, a descendant in search for the winged girl, believes he finally found her.

Welcome to the whimsical and magical storyline of ""AIR"", a popular 2005 anime series is based on a visual novel by the Japanese software company Key back in 2000.

The original visual novel for the PC was an adult game but was later released without the adult content for the PC, Sega Dreamcast and Sony PlayStation 2.  And not long ago for the Sony PSP and cell phones.  The visual novel also branched out into manga and also an animated film.

Both the animated series and the film were originally released by ADV Films in 2007 but the license for the animation was transferred to FUNimation Entertainment and both have been re-released as a complete series box set (the 12-episode series and the two specials) and the film in 2009.

The series was directed by Tatsuya Ishihara (""K-ON!"", ""The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya"", ""Tenchi Universe"", etc.) and features original character design by Itaru Hinoue (""Kanon"", ""Clannad"", etc.) and character designs and key animation by Tomoe Aratani (""Munto"", ""Lucky Star"", ""The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya"", ""Clannad"", etc.).

""AIR"" is one of those animated series that is quite difficult to explain and also having to be careful without spoiling any of the storylines.

Unlike your typical anime series and following the standard style of storytelling, the storyline is fragmented by its multiple storyline arc that revolve around main character Yukito Kunisaki's search for the ""girl in the sky"" and Misuzu Kamio who has dreams that she is a girl flying in the sky.

Each arc  is self-contained and where major characters are typically seen throughout the anime series, not for ""AIR"".  But do not let that push you away from watching this series because ""AIR"" is an anime series that deserves to be watched but also an anime series that will no doubt captivate you but also will make you want to cry.

The main characters for the anime series are:

Yukito Kunisaki - Yukito wanders around the country looking for the ""Girl in the Sky"", a story passed down to him from his mother and her family in the last thousand years.  He makes his living by using telekinesis and controlling a puppet .  His life of living in the streets change when he meets Misuzu Kamio.

Misuzu Kamio - The first of the female characters that Yukito believes may be the girl with wings.  She is a girl who has no friends and since her mother died, her father left her with her aunt Haruko Kamio.  She tends to say ""Gao"" when she is about to cry or nervous and she loves dinosaurs and baby chicks.  She also tends to have these dreams of her flying in the sky.  She becomes close with Yukito and invites him to live with her temporarily.

Haruko Kamio - The aunt of Misuzu who looks quite young for her age.  A bit brash, she has taken care of Misuzu for ten years at the request of Misuzu's father.  Haruko has not gotten too close to Misuzu because she couldn't bare the thought of losing her.  So, she never bought her things or celebrated her birthday, she kept herself distant.

Kano Kirishima - The second girl that Yukito believes that may be the girl with wings.  She is an energetic girl who loves taking care of animals and with her dog Potato.  She lives with her sister Hijiri, the town's doctor and wears a yellow scarf on her wrist.  She is told by her sister that once she is ready, she could remove the yellow scarf to use magic.  But she also dreams of flying in the sky.  Her sister Hijiri hires Yukito to do some custodian work at her clinic.

Minagi Tohno - The third girl that Yukito meets but is surprised to learn of the secret that she is keeping.  A top student in school and quite shy, she hangs out with a girl named Michiru.  Minagi has a major secret in her life that she has been hiding for years.  Meanwhile, her friend Michiru also has a secret.

AUDIO & VIDEO:

""AIR"" features a vibrant and colorful animation style for the backgrounds but for the main characters, parts are well animated and shaded while some parts are quite basic in presentation.  A lot of details in the eyes and the hair and clothing but it's the use of color to show the town that looks absolute beautiful.  From the sunsets and everything around the scenery in amber to the colorful beach scenes, the background animation work was well done and helped enhance the character design.  Overall, picture quality is vibrant, bright and colorful.

""AIR"" features both the Japanese and English dub work and are well done.  English dub is featured in 5.1 Dolby Surround Sound.  Japanese dub work is also featured in 5.1 Dolby Surround Sound.  Only the OAV specials were featured in English and Japanese 2.0.

The Japanese voice work is actually quite exciting as the series showcases popular Japanese voice actresses  Aya Hisakawa (""Ah! My Goddess"", ""Bubblegum Crisis"", ""Devil Hunter Yohko"", etc.), Kikuko Inoue (""Ranma 1/2', ""Ah! My Goddess"", ""El Hazard"", etc.), Daisuke Ono (""Blood+"", ""Eyeshield 21', etc.), Tomomi Kawakami (""Bleach"", ""Fushigi Yugi"", etc.)  and Yumi Touma.

Meanwhile, the English version has talents Vic Mignogna, Monica Rial, Luci Christian and Alison Sumrall and many more.

I watched the series with both languages and both are quite solid.  Main difference is that for the character of Misuzu, the Japanese version features her character with a childish, high pitched voice.  But overall, the voice work was well-done for this series.

Subtitles featured are only in English.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

Disc 3 for ""AIR - The Complete Series"" features the clean opening and ending themes which features no text or credits.  Included also are FUNimation Entertainment trailers.

JUDGMENT CALL:

""AIR"" is a heartwarming but yet tragic anime series.  From it's interesting and enjoyable characters to the vibrant animation, I found the actual pacing of each episode to be quite interesting and different compared to any anime series I have seen.  In a way, you can see ""AIR"" as an anime television series, although 12 episodes long, are broken into different story arcs.

The first seven episodes are used to feature Yukito and his searched for ""The Winged Girl"" and building on character development of how he meets three girls who have the potential to be reincarnations of Kanna.

Episode 8 and 9 features the back story of how ""The Winged Girl"" became a story that would be passed down to generations but how her curse has continued on for all these years.

Episode 10-12 primarily features the relationship of Haruko and her niece Misuzu and the two finding comfort with each other and making the steps necessary to grow as individuals.

The series is enchanting and magical but it all boils down to a thousand years of stories passed down from generation to generation in hopes that the descendants of the bloodline will continue in telling the stories but most of all, hope for that descendant to find a way to end the curse.

I felt the characters were enjoyable to watch but to see how the characters were all woven together and having some sort of connection with one another but I did feel that this buildup of learning of these characters would have something to do with the final episodes but they don't.  Each episode arc is pretty much contained. Most anime series are not this way and because of that, I was more open to see where this anime was taking me.

Needless to say, by the end of the series, you can't help but cry.  How the series ends is quite heartwarming but tragic.

Without spoiling the series, I will say that ""AIR"" is one of those rare animated series that presents itself unlike any normal anime series when it comes to storytelling.  In fact, because it does something quite different, may be thought of creative and exciting while others may find the storyline to be disjointed and even perhaps, maybe frustrating.  For me, I felt that the storytelling and pacing of the arcs was well-done.  The staff behind the anime series seem to have wanted to think outside of the box and do something that wasn't so ""typical"" and do something different and I feel they succeeded.

But the good news for those who want an unfragmented story arcs, especially focusing on the characters of Yukito and Misuzu, will want to pick up the ""AIR - The Motion Picture"" DVD which was released simultaneously by FUNimation Entertainment.  The film features none of the extra characters but solely on Yukito, Misuzu and Haruko.

""AIR"" is highly recommended!",1242691200,11,11878,4.647934678194044

3772477,3,B001R10BB4,"Thanks to a very deliberate effort to avoid any form of spoiler (or even editorial review), I was able to dive into Air The Complete Series completely and utterly unaware of what to expect.  The stills and screen captures have always had a crisp, clean and unmistakably ""anime"" quality to them and thus hinted toward a story that would succeed on multiple levels.  As such I have found in the past that expectations on either side of the coin can go a long way in deteriorating this type of dramatic series.  Thankfully my mission was a success as it allowed me to journey into this emotionally saturated tale completely non-jaded.  Here's what I discovered.

Spread across 3 discs, Air the Complete Series consists of 12 episodes on the first two plus a pair of specials on the third disc.  Packaging, much to Funimation's credit, is every bit as intriguing and beautiful as the actual series art.  Within the stunning cardboard slip box are two thin packs, the first of which contains the two series discs (6 episodes on each) and the second pack houses the third (bonus) disc.  In all the series spans 340 minutes and is rated TV 14.

The story goes something like this: A mysterious traveler finds himself in a seemingly parentless town somewhere along Japan's coast (modern day).  With little more than the clothes on his back, he attempts to make a living as a puppeteer only unlike say, Jim Henson, our traveler is able to manipulate his puppet via telekinesis.  While his performances are quite entertaining, he quickly discovers that audiences of unappreciative (and broke) children aren't particularly generous in the tipping department.

Sleeping on a concrete wall on the beach, our traveler Yukito meets an odd schoolgirl named Misuzu who, with an abundance of wide-eyed innocence, manages to break down his defenses.  Now I could go on (and on) with the development of the complex and often-times intricate plot but as you already know, wouldn't want to ruin this type of tale for you either.

Keeping that in mind, let me just say that Air is an emotionally driven story with a slight bend on the supernatural.  Yukito is driven by tales of a winged ""girl in the sky"" while Misuzu is haunted by dreams so taxing that her health is literally failing.  The connection runs deeper than even I expected and flows along a path of mysticism, reincarnation, and the thin veil between reality and dreams.

In all, the story could best be described as a tragedy though wrapped in enough mystery to hide the fact initially.  The pacing is a bit erratic but rewards viewers with enough patience to accept the fact that a lot of the questions presented early on will eventually be answered.  While the early portion of the show sets up the viewer to believe this is Yukito's story, in truth he is only a minor player in the mystery surrounding Misuzu.

Back to the pacing, however:  The first disc and beginning portion of the second crawl along at times with a near day by day chronicling of Yukito and Misuzu's lives.  Just as the viewer begins to get accustomed to the monotony of the pacing, things take a rapid and unexpected twist in the form of a flashback to the year 994 A.D. in episode 7 (Dream).  This sequence not only really starts to answer some of the nagging questions that will have begun piling up but it also offers an entirely different pacing from that in the core of the story.  Far more action laden, the flashback segment is even rife with humorous interactions.  So monumental (and unique) is this part of the story that both of the special episodes mentioned above (on the third disc) serve as almost ""deleted scenes"" from this particular sequence.  Obviously trimmed down for time restraints and perhaps continuity issues, the episodes are presented in their full humorous glory as a treat to viewers once the main tale concludes.

Unfortunately, after the flashback does conclude, we're taken back to modern day Japan in a more despondent tone that never really ceases right up until the show's rather sad conclusion.  The fragility of Misuzu comes to fruition shortly after the ancient connection between she and Yukito is finally established.

I'm big on isolating a show's most memorable attribute in my reviews and in the case of Air The Complete Series, that honor goes to the stunning background art showcased throughout the entire duration of the program.  The skies, the clouds, the lighting, the ambiance is all second to none.  There is no shortage of moments throughout the series where a double take is required just to make sure some actual footage wasn't imported behind the character models.  The characters themselves are of the giant, perpetually watery-eyed variety with near non-existent mouths.  It's a form that seems to be either loved or hated but certainly takes nothing away from the stunning background artwork incorporated throughout.

Soundtrack work is above average and, like all Funimation dubs I've encountered thus far; the English acting is right on the money.

In all Air The Complete Series is an interesting psychological drama with an abundance of bright, wide-eyed innocence used as tool to convey a deeper tragedy that transcends time and space.  It's certainly the type of show that demands multiple viewings to fully grasp the mystery (and more importantly, the clues) presented along the way.  It's artwork, presentation, and style are enough to distinguish it from its classmates while its subdued emotional qualities ensure that it will gather little dust on the shelves it graces.",1240185600,21,5557,4.88592750533049

I got really wrapped up in it and couldn't wait for the happy ending that seemed pretty obvious. Apparently, the writers saw that it was obvious too, and decided to put a horrible, heart-wrenching twist on it. It was like they wanted to be able to say ""Ha!

Then the next episode was kind of intriguing because you got to put some of the pieces together from Yukito's and Misuzu's pasts. But then episode 9 was like WHAT?! By then I was confused beyond repair, and pretty disappointed.
SPOILERS!!
First Yukito turns into a crow and goes back in time to when he first met Misuzu. Wha...??? At first I was thinking ""Oh, so this is the chance he asked for, to be able to go back and fix his mistakes. But absolutely nothing changed whatsoever. The only difference is that Misuzu has a pet crow. The only thing he accomplished was retrieving the birthday present Haruko got for Misuzu, which only made her happy for about a day, and Yukito still failed and randomly disappeared, and Misuzu still died in the end. So basically Yukito got to go back in time and helplessly watch himself fail all over again, and see some of Haruko's side of the story so he could feel like more of a jerk (plus the fact that he doesn't even really remember what's going on). They got me really attached to Yukito and Misuzu, then they throw them aside and the end is randomly about Haruko and some guy who your first impression of is ""He's a jerk."" When Yukito first disappeared, I was upset, because he's my favorite character, but I still had hope that Haruko and Misuzu would get a happy ending, that maybe Yukito didn't fail after all!! They built me up to the point of thinking ""Yay, Yukito DID lift the curse, and Misuzu won't die!"", then brought me crashing down when Misuzu died. But the story contradicted itself, because Yukito and Haruko both got really close to Misuzu, and according to legend should have died. But Yukito turned into a crow (again, no explanation), and Haruko lived happily ever after. I guess if she's your favorite character, you'll be happy.
People complain about how Kano, Minagi, and Michiru were such developed characters but had so little story. But I'm glad they threw them in there, so at least somebody ended happy!!

So here's my advice. If you like happy endings, watch up to episode 7, or 8-9 if you really want to (they kind of overlap, so...). But if you like to watch the characters you love be defeated by fate and fail miserably at the tasks set before them, go ahead and watch it all the way through. Or if you're one of those crazy people who love to be baffled and confused and end up with a headache (I'm talking to you, Inception fans), this is the ending for you!! I give you a 73% guarantee that you will come away from this show having no idea what happened or what the meaning of the story was. Enjoy!

P.S. I probably didn't give that impression, but I really did LOVE this show, until the rotten ending.",1339113600,2,3220,4.446700507614213
8337086,5,B001R10BB4,this is by far the best anime ever made i am also a fan of kannon and a lot of other english dubs but nothing compares to air!,1318809600,,126,3.5357142857142856
8337087,5,B001R10BB4,"There is no need for me to summarize this show because: 1)Spoiler risk and 2)too many reviews that summarize the show. This show is very heartwarming in my opinion. For those that have seen Kanon and or Clannad,AIR is very similar and you will begin to notice these similarities. Although one might expect to see similarities because they share the same creator. All that i will say about the storyline is that Yukito is not the central character in the story. This is an anime that every collector SHOULD have regardless of preferences.",1276560000,,537,4.78494623655914
8337088,4,B001R10BB4,I was a little hesitant to buy this video at first because I hate buying videos that I have never seen before. However this was what my boyfriend wanted as a present. And I am so happy with this series we watched it all in one night and WOW it was amazing. If you want a video that has fun and romance and some twists and turns this is the series for you!,1272672000,,355,3.8767123287671232
8337089,4,B001R10BB4,"Air was the first of Kyo-Ani/Key Arts series brought over by ADV.  Unfortunately, of the three, Air, Kanon and Clannad, it's probably the weakest.  However, it is still a great show.  It really pulls you in and causes you to care for the characters, and though you know what is coming in the end, its still incredibly sad when it finally comes.  The summer episodes are also included in this set and are quite good as well.

ADV's dub for this is truly exceptional, especially the summer episodes.  This is the type of show they always excelled at producing, and it's a shame they no longer have the rights to it.  Even though this is the Funimation set, ADV still produced the discs, so no worries about the lousy video and audio quality that often accompanies their DVD sets.

If you like good anime drama, you should give Air a try, as well as it's sister series, Kanon (ADV Dub/Funi license), and Clannad (Sentai/ADV dub/license).",1269043200,,934,4.618181818181818
8337090,4,B001R10BB4,"I'm not entirely sure what to say about Air TV.  In fact, I waited to post this review because I didn't have anything really definite to say.  I should emphasize right away though that I did not bother watching disc 4.  I had heard that it was basically a recap edition that didn't offer anything new to the series, and after watching disc 3 to the end, I decided it was pretty safe to skip the last dvd since the series DID seem to end on disc 3.

Alright so, Air TV's animation is just stunning, probably some of the best, if not THE best I've seen.  It's very shiny, sparkly, and colorful despite the very somber, nearly depressing story.

The story itself is, as I said, rather somber, sad, and while there are some elements of cuteness and weak comedic value, there aren't any ""lol"" moments to speak of.  Quite a bit of this series focuses on the supporting cast rather than the main characters for a significant part of the series.  I'd say that more than half of it is what many would call ""filler"" episodes.  While they are definitely interesting, they don't have much to do with the main characters save for some relatively brief interaction between the main characters and the supporting cast in the first few episodes.  When the plot finally starts to focus on the main characters and starts to explain what exactly is going on, all of a sudden things get confusing.  For some reason there are major elements that get changed.  Air TV is another one of those series that seems as if the writer forgot what he was doing, or ended up with writer's block.

I recommend having a box of tissues handy, especially at the end because I can almost guarantee you'll cry at least a little.  I would not recommend Air TV for people who do not like angsty dramatic tear jerkers.  Like I said, there is little to no sustained comic relief, and there aren't any action scenes either, so keep those things in mind.  I would personally recommend renting this series as it definitely will not appeal to a lot of people.  However, if you're the patient type that enjoys a good cry, then Air TV is for you.",1268697600,,2098,4.450261780104712
