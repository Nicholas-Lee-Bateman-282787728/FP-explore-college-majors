8758342,4,B01ECMUQIC,"The old scenario used countless times before where if one little thing you did was different, how would your life have turned out movies, where we see two parallel storylines played out, in a sort of Choose Your Own Adventure decision with both alternatives for an hour and half on the screen.  This one stars Haylie Duff, who seems to be a staple actress of made for TV Christmas movies.  As well as Chris Carmack best known for playing Will Lexington on Nashville.  Two years before this both actors starred together in another TV movie called Beauty and the Briefcase.  This first aired in 2012 by the way.

This one's scenario is Ruth missing a plane or catching it.  She can either be professional and fly to LA to work on an event, or spend Christmas with her boyfriend.  Although these sorts of movies are very predictable, this was one was a lot of fun.",1488153600,,861,4.516129032258065
8758343,4,B01ECMUQIC,"30-year-old New Yorker Evelyn Wright (Haylie Duff) is on the fast track in her chosen career. An invaluable employee for Cole Events, a high-end event planning firm, Eve basks in the triumph of her latest project (a Christmas-themed barmitzvah). She's due to embark on a ten-day ski vacay in Vermont with her slacker boyfriend. Ah, but not so fast, young lovers. Eve's cutthroat boss, Elizabeth Cole (Connie Sellecca), just landed a last-minute account: Gobbler, the next-gen social network. Gobbler's young CEO, Aidan Green (Chris Carmack), has hired Cole Events to organize a Christmas Eve bash in a final bid to draw in investors. Guess who Ms. Cole taps to handle this? Yup.

Eve has got a decision to make, except there's really no choice, not once Ms. Cole divulges that she's contemplating opening an L.A. office and that she's got Eve in mind to front her West Coast operations. Eve breaks the bad news to her man, and if you look real close, you can see how miffed couch boy is in between his marathon playing of his video games.

Wherein lies the fault? Was it Eve's boyfriend forgetting to set the alarm? Was it her mad dash to the airport that results in a shoe heel catastrophe? The airport gate employee nursing a grudge at the world? One scenario has Eve making Flight 815 to Los Angeles in the nick of time. One other scenario has her missing the gate by ten seconds. Lifetime's 2012 holiday offering, All About Christmas Eve, presents both futures as they play out in parallel.

Huh. I wonder if the writers were aware that Flight 815 to Los Angeles was the same flight number and destination of the plane in Lost? Man, that could've been a dope third scenario for Eve.

In the reality where she misses her flight, Eve is fired and becomes a barmaid and dusts off her BFA in studio art from NYU. In the reality where she and her possibly snaky project assistant Matt (Gib Gerard) make their flight, she goes on to successfully plan Gobbler's Christmas Eve party and becomes close with Gobbler's studly CEO. Which life is better? It's nice that the movie doesn't preach about which path was better. Each life turns out its share of obstacles and heartaches.

The movie makes it easy enough and coherent enough to track Eve's two lives. Haylie Duff lends enough nuance in her dual roles, makes each Eve distinct from the other, that you don't get confused as to which one you're eyeballing at any given moment. So Haylie's good. So is the actress who plays the bar owner and Eve's supportive best friend, Lila (Bianca Lawson). Even the two drag queen barflies are consistently amusing. Patrick Muldoon surprisingly isn't cast as the male lead, relegated instead to playing the male lead's laid back business partner. The lead guy is Chris Carmack who has got that Casper Van Dien thing going on. Maybe it's the script, but Carmack is pretty underwhelming as Eve's potential romantic interest. Makes me wonder what in heck she sees in him. Come to think of it, what did she see in her slacker boyfriend, Darren (Stephen Colletti), with whom she was gonna holiday in Vermont? That guy's a weasel.

No, it's not as well executed or as well acted as Sliding Doors. But you never expected it to be as good, right? And the dramatic themes are gracefully handled. And Haylie Duff makes for two sympathetic leads. Connie Sellecca pulls it off as the ruthless boss whose ""one impulsive move in the past seventeen years was to hire Eve."" Because of the constant switching back and forth, I feel that the pace moves swiftly. I won't say it's any deeper than other Lifetime or Hallmark flicks. What happens here is that it jams in twice as many tropes because it's rolling out two plotlines, so the screen looks busier than usual. Me, I prefer the reality in which Eve misses her flight. I feel that arc flows more honestly, more organically whereas the other one, in which Eve is caught up in the big lights, big city, seems to have more artifice. Maybe I even sympathize with fired Eve more. I like her better as a struggling artist. Heck, I even attached an image from the movie of Eve's fantastic mural. I'm not a fan of American Idol but American Idol alum Diana DeGarmo shows up as herself, hired by Eve to perform at the Gobbler's Christmas Eve bash. Diana's fans ought to be stoked because she does get to say a couple of lines and her version of ""O Holy Night"" is pretty dope. And if that's not enough, another American Idol, Ace Young, pops up for a duet with Diana. Not being a fan of the show, I'm thinking those two folks are more for you than for me. At least, they didn't get in the way of the movie. What IS for me is that the company Gobbler is staged at the Nikken World Headquarters in Irvine, CA. Having toured there some time ago, that had me stoked.

Last thing, you should be aware that this DVD comes in Region 4 format, meaning it won't play in the U.S. unless you've got one of those All Region DVD players.",1485216000,,4936,4.558060879368658
