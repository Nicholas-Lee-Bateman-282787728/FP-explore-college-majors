2960971,5,B000W1V5TM,"I've had an audio bootleg of the 1965 set for years but to see Bob Dylan with Mike Bloomfield from The Butterfield Blues Band at his early peak, the rhythm section from Howlin' Wolf's band, bassist Jerome Arnold (Billy Boy Arnold's brother) and the amazing Sam Lay (ever hear his double shuffle? the drums he played are at the Experience Music Project archives in Seattle WA -- I saw them) and organists Barry Goldberg and Al Kooper is amazing. Only The Band could meet that high standard later that year when they joined Dylan at the Hollywood Bowl. Who ever thought that this footage existed? The hint was when some of it showed up when Festival and No Direction Home was released this past year. That still begs the question of the film of the English tour that next Fall which showed up only in clips in No Direction Home. The two World Tour releases are not the official films; Murray Lerner must have those. Apparently he shot the Fall 1965 electic/acoustic tour while D. A. Pennebaker shot the Don't Look Back Spring 1965 tour if I am right. The logical thing, now, is to release that footage with The Band minus Levon Helm plus Micky Waller on drums. Did someone film the Carnegie Hall Concert? Anyway, it's classic music that changed the world.",1194393600,29,1253,4.598214285714286
2960972,5,B000W1V5TM,"This disc has been hyped for the famous ""booing"" when he went electric. My take after watching, is buy it for the first 5 songs from the 1963 section. Even though these tracks are acoustic, Dylan really showed his incredible songwriting talent. That footage will go down in history. The 1964 stuff is a step down (last 2 songs are pretty good) The famous 1965 stuff is over-rated. The jangly ""Maggie's farm"", is alright, but seems a little tense. ""Like A Rolling Stone"", is virtually flawless. Why anyone would boo that version, is beyond me. The last song, ""It's All Over Now, Baby Blue"" is incredible(Crank this one up). This disc is beyond historic.",1194048000,50,652,4.728070175438597
2960973,4,B000W1V5TM,"There's almost nothing left to say this far down the road about the Minstrel from Minnesota. Other than this---he was, is, and likely will forever be, the greatest songwriter that modern America has proffered to the world. For all his stumbles, he is after all only a man, Dylan remains THE transformational figure in modern popular music. He is the bridge between the revolution begun by Elvis and taken across the universe by The Beatles.
This dvd, in glorious black and white, captures the earnestness and even more so the unrelenting brilliance of the 22/23/24 year old icon. His voice, though still raspy, is remarkably articulate though nowhere near as articulate as the words that come out of him. It may be marketed as a music dvd, but it is in fact an artifact of history. Amazingly, unlike most historical figures, this one is still current, still alive and still impossible to summarize in three paragraphs.
Could just as easily have been titled Portrait of The Young Man as An Artist---fascinating, engrossing, and well worth adding to any collection for those interested in His Bobness.
He is so much older now, he's younger than that here....",1194048000,6,1156,4.903061224489796
2960974,5,B000W1V5TM,"This is a fascinating document of Bob Dylan's transition from a buzzworthy newcomer to a genuine American icon.  Without ornamentation or comment, this  disc presents Dylan's impact on the fabled Newport Folk Festival in three pivotal years, 1963-65.  In the early sequences, Dylan sits amid bluegrass and folk legends such as Doc Watson and Pete Seeger, a skinny kid paying his dues, earnestly singing his self-penned emulations of Woody Guthrie's talking blues style.  There's something in the air, though, an electric charge to his aura that makes him stand out amid the studious folk-scene crowd.  In the '64 festival, Dylan is more of a hovering presence, with numerous artists (Joan Baez, Johnny Cash) covering his material and calling him up on stage.  There are episodic clips of Dylan and Baez making googly eyes at one another, and a momentary glimpse of the folk scene's equivalent of Beatles-mania, with Baez interviewed inside a car that drives past a gaggle of adoring fans, making light of her own celebrity.

It's in 1965 that Dylan really emerges as a superstar -- the year before, there was a growing sense that he had outgrown the insularity and strictures of the overly-earnest folk scene, but in '65, when he strapped on an electric guitar and cranked up the volume, it was a clear declaration of independence, one that was met with a predictable mix of condemnation, exhilaration and adoration.  This rift really didn't concern Dylan -- he'd made up his mind which direction he was flying in -- but the moment is still charged with drama and power, and Dylan's personal charisma had shot off the charts.  Even in these oft-times choppy old film clips, he sizzles the very air around him, leaping out off the screen with his puckish, brooding persona metamorphosing moment by moment, an artist who was fully alive and changing the culture around him.

The no-frills presentation is particularly useful -- there are separate commentary tracks, but the main film offers no narration, so you, as the viewer, are free to see and interpret the events for yourself.  Dylan fans, folk devotees and students of popular culture will all find this an invaluable film.  Highly recommended!  (DJ Joe Sixpack)",1193875200,13,2217,4.991847826086956
2960975,5,B000W1V5TM,"Unlike some of the other reviews here, I won't complain about what this dvd is missing. Dylan's performances speak for themselves and I'm glad to own them. If you like Dylan..well, frankly I'd like to know why you haven't bought this yet?? Do it!",1193875200,2,246,4.613636363636363
2960976,4,B000W1V5TM,"An absolutely essential addition to any Dylan aficionado's collection, since the majority of this footage is never-before-seen. The Love Minus Zero and Talkin' World War III Blues performances seen here in particular are spine-chilling.

However, since this film was for big-time Dylan fans, some of the edits are inexplicable. Some intros are left out, but there's a more serious drawback. It includes two versions of Mr. Tambourine Man: one from 1964, before the song was released, as performed during the afternoon workshop, and the other from 1965, after the infamous electric set performed in the evening. NONE of them are complete. The first is missing the third verse, while the fourth is missing the first harmonica break and the last verse.  I know the producer has his reasons, like artistic integrity, but c'mon, they know who the audience for this DVD is...

Also, why couldn't the missing songs from Newport 1963 and 1964 be seen, at least via bonus tracks, in case they were worried about too much song duplication in the film itself?

But it's still an excellent time capsule and one of the best music DVD's of the year, if not the last few. The sharp criticisms are only because how important this DVD is.",1193529600,93,1221,4.884057971014493

2960980,5,B000W1V5TM,Excellent!  Amazing to see Dylan's growth from folk to electric and the pretentiousness of the audience at the last festival appearance.  So much for not being prejudice accepting of others.  LOL.,1456790400,,196,5.258064516129032
2960981,4,B000W1V5TM,"This film edits together songs from Dylan's day and night performances at the Newport Folk Festival in 1963/64/65. It does not show Dylan's entire performances from each year. It also includes brief clips of and with other acts (especially Joan Baez, whom Dylan was dating at the time), the audience's reactions, etc. The editing and choices of clips (and choice of omissions) help the viewer see first hand how Dylan was perceived and treated by the masses and how his confidence grew and persona and style changed over those 3 years. It makes it much easier for a modern viewer to understand the controversy felt when Dylan included an electric set with a band in 1965.

For this reason, I think it is a valuable film. The footage remains raw and grainy, not remastered, but the image and sound are decent for the time and intended effect. There's a lot of footage I've never seen. For the price I highly recommend this DVD. It's well packaged and includes a short but informative booklet.

Here's a listing of the songs (an * denotes my personal favs) and some personal notes after only 1 viewing.

Songs from 1963:
North Country Blues, With God On Our Side, Talkin' World War 3 Blues, Who Killed Day Moore*, Only a Pawn In Their Game, Blowin' In the Wind*. In 1963, Dylan really seems like a Woody Guthrie imitator, almost ""acting"" the role at times. The introduction he's given shows how much the folk world expected him to be the ""saviour"" of folk music, the ""spokesman and poet"" of his generation, etc. That's a lot of unnecessary weight thrown at a new artist and Dylan later proves he was never in it for others. In 1963, he's loving the attention, power and freedom. It's also funny how his talking songs are so like rapping, and by 1963 this was already a old style used by blues artists! In 1963, Dylan was ""one of the people"", at one with his audience, interacting with them on and off stage.

Songs from 1964:
Mr. Tambourine Man, It Ain't Me Babe*, With God On Our Side, Chimes of Freedom. Never seen Dylan smile so much as when he's with Baez. Enjoy listening to them harmonize, even if it's improvised and sloppy. Baez has a more powerful voice than I had heard before. Mr Tambourine Man hadn't been recorded yet when he performed it. In 1964, Dylan was rising above his audience, becoming less reachable, and talking to them from his stage. Not sure that he was enjoying the celebrity status and the weight of expectations thrown upon him. You can see how becomes more cynical, partly as a defense mechanism.

Songs from 1965:
All I Really Want to Do, If You Gotta Go Go Now*, Love Minus Zero/No Limit, Maggie's Farm*, Like a Rolling Stone*, Mr Tambourine Man, It's All Over Now Baby Blue*. He's strumming the guitar more now instead of finger picking it, and playing more rhythmically, so that even the acoustic numbers now suggest the feel of a backing band. Also, by using a capo so much, his acoustic songs are usually only based on a few chords, in the folk tradition. His rock type songs have more chords. It's cool to see how much more agile his voice was when he was young. The band plays well, in Dylan's manner of jamming. The crowd has mixed reactions, only about half are booing him during the electric set and the crowd still wants an encore, which he gives acoustically. In 1965, Dylan is a star/celebrity and distanced from the audience. He's in his own world and talks at them but not with them. The look is different, he's got his walls of defense up and he really wants to be accepted in the rock world too. I think he was hoping the fans would follow and he was genuinely hurt and taken off-guard at their reaction. It also shows that he was never thinking about the folkies' expectations in the first place and never out for them. After all the support and love they gave him, he turned out to be their Judas indeed. However, Dylan truly loved folk (along with rock and blues and country) and his music was true, if only to himself --- therefore it is not true that he waved the folk flag of convenience until he was popular enough to gain acceptance into the rock world.

A few other thoughts after watching this:

Surprising how soon after he met the Beatles that they BOTH changed. On the Beatles' next albums (Help!, Beatles For Sale, Rubber Soul) we see acoustic numbers and personal lyrics (especially by Lennon). Dylan's next album is half electric and the songs are more musically complex and have more chords in them.

Dylan clearly had (has) a talent for lyrics and song writing. As a singer and performer, he's clearly outclassed by pretty well everyone else. However, in the folk tradition of ""truth"" Dylan's raw voice and playing help dress his songs in the apparel of truth, the bearing of personal thought and soul, etc. He's admired by the other artists as well as the fans. Another thing to remember is that, as important and popular as he was personally, his ""folk"" records never sold as well as those ""rock"" covers of his songs that became hits. Most people never heard Dylan's ""Mr Tambourine Man"" with all the verses, until after the Byrds condensed version became a hit.

This films helps show how important Joan Baez was in popularizing Dylan. Pete Seeger was most important in popularizing folk music and giving it integrity, but it was the rare folk acts like the Kingston Trio and Peter, Paul and Mary who were hugely popular and sold a lot of records. In 1963, Joan Baez was the biggest female folk artist and Dylan's initial acceptance to the folk world was largely due to her support, etc. Their dating helped bring media attention and helped both their careers, in the sense of popularizing them beyond the folk market and into the pop realm, as the ""royal queen and king"" of folk. It's also easy to forget that the Dylan's first album was, in the true folk tradition, all cover songs and that the Dylan we know didn't make his mark until the second album.

It's sad that so few of the folk acts, who were so important and popular at the time, are ignored by contemporary radio. You may hear one or two Peter, Paul and Mary or Kingston Trio songs on the radio but rarely do we hear Joan Baez. The folk movement had plenty of great songs, but most of the artists and songs have become more legendary, more heard about than heard anymore. Except for Dylan, that is!",1455408000,2,6329,4.548726953467955

2960986,3,B000W1V5TM,"For anyone like myself who is a Bob Dylan fan you owe it to yourself to watch this interesting DVD. It is a look back to the very beginning of Bob's career showing his performances at the 1963, '64 and '65 Newport Folk Festival as he was starting to make a name for himself and giving a glimpse of the music legend he was about to become. This video is not perfect in my opinion and I found it a little bit disappointing but still was interesting to watch if for no other reason then to see music history being made.

As already mentioned the DVD looks at Dylan's performances at Newport from '63 through to '65 so it does include the famous moment during his set in 1965 when Dylan ""went electric"". You hear what sounds like boos from the audience as Dylan plugs in but you end up hear cheers at the end too. For anyone who has read or heard about this performance at the '65 Newport Folk Festival here is a chance to get to see a small portion of it. I say small portion because as is with the case with looking back at the 1963 and '64 Newport Folk Festivals as well you are not seeing Dylan's entire sets as they were performed, just parts of it. For instance during his ""65 performance Dylan played more then just a couple of songs on the electric guitar yet two songs total with Dylan plugged in is all you see here.

I can understand that these video recording over the decades may have deteriorated so that it is now impossible to re-master and save portions of these concerts still it is a little frustrating in some cases to only get to see snippets of some of Dylan's performances. On the other hand what parts of the concerts you do get to see have been beautifully restored, more so in fact for the earlier festivals, 1963 and '64. So picture quality is pretty good for what you do get. Sound quality is also pretty good as well.

Also while some of Dylan's performances from all three years at the Newport Folk Festivals are just snippets and small portions there are other performances of his you get in their entirety and this is where the video shines. Some of the best songs on here include ""Talkin' World War III Blues"", ""Only A Pawn In Their Game"", ""Chimes Of Freedom"" and ""If You Gotta Go, Go Now"". There are other appearances by other artists on here as well. Johnny Cash briefly appears singing ""Don't Think Twice, It's Alright"" which makes you wish they showed the entire performance it is that good. There is also a brief clip of Joan Baez doing a second person impersonation of Dylan that is pretty funny. There is also a clip of Joan singing along with Bob to ""With God On Our Side"" trying to harmonize that just doesn't work. As much as I love Joan Baez I just wanted to yell at her on the screen to shut up and let Bob sing by himself. There is also a performance from 1963 of Bob singing ""Blowin' In The Wind"" with Joan, Pete Seeger, Peter, Paul and Mary and The Freedom Singers singing back up that is interesting.

The most interesting part to watching this video is seeing the changes in Bob from his first appearance at Newport in '63 to his last performance in '65. In 1963 Dylan is a 22 year old kid who is a little gawky and shy but you see in him a promise of what he is to become. By 1965 there is a maturity to him in look, presence and music that tells you he has become a force musically that is going to effect society for a long time to come. So while this video may be a bit frustrating to watch it is still worthwhile to do so. Probably only the most die hard Dylan fan will want to add this video to their collection but for anyone who claims to be a fan of music you owe it to yourself to see this DVD because there is some important music history taking place here that does make this DVD worthwhile to see.",1428969600,,3756,4.227019498607242

So this show is something to see and something to be. Folk is at a crossroads. Dylan pushed the invisibe envelope. Next thing ya' know, we're listening to the Byrds, the Turtles, the Mamas & the Pappas and (god forbid) the Lovin' Spoonful!

You know, the guy who thinks he ""stayed in Mississippi a day too long"".
Or he who believes it's ""not dark yet"".
Or maybe the guy who retold the Titanic story on his newest CD, ""Tempest"".

If that's all you know of Bob, you must be in the first half of your life.
Surely not someone who first became a ""Dylan freak"" in 1964, about the same time he latched on to the Beatles.

Well, ""The Other Side of the Mirror"" takes you back to that period when I first ""met"" Bob.
No, never actually MET the dude.
Although you might think so by how much my life has been ""mirrored"" throughout his legendary 50-plus years career!!

There's too much to say about Dylan in a short critique.
Hell, in ten BOOKS!!

All I can say is, buy this incredible DVD.
It takes you into the heart of about 20 Dylan songs, as performed at the once-iconic Newport Folk Festival in the mid 60's (1963-64-65).
The picture is as clear as day, as is the audio, with close-ups of Dylan's baby face and flying hair.
His one-time lover, Joan Baez, joins him in some delightful intimate duets and laughabouts.

The 83 minutes flow along, segueing from year to year.

In the first segment (though not really divided), best part is the old traditional flavor of the folk era he walked through.
He embraced it, loved it, then moved on.
In the 1964 segment, he sings a great version of ""Chimes of Freedom"".

I remember going to concerts back then, hearing people wonder at how he could remember all those intricate painterly lyrics!

The last part is that infamous 1965 Festival, when his ""fans"" booed when he ""went electric"" for the first time at a FOLK festival!!

He does two of my (and everyone's) favorite songs, ""Maggie's Farm"" and ""Like a Rolling Stone"".
And yes, you do hear the boos!

So what does Dylan do?
He tells them ""It's All Over Now, Baby Blue"", then floats off into the gravelly blue yonder!!

What was I doing in the sixties when this film was made and Dylan was becoming a star: I was busy  working to earn a living. Do/did I understand what this audience was feeling about themselves and the world: No, I was years over thirty and had already performed my military service in an earlier war than that which the young men in these audiences were so terrified over the possibility of being drafted to serve in. Does that mean I did not enjoy this documentary: not at all;  while the sentiments expressed by Dylan and the folk singing tradition were both quite familiar to one who was a child in the thirties and a college student in the forties, Lerner, who is of the same vintage as I,  was able to surmount time and place, by an admirable job of filming and editing, letting the performances speak for themselves.dI would certainly recommend the film for those too young or too old to have shared the experience, as well as those who can relive a part of their youth here.",1260576000,11,1037,4.447368421052632

He is the best folk singer of all time. He made his name on the poetry and the unique delivery. It's not that he was bad as a rock act. But the audience couldn't hear the brilliant words due to the volume of the backup band.

They paid to see the brilliant genius playing acoustic and wailing. Coming out with a different style was a big turnoff. It would be like going to a Stones concert and

2961022,5,B000W1V5TM,"Were we ever really that young? That is the first reaction I had in viewing this film. A young Bob Dylan featured with his lady at the time (I believe, if memory serves) a young Joan Baez. And who, at least for the controversial 1965 concert (where he did that taboo couple of electrified guitar numbers that freaked the old-time folkies out) had this reviewer as part of his audience. I am not altogether sure that in the end Bob Dylan cared one way or the other whether he was the voice of a generation, my generation, the generation of '68 but in this very well configured musical documentary there is certainly a case to be made for that proposition. This is the high tide of  Dylan's career as an acoustic folk performer making the transition to, for lack of a better term, folk rock or just flat out rock.

Probably the most important reason to view this documentary, however, is to observe Dylan's visual, vocal and professional transformation during this short two year period. In 1963 Dylan is dressed in the de rigueur work shirt and denim jeans with an unmade bed of a hairdo. His voice is, to be kind, reedy and scratchy, and his songs sung at that time are things like Blowin' in the Wind (done here with Baez and others in an incredible finale) and With God on Our Side (with Baez) reflecting the influence of traditional folk themes  and of a style derived from his early hero Woody Guthrie. Newport 1964 is a transition. The hair is somewhat styled, the outfit more hippie than traditional folk garb, the voice is stronger reflecting the established fact that he is now `king of the hill' in the folk world. And he sings things like the classic Mr. Tambourine Man that give a hint that he is moving away from the tradition idiom.

Newport 1965 gives us the full blown Dylan that we have come not to know. The one that once we think we have him pegged slips away on us. Here we get no mixing it up with Baez or other folkies but a full-bore rock back up band to play Maggie's Farm and one of the anthems for my generation, Like A Rolling Stone. Then back to acoustic with It's All Over Now, Baby Blue and Love Minus Zero, No Limit (which is something of the love song  anthem for my generation or, at least, one of them.  All done in a very strong and confident voice that says here it is, take it or leave it. Wow. You know my answer.

This film, seemingly consciously, shies away from an investigation of any of the controversies of the time concerning the direction of Dylan's work. Pete Seeger's only shot on film, as I recall, was to introduce Dylan at the 1964 festival. The most controversial subjects addressed seem to be whether or not it would throw the schedule off to give into the crowd and have Dylan play longer. Or whether it was okay for the jaded youth of the day to have folk singers as idols. Aside from that shortcoming, which in any case can be pursued elsewhere, this film will go a long way to solving any lingering controversy about whether Mr. Dylan belongs in the folk pantheon.",1217980800,4,3020,4.420863309352518
2961023,5,B000W1V5TM,"Bob Dylan moving from acoustic to electric music reflected the switch the entire society was making from the agricultural and industrial ages to the electrical or computer age.  It also bookmarked the start of the drug revolution, as people turned up the volume and distortion in answer to the mind-blowing stress of the Vietnam War.  Bob Dylan's move led many others to electrical music, from folk, as well.  Bob Dylan was the most influential artist of his age.",1209945600,2,463,4.910256410256411

Whether acoustic or electric, makes no difference to me, he was and still is magnificent! No one likes to get booed. But he still came out with tears in his eyes (after being booed for going electric), and gave us a few more acoustic numbers, in the 1965 Newport Festival. This is a great dvd. Only one thing makes my stomach turn. The sound of Baez's voice. I don't know who's idea it was to pair them together but it was frightful. Thank God for the fast forward button. I have not seen better vintage Bob Dylan performances, than ""The Other Side of the Mirror"". A MUST HAVE for DYLAN fans!",1206489600,4,740,4.21830985915493
2961026,5,B000W1V5TM,"Okay, first off, this is way better than ""Festival"", which is surely terrific itself (particuarly Son House and Buffy Sainte-Marie). But this, a collection from all the Newport Folk Festival Dylan perfomances from his peak years, when he WAS the Greatest, is unbelievable.

Highlights are getting to actually SEE him doing Who Killed Davey Moore?; a thrilling Only A Pawn In Their Game (majestic phrasing); If You Gotta Go, Go Now, which besides being a great song, is one of those clips on here where you go: He's just a kid! A little Jewish boy, kinda small. HOW IN THE HELL DID HE WRITE THESE SONGS AT SUCH A YOUNG AGE?!!
You MUST ask yourself that. If you don't, you don't realize how unbelievable this guy was! His early material gives pause that maybe this is proof there is a God. And I'm an Athiest Jew!

Chimes of Freedom is chilling and heartwarming, man you gotta have this. The best version. One of his best songs.

And of course, the creme de la creme, Dylan's historic '65 performance.
Maggie's Farm, never one of my fave songs of his, is just incredible, with Mike Bloomfield playing the most insane guitar all over the place! It's hard to pick who he sounds like to me, I guess Mike Bloomfield! (reminds me of Link Wray at times??)
of course, the crowd reacts to this mind-blowingly FANTASTIC perfomance, as anyone naturally would: BOO! BOOOOOO!!!

and then Like A Rolling Stone; ah yes, what a perfect F--- You song, especially to play to the once-adoring masses. This version is of course unique amongst all live versions, for two reasons: 1st, the historic reason, they booed, unreal to us that they did, but most of them were in shock, they believed rock 'n' roll was the ultimate sell-out; they had lost THEIR Bobby. Who cares.
The performance is superb, venomous, with again what makes it unique: Bloomfield. I gotta something of him aside from what he did with Dylan.
(This version, played seemingly nonchantly after massive booing, is WAY more punk than anything the widdle sex pistols ever did!)

BUT, the masses get what they need, Dylan with an acoustic. Hooray, the cavalry came, the world is saved. So Dylan, with some notable tears, plays a version of Mr. Tambourine Man. They all cheer, HE's back. Then he follows up with a true goodbye, It's All Over Now, Baby Blue. Great version.
And there you have history right in front of you, to see and hear, really effin' cheap, and all the babies crying about ""waah! this song was cut! my life is ruined!"" -- IGNORE THEM!
This is a piece of genuine history that all Dylan fans should be damn grateful got released, and at this price, how can you complain?

I even enjoy some of the smaller moments, the intimacy of Joan and Bob together, so young, and she's so beautiful. Just a couple of kids.
With ONE having a muse that came from God-knows-where!

This is a must. Don't sit there wondering if it's worth buying, of COURSE it is! If you got the cash, buy it immediately! I'd gladly pay double what I paid! It's worth every penny.

And to all the Dylanologists of the world, this grail-like DVD encapsulates the incredible, fascinating growth of Dylan from Guthrie-esque folk singer to rock star god.  It's hard to believe that the Bobby Dylan of 1963 is the same (very) young man of 1965...so great is the change!

In this study of Dylan at three consecutive Newport folk festivals, we get a wealth of high-quality footage and audio showing Dylan (and Cash and Baez) at workshops and on-stage.  We see his quiet humor of 1963 turn to defiant ambivalence by 1965.  We get a sense of how much this man meant to this festival at this time, and in the final ""It's All Over Now, Baby Blue"" we see a performer ready to break free and move on--regardless of whether or not others are ready to let him go.  In a sense, even the B&W footage is part of the ""vibe"".  The Dylan of Year 1 really belongs to a black & white world...it all seems right.  The Dylan of 1965 begs for color, which he got soon after this performance in the still-unreleased ""Eat The Document"".

Long-time fans or newcomers to Dylan will find plenty to enjoy here, and there are some performances that will be returned to again and again (and again).  At a time when we are being offered some very unnecessary packages (""Dylan"" 3-cd set, anyone?), this is a treasure that I hope doesn't fall through the cracks.  Buy it.

This DVD gives you 20 performances by Dylan over these 3 years and you can see him developing his confidence and performance style. By 1965, backed by an electric band, he rocked out and created quite a controversy from a crowd looking for folky Bob with acoustic guitar and harmonica. Although it is said Bob had a mixed reaction from the crowd, it is clear the boos predominate at the end of the 2 songs performed in this style.

I will say, straight away, I'm not much of a Dylan fan. I've never quite ""gotten it"" with him. With me, I'm sure it has something to do with my musical ear rebelling at the sound of a consistently out-of tune guitar, grating simplistic harmonica playing, and constricted vocalizations. For me, it was another opportunity to extend my experience with the magic of those early Newport Folk Festival years and my admiration and appreciation of the foresight Lerner had in making that footage. This film does allow that as well as more of the brilliance  of a young Joan Baez.

2961057,5,B000W1V5TM,"To begin with--Joan Baez remains stunningly beautiful and as this DVD proves, with an intelligence and depth to match having always been a part of her allure. Her voice only needs to be acknowledged, b/c I honestly can't think of another carrier of song whose voice evokes such emotion from me. Saw her in Munich back in '78, but couldn't get her phone number.

But this is about Dylan, sorry! The breakdown for this DVD is that of getting to watch Dylan evolve from a relatively unknown talent with iconic tendencies into a wise meister who understands his gift (at least enough to challenge all existing boundaries), and has always been, larger than that of those who cling to him in the early stages of jettison.

This process, displayed through black and white period film, captures the young innocent (although he never really was, mind you, none of us are) on stage at Newport News for the first time, singing songs chosen by others, with Joan by his side, goddessing all the way. It's fabulous.

From there, the transition through three years up to the final electric, in your face (although it's significance has blurred down through the years) offering with Mike Bloomfield's bluesy electric leads--can't be ignored if you truly connect with the art and disillusionment.

The Folk movement wanted a cool and hip spokesman, needed one, in fact; and when Dylan outgrew them, simply didn't know what to do with the unleashed monster slinging poetic justice around on the stage. Peter Yarrow is reduced to pathetic whining (no offense, Sir, but you have to admit it's there), begging Dylan to come back and silence the crowd with an acoustic folk number from ages past.

It reminded me of Eastwood's film, ""Unforgiven,"" and the notion that when Justice arrives, it is uncontrollable and nobody's friend. I highly recommend this DVD, especially if you're interested in how truly great artists used to have the freedom to develop during that brief period of time literally on the public stage.",1196553600,6,1996,4.893491124260355

2961059,4,B000W1V5TM,"""The Other Side of the Mirror"" is a brief look at an emerging artist as he developed over a three year period. The music is legendary, moving, and still relevant today. There are no interviews and the music speaks for itself. Although this film uses only the recorded performances from the Newport Folk Festivals of 1963, 1964, and 1965 of Bob Dylan and friends, it is about so much more than that. In the performances from 1963, we see Dylan as a skinny, intense boy, who is wholly consumed by his music, whether performing alone, with Joan Baez, or the cream of the folk music world at that time. By 1964, he is a star, clearly more comfortable with his audience and clearly enjoying his status. The now-infamous 1965 spots with the Hawks backing are prefaced by a performance in the afternoon which was hurried and in which the anticipation of the coming evening's performance was evident. Finally, we see Dylan as he ""goes electric"" and either completely wins over or totally angers his fan base. He ends the set with acoustic versions of ""Mr. Tambourine Man,"" a song about the lure and magic of music, and ""It's All Over Now, Baby Blue,"" his final kiss-off to the folk world. Many writers have commented on Dylan's attitude toward fans and/or the press, but after hearing people booing during 3 consecutive songs, the acoustic performances he gave were not just perfect but an act of generosity and an appeal for understanding. This film is filled with enduring music, performances of the highest caliber by Dylan and others, and a look back at a more hopeful time in our history.",1196208000,9,1585,4.705035971223022

This valuable document lets Dylan speak for himself through his songs. It's fascinating to see how he soared above his contemporaries. Watching him singing ""Mr. Tambourine"" man in the '64 festival is simply breathtaking.

Also powerful are Dylan's stunning electric performances of ""Maggie's Farm"" and ""Like a Rolling Stone"" - received with vociferous boos and cheers from the crowd - followed by some jaded run throughs of ""Mr Tambourine Man"" and ""It's All Over Now Baby Blue"" - the latter a fitting parting gesture to the Newport audience.

Only The Band could meet that high standard later that year when they joined Dylan at the Hollywood Bowl. Who ever thought that this footage existed? The hint was when some of it showed up when Festival and No Direction Home was released this past year. That still begs the question of the film of the English tour that next Fall which showed up only in clips in No Direction Home. The two World Tour releases are not the official films; Murray Lerner must have those. Apparently he shot the Fall 1965 electic/acoustic tour while D. A. Pennebaker shot the Don't Look Back Spring 1965 tour if I am right. The logical thing, now, is to release that footage with The Band minus Levon Helm plus Micky Waller on drums.

Even though these tracks are acoustic, Dylan really showed his incredible songwriting talent. That footage will go down in history. The 1964 stuff is a step down (last 2 songs are pretty good) The famous 1965 stuff is over-rated. The jangly ""Maggie's farm"", is alright, but seems a little tense. ""Like A Rolling Stone"", is virtually flawless. Why anyone would boo that version, is beyond me. The last song, ""It's All Over Now, Baby Blue"" is incredible(Crank this one up).

For all his stumbles, he is after all only a man, Dylan remains THE transformational figure in modern popular music. He is the bridge between the revolution begun by Elvis and taken across the universe by The Beatles.
This dvd, in glorious black and white, captures the earnestness and even more so the unrelenting brilliance of the 22/23/24 year old icon. His voice, though still raspy, is remarkably articulate though nowhere near as articulate as the words that come out of him. It may be marketed as a music dvd, but it is in fact an artifact of history. Amazingly, unlike most historical figures, this one is still current, still alive and still impossible to summarize in three paragraphs.

3195471,5,B000W1V5TM,"This is a fascinating document of Bob Dylan's transition from a buzzworthy newcomer to a genuine American icon.  Without ornamentation or comment, this  disc presents Dylan's impact on the fabled Newport Folk Festival in three pivotal years, 1963-65.  In the early sequences, Dylan sits amid bluegrass and folk legends such as Doc Watson and Pete Seeger, a skinny kid paying his dues, earnestly singing his self-penned emulations of Woody Guthrie's talking blues style.  There's something in the air, though, an electric charge to his aura that makes him stand out amid the studious folk-scene crowd.  In the '64 festival, Dylan is more of a hovering presence, with numerous artists (Joan Baez, Johnny Cash) covering his material and calling him up on stage.  There are episodic clips of Dylan and Baez making googly eyes at one another, and a momentary glimpse of the folk scene's equivalent of Beatles-mania, with Baez interviewed inside a car that drives past a gaggle of adoring fans, making light of her own celebrity.

It's in 1965 that Dylan really emerges as a superstar -- the year before, there was a growing sense that he had outgrown the insularity and strictures of the overly-earnest folk scene, but in '65, when he strapped on an electric guitar and cranked up the volume, it was a clear declaration of independence, one that was met with a predictable mix of condemnation, exhilaration and adoration.  This rift really didn't concern Dylan -- he'd made up his mind which direction he was flying in -- but the moment is still charged with drama and power, and Dylan's personal charisma had shot off the charts.  Even in these oft-times choppy old film clips, he sizzles the very air around him, leaping out off the screen with his puckish, brooding persona metamorphosing moment by moment, an artist who was fully alive and changing the culture around him.

The no-frills presentation is particularly useful -- there are separate commentary tracks, but the main film offers no narration, so you, as the viewer, are free to see and interpret the events for yourself.  Dylan fans, folk devotees and students of popular culture will all find this an invaluable film.  Highly recommended!  (DJ Joe Sixpack)",1193875200,13,2217,4.991847826086956

However, since this film was for big-time Dylan fans, some of the edits are inexplicable. Some intros are left out, but there's a more serious drawback. It includes two versions of Mr. Tambourine Man: one from 1964, before the song was released, as performed during the afternoon workshop, and the other from 1965, after the infamous electric set performed in the evening. NONE of them are complete. The first is missing the third verse, while the fourth is missing the first harmonica break and the last verse.  I know the producer has his reasons, like artistic integrity, but c'mon, they know who the audience for this DVD is...

Also, why couldn't the missing songs from Newport 1963 and 1964 be seen, at least via bonus tracks, in case they were worried about too much song duplication in the film itself?

3195478,4,B000W1V5TM,"This film edits together songs from Dylan's day and night performances at the Newport Folk Festival in 1963/64/65. It does not show Dylan's entire performances from each year. It also includes brief clips of and with other acts (especially Joan Baez, whom Dylan was dating at the time), the audience's reactions, etc. The editing and choices of clips (and choice of omissions) help the viewer see first hand how Dylan was perceived and treated by the masses and how his confidence grew and persona and style changed over those 3 years. It makes it much easier for a modern viewer to understand the controversy felt when Dylan included an electric set with a band in 1965.

For this reason, I think it is a valuable film. The footage remains raw and grainy, not remastered, but the image and sound are decent for the time and intended effect. There's a lot of footage I've never seen. For the price I highly recommend this DVD. It's well packaged and includes a short but informative booklet.

Here's a listing of the songs (an * denotes my personal favs) and some personal notes after only 1 viewing.

Songs from 1963:
North Country Blues, With God On Our Side, Talkin' World War 3 Blues, Who Killed Day Moore*, Only a Pawn In Their Game, Blowin' In the Wind*. In 1963, Dylan really seems like a Woody Guthrie imitator, almost ""acting"" the role at times. The introduction he's given shows how much the folk world expected him to be the ""saviour"" of folk music, the ""spokesman and poet"" of his generation, etc. That's a lot of unnecessary weight thrown at a new artist and Dylan later proves he was never in it for others. In 1963, he's loving the attention, power and freedom. It's also funny how his talking songs are so like rapping, and by 1963 this was already a old style used by blues artists! In 1963, Dylan was ""one of the people"", at one with his audience, interacting with them on and off stage.

Songs from 1964:
Mr. Tambourine Man, It Ain't Me Babe*, With God On Our Side, Chimes of Freedom. Never seen Dylan smile so much as when he's with Baez. Enjoy listening to them harmonize, even if it's improvised and sloppy. Baez has a more powerful voice than I had heard before. Mr Tambourine Man hadn't been recorded yet when he performed it. In 1964, Dylan was rising above his audience, becoming less reachable, and talking to them from his stage. Not sure that he was enjoying the celebrity status and the weight of expectations thrown upon him. You can see how becomes more cynical, partly as a defense mechanism.

Songs from 1965:
All I Really Want to Do, If You Gotta Go Go Now*, Love Minus Zero/No Limit, Maggie's Farm*, Like a Rolling Stone*, Mr Tambourine Man, It's All Over Now Baby Blue*. He's strumming the guitar more now instead of finger picking it, and playing more rhythmically, so that even the acoustic numbers now suggest the feel of a backing band. Also, by using a capo so much, his acoustic songs are usually only based on a few chords, in the folk tradition. His rock type songs have more chords. It's cool to see how much more agile his voice was when he was young. The band plays well, in Dylan's manner of jamming. The crowd has mixed reactions, only about half are booing him during the electric set and the crowd still wants an encore, which he gives acoustically. In 1965, Dylan is a star/celebrity and distanced from the audience. He's in his own world and talks at them but not with them. The look is different, he's got his walls of defense up and he really wants to be accepted in the rock world too. I think he was hoping the fans would follow and he was genuinely hurt and taken off-guard at their reaction. It also shows that he was never thinking about the folkies' expectations in the first place and never out for them. After all the support and love they gave him, he turned out to be their Judas indeed. However, Dylan truly loved folk (along with rock and blues and country) and his music was true, if only to himself --- therefore it is not true that he waved the folk flag of convenience until he was popular enough to gain acceptance into the rock world.

A few other thoughts after watching this:

Surprising how soon after he met the Beatles that they BOTH changed. On the Beatles' next albums (Help!, Beatles For Sale, Rubber Soul) we see acoustic numbers and personal lyrics (especially by Lennon). Dylan's next album is half electric and the songs are more musically complex and have more chords in them.

Dylan clearly had (has) a talent for lyrics and song writing. As a singer and performer, he's clearly outclassed by pretty well everyone else. However, in the folk tradition of ""truth"" Dylan's raw voice and playing help dress his songs in the apparel of truth, the bearing of personal thought and soul, etc. He's admired by the other artists as well as the fans. Another thing to remember is that, as important and popular as he was personally, his ""folk"" records never sold as well as those ""rock"" covers of his songs that became hits. Most people never heard Dylan's ""Mr Tambourine Man"" with all the verses, until after the Byrds condensed version became a hit.

This films helps show how important Joan Baez was in popularizing Dylan. Pete Seeger was most important in popularizing folk music and giving it integrity, but it was the rare folk acts like the Kingston Trio and Peter, Paul and Mary who were hugely popular and sold a lot of records. In 1963, Joan Baez was the biggest female folk artist and Dylan's initial acceptance to the folk world was largely due to her support, etc. Their dating helped bring media attention and helped both their careers, in the sense of popularizing them beyond the folk market and into the pop realm, as the ""royal queen and king"" of folk. It's also easy to forget that the Dylan's first album was, in the true folk tradition, all cover songs and that the Dylan we know didn't make his mark until the second album.

It's sad that so few of the folk acts, who were so important and popular at the time, are ignored by contemporary radio. You may hear one or two Peter, Paul and Mary or Kingston Trio songs on the radio but rarely do we hear Joan Baez. The folk movement had plenty of great songs, but most of the artists and songs have become more legendary, more heard about than heard anymore. Except for Dylan, that is!",1455408000,2,6329,4.548726953467955

3195483,3,B000W1V5TM,"For anyone like myself who is a Bob Dylan fan you owe it to yourself to watch this interesting DVD. It is a look back to the very beginning of Bob's career showing his performances at the 1963, '64 and '65 Newport Folk Festival as he was starting to make a name for himself and giving a glimpse of the music legend he was about to become. This video is not perfect in my opinion and I found it a little bit disappointing but still was interesting to watch if for no other reason then to see music history being made.

As already mentioned the DVD looks at Dylan's performances at Newport from '63 through to '65 so it does include the famous moment during his set in 1965 when Dylan ""went electric"". You hear what sounds like boos from the audience as Dylan plugs in but you end up hear cheers at the end too. For anyone who has read or heard about this performance at the '65 Newport Folk Festival here is a chance to get to see a small portion of it. I say small portion because as is with the case with looking back at the 1963 and '64 Newport Folk Festivals as well you are not seeing Dylan's entire sets as they were performed, just parts of it. For instance during his ""65 performance Dylan played more then just a couple of songs on the electric guitar yet two songs total with Dylan plugged in is all you see here.

I can understand that these video recording over the decades may have deteriorated so that it is now impossible to re-master and save portions of these concerts still it is a little frustrating in some cases to only get to see snippets of some of Dylan's performances. On the other hand what parts of the concerts you do get to see have been beautifully restored, more so in fact for the earlier festivals, 1963 and '64. So picture quality is pretty good for what you do get. Sound quality is also pretty good as well.

Also while some of Dylan's performances from all three years at the Newport Folk Festivals are just snippets and small portions there are other performances of his you get in their entirety and this is where the video shines. Some of the best songs on here include ""Talkin' World War III Blues"", ""Only A Pawn In Their Game"", ""Chimes Of Freedom"" and ""If You Gotta Go, Go Now"". There are other appearances by other artists on here as well. Johnny Cash briefly appears singing ""Don't Think Twice, It's Alright"" which makes you wish they showed the entire performance it is that good. There is also a brief clip of Joan Baez doing a second person impersonation of Dylan that is pretty funny. There is also a clip of Joan singing along with Bob to ""With God On Our Side"" trying to harmonize that just doesn't work. As much as I love Joan Baez I just wanted to yell at her on the screen to shut up and let Bob sing by himself. There is also a performance from 1963 of Bob singing ""Blowin' In The Wind"" with Joan, Pete Seeger, Peter, Paul and Mary and The Freedom Singers singing back up that is interesting.

The most interesting part to watching this video is seeing the changes in Bob from his first appearance at Newport in '63 to his last performance in '65. In 1963 Dylan is a 22 year old kid who is a little gawky and shy but you see in him a promise of what he is to become. By 1965 there is a maturity to him in look, presence and music that tells you he has become a force musically that is going to effect society for a long time to come. So while this video may be a bit frustrating to watch it is still worthwhile to do so. Probably only the most die hard Dylan fan will want to add this video to their collection but for anyone who claims to be a fan of music you owe it to yourself to see this DVD because there is some important music history taking place here that does make this DVD worthwhile to see.",1428969600,,3756,4.227019498607242

3195496,5,B000W1V5TM,"Think the Dylan you know is this gravel-voiced ancient warrior of the past 16 years?
You know, the guy who thinks he ""stayed in Mississippi a day too long"".
Or he who believes it's ""not dark yet"".
Or maybe the guy who retold the Titanic story on his newest CD, ""Tempest"".

If that's all you know of Bob, you must be in the first half of your life.
Surely not someone who first became a ""Dylan freak"" in 1964, about the same time he latched on to the Beatles.

Well, ""The Other Side of the Mirror"" takes you back to that period when I first ""met"" Bob.
No, never actually MET the dude.
Although you might think so by how much my life has been ""mirrored"" throughout his legendary 50-plus years career!!

There's too much to say about Dylan in a short critique.
Hell, in ten BOOKS!!

All I can say is, buy this incredible DVD.
It takes you into the heart of about 20 Dylan songs, as performed at the once-iconic Newport Folk Festival in the mid 60's (1963-64-65).
The picture is as clear as day, as is the audio, with close-ups of Dylan's baby face and flying hair.
His one-time lover, Joan Baez, joins him in some delightful intimate duets and laughabouts.

The 83 minutes flow along, segueing from year to year.

In the first segment (though not really divided), best part is the old traditional flavor of the folk era he walked through.
He embraced it, loved it, then moved on.
In the 1964 segment, he sings a great version of ""Chimes of Freedom"".

I remember going to concerts back then, hearing people wonder at how he could remember all those intricate painterly lyrics!

The last part is that infamous 1965 Festival, when his ""fans"" booed when he ""went electric"" for the first time at a FOLK festival!!

He does two of my (and everyone's) favorite songs, ""Maggie's Farm"" and ""Like a Rolling Stone"".
And yes, you do hear the boos!

So what does Dylan do?
He tells them ""It's All Over Now, Baby Blue"", then floats off into the gravelly blue yonder!!

You will LOVE this!!",1385683200,3,1972,4.45

3195519,5,B000W1V5TM,"Were we ever really that young? That is the first reaction I had in viewing this film. A young Bob Dylan featured with his lady at the time (I believe, if memory serves) a young Joan Baez. And who, at least for the controversial 1965 concert (where he did that taboo couple of electrified guitar numbers that freaked the old-time folkies out) had this reviewer as part of his audience. I am not altogether sure that in the end Bob Dylan cared one way or the other whether he was the voice of a generation, my generation, the generation of '68 but in this very well configured musical documentary there is certainly a case to be made for that proposition. This is the high tide of  Dylan's career as an acoustic folk performer making the transition to, for lack of a better term, folk rock or just flat out rock.

Probably the most important reason to view this documentary, however, is to observe Dylan's visual, vocal and professional transformation during this short two year period. In 1963 Dylan is dressed in the de rigueur work shirt and denim jeans with an unmade bed of a hairdo. His voice is, to be kind, reedy and scratchy, and his songs sung at that time are things like Blowin' in the Wind (done here with Baez and others in an incredible finale) and With God on Our Side (with Baez) reflecting the influence of traditional folk themes  and of a style derived from his early hero Woody Guthrie. Newport 1964 is a transition. The hair is somewhat styled, the outfit more hippie than traditional folk garb, the voice is stronger reflecting the established fact that he is now `king of the hill' in the folk world. And he sings things like the classic Mr. Tambourine Man that give a hint that he is moving away from the tradition idiom.

Newport 1965 gives us the full blown Dylan that we have come not to know. The one that once we think we have him pegged slips away on us. Here we get no mixing it up with Baez or other folkies but a full-bore rock back up band to play Maggie's Farm and one of the anthems for my generation, Like A Rolling Stone. Then back to acoustic with It's All Over Now, Baby Blue and Love Minus Zero, No Limit (which is something of the love song  anthem for my generation or, at least, one of them.  All done in a very strong and confident voice that says here it is, take it or leave it. Wow. You know my answer.

This film, seemingly consciously, shies away from an investigation of any of the controversies of the time concerning the direction of Dylan's work. Pete Seeger's only shot on film, as I recall, was to introduce Dylan at the 1964 festival. The most controversial subjects addressed seem to be whether or not it would throw the schedule off to give into the crowd and have Dylan play longer. Or whether it was okay for the jaded youth of the day to have folk singers as idols. Aside from that shortcoming, which in any case can be pursued elsewhere, this film will go a long way to solving any lingering controversy about whether Mr. Dylan belongs in the folk pantheon.",1217980800,4,3020,4.420863309352518
3195520,5,B000W1V5TM,"Bob Dylan moving from acoustic to electric music reflected the switch the entire society was making from the agricultural and industrial ages to the electrical or computer age.

Bob Dylan's move led many others to electrical music, from folk, as well.  Bob Dylan was the most influential artist of his age.",1209945600,2,463,4.910256410256411

But he still came out with tears in his eyes (after being booed for going electric), and gave us a few more acoustic numbers, in the 1965 Newport Festival. This is a great dvd. Only one thing makes my stomach turn. The sound of Baez's voice. I don't know who's idea it was to pair them together but it was frightful. Thank God for the fast forward button.

3195523,5,B000W1V5TM,"Okay, first off, this is way better than ""Festival"", which is surely terrific itself (particuarly Son House and Buffy Sainte-Marie). But this, a collection from all the Newport Folk Festival Dylan perfomances from his peak years, when he WAS the Greatest, is unbelievable.

Highlights are getting to actually SEE him doing Who Killed Davey Moore?; a thrilling Only A Pawn In Their Game (majestic phrasing); If You Gotta Go, Go Now, which besides being a great song, is one of those clips on here where you go: He's just a kid! A little Jewish boy, kinda small. HOW IN THE HELL DID HE WRITE THESE SONGS AT SUCH A YOUNG AGE?!!
You MUST ask yourself that. If you don't, you don't realize how unbelievable this guy was! His early material gives pause that maybe this is proof there is a God. And I'm an Athiest Jew!

Chimes of Freedom is chilling and heartwarming, man you gotta have this. The best version. One of his best songs.

And of course, the creme de la creme, Dylan's historic '65 performance.
Maggie's Farm, never one of my fave songs of his, is just incredible, with Mike Bloomfield playing the most insane guitar all over the place! It's hard to pick who he sounds like to me, I guess Mike Bloomfield! (reminds me of Link Wray at times??)
of course, the crowd reacts to this mind-blowingly FANTASTIC perfomance, as anyone naturally would: BOO! BOOOOOO!!!

and then Like A Rolling Stone; ah yes, what a perfect F--- You song, especially to play to the once-adoring masses. This version is of course unique amongst all live versions, for two reasons: 1st, the historic reason, they booed, unreal to us that they did, but most of them were in shock, they believed rock 'n' roll was the ultimate sell-out; they had lost THEIR Bobby. Who cares.
The performance is superb, venomous, with again what makes it unique: Bloomfield. I gotta something of him aside from what he did with Dylan.
(This version, played seemingly nonchantly after massive booing, is WAY more punk than anything the widdle sex pistols ever did!)

BUT, the masses get what they need, Dylan with an acoustic. Hooray, the cavalry came, the world is saved. So Dylan, with some notable tears, plays a version of Mr. Tambourine Man. They all cheer, HE's back. Then he follows up with a true goodbye, It's All Over Now, Baby Blue. Great version.
And there you have history right in front of you, to see and hear, really effin' cheap, and all the babies crying about ""waah! this song was cut! my life is ruined!"" -- IGNORE THEM!
This is a piece of genuine history that all Dylan fans should be damn grateful got released, and at this price, how can you complain?

I even enjoy some of the smaller moments, the intimacy of Joan and Bob together, so young, and she's so beautiful. Just a couple of kids.
With ONE having a muse that came from God-knows-where!

This is a must. Don't sit there wondering if it's worth buying, of COURSE it is! If you got the cash, buy it immediately! I'd gladly pay double what I paid! It's worth every penny.

And to all the Dylanologists of the world, this grail-like DVD encapsulates the incredible, fascinating growth of Dylan from Guthrie-esque folk singer to rock star god.  It's hard to believe that the Bobby Dylan of 1963 is the same (very) young man of 1965...so great is the change!

In this study of Dylan at three consecutive Newport folk festivals, we get a wealth of high-quality footage and audio showing Dylan (and Cash and Baez) at workshops and on-stage.  We see his quiet humor of 1963 turn to defiant ambivalence by 1965.  We get a sense of how much this man meant to this festival at this time, and in the final ""It's All Over Now, Baby Blue"" we see a performer ready to break free and move on--regardless of whether or not others are ready to let him go.  In a sense, even the B&W footage is part of the ""vibe"".  The Dylan of Year 1 really belongs to a black & white world...it all seems right.  The Dylan of 1965 begs for color, which he got soon after this performance in the still-unreleased ""Eat The Document"".

Long-time fans or newcomers to Dylan will find plenty to enjoy here, and there are some performances that will be returned to again and again (and again).  At a time when we are being offered some very unnecessary packages (""Dylan"" 3-cd set, anyone?), this is a treasure that I hope doesn't fall through the cracks.  Buy it.

I will say, straight away, I'm not much of a Dylan fan. I've never quite ""gotten it"" with him. With me, I'm sure it has something to do with my musical ear rebelling at the sound of a consistently out-of tune guitar, grating simplistic harmonica playing, and constricted vocalizations. For me, it was another opportunity to extend my experience with the magic of those early Newport Folk Festival years and my admiration and appreciation of the foresight Lerner had in making that footage. This film does allow that as well as more of the brilliance  of a young Joan Baez. Through this film you can see how ""The Times were All A'changin"" by the affect Dylan was having on the crowd as his music evolved from 1963 to his ""going electric"" in 1965. So, while I endured 90 minutes of exclusive Dylan, I did enjoy the experience and opportunity to relive that era.",1199577600,4,1141,4.791878172588833

3195544,5,B000W1V5TM,This surprisingly good looking and sounding DVD shows Bob Dylan when he was only about 20 years old. His talent at that age is amazing. Finally this long bootlegged video has been done right. The picture and recording is very clean for about a 45 year old performance. All other Bob Dylan DVD's are marred by too much talk in that boring documentary style and not enough music. But this is all music. If you like Bob Dylan you'll love this DVD.,1199232000,,444,4.426829268292683

Paul Butterfield is there as he is sitting on the side in one scene, and the original video I saw had him playing with Dylan

3195547,5,B000W1V5TM,"We've seen snippets of Dylan's performances at the Newport Folk Festivals in the past, but it was great to see entire songs. They are testimony to the vitality of Bob's music of the day and you can just see his intensity that is about to revolutionize rock'n'roll. Also what a delight it is to see Joan Baez in her prime. It's also a terrific reminder of how powerful great artists are when they have something to say and just get up on stage and sing and play--no half-naked dancers and boy-toys, no smoke and fireworks. It knocks your socks off.",1198195200,3,547,4.48

3195551,5,B000W1V5TM,"Well, it took 40 years for this material to be released but it was worth the wait.  Best parts: Chimes of Freedom, the guy who tries to introduce an act after Dylan just played, Joan Baez, the warm-ups with the electric band, the afternoon sessions.  It's all amazing.  A great companion to Don't Look Back.  And as I mentioned, worth ten times the 13 coins I dropped on it.

3195552,4,B000W1V5TM,"Caught an airing of this on a WTTW (Chicago PBS) fundraiser this weekend, and then a review of the DVD on NPR.  It's an important piece in its own right, but apparently just an excerpt of what by all accounts is a much larger and more important work by the director.  Lerner filmed extensively at Newport and produced a documentary entitled Festival - the Dylan pieces are excerpted from that larger work.  The quality of the film and audio in the Dylan sets makes me desperate to see the full documentary. Hopefully a positive reception of The Other Side of the Mirror will spur th the release of Festival to a larger audience.  The current DVD is a great peak at Dylan as he enters the national awareness.",1196726400,3,707,4.5

This is a must-have DVD which provides rare footage of Bob, Joan Baez and others live at Newport over a critical two year period in Dylan's life.  The performances are very impressive, and the final performance of ""It's All Over Now"" is a fitting finale for his shift from acoustic sound to electric.  There are no interviews, just wall to wall songs with a separate interview with the man who created the compilation and footage.",1196553600,2,684,6.588888888888889
3195554,5,B000W1V5TM,"To begin with--Joan Baez remains stunningly beautiful and as this DVD proves, with an intelligence and depth to match having always been a part of her allure. Her voice only needs to be acknowledged, b/c I honestly can't think of another carrier of song whose voice evokes such emotion from me. Saw her in Munich back in '78, but couldn't get her phone number.

But this is about Dylan, sorry! The breakdown for this DVD is that of getting to watch Dylan evolve from a relatively unknown talent with iconic tendencies into a wise meister who understands his gift (at least enough to challenge all existing boundaries), and has always been, larger than that of those who cling to him in the early stages of jettison.

This process, displayed through black and white period film, captures the young innocent (although he never really was, mind you, none of us are) on stage at Newport News for the first time, singing songs chosen by others, with Joan by his side, goddessing all the way. It's fabulous.

From there, the transition through three years up to the final electric, in your face (although it's significance has blurred down through the years) offering with Mike Bloomfield's bluesy electric leads--can't be ignored if you truly connect with the art and disillusionment.

The Folk movement wanted a cool and hip spokesman, needed one, in fact; and when Dylan outgrew them, simply didn't know what to do with the unleashed monster slinging poetic justice around on the stage. Peter Yarrow is reduced to pathetic whining (no offense, Sir, but you have to admit it's there), begging Dylan to come back and silence the crowd with an acoustic folk number from ages past.

It reminded me of Eastwood's film, ""Unforgiven,"" and the notion that when Justice arrives, it is uncontrollable and nobody's friend. I highly recommend this DVD, especially if you're interested in how truly great artists used to have the freedom to develop during that brief period of time literally on the public stage.",1196553600,6,1996,4.893491124260355
3195555,5,B000W1V5TM,Greatly enjoyed the old film footage although much of the footage was included in an earlier film seen also done by Murray Lerner.  The interview with Lerner was excellent.,1196380800,2,172,4.931034482758621
3195556,4,B000W1V5TM,"""The Other Side of the Mirror"" is a brief look at an emerging artist as he developed over a three year period. The music is legendary, moving, and still relevant today. There are no interviews and the music speaks for itself. Although this film uses only the recorded performances from the Newport Folk Festivals of 1963, 1964, and 1965 of Bob Dylan and friends, it is about so much more than that. In the performances from 1963, we see Dylan as a skinny, intense boy, who is wholly consumed by his music, whether performing alone, with Joan Baez, or the cream of the folk music world at that time. By 1964, he is a star, clearly more comfortable with his audience and clearly enjoying his status. The now-infamous 1965 spots with the Hawks backing are prefaced by a performance in the afternoon which was hurried and in which the anticipation of the coming evening's performance was evident. Finally, we see Dylan as he ""goes electric"" and either completely wins over or totally angers his fan base. He ends the set with acoustic versions of ""Mr. Tambourine Man,"" a song about the lure and magic of music, and ""It's All Over Now, Baby Blue,"" his final kiss-off to the folk world. Many writers have commented on Dylan's attitude toward fans and/or the press, but after hearing people booing during 3 consecutive songs, the acoustic performances he gave were not just perfect but an act of generosity and an appeal for understanding. This film is filled with enduring music, performances of the highest caliber by Dylan and others, and a look back at a more hopeful time in our history.",1196208000,9,1585,4.705035971223022
3195557,3,B000W1V5TM,"Worth the price for just the 65 Newport scenes - Could have use more complete versions of songs (particularly Cash and the whole '65 electric show) - Those interested in folk Bob should purchase ""Don't Look Back"" and electric Dylan should go for ""No Direction Home""",1196121600,5,265,4.782608695652174
3195558,5,B000W1V5TM,"Here we see the American musical and poetic genius Bob Dylan turn from a shy folk-singer into the electric guitar-powered rock legend we know today. This transition has parallels to The Beatles who also turned from fresh-faced innocents into world-weary veterans within a few short years.

This valuable document lets Dylan speak for himself through his songs. It's fascinating to see how he soared above his contemporaries. Watching him singing ""Mr. Tambourine"" man in the '64 festival is simply breathtaking.

Also powerful are Dylan's stunning electric performances of ""Maggie's Farm"" and ""Like a Rolling Stone"" - received with vociferous boos and cheers from the crowd - followed by some jaded run throughs of ""Mr Tambourine Man"" and ""It's All Over Now Baby Blue"" - the latter a fitting parting gesture to the Newport audience.

Sadly this DVD is over all too quickly, but it is an absolute must-have for all those with an interest in Dylan.",1195948800,4,945,5.044871794871795

3195561,5,B000W1V5TM,"A brilliant depiction of Dylan's progression from bumpkin-savant (sharing a stage with Doc Watson and Clarence Ashley) to rock star iconoclast (black leather jacket & Stratocaster). If you're a Dylan fan you've seen elements of these performances over the years, but this is the first time where the legendary 1965 performance with the Butterfield band is really SEEN and heard in detail and context. Fantastic! I don't want to spoil the moment for those who have not yet seen, but let's just say there are no reaction shots of aghast folkies nor is Pete Seeger seen wielding an ax. The the audience reaction, however, is telling. And Dylan's return to the stage with an acoustic guitar even more so. Simply sublime.",1195430400,3,716,4.925619834710743

3195563,5,B000W1V5TM,"If you're already a fan of Dylan and know the history surrounding the progression of Newport performances this is a great DVD to watch.
