159266,1,0793961009,"This movie is so awful, it's almost not worth reviewing. The last half of the movie is lit in a flickering irritating red light, which makes it completely unwatchable. No doubt was this movie intended for teens only.  But the bad guy here is really MTV, having done more damage to the  movie-industry than anyone or anything else.",928713600,2,330,4.672413793103448
159267,3,0793961009,"In Speed 2, a sequel of the original Speed, Annie (Sandra Bullock) takes you to a cruise for another speed adventure. The first half of the movie is trashy.  Here she got romantically involved with Jason Patric, another LAPD  officer.  And what happened to Keanu Reeves, her boyfriend of the first  movie?  Something is real missing here.  This sequel should connect her  previous romance which will make it better.  Anyway, the movie picks up  interest when the speeding cruise ship approaches an oil tanker and to a  cliff and to a populated harbor.  Despite of the annoying ship, the movie  takes some shots of the beautiful Caribbean hospitality, otherwise, the  movie is all trashy.",927072000,,687,4.921052631578948

159302,1,0793961009,"I am a huge fan of the first Speed with Keanu Reeves and various action films, but this film is totally awful for many reasons: the story is completely imbecilic, a cruise ship can't go fast, Jason Patric plays an unlikeable male lead, Jason Patric and Sandra Bullock have no chemistry, the film was chopped down to a PG-13 while the first film was rated R, Willem Dafoe plays a lame villain, there's little to NO action in this film and the film is boring. However, some of the special effects are good, but that's about it. You want a better action film that came out 20 years earlier? I'd recommend Air Force One. That film has a LOT of adrenaline pumping action and is much better than this mess.",1489190400,,700,4.392307692307693

159336,2,0793961009,The first third was fun leading up to the action. The middle third was painful; the lights were out in the ship except for the flashing emergency lights so you are watching the action through a strobe effect. Very hard to watch. The last third was just plain silly. I've watched Speed a few times and enjoyed it. I won't watch Speed 2 again.,1469750400,,341,4.34375
159337,3,0793961009,"You all remember a bus speeding through Los Angeles, forced to remain above fifty miles per hour or be destroyed in a bomb blast. You remember a dashing hero and a lady right behind him. You remember the cunning mastermind behind all that. Well, this sequel kind of has thatsort ofmaybe.
  First off, Keanu Reeves does not return for this film. As someone who doesnt have an opinion about this man one way or another, its not a tragic loss. It is tragic that his replacement is nothing more than a pretty action hero. Jason Patric was there to be Sandra Bullocks arm candy.
  While the villain in the first film was crazy, Willem Dafoe comes in and makes it clear he wants a cell in Arkham Asylum. He tries his hardest to show how off the rails he is and theres the problem. His anger and motivation could have worked but he took it too far.
  Some have said that this film is as slow as its predecessor is fast, at least when it comes to transportation modes, but that it isn't quite accurate. If the film moved as slow as the ship, how could the filmmakers squeeze in so many obstacles, problems, and life-threatening situations? This movie was so full of them that it eventually seemed like the actors weren't saying their lines but were instead bemoaning the fact that filming wasn't over yetwatch the movie and youll find the spot Im talking aboutitll give you one good laugh.
  Is this the worst sequel ever? No. Is it overblown with action and explosions and illogical situations? Yes. In the end, the cast does the best with what theyve got. So, if you're a completist like me and need the whole series, pick up this film. Otherwise, youll be fine with just Speed, unless you really want that before-mentioned laugh.

159389,4,0793961009,"First of all I really enjoyed the 1994 movie ""Speed' starring Keanu Reeves, Sandra Bullock,& Dennis Hopper. It was the best action thriller I've seen  since  Die Hard ! However I did enjoy the 1997 sequel  ''Speed 2: Cruise Control"" as much as I did the first speed. Even though Keanu didn't want nothing to do with the sequel in which I was disappointed about, in which Reeves was replaced with actor Jason Patric who starred in the movie ''the Lost Boys'', which I thought who did an amazing job portraying Alex Shaw, in which he plays Annie's (bullock) new boyfriend. I  liked the fact that Jan DeBont  brought back Sandra Bullock to reprise her role as Annie Porter. Also I like the new villain Geiger who was portrayed by Willem Dafoe who later played the villain  '' The Green Goblin'' in the 2002 movie Spider-Man, which I thought Geiger  was really crazy in the movie . Fun fact, both Speed 1 &2 came out a year before me and my brother were born. Speed came out in1994, and my brother was born in 1995, and Speed 2: Cruise Control came out in 1997, and I was born in 1998 ! Isn't that an amazing fun fact ! All in all I give Speed 2: Cruise Control 4/5 stars.  Good movieHold on to your life jackets !",1451001600,3,1210,4.299559471365638

159397,1,0793961009,"Speed 2 was a pretty bad and an unnecessary sequel. Patric was a poor choice to replace Reeves but it all fairness it didn't matter who took the part the movie would suck. I'll say this much for Patric it wasn't his worst performance but up there. Willian Dafoe I am sure regrets this movie as it was his worst performance of his career. Patric is too boring, bland and lacking energy or charisma to carry the film. All Dafoe thinks you need to do for his crazy over the top villain is restate why he is doing this over and over again along with doing a real crazy laugh. We need to go dig in a little deeper than that.

  I think Dafoe as an actor didn't have a lot of help from the writing team. He can only do so much. Sandra is the only redeemable part of this film as she gives the best performance and keeps you watching in a film that ran thirty minutes too long. I would avoid this movie. I got it on vhs for 25 cents so that was no loss. It's a tough film to watch because it could have been good but you see before your eyes how much they screwed it up. Patric is a great actor from The Lost Boys and I think Dafoe is amazing but these are all time low career performances and overall a boring drawn out long movie that should never have been made. Cheers and do enjoy the movie if you give it a try!  Have a good day!",1443916800,,1328,3.981203007518797

159491,2,0793961009,"SPEED 2, not a bad sequel to the original 90's Action classic
Definitely not a Direct sequel to SPEED that's for sure cause Keanu reeves declined to reprise his role as Jack traven
20th century fox offered him over 10million to reprise his role but keanu declined again
Keanu said he had other plans of what he wanted to do back in 1997 when speed 2 was filmed he was not interested being in the sequel

and because of that Director Jan De bont who also directed speed 2
changed the script around for Jason patric who was chosen to replace keanu reeves
sandra bullock's character Annie had a failed relationship with Jack traven
so a new man comes into her life in speed 2 who's Alex shaw played by Jason patric
so completely different storyline of course but because Jan De bont was Directing the sequel anyway
the studio called the sequel SPEED 2 anyway even thou the film was not a Direct sequel to Speed

well after all these years 20th century fox finally decide to release the film on blu-ray
with a new HD transfer which does look much sharper & clearer picture quality than the old DVD release
and a new 5.1 master audio mix, big Difference from the old DVD audio mix
but of course no new special features, just Theatrical trailer actually
i thought there would be a new retrospect interview or Audio commentary with Jan De bont
but of course 20th century fox did not bother making the effort to get in contact with Jan De bont
otherwise there would be new special features

the film deserves maybe 4 stars
this new blu-ray version deserves about 2 stars, cause of no new extras really bare bones as usual
but the picture quality definitely has been enhanced, much sharper & clearer quality",1423526400,,1698,4.5064935064935066

159496,3,0793961009,"I was surprised how good ""Speed 2"" was.  I was never a big fan of the first movie, so I never watched it.  Years passed, and this movie was panned so hard, I figured, just out of morbid curiosity I'd give it a spin.  So I finally did and it was actually pretty good.  The worst part about the movie was the cliche action scenes that run a little bit long.  The best thing about the movie is Sandra Bullock.  She was great in this.  I was a little disappointed with Jason Patric.  I don't know if it was the writing or what, but I've seen him perform better.  I remember him from ""Sleepers"" and I thought he was really charismatic in that, but it took a long time to warm up to his character in ""Speed 2"".  I think it might have been the writing.  This feels like an event story.  It sort of glossed over the character part.  His character is cliche and not very likable at the beginning, but over the course of the movie, he becomes more likable.  Guess that's a writing problem?  Willem Dafoe gives a great performance as a villain here.  The CGI and special effects were good, just wish there was a little more thought put into the story.  There was no clear connection, even passing reference between the first and second movie, other than Sandra Bullock's character being there.  Loved the driving test with Tim Conway.  That was funny as hell.  Not the best action movie I ever saw, but not deserving of the harsh criticisms I've heard over the years.  Overall, I'd say it's definitely worth watching.",1417910400,,1506,4.384057971014493

159526,3,0793961009,"Summer 1997 - a high-octane trailer for Speed 2 precedes Con Air in cinemas. Audiences are impressed. ""That looks good"", they say. Con Air is a number 1 hit in early June. One week later (Friday the 13th no doubt) it is knocked-off the top spot by Speed 2. Audiences are still shell-shocked by the trailer and by memories of the 1994 hit. By the following week all goodwill that anyone was willing to lend the film had evaporated and it plummeted from the top spot at the box office to fifth. Two weeks later it would be out of the top 10. A bad result for a $110-million movie.

Speed 2 was originally scheduled for release in the UK in October 1997 but was switched with Volcano (another Fox production) for an August 15th release date. Apparently Fox wanted to be done with the movie as soon as possible. This was before the internet allowed every minute detail of a movie to be scrutinized before its release. Speed 2 wasn't released worldwide as much as it was purged.

I hate Speed. Keanu Reeves is a terrible actor and I have called his performance in that film one of the worst efforts in the past two decades. He is superseded in Speed 2 by the much more likable Jason Patic as Alex Shaw, an LAPD renegade who takes Annie Porter (Sandra Bullock playing up the ditzyness) on a cruise on the Seabourn Legend (a real ship) in the Caribbean. Their holiday is interrupted by John Giger, a likable maniac in the Travis Dane mold who seizes control of the ship and plans to rob the purser's safe in revenge for being fired by the parent company.

Most of the passengers are evacuated onto lifeboats, leaving a handful in danger as the ship heads forward at a whopping 14-miles-per-hour on a collision course with an oil tanker. It is incredibly dumb and stupid, but is still very entertaining and infrequently exciting. The running time is a little bloated, and it could have excised all of the ""running around in dark corridors"" scenes for a superior final cut. There is also a very, very annoying Glaswegian character (who speaks correct English, which no Glaswegian has done since the dawn of time) called Merced, which is probably the most far-fetched thing in the entire movie as people from that particular place are never called Merced. They are called disgusting names like Stuart McGeechnie, or Colin McGillvary, or John Muirhead. They are not called Merced. If he were also cut from the final product it would most certainly raise the overall rating.

One of the more curious things about Speed 2 is that it was rated PG in the UK (compared to the 15/R-rated original). Usually I would cry sacriledge at this family-friendly rating but it barely caught my attention back then and in retrospect it actually helps. Speed took itself very seriously. Speed 2 does not, and the jokey, goofy tone makes it much more enjoyable.

Mark Mancina raised the bar on action scoring with his iconic effort in 1994 and he delivers probably the best score of his career with Speed 2. It really proves what one can do under pressure as Mancina was scoring Con Air when he was called away early to work on Speed 2 (leaving Trevor Rabin to finish Con Air) and had a very tight deadline. It's not the tinny, synthy sound of Speed anymore, he uses a HUGE orchestra which might be the only thing bigger and more bombastic than the actual premise of the movie. Really amazing stuff and it's most definitely worth hunting down the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/limited-edition-CD/dp/B003VSHVRS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">limited edition CD</a>.

There's a lot to like about Speed 2, and it doesn't deserve it's reputation. If you want mindless action, implausible set pieces, sunny scenery, and lots of destruction then look no further.

The Blu-ray is a very mixed bag in regards to video quality. It is an improvement on the awful 10-year-old DVD but still struggles with very weak black levels during the darker scenes and has a gauze-like appearance. The 2.35:1 1080p picture fares much better with daytime scenes and is generally colorful and pleasing to the eye. The DTS HD-MA sound is also very good.

159530,2,0793961009,"....with a handful of notable exceptions, sequels don't have a good rap.  This is a classic example, and when nearly everyone is saying the same thing (""it rots"") there must be something to it.  And so it is with ""Speed 2:Cruise Control""--it's a nifty title, but the positives pretty much end there.  Everyone loved the original ""Speed"", but this soggy sequel-of-sorts is capsized by a lame plot and ridiculous dialogue. Even worse, Sandra Bullock's spunky Annie-- who was nice-girl sexy, smart and likable in the bus thriller ---is cut down to a dumb, one-dimensional second banana on the cruise ship.  Many films have been illuminated by Bullock's star-power, but S2CC's scribes have doused that light for fair.  Thus, Jason Patric's character (also one-dimensional) is pretty much left to save the day single-handedly, over and over again.  Just one act of heroism involving extreme athletics is enough to wind most guys, but poor Jason is sent to save fellow passengers from certain death, have shootouts with a cartoon villain (a cruelly cast Willem Dafoe), dive under the ship to keep it from ramming a tanker, steal a speedboat, chase an airplane on water (and actually catch up to it)....one brave feat after another without missing a beat.....well, that's how I spend a Saturday afternoon, don't you? Escapist fun is one thing, but this goes from inane to boring to completely unbelievable.  The climax comes too late to save this doomed feature.....just watch the original ""Speed"" again instead.

Probably one of my favorite parts of this movie is Alex's character. He's an interesting contrast from Jack as there are both a lot of similarities and differences. Like Jack, he's a bit of a daredevil who is extremely dedicated to his work, both on and off the clock. This shows through the fact that he stoically looks death right in the eye at least four times throughout the movie with barely any hesitation, as long as it means keeping others out of harm's way. Meanwhile, his relationship with Annie, despite the strain, shows he's extremely devoted to her, considering how he chases down Geiger at the end of the movie to save her.

159604,2,0793961009,"Speed 2: Cruise Control (1997), the sequel to 1994's action hit Speed, is missing two crucial elements, the star power of Keanu Reeves (The Matrix), and a credible story.  Sandra Bullock (The Blind Side) returns to reprise her role as Annie Porter, but without Reeves, the results are nowhere near the same.  Jan de Bont, who directed Speed, contributed to the story for Speed 2, and also returns to direct and produce, what is an average at best, action thriller.

Two years have passed, and Annie's romance with Jack Traven (Reeves) has fizzled.  Things are a little shaky with her current boyfriend, Alex Shaw (Jason Patric), an officer on the LAPD SWAT team.  The couple hope that a trip on the Caribbean cruise ship Seabourn Legend, will rekindle their romance.  Willem Dafoe (To Live and Die in LA) is John Geiger, a disgruntled software engineer, who wants revenge against the cruise line for firing him.  Having designed the computer system used to pilot the ship, Geiger is able to seize control of the vessel.

Speed 2 has some major credibility issues.  Regardless of computer controls, it is impossible for one man to operate an entire cruise liner via remote control.  Shortly after Geiger assumes control, most of the passengers are apparently evacuated onto three lifeboats and some rafts.  With maybe one exception, the ship's crew are totally incompetent half wits who do almost nothing productive.  Shaw knows nothing about the ship, yet he takes command of the situation.  While Alex is busy chasing Geiger, Annie is with a group of passengers trying to find safety.

The rather tenuous link to the `speed' theme arises, because the ship's engines can't be stopped, and the course can't be altered.  Several scenes that involve Alex in the water, when the ship is supposedly traveling at high speed, look ridiculous, as the ship appears to be barely moving.  In an absolutely insane move, Alex goes underwater to try and slow down a propeller.  By rights, he should have been sucked into the blades and cut to bits.

Geiger abandons the Seabourn Legend, taking Annie as a hostage, leaving the ship locked on a collision course with an oil tanker.  Shaw again takes the lead, diverting the runaway ship, which in a nicely done scene, skids off the tanker.  The ship is now headed toward the shore, where it splinters a pier, and then rams through buildings, before grinding to a stop.  The film's final action sequence involving a boat chase, and an airplane, is poorly conceived and executed.

Prior to directing and producing, Jan de Bont's was a cinematographer of some note, working on films that included Die Hard (1988), and Basic Instinct (1992).  While Speed 2 contains a couple of well executed action sequences, several others are poorly done.  Unfortunately, it takes more than a ship crunching onshore, to make a great movie.  The story setup is not bad, but things veer off course rapidly once Geiger's plot begins.  Willem Dafoe brings mania and wild expressions to his role, but expecting him to carry so much himself, is asking too much.  The attempt to use Sandra Bullock as a springboard, fails mainly because of a weak script, and frankly a lack of star power.  Bullock is in a complementary role, and needed a suitable partner for her quirky (and at times annoying), personality to work, and Jason Patric was not a very good match.  This is an action movie, and their few action scenes together, don't play very well.  Speed 2 does entertain at some level, but falls short of the original in most respects.",1269302400,,3544,4.838870431893688

Alex, who's actually a member of an elite SWAT unit, hides the nature of his actual duties, for fear of losing Annie. He will do anything to make it up to her and when he gets caught by Annie in the midst of making a fearless arrest, Alex quickly produces a pair of tickets for what promises to be the ultimate vacation. Destination: the Caribbean... on board the world's most luxurious cruise liner. Although Speed 2 has a similar plot to the first movie it is great.

Let's get Jason Patric out of the way first. Not so much a G.I. Joe Action Figure kind of hero as a ""The Cardboard Box That G.I. Joe Is Packaged In"" kind of hero, he's W-A-Y in over his head. While I do my best to avoid spoilers in my reviews, I'll just say this...if your dream in life is to watch Jason Patric vomit in a Z-grade action film, you...my friend...are standing on the threshold of your dream.

Sandra Bullock. In the original&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Speed-Widescreen-Edition/dp/B0006GANOQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Speed (Widescreen Edition)</a>, she admittedly set a standard for the new ""heroine finds her inner strength under fire"" kind of heroine. In this film, she's kind of...well, less than a ""new standard setter.""

Is the romantic relationship between Patric and Bullock at all believable? Sure, if you believe that ""chicken nuggets"" from your local fast food place are made from 100% USDA inspected chicken breast meat.

Willem Dafoe, having the worst of all possible bad hair days, is the villain du jour and it is far from his shining hour.

Put it all together and you have Sandra Bullock and Jason Patric in a romantic relationship that is not at all believable on a big boat with Willem Dafoe in a ridiculous hairdo committing random acts of terrorism while Patric vomits and Bullock paints her toes.

Premise: A psychotic computer genuis(played by Willem Dafoe) takes control of a ship(via a computer) and tries to crash it into an oil tanker miles away. A couple aboard the ship try to save the passengers as well as stop him.

Opinion: What a truly pointless sequel this was. Sandra Bullock has never been more annoying. Willem Dafoe was great in Mississippi Burning, The Clearing, Platoon and the otherwise abysmal State Of The Union but here he is reduced to some cornball villian pissing and moaning about a job that laid him off for being sick. What a waste. Jason Patric is okay but he's seen better days on the silver screen. The script looked like it was written by overzealous tweenagers and the special effects are quite dull.

Well first off, with all due respect to the original, the sequel makes Speed 1 look like a bad David J. Burke film. And I say that not to knock the original but in praise of the sequel. Further more S2 (Speed 2) is the film Jan de Bont originally set out to make with S1. But the limited S1 budget meant that the script had to be reworked and land locked shifting it's focus away from open ocean to the open road. After the commercial success of the S1 de Bont finally had the backing and budget needed to realize his original vision going back to the franchises nautical roots in what became the cult classic we know as Speed 2: Cruse Control. Like so many other cult classic masterpieces S2 debuted at the box office head of its time and went largely unnoticed only to reemerge months later as a huge hit when reaching the rental market.

The new refined S2 cast introduced the celebrated Jason Patric whose insistence on preforming his own stunts added an incredible adrenaline laced icing on this films already action packed cake. The eye popping finale pulled out all the stops and pushed this film over the edge and into a league of its own, something many have said was only possible under the famous de Bont/Bullock Hollywood power house.

With Hollywood rumor mills abuzz of a third installment it is clear this is one film that is not slowing down!

159627,3,0793961009,"Hollywood does seem to be the one place where they don't believe in the law of diminished returns, given how many sequels to first-rate blockbusters keep coming at us year after year after year.  SPEED 2: CRUISE CONTROL is a case in point.

The original SPEED, released in 1994, was that rarest of jewels in Hollywood--an action blockbuster of considerable suspense, involving a bomb-laden bus that will blow up if its speed should fall under 50 miles per hour at any given point.  Made for a relatively inexpensive $30 million, it grossed something on the order of $150 million and actually won Oscars for sound effects and film editing.  But with all that success, did it necessarily warrant a sequel?

This time around, the disaster-prone Annie (Sandra Bullock) and her new fianc Alex (Jason Patric), like her last boyfriend an LAPD officer with a penchant for dare-deviltry, are on a Caribbean cruise aboard the Seabourne Legend, when the ship gets sabotaged by a deranged ex-employee (Willem Dafoe).  What ensues is considerable mayhem of the 'PG-13' variety, courtesy of original SPEED director Jan De Bont and screenwriters Randall McCormack and Jeff Nathanson.  But apart from Bullock (who is as appealing here the second time), Patric, and Christine Firkins as a deaf girl whom Patric saves in an elevator shaft in the bowels of the ship, SPEED 2: CRUISE CONTROL is generally a film stuck in neutral, what I tend to call a curiously frustrating flick.  It's not nearly as bad as its many detractors say, but it also isn't nearly up to the standards of the original either.  Dafoe, who was so tremendous in PLATOON and CLEAR AND PRESENT DANGER, does something of a Dennis Hopper rerun as the villain with a grudge, but he's even more over the top than Hopper was in the first film, and that's supposed to be hard to accomplish.

The other problem SPEED 2 has is in its basic notion that a large ocean liner can go as fast as this one does, and that it could create a great deal of damage when it slams into a marina as it does here.  It's all good and fun, but it's not believable; and some of the acting and the dialogue are unintentionally funny at times too: not very promising, to say the least.  One of the film's better moments, prior to Dafoe starting his mayhem, is a sequence of Bullock in her ship's cabin watching Stanley Kubrick's 1962 classic LOLITA on video--a sly reference not only to Kubrick, but to the fact that Firkins' deaf girl character has more than a few Lolita characteristics about her.

The end result is a would-be $170 million blockbuster that just seems to sit there a lot of the time--a fairly routine Hollywood piece where the action is delivered, but the payoff is only so-so.",1170115200,,2718,4.684873949579832
159628,2,0793961009,"Really, the reason Speed 2: Cruise Control isn't a classic like the first one is because the speed storyline is not a bus, but a BOAT this time around.  Do you really think a boat can go as fast as a bus?  Even if a boat is fast, do you think that's more exciting than a bus avoiding danger in the city streets?  I don't.  What kind of amazing dangers can a boat avoid?  OTHER boats?  Ocean buoys?

A bus with a bomb underneath it is more rewarding to watch.  Speed 2 feels more like a way to cash in on the original.  I watched the movie twice and wasn't satisfied either time.  It's an okay movie, though.  But don't expect ""speed"".",1161388800,3,634,4.114754098360656

So begins Sandra Bullock and Jason Patric's harrowing adventure about the Seaborne Legend. The beautiful ship, friendly passengers, and attentive crew would ordinarily make a splendid cruise. Unfortunately, among the passengers is a madman who is bent on ruining everyone's vacation.

Though it would appear this film is not universally well-loved, it is actually one of my favorite action moves. I enjoyed the main setting: a cruise ship. The passengers are very funny. Among them are a couple who are selling a new diet regimen called Fat Busters, where ""fat is your friend"" (so the body won't try to hoard fat, making weight loss difficult). Their fellow shipmates, surrounded by the cruise ship's banquet-like meal, heartily agree. And the deaf girl who signs is wonderful.

The villain is entertaining. (Admittedly, the story behind his motivation to destroy the ship may be rather contrived.)

The action moves from the ocean-liner, to speedboat, to personal water-craft, to a propeller aircraft, then finally to a tower high atop an oil tanker. (If you've ever wondered what it would look like to see an oil tanker blow up, your curiosity will be satisfied by what happens next.)

In all, this movie is a little like a trip to an amusement park. There is lots of action in this movie, and no small amount of comedy.",1154908800,4,1368,4.982456140350878

159652,5,0793961009,"I preface all of my DVD reviews with the following note: There are more than enough film reviews on Amazon.com and, quite frankly, it's a bit ridiculous. A person can scroll through scores/pages of reviews without reading a single sentence about the quality of the DVD. If you want to review or discuss a film, go to IMDB. If you're reviewing the DVD, speak to the qualities (or lack thereof) of the audio and video; mention your opinions of the plot, acting, etc. but please don't write an essay!

Now, on to my review of the Speed 2: Cruise Control DVD.

VIDEO (A+): This DVD is enhanced for the new generation of widescreen TVs. The transfer is virtually flawless, exhibiting only a few very minor, and ultimately inconsequential, flaws. The colors and black levels are dead-on.

AUDIO (A+): A DTS track is available on this disc, but I watched it with the DD 5.1 track. The music and dialogue are clean and nicely mixed, and the effects are what you would expect of a big-budget action movie.

FILM (B-): This film seems to polarize people; either you like it, or you hate it. When it comes to my taste in cinema, I enjoy irrelevant escapist flicks like this one. Although it was, and still is, universally panned as one of the worst films ever, I couldn't care less. Of course it's ridiculous and over-the-top. But the supporting cast is actually quite good and makes the movie more interesting. As other reviewers have mentioned, the film drags a bit during the takeover and evacuation sequence. Actually, there probably could have been up to 30 minutes cut from the movie during that time. Additionally, the shots in this film consist almost entirely of close-ups. I guess that adds to the claustrophobic atmosphere of the distressed ship, but it's a bit much. The few wide shots in the movie are quite beautiful and bring welcome, if very brief, relief. As far as extras go, there is a puffy, yet informative, HBO special on the disc. In it, Jason Patric says that nothing like this movie has been done before, and nothing like it will ever be made again. That statement takes on a different meaning in hindsight, but the fact remains that this movie did, in fact, turn a profit and continues to generate revenue to this day through sales and rentals.

I bought this DVD from Amazon in March 06 for $10.99. Shortly thereafter, the price jumped to $12.99 and now it has fallen to under $8. The DVD is of exceptional quality, so if you like the film, you should definitely buy it.",1149984000,9,2486,4.615384615384615

159654,1,0793961009,"I heard the terrible reviews for this movie, but I decided to give it a try, mostly because of Sandra Bullock and Jason Patric, but even their on-screen chemistry could not save it. Why did they even bother to make a sequel? SPEED was a once-in-a-lifetime experience, where everything magically worked. SPEED 2: CRUISE CONTROL, on the other hand, seemed destined for self-destruction from the minute it was put into production. I have nothing but respect and admiration for Jason Patric, an intelligent, underrated actor, whose performances are outstanding, but he is obviously so far out of his element here, the viewer picks up on his disinterest and listlessness like a skin rash. What was he doing, paying off a debt? Sandra Bullock is a great lady, but her character is somewhat annoying here, and not really given much to work with. I can see why Keanu Reeves turned this masterpiece of waste down, and why both Bullock and Patric regret this project. Willem DaFoe, to his credit, tries hard as the villain, but he is just an unintentionally comic and moronic madman, and the rest of the characters are cardboard cutouts. Where's Dennis Hopper when you need him? An action-packed thriller? A love story? How about just a severe case of seasickness? Eeeeewwwwwwww . . . . . . Watch this one if you have a strong stomach, are half asleep, or if you need to kill time. Get out the barf bags!!!!!!",1141171200,4,1399,4.737704918032787

It was fun seeing the two guys trying the turn the cruise ship hard to the right so it won't crash into that other ship. What was really exciting was the cruise ship wouldn't stop once it reach the beach it kept crashing into buildings and wreacking little boats.

159656,3,0793961009,"SPEED was such a rush of a film because it took off like a cannonball and never let up; we felt real jeopardy was in place for the people on the bus and Keanu and Sandra made the heroes believable and likeable.  In this alarmingly ineffectual sequel, Sandra Bullock is reduced to whining and moaning about Jason Patric's deception, and she doesn't play as pivotal a role in the capturing of demented maniac Willem Defoe.  They even bring back the irrepressible Glenn Plummer in a different role but providing the same type of character:  a nervous guy who finds his boat taken over by Patric in his attempts to snare Defore.  He did it in the first one with his Porsche and Keanu.  Director Jan DeBont's pacing is significantly slower in this one, although the movie somehow ALMOST redeems itself with its cataclysmic climax of the boat destroying a small resort area.  We don't feel the same kind of breathless peril we felt in SPEED, and Dafoe's reasoning for wanting to wreck the ship into the oiler is far less convincing than madman Dennis Hopper's in the original.  The leeches addition is banal, and Dafoe's fate because he was a computer programmer (deadly copper exposure) is as far fetched as it is ridiculous.

SPEED 2 didn't catch on at all, and whether Keanu had returned, it probably still wouldn't have improved it..the script is so poorly conceived, I don't think Meryl Streep and Dustin Hoffman could have saved this one.",1112486400,2,1438,4.724

159668,1,0793961009,"I guess no one read the script thouroughly before jumping feet first with the kitchen sink into the vast mess of this horrible sequel. The only satisfying note I want to add is Keanu Reeves is a genius...he didn't star in this one, thank god. Good for you Keanu..good for you dude. This one has Sandra Bullock (Speed, Murder 8y Numbers) now, without a Keanu Reeves and now with a Jason Patric (Narc, The Lost Boys) only reason he didn't tell her he was working for ironically for the people Keanu was working for. So this pisses her off, he surprises her with a cruise ship....they have a good time but the only thing is they got on the wrong boat at the wrong time see there's this terroist, Willem Dafoe (Spider-Man, Wild At Heart) and he has taking hold of the boat. Now he wants demands and stuff otherwise he blows it up. Patric then thinks he can try to stop Dafoe. Are we sensing a familiar sense? Long, dreadful sequel to the already better original. Jan DeBont must of been smoking the wrong stuff when he came up with this one. Even some interesting but washed away action scenes don't even cut the bill. Also starring Joe Morton (Speed, Executive Decision), Tim Conway, Temuera Morrison (Six Days, Seven Nights, The Island Of Dr. Moreau 96'), Collen Camp (Die Hard With A Vengance, Clue) and Glenn Plummer (Speed, The Salton Sea). what a waste, huh?",1099958400,10,1360,4.532520325203252
159669,3,0793961009,"It's still as fast paced as the original, and just when you think it's gonna finish, they run into more problems. It's exactly the same as the original, just without Keanu. Why didn't he come back for this? Because he went on tour with his oh-so-brilliant band Dogstar. In the end, I bet he was glad, after the slating this received.

From the original, Sandra Bullock, Joe Morton & Glenn Plummer come back for more. They're joined by Jason Patric (all chest hair and muscles - ugh!), Willem Dafoe, one of the most evil looking guys around, and lots of passengers, including a little deaf girl, who instantly develops a crush on Jason Patric's character, Alex. Not many of the characters in this make you feel any sympathy for them, and hardly any of them are familiar from other roles. Unless you count Michael G. Hagerty, who, for anyone who's a die-hard fan of Friends, will recognise him as Mr. Treeger!

A total of 3 different ships were used in this film: Seaborn Legend (actual cruise liner; used for most exterior shots of the ship) ""Bridge Ship"" (Sturgeon Atlanic frighter ship built with a false hull and bridge; used for bridge scenes and the boat crashes in the marina) ""Rail Ship"" (false hull built on an underwater rail; used for the island crash finale scene). All other shots of the ship were complete computer graphic effects.

There's another reason why I like this movie, and it's because it has the little deaf girl in it, played by Christine Firkins, who hasn't done anything but this and two episodes of the X-Files. She's deaf for real, not just in the movie, which I was surprised to find out, and it's a great accomplishment for her. She uses a lot of sign language, a language which I would LOVE to learn, but unfortunately, I have no one to practice on, therefore have no reason to try and pick it up.

Annie & Alex (how original) decide to go on holiday together, which is a big step for both of them, considering Annie has bad taste in men, and they've only reached 7 months together. Wow! A couple of actors that have absolutely no chemistry between them. Boy oh boy, bring back Keanu! Jason lacks charisma and is totally unconvincing. And you don't propose to someone who doesn't like you doing the job you do, and you have zip chemistry with.

To think that Willem later went on to become the bad guy in the second Spiderman movie. Wait, first. Yeah first. His role as a villian in this is one big joke and he never comes across as threatening as Dennis Hopper did in the original. And to boot, he has a lousy reason to blow up the boat. Dennis Hopper, now he had a reason. To use a similar reason the second time round was just someone not thinking properly.

The little deaf girl should have got loads more screen time, Jason should have drowned, and Sandra should have saved the day. But nothing could have saved this film. It's watchable. That's about it. The original was better. Now bring back Keanu for Speed 3 please!",1099180800,4,2957,4.517757009345795

Sure there can be the occasional stupid dialogue here and there, but only really by one person, Willem defoe, but he did an ok job but i didn't see it for him, i saw it for the action. The action sequences really picked up when daylight came. They are good but they should have cut them shorter a bit, only because i really wanted to feel the rush like in the first, but i love the ship running into the town and the boat blowing up in the end. I think this film would have been great if Keanu had accepted to come back and they should have kept the MA rating. sandra Bullock, good as usual, Jason Patrik, well they needed somebody to fill in and he did a good job.

159671,2,0793961009,"The original Speed was a different kind of movie (Who would have thought a movie that took place mainly on a bus would be so good?) that for one reason or another MANY people enjoyed.  Speed 2 seems to be one of those ""We liked the first one so we want a sequel!"" Kind of movies, and it turned out to be pretty bad.  Speed 2 actually makes a Disney sequel look GOOD.
The movie centers around our heroine Annie (her role reprised by Sandra Bullock) who is taking a driving test in the beginning of the movie to get her license back for (gasp!) speeding! She has just gotten herself out of a relationship with Jack (Who was in the first one) and is now with Alex (Jason Patric). When she finds out that Alex works for the same squad that Jack works for she isn't too happy with that.
Later Alex decides to take Annie on a cruise and when they do things start off fine and dandy until a mad bomber (William Dafoe) by the name of Geiger takes over the cruise ship trapping a few passengers on board.
Let's put this one thing aside, Keanu Reeves didn't show up in this film.  Surprisingly enough this one thing is what starts the film slide into ruin.  Jason Patric and Sandra Bullock don't really have a whole lot of chemistry.  It isn't as well developed as it was in the first Speed movie.  I'm sure that even if Keanu Reeves had appeared in this movie it wouldn't have saved it from becoming a mess anyhow.
William Dafoe doesn't make for the greatest villian either (who would've thought that five years later he'd be the Green Goblin in the blockbuster hit: Spider Man?).  He has the potential to be a great mad bomber but somehow he misses what the bomber in the first movie had.  That would be his lack of remorse and intelligence.
Speed 2 doesn't keep on the edge of your seat like the first movie did.  Speed 2 is like a Disney Sequel, not good enough for the theater.  Speed 2 I can honestly say was a bad movie.  An under developed plot put along with some pretty under developed characters make this movie seem like garbage.

Oh, the poo poo of it all! Unfortunately, there was no Keanu to bail them out - although after the explosion they traded their heads and became zombie bounty hunters for the galaxy of blunk-do. That's a whole other story revolving around apes and the ancient race of Horps el Thwipples. Crazy sh-t. Anyhoo, Speed 2 was so bad that I rented a yacht from the local deli and drove it into the Vatican (Vatican Diner that is). Great cheese fries and gravy there. Very much in the vain of the Speed franchise. They named them the 'Whim of a mad fries and gravy man.' Every time you eat a fry the computer chip in it burns a frame of Speed 2 onto your skull. It makes you speak and communicate only in the language of Speed. For example. 'How do you like your burgr cooked?' Reply: 'Cans.' OR 'Would you like fries with that?' Answer: 'Don't get dead.' See?

And truly enough the first SPEED didn't need a sequel but it is not like this movie gave the name ""speed"" a bad name.  I didn't love this movie, but I didn't hate it either,  I kinda liked it and I'd probobly watch it when it comes on tv.  So this time time we are on a cruise ship being taken over by a maniac (Willam Dafoe, the guy who played the Green Goblin in SPIDERMAN) who plans to have it crash somewhere and we don't have a bus being forced to move 50mph-BIG DEAL.  The makers tried to do something different and that doesn't mean there new idea [stinks].  Anyway here is the plot....
It has now been a few a years since the whole bus incident nad Anni (Sandra Bullock) has left Jack .  She now has a new buyfriend Alex (Jason Patric) who happens to be a cop like just like Jack but Annie doesn't know know that.  One day Annie runs into Alex when he was on duty snd figures everything out.  Then comes the ""I think we should see other people"" thing but then Alex brings her cruise tickets so they can go together on vacation and work everything out.  As they go on vacation, everything may actually may seem to go right.  There having a good time and nmothing is wrong; that is what they think.  It seems that one guest on the ship named Geiger (Willam Dafoe) plans to urn everybody's nice relaxing vacation into a total disaster.  Geiger is a super yet mental computer genius.  Using his knowledge, Geiger manages to put the ship under his controll and sends the ship on a one way trip to hell- literally!!!  Annie and the help of Alex try to do what the can to stop this lunatic and save the people on the ship.
So that is pretty much the plot.  This may not be the world's best action movie but it isn't the worst.  This movie's action are pretty cheezy yet enjoyable to watch.  I loved the part where the Boat crashed into the neighborhood.  It was so much fun to watch and may be the best part of the film.  The only part of this film I hated was the absense of Keanu Reeves.  He is one of the best action stars out there and it would be nice if he was in this movie.  Overall, this movie is okay and I would recommend buying the video instead of dvd because it will cheaper and all the dvd has x-tra is a trailor.",1050019200,,2385,4.103671706263499
159688,3,0793961009,"A lot can be said about many movies whose original is considered a classic while the sequel is considered a bag of flaming [poop]. While ""Speed 2: Cruise Control"" is far from being the latter, it still is a huge decline from the terrifying adrenaline levels of the 1994 original to mostly clichd plotting. Yes, of couse this movie has plenty of things to see, but it doesn't come anywhere close to the adrenaline of the first movie. In fact, this movie should've gone under a different title as it hardly shows the speed of the first one.
The movie is basically about a large ocean liner where Annie is on a vacation in the Bahamas, or somewhere in the Caribbean Ocean when a deranged madman named John Geiger (played by William Dafoe) disables the main engines and takes control of the ship holding all of the passengers hostage. Personally in my opinion, William Dafoe as the madman Geiger does just as great playing the villain as Dennis Hopper did playing the terrorist Howard Payne in the first Speed movie, showing the madness of a hijacker.
It goes downhill for a while after that though with predictable outcomes, fake chemistry, and ridiculous acting by the main character hero. Alex Marshall shows little of the emotional punch, tension, or the rage that Officer Traven showed on the 1994 original. Annie hardly shows the tension, or the fright that she had on the metro bus in the first movie. The chemistry between Bullock and Patric is nowhere near as evident nor as deep as there was between Bullock and Reeves.
This movie definitely has some redeeming moments such as the underwater propeller scenario and the oil tanker exploding but even those don't add up enough to create what I consider a major classic and the overall result is a half-baked plot and a movie that doesn't leave much of any impact behind once it's over. A disappointing but OK follow-up to the dynamite Speed.",1047340800,,1895,4.710843373493976

It giggles and guffaws in its bubbly, scatter-brained way, and giddily trots through each cliched plot development: it is the bimbo of action movies. But the movie is full of details
(some of the action parts are boring) and while it may not be deep, it isn't empty (except empty-headed). This is a great movie to just have a laugh over with friends.

She's apparently left Jack (Keanu Reeves, though he doesn't appear in the movie)  and has a new boyfriend (Jason Patric)  Patric, like Reeves, is a cop.  After several incidents, Porter tells her new boyfriend that maybe they're not right for each other.  He says that they should spend more time together and learn more about each other.  So they buy tickets to a luxury cruise ship.  However, an evil computer genius (Willem Dafoe) takes over the ship and has set it to crash into a small town.  Now, Porter and her boyfriend must stop this from happening.
I think that Speed 2 had a lot more suspense and a villian better than Dennis Hopper (Dennis Hopper was a bit comedic)  There are some fist fights and some good scenes are the opening motorcycle scene and the crash into the town and the sideways turn from the other ship.
Good movie though not really worth buying.

159694,3,0793961009,"Okay, when it comes to things like script and genuine quality filmmaking, Speed 2 is pretty bad, with a preposterous plot that's far more unlikely to occur than even the outrageous (but brilliant) premise of the original.  But yet, as entertainment value, this movie isn't half-bad at all, even if it takes 75 minutes to get to the big collision course finale (a veerrry long and quite thrilling sequence) which, while not up to par with the bus sequence in Speed, is still a damn good action sequence in its own right.  Yes, the film does miss the presence of Keanu Reeves (I never thought I'd say that), who had great chemistry with Sandra Bullock.  Jason Patric and Bullock just don't click as a couple, perhaps partially because this relationship lacks the spontaneity that the original Speed gave us.  As for the other performances, the only one of note is Willem Dafoe, whose over-the-top, maniacal portrayal of the villain, Geiger, unfortunately ranks as one of the worst performances of this excellent actor's career.  Kudos to composer Mark Mancino, who had the putzah not to just recycle the score from the original, and while his work here is similar to that piece, there are enough variations to put them apart and this score is almost as pulse-pounding.
As silly as Speed 2 does have the tendency to get (Bullock finds a chainsaw in the ship), the film never takes itself very seriously and never asks you to, either.  Truthfully, I never could see why people hate this film so much, especially when it's superior to the likes of equally silly action thrillers such as Con Air, Bad Boys, Gone in Sixty Seconds, and The Long Kiss Goodnight.  In closing, this is very slightly recommended, mainly because of the concluding action and stunt sequences, and if you watch this film as a half-knowingly silly action flick, you might indeed enjoy it.",1027728000,,1855,4.7962382445141065

In other words, the movie is loud, totally unnecessary, acting is loud and overstated, and is totally bad. The only reason I give it two stars is because Bullock manages through this turgid mess with a straight face and her hilarious lines make this a bearable action ""thriller.""

159710,4,0793961009,Speed 2 is one of the better action sequels of the 1990's. It would've been better if Keanu had returned. Unfortunately he didn't want to return. That stinks  because he would have done much better than Jason Patric. The chemistry isn't there between Patric and Bullock. Patric gets most of the best action scenes while Bullock essential to the success of the original gets downplayed which bites. Nevertheless its still a super sequel. The crashing of the ship into the port city is excelent. dodging the tanker is also kinetic. But the best sequence is the part where Patric goes underwater to put a chain into the propeller and almost gets caught. This make the scenes from the original speed almost plausible. Speed will always be better though.,1007769600,5,749,4.8515625
159711,3,0793961009,"You will be able to enjoy this movie only if you refer to it as a sheer parody, which is exactly what it is. The producers of the film had been realistic, they'd known they couldn't repeat the phenomenal success of its predecessor, which was a unique achievement. So, what could they do? Create a much lighter movie that would laugh at all the `edge-of-your-seat' tension the first one generated ( check out my Speed-1 review, which is much shorter, by the way). They succeeded in some points. Remember that Reeves had drown himself away from the production, thus allowing the creators to stress the humorous aspect  (which Keanu lacks completely) of the plot.
Okay, what materials do we have? No Reeves, One wildcat Bullock, new clownish Patric, distinguished Willem Dafoe, the necessary new Latin and black figures and one astounding boat. How do we mix these ingredients into a supposed to be blockbuster?
First of all, we shall introduce the `new Reeves', and show the audience that he's much dumber (a.k.a. bolder) than his predecessor - getting himself willfully to a life threatening chase after a van loaded with stolen computers (?). Then, we have to get reacquainted with long time no seen hyperactive Annie, who is more hilarious than ever. We would want to fix them an awkward affair no one would buy, and get them into a new speedy adventure, this time on the sea.
Now, on the boat we meet the Ace of the movie - Willem Dafoe - that made a complete joke out of this flick. He is really great portraying the comic-book villain, who constantly has to explain and prove he's there to revenge his former employees, and make a lot of money while at it. He looks like a spoiled kid playing `who can catch me?' in a floating version of Disneyland ,making all kind of unrealistic tricks and stunts with his all mighty portable computer he carries everywhere.
You can look at him in one of two (or both) ways : a) a fallen actor that once was great in important films like ""Platoon"", now coming to the end of the road, b) a talented actor that decided to take it easy this time and just to enjoy characterizing the ultimate greedy-self-centered-not-very-smart bad guy. I prefer the second option because it's clear he's outdone the rest of the crew in performance, comic abilities and foolishness (someone tell me why did he take Annie as a hostage?).
I made it to the finale, and let me be honest, I just couldn't stop laughing! It was so absurd you won't believe. I won't disclose much if I'd say that De-Bont managed to kill two birds in one stone: bombastic beach encounter and an oil tanker rendezvous a few minutes later - could you ask for more?
Final word, see it if only to witness how De-Bont orchestrated a major farce of all the seagoing disaster films he could think of, and if only to ask yourself in the last shot - `You've got to be kiddin' me, did he really do that?'",1002672000,4,2888,4.564547206165703
159712,2,0793961009,"I saw ""Speed 2: Cruise Control"" because I deeply enjoyed the original ""Speed"" movie with Keanu Reeves.  ""S2:CC"" is an instantly forgettable follow-up to an entertaining thriller.
Dying computer ace and extortionist Willem Dafoe electronically takes control of an ocean liner's navigational instruments.  Sandra Bullock, heroine of the original ""Speed,"" is one of the ship's passengers and quickly works to save the day.
""S2:CC"" is an inferior sequel.  The film has virtually none of the heartpounding suspense and excitement of the original film.  Bullock does her best with the lackluster script.
Willem Dafoe is the only factor that comes close to being a saving grace in this film.  Dafoe is probably present day cinema's third greatest villain after Christopher Walken and John Malkovich.  With his wild eyes and reptilian features, Dafoe exudes a creepy and menacing presence.  Dafoe's villain is actually somewhat more interesting than Bullock's heroine.

159715,5,0793961009,"In a summer (1997) which presented one disappointing film after another, Speed2 had the misfortune to be lumped together with all the other bad films. Yet, upon closer examination, this film presents, humor, likeable characters, non-stop action and beautiful surroundings. It is hard to understand why this received so many negative reviews. Perhaps because it is the sequel to a highly successful and good action movie and thus could not live up to the hype.
Sandra Bullock is her naturally engaging self, and Jason Patric can't help but look like an Oscar winner compared to the excruciatingly wooden acting that Keanu Reeves had in the first (and, let's face it, most of his other) film(s).
There is more character development here than the first film as the two main characters dance around asking one another to get married. Once the action begins, we are presented with a logical sequence of events as the heros try to use their brains to come up with different ways to slow down an out-of-control ship. There is a satisfying lack of too much gun play and enough originality in this movie to satisfy any action fan.
An unstoppable cruise ship may not provide the kinetic energy that the out of control bus had in the original Speed, but the pacing along with the fast editing helps make up for it. By the time the ship stops, you can't help but let out a ""phew"" along with the characters on screen.
There are some plot points that are best overlooked but none that are as ""dumb"" as some other reviewers claim. Why people should be so critical of the plot when the original Speed film had plenty of holes in it, is beyond me. Whether we like it or not, most action films' plots require at least some suspension of disbelief. A curious side effect of this is that we ignore weak plot points when we enjoy a film, and focus in on them when we do not like a movie. I believe that the strong affection that some have for the first film have blinded them in regard to this film, and have made them particularly critical of it. Perhaps they want a repeat of the first film, a mad bomber and the easily identifiable locale of riding on a bus. Perhaps they simply cannot identify with the extreme difficulty in stopping an out of control ship. Even under control, many large vessels have to start slowing down miles before they reach dock.
Maybe people just preffered the automaton, indestructible robot that Keanu Reeves' character represented, as opposed to Jason Patric's all-too-human character.

The buff, handsome hero who comes to the rescue and saves the day. Down-to-the-last-second suspense. Personally, I don't see how this was even made into a movie. The producers probably thought that the earlier movie's success would pull it through. The script and storyline in this movie are very bad. From the looks of things, people saw this movie for 3 reasons: 1--To see Sandra Bullock, whom they adore. 2--In hopes that Speed 2 will be as good as the first one. 3--They were desperate for an action flick.
