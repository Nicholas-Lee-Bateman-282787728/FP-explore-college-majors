8133394,5,B000GLP9KE,I have used this to train my dog to do a variety of tricks.  I found the information useful and on topic!  This was easy to use and with consistency in my training we got great results!  Well worth your time and money.,1265241600,,218,4.023255813953488
8133395,1,B000GLP9KE,Worst thing I ever saw. Half the time the video is not even on the subject. The video is around 10 minutes long. The instructions for the tricks are on an audio cassette. Don't waste your money!!!!!!,1186876800,,199,4.405405405405405
