Just take a look at the cast for one thing.  It is termendious! Full of extreme talent.  The musical numbers are wonderful and the story has always been one of my favorites. ""It's only with the heart that one can see freely.""  In this very hectic world we live in we should really take a moment and smell the roses.  We live way to fast but seeing this movie or reading this book kind of puts life back in the perspective that it should be even if it's thru the eyes of a child.  Just wish it was on DVD.",1038268800,18,655,3.954198473282443
263692,5,6300216225,"I seriously wish they would release this on DVD. And, as that will most likely not be happening any time soon, at the very least put out the soundtrack.

263693,4,6300216225,"cute movie!  If you've read the book, you'll be slightly disappointed by this adaptation.  The story is interwoven with cheesy musical numbers.  However, it does well to capture the charm of the story.  Plus, the Little Prince is a really cute kid!  When you hear the laughter in the stars, your heart will melt.  It's a good video, but probably one that you'll only watch in your English class.",1006128000,2,395,4.6521739130434785
263694,5,6300216225,"I completely love this movie! I saw it when I was younger, and totally liked it. The music was wonderful, especailly ""I never met a rose.""

263695,5,6300216225,"This movie captures the spirit of the book, The Little Prince. It is utterly captivating and charming. The music is outstanding, of course, Frederick Loewe. Richard Kiley is excellent as the Pilot. The direction is worthy of Broadway by Stanley Donen. Bob Fosse is amazing as the Snake. Gene Wilder sitting in the wheat field is heart-wrenching; and his dance scene with the Prince is delightful. The slightly surreal atmosphere only adds to the magic and truth of the story. The Little Prince himself is truly this little boy. What a great job everyone does! Kids will enjoy this movie, but I think it's the adults that will get the most out of it. Who has not had a childhood vision crushed by grown-ups? This movie will restore your vision and dreams.",972604800,35,754,4.71969696969697

Not knowing anything about the film, I was shocked at the  faithfulness of the film to the book.  The little boy is stunning--he IS  the Little Prince!  I loved Gene Wilder as the fox, but I could have done  without the LONG presentation of the snake--BLAH!  My three children  (7,5,2) have each been mesmerized by it several times.

The score, by songwriting duo Lerner and Loewe, is unforgettable, and the acting (Gene Wilder-the fox, Richard Kiley-the pilot, Steven Warner-the Little Prince, Bob Fosse-The Snake) is marvelous.
One to cherish and treasure for years!

263734,5,6300216225,This was such a sweet little movie with some funny little songs disbursed throughout.  Don't look for a big plot in this movie.  It's a little fable about a little prince who leaves his tiny planet to explore other planets.  He ends up on earth where a pilot has also landed after his plane's motor broke down.  The pilot has childhood issues and with the help of the little prince (also a child) he works through them.  The best part of the movie is the section where the little prince meets and tames the fox played by Gene Wilder.  I could watch that section over and over and over.,1474243200,,585,4.321100917431193

263779,5,6300216225,"I purchased this movie after the recent death of Gene Wilder.  I had seen this movie years ago when it first came out, and remembered that I loved that Gene had played the character of the Fox in the movie.  Having loved this story for years, it was delightful to re-watch it again.  I had forgotten that the movie had been turned into a musical, featuring the music of Lerner and Loewe (which won a Golden Globe for one of the songs).  Richard Kiley is perfect as the pilot who encounters the Little Prince in desert, and has a wonderful voice to boot.  Bob Fosse becomes the humanized form of the Snake - and he's amazing.  But it's Wilder's personification of the Fox and his exchange with the Little Prince about being tamed that steals my heart every time.  Reading it in the book is one thing - watching Gene Wilder's facial expressions is something else entirely.  While Wilder is a comedic genius, this performance makes the movie, at least for me.  I bought it so I can now watch it over and over.",1473033600,5,1006,4.423913043478261

I had already watched it when I was little.
It is a beautiful story. Now, I have to admit, that some of the characters now, can come out  as creepy... I mean, the fox, the snake, I think that a new version of this movie needs to be made, because having a full grown mad play a fox or a snake is kind of weird now....

263900,3,6300216225,"It's charming, and very touching in places but the problem is the score. According to Alan Lerner's biography, he believed that Fritz Loewe had written one of his most beautiful scores when he completed this. But when it came to recording the music, Stanley Donen made so many changes to tempo and truncated Lerner's lyrics, that they almost came to blows. Lerner was one of the wittiest lyricists, and in the past, teaming him up with a composer famous for deliciously romantic music, was a winning combination. But Lerner's famous wit possibly wasn't quite the right fit for such a simple fable. Loewe was also so upset withe the Hollywood treatment Donen had given the film, which wasn't the original intent, he refused to attend the recording sessions in London. Lerner never spoke to Donen again, and he believed that the alterations to their last work together helped to kill Lowe, who died shortly after. But in truth, their glory days were well and truely over, and
there are a number of songs here that sound too much like other much better ones. Lerner was also forced into some casting decisions that he didn't want. Frank Sinatra was his first choice for the role of the pilot, and his world weary charm and star power would have been perfect for this. But Donen refused to work with Sinatra so he was out and Kiley who was much better on a stage, was in. He also didn't want Gene Wilder, but the studio did. So it seems that lots of compromises were made. There are some lovely things in it, and Bob Fosse makes a memorable snake, even though the desert terrain obviously limits his dancing.",1436140800,,1604,4.631578947368421

It is accessible on so many levels, and besides, children understand things more deeply than GROWNUPS ;) can imagine.  Watching this movie afterwards is always a special treat.  Richard Kiley and Steven Warner are a magical match.  It is remarkable to watch children, yes even of this generation, become delighted and touched by this story, and by the musical numbers and singing.  Richard's voice is exhilarating and very moving, especially during the last song.  Read all the other highly rated reviews here; all the good things are true.

It didn't always hold the attention of my children (there are dry moments) but the visual grace of the film (man, is that cinematography brilliant) helps keep your attention focused on the screen even when the action is low.

Telling the story of a pilot, discouraged from his childhood fantasies by adults too mature for their own good, The Little Prince has this pilot encounter a strange young child from another world after he crash lands in the desert.  The young boy tells the man stories of oppression from adults and strange encounters with snakes (an obvious biblical reference and nod to Satan) and foxes before the man is able to once again embrace his youthful innocence.  Its a beautifully told story of lost innocence and the desire to once again grab hold of it.  Stanley Donen uses from serious visual style to tell his story, but he understands needed restraint while impacting the emotions.  The cast is uniformly fine, with no one really excelling.  Bob Fosse is a tad awkward and Steven Warner is not the best child actor, but Gene Wilder is always charming and fluid, and Richard Kiley balances out the needed emotions well.

this is quite possibly the worst film adaptation I have ever seen.  Perhaps the blame lies with the English version of the story, but having read the original French version and afterwards, watching the movie in my honors French 4 class, I can say without a doubt that I have lost 88 minutes of my life that I will never get back.  The only similarities between the book and the movie were the title and the fact that there was indeed a Little Prince.  The prince's British accent prevented me from understanding the lines which were indeed totally corrupted from the original text.  The director deviated so far from the story line that it was virtually unrecognizable.  The lovably demanding rose turned into a laughable seductress wannabe enticing a poor little boy.  As a musician, I found the musical numbers long winded, totally unnecessary and just plain bad. It is unimaginable that this cheap attempt at a musical won a Golden Globe for Best Score! What was the Academy thinking?!?!?!?

In short, I hated it!  But maybe that's just me.",1314921600,4,1062,4.7650273224043715

I even travelled to France with the one intent of visiting the pantheon in Paris where the plaque commemorating him is. My house is filled with little homages to him and The Little Prince.

Almost everything - but this movie was such absolute drivel! I persisted watching it to the end purely out of respect for Antoine de Saint-Exupery, but I was absolutely put off this film so many times. I can forgive trying to make the story a little more modern and child-friendly by the musical numbers, but they weren't even tasteful.
This movie took a perfectly good story and desecrated it. I want so badly to apologize to Antoine de Saint-Exupery on the filmmaker's behalf.

P.S. Why does the snake/""Satan"" character sing about suicide so happily while imitating Michael Jackson's dance moves? Argh!",1278201600,3,989,4.783625730994152

I can't account for the rest of the movie, but the first part did not follow the original book in which the boy does NOT run away.

264189,3,6300216225,"I remember this movie opening to very mixed reviews back in 1974, and so I avoided it for over 30 years.  But I recently reread the book (highly recommended for adults as well as children, by the way) and became curious about this adaptation.  Although there are a couple of serious problems with this film, it is, on the whole, a surprisingly enjoyable and moving viewing experience.  For the most part, the problems are limited to the first half of the film, so if you stick with it that long, the payoff is worth your while.

First of all, that Lerner and Lowe score is a mixed bag at best.  But the score improves remarkably in the second half of the film, and the best of it is winning.  Secondly, the depiction of the rose is flawed.  Gene Wilder's Fox and Bob Fosse's Snake, both wonderful here, are able to step out of their animal skins once their characters are economically established.  This frees up their performances considerably.  We see their faces clearly, they interact with the Little Prince directly, movement helps define their characters.  But the great dancer Donna McKechnie's entire performance as the Rose is horribly ill-conceived.  Her image is projected onto a red petal, and as a result, she's murky, small, and, worst of all for a dancer, straight-jacketed. The fact that the connection between the Prince and his Rose is not more persuasive is problematic, since the Little Prince's love for the beautiful but petulant Rose informs almost all his actions.

That being said, the look and feel of this film is pitch-perfect.  Stanley Donen wisely avoided the typical bloat to which most Hollywood musicals are susceptible.  This Little Prince is intimate in scale.  The musical numbers are mostly solos or duets.  Nothing here overpowers the delicate plot.  The art direction and special effects, particularly during the Prince's interplanetary travels, catch the eye.  The performances, with the exception of the Rose (whose deficiencies are more the fault of the director than Ms. McKechnie), are praiseworthy.  Richard Kiley is appealing and in fine voice as the Pilot.  And Steven Warner is absolutely  beguiling as The Little Prince.

Everything pulls together successfully for the last 45 minutes of this film and drives the audience to a touching finale.  And about that snake bite: it is certainly meant to be transformative and transporting rather than suicidal.  It makes complete sense within the context of this tale, and all but the youngest child will grasp this easily.  The Little Prince's peals of laughter filling the night sky make it clear that he has arrived at home safely.

264190,4,6300216225,"I've read this book in English and French and it is one of my favorite French books--I hate modern French literature.  I thought that this movie was charming, and also that it follows the book very well.  I've shown it to my French classes and most of the students enjoy it.  The only parts that I didn't like were the character of the rose although it fits the book and I hate Bob Fosse's bit.  It was too long.  Gene Wilder was great in his part.  My favorite character was the Little Prince himself.  I can't imagine a more perfect fit.  My favorite ""scenes"" from the book were well represented.  My three children watched and enjoyed it, but as one reviewer pointed out, there is a theme of child-suicide.  My children did not catch it, but in retrospect it is obvious and disturbing, but that is what happens in the book.  It is definately a point of discussion.  It is not condoning suicide, but in the movie you are really left to sort it out yourself.  Overall, I love this movie, but it is not oscar worthy.",1167868800,2,1016,4.3689839572192515
264191,5,6300216225,"I saw this low rated musical for the first time at of all places Radio City Music Hall (when they showed movies).  Since then, it has been one of my favorite films of my childhood.  I never read the book, or saw any other adaptations of the story. Yet, several of the actors (Bob Fosse, Gene Wilder, Richard Kiley, Joss Ackland, Carol Lawrence and a LONG PRE Waiting For God Graham Crowden) in their ""younger and more formidable years"" give performances that would be as first rate as the other roles they would be remembered most for today.  Steven Warner in the title role is a delight, and on star filled nights now 30+ years later, I can still hear him laughing.  Until this film, I never knew Kiley could sing, but since buying this film on disc, I find my self singing ""It's A Hat/I Need Air"" with an alarming degree of frequency.  Buy this for your children's second exposure to musicals (make the first one Wizard of Oz or Willy Wonka), they will enjoy and so will you (but keep them away from snakes afterwards okie dokie?):-)",1167004800,,1035,4.455026455026455
264192,2,6300216225,"I saw this film with my grandmother at Radio City Music Hall as a child back in 1974 (I think this is the year).  I had not read the book at that time, and certainly did not like the movie.  Since falling in love with the soundtrack of Le Petit Prince (Richard Cocciante's and Elisabeth Anais's French version), I decided to give this film another look.  Also, it's considered a classic, so I thought maybe I'd like it better now.

I did like the main cast. I think Richard Kiley as the aviator was excellent and I very much enjoyed Steven Warner as the Little Prince.  Gene Wilder (the Fox) like always, was great.

The movie was really bad, though.  And, the musical score was appalling (I do not use this term lightly)!  The Little Prince, too, is filled with poor melodies and lyrics.  I am not a huge fan of Lerner and Lowe's, but these songs are just really atrocious.  I wound up fast forwarding halfway through most of the songs since they sounded horrid and repetitive.  Worse, they seemed to come out of nowhere with no real transition from dialogue to music.  The Prince's Rose, for instance, said goodbye coyly yet gently but then belted out her obnoxious and brash goodbye song.  And, it was HORRIBLE as were most all the tracks.  Really atrocious stuff. I'm surprised it even passes as music.

The main message here is wonderful.  The film does keep the main message, but if you don't know the book, some of the lessons learned and taught are lost in this film.  You reach the same conclusion, because it's spelled out for the watcher, but some lessons (vanity, too much work-not enough play, focus on money) are lost along the way. In addition, the troubled yet charming lamplighter is absent here.  Really, if time was an issue, why not cut out the horrendous musical numbers?  These planetary visits the Prince makes in the book are pretty integral to the story.

Again, the scenes between the aviator and the prince were wonderful.  Gene Wilder was excellent.  The supporting cast was okay, but they didn't get the book's points across.

I'm surprised anyone thinks this is a classic.  I have not seen the Rachel Portman's operatic version, but I can't sing the praises of Richard Cocciante's and Elisabeth Anais' version (LE PETIT PRINCE) enough.  Although it's not available with English subtitles, it is absolutely wonderful.  And, the lyrics to the songs are almost the exact words that Antoine de Saint-Exupery wrote, set to music.  So, if you have the book in English, you can follow along with the dvd film version without any issue.  In fact, the first song, Dedicace, is the exact dedication that Antoine de Saint-Exupery wrote, set to music.  And, Daniel Lavoie is perfect as the aviator.  The music to this is truly sublime.",1154822400,27,2753,4.686847599164927
264203,1,6300216225,"Many people have apparently enjoyed this, which amazes me.  It is as sugary, cheesy, and fake-tasting as some punitive junk food.  The child is a brat who makes one's toes and fingers itch; the adults are dead to any sort of shame.  (The memory of the pseudo-Fox capering round the trees is one I would pay a lot to exorcise.)  The worst thing about it is that it exposes something in the book that's better not exposed: its borderline cutesiness and mawkishness.  The book keeps its balance, and the result is haunting and beautiful; if you love it, I urge you to beware of this exploitation, which lunges right over into a swamp of stale marshmallow, and spatters the original too.  Try instead the new opera by Rachel Portman (also on DVD), which is delicate, reticent, and magical, and will remind you why you wanted to watch ""The Little Prince"" and not a romance between Danny Kaye and Tweety Bird.",1141171200,14,903,4.6125

264206,5,6300216225,"I cannot too highly praise this 1974 film of ""The Little Prince"" produced and directed by Stanley Donen. The presentation is rather that of an American musical or a ""Singspiel"": spoken dialogue interspersed with musical numbers. The lyrics and music of Lerner and Loewe do not terribly impress me but they are suitable and essentially effective.  To my surprise and delight, everything else works: Richard Kiley is absolutely convincing as The Pilot. His acting is first rate, he sings very well indeed, and his handsome, expressive face and athletic body present a Pilot who is at the same time very strong and very gentle. I think of the exuberance of the scene in which he and the Little Prince playfully splash about in the water of the oasis or of the final moments when his sense of loss and sorrow comes across so powerfully as he carries the Little Prince in his arms after the snake has given its gift of transformation and the essence of the child is no longer in his body.  Stephen Warner somehow speaks to me as The Little Prince, Saint-Exupery's Little Prince himself, incarnate in his every word and movement, and in the costuming as well.

The irrepressible Gene Wilder brilliantly zips about as a hyper-active and most loveable fox who allows himself (indeed desires)

to be tamed at last by love. The great choreographer Bob Fosse, at the height of his career, dances a shifty, jazzy snake, even if the length of the dance is a bit self-indulgent.  The visual movement back and forth between animals and human actors is very effective.  The ballet of the roses is delightfuly reminiscent of a production number in a 1930s Busby Berkley musical.

I should mention, in light of an earlier review, that since very ancient times the desert viper has been seen as a creature that both takes and gives life.  The snake is an agent of transformation.  Two snakes entwined on the staff of Hermes (Mercury) still signify the art of the physician and the science of medicine.  The Little Prince does not, in effect, commit suicide; instead, with the help of the snake he ascends to a higher plane; he returns to his beloved planet with its rose and three volcanos.  I have always found that children intuitively understand this, perhaps more easily than many of us adults who have been trained to fear snakes as harbingers of evil rather than as the wonderfully beautiful, lithe and complex creatures that they are.

All in all, I find this film a source of great joy and personally prefer it to the more recent operatic version of ""The Little Prince"" also available on DVD.",1114646400,72,2581,4.736607142857143
264207,4,6300216225,"""...just like her, it will break her heart.""  The little, nameless prince comments about his flower/friend who is his sole companion of his tiny planet whilst roaming through fields of wild rose bushes on planet earth.  I haven't read the book, yet the boa constrictor story is in both.  I know this because I once tried to read The Little Prince in Spanish to a little hispanic girl who started laughing hysterically when I got to the boa constrictor that ate an elephant part of the story.  My rudimentary Spanish did not include the Spanish word for boa constrictor in my  vocabulary, so I was totally clueless as to her reaction.  I had to ask her to explain to me in her rudimentary English, the story.  (So much for my bilingual story telling days!)  I do like the movie, though it's a bit dated and a little strange!  I'm not so bothered about the fact that the little prince decides to seal his fate by becoming prey to a poisonous snake.  What would you do if you were stranded in the middle of the Sahara desert with no one to take you back to your tiny planet, no telling how many light years away?  I'm no judge of content appropriate for small children, not being a parent myself, yet if you consider when Antoine de Saint-Exup&eacute;ry wrote the book, in 1943, and think of the fate of so many innocent children in Europe and elsewhere in the world during the world wars, I think one would realize that, unfortunately, little children are so many times witnesses and victims of so many terrible, and terrifying things.  Perhaps, Antoine de Saint-Exup&eacute;ry was trying to make some sense of that sort of tragedy in his book since he was actively involved in fighting for the French in WWII.  I love the story of the friendship that develops between the stranded pilot and the extraterrestrial, little prince which is mainly the plot of the whole story.  Watching the movie I was reminded of so many biblical themes, of wanderings, temptations in deserts, the fall of man in Genesis, of the symbolism of water in religious rituals, and of life's basic necessities such as friendship, love, food and water.  Plus, there are so many wise proverbs said by the little prince and his lost aviator companion to entertain.",1113091200,4,2232,4.643765903307888

Still, I thought the whole movie was a little too weird - in fact somewhat creepy.  I did not particularly like it.  Someone get the snake (Bob Fosse) an editor.  His dance scene went on soooo long I almost fast forwarded through it.  But I didn't because my 6 year old niece loved this movie.  Particularly Gene Wilder.  Go figure - one reviewer thought adults would get more out of it, just not the case here.  I think 6-7 is the highest age range that could really enjoy this movie.",1102636800,4,595,4.241071428571429

It has a superbly creative cast, especially Bob Fosse and Gene Wilder, who played snake and fox respectively. Bob Fosse's snake looks and moves would be imitated (and made more popular) years later by the King of Pop, Michael Jackson. The snake dance is more than enough reason to watch this. Gene Wilder, as the very wise fox, is so endearing. Steven Warner, as the very young prince, is so cute and lovable, you would want to take care of and protect him from all kinds of harm.

The music is great, too, especially ""I Never Met A Rose""",1097193600,13,637,4.482758620689655
264210,2,6300216225,"Ok, first some background info on my Le Petit Prince experience. I read Le Petit Prince in french class this year, in French of course. I also read the English version of the book soon afterwards. Furthermore I have read much analysis of the philosophy presented in the book. Then in French class my teacher brought in this movie. Before we watched it she warned us that it was really weird. I did not really know what to expect, I mean the book was pretty weird, how could the movie be weird if the book was considered normal. After these thoughts came throug my head she told us that the people don't talk, but they sing. Whoa...
Basically most everyone knows the plot I will just touch on it. The movie starts out with some weird singing about the hat that the narrator drew as a child and then goes into an overlong song about the narrator's need for air. So far this was rather weird I along with the rest of my class looked as if we were watching a fat man dance naked in the middle of the street. You know that look? Half sneer and half laugh. Well the movie continued to get weirder and I came to the conclusion that existentialist stories should never be turned into movies. However later it reached the pinnacle of its weirdness with the snake dance that lasted for much, much too long. Well at least we know where Michael Jackson got his gig.
The movie featured much of the same dialogue as did the book, sometimes the conversion was word for word. However the movie did skip over many of the imprtant scenes that really did explain Saint-Euxpery's philosophy. Furthermore the Little Prince's naivite was betrayed by his request to go to Earth. One of the important scenes that was skipped over was the scene with the king telling the Little Prince about judging yourself and the scene with the vain man was equally important.
Furthermore the Little Prince was obnoxiously cute, and although he was not a bad actor, in fact he was a really good actor for a child his age, we could have easily gone without him opening his mouth to sing on a couple songs.
In conclusion the movie was much too weird for my tastes and did change some of the things that made the book a great book. However it did manage to convert the book into a movie, from a book that was probably not meant to be a movie.",1086134400,11,2300,4.388758782201405
