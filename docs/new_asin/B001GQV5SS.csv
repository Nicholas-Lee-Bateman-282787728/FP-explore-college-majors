8306768,5,B001GQV5SS,"I loved reliving this game and remembering how it felt to watch those underdog, scrapping guys take the championship. I appreciated the extra minutes surrounding the game that were included in this DVD. Kudos to Tubby! He may be the only coach in the country who could have done it with this group of players.",1367539200,,309,4.636363636363637
