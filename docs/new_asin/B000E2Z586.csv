8104583,5,B000E2Z586,"This is not a well known film in the U.S., but growing up in Canada, I used to think of excuses to stay home from school when it was on TV. British humor at it's driest. Alastair Sim plays dual roles as a gangster and girl's school headmistress (in Drag). If you know Sim, he is an incredible actor, and played Scrooge in the old version of ""A Christmas Carol"". The acting troupe of Joyce Grenfell, George Cole, et al...made many British comedies, as well as the ""Carry On"" series. There are worse groups of girls these days, but in the 60s, these little monsters were busy blowing up the Chemistry lab, making gin, and fixing horse races. Alastair Sim as a female headmistress and George Cole as a shifty former stable-boy play off each other with ultimate and subtle  humor. Not everyone's cup of tea, but I own the movie and love it as a classic.",1225324800,,849,4.407643312101911
