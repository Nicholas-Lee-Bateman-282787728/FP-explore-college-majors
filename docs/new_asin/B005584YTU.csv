8457632,5,B005584YTU,"This is a great film for making a person think about the importance of life.  A boy commits suicide, and his friend has to wonder what he could have done differently.  Maybe making people feel that they belong, and being a friend would be life-changing for young people suffering from loneliness.  It is a journey of the soul.  The book has some ideas to implement this idea of friendship and caring for others, helping people to overcome depression, and the feeling of not being loved.  The movie has lots of conflict, true for kids today.  It didn't white-wash the events many teens are experiencing today.",1402444800,,608,4.742857142857143
