7849765,5,6303501036,This video is very interesting. I knew a lot about Gilda Radner as she has always been one of my favourite comedians. However I didn't know very much that happened to her after her SNL career was over... this video was a very sad eye opener. She was so talented and funny I am glad I got to hear her story through this great video. Rest in Peace Gilda.,1019433600,6,352,4.115942028985507
