7622484,3,B01B80LOIC,"The Ladder Match For The Intercontinental Title: Kevin Owens vs. Dolph Ziggler vs. The Miz vs. Sami Zayn vs. Stardust vs. Sin Cara vs. Zack Ryder was a four star match that was an excellent choice for a PPV opener. Ryder getting the win was a big surprise because hes barely been on television for a few years. I don't mind him as a performer, so Im happy he was able to get his WrestleMania moment. Of course it didn't last long since he dropped the title to Miz the next day. There were some cool spots in the match with Zayns dive under the ladder, Sin Caras splash onto Stardust on the ladder and Owens with that Frog Splash on Zayn on the ladder too. Ziggler didn't have enough spots where he stood out, which was a bit of a surprise to me. Other than that, it was pretty even in terms of giving each man a chance to shine. Since we are so used to seeing multi-man ladder matches, they never disappoint since they have a formula in place for what works. This was an above average match that got the crowd into the show from the beginning. The Chris Jericho vs. AJ Styles match had a surprising finish because I figured Styles was going to get the win at his first WrestleMania. They probably went the Jericho route just to surprise people by making it less predictable. When Jericho hit that Codebreaker and Styles kicked out, I figured for sure Styles would win. Why spend all that money to bring him in and try to make him a big deal right away? A win would have made sense. Nope. In terms of quality, I was expecting a better match. I don't think Im being too harsh in saying that. They just didn't get to that next gear in terms of intensity and nearfalls, but it was still really good for the most part. The Xavier Woods, Big E & Kofi Kingston vs. Sheamus, Rusev & Alberto Del Rio-6 Man Tag match was  okay. A pretty basic tag match. No surprise to see New Day lose a match where the tag titles aren't on the line. I picked the League of Nations to win because I figured they needed the victory more to get them some much needed momentum. Barrett factoring into the finish also works because thats the numbers advantage that the LON has in this match. Might as well factor that into the finish. The No Holds Barred Street Fight: Brock Lesnar vs. Dean Ambrose was a good match that was underwhelming because I had such high expectations for it. I felt like it was doing to be this 17-25 minute brutal battle that ends up being a classic as Ambrose keeps kicking out and never gives up. Instead, Lesnar won pretty easily because of his overwhelming power advantage. I kept waiting for Ambrose to find a way to get some believable nearfalls. They just never got to that point. As much as I like Lesnar and as good as he is, hes doing too many suplexes now and its not allowing him to tell a story in the match the way hes capable of. Maybe its my fault for getting my expectations up too high. I just thought they had great chemistry in the Fastlane main event in February. It just didn't match that level of intensity even though you would think that would happen at WrestleMania. It was still a good effort from both guys, but it was a bit disappointing. The WWE Womens Title (Divas Title): Charlotte vs. Sasha Banks vs. Becky Lynch was an awesome match that I rated at four stars out of five. Great nearfalls throughout, a lot of awesome submission holds and some big spots as well like Charlottes moonsault to the floor. The crowd bought into the nearfalls as well as the submission spots too. Sometimes the crowd doesnt care when a match is booked this evenly, but in this case they were into it in a major way. I think its arguably the best womens match in the history of WWEs main roster. There have been better on NXT, but for main roster its right at the time. Im a little surprised by the outcome because they did the Flair helps Charlotte finish so many times that I figured this would be the night where it doesnt work and theres a new champion. Instead, they are keeping the title on Charlotte. I don't have anything against her because I think shes a tremendous talent. I just thought it was going to be a night where Banks left with the title. Give them credit for having the best match on the show. No group of women could ever say that at a WrestleMania, so it was a history making night. The Hell in a Cell: The Undertaker vs. Shane McMahon was a really long match that probably went 10-15 minutes longer than it needed to be, but its no surprise that they hit the 30-minute mark. Obviously it was memorable just for the big spot by Shane crashing through that table. People can say what they want about the table being padded or whatever, but its pretty impressive to see a guy jump down 25 feet just for the sake of entertaining us. Im glad that Undertaker moved out of the way of it because that would have been a painful bump. Im also happy that they did the pin right after that because there was no reason for Shane to wrestle much longer after a move like that. They were smart to end it soon after. This was the definition of a match thats a lot more fun when you see it live compared to the television broadcast. The crowd was so ready for this match and it felt like it should have been the main event because the interest in the match was so high. I get why it didn't go on last, but it should have. I picked Shane to win because I felt like that Authority angle had to end and if Shane won this match they could have done that. They had him run Raw, but I don't think thats going to last long. The stipulations could have been better. At least it was a memorable match thanks to that crazy bump by Shane. The Andre The Giant Battle Royal was an average battle royal designed to put over a newcomer in NXT star Corbin, which is fine with me. My feeling going into this was that Braun Strowman was going to win, but he wasn't even in the match. You might as well use this match to put over somebody new instead of some older guy. I liked seeing Shaq out there. Hes always been a guy that I thought would fit in well with WWE. After WM, he said hes going to face Show at next years WM. Thats not a lock, but it makes sense to do it. The match was fine. Nothing special about it. The The Rock vs. Erick Rowan match was a pointless filler bout. Nothing more nothing less. WWE World Heavyweight Championship: Triple H vs. Roman Reigns was an average match that went too long with a finish that was very predictable. Hunter did well as the veteran heel that tried to wear down Reigns, but it just kept on going. The crowd was sitting there for over five hours by this point if you count the pre-show. Going a half hour in a match where the crowd doesnt like the guy thats supposed to be the face was a bad idea. We were tired sitting there for so long. The only thing that really popped the crowd was when Reigns hit that Spear on Stephanie by accident. It was obvious they were setting it up, but it still worked. To have a match at such a slow pace was dumb. They should have made this a No DQ type match with weapons because if they did that then the crowd would get into it. I assume they didn't go that route because of the Lesnar/Ambrose match earlier. I just thought they would have had a better match if they made it more of a brawl. Reigns has proven to be better in those situations, so why not do it for the main event on the biggest show? I think its a case of them hurting themselves with the booking. I give this PPV a 6 out of 10.",1460937600,4,7475,4.216329378925331

Now normally I give my summary at the end of the event but based off how people usually judge WrestleMania (and in this case, just one particular match alone), I'll just give it now.  It's no big secret that a lot of outside factors came into effect coming into WrestleMania this year that effected the availability of the talent due to injuries (John Cena, Seth Rollins, Randy Orton, Cesaro, Nikki Bella, Neville who's occurred only two weeks before the show, Sting & Daniel Bryan's retirement) while other factors such as the storylines & match stipulations (specifically how one was immediately reversed the next night on RAW) along with the lack of crowd support or creative direction for specific superstars coming into this event.  This year eliminated a lot of factors that I honestly can't stand sitting through (or at times a bathroom break) wasting time such as the celebrity match or musical performance which the only real criticism in regards to the show itself (depending on how you want to look at it) being the main show going longer than ever before at almost four & a half hours plus the extra kickoff matches lasting around over a half hour combined making sure this is one event you have to clear most of your day for if you want to watch it all in one sitting clocking in at over 5 hours.  In the end, I try to judge what the presentation that was given to us & not the other factors coming into & going out of the show which I admit that I thought wasn't one of the greatest Mania's of all time but better than some of the other ones that were given to us within the past decade as I enjoyed it along with the Hall Of Fame presentation & I recommend it.

Ladder Match: Intercontinental Champion Kevin Owens vs. Sami Zayn vs. Dolph Ziggler vs. Sin Cara vs. Zack Ryder vs. Stardust vs. The Miz - You knew the direction this match was going when multiple bodies were going to the outside to get ladders in the opening minute that had multiple moments such as the multiple bodies falling & pushed off the ladder, Stardust's tribute to ""a common man"" in more ways than one, men flying around off the top or over the top or on the outside of the ring in various ways, one man a falling off the ladder onto the top rope then springboarding off it to the outside, a superkick party, one man dropping an elbow like a ""savage"", more than one body going through a scaffold ladder on the outside, and a WrestleMania moment that was four years overdue in the type of ""car crash"" that you would expect from this type of match.

A.J. Styles vs. Chris Jericho - Styles' makes his WrestleMania debut as they were evenly matched early on with both men having counters to the other's offense including one person performing the other's attempted move as Jericho attempted to ground Styles slowing down the pace while Styles was able to pick it up using unique aerial offense from a springboard to top rope position as they traded momentum featuring sequences exchanging submissions & both men still having unique counters to their opponents trademark offense in another competitive match between these two.

New Day vs. League Of Nations (Sheamus, Rusev, Alberto Del Rio) - I would say something about New Day's entrance but it sounds so silly (in a good way) that you'll just have to see it for yourself while it should also be noted that King Barrett was at ringside.  New Day used tactics of trying to isolate one man into their half of the ring keeping a fresh man in only for the League to use the same strategy along with taking shortcuts to keep the advantage as both teams played to each members strengths weather it was just an individuals power or athleticism with it ultimately coming down to ""karma"" coming back to haunt one of the teams only for the aftermath to consist of a challenge being issued then accepted that nobody expected.

No Holds Barred Street Fight Match: Dean Ambrose vs. Brock Lesnar - You knew where this was going when Dean was taken to ""Suplex City"" repeatedly from the opening seconds causing Dean to eventually find a way to gain the momentum in his favor by taking advantage of the stipulation doing whatever he could do including sacrificing himself & using whatever he could get his hands on from kendo sticks & a heavy amount of chairs just to hurt Brock either in or outside of the ring as they went back & forth with some of their offense attempted offense not working how they designed it to be getting more physical as time went on as this told the story that we saw leading into the match where it was ""the beast"" against the man crazy enough to not only not quit but beg for more but the match itself came off more like a physical ""no disqualification"" match than what we would normally would get under a ""no holds barred/street fight"" stipulation.

Womens Championship Match: Divas Champion Charlotte vs. Sasha Banks vs. Becky Lynch - Just a couple of notes here but Lita earlier in the night revealed that the championship & term ""Divas"" would be retired with the winner of this match becoming the new Womens Champion, Charlotte's ring robe as a tribute to her father resembling his robe from his WrestleMania 24 retirement match, and Sasha's ring gear was a tribute to Eddie Guerrero while her cousin Snoop Dogg performed her entrance.  One woman was the odd one out right away only for it to immediately show that it's every woman for herself as there were times where it was one on one & all three women interacting with each other as each women displayed their individual style of offense including unique offense I don't recall seeing from them previously or moves that were pages right out of some Hall Of Famer's playbook along with various sequences between two women only for the third participant to take advantage or even one move taking about both opponents at once plus each woman displaying their submission tactics to going aerial on more than one occasion while Ric on the outside making his presence known as some times resulting in this being definitely the best womens/divas match at Mania in a decade (Trish Stratus vs. Mickie James at 22).

Hell In The Cell Match: Undertaker vs. Shane McMahon - It should be noted that this was Taker's third Cell match at Mania while Shane has a record of 2-0 at this event but his first match in 7 years.  Taker started out dominate using his trademark offense & the cell to his advantage continuing to take advantage of the environment while Shane would use the same tactics even surprising Taker using one of his signature moves against him & even having counters into his own moves as this match started to get more physical to the point where the cell couldn't contain the match anymore with both men continuing to use whatever they could & sacrificing themselves just to hurt the other guy as this wasn't as physical or violent as other recent Cell matches but Shane did what he always has done & give it everything he had leaving us with a memorable moment.

Andre The Giant Memorable Battle Royal - This was your typical battle royal but the highlights here included the special surprise entrants including an ex-(THREE TIME! THREE TIME! THREE TIME!) World Champion & someone who had a stand off with Big Show that made most involve just stand back & watch what was going to happen along with who actually won the match that definitely created a WrestleMania moment for a superstar to show that he has arrived.

Right around here was The Rock making his special appearance complete with a flame thrower & the Dallas Cowboy cheerleaders informing everyone of the event breaking the previous WrestleMania III attendance record (weather both records were the actual correct attendance number is another debate for another time) before getting into a confrontation with another group of superstars leading to not only another history making moment but also another unadvertised surprise.

WWE Champion Triple H vs. Roman Reigns - Triple H gained control using various tactics such as using his opponent's own momentum against him but also targeting specific areas of the body including his recently injured nose taking advantage of whatever could work in his favor from distractions to the environment around him along with same tactics that originally caused the nose injury while Reigns fought back using Triple H's own tactics against him getting more physical with the signature offense he delivered to the point where he delivered a spear that hurt himself in the process as they traded momentum with counters & delivering trademark moves with more intensity with not just the participants themselves getting involved in the action.  This was one of those main events that WrestleMania has had in previous years (Cena/Miz at 27, Triple H/Orton at 25, Cena/HHH at 22) where this wasn't a bad or unwatchable match & a good main event on any other PPV but had a lot of different factors that made this fall short of what you would expect from a main event & aftermath of WrestleMania.

(Kickoff Show) United States Champion Kalisko vs. Ryback - Ryback used his superior size to easily shrug off attempted offense & tossing him around both in & out of the ring along with using the outside environment to his advantage keeping him down beating on his back while Kalisko kept trying to ""hit & move"" using his speed to execute various strikes & lucha libre offense flying from different positions of the ring along with having counters to Ryback's attempts at overpowering him in what was a ""David vs. Goliath"" encounter.

(Kickoff Show) Total Divas (Brie Bella, Paige, Natalya, Alicia Fox, Eva Marie) vs. Team B.A.D. & Blonde (Lana, Naomi, Tamina, Emma, Summer Rae) - This multi-divas match featured such highlights as two divas who don't usually get a lot of attention towards them in the division going very hard against each other in the early moments, one of the divas having a lot of tension towards her own partners including one moment where one of her partners wanted a tag only for her to give a stiff tag in to one of her other partners, Natayla taking a page out of her father's playbook with one of the moves executed, the in-ring debut of Lana, one of the divas missing a move that caused her to bounce back hard off the ropes, the returning diva who was definitely the workhorse of her team, and the eventual face off between the two divas who started this entire issue between both teams as this was a solid match for all the women involved that's gone down as the retirement match for one diva who not only got her WrestleMania moment but also had someone else make an appearance afterwords.

(Kickoff Show) Usos vs. Dudley Boys - The Dudleys started off very aggressively & never letting up throughout the entire contest using illegal tactics & taunts aimed towards the Usos' own family before the Usos' were able to capitalize on an opening as this match was pretty short (just over 5 minutes) with the bigger issue here being the aftermath that saw one team going through the tables.

Also included is the annual Hall Of Fame ceremony honoring Sting, Fabulous Freebirds (Michael Hayes, Jimmy Garvin, Terry Gordy, Buddy Roberts), Big Boss Man, The Godfather, Jacqueline, Stan Hansen, celebrity inductee Snoop Dogg, Warrior Award recipient Joan Lunden, and the debut of the Legacy Award (Mildred Burke, Frank Gotch, Georg Hackenschmidt, Ed ""Strangler"" Lewis, Pat O'Connor, Lou Thesz, ""Sailor"" Art Thomas).

I already gave my thoughts at the beginning of this review but the bottom line is that strictly looking the matches & presentation itself & ignoring all the other outside factors going into or coming out of this event that I enjoyed this event & I would recommend it.",1460592000,6,11862,4.709257473481196

United States Championship Match: Ryback vs Kalisto (c)

Not a whole lot to say about this match. The feud was based off the 80s/90s cliche ""big guy vs little guy"" story and honestly, very few people had any interest in the feud going into Mania. The match itself was okay. Kalisto counters an attempted powerbomb into a hurricanrana, sending Ryback crashing into an exposed turnbuckle. Kalisto capitalizes with the Salida del Sol for the win

_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Team Total Divas (Brie Bella, Paige, Natalya, Alicia Fox, and Eva Marie) vs Team B.A.D. and Blonde (Lana, Naomi, Tamina, Summer Rae, and Emma)

Originally this was building up to be just a one on one match between Lana and Brie Bella, but somewhere along the way, a bunch of other divas randomly got involved for whatever reason, leading to this match. Apparently Nikki Bella was supposed to return and be a part of the match, but she wasn't cleared, so Eva Marie took her place. Forgettable match to say the least. Brie gets the win, defeating Naomi with the YES Lock. Nikki Bella comes to the ring in a neck brace after the match and celebrates the win with the rest of the Total Divas cast

_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

The Usos vs The Dudley Boyz

Decent match but nothing to shout home about. The Usos stop an attempted 3D and take the Dudleyz out with superkicks. D-Von is pinned and The Usos win. After the match, Bubba and D-Von attempt to put The Usos through tables but The Usos counter and put them through tables instead

(Wrestlemania Card)

1.) Intercontinental Championship Ladder Match: Dolph Ziggler vs The Miz vs Stardust vs Sin Cara vs Sami Zayn vs Zack Ryder vs Kevin Owens (c)

For the second year, an Intercontinental Championship Ladder Match opened Wrestlemania. Despite a lot of critics thinking this would be a clustered match, it really delivered. Lots of sick ladder spots, including one where Sin Cara is pushed off a ladder but he sprinboard moonsaults off the ropes to the other competitors on the outside. At one point, Stardust brought in a yellow polka dotted ladder as a tribute to Dusty Rhodes. Zayn drops Owens on his neck with a nasty exploder suplex on a stack of ladders. Zayn climbs up the ladder for the title but is pushed off by The Miz. Suddenly Ryder comes in and sends Miz off the ladder before climbing to the top to retrieve the championship. It was the first time in 5 years Ryder had won a championship on the main roster and it was well deserved. Hopefully this time around WWE doesn't derail Ryder's push right as the train gets going

_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

2.) Chris Jericho vs AJ Styles IV

This was the 4th time Jericho and Styles were going to battle and this time it all took place after Jericho had turned on Styles, less than 2 weeks after forming Y2AJ with him. Jericho became bitter and felt disrespected that fans were cheering for Styles over him, feeling that fans were treating him like trash and forgetting about all his accomplishments in the company. The match was just as good as their previous 3 encounters. There were a lot of false finishes and close calls in this match up that seemed like either man could've gotten the victory. Lots of neat reversals such as Jericho countering a Pele Kick into the Walls of Jericho and Styles countering the Walls of Jericho into the Calf Crusher. In the end, Jericho gets the win after countering a springboard move off from Styles into a Codebreaker. Great match from these 2

_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

3.) New Day vs Sheamus, Rusev, and Alberto Del Rio w/King Barrett

I couldn't understand what the purpose of not putting the Tag Team Championships on the line and I still don't. Either way, this was a simple 6 man tag team match for bragging rights as the superior team. New Day make a cool entrance, emerging from a life sized cereal box of Booty O's. They should seriously consider going back to the early 90s and making a legit cereal off of Booty O's. The match was nothing too special but it was manageable for the time it got. Constant momentum shifting between both teams with L.O.N. getting some nice heat from the Dallas crowd here and there. In the end, a Bullhammer/Brogue Kick double team from Barrett and Sheamus put Xavier down for the count, allowing Sheamus to get the win. After the match, the League of Nations brag about how no one can beat them. This brings out Shawn Michaels, Mick Foley, and Stone Cold Steve Austin to an outstanding pop from the crowd. They all attack League of Nations, hitting their finishers, getting the crowd riled up. Stone Cold drops Xavier with a Stunner at the end just for the heck of it. Average match with a much more memorable post-match segment

_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

4.) No Holds Barred Match: Brock Lesnar w/Paul Heyman vs Dean Ambrose

The build up for this match was well scripted that saw Ambrose prepare for the match with advice and guidance from 2 hardcore legends, Mick Foley and Terry Funk. Ambrose was given the baseball bat wrapped in barbed wire from Foley and a chainsaw from Terry. Ambrose was clearly built as the underdog going into this match and many expected him to win, but that wouldn't be. The match was just like any other Lesnar match you'd expect with endless german suplexes. Ambrose makes a comeback with a low blow and gets the advantage over Lesnar with a few weapons. Ambrose misses a shot on Lesnar with the barbed wire bat. A german suplex on chairs and an F5 later and the match is over. This match unfortunately didn't live up to the hype, which is incredibly sad because a lot of people were expecting this to be the match that stole the show. Even more were expecting the match to be really entertaining and probably close to part with Edge and Foley's WM 22 Hardcore match. It was anything but. There were barely any weapons used and not a lot of ""hardcore"" action went on. On top of that, Lesnar had no need to win. Major hit and miss with this match

_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

5.) WWE Women's Championship Triple Threat Match: Becky Lynch vs Sasha Banks vs Charlotte (c) w/Ric Flair

Initially this was supposed to be a Diva's Championship match, but on the week of Wrestlemania, rumors spread like wildfire that the Women's Championship was making a comeback. The rumors were true and Lita would present the winner of the match with the brand new Women's Championship (pretty much an exact replica of the WWE Championship, only with a white strap and a red plate). This match was historical for a couple of reasons as far as stats go. It was the first Women's Championship Triple Threat match to take place at a Wrestlemania since 19; it was the first time the Women's Championship was on the line since 2007; and the Women's Championship was finally back--marking the almost 8 year long run of the Divas Era. Sasha Banks had Snoop Dogg sing a rendition of her song to the ring. It's also worth noting that her attire for the match was inspired based off of Eddie Guerrero's from the 2004 No Way Out. The match itself was undoubtedly the greatest female match to ever take place at Wrestlemania. Charlotte, Becky, and Sasha took each other to the limits in this match and they were given a lot of freedom to work the match their way. It really felt like an NXT based women's match to an extent versus anything you'd see the females do on the main roster these days. In the end, Charlotte applies the Figure 8 to Becky. Sasha tries to get in the ring to break the hold but Ric Flair grabs her and keeps her from getting in the ring. Becky taps and we have a new Women's Champion. Many were disappointed to see that Sasha or Becky didn't get the win, but despite who you were rooting for, history was made on this night for the better. The Women's Division has been resurrected

_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

6.) Hell In A Cell Match: Shane McMahon vs The Undertaker (If Undertaker loses, he can never compete at Wrestlemania again/If Shane loses, he will be denounced as Vince's son and be written out of Vince's will)

This was one many--including myself has been highly anticipating. The build up was admirable but the match itself received some heavy criticism from fans before it even happened with a lot of people believing the match would be bad due to both Shane and Taker's age but they proved the critics wrong. The match starts off with some fair shifting action from Taker and Shane. The steel steps come into play as a weapon with Taker using it against Shane. Shane comes back and gets Taker in the bottom of a corner and rests a trash can firmly against the Deadman. A Coast To Coast gets a major pop from crowd, but the action wasn't done there. The match falls to the outside after Taker sent Shane through the wall of the cell. The action picks up on the outside with Taker breaking a sleeper hold from Shane, driving both him and McMahon through one of the announce tables. Shane is back up first and destroys Taker with a toolbox and lays him across the announce table. Shane begins climbing to the top of the cell as nearly everyone in the AT&T Stadium rise to their feet in anticipation of what's going to happen next. Shane makes it all the way to the top and takes a few seconds to catch his breath before diving nearly 60 feet off the top of the cell through the announce table, missing Taker. That will now and forever be one of the greatest Wrestlemania moments of all time. Shane somehow gets to his knees and taunts Taker to bring more. Undertaker brings him back to the ring and levels Shane with a Tombstone to go 23-0. Shane and Taker shut up a lot of the naysayers with this match. No, it wasn't a wrestling masterpiece. But it was highly entertaining, which Hell In A Cell matches are always supposed to be. Props to Shane McMahon for risking his body and being the first superstar since Rikishi, to take a fall off the top of the cell. For their age, Shane and Undertaker deserve nothing but respect for putting their bodies through this at their age

7.) Andre the Giant Memorial Battle Royal

This match consisted of mainly low carders and mid carders. The only ones that really stood out in this match were Kane, Big Show, Mark Henry, NXT's Baron Corbin, and appearances from the legendary Tatanka and DDP. There was also an appearance from Shaquille O Neal. Nothing out of the ordinary from the usual battle royal cluster. Shaq and Show try to fight each other, but all the other participants pitch in and work together to eliminate them both. In the end, Corbin eliminates Kane to win the 3rd annual Andre the Giant Memorial Battle Royal. Nothing big happened here. It's clear this was used as the cool down match to give fans a break before the main event

_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

After a short performance from the Dallas Cowboys cheerleaders, The Rock makes his entrance (probably his longest entrance ever), messing around with a flamethrower and lighting a display with his name on it on fire with said flamethrower, stops to flirt with the cheerleaders, and finally makes his way to the ring. The Rock says they're going to break records and announces that Dallas broke the Wrestlemania record for a grand total of 101,763 in attendance. Before The Rock can continue, he's interrupted by The Wyatt Family. Bray tells Rock he represents a lie and that this is not The Rock's Wrestlemania moment; it's his. Bray says he's going to eviscerate The Rock. After a couple of insults in retaliation from The Rock, he rips off his clothes to reveal his ring gear underneath and challenges the Wyatts to a match. Erick Rowan steps up and it looks like we've got a match

_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

8.) Erick Rowan w/The Wyatt Family vs The Rock

The Rock grounds Rowan with a Rock Bottom the moment the bell rings and covers Rowan for the win in a record 6 seconds (because record breaking at Wrestlemania should come at The Wyatts' expense apparently). Bray is livid and surrounds The Rock with Rowan and Braun Strowman and Bray. Before The Rock is harmed, John Cena's music play and sure enough Cena appears, making his return at Wrestlemania. Cena charges the ring and the 2 take out the 3 Wyatt Family members before celebrating in the ring with each other. I personally found this entire segment to be completely unnecessary. As if the Wyatt Family hadn't lost enough credibility, they got beat down at WWE's biggest show of the year for no reason. Disgusting segment if you ask me.

_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

9.) WWE Championship Match: Triple H (c) w/Stephanie McMahon vs Roman Reigns

Another big Wrestlemania entrance for Triple H. One of his best yet that sees some sort of army with skull masks, march alongside The Game to the ring with championships on their shoulders. Despite what negative people will say, this match was decently good. Perhaps the biggest moment of the match was Roman accidentally spearing Stephanie. In the end, Reigns ducks a sledgehammer shot and spears Triple H for the win. Wrestlemania 32 goes off the air with Reigns standing tall in his Wrestlemania moment

Overall: What can I say about Wrestlemania 32. I can say that it wasn't as good as I expected it to be. Many people--including myself were expecting at least 1 or shocks/surprises/twists at Wrestlemania but the ultimate twist of all was that there was no twist. Almost none of the overall favorites that fans wanted to see win, didn't. The match stealer of the night would have to go to the Triple Threat Women's Championship match. It had a real NXT vibe to it and Becky, Sasha, and Charlotte gave nothing less than their best for that match. I have no doubt that when fans remember Wrestlemania, the 3 biggest things they'll remember from it are Zack Ryder's Intercontinental Championship win; the Women's Championship match; and Shane McMahon's dive off the top of the cell that will forever be an unforgettable Wrestlemania. Overall, Wrestlemania 32 wasn't good but it wasn't bad either, but it's definitely nowhere as spectacular as Wrestlemania 31 and Wrestlemania 30. Most of the matches were good, it's just the outcomes of them that really leaves a bad taste in the mouth of many. Overall, Wrestlemania 32 gets a 3/5 from me",1459900800,7,15282,5.1220883534136545
7622487,3,B01B80LOIC,"This is a tough one.

For the past year, WWE has been in pain.  Between a slew of injuries, which can blamed on equal parts poor luck and WWE's need to overbook their top stars until they break, and a horrendous creative team making worse booking decisions than your 6 year old, WM32 was always going to be an uphill battle, despite record breaking attendance and Old Man Vince's claims it would be the best ever.  What resulted was a very strange show.  Most of the matches had good to great in-ring action, but had horrible endings.  The show loses all steam after Undertaker-McMahon, and the other two main events manage to be the worst matches on the card, marred by bland action, poor builds, bad booking calls, and un-reached potential.

SPOILERS AHEAD

Intercontinental Title 7-Way Ladder Match
Zack Ryder defeats Kevin Owens (c) and Dolph Ziggler and Sami Zayn and Sin Cara and Stardust and The Miz

Really fun match to kick off the show.  Despite being filled predominately with competent, if unspectacular jobbers (at this point, only Owens and Zayn are treated with respect), lots of crazy spots in this one.  The action is a little less chaotic and more methodical than last year's, which actually elevates it above last year's, as there's a greater sense of tension watching it.  Also, there's one NUTSO spot involving Owens and Zayn where I thought Owens might've had his career ended, luckily he's totally fine, because I love that chubby, rude, prizefighting family man.  Ryder winning is both cool and stupid.  It's pretty random considering how he's been booked, and ultimately damages the title's cred further.  But he's a competent, hard working guy who's basically been treated like crap, so it's also really heartwarming that he gets his moment.  Rating: 8/10

Chris Jericho defeats AJ Styles

A good match that I had hoped would be better.  Kinda slow, but the storytelling is solid, and there's a decent amount of variety.  On one hand, Styles feuding with Jericho is cool, and they kinda make each other relevant to non-hardcore fans.  But when I watch them, I think about how much better these matches would've been 5 years ago.  Jericho is still better than most, but he's been slowing down for a while.  I actually like the ending though, even though most will cry ""Styles was buried, Vince hates TNA!"".  Jericho winning evens the series, it was ""semi""-clean, which saves Styles without de-legitimizing Jericho, and Jericho's done so much for the company, it's a nice move to give him a WM win over such a great talent at this point in his career.  Rating: 7/10

The League Of Nations (Alberto Del Rio, Rusev & Sheamus) (w/King Barrett) defeat The New Day (Big E, Kofi Kingston & Xavier Woods)

Standard 6-man-tag fare.  No better than their Raw matches, and feels pretty pointless.  New Day's intro was awesome, and some legends come out after and give us another cool moment.  Rating: 4/10

No Holds Barred Street Fight
Brock Lesnar (w/Paul Heyman) defeats Dean Ambrose

Huge disappointment.  This had the potential to be amazing, tell a story where Dean gets mauled and overcomes all odds using everything at his disposal to inch out a win over Lesnar, but Lesnar just squashes Ambrose in 12 minutes, with only Singapore canes and chairs being used as far as weapons go.  No blood, no brutality, no feel good moment, no variety, just 12 minutes of a genetic freak suplexing your spirit wrestler.  Garbage.  Rating: 2/10

WWE Women's Title
Charlotte (w/Ric Flair) defeats Becky Lynch and Sasha Banks

The wrong girl won, watching Ric Flair put his gross, old, cheating hands on my Sasha was upsetting, and a few spots weren't totally clean, but this is MotN.  Again, the name of the game is tension and uncertainty, and these 3 amazing women know how to create it on a consistent basis.  Charlotte's moonsault might be the best thing she's ever done, it truly was beautiful.  A new Women's Title and new beginning kicked off with this great match makes it all the more special.  The event is worth owning for this match.  Rating 9/10

Hell in a Cell
The Undertaker defeats Shane McMahon

Two old men being old men.  But also showing that their love for wrestling and its fans is unmatched.  Slow, but captivating, it's watching a car crash in slow-motion.  Contains one of the greatest's spots of all-time from Shane, who now has grey hair.  The worst match I've ever seen that I'll also say I love.  Rating: 8/10

Andre The Giant Memorial Battle Royal

Pretty much an insult to Andre.  It's boring, gimmicky, and I don't want to talk about it.  If someone had to win, I guess the right guy did?  Maybe?  Rating: 3/10

The Rock defeats Erick Rowan

It's a Rock Bottom.  Also Rock Bottom for the show.  Tease a Rock match, have it last LITERALLY 6 SECONDS, and make a full-time wrestler look like a clumsy baby getting embarrassed by a retired wrestler turned movie star.  I hated everything about this.  Rating: 0/10

WWE World Heavyweight Title
Roman Reigns defeats Triple H

You knew it was coming, I knew it was coming.  We all hated it.  We knew it would suck.  But we didn't know it would suck for 27 MINUTES.  Constant booing for Roman, apathy towards Triple H, probably tied with Hogan-Yokozuna as worst WM closer ever.  Rating: 3/10

WM32 has its moments, and it has enough of them to make this worth checking out.  But tread lightly, and probably turn it off after that weirdly bad, weirdly good Hell in a Cell match.

Show rating: 5/10 (light recommendation) (7/10 if you stop after Hell in a Cell)",1459814400,4,5538,4.72565445026178
7622488,5,B01B80LOIC,"The headline for this years WrestleMania was change, and change was exactly what we got. By change I mean seeing the future of the WWE competing, some of whom competing in there first official match in WWE on the grandest stage of them all, and boy did they deliver.  don't worry we still got some historic nostalgia surprises which I won't give away, have to watch those for yourself.  Now all of this would not be possible without the help of one man as Vince blew the cover on the story on raw non other than Shane O mac. 6 years ago Shane O MAC was called in by Vince to save the WWE from bankruptcy and extinction as all top superstars were on there way of walking out the door for good as Triple H and Stephanie drove the business to the ground as Cena got title after title, and The Miz vs. John cena in the main event at WrestleMania 27,  The next night on raw if you were there to watch, we together watched history unfold, and the start of change in WWE that was much needed, and every fan was waiting for.  There it was the main event for WrestleMania 28 announced the day after WrestleMania 27 Shane o Mac saved the company overnight,  yes I said overnight.  WrestleMania 28 John cena the superstar of new taking on the Superstar of old The Rock.  5 years later seeing the matches that were never supposed to happen, or to people that thought that the matches were impossible to make happen happened under Shane o Mac.  Not to mention the future of the WWE roman reighns, seth rollins, dean ambrose, Bray whyatt, kevin owens, aj styles, nevelle Korbin, and sami Zayne just to name a few.  Shane even made a great effort to gain full control over WWE in a mach last night against the Undertaker inside hell in a cell but came up short.

I wasn't sure what to expect from that one going in--not that Shane McMahon is a slouch in the ring, an--even at his advanced age--I was sure Taker would be the one asked to carry most of the match. But Shane and the Dead Man put on a classic & no doubt, Shane's death defying leap of the top of the Cell will be hard to top by any future HIAC matches.

The Women's match was another highlight--perhaps the best women's match I've seen, period. The Rock made a humurous return to WrestleMania, Brock Lesnar nearly killing Dean Ambrose was entertaining--in short, not a bad match or dull moment from the entire show.

7622516,4,B01B80LOIC,"So I finally got the time to review this event (I guess I am a little behind) and I am a little on the fence about the event.  I felt that it had some fantastic moments but there were also some moments where I was left shaking my head (especially since I have seen what has happened since the event has aired which we will talk about).  Anyway, I thought that the event was half descent so here is what I thought of the event.  (There will be spoilers because let's face it, the event happened like 2 months ago so most of know the results already anyway)

The event begins with a pretty good rendition of America, the Beautiful by Fifth Harmony which leads into a pretty good standard opening promo.  I think most of felt that the event would begin with the ladder match for the IC title and we were right.  This is almost always a good way to start a show and get the crowd into it.  So the first match up was for the Intercontinental title in a Ladder match.  The match featured Kevin Owens, Zack Ryder, Sami Zayn, Dolph Ziggler, Sin Cara, Stardust and the Miz.  I have to say that I felt that Owens was going to win or maybe Zayn.  Never in my wildest dreams did I think Ryder was going to win.  It was such a shock and just a great way to open the show.  I like it when the WWE surprises me (which they still do once in a while).  The match itself was wild with Sin Cara taking some huge bumps and Owens taking a massive bump on his head that I thought was going to give him a pretty good concussion but it didn't.  Anyway good match.  (9/10)

After that we get a commercial (still don't understand why the WWE needs to play these freaking things because eventually it gets to be like watching television).  Next we get the events that led up to Styles/Jericho IV.  So the next match would be AJ Styles taking on Chris Jericho for a 4th time.  These two have had some great matches in the past and this one was no different.  Seeing AJ compete at Wrestlemania has been a dream of mine for years and he did not disappoint at all.  The match was fantastic and very competitive.  I did think (and was right) that AJ would lose.  First off, I never understood why he was booked in this match anyway.  They had their trilogy which AJ won and now they were having a 4th match!  Why?  I also knew that Vince would never let someone who had great success in other companies win at his show (just look at the previous year when he had Sting lose for the love of God).  Other than that though, the match was a great success and one that I enjoyed.  (10/10)

After that we get another commercial, a post match interview with Zack Ryder and a special ring introduction for the New Day which featured them coming out of a box of Booty O's which was great.  The next match would be the New Day taking on the League of Nations which had Sheamus, Alberto del Rio and Rusev.  The match itself was actually pretty good and had each member of each team showing off their skills.  I don't think the League should have won but that's what happened.  After the match we see them cut a promo which leads to Mick Foley, Shawn Michaels and Steve Austin coming out to shut them up.  That was great but I wish they would have been used another way.  Still, the match was entertaining and it was great to see the 3 legends team up as well.  (7/10)

So after this match we see all the events that led up to the Street Fight between Brock Lesnar and Dean Ambrose.  This match really disappointed me.  I thought it was going to be so much better than a basic squash match.  I mean they made Dean look so weak against Lesnar.  Honestly, all Lesnar did for 13:00 was suplex Dean which is getting a little old to watch.  I mean I know he has the whole Suplex City thing and all that but it gets old seeing him do just that.  I thought the match would have been so much better and I think the fans at AT@T stadium did also.  (5/10)

So after that match we get a Snickers commercial featuring Ric Flair, Zack Ryder and Charlotte.  We also see footage of the Hall of Fame ceremony and the introduction of the Hall of Fame class for 2016 which this year was kind of an up and down class.  First off we see Joan Lunden get the Warrior Award for her battle with cancer. We also see Snoop Dogg go in the celebrity wing as well.  We did get to finally see the Freebirds go in (I felt this should have happened at WM 25).  Unfortunately we did not get to see Terry Gordy or Buddy Roberts go in as they have since passed on but we did get to see Michael Haynes and Jimmy Garvin speak. They did have Kevin Von Erich come out as well but a lot of what he said made no sense.  We also saw Stan Hansen (great) go in, Jacqueline (great), The Godfather, Big Bossman and Sting (finally) go in.  During Sting's induction we do find out that he has decided to retire making it that much more of a sad affair.

After all of that we see some footage of Lita retiring the Divas title and renaming it the WWE Women's Championship and it would go to the winner of the women's triple threat match that night.  That match would feature Charlotte taking on Sasha Banks and Becky Lynch.  This match was awesome!  It may have been the match of the night.  Everyone performed like beasts in that ring.  Sasha did mess up one move but it was wasn't all that bad.  Charlotte took the match over.  She rocked it and in my opinion may have been the MVP of the night.  Se would pick up the win and take the newly crafted title back with her.  This was just a fantastic contest and may have been the best women's match ever put on at a WM event.  (10/10)

So after that we get the events that led up to the Hell in a Cell match with Undertaker taking on Shane McMahon.  The whole ""selling point"" of the match was that if Shane won he would get control of Raw away from Vince and Stephanie and Taker would never be able to wrestle again at a WM event.  I've heard that the original plan was for Taker to take on John Cena but after Cena went down with an injury this is what we get.  The match itself was not bad (I don't care what other people say).  The first 12:00 or so was pretty boring but after that the match really picks up with some great highspots including Shane jumping off the top of the cage to go through a table.  The match itself is a little over 30:00 with Taker picking up the win.  What I hated was what happened the next night on Raw.  Vince gave Shane control of Raw that night and the next week and the next and so on, so it was like what was the point of the match?  Shane lost but he still gained control.  It made no sense whatsoever.  Other than that, the match was pretty good.  Let's face it:  It could have been worse.  A lot worse.  (8/10)

After that we get another commercial and some talking points with the pre-show crew.  After that we get the Andre the Giant Battle Royal which sees NXT star Baron Corbin win.  I was happy about this because I actually like Corbin.  He reminds me of a young Barry Windham.  The battle royal itself was pretty standard but the ending made it surprising and exciting.  (7/10)

After that we get another commercial and then the venue for WM 33 is announced (Orlando again?) and then there is a performance by the Dallas Cowboys cheerleaders.  The Rock then has to come out and it takes him freaking forever to get to the ring because he has to play to the crowd and then he has to light his name on fire with this blow torch and then he has to strut to the ring and then he has to talk and talk and then he has to tell us all about the attendance record set that night.  Finally the Wyatts come out to confront him which was pretty good.  This all somehow leads to a ""match"" with Erik Rowan (all of 6 seconds) which the Rock wins.  The Wyatts again and then a still healing Cena comes out to help and it was basically 20 -25 mins that we will never get back.  I would have liked to have seen Rock take on Bray Wyatt because Bray is so good and always buried that it isn't funny but once again he is thought of as an after thought.

After that we get another commercial and the events that led up to the main event.  What a crap match!  It was terrible!  By now the event was already over 4 hours and now we had to sit for another 27:00 boring minutes just to see Roman Reigns beat Triple H for the title (something everyone already knew which was no surprise).  It was just bad.  Triple H is good but even he couldn't turn this match around into something good.  (5/10)

 I have heard that the WWE had placed microphones around the stadium to make it sound really loud in there but it backfired with Reigns.  The fans were booing him so badly that the WWE had to turn off some of the microphones to make it sound like he was turning the fans around when in fact they were still booing the crap out of him.  All in all, it was just a bad final hour to the show.  Between the Rock and his stupid stuff he had to do, to the main event it was just a bad last hour.  Plus, I watched this on the Network which had streaming issues the whole night with the screen freezing up and getting all pixelated to HD going in and out.

All in all the event wasn't too bad (I would say a 7/10) but it wasn't great either.  It suffered from being WAY overblown clocking in at like 4 hours and 50 mins to the Rock segment which bored fans to the main event which bored fans as well.  The rest of the show was actually pretty good with just minor things that were bad here and there.",1466553600,,9466,4.124247400109469

7622535,4,B01B80LOIC,"I would like to review the packaging of this product, as it was a major decision for me as to why I purchased this product on Amazon. Best Buy is the only other retail location that I am aware of that still sells WWE blu Rays and they have Wrestlemania 32 available for $27.99 this week (release week) in a Steel Book package. I am not a big fan of steel books. Never really saw the appeal.

This Blu Ray edition sold at Amazon comes with an amazing slipcover. It is a raised and embossed slipcover. I am more than glad to pay a couple extra bucks to get the edition that I enjoy. I know that many may prefer steel books, but I prefer the slipcover.

As for the show, this was an average Wrestlemania. WWE still pulls enough rabbits out of the hat to make it exciting, but the novelty starting to wear a little thin white the same legends appearing. One not that I would like to make is that the pre-show matches that are included as bonus features on disc 1 are edited, more specifically the Eva Marie boos. The cut out her entire section of the match. In honesty this was pro ly done so they could fit more data on the blu ray, as this Wrestlemania goes way overtime. You actually have to watch the HHH and Reigns main event on the 2nd Blu Ray!! Also included on the 2nd Blu Ray is the entire Hall of Fame ceremony, including Stings retirement speech.",1463097600,6,1353,4.22007722007722
7622536,4,B01B80LOIC,"An amazing spectacle & some very good matches but some very odd outcomes/booking decisions. Ryder winning the IC Title Ladder Match?! Jericho beating Styles? (Also why not have Jerichio & Styles in a Ladder Match since it was their third match & put Zayn & Owens in a singles match for the IC Title like a lot of fans wanted?) League of Nations beating New Day? ...in what was essentially a pointless non-title match. Ambrose losing AGAIN?!?! (Also I think a lot of fans expected this match to get much more violent & intense since it was a No Holds Barred Street Fight). Charlotte winning another title?? Shane losing but then running RAW anyways??? & Finally the rather boring & extremely predictable main event that almost all fans disliked. As mentioned by some, the only really cool part of the match was when Reigns speared Stephanie & while I usually love Triple H's awesome, bloated, Mania entrances, this one was really weird & creepy. Overall still a fun & entertaining show but kind of a weird card.",1463011200,,1010,4.711864406779661

7622538,3,B01B80LOIC,"Intercontinental Championship Ladder Match: Dolph Ziggler vs The Miz vs Stardust vs Sin Cara vs Sami Zayn vs Zack Ryder vs Kevin Owens: Zayn VS Owens could have stole the show but they opted for the mult-man match for the second year in a row. The usual crazy spots make this a great opener. However, just like the rest of the card, people complained about the outcome & WWE would fix the problem the next night on Raw. Ryder wins in a shocking moment & most fans thought he would lose it the next night, which he did to the Miz.

Chris Jericho VS AJ Styles: This was the fourth time they met & another good match up but I wouldn't call it a classic as Jericho wins in the end, enraging a lot of fans as Styles should have gone over. However, Styles would win a #1 contenders match the next night for a world title shot.

League of Nations VS New Day: The hottest act going into WrestleMania, New Day, goes in & loses to Nations in another head scratching decision. Why did Nations win? Well here comes Stone Cold, HBK, & Foley to beat up the Nations but Austin does deliver a stunner to Woods to end the segment. New Day has gone stale since 'Mania & Nations has broken up.

Dean Ambrose VS Brock Lesnar: This had a nice build up to it & could have shot Ambrose to the main event level. The match was rather short & Lesnar goes over via f5 onto chairs. Ambrose is stuck in a feud with the stale Jericho & Lesnar leaves WWE until he is needed again.

WWE Women's Championship Triple Threat Match: Becky Lynch vs Sasha Banks vs Charlotte: The divas title is now called the women's championship. The match was good as all 3 women can go but Charlotte retains in the end.

Undertaker VS Shane O' Mac in a Hell in the Cell Match: If Shane O' Mac wins then he gets control of Raw, Taker loses then he cant compete of Mania again, & if Shane loses then he is written of Vince's will. This was not a wrestling match but a series of bumps from Shane as he even dives 60 feet off the cage, misses Taker, & lands onto the table with a nice pillow underneath. Taker wins this match & Shane is defeated. However, Shane has been running since this loss & WWE looks stupid once again even though Shane has improved Raw 100% in my opinion.

Andre The Giant Battle Royal: Tatanka & DDP make a return as Shaq makes a surprise appearance to fight Big Show in what will probably be a match at next years event. Anyways, NXT's Baron Corbin debuts & wins this decent Battle Royal.

The Rock makes his way down to the ring in a long, time wasting entrance. He announces the inflated attendance record before Wyatt Family makes their way down to the ring. Wyatt says it's his moment as Rock undresses to reveal his Ring gear & we have a match but instead of Bray Wyatt, he got Erick Rowan instead.

Rock VS Rowan: This unsuspecting surprise ends within 9 seconds. The Wyatts beat on Rock until Cena makes a return to help out the Rock, maybe a prelude to next year. The whole segment was a waste of time & buried the Wyatt's even further.

Roman Reigns VS Triple H: Typical WrestleMania main event with the Triple H getting another blown up entrance. The match was decent as the highlight was Roman accidentally spearing Stephanie. Roman stands tall with his newly won title.

Overall, like I said most of the results angered WWE fans but they were overturned the next night on Raw with Shane in charge. expect for Roman winning the belt. The WWE has gotten better since this cluster&*( of a Mania even though the wrestling wasn't bad at all.",1462060800,,3519,4.318181818181818
7622539,3,B01B80LOIC,"The matches (with the exception of the main event) were really good. The Woman's championship match absolutely stole the show. But as I said before, the ending to most of these matches just fell kind of flat. Could you imagine the pop Sasha or Becky would have gotten if they won? The roof of the stadium would have absolutely exploded. But as I said before, these potentially great finishes were sacrificed for mediocre finishes.

If this Wrestlemania proves anything, it's that Vinny Mac has his favorites and he's gonna stick to em regardless of what the fans say.",1461801600,,567,4.785714285714286

WRESTLEMANIA 32

This Mania was the big one that had been talked about for years. Not because of any matches but because of where it took place, Arlington Texas. The world famous Cowboys Stadium or AT&T Stadium, whatever. Since I live here in Texas you know what that meant for me and my crew, much like The Royal Rumble the next year in San Antonio. So I am sure you know ahead of reading this that we enjoyed it.

Spoilers.

1.[U.S. TITLE]KALISTO VS RYBACK-the opening match of the night would be for United States Championship. I actually really liked the little storyline with these two as Kalisto had defeated Ryback previously and he could not stand it. This match was absolutely wonderful and is one of my favorites of the night. Kalisto was the defending Champ but he looked like a star in this match, to bad most people in the arena didn't see it as they were still filing in. Ryback looked like a beast at times here tossing the smaller man around but Kalisto used his speed and high risk maneuvers to his advantage. There was even a superplex attempt that was really fun. Kalisto would end up with the win and keeping the title.

2. NATALYA, EVA MARIE, PAIGE, ALICIA FOX AND BRIE BELLA VS LANA, NAOMI, EMMA,TAMINA AND SUMMER RAE-another match in which the building was still not full yet and that really annoys me. This was one of those matches that was there just to get more talent on the show. This was also not only the Wrestlemania debut of Lana but her wrestling debut as well in WWE. All of the women get their moments to shine but I was really interested in Lana and Eva Marie and how they would do at the time. They did just fine as did everyone else in this match. It had a good quick pace with great moments for these [for the last time being called Divas] women. Brie would make Naomi tap to the Yeslock for the Total Divas team to win.

3. THE USOS VS THE DUDLEY BOYZ-this was another fun match with Hall of Famers against future Hall of Famers. The Dudleys start out really string taking it to the youngins with a hard hitting brawling style. The Usos turn things around eventually and many a super kick is thrown. At one point The Dudley Boyz look as though they are gonna win only for a few more super kicks to do them in giving The Usos the victory. Afterwards they attack The Usos and grab the tables only to have the tables turn on them as The Usos fly onto them with some splashes.

4.[I-C TITLE LADDER MATCH]KEVIN OWENS VS THE MIZ VS SAMI ZAYN VS STARDUST VS SIN CARA VS DOLPH ZIGGLER VS ZACH RYDER-this is a great way to start off the main card part of the event. Every single participant here does an excellent job and no one is wasted. There are many high spots including a great Sin Cara moment and some scary ones as well, Owens. I also loved Stardusts tribute to his father with the yellow polka dots not only on his trunks but also the ladder. This was an excellent match and one of the better ladder matches at Mania. Also it was a great moment for eventual winner Zach Ryder, which no one expected.

5. CHRIS JERICHO VS AJ STYLES-the match I was most looking forward too as I love both of these guys, seriously two of my all time favorites. This was a great match with both guys really knowing the other. There were some great counters and back and forth action here. The pace also went back and forth between slow and quick but I thought it served the story very well. The ending with Y2J hitting that codebreaker out of nowhere was great, giving him the win. Great match.

6. THE NEW DAY VS RUSEV, SHEAMUS & ALBERTO DEL RIO-ah the short lived League of Nations with those three plus Wade Barrett [or King Barrett I mean], I really had hopes for them. I really do miss factions in the WWE. Any way this was a good match with the always entertaining New Day [Saiyan suits and all] trying to work against the numbers game that the League had. Great back and forth with many near falls broken up by team members. The League end up with the win in a fun match, but the aftermath was the best. They say there is no one that can beat them, until someone does. Home state boys Shawn Michaels [my favorite of all time] and Steve Austin are joined by Mick Foley and lay them all out. They then are joined in the ring by New Day only for one of them to take a stunner. Oh and I love that giant Booty-Os box.

7.[NO HOLDS BARRED MATCH]BROCK LESNAR VS DEAN AMBROSE-now I know that some people were disappointed in this match but it was exactly what I was expecting so I was ok with it. Ambrose was his usual crazy self and was not afraid of the beast and it showed here. He went after Brock throughout the match using kendo sticks and chairs to try and cut Lesnar down. Still Lesnar was indeed a beast as he would maul Dean and take him of course to suplex city. That of course was more than enough to give Brock the win in a good and entertaining match.

8.[WOMENS TITLE]CHARLOTTE VS BECKY LYNCH VS SASHA BANKS-this match was for the Womens championship and not the Divas, thank god because I always hated that term. Going into this match these three were the hottest acts in the womens division easily and it made sense that they would be featured here. The action was excellent here with all three women delivering at a high level on the grandest stage of them all as they say. There are all kinds of near falls, close calls, saves and action throughout including Charlottes moonsault to the another competitors on the outside. This was an important match for the women as a whole and these three delivered. Honestly this might have been the match of the night. Charlotte wins the match with a figureeight on Becky while her father Ric Flair holds Sasha back from winning. I would also like to point out that this was the beginning of the end for Sasha I think. She was red hot before this and then I just feel like they started dripping the ball with her after this. Becky seemed to cool off a bit as well but regained her steam a little more since then.

9.[HELL IN A CELL]THE UNDERTAKER VS SHANE MCMAHON-this match was crazy as I am sure all of you reading this know. The fact that Shane was even able to hang with Taker is a little ridiculous but that is always the case with Shane. He should never be able to go up against any wrestler and hold his own but since the beginning in this world and stories he can, so I am cool with it. Shane of course does indeed hold his own here for a good portion of the match but Taker dominates for the most part. This match will always be remembered for the jump off of the top of the cage and rightfully so. With that said I thought the match as a whole was very good plus it was cool to see coast to coast again.

10.[A.T.G.M.B.R.]-I am a huge fan of battle royals so I always look forward to this match. This one starts out fun with Big Show and Shag taking everyone out and then teasing what could have been for those who know. After that the match really starts and it is just a fun match to watch. Baron Corbin ends up winning this one as they like NXT guys taking this battle royal.

11. THE ROCK VS ERICK ROWAN-at this point the Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders came out followed by the Rock who does his usual thing. The crowd loved it until the Wyatt Family came out and interrupted the fun. It turned into a very quick six second match in which Rock hits the Rock Bottom for the win. Afterwards John Cena came out to help out Rock.

12.[WWE TITLE]TRIPLE H VS ROMAN REIGNS-now I am going to go ahead and say this and get it out of the way, this is a better match than it gets credit for. This has some good action and drama behind it but the people are just so against Roman. I get it but don't let it ruin a match for you. Anyway I did enjoy this match although we all knew the outcome before the event even started. Good brawl type match with Roman winning the strap after taking out both Steph and Triple H.

Over all this was a great event, full of fun moments and good matches. The set also comes with the Hall of Fame Ceremony from that year. Highly recommended for any wrestling fans out there.",1525132800,,8085,4.268276762402089
