1283274,1,B00003CXN4,"This movie is a complete ripoff of ""Traffik"" by Simon Moore , who's BBC production of this story won an Emmy for best foreign drama some years ago - it galls me that Big Shots Soderburgh and Michael Douglas have resorted to ripping off others ideas because thier empty heads are incapable of writing anything good of thier own. If any 1 is interested in seeing the original it is available thru BBC video or the Masterpeice Theatre collection on PBS.org...shame on you Soderburgh, and we aren't surprised by you Douglas.",977097600,7,520,4.725274725274725
1283275,5,B00003CXN4,"I guess I'm a late bloomer Soderbergh fan because Out of Sight was the first film of his that I saw, but the way it was put together was hot to me and so I was really excited to see Traffic.  A buddy of mine is friends with someone at USA and got us into a preview screening last week, the movie is awesome.  Soderbergh is a clever guy and the way each of the story lines are put together with a different look and feel is pretty cool. The other thing is the stellar performances that this guy gets out of his cast.  Benicio Del Toro was amazing, it was nice to see Catherine Zeta Jones playing a hard ass, there's a bunch of cameo's, but standouts to me are the duo of Luis Guzman and Don Cheadle.  These guys are very funny as DEA agents staking out Zeta Jones and they will get the recognition they deserve as actors after this film.  Did I mention Benicio Del Toro, his performance is oscar caliber and hopefully he gets his this time.  So, enough blabber, cool film.  Nice to see big dollar pictures made that aren't all gloss and smiles.",976060800,12,1043,4.185
1283276,5,B00003CXN4,"Benicio Del Toro owns this movie. He gives a truly extraordinary perfomance of rich nuance and subtlety. He doesn't chew scenery or display any actorly pyrotechnics. Instead, he give a focused intense performance that conveys his character's inner moral torment mostly through non-verbal means.
Steven Soderbergh working at the top of his form as both director and cinematographer does the best work of his career.
It's thrilling to see a film of this kind of ambition and depth.",975888000,7,479,5.153846153846154

Reading this book, I found that I was interested in going back and revisiting this film.  While ""Traffic"" is still disturbingly realistic (and I mean this in a good sense), it is a fantastic movie.

Mike Douglas as the head of the American side on the issue is desperately seeking new approaches ""outside the box."" But none seem forthcoming. It appears that the movie's scriptwriters and its director himself lack the knowledge or courage to present such new approaches. They mention the necessity for dealing with the demand-side of the issue, but it is not given a full airing.

1286270,5,B00003CXN4,The film that Britain sees fit to ban. What's it about - it's about the way that Children's Services in the U.K. (condoned by the police and the courts) act to meet government targets on adoption. It is a film that everyone should watch and help put a stop to what 'Public Servants' are getting away with in Britain today,1427760000,,321,4.366666666666666

1286272,5,B00003CXN4,"Essential for anyone involved with Social Services and so called 'child care' a frightening exposure of how corrupt the government authorities have become, lying and falsifying evidence to ensure children are 'available' for adoption where huge amounts of government money is flowing to incentivise adoption.  This money often going into the hands of local government departments and associates of social workers or former social work employees themselves.  Chilling and heartless.  A must watch for all parents accused and under threat of having their children removed.  This is a secret court system with 'gagging orders' preventing anyone from speaking out.  The outcome for the children is often a hundred times worse for the children removed from their families, abuse, prostitution, illiteracy and innumeracy, crime, unemployability, addiction and homelessness.  This is the reality of 'corporate child care' no one in local government is actually accountable or responsible for these children.",1427587200,,1000,5.722972972972973

1286275,3,B00003CXN4,"There is no real plot. I thought it would be something similar to CRASH, where there are multiple mini plots that all tie in at the end (albeit very conveniently.) But this movie does not really tie in any of the other characters' individual plots/circumstances. Yeah, they are all connected in the sense that everyone is connected to the drug trade in some way, whether it be as a member of a drug organization or member of the government/law enforcement. The multiple plots never directly tie in to each other and to be honest, the entire movie I was hoping that each character's story would end in some meaningful significant way. No. It wasn't a bad movie...it just lacked an arcing plot. I mean here are the main characters and a gist of their circumstances (no real ending spoilers,but basically where each character is coming from):

-Michael Douglas: Judge on the up and up and appointed the nation's drug czar while his drug-addicted daughter is pimped out by her drug dealer. So while Douglas fights the drug war on a national level via policymaking, he is struggling to rein in his own daughter's problems)
-Don Cheadle: DEA agent who loses his partner in the drug war and is basically conducting surveillance throughout the film (seriously)
-Benicio Del Toro: Uhhhh, Mexican cop...uhhh he's innocent, but then he's crooked, but then he's innocent because he's helping the U.S. government...I lost track. Didn't really impact the story much or at all.
-Catherine I love to eat ZITI Jones: Drug cartel wife living the good life in La Jolla and is just looking out for the best interests of her hubby who is under trial for, well you know...drug trafficking!

Some of these characters never even come into contact with each other. It's not a bad movie by all means. Just a bit frustrating about the lack of a main plot that ties in all the characters. I rank my ""favorite movies list"" by the number of times I re-watch a movie and this is one I would NEVER watch again. It's just not worth it.",1427068800,,2002,4.684659090909091

I hope the Traffic crew will go further with Traffic II, Traffic III etc, and the system will get prosecuted, afterwords, and will get considered as a national disgrace.

There is no doubt in my mind that the SS are doing more harm than good as they purport, or pretend, to protect the nations children, this is a merciless poor joke! I have spent the last 4 years helping mothers and fathers fight against these monsters and liars at the SS, evil is the word for them. Many social workers have come to realize the injustices taking place and have left and retired from their jobs, at least some of them have a conscience and perhaps not all are so bad. I myself have been heart broken in losing all contact with my son Elliott, this was at the hands of Cafcass, or as I like to call them ""The Legalised Court Mafia"" they are partners in crime with the SS and have no hearts or sympathy for any parents.

1286375,5,B00003CXN4,"A true, indepth film, discover the world of corruption, lies and deceit that is the broken system we call 'child protection' - it simply does not work, with many children being stolen from loving families on the flimsiest of excuses.
Those who are paid to protect and help the vulnerable children of the UK often simply start a catalogue of false records, manipulation, twisting of words and social engineering at an alarming speed on order to take children for adoption purposes.
These are not actors, they are real families who have been caught up in the brutal system, only to lose their children through draconian measures, behind closed doors, in secret courts.
There is no bias toward class, colour, creed, anyone and everyone is at risk of intervention that can sweep them away in a tidal wave of dishonesty and allegations.

I am not going to spoil the plot here, the reason they want to keep it out of the UK is because what is happening to UK families is nothing more than criminal. The film exposes all of the inner workings of children's social care, the family courts and the solicitors, barristers and QC's that are paid billions every year in tax payers money.

I would urge anyone who is thinking of having children, or who already has children, to buy this DVD and educate yourself.

If you don't have the knowledge of how to keep your children safe from authorities, or don't have a clue about the current system, or never heard of FORCED ADOPTION, CHILD STEALING BY THE STATE, STOLEN CHILDREN, LEGAL STATE KIDNAP, STOLEN CHILDREN OF THE UK, SECRET WORLD OF CHILD PROTECTION or SECRET FAMILY COURTS, then please buy this DVD to educate yourself and to help keep your children safe.

You will be horrified at what really happens to our children. Our children whom have NEVER been abused by us parents, not one shred of evidence to legally and lawfully have our children removed or support the social services absurd and unfounded accusations.

The only way to put a STOP to this is to EXPOSE them for what they are doing. And TRAFFIC does exactly that!!

Granted some children genuinely DO need protecting from their parents and should be removed, BUT the majority of children removed (STOLEN) from parents don't need protecting from them, they NEED PROTECTING from the Social Services!!!!

I was impressed with the acting, the shifting of character perspectives (that on some level all tied together), and the point that the movie drove home primarily through events instead of words, although Michael Douglas' speech at the end of the movie made it quite clear for anyone who perhaps didn't get it (the pointlessness and destructiveness of the War on Drugs). I walked out of the movie theater thinking that it was a great movie, and today, it still still stands as one of my favorites, especially in regard to being so unexpectedly good. Part of the reason I decided to write this review is that I noticed the movie had less than a 4-star rating, which really doesn't do it justice. Maybe some people who watched this movie have a hard time handling the grim reality of it.",1402617600,,882,4.5886075949367084

Most of the stories are preposterous, take for example the wife of a drug dealer, in a few weeks she is talking to dangerous drug leaders in Mexico as if she knew what she was doing. Also, the drug czar wandering around in the ghettos of Baltimore, these scenes do not add up and as a result the film is mostly a compendium of utter boredom that drags on.",1387152000,,600,4.31858407079646

1286844,4,B00003CXN4,"""Traffic"" tells three different stories in one movie, interwoven together, and using a different sets of saturation and colors to differentiate all three. The stories all deal with people affected by the war on drugs. Sounds ambitious, right? Well it is. It's a risky gamble taken by Director Steven Soderbergh, but for the most part, it works.

In my opinion, the most interesting story presented here is that of Michael Douglas, a judge who is about to be tapped as the U.S. drug czar. What makes his story all the more interesting is that his 16 year old daughter is a heroin addict. Douglas gives a really understated, yet powerful performance in his role and I think it's among the best work he's ever done.

What doesn't work so well in Traffic is that since the narrative jumps from story to story, the pacing of the movie isn't fluid. Some of the stories are moving at a faster pace than others, and that starts to weigh the movie down.

If you're a fan of Steven Soderbergh, then I would recommend Traffic.",1381449600,,1015,4.596685082872928

1286910,4,B00003CXN4,"""Traffic"" by Steve Soderbergh is a well-done film with its handheld work and bold color grading.  The most intriguing element of the film to me was Bencio Del Toro.  He had an understated quality of a man who is navigating incredibly dangerous worlds.  Even more so in 2013 than when the film was made.  In Soderbergh's film, nobody gets really angry.  There is an even tone throughout.

On another note,  watch the original ""Traffik"" which was a German TV mini-series.  It is superb and more gritty.  I thought it was terrific.  Many scenes from ""Traffik"" were lifted into the Soderbergh film.

I was the producer of a documentary called ""American Federale"" which deals with an American Citizen who became a Mexican Federale policeman - and had to juggle the cartels, his everyday life and legitimate police work in the process.  It's up on Amazon now and is an insightful gaze into this world.  ""Lobo"" is the cop (we don't use his real name) and has stories that he can tell.

The movie is in English with optional Spanish, French, and English subtitles. One of the stories, however, the one where Del Toro is involved, is just in Spanish but you can watch it with English subtitles if needed. It had to be done this way to keep the whole plot connected. The other three stories are in English. In one of the stories, the one that takes place in Tijuana, the lighting is not so good. Maybe they did this to capture the real atmosphere.

Too many lives have been lost, and it still goes on today without an end in sight. That makes this film just as relevant today, as it was a decade ago, and will be a decade later, unless major moves are made. Director Steven Soderbergh (Oceans Trilogy, Erin Brockavich, The Informant!, and so many other great films) has crafted a near masterpiece. There are some things I wasn't too fond of. Perhaps at times, Soderbergh's tendancy to oversaturate the picture with yellow or blue color grading became more of a gimmick.

1287097,5,B00003CXN4,"Maybe Steven Soderbergh's best film and one which he won an Oscar.  The movie won 3 others including supporting actor Benicio Del Toro who plays a Mexican state police officer involved in curtailing drug smuggling near the Tijuana/San Diego border.  The movie is a complex drama with 3 distinct stories going on at the same time.  The stories intersect at times but do not neatly end up at the same point in the end.  Catherine Zeta-Jones plays the pregnant wife of a drug kingpin in San Diego who is jailed because of a captured snitch who ratted him out.  The other story involves Michael Douglas as the newly appointed national drug czar whose own teen age daughter is captive to cocaine and heroin.  As you can imagine, you have to pay attention.  The movie is shot a lot with hand held cameras, but it is done in a way that you just feel you're along for the ride.  This technique is used primarily where action takes place.  For example, during a drug raid or when someone is running up a flight of stairs.  Another technique which was a bit of a distraction was the different colorization of the film.  Again for example, much of the scenes in Mexico had an almost brown tint.  When Douglas' character is first seen in his Cincinnati home town, everything is shot in a murky black and white.  The cast is chock full of actors now much more famous on the big screen and television.  Many probably owe much to this film. It's a classic.",1321747200,,1441,4.492307692307692

1287099,5,B00003CXN4,"Traffic(released Dec/2000) sports a high powered cast with a very compelling storyline that has more than a few messages to impart to us about the so called ""war"" on drugs,in this case,between the U.S. and Mexico. Based on the /89 British mini-series,with another mini-series made in the U.S. in 2004,director Steven Soderbergh first pitched and wooed Fox films for backing. But due to their differences Fox dropped the project and USA films picked it up. There were still minor difference to iron out but in the end Soderbergh got full control over the project and what a job he did. Who could go wrong with a powerhouse cast of the likes of Michael Douglas,Benecio Del Toro,Luis Guzman,Don Cheadle,Catherine Zeta Jones,Dennis Quaid,Salma Hayek,Amy Irving,Albert Finney,James Brolin,Benjamin Bratt and many more.
The plot has three simultaneous stories unfolding, each touching the other ever deeper as the film winds its way to the end. First there are the two Mexican state policemen,Javier Rodriguez(Del Toro) and his partner Manolo Sanchez(Vargas) and the drug war between two drug cartels in and around Tijuana,Mexico;between the Juarez Cartel and the Obregon Brothers Cartel. Enters General Salazar(Tomas Milian)supposedly working for the army and the government but in reality being used by the Juarez cartel to snuff out the Obregons. The General puts the squeeze on Javier and Manolo and they are soon working for him. But eventually they both start filtering info to the U.S. government,with Manolo getting taken out for his efforts by the General. Eventually Salazar himself,with Javiers info,is taken down as his corruption is revealed to the media on both sides of the border.
The second story involves an Ohio judge(Douglas) who is appointed to a presidential taskforce on drug control. As he familiarizes himself with the formidable task before him,the drug war he is fighting is closer to his home than he thinks. Their daughter Caroline(Erika Christensen)needs for nothing,lives in a beautiful home and goes to a private school. However along with several classmates,she is deeply involved with drugs. Her life spins faster and faster out of control with her parents apparently unable,too busy or just in plain denial,to do anything about it. In the end her father tracks her down to a sleazy motel room and finds her naked in a bed,higher than a kite. He takes her home and both she AND her parents attend recovery meetings with her faithfully. The judge gives up his position as the head of the task force to deal with his daughters problems.
The third story involves two DEA agents by the names of Montel Gordon(Cheadle) and Ray Castro(Guizman).The two become involved in the take down of a local businessman Eduardo Ruiz(Miguel Ferrer),who runs a local storage facility but is a front for drug smuggling. The bust goes down but just as the DEA swoops in,local law enforcement,unaware of each others involvement,gets the jump on them. The confusion caused,almost allows Ruiz to escape. Ruiz eventually decides to turn his drug boss over in exchange for immunity. His boss is also a local businessman,Carlos Ayala(Steven Bauer)and when he gets taken down his wife(Jones)is left to fend for herself. On a jail visit he tells her about a painting in their study. She investigates and finds the names of local contacts including a hitman and several out of country accounts he has. When she is threatened by a rep from the Mexican drug cartel for a money debt,the Obregan cartel in fact,she decides to pay a visit to them personally. She smuggles in pre-molded cocaine which is totally undetectable by sniffer dogs or any agents;this one being in the shape of a toy. In exchange for this new way of smuggling drugs she asks for total control of the drug distribution in the U.S.from the cartel,forgiveness of the money her husband owes and to take out Ruiz,the DEA witness. The deal is made and in short order Ruiz is dispatched through simple food poisoning. Because of this the DEA's case is dropped and Ayala is set free. However the DEA still plugs away as agent Gordon crashes Ayala's homecoming party,planting a bug under his study desk.
The subject of drug trafficking is a sordid and complicated mess. The movie amply points out that the drug lords have more of EVERYTHING when it comes to resources than any government agency. The well known corruption of the Mexican government both state and local is also fleshed out. The so called""war"" is anything but;more like a rout in reality. Money buys alot and the government not only has to contend with the Mexican drug trade but also their tentacles,which stretch into the very fabric of North American society from those that sell it(from the big shots to the little guys on the street)to the buyers themselves. Soderbergh does a masterful job unfolding all three stories and in a non-complicated manner. This film won four Academy awards and it is not surprising to see why.
Technically speaking this print was made from a new digital transfer,with the Spanish subtitles presented as they were in the original U.S.prints,as per the directors request. It is in its original a/r of 1:85:1 and is clear and crisp. The soundtrack was mastered from the original 24 bit master and includes Dolby 2.1 and 5.1. There are two discs. The first contains,the movie,three commentaries,two music cues not included in the film,and more. The second disc includes:25 deleted scenes with commentary,a look at making the Mexican film sequences,an editing demo,dialogue editing demo,theatrical and TV trailers,30 minutes of additional footage(this film was originally 180 minutes),and more. It is all housed in a two section snap case with a small booklet included.
All in all a highly recommended film. No wonder that the film won four Academy awards with this cast and great storyline. And of course as I always say:A Criterion release is a superior release,so you know you are getting the best.",1318118400,,5952,5.04979674796748

IF, in the future, Universal decides to take things seriously and make a better transfer; I'll buy it because the movie is so good.

The quality is fine.  The movie is noticeably grainier than a lot of other movies, but I think this was intentional for cinematic effect and is part of the movie.  You can tell as parts of it are grainier, and harsher in appearance.  Like for instance most of the Tijuana scenes are quite rough.",1297641600,3,599,4.303571428571429
1287104,5,B00003CXN4,"My personal feelings for `Traffic' as a whole have had quite the yo-yo effect.  When I first saw the film I really loved it.  Over time my adoration has dwindled but upon a recent viewing I have come to respect it more than I think I ever have.  While it is still a flawed work and one that I don't consider a major triumph, I feel as though the ambitious nature of the film is worth applauding and consider it a very integral part of this past decade.

The film tells three separate stories that overlap telling a fuller story concerning the war on drugs here in the US.  We have the newly appointed government drug czar, Robert Wakefield, who struggles with his new assignment as well as with his wayward daughter Caroline, who has a serious drug habit of her own.  We also have Helena Ayala, the beautiful yet nave wife of a recently incarcerated drug-kingpin.  And then we have Javier Rodriguez (Benicio Del Toro in his Oscar winning role), the conflicted police officer who serves as the films moral center; one of shifting focus and impending consequence.

While at times it feels as though it bites off more than it can chew, there is so much going on here that it seems to more than make up for its faults.

The acting here is pretty much sensational.  Del Toro is the standout, delivering a natural and completely inhabited performance, but he is not the only actor at the top of their game.  Michael Douglas, who is not an actor I am overly fond of, delivers his best performance, in my humble opinion, as a concerned parent folding under the pressure or raising awareness as well as a daughter.  Speaking of that daughter, Erika Christensen is simply brilliant here.  The way she constructs her characters addiction is heartbreaking and sincere.  This film is all about grit and realism and she masters that with her beautifully tragic performance.

Don Cheadle, Dennis Quaid, Topher Grace and Catherine Zeta-Jones only form a small fraction of this talented cast.

The true star of the show here is director Steven Soderbergh.  With a film that tries to do so much, Soderbergh keeps throwing it at us, visually as well as thematically.  Where the script may drop the ball or find itself (at times) bogged down, Soderbergh makes sure that the visual feast before us is captivating yet raw and unnerving.  While I would not have handed him the director award myself, I totally understand why he got it.  He takes each story and builds its own separate mood and feel yet ties each story in, creating a cohesive and complex portrayal of human interaction and suffering.

There is a universal `flow' that permeates this film and makes it work even when it technically shouldn't.

So, in the end I highly recommend this.  My rating is back to an A because, despite its flaws, `Traffic' is a great film that works to its strengths and delivers in the end.  It is a film that definitely understands its subject and it is something we can appreciate and glean from even now, ten years down the road.",1274140800,,3002,4.620754716981132

1287166,5,B00003CXN4,"""Traffic"" is as timely now as when it was released in 2000. The American belief in the efficacy of the ""War on Drugs"" is put to the test in this movie. Michael Douglas plays the newly appointed drug czar, and he learns firsthand from his own daughter what a fruitless and pitiful effort is this thing we call the ""War on Drugs."" As long as there is an insatiable demand for drugs in the United States, there will never be anything called a victory. The efforts put into the supply side are shown to be farcical. On the supply side corruption and crime are endemic.
The war is really a series of skirmishes. Failures in the ""drug war"" cause many deaths and misery.
 The movie is told in a series of stories with each of the storylines having a set of characters that at times intersect and form the bigger picture. Two detectives on the American side (Don Cheadle and Luis Guzman) in San Diego are tracking a drug ring while two detectives on the Mexican side in Tijuana are going after a major cartel. One of the Mexican cops, Javier, is played brilliantly by Benicio Del Toro.
 The American drug boss and his wife form one of the story strands. In an effort to save her husband she becomes as ruthless and cold-blooded as he.
 What ""Traffic"" illustrates is that it's the actions and honesty of ordinary cops who win small victories in the ""war against drugs"" that count, not the futile efforts of misdirected national movements.
 The movie is long, but fascinating and worth sticking with. Some scenes are filmed in sepia tones. It's an intense and very significant and pertinent film.",1260489600,,1586,4.573943661971831
1287167,3,B00003CXN4,"This is an ugly story in parts but still fascinating to watch  for the unique way it's presented, especially for those who like a different visual/audio approach.

As for the acting, Michael Douglas usually plays interesting roles and this is no exception. Benicio Del Toro got an Oscar for his role but I don't know why. He wasn't anything that special. Personally, I liked Don Cheadle and Luis Guzman in here better with the latter adding some much-needed humor to the film. Miguel Ferrer was also intense as the bad guy, ""Eduardo Ruiz.""

The two kids who played Douglas's daughter and her boyfriend (Erika Christensen and Topher Grace, respectively), received no billing on the back on the DVD but they had major roles. They must have done a good job because they really irritated me. The girl's descent into drug hell was not pleasant to view. This is not an easy story to watch, or comprehend everything that's going on. It also is not one with a happy message.

The visuals were great with many all-sepia toned scenes, or all blue hues. Scenes changed every two minutes to a different ongoing. You had to really pay attention but I never found myself drifting away from the story.

It isn't just the unique visuals; it's an interesting and disturbing story.",1244246400,,1263,4.748858447488584

And disgusted by Americans cavalier attitude towards their nasty habits and the fact that it's getting people killed.

1287172,4,B00003CXN4,"While people are currently complaining that we are fighting a foreign war that we have no way of winning, there is in fact a homeland war that is looking just as grim that gets far less media attention. That war is the war on drugs, a war that is examined in all different angles in Steven Soderbergh's exceptionally brilliant ""Traffic."" ""Traffic"" covers drugs from beginning to end. While ""Crash"" and ""Babel"" may have ultimately brought the craft of hyperlink storytelling to popularity, it was ""Traffic"" that originally perfected the art of telling a single narrative through different perspectives. We get to see the drugs shipped from Mexico to America, we get to see the drug dealers explain their side of the story, we get to see the congressmen who are attempting to fight drugs, and we finally get to see teenagers who use the drugs themselves.

It's mind boggling to see how much of an impact drugs really have on our culture and on the lives of our fellow man. Soderbergh filmed ""Traffic"" on a digital camera of things, which gives the movie the look of a home video. The color tones also differ from character to character, demonstrating the mood they're currently in. For example, a cop in Mexico is surrounded in a glow of orange, giving the viewer a feeling of what viewing Mexico for the first time is like. Then we look through the eyes of a teenage girl who is taking drugs, and the world looks hazy and blue, except for light which seems to be brighter then it should be. It's a great stylistic choice, one that benefits the film and makes it look as fresh and inventive today as it did seven years ago. But my goodness, I must be out of my mind.

I haven't even discussed the storyline with you yet, and here I am jumping into the art of the film making. I think this is the first (as my brother calls them) ""talking drama"" film I actually did this on. And now that I've dipped in with a small analyst of the film making, I want to point out that the acting is excellent. Michael Douglas as Congressman Robert Wakefield particularly stands out as the congressman who goes to congress meetings pitching his plans to enforce the war on drugs, only to run into a conflict when he discovers his daughter Caroline (Erika Christensen) is a drug addict herself. Benicio del Toro may have walked away with the Oscar for his portrayal of the conflicted Mexican cop Javier Rodriguez, but in my eyes Michael Douglas steals this movie right out from all the other actors.

Though I must admit, Don Cheadle comes dangerously close as Montel Gordon, a man who has captured a key witness who's testimony could send a major drug lord to jail for life. His witness singles out the husband of Helena Ayala (Catherine Zeta-Jones), who is shocked to discover this secret life her husband has been living (which has supplied the income she never really questioned before), but feels compelled to get involved in the business after her son is threatened by another drug lord. All of these stories could be their own movie, yet ""Traffic"" roles them all into one very effectively. These storylines contribute to each other so beautifully, that it's like watching a well-made documentary (which, ironically, is also what the film looks like thanks to Soderbergh's digital camera technique).

""Traffic"" caused considerable amount of controversy when it was nominated for five Academy Awards. Of the five ""Traffic"" took home four, including Oscars for Best Director, Best Adapted Screenplay, and Best Supporting Actor (I guess I should also mention it won for Best Editing, seeing as how sub-par editing could have easily killed this film). The only Oscar it did not win was Best Picture, which went to Ridley Scott's ""Gladiator."" Yes, I know people tend to accuse the Academy Awards for taking themselves too seriously, but at least this year the Academy members shut their brains off and gave the Best Picture award to one of those brainless action movies average movie goers constantly (and ignorantly) claim are better then Oscar winning films like ""Casablanca"" and ""Titanic.""

Even if you LIKED ""Gladiator"" there's no denying that ""Gladiators"" film quality is certainly not on the same level as ""Traffics"" is, and it's certainly not as memorable. Yeah, I know the two films are different, and thus should be exempt from comparison, but seeing as how both films are actually two and a half hours long, I find it interesting when people compliment ""Traffic"" for feeling ""half as long"" as it's advertised, where with ""Gladiator"" I've never heard people comment on the film feeling short then it really is. People who do watch ""Traffic"" compliment the unique style of filming in the movie, but with ""Gladiator"" they only seem interested that the movie looked cool. ""Traffic"" is a classic film that is just as relevant today as it was seven years ago. It's still daring today, it's still important today, and it's still just as fascinating today. Dare I say it, ""Traffic"" losing Best Picture was the biggest snub since the snubbing of ""Raging Bull.""

1287227,4,B00003CXN4,"I still don't understand the love for Crash, the recent film centering on the racism issue. It seemed like a film that had a couple good ideas but they were featured in a bad movie which makes its win for Best Picture all the more confusing. That film for some reason reminded me of Traffic which centers on another important issue; this one being about the drug war and its effects on addicts and non-addicts. While you can obviously tell Traffic is an important film and it is indeed a good one, it's also slightly marred by erratic pacing and a bit of uninteresting characters.

The film, unlike let's say, Magnolia or Short Cuts, is 3 separate storylines with one thing in common: the drug trade. In one story set in Ohio, Robert Wakefield is the newly-appointed ""drug czar"" crusading against decreasing the amount of drugs in the country. However, he has a daughter that's quickly starting to get addicted. In San Diego, Helena sees her husband arrested while she's unaware he's a key player in the drug trade with another captured by DEA agents who is going to testify. And finally in Mexico, a highway patrol cop gets involved in the corruption between drug cartels and the want for control of the drugs going in and out of Mexico and the US.

To help the audience differentiate the different places, a color code has been given to each segment. The Wakefield story looks so unbelievably blue that you wouldn't be surprised if character blood looked blue too. San Diego looks more traditional but a bit overexposed making it more brighter while Mexico looks like an indie movie with a very gritty and raw feel and a jittery looking camera. It helps keep track of where you are but like I said, you've never seen skin tones look so blue before; they really overdid it in some cases.

The best storyline is most likely Mexico since it's anchored by Benicio Del Toro who certainly deserved his Oscar. It's also got a more interesting story and a better look to it despite its intentional amateurishness. The one that isn't that great is probably the Wakefield story since it never gripped me all that much. San Diego was alright but nothing to special. Ultimately the problem with the film was that the film just felt slow. Ever watch one of those movies where it feels like you've been watching for longer than the movie is? Not to mention that sometimes one storyline is starting to get interesting then whoosh! off to somewhere else. A similar problem plagued Babel since the Chieko story was ultimately more emotional and gripping than the others. Some will probably disagree and say all stories in Traffic were good but I always groaned slightly when we moved away from Mexico.

It's certainly an ambitious film so not going to argue there and it's a great film at times but I wouldn't say it was my favorite film of 2000.",1171756800,,2831,4.644710578842315
1287228,3,B00003CXN4,"Traffic is difficult for me to review since I really enjoyed the film but before you purchase be aware that the intent of the Director is to deliver a grainy, washed-out picture throughout the film.  In the places where Traffic is intended to deliver an oustanding picture without washed-out images it certainly does.

Images of the early bust, courtroom and 'life at home' are rich and detailed - via projector in 1080i.

1287231,5,B00003CXN4,"This is a raw and powerful movie on the drug trade and its corresponding law enforcement response. It is a series of riveting, interlocking vignettes that tell the story on all fronts of the war on drugs. It paints a picture that will stay with the viewer for some time, so powerful is the imagery employed and so compelling are the actors in their performances.

Michael Douglas plays the part of Robert Wakefield, a newly appointed drug czar, who tries to mount an all points attack on the drug trade. Naive and well meaning, he is, unbeknownst to him, being manipulated by the powers that be in Mexico, who are fighting a turf war over the profitable drug trade. He is so clueless that when the drug war actually lands on his door step, as when his teenage daughter, wonderfully portrayed by Erika Christiansen, succumbs to peer pressure and becomes addicted to drugs, he is initially in heavy denial. He ignores all the standard warning signs, until it is nearly too late.

Benicio Del Toro, in the star making role of Javier, an intelligent, decent, and honest Mexican law enforcement officer, who has his own war on drugs going on, is riveting with his quietly powerful performance. He, too, is being manipulated by the powers that be in Mexico. Nearly too late he realizes that the Mexican general, who is ostensibly battling the war on drugs and to whom Javier had given his full support and cooperation, is engaged in some drug action on the side from which he hopes to profit. The only drug war that the general is really involved in is the one that one drug cartel has with its rival.

Meanwhile, back in the states, a wealthy and respected San Diego businessman, played by hunky Steven Bauer, is arrested, as it seems that his businesses are really just a front for the drug trade. His assets frozen, this leaves his beautiful and greedy wife, played by the lovely and talented Catherine Zeta-Jones, picking up the pieces of her husband's empire while he is in jail, awaiting trial. As regent to the kingdom, she cold bloodedly negotiates with the drug cartel to restore her and her husband financially. No shrinking violet is she!

There are several other subplots that are also of note and move the story along. All of these vignettes interlock with one another in some fashion, serving to bring the story full circle. To find out how they do so, watch this well directed and powerful film.

1287293,5,B00003CXN4,"This is a raw and powerful movie on the drug trade and its corresponding law enforcement response. It is a series of riveting, interlocking vignettes that tell the story on all fronts of the war on drugs. It paints a picture that will stay with the viewer for some time, so powerful is the imagery employed and so compelling are the actors in their performances.

Michael Douglas plays the part of Robert Wakefield, a newly appointed drug czar, who tries to mount an all points attack on the drug trade. Naive and well meaning, he is, unbeknownst to him, being manipulated by the powers that be in Mexico, who are fighting a turf war over the profitable drug trade. He is so clueless that when the drug war actually lands on his door step, as when his teenage daughter, wonderfully portayed by Erika Christiansen, succumbs to peer pressure and becomes addicted to drugs, he is initially in heavy denial and ignores all the standard warning circles, until it is nearly too late

Benicio Del Toro, in the star making role of Javier, an intelligent, decent, and honest Mexican law enforcement officer, who has his own war on drugs going on, is riveting with his quietly powerful performance . He, too, is being manipulated by the powers that be in Mexico. Nearly too late he realizes that the Mexican gweneral, who is ostensibly battling the war on drugs and to whom Javier had given his full support and cooperation, is engaged in some drug action on the side from which he hopes to profit. The only drug war that the general is really involved in is the one that one drug cartel has with its rival.

Meanwhile, back in the states, a wealthy and respected San Diego business man, played by hunky Steven Bauer, is arrested, as it seems that his businesses are really just a front for the drug trade. His assets frozen, this leaves his beautiful and greedy wife, played by the lovely and talented Catherine Zeta-Jones, picking up the pieces of her husband's empire while he is in jail, awaiting trial. As regent to the kingdom, she cold boodedly negotiates with the drug cartel to restore her and her husband financially. No shrinking violet is she!

There are several other subplots that are also of note and move the story along. All of these vignettes interlock with one another in some fashion, serving to bring the story full circle. To find out how they do so, watch this well directed and powerful film. It is certainly well worth watching and a welcome addition to one's personal film collection.",1148688000,,2500,4.675

1287298,5,B00003CXN4,"It's hard for me to see things in life in anything other than a red  state vs. blue state way (also of course, pro vs. anti-Israel).  Because of this, I may be hypersensitive to the films of people whom I may personally and passionately disagree with (paging Steven Seagal and your anti-American/CIA conspiracy theories).  Mr. Soderbergh is someone whose politics I certainly don't agree with, but he has done an incredible job with this powerful film.
Inevitably, when I watch this movie (today, 4.23.06, was at least the fourth time), I sob.  Maybe it's the overall message regarding our ""war on drugs.""  Probably though, it is the scene of this powerful judge trawling the projects looking for his strung out daughter, desperate and powerless.  When he finally saves her under the weight of a ""john"", she just looks up at her father and smiles--comfortable and at peace, if only momentarily.
Perhaps the other factor affecting me so much is the point I believe Mr. Soderbergh makes so well:  that we may all be a little guilty in the war on drugs.  This includes the enablers, the family members who turn a blind eye, and all of us who could do more to help others.  Michael Douglas makes this point so well when he strays from his prepared remarks while being introduced as the President's new point man to lead the fight against drugs.
As a film, the cinematogrpahy in this movie is without match, in my view.  Mr. Soderbergh does not seem obsessed with a ""West Wing"" like agenda of ""it takes a village"" socialism/leftism/Hillary/Bubba/Michael Moore/Howard Dean/Kerry & Edwards to solve the world's problems in this film.  Some of the MoveOn.org/Kedwards/Michael Moore/MSM/Daily Kos voters may be disappointed in this aspect of it, but smart people will remember that everyone from enviromental whack job Al Gore to GWB, have battled in the struggle with drug addiction and alcoholism.
A wonderful and though-provoking film.",1145750400,,1929,4.959627329192546
1287299,5,B00003CXN4,"I had first watched this movie back when it was released on DVD at about 3 in the morning at a friends house and quickly fell asleep.  When I woke up in the morning my friend said I didn't miss much and said that the movie was boring and sucked so I shouldn't bother watching it again.  So I never did.  Then last week my wife rented it and said she wanted me to watch it with her, so I did.  I was blown away by the power this film carries and by the fact that my friend thought it sucked.  This was one of the best films I have ever seen.  Brilliantly pasted together by Soderberg (who won the oscar fair and square) and wonderfully casted Traffic tells a story that dares to be told.  Told on vignettes we see multiple facits of the drug wars raging in the US of A as well as Mexico.  First we have Ohio Supreme Court judge Robert Wakefield (Douglas) who has just been appointed the nations new Drug Czar.  His postition is very important but jeapordizes his relationship with his wife and teeage daughter Caroline (Christensen in a breathtaking role) who has took up with Seth (Grace) and is now forming quite the heroin addiction.  Next we have  Helena Ayala (Zeta-Jones) who is married to drug kingpin Carlos who has just been inprisioned.  Helena has been unaware of her husbands extracaricular activities until now and Helena has to deal with DEA agents Montel Gordon (Cheadle in yet another commanding performance) and Ray Castro as they try and get to the bottom of her husbands cartel as well as her husbands family friend and business associate (Quaid) trying to put the moves on her himself.  Thirdly we have Javier Rodriguez (Del Toro), a cop south of the border as he battles an ethical war between his own morals and the way of the land as the USA and Mexico battle over the drug trade crossing the border.  This film is perfect in almost everyway and is one that should be mandaroty.  It helps lay out a story that has much meaning in the world we live in today.  Theres a scene where Helena is walking down the street and she passes Javier and in that moment it all makes sense.  As different as these situations are, they are all the same, they are all interconected somehow...and that makes it all the more pertinant for the viewer.",1140998400,,2252,4.414043583535109

Also, about the actual movie, the transfer is great. It looks great. It sounds great. Yes, like most Criterion movies, the sticker tag is above $25, but don't let that stop you.

1287301,4,B00003CXN4,"Get ready for a much more serious film on drug addiction (if your goin for the not-so-serious movie check out Spun or Trainspotting). The message delivered in this film is quite powerful...to say so the least. The War on Drugs is such a controversial topic- and this movie explored many sides of it. In one scenario it ruins a family; only to bring them all together in the end. In another scenario another family is destroyed- and in the end their family is muddled with lies and even more destruction. And in similar two other scenarios one friend looses another due to the nastiness of the drug business- where you are subject to everything, especially murder.

Why four stars instead of five? Too many plots thrown together- for one thing. You have to see this movie a good 2-3 times to fully understand and get what is going on with everyone and their own separate scenarios. Another thing I find confusing is the overall general message this film is trying to say...what is it? Or is there no general message- just that the war on drugs is quite complex and quite intricate... therefore there are both good and bad aspects? If so, I already knew that.

I do believe everyone should see this movie however, it gives interesting thought to a very complex issue- that I am sure everyone has an opinion on.",1136160000,,1308,4.609442060085837
1287351,2,B00003CXN4,"What happened in this movie is that they are people who travel drugs from Mexico to U.S.A. The government of the United States have hired people that sale drugs so they can have the information to know where they can find the main person that is saleing drugs and stop this situation.
The setting is in  Cinncinati,Ohio in the Suburb of Indian Hill,Washington,D.C in the office of the Chief of Staff, Columbus,Ohio in the Satate Supreme Court where the government were discussing about drugs.  San Diego,CA  is the place where the police catch one of the drugs saler. La Jolla, California that is just outside of San Diego. El Paso Intelligence Center El Paso,Texas.
In addition the tone of the movie is negative because it all relates with drugs ad that makes the people feel like fustrade and make them upset. This also show how some people try to acquire power from others. For example when in the movie the police put mens that are polices and make them to act like  they are those drug salers. This is one way how these goverment or anyone can acquire power by tell them a lie or pretend something that is not true but they due it.
At the end the message of the movie was that it don't matter if you are rich or poor but there is always a time when anyone can lade down. Also it depends on you or on people that wants to help you they can get out of a situation like this one. However  this movie was a little it confusing at the end but it really has big messages to the audience.",1136160000,,1486,4.330935251798561
1287352,5,B00003CXN4,"Director:  Steven Soderbergh

Cast:  Michael Douglas, Benicio Del Toro, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Don Cheadle, Luis Guzman, Thomas Milian, Topher Grace, Erika Christensen, James Brolin.

Running Time:  147 minutes

Rated R for pervasive drug content, strong language, violence and some sexuality.

Like an abstract expressionist master, Steven Soderbergh stands in the center of a canvas that stretches from Cincinnati to Tijuana. He mixes materials and splashes colors with the dash and power of a Jackson Pollock. His materials are skillful acting, lively editing, a dynamic music score, and an unflinching camera. (He did his own lensing, under a pseudonym). The artist's aim? To paint a picture of our country's drug problem.  Scripted by Stephen Gaghan, ""Traffic"" has its roots in a 1989 British television mini-series, ""Traffik,"" which followed the drug trade from Pakistan to Britain. There are three loosely related stories, each with its own color coding--and as with Pollock, there is nothing random about where the paint splashes upon the canvas.

Blue hues bathe blue bloods in Cincinnati where an Ohio Supreme Court Justice (Michael Douglas) is flattered into taking a job as national drug czar, just as his bright young daughter (Erika Christensen) is seduced into addiction by her prep-school friends.  A rich golden-yellow surrounds San Diego where a comely couple (Catherine Zeta-Jones and Steven Bauer) occupy the upper links of the drug chain and spend ill-gotten cash on clothes, cars and country clubs. They are pursued by two undercover cops (Don Cheadle and Luis Guzman) who spend most of their screen time cooped up in a surveillance van.  In Mexico, a washed-out, burnished brown bespatters a desert of desperation as two Baja policemen (Benicio Del Toro and Jacob Vargas) pull off a major drug bust only to be themselves busted, by a sinister general (Tomas Milian) who notifies them that 'I will take over from here.' Each color signifies its own impenetrable culture, and when Douglas crosses into Mexico to meet his counterpart, we know (but he doesn't) that his fellow drug czar is really a drug lord.

The performances were exceptional, especially considering that no one was given star treatment. Much of the film was shot with existing light and Soderbergh kept the composition wide, letting the actors create their own space. Douglas was surprisingly believable as the would-be czar and bookends an Oscar-worthy year with his scruffy professor in the earlier ""Wonder Boys."" His real-life wife, Zeta-Jones (carrying their child), gave a quite credible performance as a society snob who turns ruthless when her status is threatened.  Other stand-outs include Christensen's drugged-out daughter, Del Toro's street smart Mexican cop and Cheadle's dedicated drug buster. In fact, there was not a weak performance in the bunch, including crucial cameos by veterans Peter Riegert and Albert Finney. Real people even play roles: Douglas's fictional drug czar confers with real-life senator Orrin Hatch, while actual customs officials relate their day-to-day drug enforcement dilemmas.  Each of the three stories ends with a glimmer of hope. But despite small battles being won, the film's verdict is that the larger war is plainly being lost.

Like Pollock, Soderbergh continues to stretch the boundaries of his art, as he did a dozen years ago with ""sex, lies, and videotape,"" and more recently with the undervalued ""The Limey.""  The film is virtually filmed entirely with hand-held camera, giving each and every scene an up-close-and-personal feel. There's also a distinct lack of background music, which lets the viewer feel like they're eavesdropping on real-life scenes, and not just watching a film, making for a very personal, intense experience similar in some of his other films (""Out of Sight"", ""Erin Brockovich"").  Certain scenes in ""Traffic"" are filtered a specific color, to heighten a mood or a sense of awareness of what's about to happen. The scenes in Mexico featuring the Mexican detective Javier, for example, are all filmed in a very bright, almost disorienting yellow. It's a technique that can be irritating at times, but for the most part, it serves a bold purpose that truly adds to the film.  ""Traffic"" is certainly a film that will not be embraced by all, but is a stunning addition to the industry and is highly considered as one of the most spellbinding, yet honest painting of the evils of the drug world.  Film making at its best.",1135900800,3,4482,5.217270194986073
1287353,1,B00003CXN4,would love to review this movie. When delivered the movie dvd was missing. the box was not tampered with in any way. Sure would be nice when you spend $40.00 on a crtiterion collection dvd that the dvd is in the case.  zero stars,1135814400,,229,4.204545454545454
1287354,5,B00003CXN4,"O.K., I may have missed some things here, but I think it's sad that this film, which actually had a message, has a lower average review rating than ""Miss Congeniality"".  I mean, come on!  Yeah, they're not in the same genre but I would much rather watch this film that ""Miss Congeniality"".  That film was formulaic and clichd.

Also, just as a disclaimer, I only saw the edited TV version so I am missing some scenes and dialogue, especially the obscene ones.  But until then I had only heard of this film and didn't really go out of my way to watch it.  After watching just the TV-edited version though I now want to see the whole thing.

Let's get one thing straight here: this isn't some after-school special with an anti-drug message.  Actually, I didn't even get an anti-drug message at all.  All I got was the showing of the effects of drugs and the drug war, JUST like the song ""Master Of Puppets"" by Metallica.  Now, yes, those things were bad but aren't they also true?

Anyway, I thought the film was entertaining and a good eye-opener to how the DEA is always criminalizing these drug dealers while at the same time regular people whom they might know are the ones supporting these drug dealers by being their consumers.  The acting is good, the characters and script are good (I especially like Don Cheadle, who's a very underrated actor) and the whole thing VERY gritty and maybe even a little disturbing.  The one thing I didn't like was the cinematography, or more specifically, the lightning.  I hate that ""always dark"" effect.  Can't they use some normal lighting?  I know the different colors were used to designate the different plotlines but I still didn't like them.  The ending was good too, although my two questions are why was Don Cheadle's character so confident that they were going to get the drug lord this second time around with the bug plant, and how could a person like Catherine Zeta Jones' character (I don't know the names as I only saw it once on TV) could support her husband after what he put her and her child through.  Yeah, she wanted to get him out of jail and everything but how could she totally convert to a supporter of his career?  Well, maybe that's just the way they wanted the story to be but I didn't really get what changed her like that.

Some people here are saying this movie is biased, racist and I think even unrealistic.  How?  This movie wasn't trying to explore the ""averge"" when it comes to drugs so much as it was trying to show the key elements of the drug world.  One guy complained that there was a black drug dealer ""corrupting"" the rich white girl.  O.K., why is this a race thing?  There are black drug dealers and Cincinnati (which is the city I thought it took place in) has black people, including black drug dealers.  The girl was white because that's what her parents were and they were trying to portray the good, blonde, straight A's girl becoming a junkie.  So what?  The whole remark about catching the ""white guys"" was because the white guys are the ones IN THE COUNTRY that run the show.  All the drug cartels are in Mexico and other Latin countries and they obviously can't go and arrest people from other countries, so, duh, they go after the ""white guys"", which they did.  The whole Mexico thing was shown that way because it was showing the top level of the corruption amongst the officials and the trickle effects to the police officer.  Yes, not every situation is like this but it was just making the point that these situations exist and this is what they're like.  This movie wasn't about a few people buying a little pot, some detectives busting a small-time dealer and an average girl with parents that have average jobs, developing a slight drug addiction.  God, look at it for what it is.

Anyway, this movie's good.  I mean, come on, at least give it a 4-star review!  Maybe it has some flaws but name one movie that didn't.  Even if you do I'm sure there'll be a hundred people to argue otherwise.  Just watch this movie and stop trying to make it like some cornball anti-drug program.  This does not deserve a 3 1/2-star average rating.",1135036800,,4132,4.517520215633423

Anyway, there is no neighborhood in Cincinnati that looks ANYWHERE near as bad as they show in the movie.

1287356,5,B00003CXN4,"This fascinating, all-star look at the world of illegal drugs loosely weaves several stories together, showing drug dealers, buyers, and those who work to stop the drugs.  Michael Douglas plays the new American drug czar who discovers, too late, that his own daughter is an addict.  Oscar winner Benicio Del Toro is a Mexican double agent who is caught up in the cruel drug trade in Tijuana.  Catherine Zeta-Jones plays a society matron who finds out her husband's fortune comes from selling drugs.  And Don Cheadle is an undercover DEA agent who is trying to stop the flow of drugs from Mexico to the US. All of the actors are wonderful.

I didn't expect to like this movie, but I did.  The script emphasizes character development and I really got caught up in the stories. Each vignette is compelling and memorable, and the script wisely leaves each story unresolved. ""Traffic"" won four Academy Awards, including Best Director for Steven Soderbergh.

The war on drugs is ill thought out and will never work.  This film is art that makes that point.

I'd say this movie should be watched and digressed by politios and pundits and really mulled over.  How many innocent lives need to be destroyed before we realize that peoples behavior cannot be changed by legislation?

I don't know all the answers, but this movie provides some food for thought.

Legalize it?  Maybe it's not a pancea, but, I, with my libertarian bent, seem to think it'd be a better way to deal with the problem, and I think this film, if really thought about, supports my view, at least from the aspect of the fact that the film could be totally nonfiction.

Anyway, I recommend the movie if you haven't seen it yet, and if it's been awhile, it might be worth it again if you wondering about how we might change our drug laws to better society.",1124064000,,988,4.414364640883978

1287360,4,B00003CXN4,"This is an intense and gritty though brief cross-section of the ""war on drugs"".  (Although after watching, you may be tempted to call it the so-called ""war on drugs"".)  Michael Douglas is Wakefield, a judge who thinks that pushing treatment options balances out his heavily pro-prosecution leanings in narcotics cases. Wakefield's beautiful and intelligent daughter (Erika Christensen) herself is slowly falling under the spell of drugs and, by the film's end, proves capable of doing anything for a hit. Pegged to become the next Federal Drug Czar, Wakefield's strategy depends on bringing his brand of justice to Mexico where the lines between the law and the criminals frequently blurs if not disappears altogether. (If you're car is stolen, Mexican police will tell you who has to be paid before they can ""find"" your car.) The plan's master flaw in law enforcement strategies is that the drug war in Mexico is more complicated than simply cops v. dealers.  On the illicit side of the war, the conflict is not seen as one between the law and law breakers, but between different cartels - each jockeying to enlist corrupt police and military leaders in their favor.  (Mexican law enforcement, a character observes, is an entrepreneurial pursuit.)  A seemingly fearless and moral Tijuana cop, Javier Rodriguez (Del Toro), discovers this when reluctantly co-opted into the larger drug war by the mythic General Salazar. Salazar's methods require a fair amount of psyche-warfare against friend and foe alike (suspected traitors dig their own graves while prisoners with information are swamped with kindness so they'll turn). When Rodriguez suspects Salazar's crackdown to be cover for one supposedly crushed cartel to regroup, he breaches security and runs for the Americans. Linking American narcotics officers and the Mexicans is a south-California businessman Carlos Ayala, (Steve Bauer) whose various corporations amount to a shell game used to conceal a vast drug empire. When one of Ayala's underlings Ruiz, (Miguel Ferrer - the one whose script lines are meant to convey the futility of the drug war) is arrested on the eve of a massive coke bust, Ayala gets arrested as well, and it falls onto his now besieged wife (a very pregnant Catherine Zeta Jones) to save the family.  Soon, she learns that this will require her to restore its links to the drug trade, by all means necessary.

Though freely taking shots at the drug-war, ""Traffic"" doesn't so much push a point as tell a story, leaving us to base our own conclusions (the only difference is that we'll now have to think twice about them). Soderbergh directs his characters well - the performances are actually understated for a film this topical. Each of the story arcs has its own special cinematography highlighting the seeming distance from the drug war's front lines and the after-effects of a hit: the Wakefield story is generally shot in cool blue colors with static shots and high-grain film, implying a clear frame of mind. Zeta-Jone's scenes are filmed in a sunny yellow, using smooth shots but quick cuts - hinting at how the orderliness of her life is on the verge of collapse. Best of all are Mexican scenes, shot in very grainy film using harsh yellow filters - never letting us forget the harsh pressures and ceaseless anxiety that hounds those at the source of the drug economy. Soderbergh further flavors the mix with a low-grade electronic score which seems both from an episode of ""In Search Of..."" yet perfectly balanced for this film. Even the captions seem to date the film to the 1970s (using typed captions instead of computer characters, as if the film were completed a week after ""The Andromed Strain"").  This was a powerful film for so many reasons, not the least of which is the way it mirrors its subject - it draws you in and blows your mind.",1118793600,,3836,4.954898911353033
1287431,5,B00003CXN4,"The insidious nature of drugs and the efforts -sometimes useless to stop their use- are revealingly exposed through the anxious lens of director Steven Soderbergh in his work, Traffic.

In a mosaic of intertwined histories, Soderbergh again speaks about a controversial subject of deep common interest, one that affects all the social layers and triggers ominous conflicts and tragedies.

Two Mexican policemen, Javier Rodriguez and Manolo Sanchez, working in the border with the United States to stop drug traffic, will be caught in a corruption network. In the United States, Judge Robert Wakefield is named the new Czar Antidrug of the country, and while he looks for allies at the Mexican government to fight the war against drugs in both countries, he and his wife sinks in a personal battle against the increasing addiction of their adolescent daughter. At the same time, in San Diego, DEA special agents Montel Gordon and Ray Castro work in a case to eliminate one of the most powerful Mexicans cartel, and when they catch Carlos Ayala, key contact, his wife Helena will be dragged to the squalid world of her husband in order to save both hers and her son's life. Histories of the innocents, the guilty, the manipulators and the victims connect all in Traffic, an excellent cinematographic piece that stands out for being a vehicle for entertainment that sends out an important message.

An absolute triumph of direction, screenwriting and performances, Steven Soderbergh's film is a powerful ""docudrama"" that challenges our intelligence, impresses us and it affects us. The cast is sublime and everyone without exception offers a memorable interpretation. Each actor inhabits their space without nothing or nobody robbing their momentum.

Stephen Gaghan's script slowly involve us in histories of common people, until we entered in the different worlds where their lives take place, from the vast and hard Mexican desert, passing by the most luxurious offices of Washington, to the suburbs where the drugs abound, waiting for their next victim.

Soderbergh, a director capable of wonders, again improves himself giving the film a different look, using colors to represent diverse atmospheres and histories and using the camera-in-hand technique to intensify the realism of the scenes.

Generally, the world of drugs is displayed in movies to reflect the self-destruction of the people who use them. In Traffic, is not about an affected person, the whole society is the victim, addicted in one way or other to this terrible affliction. Many people are in the incessant search of answers to end this situation. Answers that, -judging by Soderbergh and Gaghan's expositions of -, have never had effective solutions. The movie is not about criticisms, nor does try to propose ideas, is simply trying to show a reality where nobody will get away clean.",1114732800,,2856,5.184381778741866
1287432,4,B00003CXN4,"I must commend Steven Soderbergh for making Traffic as it depicts the drug war in all of its truly gray dimensions.  No where is this more true than when drug Czar, Michael Douglas, calls for some original ""out of the box"" ideas on his government plane and none of his staff can offer up a thing.  It really was a very ambitious project and I believe that the director pulled it off admirably. The movie is quite stylish and it was a pleasure to watch.

Everything involving Mexico was absolutely fascinating.  I thought the shots of Mexico City and Tijuana were highly authentic.  Frankly, I think that Benicio Del Toro is far and away the best part of the movie.  His character outshines everyone else although Don Cheadle had an inspired performance. The intrigue between the cartels was the best part.

Sadly, there was considerable racism in the film which is to be expected from Hollywood nowadays.  The Hispanic and black cops are shown saying they want to catch the big guys, ""the white guys,"" even though both of the big shots in the movie are ""Hispanic guys.""  No matter, they'll blame the white man.  Then, through the speech of a drug addicted spoiled private school kid, we find out that whites are to blame for blacks selling drugs.  One wonders who is to blame for whites selling drugs then.  It is the familiar, and mindless, politically correct view that whites are the cause of all evil, whereas, non-whites are always innocent victims.  By proffering this the filmmaker, just as the case is with every trendy PC acolyte, reveals his own racism, as he condescends to minorities instead of treating them as real people.  The racist element lowered my overall rating but the movie was still worthwhile.",1112400000,2,1718,4.7407407407407405

Ah yes. Today's journey takes us to the heart of America's Midwest to the manicured suburbs of Cincinnati. Urban sprawl. Rolling Hills. White, private school kids free basing in daddy's living room. This is the American Dream.

Traffic confronts dealing, selling, using and the ""war on drugs"" through three intermingled plot lines in this documentary-style film that take viewers from D.C. to Cincinnati to California to Mexico.

More well known actors grade the screen during this movie than is reallynecessary, but somehow director Steven Soderbergh manages to pull it off. People like Salma Hayek have bit roles and few lines. Other big names, likeBenjamin Bratt, don't make into the story line until the last fourthof the movie. But the main stars of the movie are Michael Douglas, Don Cheadle, Benicio del Toro, Dennis Quaid, Catherine Zeta-Jones (looking *gasp* very pregnant for her role as a pregnant wife of a drug trafficker), TopherGrace (Eric Forman from That 70s Show with a good haircut finally) and ErikaChristensen (Leave it Beaver, the movie?).

The greatest part of this movie is its focus on Cincinnati Country Day high school in Cincinnati. For those of you have seen the move, you might be thinking, ""What focus? They only mentioned the name of the school once."" Well, let me fill you in.

Douglas' character and his family live in Indian Hills in Cincinnati (although the house they use is actually from Hyde Park). Indian Hills is where some schmo who raised like a bajillion dollars for President Double-yuh lives, as well as Marge Schott. Anyway, Douglas' daughter goes to Cincinnati Country Day, which is a REAL school. SO, when little, rich, white kids are doing drugs in the film, it's not reflecting well on Cincinnati Country Day with its $14,000 a year tuition.

This appeals greatly to my still-experiencing-horrors-as-a-result-of-all-girls-catholic-high-school-hell self.

So this movie is great. It really is and everyone should see it. And after you do, e-mail me. I have a question I want to ask you what you thought of this one scene I found very troublesome.

From another side, you want to protect your family (Catherine Zeta-Jones) but you can't help but know that all your wealth and lifestyles for you and your family are coming from something illegal; something that you know your husband (Steven Bauer) is doing but you refuse to believe it.

With his street smarts, he tops all the others.  That is including Catherine Zeta-Jones, who plays the maniacal mother trying to protect her son after discovering her husband has been leading a double life as a drug lord.  In addition, there is Michael Douglas, who does a very good role as the soon to be Head of Drug Operations and father of a drug afflicted daughter.

1287480,5,B00003CXN4,"This is a raw and powerful movie on the drug trade and its corresponding law enforcement response. It is a series of riveting, interlocking vignettes that tell the story on all fronts of the war on drugs. It paints a picture that will stay with the viewer for some time, so powerful is the imagery employed and so compelling are the actors in their performances.

Michael Douglas plays the part of Robert Wakefield, a newly appointed drug czar, who tries to mount an all points attack on the drug trade. Naive and well meaning, he is, unbeknownst to him, being manipulated by the powers that be in Mexico, who are fighting a turf war over the profitable drug trade. He is so clueless that when the drug war actually lands on his door step, as when his teenage daughter, wonderfully portrayed by Erika Christiansen, succumbs to peer pressure and becomes addicted to drugs, he is initially in heavy denial. He ignores all the standard warning signs, until it is nearly too late.

Benicio Del Toro, in the star making role of Javier, an intelligent, decent, and honest Mexican law enforcement officer, who has his own war on drugs going on, is riveting with his quietly powerful performance. He, too, is being manipulated by the powers that be in Mexico. Nearly too late he realizes that the Mexican general, who is ostensibly battling the war on drugs and to whom Javier had given his full support and cooperation, is engaged in some drug action on the side from which he hopes to profit. The only drug war that the general is really involved in is the one that one drug cartel has with its rival.

Meanwhile, back in the states, a wealthy and respected San Diego businessman, played by hunky Steven Bauer, is arrested, as it seems that his businesses are really just a front for the drug trade. His assets frozen, this leaves his beautiful and greedy wife, played by the lovely and talented Catherine Zeta-Jones, picking up the pieces of her husband's empire while he is in jail, awaiting trial. As regent to the kingdom, she cold bloodedly negotiates with the drug cartel to restore her and her husband financially. No shrinking violet is she!

There are several other subplots that are also of note and move the story along. All of these vignettes interlock with one another in some fashion, serving to bring the story full circle. To find out how they do so, watch this well directed and powerful film. It is certainly well worth watching and a welcome addition to one's personal film collection.",1093824000,,2498,4.69634703196347

1287483,3,B00003CXN4,"Traffic opens with a banner on the screen announcing the filmic location to be Mexico, ""twenty miles southeast of Tijuana."" The film is grainy and has a decidedly yellow (although some have romanticized this color, calling it sepia) tone, and the audience is introduced to two State Police officers, Javier Rodriguez (Benicio Del Toro) and Manolo Sanchez (Jacob Vargas), who are speaking Spanish. The dialogue begins with Javier explaining a nightmare to Manolo. Later, Javier and Manolo capture some drug transporters, the audience is introduced to the corrupt General Salazar (Tomas Milian), and the scene shifts to Columbus Ohio, where the graining is removed and the film is saturated with rich blue tones. Two minutes later, San Diego in all its beauty, arrives on screen.
The audience is immediately alerted to the difference between the United States and Mexico. Not only through language, but also through Soderbergh's use of the tobacco filter.  But this should not be surprising; establishing differences between the two countries is necessary for Soderbergh to maintain the hierarchical position of the United States over Mexico.  And, this hierarchization is, I argue, why Soderbergh is able to critique America, vis--vis U.S. drug policy, while still garnering critical and popular praise: implicating Mexico as the agent of America's woes and advancing stereotypical representations of both Mexico and Hispanics, effectively deposits Mexico and its inhabitants into the ancillary position of the U.S./Mexico binary.
Richard Porton's article in Cinaste discusses the process Soderbergh goes through to create the yellowing of the Mexico scenes in the film. More importantly, in articulates the implications of Soderbergh's yellowing all of Mexico: ""[Soderbergh] shot the Mexican sections 'through a tobacco filter' and then overexposed the film to imbue these vignettes with an oversaturated look. Mexico, therefore, becomes a miragelike, evanescent realm where life is cheap and morality is infinitely expendable. As film scholar and Latin American specialist Catherine Benamou observes, the movie 'posits an historical and moral hierarchy between the postmodern United States--which has to retrieve its moral foundations and family values--and premodern Mexico, which has presumably never been able to draw the line between the law and lawlessness'"" (42) Significant about the hierarchy advanced by Benamou is that Mexico is implicated on both sides.
First, the film certainly portrays Mexico as a place of lawlessness. This is seen in the opening sequence with the drug transporters: not only are they breaking the law by transporting illegal substances, but General Salazar's intervention highlights (if not immediately, then certainly later in the film) the lawlessness of the federal authorities. Lawlessness is witnessed again twenty-one minutes into the film when two American tourists are pleading for Javier's help in finding their stolen car; here, the corruption of the state authorities is illuminated by Javier's having to give the couple the phone number of a man whom they will pay, who, in turn, will pay the police to make their car appear. And, of course, the hit man Frankie Flowers (Clifton Collins, Jr.) being Hispanic and living in Mexico continues to fortify the notion of Mexico as lawless.  Moreover, Soderbergh's representations of Mexicans as savages vis--vis the torturing of Frankie Flowers by General Salazar's men also accounts for Benamou's description of Mexico as premodern. The only thing that seems strange is General Salazar yelling to his men that ""we are not savages,"" as if the exclamations of a corrupt official enmeshed in drug trafficking could somehow erase the scenes of stereotypic barbarism that Soderbergh captures through his tobacco filter.
Second, by yellowing all the Mexico sequences in the film, Mexico is implicated as the agent which has, as Benamou states, led the ""postmodern United States"" astray from its ""moral foundations and family values,"" which it must now retrieve. Wood explains that by ""beginning with the yellow camera filters, Soderbergh insinuates that nearly all Mexicans are somehow involved in the drug trade"" (761). But the yellowing of Mexico implicates both the people and the land; Wood further states that ""from the highest echelons of power to the street dealers and sidemen, Soderbergh's portrayal of life across the border establishes Mexico (and by extension, all of Latin America) as the fountain of evil that is the drug trade"" (760).
Since, as Porton claims, Soderbergh's film is ""primarily obsessed with how drugs have befouled the American family nest"" (42), the argument is thus: (1) Benamou states that the U.S. is in a hierarchical position to Mexico but must still retrieve its moral foundations and family values; (2) these foundations and values are being destroyed by drugs (as seen via the Wakefield family); (3) yellowing the Mexico sequences implicates (nearly) all of Mexico and its inhabitants in the drug trade; (4) therefore, the disintegration of family values and morals in America is a result of lawless Mexico.
In this light, Mexico is doubly culpable: one, Mexico's own lawlessness has averted its progression into a postmodern stage of development; two, Mexico's premodernity and lawlessness has thwarted the United States and threatens to derail their progression to the next stage of cultural development, which allows Soderbergh to make his critique of the United States. Traffic can adduce the United States as a country lacking in morals and family values, but only by simultaneous producing a scapegoat that Americans can point to as the entity responsible for their woes. Wood observes that, by portraying Javier as a ""noble soldier while nearly all his compatriots fall prey to kidnapping, assassination, torture, and betrayal, Traffic offers a skewed portrait of Mexican society in getting its anti-drug message across to U.S. audiences"" (760).",1084060800,2,5975,5.450323974082074

1287486,4,B00003CXN4,"There is no doubt in my mind that Steven Sodeburgh's ""Traffic"" is one of the best movies ever made on underworld.
The director is on top of his form as he seamlessly weaves 4 different stories bound together by the deadly thread of narcotics. There is the naive but well intentioned Justice Depaartment officla (Michel Douglas) in USA fighting drugs on 2 levels. One as the official in cahrge of War on Drugs and other is fighting to save his daughter who has fallen in the trap of the deadly habit of drugs. On the other side of the battle is a wealthy couple where the husband is arrested on cahrge of drug traffic and his pregnent housewife whose quest for her husband's freedom descends her in to the dark world of drugs and hitmen. On the other side of the border in Mexico where the narcotic dealers rule there is the voice of consceince a mexican cop(Benecio Del Toro in his stunning Oscar winning turn) honest enought not to be involved in the traffic yet street smart enough not to take the drug dealers head on.
The pace is slow and the director makes a conscious effort to take a matured view on the drug war without sounding too righteous,also none of the stories end when the movies finshes thus leaves the intellegent viewer enought material to think over.
The all star cast includes Michel Douglas,Katherine Zeta Jones and the Oscar winner Benecio Del toro all give memorable perfomramce. Even the fringe cast of Dennis Quaid,Don Chedale pass the bill satisfactorily.

I was a little skeptical at first, but once it starts it pulls you in. From begining to end, this film lacks nothing. The film interweaves three stories three stories with one basic link --- drugs. There's two undercover cops (Luis Guzman and Don Cheadle) who bust a dope peddler (Miguel Ferrer) who rats out his supplier (Steven Bauer) --- whose pampered housewife (Catherine Zeta-Jones) learns of her husbands dirty business. Then there is a newly-appointed Drug Czar (Michael Douglas) who is fighting the drug trafficking very well, but is failing with his increasingly drug-addicted daughter (Erika Christensen). On the Mexican drug-side, we have a cop (Academy Award Winner Benecio Del Torro) trying to clean up the streets, but on the other hand trying to help a crooked General (Tomas Milian) that he doesn't know he's helping. This film is really the definitive drug-film. Unlike most, which either deals with addiction (Requiem For A Dream) or the trafficking side (Scarface), this film succeeds in both area's. Academy Award winning director Steven Soderberg knocks this one out of the ball-park. Like most GREAT directors, you can tell when a director is going to be great --- great acting comes from good directing. The cinematography is outstanding. The Mexico scenes have a rich, but gritty feel to them. The Washington scenes are very dim, very dull. The San Deigo scenes are rich in color and have almost a blinding feel to it. All masterfully done. Benecio Del Torro really stole the show, successfully grabbing his first Oscar. I'm sure it won't be the last.

Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari from 1988 to 1994 was sent in exile to the United States after he lost the election to Ernesto Zedillo in 1995; wherefrom, the FBI discovered an enormous recycling of drug traffic money that belonged to the ex-President.  It was subsequently discovered that the one running this trade was the President's brother Raul. All this and more is lurking behind the film ""Traffic"", a mind-boggling intrigue of drugs, dirty money and politics.  It is a very difficult cinematic job to combine these elements along with the social degradation, which results, especially in terms of the teen-ager population that is affected, without resorting to moralist and dogmatic messages. The results of ""Traffic"" are undeniably high and the film shows Soderbergh's talent in treating political subject matter. However, the reason I did not give this film the full five stars is because I prefer the British original film that sets the events in Pakistan. This film eerily discussed the issues surrounding the drug trade along the Pakistan - Afghanistan border and the difficulty that authorities of all stripes - the Taliban had actually been the most successful even if their methods were very crude - at reducing the cultivation of poppies. That being said, this film along with the book ""Reefer Madness""' by Eric Schlosser will help you undertand the gravity of the drug problem as well as the infectiveness and injustice of the methods employed by governments to restrict the tarde and use of narcotics.",1074902400,,1559,5.133858267716535

1287551,4,B00003CXN4,"""The war on drugs has many enemies. Sometimes the enemy is your own family. And I don't know how you wage war against your family."" - Dialogue from ""Traffic""
Which is why the war on drugs, like the war on violence or the war on obesity or any other social war, will be difficult, if not impossible, to win. More than statistics and money, the war on drugs asks for an assault on desires of human consumption, which cannot be combated with any policy or criminal punishment.
The most powerful element of Steven Soderbergh's ""Traffic,"" quite possibly the best American movie in 2000, is how it lays bare the nuances of human nature that simply have no reasonable explanation. What leads good to bad? ""Traffic"" has no hard answers, but it does show a wide canvas of  protagonists either connected to drugs in some way (whether it be enforcement, sales, or use) or lost in the pursuit of some material or chemical high. If it isn't drugs, it's money or a lifestyle one can't give up. Faced with hardship all her life, the beautiful, pregnant wife (Catherine Zeta-Jones) of a drug lord refuses to return to it, using her young son's golf putter as a sign of what she has to lose. When her husband is arrested, and faced with forfeiting his entire fortune, the wife is again faced with poverty. Just watch what she does to prevent it.
In another story, an Ohio judge (Michael Douglas) accepts a job as the nation's drug czar, and is immediately faced with his own domestic crisis; his honor student daughter, Caroline (Erika Christensen) has fallen into drug addiction with free base cocaine. While the most interesting, best-acted segment involves a corrupt Mexican cop (Benicio Del Toro) trying to walk the fine line between death and profit, all while battling his conscience, the key, absorbing scenes occur with the father and daughter in Ohio. The screenplay, written by Stephen Gagham, is adapted from a British series by the same name, draws Caroline as a character who falls hard for drugs, in the way that few people, I suspect, do.
She cries, literally, tears of joy, at the thought of getting high. She subjects herself to whatever demand it makes of her, sexually or financially. She represents the ecstasy end of the spectrum, and rarely has it been captured so well, the abject happiness of crack. The lingering images of the film mostly involve her character, and her boyfriend Seth (Topher Grace), who is just well-versed enough to justify the use of drugs as an escape from convention.

This is a statement you've heard, no doubt, in any after-school special. Really, there is nothing original in ""Traffic."" It's been onscreen before, especially in the 1980s, when anti-drug films were the standard fare. What struck me in watching the movie is how familiar all this material is (the key drug witness wanting immunity, the corrupt cops, the daddy's little girl gone astray) and yet how the craftsmanship of Soderbergh's direction and camerawork tie it together into a moving, ambitious work.
Del Toro, as the cop, uses a quiet smolder to show his growing frustration with the Mexican status quo regarding drug cartels. Douglas, in a rather subdued performance, is troubled from nearly the opening frame; first, as he discovers how little can be done to fight drugs, and then, with his daughter, just why that is. A wide supporting cast, including Don Cheadle, Lusi Guzman and a nearly unrecognizable Benjamin Bratt, flesh out their small parts well.
""Traffic's"" uncommon strength lies in its conflict of conventional morality vs. the baby boomer experience. There is a scene where Douglas asks his wife (Amy Irving) how long she's known about her daughter's drug use. The wife has kept her daughter's secret for six months, for no better reason than in college, she used drugs, came out all right, and look, now she's a millionaire. And so what harm could a little experimentation do? And how could she offer herself up as a hypocrite to her own daughter?
Another question is asked: What separates our fates? The user from the addict? The alive cop at the baseball game vs. the dead one in the desert, when they were both trying to do the same thing? ""Traffic"" plays these questions out; we aren't surprised by the ambiguity of the results, and yet the journey of this film is as absorbing and dramatic as any in recent years.",1069891200,,4343,4.798397863818424
1287552,5,B00003CXN4,"I think it was the director (Soderberg) who said that he wanted to make a movie that did not reflect his views on the drug issue, but one which presented the facts as they were so that viewers could come up with their own conclusions. In this he succeeded. Traffic is a fairly unbiased look at the drug problem in the Mexico and the U.S. The Mexican half of the film is in Spanish with English subtitles, which in my opinion gives the film a more realistic feel. The documentary type sequences in the film (with real politicians and other officials) also add to the feeling of authenticity.
There are a number of subplots in the film which makes the film slightly difficult to follow if you aren't paying careful attention. Fortunately, all these subplots are somehow related, a masterful stroke as the subplots add to the complexity of the film reflecting the complexity of the problem in the real world.
I appreciated Soderberg not going down the route that many other American movie makers have gone. I'm referring to those directors who love the idea that the Americans are the heroes and the rest of the world is the bad-guys (A variation on the cowboys and Indians theme that many other directors have found difficult to grow out of). In traffic we have the `bad-guys' on both sides of the border. In fact one of the `bad-guys' turns out to be the daughter (Erika Christensen) of the man heading the war on drugs (Michael Douglas).
If you are a Michael Douglas fan, you won't be disappointed. If you are a Catherine Zeta Jones fan, you won't be disappointed. In fact if you are a fan of great movies, with great storylines and totally believable people you won't be disappointed with this film.

1287556,5,B00003CXN4,"A lot of movies that are about drugs describe the substance and shows it's effects on the characters who use them. Here, Steven Soderbergh directs a movie that shows the battles, losses, and meager victories between the authorities, the two sided faces, and the people who sell and supply. A great plus about the film is that even though there are three stories to be told, and they do have some significance to each other. Soderbergh makes sure that you don't get overloaded or confused. Each part has enough to give, and every piece that follows comes one at a time. There are no sides taken to any situation, even though there are characters who obviously make seedy and corrupt decisions. You are watching it from a filmmaker who wants to bring you how it is: ugly, slimy, brutal, and quite exausting.
Michael Douglas is more than fine as America's new drug czar. He later finds out that his own daughter, played by Erika Christensen, has succome to drugs herself. This makes an irony and brings a much larger pressure onto their household.
Beninco Del Toro, in an excellent Oscar winning performance, is Mexican police officer Javier Rodriguez Rodriguez, who along with his friend and police partner Manolo Sanchez (Jacob Vargas), find their clever ways of police work favoured by a General Salazar, who offers them work, money, and protection for helping him with his so called claim to bring down a major drug cartel.
Meanwhile, San Diego housewife Catherine Zeta Jones is shocked to find her husband arrested, without knowing why, until their lawyer (Dennis Quaid) relenquishes the reasons, which will surprise her indefinitly.
Everyone has a lot on their plate. And although we are sympathizing for Douglas' father and Amy Irving's mother as they try not to let their teen daughter slip further into susbstance abuse, there is an interesting take on the possibilities of what wrongs we are all capable of. Del Toro's character wants to do right, yet his police paycheque is such poverty, and the competing drug runners they apprehend for their druglord boss are large and powerful people. Javier and Manolo are good at what they do, so this new opportunity gives  them something they didn't have as Tijuana cops: excitement and more money. Now they are hotshots. However, an underlying guilt of it all haunts Javier like a ghost.
Everyone here has more than a job to do. With such a field of excellent actors, from Miguel Ferrer as a cocky drug runner, Topher Grace as the unfixable punk Seth, or Benjmain Bratt in a terrific cameo as the head of the Obregon Brothers drug empire, they all make the film more interesting to watch, yet what I also liked is how nobody crowds the film and their time in front of the camera, considering the large number of actors and actresses there are.
I really have to say that Don Cheadle and Luiz Guzman as the duo of DEA agents who survey Zeta Jones's every move, are my favourite to watch. They aren't these crisp super hero agents you see in other films. They're simply a pair of the agency's best, remaining very relatable as real people, but very driven when their job takes them to the front of the action. And since they're friends, they also make some good funny moments, joking about this, or bickering about that, without turning the movie far away from any of the movie's purpose.
The violence and substance abuse isn't way over the top, but when the drugs and guns do show up, it isn't pretty either. The story is really well written, and doesn't throw you around. It could have, considering the material's volume. I can't think of a better movie that has a lot to say and a lot to show without confusing you.
A sombering low key soundtrack adds to the film's gritty and surreal mood. And the acting is terrific. There hasn't been a better ensemble of actors than in this film, and with the terrific storyline and directing, I hope they leave this movie alone from any sequal ideas or such. It said what needs to be said, and we'll know how things will go on after the film ends.",1066694400,,4036,4.6845070422535215
1287607,5,B00003CXN4,"I don't really know why people insist that the film is about drug trade! I think the film is about humans and their hopes and defects: A very powerful man with no weapon to protect his daughter, a nouveau-rich hot shot who is suddenly in jail, a spoon fed beauty running for money and a superb policeman hoping to provide something for the childhood.
The way the film has been ""woven"" is pretty rare in the new films (it looks like the well-made movies we use to see in the 60's and 70s), and the hazy impression of a fine movie by its humanity (and not graphic) may remind us that Hollywood is still in good shape.
A salute to Michael Douglas for taking one step back offering the axial role for Benicio Del Toro: I don't think that anyone else could represent the 3rd world pure and simple man looking for fairness as he did.
The characters and the stories of the movie could make at least 3 successful movies; this is in case you would not consider the amazing shooting on Mexico, who could be considered as a masterpiece on its own and a fourth successful movie.

1287610,5,B00003CXN4,"OK, I'm sorry, that's a seriously cliched word, but how else am I supposed to describe a movie where I didn't even NOTICE the passage of time until almost the two-hour mark?
There's a lot of elements at work here, but let me talk about the top three that make it so great:
1) The cast. Give me Don Cheadle, Miguel Ferrer, and Benicio del Toro in the same movie and I want to see it. Throw in Dennis Quaid, Michael Douglas, and Luis Guzman and I am SO there (OK so I missed this in theatres and just discovered it on DVD). I'm not familiar with Erika Christensen's work, but she is spot-on as the druggie daughter-- even if I would have preferred that her daddy throw her spoiled brat ass in jail a la Martin Sheen/Charlie Sheen (and DON'T get on my case about addiction-is-a-disease, because the way the film portrayed her was that she just didn't give a damn; I didn't see any suffering there). And Topher Grace??? ""That 70's Show"" TOPHER GRACE????? DAMN, that kid has a future-- Soderburgh showed exceptional insight in casting him, as it would have been soooo much easier (and predictable) to show the guy who gets the drug czar's daughter hooked on drugs as some low-life scumbag, instead of Mr. clean-cut boy-next-door. Nice.
Catherine Zeta-Jones; I haven't seen most of her films, but she is a dynamic presence here-- probably the strongest pregnant female character since Frances McDormand in FARGO, and as loathsome and self-serving as McDormand was admirable.
Benicio del Toro's Oscar was well-deserved-- imagine giving an award to an actor for just playing a human being! No heavy make-up, no tics, no dramatic speeches-- just plain HONESTY. Astonishing.
I could go on, but suffice to say there isn't a weak performance in the entire cast. My only beef? I would have loved to see Javier and Wakefield meet-- they could learn so much from one another.
2) The script. A great cast without a great script is a ""box movie."" You know, the ones that run ads showing the cast in little boxes at the bottom, a la the 70s disaster movies? (credit Roger Ebert). TRAFFIC is most definitely NOT a ""box movie."" I didn't see a manifesto on the evils of drug use, or the failure of the war on drugs, or any kind of MESSAGE writ large-- I saw intelligent characters who interact with one another and make choices and mistakes and keep the viewer involved with them AS PEOPLE, not as pawns in a morality play. Another well-deserved Oscar to writer Stephen Gaghan; without this script, it WOULD have been a box movie-- albeit one with funny colors. Which brings me to the third element:
3) The look. For this I credit not only Soderburgh, but the editors, cinematographers, art directors...all of those who contributed to the unique look of this film. From the shaky camera to the washed-out yellows in the Mexico sequences to the cold blues of the Douglas/Christensen sequences, the LOOK of the film enhances everything that is done and said without seeming pretentious or obvious.
I don't know if I've been able to convey how well all of the elements combine to make such an eminently watchable film. Take whatever stance you want on the U.S. drug policy-- this film is more concerned with telling its stories. You can't get more watchable than that.",1057795200,,3244,4.673076923076923

Her transformation from the innocent and most pregnant spouse to ""godmother"" is stunning.  She may have won this year for ""Chicago"" but she deserved one for Soderberg's triumph.

And while there are three stories (one of which is told from two perspectives) in this film, all three flow together masterfully to make for one large, honest, gritty, and sometimes disturbing film. This is probably the most honest movie about the drug problem in america that I have ever seen, and having family and friends that have had to deal with these exact demons, I appreciated this movie's honesty all the more. What really hammers the movie home however, is the resoulution of the plot and the ending (and final scene in the film to be exact). Simply one of the most powerful films I have seen in forever.
Don't watch this movie if you're expecting a simply entertaining film. This is a movie that will make you think, that will question your sense of right and wrong.

The one thing that I really enjoyed was the depiction of Law Enforcement, both the Mexican authorities and the Americans.  Benicio Del Toro was wonderful (duh, he won an Oscar) as a mostly-good Mexican cop.  His scene in the pool with the 2 G-men is borderline hilarious.  Don Cheadle and Miguel Ferrer also gave great performances, as the most direct arguments for and against the drug war.
The plight of the Douglas character's family was a wonderfully interesting story as well, from permissiveness and hypocrisy of adults, to the slow spiral into addiction and acceptance by youth.  Really a good story.
The one thing I thought was far-fetched was the final press conference involving Michael Douglas's character--in the history of government, how many people have ever done that?--but that's my only complaint.  Catherine Zeta-Jones's character is involved in a Cheech & Chong ""Up in Smoke"" moment as well, but that's certainly forgiveable.

1287655,3,B00003CXN4,"Criterion's edition of ""Traffic"" is virtually the same print master as the previously issued (and MUCH CHEAPER) edition from USA films.  While fine film grain is excessive and colors are presented almost completely desaturated (which is as the director intended) there is virtually nothing to distinguish this print of the movie from the previous one - except the price.
""Traffic"" is an ugly little drama about kids wacked-out on narcotics and the drug smuggling apparatus that allows them to illegally enter the USA. Michael Douglas and Katherine Zeta-Jones are in it, though not together - he's the father of a crack-addicted teen, she, the unsuspecting wife of a kingpin drug lord. Benicio Del Toro cuts a swath as a Hispanic police officer who wants to do right by his job, but winds up looking the other way when the powers that be kill his partner.  I'm not giving away more than I should.  There's plenty of sick, perverted and disgusting issues to twist your stomach herein.  As pure cinema the movie plays like a hybrid Mike Wallace expose' on ""60 Minutes"" meets ""The Blair Witch Project"".  Camera work is frantic and jumpy.  The cuts happen in rapid succession.  The plot unfolds haphazardly until midway through when the audience starts to do their own piece work. Overall, I enjoyed the idea behind this movie, but I can't really get past its excessively manic style.
True to form, Criterion give us some real ""toss-away"" extra features. Like extra audio commentaries (as if one isn't enough) and some deleted scenes that really don't enhance your viewing or understanding of the film.  My personal favorite of the extra features, one that Criterion loves to include(virtually every one of their discs has one) is the critical essay.  But honestly - does anyone ""read"" type-written articles on their big screen television?  I would much prefer a book or pamphlet with this same info that I could read at my leisure  without worrying that the on-screen font was burning itself  into my picture tube.
BOTTOM LINE: Buy DVD's with pristine image quality.  That said, why buy Criterion if someone else is minting the identical disc for a cheaper price? You're just throwing away money on extras that don't really matter!",1049587200,2,2227,4.938337801608579

The Zeta's character develops from a blissfully ignorant stay at home mom to a take charge drug kingpin pro tem, in a fascinating way. Third and most important, the social issue.
The drug czars daughter develops a drug problem; her preppie boyfriend tells the drug czar ""It is easier for a teenager to buy drugs than alcohol or cigarettes"" Here, in this one phrase is the whole drug war conundrum, thesis, antithesis and synthesis, if you want dialectic materialism. The degradation of the African-American neighborhoods by the drug seeking adoloescents, the effect on the neighboring countries. How can any public officer remain honest, in the face of the amounts of money that the drug trade brings, and in addition, the alternative; silver or lead is the question, the answer is obvious.

A tough and accurate view of the drug business between the great lords, who have benefits with the misery of drugs.
A great performance from Michael Douglas and Amy Irving as his wife. My personal fave is Catherine Zeta-Jones who is much more than a beautiful woman here, she's a strong-willed woman who tries to take his husband (who is guilty) out of the prison.
We are treated with different points of view, by loving Douglas' ideals yet we root a little for the efforts of Zeta-Jones, knowing his husband is a real drug lord.

I love the way Mexico was shot. And the acting includes one of the best ensemble casts in recent years. Don Cheadle, and Benicio Del Toro are at the top of their game, as is Catherine Zata-Jones. Look for Benjamin Bratt in a cameo role.",1031529600,,679,4.354330708661418
1287733,3,B00003CXN4,"My review of ""Traffic"" is based on what I saw at a movie threatre, not on VHS or DVD.  First there was a 6-hour miniseries; ""Traffik"" set in Europe and Asia, which has been shown on PBS many times.  This is an outstanding look at the drug trade as seen through the eyes of the users, the dealers, the police, the parents, and the politians. It was so realistic, it almost appeared to be a documentary.  Then a few years later, the 2-hour film ""Traffic"" set in the U.S. and Mexico, was released.  It is a condensed remake of the earlier miniseries, and although it is good, it does not compare to the earlier film.  Some scenes in the movie just don't work as well as they did in the miniseries, because, in the shorter film, they just don't make sense.  The food delivery to the hotel room in the movie looks like a way to speed up the end of the film, while in ""Traffik"", the same scene looks right in place.  In the movie, at the last minute, we find out there's feud between the drug dealer and his lawyer.  It the in miniseries, the rivalary is shown in much greater detail, throughout the film.  I liked ""Traffic"", the movie; but ""Traffik"", the miniseries, is much better, and is a definite must-see for everyone.",1031356800,2,1218,4.353982300884955
1287734,5,B00003CXN4,"In 2000, Steven Soderbergh, already on a roll with 1998's 'Out of Sight' and 1999's 'The Limey,' made an astounding one-two punch in a year of otherwise lackluster Hollywood filmmaking with 'Erin Brockovich' and 'Traffic.' Indeed, the latter won him the Oscar for Best Director and the film itself was widely recognized as one of (if not the) best film of the year. Indeed, Soderbergh famously went out on several limbs making it -- not only was the multi-threaded Drug War storyline a major hot potato in Hollywood (USA Films literally came in at the last minute with the money needed for principle photography after virtually every other studio passed), Soderbergh served as his own cinematographer, utilizing complex and experimental techniques while shooting on mutiple locations, including the San Diego/Tijuana international border (and this particular reviewer's home town of Columbus, Ohio).
And as any DVD fanatic can tell you, the story BEHIND the movie is often just as interesting as the movie itself. Yet the film's intial DVD release was, shall we say, a bit of a bad trip.
Fortunately Criterion, on its own roll with its series of bells-and-whistles DVDs of the cinema's best (and, at times, most obscure), has given the film its justly deserved double-disc royal treatment.
What's new? For starters, Soderbergh and screenwriter Steven Gaghan are finally on hand with a fascinating and surprisingly frank commentary track. At one point, they even admit that practically every criticism leveled at the film -- Catherine Zeta-Jones' character shift from pampered softie to hardened drug dealer is too abrupt; its take on the drug war is too one-sided; some of the plot twists are too forced; in adapting the British television mini-series 'Traffik' for the big screen, Gaghan truncates too much of the original storylines and gives the subject matter the short shrift -- were all things they also worried about during the course of making the film but felt were unavoidable. (Indeed, Zeta-Jones should especially thrill to this new DVD: all the scenes with her that were cut for the theatrical release, including an extended sequence involving her detainment by U.S. Customs, are included in the extensive deleted scenes content.)
Meanwhile, budding ""DPs"" will enjoy a tutorial of sorts on how Soderbergh achieved the grainy, bleached-out look of the Mexico sequences, while political junkies will drool over a multi-angled look at the outtakes from the Michael Douglas party scene.
All-in-all, your appreciation for the movie's sprawling-yet-intimate interweaving storylines; the measured, ensemble-friendly performances; Soderbergh's knack for suffusing every scene he films with a crackling intelligence; and his hermetic respect for his characters and his audience will only increase with this DVD.",1030320000,2,2815,5.3710407239819

I was a little skeptical at first, but once it starts it pulls you in. From begining to end, this film lacks nothing. Whether you like it for the acting, (Don Cheadle, Benicio Del Torro, or Michael Douglas all do superb, along with most others), whether you like it for the cinematography, (I'm not sure who did it, but watch for the color difference between Washington, DC (Michael Douglas' scenes), Mexico (Benicio Del Torro's scenes), or San Diego (where a bunch of rich kids live), you will be amazed. Another thing is the rock solid story line with snappy dialouge. And not to mention the allstar cast of Benicio Del Torro, (The ""Good"" Cop), Michael Douglas (Head of the DEA), Catherine Zeta-Jones (A Rich, Pampered, Housewife), Dennis Quaid (The Crooked Lawyer), Don Cheadle (Undercover Cop), along with numerous cameos from Selma Hayek, ect. This film can not be beat. With A+ acting, story, and without a doubt the BEST cinematography ever! You cant afford to miss TRAFFIC. This film is a 2 1/2 hr long drama, which needs to be viewed in FULL. I know of quite a few people who quit watching it half-way through.

1287736,2,B00003CXN4,"This movie is interesting in the way that it portrays the cross section of real life as opposed to what the government has been putting forth.  While it is a timely subject given our ongoing efforts in the area I'm afraid the whole feel of it and the acting just did not work for me.
Douglas does his usual good work and there are good performances by others but perhaps it's more just the way it was directed.  It did not strike me as having a feel of authenticity, it was too obviously contrived.  It strikes me as not being one of those movies that makes you want to get inside it and believe, it does not create the sort of empathy feeling one might have for a Tom Hanks in Saving Private Ryan (admittedly a tough comparison of course).
Possibly worth a rental but with all the tens of thousands of titles out there I have to say I would not rate it terribly high.  No serious political commentary, no memorable or outstanding theatrical element.",1027728000,,950,4.380681818181818
1287737,3,B00003CXN4,"Ok first of all I thought this was an interesting movie that touches on aspects of the U.S. war on drugs that most probably don't think about.  It deals with the effects it can have on families, friends, parents, cops, etc etc but frankly 911 has rendered certain elements of this outdated.  The connection of international terror to drug trafficking particularly heroin makes it very import that we continue to fight it.  Where I'm critical of this movie is that I think it gives a somewhat skewed vision of reality and it's important that folks remember this is Hollywood and Michael Douglas is not portraying a real life drug czar.
The movie ends on a note that fighting drugs is not worth the trouble despite all the damage that has been depicted throughout the movie.  I'm not sure what exactly the people who made this are suggesting, that we decriminalize hard drugs like cocaine and heroin?  They seem to suggest that white people who sell drugs should go to jail but don't and that people who buy and use drugs shouldn't be dealt with in the legal system because they are a hapless lot.  While this may in fact be a valid point in some respects the movie really does fail to deal with the societal situation in a bigger sense.  Basically it's a movie, if you want to know more about the drug problem in America I suggest you read a book or two because they miss a lot here and the view is a bit simplistic.
The movie is also notable for the lack of ""dark complexions"" in the cast.  The only major African American in the movie is a good guy and cop granted but other than that blacks get portrayed as being only marginal players in the drug trade and as shiftless gun toting violent thugs for the most part.  In the movie the major bad guys are either white drug dealers or Hispanics and maybe this is true somewhere but to my eyes it seems a bit strange.  I'm sure that drugs are tearing up white peoples lives too but this movie does nothing to address the social issues surrounding drug addiction in the black community.  It is of course good to note the movie addresses the fact that lots of white people frequent poorer black neighborhoods because they know the drugs can be had there and thereby perpetuate and exacerbate the issue.
Benicio Del Toro on the other had gives a very good performance and the ""Mexican"" segments in general are the highlights of the movie in my opinion.  Bencicio plays a Mexican cop who is drawn into the corruption the drug trade has created south of the border.  He plays a willing participant but also a man with a conscience that is not totally at ease with what he's seeing.  Is he a good guy or a bad guy(I'm not saying)?
What they are saying overall is that U.S. drug policy is largely ineffectual, corruption is rampant in the police and army in Mexico, and meanwhile addiction is tearing up peoples lives.  It does not suggest any firm alternatives except perhaps where they touch on AA and drug treatment options and that is of course a better option than prison in many cases.
It's a serious movie on a political subject that raises important issues but doesn't really address them with any kind of solid alternative vision.",1027728000,,3179,4.513937282229965

It's (most) likely he'll make another brilliant film. Like 'Ocean's 12' or 'Higher Traffic'. It would be so brilliant. I would be much pleased if he made another brilliant, superb film. I hope to see more from brilliant directors like him. And about the DVD...it is great. It has great picture quality, and great sound. It's pretty funny with the German (Or Russian, not sure) trailer. I just laughed so much. But the movie was so intellectual. So...compassionate. Lots of Drama and intensity. Michael Douglas was superb as the Drug Czar. And Erika Christensen is great as Caroline. She is very dedicated to her role and very good at it. Many people are good in their roles as people against drugs and trying to get rid of it, or showing that they like drugs and that they get in trouble for it. So if you want to see this, go see it.

1287740,5,B00003CXN4,"Steven Soderbergh tackles the drug trade of the United States through multiple storylines drawn from various points in the narcotics pipeline.  The US drug czar (Michael Douglas) tries to cope with a daughter (Erika Christensen) who is addicted to crack cocaine.  A Mexican cop (Benicio Del Toro) gets caught up in the machinations of a powerful general who wants to control the Mexican drug trade (Tomas Milian).  Two hardworking DEA agents (Don Cheadle and Luis Guzman) try to convict a drug kingpin (Steven Bauer), whose wife (Catherine Zeta Jones) transforms from innocent to hardhearted economic realist while her husband sits in jail.  Soderbergh and screenwriter Stephen Gaghan are adept at weaving the various story lines together in a comprehensible and compelling fashion.
For me, this film was very powerful because it dramatized a view of the War on Drugs that I happen to agree with.  The war as it is being fought is a failure.  The illegality of drugs like cocaine and marijuana serve as de facto price supports and do very little to limit their availability.  Some reviewers commend this film on its authenticity and declare it to be like a documentary.  I hope they bear in mind that it is not a documentary and that, however much they may trust Soderburgh's intent, they should learn about this issue from non-fictional sources.  Then they will be in a better position to judge the film's veracity.",1025740800,2,1416,4.966101694915254
1287741,5,B00003CXN4,"By the time he made Traffic, Steven Soderbergh was at the zenith of his popularity having just come off the crowd pleaser, yet socially conscious Erin Brockovich, with an even more powerful critique on a problem that plagues the United States - the war on drugs. He depicts it on a macro and micro level with a masterful command of craft. Soderbergh does it in a way that isn't preachy, making a movie that simultaneously entertains and has something to say.

Each story illustrates the futility of trying to win this so-called war on drugs. The Mexico story shows how an honest lawman like Javier walks a dangerous line where he tries to make a difference while avoiding angering his corrupt superiors who would kill him if he doesn't do what he's told. The D.C. story shows how deeply drugs have infiltrated our society when an affluent politician's daughter becomes a drug addict, going to the poor slums to get high. How can he win the war on drugs when he can't even keep his own daughter away from it? The San Diego storyline shows how those at the top of the drug food chain are untouchable because they have the money to maintain a respectable faade and can afford the best lawyers money can buy to make any charges brought against them go away.

While it's true that Traffic doesn't really say anything new about the war on drugs, it does reinforce how prevalent drugs are in our society and show how clueless our government is in their attempts to stop it. The problem is that the infrastructure that is in place is dysfunctional so that even when honest men like Javier or Wakefield come along with the best of intentions, they become ensnarled in bureaucratic red tape. Traffic seems to suggest that the best that these men can do is make a difference in their own small pocket of the world, whether it is Javier brokering a deal so that his town gets baseball field and the ability to play games at night, or Wakefield finally making a personal connection with his daughter in a meaningful way. The drug problem will never go away no matter how much money and manpower our government throws at it.

On the first disc are three audio commentaries, the first being with director Steven Soderbergh and the film's screenwriter Stephen Gaghan. Soderbergh, with his trademark dry, sardonic wit, touches upon how he achieved the various looks of the movie. Not surprisingly, Soderbergh dominates the track with some amusing anecdotes about filming in this commentary jam-packed with smart observations.

The second commentary track features producers Edward Zwick, Marshall Horskovitz and Laura Bickford and consultants Tim Golden and Craig Chretien. Golden talks about how the film's opening drug bust in Mexico was based on an actual event told to him by a Mexican police officer. Bickford and the other producers tend to speak about the film's production history. Chretien was a high-ranking federal agent for the DEA and talks about the authenticity of the bungled San Diego bust scene. This is a very informative track with the consultants providing the most fascinating material.

The last commentary track is by the film's composer Cliff Martinez who talks about his score in between the isolated tracks of music.

The second disc starts off with 25 deleted scenes with optional commentary by Soderbergh and Gaghan. The two men do an excellent job putting this footage in the context of the movie and explain why it was cut. Dennis Quaid and Catherine Zeta-Jones' characters suffered the most in the editing but a lot of this stuff was cut for reasons of time.

""Film Processing Demonstration"" takes us through, step-by-step, how the filmmakers achieved the distinctive look of the Mexico sequences. Not surprisingly, digital technology was used to help achieve this look.

""Editing Demonstration"" has the film's editor Stephen Mirrione take us through four scenes and show how they were put together with editing. This is fascinating insight into the process.

""Dialogue Editing Demonstration"" features the film's sound editor Larry Blake giving us a crash course in this craft. For example, in one scene a radio could be heard in the background and so Blake had to edit it out and yet keep the dialogue that was recorded at the time - not as easy as one might think.

""Additional Footage"" includes four scenes in their unedited form. You can watch these scenes from multiple angles. Most interesting of them all is the cocktail party scene in which Michael Douglas interacted with actual politicians, keeping in character while they were allowed to adlib.

Also included are two trailers and five T.V. spots.

Finally, there is a collection of rare, drug-detecting dogs trading cards. A cute, if somewhat frivolous extra.",1025049600,,4736,4.90625
1287762,5,B00003CXN4,"This is a raw and powerful movie on the drug trade and its corresponding law enforcement response. It is a series of riveting, interlocking vignettes that tell the story on all fronts of the war on drugs. It paints a picture that will stay with the viewer for some time, so powerful is the imagery employed and so compelling are the actors in their performances.
Michael Douglas plays the part of Robert Wakefield, a newly appointed drug czar, who tries to mount an all points attack on the drug trade. Naive and well meaning, he is, unbeknownst to him, being manipulated by the powers that be in Mexico, who are fighting a turf war over the profitable drug trade. He is so clueless that when the drug war actually lands on his door step, as when his teenage daughter, wonderfully portayed by Erika Christiansen, succumbs to peer pressure and becomes addicted to drugs, he is initially in heavy denial and ignores all the standard warning circles, until it is nearly too late
Benicio Del Toro, in the star making role of Javier, an intelligent, decent, and honest Mexican law enforcement officer, who has his own war on drugs going on, is riveting with his quietly powerful performance . He, too, is being manipulated by the powers that be in Mexico. Nearly too late he realizes that the Mexican gweneral, who is ostensibly battling the war on drugs and to whom Javier had given his full support and cooperation, is engaged in some drug action on the side from which he hopes to profit. The only drug war that the general is really involved in is the one that one drug cartel has with its rival.
Meanwhile, back in the states, a wealthy and respected San Diego business man, played by hunky Steven Bauer, is arrested, as it seems that his businesses are really just a front for the drug trade. His assets frozen, this leaves his beautiful and greedy wife, played by the lovely and talented Catherine Zeta-Jones, picking up the pieces of her husband's empire while he is in jail, awaiting trial. As regent to the kingdom, she cold boodedly negotiates with the drug cartel to restore her and her husband financially. No shrinking violet is she!
There are several other subplots that are also of note and move the story along. All of these vignettes interlock with one another in some fashion, serving to bring the story full circle. To find out how they do so, watch this well directed and powerful film. It is certainly well worth watching and a welcome addition to one's personal film collection.",1024876800,6,2496,4.675
1287763,4,B00003CXN4,"A very strongly crafted story about the drug trade and the war to stop it.

coloring to film all and it works surprisingly well.  The story jumps back
and forth between Mexico, California, and Ohio and involves a cop trying to
take down drug traffickers in Mexico, a woman finding out her husband had
been a major supplier in California, and the new Drug Czar finding out his
daughter is a major pot-head.
Acting from all ranges from good to excellent.  My only question is the Best
Supporting Actor Oscar going to Benicio Del Toro.  While I didn't think he
did a bad job (like Kim Basinger in L.A. Confidential) I didn't see him do
anything superb.

Director Steven Soderburgh uses a wonderful cast, many different camera types, and many intriguing subplots that all somehow link to make this film great. If you enjoy fine acting, great directors, views from many locations, and just great films in general, buy TRAFFIC today.
TRAFFIC bases around the installation of a new drug czar, superbly played by Michael Douglas. How can he fight a war on drugs when his daughter is a user? This is the question the character seems plagued by throughout the film. This makes for interesting discussion. Meanwhile, two Mexican police officers are swept into helping ward off cartels in Tijuana. Benecio Del Toro is excellent in the role. There are other plots which call for wonderful performances from the likes of Don Cheadle, Catherine Zeta-Jones, and Albert Finney. All in all, this film is well scripted and acted.
TRAFFIC, like any film, has flaws. It is tedious at certain points, sometimes the language is too excessive, and it seems to offer a negative message to youth. However, for its few flaws, it is still a wonderfully crafted and shot film. It was lauded because of that fact. If you need a great film to watch, I urge you to buy TRAFFIC today!",1024012800,,1298,4.799107142857143
1287766,5,B00003CXN4,"One of a pair of highly-effective ""Drugs `R' Bad"" movies from 2000, Traffic bears little resemblance to its more visceral partner, Requiem for a Dream.  Where Requiem appealed to emotions and raw gross-out power as junkies descend into inevitability, Traffic, based on the Channel 4 miniseries Traffik, takes a more politicized, intellectual approach to the drug problem and the so-called ""War on Drugs.""  Director Soderbergh weaves three separate stories into a coherent whole: Michael Douglass' newly-appointed ""drug czar"" judge and his coke-addicted teenaged daughter; Catherine Zeta-Jones' innocent-wife-turned-drug-kingpin, and Oscar-winner Benicio Del Toro's Mexican police officer forced to contend with corruption in government and law enforcement on both sides of the border as everyone scrambles for a piece of the drug trade.  Traffic manages to communicate its point without self-consciousness, telling the story as a story and allowing the actors to portray subtle, three-dimensional characters instead of the usual anti-drug stereotypes.
Criterion managed to get their hands on the rights to Traffic for an addition to their growing collection, finally giving fans of the movie the edition they deserve.  The anamorphic widescreen transfer looks much the same as the old release, and there is still no DTS track, although the DD 5.1 makes full use of all five channels.  What Criterion added are extras.  Three commentaries, one from composer Cliff Martinez, are the appetizers.  The commentaries range from ""remember that day of filming"" to ""this actually happened to X,"" and offer a healthy balance of information and insight.  For the main course, Criterion offers no less than 25 deleted scenes, some of them short, some longer.  Round that out with a couple of featurettes, and there is enough here to keep people satisfied for a long time.  Casual buyers might balk at the price, but fans should have no problem justifying this purchase.

It is made up of four story lines, presented like movie serials, which Steven Soderbergh does a great job in weaving together by the end of the film.  As a result, the viewer sees how a police officer in Tijuana is linked to a young, female drug-user in suburban America.
This film questions the war by pointing out that it is never-ending and is pervasive.

1287832,5,B00003CXN4,"Like I stated in the title of my view, it makes you think.  Drug trafficking is a heavy subject matter to deal with in a movie format.  The filmmaker successfully blended 3 separate story lines together using different color lightings and various degrees of handheld camera moves to present it as a docu-drama.
This is a very intelligent movie dealing with the drug problem we all face in our society.  Drug problem is not far removed from our seemingly 'sheltered' suburban environment and middle class surroundings from the ghettos where it 'should'  belong to.  I wish all those who care about this problem's social, economical, moral, emotional, and health impacts would watch this movie and think about any possible improvement in dealing with this situation.
After the movie, my hats off to all the drug control rank-and-files that do their job daily even though it seems fruitless and wasteful.  Like Mr. Topher Grace's character said in the movie: as long as there's demand, there's a supply.  There seems to be no stopping from dealers at different levels of distribution to supply the buyers out there.
Mr. Del Torro showed a commanding performance as a Mexican cop.  He reminds me of Mr. Chou Yun-Fat in John Woo's cop movies in his Hong Kong days.  All the characters are uniformily strong and even.  There's no weakest link in this ensemble.  I don't want to name all of them because it's simply too many.  But you will know what I mean after finishing this movie.

1287833,5,B00003CXN4,"This film is brilliantly edited, and hugely deserves the Oscar it won in this category.  For the first twenty minutes of the film, it's not at all clear who are the good guys and who are the bad guys.  You have to see this movie twice, in quick succession, to work out how Soderbergh achieved this deliberate ambiguity.  The quality of the deleted scenes on the DVD is extraordinarily high.  These missing scenes make you appreciate how much Soderbergh had to cut out in order to stay within 150 minutes, and yet there's fantastic depth to the plot and the characterisation within their condensed form.
And finally a word about Cliff Martinez's wonderfully economical soundtrack.  It's a bit like Eno -- in fact there's even an excerpt from APOLLO at the end -- and a bit like Harold Budd.  (I wish I'd never lost my SEX, LIES AND VIDEOTAPE soundtrack CD, which he and Soderbergh created.)",1018051200,,889,4.666666666666667

The fact that ""viewer"" is looking to fast forward shows he/she misses some of the point of the film. The film is supposed to be slow and meticulous because only then can Soderbergh show just how painful and prolonging the process of drug use can be. The script is very inovative to juggle three plots around simultaneously AND keep them interconnected. And yes the characters are haunting, especially Catherine Zeta-Jones. It is absolutely bone chilling to see a pregnant woman demand the killing of another person to save her husband from Jail. THIS IS FILM MAKING AT ITS BEST.",1017705600,,665,4.833333333333333
1287835,5,B00003CXN4,"Drugs in America are a huge problem. Through various ministries I have worked with over the years I have learned that approximately 80% of homelessness and 75% of crime is a result in some way because of drugs. In the 1980s the U.S. federal government began a war on drugs. Yet, twenty years and billions of dollars later the problem has increased. It's a part of the universal battle of good versus evil and the battle can be wearisome and frustrates even the best.
It is this wearisome frustration that Steven Soderbergh brilliantly portrays in the movie TRAFFIC. Simply stated, TRAFFIC is about the war on drugs in America. The story the movie tells is related through three separate yet intricately intertwined tales. The film jumps from one scene to the next, back and forth, but without loosing one's attention.
The first storyline deals with a Mexican cop, Javier Rodriquez (Benicio Del Toro). Rodriquez is a good cop working amidst the sleeze and corruption of good people gone bad. Rodriquez fights against the powerful bureaucraticized drug cartels because he dreams of when children can play baseball safely again.
The second storyline revolves around Robert Wakefield (Michael Douglas), the newly appointed U.S. drug czar and his daughter Caroline (Erika Christensen). Unbeknownst to Wakefield, Caroline has become a hard addict, so much so that she eventually prostitutes herself for drugs. His daughters tribulation changes Wakefield's perception about abuses.
The final tale is a narration between a jailed drug lord (Steven Bauer), the takeover of the ""family"" business by his wife (Catherine Zeta-Jones), and the two DEA Agents (Luis Guzman & Don Cheadle) working to convict the dealer and protect the key witness against him. It's a frightening look at ruthless famial loyalty and the anguish of our country's law enforcement.
The acting in TRAFFIC is superb, the directing prime, and the cinematography brilliant. Much has been made oer the movie's bleak tone. Nevertheless, though the film is dark it ends in light. The movie leaves one feeling frustrated, but hopeful. As long as the fight goes on, there is always hope.",1016150400,,2141,5.137535816618911
1287836,5,B00003CXN4,"Every era has movies that define it, set it apart and act as a sort of historical notation of the moods and points of view of the people of its time. Traffic, director Steven Soderburg's sprawling and ambitious look at the effects of America's war on drugs, is one of those movies. Years from now, I suspect people will view it and admire its power. They will also ask themselves what we/they were thinking back then. Can the 'war' really be so misguided, so fatally flawed? Does it solve anything, or does it simply escalate the misery and violence? Does it inadvertantly act as a price support system for the drug cartels? The movie almost never preaches. It simply records (in near documentary fashion) three distinct yet somewhat interwoven stories. It doesn't tell you what to think. It merely suggests that you do think about the possibility that a new approach to drug abuse be taken. Those who do not wish to dwell on the subject can take Traffic on its other level, which is that of a first-rate thriller.
One story revolves around Javier [Benicio del Toro], a Mexican cop in Tijuana. Javier is by nature an honest man who wants to do good, but he is well aware of the corruption all around him. When he and his partner make a substantial drug bust on their own, their mission is intercepted by a group of soldiers working for the Mexican equivalent of the United States drug czar. From this incident, Javier becomes tangled in a lethal web of lies and corruption. Meanwhile, across the border in San Diego, Helena Ayala [Catherine Zeta-Jones], who is at the top of the local social circle, watches in horror as the DEA busts her husband and charges him with being one of America's biggest drug kingpins. Slowly, Helena realizes that the businessman husband she has loved and trusted all these years really is a master criminal. When a rival gang threatens the life of her young son, Helena decides to take some radical action. In the third story, Robert Wakefield [Michael Douglas], a Federal judge in Ohio, has just been appointed head of a US task force on drugs. He heads to Washington hoping to make a difference. He quickly realizes that the drug war has turned into a political circus. Elected officials no longer believe it can be won but are determined to put on a show for the folks back home. After Robert discovers that his own daughter is an addict, his view of the world is quickly turned upside down.
Besides the actors mentioned above, there are many others in the cast. All of them are great. Don Cheadle and Luis Guizman play DEA agents who relish being assigned to the Ayala case, not because they still believe they are making a difference, but because they get to go after a white man for a change. In a star-making performance, Erika Christenson is remarkable as Caroline Wakefield, the addicted daughter. Of all the characters, hers may be the most telling. Drugs pervade every segment of our culture. Caroline and her friends don't fit the user stereotypes. They are smart, educated and privileged. They are the very children of the group probably most in favor of the war on drugs. As Michael Douglas's character says, ""How can we make war on our own families?""
Some viewers may be put off by the movie's documentary style, but I liked it. Director Soderburgh was himself the cameraman. This is most unusual in a big budget project, but it is typical of this ever inventive director. In post-production, the film negative was color-washed. The result is that the Mexican scenes have a yellow tone, the Ohio and Washington segments have a bluish hue, and the California parts are in bright or 'normal' colors. Not only did I find this interesting to look at, it made the movie, which jumps around a lot, very easy to follow.
Traffic isn't perfect. One scene in particular doesn't make good sense, but I can't tell you which one without spoiling the plot. Any film with a great number of characters is apt to confuse some people. Still, despite a few flaws, it is easily one of the top five American movies of 2000 .",1016150400,,4048,4.647140864714086
1287837,1,B00003CXN4,"One of the few movies I ever walked out on (I eventually sat through it on the insistence of trusted friends), this film is somewhat polarizing.  I found it to be trite, vapid, predictable, and nausiating with its jerky let's-cash-in-on-the-indy-craze handheld camerawork.
If you loved this movie, I am happy for you that the greatest people producing DVDs is making it for you.  But PLEASE rent it first or you may be one of the 10-20% of viewers who felt like they had just seen the wrong movie.
(If it helps, my judgement is that THE LIMEY is the only good film Soderberg has made, and I would give it about 3-1/2 stars).",1016150400,13,624,4.513274336283186

Soderbergh shows a surprisingly uneven hand with his storylines. Del Toro is good, but he's been (and will be, no doubt) much better. Michael Douglas is, surprise surprise, Michael Douglas. And Zeta-Jones is not as deft an actress as she is stunning. Sorry, but it's true. My main problem with the film, however, has to do with the overall approach. It reminds me of Natural Born Killers, in which Oliver Stone tried to make a point about how popular culture makes us numb to violence by making a movie equally numbing. Interesting point, but not an enjoyable film experience. Similarly, Traffic seems to address the ""the drug problem is really complex and seemingly unresolvable"" idea by making a movie as muddy and tangled as its topic.",1014336000,6,861,4.671052631578948
1287870,2,B00003CXN4,"""Traffic"" has been heralded as a ""daring"" look at the War on Drugs.  But it's only daring from the perspective of someone who thought the War on Drugs has been a resounding success.  Frankly, to those who have been willing to make themselves familiar with the failures of the multi-trillion dollar campaign, the film covers nothing new and really could have been far more provocative.  Not that it's a bad thing that the limited scope of the film shook up people who think inside a narrow box a bit.  As a film on it's own, it deserves some praise as an entertaining, well-acted (especially from Del Toro) crime film.  But make no mistake, this film has much broader aspirations, and that is where it fails.  It is fair to compare it to the British mini-series that it's based on, ""Traffik"", which was produced 11 years earlier yet is far more insightful and relevant.  That film has a broader scope-- it deals with the a third world opium farmer rather than a third world cop, for example--, the dialogue is sharper -- compare the Hollywood gushiness of Douglas's final speech to the powerful efficiency of the original's counterpart speech-- and it makes far more daring observations-- the original notes how America allies itself with Pakistani heroin traders so they can fight the Soviet Union, where as the remake has dialogue and plot points which completely exonerates the American government of such activity, which is, sadly, totally false.  If you want to see a really want a daring film about the War on Drugs, skip ""Traffic"" and see ""Traffik"".  Then, if you want to really have the tragedy and hypocrisy of War on Drugs laid out for you, read ""Dark Alliance"" by Gary Webb.",1013990400,11,1684,4.739726027397261

What you end up with is a patchy movie.  I wanted to really enjoy it but it kept throwing me curve balls from left field that just made parts of this movie ridiculous.  Suburban mom living in La Jolla turns into a hard bargaining Don Corleone with cutting edge smuggling technology in a blink of an eye.  Trained drug policemen flippantly let a fake delivery man poison a suspect they know people are after.  A federal gov't official hangs in the ghetto to find his daughter with no (police) help.  Come on.  Give me something to work with here.
Okay Benicio as a Mexican drug enforcement official struggling with honor and money.  Two US drug enforcement officials struggling with a job they know is ludicrous.  Okay I like it.  Why are you constantly cutting away from these men.  They seem fairly compelling.  Why is there not more of this.  Why the rich white kids do drugs too schtick?
Acting is patchy too.  Zeta Jones is attrocious (and I'm Welsh too).  She's either out of her league or preoccupied with hubby during this movie.  Douglas is equally unbelievable.  He just walks through the part with no effort or attempt at pulling his character off.  Benicio, the corrupt Mexican general, the hit man are all wonderful.  Very solid stuff from these guys.

Usually, ""movies with a social message"" turn me off.  I don't need to be preached to, thank you very much.  This movie was different: it criticized the absurd policies over ""the war of drugs"" by showing exactly how these laws effect people.

i for one find i vastly overated...the only strong plot line being bencio del toro's...first off...the colored washes gimmicky, easy..and artsy for art sake not needed nor do they add anything to the film except to make you realise you're now watching ""character x's"" story line.
now the idea of catherine zeta jones rich suburban wife taking over her husbands business while not impossible is highly improbable and lends an air of unbelievabilty to that part of movie..but that pales in comparison to the problems with michael douglas and his story in the movie..
1. yeah ok got it even the drug czar can have a kid hooked on drugs..wow..shocking..
2. um ok so none of these super rich kids deals drugs they all travel to the ghetto to get it?..please..what world do these film makers live in find any high school in any neighborhood in america and you will find a kid that sells drugs..
3. ok now the ""drug czar"" needs to find his little girl..who he cant believe is on drugs..so he takes to the streets no gun no cop no nothing..again ridiculous..a judge that prominent doesnt know one cop in his state he can trust or one person to bring with him to navigate the dangers and could the national drug czar not think a gun might be needed?..or could he not get one?...totally unbelivable
4. it just flat out doesnt happen that way in 99.9% of the cases
you don't go from your first taste of a drug..crack..to the level she got to in the span of what?..a week...give it a 6 months then maybe...and the imagery of the evil black drug dealer sleeping with the poor white confused girl is beyond sickening and racist..what she didn't have anything to sell to get some cash before she became a hooker?..none of her friends could loan her 10 bucks...
5. michael douglas is just not a very good actor..and the boyfreinds little speech to him about blacks and whites and the drug trade was such an obvious "" i know what you liberals are gonna say and here it is to cut you off at the knees"" bit of dialouge its funny

There are a number of different story lines that all start leading off at the same time, but they are all really related to the same main theme, which is the drugs trade in North America. The movie is not just based in the US, but nearly half of it is also set in Mexico, and so this part is all in Spanish language with English subtitles. It deals with many different aspects of the drugs trade, such as those who are dealing drugs (eg drugs cartels in Mexico and the dealers in the US), those who are using drugs (youngsters in the US) and those who are trying to clamp down on the drugs dealers(on both sides of the US-Mexico border). The movie also doesn't just give you one view of what the drugs trade is all about, as it deals with a number of different aspects and lets the viewer decide what to think. I think this is a great movie because there aren't any big punch lines and not everything works out in the end, and in reality that's the way the world is. Sometimes the 'bad guys' do get their way.

Three stories are held together by the common theme of drugs, but the only one worth mentioning is the one set in Mexico, a place where ""law enforcement is an entrepenurial activity"". Benecio Del Toro plays a police officer in a force where kickbacks are perks of the job, while corruption keeps the cartels in power. When he has the chance to turn those tables, pay close attention to his motivation, and the closing scene of the movie. It just adds another dimension to his character. ""Traffic"" blending of fact and fantasy is too much to digest. Some outlandish turn of events left me shaking my head.

I know Cincinnati was portrayed in such a way to add drama to the film, but it really made me squirm to sit and watch a movie that was supposedly showing what life was like in downtown Cincinnati. I know a lot of good folks who come from urban areas of our city, and although it isn't the easiest place to live I don't think everyone there is the scum of the earth. Unfortunately the scenes in the movie made me feel like thats what they are supposed to be in the eyes of the audience. Maybe I've been very naive in the viewing of my surroundings, but I felt like my town was made uglier than it is. Just like any other major city, we have poverty and drug problems that need to be remedied.

It was thus a surprise to see a film that dealt with a serious issue the war on drugs in a realistic and intelligent way.
Traffic is not preachy, it is fast paced and engaging despite using experimental techniques such as hand held cameras and processing the film for some scences in a bleached or non realistic way.
The issue with the drug was is that the margin on drug sales is such that drug runner can afford to lose half of their shipments and still make a profit. Detecting a high percentage of drug imports is close to impossible so that the long term price of drugs continues to fall and the purity rises. The film shows clearly the mechanics of the drug trade and why it is so difficult to stop.
Drug selling also makes huge amounts of money for suppliers. This gives them power especially in poorer countries and one of the films strengths is to show how easily the corruption can flow from the profits in the trade.
So many films show the drug war as a battle between some defined villians and Bruce Willis heroes. This film is able to convey a far greater sense of evil than any films of that type.

The movie is about three different drug stories that are somewhat linked to each other.  The first is about the Federal Drug Czar and his career track ambition blinding him to both the futility of eradicating the harm illegal drugs cause in America, and to the boredom that leads his teenage daughter to prostitution to support her drug habit.  The scenes in which the father looks for his daughter require a major suspension in belief.  No one, especially a bureaucrat would troll the ""mean streets as were expected to believe he does.
The second story, filmed sufficiently differently to remind us were now watching new characters, involves a drug dealer and his wife that was unaware of her husband's business until a snitch makes a deal and the husband is arrested.  Then were expected to believe that the pregnant wife wants to become part of the drug trade so that she can maintain her lifestyle.
Lastly there is the story of the drug trade south of the border in Tijuana.  This is shot with another color filter and in subtitles.  This is the best story in that it is much more likely and realistically done.  The Mexicans see all US governmental agencies involved in drug interdiction as tres letras or Three Letters as in DEA, FBI, CIA etc.  Theyre all seen as equally ineffective.
The acting is generally good except for Michael Douglas.  The movie is stylistic which makes it nice eye candy but otherwise it is insubstantial.  We do not come away from this movie having learned anything whether of benefit or not.  I saw nothing of groundbreaking note here.  Its a sad commentary when one finds oneself more interested in picking out the cameo actors than paying attention to the storyline.
If you have to see the movie, borrow it from a friend.  Don't spend money on it.  It's long and generally boring.  It won't stay with you.",1009843200,4,2069,4.671270718232044
1287977,4,B00003CXN4,"Steven Soderbergh's film about the war on drugs centers around three seperate stories somehow caught around the same enemy- drug power.  First off, there's Benicio Del Toro, a Mexican police officer battling drug related enemies across the Mexican border, visually realizing the dramatic death and cause of corruption that drugs destroy the world with.  Then there is Don Cheadle who is out to stop Catherine Zeta-Jones and her husband with their drug marketing in which Cheadle's federal officers and witnesses are being killed.  And more dramatically, we are introduced to a the highly powered Michael Douglas who is pitted against fighting the drug war that has corrupted his daughter, in which she's become a serious addict.
Not only is this film smart, but it mixes depressive reality with heavy drama.  This film is shot in three textures- a rustic faced picture, a deep and eerie, cold blue; and finally a modern regular picture.  These textures of picture set the tone of emotion throughout the film.  This film is powered by its performances from Benicio Del Toro, Don Cheadle, Michael Douglas, and Dennis Quaid.  This film is almost hard to watch because it is very durogatory and saddening, but it is the world today.  What helps this film is its ending which sheds light.  The ending sequence in which Del Toro watches the baseball game was a delight to see.  This film also introduces some interesting points- maybe not good- but interesting.  It opens up a new world to me.  25% of the world's teenagers and high schoolers are addicted to drugs.  It's easier for a 16 year old to buy cocaine and heroine rather than alcohol.  Street punks make five hundred dollars in two hours everyday from selling illegal drug produce, then spend the rest of their day doing whatever they please.  Murder and lies corrupt police stations and federal armies only to protect powerful drug companies.  Only 75% of the parents who's kids are on drugs will realize that they are doing it.  The world in Traffic is mad and deleriously sickening.  This film knows drama.  It knows what the audience doesn't want to see, and it gives them it anyway, because they don't want to tone down the war, Soderbergh wants to make it as real and as simple and harsh as possible.  However difficult it seems to comprehend, the more people will open there eyes and realize that the majority of the world is in chaos.  It may not appear as though it is, but it really is.
Soderbergh's dramatic piece hits where it hurts and where it is impacting.  It isn't perfect though, because it seems as though we are delivered too much.  It was hard for me to hold it all in as truth.  The sad part about it is that it is truthful.
I guess I can say this film is terrible, but actually good at the same time.  It depends on how you look at it.  Traffic is just merely an eye opening experience that is depressing and dramatic.  I can't recommend it to anyone only because I don't agree with what it presents and I don't like it, I just understand it and it means something to me to learn what the world is actually like.

1287978,1,B00003CXN4,"Why? Why? Why? was this movie considered a great accomplishment and an in depth study on the war on drugs. This movie was nothing more than boring , and long , and I found myself dozing off here and there during it. The only interesting story was Douglas and his daughter , the mexican cop , and the druglord's wife were boring and a waste of film. If the movie was about the czar and his daughter it may have earned at least 3 stars , and whats worse it'll switch characters to characters like about every minute , so you can't keep up with it. A 3 hr waste of time even though it had one of the coolest lines when the actor from That 70's Show and the czar's daughter are on the bed smoking heroin. Whats even more disgusting this film won an Oscar. It's trash like this that try to be groundbreaking and prove a point of some kind , but does nothing more than suck 3 hrs out of your life.

1287980,5,B00003CXN4,"I saw this movie because I'm a longtime admirer of Steven Soderbergh's work. He's probably most well known for his directing ""Erin Brockovich,"" ""Sex Lies & Videotape,"" and ""Out Of Sight."" Michael Douglas recent work in ""The Game,"" and ""The Wonder Boys"" (for which he should be nominated for an Oscar) is the other reason I wanted to see this movie. (""Traffic"" has been on my DVD want list for about a year now - ever since Soderbergh was rumored for involvement.)
I remember reading in Premiere magazine about the struggle that this film went through finding a director, and then how the stars all wanted to be in it because of him. It's a rollercoaster of a film, full of intensity, and then quickly followed by moments where the crowd in the theater will laugh, or clap when the something happens. There aren't many moments where that happens in movies anymore.
""Boogie Nights"" co-stars Luis Guzmn (who also played ""Chino"" in ""Out Of Sight"") and Don Cheadle (who also played ""Snoopy"" in ""Out Of Sight"") are once again important to the greatness of this film. Their characters provide much of the humor to the film, but not taking away from it's realistic intensity. That's not done very well in movies anymore, but they both do it perfectly here.
An incredible cast, without a throwaway moment in the movie. Dennis Quaid, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Benecio Del Toro, Steven Bauer, Amy Irving, Benjamin Bratt, Salma Hayak, and Erika Christensen all have very important roles, and Soderbergh blends them in, making us care about the good and bad guys.
While hanging around after the film was over watching the credits and talking to the people around me who enjoyed the film as much as I did, I noticed that Flea & Herbie Hancock helped to score the film, which should also be nominated for best score.
Stephen Gaghan wrote ""Traffic,"" who has also wrote for ""NYPD Blue,"" and ""The Practice"" - two shows known for their intensity and realism. He does a great job of combining several stories into one (As good as they've been done most recently in ""Pulp Fiction,"" ""Boogie Nights,"" and ""Magnolia."")",1007251200,,2090,4.776243093922652
1287981,1,B00003CXN4,"Soderbergh is without doubt the most laughably overhyped director in the business right now.  ""Traffic"" tells us absolutely nothing about the ""war on drugs"" that an intelligent, informed person didn't already know.  Furthermore, Soderbergh's acclaimed filmmaking techniques are all essentially ""borrowed"" from other directors who have used the same techniques to much better effect.  At it's core, ""Traffic"" is a completely hollow, completely commercial Hollywood-style movie which the director and studio designed to win the superlatives of the adoring critics and the Oscars committee.  There's nothing artistic or creative about any of Soderbergh's work, except maybe in the most shallow sense.  The cast of the upcoming ""Oceans 11"" gives his game away anyway:  Julia Roberts, George Clooney, Brad Pitt, etc., etc..  Soderbergh's game is the same as Hollywood's - to rake in the cash.

Considering the accolades this film received, I was surprised at how trite the story actually was. I've heard so many comments about how complex this film is and I just don't see it.
When it's announced that Madrigal/The Scorpion died during plastic surgery, you know he'll turn up later alive. It's no surprise that Salazar is in cahoots with the drug cartels. And there are holes, big ones, in the plot: Wouldn't Frankie Flowers' cell phone records link him to Helena Ayala? Wouldn't the DEA agents be more careful in protecting Ruiz, especially since an attempt had already been made on his life? The film also offers no real ground breaking insight into the issues raised. You can find better writing on tv (pick any episode of Law & Order). Shame on the Academy for honoring this movie with a Best Screenplay Oscar. It just doesn't deserve it!
In the end the film is saved by stylish visuals thanks to the direction of Steven Soderberg and great acting from an amazing cast. Traffic is worth a viewing...unfortunately, its all style and no substance.",1006128000,7,1166,4.748768472906404

However, I've got to wonder what kind of person thinks that this film makes anything other than the most simplistic statments about drug traffic or national drug policies.  What was Soderbergh thinking?  The characters are all charicatures from the liberal mindset.  The viewer has no opportunity to empathize with any of the characters...the victories are hollow and the tragedies are meaningless.  See a good production of ""Hamlet"" if you want to experience internal conflict and true tragedy.  This movie is like something Dan Rather would put together.

The story was boring and far-fetched and in my opinion, this was a hyped up bunch of hot-air.  For example, I've never seen a government official break down at a press conference because his daughters on drugs.  Come on!  Don't insult our intelligence.

1288038,5,B00003CXN4,"Steven Soderbergh's ""Traffic"" is an important film document of the world we know as the drug war. It is a well-assembled film that explores the facts and issues in a thrilling, intelligent way. It is a visceral movie that dives right into the realities of the subject with a clarity and sharpness seen in so few dramas. Here is one of the important American films. Split into three storylines, it shows what is wrong with the drug war, it shows the facts of how drugs get in here and why. What I got out of it is the idea that the idea that the drug war is a literal ""war"" is useless because it is more of a health problem and education crisis. Why are drugs so continuosly coming in here? Because people buy them. So, the problem isn't the cartels, the problem is US. How to fix it is what Soderbergh rightfully leaves us up to figure out. He shows here that he has the talent to be a visceral director like Oliver Stone or Martin Scorsese. He directs the scenes in Mexico with a grainy, gritty photographic style that adds mood and texture which is powered by Benicio Del Toro's stunning performance as a Tijuana cop trying to do honest work. The other stories are great too. The angle about the drug czar's daughter becoming an addict is a powerful warning sign to any parent. The storyline involving the police busting a cartel lord and his wife taking over is thrilling and intriguing. And Soderbergh films all with style but with a clarity and realism that make scenes feel like material from a documentary. ""Traffic"" is real, it is alive and it is a film that tells the truth. Anyone who cares to open their eyes to what has been going on should see it, anyone who wants to see a smart, important movie for a change should see it. Those critics here who whine that the movie is too long or boring, go home to your ignorant forms of movie-watching and rent ""Free Willy"" or something. ""Traffic"" is for the people with cojones.",1005868800,,1931,4.426966292134831
1288039,4,B00003CXN4,"O.k., now I guess you've already know what ""Traffic"" is all about, right ? But if you still haven't see the movie yet, let me give you some helpful reasons why you should do so: first of all ""Traffic"" happens to be THE most convincing and enthralling narcotics thriller since the glorious days when Popeye Doyle broke the french connection.
""Traffic"" is wonderfully acted, stunningly edited and photographed (Soderbergh operated the camera himself, using the pseudonym ""Peter Andrews"" !) and very uncommon for traditional hollywood film standarts. Benicio del Toro gives an outstanding performance as narcotics detective Javier Rodriguez Rodriguez, speaking only spanish throughout the entire film (alright, there is one brief scene where he speaks english with a heavy accent !), but Soderbergh also gets great performances from Michael Douglas, Luis Guzman (meanwhile a Soderbergh regular) and Catherine Zeta-Jones.
The soundtrack, composed by Soderbergh's longtime companion and former ""Red Hot Chili Peppers"" drummer Cliff Martinez, is very unnasuming and underlines perfectly the several situations of the film.
The transfer of this disc is very well done. Due to the fact that ""Traffic"" was shot in very grain images and colours (each of the three stories has another ""look""), very similar to the ""Dogma"" films, it is a little difficult to tell, if there were any flaws of picture quality, but to me it looks pretty good.
The extras on this DVD include an electronic press kit (or ""B-Roll"" if want to call it that), that seems very much of a letdown (because it looks to me like one of those Made-for-cable documentaries minus narration), but if you like to watch only the director directing (and the actors acting, haw, haw), you might get your kicks out of it. Me, I would have prefered at least one informative audio commentary track, like the one Soderbergh did for his previous DVD releases ""Sex, Lies and Videotape"", ""Out of Sight"" and ""The Limey"", which really offered not only intereseting insights, but was also highly entertaining. But, hey, you can't have it all, can you ? Extras also include several deleted scenes and filmographies of cast and crew.
O.k., so if you like to watch a good crime thriller for a change, then ""Traffic"" may serve you well, but be warned: if you are out to catch an action/adventure film, your popcorn might get stuck in your throath. I can assure you that ""Traffic"" contains almost no ""action"" whatsoever (there is only one brief chase at the beginning). ""Traffic"" tells three stories, has no main character the audience can rely on, and is more or less entirely based on characters and their motivations. A return to the great ""ensemble"" pictures of the seventies, if you like.",1005609600,3,2726,5.0198675496688745

The rest of the time we are supposed to feel sorry for a bunch of murderous mexicans trying to smuggle heroine over the border who are torturing some assassin for no reason. Some other guy gets shot by another guy and then 30 minutes later he is trying to save his life. It makes no sense. This movie is vERY long, and very drawn out.

1288095,4,B00003CXN4,"Traffic could be a documentary. Instead, Steven Sodenhberg shows us three seperate cases in which drugs are involved. The first one is about a senator (well played by Michael Douglas) and his daughter. She gets addicted to drugs after ""experimenting"" with friends. And later her case becomes more dramatic, when she becomes a prostitute and she's addicted to heroine. The second one is about two Mexican policemen. One of them (the excellent Benicio Del Toro) is involved in corruption, while he's supposed to stop the drug traffic in Tijuana, he works for a general that is in fact associated with drug traffic. And the last one, and the least interesting, it's about a woman (Catherine Zeta-Jones) who comes back from work one day, and sees the police in front of her house and her husband being arrested for drug possession. She has to live with her child that saw his father being arrested for a near reason. Their lawyer, played by Dennis Quaid, who is not very amazing in his role by the way, tries to replace the missing husband of that woman...but some drug stories make links between the three different stories. What was interesting was the fact that some characters from different stories could cross the same street at the same time, and never know anything about each other, like any normal pedestrian. That makes it more realistic. The most powerful story is the daughter's, and it's also the most disgusting. The most fascinating and entertaining one is the one in Mexico, and the last one is not bad, but could be better. Traffic shows the impact that drugs can have on people, and maybe it dramatizes it to the extreme, that's true, but there are really cases like these in the world. What is easy to understand is that drug traffic isn't the first cause of drug problems...it's the people who use drugs and get hooked on them. It's a moral message, and many movies that try to pass that king of message stink, but not this one. The acting is good, overall, especially form Benicio Del Toro...the directing reminds me of music videos, for the colors, the mood, the cutting actions, the always moving camera...actually, that could seem like amateurish directing, but in the case of Traffic, it just helps the film and the rythm. Very good film.",1001721600,,2260,4.767857142857143

The weaving of real people in government into the movie adds some flavor.  However, the overall experience is less than spectacular.  Michael Douglas is neither good nor bad, he is simply Michael Douglas.  The shining star in this movie is Benecio Del Toro as the gritty south of the border cop.

1288148,5,B00003CXN4,"This is the director's movie all the way, with no single character
  being the chief protagonist, and three stories running in parallel.
  Steven Soderbergh does a great job of it, and in my opinion fully
  deserved the Oscar he got.
  This was definitely one of the best movies of 2000, and not
  surprisingly, bagged several nominations and 4 Oscars.
  The 'traffic' is that of drugs, more specifically the drugs mafia
  in Mexico & America. The movie approaches the problem from several
  angles : the cartel in Mexico, their 'gang wars' and the efforts
  of the law to curb them; the 'respectable' among the high society
  in the US who act as channels for the cartel, the kids in the US
  who turn to drugs as a result of alienation, and American
  law-enforcers waging a frustrating battle against the drug cartel.
  Benicio Del Toro plays a brave Mexican cop, who's very well informed
  and wages his own little war against the cartel. He has the biggest
  role and does full justice to it in an excellent performance, which
  fetched him the Oscar for best supporting actor.
  Michael Douglas and Catherine Zeta-Jones are expectedly competent,
  but not really remarkable.
 Michael Douglas is a 'drug czar', ie he heads the American effort to
  clamp down on the 'traffic' at the highest level. Ironically, his
  own daughter is an addict,  which brings home the fact that it is an
  extremely difficult and frustrating battle he's fighting.
  Catherine Zeta-Jones plays a rich housewife, whose world suddenly
  colapses one day, when the cops come and take her husband away.
  Her grief is compunded by the horror of discovering that he actually
  deals in drugs. However, she then takes a u-turn and takes over the
  business while her husband is under trial, arranging for the murder
  of the key witness against him.
  Dennis Quaid is wasted in a pretty small role.
  The support cast is good, especially Cheadle & Guzman, who play the
  wiretap specialists investigating the drugs scam in San Diego, the
  guy who plays Del Toro's friend and the one who plays the Mexican
  general invloved in a diabolical game.
  The movie doesn't have an 'ending', in the sense it doesn't resolve
  all the issues, but i don't mind thinking for myself :-)
  So why does this movie get such mixed reviews ? Well, for one, the
  different 'shooting styles'(colors, angles etc) used for different
  places may not appeal to everyone - Mexico is yellowish, Ohio is
  blue, and San Diego is colourful & glossy. Secondly, the editing
  is swift, and very good in my opinion, but may seem abrupt to
  some. Then there is the so-called 'documentary style' employed by
  Soderbergh, who does the camerawork as well. And of course, many
  people like their movies to have 'proper endings'....
  So if you want a 'feel-good'/glossy movie, this isn't for you.
  However, if you want a well-directed movie with solid performances,
  which tackles a story from various angles and leaves it to you to
  draw your own conclusions, 'Traffic' should be worth your while.",1001203200,,3051,4.81139489194499

I felt so weird about it infact that I wasn't able to buy it for myself (especially after laying down ($) to see it in the theatre).  But I was given it as a gift and am very grateful...

1288150,5,B00003CXN4,"The tragic events of September 11 dramatically remind us that too much time and energy have been wasted fighting the so-called war on drugs. We now have a real war against terrorists who perceive the United States as the ""Great Satan"" who must be destroyed at any cost. Director Steven Soderbergh has created a masterpiece that demands the attention of all thinking citizens. We are provided a front row view of our futile efforts to prevent drug users from acquiring mind altering substances. Michael Douglas portrays the newly appointed U.S. drug czar who quickly learns that the task is hopeless. He can't even keep his own daughter from drugs, forget about complete strangers. Steven Bauer and Catherine Zeta-Jones are convincing as a man and wife team of major drug lords who hide behind the facade of normal yuppie respectability. Miguel Ferrer stars as a mid-level drug seller who long ago realized that he is easily replaceable. Guys like him are a dime a dozen, and his possible elimination would ultimately be rendered as meaningless.
""Traffic"" is held together by Benico Del Toro who eventually earned the Academy Award for this role as the Mexican undercover police officer committed to doing his thankless job. He is surrounded by corruption, and must exercise extraordinary virtue to prevent being likewise seduced by promises of great wealth and power. Del Toro interacts with virtually all the characters in this story. The war on drugs compels him to cooperate in torturing suspects, kidnapping an alleged killer in the United States and transporting the individual illegally over the border into Mexico, and many other violations of basic civil rights. This police officer is caught between a rock and a hard place, and opts to subscribe to the dubious ethic that the end justifies the squalid means. There is no way to combat the easy availability of drugs if one abides by standard police procedures, and the minimal dictates of Western Civilization.
Everyone should see ""Traffic"" at least once. This is especially true for our elected officials and legal scholars. The most recent terrorist attacks upon the World Trade Center and the Pentagon have only highlighted the absurdity of our war on drugs. ""Traffic"" will force everyone to ask themselves if this pseudo on-going conflict is worthy of continuation. I think many will be converted over to my negative position on the matter.",1000684800,4,2404,5.0732323232323235
1288151,4,B00003CXN4,"I had a hard time deciding whether Traffic or Crouching Tiger was the finest film of 2000.  I decided that Traffic was #2 ONLY because it's difficult to watch it multiple times, and the impact is not as powerful the second time around.  That being said, this is an amazing film.  Traffic explores 3 distinct sides of the drug problem in the United States: Trafficking, Use/Abuse, and Control.  It's amazing to see this topic portrayed even handedly.  This film certainly does not support the current method of drug control, but additionally, does not suggest legalization.  It does show what a negative impact illegal drugs have had on our society.  Some may be disturbed by the disjointed narrative: 3 distinct stories that abut each other, but do not intertwine.  The film is well worth the attention required to appreciate it though.  The image on the DVD is superior, but it lacks special features that would be welcome.  Certainly a commentary from Soderbergh would have been welcome.  Perhaps we'll see a special edition at a later date.",1000684800,,1043,4.902857142857143
1288152,3,B00003CXN4,"Traffic is most commendable for its cinematographic and actorial ability to create the hot, arrid, and hopeless feel of Mexico, the calm but uneasy nature suburbia (possibly the worst job it does), the striking and multi-faceted world of the upper class addict, and the torn morality of a drug cop.  Most notable is the performance of Benecio Del Toro, who continues to emerge as one of the most dynamic actors in the business.  But beyond it's solid fundamentals, Traffic is a bit too ambitious and simplistic.  In a rush to assert a pro/con format, the film forces its points, most egregiously when Topher Grace's Seth bursts out about the reasoning behind drugs in the ""ghetto,"" an important point that was merely brushed over by his speech.  Grace does well in his first role in a major film and there are really no complaints to be made about the acting, but each character is so audaciously allegorical that the story becomes a tough pill to swallow.  Moreover, with two hours of screen time to force ideas into the viewer's mind, Traffic is without a new idea (except for the dolls made of cocaine perhaps).  The ""social relevance"" of this film is capitulated and expanded upon in a single page in Charles F Levinthal's texts and the story is otherwise without any great appeal.  If you are curious about the world of drugs and truly a novice on the subject, then this is a fine introduction, otherwise you will be able to stay awake and commend the film for its production, not much else.",1000339200,,1496,4.687022900763359

I felt like I was reading a book, not watching an award winning movie.
The coloring of yellows and blues through out the movie were an eye annoyance.
The characters were unreal and showed no or little emotion for something as large as drug trafficking and teen / family usage.
I think the movie had a good plot idea but needless to say was played out very poorly.
I had to struggle to stay awake and I kept telling my self it would get better ... but never did.",1000339200,8,520,4.107843137254902
1288154,5,B00003CXN4,"I once asked my mother, who's a recovering alcoholic, why people become problem drinkers. She told me that there's no easy answer to that question, that the reasons are as numerous as the people who drink. That simple response told me more about the complexities of alcoholism than any ten books could have.
It's this objective, non-judgmental look at the drug problem that makes ""Traffic"" a superior film, and an excellent example of how to make a movie about a social or political issue without preaching. Rather than supply us with pat answers or preachy solutions, accompanied by a soupy Hollywood score, director Steven Soderbergh simply presents the problem as it is, and lets us take it from there.
Many other recent films about social or political issues have been notable as bully pulpits for their makers' political views. ""Dead Man Walking,"" ""The American President,"" ""Bulworth,"" and ""Philadelphia"" all come to mind, and while none are bad films per se, the political/social commentary in each becomes tiresome.
However, after watching ""Traffic,"" I defy you to tell me where Soderbergh stands politically on this issue.
It doesn't hurt that ""Traffic"" is also one well-made, well-acted film, with great characters.
In particular, Benecio Del Toro stands out as an honest Mexican policeman trying his best to save his town from drug dealers, with the overwhelming corruption of the Mexican justice system fighting him every step of the way.
In America, the corrpution is less obvious, but it's there. Newly appointed national drug czar Robert Wakefield (Michael Douglas) talks tough on drugs publicly, but his own daughter (Erika Christensen) is addicted to crack. Helena Ayala (Catherine Zeta-Jones) is a upper-crust socialite living the good life in San Diego, and she has no idea that her lifestyle is bought by drug dealing. Two DEA agents (Don Cheadle and Luis Guzman) are hell-bent on busting Ayala's drug dealing husband, knowing full well it won't make a bit of difference in the long run.
If drugs have caused overt corruption in Mexico, the corruption they've caused in our country is far more insidious and tougher to fix. ""Traffic"" brings this point out in standout fashion.
""Traffic"" is powerful stuff, and its power comes largely from its absolute refusal to give the audience easy answers. If nothing else, the realization that there's no pat answer to the drug problem - such as declaring ""war"" on it - will do anything to solve it may just be the key to really ending it.",1000080000,,2497,5.019277108433735

1288187,5,B00003CXN4,"Overwhelming in its ambition and far ranging in its scope, Steven Soderberghs eye-opening and mind-expanding Traffic comes as close to being a masterpiece as any American film in a long, long time.  Indeed, it reminds us of why we fell in love with movies in the first place.  Here is a film that finds not only the courage to grapple with a major social issue, but the artistry necessary to illuminate it.
Traffics greatest virtue lies in the nonlinear nature of its dramatic structure.  This allows director Soderburgh and screenwriter Stephen Gaghan to weave a complex tapestry of characters and plot elements, permitting us to see the issue from a myriad of different angles.  The result is nothing less than an epic survey of the drug war as it has come to be waged in the homes and streets of our cities and towns all around the world.  Traffic is not content to provide a simplistic moral lesson, as so many socially conscious films are won't to do.  Instead, it tries to provide as honest and comprehensive a view of the subject as is conceivably possible, concentrating on the depressing futility and murky morality that exist on both sides of the war.
In its panoramic survey of the issue, Traffic looks at characters from all levels of the social strata, from the users to the sellers, from high government officials in charge of bringing an end to drug trafficking to the corrupt leaders of the drug cartels who live to ensure its continuance, from parents, spouses and friends caught up in the tragic effect of the drug world to soldiers on the front line who come to question the validity of their life cause. Traffic seems to be suggesting that, in the war on drugs, it is we, as a society, who are the ultimate losers.  Even those of us who never use drugs are inadvertently affected by the problem.
Traffic spares no one, yet, at the same time, it offers shreds of compassion to any number of the characters caught in the vicious cycle.  Caroline Wakefield is, in many ways, a typical adolescent: pretty, bright and strangely drawn to what she feels is harmless experimentation with drugs, unaware of the consequences of her usage not only to herself but to society as a whole as she becomes a small but intricate part of the whole vast problem.  Her father, Judge Robert Hudson Wakefield, who also just happens to have been appointed the nations new drug czar, is a fairly typical modern parent as well.  Here is a man so dedicated to the advancement of his own career that, despite his love for his daughter, he has begun to reap the tragic effects that come with parental neglect.  As played by Michael Douglas, Wakefield is a good solid man honestly confused by the fact that the very problem he is dedicating his life to eradicating on a global scale is occurring right in his own backyard  and, like most concerned parents, he hasn't a clue how to deal with it.  Suddenly, all the clever slogans, buzz words and shibboleths that he has used to deal with this issue on the official level become meaningless in the context of his own personal crisis. His wife, Barbara (Amy Irving), faces the problem like many good parents who have themselves tried drugs in their youth, not wanting to blow the issue out of proportion, thereby providing little in the way of moral direction for her child.
Traffic is filled with innumerable other complex characters as well.  In his Oscar-winning performance, Benicio Del Toro plays Officer Javier Rodriguez Rodriguez, a corrupt Tijuana policeman who must decide which side of the law enforcement fence he will ultimately end up on.  Don Cheadle appears as Montel Gordon, a DEA agent who finds himself dedicating his life to a cause he may no longer believe in.  And Catherine Zeta-Jones plays Helena Ayala, a young wife and mother who receives a rude awakening as to the true character of her wealthy husband when he is suddenly arrested for drug dealing.  Each of these characters becomes an intricate part of the big picture and contributes, in his or her own way, to the moral ambiguity and complexity that distinguish this fine film.
In addition to all the brilliant performances, Traffic is distinguished by superb directing, cinematography, editing and scoring.  As both director and cinematographer, Soderbergh reveals a fine eye for texture, relying on a variety of color filters to root each scene in its own particular milieu.  Stephen Mirriones tightly-knit, award-winning editing keeps this sprawling tale from unraveling and Brian Eno and Cliff Martinez create a haunting, otherworldly quality to the film with their richly somber musical score.
One would be hard pressed to explain exactly WHY Traffic did not win the Academy Award for Best Picture of 2000.  It was certainly the finest film of the five that were nominated.  Whatever the reason, Traffic is a film that will live in the hearts and minds of those who have seen it for a long, long time.  It renews ones faith in the artistic possibilities of the American cinema  a faith that has been undergoing a large number of tests and trials in the past several years.

 Now for Traffic. There was one major flaw,casting Micheal Douglas. He is typical Douglas,over acting and overly dramatic. Other than that it was an interesting movie. Benicio Del Toro gives a suttle yet powerful performance as a good cop seeing all the corruption around him. He is the only character who you feel for. He is the moral conscience of the film.

This film points out that from these urban ghettoes, to the region south of the US border, to the living room of rich American aristocrats, the drug game is perpetuated by various demographic prophiles.

Most of the movie's content seems to be drawn from a collage of real life events over past years. I recall many actual news stories which are very similar to the plot points of of this movie. All of the drug war players are here. The junkie, the dealer, the cop, the corrupt officials, the honest but naive drug warriors. But the topic is so large, and the time so limited, they're like the chorus from a classical Greek play. They take the stage, deliver the lines which represent their point of view, and dutifully troop off. A long novel might have done justice to this story. But in a feature length movie, it's nothing more than cliched, inflammatory stereotypes and ham fisted preaching.

""Traffic"" is a dramatic epic about the ongoing war with drugs.  From the United States to Mexico, this film shows you the ugly presence of drugs, and how they affect the world.  This film does not have one story; it has many.  Like the very popular ""Pulp Fiction"", this film bounces back and forth to one area to another, except its all in order.  The advantage of this is that there are many characters for you to grow to love and hate; it also shows us the different stories and tragedies of how drugs can ruin and destroy lives.  This movie does not revolve around one story or one character; it revolves around a dozen of them.  The stories and characters keep you intrigued and connected with this powerhouse drama which is very unpredictable from the very beginning.
This movie is filmed very similar to an Oliver Stone movie; different types of film, camera angles, and switching to different moments within the blink of an eye.  This movie wasn't made to show how good conquers evil, and that alls well, ends well.  Many things are uncertain when you finish the movies, and there are no easy answers and no guarantee that everything is well in the end.  The point of this movie is to be realistic, and make us alert and understanding about the situation at hand.  This movie shows you that the situation is there, and most likely will never vanish.

1288228,2,B00003CXN4,"Given the complexity of the world's illegal drug trade, ""Traffic"" is a trickle of activity concerning drug trafficking between Tijuana, Mexico and The United States. It depicts a very accessible and obvious ladder of good and evil underworld hierarchy that includes South American drug cartels, a reluctant government informant right out of ""The Godfather"", a United States drug czar who battles illegal global drug trade but can't stop it in his own home, and a Mexican drug task officer fighting corruption in his own ranks. In ""Traffic"", the distinction between good guys and bad guys is obvious with little depth of character aside from either fighting or distributing drugs. The token drug addict here is so 'high', she behaves like a relic from the 1960s psychedelic scene, ""Far out man, I see colors!"". The over-ridden action sequences are cliched drug smuggling bits of bullets and blow-ups less compelling than even an episode of TV's ""Miami Vice"". There is a moral right-wing quaintness to ""Traffic"" that suggests we confront illegal drug use one pathetic addict at a time. Where serious answers lie to escalating drug use in America, we get instead an all encompassing theme that 'drugs are bad' laden in melodramatic trifle more akin to Joe Friday's ""Dragnet"" than it is to Hollywood's big drug statement.

1288229,3,B00003CXN4,"There was alot of hype for this movie but it just didn't live up to expectations.  While it had a great plot and such an excellent cast, the potential was there but it just lacked something.  The ohio and mexican scenes were filmed with a hazy yellow or blue lighting (done for artistic merit or whatever) were annoying and every monologue spoken by the characters was really slow and dragged out, very little emotion was shown through the movie,  which I found especially odd considering the heavy subject matter.  It was also a bit unrealistic, for example the daughter goes from being an honour roll etc. student who does drugs recreationally to very suddenly running away from rehab to living on the streets and sleeping with her drug dealer for heroin.  And of course this missed what could have been a great part in the movie, by showing what its REALLY like for people to do heroin (as in the after effects, not just the getting high part).
Alot of the movie relied on ""shock value"" by things that just weren't very shocking at all, like the upper class prep school kids doing drugs, the well respected business man being the drug lord and the mexican general who was trying to put an end to the drug smuggling really working for the rival cartel.  And none of these ""revelations"" were very suprising at all.  This movie was a typical drug war movie with no new material at all.",998006400,2,1385,4.560483870967742

The ""documentary"" style failed miserably and even the ambitious photography failed to hold the Tijuana scenes together  For me the only remotely interesting area was Michael Douglas' role as the Drug Watchdog who struggled to save his addicted daughter . Unfortunately even this story became muddled and failed to take advantage of a good opportunity give us real meat in the story.  In another of the parallel stories, Miss Zeta Jones' souless acting added an additional burden to a story that  lacked all credibility.  Across the board, the few interesting plot elements were treated so sublty as to be lost. In summary this was a movie that lacked direction and took way too much time to go nowhere.

The characters truly make you believe they're stories. It is uncanny. The movie also sports 3 color schemes to let you know, what ""part"" of the story your in. The directing by Soderbourg is indeed masterpiece work. Traffic has a ""documentary"" feel, so it adds to the realism of the drug problem in real life. One would think that it's a live recording of actuall happenings. Overall, the direction makes it stand out from any other movie Hollywood has ""greenlit"" in a while.

After having been mesmerized by the brilliant BBC series TRAFFIK, I was waiting to be dazzled. Sigh. Besides a blistering performance by Benicio Del Toro, this is lame,overwrought and hyerventalating cinema. The story surrounds interconnecting stories around drugs, from the newly appointed National drug czar{an unbelievably torpid Michael Douglas} to a drug king, and his wife{Catherine Zeta-JOnes is a typically wooden performance},the child of the drug czar, two cops, a Mexican cop{Del Toro}andd...the plot laid out over 6 hours on the bbc makes sense, in little over 2 hours it is frenzied and absurd. Douglas searching the ""inner"" city to find his strung out daughter,and not calling in any law enforcement folks he knows for favors is assinine, and simply not how these guys function. The supposed ""harrowing ""drug scenes are laughably bad{especially if you have witnessed the real thing}, Dennis quaid makes an appeARANCE as a shady lawyer, and grins his way through this embarrasment. Benjamin Bratt makes a truly ludicrous appearance as the mexican drug connection, with an accent he must have picked up from old Bill Dana routines. The best work is done by three standout actors: Don Cheadle, Luis Guzman and Benicio Del Toro. These three excellent actors hold this movie up. It works very vell when they are on screen, and becomes insipid when they are not. The ending, strangely is quite good and touching in such a light manner that it redeemed the movie for me. So , alltold, extraordinary work by Del Toro, excellent work from the always superb Cheadle and Guzman, weak, by douglas, laughably bad by Zeta-Jones.

1288236,4,B00003CXN4,"Obviously this is first and foremost an entertainment.  We don't want to be confused about that.  But director Steven Soderbergh does have a didactic point, and it's one I agree with.  The ""war"" on drugs will never be won with guns or law enforcement.  We can see this in the extraordinary sequence in which Michael Douglas, playing the newly appointed drug czar of the United States, steps away from his job and returns to his family.  He stops his speech and simply asks how can we fight a war in which the enemies are members of our own family?
Better yet, he might have asked, how can we fight a war when the enemy is ourself?
Soderbergh carefully avoids the appearance of taking sides, but the ending makes it clear that the ""war"" will go on; indeed the war has become institutionalized, a way of life for us and those involved in it.  In some sense the war on drugs has become an entertainment for couch potatoes napping in front of the TV, as well as a patriotic rallying point for others.
I thought Michael Douglas gave one of his finest performances, and Benicio Del Toro as the Tijuana cop torn between what he believes is right and the reality of his situation, was excellent.  The hauntingly beautiful Catherine Zeta-Jones was chillingly effective as a woman without morality, a sociopath with the survival instincts of a hyena.  Dennis Quaid, hardly recognizable without the grin, was competent as a sleazy lawyer who gambled big time and lost.  Don Cheadle as the ""solider"" in the war who loves the battle, the ""war lover,"" so to speak, was intriguing.  Erika Christensen deserves special praise for her compellingly true portrayal of an insecure teen who finds escape in the little death of heroin.
But I wonder if the average person seeing this movie realizes what the message is, that the war on drugs is a fraud.  Like the war in Vietnam it is a war that is, without changing the very nature of our society, unwinnable.  It is a bureaucratic monstrosity that we have created because we need an evil we can hate.
There is no ""solution"" to the ""drug problem"" because there is no solution to human nature.  A better approach to keeping the problem at a manageable level would be decriminalization and a massive program of education.  Why doesn't this happen?  First, because the entrenched bureaucracy that has a vested interest in maintaining its position.  Second, because the old ""moral majority"" in this country, people who imagine that they know the truth, and have the right to regulate the morality of others, will not allow it to end.  They need a target for their hate.  Note well that Douglas came home and renewed his efforts as a father because he realized that that is where he failed, as a father, and that is where we as a nation are failing.  Education begins at home.  If you don't know what kind of drugs your children are doing, then, as a parent,  you don't know anything.
Soderbergh tells this tragic story in a somewhat simplistic, but ultimately, very effective way.  The use of tinted filters to lend atmosphere and perhaps to help orient the viewer did not bother me, but I agree with those who found them unnecessary and not particularly effective.  On the other hand I thought the use of hand held cameras lend an intensity and immediacy to the action.  Note that one of Soderbergh's techniques is to show just a partial view of the action, such as just the guns and the hands and arms of the killers as Dennis Quiad puts down the phone.  We know what is going to happen from seeing only that much, and so does Quiad.  In fact, this is the way we sometimes view the world, the salient objects in our view register and we act.  Soderbergh's technique of showing the ""war"" at various levels and in differing environments and from differing points of view was obvious but nonetheless very effective.
But Soderbergh did not go far enough.  Instead of showing the vulnerability of a judge with a junkie for a daughter, he might have had the local police catch her trafficking out of her house and had them unconstitutionally seize his property.  Maybe then the message would get home to the American people that the war on drugs has the potential to become a threat to our democracy and our republican form of government.",997056000,2,4258,4.64
1288287,2,B00003CXN4,"Ugh. Like most people who had a problem with this film, my biggest disappointment came from the entire American User/abuser part involving Douglas' character and the spoiled brats high on smack. I despise movies that only serve to rile people up for no good reason. Soderbergh used the oldest trick in the book: Make the white middle-aged guy with an exceptional daughter totally ... out by showing her being shot up with Heroin and then ... by a violent black man. How ... racist and insulting to black people can you be! Then there was the scene where the daughter's boyfriend gives his indignant dissertation on the state of the drug war to a Drug Czar! Huh? I would have slapped the ... of that kid! I found it most interesting also that Catherine Zeta Jones could become so well-versed in the conversion of high-impact cocaine into powder form in such a short time. Cheadle did a fairly good job as did del Toro. Douglas was lazy, Amy Irving was plastic, Steven Bauer has never done good work and Dennis Quaid should be doing infomercials. This was obviously another contrived, Hollywood liberal view of the drug world and why you should be skeptical of any movie involving Michael Douglas, Steven Spielberg, Martin Sheen, Robert Redford, James Brolin, etc. If you want to see a good movie about a real life drug dealer, go see ""Blow"".

Not great, or [bad], just ok.  First off, the cinematography is pretty good.  I like Soderbergh's film school style.  The acting covers all ranges, from excellent to bad.  Benicio Del Toro actually pulled off a role that was completly spoken in spanish.  I haven't seen something like that since De Niro did it in the Godfather 2.  Douglas's part seems flat, and the fact that the drug czars daughter is on crack seems alittle outragious.  ...Miguel Ferrar(sp?) is good as always.  He can play a wormy shady character better than most.  What put me off was the length and the almost total lack of humor.  Sure this a dead serious subject, but in order for me not to snap while watching a lengthy movie, it either needs to be A: a great and compelling movie, like the Godfather, or B: it needs to have some comic relief, something to break the tension.  The part where the two cops are joking around is funny, but this movie just seems to be weighted in its own preachiness.

1288292,5,B00003CXN4,"Perhaps Michael Douglas' thrusting into the Drug Czar position was a crack at the US Government for finding someone...anyone...to take the heat for what is inevitably going to be a failed attempt at winning the drug war. Or maybe Douglas' own lack of superior expertise in the matter is reflective of our just past, real life Drug Czar's incredibly unsuccessful ""Just Say No to Drugs"" educational campaign, where kids aren't learning anything but sugar coated wive's tales instead of learning how to deal with drug-related situations. Maybe even more telling than that is the fact there is a drug problem right in his own backyard, perhaps being a shot at people who wage campaigns so vigorously but neglect to give the proper attention to their own children.
Equally frustrated is Benicio Del Toro's character, an honest Mexican cop who isn't supported by his own government. A cop who can't do his job because the people he is fighting against go much higher than street level dealers. In short, no matter what he does, he is still being controlled.
There is the drug lord in La Jolla who perhaps personifies the fear of having a crime lord exist in the seemingly most serene suburbs. I'm not exactly sure what to think about Catherine Zeta Jone's character, whether she was indeed left completely in the dark by her husband, or if she put up a really good front in order to continue operations.
Whatever the case, this movie was so well executed that most other movies seem childish in comparison. The color schemes were used well to represent mood and energy, from the yellowish tint of Del Toro's scenes, to the dark gray tones of Douglas' scene, to the more vibrant colors in Zeta Jones' family-oriented setting in which the public may relate more to. All the major players in this film started to lose control over what they cherished the most. Douglas' war was hitting roadblocks, and his daughter became a crack whore. Zeta Jones' perfect life was shattered when her husband was dragged off by the DEA. Del Toro's dream of cleaning up the streets was halted by the realization that the powers-that-be simply would never allow it to happen. Many other subplots, including Frankie Flowers having to give away his employers to the government when he really didn't have much of a choice in the matter (thus sealing his death), were portrayed with enough realism to the point the average joe could almost feel the same fear that the people in the movie were dealing with.
The cast was simply stellar, and while races of all sorts had their part in the film, it's somewhat disappoining to read some of the reviews on this page where people play the race card.",996537600,,2662,4.764069264069264
1288293,5,B00003CXN4,"Sometimes I just don't understand what the Academy is thinking.  The two key areas that detracted from this film were direction and editing.  So, of course, two of four Oscars this film won were for Best Director and Best Editing.
Steven Soderbergh is one of the most creative directors around.  He is also one of the most self indulgent.  This is another example of style overwhelming substance.  After playing it straight with ""Erin Brockovich"", Soderbergh picks up where he left off with ""The Limey"" and attempts to break whatever record exists for throwing the most stylized techniques into a single film.  Admittedly, many of the images are brilliantly filmed with great impact.  However, the excessive technique begins to get in the way of the story and makes a complex plot even harder to follow (and stomach).
The story is a fascinating look at the drug trade from the perspective of various players in the game.  Soderbergh feels compelled to color code the simultaneous vignettes with an assortment of hues by varying the filters to produce blue for one, sepia for another, etc.  This is not only disturbing, but a bit insulting to viewers who really shouldn't need the color code to follow the story (except maybe for the disjointed editing).  The editing is choppy and the constant use of hand held cameras while giving certain scenes a dynamic ""in your face"" quality, often becomes distracting and annoying.
If there is one area that is uniformly excellent, it is the acting.  The entire ensemble does an outstanding job, top to bottom.  Benicio Del Toro is tremendous and deserved every ounce of the Best Supporting statue he received.  Don Cheadle gives a career performance as well.  Erika Christensen does a bang up job as the drug czar's addicted daughter.  Michael Douglas is intense and unravels marvelously as his world comes crashing down around him.  The acting is a solid ten everywhere you look.
As well received as this film was, I believe it could have been much better if Soderbergh restrained himself a bit.  Of course part of being Steven Soderbergh is to be obsessed with showing everyone just how brilliant a director can be, regardless of how it might affect the film.  (How producer Danny DeVito got Soderbergh to stay out of the way in ""Erin Brockovich"" is amazing to me.)

But who in the hell told us that ""Traffic"" was a good movie?  So what do we have here, we have like eighteen different intertwining stories that all mesh into a web of cocaine-encrusted celluloid. For starters, we've got Michael Douglas as Bob Wakefield, the brand-new head of the United States Drug Prevention Initiative Policy Blah Blah Blah. Hole Number One. No head of drug prevention in these United States would be as absolutely clueless as Judge Wakefield. Oh yeah, he's a judge! The guy has no idea how drug trafficking works, doesn't know any of the statistics or the ins and outs of the drug trade in America, and he's the most qualified for the job? Forget it.  Okay.  So his daughter is on crack. Did I mention that? His daughter is a bonafide crack addict. No pot, barely any booze, straight to the premium: snorting and freebasing. Meanwhile, her father serves as the audience proxy, an earpiece for all of screenwriter Stephen Gaghan's impressive research. So eventually his daughter runs away from her drug retreat and begins sleeping with her crack dealer for free rock, realizing a rich father's worst nightmare:  his daughter is sleeping with a black man.  All right, enough plot summary. That's for movie reviews, and this ain't a movie review, it's a venting session. Is there anyone reading right now who doesn't think that the War on Drugs only fuels the drug trade in the country, and that it's probably a front for a massive government importing conspiracy? No? Anyone? No? Good. Then don't see the movie. Because that's all they say for two and a half hours. I felt like my brain was going to explode. I haven't hated a movie this much since I saw ""Magnolia"" and almost chewed out my medulla oblongata.  The only real bright spots in the movie came from Don Cheadle and Luis Guzmn, FBI drug investigators who also happen to be great actors. The usually wonderful Michael Douglas comes off as preachy and nave, while the usually stellar Benicio del Toro - Academy Award winner for Best Supporting Actor for this role, by the way - never changes his facial expression and is just barely vindicated in one of the most saccharine-sweet, manipulative movie endings since ""Free Willy.""  Don't get me started on wunderkind-of-the-year Steven Soderbergh's directing mishaps. Nearly half of the movie was shot on a hand-held camera, producing a theatre-wide seasickness not rivaled since ""The Blair Witch Project"" and not done half as well. The rest of the movie consisted of artsy trick angles - including an upside-down shot of Douglas's helicopter that made no sense - bright-light shots reminiscent of ""Heathers,"" and shots of nature having nothing to do with the rest of the film.  The only bright spot in Soderbergh's messy montage of mediocre vignettes was the section of the movie dealing with the cartel wars in Tijuana. The slightly-off style of shooting, the yellowed color of the film, and the impersonality of the shots made you realize that this was a completely different world. For the most part, however, someone should tell Steven Soderbergh that he shouldn't try to be Oliver Stone. Oliver Stone tried that, and we got ""Any Given Sunday."" So watch out.  Anyway, I've never felt so gypped as I did coming out of that movie. Let me set the record straight:  ""Traffic"" sucks.

Sadly, Traffic offers a distorted view of reality.  Cocaine is presented here as an overwhelming, almost demonic force.  Viewers might never guess that cocaine is actually very similar to alcohol, in that only a minority of users ever become addicts.
Worse yet, Traffic seems overtly racist and insulting to Mexicans and African-Americans.  The scene where the black drug dealer in the ghetto dopes up the rich white girl and has sex with her is like something out of Archie Bunker's nightmares.

A skill that is prominent in art-school classes populated by 20-something know-it-all, upper-middle-class talentless fools who seem to believe that the secret of good film-making is a sepia-coloured filter over the lens, and multiplying the run-time by 2.

I've seen traffic jams that were more interesting.  As a whole, I thought the film was slow, uninspired, and trite.  There was nothing new in this film.  Like we didn't know that suburban white kids are smackheads, or that drug lords try to find legit fronts for their business, or that governments are the real drug trafficers.  I was unimpressed by everything but the performances of Benecio Del Turro and Don Cheadle -- they're the reason I even bothered to give the film any stars at all.  If you'd like to see an interesting drug movie, find ""Requiem for a Dream.""  It didn't win any Oscars (though Ellen Burstyn was nominated and lost to Julia Roberts).  It barely played in any theatres (due to the mpaa's refusal to rate the film). ""Requiem"" makes ""Traffic"" look like a Disney movie...or an Oscar winner.  In my opinion, the latter is worse!

It was like watching paint dry, except that once paint has dried, something creative has usually occurred.  Traffic was nothing more than one long series of scenes taken from other hack movies that had been pieced together.  The script was trite and filled with all the overused cliches from all the movies the scenes were pilfered from.  I know that the politicians that appeared throughout the movie are shameless but I expected more from Michael Douglas and the rest of the cast.  I don't want to sound too apathetic, but I can read the headlines almost any day of the week and put together more intrigue, suspense, and sense of reality than this movie portrayed.  Someone please tell me where I can get a copy of the other Traffic!

1288346,5,B00003CXN4,"Directed by Steven Soderbergh of Erin Brochovich fame, this high-speed intense film delves deeply into the contradictions, absurdities, cruelties and realities of the war on drugs.  Loosely based on a British mini-series and now set in a North American locale, it packs a strong punch.  One of the story lines takes place in Mexico, filmed in hues of deep yellow and brown, in Spanish with English subtitles.  Benicio Del Toro plays a Mexican cop who must constantly make hard choices as he walks a thin line between degrees of corruption.  He's a fine actor and I was surprised to discover that he is only 34 years old;  he looks much older with his expressive brooding eyes surrounded by dark circles. Michael Douglas is cast as a conservative Ohio judge who is appointed  to lead the fight against drugs in Washington while unaware that his 16-year old daughter, played by Erika Christenen, has a drug problem of her own. And then there is Catherine Zeta-Jones, a 31-year old dazzling beauty whose role becomes more complex as her innocence changes when she realizes that her young family is being supported in their upscale San Diego lifestyle by drug money.  Two San Diego drug enforcement cops played by Don Cheadle and Luis Guzman provide comic relief.
The film is a full 147 minutes but is never boring as there is tension throughout.  It moves fast and skips from story to story, revealing new details which add to its complexity.  I found the developments almost impossible to follow, but it soon became apparent that this was by design and actually a mirror of the realities of the situation.  With the exception of one small part, the film doesn't preach.  Instead it just watches and observes and lets the action and the movement of the characters make its powerful impact.  This is a video that I'd like to see again.  Now that I've been exposed to the general themes, I'd like to watch it more carefully to follow exactly how, by the end, even the well-meaning people all seemed to contribute to the drug mess which thrives within our culture today.  The official tagline says it all.  ""No one gets away clean.""  That says it all.",995673600,4,2145,4.741239892183288

1288388,1,B00003CXN4,"This movie is long... really long. I felt like I was watching a film student's project. The cheap gimmick of the different colors for the different settings served little purpose.  Also, the handheld camers shots did little to add to the feel of the movie. The numerous characters were never really developed to a point where I had an interest in any of them.  I really couldn't have cared less what happened to any of them (maybe that was the point of the movie - but it made me quickly lose interest).  Even a wonderful performance by Benicio Del Toro couldn't save this movie.  This movie was written from the point of view of someone who observed drug culture in the 70s.  Many of the situations seem to reflect the attitudes of that era and not what is going on in the year 2000-1.  After seeing the previews I really wanted to like Traffic, but it seriously let me down.",995500800,4,876,4.44375
1288389,5,B00003CXN4,"Most would not consider a film about the war on drugs 'great entertainment'. And they're right. It was beyond great. 'Traffic' is an amazing film that shows three sides to the 'war on drugs'. There are three stories here all mixed together in a series of short cuts that jump from one story to the next, leaving the viewer wondering what will happen and what they will see next. The first story that we are introduced to involves a cop named Javier, played by Benicio Del Toro. Javier and his partner become involved with a general who is actually playing drug cartel on the side. The general wants to get rid of all the other cartels in Mexico, but only so that he is the only one left. The second story is that of the newly appointed drug czar, Robert Wakefield, played by Michael Douglas. While he is trying to adjust to his new surroundings, his daughter (played by an amazing Erika Christiansen) is getting deeper and deeper into drugs with the aid of her boyfriend Seth (played by surprise, surprise Topher Grace from 'That 70's Show'!). The final story is sort of two stories that are interwoven. This one involves two undercover cops (played by Don Cheadle and Luis Guzman) and the woman they are watching (played by Catherine Zeta-Jones). The woman did not know that her husband was involved in selling drugs. When he is carted off to jail, she finds that he was deeply in debt to a cartel named Juan Obergon. As all these stories start to unravel, the viewer is shown a world where the motto is 'Once you get in, you can't get out'. We are taken to places we would never go, see things most people have never seen and we are taught a valuable lesson. I'll let you figure out what it is on your own. Steven Soderberg is obviously a great filmmaker ('sex,lies and videotape' and 'Erin Brokovich') and with 'Traffic' it is only made more clear. The way the stories are interwoven and the way they look make this movie as visually stunning as it is well-acted. I'd also like to applaud the screenwriter Stephen Gaughan. I look forward to his directorial debut. As far as the movies last year went, 'Traffic' was and is a stand-out motion picture among the mediocre films of today.",995500800,7,2186,4.536708860759494
1288390,5,B00003CXN4,"I can't believe how many people completely missed the point of this movie. In reading reviews it's very easy to tell who expected a Disney/Hollywood epic and who was ready to accept the movie for what it was. The film attempts to show the reality of America's drug problem and it does so with various techniques, primarily by using handheld cameras and rough editing, making you feel like part of the action.
What most people misunderstand about this movie is the very premise upon which it stands. Namely, drugs are everywhere and nobody is immune from their effects. Even upper-class white prep-school students are doing it. And I can't even believe the idiotic comments I've read that cite this portion of the movie as unbelievable because these rich kids did drugs for ""no apparent reason."" Did you *watch* the film? That's its point! If people believe that these rich white kids aren't doing drugs because ""there's no apparent reason for it"" then what are they really saying? What *are* these ""apparent reasons"" they mention? Being poor? Being black? Coming from a broken home? It's amazing how transparent our culture becomes when we discuss these issues. What we really believe becomes clear.
This movie at least tried to dispel the myth that the only hard-drug users in America are poor blacks in the inner city. Most negative reviews come from people who just can't accept that fact and are truly part of the problem that the heroes of the movie are trying to defeat. The greatest ally of this problem is people not believing there really is one.
On a filmmaking level, I appreciate what the director was attempting to do. The film was raw and had a documentary feel to it. If you want the Disney version of a drug movie that makes you feel safe and sound as long as you stay away form cities and/or minorities, don't watch this. But if you want a film that makes you feel like you are actually one of its characters and that your own mother might be on something, then Traffic is your movie.
Any time a film that tries to depict the reality of a situation is made, we usually will see two camps of reviewers - loved it or hated it. That's because one group was able to understand the movie and what it was trying to do and the other group gets upset because they weren't ""entertained"" by it, the camera shakes a lot, there weren't enough special effects, the film was grainy, etc., just missing the point totally. This film was trying to wake people up from their coma and realize that America has a serious drug problem, and everyone is affected by it. Usually we don't realize this until it's too late (as in Michael Douglas' character's case). I'm amazed at how many people still seem to have their head buried in the sand after seeing it, citing the fact that rich white kids doing drugs is an ""unbelievable"" element of the movie. It must be nice to live in their enchanted fantasy world where rich white people don't use drugs.
On a final note, the DVD itself gets only 3.5 stars. For such a unique movie there are very few extra features on the DVD discussing it. There isn't even a commentary, which in my opinion is just inexcusable in this age of technology. There is no reason to not include these extra features, other than the fact they want to later release a special edition with a commentary and make us buy both versions.",995414400,5,3347,4.58

'Traffic' is not a short easy ploted story. It is a documentary of some sort told through the circumstances of several different characters. This may cause problems for some people, if they do not expect the story line to jump back and forth throughout the movie - but once you see were the movie is going, you'll hopefully enjoy the way the film is edited into stories jumping back and forth.
'Traffic"" explores the surroundings of drug users all over the world. There is not one thing in Traffic that has not happened. It has to do with: families, police, governments and everyday teenagers like myself.

1288394,3,B00003CXN4,"It seems to me that in the last several years the film industry has completed degenerated in terms of basic competence. Everybody is trying too hard and too many people are involved in any given project, and all the movies end up as mere teasers to what Could Have Been.
In this sense, it does not surprise me that Traffic was so lauded. Because it's, you know ... OK. Whereas most movies suck utterly. It's not really great. Not a masterpiece. And though far from brainless, it's nonetheless not as thought-provoking as it probably fancies itself to be.
Relatively decent performances, I suppose. I always enjoy Benecio Del Toro, though I couldn't help but feel his character was a bit underdeveloped here. The performance is good (though not overly demanding), but you just never get that into him as a character. It doesn't help that his particular branch of the story is rather confusing. Michael Douglas fits his role like a glove, but it's pretty standard fare for him. Catherine Zeta-Jones is acceptable, but her character's transformation -- which had the potential to be one of the more absorbing aspects of the film -- simply happens too fast, doesn't ring true, and is confusing in certain technical respects. The girl who plays Douglas' daughter -- I've forgotten her name momentarily -- is equally acceptable, and seeing her succumb to debasing herself so thoroughly to maintain her habit is indeed affecting -- but like most everyone else in Traffic, the character herself remained more than a little underdeveloped, and relatively unlikable.
In the end, it's not that Traffic was bad. It held my interest. But it just wasn't all that great either. Definitely overrated and self-important.",994982400,3,1703,4.978947368421053

The movie itself is boring and way too long (listed at 147 Mins). And for some reasons, the picture is presented in 3 different color setting for each plot line so Michael Douglas, Catherine Zeta Jones, and Benicio Del Torro all have 3 different colors. The DVD itself is OK. Picture is sharp and the Dolby Digital 5.1 is ok as most of this movie is dialogue anyway.

Benicio Del Toro plays a lowly Mexican cop, a man who is haunted by his past, and regrets the future he soon will have.  In a country where law enforcement is considered an entreprenurial endevour, the Mexican police are individuals of both crime and a demented sense of justice.  Other roles played by Catherine Zeta Jones, as the wife of an accused drug lord and Dennis Quaid as the lawyer that defends him are also memerable.  Michael Douglis's part, is less than memerable.

1288431,2,B00003CXN4,"I had read recently that members of the US Congress were making use of this movie to re-visit the policies of the War on Drugs.  If our congressmen see these hackneyed themes as major revelations, that is indeed frightening.
A few years back there was mini-series on Masterpiece Theater that, I assume, was based on the same novel, as the stories were almost identical.  A gentleman is appointed drug czar in the UK, just as he discovers that his daughter is an addict.  A major businessman is found to be a drug king-pin, to the shock and dismay of his wife, who then goes into the business herself, and is even better at it. Yada, yada....Of course, Masterpiece, with it's way of presenting a story over several weeks, rather than a mere 147 minutes, was able to go into much greater depth, and develop some real characters.  Besides which, the ideas presented were probably just a little newer (though not much) back in the eighties.
This movie version has far too much happening and far too many characters, so that the whole thing ends up rather flat. Indeed, had I not seen the mini-series I might not even have picked up on some of the many plots.  The wife's (Catherine Zeta-Jones) entering into the drug trade on her own, was just barely covered.  And a sub-plot about a business partner trying to move in on her when the husband was in prison, was so badly handled that you didn't even know it had happened until it was over.
It is the rare movie that can handle all the plots and characters that can be covered in a novel or mini-series.  Instead, they should try to pare down the characters and themes, and then cover them in greater depth.  As it was, the ""extra touches"" like filming all the Mexican scenes in a wavey, hot- yellow light did nothing to convince me that this was anymore artistic than your average drug heist movie.  And the supposedly ""new"" questions it raised, were actually very old ones.",994464000,9,1920,4.558139534883721
1288432,1,B00003CXN4,"I just watch Traffic, and I have to say it is nothing like the reviews had to say about it being a Masterpiece, Just as big as the God Father Epic, A Flat-out Electrifying Experience, Scenes play like tubo-charged versions of real life, and blah blah blah!!!
I did not like the movie, because they did a very bad job of story telling! I could not get into, or feel for any of the characters in this story. There was a lot at stake for the characters in Traffic, but they did not give you a performance that there was anything at stake at all.
I will touch, on my other reasons why I did not like this movie by naming the four Academy Awards that they got this year.
Best Director: how did Steven Soderbergh get this award? Did the people really watch the movie. I still believe it should have gone to Ang Lee, or even Ridley Scott, because they did tell a better story that had better direction than Traffic. Sure, Traffic has direction, tries to sound smart, but I believe it failed doing so. How did if fail? I believed it failed by doing too much, trying to tell too many stories, and pulling them all together into one in the end. I am sure if they worked on it a little longer, they could tell a better story.
Best Adapted Screenplay: Give me a break, and send me to the moon!!! Once again, they could have told a better story, if they seem took their time to write it out. I was reading the information inside the DVD cover, and it look like they did work on it for some time, but there was something missing in it. So, I have to go back to the performances again. The performances did not seem real to me, it was like yeah whatever, just get off my case!!
In addition, they got the idea from a TV miniseries called ""Traffik"" in the early 80's. For some reason this does not set well for me, it just seems to me not too much work is happening here. Because that is one of the first things we do in writing class, is taking stories and rewrite them, its not that hard of an task to do...
Best Supporting Actor: I felt nothing from Benicio Del Toro, in his role as a Mexican Cop. There was one time in the movie that I did felt something from him, and that is in the end. I have to say that was the best part, because the ending was very moving. His performance as a whole was so so to not much. I thought Joaqun Phoenix played a stronger roll and should of got Best Supporting Actor!
Best Film Editing: YAK!!! and i YAK AGAIN!!!! I have not seen soooooo many bad editing job in my life, it made movies like The Blair Witch Project, and Plan 9 From Outer Space look great! There was not much to any action in this movie to make people look good at in what they are doing. Therefore, they shot one or two bullets, and blow up a car big whip/tea doooo. I mean if they are going to give out this award for film editing, give it to somebody that Had to do Hard Work to make things look real and believable...
So, I ask what was the big haa/doo with Traffic? The only thing I can think of, it was really a pro drug story more than an anti drug story. No one is clean, so don't judge me. Is what I got from this story.
I watch it twice trying to find the magic behind this movie, and I could not.
I did not care about how it was filmed using a dirty black and white in Mexico, and using clear clean Color in the USA. I was amazed; however, to see that the characters did change colors when they went from Mexico to the US, talking about not staying in character. LOL!!
I believe what would have made the movie better, is by doing less with it.  I believe they would have had a great story by keeping it in Mexico, I think that was there strong suit in the movie.

And what can I say about Benicio del Toro. I can't, his performance was brilliant to say the least. M.Doulglas, and C. Zeta-Jones acted just as well too.

Instances such as this, as well as Catherine Zeta Jones taking over her husband's drug business, descend this film into moral allegory but the situations are too Hollywood-ized to take seriously. Sometimes, this is another lame SUBURBANITES, BEWARE! movie. Michael Douglas proves his lameness once again when he doesn't even have enough juevos to get a gun and get his daughter back from the drug dealer. I mean, come on, everything in the film is so fantastic anyways, the one instance where most men would have really gone berserk, he wimps out? Lame. Most men would have gone back with a shotgun and tried to get their daughter whether they were killed or not. Michael Douglas' character, on the other hand, lets this snot-nosed wimpy teenager lecture him on politically correct BS about the ghetto and drug trade while his daughter is hanging out up in the crack house? Whatever. If that was me, I would have beat that punk Seth's face into the ground. Just listening to his drivel made me want to throw up. The other problem I have with this film, a more serious flaw in my opinion, is that, ultimately, all it does is flush out the complexities of the ""drug problem"" in an overblown, pure Hollywood kind of way. The most telling line of the film is when Michael Douglas says ""If we wage a war on drugs, we're waging war on our own families. And I don't see how you can wage war on your own family.""
Well, welcome to Adult Land, Michael, I hope you enjoy your stay!
Know what? Prosecuting bank robbers, murderers, traffic offenders, rapists and counterfiters also disrupts families!
This film doesn't provide any relevant new insight into the drug problem, in my opinion, all it does is snip at the heels of the ""establishments"" war on drugs and rally against a percieved-white, suburban mindset of naivety.
To me, this was like a seventeen year old, bitter white boy's treatise on drugs gone out of control. In the end, it was circular and old material. I don't understand all of the praise. Entertaining, but that's about it.",993772800,2,2336,4.713936430317848

1288492,2,B00003CXN4,"WTH?? What in the world is wrong with you people? What is there to like about this ""movie""(this monstrosity doesn't even deserve that title) Traffic does nothing more than bore, depress, and thoroughly annoy. Michael Douglas is a great actor, did they build a freakin' robot that looks like him, who has no expression(besides coldness), goes from one official building to the next and mumbles and nods to some officials? That was his role thru this entire movie. No more. And his piece of trash daughter going from a typical, casual drug addict to a ... in a week and then pissing and moaning at an AA meeting a week later? Sure, sure. Are we supposed to feel sympathy for her now? I wished her dad would have just disowned her and let her descend into hell. And the La Jolla segement in San diego--I'm laughing. HA HA. So Don Cheadle's partner is iced, his key witness iced, and he WALKS into the San Diego drug lords home, past the guards,creates a scene, and manages to plant a bug under a table? THAT'S how they ended it? Christ, I'm all for viewers' interpretation and imagination, but a BUG? There's no way to even contemplate what the outcome of that segment would be. Maybe the bug picked up sounds of Catherine Zeta-Jones and her druggie husband getting it on in the bedroom. Maybe someone found it and ripped it out and smiled about how smart they were. Do we care? Catherine Zeta-Jones' character was loathsome and paper-thin. She's a rich yuppie who's made out to be a caring,naive, loving mother, who after her drug lord hubbie's arrest, becomes a conniving, ruthless, murderous, drug-dealing witch for no other reason than to keep her fat, rich lifestyle? Why would she even care about her husband? It just goes to show you how pathetic and cruel congenitally wealthy people are. The only redeeming part of the movie was the segment shot in Mexico, with a yellow, grainy look. That and the subtitles made those scenes feel really genuine. Benecio del Toro does a good job as the honest cop, who is the only hero in this movie and you feel his pain as he is caught between the U.S and Mexico drug cartels. Also, this is the only segement in the movie with a believable conclusion! But the ending of the film--did I miss something? No, no, no. Actually the ending was perfect. I needed to return the video in ten minutes or I would be charged another $4.00! So there was the cop, watching the baseball game, and the movie ended! Sweet! The hype is misplaced, the Oscars are unwarranted, the characters are loathsome,the three parts of the movie are hopelessly disconnected, and the basic message is,""the drug war cannot be won, its hopeless, so lets just wait for superman to come flying along and make it all better"" (Two stars only for the nicely contrasting visuals and the different camera angles) **My personal opinion on drug addicts: I fully agree with General Salazar. If there is one thing this movie conveys right, its that there is no point in rehabilitating or redeeming addicts. They are scum who have messed up their lives all on their own. Nobody held a gun to their head and told them to get high. Let them go to hell. That's what I think anyway.",993600000,5,3174,4.599647266313933

I was impressed with Benicio Del Toro, who pulled off his most subtle performance yet.
He should have gotten the Oscar for his role in ""Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas"" rather than for this movie.
Catherine Zeta-Jones was exceptional in her role, which in my opinion was the most interesting character in the movie.

THese people just don't understand how important a movie like this is. Even though it plays like a documentary in some parts (especially the mexican american border scenes) it is an even better way of showing what a problem drugs have given the world. This movie also had great camera work (I'm a sucker for that)that definetly gave a gritty feel to mexico.  So don't listen to the one and two star reviews.

1288542,4,B00003CXN4,"Had Traffic stuck to the storylines about Mexico and the Ayala arrest/trial, it would have been a modern classic.  Benicio Del Toro is nothing short of spectacular, and was well-deserving of his Oscar, and the interplay between the Feds monitoring Ayala's wife is very funny and believable.  Unfortunately, the filmmakers decided to go ""big picture"", too, so we get the very weak Michael Douglas drug czar subplot.  Although it too has its moments (the scene where the boy o.d.s is very believable, particularly the profuse sweeting and feeling hot that proceeded it, and the tear in the eye of Douglas's daughter when she first freebases is a nice touch), the overall tone of this part of the film is a bit preachy.  The Douglas subplot also contains the two biggest flaws in the movie - the speed with which Douglas's daughter turns into a drug-crazed prostitute, and the totally unbelievable scene where Douglas resigns right in the middle of his first press conference (although I like the line, ""...I don't know how you wage war on your family."")  Still, this is a good, not great movie, and the DVD is pretty much along the same lines - some nice special features, but nothing that blows you away.  Recommended, but there are other DVDs you should own first.",993427200,,1264,4.8018433179723505

Seldom, can you say a movie's soundtrack is like the roof, protecting it if anything caves in, and the soundtrack does just that. From the soothing cord music, to the heart thumping techno beats. This soundtrack is amazing, and should be owned even if you haven't seen the movie, and when you put a awsome movie, with great background, thats instant victory over anybody who sees the movies heart. Then, for the walls, we have the beautifull camera and color techniques, that should be used in every movie. Our awsome director, had the brilliance to put colors, not just backgrounds, but colores in the backgrounds, sometimes maybye to strong, but still very good adition. He often uses these to show emotion, and n'sync with the soundtrack, wich makes it that much better. Example you ask? Sure, the scenes in mexico where everything has a tint of yellow? Haza, we have a dusty landscape that feels slightly corrupt. Heck, i doubt we need actors when colors can potray these. Well, i feel iv filled my space, so I hope youll go out and see/rent if not buy this spectaculare movie, sure to be the equial to movies such as.....

1288545,4,B00003CXN4,"the original five hour BBC mini series into approximately 21/2 hours.  Unfortunately this was accomplished at the expense of character development and lack of logic.  The complete metamorphosis of the Zeta-Jones character from dependant housewife (albeit upperscale socially) to a ruthless, conniving, avenging ""angel"" was done too quickly without any time or subtlety allowed to lend at least a modicum of  credence to the transformation.  All in all, however, it was a very respectable film--well acted and produced. The source from which the plot was taken (BBC Series) was infinitely superior and was superbly acted.  Bill Paterson (in the Douglas role) and Lindsay Duncan (Zeta-Jones) were especially effective.  Duncan was positively chilling.  The film, however, is definitely worth seeing and certainly a lot more adult and satisfying than most Hollywood action flicks.  It's obvious that all concerned respected the source material and tried (and mostly succeeded) to present a quality film, esp considering it had to fit into a time frame that most film goers would accept.

I think-okay, KNOW, that Soderbergh is one of the most thoughtful and intuitive directors of our time. And for someone like me, who uses dvds as a film school of sorts, I found this greatly disappointing. It's a walk inside Soderbergh's brain that I didn't get to take...

1288591,4,B00003CXN4,"Traffic is about America's obsession of the drug war. The movie has three different stories. A Ohio supreme court justice (Douglas) is appointed the position of ""drug czar"" and oversees the operations of eliminating the Mexican cartels. Only to find out that his honor student daughter is a coke addict. Overtime his daughter falls into the world of addiction. In Mexico, a proud police officer (Del Toro) is confronted daily with the corruption of his fellow officers. Alone he tries to infilrate and bring down the cartels. And finally a wealthy socialite (Zeta Jones) in San Diego watches in horror as her husband arrested for selling drugs. For all the time she's been married to him she hasn't been aware of shady business. In these hard times she becomes desparate and will do anything to preserve her lifesytle. The director of the movie did an excellent job of blending in the stories. I was also impressed with the use of different color shades throught out the movie.
I've heard criticism about the movie being ""pro drug"" and it was typical of the Hollywood left. I disagree, the movie takes a different look at the war on drugs through the eyes of the various characters. Douglas's character comes to the conclusion that he can't win the war when he's losing the battle at home with his daughter.

As the drug war ever so closely resembles the mileue of Vietnam, Traffic offers a much needed and fresh perspective with regards to US drug policy.  Traffic takes a pessimistic view towords the drug war in general; a view point that some americans share but one that is often ingored.  Regardless of one's viewpoint, director Steven Soterbergh is at the top of his game.  Traffic can be seen both as an important time piece and also for its cinimatic success.  As a collage of three stories, Traffic's message is applicaplbe to all facits of society.",992822400,,605,4.714285714285714
1288593,4,B00003CXN4,"Traffic is easily one of the most socially important movies in recent memory, and probably the most most significant major Hollywood production since, well, uh...quite a while.
In fact, that this was a major Holywood release is in itself a reason Traffic is so important.  This film marks a moment in time when Hollywood believes that mainstream America is willing to hear the message that maybe the war on drugs is not all it's cracked up to be.  And to the extent that this message comes through, one can forgive it for not going farther.  Even a baby step can be monumental.
Traffic is also a pretty damn good movie, all told.  The cinematography is awe-inspiring, and the film features many excellent performances (most obviously Benicio del Toro, but Don Cheadle and Catherine Zeta-Jones also turn in fine showings).  Although Traffic is prone to moments of melodrama, the story itself is generally gripping and well put together.
Overall, although the ""drugs are bad...mmmkay?"" message is somewhat annoying (I don't endorse drug use, but I don't exactly condemn it or discourage it either), I acknowlege its necessity if you are going to make a movie that ultimately condemns the war on drugs.

While all of the acting is superb, perhaps the most gripping is that of Zeta-Jones.  The change in her situation as the movie progresses pulls you in and you may as well be watching a documentary of the neighbor down the street.  Michael Douglas and family come off well, certainly not over the top as could have happened with lesser direction.  However good the acting in that angle of the movie, I felt that the coincidence of his ascension to US drug czar as his daughter becomes an addict was simply too convenient.  While it makes for a great contrast, I didn't buy into it.  Del Toro, as you have heard by know, ie the Oscar nomination, is remarkable, despite the fact that much of his dialogue is en espanol.  The movie launches with his character and the story is initially purposefully ambiguous, the more reason to keep watching.  Even non-technically-minded movie goers will be blown away when they learn that the entire movie was photographed by the director.  This movie amply demonstrates that gripping stories and realistic screenplays lead to memorable movies, not huge budgets, cheesy effects and bland actors.

1288596,5,B00003CXN4,"Steven Soderbergh has crafted a visually stunning, deeply moving and intensely brilliant movie in Traffic.  The central focus of the film is the drug epidemic in the US and Mexico.  He tells three separate stories that are each distinct unto themselves, yet interwoven into a common thread.  One story takes place in Mexico and revolves around a cop with a conscious (Benecio Del Toro), the second story takes place in Ohio and Washington and involves the country's new drug czar (Michael Douglas) and the troubles he faces on the job and with his daughter (Ericka Christiansen) who freebases cocaine and descends into a drug addicted hell and the third story takes place in San Diego and involves DEA agents (Don Cheadle & Luis Guzman) trying to take down a big drug trafficker (Stephen Bauer) whose wife (Catherine Zeta-Jones) learns the drug trade while he's detained.  The film sounds unwielding, but Mr. Soderbergh deftly maneuvers from story to story and you find yourself engrossed in the lives of these characters.  Each story is shot in a different style with the Mexico scenes being bright but grainy, the Ohio & Washington scenes in a moody indigo and the San Diego scenes in a sunny, vivid illumination.  The cast is full of amazing performances with Mr. Del Toro standing out as the Mexican cop.  Most of his dialogue is in Spanish, but it is his expressions that speak volumes.  When the camera focuses in on his face, he conveys a sense of a man with the weight of the world on his shoulders.  Mr. Del Toro won a well deserved Best Supporting Actor Oscar in 2000.  Miguel Ferrer is superb as a key witness in the San Diego case who bristles at the DEA agents and offers a chilling description of the drug situation in the country.  Mr. Cheadle is fiery as a DEA agent and Mr. Douglas perfectly portrays a man who is trying fight a national war on drugs but is losing a battle at home.  Ms. Christiansen is amazing and her descent into complete addiction is frightenly real.  The cast is expansive and includes such stars as Albert Finney, Dennis Quaid, Benjamin Bratt, Selma Hayek and Topher Grace in addition to the others.  Mr. Soderbergh had a great 2000 with Traffic and Erin Brockovich and he became the first director in sixty years to be nominated for two movies in the same year and he won the Best Director award for this film.",992476800,20,2351,4.661016949152542

My only problem with the movie was the story line centered around Catherine Zeta-Jones - wasn't sure why it was there.

The third story concerns a wealthy businessman who is arrested on drug charges while his wife is totally oblivious to the real source of their wealth.  She seems helpless at first, but her survival instinct causes her to learn quickly about how to deal with the world of drugs.

1288680,4,B00003CXN4,"Traffic follows the effective, but not-so-often utilized method of crossing over many stories into one central theme. Another movie for reference may be Magnolia. It is a presentation about the institution, effect, and battle against drugs.
On one side you have an unknowing wife (Catherine Zeta-Jones) who must take over a drug empire once her husband (candidly played by Steven Bauer) is indicted on trafficking charges. On the other, is the newly appointed ""drug czar"" (Michael Douglas), who attempts to ""go to the front"" and attack the enigmatic problem of curbing the demand for drugs in the U.S. Interestingly, all the while, his daughter (a straight A student with a seemingly bright future) is falling victim to her own battle with drugs.
The story does not stop there. Perhaps the most provocative, though hardest-to-follow aspect, is the corruption that befalls Benicio Del Toro's character, Javier Rodriguez. He brilliantly plays a common Tijuana cop who discovers an army-run drug ring, and throughout the movie, internally battles with himself about whether or not he should share his knowledge with the D.E.A. in the States, all the while fearing for his life in the process.
Although the Mexico sequences seem at first not to correlate with the rest of the movie, and the subtitles are difficult to follow (the only movie with subtitles that I really enjoy is Seven Samurai), it is Del Toro's performance and the fate of his character that make you want to watch. Put another way, he is not the reason I went to see the movie in the theaters, but he was the reason I stayed. And although it might be crude to say that the whole movie's credibility falls on him, Del Toro was defintely deserving of the Best Supporting Actor Oscar he won for this role.
The movie itself attempts to approach the ""drug issue"" from an objective standpoint, and for the most part it does. There are times when the script is lagging, but that tends to appear in many movies. I would rate this movie at 4.5 stars, leaving only the landmark films to become 5s. For an interesting, thought-provoking film go see this movie.",992304000,,2113,4.85595567867036

 As if it were not enough, a cast full of stars brings the movie to a totally different level: Mr. Michael Douglas (is there anything else that has not been already said about him); his lovely wife, Catherine Zeta-Jones, who happened to be beautifully pregnant in real-life during the movie; Benicio del Toro, who FINALLY became recognized as he should have, after roles as great as he played in 'Usual Suspects', 'Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas' and, more recently, 'Snatch'; and others.

Director Steven soderbergh and screenwriter Stephen Gaghan created a masterpiece when they made this film. I had not seen a film like that before, especially with the type of filmmaking that Soderbergh used in each of the three stories that were in the film and the way it showed the butal reality of how drugs can affect anyone. Now, moving on to why I only gave the film's DVD four instead of five stars. I gave this DVD this many stars because I am very disappointed with the extras on it. There is only the Theatrical and Teaser trailers, the TV spots, about a 15 minute behind the scenes feature and a photo gallery. That's all. Where are the commentary tracks or the deleted scenes? I guess director Steven Soderbergh is busy shooting his other film ""Oceans Eleven"" so it tis understandable that he may not have had time to put these extras on, but it still would have been nice to have those extras. But still, if you liked the film definitely buy the DVD because the movie is worth every penny.",992217600,,1251,4.373390557939914
1288683,5,B00003CXN4,"Benicio Del Toro gives an amazing performance in this film about the war against drugs.  I usually do not enjoy movies in which the story jumps back and forth between characters, but this film works.  The movie is engrossing from start to finish, especially the final shot which I think is a great way to end the movie.  I highly recommend Traffic!",992217600,,348,4.580645161290323
1288684,3,B00003CXN4,"""Traffic"" is controversial because it seems to suggest that the war on drugs has been lost and ought to be given up.  However, whether you agree with that position or not, you'll be distracted by the fact that the message is not conveyed all that well.  Though well acted and with camera work that immediately captures the attention, ""Traffic"" ultimately encounters heavy congestion in trying to get where it wants to go.
The film is an ensemble picture broken essentially into three parts.  The first follows an honest Mexican policeman and his partner as they become involved with a shady Mexican general who has taken sides in a drug feud for both fun and profit.  This is the best of the three stories, though its ending seems a little too pat.  The second story involves the wife of a ""respectable"" drug smuggler and her travails after her husband's arrest.  This episode plays like your average episode of ""Law and Order"" and is as about as predictable.  The third story follows newly appointed drug czar Michael Douglas and his addicted daughter.  This episode rings phony and implausible in a number of ways.  Douglas's daughter goes from being casual weekend user to selling her body in a crack house in just a manner of weeks.  Then a few weeks later she's already spilling her guts at an ""AA"" Meeting.  This portrayal is so cliche as to almost be demeaning to what real recovering addicts go through.
Overall, ""Traffic"" is an overambitious failure.  I happen to agree with its message, but I thought the message was very much garbled in the translation.  In no way did it deserve a ""Best Picture"" nomination.",992131200,12,1619,4.759856630824372
1288685,4,B00003CXN4,"I watched this the same week as I watched ""Requiem for a Dream"". What a brutal week!
Everyone by now knows what ""Traffic"" is about. No need to rehash that. But the message it gives, that the so-called war on drugs is a failure, is one that we all need to listen to. This movie somewhat proves that point.
""Traffic"" shows us why this war is a failure but does not offer solutions. It also underscores the many kinds of dependencies, not just illegal drugs, that our society approves of: the nightly scotch, the wine with lunch, the cigarettes.
The casting was very good in this movie. Some characters were evil personified, others, like Ms. Zeta Jones, grew into their evil. The four stories jumped back and forth a little too fast for me - this did not allow time for any reflection before the next segment appeared. I did, however, like the way the film quality changed with the different stories.
I do wish that the movie had been a bit more forceful in its demonstration of why the drug ""war"" is failing and that it had offered some ideas for how we need to deal with addicts (better treatment, use of ""drug courts"", etc).
If it opened some eyes and started some dialogue, however, I guess we can consider this film a success.",992131200,,1229,4.466666666666667
1288686,2,B00003CXN4,"The movie, as it is, was pretty decent.  Most of it will seem familiar to people who have taken in such classics as the French Connection and Scarface (Al Pacino, not the really old one), and the movie offers little that's new to the mix.  The acting is very strong from everyone involved, but sometimes the movie jumped too quickly from each of the different stories and characters leaving me a little confused, especially with Del Toro's Mexican setting, where the plot seemed pretty intricate and complicated.  Still, I can't fault the movie too badly. This review is more about the DVD, which is inexcusably poor.  The picture and sound are sharp, but the fact is, this is the first of at least two DVDs.  The next one will no doubt be a Special Edition of some sort, featuring commentary and deleted scenes, interviews, etc.  This edition has almost nothing in those areas, so why waste your money?  A far superior edition is no doubt a few months away, I wouldn't even be surprised to see it by this holiday season, although if not then, no doubt soon after.  Save your money, rent this DVD, buy the next one.  Mark my words, studios do this all the time, and Soderbergh is too busy on his current movie, Ocean's Eleven, to supervise the creation of the special edition of this DVD right now, so expect it after Ocean's Eleven wraps.",992044800,,1339,4.569037656903766

Multiple plots occur simultaneously while the film uses technical tricks like showing scenes at accelerated paces for emphasis, creating a blurry and hyper effect, adding to the drama.  The one complaint I would make is that the speed sometimes made me dizzy, as well as making it challenging to focus on the plot rather than the cinematography.  The primary plots of Douglas as a politician and Zeta-Jones as the wife of an arrested Cartel member from Mexico bring a human dimension to what would otherwise be a copycat version of Hollywood's drug movie stereotype by bringing to light the effects of drugs on their families.  I saw it on DVD, but I'd recommend it in a theater or on a wide screen TV.  I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.",992044800,,844,4.833333333333333

It tries to bring up layers of different story lines , as if you were to expect all of it will somehow come together at the end , instead you get a feeling of total disintegration ( maybe this is what is Soderbergh and his Oscar winning film editor are trying to accomplish). Too many characters wandering aimlessly in todays America. As  to the  screenplay , it is limited  to 4 letter word exchanges between the Drug Czar and his thespian daughter. The acting is horrible, Micheal Douglas can't utter his lines , the supporting characters are either stereotypical or miscast. As to the decision to film the mexican scenes in this sort of yellow haze , I find that as a strategy to hide the directorial weaknesses , and has this racist tone about it , as if real ""Life""  is only lived this  side of the border. Some people have compared this to ""The Grandfather"" movies , it would be an insult to the viewer's intelligence. Finally a word about the character od Catherine Zeta-Jones , the film leaves as clueless as to how a pregnant caring mother suddenly develops a criminal and murderous streak. The best point of the movie is that in  The war on drugs , the  enemy is Within , it offers no advice , but hey you can always ""Just say no""!",992044800,,1325,4.2971887550200805

Del Toro turns in a solid performance, as does the rest of the cast. No one does ensemble casting like Soderbergh these days. The only weak point to the film, in my opinion, is the story line with the new drug czar's daughter. In a sense, it is the heart of the film. But it also occassionally smells of old morality tales, and I find myself having to overcome my distaste for those. It just seems too conveniently ""horrible.""

As for the DVD : Disappointing extras. Usually Soderbergh DVD's have a nice helping of extras and special features. ""Out of Sight"" and ""The Limey"" are jam-packed. This DVD has a rather dull ""Making of..."". No commentary, no deleted scenes. I expected more, and there should have been more.

Overall - It's a film worth having. But give the DVD a second thought before you buy it.....",991958400,,943,4.508771929824562
1288771,3,B00003CXN4,"Movie Summary:  There is a drug war going on. At times it seems both hopeless and pointless. This story follows three separate yet related plots lines. One involves the appointment of a new drug czar for the war on drugs in the United States. He struggles with  both his new job and the drug addiction of his own daughter. Another follows the case of an arrested American drug lord, the struggles his wife goes through to try to save their lifestyle, and the police officers that are trying to protect the main witness. The last one involves an honest Mexican police officer that has a very hard time doing the right thing.
My Opinion:  This movie is very well done in every way. Benicio Del Toro gives an awesome performance. The story is gripping and interesting. But even with all this, it just didn't excite me or stay with me. One of the main themes is that the war on drugs or war over drugs can be both pointless and hopeless yet it goes on. So it does. And I didn't care. The melding of the three separate plot lines is very similar to Magnolia and is very well done. At times, Traffic seems to be more of a documentary than a movie.
DVD Quality:  Widescreen anamorphic. Extras include the trailer, photo gallery and making of documentary. A good quality standard release.
What You Should Do:  Rent it if you liked the format of movies like Magnolia. You may like it enough to own, but you should check it out first.",991958400,,1424,4.440613026819923

It was like someone got a hold of a bad movie of the week mini series and decided to put it in a feature film.  The transparent efforts to make this movie""artsy"" were a TOTAL waste and just made the movie look worse than it all ready did.  This movie was truly unsurprising and I could have probably told you the end by the middle.  It was TRULY a WASTE of my time.  PLEASE DON'T EVEN RENT THIS MOVIE!!!

What makes this movie work?  It's not all about Hollywood glory and it actuallt tells a story.  The three separate color schemes that separate subplots work with mastery.  This is a great movie to own.

1288775,5,B00003CXN4,"Steven Soderbergh's film about the war on drugs goes above and beyond a good film. It starts out in Mexico. Two cops Javier Rodriguez Rodriguez (Benicio Del Toro) and Manolo Sanchez (Jacob Vargas) sit in their car waiting for a shipment of drugs. After confrunting the suspected drug transporters. General Salazar (Tomas Milian) rides in and takes all the credit. However he would like to talk with Rodriguez sometime, so he can help him fight the war against the cocaine cartels. But the cartels seem to be unbeatable!  Later the film shifts to Robert Wakefield (Michael Douglas) who is the Ohio Supreme Court Justice. Wakefield has just been selected by the President to take over as the U.S. drug czar. But the real enemy is his daughter Caroline (Erika Christensen) who likes to get high with her friends (mainly) Seth Abrahms (Topher Grace)at any spare moment. Caroline quickly becomes a drug addict.  Last but not least we go to San Diego. Here two DEA undercover cops Montel Gordon (Don Cheadle) and Ray Castro (Luis Guzman) are trying to put the stick to Eduardo Ruiz (Miguel Ferrer) who is the key witness in bringing down Carlos Ayala (Steven Bauer)who is a wealthy man. Who can be put away by Ruiz. But Carlos pregnant wife, Helena (Catherine Zeta-Jones) quickly adapts after a brief shock to her husbands ""second job"" by taking over while he is in jail. So she can save their business and way of life.  Soderbergh's film shows that crime is a huge business, and to get wrapped up into it is easier, than to get out! There is someone out there that wants the drug and will do what it takes to get it. In return the drug-lords get more powerful and will not let anything stop them to get there product onto the market.

Then I looked at the time and discovered that the movie was 2 hours and 20 minutes.  This is a great movie.  Douglas is at the top of his acting.  There are a lot of people in this movie, there are different stories about different families, but it is easy to keep track of all of them, and get lost in the middle.

I was very interested in this movie solely for the purpose of seeing the newly-wed Douglas and Zeta-Jones together, but surprisingly this had tons of superb actors including Dennis Quaid, Salma Hayek, and Miguel Ferrer.
I thoroughly enjoyed almost every minute of this movie.  It almost played like three documentaries on drugs, all woven together to create a stunning movie.  It was very moving to see how drugs effect everyone, to the naive drug-lord's wife, to the teens I see at school everyday.
I particularly do not care for Douglas, but I though he did a powerful job as a (typical) naive parent when it comes to their kids and drugs.  Zeta Jones was great too; it was shocking to see how powerful the effect the corruption of drugs had on her.  To see someone like her character lose everything to drugs, and then come crawling back to them as her way out was breath-taking.
Very good thought-provoking movie, by its end, you will have formed your opinion on drugs though; so be prepared.",991699200,,1113,4.836842105263158

Michael Douglas is an Ohio Supreme Court Judge who becomes the Drug Czar, America's Leader of the War on Drugs.  Finally, Catherine Zeta Jones is the wife of an accused drug Lord.
While the editing and direction is great, the acting is no less so.  All the actors turned in Stellar performances, but Benicios was by far the best.  HIs award for Best Supporting Actor was well deserved.
Finally, the story itself is timely and engaging without being preachy.  The end of the film makes you think about the war on drugs and how best to combat this problem without preaching to you.  Certainly deserving of it's nomination as Best Picture. The first thing you will notice is the different filters and film used for the various story lines.  The Mexican side of the story is shot in Super 8 and therefore quite grainy.  Michael Douglas' shots are done with a blue filter and Catherine Jones' shots are more golden.  I loved this technique not just cause it was different but it added to the telling of the story.

1288836,5,B00003CXN4,"With this movie and Erin Brockovich, Stephen Soderbergh has ushered himself into the hall of great modern filmmakers.  Steven Spielberg isn't the only guy who can make socially aware and responsible films!
I appreciated this movie on many levels, but there are a few things that are most notable about this movie:  1. the acting, specifically that of Benicio Del Toro (who is FINALLY getting the recognition he deserves), 2. the filming, which is very interesting and surprisingly indie for such a high-profile film, 3. the scope, it has a huge cast and many subplots, and 4. the subject, drug trafficking, which was treated with brutal honesty and stark realism.  The script, written by Stephen Gaghan, was complicated, vast, and never took the easy way out.  Consequently, the film had an importance and gravity that I haven't seen since Schindler's List.
If you haven't seen this movie, but have heard about it, don't expect it to be easy to watch.  It isn't.  It's a beautiful masterpiece that is as terrible as it is great.  It was most definitely the greatest movie of 2000, and Stephen Soderbergh is destined to be one of the new century's most important filmmakers.",991612800,2,1173,4.893939393939394
1288837,5,B00003CXN4,"Traffic is without a doubt--the best movie released in 2000(maybe tied with The Way Of The Gun). It's epic in scope, but small when it comes to the action on screen. Traffic focuses on 3 main plots with 1 sub plot. Each one more than capable of carrying the movie. I won't go into details of the plot though. The film is told thru many ways. The gritty, dirty feel of Tijuana, the icy cold Cincinatti, and the sun bleached San Diego are all represented with expert-like usage of filters and pacing. Tijuana is fast moving and with very little down time. Concinatti is paced a bit slow, but with lots of surprises. San Diego is relaxed and the editing is smooth. The actors all turn in great performances, rarely does an ensemble cast do this great of work. Benicio Del Toro is just outstanding as Javier Rodriguez. Michael Douglas seems a bit tepid during some scenes, but is overall damn good. Catherine Zeta Jones is a capable actress and it shows. What really deserves recongition is Luiz Guzman and Don Cheadle. Incredible actors that worked together with PT Anderson on Boogie Nights and their chemistry on screen is amazing. Watching this movie isn't a movie experience. It's more like these characters let a camera guy film their lives.
As a dvd though it's horrible. No extras to speak of. Just a few trailers. This movie deserves a Fight Club presentation on dvd.\
What happens in the movie isn't really a shock. Some might even feel a bit let down about what happens. It's all part of Steven Soderbergh's game. You can try your damnest to stop the drug trade, but you'll rarely put in a dent. Theres parts with Michael Douglas' character near the end dealing with his freebase lovin' daughter feels too hollywood.

In this film, the director sets the stage for brightly portraying a fast-moving convoluted tale of ""good guys"" (FBI, ATF, DEA et al) v. the ""bad guys,"" a competing pair of drug cartels in Mexico.  The director should get five stars, but the film gets two stars because the plot is stale and the story seems to focus on image building of our Federal Agencies.
  This strikes me as a modern day knock-off of the TV series about the FBI, which ran in the 1950's, starring Ephram Zimbalist Jr.  It was extremely popular back then, assuring the public they should fear no evil just so long as the FBI was in charge.  It stayed that way until one day (long into the series) the public learned that each and every episode was personally approved by the Director of the FBI --- the man himself --- J. Edgar Hoover.  If I recall correctly, it was said that Hoover actually hand picked Zimbalist Jr., as the starring lead.  Hello......  since when do the feds control content?

But I didn't find the overall plot very compelling and the film itself isn't really very entertaining.  Traffic is a great movie for showing the viewer ""this is the way things are"" (from a totally pessimistic point of view) but when it comes to powerful storytelling, it lacks.  One reason for this is the fact that there are many stories all going on at once, and the characters in each of these stories have their own conflicts to resolve.  But the film shifts its attention from one to the other much too often and it seems that none of them have enough time or description to really set in with the viewer.  It seems more like each one is given a cursory, impersonal overview which at the end doesn't really leave any lasting effect on the audience.  The cast did a fine job with their roles, but none of them really had to do much to challenge or showcase their utmost abilities as performers.  Most of the conflicts aren't truly resolved at the end, but the film seems very preachy throughout its course on how pointless the war on drugs is.  This is what seems like the overall message.  Although Traffic comes out to be a good look into a contemporary problem that our society faces, it cannot stand on its own as a great work of motion picture storytelling.

A film with these power house stars all traveling along on a highway giving witty commentary would have been right up my alley. But alas I was foiled into a great experience none the less. Who could have guessed this film was about the drug trade?? It gives an incredible insight into all facets of the drug trade, letting us see it from everyone's point of view. Asking tough questions of whether the drug war is one that should even be fought, or if the lives it saves are small in comparison to the lives taken to fight it. Then it swings around and shows the true devastation drugs can cause, making for a great theatrical ride. Also, I can't wait to get to Mexico. Cuban cigars and that totally funky lighting down there totally rocks. And Michael Douglas was forced to be with a woman his age, while his real life wife is hit on by Dennis Quaid. The one thing this film was missing was a totally hot chick. No offense to Mr. Zeta-Jones Douglas, but she was pregnant and average looking at best. I mean a top notch super hottie, Shannon Elizabeth for example. Not really to add to the movie, she could just walk around nude mostly, just for our pleasure. I have expressed this idea to George Lucas for the upcoming Star Wars film, and he said ""Genius."" but he is not sure he can get it done. Finally, I just gotta give mad props to the That 70's Show star, Topher Grace. He plays the quintessential teen upper-class drug head, but he lets slip some of the movies most idiomatic lines. He has a way of commanding a serious sense of presence even when he is in all reality a punk rich kid. While not what I was hoping for, this film still succeeded on many levels.

1288995,5,B00003CXN4,"It must have been hard to show the complexities of the world of drugs and drugs trafficking without wimping out and coming around to simplistic generalities and easy solutions. One strength of this film is that it doesn't reveal any one answer to the problem of drugs. What it does do is show the difficulty in enforcing the law and keeping tabs on drug users and sellers. It also shows how even those who consider themselves untouchable (like the U.S Drug Czar, played with admirable restraint by Michael Douglas) are just as vulnerable as those who seem easier prey for the drug pushers. When Douglas's daughter slowly becomes addicted to drugs, for instance, he doesn't find out until it is almost too late.  There is so much fine acting in this movie that I'd be hard-pressed to choose one performance as being better than another.  Benicio Del Toro gives the performance of his career and, Catherine Zeta-Jones is absolutely superb as a drug lord's wife forced to cope with the threat of financial ruin when her husband is suddenly imprisoned. Her obvious pregnancy makes her seem especially vulnerable, especially desperate for security. There are few truly moral or idealistic characters in this movie but I found myself rooting for many of them, anyway.

1288996,5,B00003CXN4,"""Traffic,"" directed by Steven Soderbergh, is an ambitious film that takes on an important subject: the phenomenon of illegal drugs in the United States. Steven Gaghan's intelligent script weaves together several interlocking stories that take us from the Mexican border to the halls of power in Washington, DC. We see the newly appointed U.S. ""drug czar"" dealing with political bigwigs; we accompany a conflicted Mexican cop as he encounters greed and corruption; we witness the personal suffering of a young addict. These and many other characters give us glimpses of a vast and controversy-ridden tapestry; their stories are further enhanced by some of the year's most striking cinematography.
In addition to the fine direction and screenwriting, this film is graced with many excellent performances by a very large ensemble cast. Don Cheadle and Luis Guzman, as a pair of U.S. agents, have some of the best screen chemistry I've ever seen; their relationship forms an important emotional touchstone in the film. Benicio Del Toro gives a superb performance (mostly in Spanish, with English subtitles) as the weary Mexican cop. Catherine Zeta-Jones is absolutely chilling as the amoral, materialistic wife of a major drug trafficker. But in my opinion, the film's finest moments belong to Michael Douglas as the chief of U.S. drug policy. He hauntingly portrays the determination and inner pain of a man who is fighting a war on two devastating fronts.
Some of the characters and situations may seem a bit familiar, but in my opinion these archetypes give the film the flavor of a modern morality play. Ultimately, Soderbergh and Gaghan do an outstanding job of tying together the large cast and interconnected storylines. ""Traffic"" has the feel of an epic, but it is an epic that is always in touch with each character at an intimate level.",991180800,3,1842,5.122923588039867

1288999,4,B00003CXN4,"With its frank depiction of drug use and its gritty down to earth feel, I enjoyed Traffic and expect to see director Steven  Soderbergh walk away with an Oscar come Academy Award time.
  There were 5 or 6 different story lines, a few of which came together at different points. One involved Michael Douglas  as Robert Wakefield, an Ohio State Supreme Court Justice turned United States Drug Czar having to deal with not only  the national and international drug problem, but with the fact that his 16 year old daughter was a drug addict. Another  story line involved Benecio Del Toro as Tijuana police officer Javier Rodriguez caught between the corrupt Mexican  police system, and his moral obligation to make Mexico drug free for future generations. Another story line had Catherine  Zeta-Jones as Helena, an unsuspecting wife of a suspected drug dealer named Carlos Ayala (Steven Bauer), having to  cope with her husband being carted off to jail, and having her child threatened unless she pays off her husband's debts.  Mixed into that story line were undercover DEA agents Montel Gordon (Don Cheadle) and Ray Castro (Luis Guzman)  who are trying to protect the chief witness again Carlos, while trying to get information against Helena.
  What I really loved about Traffic was the documentary-style feel it had. Every location was shot differently, from the  blown out yellow grittyness of Mexico, to the rich upper class color of Cincinnati. Along with the graphic depictions of  drug use and the corruption of the Mexican military and police, it all had the feel of a real life drama, and not just a movie.  All the acting performances were wonderful. Usually a great director can bring out great performances from his/her cast.  It's no surprise that Julia Roberts from the Soderbergh-directed Erin Brockovich is a front runner in the Best Actress  Oscar race, and Benecio Del Toro is a front runner in the Supporting Actor race. Standouts from this movie in my view  include Zeta-Jones as a woman who is slowly transformed into the complete opposite of what she was by circumstances  beyond her control. Don Cheadle, who is one of the best hidden talents in Hollywood, and is just one big role away from  breaking through to mainstream. And the girl I thought had the toughest role in the movie, Erika Christensen as Caroline,  the 16 year old drug addicted daughter of the new drug Czar. I think her performance deserves more recognition than it's  gotten.
  The feel of the movie is really what makes this film a cut above others. It doesn't pull any punches in its portrayal of what  life is like for some people. We get to see the inner workings of a corrupt Mexican military, abusing its police power to  steal the lucrative drug trade for itself. We see how even if a police officer is on the moral straight and narrow, he has to  bend to the facts of life to survive on the streets. Back in America we see that even the drug Czar of the United States can  have problems in his own life that are bigger than the country. And we see how a woman will go anywhere and do  anything to protect her children and her family. Director Soderbergh has taken us inside the lives of these people without  glossing it up Hollywood style.
  Traffic is a hard hitting film that may be too much for some people. The scenes of drug use are hard to deal with at times.  Seeing what a 16 year old girl will do just to get a fix is troubling. The only part of the film I guess I didn't believe(?) was  watching the drug Czar comb the streets looking for his daughter, instead of calling out the National Guard or something  to track her down. I understand he had his reasons, wanting to keep the whole situation quiet and away from the press,  but it still seemed odd that a person in his position would be willing to wander the streets looking for her. The other  problem I had was that some of the story lines and people got confusing to me, and made parts of the movie hard to  follow. Luckily most of it all came together near the end.
  Overall I enjoyed Traffic and I would recommend it to people looking to get out of the Hollywood-style movie scene  we're all used to seeing.",990576000,8,4178,4.598105548037889

1289035,5,B00003CXN4,"This is an effervescent mix of contemporary nomenclature and effortless acting at the hands of gifted autuer Benecio del Toro. Leading the star struck cast is husband-wife Vaudeville ensemble Michael Douglas and Catherine Zeta-Jones. Indeed, this movie is a flaming tribute to the botched debacle of drug-fighting, American style. Douglas' character Robert Wakefield, shows stamina throughout the movie in his efforts to wrangle his drug injecting sex selling prepish daughter while trying to get much-coveted 'face time' with the President.
You can't help but wonder if Jones' character's husband had worse legal counsel, would he have done to jail and his shrewd, covetus assistant take over the business? Interesting query, eh? No, just a bit of sloppy scriptwriting in an otherwise fine piece. Indeed the drama played out in California was remarkable with Zeta-Jone's character trying to maintain a high society image all the while playing the role of the unsuspecting drama queen.  I'm sure her fellow school board members are all in a tizzy...
In sum, this movie demonstrates excellent screenplay, and snappy cinematagraphy. Those reviewers who show a distaste for the Spanish dialogue would do well to watch a 1970's Kung Fu movie over-dubbed in English...give me a break.

1289039,5,B00003CXN4,"TRAFFIC, helmed by Steven Soderbergh (OUT OF SIGHT) triumphs in its documentary narration of how drugs have devastated and rooted in America. The 3 simple stories are linked together, each offering different perspective on the critical issue. Benicio Del Toro plays sublimely to effect a Mexican cop who witnesses the death of his buddy to drug syndicate. The power of drugs lead to intense and volatile obsession and violence as greed reign even amongst the politcal kingdom in Mexico. Michael Douglas plays an American senator who has taken over the Drugs Office to raid out drug trafficking, only to ironically discover his daughter has been abusing drugs. Family conflicts and emotions run high in this story and the climax is shattering and most heart-rendering. Don Cheadle and Luis Guzman portray undercover cops who is on the chase for a drug lord and when he is arrested, Catherine Zeta Jones as his wife takes over his business to support their child.
TRAFFIC is in fact this year's most outstanding film in terms of direction and acting. The ensemble elevates the intense atmosphere with their seasoned acting and the direction gives it an exciting documentary vision which stimulates reality. The story-telling builds up with a climax and is acutely thought -provoking without preaching morals.

I went to the theater HOPING I'd like this movie. I'd been waiting a while to see it. Ultimately, the movie seemed like a 4 hour drug trip (no pun intended). It felt like you do at 2:00 in the morning, when your'e not sure what's real or not. I don't know if this was intentional or not; I doubt it.
Each location is shot with a different filter; Mexico is yellow, DC is blue, etc. Call it inventive, call it annoying, I didn't like it. It gave the movie a fake look to it (especially when it strives to be realistic).
My main problem is that it is not a good movie to sit down and watch. It is NOT entertaining. It probably does do a good job of protraying the world of drug traffic. And I do recommend it to anyone who takes drugs or wants to. This movie is too long, and there are hardly any characters to sympathize with besides Michael Douglas.

'Traffic' has a brilliant script, but its traumas are contained in implausible formal neatness, with some audience-pleasing concessions.  Soderbergh rejects this neatness, most obviously in the way his stark colour-coding - sepia monochrome for stereotypically sinister Mexico; 'normal' colour for 'normal' US - seeps its boundaries, the one messing up the other, just as the border between the two countries becomes a kind of fairy tale threshold; here the aims of 'reality' or 'realism' become impossible.

Facing all this difficulty she must do something fast, involving her husband's business.  All the stories are believable, and poignant.  The thing I liked about it was that even though the main characters met the same people, they never actually crossed paths.  The stories were predictable, but with drug movies telling basically the same story it is hard to not make it that way.  Even then it is pulled off nicely right before our eyes.  It shows what certain people do with the drug problem, but doesn't give an end all cure all to the problem.  I liked that and many other things about it.  It deserved Best Picture, Gladiator didn't.  Watch this beautiful movie, and you will be changed forever. Spend whatever it takes to obtain it.",987033600,2,1576,4.615107913669065
1289273,2,B00003CXN4,"""Traffic"" is an overlong, unnecessarily complicated movie that thinks it has something new to say about the 'war on drugs', but doesn't.  Those who criticize the Nancy Reagan ""Just say no"" mantra in favour of movies like this -- that ask a lot of questions but provide nary an answer -- are just kidding themselves into complacency.
Ostensibly an attack on the same story from four different viewpoints, I'd say only half of the action was relevant and necessary.
The Mexico scenes, roughly 90% in Spanish, survive mainly on the talents of its hulking lead, Benicio Del Toro.  He never does anything flashy or obvious, but ably shows his character's dilemma.  And his charisma is just enough to save the day, especially when surrounded by a crowd of two-dimensional villains.
The scenes featuring Don Cheadle and Luis Guzman are entertaining and surprisingly funny.  But they really have no place in this movie.  These two fine actors have wonderful chemistry together, but it feels like they have been spliced in from a low budget but finely written buddy movie.  I'm not against a little comic relief in the midst of a tense drama, but it just never seemed appropriate here.  Their clowning undermines the drama (In interviews, director Steven Soderbergh has floated the idea of shooting a prequel featuring these two; a better idea might have been scrapping ""Traffic"" altogether, and focusing on that instead).
The Catherine Zeta-Jones scenes are so mishandled that I don't know where to start.  First, the buzz on her character is that she quickly goes from being a sheltered innocent to a Machiavellian drug lord, because her situation demands it.  Thus bringing up a series of ethical questions and moral dilemmas.  I bought the sheltered innocent part, but the rest was just laughable.  A gradual transformation might've worked, but she falls so easily into the role vacated by her jailed husband that you have to question how much she really knew all along.  And on top of that, her mothering instincts seem to leave her completely.  After her son is threatened, the boy never again appears in the film.  Would a competent mother ever let him leave her side after that?  It is an odd choice, amplified by the fact that Jones lobbied hard to play the role while pregnant.  And don't get me started on the ineptness of Dennis Quaid's character, not to mention his acting.
Finally, we have the Michael Douglas scenes.  I knew this story would be awful the minute I saw his ridiculous hair.  It makes him look like an ignorant moron, and his actions in his new job as Drug Czar don't dispel that perception one bit.  The whole point of his character was to reveal that no matter how sheltered and mundane your life is, the drugs can find even you.  So his daughter gets high.  A lot.  And when she heads down to the bad part of town, well, our hero Mr. Douglas has to go find her (as if it's the job of the Drug Czar to clean up all the drugs by himself!).  At one point he transforms into an older and blander version of his fine vigilante character from ""Falling Down"".  I half expected him to get a buzz-cut and a pair of horn-rimmed glasses.  I'd like to say something about the characters of his daughter and his wife, but both were so insubstantial and cliched that there's really no point.
I liked Soderbergh's comeback film ""Out of Sight"", where he ably flipped back and forth through time and story (a technique used less effectively in his next film, ""The Limey"").  Here, he does pretty much the same thing, only not as extreme.  It doesn't work nearly as well.  And just because one character from one of the threads passes by on the street a character from another of the threads doesn't mean that everybody's life is intertwined.  I used to think that the connections linking the characters in ""Magnolia"" were the epitome of tenuous, but ""Traffic"" out does even that rambling mess (which leads me to believe that if you liked ""Magnolia"" -- I didn't -- you'll probably like ""Traffic"" too).  And Soderbergh's cinematography (credited as Peter Andrews), where he uses extreme colours to denote a change in geography, is intended to be artful, subtle, and symbolic.  It comes off, rather, as heavy handed and condescending to its audience.  We don't need colour coding to understand that we've gone from Mexico to Cincinnati (does he think we can't read his title cards?).
I realize that as of this writing, mine is the minority opinion.  Just understand that when a talented filmmaker like Soderbergh fails to fulfill the promise of a subject pregnant with possibilities, I feel we have to call him out on it.  Maybe he'll get it right next time.",986947200,5,4660,4.740694789081886

1289275,5,B00003CXN4,"This is the kind of movie that makes most other films pale by comparison. A virtuoso tour-de-force of what is so fantastic about great cinema. It pulls us in from the first few frames, and we are held in its intricate web until the very, very end. It's the kind of movie that makes you sit forward in your seat, just waiting to see what will happen next. It's watchable and enjoyable and interesting and good, but it's also disturbing, mainly in its gritty, no-holds barred realism. It is this realism, however, and Soderbergh's willingness to show the dark underbelly of the drug world, that makes the film so effective.
Traffic is made up of three simultaneous stories which intersect  and play off of each other to form a cohesive, multi-faceted picture of the war on drugs, and the realities of drug creation, trafficking, the criminal and law-enforcement side of drugs, as well as drug use and the ramifications of that use. Steven Soderbergh pulls a fine performance out of every single one of his actors in this film. From Benicio Del Toro, who turns in a fabulous, Oscar-winning performance as a  Mexican cop in a deadly Morality game which takes place on both sides of the border, to Michael Douglas, undoubtedly likable as a hero this time, in the role of a high-ranking Drug Enforcement Official in DC, to Catherine Zeta Jones as the pampered, unwitting wife of a drug czar in Southern California, the performances and storytelling here are flawless. Each of Soderbergh's three stars tells their story with honesty, revealing realistic ambivalence and the un-masked and mysterious imperfection of human nature. Each reveal true-to-life emotion as people caught between a rock and a hard place, with consciences and agendas at various points between. Other brilliant turns include indie favorite Don Cheadle as a law enforcement official, and the young, Julia Stiles-lookalike Erika Christensen, whose riveting, harrowing performance as the drug-addicted daughter of Douglas's character is one of the most effective 'threads' in the film. Speaking of threads, Traffic is like a patchwork quilt of sorts, with stories which intersect and come together to create a bigger, more accurate and compelling picture of one of our biggest major international problems. People pass each other unknowingly on the street, their stories happening simultaneously as in life, each person's actions rippling out to the broader sphere of this drug world, like the water in a pond. Blood is shed, lives are lost, dreams are destroyed, and new hope is born. This film definetely has the feel of a documentary, or at least a docudrama, which makes sense, because it was based on a European miniseries/documentary entitled ""Traffik."" It is compelling because watching the film, you know or are afraid to know that there is or there may be someone out there -- a smart, but cast aside teen perhaps, on the streets of your city, shooting up for the first time, falling under the spell of a drug's poison into homelessness and prositution and addiction, if not into the arms of death itself. In this film, as in life, there are coverups and bungled operations, lies, deception, and power games. There are also good people, people who are trying to make a difference, who sometimes can and sometimes die trying, or give up at the futility they feel when being faced with such a powerful renegade army of greed and carelessness.
Traffic is *excellent* on all levels: cinematography, directing, pacing, plot, acting... Soderbergh pulls all these things together and makes a water-tight, unsinkable ship of a movie. Disturbing, gripping, moving, engaging, flawless. Better than his other Oscar-winning film of the moment, Erin Brockovich. By a long shot. And that was a good movie. Five stars.",986860800,6,3775,5.0384
1289276,5,B00003CXN4,"I had went to theaters to see this movie. (Mainly because the previews said it was a knockout, brilliant, and in every critics top 10 list). I was a little skeptical at first, but once it starts it pulls you in. From begining to end, this film lacks nothing.
Whether you like it for the acting, (Don Cheadle, Benicio Del Torro, or Michael Douglas all do superb, along with most others), whether you like it for the cinematography, (I'm not sure who did it, but watch for the color difference between Washington, DC (Michael Douglas' scenes), Mexico (Benicio Del Torro's scenes), or San Diego (where a bunch of rich kids live), you will be amazed.
Another thing is the rock solid story line with snappy dialouge. And not to mention the allstar cast of Benicio Del Torro, (The ""Good"" Cop), Michael Douglas (Head of the DEA), Catherine Zeta-Jones (A Rich, Pampered, Housewife), Dennis Quaid (The Crooked Lawyer), Don Cheadle (Undercover Cop), along with numerous cameos from Selma Hayek, ect.
This film can not be beat. With A+ acting, story, and without a doubt the BEST cinematography ever! You cant afford to miss TRAFFIC.

1289277,4,B00003CXN4,"I saw this film in a theater in a Latin American country, in ""reverse"" from audiences in the States i.e. all the Mexico scenes without subtitles and the U.S. scenes subtitled in Spanish.  I was mesmerized by Benicio, who with his Latin/Slavic features (fabulous lips/eyebrows & eyes) did his best to mask his pretty Caribbean accent in Spanish.
Maybe I've lived in a Latin American country too long now, but, I felt afterwards that there was an overriding accusatory tone toward Latin American countries, that after all, really are just the ""messengers"" in the war on hard drugs. (Remember the old saying, Don't kill me, I'm just the messenger""?)  The real problem is the consumption of/demand for cocaine in so-called ""Developed Countries"" (yeah, ""Developed"", as in a developed taste for drugs.)  Why do so many people in the United States feel the need to self-medicate with hard drugs?  This is the bigger question, and out of the scope of the movie.
I felt extreme ""My Eyes Glaze Over"" boredom with practically all of the M. Douglas scenes, where ""suits"" speak Governmentese to address The Problem.  The drugged-out teenager group-scenes were similarly boring, pierced-navel gazing scenes, but the ""jumping"" camera worked here--like how one feels when one is buzzed and only catching snippets of surrounding conversations.  As far as the Zeta-Jones storyline, why couldn't we have seen her being the Boss of the Stateside Op for a while?  Now that would have made her character more interesting.
I loved Benicio's Zacatecas-looking character.  I didn't like the final scene with him though, the baseball scene.  I felt Soderbergh was saying;  ""Look, these Mexicans have stolen the youth and innocence of our young, white adolescents with their drugs, AND NOW THEY'RE STEALING OUR NATIONAL PASTIME!""

 Traffic is actually about it's characters. Many major players, who all have seperate lives and separate stories.

1289382,4,B00003CXN4,"2000 was a good year for director Steven Soderbergh. First was the entertaining ""Erin Brockovich"", then the tense, complicated, well-acted ""Traffic"", which was probably the best movie of last year and which won Soderbergh the Oscar for Best Director. The plot is constructed of five interlinking sets of people: a newly appointed American drug czar and his family, the Mexican drug cartel, two Tiajuana plainclothes men, a couple of U.S. wiretap specialists, and a wealthy San Diego family whose fortune is a little less than legitimate. Michael Douglas is the star, playing the drug czar who discovers that his teenage daughter (Erika Christensen) has been inhaling free base and is hooked. Don Cheadle and Luis Guzman are nicely paired as the eavesdroppers, and Steven Bauer and Catherine Zeta-Jones play the San Diego couple whose lives collapse when an informer names the husband as a leading importer=exporter of illegal drugs. Dennis Quaid,who gets over-the-title billing, is convincing in a small, unsympathetic role as their opportunistic lawyer. Ms Zeta-Jones' character is the most controversial, morphing from suburban mom to Lady Macbeth right before our eyes. But, of course, most of the attention has been focused on Benicio Del Toro as Javier Rodriguez Rodriguez, the Mexican cop whose loyalties are constantly being challenged. He deservedly won the Oscar, though in the wrong category. Because his character both opens and ends the story, and because he has (I think) more screen time than Douglas, he should have been nominated for Best Actor. Some of the movie's plot elements, particularly in the second half, don't work. The informer is obviously poisoned by a breakfast that is brought to him while his police escort is in the room. Why would they allow a stranger to serve food to a heavily-protected state witness? (The informer is played by Miguel Ferrer, the son of Jose Ferrer and Rosemary Clooney.) Also, I didn't believe the drug czar's aborted acceptance speech for a minute, and his daughter's return from the dead was too pat and painless. But the quiet conclusion, with Javier watching a baseball game, was effective, proving that Stephen Gaghan's screenplay (another Oscar) didn't need a bang-up ending to complete a forceful  story.",986256000,18,2267,5.210958904109589
1289383,5,B00003CXN4,"All of the great reviews, the Golden Globes, and the Oscars were nothing short of well-deserved in what is argueably the best film made in the past decade.  Steven Soderberg never fails to amaze motion picture-goers; and TRAFFIC is no exception.  The movie is set in multiple locations: Mexico, San Diego, Ohio, & Washington D.C. (for the most part)  These are the settings in which the main characters deal with what each of them has in common... drugs.  Some sell it, some take it, and some try to stop others from selling and taking it.  For the most part, the top-billed actors which portray the main characters never really interact in the film.  However, in many cases, they somehow effect eachother's lives with what each is doing.  As complicated as TRAFFIC may sound, it really isn't.  But it does demand your attention span the entire 2 hours and 20 minutes.  But not only does it demand that attention, it holds it for the entire length of the film.

1289385,4,B00003CXN4,"Drugs are what economists call ""demand inelastic"". Drugs will be sold, bought, smoked, sniffed, ingested and injected in great numbers, over an astonishingly wide price range. The Third World costs of plantation and delivery make for a most agreeable mark-up when sold at First World prices. Such a profitable enterprise, given the invisible hand of Laissez-faire, would attract ambitious prince-pins to the market, shifting the supply curve to the right (increasing the amount of drugs on the market, lowering the price and making drug dealing, economically, a less rewarding proposition.) So far so capitalist. But what if the whole enterprise were illegal; production and consumption? The price stays high, profit margins bloat, and addicts get fall into depressingly patterned methods of procuring the expensive product. Next time a government tries to help sugarcane farmers they should perhaps consider this novel idea: make sugarcane illegal.
This is, admittedly, a rudimentary assessment of the problem, possibly even wrong on some fundamental level (I don't want any e-mails from angry academics). But the hypothesis is not; drug wars in the first world, driven by narrow-minded moral elitism aggravate the problem. The villain makes the hero, and the drugs czar makes the kingpin. What makes Traffic, Steven Soderbergh's labyrinthine film compelling is trying to separate the villains from the good guys by observing actions and their results. What you're likely to come up with is that ""nobody gets away clean"". Which is also the film's tagline. Dig in, and you will find two revealing scenes: 1) The newly appointed drug czar, Robert Wakefield (Michael Douglas), in what he thinks is generosity, gathers his team of lawyers and experts and asks them ""for this time only"" for their ideas. He is greeted with dead silence. 2) A mid-level dealer sits in custody of two agents and explains to them, in a surprisingly eloquent manner, why they are in fact were working for his competition when they arrested him, ""you know what the sad thing about is. You know what you're doing and you do it anyway.""
The film reportedly has over 100 speaking parts. Soderbergh, who shot it himself, narrows it down to three main threads; in the blue tinted Cincinnati, Ohio, the new drug czar, Douglas, prepares for his high profile job whilst his daughter falls deeper into addiction. The pat moralistic tone of this segment would be purely TV movie if it weren't for the reliability of Douglas and the director's hand-held technique that gives it an immediacy it doesn't deserve. Further west, in brighter San Diego, a rich, pregnant housewife, Helena Ayala (Catherine Zeta Jones), is dealing with the fact that her husband is a prominent drug dealer. A journey of self-discovery later, and she goes from being a member of her son's school board to ordering an assassin, over the phone to ""Get out of the car and shoot him in the head."" By the end of the film, she's still on the school board. Still in San Diego, and closer to the violence are Montel Jordan (Don Cheadle) and Ray Castro (Luis Guzman), two drug agents. Their scenes are rich with humor and warmth that nicely modulates the film. But it is further south, in the bleached, burnt out Mexico that Traffic touches greatness. There, honest Tijuana cop, Javier Rodriguez (Benicio Del Toro) navigates the hazardous ""entrepreneurial drug war"", quietly but desperately holding on to his dignity. It's a beautiful, expressive and subtle performance. Incidentally, one of the few deserved accolades at the recent Academy Awards.
What Traffic lacks, and what many critics have overlooked, is...anger. Soderbergh displays an uncommon mastery of structure, and style that actually adds to the film. His film is fascinating from start to finish. Something political films share with science fiction films is that they let the viewer see what they never have; what really happens in the corridors of power as opposed to what evil blob really lurks beneath the earth's crust. Burdened with a sense of responsibility, the director tried, perhaps too hard, to be even handed and mature. Isn't the failure of the such an elaborate system worthy of jet black humor? Shouldn't the film go after the targets it reveals to self-aggrandizing and delusional? Watching the Cincinnati segments, I remembered another blue tinted, political film, Michael Mann's The Insider. That film took a tobacco/journalism controversy and transformed into something operatic. By contrast, Traffic, often seems to have its foot on the breaks, refusing to get emotional. Yet I still agree with most critics who call it one of the best films of 2000. Its sheer scale compensates its reserve. For Soderbergh this is worthy return after the nonsensical Erin Brockovich. It is an impressive achievement that would have been a great film had afforded the same insight to its characters that it affords their trade. It is at those times that Traffic could have used a little hit.",985910400,6,4989,5.1077111383108935

Score: 95/100
Not since The Basketball Diaries have drugs been so expertly portrayed in a completely realisitic way as in Traffic, a stunning drama that captures you and doesn't let go, kind of like a rip in the ocean. Traffic is certainly one of the best films of 2000, such a memorable and moving picture that just keeps getting better.
Ohio Supreme Court judge Robert Wakefield has been appointed the nation's Drug Czar (Michael Douglas), his new position made more daunting by the discovery that his teenage daughter Caroline (Erika Christensen) is a heroin addict. Meanwhile, DEA agents Montel Gordon (Don Cheadle) and Ray Castro (Luis Guzman) are pursuing Helena Ayala (Catherine Zeta-Jones), wife of jailed kingpin Carlos Ayala (Steven Bauer), as she seeks to the control the business that her husband had kept hidden from her. South of the Border, duplicious local constable Javier Rodriguez (Benicio Del Toro) is fighting the battle with his own jaded, questionable ethical code.
It's not a surprise that almost everything in this movie is pitch-perfect, especially the beautifully controlled performances, particularly from married couple Michael Douglas and Catherine Zeta-Jones, the two are both astonishing, Douglas in his second best appearance of the year, and Zeta-Jones in her first mature performance since The Mask of Zorro, that is also her best role on-screen. Also on the hotline is Benicio Del Toro, in a role so cool, honest and controlled it makes you forget about his gigantic mistake in Excess Baggage and he holds the screen with a major force in all his awesomely-shaded scenes. Then, of course, there is Steven Soderbergh who goes above and beyond anything he has ever done before, including 2000's other S.S. hit Erin Brockovich and 1998's underrated Out of Sight. It's a truly stunning direction effort, in which Soderbergh should win an Oscar for.
Traffic is not one of those boring, yawny, let's-go-for-a-sleep movies, it is an entertaining, compelling and brave piece of cinema that never lets up. See it now.",985392000,,2052,5.165165165165165

The acting was great, don't get me wrong, but there were several things wrong with it that would make me give it a negative recommendation.  First off, literally everyone that I've asked about this movie generally didn't like it.  Ranging from ""it was *ok*"" to ""I felt like I was going to throw up afterwards for wasting my time"".  To me, the movie was slowly paced, predictable, and had no memorable soundtrack, which made for a very boring experience, it's just not a good sign when you start looking at your watch 30 minutes to an hour into the movie.  Not to mention that there were three concurrent stories being told, and you never really got the sense that either of them had anything to do with the other.  Two of the ""stories"" did intertwine somewhat, but you still never really got the sense that they should be in the same movie together...
The makers obviously did something right, judging by the response from a lot of people, but they obviously did something wrong as well, when you have a lot of people who sat through the movie just wondering when it will finally be over...
I don't know, this was a really ""love it or hate it"" kind of a movie, so if you haven't seen it, and aren't sure you are going to like it, I'd pool some money with friends and rent it when it comes out, that way, if you like it, you've only spent a buck (or less) to see it, and then you can spend your money on the DVD, but if you happen to not like it, you're only out a dollar (plus a couple of hours).",984960000,10,1585,4.2842809364548495

1289473,4,B00003CXN4,"""Traffic"" is a Solid yet Over-rated film, at Best a Memorable Assault on Americas War on Drugs, at Worst, a Glorified Tele-movie.
Many, Many Great Performances hold the film together. My Personal Favourite is Don Cheadle as the Seemingly Torn DEA agent. His role has to run a Gauntlet of Emotions and this Wonderful Actor pulls it off Seamlessly. Michael Douglas is the Big Name of the cast and he also gives a Wonderful, Emotional Performance.
Benicio Del Toro is many Critics Favourite in the film, for me, his was one of the Least Striking Performances in the film. He has a Bloated Screen time and he looks Bored Throughout. His role is similar to Don Cheadle's but without the Emotion. The Academy Awards may believe he is the Best Supporting Actor, but I surely do not.
Catherine Zeta Jones and Dennis Quaid have Very Little Screen time, Especially Quaid, whose role seems to have had a lot of edits. More Screen time Probably would have led to Better Performances.
Much like the film ""Any Given Sunday"", the Best Performances come not from the Many, Big Name, Older stars, but from the Young, Relatively Unknown Actors. ""That 70's Show"" star Topher Grace is a real standout as he proves himself a Natural Dramatic Talent, even though sometimes, I found myself giggling at some of his trademark mannerisms from the show.
The Direction is merely competent, the hand-held camerawork feels Unnecessary and out of place in a film that is obviously trying to be so Big and Bold. The one clever thing the makers bring to the script is the use of different colours for the different sections of the film. A Yellow filter for the Mexico scenes, a Blue filter for the Washington scenes, and a normal filter for the Miami scenes.
Overall the Accolades attributed to the film are the result of its downfall in my eyes. I give the film 4 stars, I obviously enjoyed it, but it is still Wildly Overrated in my books.",984873600,2,1908,4.664688427299703
1289474,5,B00003CXN4,"This film is not only a masterpiece, but it also contains one of the finest performances ever captured on film, and that is by Benicio Del Toro.  His portrayal of a Mexican cop torn by loyalties is absolutely flawless.  He and Soderbergh cut down his dialogue to a minimum in order to bring out his facial acting ability, and the variety of emotions that Del Toro conveys in just a simple look prove that he is a master at his craft.  When I saw this film, I was reminded of another flawless supporting performance by Robert De Niro in The Godfather Part 2.  Del Toro's performance equals if not bests De Niro's, which I consider another of the finest film performances.  Benicio Del Toro makes it look effortless, which makes him one of the great ones.",983836800,12,753,4.507352941176471
1289475,5,B00003CXN4,"Tom Reynolds has already written a great plot summary so I will focus on the other aspects that make this movie the best of 2000.  First among these is the great acting.  Previous reviewers have knocked Zeta-Jones' performance, but I don't think I could disagree more.  I, like most, have not found her to be the greatest actor in the past (Entrapment, The Mask of Zorro, The Haunting *shudder*) but in this role she really comes through as the rags to riches, cocktail party wife who will do whatever it takes to hang on to her station in life.  She and Erika Christensen as the addicted daughter are the surprise rolls of the film.  Don Cheadle and Benicio Del Toro are great as always, conveying the conflicts and emotions of their characters perfectly.  Michael Douglas also shines playing a roll very similar to his billionaire in The Game: a powerful man whose notions of the way the world works are slowly being shattered.
Soderbergh directs the huge movie perfectly, balancing these various life stories perfectly while never loosing the sense of urgency and purpose that drives the movie forward.  He shoots each story differently (Soderbergh was cinematographer too under a pseudonym).  And his use of lens filters and editing is nothing short of brilliant: from the deep blue of Douglas' Washington to the wind-blown yellow of Del Toro's Mexico, to the soft, richly colored world of Zeta-Jones's suburban mansion.
Overall this movie is everything you could want from a great film: a riveting story, great actors, and brilliant directing.",983836800,7,1548,4.94980694980695
1289476,5,B00003CXN4,"It is refreshing to know that someone finally has the wherewithal to create a movie that accurately portrays the so-called war on drugs.  Steven Soderbergh has put together a masterpiece that, unfortunately, paints a grim picture of our society.
A beautiful weaving of stories intricately shows that no positive end can come from any action.  Benicio Del Toro gives a gripping performance as a man that wants to better his country but realizes that his effort will be futile in the end.
Catherine Zeta-Jones'  character undergos a metamorphasis of sorts throughout the movie.  In the beginning we see a woman that is ignorant of a situation and through unseen work begins to take the reins into her own hands, all in the name of greed.
Perhaps it is Michael Douglas's chracter that clearly understands the best that it is almost pointless to continue this war.  A scene that best summerizes this comes early in the picture.  He is on a plane surrounded by individuals from other agencies, asking for new ideas, for them to think ""outside the bubble.""  Silence is the only reply he receives.
The film is amazing to watch, often difficult at times.  The downward spiral of Douglas's daughter is almost painful at moments.  Similar occurances between storylines is just one example of the brilliant filmmaking.  Don Cheadle and Luis Guzman (reunited from Boogie Nights) are wonderful pieces in the film.  Cheadle is becoming one of the best actors in the business.
Along with all of the performances one must not forget the message that is presented.  There is no way this can continue.  Too much money is involved in this business to ever let it die.  It is impossible search each person that enters this country each day.  It is impossible to patrol over 3000 miles of border daily.  This is like a damn that is slowly eroding; you can attempt to patch it up but another leak will come as quickly as the last disappeared.  Think of this from a different angle; if this war on drugs was won, what would happen to all of the government agencies, officers, judges, and jobs that are put into place or created to stop drugs from entering the country?

It changes between the blurry heat colors when the scene is Mexico, and the conservative strict lines and coldness of The States.
Erika Christensen who plays the drug judge's addicted daughter is an interesting new acquaintance! She plays impressively, especially in the scenes where she's drugged.
Only regret: Thinking about the film afterwards, the part taking place in USA, especially the ending, is as naive an unoriginally judging as any other USAmerican movie, and that's a pity.

When will our government and other countries authoratative figures wake up and learn that the WAR On DRUGS is a complete waste of time and money.  This film speaks volumes about the reality of the aforementioned situation and anyone needing a clue about the drug culture should run to see this film.

1289480,5,B00003CXN4,"To say that this is a film with a message would be an understatement, because it comes across so emphatically clear and succinct, and it is this:  To wage a war against drugs, you must first come to terms with the sobering fact that the enemy is often a member of your own family; and how do you wage a war against your own family?  A sobering message?  Insightful?  Indeed.  And, when you consider the implications of it all, devastating.  Ponder that awhile and you'll begin to get a sense of the futility visited upon those who would attempt to rectify a situation that affects practically everyone everywhere sooner or later, either directly or indirectly; and it is just that situation that is addressed and presented with no-holds-barred by director Steven Soderbergh in his brilliant, hard hitting film, ""Traffic,"" starring Michael Douglas and Benicio Del Toro.  The film examines the trafficking of drugs between Mexico and the United States, and the long-ranging effects thereof; and Soderbergh tells the story through a number of perspectives, which effectively presents the ""big picture"" of the drug trade and the subsequent impact it all has on the lives of so many people.
 Probably the most telling perspective in terms of futility is that which is shown through the eyes of Robert Wakefield (Michael Douglas), a judge who is appointed the country's ""Drug Czar,"" and given the task of ""making a difference.""  It's a pivotal character inasmuch as it is through his involvement that so much information is presented, not all of which is anything new, but when taken within the context of the story has a tremendous emotional impact.  Through Wakefield, not only is the unbelievably far-reaching problem of illegal drugs illuminated, but the attitudes of all of those it touches on all levels, from the heads of the Mexican cartels to the kids who use and abuse the product made so readily available to them by the drug lords.
 A man of principle and high ideals, Wakefield begins by educating and familiarizing himself with all facets of the drug trade.  He quickly learns that although he is far from naive in terms of the reality of what he is dealing with, he actually has no concept of the depth and scope of it, like how much better equipped and financed the cartels are than the U.S. Government, for instance.  Another troubling aspect of the story involving Wakefield is the lack of respect accorded him by the young people with whom he comes into contact, not only in his official position, but simply as a human being-- especially by his own sixteen-year-old daughter and her ""friends.""  Unfortunately, it realistically reflects an attitude prevalent within a wide faction of our society today; and it's one of the strengths of the film that it can so succinctly capture something so distressing, something that should be of monumental concern to everyone, for it's an integral part of a larger something that touches us all.  Also realistically portrayed is Wakefield's reaction to all of this; the helplessness born of the limited ways of combating what he encounters is extremely well realized and conveyed by the film, and it enhances even more that already overpowering sense of futility.
 From the Mexican side of the border, the story unfolds through the perspective of Javier Rodriguez Rodriguez (Benicio Del Toro), a veteran of the Mexican Highway Patrol; and it's from his side of the fence that we begin to understand the ramifications of the politics, money and power, and ruthlessness that so empowers the cartels.  In these segments, the dialogue is in Spanish (with English subtitles), and Soderbergh uses a tint to the film that lends a visual sense of detachment to the action; it's almost like watching an old newsreel, which gives it an air of authenticity that works because it's incorporated with the emotional substance that ultimately provides the real impact.
 The superlative cast Soderbergh assembled for this film includes Don Cheadle, Luis Guzman, Dennis Quaid, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Steven Bauer, Jacob Vargas, Erika Christensen, Miguel Ferrer, Amy Irving, Tomas Milian and James Brolin.  An important film of gut-wrenching implications and staggering emotional proportions, ""Traffic"" evokes a sense of futility and loss (especially in the final scenes) that is, at times, overwhelming.  It makes you realize just how huge the drug trafficking trade is, and how any efforts to eliminate or even contain it simply pale in the light of it's enormity.  It's like a terminal cancer, spreading and eating away at the fabric of our society; a disease that reduces the value of human life to the barest minimum.  It's a movie that will affect everyone on a different level emotionally, depending somewhat upon personal experience and frame of reference, but there is no doubt that this is a film that will create a lasting impression on anyone who sees it; but be prepared, for this is powerful drama that elicits a sense of hopelessness which-- I'm sure for many-- may hit just a bit too close to home for comfort.",982972800,99,5058,4.9821852731591445

""Traffic"" tackles the issue of drug abuse by teens, international drug cartels, and drugs in upper class neighbourhoods in an unorganized manner. Uninteresting characters are played by uninteresting actors, the scenery is the same for the most part, and the entire film has a very noticable void; originality. This is just your standard 'drug dealers playing with the cops' movie. Nothing special about this one. The camera is always shaky, as if it was a camcorder you would buy at Walmart to shoot movies in your back yard, which adds to the lack of charm this movie had. During the scenes in Mexico, Spanish is spoken. That translates to about 3/4 of the entire movie, where the speech is delivered in Spanish. I didn't pay ... to read subtitles of mindless conversation for two hours. The bottom line is that the plot never takes off, the characters fail to develop, and the audience is left asking themselves where they parked the car.

1289554,2,B00003CXN4,"Not without it's moments, but this is essentially one decent movie starring Benicio Del Toro and two made for TV movies. And the tag line for one of the TV movies could be ""The Nominee for Drug Czar of the US says, ""This time it's personal....."" *Spoiler*  I mean, this is a film where Michael Douglas' character actually goes out to take on the drug dealers who have stolen his little girl. C'mon now.  I have asked many of my friends who call this a ""great,"" film to point out one situation where they truly felt empathy for what a particular character was going through and nobody can come up with much of anything. Catherine Zeta Jones and Dennis Quaid are just plain awful in this film and when her son is being threatened with having his throat cut you can't see that it's much more of an inconvenience than if she had been threatened with having her milk delivery suspended. This poor girl is just not much of an actress.  I loved the Boogie Nights guys, but even a good actor like Don Cheadle can't let you know how he feels about his partner being killed in this disjointed script. I never felt a thing for Michael Douglas and what he was going through with his daughter. Joan Allen came the closest to making something happen, but then you never get the idea that her character means anything to Douglas' either.  To sum up, I appreciate what Soderberg is trying to do here and if Traffic were what it began as (say, a three part series on TV,) I would find it worth watching, but this is not Academy Award material, or even a particularly good movie all in all. It's a shame that movies like Billy Elliot and You Can Count on Me were left out of the picture to make room for movies like this (and Gladiator.....oh boy.)",982281600,11,1730,4.38006230529595
1289555,3,B00003CXN4,"As someone said while I was walking out of the theatre, ""That was just an after school special.""  Traffic had all the makings of a great movie, stellar cast, masterful director, and what seemed to be a coherent script.  Ah, as with most successful failures, the script was the main failing.  The story follows 4 storylines, and Soderbergh pulls an Altman, and coherently intertwines them, a mammoth task to say the least.  The first story follows the newly appointed drug czar played by Michael Douglas.  His daughter played brilliantly by Erika Christensen, is smoking crack cocaine with her friends.  Supposedly this plotline is to be ironic, no, it's extremely heavy-handed, with no reason given for her drug habit, she is just a plot device.  Peer pressure may be a reason for alcohol, but she is smoking crack, she has to have problems.  The second plotline involves a mexican drug officer played absolutely flawlessly by Benicio Del Toro, no words can completely describe his performance.  This story is by far, the most compelling and coincidently, involves no heavy-handed tactics on the part of soderbergh or the the writer to get an emotional response from the audience.  The third plotline involves Don Cheadle and Luis Guzman and their attempts to bring down a local drug dealer.  Their performances are great also, they play off each other, with often funny results.  This story gets the least time.  The last plotline involves Catherine Zeta-Jones.  This is by far the worst story of the lot.  Catherine never could act, and giving her a role like this, is playing with fire.  And soderbergh got burned and burned badly.  When her drug dealer husband is arrested, she must pay back a cartel back a lot of money.  The sheer speed with which she becomes a ruthless adversary is completely preposterous.  She is ordering assassinations, and arguing with the leaders of high-powered cartels, literally within days of her husbands arrest.  This is completely ridiculous, she would be completely out of her league.  I don't care how tough you are, I don't think anything can prepare anybody to deal with drug cartels head on.  The multiple emotional layers of the character are never shown either, because, as I stated earlier, Catherine is without talent.  This movie was doomed from the beginning, Hollywood remaking a documentary into a movie, is just wrong.  They were obviously going to put some schmaltz in there, when the material doesn't support it at all.  The little coincidental meetings and when they pass in the street is just stupid too.  It isn't needed, and just distracts.  The performances will uniformly excellent, except for Catherine and the direction was impeccable.  But of course the script turns this into an after-school special with a bigger budget.  It violates the most basic rule of movie storytelling, show don't tell.",982195200,12,2857,5.006369426751593
1289556,4,B00003CXN4,"I was blown away by the reality of the war on drugs. Soderbergh shows us how real the situation is. It's not only happening on the streets, in Latin America, but right here, in our own homes. As a native of Cincinnati, growing up here, attending private school, and now a university that is close to where the ""street"" scenes were shot, I have seen both ends of the spectrum. And that is, drugs are prevalent, if you want them bad enough, anybody can get them. Many parents of the students Soderbergh chose to depict  in Traffic were furious and outraged, this movie only furthers my belief that some parents don't know the world their son/daughter is living in. This movie is a wake-up call to parents, don't be naive.
The cast was amazing to say the least. Douglas played a very respectable and believeable father and drug czar. Zeta-Jones played a strong wife, mother and eventually businessman as her lifestlye was threatened. Luis Guzman, Don Cheandle and the guy from ""That 70's Show"" provided great comical relief, surprising cameos by Benjamin Bratt and the beautiful Salma Hayek. Benecio Del Toro was incredible, his quiet struggle in choosing between right and wrong was award winning. The three storylines were nicely intertwined; the photography and color in the Tijuana scenes were classic.
A very good film, highly recommended. Great cast, great script, brought drugs to the forefront. Soderbergh created a movie out from a very touchy subject, and the constant, never-ending struggle that will follow.",982108800,4,1516,4.968503937007874
1289557,4,B00003CXN4,"Don't get me wrong. ""Traffic"" is a truly great film. It's very original. As a movie, though, it doesn't do justice to any films about drugs. There are hundreds of films about the inevitable addiction, but ""Traffic"" isn't one of those films that defines drug films in general. If you're a fan of director Steven Soderbergh (Out of Sight, Erin Brockovich), then without a doubt, you're going to love this film. However, if you're very much of a mainstream moviegoer, then your view is on a 50/50 basis. This near three hour drug epic is centered around four stories, (people say three but it seems like four), with two agents protecting a criminal who's about to testify against a drug lord, his wife ends up taking over the family business while he sits in jail. Meanwhile, a Mexican cop struggles with the blur between right and wrong while working for a corrupt general, who intends on cornering the drug market as the country's drug czar, the fellow drug czar he's to meet is a newly appointed man who comes across the news that his straight shooter of a daughter is a junkie. The cinematography of the film captures the atmosphere and mood of the film with it's rusty and sunny visuals depicting these characters. The performances are all around great particularly with Benicio Del Toro's cop, Michael Douglas' put upon father, and frequent Soderbergh actors Don Cheadle and Luis Guzman as wiseacre DEA agents. As well as Miguel Ferrer as the targeted informant and Dennis Quaid as a shady lawyer. Soderbergh's use of the steadycam is throughout the entire film to have a raw documentary feel to it. This may annoy some, it may be intriguing to others. I found some if it to be necessary and then parts of it when it was totally uncalled for. The film is a raw education into the minds of the people whose lives revolve around drugs. Some work with it, some against it. It's statement is that the war on drugs is totally inevitable. While it's entertaining, it also has an impact to it. ""Traffic"" is most definitely an intriguing movie but it's for very serious minded moviegoers.",981849600,5,2083,4.693989071038251

Another is with a young California wife(Catherine Zeta-Jones)finding out her husband is a drug dealer after his arrest. Another is with two DEA agents trying to track down a major drug dealer. And the final one is with a Mexican man(Benicio Del Toro)who is recruited to work on taking out a drug cartel in Tijuana, Mexico. The film is wonderfully acted and directed. Steven Soderbergh's direction gives the film its own unique look which gives it a lot of intensity. I hope it wins some oscars this year.

Douglas just happens to become nation's drug czar at the same time that his daughter becomes a drug-obsessed, skid row prostitute--while maintaining ""all A's"" at her exclusive prep school.

1289622,5,B00003CXN4,"There's a scene early in Traffic in which a group of preppy teenagers basically ramble on about nothing and snort cocaine. It's a fascinating, disturbingly gritty, and brutally realistic scene, but it also makes you think about why kids take drugs to  begin with. Kids don't shove sticks of marijuana into other kids' mouths and make them take it at gunpoint, like many people think. No, this scene suggests that it's much more casual than that. All these kids, in their isolation and boredom, are connected, and drugs seem to further that connection. These are the kinds of things you think about throughout, and long after, Traffic, Steven Soderburgh's brilliant, gripping, thought-provoking new film that grapples with the drug war. It tells three separate stories (which, since I have limited space, I'm not going to go into; they're posted on the offcial review), and Soderburgh's, working from Stephen Gaughen's taut, brainy, wonderful adaptation of the Brtish miniseries Trffik (which was over six hours long), directs brilliantly. He uses different hues and colors for his different stories (ice blue for Ohio and D.C., sandy yellow for Mexico, etc.), and while it takes a few minutes to adjust to his style (colors, jump cuts, etc.), it ultimately proves to set a magnificent mood and tone for the film. He keeps the two and a half hour film fascinating (compared to the hour and a half Head Over Heels, the time flies), and he juggles his three stories superbly, each of them fascinating as they slowly intertwine. And Soderburgh lets a outstanding cast shine. Douglas, in his second great performance of the year, shines as Robert Wakefield, Erica Krisstensian (sp?), in a brave perforamnce, pulls no punches as Douglas's druggie daughter. Catherine Zeta Jones is a revelation. She is at first tender and vulnerable, slowly becoming a shrewd, ruthless businessman, in a wonderful transformation. Don Cheadle, Luz Guzman, etc.; all outstanding. And Benicio Del Toro, wearing sags under his tired eyes like badges of survival, gives a quietly powerful, deeply haunting performance. But ultimately, this is Soderburgh's film, and he asks many tough questions and tells us a bleak truth: that as long as drugs are woven into the fabric of Americana, as long as there's corruption and greed, as long as there's supply and demand, the drug war can't be won. Yet Soderburgh also implies that the only way to beat drugs is personally, one addict at a time. It's this little ray of sunlight amidst the storm that gives Traffic heart as well as brains, and makes it one of the best pictures of the year.  A",981244800,22,2607,4.977064220183486
1289623,5,B00003CXN4,"Although I do not think Traffic fits as the ""best movie of the year"", it is definately worth paying for. It is a raw, fast paced movie about drug trafficing, staring actors like Michael Douglas, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Benicio Del Toro and many others, especially my favorite TV actor, Topher Grace of That 70's Show. The casting involved in this movie is the best I've seen in a long time. It is one of those rare movies, all of the actors are perfectly casted to their characters! I think this movie stands out from others that way. If you're not really interested in the story, see it for the acting.",981072000,3,601,4.522935779816514

The three storylines came together almost seamlessly, creating an epic film of the war on drugs. The great camera work added an edge to the film; it helped put you ""there"".  The different locales each had different hues, also a nice touch.  Benicio Del Toro was also magnificent. The best part of the movie, however, is the one storyline involving the teenage girl.  The harsh reality of  drug addiction is displayed here in incedible realism.  High-class teens are the target here, as told by one of the kids in the film.  He couldn't be more right. Watch the film and you'll understand.
The references to the school and locations in Cincinnati are true-to-life as well...just a nice little extra for those of us who live around here.

Weaving three complicated, taut stories dealing with the drugs was ambitious and almost flawlessly done.  Superb acting and incredible editing make this movie so much better than say a Clear and Present Danger type of movie.  I love the low-grade film and the different hues used for each story.  The only negative and it is a small one is that each story evolves rather slowly.  It didn't distract from the power and incredible screenplay.  $7.00 well spent!!",980726400,2,536,4.835164835164835
1289626,5,B00003CXN4,"""For a kid my age, it's a lot easier to get drugs than alcohol."" One of the most poignant and powerful lines in a movie in recent years belongs to a young teenager in Traffic.  This quote addresses  the very hopelessness of the drug problem between the U.S. and Mexico, which is ingeniously illustrated in Steven Soderberg's real-life epic.  This film beautifully demonstrates the aforementioned problem from four different points of view. There's the U.S. high-office officials, in charge of drug policy represented by Michael Douglass and his family, the U.S. middle-class law enforcement (Luis Miguel, Don Chedle), the Mexican law enforcement (Benecio Del Toro) and the rich top-of-the-drug-chain suburbanites (Catherine Zeta Jones).  Each segment is filmed in it's own different style; the scenes in Mexico all have a dirty, yellow, grainy look to imply Mexico as the bottom rung of the drug ladder, while the scenes filmed in Washington D.C. have a cool, steel-blue tint, possibly to suggest a sterile, drug-free environment.  The film is meticulously assembled to convey just how hopeless the drug situation is, and that no matter how much money we spend, or how many policies we adopt, there will always be illegal drug running. The acting is astonishing, as every performance is nailed to perfection.  The film is technically effective, as most of the scenes were filmed with a hand-held camera by Soderberg himself, giving the film a semi-documentary feel.  This film is a perfect illustration of the problems faced by the U.S. and Mexico in regards to the illegal drug trade, and how bleak the future looks for getting the problem resolved.  However, by the end, the movie also illustrates that at least some of the battles can be won, if not the war.",980726400,28,1761,5.048275862068966

During the entire movie, the scenes were jumping back and forth from one part of the world to another. The camera scenes were continually jerky and very destracting, along with poor color. The plot was the generic drug cartel theme with no real excitement or action. I alomost left the movie theater but I kept thinking the movie would improve. It didn't!!

Well last night I checked out Traffic, with my manager and another co-worker.  I really disliked this movie.  With such and all-star cast delievering a less than mediocre performance, it reminded me of The Thin Red Line.  The camera work in it was really bad, with the exceptions of a few key angles and shots.  The camera's shakiness takes away from the key elements of the film.  And the sound on this movie was horrible.  For one, right when you do get interested in the film (about 1:30 into it) a car explosion is silenced with a slow-motion shot.  C'mon lemme here that thing explode.  And when a point comes in the movie to where one of our main characters is getting honored, they seemed not to have known what to write for him to say, and cut it out with a pleasant melody.

(woops big word)  It tells a story that is so full of under dealings, double crosses, betrayal, addiction, and even murder that it has to be some of that hollywood storytelling right?  I don't think so there isn't one part of this movie that I don't believe is true or couldn't be true.  That is a rarity in today's movie making industry.

1289692,5,B00003CXN4,"Traffic is easily the best film to be released in the year 2000. There was not much competition, but it did best such favorites as Almost Famous and Gladiator, hands down. This film has everything that a great film needs. It has a story that leads the viewer in many different directions, a director that knows the true elements that go into making a great film, and a cast of stars too long to list.
Generally in films such as this, there is one person in the ensemble cast that sort of sticks out for not doing such a great job on acting. Not so on this film. Everyone does a great job, it is just more difficult to find an actor that does a better job than someone else. Benicio Del Toro deserves the Golden Globe for his outstanding job as a Mexican official. Catherine Zeta Jones does a good job as the wife of a drug lord, and the rest of the cast gives hope that there are actually decent actors left in America.
This is a film that should be seen by everyone. It tells a great story of the fight against drugs in America from many different standings and different backgrounds. The film never tries to be pretencious or preachy, it just does a great job at opening the eyes of all of those people that do not realize what a problem drugs are. After this film you will look at all the news reports a little differently. Steven Soderbergh deserves all the acclaim he is getting for this film.

This movie is in no way deserving of any awards. Do not see this...!",980121600,5,367,4.257142857142857
1289694,4,B00003CXN4,"Traffic may be jammed with some very obvious messages, but style serves the substance abuses beautifully as Soderbergh crafts a film that could have (and should have) been overly familiar into one of the year's finest.
Imagine for a moment what a chaotic mess... the film would have been in say Oliver Stone's hands.  Soderbergh doesn't cram his film full of excess of let the audience enjoy the film on a visceral level at all.  When a car explodes, we don't hear the explosion.  We don't get a big stirring final speech from a main character. The film isn't interested in that type of phony audience pandering.
The rotting sepia toned yellowishness of the Mexican scenes, contrasted to the washed out look of the Cincinatti ghetto scenes, to the cool blues all over the Washington D.C. scenes to the orangish warmth of the San Diego based scenes stylishness will force you to see even familiar things in a new way. And to think about them.
The casting is absolutely superb.  Miguel Ferrer has never been better, Don Cheadle and Luis Guzman are superb. Guzman who has become overly familiar in a running sit-com character kind of way, rises above all that and establishes genuine chemistry with Cheadle in the several wonderful scenes they have together.
The character actors are so natural and well cast they don't seem so much like actors as people you've met a few times who have been caught on tape doing their jobs in the courtroom.
There's Michael Douglas consorting with real Senators and border patrol officials.  He winds up `acting' several times, but it's painless to watch him under Soderbergh's expert direction and the films superb editing.  Even when we're watching him rush into a school room , pull the kid out of class, look for his daughter in the ghetto, etc. it works better than it should as we are watching it because it's well directed and edited.  Sure you think of it now and it's a new version of Paul Schrader's film Hardcore or perhaps a well meaning t.v. movie all over again, but it's not utterly phony.  We aren't given the big triumphant scene or any action film pay-off scene.  I suspect there's plenty of people who will consider the film actually copped out by not giving the audience what it really wanted at several points in the film.
Benicio Del Toro as the Mexican police officer, wears the right attitude, and trusts Soderbergh to use him better than he's ever been used before.  It works.  It's a beautiful fusion of good acting, good direction, and style delivering many riveting moments.
There's also several times, characters deliver their messages straight out.  Some of these messages are told with such directness you accept them because of their utter lack of pre-tense. I'm thinking of when the student turns to Michael Douglas in the car outside the dealer's house and just makes his speech.  It's not an expected or realistic moment, yet it works. The character has a moment of doubt that Soderbergh captures which sells it.  Crass? Manipulative?
Yes.
But it's not done with false pretense.
As you reconstruct various scenes you realize there's a thin line which separates a lot of the film from a Scared Straight type of documentary, but it's been crafted with such a high degree of skill you admire what's being done and of course why it's being done.  The script travels over well worn territory and at times is very weak (a newly appointed drug czar seriously doesn't know there is no such equivalent position to his in Mexico?).  At other times the film seems to be doing to much at once, covering many characters and events in a somewhat illogically compressed time frame (the justice system is depicted at moving much more quickly than it ever does in real life).  But it is the movies after all. The  screenplay is  by Stephen Gaghan and is based on the 6 hour 1989  British miniseries Traffik.
There are  moments in this film where a shot is so perfectly constructed your in awe of Soderbergh's  instincts.  He truly can construct even the most perfunctory and mundane of scenes in a way that elevates them to art.  Look at how wonderful he will frame a main character as he walks down a hall.  How he chooses to have a helicopter literally land on top of a camera.  How he shows us a non-travelogue wide shot of Mexico City.  How he captures the desperation and chaos of a drug bust operation.
SEMI-SPOILER
Catherine Zeta-Jones character does suddenly change from one that is apparently naive  and out of the loop into one that is ruthless and experienced.  However if you pay attention the seeds are well planted for the conversion She's a women who came from the wrong side of the tracks.  She's insulated herself from her past and has almost forgotten where she came from.  When her new rich friends abandon her she realizes how utterly phony they are, and she now needs to fight to keep what she has.  She gets the information she needs, and she's a quick study and not nearly as naive as she's been pretending she is.  The gaps in her learning curve have been closed partially by Dennis Quaids' business manager character and she's a mother protecting her son first, her lifestyle second at all costs.
End Semi- Spoiler
Traffic is a film that likely to be over-praised and make some film-goers wonder what all the fuss was about.  The fuss is about Soderbergh's stylish presentation and some wonderful acting.

1289695,5,B00003CXN4,"I hope that my comments do not distract from an outstanding movie, which promises to please not only the critics but general audiences as well.  Although I thoroughly enjoyed the movie I found Benicio Del Toro's award wining performance irritating.  I could not get over his accent.  Although most of the heavily slangged dialog was clearly Mexican, his accent could not fool anyone who has lived in Mexico.  I spent the whole movie trying to distinguish his national Heritage.  I erroneously came to the conclusion that he was Colombian, later to find out that he was born in Puerto Rico.  Casting him in that role is comparable to casting Hue Grant in a role as a Texas Cowboy.  Of a lesser movie I would not have cared.  In one of this caliber, it proved disconcerting.  Barring this distraction which most people will not notice, ""Traffic"" is a movie which is not only entertaining but also succeeds in examining various views on the ""war on drugs"" without deciding for you.  For the Independent movie crowd I suggest you also see ""Requiem to a Dream""",979689600,,1055,4.715846994535519
1289696,5,B00003CXN4,"""The American drug war is a war we can win,"" says the new government drug czar of the ongoing battle against illegal substances in America. This line comes towards the ending of the movie, though it is clearly not needed in the beginning. Right from the beginning, we know that this is going to be a serious, yet humorous take, on how many different situations can arise and lives can be affected by contact with narcotics.
Steven Soderbergh's newest film, ""Traffic,"" is everything like the films he has done before: brutally honest, tactful, and without reserve when it comes to its display of the situation at hand. His brilliant direction of characters as well as the cinematography of the movie is nothing short of in-your-face amazing, making it one of the year's best films.
There is not one, but three stories, intricately interwoven together while not having any of the major characters really interact with one another. One story focuses on Mexican cop Javier Rodriguez, who is caught in between his homeland and the U.S. over who is crooked and who is not when it comes to bringing down a major cartel in Tijuana. Back in the states, Robert wakefield has just been appointed to the position of drug czar, and finds out too late that he may be in a no-win situation. To top that off, his daughter is severely hooked on drugs, which leads to life-threatening situations. The third focuses on a drug kingpin's arrest, with his clueless wife beginning to piece together her husband's trade and eventually taking over the business, all the while being watched by the very two men who arrested her husband.
Is it confusing? At times, yes. Is it worth it trying to sort it all out? Definitely. ""Traffic"" may be a little hard to follow in the beginning, but sticking it out is absolutely worth it in the end. As the movie switches from story to story, there is never a dull moment. Each story has its own unique message about how drugs affect people of different backgrounds, and how some of those peoples' lives affect others. That is what is so brilliant about this film: when the characters from differing stories interact, they are never given enough time to get to know each other, keeping the action separate and moving.
Soderbergh's use of the camera and color tints also help to give each setting its own unique and disturbing feel. The sandy deserts and towns of Mexico appear yellow and bright, while Ohio is blue, chilly and frigid. Throughout the movie, he gives each scene a somewhat grainy appearance, setting it apart from mainstream cinema while adding to the uniqueness of the story as a whole.
Actors are given a chance to show off some of their best work to date, and there are so many actors that appear throughout that you will have to watch it repeatedly in order to catch them all. Among the main characters, Benecio Del Toro gives the best performance ofthe film, while Michael Douglas is perfect for the role of the politician with personal as well as governmental issues. Catherine Zeta-Jones is the most debatable character, for when she is forced to dig into her husband's underground life, you won't know whether to root for her or criticize her for her actions.
""Traffic"" met all of my expectations head on, while also keeping me very entertained as well as informed about America's drug battle. The movie contains a message, something deeper than the characters and their lives, a message about what drugs can do to your life besides physical damage.",979689600,2,3483,4.758677685950413
1289697,5,B00003CXN4,"At last a film that isn't afraid of admitting that the war on drugs is a complete failure.  Nothing was more stunning that the Michael Douglas scene where--as the potential drug czar during a White House tele-conference--pretty much tells the nation that the only people we're really fighting against is our own family.  This is stunning, of course, but Steven Soderbergh is a filmmaker that has the guts to portray this fact. From the frontlines in Mexico, the projects of urban America, the houses of wealthy youths, and finally the cops and dealers, we see ALL viewpoints.  This is overall great filmmaking and great story-telling, not to mention stellar acting from Mister and Missus Douglas, Don Cheadle, and especially--and it's about time we all recognize him--Benicio Del Toro. Bravo! This is a MUST HAVE for your DVD collection.",979516800,3,837,5.050724637681159
1289698,5,B00003CXN4,"Traffic gives us a very disturbing yet equally true story about what happens to real people in the fight for war on drugs.  Traffic tells three stories.  About two DEA agents, Don Chealde and Luis Guzman, that are out to stop the ""Big Rich Guys"" at the to of the food chain.  Two Mexican Police Officers that happen upon a large shipment of illegal drugs, Benicio Del Torro.  And a newly appointed government official, Michael Douglas, that is there to clean up what his predecessor couldn't do.  WIth that said, we are left to director Steven Soderbergh.  With his brilliant usage of color and contrast.  And his equally astounding talent of editing and shooting this home videoesque film.  I was dumbfounded by the sheer tenactiy of the story.  So gritty and captivating.  It really tells people what they don't want to hear.  With such a fabulous cast as this: Michael Douglas, Benicio Del Torro (who should recieve an oscar nomination), Don Chealde, Catherine Zeta Jones, Dennis Quaid, Selma Hyaek, Benjamin Bratt, and Luis Guzman, you can't make a bad movie.

1289699,5,B00003CXN4,"This is a brilliant film, with a great cast, and an excellent story.  But seeing as I had just watched L.A. Confidential the day before I went to see Traffic, I found that there were quite a few similarities between the two movies.
For starter's each movie focuses on three main storylines(that all tie into one story)with other sub-plots around them- Traffic has Javier Rodriguez(Benicio Del Toro) fighting the Mexican drug war. Robert Wakefield(Michael Douglas as the Government drug czar fighting a battle he can't win. A And then you have Montel Gordon(Don Cheadle) and Ray Castro(Luis Guzman) as DEA partners who track down a drug trafficker, Eduardo Ruiz(Miguel Ferrer) and then have to protect him when he is to go in front of a court against Carlos Ayala(Steven Bauer)  And these three main storylines spring open sub-plots- The case of Wakefield's daughter, Caroline(Erika Christensen- a brilliant find) being addicted to drugs, Carlos' wife, Helena(Catherine Zeta Jones), etc.
L.A. Confidential has the case of the three cops- Ed Exley(Guy Pearce), Bud White(Russell Crowe), and Jack Vincennes(Kevin Spacey), totally separate characters that have to come together.
Both have brilliant music scores
And hopefully, TRAFFIC will also get a Best Supporting Actor for Benicio's role(and  maybe adapted screenplay?), just like Kim Basinger won her Oscar and Director Hanson and Brian Helgeland's screenplay won an Oscar
Half of the film is in Spanish- subtitles are provided, so don't worry!  I think this gives the film a really good feel and nice flavor to it.  It just wouldn't have sounded the same if all the Mexican parts were spoken in English.

Soberberg again does a superb job connecting all the disparate characters into whole.  Including some very hilarious scenes (with Don Cheadle and Luis Guzman) that he's shown he is capable of before in movies like Out of Sight and Erin Brockovich.
Traffic simply proves Soderberg is the most exciting American director since Scorsese. And Benicio Del Toro gives the best heroic underdog performance since Stallone did Rocky way back when.
If Traffic doesn't win Best Picture it'll rank up there with the injustices Raging Bull and LA Confidential had to face.

1289800,4,B00003CXN4,"""The war on drugs"" is something we've all heardabout. Many feel that much has been done to stop it. And, at one time,I also thought the exact same thing myself. But, after watching one ofthe most powerful films I've seen not only this year, but on thesubject of drugs, I now feel, this is a ""war"", we'll neverwin!  Director Steven Soderbergh (who's had an amazing year), has madea film that many might see as an eye opening experience. Thescreenplay by Stephan Gaghan based on the miniseries""Traffik"" by Simon Moore, is so real that it's almostimpossible to get involved. The characters reminded me of people Iactually know of personally or causally.  The story is about threedifferent drug cartels on the verge of going under. I refuse to giveany important or slightest detail of this masterpiece. The less youknow going into this film, the more you'll be able to enjoy it. I willhowever try to describe a very brief outline. Something enough so itwill arouse your curiosity.  The first of the three stories includes amexican cop named Javier Rodriguez Rodriguez (Benicio Del Toro), whois ordered to find the leading dealer in mexico, and bring him toGeneral Arturo Salazar (Tomas Milian), who is determined to take downeveryone, but not for the reasons we are lead to believe.  The secondstory involves a wealthy ""business man"", Carlos Ayala(Steven Bauer), who is arrested, take a guess why! His unknowing wifeHelena (Catherine Zeta Jones) is know an outcast in theneighborhood. She must explain to her son what is going on, whileMontel Gordon (Don Cheadle) a cop is watching her, wanting to know ifshe knew about her husbands affairs.  Things start to look bleak forCarlos when a prime witness Eduardo Ruiz (Miguel Ferrer) is brought into testify against him. But,the question is now, will he still bealive to make it to the witness stand.  I have now saved the best forlast. The last story in this film deals with Ohio Judge RobertWakefield (Michael Douglas) who is strongly fighting for ""the waragainst drugs"".  He is determined to stop mostly teens from beingable to get to the stuff.  His high school 16 year old daughterthough, sees things differently. She is played brillantly by ErikaChristensen. I have no idea how old this girl is a real life, but allI can say after seeing her performance is, she is absolutely amazing! The way she was able to portray is character is unbelieveable. She wasable to handle to character in such a real character. It was likewatching one of the many kids I went to high school who have thisproblem.  There're also wonderful performances by people whom I'vefailed to mention like Amy Irving who plays Barbara Wakefield,Douglas's wife. Dennis Quad plays a friend\associate of Carlos Ayala,Arnie Motzger. Plus keep your eyes open for a cameo performance byAlbert Finney as the Chief of Staff.  Here is a wonderful, strong,real, film that really explores what is going on today in our countryas far as drugs are concerned. There are few films that really touchpeople in some special way. While we all may have our own list, thisfilm goes on mine.  The only downfall to this film is it's a littleover 2 and a half hours. I heard many people complain after watchingthe movie. The same way people avoided films like ""Meet JoeBlack"" and ""The Green Mile"", I'm afraid people willalso avoid this. This is a first rate film with a first rate cast thatremains to be one of the best films of 2000!",978998400,,3426,4.9100346020761245
1289801,5,B00003CXN4,"I saw this film this past weekend and I was expecting alot from it.  It has been targeted as one of those can't miss oscar hopeful films that are great.  However, most movies like that fail to live up to the heightened expectations.  However, Traffic was better than I expected.  It is one of the only films I have ever seen that actually has a message, that actually sets out to prove a point. A film that is social commentary.  Soderbergh is a great director as proven by his earlier body of work (Sex, Lies, and Videotape and Out of Sight are two of my favorites also), however Traffic is by far his best work that I've seen yet.  It interweves 3 different stories all dealing with the drug trade in an ambitious and truly wonderful way.  IT shows every kind of thing dealing with drugs from those who are addicts to those who are supposed to stop it.  And sometimes those connections are alot blurrier than expected.  I reccomend this film to everyone who loves great cinema.  Just see it.",978998400,,993,4.43646408839779
1289802,5,B00003CXN4,"While this movie wasn't perfect, it was very well shot.  The most entertaining aspect of this film for me were the scenes shot south of the border.  Although I've never really been too enamored by Mexican culture or the Spanish language, the beautiful way in which the Mexican characters spoke Spanish, and the beautiful sepia toned sequences shot there, almost made me want to take a quick trip there.
Even though this film has ""big-name"" American stars, I have to say that I particularly enjoyed the performances of the lesser known actors portraying the Mexican characters, including Clifton Collins as Frankie Flowers (a brilliant, Oscar worthy performance as a gay, psycho hit man), and the actor who played General Salazar, the cultured, yet brutal Mexican general.
And needless to say, Benicio del Toro is a GOD!  I have never considered this man sexy, but throughout the film I kept thinking how incredibly ""do-able"" this man is.  Okay, back to business now.  With age he has grown into his quirky, craggy face.  His acting and subtle body language really held me captive.
Also brilliant was Don Cheadle, and Catherine Zeta-Jones was a huge surprise.  I thought her role could have used more intensity, but all in all a standout performance.  Topher Grace was also excellent as the snotty prep student who turns his girlfriend out to the dogs, literally.
Although usually I like Michael Douglas, I thought his performance was somewhat boring in this one.
Not a perfect film, but definitely worth your time.  Compared to most of the dreck out there, this one is definitely one of the best I've seen in a very long time.  Bravo to Steven Soderburgh for a job well done.",978912000,4,1675,4.84561403508772

If this wasn't a drug movie it whould most likely be a surething for an acadmy...lol well to sum this up it's saying no matter how hard the goverment tries they can't win the war on drugs.

1289804,5,B00003CXN4,"Steven Soderbergh's TRAFFIC is a masterpiece of filmmaking and an indictment on the United States War On Drugs.  There simply isn't a bad performance in the film, and Benicio Del Toro as a Mexican cop is a standout.
There are some films that get kudos because of their subject matter, but as films they are weak.  This one is not.  Soderbergh has made his CITIZEN KANE.",978825600,,369,4.5606060606060606
1289805,3,B00003CXN4,"I admit I had high hopes for this film.  After Soderbergh's last three releases (Out of Sight, The Limey and Erin Brokovich) I expected greatness.
Instead of reliving previous movie magic, I found myself sitting through a well-acted, nicely shot but ultimately unmoving, tired story. Beyond Don Cheadle's superb work (yet again he will be ignored come Oscar time), the acting is merely solid, but not very impressive.  The mundane acting fits the movie's dialogue and story - not much in the way of noteworthy.  Sure Soderbergh frames his shots nicely and piles on the lighting and exposure tricks to add punch, but in the end it's just a slick, well-made, though antiseptic view of drug trafficking.
There is no new ground covered.  No new characters.  Nothing much happens that hasn't happened in dozens of other movies.  While one might say Brokovich and The Limey played out in a similar fashion, those movies at least had some soul and texture to juxtapose the cold, removed feel of Traffic.  The Limey had the added dazzle of the disjointed narrative and the jump cutting, matched by Stamp's vacant, creepy gait and gaze.  Brokovich followed the same David v. Goliath patterns we've seen, but the washed out film and the snappy wit, along with Albert Finney's work put it beyond the average TV-movie-of-the-week feel it should have presented.  Traffic on the other hand, came across far too often like a fictionalized 60 minutes episode.  Too much of the dialogue was spent explaining the drug trade (or talking down to the audience)and not enough screen time was spent really delving into the lives of the people involved.
Is Traffic a good movie though?  Sure.  It's solid, sort of a superbly crafted NBC Miniseries.  It's just not on par with Soderbergh's last few works.  And light years behind Out of Sight. Rent it.",978048000,8,1827,4.8896103896103895

1289807,5,B00003CXN4,"This movie was riveting from beginning to end, from script to cinematography, from lead roles (especially Benicio and Cheadle) to bit characters (Frankie Flowers). And most rewarding was the feeling that while being enormously entertained (lots of action, suspense, compelling characters, shoot-outs, blood, sex, the whole nine) Soderbergh's story (which clearly credits its genesis in that BBC documentary) also reveals many necessary and unpretty truths about what the war against drugs is really capable of, as well as how that (in)capability is one that we wouldn't have any other way. I wallowed in it's dark hopelessness and only regreted the few glimmers of hope at the end that seemed marginally inconsistant and insincere. But I guess some folks sleep better at night because of that kind of stuff.",977356800,2,807,5.3125
1289808,5,B00003CXN4,"While I was watching ""Traffic,"" I kept wondering what Orson Welles would've thought of it because it was so reminiscent of ""Touch of Evil."" I think Welles would've found Traffic worthy of comparison to his masterpiece.  I loved Benicio del Toro's portrayal of an honest Mexican cop discovering the futility of his drug enforcement activities. It was refreshing to see the parts set in Mexico conveyed in Spanish with English subtitles rather than in English with Spanish accents. Contrary to popular opinion, I think Americans can deal with subtitles.  The naturalistic quality of the entire movie was also very effective. I mean, the lighting and color schemes were artistic and deliberate but the movement of the story and characters flowed naturally. I also enjoyed seeing Don Cheadle and Luis Guzman on-screen together. Overall, I think every Soderbergh movie is worth viewing, and Traffic is definitely worth seeing.",977356800,2,921,5.258503401360544
1289809,4,B00003CXN4,"Another top-notch effort from Soderbergh. A complex, cynical look at our highly unsuccessful ""War On Drugs"" viewed from several different angles. First there is Michael Douglas as the newly appointed Drug Czar who finds the problem hitting closer to home than he'd ever expect. Then there is Benicio Del Toro, a mexican cop caught up in a power struggle between rival drug kingpins. Then there are Don Cheadle and Luiz Guzman as DEA officers on the trail of an American drug-lord whose wife, Katherine Zeta jones, is totally unaware of her husband's chosen trade.
The film is very well shot, visually captivating...the performances are strong throughout especially from Benicio, who ought to be an oscar favorite. Guzman and Cheadle, two favorites of mine, are also wonderful together, in roles that may have seemed kinda corny in the hands of lesser actors.
At this point there can be little doubt Soderbergh is one of the major filmmakers of our generation, and any project with his name on it is a must-see. ""Traffic"" is no exception.",977356800,8,1037,4.9655172413793105

WOW, Catherine Zita Jones is an artist. I am also a fan of Benicio Del Toro.  I had fun watching the actors' chemistry.

7917836,4,B00003CXN4,"Very watchable documentary-style accounting of various stories happening as part of Americas War on Drugs around the year 2000; a great reminder that before everyone thought opioids would end civilization, there was crack occupying the exact same space. The message is driven home that the war(s) aren't likely to be won by money, hiring more cops, building walls, or sheer will. Its well paced and has a good cast. There are many long scenes where the dialogue is in Spanish without subtitles - while you can somewhat follow the gist of whats happening it can be hard to maintain focus.
