8217956,5,B000U5IW6E,"On July 6, 1997, the WWF hosted one of the most unique events in the company's history. In Your House:Canadian Stampede would be held in the Canadian Saddledome in Calgary, Alberta, Canada & still to this day is regarded as one of the greatest PPV cards of all time. Now for those that may not remember, but during this time, Bret ""Hitman"" Hart was leading his anti-American stable known as the Hart Foundation to wreak havoc in the United States for payback to the fans that turned on Bret at WrestleMania 13. Stone Cold Steve Austin had been feuding with this group for months but needed partners to face them for a sanctioned contest which brought an American/Canadian type battlefield. But what really put this event over was that despite the fact that the Harts were the heels, they were international heros in their home country of Canada while Austin & his team were the faces but were booed out the building. That's not all this card delivers as this event was stacked.

Mankind vs Hunter Hearst Helmsley. Mankind wanted revenge for what happened at the King of the Ring as these two picked up right where they left off from the King of the Ring a month prior as Hunter continued to show the same ruthless streak that would bring him to greater fame in the future except this time, Mankind delivered as much as he took. A great opener, despite the double count out ending, with Chyna getting involved from time to time that would lead to both men fighting all over the arena & eventually going outside to where they brawled in the parking lot that lead to Helmsley getting busted open in the process.

The Great Sasuke vs Taka Michinoku. This was both men's WWF debut (they actually debuted at ECW's Barely Legal before this) & was really something to see for it's time since it was really rare to see light heavyweight action in the WWF since WCW was the land for the cruiserweights. One thing to mention is that the announcers had a hard time pronouncing Sasuke (at least JR admitted it). Great match between these two that featured high-flying, mat-grappling & even some very stiff kicks including one that Sasuke gave Taka while Taka was sitting in the bottom corner that it made me cringe.

WWF Champion The Undertaker vs Vader. Originally, Ahmed Johnson was supposed to face Undertaker for the title but two weeks prior on RAW, he injured himself...again so Vader was the replacement. On top of that, Paul Bearer revealed Taker's secret about Kane the week before & was going to be in Vader's corner. Anyways, this was a better match than it would have been if Ahmed was in it as both men are regarded as two of the best big men in professional wrestling history. Both men held nothing back & went at it with power & intensity as this was one of Vader's best performances from his WWF run along with one of Taker's best title defenses during this reign in what was a great ""big man vs big man"" match along with Paul Bearer getting involved along with Jim Ross's comments towards him for some comedy.

Bret Hart, Owen Hart, The British Bulldog, Jim Niedhart, & Brian Pillman vs Stone Cold Steve Austin, Legion of Doom, Ken Shamrock & Goldust. First of all, before the match started, the Hart Foundation received such a loud pop to the point that you would have thought that the Beattles have reunited for one night only (no pun intended) while the reaction that was given to Austin was similar to how a Yankee would get in Fenway Park (sorry but I couldn't resist). This was one of the best multi-man tag matches of all time as it was just non-stop action from bell to bell with everyone putting on a great performance while mixing wrestling with brawling. They told a good story of how Austin tried to get the advantage by taking Owen out of the match before Bret returned the favor to Austin that eventually lead to both men coming back to join the action before the ending that not only lead to the SummerSlam match between Austin/Owen but the memorable aftermath of Austin flipping off the crowd while being handcuffed along with the Hart Family celebrating in the ring.

Overall, this was the best In Your House event of them all as it was not a long event (only 2 hours) but it delivered what you wanted to see in a wrestling event and that is non-stop action with no fillers or distractions along the way. I highly recommend to find a copy of this event as it was the best event that the WWF produced in 1997.",1234915200,,4429,4.53125
8217957,5,B000U5IW6E,"This was one of the best ever PPVs ever produced by WWE during the mid 1990s and easily the best overall PPV of the entire wrestling industry (ECW-WWF-WCW combined) in 1997. Just to relive the noise of the ovations that the entrances of the Hart Foundation and Undertaker got is worth the price of this VHS tape alone.

WWE today should seriously reproduce this PPV on DVD with a short documentary attached to it as this was truly a historic PPV. A DVD of this PPV would sell by the 1000s as every match on the card was very good.",1207094400,,530,4.3
