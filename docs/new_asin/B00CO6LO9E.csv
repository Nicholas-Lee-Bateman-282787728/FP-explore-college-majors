8583864,5,B00CO6LO9E,"Now for those who don't already know, Pro Wrestling Guerrilla (P.W.G.) is a promotion based out of southern California who holds events monthly/bi-monthly that feature local independent wrestlers along with some names who work for other promotions as well like Ring Of Honor, DragonGate, Evolve, and Championship Wrestling From Hollywood with this event being their annual singles tournament (spread across two back to back nights) with the winner being able to have any type of match against whoever they want in future.

Night Two featured the last three rounds (quarter, semi, finals) of the tournament but was held under a ""blind bracket"" meaning that none of the competitors or audience knew who they were going to face each round in advance. Quarter final matches featured Drake Younger vs. Brian Cage that saw a moonsault into the crowd & press slam onto a pile of chairs & powerbomb into the post all within the opening minute with the intensity only picking up more over time, Kevin Steen being more serious than we usually seen him vs. Johnny Gargano who saw a weakness & targeted it relentlessly, Michael Elgin vs. Roderick Strong in an evenly matched contest, and A.C.H. vs. Kyle O'Riley in a hard fought encounter. Semi-finals included Michael Elgin vs. Johnny Gargano where they wrestled into exhaustion & Drake Younger vs. Kyle O'Riley in a match that went in & outside the ring which saw Kyle wrestle a style we weren't used to from him such as using chairs to make his offense more impactful with the finals of Elgin vs. O'Riley being very physical with both men wrestling a submission style to the point where they were daring each other to give & take their best shot. Non-tournament six man tag matches include B-Boy & Willie Mack & Tommaso Ciampa vs. Team Best Friends (Joey Ryan & Chuck Taylor & Trent?) that saw one man get a rope burn that every man in the building felt, how hysterical way Chuck Taylor tried to hide a weapon, a special referee, and a sight of deja vu while the other six man tag featured Adam Cole & Young Bucks vs. A.R. Fox & Rich Swann & Candice LaRae that saw Candice give out & take abuse in ways that I've never seen previously in a match full of non-stop action.

This night was just like the previous night where the action was a taste of everything for a wrestling fan from entertainment to strong to submission to intense & impactful wrestling with the final moments of the event providing the biggest shock in recent P.W.G. history on many levels to the point where the fans chants that ended the program said it all, ""What The..."" so this is a event that you have to pick up along side night one.",1383264000,,2650,4.6481876332622605

The first night featured the opening round of the tournament with the first match featuring Kevin Steen vs. Chuck Taylor in a match that was probably the host purposely hysterical match I've ever seen in my life starting with the fans references to ""Super Cuts"" to an object of a fans getting the ""Ric Flair"" treatment to Excalibur being put in the middle of everything to taking a page out of The 3 Stooges.  Tommaso Ciampa made his P.W.G. debut against Brian Cage in a match that started off so intense that it created possibly the scariest moment in P.W.G. history within the first two minutes but definitely made the phrase ""BRIAN CAGE IS A MACHINE!"" a testimonial.  Other matches include Willie Mack vs. Johnny Gargano where both men decided to wear each other's shirts, A.R. Fox vs. Roderick Strong in a high impact match to the point where it wasn't shown on the DVD but it took Fox a while to stand up on his feet after the match, Joey Ryan vs. Drake Younger in a fight that contained two ""special"" sacks of weapons & one guy looking to ""FEED ME MORE!"", A.C.H.'s debut vs. Anthony Nese, Kyle O'Riley vs. Trent?, Michael Elgin vs. Rich Swann that was a ""power vs. speed"" encounter that had more references to Scott Hall than you can count, and a special six man tag match with P.W.G. Champion Adam Cole & P.W.G. Tag Team Champions Young Bucks vs. I.W.G.P. Jr. Tag Team Champions Forever Hooligans & T.J. Perkins (who at the time was the TNA X Division Champion Manic).

This night (just like the next night as well) showcased a heavy variety of wrestling from top to bottom with the bonus six man tag being a true special attraction based off the fact that you had champions for all different promotions not just throughout the United States but the world so this is worth picking up.",1383264000,,2314,4.706172839506173
8583866,5,B00CO6LO9E,"Now for those who don't already know, Pro Wrestling Guerrera (P.W.G.) is a promotion based out of southern California who holds events monthly/bi-monthly that feature local independent wrestlers along with some names who work for other promotions as well like Ring Of Honor, DragonGate, Evolve, and Championship Wrestling From Hollywood with this event being a two night event with not only using their regular talent but also debuting new faces along with bring back names from the past.  Since Amazon combined both nights together, I'll review both here.

Night One:
The main event was the final match in the series between Sami Callihan & Drake Younger in a Guerrilla Warfare match that was the most physically violent match I've ever seen in person to the point where even Kevin Steen himself on commentary made comments like ""I really don't like this...please let it be over...I don't like seeing these guys do this to each other"" as they started fighting in the streamers in the ring, trading trash can lid shots, Drake's head sliced open & bleeding like a fountain from a trash can shot, wrestlers landing on open chairs from moves like a superplex or release powerbomb over the top rope, weapons like thumbtacks & the first time a staple gun was used in P.W.G. plus literally throwing salt on the wounds.  P.W.G. Champion Adam Cole reunited Future Shock with Kyle O'Riley to face off against the Unbreakable F'n Machines that saw the Machines dominate with power including a penis thrust that pushed Cole into the corner & switching off doing the vertical suplex keeping Cole up in the air the whole time while Kyle focused on wrestling them with submissions & strikes while Cole would help double team whenever possible.  A.R. Fox made his debut teaming with Samuray Del Sol against the Inner City Machine Guns that had dueling ""All Night Long"" vs. ""Lucha! Lucha! Lucha!"" chants where they were evenly matched as far as high flying & athleticism with non-stop aerial moves including Ricochet doing a over the top rope reverse flip dive that landed him in the ladies bathroom, inside out senton, top rope legdrop onto the apron, a 450 splash that was only topped by a 640 splash.  Other matches include Paul London vs. Kevin Steen that had so many entertaining moments from a duel to photo opps to interaction with the fans, Johnny Gargano's debut teaming with Chuck Taylor vs. Young Bucks, Eddie Edwards vs. Jay Lethal in his P.W.G. debut that was very competitive including a chop vs. jab battle, and Roderick Strong vs. the debuting Trent?

Night Two:
Adam Cole defended the P.W.G. Championship against Drake Younger who had his head wrapped due to 19 stitches from the previous night that saw brawling both in & out of the ring with Cole targeting that head whenever possible & Drake fighting through the pain.  P.W.G. Tag Team Champions Young Bucks defended against the Dojo Bros in a """"chop vs. superkick"" battle that saw offense that wasn't typical of either Eddie or Roddy while the Bucks also made not only innocent victims of the referee but also the ring announcer to the point where Kevin Steen laughed so hard on commentary that he couldn't breathe.  Other matches include Jay Lethal vs. Willie Mack in a match that started off so hot that there were 3 suicide dives in in the first 15 seconds followed by a moment that was worth ""millions of dollars"" before one man literally had to almost kill the other to win, Johnny Gargano & Chuck Taylor vs. RockNES Monsters in a match that actually started on the apron, Paul London vs. Trent? in a long athletic contest, T.J. Perkins vs. Samuray Del Sol, Sami Callihan vs. Kyle O'Riley in a match that started off technically sound with trading strikes & submissions but got more physical to the point where both men were hurting after the match, and A.R. Fox teaming with the Inner City Machine Guns against the Unbreakable F'n Steen Machines in a battle of power vs. speed with Kevin Steen adding some entertaining elements from ""Dance Steen Dance"" to his reaction for waiting so long while Cage & Elgin had them in the vertical suplex.

Both nights were full of quality wrestling action only with the first night being the better night with night two not being so far behind so this two night event is something I would recommend for a wrestling fan.",1377734400,,4316,4.78255033557047
