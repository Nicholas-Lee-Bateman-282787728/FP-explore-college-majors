7894086,4,6305767483,"The Homecoming Friends Share the Good News of the Gospel in a Packed Evening of Music

Filmed at the Indiana Roof Ballroom in Indianapolis, Indiana this taping of Bill and Gloria Gaither and their homecoming friends incorporate some memorable moments with heartwarming gospel music. I especially enjoyed the ""Ninety and Nine"" featuring Donnie Sumner and the Talley Trio and ""Lord Feed Your Children"" as sung by Michael English.

The concert included 90 minutes of toe tapping songs, the brilliant piano accompaniment of Anthony Burger, and inspiring narratives given by Ann Downing, Gloria Gaither, and Jimmie Jones. The finale number ""What a Meeting in the Air"" sung by a large ensemble and the Homecoming friends was a strong ending to an already powerful concert.",1303430400,,766,5.219512195121951
