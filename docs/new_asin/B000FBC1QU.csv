8119888,2,B000FBC1QU,"This was a disappointment.  Legendary Weapons of Kung Fu is one of the greatest movies of this genre, but this dvd copy is missing sound effects during every fight scene.  It is very annoying to watch.  I have yet to find a copy with all the sound effects intact, and I have been searching for a while. I still own my vhs copy that I recorded from TV back in the 80's. I guess I will continue to watch that copy.",1447027200,,412,4.061728395061729

8119890,5,B000FBC1QU,Lau Kar Leung is awesome in this movie. He utilizes a whole weapon rack of weapons and is a master in using all of them. This is an excellent movie. The quality is not he best but the movie is still great.,1390521600,,205,3.9047619047619047
