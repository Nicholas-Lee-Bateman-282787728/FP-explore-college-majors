5133660,5,B0085TUFQ2,"If you lover her music, you'll love this bio.  The more one gets to know this special lady, the more her songs touch you.  She is a unique talent with a beautiful soul that comes through her songs.  Can't wait to her songs she will write after becoming a Mum!",1363824000,,259,4.14
5133661,1,B0085TUFQ2,I Hate it because it was not what I ordered. I don't know how the mixup occurred but I am not at all interested in celebrity video. Her music is great.,1363305600,,151,3.903225806451613
5133662,4,B0085TUFQ2,"Presented as a documentary, this video provides good history of Adele's musical journey. I had no idea that her cd's (19 and 21) were so named because of her age at the time of recording! While there is some footage of her singing as a young teen, I would have liked to have seen more. Still, this was a decent historical/insightful documentary that any Adele fan would enjoy.",1360454400,17,376,4.544117647058823
5133663,4,B0085TUFQ2,I love her voice and her style of music.  I play this in my car while driving.  This CD has great songs.,1360022400,,104,3.6818181818181817
5133664,5,B0085TUFQ2,I love Adele and have all her CDs.  Don't know why they want me to write more stuff than that,1359504000,2,93,3.65
5133665,4,B0085TUFQ2,"I thought this was interesting, learning Adele's background made me appreciate her music even more. Lovely young woman, a credit to the music world.",1358553600,,148,5.208333333333333
5133666,5,B0085TUFQ2,"Because of flight delays this Christmas I though I needed to order on my own.  Surprise, my son came thru when he finally
made it home.  I have returned this to Amazon and awaiting a credit.",1358294400,,190,4.25
5133667,5,B0085TUFQ2,"This DVD is the best of the 3 or so documentaries about Adele that seem to be available currently. This one has lots of her music in plus people who actually know her (friends ,producers, industry people etc) plus a load of interviews with the girl herself that I hadn't seen before.
This one is worth forking out for as it stands up to repeated viewings.",1345248000,42,355,4.393939393939394

5133669,4,B0085TUFQ2,It was informative. Earthy.  Good for her finding success.  More dialogue with Adele herself and more music would have been 5 stars for me.,1483401600,,139,4.75
5133670,5,B0085TUFQ2,"This was a fascinating documentary of Adele's rise in the music business. There wasn't much on her personal life, like the Amy Winehouse documentary; however, the analysis of the way the music was written and how the albums were produced offered an insight to Adele's special talents.",1483315200,,284,5.0638297872340425

8525694,5,B0085TUFQ2,"As a fellow artist, and understanding some struggles alone the way - I found this an excellent bio.  I appreciate the amount of work this woman has done, and no one gets 'discovered' without putting themselves ""out there"", and a lot of hard work.  Luck is like Fairy Tales...it's just a thing that people wish for - but it doesn't really exist.  She's been down roads a lot of us have travelled, and I am happy for her glorious success.  So well deserved.",1486512000,,455,4.445783132530121
