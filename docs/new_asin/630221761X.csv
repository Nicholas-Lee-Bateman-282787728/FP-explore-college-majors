I died laughing who wanted to be the next Playboy Playmate Centerfold in the 70's! I love both the intimate, the scenic, and intrigue on location shoots on Playboy Mansion grounds! I nearly died laughing at the Playmates sunbathing, having a tall glass of OJ, and rollerskating with 70's music around on the tennis ground in their bikinis in Los Angeles cheering; it's so seventies! I can only imagine the at all nights dancing at the Hef Mansion!

7822400,4,630221761X,"Playboy / Playmates: Early Years is one hour and twenty-nine minutes and was released on video on November 7, 1991. For those folks who do not want to buy thick book and read the history of Playboy then this mini documentary is for you. Playboy / Playmates: Early Years cover the years from 1953-1979. The video does touch on two Playmates from 1980. The 25 Playboy Anniversary party is the focus point of the video. Playboy / Playmates: Early Years shows how the Playmate and the magazine change in that period. A few of the Playmates give interviews like Lillian Mller and Dolly Read. Granted this video does show the Playmates nude in their centerfold shots and more towards the end; the bulk of the video focuses on the history of Playboy and its Playmates. Playboy / Playmates: Early Year gets a B+ for a good history lesson.",1246579200,3,830,4.614864864864865
