7862277,3,6304133944,"This video is a treat for fans of The Neverending Story! It is actually several episodes from an animated TV show, each with its own surprises! The good news for fans of the book by Michael Ende is that many characters which have never appeared in a movie before make their ""debut"" in this video! Such character include Grograman, Ygramul, the Acharis as well as the Water of Life! Other favorite characters such as Falkor, Engywook, Urgl, and of course Bastian and the Childlike Empress also return! The bad news is that while the plots of several of the episodes are based on chapters in the book, all were simplified and twisted to fit into their time-slot. Also, Xayide somehow is the ""bad guy"" in every episode! Come on... they could be a little more creative than that! But even still, I think this is fun for fans, and it is certainly better (in my opinion) than the 2 live-action sequels to the original movie!",1015200000,4,918,4.569696969696969
