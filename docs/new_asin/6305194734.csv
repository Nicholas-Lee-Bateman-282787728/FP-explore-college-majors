7885677,5,6305194734,This is not for the faint of heart. Overall if you wish to see real life drama with consequences of death or injury this video is for you.,1363564800,,138,3.9642857142857144
7885678,3,6305194734,"The first Banned From Television video is still the best in the series. However, Banned From TV 2 still has it's moments, including: a pitbull attack, suicide attempts, car wrecks, and a sex video of Tonya Harding and Jeff Gilooly. Good, but could've been better.",1032825600,,263,4.866666666666666
7885679,5,6305194734,"Banned from Television 2 has some scenes shown on tv (i.e. motorcyclist ended his chase with a BANG and the officer getting mauled by a pitbull)  But the hillarious standouts in this film are an officer getting beaten up verbally by a motorist over a speeding ticket (talk about comedy), a hot air balloon getting caught on a power line and it's passengers falling to the horror of an offscreen melodramatic woman who's crying and screaming like the world's ending (Cool it, baby), a firefighter rescuing a woman in the worst way (firefighter+ fatwoman= disasterous results!)  OUCH!!, a cop getting hit BADLY, A burly man attacks officer, and a horse gone mad (mad horse).  The Tanya Harding video scenes are fair but the real chills were before THAT!",1030147200,2,751,4.8515625
