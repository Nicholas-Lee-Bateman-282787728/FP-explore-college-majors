2747955,4,B000MTOM3U,"For fans of TNA, the X-Division or just simply AJ Stlyes, this is a must have for your DVD collection.

The best of AJ Vol. 2 is a welcome change from the first volume, not to say that the first volume didn't have its good matches. Volume 2 offers great matches of AJ and more!

Some matches include AJ vs. Samoa Joe vs. Christopher Daniels in a three way bout for the X-Division title; partnering with Daniels against LAX in a tag team ultimate X match; vs. Abyss in a Six Sides of Steel Match; and many more!

Also on the DVD, you'll get a sit-down interview with AJ himself as he discusses important and influencial moments in his life including: his childhood; his family; his religion; how he broke into wrestling; his brief stint in WCW; his call into TNA; and his future in TNA and more!

Definatley this is a must have DVD for any fan of AJ. You'll learn more and get some amazing professional wrestling out of it as well. Simply put: this DVD is phenominal!",1188518400,,966,4.35
2747956,4,B000MTOM3U,"Now AJ Styles is a man of high flying ability. I could watch him wrestle all the time and when you put him in matches against some of the men in the matches in this dvd collection, you are in for a treat. The only problem I have is that there are not nearly as much matches as the vol 1 collection had, but never the less this is one dvd you should definately check out. Matches include:

Lockdown 2006

Hard Justice 2005
NWA World Title Match
AJ Styles vs. Jeff Jarrett: This was a good fight and Tito Ortiz was the special guest referee. AJ wins the NWA world heavyweight championship. 9/10

The first-ever ""iMPACT!"" match on SpikeTV:
AJ Styles vs. Roderick Strong: Another high flying fast paced match that showed AJ's high flying ability in the brand new company. 8/10

Genesis 2005
X Division Title Match
AJ Styles vs. Petey Williams: A good fight for the X Division title. Their match one year previous was just as good and they still prove they have what it takes to make a great match. 8/10

November 2005 IMPACT Match
AJ Styles vs. Chris Sabin: Two of my favorites battle it out on Impact. solid match though a little short. 8.5/10

Slammiversary 2006
NWA World Tag Team Title Match

Hard Justice 2006
NWA World Tag Team Title Match
AJ Styles & Christopher Daniels vs. The Latin American Exchange: one of the greatest matches in quite some time. A lot of high flying by all four men and AJ and Daniels show why they are the masters of being a tag team. 9/10

Ultimate X Match For The Tag Team Title
AJ Styles & Christopher Daniels vs. The Latin American Exchange: Another match full of high flying moves and some really breathtaking spots. A really good match that shows Aj at his best. 10/10

For the X Championship
AJ Styles vs. Chris Sabin: Another classic between two of the best of the X Division. 8.5/10

This is recommended as is Vol 1 on The Best of AJ Styles. Enjoy!",1183593600,9,2268,4.378571428571429
2747957,4,B000MTOM3U,"AJ Styles is one of TNA's major breakthough stars and homegrown acts.  His high flyin' style along with actual ground wrestling that he's underrated for by most has made him simply ""Phenomenal"" by fans of TNA.  This DVD in my opinion heavily makes up for his first one since unlike his first DVD, these matches aren't full of non-stop interfearence or involve A.J. being a heel & toning down his style so he doesn't get cheered.  This DVD allows him to showcase his full ability in the ring.  Along with matches comes a biography on AJ breaking into the business & his life growing up.

Lockdown 2005: AJ Styles vs. Abyss - This match is just awesome. It's not really a bloody massacre but a great storytelling of ""the big unstoppable monster vs. the little guy who never gives up."" The door slamming into AJ's face is vicious.

(Also available on Best Of The Bloodiest Brawls)

Hard Justice 2005: vs. NWA Champion Jeff Jarrett - It was made out to be that AJ was the only man who could stop the unbeatable Jarrett & win the NWA Title from him.  Jarrett brought his A game here & delievered a good performance here with referee Tito Ortiz playing a role here as well.

Unbreakable 2005: vs. X Division Champion Christopher Daniels vs. Samoa Joe - This was the only time the X division title main evented a PPV and you could see why.  These three put on a wrestling clinic in their time as this was the best wrestling match of that year.

(Also available on Unstoppable: Best Of Samoa Joe)

Impact: vs. Roderick Strong - This is just significant as being the first match on Impact's debut on Spike TV.  Besides that, nothing really special past your normal Impact match between the two.

Genesis 2005 vs. Petey Williams - This match heavily makes up for their match a year earlier between the two at Victory Road as Petey delievers a strong performance while AJ once against brings his A game.  Another good showcase of the x division.

Impact: vs. Chris Sabin - This as a better than average match for Impact that did a good job showcasing both men in a short amount of time.

(Also available on Best Of The X Division Vol. 2)

Slammiversary 2006: w/Christopher Daniels vs. NWA Tag Team Champions America's Most Wanted - This was the match of that night as Styles & Daniels knew each other so well that he made a credible tag team while AMW are just the best in the business today. Plus that ""Chyna-like"" woman who showed up for Gail Kim was also a nice added bonus.

Hard Justice 2006: w/Christopher Daniels vs. LAX - This was the match that put LAX back on the map as being a legit tag team after going through that James Gang storyline earlier in the year. AJ & Daniels were actually jelling as a legit tag team while LAX made the best of their opportunity with Homocide having the ""X division"" & Hernandez being the ""powerman"" of the group. This was the first in their series of matches & a good tag team match.

No Surrender 2006: Ultimate X Match w/Christopher Daniels vs. NWA Tag Team Champions LAX - This was the match TNA fans voted as the match of the year & you can understand why after seeing it. There was alot of unique spots & different ways of trying to get the belts (ala Homocide getting a ladder) that which made this Ultimate X standout above the others. Also, I have to get props to Hernandez because for him being the big muscle man, this didn't have a problem adapting to a match that is strictly for ""smaller"" wrestlers.

Impact: vs. X Division Champion Chris Sabin - Boy the difference a year makes as Sabin is in full heel mode here.  Again, another good match for Impact as AJ ends up winning the title.

Bonus: vs. Ron Killings from NWA Wildside in 2000 - Just an average match put on here to showcase AJ in the beginning of his career.

I know that most of these matches have been released on other DVDs, a majority of them were PPV DVD's that you could only get thought the TNA website & not though national retail stores & with TNA only having an hour, it's understandable that his best performances would be on PPV.  If you aren't a heavy collector of TNA PPV's on DVD then I recommend but otherwise, there isn't enough on here for you to pay for matches you already have & I would pass.",1176249600,3,4219,4.412903225806452

8172212,5,B000MTOM3U,"Definitely worth the money for the match against Abyss and the classic triple threat from Unbreakable. I know everyone raves about the Unbreakable match (which is well deserved) but I personally like the Abyss match better. Similar to the Bret-Diesel matches from the mid 90s with the dominant 'big man' against the speed and finesse of the smaller man, this one really showed both at their best.",1264550400,,396,4.925373134328358
8172213,5,B000MTOM3U,"AJ Styles is one of the most gifted athletes that I have ever seen in the sport of professional wrestling. He does moves that most people would only dream of & has been involved in some of the best matches in TNA's history. In fact, AJ Styles was one of the guys that actually made me watch TNA as he really did a great job in showcasing what the X-Division was all about. At the end of the DVD, you will hear AJ talk about his childhood, what got him into wrestling, how he went into TNA & turned down an offer from the WWE along with various subjects including how he actually fears for his life everytime he goes for a move. Before that though, you get a couple of his best matches including:

Six Sides Of Steel vs Abyss. The winner of this match would get a shot at Jeff Jarrett's title the following month. This was an awesome match between these two as Abyss was the big monster who kept dishing out the punishment & even getting dominate at one point but AJ just would not give up no matter what & used his athletic & high-flying ability to perfection to combat the bigger man. Moments include the sick impact of AJ getting the cage door slammed on his face along with AJ doing a sunset flip off the cage onto thumbtacks to Abyss.
(LockDown '05)

vs NWA Champion Jeff Jarrett. The special guest referee for this match was Tito Ortiz & he got involved in the match from time to time. This wasn't the typical Jarrett main event performance as he actually brought his best against AJ while I have always said that AJ never disappoints in the ring. Great wrestling match between these two with both men pulling off many counters including both men stealing each other's finishers at times before AJ made his history in winning the title for the third time.
(Hard Justice '05)

vs Samoa Joe vs X-Division Champion Christopher Daniels. Honestly, this is one of those matches that I can try to explain but really words won't do it any justice as this was not only the first time that the X-Division title was on the line in a main event match but this is actually my favorite TNA match of all time. Everyone brought their A game & did what they do best which was put on a wrestling clinic for the ages. Check out the opening sequence as it was very similar to the beginning of the Taker/Rock/Angle triple threat which was hilarious as well.
(Unbreakable '05)

vs Roderick Strong. This was memorable for it being the debut match of Impact as it was an average TV match between these two.
(Impact Debut '05)

X-Division Championship vs Petey Williams. This was the better quality match that I mentioned on my X-Division review as this match was given more time & without the interference, these two were able to go out there & showcase how great both men truly are. Williams put on a great performance by using the mat-wrestling to ground AJ while AJ was using his high-flying including a spot where he does an over the top rope senton that lands him in the front row of the crowd & even trading some underrated mat-wrestling as well. Again, awesome match & tons better than their Victory Road '04 encounter.
(Genesis '05)

w/ Christopher Daniels vs NWA Tag Team Champions America's Most Wanted. Their rematch from Sacrifice & just like that match, Styles & Daniels were perfect together as they meshed well off each other while we all know that America's Most Wanted was the best tag team that TNA had to offer at the time. Just another great tag team match between these two teams along with that moment where this ""Amazon-Chyna/like"" female came out to make sure that Gail Kim would not get involved in this match as she did in the previous match.
(Slammiversary '06)

Ultimate X Match: w/Christopher Daniels vs NWA Tag Team Champions LAX. This was the match of the year for TNA decided by the fans & when you watch the quality that these four delivered, it's hard to argue with that statement. Daniels & Styles were just clicking together here while Hernandez was the powerhouse of the group & Homocide was able to hang in there move for move with Daniels & Styles. There were so many memorable moments here like AJ doing the ""Styles Clash"" from the apron through a table, Hernandez actually using a ladder to try to get the belts, Homocide's neck breaker from the top of the structure to AJ & even the finish with Daniels that lead to the fans chanting ""Please Don't Die"".
(No Surrender '06)

vs X-Division Champion Chris Sabin. This was better than the last match that they showcased on this DVD from Impact as even though they didn't get a lot time to tell a story, these two didn't disappoint & just went all out in that time spend to give you a match that I enjoyed despite the fact that it was short.
(Impact '06)

Bonus Match: vs Ron ""The Truth"" Killings. Just an average match to showcase AJ in his starting out days in TNA. I would have preferred his Hard Justice match with Christopher Daniels against LAX for the Tag Team Titles or even his Against All Odds rematch with X-Division Champion Samoa Joe & Christopher Daniels but I am just nitpicking here.

Overall, this DVD is worth for those getting that don't have alot of these TNA DVD because this DVD set truly showcases the best from AJ Styles & I would highly recommend.

8172214,4,B000MTOM3U,"I'm a big AJ Styles mark for sure this is going to be a positive review. This dvd has a lot of great matches including the Unbreakable three-way match with AJ Styles, Samoa Joe, and Christopher Daniels and the Ultimate X match with Styles and Daniels vs. LAX from No Surrender. My only complaints about the dvd are that more matches could have been added like the 6 sides of steel match Daniels and Styles had with LAX. Also more footage of him in NWA:Wildside could have been shown. (The Wildside bonus match really shows how far Killings and Styles have come now). All in all this is a solid dvd.",1205280000,,598,4.396396396396397

1. A.J. Styles vs. LOCKDOWN 2005: SIX SIDES OF STEEL- This was a great way to kick off the DVD. I will say any time Styles gets in the ring he gives it his all and with Abyss in a no DQ environment this worked great. This match started out on the outside with them just brawling and some nice high flying action by styles but than it broke back in the ring. This was just a solid wrestling match mixed with some hardcore action. The best part of the match for me would be when A.J. hit a power bomb on Abyss and drove him back first into the tacks. Winner A.J. Styles. Match Rating 10/10.
2. A.J. Styles vs. Jeff Jarrett HARD JUSTICE 2005: NWA WORLD TITLE MATCH- Well we go from a almost perfect match to one that was pretty decent. I will admit this match had a great storyline and with Tito Ortiz as the ref it made it even better. This was more of just a solid wrestling match and some nice submission moves by Jarrett. Back and forth action and lost of false finishes made this match even better. Winner and new NWA Champ A.J. Styles. Match Rating 7.5/10.
3. A.J. Styles vs. Samoa Joe vs. Christopher Daniels UNBREAKABLE 2005: X-Division Title Match- All I can say about this match is wow. This for me is probably one of my favorite matches ever. A.J. summed it up best on the DVD this came close to being the greatest match of all time. All three of these men were in there prime and they still are but they showed it here with the high flying moves and non stop action. A great build to this match made it great and this is better than the second one. Tons of near falls and just a awesome match. Winner and new X-Division Champ A.J. Styles. Match Rating 10/10.
4. A.J. Styles vs. Roderick Strong October 2005: The Debut Of Impact On Spike TV- This was a good match. To kick off the debut on spike tv it was a great call to go with A.J. This was  as good of a match as these two could have had with the limited time they had. Not a bad match and some nice spots but just passable. Winner A.J. Styles. Match Rating 5/10.
5. A.J. Styles vs. Petey Williams GENSIS 2005: X-Division Title Match- This was a great match. This was back when TNA accualty cared about Petey Williams and him and A.J. put on a great match. Just a lot of fast pace action and a great match overall. Winner and still X-Division Champ A.J. Styles. Match Rating 8/10.
6. Americas Most Wanted vs. A.J. Styles and Christopher Daniels SLAMMIVERSARY 2006 : NWA World Tag Team Title Match- This is one of my favorite tag team matches of all time. Americas most wanted had held the titles for well over 8 months and every time A.J. and Daniels went after them they would get screwed by gail kim. This match was given plenty of time to develop and there were so many close parts were it looked like Gail was going to screw them again. Tons of near falls and just some great after math with a huge celebration with the fans. Great match. Winners and new NWA Tag Team Champs A.J. Styles and Christopher Daniels. Match Rating 10/10.
7. A.J. Styles and Christopher Daniels vs. LAX NO Surrender 2006: ULTIMATE X Match for the NWA Tag Team Titles- Well this was voted by the fans TNA's 2006 Match of the Year and it was awesome. There were so many great matches in 2006 for me that it would be hard to pick a 2006 match of the year but this lived up to the hype. There were so many sick parts one included a RKO like move from the ropes all the way to the ground. Another sick move was A.J. took Homicide and hit him with a Styles clash through a table on the outside. Winners and new NWA Tag Team Champs A.J. Styles and Christopher Daniels. Match Rating 10/10.
8. A.J. Styles vs. Chris Sabin November 2006 IMPACT: X Division Title Match- Well this was a nice way to close off the DVD. I would have wanted a ppv match but these two put on a great match on impact. Not much to say but tons of fast pace action and some near falls that will keep you on the edge of your seat. Winner and still X-Division Champ Chris Sabin. Match Rating 7/10.

Well that raps up another. I would give The Best Of A.J. Styles Volume 2 a grade of 67.5/80 which is a 75% which means this is a awesome DVD. This came really close to be perfect and in all honestly I would go with that grade cause of all the extras and how he tells about his life. So yeah you should definitely pick this DVD up. If you can tell me if my review was helpful or not I would appreciate that. Thanks for your time.",1188777600,,4498,4.215777262180975
