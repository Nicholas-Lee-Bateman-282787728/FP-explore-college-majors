8631428,5,B00HAV21GS,"This DVD collection comprises all ten episodes of TNT's cancelled one-year-only medical drama, Monday Mornings. It was not released on DVD in the United States; the only home video release was this item, made in Germany, where Studiocanal acquired the rights and released it on DVD on November 20, 2014.
The title Monday Mornings is a mock name for ""M & M"" rounds; that stands for hospital Morbidity and Mortality weekly reports of deaths and serious failures. In hospital reality, the reports are very businesslike in a conference room, but the TV drama places them in the hospital auditorium at which the surgeons face all their fellow surgeons and receive both praise for their accomplishments and vicious insults for their mistakes, usually from the sharp-tongued and unlovable Dr. Hooten, with cutaways to dramatizations of surgeries, consultations, doctor-to-patient talk about life-threatening conditions (some with droll gallows humor), all-in-all a well balanced back-and-forth between event and critique.
It was written far over the heads of most medical drama viewers, based as it was on a novel by Dr. Sanjay Gupta, MD, neurosurgeon and an assistant professor of neurosurgery at Emory University School of Medicine and associate chief of the neurosurgery service at Grady Memorial Hospital in Atlanta, Georgia and CNN's multiple Emmy Award-winning chief medical correspondent. Most viewers found it dull, probably due to vocabularies inadequate to follow the dialog or intolerance of extended narrative lines in which nothing flashes lights or explodes. My wife found it intriguing and one of her favorites - so much so she insisted on buying this German edition and a DVD player capable of playing PAL format, something available in the United States only online - we got ours here on Amazon.
There are fans who would like to have the whole season of Monday Mornings, and this is it, the sole home DVD. However, be prepared to buy it from Germany, dubbed in German but switchable to the original English version. German is the default version, so you have to click through a menu to select the English original. Be warned however, all menu screens are in German without English translations. I can read German, but those who can't can pretty well navigate through the few key terms necessary to view the English version using an online German-English translator and get where you want with a little fuss, more a nuisance than a barrier.
Also, be prepared to buy a PAL-capable DVD player if you don't have that capability already. We greatly enjoy the intelligence of this series and easily accept the high-drama of the television adaptation of what we know to be very nuts-and-bolts reports among highly skilled (and usually highly critical) surgeons.",1441411200,12,2764,5.158129175946548
