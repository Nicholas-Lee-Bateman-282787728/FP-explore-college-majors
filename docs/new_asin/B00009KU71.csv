1883497,4,B00009KU71,"This would not make a lot of sense to a total ASL beginner, but if you have any study experience with sign language, this could be useful. There are different levels of signing shown: the skits themselves are very basic, with deliberate signing and carefully enunciated voicing; between the skits, a deaf and a hearing signer chat about what the skits will be presenting; they are harder to follow for people with less signing experience. However, DVD bits can be backed up, slowed down, repeated, and the entire DVD can be watched numerous times. Every time you see it, something new should click.",1215648000,,598,4.815533980582524
1883498,4,B00009KU71,"Lots of vocab on this DVD, but not enough to really start putting sentences together.  It's a great introduction to sign language.  I recommend it.",1200787200,,147,4.84
1883499,5,B00009KU71,"I am so far impressed with this video.  It must, however, be watched over and over to get the full benefits.  No way will one sitting do it.  I liked the way it was done and find it easier than I thought to pick up on signs.  I doubt that I will be an expert but will be much better prepared than before and will have some level of confidence. Worth the money.",1198368000,3,360,3.8904109589041096
1883500,5,B00009KU71,Very good production values and solid presentation of basic ASL.  A very good beginners starting point for learning ASL.  Excellent for repetitive practice.,1196640000,5,156,5.739130434782608
1883501,1,B00009KU71,Not a great way to start out learning sign language.  Very confusing and the DVD doesn't make it possible to skip the extra long introductions.  Returned this! No good.,1192752000,2,168,4.758620689655173
1883502,5,B00009KU71,I find the Getting started signing has been very beneficial to me in my journey to explore the ASL. I find it very informative and easy to follow. I look foward to the continued use I will receive from it.,1192665600,2,205,4.15
1883503,5,B00009KU71,"I thought this was a really effective learning product.  You are able to rewind if you miss something and the more you play it the better you get.  They teach a wide variety of words in sign and I found this to be excellent.  Do not buy the other DVD ""Say it with Sign"".  It is not as well put together and it is very repetive.  I found it to be confusing and useless.  This one is awesome.",1184198400,10,390,3.9358974358974357
1883504,3,B00009KU71,"The DVD is well done, but or they will repeat 2/3 time the same word which is good, or sometime they will go to fast which is frustrating because you do not have the time to see the hand mouvment nad so learn the word.

I wish the CD would have more explaination about how to bild a full sentence and no just focus on words.

Sould be a great tool for  an advanced begginer",1167782400,5,373,3.9466666666666668

 I am a beginner in sign language. This DVD is really the only ""lesson"" I've had in sign language.

 This program is great! It is jam-packed with vocabulary - they teach you around 800 signs! The content and lessons are very well organized and structured.

 The host of the show is a deaf woman signing ASL. The co-host is a man signing in English grammar structure. I love it that just about everyone on this DVD signs every word they speak. The host signs as a background voice translates for the viewer. This way you pick up more words as you watch the lessons over and over; you also get to see people interacting in sign language, putting it all together, instead of just learning a bunch of signs. Everyone signs at normal signing speed, so at first it is overwhelming. But as I have watched the program over and over, I can now pick out a lot of what they are signing.

 I only noticed two drawbacks of this program. One, the speed at which they sign the signs they are teaching you. I had to rewind a few times for the more complex ones. Two, during a couple of the skits the person ""learning"" signs from the deaf person didn't sign the exact same way. They did it backwards or with a different hand. I'm totally new to ASL, so I don't know how much precision is expected. It is confusing for a beginner either way.

 Despite the two small drawbacks, I give this program 5 stars. I am definitely buying the second volume!",1090800000,142,1822,4.403030303030303

7991072,5,B00009KU71,"This DVD has given me an understanding into American Sign Language that I never though I could grasp. I know a sign language interpreter, who when I used to see her sign, it all seemed like a blur, and I thought I, myself, could never even begin to understand the language. Because of this DVD, I am now confident enough to communicate with deaf people, and I did, with a co-worker. As the hosts sign, you hear a voice over of what they are signing, helping you to pick up words and concepts quickly, and easily.

The skits show everyday situations, of people fluent in sign Language, trying to teach to friends or family members. This really puts you in the character's shoes, because it's like having a private tutor teach you. Time of day, nouns, pronouns, the alphabet, numbers, initializing, concepts, all in one video. It's all taught at a wonderful pace, and it's perfect for beginners.

I've seen many people saying that this DVD does not give you the chance to review, or enough repetition, which may be true in certain situations. But, I discovered something that they didn't. On my DVD remote control, I have two buttons that they might not have had... A PAUSE button and a REWIND button. Somethings can be grasped on first pass, but obviously, the more advanced or confusing things need to be watched more than one time! It's impossible for the creators of the DVD to discern what every single customer would view as ""easy"", ""confusing"" or ""difficult"". Different people process information at different speeds, so if the DVD creators were to repeat everything two and three times, then it would be a 15 hour, three disc set, of only 90 minutes of information!

So don't get turned off from buying this because you might think it's too fast paced. Trust me, I rewound and paused quite a few times myself. And if you don't have a DVD player that rewinds and pauses, I'm sure you can find one somewhere on Amazon.",1299024000,5,1922,4.6304985337243405
7991073,1,B00009KU71,"I'm slowly going deaf at 44, so I'm looking into many different medias for self teaching.  I was excited about this dvd, but when I started it I was appalled that there were no captions.  I don't know enough sign language nor can I hear well enough to get anything from this.  So - if you can not hear, don't bother getting this dvd!",1280102400,4,333,4.171875
7991074,1,B00009KU71,I am glad you ask me to review the video.  It was terrible and waste of money.  I already understand a lot of sign and could not understand how the two people on this video could be teaching anyone anything.,1259539200,,207,4.15
7991075,2,B00009KU71,The signs are introduced too quickly and no opportunities for repetition or practice are offered. The producers of this video should have consulted someone competent in pedagogy.,1252281600,,178,5.62962962962963
7991076,4,B00009KU71,"I think this DVD is good, but it seems a little bit advanced for the first thing to do to learn ASL. The anchors are very little help, its in the scenes that I learn the most. But still, it starts a little bit more advanced than I wouldve liked.",1244419200,,245,3.92
7991077,4,B00009KU71,"This is a good program for beginning signers. The skits are very simple and clear. The hosts sign a little fast for a beginner, but by watching the program multiple times one can start to pick up on their signs too. These lessons also explain nouns, pronouns, verbs, numbers, and the alpabet.",1238630400,,292,4.634615384615385
7991078,4,B00009KU71,"This product has reviews to hold its own, but I'm pasting this here from my review of another product mentioned below just in case it will be helpful...

Because my 11 yr old (hearing impaired) daughter was raised using cued speech, she knows only a small amount of signing.  I thought it was time for her to learn to sign better, so I purchased three videos:
American Sign Language for Kids and Adults
Getting Started in Signing
I Want to Learn Sign Language (vol. 1 and 2)

""American Sign Language for Kids and Adults"" was the least helpful.  A LOT of time is spent on animal footage (I could go to a zoo for that).  We were frustrated as we watched a red panda roam for what seemed like 10 minutes between rapid signing lessons.  Yes, red pandas are cute, but the purpose to this video is to learn sign language.  I can get a National Geographic dvd on zoo animals if I want to study zoo animals.
The signing was given in spurts - rapidly between long periods of animal observation.  The host is dynamic, which also means he signs rapidly.  The subject matter is very narrow: all about animals, conservation, and the like.  Not much about school, friends, life in general.

The other two programs I purchased were well watching.  They cater to two different levels:
""I Want to Learn Sign Language"" (both volumes)was great for a younger audience (maybe up to 10 or 12 yrs old).  The program taught many signs relevant to childhood and is a great introduction to learning to sign.  The format is a woman teaching three children many signs so they can welcome their deaf cousin.  Almost the entire program is devoted to teaching signs.  The rate of instruction is perfect for younger children - not too rapid, and not agonizingly slow (except during the teaching of the alphabet, which many kids know already).
If you already know a fair amount of signing though, this program is not for you.  And don't expect to be fluent after it.  It is only a grand total of maybe 2 hrs of simple instruction if you get both volumes.

""Getting Started in Signing"" was my personal favorite, as a Mom with a hearing impaired child.  It used the allotted time well and taught a lot of signs.  It moved along more quickly than ""I Want to Learn Sign Language"" but not at a frantic pace.  I see that amazon has many good reviews on it, and I'm not surprised.  But in the end, I felt it was too short!  It is only 1 hr long, and you just can't learn as much signing as you need with only 1 hr of instruction.  It's too bad there aren't more episodes of these (other than the one that is already out there which reviewers say repeats a lot).

I have also searched online for ways to pick up more sign language - especially ways that will appeal to my daughter.
[...] is a great resource, but not exactly for young kids.  The host does not move his lips, and my daughter is accustomed to receiving information with hands AND mouth, so I will save using these lessons for later.  I applaud the creator of this website though!  It is free, has videos (as opposed to just sketches), and very thorough.

For what it's worth, I will mention a site we found that has actually been extremely helpful.  It is religious in nature, so if you don't go for that, then this is not for you.  The LDS church has a site where you can watch ASL renditions of their songs for children.  If you watch enough of these, you can pick up an awful lot of signing!  Most of these songs seem to be fairly generic Christian songs.  If another church or school did this, I would recommend it as well, but I haven't found anything like it.  Try it and see:
