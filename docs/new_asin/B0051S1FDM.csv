4525851,3,B0051S1FDM,"As a native Korean, I watched this film in a theatre in Seoul. The movie poster looked so weird but interesting, and I could not figure out at first what the story would be like. I just guessed that the movie would be very special, and it was so like  Miike Takeshi's in Japan. The movie also was not like other Korean films, because it was so graphic that the female character in the movie even cut off someone's head, which is not a oft-seen scene in other Korean films. The movie's background in time and space also was not clear, probably because the director did not intend to make the movie in a realistic way. To me, the movie seems a well-made cult-style film to show the director's story-telling skill and techniques well in an exaggerating way, and it should be noted that the story and background of the film look a little bit surreal to native Koreans like me. If you expect a history drama or realistic story in this movie, it does not fit your expectations, but it is a well-made one if you like cult films or Miike Takeshi's.",1314748800,5,1040,4.38860103626943
4525852,5,B0051S1FDM,"The movie builds up slowly, yet firm and steady. After the first hour, it has grabbed your guts without your even noticing it, and it simply won't let go until the very end. The story is quite over the top, that is very much true, but serves perfectly as a vehicle to trigger the deepest, most contradictory emotions. One feels sorry for the killer, feels good when she kills, just can't wait for the victims to be killed as painfully as possible. What a powerful film!! South Korean movie makers are, at this point, among the very best in the world, no doubt about it. Technically impeccable, they have mastered script writing, setting, directing, acting, and all aspects related to this art. Yes, it is entertainment, but is also art, and the most powerful one, as it is able to trigger such hidden, dark emotions. The last shot of the movie (this is not really a spoiler) of the woman body fusing with the profile of the island was so beautiful and unexpected that it truly gave me a real thrill. Then, the images and music as the end titles roll leave you with the most tender and saddest feelings after the almost unbearable realistic horror ride. Realistic not because of the blood, which is generous, but not over the top; realistic because of the way it touches and manipulates, for the best, our darkest emotions. Once again, I must say that Asian cinema is, nowadays, far, very far ahead of European and especially US cinema. Uncompromising, entertaining and always surprising...doesn't it sound just the opposite to the rutinary, boring and utterly predictable US movies?",1312329600,2,1582,4.756363636363637
4525853,4,B0051S1FDM,"This is a frustrating and even infuriating movie to watch, in a good way. You just can't believe the behavior that is going on and what has been/continues to be perpetrated on the protagonist(s). It's also more complex than a typical western film, where no character is perfect and the main protagonist generates ambivalent feelings. In general it is an engrossing drama, but not the best revenge film from Korea. That title, for me, belongs either to I Saw The Devil, Oldboy, Chaser, or A Bittersweet Life. This movie is right behind those, but it also not solely a revenge film. It's probably one you could watch with your girlfriend.",1451865600,,636,4.790909090909091

4525857,4,B0051S1FDM,"""Bedevilled"" is the definition of a challenging motion picture.  An unflinching portrait of a woman driven to madness by the endless neglect, cruelty and abuse she suffers on a remote island, actress Min-ho Hwang makes the audience feel every hateful word spit at her and every bit of violence pushed her way and we cannot help but cheer her on when she enacts her vengeance.

What works as powerfully as the lead performers, the lead's detractors are fittingly multi-layered in there portrayal of such despicable people, is that for the first hour it gradually builds the foundation of exhibiting this woman's pain through a catalogue of abuses. It is wrenching, unquestionably powerful material and the filmmakers have succeeded in taking you every step on her nightmarish journey.

When the main character becomes violent and turns the table on her captors the material could've easily fell into a slasher movie routine. Perhaps it does to a degree, but we are always feeling for her and the second half mostly works well because the emotional core of the story isn't sacrificed to the plentiful gore scenes which make up the last half. The unflinching reality that the fimmakers worked so hard to set-up in the opening hour is still at the forefront and it makes the terror the main character dispenses all the more dramatic and riveting. What is also noteworthy is that this motion picture is brave enough to discuss a variety of uncomfortable subjects within its narrative without it appearing sensationalistic or for simple shock value as many films are apt to do.

""Bedevilled"" is a potent 96 minutes followed by a strangely flat and drug out finale. These twenty minutes seem to sag with many of the scenes unnecessarily stretched out. It wants us to feel as wrung out as she is by this point but for some reason but there is just not enough story left by this point to do so.

The grainy cinematography, reminiscent of many B movie exploitation films from the past, only adds to the anguish laden dimension here. The original ""I Spit on Your Grave"" from 1978 comes to mind but this is far more character oriented. It seems like a slight to compare the two, as ""I Spit on Your Grave"" was all viciousness and unconcerned with character, but they both are undeniably effective on a purely visceral level.

For those looking for a real experience in human horror without the gimmicks the genre has turned to that forces you to look wide-eyed at the barbarity of man, ""Bedevilled"" is the experience you're craving.",1418428800,2,2519,4.819444444444445

Seo Young-hee brilliantly portrays Bok-nam; a young mother who is treated with unimaginable cruelty by her husband, her husband's brother, and four other adult inhabitants on a very small island off the Korean coast.

Bok-nam  is forced to live as a beast of burden, performing hard labor, including digging up potatoes and gathering honey. There are several devilish characters, crafty and wicked. Only Bok-nam's daughter, about ten, shows compassion for her.

Ji Sung-won convincingly plays Hae-won, a friend of Bok-nam who moved to Seoul several years before the story begins. There's an intriguing backstory about Hae-won and Bok-nam. Now, Bok-nam desperately begs her erstwhile friend for help.

4525868,4,B0051S1FDM,"It really makes me want to spit when a movie verges on being great only to drop the ball on the five yard line. That's the case here.

Here's the scoop. Hae won came from an Island off South Korea to mainland Seoul at a young age. She now works for a bank as is moderately successful but not a really nice person. After a violent office incident she is put on leave. An old friend from the Island, Kim Bok-nom, has been begging her to come visit. She takes this time off to do so, and when she gets there she finds the situation to be less than idyllic.  Her friend, though trying to keep a pleasant demeanor, is unraveling from mental, physical and sexual abuse at the hands of her husband and his brother. She gets no support from the other Islanders or the authorities and one incident drives her over the edge.

Up until the climax, this is on of the best movies I've ever seen. The treatment of women is at the heart of things. Hae won's inability (unwillingness?) to finger some thugs who beat up and disfigured a young girl. The treatment her friend receives with no one to turn to for help, and how a seemingly lovely Island is home to such unspeakable acts, builds from the get-go. Kim Bok-nom's husband is a brute. He doles out violence and sexual abuse with impunity. He brings prostitutes to the Island and into his home with his wife right outside the door. He may be sexually abusing her daughter as well. The other women (granny is the nastiest, meanest woman on the planet) not only give her no sympathy whatsoever, they're nearly as mean to her as her husband. That she finally breaks is of little wonder. That's when things fall apart. The beginning of her rampage is very good. Watching her mete out revenge is great for the soul. But when she needs to confront hubby it turns into a cheese-ball Hollywood B flick. This continues when she hits the mainland and goes after Hae won. It's stupid beyond the meaning of the word. How did the producers/writer/director all lose their sensibilities so completely?

Up until the goof-ball climax this is a great movie by any standard. It's extremely well written, acted and directed and well worth the time to view.",1372291200,,2176,4.487373737373737

When a long time friend, Hae-won, comes to visit only by the request of Kim, you would think a saviour is on her way. But when Kim's daughter is accidentally killed, and Hae-won turns the other cheek...well, all hell breaks loose.

4525871,3,B0051S1FDM,"Kim Bok-nam Salinsageonui Jeonmal (Bedevilled) (Chul-soo Jang, 2010)

You all know the story--or at least the beginning of it. In 1790, a British ship called the Bounty foundered on the rocks near what is now Pitcairn Island. Its captain, William Bligh, supposedly went stir-crazy after a time and had to be deposed by a number of mutineers, headed by one Fletcher Christian. The mutineers eventually settled on Pitcairn, with Polynesian wives, and founded a country, or at least a British protectorate. (For what it's worth, Bligh and the loyalists were, in fact, let go, and founded nearby Norfolk Island.) Then began two hundred years of the Brits intermarrying and adapting to what Colleen McCullogh, whose husband hails from Pitcairn, infamously called ""indigenous customs"" involving the roles of women in society. There was a big blow-up last decade that ended with the first trial in Pitcairn history, with six men convicted of thirty-three counts of, had they been Americans, various degrees of statutory rape. The trial, and the inevitable media flurry, focused on the sexual assaults, but there was more than that; women were treated as mere objects, little more than chattel. (Any wonder why every woman who accused the men was no longer living on Pitcairn, most of them having fled to New Zealand?)

I'm not certain that's the basis for Bedevilled, a film that at least one review I read today claimed ""revitalized Korean horror"" (I didn't realize Korean horror needed revitalizing; the past few years have brought us Arang, Epitaph, and The Red Shoes, among others), but the parallels are chilling. Of course, the movie is also well-informed by seventies rape-revenge flicks (Americans will be most familiar with I Spit on Your Grave, naturally, but the seventies rape-revenge thriller was a global phenomenon, at least briefly), but you put a woman and her daughter on a remote, sparsely-populated island and have the entire male population treat her like a slave (and all the older women forcing her to do their share of the work)? It may look Korean (despite the rather ridiculous make-up jobs), but it sure smells like Pitcairn, especially when the woman's husband starts making eyes at the daughter. But I'm getting well ahead of myself.

Plot: Hae-won (Harmony's Seong-won Ji) works at a large bank in Seoul. Things start going bad for her afer she witnesses a crime, and both her work and personal lives suffer. Her boss forces her to take a vacation, so she heads off to see her childhood friend Bok-nam (The Chaser's Yeong-hie Seo). Bok-nam is thrilled to see her, but Hae-won quickly realizes something's wrong; the entire population of the island, save a senile old grandfather, treats Bok-nam like dirt. Hae-won begins to bond with Bok-nam's daughter, Yeon-hee (Ji-eun Lee in her feature debut), but Yeon-hee is almost of an age where she can start assisting her mother in doing all the other inhabitants' work. Bok-nam, who seems resigned to her own fate, is desperate to save her daughter--but Hae-won, cold, distant, and saddled with her own problems, is reluctant to get involved. That is, of course, assuming the island's inhabitants are willing to let her leave in the first place...

The main problem with Bedevilled is that it's too long. The climactic scene happens just halfway into the film, which leads to the big third-act denouement, but then the film keeps going, mostly to wrap up some unanswered questions. All well and good, except that segment goes, oh, twenty minutes, contains yet another big twist (that really didn't need to be there), etc. On the other hand, with the exception of some pacing problems (setting the climax where it is is synecdochic, not an anomaly), the first two-thirds of the movie are captivating--well-acted, gorgeously-shot, and with some darn fine screenwriting courtesy Kwang-young Choi (Secret Reunion). This was only the guy's second script--I can't wait to see what he's capable of once he's mastered the art of trimming. But if you are okay with the whole rape-revenge theme (I will warn you that at least one scene, about twenty minutes into the film, is probably triggering) and you like a lot of character development in your drama/thrillers (I wouldn't call this a horror film at all), then Bedevilled should be right up your alley. ***",1359763200,,4317,5.033566433566434
4525872,2,B0051S1FDM,This would have been a great find had it been in english or atleast had engligh subtitles. Although you could follow what was going on pretty much with no direct communication to the film it really took away from it!,1358640000,,216,4.425
4525873,5,B0051S1FDM,"Actually there are a lot of good Korean movies but this one is one of the most recent ones I've had the chance to watch. Bedevilled is a movie about 2 Women. One who lives in the city and is cold hearted and self centered. She's only concerned about herself and has little regard to how other people feel. The movie begins with Hae-won coldly turning down a loan for a desperate elderly woman. As a result she has a trick played on her by one of the maintenance workers that don't quite agree with her attitude. The entire mishap causes her to assault and blame one of her coworkers who is a lot more kind hearted and concerned about the companies clients. She ends up being forced to take a ""leave"" from work. Along the journey we get to see more of her cold attitude where she witnesses a crime and doesn't care enough to point out the people who did it even though the father of the victim begs her too. She just carries on about her life unconcerned.

 Hae-won has no where to go on her vacation so she decides to visit the island where her Grandfather lived and where she spent part of her childhood. The island is isolated from the mainland and the community there holds their fare share of secrets. When Hae-won arrives at the island she is visited by her childhood friend Bok-nam. The two girls were once very close but over time drifted apart. Mostly this was forced by Hae-won who never bother to read the letter Bok-nam sent her. On the island Hae-won spends her time learning about how much has changed over time little by little. Bok-nam is a kind hearted woman but is treated like dirt and looked down on by the entire community. They refer to her as ""b#@ch"" and or ""stupid b#@ch"", and make her do the bulk of the labor on the island. Bok-nam is also shared by her husband and her husbands brother who rapes her when he wills it. Bok-nam's husband openly cheats on her by hiring prostitutes and sleeping with them in the presence of herself and her child. There is no respect at all for Bok-nam who is really just a desperate woman that wants to leave the island with her daughter for a better life but can't due to her abusive husband and community that keeps holding her back from leaving.

Eventually Hae-won learns about Bok-nam's situation but does little to nothing at all to intervene other than deciding she would like to return home to Seoul early. Bok-nam beg's Hae-won to take her and her daughter with her but she declines and when Bok-nam tells her a sad truth Hae-won accuses her for being a liar. Bok-nam then deperately tries to escape on her own but is caught by her abusive husband who brutally beats her in front of her daughter. That's when the story takes it's turn and story of vengeance begins.

Overall Bedevilled is a great movie because it's the first time it shows just how truly selfish some people are. The main character in this movie is just that and even after witnessing a murder she will ignore it and act as though she didn't see a thing just to protect herself. There is a lot of despair and also satisfaction in the film but the ending really speaks volumes as to just who Hae-won is. You find out at the end (maybe a spoiler or not it's not exactly put upfront in the movie) that Bok-nam proteced Hae-won as a kid. She was stronger than her and looked after her. One day when the two are attacked by a group of boys Bok-nam fights them off while Hae-won runs. Unfortunately Bok-nam ends up getting hit over the head and knocked out where she is then sexually molested by the boys. Hae-won just sits behind a tree staring and not attempting to get help.

Hae-won has been a ""unkind"" person her entire life and towards the end Bok-nam tries to tell her that. Sadly for Bak-nam everyone has been unkind to her as long as she's been alive. Her only joys in life were her childhood friend Hae-won who turned out to be worthless and her daughter whom she couldn't protect. Every man (but the old guy) she has met has either treated her like dirt or a sex object so the movie hints when she meets someone that isn't from the island and they're kind to her.

Bedevilled could be a horror movie,could be a drama, could be suspense, could be a tragic story but really it's all of the above. The only part that the movie didn't play out on was if Bok-nam was in love with Hae-won or if she was just mind warped from seeing another woman that wasn't broken down from working fields all day.

Overall this is a good movie well worth watching!",1358035200,2,4481,4.378605769230769
4525874,5,B0051S1FDM,"Bedevilled follows Hae-won, a stressed and angry banker, as she returns to Mudo, an isolated island in which she spent her childhood, for vacation. She is welcomed by her childhood friend, Bok-nam; Bok-nam is treated like a slave by her abusive husband and disrespected daily by the elderly islanders. Eventually, Bok-nam tries to escape which results in tragedy- and she finally snaps with brutal force. Bedevilled is a brutal and haunting revenge thriller.

Bedevilled has a dark and brutal story; although Hae-won is a significantly character, Bok-nam really takes center stage. The brutality in this film doesn't only come from her vicious vengeance; Bok-nam is vividly beaten and raped throughout the film without any help, even from her ""childhood friend"". Some of these scenes will infuriate; in fact, the entire film, especially the ending, may leave you shocked/angry. (this feeling will probably be most evident in those that haven't experience South Korean cinema yet.) I won't spoil the ending, all I will say is: I love endings that leave an impact, and this one definitely accomplishes that goal. (stay for the scene during the credits for a more thought-provoking experience.) The acting was great, the direction was brilliant, and the music was amazing. (I really loved the song at the credits.)

Overall, Bedevilled is an amazing revenge thriller that manages to leave the audience shocked and unsettled- emotionally and mentally. For fans of films like ""Oldboy"" and ""I Saw The Devil, this is a gem waiting to be found and watched. As of 12/25/12, this film is available on Netflix Streaming, but a purchase is highly recommended.

4525878,5,B0051S1FDM,"""Bedevilled"" is a beast of a movie coming from South Korea, the land of extraordinary film making (Just had to add that in). It takes us into the life of a very small community of islanders (9-10 people) that basically live by they're own rule. It is brutal, heart breaking, sad and horrifying all rolled into one great revenge film.

Hae-won is a young and stressed woman due to her job and a crime she witnessed. When she finally explodes at work her boss makes her take a vacation at which time she decides its best to get away. She takes a trip to where she grew up, Moodo Island, where she reconnects with her childhood friend Bok-nam who has a daughter of her own. As she settles in she notices that Bok-nam is treated like a slave by the whole community and is mistreated daily by her abusive boyfriend Man-Jong but yet never comes to her aid. One day Bok-nam tries to escape with her daughter only to get caught by Man-Jong.
In a violent struggle Bok-nams daughter is accidentally killed by Man-Jong prompting the community to cover up what really happened when an investigator is called in. Bok-nam finally losing her last straw, goes on a murderous rampage to exact revenge on those that have done her wrong and the people responsible for the death of her daughter, including her childhood friend Hae-won.

I absolutely loved this film. It shows how one person can be pushed around their whole life and finally snap when the one thing they loved the most is taken away from them. It tests the bonds of friendship and takes betrayal to a different level. It is a very violent and some what gory film that will suck you in and have you rooting for this poor abused woman as she cuts her way through this abusive community.

I really can't say anything bad about ""Bedevilled"" at all and recommend you pick up a copy and enjoy this South Korean masterpiece.",1351296000,5,1863,4.5222551928783385
4525879,5,B0051S1FDM,"This motion picture brings forth the intensity of emotions and brutality into a solid collaboration of film making. The cinematography is sharp, clean, and skillfully shot. The characters give true to life performances that make you love, hate, or pity them. In particular actress Seo Young-hee turns out an extraordinary performance as the character Bok-nam who is a woman scorned to the highest degree. The things she must endure as well as the situations she is put through on the island are jagged and perturbing. As previously mentioned, her performance is stellar.

The pacing of this motion picture is first-class. Nothing comes off as rushed or tacked on. The plot is given enough time for character development and set up for various events that unfold. This is a revenge thriller yet the elements of revenge are enacted differently than others of this genre, which therefore ultimately puts more emphasis on the ""thriller"" aspect of the movie than anything else. The violence in the film is of a pragmatic style and used primarily when necessary to emphasize the moments of frustration and intense emotion carried by the cast of characters. Similar to other international films like ""I Saw the Devil"" and ""Old Boy"" this film challenges the viewer in many areas. It creates tension for the audience and gives a sense of uneasiness whilst simultaneously creating a yearning of justice for the main character. It gives a ""thrill"" so to speak, thus providing the viewer a run for their money. By the film's conclusion you will have gained something new from the overall cinematic experience.

Overall this is an entertaining motion picture that should not be missed. If you like being challenged as a cinema viewer and looking for raw, intense film-making, and stellar acting performances, then this is for you. However, if you are an oversensitive, timid movie watcher (which there is more than ever these days) then you're better off in the safety zone of PG-13 films.

Highly Recommended for Open-Minded Thick-Skinned Audiences!",1351209600,,2037,5.092814371257485

I saw this one, just 1 day after watching some american movie. Difference like day and night. The american flick a slick production, everything perfect, and the same old rehashed formula. Like 2000 movies before and 2000 movies after. But then you watch something like ""Bedevilled""  and it just shakes you. It literally wakes you up and makes you think about this world, this existence what we call Life. How many movies achieve that? If there were 6 stars, I would rate this move 6 stars. I saw it coming, almost 10 years ago, when I was on a trip to East Asia. I knew then that in the future the creative center, not necessarily the successful center, in the entertainment world, would shift slowly to East Asia. Movies like this(in my humble opinion) prove me right. In any case, a warning about Bedevilled: ""This ain't for the Faint of Heart""!",1350086400,4,1005,4.646067415730337
4525881,5,B0051S1FDM,"I have the South Korean blu-ray for ""Bedevilled"" that was released on July 15, 2011 and that blu-ray delivers on all fronts. The film itself is a very powerful and intense study of suffering, reaching your limit and brutal, savage revenge. South Korean cinema never ceases to amaze and astound me. If you enjoyed South Korean films like ""Howling"", ""Helpless"", ""The Chaser"", ""The Isle"", ""Memories of Murder"", ""Mother"", ""Secret Sunshine"", ""Mowhere To Hide"", ""Old Boy"", ""Sympathy For Mr. Vengeance"", and ""Lady Vengeance"", then ""Bedevilled"" is right up your alley. I will buy Well Go Usa's blu-ray in appreciation for them releasing this intense film in the United States. I REALLY HOPE that Well Go USA picks up the South Korean film ""Howling"" (2012) next, starring Song Kang-Ho (who starred in films like ""The Host"", ""Memories of Murder"", ""Hindsight"", ""Thirst"", ""The Quiet Family"", ""Secret Sunshine"" and ""Sympathy For Mr. Vengeance""). ""Bedevilled"" and ""Howling"" are MUST-SEE films! South Korea's ""Helpless"" and ""The Cat"" aka ""Two Eyes That See Death"" are also 2 newer South Korean films worth seeing. Don't hesitate, ""Bedevilled"" is not to be missed and it is a MUST-OWN blu-ray; it is not rental fodder.",1349568000,9,1202,5.1692307692307695

8453145,5,B0051S1FDM,"How can I start?
I am not biased. I hate Park Chan Wook other then <OLDBOY><STOKER> I think all the other films of his is just pure waste. Meaning, It is not the fact that this movie was made in Korea that I am crazy about it is the quality of this film and I am madly in love with the director Chul-soo Jang I personally think that he is better then Ki Duck Kim or any other new wave filmmaker from Asia 21the century. Period.

WON AFI, Amsterdam, Austin Fantastic film Festival, Fantasforto, went to Canne and people hailed big time.

This movie
1. People are very primitive in a bad way. 2. It is a man's world even the woman think that woman is a subordinate of man. 3. Two women : One goes to the city and a city girl one stays in the island and rot to hell. 4. husband and husband's younger brother treat that woman like a slave and one day she will be burst like a bomb we all know that. 5. The scenary is breathtakinly beautiful and the usage of the sunlight make our eyes blind.
6. I don't blieve that they only used 700,000$ for making this film It can't be true.

The story is about two women. They grew up together one very pretty white skinned modern looking who goes to the capital city and be modernized.
The other stays at the deserted island not even has a lot ot land phone. Even women thinks that women should be dependant to man and they should be obedient to man, their husband at all time.
The woman named Kim Bok Nam has a horrible life, she was raped by a bunch of hobos and had a girl before marrying to her husband.
The husband constantly hit her as if he is treating a toy or something. He even calls this whole and have sex in front of her. Even the mother of that husband let him do that only thing she says is how can you let your husband do that? Let me say how dare you let your son do that you B%&*.
The younger brother of the husband constantly half rape the woman whenever the husband and stepfather goes fishing.
She is almost raped. I think she just want to get done with it each time that happens.
Now that the friend from the city has problem at her work, she visits the friend which she haven't for a long time, trouble came with the wind.
The husband's brother tries to rape her by giving her a sleeping pill inside the water.
But the friend protects her.
Then a lot ot violent from the husband. And then came along the fact that the stepfather is having a sexual relationship with the 10 year old daughter and the mother cannot stand anymore.
She decides to leave the place with the daughter.
But when the father figures this out they came to stop her and accidentally kills the daughter.
NOW THERE IS ABSOLITELY NOTHING TO LOOSE.
She grabs a straw cutter- a huge knife that you will piss on your pants right away if you see it- and kills the whole people in town who says bad things to her something like you are a whole, you are worthless and your husband is an angel to keep you with the unknown seed of your daughter you should thank your husband for that. We don't believe that the father is doing anything to the daughter. And so on.
She then kills the mother.
And then the husband in the most brutal way.

The Original title of the film is The Circumstances of the Kim Bock Nam's murder.

If you watch this film you will be madly in love with the beauty if the island's beauty, the camera and lights, the great acting of Min-Ho Hwang and all the other actors.",1474588800,,3408,4.173252279635259
8453146,4,B0051S1FDM,"Be careful of reading some reviews here, as they contain immense spoilers.

This is a film for those who love revenge flicks that go totally brutal, and don't mind the Korean way of doing revenge, which is not always how American audiences prefer it. Nuff said there.

Two women, once childhood friends on a sparsely populated, remote island, encounter each other again when the one who got away from the island returns. Their lives turned out differently. Without spoiling, I will say the one left behind suffers indignities and tortures as the island slave, basically. She's treated with utter contempt by everyone, including husband/relatives/neighbors.

Then a turn of events brings all the fury in the enslaved woman to action.

I didn't find the ending satisfying, hence the one-star removed, and this is a HARD movie to watch if you are not accustomed to seeing folks dehumanized. Very hard. But then, that's what makes revenge flicks enjoyable: seeing the downtrodden or put upon or damaged or victimized turn tables.

Harsh, well-done revenge flick.",1473465600,2,1058,5.127906976744186
8453147,5,B0051S1FDM,"A beautiful but ice-cold loan officer (Ji Sung-won) returns to the island where she grew up and becomes reaquainted with her childhood friend, Bok-nam (Seo Young-hee), who has been begging her to come visit.  The reason becomes clear--she longs to escape with her daughter from her debased existence as the slave of the small island community, raped by her husband and brother-in-law and reviled by the gaggle of old women they support.

There are many shades to this drama that can be overshadowed by its more sensational aspects.  The potential dangers of the unrestrained male id.  The ways the sins and tragedies of the past can poison the future.  The desire to forget and deny the place and the people in ones past.  Seo Young-hee gives a tour-de-force performance; she shows us an essentially sunny and good-hearted woman, and then allows us to feel the tragedy as the last vestiges of hope and humanity are squeezed out of her.  Despite all the physical abuse heaped on her, a more cruel betrayal sets the stage for a devastating finale.  A very moving film, but not a pleasant watch.",1464998400,,1092,4.802139037433155
