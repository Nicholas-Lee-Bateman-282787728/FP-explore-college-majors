8531175,4,B008VR7UAM,"A no-frills Italian thriller-- purportedly based on true events-- 'Killer Cop' (aka 'La polizia ha le mani legate,' 1975), though at times overacted and budget-challenged, nonetheless fits nicely into the 'French Connection' mold of gritty police flicks of the period.  The print is a bit washed out in places, but Raro's restoration is mainly commendable and the disc features a surprisingly informative interview with production manager Alessandro Calosci.  Package also includes a full color booklet with essay.  Film rates 3-plus stars, presentation 4.",1456531200,4,556,5.674698795180723
