2318425,5,B0009SW83A,"I never buy series because i have a difficult time watching programs more than once, but Felicity is an exception. Felicity reminds me of the struggles of moving away from home and going to college. Felicity is a mush see show that brings fond memories of my past. I wish there were more than 4 seasons.",1286236800,5,303,4.428571428571429
2318426,5,B0009SW83A,I loved this series on television and I'm so happy that I'm able to watch Felicity as she goes through college again with these DVDs.  The episodes are well written and very clever.  One of my all time favorite shows!  I can't stop watching!,1282348800,3,241,4.431818181818182
2318427,5,B0009SW83A,"I remember when I used to watch Felicity years ago when my daughter was younger. When I received my DVD's, we were so excited. It took us weeks to see all of them because we only watched them when she visited me on Fridays (she is in going to a University an hour from home). We watched them for hours until 2 or 3 in the morning. I love the all the characters. Kerry Russell is so believable as a shy, sheltered girl going to New York as a Freshman and evolving into an outgoing young lady as she graduates. Her tribulations with Ben and Noel are honest and heartfelt. The extra scenes were also fun to watch. Especially between Russel and Speedman who were actually dating while filming the show and broke up after the show ended. In closing, I would like to say that I think she should of picked Noel from the get go. Ben was always to selfish for her but my daughter loved all the drama between the three of them. Loved this show.",1276560000,5,934,4.223463687150838
2318428,1,B0009SW83A,"WHY would anyone pay close to 300 dollars for this??  You can buy each season brand new for 45.99 each...
There's only four seasons, so why would you pay an extra 100+ dollars to have them all wrapped up together?
Nice work Amazon, brilliant.",1191283200,5,242,4.5
2318429,5,B0009SW83A,"I only started to watch this series as it was on after Buffy.  It didn't take too long before I was hooked.  I proceeded to get my mother and my sister hooked and to this day we still take a snowy winter weekend, pop in the DVD's and watch the eps back to back.  It is too bad that the original music is changed as copyright won't allow.  The music was an actual character to the show and moved the emotions along, but nothing changes the fact that the directing, acting, writing and overall chemistry of this show was phenomenal and I have struggled to find a fufilling replacement since.  Grey's Anatomy is the closest I have found with that innner struggle that so defeats our main girl.  Oh, and the VO's at the beginning are kinda similar too!!!

Buy these...you won't regret a moment of it.  Well, you may regret all the things you could've been doing while you're glued to the TV watching these unforgettable shows.",1143849600,17,922,4.446428571428571
2318430,5,B0009SW83A,The first season and the beggining of the second I saw on the portuguese television and I always have wondered how it would end ... I simply love this series!!!,1142985600,3,160,4.366666666666666
2318431,5,B0009SW83A,"I think the only way u can truley appreciate the collection is if u r a true fan of Felicity..which i am, and i loved it...i can pretty much say i will be watching it over and over again",1124150400,9,186,3.7948717948717947
2318432,5,B0009SW83A,I first saw this series on Netflix and I loved it. The story  re-lived the college days in me. Netflix stopped showing it so I bought my ownn copy.,1412121600,,147,4.068965517241379
2318433,5,B0009SW83A,"I've been obsessed with ""Felicity"" since the first episode came out...
With its romantic New York City settings...I absolutely fell in love with all the characters.
Remember those movies or TV shows you feel that everything the characters say just totally relates to how you feel? It was all that.!!!
Felicity has a lot of quotes that can really get us thinking.
I was devastated when it was over. What was I going to do with myself now that ""Ben and Felicity"" were out of my life..
Finally after years i have the box (not available in Holland) set so i can rewatch my favorite show over and over again. LOVE IT....!!!",1411344000,3,618,4.526785714285714

2318437,1,B0009SW83A,"Fair warning, you are NOT purchasing what it advertises, which is Felicity Seasons 1-4 with Seasons 1, 2, and 4 being six-disc sets and Season 3 being a five-disc set, for a total of 23 discs.  Instead, you are paying for the 3-disc sets (which do not have the same menus as the original, which have different music than the original disc sets, etc.)  Please be clear, if you are looking for the original disc sets, these are NOT them.  The picture is completely wrong.  I ordered mine just the other day and turned right around and sent them in for a full refund.",1391040000,26,564,4.394230769230769
2318438,5,B0009SW83A,I enjoyed watching the Felicity series without any commercials.  This is one of favorite TV series ever!  I definitely recommend.,1390521600,,129,5.4
2318439,5,B0009SW83A,"My aunt ordered the entire collection of Felicity, since she was a fan in the good old days. The price was great for all of the DVDs. The shipping time was as described, and they came very well protected. If you're Felicity fans, then here's you're greatest treasure. Don't' hesitate and get them here. It truly is a great BUY!",1389830400,,327,4.466666666666667

Such a disappointment with the quality of the picture",1388793600,,114,4.2272727272727275
2318441,3,B0009SW83A,I love the series but the first CD of the first season is scratched. Returning the purchase would be more annoying than keeping the scratched disk.,1386028800,,147,4.6923076923076925
2318442,5,B0009SW83A,It was a joy to recall old episodes and renew an acquaintance with the characters.  Loved the alternate ending as well!,1381708800,,119,4.666666666666667
2318443,5,B0009SW83A,Enjoyed this show so much and was so sad to see it go!  Wish they could have continued it for a long time more.,1351987200,,111,3.625
2318444,5,B0009SW83A,I absolutely love this show. After it ended i was devestated. I know that seems extreme but i really do think this show is great. i ordered it a few years ago. I think I have seen the series 4x's since its end. and now i find myself watching it on Netflix. I cant get away from it. and i don't want to. I never went to college. and everytime I watch this show I feel like I am right there with them. Not to mention i love all the characters. I loved all the story lines. I cry every time i see the happy and sad episodes. Its like i know whats going to happen. I know how it ends and yet still i feel every single emotion i have felt since i watched each show air on their original dates back when the show was on. I can see myself watching this one day when im in my 80s still feeling these emotions. Because while i know its just t.v. the storylines are real life situations that happen in everyday life of real people. Would HIGHLY recommend this to anyone who asked.,1329955200,7,970,4.005154639175258
2318445,5,B0009SW83A,"As a 44 year old woman, I could still identify with the characters and the nature of this show. I was so reluctant to watch this show, thinking it was a silly teenie bopper show...one with a shallow script that appealed only to young girls or boys. I was however addicted to this from show number one until the amazing ending. What a journey it was. This show explores pretty much every aspect of the human condition and does so brilliantly using splendid cinematography, wardrobe, script, characters, etc. It is a show that will evoke every emotion from joy and fear to laughing and crying. I just wish I could watch another 4 seasons. Felicity's journal through her college years with her friends and family and life in general, was amazing. This is in my top 5 TV series of all times. I am just amazed I never discovered it before. I watched on Netflix streaming. I cried when it ended. Good, good stuff, regardles of your age.",1328486400,3,930,4.541666666666667
2318446,2,B0009SW83A,"The theme you carry away from this series is ""everybody cheats."" I'm not kidding. Every single relationship in this movie falls apart in various places because they cheat on each other. The first season was the best. At least the music was good, and the acting was decent. After the first season, they started making a soundtrack that was all pop music that the men are listening to in their apartments and it is really bad cheesy. In the fourth season, they play this melancholy piano melody in EVERY episode. It got to where I was fast forwarding through the sections with the piano melody in it. All in all, the entire show was just a massive let down. The first season was enjoyable, and I will probably watch it again. After that, it's all depression and heartbreak and cheating and misery. Continually. Not my cup of tea.",1320364800,3,827,4.594594594594595
2318447,5,B0009SW83A,"Bought this for my wife, she was a big fan and when we got Netflix and started watching them all (again)-she had to have the ""Hard Copy"" of them. She says it makes her feel like she's actually living the experience of going to college and rooming with all those people.",1318291200,5,269,4.294117647058823
2318448,5,B0009SW83A,My best friend had recommended me to watch this tv series and i have t say that i fell in love with it. It is the type of tv series that i can watch over and over again.i fell in love with almost every character especially Felicity! i had to buy all four seasons! i will recommend this to every one! Im not really good at describing but basically is about Felicity and how her life and her friends lives change as they go through the process of college. You won't regret watching this tv series or owning it ;-),1317686400,3,511,4.12
2318449,5,B0009SW83A,I ORDERED THE FELICITY SERIES SEVERAL MONTHS AGO AND FORGOT TO GIVE A REVIEW.  I RECEIVED THE COMPLETE SET OF SEASONS ONE THROUGH FOUR IN RECORD TIME.  I WOULD RECOMMEND ORDERING THROUGH AMAZON TO EVERYONE!,1305763200,,206,4.857142857142857
2318450,5,B0009SW83A,"Being aleady a ""Felicity"" fan, I actualy bought something I already knew and liked. Therfore no room for suprise. Unfortunately, my DVD player is coded for European DVDs, therefore the only way to enjoy this amazing life story was by watching it on my computer (nevermind it worked just fine!)",1296000000,,293,4.88
2318451,1,B0009SW83A,"I purchased a copy of this back in 2007, it was a gift for a friend, As it turns out it was a counterfeit copy made in China.  Beware if you buy.",1295049600,2,145,3.53125

8066363,5,B0009SW83A,I have never seen this show. They don't show reruns of the series ever so it was nice to watch the whole series. My sister had the first season but I couldn't find the rest. So I bought the whole series from this buyer. The DVDs were all new copies wrapped in plastic and everything. If you are one of those people who loves this series you must buy. This was a gift from my sister to me. It was wonderful and the Seller selling the series was very pleasant and shipping was quick. A must buy if you ever loved this series or have never seen it before. I love Scott Speedman and his relationship with Felicity was just so real. Five stars!!!!,1499644800,,642,4.185483870967742

8066365,4,B0009SW83A,"This review is NOT for the DVD set but for the series itself.

Even just thinking about this series immediately and always elicits an emotional response in me - not only because of the time and place it's set in being something so relatable for me, personally, but also because the cast was just amazing. Keri Russel is truly an astounding, gifted actress - far too often overlooked in favor of others who can't hope to come close to her acting skills. And of course the constant tug-of-war between her two love interests, both gorgeous in their own right and played by actors who fit the bill so well you couldn't begin to imagine anyone else in their roles.

For any girl who came of age in the 90s, this show is simply a must-have!",1467072000,,734,4.42962962962963
