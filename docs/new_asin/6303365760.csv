7847410,4,6303365760,Fun to watch the skiing now that I'm a Florida boy. But who's got a VCR anymore?,1470960000,,80,3.764705882352941
7847411,3,6303365760,The other video of basics was far more informative and helpful ~ this seemed too repetitive and became boring ~ I mistakenly ordered VHS instead of DVD in both.  Will be more careful in the future.,1359849600,,197,4.472222222222222
7847412,3,6303365760,"Place the video in the player, lie back and relax.  ""Cross Country Skiing"" by Jeff Nowak, shows traditional / classic nordic skiing technique best to a novice to intermediate level skier. The presentation is one of continuous motion, where the viewer is left to soak up the proper biomechanics and kenetics.  Thus, some skiing experience is required to empathize with the motion, but (as mentioned by other people's reviews) strong intermediate, advanced+ skiers will always want more.  To be fair, there is only so much that one can put on a video. I think novice-intermediate skiers will find the video helpful if they are in a receptive state",987984000,,645,4.953703703703703
7847413,3,6303365760,"This is an instructional video geared towards an enthusiastic  beginner to novice classic skier. If you are a keen cross-country skier starting out then give this video a try.
Not exactly something you can show to non-skiing friends, the presentation of nordic skiing is very old school.  You will have to upgrade to another video at an intermediate level for better instruction and motivation.",987724800,,394,5.140625
7847414,5,6303365760,"I checked this out from the library, and loved it; now I'm buying it!  Nothing has improved my classic skiing technique as much as watching this video.  It may not suit the needs of a beginner with a strong aural learning style (who needs to be told what to do), but for intermediate skiers, or anyone with a visual or kinesthetic learning style, I think this is the most helpful tool I've ever seen.  The neuro-muscular programming approach helps you to develop a ""body memory"" of the right motion, even before you've actually done it.  After watching this tape, I find I can go out on the track and feel when I'm ""in the groove"" that Jeff nowak demonstrates.  Besides being very effective, it's absolutely beautiful photography, and very meditative and relaxing.  I didn't want to take the tape back to the library!",986515200,3,817,4.678321678321678
7847415,2,6303365760,"This video, like many before it, have prefered to depict the activity as quiet, restful, and meditative.  This video is useful to teach beginners to  classic ski provided you have an instructor doing the narration; otherwise  you may just put the class to sleep.
Today the consumer has MTV...  Warren Miller (Alpine), Christian Begin (Mountain Biking) and xczone  (Cross-country) films-videos to choose from.
I found Cross Country  Skiing by Jeff Nowak in the library. Compare with some modern titles... you  be the judge.",967075200,3,522,5.216867469879518
7847416,1,6303365760,I was expecting to get some pointers for developing skills in c/country skiing.  There was no verbal instruction ...only an hour long video showing a man skiing.  I shared this video with another cross-country skier who  also felt this video had no merit for someone wanting to learn skills. I  want a video that gives instructional tips.,924134400,43,338,4.87719298245614
