631049,5,6303363598,I saw this several years ago on a copy of a copy in VHS.  It was well done for DVD.  I especially love being able to watch it in Japanese with english subtitles.  The only way to view this!  Well worth the money spent.  My  only wish is that it had the option for w-i-d-e screen.,920851200,,279,3.892857142857143
631050,5,6303363598,"Of all the fantasy setting animation, Record of Lodoss War has to be the best I've seen.  The plot is understandable, but has many different layers.  The characters are delightfully round, and you are able to see them grow  and learn as the story progresses.  I've heard Lodoss War described as  ""Dungeons and Dragons"" in a movie - that's not too far off.  The  same epic feel of fate hinging on the actions of a few individuals is  present throughout.  The most endearing thing about the tale is the  interaction between the characters.  The gruff dwarven warrior harassing  the slim elven beauty, who in turn flirts with the young man aspiring to  knighthood...the personal side of the characters really shines through.  The entire series can be a bit expensive, but I think it well worth the  money.",918950400,,802,4.751824817518248

631121,4,6303363598,"I can see why this piece of old-school anime is considered a fine piece of the fantasy anime genre; from its' fantastically told story, great cast of diverse characters, impressive performances by the Japanese cast that has the finest veterans in the industry that include Shuuichi Ikeda, Akira Kamiya, Takeshi Kusao, Yoshiko Sakakibara, Hideyuki Tanaka, Yumi Touma, Norio Wakamoto, Kappei Yamaguchi, and more. So if you're a fan of any of these seiyuu, you'll definitely enjoy this OVA, but I don't really recommend watching the dub, the experience is much better watching it in the original Japanese. The music fits the tone of the series and is of great quality, the music is helmed by the composer of the Gundam 0083 series Mitsuo Hagita and the songs of the series; ""Adesso e Fortuna"" and ""Kaze no Fantasia"" are sung by Sherry and are among my favorite anime songs, the opening is melodic and beautiful, while the ending song is romantic and passionate. The artwork is designed by Nobuteru Yuuki who did the character designs for The Five Star Stories movie and the Escaflowne series, and Yuuki did a fantastic job with the character designs and I feel that for this particular anime, it is his finest work in the era of cel-drawn animation. One flaw of the series is the repetitive narrative opening that was done for eps. 2-13 and felt that it could've been a different narrative for each of those episodes and add a new piece to the history of the RoLW world. Overall, I truly love this series and it is a fine piece for anyone who enjoys fantasy anime.

I feel US Manga Corps/CPM could've done a better job with the presentation such as spreading the series out at least on 3 discs to improve on the overall quality of the video, update the ending credits from the old releases, use different trailers on the second disk as they are the same ones on the first, but the packaging is quite nice that I liked. Otherwise, I felt it was a great buy and am glad to have it among my anime DVD collection.",1366675200,,2006,4.603351955307263

This anime was made in the 80's I think so it's pretty old. Even so it is still impressively drawn by hand. The voice acting is pretty good and there are lots of really cool characters. One of my favorite all time anime characters is the Black Knight Ashram.  This anime is loaded with cool fantasy action and plenty of emotion. It's amazing. An oldie but a goodie!

The voice acting dose need help but was done okay for the 90's.

631241,4,6303363598,"I would like to warn anyone who reads this, if they buy this or any other DVD through the Marketplace to examine the product they received carefully.  Frequently, a Seller may list the sale under a different print/edition than the one they have.  Also, on an out-of-print item like this, a Bootleg may be substituted or mistakenly re-sold as the genuine item.

The first easy-to-find red flag is the Region marker on the back of the case or on the disc.  All-region DVDs are frequently bootlegs and may not run on Region-specific DVD players.

The second easy-to-find red flag is the lack of a publisher's logo on the front, back or spine of the DVD case and/or on the disc itself.

The third easy-to-find red flag is the lack of copyright marks and license information on the back of the case or on the disc itself.

The fourth easy-to-find red flag is the contact information on the back of a case.  If there is an email address from a free-email site like Yahoo or their site is hosted by a free-webhost like Geocities.

The actual contents of the discs may be trickier.  They may be a rip of a licensed VHS (tell-tale graininess or distortion of the image), a fan-sub rip, or the subtitles may read like the script was put through Bablefish and character names are incorrect or translated into phonetic Chinese.",1254614400,5,1315,4.605150214592275
631242,5,6303363598,"If you're into Anime, you'd be cheating yourself by not getting the collectors edition of this Anime classic. This is a groundbreaking Anime, that brings the Role Playing video game to life.

The story centers around Parn, a young man in a small village, who wishes to become a great knight like his father. A situation occurs that forces Parn to test rather he is man enough to live the life of a warrior. He meets allies along the way, and before he knows it, he and his companions are caught in the middle of a war between Light and Darkness.

The Animation aged well over the years and is still considered one of the best in Fantasy art. The Soundtrack is beautiful and one of the most celebrated parts of this Anime saga.

I could go on, but anyone who knows a teaspoon about Anime, knows about Lodoss War. It's a staple in the Art that is Japanimation.",1193875200,2,858,4.383647798742138
631243,5,6303363598,"Definitely the best Swords and Sorcery animated series/film that I'VE ever seen. Although I do agree with most of the small criticisms others had about the characters being fairly stereotypical, I think that these stereotypical characters were never executed so well (at least in animation). As far as the cut corners in the animation go, they were annoying, but didn't happen too often. Only in maybe episode 12 were they super noticeable and the fact is, is that this is one of, the if not the best, most well animated series in the genre.

It's too bad the previews for the sequel to this, ""The Chronicles of the Heroic Knight"" look so bad.

It had a good storyline, character interplay, and associable monsters.  The younger heroes evolved under the teachings of the older characters, and they were very sympathetic.

He has tried to get me to tell him how much the set was, thinking it was an exuberant amount because of the collector's edition.

I watched the first episode and had to quickly change to Japanese (with sub) because other wise I would've just thrown it away. (its that bad)  But on the other hand the japanese is awesome!  The perfect voices for the characters.  The music is spellbinding (the opening and ending songs come in both english and japanese which is a +)  The art is so incredibully detailed!  It is a great fantasy story, don't get me wrong.  If you love the original older voices, great, but most newer anime lovers are used to a better dubbing.",1160179200,,699,4.315384615384615

631301,5,6303363598,"Like Bubblegum Crisis for cyberpunk, and Vampire Hunter D for horror, and Ghost in the Shell for sci-fi, Record of Lodoss War, the original OVA, was and is the best in its genre. It's created the formula all fantasy series have used over the years, and duplications of Lodoss War are, not surprisingly, successful (Berserk is one example).

As the title suggests, this OVA is a series of stories following the same characters as they battle in a war to save the cursed islands of Lodoss from many evil forces, including wizards, witches, a dark elf, monsters, and dragons. Though small in size, the group of companions are large in compassion and confidence, and they battle these forces to the best of their powers, even if it means death. Though the story is cliche in today's world, so is Lord of the Rings. I'd go as far as to say that Lodoss War did for anime was LotR did for literature. The heroes are stereotypical (a fighter, a mysterious elf, a thief, a dwarf, a wizard, and a priest) and the enemies rehashed (goblins and dragons) yet it just works here because Lodoss was the first to truly attempt something the big. Without this anime, many later anime would never have been created.

Though the story bounces around some, it mostly follows the young fighter Parn as he meets those who he comes to not only trust, but love as well. And all along the way, he slowly learns the skills needed to become a legend among heroes. During his journey, he battles many powerful enemies, including a huge dragon, and always seems to come out ahead. He becomes the purest picture of altruism and is willing to sacrifice himself for those around him.

And history tells us that many believe this a good series, what with numerous spin-off series and movies, and many almost direct copies. If you are a fan of anime and want to see one of the important anime, then pick this up.",1137542400,7,1878,4.566765578635015
631302,4,6303363598,"If you like fantasy anime (i.e. dragons, wizards, knights, monsters, ect.) then I definitly suggest picking up this title. It has amazing scoring and for its time, the anime is quite beautiful!",1122940800,2,193,5.0625
631303,5,6303363598,"Parn is a young warrior living in a small village whose father was a holy knight, who was eventually forced to leave in disgrace. Parn is determined to salvage his family's name. Then one day Parn saves a young woman who is attacked by a gang of goblins in the woods. That goblins should be out in broad daylight is very strange, since they normally only come out at night. Later the other villagers berate him for killing a goblin, since they're certain more will come and retaliate by attacking the village. This does happen, and it's up to Parn and his old friend Etoh, a cleric, (a priest who specializes in healing spells,) as well as two other warriors, Ghim, a dwarf warrior who has embarked on a quest to find and bring back home Karla, a young priestess, and his sorceror friend Slayn, to defend the village. After the battle with the goblins is over, the mayor sends Parn and Etoh out to find out the cause of the goblins strange behavior, like going out in daylight. Ghim and Slayn go with them. Soon the four are joined by Deedlit, a high elf maiden. It isn't long before they are captured by guards of the kingdom of Mice (yes, that's what it's called,) who suspect them of being enemy spies, and taken prisoner. While in prison they meet Woodchuck, a thief. They learn of the evil kingdom of Marmo, which is going out on a journey of conquest. Soon the captain of the guards meets them and realizes what a mistake has been made, and he orders the five released. Parn wants to join the guard ranks, but then Marmo attacks. The heros are unable to stop the oncoming army, and barely make it out with Woodchuck in tow. Now they must embark on a quest to save Loduss from evil.

Just about everything is great about this show, including the voice acting in both lanuges, but there's one serious problem in the continueity that might have some people confused. Episode 1 actually takes place AFTER episodes 2-5. Why they did this, I have no idea. Anyway, if you want the watch the episodes in their proper order, watch them like this:

#2:Blazing Departure
#3:The Black Knight
#4:The Grey Witch
#5:The Desert King
#1:Prologue To The Legend

After this, go to episode 6,""The Sword Of The Dark Emperor:, and watch the rest of the series in order.",1121126400,56,2253,4.503667481662592
631304,5,6303363598,"Most of the people who wander across this series do not know that this anime is based off of a very lengthy series of novels (over 10) that were written in the 80's.  Those novels were based off of a japanese role-playing game called ""Sword World RPG.""  Whether Record of Lodoss War was an actual campaign that people played or if RoLW is just based off of the game, I do not know.  Either way, this story is not a rip off of Star Wars or LotR, although it may have similarities (I don't see similarities, and I have been both a LotR fan and a Star Wars fan since I was 6 years old).

A lot of people will not like this anime, period.  They'll complain about the voice acting, and they'll complain about the quality of the graphics.  The truth is that the animation is actually very good, especially since this series came out somewhere around the late 80's to early 90's.  The detail in the animation is superb, and for its time, the coloring was as well.  With people used to the graphical quality of animes today, where CGing technology is far superior to that of the animes made more than 10 years ago, people who are relatively new to anime will probably not have a taste for this series.

Now, if you've been watching anime since the early 90's or before (and you have somehow not seen this), I highly recommend it.  The plot may be a little rushed since they tried to cram so many novels into only 6.5 hours of animation, but they still did a darn good job.  There is a reason why this anime is famous.  When it came out in Japan around 15 years ago, the novels that RoLW is based off of were incredibly popular.  This series was a bit rushed due to the constraints that the animation team was working on, but nevertheless, it sold like crazy.  When it came to the US, the knowledge of the real story was lost.  Still, it was one of the first fantasy animes around, and had not only above average voice acting for its time, but also incredible animation, great music, and a storyline that was original and refreshing.

I'd say that the one weakness of this anime is that it was crammed down into 13 episodes.  If the producers had allowed more time so it could cover more of the character development and side quests, I think this anime could have been even more legendary than it already is.",1116115200,7,2299,4.33411214953271
631305,4,6303363598,"This anime made me feel young again. I was the sort of odd little kid to whom Middle Earth was quite a real place that I would visit not unfrequently. As such, Record of Lodoss War reminded me of many of my old fantasies. There is something to be said about the animation not being great (but it was, after all drawn something like 15 years ago), and there are several points that are inadvertantly funny (i.e., the extremely large walrus-looking convict growling what sounds to English-speakers oddly like 'Cashew, cashew!""). Also, the plot is fairly too large and unwieldy to fit well into a 13-episode series (they should have either gone with less plot or made a longer series with much more development). But, overall, this series was amazingly FUN to watch (even if it is often fairly impossible to take seriously), especially from the perspective of one who has a quite vivid and rather naive imagination :).

I also should note that I am still one of those nutters who reads The Lord of the Rings annually, and I found all the comparisons people draw between the two to be extremely shallow. What RoLW borrows from Tolkien is largely contextual (i.e., the fact that there are dwarves and elves), but adds its own quite significant changes (i.e., dragons taking on a huge prominance and that fact that dark elves even exist--I can only think of one that Tolkien buried somewhere deep in The Silmrillion). Deedlit certainly bore no relationship to any elves that I can think of out of Tolkein--all that really remains is the fact that they call her a high elf and she has pointy ears. But the biggest point of significance is that RoLW and LotR have NO (NONE WHATSOEVER) thematic similarity. NONE.",1112918400,6,1703,4.714765100671141
631306,3,6303363598,"I was excited to watch this series when I first heard about it, following the rave reviews it had recieved from fellow gamers, but I was let down upon actually watching it. The plot was jumpy and unconvincing, and the characters ended up seeming like hollow puppets, shoved and pushed in every direction so the ""real story"" could be uncovered for the viewer, while the whole specifically did not revolve around anything particularly significant or interesting to those same characters. To put it more simply, it lacked the human interest, partiuclarly with the characters, that makes for a good story.

That most D&D players think this anime is good or spectacular says more about D&D players and what they consider ""good"", due to the unique habituation to particular dysfunctional elements of story often present in the hobby, than it does about the quality of this anime. All in all, this anime played exactly like a traditionally-run campaign of D&D -- where the DM tells a grand story to the players, who are there to experience and participate in the events as proxy-by-character. The (ostensibly) ""main"" characters act as witnesses to the real adventure, rather than the central actors in the piece as prime motivators of the unfolding story-events.

Ultimately, while not ""horrible"" -- nothing close to some of the worst anime I have seen -- it was nowhere near five-star material. This is a good movie and you'll probably enjoy it if you are twelve years old, or if you are not being very picky. If you want to zone out and watch some decent visuals, sword battles, and dragon fights for a couple nights, then ""Record of Lodoss War"" might be a good choice, but if you are looking for interesting, gripping, high-adventure with memorable characters and thoughtful plot events, this series is not it.",1105833600,,1806,4.898692810457517

For thirteen episodes (each 30 minutes in length) you would think it would pass by quickly....but the fact is, the darn plot moved so slowly you feel like you have been watching for ages.

While trying to survive Parn's nievity which grows to be very annoying over time, you find yourself trying to stay awake and trying to figure out what the heck the main plot is about.  They have so much going on at one time it gets hard to follow and at times it get's confusing.  And instead of deeloping their characters so the viewer can feel as if he/she ""knows"" this person...they go to one battle scene to another where Parn believes just because his father was a great knight he automatically knows how to use a sword.  I mean for peats sake....Deedlit is a better fighter than him! And she's the one that gets captured at the end!

This entire series was a total let down for me and i would advise against buying it.  If you have a friend whom owns it i would suggest you borrow it and watch it from them first before you buy it....or at least read some more of these reviews.",1102032000,3,1222,4.310043668122271
631328,3,6303363598,"After reading quite a lot of favourable reviews around the internet, I must confess I found myself expecting a great deal from Record of Lodoss War. Unfortunately, I believe it falls short on too many aspects, most of which could be easily improved!

One of the main things you will notice right away is it's COMPLETE lack of originality! As a matter of fact, if you take a look at the details you will find this Anime to be, in many ways, a complete copy of The Lord Of The Rings!

Just take a look at the characters... the main party consists of: 2 Humans , a powerful Sorcerer , an Elf and a Dwarf named Ghim! (I wonder where I've seen THAT before...)

If you manage to look through all that though, you will find a very nice Fantasy Anime, with a good plot and some agressive action scenes.

The quality of it's sound is one of the best aspects of Record of Lodoss War. The music is great, and considering this Anime was released in 1990 the overall quality of the sound effects is quite good.

In conclusion I can only say that Record of Lodoss War is a good Fantasy Anime that unfortunately lacks the originality of other great series of this genre, such as Escaflowne or Hack Sign.

If you're REALLY into Fantasy though, this is one of the old-school classics you would want to have on your collection, but if you're not... there are much better choices!",1100563200,5,1361,4.380952380952381
631329,5,6303363598,"I don't know why all of the other reviewers say the plot is unoriginal, maybe they just don't understand it.  First, the idea of a sorceress controlling peoples' lives in order to create a war that will 'save Lodoss' is very original in my opinion.  The story is wonderful and complex and I think it is a joy to watch again and again.  The characters are well thought out and you even begin to sympathize with them. I'll admit that a lot of the character and plot ideas originate from Dungeons and Dragons, but it is played out in an original way.

(You can read many other reviews for all the plot and events)

Basically the with Karla decides that the balance of power must be restored in Lodoss so that the world is not destroyed.  In order to accomplish this, the witch instigates the war that is already beginning to develop.  Beld and Fahn, the two opposing Kings engage each other with Parn and his companions caught up in the struggle.

On the second disc, events do get bogged down after Karla is defeated and moves on to her new body.  Finally things pick up when Ashram and Parn engage each other in Demon Dragon Mountain.  Both the Japanese and the English Dub are wonderful.  I prefer most anime in Japanese, but this is one that I prefer in English (along with IRIA Zeiram).

I would say that for fans of any RPGs or Lord of the Rings this is a great boxed set to pick up.  You may be able to find it to rent (usually you can rent both discs in one box, sometimes you have to rent them separately).

Just remember that this is an anime developed in the EIGHTIES and drawn right around 1990.  The animation is great for being almost 15 years old.

I encourage everyone to just watch it and decide for themselves.  Everyone has their own opinion.",1097193600,8,1758,4.36

This series is actually a classic with great hand-drawn art, music by Yokko Kanno and Sherri, and all the favorite elements from fantasy.

This item is a must-buy for fans of this series, but all others won't be overly impressed by it, esp. if you already watch contemporary anime.

Personally, I first watched this series in 1994 on VHS, and it made quite an impression on me. Previously, I hadn't been won over by Japanese animation.

So again, if you are a fan and have fond memories of this series, this Collector's Edition is a must-buy.",1096070400,8,688,4.622950819672131

631332,1,6303363598,"I would give this ZERO STARS if I could, but Amazon won't let me. The animation is HORRIBLE, which I could get over if the story wasn't HORRIBLE. Maybe I'm too picky, or spoiled, or both. But in the way of stories, I have been exposed to too many good fantasy stories by authors such as Tolkien (LOTR) and Tad Williams' (""Memory, Sorrow, and Thorne"" series/trilogy). These are books, not anime, but they have spoiled me for the generic and just plain bad tripe that this Lodoss War story consists of. The characters aren't developed. The background story isn't developed. It is very simple, which is not a bad quality in itself, but this story plays out like a very bad role-playing video game. There is just enough story to tell who is bad and who is good. There is some cheesy mythololgy-type story briefly given at the beginning of this series -- much like an RPG. For me, this would not bother me if the story was more in depth.

 Bad story aside, this DVD series might be worth watching for its action and eye-candy visual effects, but wait, it doesn't have those either!!! The animation and bad production values make it look like this was made in the 1970s on a shoestring budget. Plus, there is very little action.

 I want the dollar, and the coupon I used to reduce the price to a dollar, back from the big-name video rental company I rented this from. I wouldn't watch this even if it were free. It is so bad, it gives me that kind of car-sick feeling I get when I watch bad animation and listen to bad 1970s music and television shows. Bleecchhhh!!!! I only could handle the first four episodes. Sadly, I was hoping it would get better. It didn't.

 Seriously, I don't know how some people say this is ""The Best Series Ever!!"" or things like that. It blows my mind, seriously. If you like good QUALITY movies, animation, storytelling, etc, STAY AWAY FROM THIS AT ALL COSTS!!!!

 If you want to see good anime, watch Akira, Ghost in the Shell, Ninja Scroll, Spirited Away, Princess Mononoke, Perfect Blue, Cowboy Bebop, or look for Amazon lists of Anime movies that contain some of these titles and you will be on the right track. There are more good anime movies than the ones I mentioned above. Look at Amazon's ""Listmania""s or their ""So you want to..."" lists.

My one complaint, and it's minor, is that the animations for the ancient dragons was less than stellar.  But it's a great story, with well-developed characters.  All I can say is this: Get it.",1083715200,3,275,4.44
631334,5,6303363598,"Okay, I'm gonna start off with a personal note:  RECORD OF LODOSS WAR is probably one of my all-time favorite series ever.  At the time that I was just getting warmed up to Anime (thanks to witnessing Miyazaki's wonderful artistry), I happened upon this title in my local videostore.  Instantly, I fell in love with this thirteen-part direct-to-video series -- being a fan of the SNES game FINAL FANTASY III and J.R.R. Tolkien in general, watching RECORD OF LODOSS WAR was like a dream come true.  It's a hybrid of these two great works filled with just about everything any fan could ask for -- dragons, elves, dark gods, a band of unlikely yet loyal heroes, villains you'll love to hate, action, suspense, romance, a small touch of humor, and engaging from start to finish.

The story is hardly original, but it's done very well for this kind of show.  In fact, the one minor flaw of this series is the way the plot ""jumps around"" from one event to the next.  However, it's the characters which make RECORD OF LODOSS WAR so much fun, and much of the best scenes belong to Parn and Deedlit; especially the dance sequence.  Ghim and Deed also get to bicker about each other's differences while Parn, on a quest to clear his disgraced father's name, finds a father figure in Kashue.  Ashram has a Dark Elf named Pirotess (the opposite of Deedlit) who'll do anything to prove her loyalty to him... including sacrificing herself, Karla is shifty and cunning, while Wagnard is just plain evil -- an over-the-top, maniacal monster equivalent of Kefka from FINAL FANTASY VI who cackles fiendishly as he puts his dark plans into action.  The chemistry between this cast of characters is so well done and the show is so engrossing that it's easy to forgive its occasional shortcomings, notably the jumpy plotting and the animation, which, although gorgeously drawn, uses a low cel count which results with some stiff movements.  It may take a while for one to warm up to the music, but by the end, it really grows on you.  For fantasy buffs, RECORD OF LODOSS WAR is simply great fun.

Central Park Media made a DVD release of this title a few years ago, but have since rereleased it in a more beefed up package, with some new bonus features to speak of, including the behind-the-scenes featurette we saw on the VHS tapes as well as a Promotional video (dubbed in English), which sounds, I'm sad to say, awful.  There's even some DVD-ROM features (identical to those on the CHRONICLES set), including the dub script and credits for both casts.  As far as I'm concerned, the visual transfer is very well done, but then I've never seen the old release so I can't compare it with that.  (I was told, though, that CPM used a new Digital Video Remastering process to clean up the visuals for this release.)

For purists, the Japanese language track is on here with clear, easy to read subtitles, and an optional English dub.  Considering that it was recorded at a time when dubs had a very bad reputation, this English production is surprisingly good.  It got somewhat mixed reviews; some say it's fake and/or mediocre while others find it annoying, but here's a better review from one of its many enthusiastic fans (that's me!).  No, it's not perfect, and some lines do come off as a bit awkward, but a lot of the voiceovers are really good.  In particular, Billy Regan (Parn), Lisa Ortiz (Deedlit), Al Muscari (Slayn), Jacques Le Can (Woodchuck), Simone Grant (Karla & Leylia), John Knox (Ashram), Jayce Reeves (deliciously malevolent as Wagnard), and Alexander J. Rose (Wort and the Narrator), are among my favorites.  Plus, the dialogue is close to the subtitled script and packed with some memorable one-liners (Parn: ""Quick, Deed, what's [the dragon]'s weak spot?"" Deedlit: ""I'm not a dragon expert! How should I know?!"") and great chemistry between the actors.  I especially loved the interactions between Parn and Deedlit, the banter between Ghim and Deed, and a lot of other things.  Which is why it saddens me that some would find all of this ""inferior"" to the Japanese language track.  I listened to parts of the Japanese language track, too, and while I did find it to be of top-quality, I find that the dub still holds its own position decently.  Of course, it may be in danger of being overshadowed by some of the better dub productions of today, but for a dub made in 1996, its a rather decent, if unspectacular listen.  I'm still fond of it, as a matter of fact, even after hearing some better ones.

Whatever language you choose to watch it in, you'll still be experiencing one of the greatest fantasy series of all time.  Highly recommended.",1067904000,7,4645,4.7
631335,5,6303363598,"I have been a big fan of fantasy movies, books, video games, and anime.  When I first saw Record of Lodoss War (in 2003) I first thought the animation dated (during the intro).  But after the film truly opened I was impressed with the superb quality of the animation, especially in an older film.  The story is excellent.  The characters are all likable (except that whiny priest guy, Etoh).  Parn and Deedlit make the perfect mismatched couple.  My only problems are that the love story never fully evolves and that the last few episodes rush along whereas the first 7 are well paced.  The extras are limited but the only extra that really matters is the inclusion of both English and Japanese dialogue.  One other question, IS Kashum Parn's dad or what????

I bought the VHS tapes and later bought the DVD collection when it was released. Everything about this series is epic. All classes(warrior, monk, mage, orc, elf, priestess, sorceress, berserker, + more)  of the dark and light battle are caught amidst in the tide of war. The series rests on a timid warrior(Parn), struggling to discern the unseeing dark forces approaching the island of Lodoss.

I have played role playing games like AD&D and Palladium since I was 12 and I couldn't help myself. I began putting the collection together one tape (yeah, I know: GASP!) at a time. I have to say that this series is simply breathtaking.

Orcs, Kobalds, Wizards, Warriors, Thieves, Elves, Dwarves, and more including Dragons (BIG Dragons).  Some of the most detailed and colorful art ever to grace a television screen moves the story along flawlessly.

631360,5,6303363598,"What should I start with? Well, it's really good piece of anime. It tells us a story of six characters, joined together by fate. Young man with the passion to become a knight someday, one young woman in love with him, one dwarf searching for his friend's daughter and one warlock who is helping him in his quest, one cleric and one thief sets out on a journey. We follow the adventures of Parn (human knight), Deedlit (beautiful elf woman), Etoh (human cleric), Ghim (dwarf), Slayn (human warlock) and Woodchuck (human thief). The series started with episode actually taken from the middle of this saga. Our heroes went into Great Dwarf Tunnel and... the story begins. In next few episodes we will learn how our heroes get together and what their backgrounds and goals are.
Great thing about this series is that story develops really fast and main characters rarely stuck in one location. Many new characters they encounter make this adventure even more exciting because those characters usually bring another story arcs into main plot, but in the end every path our heroes take is leading them to their final clash with ultimate evil.
Another aspect that makes this particular title interesting to watch is its unquestionable RPG link. It is really interesting to see how Parn's skill grows with every stroke he make, every new fight matures him, making him tougher and more able. It has everything average RPG fan will want.
What at first seemed like ordinary adventure becomes journey of their lifetime. Epic battles, great adventures, many races (humans, high elves, dark elves, orcs, berserker, even great dragons), sorcery and swordfights - it's all here. This anime takes itself seriously and delivers to us the genre that seems not so popular these days - heroic epic where good heroes are good, evil is evil, and almost every fight have an affection on the final balance of forces.
Opening and closing songs are very good, animation is top notched (for its time), and although there aren't many features on these DVDs, the animation itself is worth it. This anime set standard for fantasy adventure, like later Berserk did. Enjoy it.",1047686400,4,2142,4.903581267217631

631408,4,6303363598,"I have been playing fantasy role-playing adventures since almost before they were invented.  There is a certain infectious delight in assembling a crew of somewhat unlikely heroes and going on a layered series of quests that eventually saves the world (and the pretty significant other as well).  It gives us a change to use our imaginations, our luck, and to try out different personalities in harsh, magical worlds.  And that is what 'The Record of Lodoss War' is really about.
Based on an original manga series.  The story starts with six companions.  Parn, a compulsive do-gooder (and negligible swordsman), Etoh the priest to be,  Deedlit the beautiful high elf,  Woodchuck the thief, Ghim the dwarf, and Slayn the mage.  Beld, the evil king of Marmo is invading Lodoss, and Parn and his friends are dedicated to stopping the threat.  Throw in a few more kings, some dragons, a witch, swords, chalices... you name it.  If you like fantasy, there has to be something here to draw you in.
The scale of the story is probably major overkill.  As it is, character development is a bit squished by all the action.  Relationships that could have become very interesting on their own keep being truncated by the sudden appearance of yet another avatar of evil.  In fact, the viewer occasionally has the feeling that an entire scene has died on the cutting room floor in an effort to keep everything moving forward.  I did find this a bit frustrating, but the truth is that this is supposed to be an action adventure story, not something with Evangelion's twists and turns.
The animation is primitive, mostly consisting of foreground action panned against a static background.  There is also a tendency to overuse certain scenes.  However, the artistic quality is excellent, as a tour of the DVD's art gallery will quickly reveal.  There are lots of fantasy settings, armor, clothing, and a set of totally incredible dragons.  Music is acceptable as well.  One has to keep in mind that viewing 13 episodes in rapid sequence will reveal some irritating repetitions what would be hard to spot in normal pacing.  The Japanese acting and vocal choices are better than the English equivalents, but the translation itself is excellent.  The transfer to DVD could have been better.
This is worth watching.  It's very easy to nitpick, but the truth is that very few long anime fantasy series are as strong as 'The Record of Lodoss Wars.'  There is always room for something better, but I am glad this is as good as it is.  With almost seven hours of run time, this set is quite a bargain.",1037491200,14,2576,4.789115646258503

I am big into RPG video games like Final Fantasy and played quite a bit of AD&D as a kid so these films were a perfect fit into my interests.

Still, here goes: I really like all kinds of anime, and after hearing all the hype, I really expected to like this. Alas, my hopes were dashed. Simply put, it's too darn stereotypical. All of the Dungeons and Dragons stereotypes are there, and if you've read Margaret Weiss and Tracy Hickman's Chronicles (good stuff) then you'll see some obvious and none-too-coincidental similarities. The party of characters in this anime have the tolken fighter, dwarf, elf, thief, cleric and mage. Sound familiar? Anyway, I guess this would be forgivable if it was done well, but it's really not. The first episodes are just kind of boring, and while poor animation can be overlooked, it does get kind of tiring to see the same animation clip repeated over and over, episode after episode.
So why two stars? It gets a little better in some of the later episodes (although not the last ones) and the white and black knights Kashu and Ashram are pretty cool (the best characters, actually). And then the climax comes, and you think it's cool at first, and then it drags on and on and on, and when it finally ends you're left with a bad feeling in your mouth.

631460,2,6303363598,"I hate to go against the flow (... did that sound convincing?), but I simply can't share in the general enthusiasm that Lodoss War seems to elicit amongst most viewers.  I was very much looking forward to seeing it given its outstanding reputation, but after doing so...well, whether the set was worth fifty bucks seems highly debatable.
Let's ignore the fact that somebody involved in the production of this series was obviously a reeeeeeally big fan of the Dragonlance Chronicles.  After all, that series is something of a fantasy classic; that Lodoss War shamelessly rips off large segments of the DLC story would not make it a bad thing--as long as it was entertaining.
And that's the kicker: LW just isn't very much fun to watch.  Characters in anime don't have to be hugely deep to be likable, but most of the ones here are just blank slates who never really make up in charm what they lack in depth.  There are exceptions (Slayn, who looked cool enough to render any criticism moot; the berserker and his paramour; some of the villains), but it's really not enough, especially when there's something of an air of pointlessness about the whole story, culminating in a confused mess of an ending consisting largely of pointless combat with no real relevance to anything.
As far as fantasy anime goes, I'm sticking with Slayers, and that's my final answer. Lodoss War isn't wholly without merit, but in the end, anyone wanting more serious fare would do better to pick up copies of the DL Chronicles--more entertaining, and a helluva lot cheaper.",996710400,6,1550,4.815789473684211

It started out in the middle of the journey to find Wort, but I was immediately impressed by the narration and storyline.  The animation was also much better than I was expecting, though it is not good compared to some of the art out today.  I was a little confused, at first, by the complex and intermittent plot line, but that was soon overcome and I followed the story without much difficulty. The characters were the best part of the series, because it had so many memorable characters, mainly Parn and Deedlit, that really strengthened the plot and gave an added depth to the whole of the movie.  The movie also has it share of action and fight scenes that were performed well and were never boring.
From romance to good vs. evil conflicts, this series has it all.  And is recommended to all who share a love for epic adventures.

631463,4,6303363598,"Record of Lodoss War is a fantasy anime adapted by the books in Japan. The main goal with this series was to stay true to the RPG style and I think they did a good of it with this 13 episode OVA. The story takes off right in the middle of six heros (Parn, Slayn, Ghim, Etoh, Wood and Deed) wandering through a tunnel system and fighting a dragon. If this is confusing, episode 2 and 3 explain a lot as they tell from the begining of the story. The first disc is what I like to call the Clash of Heroes saga as it tells of the battle between Beld and Fahn, two rulers which control different parts of Lodoss. The second disc takes off as the ressurection of a god who could destory all of Lodoss. A lot of dragons come into play in the second disc and the battle between them are beautiful. One of the best things Lodoss has going for it is its supreme artwork and the ability to confuse the audiance with its complex storytelling. In terms of video quality, there is a lot of noticable grain in epsidoe 2, but after that its fine. The video is of the dubbed version which means you means you are going to be stuck with the English vocie cast in the credits. That really doesn't matter much as some of the voice actors from the saga are named in the documentary. Oh yeah, thats another thing. Theres only one ""extras"". The making of documentary which was included on the VHS tapes is actually really just a viewing of the Lodoss premiere at a theater. Still, even with boring menus and little extras, Record of Lodoss War is still with worth buying. Subtitles are bold and easy to read and no detection of screw ups in the audio department. And being half of what the boxed set costs, this is an easy buy. Overall, great series, worth every buck, buy it now.",992476800,6,1757,4.2477611940298505

631465,4,6303363598,"Well, I probably won't add much to what has already been said, but here goes:
Record of Lodoss War is just 'good' Anime, meaning it's enjoyable, without any major faults, with decent story, decent animation, in general something that, while not the best of the best, surely isn't average.
What makes it more than average is the characters (both animation and their portrayal), especially Parn and Deedlit. Some may complain that Parn's a wimp who anyone can beat, but I liked that he doesn't immediatedly turn into an invincible superhero. This series had me smiling, gasping in excitement to see what happens. I watched it all in one go, although before I never had even read the manga or seen one episode.
There's of course some minor things, a pixellated scene here, low audio there, a plot device not fully worked out, but that's all minor things. The thing is, this series is something for anyone who enjoys a good clash between good and evil and where the hero gets the heroine in the end, especially if you like heroic fantasy.
Something about the packaging. It comes in a sturdy cardboard box with the 2 dvds in cardboard/plastic cases, not sure of the name. But I wish they'd used standard dvd keepcases instead, because they're much sturdier. Still, they're nearly the same size, I just keep them in the box. The art on the box is about what you expect, scenes from the series, but the quality is so-so. Nothing to scoff at, but certainly not something to commend :). Then again, you don't buy the series for the box and 50 bucks is a bargain.

If you have ever played D&D games on computer or through role playing books, I think you will enjoy this film.  There were lots of classic characters such as elves, goblins, kobolds, and dragons.

The only gripe I had against the series was some of the battle scenes.  Just as a few of the battles started picking up, the film would focus to other characters and break the momentum.  It was only a minor inconvience though.

631470,3,6303363598,"(I'm reviewing the English dubbed version of this series only. I haven't seen it in the original Japanese.)
To be blunt, this is the kind of series I'd expect to see for free on TV. The animation is decent but not extraordinary, the story is enjoyable but not terribly innovative, the music is somewhat fitting but also very forgettable (not to mention extremely cheesy in some instances), and the voice acting is a mixed bag of hits and misses, although it does gradually improve as the series progresses.
For me, the high point of this series was the above average character designs. Very vibrant and well-detailed for the most part. I especially liked the way Deedlit was designed. Very cute. A few of the designs actually reminded me of ones that were used in the anime movie X.
Something else that this series had going for it was its love story. Personally, I didn't think it was developed as much as it should have been, but I liked it nonetheless.
A Making of Record of Lodoss War featurette is included on the second DVD, but it's really nothing more than an early promotional video for the series, and a poor one at that.
If you want to know how I would compare this series to other animated series I've seen, I'll just say that, to me, Record of Lodoss War is not quite as good as the first season of Disney's Gargoyles. So unless you have money to burn and nothing better to spend it on, either borrow Record of Lodoss War from a friend or pass it up altogether.
By the way, if I could have, I would have given it 2.5 stars, but I thought I'd round it up to 3 instead of down to 2.",979776000,4,1593,4.348993288590604
631471,5,6303363598,"Alrighty, what can I say that hasn't really been said? I disagree with some of the reviews. I've seen both sets, and this one by far is better. I don't understand where one reviewer got the ""Grainy"" viewing on DVD, mine doesn't have that. Yes, the English dubs aren't as good as the origional voices, but that's a given in almost any anime.
The first episode is a catcher episode, but takes place later in the plot. Aside from that, I found nothing confusing about it, even when the people split up and it skipped back and forth. The only annoying thing about it is the little commercial break thingy in the middle of the episode. If you sit down and watch all 13 in a row, you'll know what I mean.
I enjoyed this anime more than the others of it's type because it has character. You see progress with each character, as they become more proficient in their abilities. Another plus is that even though Good triumphs over evil, good isn't the unstoppable force that only takes a few scratches. Some major setbacks occur, and I almost had to watch a couple scenes twice to make sure that really happened, my mind woulnd't believe it. The storyline also includes several plot twists, that will make you actually reconsider who is good and who is bad.
The full VHS cost me almost twice the DVD cost. When I saw it for DVD for only 50 bucks, I ran out and bought it. This is most definately worth every penny I've spent, and I've seen the entire series 3 times and am still not tired of it.

631472,5,6303363598,"I think that there is a shortage of good fantasy anime out there, and this is definitely one worth a buy. The original Lodoss series is far better than it's sequel (the crappy 2nd series that reintroduces the characters entirely!). To put it bluntly, NO (and I mean no) fantasy/medieval-setting saga compares to the original Lodoss' nice art, solid voice-acting (except for Parn), and compelling story. You won't find stupid spacmonsters that shoot fireballs out of their butts or high-powered renegade cyborgs - it's all good ol' fashioned heroics with knights, dragons, and well-developed characters.

 In fact, the only downside to Lodoss is it's inconsistent and sometimes annoying main character, Parn ""the Free Knight"". Parn is a wimp at first, and anyone and their dog can kick him around, and the story forgets to mention how he quickly develops his super-duper sword skills by the end of the half-season's worth of shows. Aside from that, characters like Deedlit, Slayn, and Ashram add a great supporting crew. The only character that improves in the second series, by the way, appears to be King Kashue of Flaim - who is the 'fatherly' type of figure to Parn in this series. Overall, I love this first series, and I think it can't be lame or cliche when there is nothing out there quite like it when it comes to epic adventures and the fantasy genre.",978480000,4,1360,4.857758620689655

The first episode is near the middle of the series, making you wonder why you suddenly see the hero by himself in the next episode.  The other is that the old fashioned dubbing leaves you wanting to shove ice picks in both ears.

The story is enthralling and captures your attention many times throughout the show. Some parts are so intense, it brings shivers down your spine. I'm actually not very supportive of dubbed anime, being that I try to stay true to the original Japanese dub, but I have to say the dub for this particular anime was wonderful.

631507,4,6303363598,"Lodoss War is a 13 episode fantasy adventure story, set in a fairly generic Dungeons & Dragons type fantasy world with all the ordinary complement of races such as elves and dwarves.  While a comfortable setting in that, if you like fantasy, you already know the basics, it is not terribly imaginative.  The story begins as a good vs. evil matchup, but some of the evil characters are far more complex than they appear, and the particulars of the alliances and animosities shift over time.  It's reasonably well-executed and enjoyable, just not fresh or innovative.  The soundtrack is nice, as well--I picked up 3 CDs to get it.  The English dub cast takes some getting used to, as well--some of the voices are a little annoying at first, but I tend to think now that this was intentional.
There are some concerns.  First, the story is not chronologcal at first.  It starts after the adventure has begun, then jumps back to start from the beginning; it can be hard to follow.  Second, there are some real quality control problems on this disc.  The second through fourth episodes are grainy and look pretty bad--not unwatchable, but disappointing for DVD.  The audio sometimes goes up then down, which is distracting, but not fatal to enjoyment.  If you like fantasy, this is a good, but not great, show at a reasonable price for 13 episodes; just be aware that the DVD is not technically perfect.",973468800,12,1397,4.731404958677686

It had nice characters and interesting 'background' elements that most RPG players would pick up on (the mage and cleric actually recite their spells/prayers, taking away from their active time in battles). Most of the characters were stereotypical for their roles, which gave it an almost familiar air.
As an animator and storyteller, I must say this tale is rather flawed. Several points of the series leave you confused without any resolution. It starts in the middle and hap-hazardly backtracks to try to explain up to the beginning spot, but fails to fill in a few details along the way.
For those who love Anime, buy it. For those who love Fantasy Video Games (like Lunar on PlayStation/Sega Saturn), rent or borrow it - then buy it if you liked it.",971913600,6,885,4.67948717948718

Don't get me wrong, they have their moments, but I've seen better fight scenes and it does suffer from the reuse of certain bits of animation from episode to episode. It's probably less noticeable if you just watch it one episode at a time, but watching two or three it is a little wearing.
But... once you get on to the second DVD, things really start getting *good*. There's still the reused-animation problem, especially with the dragons, but the fights are suddenly a lot better and the plot starts getting more and more interesting. The last episode is slightly cheesy, but I don't care.
Overall, I would highly recommend this anime. It's not *quite* as good as the hype makes it out to be, but it is almost that good. Plus, you get the whole thing in one set, which makes it a pretty good introduction to anime as a whole (I would really recommend Akira as a first-time watch, but that's only my opinion...).

Awesome animation, and excellent story line  (albeit stereotypical), and it grabs you in...like the fun beginnings of  lets say...a Dragon Lance novel...the collective of fate-drawn friends sets  out on epic journey. This epic journy begins to falter along the way  (artists got tired?) but the animation slowly deteriorates, and I couldn't  get myself to watch the last couple episodes. Maybe they rebound, but I  have yet to find out. But as a whole, for the price, this series is worth  it. If it were any more expensive..hell no! If you have the cash, this is a  great ""used tape"" (the kind you see at blockbuster, and buy  previously viewed...a movie you would never buy full price...).  Some of  the episodes are fantastic...just don't expect a solid performance  throughout.",960681600,,947,4.961783439490445

631533,2,6303363598,"While the story is not bad, and in some places actually interesting, I  would have to say that this new series is a very poor sequel.
The major  thing is that there in no fighting at all! While the story has fighting,  they show none of it. There is this awful ""stop the action and jiggle  the frame"" idea. Tragic after the great sword play in the original  Lodoss.
Next on my list is the child like anime recap at the end of every  episode. At first I really liked these, but after watching the first few  tapes, this got old, and was just stealing time from the real story.
A  personal let down is the fact that Parn and the gang have little to no part  in this. They start the story, and quickly hand the story over to a new  band of adventures. While this may not be a bad thing to some, I was  looking forward to more of the saga of Parn and company.
Had this been a  stand alone story and not connected in anyway, I might have enjoyed it as a  lesser copy or rip off. I loved the original ""Record of the Lodoss  War"" and it is my favorite anime. But being connected I was very let  down with this story, and would have to give it a ""stay away""  vote.",959817600,,1156,4.004385964912281
631564,4,6303363598,"All I can say is, it's about time! After sitting through the wretched Legend of Crystania, I wasn't sure what to expect from this TV series. Fortunately, it's all good (well, mostly).
The storyline picks up a few  years after the events in the Record of Lodoss War OAV series. Parn is now  much more grown up and mature (and has a new, less-than-steller voice  actor). Deedlit and Slayn also make appearances, as do Shiris and Orsen  (the mercenaries from the OAV series), and Ashram, the Black Knight. There  are also some new faces in form of Cecil, a sorcerer who looks like  Deedlit's twin brother (but he's human, not an elf), Little Neese (Lelyia's  daughter, I would assume), and Spark, a young version of Parn.
The  introduction was quite nice, with a beautiful opening theme (note to self:  buy the OST). There's also some super-deformed bits following each episode  (or as the SD versions of Parn and Deedlit put it: ""the second  part!""). It's quite cute and humorous.
The only thing I have to  complain about is the voice-acting. Most of the main characters are pretty  good, but Parn's new voice actor is just plain annoying. Instead of  sounding grown up, he sounds like he's talking through a cardboard tube.  And, like the OAV series, a lot of the minor characters sound pretty hokey.",959212800,,1299,4.711111111111111

631566,4,6303363598,"The Age of Gods was closing. Eternity had come to an end. The heavens shook as the armies of Falis, God of Light, clashed with those of Falaris, God of Darkness. In the unceasing battle which followed, the earth wept...  The seas boiled...
At last, only two survivors remained of both sides.  Marfa, Goddess of Creation, and Kardis, Goddess of Destruction, who met in  a clash which echoed to the ends of the earth. At the end of the fierce  battle, a new land was born, split off from the continent, and the life's  fires of the goddesses of Light and Dark flickered and died  away.
Thousands of years have since passed. And now, the land to the  south of the continent of Alecrast has become known as ""Lodoss - The  Accursed Island.""
I was expecting quite a bit out of Lodoss war. I  was very dissapointed. Some of the reviews that I read said that  ""Record of Lodoss War"" is a wonderful anime with majestic  characters,involving plot, and eye catching animation. Unfortunatly, some  of this is untrue.
The animation was very detailed, very much so in the  first couple episodes. The frame rates were excellent,and the character  designs were superb. I was somewhat dissapointed with the battles,  however. From one review,It was said that the legthly battle sequences were  some of the best. Not so. The majority of the battles may have lasted a  while,But fast paced they are not. The only battle that had my puse racing  was the berserker battle. Other than that, I found that many battles  consisted of excessive camera panning, which started happening more and  more as the series progressed. I also witnessed the overuse of certain  images. It sort of gave me a feeling of Deja vu. As the series  progressed,the animation started to lose detail. In fact,I found some of  the monsters in volumn 6 to be Hokey,and very poor.
The characters may  have been this animes saving grace. You'll fall in love with them. Despite  Parns constant frusteration and how ignorant  he was of Deedlits attraction  toward him until it was to late, He still came off to be a likeable guy.  Deedlit herelf was a good character. Deedlit had a certain mysterious  quality about her, and also was sesitive. The bad guys too, are well done.  These are the kind of guys you'll love to hate.
I found the plot to be  masterful, with lots of cool twists and turns. I did find it to be a  entertaining fantasy,But the weak ending droned on and on.
The final  verdict is if you like fantasy anime, epic quests, or are a fan of ""RG  Veda"", or ""the Vision Of Escaflown"", or love elven vixens  dressed in revealing outfits,  I'm sure you'll love this. I know I did.",958867200,3,2639,4.587982832618025

A group of six people will have  to face their destiny and repeat what the ancient heroes did before, to  seal this evil once again. From the island of Marmo rised the evil king to  challenge for the ownership of Lodoss encouraged by a witch whose identity  is unknown to all but the sage of Lodoss. Of the party of six is Parn, an  aspiring young knight who must regain the honor of his father. Deedlit, a  joyful and playful elven girl who controls the forces of nature. Slaynn,  the ever powerful sorcerer of Parn's vilage. Ghim, the dwarf who must  search for his lost Lairyla. Etoh, the best friend of Parn taught the  teaching of a priest of Fall. Woodchuck, the good natured thief . Thus the  defense of Lodoss have begun. Will Parn and his party survived and discover  the secret of Lodoss? Only a seer who's one of the ancients can guide them.
This anime is enjoyable with a dungeon and dragon type storyline.

I'll join the band wagon and say, the theme is so touching and breath taking, it seems to give you a certain peace to know that other people in the world are touched by it, not  forgetting it releasing you from your real life.  I think that the  beggining is telling you that, this is far beyond anything you've ever  seen, and you should leave behind your judgmental ability, instead allowing  it to carry you through the story.  To the story line?  It is just as  memorable.  Giving you characters that don't lie to you, and are just as  human like as your next door neighbor.  Now to the end skits...  now most  may think it's kinda silly, but look at the picture, the stroy line may be  very pure and smooth as silk, but you must remember, it is also very  complex!  To me, it serves as a great recap!  Giving you an insight on  things that you couldn't be thrown into the story, because it would  probably throw off the balance, but they are very important on  understanding the big picture.  INclosing, for people who have anything bad  to say about Chronicles of the Heroic Knight, It's probably either that  they're not very complex or skilled thinking people, they are hiding what  they really think and do not wish to show what they have seen, or that they  just have NO IMAGINATION WHAT SO EVER!

If you make a comparision you would notice that in the chronicles  the characters looked like they got younger instead of older.  When I  ordered the chronicles 1-12 I planned on seeing a continuation of the old  storyline but to my surprise the chronicles were sadly lame.

Symphonic tracks and great intro and ending music are all  well done and engrossing. In fact, I went out and bought the soundtrack (a  very rare soundtrack).
Alas, Lodoss war is a title where the art is well  done, the animation great, but the screenplay a bit lacking. I suppose they  wanted to save time so they limited the amount of animation they had to do.  The result is lots of close ups and other animation-short-cuts in action  sequences.

Then I just purchased Record of Loddos War Chronicle of the Heroic Knight.  Heroic Knight happens five years after the original story of the Loddos  War. I then began to wonder how the original charcters got started and how  things ended and why they began in this new sereis. So I broke down and  bought this Dvd collection. I loved the story because it awnsers all of my  questions that I had. I might not have gotten this dvd if it was not for  the televison series that just was released.  The tone of this anime is  really dark and horrifying. People are slaughtered and kingdoms are overrun  with goblins and dragons. This fantasy story is definately not for those  looking for a bright and feel good anime. This anime has very interesting  charcters that just stepped out of their role playing game. I think that  this anime dvd is good for those like dragons and role playing games or  those who just enjoy a good romance and fantasy story.,947116800,7,1096,4.42
631705,1,6303363598,"Truly over rated.  Maybe it's because I'm not such a big fantasy person myself, but in my opinion, you have to like D&D (or something like that) to like this anime.  I see no other good qualities.  If you are not  fond or simply never really got attached to rpg's such as D&D, skip  this anime.
I had heard alot of this anime before I watched it and heard  from a friend that it was very good.  I read the reviews on amazon.com and  thought that one bad review out of 4 or 5 wasn't bad.  So I rented the  first dvd first.  It was horrible!  I was so bored I took about 3 breaks  in the middle of the first episode!  Its truly just for the D&D fans.  So in my opinion...I didn't like it.",946771200,2,686,3.9411764705882355

631707,5,6303363598,"I love this series because it contains everything that a good fantasy anime series should, including an incredible first fight in the introduction.  However, do yourself a favor and watch or buy the subtitled  version, it is infinitely better than the dubbed since the original  Japanese voices are superior to the dubbed American ones.

631708,5,6303363598,"Lodoss War is D&D brought to the screen, even more so than the old Dungeons and Dragons cartoon.  You find nearly all the old classes; fighter, thief, magic-user, cleric, elf, and dwarf.  With interesting  characters, a well thought out plot, and a villain worth cheering for, this  is the fantasy genre at it's best.
As specific to the DVD, this version  continues the ongoing, and very annoying, tradition of placing the episodes  not in chronological order, but rather in production order.  The result is  that the first episode of the series actually takes place three or four  episodes into the story.  This has been a long time pet peave of mine with  the various video releases of the series, and I wish someone would watch  this before they released it and realize how stupid it is to start in the  middle of the story (very briefly) jump to the beginning of the story, and  then skip that piece in the middle without explaination.
This episode was  produced first, to sell the show to producers because it was exciting and  action packed.  It was never intended to be aired in that order.",943833600,26,1097,4.659685863874346

  Some standard characters are ""introduced"" for the first time... Some dead charcaters are now ""alive""... and some  major events that happened... didin't.  In the context of the series it  makes some sence looking only at Parn, Tslegn, Deedlet... but for most  others... there are gaps in logical flow of the movie form the first  series. It almost looks like this was an alternate script for the first  movies, that just didn't ""cut it"".
  Its a feeble attempt at  best to cash in on the Lodoss name and fans... that is if you had seen the  original movies... As a stand alone movie it is okay, however, it must be  pointed out that the animation quality is low, the dialoge has been  ""dumbed down"", and everything is said twice... very  annoying....

631738,4,6303363598,"I'm not the hugest fan of Japanese animation, due to the fact that it often goes so overboard in terms of sex and violence.  (Strangely enough, though, Ninja Scroll had been, until recently, the best anime film I'd  seen.)  One day as I was perusing the video store I work in, I came across  this title and read the back.  Liking what I'd read, I decided to check it  out.  (I was even more interested to see that the video store had basically  given it a ""kid safe"" rating.) I was hardly prepared for what I  was about to see.  The Record of Lodoss War is basically an adaptation of  Dungeons and Dragons, anime style.  It starts off right in the middle of  things and then goes back to tell the beginning of the story.  In the first  episode alone, you get to see the heroes fight stone gargoyles that  suddenly spring to life, as well as a huge, firebreathing dragon.  Later  on, we see that there has been very much that has happened before these  events, and the rest of the series promises to be just as spectacular as  the beginning.

The characters in this movie were very unique and their personality was outstanding. They coallesced in a perfect  interaction of individuality.  The story was wonderful and I give much  kudos to the writer for his efforts. There was everything to it and more  and I won't even get started on how good the ending was.  All in all I  just have to say this is one of my favorites and I couldn't pass up the  chance to say something about it because I force all my friends to watch it  and I haven't had any compliants yet.

7844451,5,6303363598,"Record of Lodoss War is based on a series of serialized ""Replays"" (essentially transcripts of RPG sessions) published in Comptiq, by Group SNE from 1986 - 1988.

Group SNE originally used the Advanced Dungeons & Dragons rule set, as well as Tunnels & Trolls and RuneQuest.

Replays are not novels, but transcripts of RPG sessions, meant to both hold the interest of readers and convey the events that took place. They have proven to be popular, even to those who do not play role-playing games but are fans of fiction (including fantasy fiction). Similar to light novels, many characters and parties in replays have become popular as characters of anime. An example of such a character is the female elf Deedlit in Record of Lodoss War, who was played by science fiction novelist Hiroshi Yamamoto during the RPG sessions.

Record of Lodoss War 1: The Grey Witch (  Rdosut Senki Haiiro no Majo?) (April 1988)

Record of Lodoss War 3: The Demon Dragon of Fire Dragon Mountain (Part 1) (3 () Rdosut Senki San: Kary-zan no Mary (J)?) (May 1990)

Record of Lodoss War 4: The Demon Dragon of Fire Dragon Mountain (Part 2) (4 () Rdosut Senki Yon: Kary-zan no Mary (Ge)?) (July 1990)

High Elf Forest: Deedlit's Tale (  Hai Erufu no Mori Ddoritto Monogatari?) (March 1995)

The Black Knight ( Kokui no Kishi?) (July 1995)

The first volume forms the basis for the first eight episodes of the Record of Lodoss War OVA series, as well as the Record of Lodoss War: The Grey Witch manga series. The second was also adapted in manga form, and as a four-CD radio drama. The final five episodes of the OVA series are loosely based on the story told across the third and fourth novels and, having caught up with the ongoing novelization at that point, feature an original ending. The Record of Lodoss War: Chronicles of the Heroic Knight TV series is a more faithful adaptation of volumes three to seven. The first collection of short stories was adapted into the Record of Lodoss War: Deedlit's Tale manga series.",1488153600,,2441,4.641860465116279

7844456,2,6303363598,"I checked this one out at the library a while back and the dvd transfer was horrifically muddy and washed out, not to mention flat and pixelated. The English dub is okay, but the main hero's voice is probably the whiniest I've ever heard. On top of that, the dads skipped like crazy because they were scratched to infinity and beyond.

Even through all that, the knights and dragons motif and great artwork and music helped to make this one a classic. The battle with the dragon is not to be missed. The ending to the show is a bit anti-climactic compared to what i was expecting, but still, there aren't enough fantasy anime in the western style so this one doesn't have much competition.

This dvd release is ridiculously expensive and extremely poor quality compared to modern dvd releases. I have recently seen this series Blu Ray release synced up to the English dub included here and it completely blew my mind. It appears that over in Japan they rescanned the entire show from original elements ala Magic Knight Rayearth and Ah My Goddess. The effect is truly stunning. This release is a two star product, but the new Blu Ray release (with the English dub) is easily a five star product because it looks like the show was animated yesterday. The colors are deep and vivid, the artwork is amazing, and the everything is just so dang epic! Unfortunately in this dvd release monsters look like blobs, hits to the characters are hard to even see, and everything looks like you're watching it through dirty cheesecloth.

You can clearly see the difference cleaner masters make in other recent DVD rereleases of old anime classics like the newest release of Castle of Cagliostro and others. So my advice is... Don't buy this dvd set. Wait for someone to get their act together and release a new dvd boxset using the new HD transfers from Japan. You don't need Blu Ray to make this show look great, but you sure as Swords and Dragons need a new master so all the original detail in the artwork is visible.",1432771200,,2005,4.594972067039106
