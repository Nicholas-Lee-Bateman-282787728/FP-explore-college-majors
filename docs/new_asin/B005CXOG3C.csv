4655162,5,B005CXOG3C,"This is such an amazing documentary. Ali Codina did an excellent job of showing the ups and downs of Down Syndrome. This is an excellent film for parents of kids who have Down syndrome to watch. I was lucky enough to see it about a month after my son (who has Downs) was born; it gave me such a sense of relief and motivation. I was able to see that my son will have many of the same experiences that other adults have, and that his potential is high if I continue to work with him. Monica and David are an inspiration to me and my husband. Thank you!",1323216000,6,551,4.064220183486238

4655167,5,B005CXOG3C,"My husband and I watched this on Netflix the other day and we absolutely loved it. My brother is handicapped, so watching two people who have overcome their limitations and find love was extremely refreshing and inspiring. This is a happy story full of love, not only the love that these two have for each other, but the amount of love that surrounds them from their families. I truly wish that everyone in this world could be blessed with the love that they have for each other.

4655178,4,B005CXOG3C,"It is rare for anyone with Down's syndrome to get married.  Caregivers could have logical concerns if this will decrease or increase the chances of their needs being neglected after all the parents have died.  Monica's mother seems to think the risk is worth the comfort these two can provide each other.  Sadly, it does seem they have reached the limits of their independence in many ways.  The mom will spend many nights worrying if the money she leaves them will keep them out of a state institution if either regress.",1370995200,,521,4.6923076923076925

I am a dad of a 17 year old son with special needs and even though my son is not as high functioning as Monica & David, and will not be experiencing the life that Monica & David have been allowed by their families, I came away from the film feeling uplifted and hopeful.
