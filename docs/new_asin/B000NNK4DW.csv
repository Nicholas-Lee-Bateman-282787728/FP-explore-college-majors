2772238,5,B000NNK4DW,"By now the world knows these three beautiful women by name: Holly, Bridget, and Kendra are no longer described simply as ""Hef's Girlfriends"" (although they are...all 3 of them). Thanks to the E channels hit reality show the Girls Next Door, people are able to get to know these women, and take a quick glimpse into the amazing lives that they lead at the Playboy Mansion.

Holly is girlfriend #1 -- she sleeps with Hef in ""their"" bedroom, has been dating Hef for the longest (going on 6 years now!), and in general maintains the status of Lady of the House. She's a real sweetheart, and while she dreams to someday be able to marry Hef and start of family of her own, she still enjoys the close friendships she's made with Bridget (who has been dating Hef for about 4 years), and Kendra (who has been dating Hef for about 2 years now). The three of them together equal tons of fun, and they each bring a unique personality to the show.

This DVD boxset is awesome. It is 100% completely uncensored -- so anything that is either blurred, bleeped, or edited out for content control while the episodes air on live TV, is likewise left alone for the DVDs. Boobs, butt, and cuss words abound, so even if you've seen all the episodes on TV, I guarentee the experience is quite different once you view them again on DVD.

One of my favorite features of these discs would be the commentary. All three women provide commentary for each and every episode, and I fully recommend taking advantage of that fact. They will nitpick the episode apart, tell the audience when and where the network took a few too many liberties with the editing, and basically provide a little extra insight, and some interesting little tidbits. Holly personally stated that she loves doing the commentary for all the episodes because it gives her the opportunity to sometimes ""set the record straight"" and ""have the last word"" on some of the many mansion escapades!

Don't miss out, because these are seriously some of the most entertaining DVDs you'll own! I've considered it a very wise investment!",1191283200,23,2067,4.639344262295082
2772239,5,B000NNK4DW,"I'm a fan of the show, and own the first season also. Being a girl myself, I honestly didn't think I would like this show because I thought it was directed towards a male audience being that it has to do with playboy, but I was wrong. I love the show because the girls are funny and its interesting to see how they live and the things they do every day.  It's a fun show, buy it!",1190592000,3,379,3.9220779220779223
2772240,5,B000NNK4DW,I'm a big fan so as always very happy with this DVD.  Very happy also about the quality of service from amazon.  Look forward to doing business again in the future.,1190419200,,164,4.258064516129032
2772241,5,B000NNK4DW,"If you love the HEF and love watching 3 blondes actually prove to the world that they are not just dumb bimbos, then this dvd is for you. Holly, Bridget and Kendra all have different personalities that will make you feel like their best friend. It's hysterical to watch and of course it's playboy so there's other ""feelings"" there to. But being a female I watch this because I feel that no matter where you live, every female still has the same drama in their life as you. Except I don't live in a mansion or have a boyfriend that is over 80. But you do feel close to them in the end. I love watching this show and so should you.",1181779200,6,629,4.163934426229508

getting dressed, undressed and goofing around. I watch it while I

main menu. Three discs in all, with a paragraph for each episode in case you want to get right to the naught bits.",1181347200,9,398,4.424657534246576
2772243,5,B000NNK4DW,"I absolutely love the Playboy empire and this show is just another great aspect of it!  All the girls are so lovable and Hef's great personality is also featured on the show a lot.

Being a reality show on E - of course a lot of it is staged, but it doesn't come across that way.  The girls all seem to be so genuine and all their daily activities aren't overblown to make them seem like divas or gold diggers or anything.  It sounds almost silly to say, but Playboy and this show are just about as all American and genuine as it gets!

I think this show is great for men and women.  A bunch of beautiful women, a glimpse into Hef's life, funny situations... what more could you ask for!

The bonus features are always so funny as well.",1179273600,3,736,4.177304964539007
2772244,5,B000NNK4DW,when i first saw the adds for this show i thought it was going to be very stupid but it ended up being one of the funniest shows on t.v even if you don't like reality tv that much like me i think you would get a kick out of this show.,1177718400,3,234,3.519230769230769
2772245,5,B000NNK4DW,"How can I give 5 stars to something that hasn't even been released yet? It's simple, really. I loved the Season 1 individual episodes and DVD extras, and also thoroughly enjoyed every one of the 16 UNCENSORED Season 2 episodes (about 23 min. each) that I just finished watching (shown by Canada's StarTv channel). According to the press releases for the Season 2 DVD's, they're going to again be uncensored, in full-screen, and include more of the same jam-packed extras as before. So, as long as they don't screw anything up, it's going to be a sure-fire success.

The extras include: 48 deleted scenes totalling about 67 minutes in length, 7 extra minutes of the Halloween party episode, a special combined and extended version of the first two (Season 2) episodes (48 minutes long-includes some different scenes added to it), bloopers(as hidden Easter Eggs-see end of my review, for how to view them), commentary by the three girls on all of the 16 episodes and more.

I'd give the  Season #2 episodes 4 stars (same grade as the Season 1 episodes), even if there were NO Dvd extras, only because many of the episodes are similar to the Season 1 episodes. There's the Halloween party again and some of the trips the girls and Hef take remind me too much of the Season 1 trips (even though they do travel to many different places). That's not to say that they didn't offer anything new, but at times I wish something totally unexpected happened that required a new direction in the series. I imagine Holly's eventual pregnancy will do the trick for future season episodes. However, I still was eagerly looking forward to each new episode and wasn't bored at all. It's all still very well edited, superior, quality stuff. Bravo!

If you enjoyed Season 1, then get ready for 16 more of the same funny and addictive episodes that you've come to expect from this series, filled with just enough nudity and cursing (sweet, sweet Kendra), so that you're still satisfied, yet, not totally bored with it all. Now that we know the girls so well, no time is wasted with the sometimes dull character development stuff that naturally happens in first seasons. These girls stay virtually the same for the entire series, except for Bridget, who is now the more interesting of the three and most likely will be the one appearing on more television shows (Extra!,etc.) than the others. She's bright, well-spoken and has a killer sweet smile that almost never quits.

Yes, Kendra is still the true star of this series and still has her signature hilarious laugh and killer body, but she still seems just as immature (which is good for the series) at 21, as she was at 19, and still lacks the patience to concentrate for greater than five minutes at a time. I don't think she's as hilarious as she was in Season 1, but that could be just because I've gotten used to her. I still love her laugh, and also the way almost every time she passes by a mirror or is getting dressed, she can't resist shaking her booty and marvelling at it in the mirror. Priceless stuff.

 Holly's smart, stubborn and very creative, but seems more interested in having a baby than anything else. If Holly left the show I wouldn't really care. She's just taking away screen time from the other two more interesting girls in my opinion. Although, I still like her enough, and she does offer good contrast for the other two girls. So, if she left, the chemistry of the show would probably suffer.

Hef's in the episodes more often this time around, so they do seem more complete, more natural and smoother overall. However, in one episode, Hef does seem too fascinated with one of Kendra's childhood videos that he watches for the first time with her family (including the grandfather), so that he comes across as seeming very creepy. Kinder, or better editing, would have helped out there. Yuck...just the thought of that scene still creeps me out.

I haven't seen any of the Season 3 episodes yet, but I'll gladly watch those as well, when I get the chance. In the meantime, go watch Season 2 on Dvd, you'll be glad you did!

They all take the train to Kendra's home, including Hef who did not go to Brigette's home in season 1. Hef enjpys seeing Kendra's youth pictures. The deleted scenes consist of the butler showing a new guy how to handle Hef's closet, complicated!

Disk 2- Easter is the only childrens day at the mansion so that is celebrated, the girls are at a loss, no children for them in their situation. Brigette has a BIG birthday party for her DOG!

A Playmate slumber party and they aspire to TP a house, doesn't go well.

Additional celebration of Hef's 80th B-Day they all four go to Europe- London, Paris and see some shows, Spain, Germany, Rome.

Upon returning home they have a baby shower for a former playmate.

For Kendra's 21st B-Day they go to Las Vegas, clubbing and flashing, always good to hear her laugh.

Disk 3-Halloween, Elvira shows up, the girls go on a tour of where people died in LA, some skin. Then they appear on the Dr. Drew show wher they talk about weather size matters or not.

Holly and Hef celebrate 5-years, they get emotional, she getsx him fish for the tank.

2772262,2,B000NNK4DW,"I have forever been an admirer of Hugh Hefner and the fine advancement He's made in Adult Entertainment, and I've enjoyed Playboy since that first magical moment I opened one of His Magazines.

Even though I had never seen this show when it was on Cable TV, I'd heard a lot about it, that coupled with tha fact that these sets are uncensored and they could be acquired quite inexpensively, I purchased two seasons in hopes of spending many hours at the Mansion with Hef and his Ladies. The problem I have is, I don't like his Ladies! Kendra is an annoying Narcisist, Holly is a Phony in the videos, and we've learned, in real life as well, and I cannot remember the other ladies name. Undressed they look artificial and far from Erotic, and not one of them ever utters a single funny or clever word, and yet every time they speak, they giggle as if every word out of their mouth is adorable (especially Kendra), I don't want to know anything more about them, ever!

What I did like was the opening theme by Nasty Tales doing ""Come on a my House"", I purchased that at I-Tunes and it's proudly on my IPod, and I did as always enjoy watching Hef as he Entertained  his friends at the Mansion (Hef! I'd love to be a guest!) and watching as he flew in his Private Jet to NYC, the Man has always carried himself with Dignity, and I will continue to admire the work he does.",1330128000,,1367,4.311284046692607

2772269,5,B000NNK4DW,"I liked Season 1, but I LOVE Season 2.  In the first season, you kind of get to know the girls in a one-dimensional way -- Holly the house mother, Bridget the super-cute semi-intellectual and Kendra the not-too-bright sports fan.

This time around, there is a lot more to see and learn. Not only do the girls show their gorgeous bodies way more this time, but you also get a more rounded view of who they are. Who would have guessed that Kendra actually has a brain?  Mind you, just when you're beginning to think that she might just be the next Einstein, hiding away a super-intellect behind the dumb-blonde facade, she comes out with something mind-numbingly stupid (and quite sincere) to dispel that notion!  On the other hand, she's always very pleasant to look at, and you get to see much more of her in this season than the first.  Bridget, the most beautiful of the three, shows off her goofy side this time, but she's still just as adorable.

The highlight of the season is when the girls get their second Playboy photo-shoot.  This time around, in addition to the standard session as per Hef's wishes, the girls get to show their creative side. Each one chooses her own theme and directs the shoot, featuring herself and the other two girls. Holly chooses a Marilyn Monroe theme, Bridget indulges her love of King Kong, and in Kendra's case, it's American Football (what else?).  They do such a great job of it that contrary to their own expectations (and his) Hef actually loves their work and decides to feature their projects in the magazine. There is way more and better nudity this season, and along with the way we get to know the girls, this makes for the perfect package.",1225324800,5,1688,4.584717607973422
