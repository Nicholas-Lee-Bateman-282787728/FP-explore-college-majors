3425131,5,B00198FKKM,I follow Di van Niekerk's blog. I chose this for the variety of flowers so I could learn and practice them while creating a sampler.  Not disappointed at all.,1365465600,6,158,4.448275862068965
3425132,5,B00198FKKM,"If you can only buy one of the three DVD's in this 3 part DVD series, in my opinion, this was the best one for the following reasons:

The name and size of the needle is mentioned in each stitch tutorial
Most of the tutorials are actually on ribbon embroidery, the others focus more on regular embroidery
You will learn how to make many ribbon flowers on this DVD which is the main attraction of ribbon embroidery
As the third in the series I think the editors polished their technique so the professional production quality of this one is better than the first two",1303689600,26,565,4.4326923076923075
3425133,5,B00198FKKM,A great refresher for the expert and learning tool for the novice.  The 3 part series and the resulting embroidery are marvelous.  Stitches are broken down into chapters for easier access.,1223942400,11,188,5.032258064516129

8272560,4,B00198FKKM,"The DVD has great detail and is excellent for seeing how to do stitches.  I didn't realize it was specifically for the peice shown on the cover of the DVD rather than a ""generic"" DVD on how to do the stiches.  However, it still shows you how to do the stitches but only with the materials for that project.  I would still recommend the DVD but would like to see other applications of the stitches.",1420588800,,397,4.266666666666667
