5963184,5,B00F1H2EAQ,"This recording of Tosca created from performances on July 14 and 17 in 2011 brings together artists of considerable renown for a short run. These are Angela Gheorghiu as Tosca, Jonas Kaufmann as Cavaradossi and Bryn Terfel as Scarpia. To these must be added the considerable expertise of the conductor, Antonio Pappano. The production by Jonathan Kent has become a staple fixture in the Royal Opera repertoire and is unashamedly `traditional' in its concept.

The combination of such talents raised expectations that something very special could be achieved. As one who has a number of recordings by all of these artists, I can honestly state that, in my opinion, none of them has delivered anything finer individually and that this combination has resulted in a recording of Tosca that is gripping from start to finish and may well have exceeded even the most optimistic hopes of all concerned.

It must be made clear from the start that this is certainly not the performance that anyone other than purchasers of this disc will have seen as this is a combination of two performances, and presumably the best of each, uniquely available on this disc. Others attending the same production will crucially have heard different combinations of the cast so are not in a position to comment about this particular disc. Even attenders of either of these two nights or those who watched the TV broadcast will still not have experienced this particular edited product. The editing is seamlessly done so the whole final product runs as if it was one live uninterrupted performance.

The production, as mentioned above, is traditional but very well observed and convincing. The slowed down, and thus more chilling, entry of the execution squad in act 3 would be one of many examples of dramatic flair. Perhaps the most controversial part is the decision to show Scarpia in an unkempt guise as that would not fit with a serial womaniser. There is another interpretation of this though. Scarpia's libretto makes it clear that he is not interested in wooing any woman but simply exults in his power over them. What better way to reinforce this than to show his utter contempt additionally through his personal appearance? Any woman thus abused would feel doubly defiled.

This is a more theatrical production than the fine Verona alternative which was effectively tailored to a much larger canvas. In more general terms, this new recording appropriately offers a more intimate and more subtle rendering of the opera in countless ways throughout and which can only be briefly touched on in a short review such as this and as follows:

The outstanding contribution of Pappano and his orchestra cannot be overstated. This is a very flexible account of pace, phrasing and dynamics creating great emotional contrasts. Moments of chilling or dramatic power are contrasted with swiftly following gentle and sensitive passages. Everything is tailored exactly to the drama being played out on stage. A small example of this detailed attention to precise coordination, just as you would expect with a ballet, can be observed after Scarpia's death as Tosca places the two candles by Scarpia before exiting. The very moment that each candlestick bottom touches the floor is precisely accompanied by a soft woodwind chord. Tempo is withheld throughout this sequence as it is performed in free-time and the effect is extraordinarily powerful. Other performances simply are not this accurate.

The main cast is of the highest calibre, although there have always been those who do not warm to Gheorghiu as either a singer or as an actor. In my opinion she is on superb form here and delivers an astonishing degree of passion, either in full voice or sotto voce. The tingle factor was high for both me and my wife. Bryn Terfel manages outshines his earlier fine performance of Scarpio under Riccardo Chailly. He exudes evil and has just the voice and body mass to match the intentions of Scarpia as he effortlessly towers over both of his victims. This seemed to be casting against type with the earlier Dutch recording but, even thus prepared, I have been struck by the development in the role. This must almost be definitive. Jonas Kaufmann has the enviable ability to really live his part while delivering singing of tonal magnificence. This has led him to considerable world renown which is fully justified here. His voice has a similar tonal silkiness to my ears to that of Gheorghiu's and thus makes an ideal vocal match between the two. In addition, both Gheorghiu and Kaufmann have the right degrees of physical attraction and relative ages that make this a dramatically convincing coupling thus reinforcing the effectiveness of the drama.

The supporting roles are equally effective. The Sacristan, well sung and acted by Jeremy White, has far more character than usual. Little details like his tongue protruding as he concentrates all add to the impression of a subordinate character that could easily be controlled by Scarpia. Lucas Jakobski's Angelotti is also more strongly drawn than usual which is in line with his dramatic role as a suspected revolutionary. Hubert Francis, as a slim Spoletta, brings a level of vindictive evil to match that of the far larger physical presence of Terfel.

The camera work is totally engrossing and fully engages with the production. The imaging achieves a state-of the-art HD crispness and colour definition. The sound spectacularly captures the outstanding performance of the orchestra and the balance of the singers seems excellent to me. The sound is presented in DTS 5.1 and stereo. There is an 8 minute introduction included which is well presented by Pappano.

This is a star-studied production and has obviously aimed high. In my opinion it has hit all the targets and now stands as an outstanding modern version to join the fine but totally different modern production at Verona plus other fine recordings from previous generations. The audience were justifiably and wildly enthusiastic at Covent Garden in my opinion with a marked absence of the famed English reserve! On that basis, it seems likely that most purchasers of this disc to be equally enthusiastic and therefore a 5 star rating seems totally reasonable. This will not be a disc for those who do not respond to this sort of production or these singers of course, but that is not the remit of this review.

In conclusion I would suggest that this disc should warrant at least serious consideration from any purchasers looking for a fine modern recording of this popular opera.

5963185,5,B00F1H2EAQ,"In terms of concept, design and staging, there is nothing particularly innovative, imaginative, original or even too exciting about Jonathan Kent's direction for this 2011 Royal Opera House production of Tosca. It adheres to the period locations and action as they are laid out in the original libretto, each of the three acts recognisably taking place in specific locations in Rome - Act 1 in the church of Sant' Andrea, Act 2 in the Palazzo Farnese, Act 3 on top of the Castel Sant' Angelo - actual locations that have been used in the past for filmed versions of Puccini's opera. If there's little that is striking about the stage designs, which are functional at best, Kent stages the dramatic action within them to the full extent of the verismo realism that the opera calls out for.  What distinguishes a good traditional production of Tosca from all the others however, and what makes this Royal Opera House production something special, is the casting and the ability of the performers to bring something of their own unique character and ability to the work. It's hard to imagine a more stellar contemporary cast in the three principal roles than the one assembled here.

As Floria Tosca, Angela Gheorghiu is the ultimate diva playing a diva - a fact that she acknowledges in her interviews and clearly relishes. Those characteristics can often be pushed a little too far with this particular singer, who often plays the diva whether it's called for or not, but here at least it's appropriate and Gheorghiu is totally convincing. It's more than just good casting of course, since, as ever, Gheorghiu sings superbly. And not just from a technical viewpoint - which is hard to fault - but it's also an impassioned performance that is perfectly judged with complete understanding of her character and fits in well with the overall tone of the whole production. Consummately professional then - you would expect no less - but Gheorghiu is also genuinely impressive on every level.

Jonas Kaufmann is another performer who continues to impress, slipping effortlessly into whatever role he plays with a great deal of personality, but more than impress, the manner in which he brings that extraordinary voice to bear on such familiar roles is absolutely astonishing and quite unlike any previous account you might have heard of that role, so far is it from a typical tenor voice.  Powerfully controlled, his dark near-baritone boom makes his Cavaradossi here totally unlike Marcelo Alvarez or indeed any how any other classic tenor would perform the role. There is a fear that with such a powerful voice he could end up bellowing the words, particularly as there is ample opportunity for it, but Kaufmann retains complete control over the voice and the character, dropping it to quieter phrasing where it is required. I'm not totally convinced by the heroic nature of his performance here, which doesn't let in a great deal of humanity, but I suppose that's how Puccini mainly scores the role.

Bryn Terfel likewise has to make the most of how Scarpia is scored and try to strike a balance between a human and a caricature. He also sings wonderfully and certainly looks the part with enough physical presence and steel in his vocal delivery to make the evil pronouncements of the Chief of Police, heavily underscored as they are by Puccini, more than menacing enough, so the additional grimaces and sneers perhaps aren't all that necessary. The singing performances are all marvellous then, making the most of the roles and trying to find some balance and level of humanity in the characters - which isn't always easy in this opera - but best of all is how well they work together. On a vocal level the singing is perfectly complementary and there appears to be no struggle for dominance on the acting side either, each of them existing within their own characters but working with each other well. It makes it very easy then for the viewer to become wrapped up in the melodramatic events that occur over the 24 hour period of the story.

That's as much to do with the staging however, so while you can criticise Jonathan Kent's lack of imagination in the production design and the stage direction, it does at least work effectively on a dramatic level. Part of the reason for this is the decision not to downplay the opera's controversial depictions of violence. Make no mistake, it's all there in the libretto, from the extended torture scene through to the attempted rape, murder and executions, but some directors might choose to underplay these elements, particularly to mitigate against Puccini's full-blooded score. It's a difficult balance to maintain, and there's certainly no right or wrong way to do it. If you are aiming for realism in the set designs and you have singers who are also good actors, then it makes sense to let them fully enter into the roles and the cast here manage to do that without too much grimacing and operatic mannerisms. Matched with a perfectly judged performance of the Royal Opera House orchestra under Antonio Pappano, the result is an impressive, involving and near perfect account of Puccini's ""shabby little shocker"" as you could expect to see done anywhere in the world today.",1348012800,75,5223,4.882750845546787
5963186,5,B00F1H2EAQ,"This is an exceptional performance of Tosca! The staging is true to the composer's wishes-unlike some recent outings by other major opera houses! Angela Gheorghiou is Tosca! Ms. Gheorghiou has the required temperament for the role and her acting and natural beauty enhance her interpretation! Even though her voice may be a size small for the role, she sang well with good technique and beautiful tone! Jonas Kaufmann is the epitome of what Mario  should be! His spinto voice rang out in clarion, burnished tone! His acting was true and honest and very natural! Bryn Terfel has made Scarpia into a terrifying, evil man and his snarls and singing conveyed a sinister character! The costumes were exquisite in this production! Sound and quality of the Blu-Ray disc was exceptional!",1384819200,3,779,5.038759689922481

5963189,1,B00F1H2EAQ,"Now, I believe this is the new ROH production which comes to replace the famous Jefirrelli one. I am not an admirer of the past, but if you have something good in your hands, you do not touch it unless you have something to say. The huge problem here is the Scarpia character which the director portrays as a SLOB. Well, I am sorry, but Scarpia was everything but a slob. He was a fascist man-of-the-church type of bastard but a CLEAN CUT one and it was exactly this CONTRAST that made him even more terryfing and repulsive. Here you have a man that , quite frankly,looks like a mess, some sort of a marginal drunk that has just walked out of a London pub. Wrong, wrong, wrong. Terfel is indeed a terrific talent and does his best. But this is a character failure and his work is wasted. Then you have Angela Gheorghiu. Now, Angela Gheorghiu, if you examine the facts solely on the theatrical side, IS Tosca. Diva-ish, nervous, terribly insecure. I WOULD NOT BE SURPRISED if she were like that in real life. BUT she has a SMALL VOICE. To sing Tosca you have to be either a dramatic soprano (like Callas) or a lyrico-spinto one (like Price) and Ms Gheorghiu is neither of the two. So under the heavy Puccini orchestration she is struggling to be heard. She is aware of this fact and that adds up to her nervousness which makes her all the more like Tosca (visually). It is no wonder that she does so many cancellations. She wants to protect her voice against a very heavy repertoire that she so often chooses in order to make a great career. Despite her weak instrument, she is an intelligent and expressive artist with exemplary phrasing. Pappano does his best to help her out, but, after all, he has to do his job and conduct Puccini. Puccini is easier than bel canto in that the singer is not as exposed, but you have to have a strong voice and Ms Gheorghiu doesn't. And last but not least, we have Mr Kaufmann. Now, the guy is again visually a very convincing Mario. He is sexy and goodlooking which in itself justifies the jealousy felt by Tosca. He is also a very good actor succeeding in giving to the public the romantic and self-sacrificing nature of Mario. BUT he has the WRONG VOICE. And we thought that Domingo sounded like a baritone!!! Well, Kaufmann makes Domingo sound like a light tenor. He has a very dark, heavy and baritonal instrument which again leads to a character failure. You don't expect Mario to sound as heavy as this and Kaufmann CANNOT lighten his voice at all. But of course he takes on roles like this because nobody made a great career on Strauss and Wagner exclusively. So, to sum it all up, in my humble opinion, this is far from being a great Tosca. I would of course recommend it to anyone that is a fan of these singers and wants to enjoy an excellent blu ray picture. But it is a production hit by all the problems I described above. A much better alternative to my taste and mind is the Dessi-Armiliato Tosca sold by Amazon ASIN: B006UM05IO .",1366502400,10,2982,4.413793103448276
5963190,5,B00F1H2EAQ,"I have over 150 classical DVD/BRs that I watch on a 106"" screen and listen through a 7.1 loudspeaker setup where the front speakers are about 9' 6"" apart and the surround speakers are on my sides. The room has sound treatments so I hear what's on the disc, not distorting reflections from the walls. My reviews concentrate on the surround audio, as you can pretty much judge the video and stereo for yourself on youtube and similar sites.

Picture is fine. Colorful costumes and good lighting.

Sound is DTS-HD MA 5.1. Beautifully recorded detailed orchestra extents to the surrounds and gives you a sound stage of 160 degrees. Voices are well balanced with the orchestra and clear due to body mics, but they come mostly through the center. My only complaint. Applause from the sides, which also gives you the impression of sitting in a front row. I listen to this at a loudness setting of -11 db. It will get a bit over 80 db at the loudest passages, but most of the time it is more like a very detailed piece of  chamber music. Andy Rose came to mind, but the Music Producer is David Groves, Music Mix is Jonathan Allen. An excellent job.

This is my favorite cast and I can recommend it highly. 5 stars all around.

I also have the Verona Special Edition from 2006 with Fiorenza Cedolins as Tosca and Marcelo Alvarez as Cavaradossi. Sound is also DTS-HD MA 5.1 and well worth the price of $9.00. As an outdoor performance, it sports a large stage and a more impressive setting than the ROH. Sound stage is also 160 degrees, but the orchestra is not as detailed and overpowers the voices sometimes. The voices, however, move across the stage with the principals, which gives it more the feeling of a live performance.
I play this at a -7 db, at which the cannons at the end of  act one will hit 90 db. Not for the faint of heart, but at that level it really comes to live.
I rate the cast a bit below Gheorghiu/Kaufmann/Terfel, but it  is still very enjoyable in it's more forceful way and would get also 5 stars for surround audio.",1365552000,3,2034,4.436997319034853
5963191,5,B00F1H2EAQ,"Since I love Puccini's music a lot, and Tosca particularly so, I have gathered at home quite a collection of older recordings and more recent DVDs with the full opera. I have also seen it performed on stage a half dozen times. Angela Gheorghiu accomplishes a truly outstanding rendition of Floria Tosca, clearly surpassing in musicianship and vocal characterization older renditions by Callas (I have in mind the Callas- Di Stefano disc), Tebaldi (both Tebaldi - del Monaco disc and Tebaldi - Di Stefano), Kabaivanska (Kabaivanska - Domingo disc), L. Price (Price - Corelli disc), S. Verrett (Verrett - Pavarotti disc) and M. Freni (Freni - Pavarotti disc).

I won't bother enumerating the more contemporary recordings (Cedolins, Magee), because they are so far behind in quality that they will soon be forgotten.

As if Gheorghiu's performance wasn't enough of a marvel, this recording also benefits from a strong Cavaradossi (Kaufmann) and a very distinctive Scarpia (Bryn Terfel). Pappano's conducting is a further demonstration of his elective affinity for Puccini's musical universe.

+ If you want to hear Gheorghiu singing Tosca live, buy your tickets for September 2013, Vienna State Opera (four performances).",1364428800,6,1218,5.333333333333333

5963193,5,B00F1H2EAQ,"Magnificent! The best live performance of Tosca I have ever seen, and  indeed one one the finest DVDs of any opera I have come across. Angela Gheorghiu is at the top of her game, a performance to cherish along with her Mimi and Violetta.  Jonas Kaufmann is in great voice and makes a very attractive Cavaradossi.  And I can't imagine a better Scarpia than Bryn Terfel's -  the slimiest, most lecherously evil performance of the role I could imagine, and wonderfully sung.  The overall production/staging is excellent and Pappano draws an invigorating, exciting  performance from the Royal Opera House Orchestra. Overall, a most vigorous, exhilarating and yes, beautiful performance of Puccini's great work.",1362355200,3,706,5.20353982300885
5963194,5,B00F1H2EAQ,"I agree this is a wonderful performance.

However, purchase with caution.  I bought my Blu-ray copy from Amazon UK when it first became available in October.  Before it even arrived, I received a note saying there was a manufacturing defect and a replacement would be sent in November.  No need to return the defective one that was in the mail.  The defect turned out to be that the audio was lost part way through the bows, not during the performance.

Nothing came in November and finally a few weeks ago I wrote to Amazon UK asking about the replacement.  They told me there was no anticipated date for sending the replacement and instead they processed a credit to my account.  I see they are selling the Blu-ray version again or maybe they just never revised it.  I don't know.

I recommend ordering it with caution whether it is from the UK or when it becomes available in the US.  I don't know if there were any issues with the regular DVD version.",1356393600,4,955,4.494186046511628

8611531,5,B00F1H2EAQ,"This is one of the most riveting and satisfying performances of Tosca I've ever experienced. There is a real sense of drama and power and I am very glad this is offered as a DVD, because a CD would come nowhere close to conveying the sheer electricity of this performance in the same way viewing the cast act as well as sing does.

Gheorghiu delivers a rich, beautiful and very dramatic portrayal of Tosca, satisfying in every way. Kaufmann's performance is also rich, beautiful and dramatic, and he certainly plays the part very convincingly. This leaves Terfel, who apart from offering a beautifully and dramatically sung performance, with richness, authority and menace, everything you could wish for in a Scarpia, he also delivers a positively unhinged performance, making Scapia out to be a sheer maniac, driving by lust, greed and pure agression. It is over the top in the best way and really raises the stakes for the other characters.

Pappano leads the Covent Garden orchestra in an excellent, lush, dramatic and powerful reading that ranks among the best and most satisfying readings ever recorded. This is a clear first choice among modern Toscas, all the better in that it is a DVD that allows one to enjoy the whole experience by the best possible team of singers available today in one of the world's greatest opera houses.

8611532,5,B00F1H2EAQ,"I'm in the pro camp with other reviewers - a favorite Puccini opera - a favorite cast - great costumes and production.  I still value the movie version with Domingo and his production with Malfitano as two of the best Toscas (I probably have around 10 different productions in my library) this is certainly up there with the Domingo versions but such a delight to have a new one as well sung and acted as this version.  I love it!  Saw it in theater and couldn't wait to get my Blue Ray and I've watched it several times and my admiration has grown.  Great version and I highly recommend its purchase.

Now that I'm 75 and living in an apartment on SS:  the best investment I've made in my lifetime (to keep my sanity) is my opera collection of  DVD's and CD's.

8611537,2,B00F1H2EAQ,"Individually all the singers are very good, as proved by prior recordings of other works. But their performance on this opera is really below any reasonable expectation, particularly from a visual point of view.
The worst of all is the characterization of Scarpia by Bryn Terfel. According to Puccini's play Scarpia is a mean and cruel but sophisticated individual; however the performance of Mr. Terfel is far from that and instead shows the image of a vulgar individual that is more close to be a butcher than a refined person.
Angela Gheorghiu is also miscast in the Tosca role. The main reason for that is that she is not a young lady any more and therefore it is difficult to visualize her as the character that generates such atraction to both Cavaradossi and Scaarpia.
Finally, Jonas Kaufmann has both the presence and the voice to be an excellent Cavaradossi. However in this recording he seems to be distracted and performing without any interest his role.
In my view this recording does not qualify for more than one star; however I gave it two stars out of respect to the individual quality of each singer in other recordings.
I would recommend to any person that wants to watch a good Tosca recording to find the version with Domingo, Kabalvanska and Milnes.",1428364800,2,1270,4.777272727272727
8611538,1,B00F1H2EAQ,"I expected to be getting a treat for a fairly low price for a Blu-ray. Instead I got less than I paid for. Upon all is fine conductor with many fine recordings to his credit. But I found it he kept lightening the orchestra whenever Ghioghiu was singing in order to let her be heard.  She simply doesn't have a big enough voice for this role in this house. She uses her voice well it's well colored and she doesn't sing louder than she ought. She's also missing the big personality than a Tosca requires to sell the role. The only time she reaches fortissimo is when she's telling Mario how she killed Scarpia.
Kaufmann on the other hand can't stay away from fortissimo at every opportunity. He still has a mezzavoce but that's for warming up cor the next fortissimo opportunity. It's not healthy singing and it's not real communication, which is what singing's about. One of the problems is that Kaufmann is not a spinto, he's a heldentenor and is marvellously effective in Wagner, Strauss and lieder.
But that's not where stardom and the big bucks are these days. Thanks to the Three Tenors and their shopping mall fans, singing the loudest for the longest is now the measure of artistry. But everyone forgets what Pavarotti, Domingo and Carreras sounded like when they were younger and still had healthy voices. They didn't have to shout to make their point - they could do it with beauty. I recently went back to listen to an ""83 Ernani from the Met with Pavarotti - God what a voice he had! It brought tears.
I found Terfel disgusting and uninteresting. Our introduction to him is watching him do bugeyes and it doesn't get much better. This man is an educated Italian nobleman who we are supposed to believe is a psycho. I don't find psychos to be interesting. And as others have mentioned he's a slob, who is supposed to be tremendously powerful and wealthy, as well as highly connected in the church. I'm sure there are some of his type running around today and I guess most of them seem to have television programs.
This past week I was watching several other Tosca's I recently received, both vastly superior to this production. One from Zrich a few years ago with Magee, Kaufmann and Hampson. Magee caught the spirit of Tosca perfectly and has the voice, figure and acting ability to back it up. Kaufmann, a few years earlier used his voice much more effectively and didn't rely on fff nearly as much. Hampson presented Scarpia as intelligent, cunning and utterly amoral - a fascinating and terrifying character and a superbly communicative voice.
I hardly noticed that there were changes in the setting except for that the end of the first act where Magee is presented as Regina Coeli on a glittering gold altar. The Blu-ray of that is going to be spectacular! The 5.1 audio and video on the DVD were just fine however.
A production from the Puccini Festival on the Dynamic label was presented in a much more theatrical rather than operatic style.
The sets and costumes were wonderful the singing was fine and the singers ignore the audience and stayed in their relationships with each other. There was a higher level of physicality with Tosca being dragged across part of the stage and being thrown onto a bed by Scarpia, and much more subtle use of lighting than we're used to seeing in an operatic production. I strongly recommed seeing it.
Another great Tosca is on Blu-Ray from Dessi/Armiliato/Sgura from 2010. Dessi and Armiliato are great as usual but of note is Sgura, a baritone to watch. This production is evocative of the '64, Callas/Gobbi Covent Garden kinescope. Sgura is the manicured, controlling italian nobleman who is scary in his self-assurance. His voice is a perfectly controlled, resonant baritone - and he's YOUNG! I'm looking forward to more productions including him. And I see he's in a butterfly that was recently issued.
You thought you were going to get out of here with just one Tosca?",1410825600,12,3927,4.699564586357039
