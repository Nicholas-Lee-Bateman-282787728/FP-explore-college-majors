I think Collins, director and actor playing roles of the killer and the old man(police make no appearance, would have been better off focusing on either acting or directing but not both. Most of the story shows Collins dramatically narrating the story and he is no Vincent Price (who does an outstanding reading of the story).  I don't think it would have taken much creativity to dramatize the entire, or at least most, of the story.  The one upside to the film is that the story remains largely unabridged and only minimally changed by the actor's rewording of some lines.

It will fit the bill for teachers who wish to use this in a Poe unit or in conjunction with The Tell-Tale Heart but most people will not want to waste the time.  Sorry.",1345939200,,888,4.5886075949367084
8219568,2,B000VPNQLE,"I am a Poe fan and was looking forward to this DVD hoping it might be a visual introduction for my children to the world of Poe. Upon previewing Mr. Collins' interpretation, I decided it did very little to intrigue the viewer to read and appreciate the works of Edgar Allan Poe.  I would not pay money for this one. Maybe I set my expectations too high but with Mr. Poe's stories that IS where I start.

Warning this review could be a spoiler if you don't know the story!
I gave the DVD 2 stars because I believe this monologue was a difficult project otherwise I'd have planted but 1 star on the review. The filming, lighting and acting had to come together to set the stage for the doomed murderer to give himself away. Too many close ups of Mr. Collins and the bad make-up on the old man distracted us from the words of Mr. Poe.
The beginning shows the madman in a prison cell. So there will be no surprise at the end and thus no anticipation, no wondering the fate of the murderer.
As Mr. Collins is narrating, I become uncomfortable with repetitious facial expressions such as widening eyes and hand mannerisms. When describing the removal of the head, he adlibs a comical finger across the neck and makes the typical noise, ""creechk"", made when someone signals a death. That lost 2 stars then and there from me.
He paces the floor at one point and it seems as though he is looking for a mark on the floor to know when to stop and turn.
The setting is too modern for my interpretation. Either be true to the time or completely go modern and re-invent the story for today. This version got lost somewhere in the middle and lost its effectiveness.
Mr. Collins is obviously acting here, mostly overacting and is never in character. A perfect opportunity to show the madness would have been when the madman picked up the chair he was sitting on and scratches it on the planks above the old man's heart. Mr. Collins substitutes one of those round stools that spins to adjust the height and places it on a rug. To quote Poe's text ""I swung the chair upon which I had been sitting, and grated it upon the boards..."" The madman has anger tinged with frustration at the noise he cannot quiet but in Mr. Collins' interpretation I did not get the feeling that the madman wanted to cease the noises he heard from beneath the floor boards. That was the essence of ""The TELLTale heart"" and I emphasize TELL. I did get the feeling he did not want to dammage the floor of the house where this was filmed. There is no madness here.
To sum, Mr. Collins got lost somewhere between narrating and acting. He has a good voice but his mannerism and acting take away from the story.
When I read Mr. Poe's words, my heart beats with anticipation of the next move of madness. When I watched Mr. Collins, my heart ached with disappointment.",1199059200,3,2818,4.406909788867562
