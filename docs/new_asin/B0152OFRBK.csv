7428551,5,B0152OFRBK,True WWII story about the Germany's effort to develop the atomic bomb and the Allies determination to stop them.  This is a Norwegian miniseries with excitingly told with an international cast of actors.  The spoken language is listed as Norwegian however much of the movie is in English when the focus switches to the Allies operation's headquarters in Scotland.  German is spoken when the scene shifts to what's happening in Germany.  I liked that.  It's really is very good!,1462320000,5,477,4.987341772151899

7428554,5,B0152OFRBK,This was an excellent portrayal. I did some research myself before I saw this film. This one seemed to follow the actual history very well.,1461456000,2,139,4.6
7428555,5,B0152OFRBK,"very interesting movie about the struggle to keep ""heavy water"" out of Hitler's hands; a tale of amazing courage, tragedy and triumph in a little-known country which sacrificed much, and the men and women whose bravery and tenacity won this particular war for all of us.",1461196800,2,270,4.891304347826087
7428556,4,B0152OFRBK,"A good recap of the historic effort to prevent the Third Reich from developing the big bomb first. In reality had the Germans succeeded in putting together the ingredients for a nuke they wouldn't have been able to put it all into explosive form with delivery systems prior to the war's end but it was still a risky thing to allow it to get that far.

Done on a budget with plenty of time for character development, an international cast of mostly internationally unknowns was put together but the acting was very good, both in the lead and supporting roles. The filming was also good enough and the story plot moved along well, alternating between the Brits, Norse and German groups involved. This not being a US film the Americans as always are portrayed as bombastic loud bullies. The German SS also as always portrayed as ignorant perpetually threatening entities hovering around the Norwegians, the German soldier guards being completely oblivious to guarding anything thus easy targets to sneak up on and eliminate. But I guess there needs to be some entertainment bling.

The film does highlight the tragic first effort to destroyed key components of a factory, situated in a rugged Norway fjord in winter, that produces heavy water necessary for nuke production (around 40 Brit soldiers lost). The second attempt using smaller groups of Norwegians is successful but not complete. The table banging evil  Americans insist on a massive bombing attempt that does little but kill good looking innocent civilians and the director makes sure we all know that. Then the coup d'etat .... the Brits come up with a scheme carried out by the Norwegians to settle the whole matter.

What I liked most about the film is it did cover the essential main historical events, the quandary prominent scientists faced behind the Nazi curtain, and shed some light on how serious the situation really was back then without benefit of hindsight. I didn't love this film but I liked it hence four stars.",1458864000,5,1987,4.887240356083086
7428557,5,B0152OFRBK,"I consider myself a WWII afficionado and, without a doubt, this is one of the best told stories I have seen/heard/read. Extremely well made. Enjoyed thoroughly and watched all six episodes in a day. Loved it!",1458432000,6,208,4.805555555555555
7428558,5,B0152OFRBK,"Excellent acting, compelling story based on fact - can't beat this. It's a bit of an effort to follow; in the manner of The Longest Day, characters speak the languages they should speak, so Germans speak German, Norwegians speak Norwegian, etc. It's worth the effort though; in the US, we don't tend to think of Norway as having had much of a part in World War II, so it matters that stories like this are told.

This is one story of Germany's efforts to develop The Bomb. Norway was producing D2O, the ""heavy water"" referred to in the title, as a byproduct in fertilizer manufacturing. This is a riveting tale of collaborators, resistance fighters, and, in no small part, Norway's winters.

This is very much worth the watch, even with the subtitles.",1457740800,8,751,4.681818181818182
7428559,5,B0152OFRBK,"Thoughtful, realistic, spaciously paced account of an important and underappreciated war story. The subtle, stony Norwegian cast gives it a unique flavor that is hard to find on American television and the characters are well-developed.",1456876800,3,236,5.771428571428571
7428560,5,B0152OFRBK,"Beautiful, Thoughtful and Realistic - far different than any Hollywood 'War Movie'.  It made me think what it must have been like for my Dad when he went off to the Pacific Theater, and Mom (his girlfriend then) waiting for him in small town Illinois USA.  Superbly acted by the entire cast.  Subtitles (German, Norwegian) for English speakers.",1456185600,3,344,4.896551724137931

This [heavy water] factory has seven floors made of armed concrete.  I [Leif Tronstad, see below] built this plant.  We need someone to get the explosives into the basement.  Thats why it has to be a small group.  A group of five [soldiers] who know the area.

The above comes from this episodic war drama produced by the Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation.

It tells the real-life story from World War 2 (1939 to 1945) of the German efforts (headed by German theoretical physicist Werner Heisenberg, 1901 to 1976) to develop the nuclear bomb and the Allies struggle (facilitated by Norwegian scientist, professor, researcher, intelligence officer, military organizer, and athlete Leif Tronstad, 1903 to 1945) to keep it from happening.  (Note that its Heisenberg that utters the quote that titles this review.)

Deuterium oxide or more commonly, ""heavy water"" (a special type of water), is needed make a nuclear bomb and the only place that supplied it during the war years was a factory in Norway.  It is this factory that is the Allies make their very difficult target.

This movie is a thriller that in my opinion is a high-quality production with superb acting, great cinematography, and excellent directing.

I especially liked how the movie integrated nuclear science into the storyline without taking away from the movies intrigue.

Featured in this film are English, Norwegian, and German actors.  Filming took place in Norway and the Czech Republic.

Background music was supplied by the City of Prague Philharmonic Orchestra.

Each episode ends with the following in the end credits:

This T.V. series is based on actual events, but for narrative purposes some elements have been simplified.  Likewise, certain characters are fictitious.

The case that holds the DVDs (shown above by Amazon) for this movie is interesting.  The cases front cover shows a deuterium or heavy hydrogen atom that has a swastika for its nucleus.  This is exactly what the Germans are trying to exploit since its the nucleus of the deuterium atom that makes heavy water possible.

Finally, there is some debate over this movies historical accuracy.  Thus some historians may be enraged (they forget that this is not a documentary) but I think most viewers will be engrossed.  I know I was.

In conclusion, this is how wartime adventure SHOULD be done!!

Their were a lot of things in the Movie I did not know and was happy that they explained things so well that laymen (and myself) could understand why this material was so important in the development of nuclear reactors to make uranium 235 for use in bombs.  All WW II history buffs should have this Movie in their collection.

7428572,5,B0152OFRBK,"The Heavy Water War is a well written 6 episode series about the Allies attempts to sabotage the Norwegian heavy water production plant during World War 2. The acting is uniformly of high standard and the cinematography excellent.
The movie conveys the angst suffered by military personnel making strategic decisions to destroy a large consignment  of heavy water in order to prevent Germany achieving the production of the atomic bomb, at the same time knowingly causing the death of 30-40 innocent civilians, including women and children.
Nobel laureate, physicist Werner Heisenberg was portrayed accurately as a person who wanted to raise his family in Germany, push the boundaries of physics but displaying unease about the development of a weapon of mass destruction.
The series accurately relates an episode in the war which could have ended very differently if the repeated episodes of sabotage had failed.",1467936000,3,913,5.296551724137931

7428574,3,B0152OFRBK,"I have several brief comments. First; this looks like a remake of ""Heroes of Telemark"" which starred Kirk Douglas. I was surprised no one mentioned that in the reviews.
Also: distorted historical drama is always problematic. Should one produce history then do so. If producing drama, then perhaps forget the history and just tell a nice story. The German deuterium program was not directed toward a bomb, it was directed towards power production, ie., electricity. Perhaps the story lacks sufficient attraction to a modern audience without something more dramatic than ""revolutionary power plant theories falling into German hands!"" And so, The German Bomb becomes the plot.
Ironically, nations do fight wars over economic issues, including power production, and to some extent power production is a strategic priority.",1466726400,,819,5.456692913385827
