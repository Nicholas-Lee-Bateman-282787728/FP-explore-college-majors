Leap Year was not as good as I had exopected. We follow a lonely woman journalist who works from home and enjoys one night stands. The story is reasonable but this si not something I would bother to watch again.",1356912000,,258,4.285714285714286
4662009,4,B005DU58QS,"This is a film that is hard to categorise, described by some commentators as a graphic portrayal of loneliness, it is that but a hell of a lot more. It tells the story of one month, February,  in the life of Laura; played with remarkable sincerity by Monica de Carmen. She is desperately alone; she works from home for a business magazine called -  imaginatively enough -`Your Business'. She fills the emotional void by fantasizing about people she sees, pretending that they are her friends, or by going out and picking up random hombres for sex. They all have one thing in common and that is they like doing a post coital `runner' - before the sheets have dried.

Then she meets Arturo and they go at it hammer and tongs as the old saying has it. She seems to be quite imaginative in the experimental sex department and as it develops it starts getting more into the sado masochistic side and the ritual humiliation - like watersports, before going ever darker.

This is a directorial debut for Australian director Michael Rowe and to call him ambitious is an under statement. To tackle such themes was always going to be challenging, yet he has done it in a caring yet honest way. There is also no background music at all; this lends itself to the realism he is aiming to create in that all of the emotion evinced from the film is through the on screen performances.

This film has garnered many plaudits including one at the Cannes Film Festival but whilst it should be praised for its high `art' value, it will not be every bodies cup of tea, actually it could very well put most people off their tea with some of the scenes. This is also not pornographic as it is filmed in such a straightforward fashion, that it lacks all sense of eroticism as this is a study of someone actually losing it, but at the same time being very loving. Convincing performances all round but especially from Monica de Carmen. The language is Spanish (Mexican) with excellent sub titles and a run time of 92 minutes. So if you want a bit of truly art house, original, world cinema this will be one you will want to see.",1331856000,46,2103,4.48041775456919
4662010,3,B005DU58QS,"I came across this movie and being that this year is the leap year, I decided to see it.  It is a foreign movie, made in Mexico and it may not be readily acceptable by the American audiences.  The reason I say that is because this is not a fast moving film.  Director takes his time to explain the main character, Laura.  The entire film, with exception of the very first beginning of it is filmed inside the apartment.

Laura is a journalist.  Her days are spent in front of her computer.  Even her interviews with her subjects are conducted over the phone.  She talks to her editor and her family on the phone,she never sees them face to face.  In her spare time, Laura quietly observes her neighbors who live in her apartment complex.  She dares not approach them.  It becomes obvious, very early in the movie that Laura lives in the fantasy world.  If she does not have enough action, she makes it up and shares it with her mother during phone conversations and her brother who occasionally visits her in her apartment.

Laura goes out and seems not to have any difficulty picking up dates. Her encounters are brief and most guys she meets are one night stands.  Until one evening, she finds a seemingly perfect date.  She finds a guy who satisfies all her fantasies and they hit it off fine.  Soon enough, it becomes obvious that Laura has obsessions with the February 29th date.  It is through her relationship with her last lover that we learn that her father died four years ago, on February 29th.  What really touched me is that for a person who is a pathological liar and who seems to numb her emotional pain with sex, Laura is sincerely grieving the death of her father.  It is heartbreaking that after four years, her longing for her father did not diminish and her grief is intensified with time.

I loved the ending.  When a fatal day comes, Laura has made a decision on how she wants to end her mourning.  It is on that very day that her fate changes and she finally finds her purpose.  But to find out what happens, you must see this movie.  Be patient and with some intense search for truth inthis very emotional story about loneliness and search for purpose, one will actually like this movie very much.",1329091200,28,2221,4.467661691542289

4662012,3,B005DU58QS,"I really like how Michael Rowe describes the solitude of the megalopolises by following 29 days of the life of Laura in her room.

All the main actress did in the first 30-45 minutes was grocery shop, do something on her laptop, eat, talk to family on the phone, show her getting ready to go out at night and then show back up at her apt with some stranger and they do it. And when they cut to the scene of them doing it, they are about 10 seconds from finishing. The action is very fake and they are always so out of breath when they are done. The wife and I fast forwarded through so much of it because it was so boring. We were hoping for a lot more and believable action. Very disappointed.",1474243200,6,581,4.105263157894737

4662045,4,B005DU58QS,"This movie was not all what I expected but in a good way. It is a story about a mexican girl who is a self emplyeed journalist who works at home. She is far from pretty or sexy and she usually get rid of sexual desire by havng intercourse with a bunch of unknown men whom she meets on the bar or something. If not then she sees her neighbourhood couple and she masterbates.
As I said, she is far from pretty and at the beginning it is hard to love her that way. But as time goes by we begin to see her in a different way. She never complains or blames someone else that she is lonely or has no proper relationship with man.
But it was the time when she meets this a little old guy who is trying to be an actor that changes her. He and Monica Del Carmen(the woman) that are doing all kinds of dangerous things together which is a sadomasochistic relationship. Then she opens her mind that she no longer wants to live anymore. She put a mark on her calender in a day which is the day she will die. Then she asks the man that that day he should kill her with a knife while having sex. He agrees to do so. Now we are nervous since we know that we will see her death.
But he didn't appear that day. Also that day her brother had trouble with his girlfriend and cries for help to his sister.
Now the D-date has been past. Her life goes on.
The story becomes a happy ending in some sort because she has to live and keep her life go on. But on the other hand it is against her will that she has to live. She is living autimatically. But anyway, she won't die at least.
Sometimes if you want to die, if that very moment just passed, you can just go on living. That's it. It can be just one moment that you really really want to die.
She will live and she will keep working as a jouranlist and eventually meet a new man. Maybe.
I am sure for that.
There are a lot of sex scenes but none of them are sexual. They seems like corpse having sex together.
You will see what I mean if you watch this film.
There is reasons why the director casted these actors and he succeded to do so. This is his first feature and it is like his 10th feature.",1460505600,2,2128,3.9742990654205608

About the film:

Laura is a young woman living on her own in a small apartment in Mexico City.  Just like everyone, she has her own problems.  She is originally from the Mexican state of Oaxaca, where her mother still lives.  Her father is dead, her younger brother often visits her, and she is trying to make living as a writer for a local newspaper...once in a while she cuts loose and goes out to find a lover for a night...one night she comes back to her apartment with...

If you enjoyed Leap Year (2010) and would like to see similar movies, I recommend viewing: The Girl Cut in Two (2007), Ajlawju (1999), Day of the Wacko (2002), Y Tu Mama Tambien (2001), Sex and Lucia (2001), Lust, Caution (2007).",1425859200,13,1562,4.606498194945848
4662061,5,B005DU58QS,"This movie is raw and the actors are fearless. There is no holding back: nudity, sexual situations, loneliness, depression, isolation and the desire to self harm are all captured in a bleakly realistic style. Laura is an average-looking woman with a sad past who feels disconnected from society and feels like she will not live past a certain date. She finds that connection through sex, increasingly violent and degrading sex (she is a willing participant & sometimes instigator). I found this movie had intelligent points to make about the human condition, and I saw some parallels between this and one of my favorite films, Breaking the Waves, if only because they both show how grief and promiscuity are symbiotic. I enjoyed the ending too: her brother visits, showing that she isn't really alone, she's been overlooking her closest connection, something many of us do.",1424822400,11,873,5.069444444444445

She is a somewhat shy and unattractive free lance writer from Central America living in a tiny apartment in urban Mexico.  Her father died on leap year almost four years earlier, and the significance of this anniversary really begins to weigh on her in an existential way.  Romantic failures, professional failures, and brief visits from her emotionally damaged younger brother ratchet up the suspense.  Finally, a man enters her life who will stir the pot.

4662068,1,B005DU58QS,"Ao Bisiesto (Leap Year) (Michael Rowe, 2010)

I am willing to admit right up front that some of my problems with this movie come from the fact that I'm really, really uncomfortable with some of the material presented here. When the Netflix description said main character Laura (Babel's Monica del Carmen) gets involved in a sadomasochistic relationship, I figured that was probably the Netflix blurbers' much-storied hyperbole kicking into action, and halfway through the movie, when we get to the kind of butt-smacking that causes women in porn films to exclaim oh, YEAH! in THAT voice, I figured my preconceptions were going to be borne out. But oh, how wrong I was, and like I said, I will admit up front that if you are more comfortable with such things, you might find less to criticize here than I did.

But note: I said might, because the empirical problems with this movie are still there, and they are still mighty.

Plot: Laura is a journalist leading a spectacularly unfulfilling life while keeping up appearances for the folks back home. (I'm having dinner... I just made steak, she says during a phone conversation to her mother, while scooping beans straight out of the can.) Her love life, in particular, is not giving her anything she needsit's a series of one-night stands and masturbatory fantasies that leave her no better off than she was before they happened. Until, that is, spurred on by her younger brother (The Ruination of Men's Marco Zapata) finally getting involved in a stable relationship, she decides to go looking for one herself and gets involved with Arturo (Amores Perros' Gustavo Snchez Parra), who quickly reveals himself to be a brutal, abusive, overly jealous cad of the sort that would have most people fleeing screaming in terrorbut Laura seems perfectly fine with it.

It's impossible to watch any sexual-obsession drama from Mexico these days and not compare it to Batalla en el Cielo, Carlos Reygadas' confusing, but accomplished, debut. In short, there is no metric by which you can compare this movie to that one in which this does not fall short. Rowe's faux-cinema-verite camerawork is laughable most of the time, used more as an excuse for crappy lighting and sound more than any artistic pretension (though not to say this movie isn't painfully pretentious). The pace is nonexistent in the first half and glacial in the second, and I say this as a huge fan of such slow-film masters as Ozu, Kieslowski, and Tarr. Simply put, there's nothing here; it's a slice-of-life drama with not enough slice for the S&M fiends and not enough life for anyone else. Half a star because, despite my desperately wanting to, I did not shut it off, persevering to the bitter (and entirely unfulfilling) end. ",1361491200,8,2741,4.898706896551724
8467553,5,B005DU58QS,"This is not what the poster makes it out to be. It is in no way ""soft core porn"" or some kind of ""erotic thriller"" or whatever  you are thinking. This is a deeply thoughtful and intense study of a woman who wants to commit suicide. It is minimalistic and painful and a work of art. If you care about movies, this is something you should see. The fearless lead, Monica del  Carmen, received the highest Mexican award there is for acting (the Ariel) for her work. She deserved it. Bold and powerful.

The sadomasochist element isn't the focus and it isn't really important how good the ""action"" is, it's just a part of what makes us think about what's going on in Laura's head. And that's the point- this is a movie that makes you ruminate about the character's psychology and what makes her do what she does.
