8396238,5,B003FX80JM,"This is not the book, this is a 6 part VIDEO series (which has a study guide)  loosely based on the book. Very good but not the book.  I buy copies of the book and pass it on to friends. Greatest modern book on Christian discipleship written in my opinion. I have been a Christ follower since I was 19 and I am life-level 53 now. Wish I had read this when I was younger. This VIDEO is a six part series on the subjects of the book and is a good home Bible study as in intro or supplement to the book. Read the book...this video is just for a group home Bible study

The book itself is an answer to prayer for the typical Evangelical (I was one) who needs revival in their life and may not understand that Jesus invites us to be His daily disciple (apprentice). Many are  paralyzed by the ""grace vs. works"" explanation we all typically hear (I was). One word of caution; This book is written on the Seminary/master's degree level and is can be difficult for some folks to get through. I had to read each chapter a few times myself. Don't let that deter you, learning how to be transformed into the image Christ should take effort. Grace is not opposed to effort, it is opposed to earning. Earning is an attitude. Effort is an action."" DWillard",1457913600,,1242,4.25
