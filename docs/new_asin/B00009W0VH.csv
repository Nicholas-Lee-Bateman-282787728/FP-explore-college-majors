1891548,4,B00009W0VH,"This Yoga DVD is a one of a kind! I was very plesently surprised with how much yoga was on it! It is very easy to use and theres a workout for every time of day. I found parts of the longer routine a bit challenging, but I especially liked the ""Yoga Bath""  (evening routine). It really works great to help me sleep. There is also an additional section that explained the different breathing techniques, which was very valuable. I own 4 different yoga videos, this is the second DVD I've bought -and it is by far my favorite one so far. Its a great value. (and the music is very soothing too)",1061337600,18,591,4.230088495575221
1891549,3,B00009W0VH,"I would like to give this DVD a higher score, but I am still a little annoyed over its misleading cover. The cover has a photo of the lovely Ms. Behl performing a yoga asana dressed only in an orange bikini. I assumed she would be wearing this pleasantly revealing costume for at least part of this DVD, but she doesn't! Most of the time she wears a bikini bottom and a more covering vest-type top. She still looks wonderful performing her asanas, but I just wish she was wearing that orange bikini. Maybe next time, Ms. Behl?",1061251200,4,526,4.377551020408164
1891550,2,B00009W0VH,I was disappointed when I tried to do this DVD. One needs to be very flexiable/ and or a contortionist to be able to do the moves in the DVD. Its definitley NOT for the beginners. I wouldn't recommend this to any beginners. More for the advance person.,1388102400,,252,4.270833333333333
1891551,5,B00009W0VH,"I sit all day at a computer.
Shoulders tense.
Neck Bugs me.
Mid Back gets funky.

Hemalaya's night routine works all this out in a way that no other routine has done for me. None. And I've tried many. This combination feels weird at first, but it is magic. Get into it. Believe it. Let your body unwind.

My only CAUTION: Unlike what Hemalaya suggests, based on my experience and teachings from my Yogi's, do not move your head back & forth when in bridge or shoulder stand. The risk of hurting your neck in this position is too high to take. If you know what you are doing or have had guidance from a Yoga Teacher you trust who has solid body mechanics understanding & credentials, then go for it. For those who are just coming to yoga, just skip that part and follow the rest of the ""let the jaw relax, create space, etc."" as she guides you.",1384300800,2,843,4.2625
1891552,4,B00009W0VH,"I got this DVD a couple of months ago and I love it! I think this dvd has more yoga on it than any of my other yoga DVD's. Besides the three yoga routines,  there is also a section on how to breathe correctly and how to properly do the harder poses. Although I wouldn't recommend this DVD for a complete beginner. I love all three routines, but my favorite is the Morning one, it really energizes you! The daily one is the longest and I only do that one once per week, but it is also very good. The night one is slow and has helped me sleep a couple of times. I highly recommend this DVD, it is one of my favorite yoga DVD's.",1383436800,,625,3.9603174603174605
1891553,5,B00009W0VH,"I have had this DVD since 2003 and still use at least once a week, though mainly just the afternoon connection, or 60 minute session.

I absolutely love the sequencing  and flow of the yoga asanas featured. The hour long session I am most familiar with features a variety of postures. After stretching, standing postures include triangle, warrior, plow, tree and (for myself) the most challenging eagle pose etc. There is a sense of grace but challenge in this early part of the workout. Poses such as the plough and subsequent transitions into the downward dog are challenging when repeated as they are; therefore if you are looking to raise your heart rate a bit this DVD is suitable.

Postures featured on the floor such as lying inversions may require continued attempts by the beginner yogi/ini or an alternate posture for someone such as myself who has inner ear problems (those with head, lung, neck issues as well as those menstruating also take note) Ms. Behl suggests often to rock on your back with your knees to your chest---this is alright but does not provide much of a challenge. The pigeon series towards the end of the hour long session is particularly beautiful and I have found as someone who keeps in shape with a variety of workouts that the stretching that occurs here is really valuable as a warm up for other exercises.

The relaxation/meditation at the end of the program is decent but way to short. I often pause the DVD and continue with this portion until ready to finish the session alltogether.

The morning session or 'morning quickie' is invigorating as promising and those who are familiar with the yoga sun salutations will grasp this quickly, though as another reviewer noted, the variations featured in each sun salutation cycle are quite deep and as someone who is ""balance challenged"" I sometimes fall out of these asanas which is fine--- a challenge is great!

I don't do the 'evening bath' session too much but have found it rather relaxing.

The overall content and environment of this workout is one of the main reasons I keep using it. As the title promises both Ms. Behl's teaching style and the cosmopolitan feel of the yoga studio are fairly urban and sans the 'fluff' that tends to cloud other yoga workouts e.g beach/outdoor locations and/or an gratuitious spirituality.

For beginners and/or people not so familiar with breathing techniques there is a great tutorial section that I still refer back to and use even in other yoga workouts. The DVD menu makes skipping around sessions very easy.",1356998400,,2542,4.827586206896552
1891554,4,B00009W0VH,"This is a nice dvd for a home practice.  There are three choices of workouts.  The am workout has more sun salutes, would wake you up and is invigorating.  The evening practice is more slow and relaxing with stretching.  The middle workout is longer, about an hour with pigeon pose as the peak pose.  The music is upbeat - Bollywood-ish.  Hemalaya is nice to look at.  She is working out in an empty room to show how even in a small apartment you could do this whole workout.  As promised, this is very good for the urban dweller.

So why didn't I give it a full 5? My main concerns are: 1) She instructs you into a shoulder stand and then tells you to stretch out your neck in a manner that is sort of scary to me.  I was taught at more than one studio to keep the head and neck straight in a shoulder stand.  I was told that moving it side to side like that might strain a muscle.  Ok, maybe I was told wrong - just thought I should mention this to potential buyers.

2) The shoulder stand itself is something I don't think you should do if you have eye issues, neck issues or osteoporosis.  There's no modification given.  If you regularly practice shoulder stand this will not present a problem.  If you don't, or aren't sure if it's safe for you - learn how to do one from a live teacher before you try this trick at home.  There are many possible modifications a teacher can offer as a substitute.

Other than that, I think this is a well sequenced workout.  My body feels nice afterwards.",1329350400,,1495,4.23758865248227
1891555,4,B00009W0VH,"Fantastic video. I really enjoy this style of yoga and am so glad I ordered it. I have an option for a morning or evening 'quickie' or a longer session. I can choose 'cool music' with or without dialogue so its great for when you learn it so well you no longer want a voice over.
The price was really cheap and even though there was a note it may not work outside of the US it plays fine here in Australia. Its my favorite online purchase.",1321056000,,439,4.057471264367816
1891556,5,B00009W0VH,"I've done the various workouts in this video dozens of times, and I really enjoy them.  The pacing is great and the moves are challenging.  I also like the option of choosing a workout based on my mood and energy levels.",1303862400,,220,4.341463414634147
1891557,5,B00009W0VH,"I am just beginning to practice yoga and I wanted a workout DVD that would start out slow and lead up to more advanced moves since I already practice pilates. This DVD does just that and Hemalaya has become my favorite yoga instructor: her voice is soothing, she doesn't rush through any of the poses- she takes her time and explains exactly what to do and how to breathe- and she offers adjustments for less flexible beginners. The music is also great!

After every routine I find myself feeling calm and energized, walking gracefully with correct posture, and going about my day in a happy mood :) I definitely recommend this and any other of Hemalaya's yoga DVDs.

Just try it and you won't regret it!",1302393600,2,704,4.579365079365079
1891558,5,B00009W0VH,"This DVD is a great one if you are just beginning practicing yoga. It isn't really fast paced, so it's easy to keep up with... Plus there is a tutorial to show you how to do the poses and how to breathe during your session. The sessions are about 30-35 minutes, and you can really feel the workout while you're doing it! I have been practicing yoga for about 6 years now and this is my favorite yoga DVD that I've tried.",1290556800,2,420,4.134146341463414
1891559,4,B00009W0VH,She is my favorite yoga instructor and this video gives you a great workout and will tone your body.  I just don't like the music.,1275609600,,130,4.2
1891560,5,B00009W0VH,"I loved this dvd because it is a great mix of effort and relaxation.  Some yoga dvd's just stress the effort part.  They movie quickly and often after doing the dvd, I feel that my body has been jerked around instead of stretched and strengthen.  The dvd is slow paced which I like.  I would not recommend it for a beginner because there is not a lot of instruction, but for me I liked that there was not constant talking.  Also the three routines are great mix for what ever mood you are in.",1262304000,,492,4.191489361702128
1891561,5,B00009W0VH,"After 15 years of VHS/DVD yoga practice, I've seen it all. Most are either too easy, with lots of explanations, or too hard, leaping into headstands and fast vinyasas. This DVD strikes just the right balance for me of rigorous practice with contemplation. Hemalaya is a gifted teacher.
Worried because I paid so little for it, I was happily rewarded with two hours of good yoga. I love the morning and evening sequences, and the hour practice is good for opening hips.
I also like Hemalayaa's fluidity. She encourages wiggling a little while settling into the poses, which is a nice change from the typical static, aggressive instructors. However, I was taught in class to never move one's head in shoulderstand, so be careful here.
Be warned, the music duing the menu is a touch creepy. I like it, though.",1233187200,5,806,4.764285714285714
1891562,5,B00009W0VH,"This has 3 such a great yoga sessions! I had a few poses that I could not accomplish, but feel that after repitition I will be able to tackle them! Great video and highly recommend!",1232236800,,181,4.2
1891563,4,B00009W0VH,"It's always a plus when yoga videos offer options.  In this case, you can choose from 3 routines:

There is a 30-minute ""morning quickie"" which focuses on warming & energizing the body.  It consists mainly of sun salutations and breathing exercises, such as ""energized breathing"" and the quick and powerful exhales through the nose called Kapalabati.

The 25-minute ""evening bath"" involves mostly twisting and inverted poses.

The ""daily connection"" is a 60-minute routine that encompasses a wide variety of stretching, strengthening, balancing, and energizing poses.

Behl also includes an instructional and breathing segment for those who are new to yoga.

Overall, it's a great yoga video for those who prefer a well-rounded yoga practice.",1219708800,4,742,5.456140350877193
1891564,5,B00009W0VH,"I like that there are different options for the time of day or time period you are working with- early morning, evening, etc. A very good instructor, the cues are easy to follow and the postures are challenging but not too difficult.

1891565,5,B00009W0VH,This DVD is great for those who are starting to bring Yoga into their lives.  It has good instructions.  It has good breathing techniques for all to practice.  Stimulating.,1204070400,,172,4.862068965517241
1891566,5,B00009W0VH,"I am pretty new to yoga, so some of the poses in the PM section were a little too much for me to do before bedtime.  But, I really like the AM routine - I feel like I get a good mix of stretching, strengthening and relaxing in a short half hour.  I haven't done the hour long routine, yet, but I plan to work my way up to that.  I really like the fact that this DVD gives you options for day or night and half-hour or hour long routines.  Hemalaya's voice and the background music is very soothing and I like the simplicity of the scenery (in a living room).",1203379200,,558,3.955357142857143
1891567,5,B00009W0VH,"I really enjoy this DVD and use it often. I like the choice of poses and workout lengths it affords. Hemalaya flows, but moves slowly, and holds each pose long enough that you can sink into it, something I really like to do.
I am quite flexible and would classify myself as an advanced beginner. I find that this disc is pretty much at the exact pitch I'm looking for. If you're a beginning beginner, it might not suit so well. Behl doesn't stop to explain things - she demonstrates and moves on. She performs the workouts alone, suggests no modifications and uses no props. However, because the pace is so stately, I think it should be possible to follow along comfortably, once you have some basic grounding.
The 60 minute Daily Connection is a well-rounded workout which always leaves me feeling nicely stretched and ready for anything. I often do the two other workouts in one day, the enlivening Morning Quickie (30 mins) first thing and the Evening Bath at bedtime.
I'm puzzled by a previous reviewer's contention that there's no spirituality in this yoga. I find the opposite to be true. Hemalaya opens the sessions with chanting, and includes pranayama - kapalabhati and a kundalini energizing breath. Overall, I found the atmosphere quite traditional and Eastern - in no way is this Westernised or gym-style yoga.
I have to agree with another previous reviewer, however, in disliking the music. It particularly bothers me on the main practice. But it's easily enough remedied, since there's a voice-only instruction option. As others have observed also, the shavasana is extremely short. A CD player and some music of your own choice comes in handy, if you like practising and relaxing to music.
European readers might be interested to know that although Amazon have categorised this as a region 1 DVD, it plays perfectly in my DVD player which isn't  a multi-region model and hasn't been adjusted or hacked in any way. In fact it's just a little cheapie compact player, about two years old. Nowhere on the disc itself or its cover is Region 1 stated. I think this might be a default categorisation by Amazon of US yoga DVDs. I've bought many others here (Gaiam and Yoga Zone, to name a few) which were also supposedly Region 1 but happily they all played without a blip.",1200268800,4,2280,4.757575757575758
1891568,4,B00009W0VH,Like video.,1156636800,,11,5.0
1891569,1,B00009W0VH,"I have purchased this DVD because it had such rave reviews. I'd have to say that I'm extremely disappointed in this purchase.

I find the instruction is poor and un-clear. There is no mention of an inhale before chanting ohm, no proper warm-up is included before you start getting into some serious stretches. There are no alternate routines for those who are not flexible. The voice of the instructor sounds more like she is trying to seduce you, rather than to give instruction. Yoga instruction should allow you to close your eyes and follow the routine and this DVD does not allow that. All you are given is an attractive woman in tight clothes performing an advanced stretching routine. If that was the intention, than you've succeeded. Perhaps I will play this at my next party with no sound;) Are the spiritual benefits of yoga even considered? Personally, I say they are not, which goes against everything yoga stands for. If that is the intention, than why not do something that is for strictly physical benefits such as pilates or weight training?

Thanks for trying to westernize something, but I think you missed the point.

I would recommend any of the Sampoorna Yoga DVDs over this one (especially if your looking for something authentic). When practicing from those DVDs you actually feel that you are in the presence of great wisdom, strength, and above all spirituality.

Regards,

MH",1156032000,20,1401,4.869747899159663
1891570,4,B00009W0VH,"After reading several of the reviews I decided to add my two cents worth. First of all the instructor is attractive and very well under dressed which is nice. I don't over dress to practice either. The quality of the video is very good.  There is a section about breathing which is about 5 minutes, main flow is 60 minutes, AM wake up is 36 minutes and the PM is 25 minutes with an additional instruction section which is about 5 minutes. The main practice has a nice slow pace with stretching between poses that helps the next pose to be fresh with no residue from the last pose. There is not enough instruction for a true beginner so this is for someone who is familiar with yoga. A few of her instructions do not coincide with her movements and when she calls for a plow and in fact she is doing a lunge confused me until I looked at the screen to see what she was doing. She also gets her left and right mixed up a few times. All in all I like this routine after I became familiar with the instructor. I learned a couple of new ways to improve my approach to the exercises. I like the instructor and her approach but this isn't the best video I've used.",1144368000,9,1157,4.188340807174888
1891571,5,B00009W0VH,"""Yoga for Urban living is designed to work around your schedule."" ~Hemalaya Behl

Hemalaya Behl's Yoga workouts allow you to create your very own yoga sanctuary. Her workouts embody the spirit of yoga. The blue walls speak of emotional stability and the wood floors and plants place an emphasis on natural materials.

While this workout is for mornings, I find it is perfect any time of the day when you have 40 minutes to enjoy a yoga escape.

I first did this workout when I was cooking Indian food and the entire experience was very authentic. I would also recommend the use of a rose oil to balance the mood and encourage beauty.

The exercises start with ""OM"" and as the word vibrates through your entire being, you will quickly abandon all worry and fear and sink into a state of serenity. There are a few gentle neck stretches and then you breathe away your tension and stress.

I think you can enjoy this workout even more if you place a blanket on the floor and then put your yoga mat on top of the blanket. Then, fold a towel in half and place it in the middle of your mat. This gives you more ""comfort"" during your workout. I find it is easy to move the towel, but I really enjoy the feeling of a soft towel under my feet instead of always feeling the cold ""plastic"" feel of the yoga mat.

Hemalaya Behl has a very casual approach. In fact, she is talking you through the entire workout ""from a distance."" She doesn't actually speak during the workout, but her calming voice drifts in and out of the soundtrack. There is an interesting ""rotation"" segment and a ""sun salutation series"" in which she is rather good about telling you what you will do next. If you are finely tuned and ready to move as soon as an instructor tells you what you will be doing next, relax into this calming series of exercises. There is no rush, no place to go, just breathe.

While doing the spine twists, I suddenly realized I was going much deeper into the poses than I had on other yoga workouts. I think you relax so much, that you can go deeper. You will recognize positions like triangle, plow, down dog and cobra. Hemalaya also includes a variety of authentic moves and creative poses. I find her instruction style to be very calming and she has a beautiful spirit.

The pace is just slow enough to relax and just fast enough so you don't get bored. If you are intermediate or advanced, you can always add in a few of your own poses here and there. ""Morning Quickie"" will encourage joint flexibility and will heat and energize the body. I can't wait to try ""Evening Bath.""

I really hope she is intending to make more yoga for urban living workouts. How about ""Laying out in the Sun,"" ""Waking up to Yoga in Bed,"" ""A Walk Next to the Ocean,"" ""Island Escape,"" ""Sunrise/Sunset,"" ""Sunny Mood - in which she could actually wear that orange outfit,"" ""Winter Escape,"" and ""Sailing into Peace."" I could think up more, but I think I've made my point. I really would like to see more Hemalaya Behl workouts. They are unique, authentic yoga escapes.

1891572,4,B00009W0VH,"This is my favorite yoga DVD. I frequently do the ""morning quicky"" segment as it's short enough to fit in before work and is a nice energizing yoga workout. I would recommend this DVD to someone who is still relatively new to yoga as the poses are doable by most people. The ""evening bath"" segment is very relaxing, with more difficult to attain stretches, giving me something to aspire to. Overall, this is a great DVD, and as I said before, my favorite.",1136851200,6,455,4.493975903614458
1891573,5,B00009W0VH,"The 60 minute main workout is very challenging, but I was really glad to see that her workouts include a shoulder stand and shoulder stretch. Although I couldn't do the advance versions of these poses, I know that I will be able to work up to them. This is not for beginners and a beginner could be someone that has done yoga for 2 years or less. Even the beginner dvd's are useful for the advanced yogini's so my recommendation is not too move to fast through your yoga journey. I really liked this DVD but it was a bit too advanced for me. I will use it as something to work up to. The morning quickie will be great a couple times a week and the pm workout twice a week. I do have other yoga workouts that I will use when I feel like I just can't do this one.",1127865600,11,761,4.0131578947368425
1891574,4,B00009W0VH,"So far I have owned this tape for a few months.  When I first

tried it I got pretty frustrated with and stopped.  Mainly

because I had only taken a couple yoga classes. So I was quite the beginner.  Since then I have been taking classes and purchased a few books as well as other DVDS. I enjoy the routine and the fact that you get 3 work outs on this DVD and that you can turn off the music.

After going back to this tape I find I enjoy the routines.

My main gripes are her misuse of the pose name for the plow when she is doing a lunge and her miscueing on the last set of

Sun Salutations in the AM portion.  She mixes up her left and right.  But once you know this and the routine you can get past this.  I do feel she should have had someone do this routine with her cueing and corrected this before letting it go out this way.  I would have done that if my name were on it.  But I am a stickler for details and accuracy.

Aside from that, the routines are very well rounded and I enjoy

doing the 60 minute routine when I can't get to my class.  I

alternate her morning routine with Baron Baptiste's Core DVD in the mornings. And I do the PM routine every know and then.

It was definately worth the price since I found it a Ross for

$9.

I'd recommend for someone that has taken classes and is flexible enough to deal with the few problems I noted with it.",1122249600,12,1369,3.963235294117647
1891575,5,B00009W0VH,"I was essentially a yoga beginner when I purchased this DVD, having only attended one or two classes. I do, however, consider myself to be relatively fit as I run on a regular basis. The workouts are not overly strenuous, yet they will definitely challenge someone new to the discipline. I was unable to hold some of the poses at first, but was never discouraged since Behl suggested and demonstrated varying levels of difficulty for the more complex positions. In addition to poses, Behl's workouts include breathing exercises and always end with a few minutes for relaxation or mediation.

I bought this DVD for a different and refreshing workout. Behl's Urban Living has certainly provided this, and I have been pleasantly surprised by the other benefits I have enjoyed from the workouts. I was never very interested in the meditative or breathing aspects of yoga, but I have found some of the breathing exercises extremely calming. Now, I will use them during the day for a moment of calm or relaxation.

Yoga for Urban Living is a perfect complement to any lifestyle, not just urban, as it provides 3 distinct workouts. The 30 AM workout is just as effective as a shorter normal workout and is focused around variations on the salute to the sun series. The hour long workout is more intense and features more complex postures, but could easily be worked up to using the shorter AM workout. Finally, the 25 minute PM workout is very calming, yet features very unusual but managable poses. Each workout is distinctly different from the others, so that very few poses are repeated.

In short, this is a great DVD for anyone looking for moderately challenging and balanced yoga workouts. The variety of routines will allow you to fit a workout in no matter what your lifestyle or schedule.",1121817600,13,1790,4.824104234527687
1891576,5,B00009W0VH,"I have been practicing home vinyasa yoga for 4 years and this hands down is my favorite DVD. Behl blends a challenging workout with great verbal cueing and soothing music.  Her 60-minute workout flys by, without the practioner even once wishing that the workout would ""hurry up and be over!""  Behl challenged me to do poses that I would have never tried before by pointing out that many ""look harder than they actually are.""  Once I tried them, under her great instructions, I realized that she was right!  If you are looking for a workout that you actually look forward to doing on a regular basis, this one is for you.  I just wish that Behl would create more workout DVD's!",1119657600,6,676,4.553719008264463
1891577,4,B00009W0VH,"This was certainly an enjoyable yoga DVD.  The main portion is a full 60-minutes, which seems adequate as Hemalaya hold the poses for quite a long time to really feel each stretch.  There are several more advanced poses, for which she does not necessarily show the modifications, but does explain them thoroughly enough that I was able to pick up on those poses for which I need them.  There are my more advanced poses then I'm used to on DVDs, but I must say I liked the challenge, and again was able to pickup on the modifications relatively easily.

The morning quickie of about 30-minutes was a bit more of a ""power yoga"" type.  It goes through several sun salutations fairly quickly and you will manage to work up a bit of a sweat depending on your fitness level.  These are again fairly easy to follow though it may take a few peeks at the TV screen to become used to it.

The evening bath of about 30-minutes was great as well.  Relaxing enough, though I personally do prefer ""Candlelight Yoga"", but this is definitely great for a change.

I have a few minor complaints about the video, which is more personal preference, but it would be nice to be forewarned.  First of all, this DVD is narrated by Hemalaya, she does not speak when showing you the poses, but does voiceover instead.  This always throws me for a loop because I do prefer when the instructor speaks live time as it feels a bit more personal.  As a result of that, as many other reviewers have mentioned, her moves are often ahead of her narration and that can sometimes throw you a bit behind the visual if you're not studying the screen.  Finally, Hemalaya does not ""mirror"" you as most DVD workouts will.  I tried to stick to the verbal queues here instead, but did find myself accidentally starting on the same side again with the quicker transitions.

Overall, a great yoga DVD, and I do recommend.  I'll definitely be looking at Hemalaya's other DVD when I'm ready to purchase a new one.",1116201600,14,1966,4.511299435028248

The productions values are pretty good and I appreciate that there are three completely different routines on this DVD, not shortened versions of the same routine ( *koff* Rachel Brice *koff*).

I loved the Evening Bath routine and will replace my nightly stretch sequence with it pronto. There are some cueing issues that others have pointed out but the pace of the DVD is such that it didn't trip me up too badly. Like others, we also like that she's clearly very fit but not a hardbody 0%bodyfat kinda gal and I liked seeing a young Indian woman doing yoga.

1891579,4,B00009W0VH,"I like the fact that this one DVD has three different practices, (two 25-minute and one 60 minute) each distinct in its mood and pace. The main (60 minute) routine is not kind of practice that will make you sweat (try Rodney Yee's power yoga series for that) but is thorough and slow, which is just as beneficial. Great for back and thigh stretches. It's a good addition to your library of yoga DVDs.

As other reviewers have mentioned, the audio track doesn't always synch up with the video track, and things get repeated (didn't we just do the left side?) which can be annoying, but isn't a big deal, especially if you are not a beginner. I wouldn't recommend this DVD for rank beginners, actually; there isn't much instruction or guidance on most of the postures.

Another plus of this DVD is Hemalaya herself; she is very beautiful, and has a ""real"" body, which I like. She's clearly very fit, but not stick thin. She's even got a little bit of a belly. Since the last thing I want while doing yoga is to feel lousy about my body, this is a nice plus.",1108944000,12,1055,4.4051282051282055
1891580,3,B00009W0VH,"i have a hard time with this dvd.  while i love the three different routines, and i love the rhythm, there are some things that drive me nuts.

i don't understand why she switches up her left and right so much!  as well, she doesn't offer modifications that would allow people to get into some of the postures more deeply.

finally, the deep relaxation at the end is incredibly short.  in the main session, it is less than a minute.  this dvd is getting marketed to people who practice regularily and i don't get why they didn't do a proper relaxation.  give me two minutes at least!

updated feb 12: ok, it's been three years, and i still use this dvd, so obviously, it's got a lot more of the good than the bad.  she does mix up her left and right, and the deep relaxation is too short, but oh well.  i'm cool with that now.  i just keep track of the left and right on my own, and i pause the dvd once i'm in savasana.  so if i could, i'd give it 4 1/2 stars now.

and, i will also say, that i love having this three different practices.  very very nice.  so perhaps, 4 3/4 stars really.",1107820800,30,1089,4.0947867298578196
1891581,3,B00009W0VH,"I'm relatively new to yoga, and to yoga DVDs, but I have to agree with ""Another Mom"" who also rated this three stars.  While I like the high production values and variability offered by this video, Behl's instruction is sometimes tracked incorrectly with her movements, and there are no modifications shown or voiced for the poses.  There is a nice ""instructional"" portion of the video which demonstrates these poses separately, but it would've been nice to incorporate or at least discuss the modifications in the actual routines.

Nevertheless, this is a solid video, one that will be rotated through my home practice collection.",1106870400,7,631,5.106796116504855
1891582,5,B00009W0VH,"Without repeating what other reviewers have already written, let me just add that this is a fantastic DVD. I bought it because I saw it was voted best yoga DVD of the year. I am so pleased. Although I mainly use the 60 minute routine, it is great and shifts me to a wonderful place. Just the right pace, the right amount of meditation combined with movement. Try this one and you will be glad!",1106179200,3,393,4.253333333333333
1891583,3,B00009W0VH,"This is an OK yoga video, but I'm bewildered by the glowing reviews. First, the music is unbelievably annoying. It's repetitive, synthesized, license-free music bin material. Second, the terminology misuse is a problem. I read another review that complained about the use of ""plow"" for ""lunge"" pose, and thought it was something I could live with. No. The pose, and it's wrong name, are repeated so often it does become annoying. And my mind does jump to how I'm going to get into ""plow"" from ""down dog"" without breaking my neck before I remember she really means lunge. Third, the instructor is fine, but if she wasn't beautiful someone else would be on the DVD. She seems like a young yoga instructor who is much beloved in some smaller city, not like a real expert. Fourth, I didn't feel like I had done much when I was done with the series. Finally, I really like the actual names for the poses and all. ""Morning Quickie"" for a series of sun salutations is cloyingly cute to me. If it's 30 minutes of sun salutations, just say so.

This video may pop into my rotation every few months, but I don't feel like I'm going to learn anything new from it, or grow my practice through it. For that matter, I'm not sure I'm ever going to decide the benefits of the workout outweigh the annoyance of the music.",1106006400,24,1304,4.5021097046413505
1891584,4,B00009W0VH,"The DVD is aesthetically pleasing and well organized...I like the different workout options.

Lots of downward dog, spinal twists, other traditional poses and great breathing exercises.  If you are looking for super challenging poses, you may not want this dvd.  However, I find that the challenge is pushing yourself to go deeper within the poses. Her voice is soothing, music is relaxing and after finishing the morning quickie or evening bath, you feel ready to start the day or wind down.  For the advanced yogi, this could be a very relaxing option.  For the beginner, you won't be disappointed--just make sure to watch it every now and then to make sure you're ""keeping the integrity"" of the poses.  Accessible, challenging and the poses are held long enough to have great affect.  I also appreciate the dvd features and recommendations; ie, make sure the room is not cold, etc.  Overall, I highly recommend it.",1099612800,10,992,4.726744186046512

However, if you're mid to advanced in your yoga practice, you may be disappointed. I didn't find any of the sequences particularly challenging and continue to be perplexed by the mis-use of very basic posture/asana names--plow for lunge, triangle for side-angle.

There is a 30 minute vigorous morning workout, a 25 minute relaxing evening workout and a 1 hour total workout. I like that the instructor has a healthy, strong body and is not skin and bones. She talks you through the workout well and within a couple of viewings, You won't have to look up to see what she's doing. Great flow, great range of exercises. It may not be as hard a workout as going to a class but it's a very thorough working and I can feel the difference in my muscles.

1891590,4,B00009W0VH,"Hemalaya Behl's Yoga for Urban Living series provides three separate yoga practices which are designed to be used throughout the day. Some fairly challenging poses are included, and so the routines are probably best suited to intermediate-level yogis, although experienced beginners may be able to modify enough to follow along and more advanced practitioners are likely to enjoy the variety of the routines. The individual practices are as follows:

 1) Morning Bath--This 35-minute section was my favorite of the three. Hemalaya begins by leading you through some gentle stretches designed to wake up the body in the A.M. via increasing the blood flow to various parts of the body. An energizing breathing exercise is also included to enhance energy during the practice, which consists of a variety of sun salutation series. Each series becomes increasingly strenuous, gradually adding in some challenging poses such as revolved prayer twist. The practice ends with a nice relaxation and brief ""Om"" chanting.

 2) Daily Connection--This 56-minute routine is designed as a complete daily yoga practice. Hemalaya again incorporates chants and energized breathing into the warmup as a means to awaken both the body and the mind. The practice itself is a nice blend of sun salutations, standing postures, balance work, and floor poses. Many poses are more challenging and demand an intermediate level of expertise, including eagle pose, pigeon, and some lying inversions. Unfortunately, the relaxation segment at the end of the practice is extremely brief, so most people will want to extend the routine a bit to allow for a longer period in savasana.

 3) Evening Bath--This was my least favorite of the three sections, mainly because I had little previous experience with some of the more advanced postures included (eg, shoulderstand, plow, deaf man's pose). The 25-minute routine is designed to be a relaxing, end-of-day practice, and as a result, Hemalaya moves much more slowly than in the first two practices. For those who want to move more deeply into challenging relaxation postures, this program might be ideal.

 Overall, I enjoyed this series and found Hemalaya's instruction to be both skilled and unique. Despite her Eastern training, she comes across as very down-to-earth, and she practices in a soothing loft-type living room setting with unobtrusive tribal-type music in the background. However, I should also note that she does not consistently provide mirrored cueing, and at times her voiceover is a bit out-of-sync with her movements on screen.

 This DVD set would be perfect for someone looking to expand their home yoga practice with several new routines of varying lengths, all of which can be performed at any time of day.",1090886400,37,2748,5.2534246575342465
1891591,4,B00009W0VH,"I have found this dvd to be most similar to the yoga classes I take.  This dvd integrates the methods of ashtanga, kundalini, and vinyasa.  The empahsis placed on the warm up is welcome compared to some other yoga dvds. Hemalaya Behl is professional and soothing, but not too foo-foo.  The 3 segments provide flexibility and when I don't feel like a vinyasa flow I can still get my yoga for the day in with the night time session.  The one problem is that the cueing could be better.  At times she is trying to provide verbal cues so that she ""mirrors"" the viewer, but the cues often don't match your movements.  I just go from one side to the other and ignore which side she says to start with.  But if you are new and need precise cueing this might be a dvd to buy after a few months of class work.",1088294400,6,800,4.189542483660131
1891592,4,B00009W0VH,"I have so many yoga instruction related items (books, vhs, dvds, cd-roms, etc.)and by far this is the best one.  It is the most like a real level 1-2 yoga class.  Plus, you don't have to deal with any props (props are fine in a yoga studio but at home it's too much to fool with).  Unlike other yoga vhs/dvds, where it is difficult to connect movement with breath because of poor verbal cueing (i.e. Yoga Journal tapes) or the instructors' annoying habits (overly perky Yoga for Dummies lady), these three routines are great for daily practices and I like Hemalaya's straightforward style.  Although the routines are basic, they include core yoga poses that even experienced yoga practitioners continually seek to refine.  I recommend this dvd for anyone who has attended some yoga classes and is looking for a way to develop a daily yoga practice at home.",1087776000,6,856,4.756756756756757
1891593,5,B00009W0VH,"This DVD balances on a line between yoga novices and yoga experts.  I think that someone new to yoga could probably do fine with this DVD.  The instructor provides plenty of cues as to what you should be doing.  There are several more advanced moves that may be too challenging for beginners, even in modified variations.  However, since these more advanced moves take up a limited amount of time, the easy answer is just to skip the more difficult poses.  Doing so wouldn't really impact the overall workout.
I think that more advanced yoga practitioners could also enjoy this DVD.  Although there aren't many advanced poses, this DVD could provide a good routine daily practice.  I personally would place my skill level at intermediate and felt that, for the most part, this DVD was just right for me.  I've gone through both the morning and evening routines multiple times since purchasing the DVD and really have enjoyed my workout.
There isn't a lot of ""urban"" about this DVD other than the chic loft it was taped in.  I guess the name may be a general guideline; you can find a peaceful place for yoga even in a small space in the city.
The instructor has a very smooth and mellow voice - wonderful to start or end your day listening to this.  She also does a good job of demonstrating the poses and the overall pace is neither too fast nor too slow.  The morning routine is perfect for gaining energy for the day, while the evening routine is a great way to wind down and relax.  I've seen several other yoga videos and this is the only one that I've done more than 1-2 times.
Highly recommended.",1083715200,17,1603,4.527777777777778
1891594,5,B00009W0VH,"This yoga DVD is great, It has 3 routines and a breathing segment in which she expleins few methods of yoga breathing.

The morning quicky is mainly sun salutations and some standing poses. There's also an evening bath routine which I haven't tried yet. You can also choose your audio:  music with insructions, or  each of them seperately. The music is excellent.",1079136000,11,587,4.745098039215686

Granted, it is my first yoga video but I have been doing yoga for over 2 years and I LOVE it.  Her voice is soothing, which apparently is important (while researching, I kept reading about how anoying other instructors voices were).  As someone with a medium-good range of knowledge of basic yoga, I found that I enjoyed it and felt it was simple to follow.  I also think that someone who has very little knowledge would find it great as well.  I didn't want a basic video but didn't want to be overwhelmed by dificult poses and I think I found that happy medium!",1079049600,7,714,4.338345864661654
1891597,5,B00009W0VH,"I really enjoyed this DVD.  This is the first DVD I have purchased from Behl, and let me say that she certainly knows her craft.  This DVD offers a workout for every point in the day, a morning quickie (30 minutes), a full workout 60 minutes, a evening workout (25 minutes), breathing exercises, etc.  She gives you an opportuntity to experience almost every aspect of yoga (meditation, breath work, postures, etc.).  I think that this is one of the most complete yoga dvds on the market today.  A person can really get an at home practice going with this dvd.  The only thing I would tell someone wanting to purchase this dvd is that this not a Power Yoga type of dvd, where you will sweat the whole workout.  Although some of the poses are challenging and all of them are held for a fair amount of time, these workouts are not designed to make a person sweat to the degree that say an Ashtanga workout, a vinyasa flow, or Bikram workout are intended to.  After completing one or more of these workouts you will feel stretched, relaxed, and calm, but do not expect a heavy sweat (ala Rodney Yee's Power Yoga, Berly Birch's Power Yoga, or Richard Freeman's Primary Series dvds).  I recommend this dvd for a person with at least a few months experience with yoga, especially before attempting the 60 minutes segment if you are not used to an hour or so of yoga.  However, the new yoga enthusiast can still get something out of the morning quickie workout and the evening bath workout, and work their way up to the 60 minute workout.  Again, this is a great dvd, and is a great buy for the person who is looking for a yoga workout that gives a person more than just a good physical workout.",1077494400,158,1688,4.43042071197411
1891598,5,B00009W0VH,"""Yoga for Urban living is designed to work around your schedule."" ~Hemalaya Behl

Hemalaya Behl has been studying yoga since an early age and her practice is steeped in authenticity. She has studied the teachings of Hatha, Vinyasa, Ayurvedic and Tantra.

Hemalaya Behl's Yoga workouts allow you to create your very own yoga sanctuary. Her workouts embody the spirit of yoga. She has a very casual approach. In fact, she is talking you through the entire workout ""from a distance."" She doesn't actually speak while doing the exercises, but her calming voice/instruction drifts in and out of the soundtrack.

If you are finely tuned and ready to move as soon as an instructor tells you what you will be doing next, relax into this calming series of exercises. There is no rush, no place to go, just breathe. I find her instruction style to be very calming and she has a beautiful spirit.

There are three workouts:

Morning Quickie - The blue walls speak of emotional stability and the wood floors and plants place an emphasis on natural materials. Perfect for any time of the day when you have 40 minutes to enjoy a this yoga escape. There are a few gentle neck stretches and then you start to breathe away your tension and stress. There is an interesting ""rotation"" segment and a ""sun salutation series"" in which she is rather good about telling you what you will do next. While doing the spine twists, I suddenly realized I was going much deeper into the poses than I had on other yoga workouts. You will recognize positions like triangle, plow, down dog and cobra. Hemalaya also includes a variety of authentic moves and creative poses.

Daily Connection - The workout is set in a room where purple splashes across the walls in paint and artwork presents a peaceful still dimension. In 60 minutes, Hemalaya can bring you from the highest mountain of stress to the most tranquil valley of relaxation. Her pleasant voice leads you into a meditation of the body. The poses follow a logical progression and have a depth. It reminds me of how one drop of water meets the next and eventually there is a peaceful stream. This is the best way to describe what I cannot otherwise put into words. If you complete all the poses to the fullest extent, this could be considered an advanced workout. I could not fully complete the ""eagle"" or ""camel"" although I can say that when I was in my 20s, these were much easier for me to accomplish. While doing this workout, I did finally succeed in maintaining the most amazing Tree Pose I've ever done. It is definitely easier to do tree pose while wearing the shortest shorts. Having fabric in the way does not allow your foot to remain planted on your other leg. You just have to do this pose to see why I am saying this. Anyway, I was quite elated that I could finally master this pose. There are many poses in this workout I won't be mastering for at least another year!

Evening Bath - When they say: Evening Bath - they mean it. You know how you feel when you have a nice warm bath before bed? Well, this yoga workout will have the exact same effect. I'm not sure if it is just the poses or the music that helps you relax into a deep level of peace. The truth is, I feel blissfully asleep while in the relaxation pose and now I know that I should probably climb into bed at that stage. This ""evening bath"" workout is definitely for the time right before bed. The exercises start with ""OM"" and as the word vibrates through your entire being, you will quickly abandon all worry and fear and sink into a state of serenity. There are a few gentle twists and then you start to breathe away your tension and stress. You will recognize most of the yoga poses. Spine stretch, leg stretches while on your back, spinal lift, relaxing rolls from side to side, youth postures (fountain of youth - I had no idea my body could do this pose), resting pose (definite challenge pose you can work into over time), chest-opening poses and full-body stretch. The pace is just slow enough to relax and just fast enough so you don't get bored.

Yoga can be a place of escape from everyday stress. The tension of the day melts away into your yoga mat and drips invisibly through the floor as a deep sense of peace pervades your entire being. Yoga reminds you to breathe, to nurture the soul that you are, to let your body release the stress for you as you stretch away worry, fear, sorrow and anger. After completing this yoga workout, all you will feel is an incredible sense of peace and bliss. The postures all flow beautifully and each yoga workout has a different emphasis.

Special DVD Features:

Breathing Techniques Section
Instructional Segment
Custom Audio Options
Interactive Full Motion Menus

P.S. IDEA: I think you can enjoy this workout even more if you place a blanket or down comforter on the floor and then put your yoga mat on top of the blanket/comforter. Having another comforter for the relaxation stage adds an entire new dimension of luxurious comfort. Then, fold a towel in half and place it in the middle of your mat. This gives you more ""comfort"" during your workout. I find it is easy to move the towel, but I really enjoy the feeling of a soft towel under my feet instead of always feeling the cold ""plastic"" feel of the yoga mat. Doing all this might seem like too much extra effort, but when you do the Urban Living workouts, you are really creating a mood and a place for your soul to escape and your body to relax.

1891599,5,B00009W0VH,"I have over 40 exercise and yoga DVDs in my collection and many of them by Sara Ivanhoe (her's are wonderful too). But this one by Hemalaya is the best in my collection!!! A wide variety of choices, my favorite being the 1 hour yoga session. I'm just getting into Kundalini and it's nice to see breath of fire used in the practice. I use the DVD again and again and love it. She holds the poses for a nice amount of time with relaxation betweeen. Thanks Hemalaya! I'm waiting for a follow-up to this one. Well worth the money!!!
It is broken into 3 different sessions. The AM and PM sessions are 30 min. The AM is energizing and PM is relaxing. Both include a wide variety of yoga poses. She explains well, holds the poses for a long time, and allows time between to listen to the echos of the pose. My favorite is the full 1 hour session. Also included on the CD are explainations of breathing techniques and details on form of the poses.
