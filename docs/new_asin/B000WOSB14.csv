Police officers and FBI agents work to cripple these national and transnational syndicates with every capability and tool they have: undercover operations; confidential sources; surveillance; intelligence analysis and sharing; forensic accounting; multi-agency investigations, and more. The documentary BUSTING THE MOB, which appeared initially on the History Channel, features interviews with many Federal Agents who made it their job to observe and gather information on many of the different organized crime families in the United States. The program also features surveillance footage and audio from wiretaps taken by these agents.

This documentary features the very interesting case called ""The Pizza Connection"". The story goes back two decades, when the Mafia held considerable sway on both sides of the Atlantic. Louis Freeh, a federal prosecutor in New York City who would later become director of the FBI, was cracking down on the Mafia. The FBI, the NYPD, and federal prosecutors teamed with Falcone and Italian authorities to bust an international heroin-smuggling ring that laundered drug money through pizza parlors. The 1985 trial, which lasted more than a year, cemented Freeh and Falcone's relationship. Other cases featured in this documentary are the surveillance of Carlo Gambino and his family, and how the authorities were able to bring down the last of the ""old school"" Mafia bosses, John Gotti. Also learn more about the history of wiretapping and other techniques used by Law Enforcement agencies to catch criminals.

I highly recommend this DVD. This documentary is not only very interesting, but it's one that you'll want to watch over and over again. If, like me, you want to add to your collection just about any documentaries you can find about Organized Crime then go for it, this documentary is very interesting and full of fascinating information. If you don't buy a lot of DVDs and want to learn more about the History of the Mafia/Organized Crime then I recommend two series: CRIME INC ( 1984 ) and LORDS OF THE MAFIA ( hosted by Robert Stack ), without a doubt the two best documentary series ever made about Organized Crime. :)
