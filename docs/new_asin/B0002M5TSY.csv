8029020,1,B0002M5TSY,"The first film on this disc is Garden of the Dead- clocking in at a little over an hour, even though it sucks, you won't feel like you wasted too much time (uh, right). The premise, and I'm not giving anything away because you smell it coming a mile away, is: Formaldihyde + prison workers = zombies. I can't say I enjoyed this, save for the prison camp signs written in magic marker. The second film is titled Unspeakable- scenario: car accident causes father's remorse, causes wife to be a vegetable, causes husband to kill & causes wife to have uncontrollable bowel problems(and her physical therapist loves her for it, yuk!)- this movie sucked also. The last movie, I believe, is titled Buttcrack??? not too sure, because after enduring the first two films, I simply couldn't be bothered with the last one.",1126828800,3,810,4.711267605633803
8029021,4,B0002M5TSY,"""DVD Special Features

* A special introduction by Lloyd Kaufman ""

Oh yeah, a real ""special feature."" At the beginning of the DVD, before the menu comes up, you get  Kaufman being an idiot. I wasn't able to skip through it or anything. I just threw it on, did the laundry, walked the dog, learned the language of the written Egyptians, and took my girlfriend to lunch. Then I went back and the menu was there. Ok. Now it gets good.

Garden of the Dead-- This movie isn't too bad. Too bad it's boring, though. So boring. I just kinda sat there, wishing it was worse so I could shut it off. The ending was pretty flat too. The story is this: a bunch of prisoners have been getting high off formaldahyde fumes. Well, maybe it's something else because they attempt a breakout, all get killed, and then come back to kill the guards and the prisoners who didn't want to go with them. There's absolutley no gore. The ""zombies"" just run up to ppl with axes in their hands and slam into them with their shoulders. Bam. The person is dead. Or they have the view of them ""hacking"" the person up half-obstructed by a car or a fence. Blah. I suppose it's done better than most low-budget films. I mean, it's better to see that than horribly fake effects.

The movie's alright. Just boring, boring, boring.

Buttcrack-- Well, I was definitely not expecting anything good from this movie. It's about a guy and his roommate. The guy wants to propose, but hte roommate keeps ruining it. Then the roommate goes to take a bath, and has the radio on super loud. The guy goes, tries to shut it off, but is too flustered and he ends up dropping it in the bath, electorcuting the roommate. Then the roommates sister brings him back for revenge.

The acting is terrible. Simply terrible. O man. It's SO bad. I can't emphasize this enough. The only bright spot is Mojo Nixon as PREACHER MAN BOB.

But somehow, it's still funny. You'd have to see it to believe me.

Unspeakable-- Pure sickness. It's really good, though. The plot's complicated. I don't want to say anything because it might ruin things. It's a good movie, but I don't really want to watch it again for a long time. It's disturbing.

It's a good set if you've got an open mind. And if you're looking to buy anything put out by Troma, I'm sure you do.",1099526400,9,2291,4.42042755344418
