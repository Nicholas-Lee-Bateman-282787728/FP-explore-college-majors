8170511,4,B000MPPF5I,"I have several of these in the Little Golden Book Video Series and have rated them all, so some of my reviews may sound similar, but I will review each one separately based on the stories contained within.  I personally LOVE LOVE LOVE these videos and my kids loved them when they were young, but they are in their 20s now, so I guess these are outdated.  My grandkids don't really enjoy them, but they have access to all the cable channels, so of course they don't like these story book videos.  Each one of these in the series has 3 stories.  The animation is just pictures that they sort of tilt around to make them look like they're moving, so kind of cheesy I guess.  I just liked the stories, and they went well with all my kids Little Golden Books.  A lost art these days, reading to kids and nice, innocent videos that don't have cartoon characters with super powers, kids with attitudes towards their parents, magical and mystical junk, and too much over-stimulation.  No wonder so many kids have ADD.  But I digress.  I'm 55, my kids are grown, and I love these.  Kids might not like them, so that's the only reason I gave it four stars.  I still love them.  The stories themselves are adorable, classic stories that have stood the test of time.  Who doesn't like The Pokey Little Puppy, Peter Rabbit, The Little Red Hen, and Scuffy the Tugboat?  My favorite stories in the Little Golden Video Series are these are Polly's Pet (not on this particular video), and What Was That? (also not on this video). My favorite story on this particular one is Pokey Puppy, but the Sailor Dog is adorable too.

We had planned to convert to DVD, but I guess we won't now.",1439942400,,1667,4.4375
