8558182,5,B00AW5IKGY,"I purchased A Gentleman's Dignity and I received a package on the day it was supposed to come, but when I opened it, I had received the wrong drama. I had planned on returning the whole thing, but the seller kindly rush shipped me the correct show and a self addressed envelope for me to send back the wrong show. It was very kind of them and I would definitely work with them in the future.

The quality of the show is very good and so far the subtitles seem fine. So I say go for it, but make sure you get the non Malaysian version, because they say the subtitles aren't typically as good.",1435536000,,591,4.139130434782609
