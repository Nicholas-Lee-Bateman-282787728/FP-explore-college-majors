584418,3,630311539X,"The technical part of this review refers to the Brentwood Home Video or BCI Eclipse version.
Mutiny on the Argentine plains. Fort commander Robert Taylor tries to stop the hemorrhaging of his squad to a deserter gone bad and mad! How to keep the boys at home in the fort? Bring in the women. I'm sure some women's groups would have a field day with this picture. It's a unique story where love and lust turn into survival in a harsh environment. Director Hugo Fregonese has delivered a Spanish film that is interesting and moves at quite a good pace.
The print used is fairly decent for this budget release. A film that was definitely widescreen shot in 70mm, it suffers in places in this pan-and-scan version. Still worth a look. Brentwood/BCI put in 6 chapter stops, a trivia game and a Casper the Friendly Ghost cartoon. So you can't go wrong. This movie is also in a 10 pack of westerns at about triple the price for this one film from Brentwood Home Video called ""The Wild West"" and is available from Amazon.com.",1079568000,11,1017,4.532608695652174
584419,2,630311539X,"One of Robert Taylor's last pictures, SAVAGE PAMPAS was directed by Hugo Fregonese, who made such westerns as APACHE DRUMS, BLOWING WILD and, in Europe, one of the WINNETOU westerns in 1965, which alos dealt with Apaches on the war path. Here, he sets his action in ARgentina in the 1870's and casts Taylor as a cavalry officer and Ty Hardin as a revolutionnary, facing Indians and rebels.
Visually, the film is rather curious. The soldiers' uniforms are a mix of mexican uniforms, french legion uniforms and gauchos' large chaps. The Indians look like Apaches and the white rebels siding with them, more or less, look like mexican bandits.
The story revolves around an officer concerned with the lack of women in his fort which causes his men to defect to the Indians, who offer them women, and a revolutionnary who joins a group of white women bein brought to the fort by Taylor and his men to prevent the troopers from defecting. On the way, Taylor and Hardin get to know and respect each other, while Indians and rebels prepare to attack them. Cornered in a deserted village, soldiers are under heavy attack by the Indians, but Taylor manages, first, to get help, and second, to perform a deed (which I don't want to explain here) which will with any luck save the troopers...
The film was shot in 70 mm, but sadly is presented here in its Pan & Scan version. Master and MPEG2 compression are not particularly good, but this DVD remains quite watcheable, especially for western and/or Robert Taylor fans.
Besides, its price is quite reasonable, so don't hesitate to take a ride in those SAVAGE PAMPAS.",1048464000,15,1605,4.715302491103203

7839788,3,630311539X,"The Pampas in Savage Pampas is an area in Argentina where there is a government fort and a rebel leader outside the fort. The rebel leader is able to seduce soldiers to his side by promising them women. There are no women in the fort and the army refuses to allow them to come. The men are starved for sex. The rebel leader is supported by a huge army of Indians who are willing to fight with him because their leader is considered a god and the god tells them to fight for the rebel leader.
Taylor who is a captain in the fort persuades the general to allow him to bring prostitutes into the fort. The rebel leader hears about his plan and decides to take the women from him. Besides the problem with the rebel leader, Taylor has difficulty transporting a little over a half dozen prostitutes over a several day period with sex starved soldiers ordered not to come close to them, and with some of the men and some of the prostitutes forming liaisons.",1480896000,,951,4.348314606741573
7839789,5,630311539X,"""Savage Pampas"" (1967) was directed by Argentine film director of the old school of Hollywood, Hugo Fregonese with great music (Waldo de los Rios), editing (Juan Serra), and writing (Hugo Fregonese and John Melson).  The production is a demi-western in that it takes place on the Argentine pampas and the photography of the Jaime Pradas/Samuel Bronston mini-epic is photographed by Marcel Berengeur in Eastmancolor and Superpanorama.  The film is notable for the performance of Robert Taylor and also features Ron Randell, Marc Lawrence, Ty Hardin and Rosenda Montera.  However, this edition by Jubal Classic Video lacks the definition the picture deserves.  This Italian Reg. 2 offering is inexpensive but the image is rather blurry and would suggest a better edition, but it is a very good film.  Although it is presented as widescreen in English and Italian with or without Italian subtitles, it is a shame they took no care to restore the film, which is technically quite accomplished for what could be classed a ""spaghetti western.""  The Indians are treated with much respect as care is taken to make the characters matter.",1480377600,,1128,5.136612021857924
7839790,4,630311539X,"So far as I know, this is the only English language film about Argentina's frontier wars and, for the most part, it's a good one.  At the same time in  history - the late-19th century - that the forces of the United States were subduing the Plains Indians, the Argentine Army was fighting with the natives of the 'Pampas' (grasslands).  Robert Taylor plays the jaded commander of an isolated frontier fort where his men are deserting to join the outlaw 'Gauchos' (cowboys) who are allied to the Indians.  His commanding officer reluctantly agrees to Taylor's solution - to provide his men with 'wives' ('fallen women' exiled to the frontier).  While this sounds like a plot gimmick, this was an actual solution for an actual problem.  Among the best aspects of this film is its accurate depiction of the world of the late-19th century Pampas.  This is not surprising, given that it's a remake by the Argentine director, Hugo Fregonese, of his own 1946 version.  Fregonese worked on films in both his home country and Hollywood - appropriately, one of his specialties was westerns.  Savage Pampas, filmed on location in Argentina and Spain in 1966, contains a blend of elements from both traditional Hollywood westerns and 'Spaghetti Westerns'.  Perhaps the only downside of this film is the poor quality of the dubbing, but this is compensated by beautiful cinematography and a strong soundtrack.",1369785600,2,1396,4.978448275862069

7839792,1,630311539X,"Great movie, but don't waste your money on this version. I bought the new VHS tape and the quality is so bad that it is hardly watchable. The DVD is from the same company, so I am sure they are both ripoffs. Shame. I think they recorded it in a movie theater using a hand held camcorder.",1288396800,,287,4.052631578947368
7839793,5,630311539X,"A very rare film, portraying the Argentine struggle against the Araucanian nation which dominated most of Argentina and Chile. A book has called the Araucanians the Apaches of South America, but with all due respect, the Araucanians were a much greater barrier than the Apaches.
  For information purposes, the Argentine Araucanians largely belonged to the Ranquel group. They did look similiar to Apaches. Some still survive in Patagonia. Technically, the film has some weaknesses, but I'm not a film critic. I believe there is much material for films in the history of the native struggle against white settlement in either Argentina or Chile.",1222646400,2,645,5.252427184466019
7839794,4,630311539X,"Odd but interesting remake of an older Argentine movie based on the novel ""Pampa Barbera.""

Director Hugo Fregonese does a fine professional job with the material.  He manages to include many nice touches that give this an authentic Argentine feeling, and keep it from becoming just another mid-60's western.  It's too bad that the sound track on this print doesn't do justice to the beautiful score by Waldo de los Ros.

The story is set during Argentina's desert war of the late 19th century, as the Argentine army battles Indians on the pampas.  (It was filmed on locations in La Pampa, Argentina and in Spain.)

The army suffers heavy losses as the Indians and renegades have devised a plan to lure lonely conscript soldiers into desertion by promising to give them women captives.

Captain Martn (Robert Taylor) plans to counter their scheme and keep his troops by arranging to import women from Buenos Aires.  Battles ensue as the Indians try to capture the women on their way to the fort.

The print has a lot of dust and artifacts, and suffers from some very choppy editing.  I'm only deducting one star for those technical flaws because I think the film is interesting enough to overcome that.

7839795,4,630311539X,"I saw this film in the mid 60's on TV and remembered it fondly.
It is a cowboys and Indians movie set in 1870's Argentina. This is one of Robert Taylor's final efforts and is a solid one.
Also on hand is Ron Randell as the deserter villain, and 50's western star Ty Hardin as an anarchist conscript. It was fun to contrast the American west with the Argentine frontier and see simiarities and differences. This by the way is a remake of the 1940's Argentine film Pampa Barbara. I would love to see the original if it still exists. Definitely worthwhile for western/action fans.",1081900800,7,577,4.504761904761905
