4509408,5,B004ZKKKXI,"These are some of my favorite B movies of all time - real guilty pleasures!  Nothing beats a low budget barbarian film to lift the spirits!  These films have never looked better.  However, my favorite of the 4 films, Deathstalker II, appears in a cut version here.  This Deathstalker II version has its pros and cons.

The Deathstalker II version in this set is the ""Director's approved cut of the film""  which is different in many ways from the previous DVD version which was released by New Concorde.  The ""director's cut"" visually looks much better than the previous release.  The image is widescreen and looks properly framed.  The image is brighter and the colors look great.  The previous DVD release often looked dark and murky.  The film now looks magnificent!

However, the ""director's cut"" has a shorter running time than the previous release.  Two scenes have been deleted entirely and there are numerous cuts to other scenes and dialogue.  The back of the new Shout Factory case gives the film a running time of 85 minutes - my DVD player has the film's running time as 77 minutes.  The previous New Concorde release box gave a running time of 85 minutes, but the film actually ran 88 minutes.  Accordingly, this new release is 11 minutes shorter than the previous release!

I did a side by side comparison with 2 TV's and the cuts can be listed as follows (the time marker given is that of the new Shout Factory release):

11:00 - some dialogue between Deathstalker and Reena is missing
12:45 - some dialogue between Deathstalker and Reena is missing
16:45 - some dialogue between Sultana and Jarek is missing
17:44 - an entire scene between Sultana and Evie is cut
18:00 - some dialogue between Deathstalker and Reena is missing
18:45 - At the meeting between Chin and Sultana in the tavern the stock footage from Deathstalker I has been removed
32:35 - Stock footage from Deathstalker I has been removed and the following scene between Edie and the dwarf has been shortened by a few seconds
48:00 - Some footage of the celebration after Deathstalker's defeat of Queen Kong has been deleted
49:00 - Some dialogue between Deathsalker and the Queen of the Amazons has been deleted
51:49 - Some dialogue between Sultana and Reena has been deleted
55:45 - Establishing shots outside of castle (stock footage) has been deleted
58:25 - an entire scene with Reena and the Amazon Queen getting a massage is deleted
59:00 - Some dialogue between Deathstalker and Sultana has been deleted
1:07:00 - Some stock footage of fighting (taken from Roger Corman's Amazons movie is deleted)
1:08:45 - Some stock footage of fighting (taken from Roger Corman's Amazons movie is deleted)
1:12:18 - Shots of cheering crowds and a triumphant Deathstalker and Reena with their arms raised looking at the crowds have been deleted

Due to the above cuts, the director's commentary track has also been edited down to match the footage.

The above cuts make the film seem tighter, faster paced and more serious.  However, some of the dialogue which was cut was funny and absurd (whether intentional or not) and was a big part of the film's charm.  I also miss the two scenes which were entirely deleted from the new release.  Of the two cuts, I prefer the previous version on the New Concorde DVD.

Regardless of the above, the film is still great and a lot of fun.

I highly recommend this dvd set to any fans of barbarian action films!",1315180800,197,3423,4.7318718381112985
4509409,4,B004ZKKKXI,"Yes, these Roger Corman movies are all a part of that 80's b-rated ""So Bad It's Good"" fantasy movie genre. The Shout Factory is the first company that's released these movies in widescreen and they all look great for when they were made and the budget they were given. I remember when David Carradine died I found out he was in a b-rated fantasy movie... of course since he died the movie was going for 60 bucks on Amazon, so I'm glad I waited. The movie he plays in ""The Warrior And The Sorceress"" is easily the worst of the bunch, even I had trouble finishing it. It's pretty neat watching these, seeing all of the naked women and how they were treated, I don't think any studio no matter how small would publish this. I know for a fact they're all too racy for an ""R"" rating these days. ANyway, great set, definitely worth the small price being asked. The only trouble I had was on disc 2 there's areas to click on to watch The Warrior And The Sorceress and Barbarian Queen. I thought something went wrong because clicking on the movies starts up trailers for Corman movies... I thought the movies weren't on there at all, but they are, you just have to wait for the trailers to play through. My buddy said since the graphics on the menu of disc 2 show a movie theater, maybe they put the trailers in there so it's kind of like you're in an actual theater... having to sit through the trailers before the main attraction starts.",1314144000,31,1431,4.3632958801498125
4509410,5,B004ZKKKXI,"This four pack is much better than you think.
""Deathstalker"" and ""The Warrior and The Sorceress"" have a large following.  These two films have good scripts, special effects and acting.  We are not talking Shakespeare or Star Wars.  We are talking low budget, second and third lead actors, journeyman writers, directors and cinematographers.
This is not going to require you to think.  In fact, thinking might spoil the movie.
""Deathstalker II"" and ""Barbarian Queen"" are spinoffs from Deathstalker.  Neither is as good as the original but they are fun.
The villains are evil.  The hero is heroic.  The ladies are beautiful and often without a lot of clothing.  Swords crash, spears fly, spells cast in all serious on screen.
It is not a bad way to waste a couple of hours and a lot of fun.  This set is a real bargain and well worth the price.",1314057600,6,842,4.673469387755102
4509411,4,B004ZKKKXI,"When it comes to schlocky, low budget ""Conan the Barbarian"" knock-offs none has a worse reputation than the ""Deathstalker"" tetralogy. Despite the entire series being completely inept and the lowest common denominator when it comes to filmmaking, it still has a small legion of cult fans... me included. These are just campy delights with unlikeable barbaric anti-heroes, buxom heroines that bare it all and shoddy effects. Basically the series is a B-movie fanatics dream come true.

Included in this quadruple feature, released though Shout Factory's wonderful 'Roger Corman Cult Classics' line, are the first two entries into the series. Both were previously released on DVD in Full Screen versions from the now defunct company New Concorde. These OOP releases were going for tons of money from secondary sellers and now we fans can get these films in this wonderful bargain set which contains both films in brand new anamorphic widescreen transfers! Thankfully the hilarious and insightful audio commentary for ""Deathstalker II: Duel of the Titans"" (seriously one of the most entertaining commentaries I have ever heard) from the previous DVD release is included. To top it off a brand new audio commentary is included for the first ""Deathstalker"" film!

About a year ago Shout Factory released a double feature of ""Barbarian Queen"" and ""The  Warrior and the Sorceress"" that was exclusively sold on their website, no doubt because they thought there wasn't a big enough fan base to warrant a wide release. As a bonus they throw this disc in with the first two ""Deathstalker"" films. Both are only anamorphic widescreen transfers and are far better than the previous out-of-print New Concorde releases.

This is a highly enjoyable collection of delightfully awful and campy sword & sorcery flicks but I had to deduct the release to a four star rating for one mistake. The mistake is that Shout Factory should have released two volumes of quadruple sword & sorcery features with the first containing all four ""Deathstalker"" films. Seriously why didn't they put all four ""Deathstalker"" films into one collection? Yes parts 3 & 4 are by far the worst but it would have been great to have all four in one collection (Part III has never even been given an official DVD release in America). The second volume should have contained ""Barbarian Queen I & II"", ""The Warrior and the Sorceress"" and ""Amazons"". This makes me worry that ""Deathstalker III & IV"", ""Barbarian Queen II"" and ""Amazons"" won't get another DVD release but I can keep my fingers crossed.... hopefully this set sells well to prove to Shout Factory that there are fans of these silly S&S films.

Butts & Big Breasts (aka T&A) ?  or
Battles, Blades & Babes ?
Take your pick.

I loved these films when I was a young & horny male teenager/adult, because it had plenty of the Three Bs in them.  Back then, I would have rated them higher (this assumes you are not annoyed by the cheap special effects that are in all these films).
Now that I am older and more mature, my tastes have matured as well (i.e. it takes more than a pretty face & body to please me).  Now, I would rate them lower.
Hence my compromise of rating these films with 3 Stars.

I still like the Deathstalker (1 & 2) and Barbarian Queen films.  At least they still have good/OK plots and stories.  Never did like the ""The Warrior & The Sorceress"" film, but I would only watch it for the Three Bs and not for its plot/story.",1452038400,7,846,4.084848484848485

4509471,5,B004ZKKKXI,"This movie set is a real joy. With big hair, bare-chested (and not just the men) barbarian tales of the 80s, the plots are simple but at least they generally make sense. The four collected here are better than bottom of the barrel Italian Fantasy and deserve to be called cult classics. The best movie of the bunch is probably Deathstalker 2 for pure Fantasy fun, which really could have gone by any other name since the amusing lead actor is not the same (and there seems to be a tongue-in-cheek nod to that fact during the movie in a comment from one of the characters). Barbarian Queen is also quite fun since the ladies get to turn the tables on brutal invading men but no question it is going to offend the easily offended with a few too many violent nude scenes. I had not watched most of these except the David Carradine one before, but found them all enjoyable in their own way. Don't count on all of the heroes surviving in these movies - no one is safe, and the tension in the battle scenes is fueled by this fact. A quick dagger in the stomach can end it all. ""Core"" characters - even likable ones - get killed off frequently, something that modern Fantasy movies could learn from. Where do these films fall short?  Must be in the rubber monsters and poor special effects, but these can be charmingly retro as well since movies today might turn to equally fake-looking CGI.",1446508800,3,1384,4.427450980392157

WIth Deathstalker, there is a tournament, but there are scenes that are utterly confusing and make no sense.  He know an old witch, but it's never clear if that's his mom, or what.  The Princess' dad asks him to rescue her, but he refuses then decides to after fighting with a guy wearing a girl's top.

The Barbarian Queen is just as confusing.  It's a story of revenge.  A village of barbarions are attacked before a big wedding.  The bride and a few others are spared so she plots to take revenge against a tyrant.  There is nudity and better fighting than Deathstalker, but it is a cheesy softcore movie.  Just be aware of that.

All the other movies are just like this.  These are softcore porn if nothing else.  The action is horrible and I'm not who they were made for.  If you want boobs or sex, there isn't enough.  If you want action, it's really bad.  If you want to drink some beers and watch bad movies and make fun of them, I guess these are for you.",1401840000,,1069,4.296482412060302

4509516,4,B004ZKKKXI,"Tbh this isn't my genre of choice, but I heard some good things about the Deathstalker films, so I decided to give the set a try, and I'm glad I did. Even though none of these films are masterpieces, they're really entertaining, and fans of this stuff will eat it up.

The set comes with 4 films.
The first two films on the set are the first two Deathstalker films, and they're easily the best two films on the set. The first Deathstalker is much more serious than the second film, but it isn't quite as good as it's tongue in cheek sequel either. Rick Hill was a bit stiff as the lead, and the film may've took itself a bit too serious, but it's still a good time. It's never boring, and one of my favorite parts was seeing Richard Brooker (Friday the 13th Part 3) without his Jason attire. Overrall it's action packed fun.
Deathstalker II was my absolute favorite film of the set though, and a complete blast from start to finish. The cast is clearly having the time of their lives, and it's equally as fun to watch for the viewers. John Terlesky and Monique Gabrielle are as charming as they are attractive, and the film is chock full of action and humor. Deathstalker II is a real winner.
Sadly Deathstalker 3 and 4 are not included in this set, but hopefully we'll get a good release for them sometime in the future.

The third and fourth films on the set aren't quite as strong or as memorable as the two Deathstalker films, but I thought they were a great addition to the set.
The Barbarian Queen starred Lana Clarkson, and it was entertaining from start to finish, and The Warrior and the Sorceress starred David Carradine and was easily my least favorite film of the set. Not terrible or anything, but just not nearly as enjoyable as the others.

All the films look pretty damn good, and it's great to see the Deathstalker films in widescreen.
Both Deathstalker films come with a commentary. The first with the producer, director, effects artist, and Richard Brooker. The second with director Jim Wynorski, and actors John Terlesky and Toni Naples. The commentary for the second film is a must listen.
The two films also come with their trailers.

Overall Shout put together quite the good set. I may've not been of fan of this genre before I bought this, but I may be now!

I enjoyed it far more than any of Arnold S's pictures which tire me out watching Arnold keep his muscles tensed for a complete movie!  The hero in the first Deathstalker pictures is much more believable and the women are super keeno!  The other three pictures of the Roger Corman's Classic Sword and Sorcery Collection are the worst I have ever suffered through.  In fact, Deathstalker II hit the trash can before I got half way through.  The other two were mindless crud and hit the trash before getting to the halfway point.  I will probably watch the original Deathstalker again to get the bad taste of the other three out of my mouth.  The Hero in Deathstalker II is a scrawny looking clown with a crooked smile, which he sports continuously throughout the feature.  He can't act or anything else.  I seldom resent throwing CD's in the trash, but for almost $19.00, this was a travesty.  I hate to say it, but I learned a hard lesson about buying collections.  I have the original Elliot Ness DVD's and they are really good.  But this  DVD Corman Collection IS REALLY LOUSY...UNLESS YOU'RE BORED OUT OF YOUR SKULL, DON'T BUY OR WATCH IT!",1375833600,,1251,4.606334841628959
4509520,3,B004ZKKKXI,"Make no mistake: these films never aspired to the artistic level of Conan the Barbarian.  Red Sonja, tops.  What they do aspire to is similar levels of undress, heroes and heroines sword-and-sorcerying their way across what must be a pretty Mediterranean climate.  Deathstalker may be the highest T&A density I've ever seen outside of actual porn, but there's more than just flesh to its weirdly engrossing cinematography.  Deathstalker II is a surreal parody of the original, rife with self-aware dialog and bargain-basement special effects.  Barbarian Queen is played straight, and the misogyny of the skin would probably be easier to tolerate if one was seriously drunk (which if you're watching these in one setting, you'd better be by this point).  The piece de resistance is David Carradine's sword-wielding remake of ""Yojimbo"", the closest thing to an 80's-live-action-fantasy film you might actually show your parents (modulo how the titular ""sorceress"" seemingly has costume budget for only a G-string).

Let's face it: nobody goes to Hooters for wings, and nobody buys a collection like this for high-concept filmmaking.  If you like live-action fantasy and/or Carradine for their own sakes, these are as good a guilty pleasure-style outing as any.",1375056000,6,1258,5.350253807106599

Rich Hill is all right, in both films.  Good commentary on the making of these three Deathstalker productions.  The other one with Carradine, The Warrior and the Sorceress, was terrible (the film that is).  He could never act, should have used Bruce Lee in his early Kung Fu tv show.  Beside that, a very good package and deal.

It's a glimpse into adolescent male desires and fantasies (moving a bit beyond Princess Leia) which many of us never outgrow. We get women who can dominate us and not look like a Nazi prison camp commandant (ala Seven Beauties).

The only one I have some misgivings with is The Warrior and the Sorceress because, frankly, I am utterly tired of David Carradine as Caine, Kain or whatever martial arts incarnate the industry want him to be.

4509533,4,B004ZKKKXI,"This review is entirely dedicated to the ""Barbarian Queen"" re-release in this set. First off a beautiful job in the overall quality of the print. However no attempt was made in restoring the picture as done with Deathstalker 1 and 2. Here you still have the white specs occasionally showing up here and there. But the print is the best I've seen for this title and well worth the purchase price for this set.
 I love SHOUT'S dedication to these old flicks and do appreciate what they have done so far.
 I too like so many others however would love to see the film in its entirety as we saw it so many years ago. With the unedited segments back in. A nice restoration would be imperative to this long lost cult classic as well. An appropriate legacy to leave to the ""Barbarian Queen"" herself with such a tragic ending to her promising life. Side note,..Spectre may you rot in hell.
 If you guys read these reviews, the people at SHOUT please take this into consideration.
 A newly restored single disc ""Barbarian Queen"" and if possible unedited.
Other titles I would love to see in the US market are ""Alienator"" and ""Interzone"" both starring another blonde amazon, Teagan Clive. But that might be asking too much. Hey I can only hope.",1329955200,7,1233,4.5656108597285066

From the opening credits to the hilarious bloopers at the end.  There were no missing/cut parts.  And that, like one of the first reviewers, above, mentioned; the picture is absolutely fabulous; great color, brightness, and it's widescreen!

On the other hand, this DOES make me wonder what the ""other"" version of Deathstalker II is like;  the one mentioned by that same reviewer; with scenes that do not exist in this DVD nor exist in my old vhs tape.

Also wanted to mention how nice the DVD pacakging is; much nicer and more detailed than the dvd/bluray packaging of all my other dvd/blurays (all 400 of them)

4509536,4,B004ZKKKXI,"Oh, I do miss the days when they came out with films like these! Those films from back in the decade of the '80's to mid '90's or so, back when the movie industry was still really innocent, before it was taken over by the moral majority, political and sexual correctness, and the world of CGI technology.

Back then we were occasionally brought movies like these four - fantasy, swashbuckling, heroic tales of derring-do with witches, wizards and sorceresses, both good and evil, a damsel in distress, and a lowly hero who saves the day. And of course, lots of nudity, plenty of clothes being torn off all over the place nudity. Others like these included the Road Warrior Trilogy, Krull, Beastmaster, and Scwarzenegger's 2 Conan the Barbarian Movies. All pure escapist movies made only for that purpose.

And even beyond these kind of films were those like Animal House, Stripes, Bachelor Party and others that were so wild they took escapist comedic fantasy beyond the bounds of normal to give our end-of-the-day, totally beaten spirits the lift they really needed to make our day worth living and get us ready to look forward to the next day.

The movies in this set are not Oscar winning material, for sure, but they are sure a lot of fun to watch. Especially for those of us who have been there before and want to relive the days. If you didn't like them back then, you won't like them now, so I don't recommend trying them after 25 years thinking that maybe after all this time they may have gotten better with age. They haven't.

I also don't know if I'd recommend them for teens or yuppies who have never seen a cult film from the 80's yet, without the computer grapics, or without the limitations placed upon it by the PC and MM police, unless it is they who go in knowing ahead of time what to expect once there. But, hey, if you read this review and still want to try it, go for it. You might like it.
