8595021,3,B00DNJ95BK,"This 46 minute DVD contains a concert performance recorded in 2002 in what appears to be a concert in Preston, Lancashire, England.  Two of the original band members -Chris Britton (Lead guitar), Pete Staples (Bass guitar)- are here along with new member Dave Maggs on Drums and Chris Allen on vocals. Since the vocals are the most identifying feature of their three hits  Wild Thing, of course, and Love Is All Around and With A Girl Like You, having a vocalist who can replicate the original is important and Allen just doesnt make it.

On the positive side, the photography is very good (its in color and standard aspect.

On the negative side  beside the fact that the band really only had three hits in the US  is that sound (especially the vocals) seem to come from the monitors or speakers, causing a noticeable echoing sound.
The opening and closing title credits have been removed so I cant tell you much more about the source.
The package cover shows black and white photos of the group from mid-1960s. (though the back does honestly state the performances are from 2002).

Its just okay and really will only appeal to the TRUE Troggs fan.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.
