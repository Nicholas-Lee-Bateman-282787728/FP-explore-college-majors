8216155,5,B000V1IJAQ,"Bill Nye makes science fun. This video talks about the need for conservation and biodiversity. They touch a lot on extinction and responsible, thoughtful living.

All the Bill Nye videos are funny and interesting, moving quickly from one aspect of the given topic to another, and repeating the most important parts over and over without getting annoying. Some of the sections are corney or dumb, but they are aware of this and laugh at themselves, which appeals to my kids.

All 4 of my children (13, 10, 6 and 3) adore the videos, and the older ones have picked up a great deal of science knowledge and understanding from the series. You can often rent them from the library, but we like them so much we have purchased them to watch over and over at home.",1261872000,2,756,4.551470588235294
