8160266,5,B000L6EB76,"After watching seriously intense martial arts movies, totally unexpected - this one was a lot of fun!!!!  Hard core action fans probably think it's silly, but I think the banter between Donnie Yen and Rosamund Kwan is funny and quite charming. Along with David Wu, they looked like they were having fun with their roles. Love the martial arts, but other than Wing Chun, this was one of the few movies that I've seen that adds another dimension other than waiting for the fight scenes.  I'm a cross between Lifetime and Spike - so this was perfect for me. Truthfully, one of my favorite Donnie Yen movies and probably a good movie for women who haven't seen many action movies.",1411430400,2,676,4.625
8160267,5,B000L6EB76,"from the opening shot of a plane landing at the old HK airport you get the feeling you're in for a treat! You won't be disappointed as Donnie Yen battles the opposition while handcuffed to the delectable Rosamund Kwan! (well, not for the entire movie!) story's irrelevant - just enjoy the bone jarring stunts including some truly hair raising fighting on moving buses - no CGI, guys! One word of warning - scenes of people eating display terrible table manners!",1332979200,2,461,4.775
8160268,3,B000L6EB76,"On paper, ""Tiger Cage 2"" sounds cooler than ice cream at the North Pole - I mean, Donnie Yen vs. Robin Shou is what dream matches are made of, right? Especially when they're being directed by Yuen Woo-Ping, right? Well, at least I thought so. I suppose I have myself to blame for the disappointment: with expectations set so high, it would have taken an extraordinary cinematic feat to match them, and ""Tiger Cage 2"" is no extraordinary cinematic feat. It's a by-the-books Hong Kong action-comedy, with the highlight of featuring two well-known stars and about fifteen minutes of good action. Yen enthusiasts will probably chalk it up as a slightly exotic find, but for the rest of us by-chance Hong Kong fans, we can watch the action scenes online and not worry about missing the rest of the movie.

The story: when the drug money of a mafia-affiliated lawyer (Robin Shou,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mortal-Kombat/dp/0790729997/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mortal Kombat</a>) is lost, he targets a nave fellow solicitor (Rosamund Kwan,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Once-Upon-a-Time-in-China-Part-2/dp/B00005AWRA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Once Upon a Time in China Part 2</a>) and a bystanding ex-policeman (Donnie Yen,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Iron-Monkey/dp/B00005V1Y2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Iron Monkey</a>) as the thieves. Together, they must fight back lest they have to remain on the run forever.

The synopsis sounds pretty tailored to action, but more time is given over to Rosamund Kwan getting hysterical than to fisticuffs. Though there are a few gem moments - including her running into a lamppost and a cart ride down a stairway - most of the film's humor is painfully corny, dated, and elicits only halfhearted laughs. The already-thin plot is stretched to the breaking point over the course of the movie, wherein about ten minutes worth of thought is used to fuel a whole 95-minute vehicle; it really starts to feel like Woo-Ping dedicated himself to coming up with placeholder and time-killing scenes after the first half-hour, especially when he calls upon Cynthia Khan (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/In-the-Line-of-Duty-4/dp/B0000V46DG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">In the Line of Duty 4</a>) to play an inspector whose work reveals absolutely nothing relevant to the main characters. The acting really isn't worth discussing, with the exception of needing to mention that, try as he might, Donnie Yen isn't about to outdo Chow Yun-Fat as the screwup cop archetype.

The action content is really the only reason to watch the movie and probably is the reason you'd buy it in the first place. While you do get to see Cynthia, Donnie, and David Wu throw a few kicks and go on a couple chases during the first two-thirds of the film, the standout fights don't happen until 57 minutes in, and as I already mentioned, it doesn't become the nonstop action opus it promises until the last fifteen. Robin Shou does get a pretty furious fight with David Wu (or David Wu's stunt double?), but his climatic battle with Donnie is flat out disappointing for its short one-sidedness and lackluster choreography. Luckily, this is redeemed by two absolute kick-butt fights Yen has with muscleman Michael Woods and real-life comrade John Salvitti (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Shootfighter-2/dp/6304109350/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Shootfighter 2</a>): Woods is incredibly agile for a man his size and mixes up the kickfest refreshingly with some powerful wrestling moves, while Salvitti officially becomes an underrated genius for his lengthy and ferocious swordfight with the hero. That last one is a definite 5-star encounter, but even the rest of the fights should be enough to tide over casual fans during the boring character interaction bits...but only just.

In addition, I noticed that the Mandarin dub of my version of the DVD (the red and white cover) is a bit unrefined: characters' voices echo even when they're outdoors in an open area, and in more than a few circumstances is the lip-synching not pulled off adequately. The disc itself is also prone to skipping and reading difficulty, unless you have a top-of-the-line DVD player. These aspects further helped disenchant me from the movie I had such high hopes for but has now tempted me to rate even lower than I plan to. Again, Donnie Yen fans will most likely want this one to complete their anthology, but for me, Hong Kong can definitely do better.",1268006400,,4645,5.698412698412699
8160269,4,B000L6EB76,"And what else does on want with a film like this. It has the usual ""humorous"" element stuck in with the voilence and melodrama that viewers of Hong Kong films of this era will be well familar with.
  The only real questions to my mind with these films is; is the action any good, and is there any originality in it? To both of these the answer is a resounding yes, with the sword fight providing the standout moment. Anyone who enjoyed Donnie Yen's more recent work, such as Flashpoint, should enjoy this.",1236556800,4,505,4.419354838709677
8160270,4,B000L6EB76,"this was awsome... happy that I bought it. good fight scenes also in English so we can understand and also English subtitle...If you like Donnie Yen's films, ya gonna like this one...",1232323200,3,183,4.75
8160271,5,B000L6EB76,"If your looking for awesome martial arts action look no further. I must say this is one of Donnie Yen's best.

  The story revolves around Alan(Donnie Yen), a retired cop who's as tough as they come. He's being sued by his wife for divorce. As soon as he's leaving he stumbles upon an attempted robbery of some dirty money. The lawyer who was hired by his wife(Rosamund Kwan) implicates him in the murder. She also becomes wrapped up in the case and they join forces with another lawyer(David Wu) to bring down the real culprit(Robin Shou). It's a pretty good story for an action movie.

  This movie really comes into it's own in the fighting sequences. Donnie Yen shows off some good moves against the common thugs, but his fights with the main villains are awe-inspiring. He gets into an epic sword fight with John Salvitti. Then he goes up against the muscular Michael Woods(3rd time on screen these 2 fight). Then it ends with a showdown with Robin Shou who shows some good skills in this movie. We also see David Wu fight Robin Shou.

  If you love good martial arts flicks that are more realism than fantasy pick this up. You will not be disappointed. Donnie Yen is in top form here and I'm surprised he hasn't done more work in the States. But I guess that's a good thing as most martial arts movies made in the States tend to be awful.",1207699200,11,1344,4.453061224489796
