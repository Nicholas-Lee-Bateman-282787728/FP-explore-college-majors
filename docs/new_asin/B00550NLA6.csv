4570980,5,B00550NLA6,"To begin with, I had zero piano experience before purchasing Scotts book and ""3-steps..."" DVD and in just 2 weeks i could play 4 songs including Elton John, Bob Dylan and the theme from ""Cheers"". Now, understand that these products are just tools you use to get started. It takes a real passion and desire to play to make them effective, but if you stick to the basics (learn the chords, learn the melody, put them together) you WILL start playing quickly.

I found that the DVD had more actual instruction, where the book seemed more motivational, but hey, what's wrong with motivation if it gets the job done.

Long story short, I would recommend Scotts program (book and DVD) to anybody starting out.

PS... my DVD had full pause, fwd & rwd capabilities with chapters and menus. if yours didn't, its either your player or you have a bootleg copy.",1357516800,11,849,4.6092715231788075
4570981,3,B00550NLA6,"I BOUGHT THIS FOR MY NEPHEW WHO INDICATED TO ME THAT HE WANTED TO LEARN TO PLAY A FEW SONGS ON THE PIANO BUT DIDN'T WANT TO TAKE YEARS OF LESSONS.  PLUS HE DIDN'T HAVE A PIANO, SO I SENT HIM THIS AND HE WAS VERY THANKFUL.  I MYSELF DO NOT KNOW IF IT WAS GOOD BUT THE TV SHOW LOOKED LIKE IT WOULD BE EASY FOR ANYONE TO LEARN WHO DIDN'T WANT TO BE A CONCERT PIANIST.",1388188800,,364,3.6538461538461537
4570982,1,B00550NLA6,This is a joke. He talks a lot and acts a little creepy for me. He tells you about how you can learn the piano but nver gets into detail at all,1386633600,,143,3.5
4570983,2,B00550NLA6,I was excited to try the DVD due to the promo of easy way to learn the piano. Unfortunately I was disappointed with the presentation. There was too much talking and walking and too little instruction. When he did actually teach it was very helpful.,1382572800,,248,4.533333333333333
4570984,5,B00550NLA6,"Bought this for my wife who was studying piano on the internet at some free web site. She is a complete novice and was doing well at first until the text and pages of learning got a little overwhelming and confusion and discouragement set in. You know what?  Some people can learn things easier and quicker when they are being talked to and are observing demonstrations before there eyes. Some people don't learn as easily from written text...but DO learn easier when being verbally instructed.  If this is you, then this is for you. Just play the DVD with a simple keyboard nearby to follow the instructor as he demonstrates, and you, my friend, are on your way to piano playing success. You will be pleased with his pleasant, friendly demeanor and his ""let's get down to brass tacks"" approach to learning this piano playing thing. Concert piano, Liberace style, getting a job at a piano bar...no, not with this course. Learning chords, some note reading, fingering techniques and how to have fun playing your favorite songs and hymns on a piano keyboard so that your friends will be impressed...YES! If you have tried other methods with frustrating results, it is worth a try. Once again, this is for people who want to have fun and entertain friends and family, not those dreaming of auditioning with your local Philharmonic.",1381536000,6,1328,4.794759825327511
4570985,2,B00550NLA6,"The DVD seems like a copy of the TV presentation on public tv.  Waste of money.  Because of this, I will not be buying other DVDs by this teacher.",1378339200,,146,4.0
4570986,2,B00550NLA6,"I think Scott Houston is a nice guy, BUT he talks to much and teaches very little on this dvd.  Everything on this dvd was just a re- hash of his earlier book. Nothing new to learn.  If you have his earlier stuff, you don't need this!",1377302400,,234,3.9574468085106385
4570987,1,B00550NLA6,"This is really beginner.  If you know anything about the piano, skip this and just practice like you mother told you.",1369612800,,117,4.571428571428571
4570988,3,B00550NLA6,"Amazon delivered the product on time and in great condition.
The product raises hopes, and Scott (aka piano-guy) delivers the easy piano-playing  message. However, somewhere the overall presentation has a feel of an infomercial. For the one song that Scott that covers in the presentation in the lead sheet style, the lead sheet is not given with the product DVD. The users are expected to visit the website to down the  lead sheet, which was a minor let down.

On the plus side, the piano guy really lays down the concept very well, which can be used by the audience, in future to learn any song they like.",1366502400,2,607,4.601851851851852
4570989,5,B00550NLA6,"I am retired, 71 years old and never played a note. I purchased
both Scott Houston's DVDs - Play Piano In A Flash and Play Piano
In A Flash 3.  If I can learn how to play the piano then so can you.
You will be pleasantly surprised as to what a little practice can
do and before long you will be playing your first tune.

Do you want to learn how to play piano like classic style music -
Both DVDs are not for you.

Do you want to learn how to play the piano and have fun
at the same time then continue to read below.

This review will be used for both DVDs.  Both DVDs are informative
and contain much duplicate references.  I found Play Piano In A
Flash to concentrate more on the technical aspect of piano playing.
Play Piano In A Flash 3 seems to highlight the ""fun"" aspect of
learning how to play in 3 easy steps. Step 1 is Learn Chords To
Your Song, Step 2 is Learn Melody Line and Step 3 is Put Your Hands
Together And Play Your Tune!

Which DVD should you buy if you can only afford one?
I would choose Play Piano In A Flash 3.  Very much the same
as Playing Piano In a Flash and it cost about $20.00 less.

Silent Night is used as the learning song for both DVDs.  Scott
will take you thru a few extra songs in Piano In A Flash 3.

So come on Couch Potatoes - get off that couch and start learning
to play the piano. Above all have fun!

Listed below are the chapters for both DVDs to give you an idea
of what areas Scott addresses in this endeavor for you to learn
how to play the piano.

8457171,5,B00550NLA6,"Simple and practical with great video to demonstrate what's possible, even for aspiring pianists. It's an effective method that's helped me immensely. One observation I'd make is that the video could have been shortened and still provided the same content. Some of it ran a little longpossibly in an effort to inspire those of us who were beginning. But I found myself wishing Scott would move it along a little faster. There are also online resources for those who buy the video.",1431129600,,480,4.865853658536586

8457176,3,B00550NLA6,"He says a lot to get a point across.  I had studied piano before, so some of what he said about knowing your chords was okay.  However, you don't always play the melody in the right hand and sometime you switch up from right to left hand and sometimes you play harmony as background music to the singer. I bought this for my wife to learn how to play piano, but she does not have the patience to watch the hold video.  I will watch it a few more times and see if I can write something up to go along with his book that has a lot of music in it.  It reminds me of Ukulele sheet music.",1402099200,,583,3.8739495798319328
