5133688,4,B0085X315U,"There are reasons not to see this film. First thing I'll say is that if you haven't ready and enjoyed any HP Lovecraft books, you may not enjoy it.  Likewise if you think movies need to be ""younger and edgier"" you probably won't be able to sit through even 10 minutes The Color Out of Space."" And the final insult to the iPhone generation; it's mostly in German with subtitles!  ""Oh, dear lord, not a Foreign film!?  Why can't everyone speak English like normal people?!""

But, yes it WAS fun to watch.  The actors in this film are believable and well cast.  At time it felt more like watching a documentary rather than a film. No harrowing over the top Oscar performances, just subtle actors and actresses taking on the lives of simple folk.

It's shot in black and white with the kind of film noir cinematography that was popular in the 40's and 50s.  Personally, I prefer camera shots that are longer than the Hollywood standard 5 seconds per cut. Some takes in this movie are nearly a minute long before the camera shifts perspective.  That gives yo plenty of time to take in all the texture in the dust and cracks in the plaster or the mud on the children's shoes.  The movie is full of quiet despair and despondency so palpable you not only can feel it, you can almost taste it. No happy ending to be found here; this is Lovecraft after all.
Basically, this is a classic Lovecraft story; bleak, foreboding and dismal.  Also like all his stories, it takes forever to get moving along.  Lovecraft put a lot of effort into foreshadowing. Worse (or better if your tired of the over-hyped schlock out of LaLa Land) it's a horror story with nothing jumping out at you from the shadows, no living dead reaching up through the ground to grab you leg and no blood spurting out of severed arteries.  Yet there is suspense, it is creepy and people do die.

So although I've seen better film noir revivals, I still enjoyed The Color Out of Space as it does stay true to HP Lovecraft's style.  I think the movie would probably have looked much the same had it been shot while he was still alive.",1364428800,28,2088,4.443569553805775
5133689,4,B0085X315U,"Ok, so I am not a H.P. Lovecraft fanatic, but I can appreciate a good story that siezes the imagination, makes you wonder 'what if'. Suspensful, moody, black and white Germanic narrative; tight, clipped, at times stoic dialogue exchange- it's all in there. Upon the delivery  of the first 5 minutes, the audience will be permeated with tension, and slight fear. the eternally dark Swabian forest works to isolate, isolate, isolate the viewer. The temperature will drop five degrees while viewing this.... Well, ok maybe not. But it is a pretty good execution of a fairly 'marketable' concept in the H.P. pantheon-Something beyond human existence so starkly different then previous experience, written nor oral language can properly interpolate. Worth your time, I'd say.",1364428800,,770,5.260162601626016

5133691,5,B0085X315U,"I used to enjoy the old B&W films that made use of lighting and shadows, and creepy angles. This film does this, and it also unfolds at a good pace, bringing out the gradual horror inflicted on the family and other characters. The only color in the movie is reserved for the alien entity and it also was nicely done. Great horror/sci fi !!",1363737600,2,339,4.3125
5133692,5,B0085X315U,"The Color Out of Space is considered to be H.P. Lovecraft's most unfilmable work largely because Lovecraft often wrote of things ""beyond description"" or that human language lacked the ability to convey. So when I heard that an independent filmmaker in Germany had tackled the work, my expectations weren't very high. After watching The Color Out of Space (originally titled Die Farbe which is German for The Color) I came away extremely impressed. The filmmaker managed to capture the eerie feeling of Lovecraft's story which is something that is very hard to do, only a couple of films out there have managed to pull that off.

Purist and hardcore fans of H.P. Lovecraft's work will complain about some changes that were made to the story, including one at the end. I loved the twist that's included near the conclusion. It both surprised and shocked me, which doesn't happen very often. Fans of Lovecraft and independent horror should find The Color Out of Space well worth seeking out.

I also liked that it included a Limited Edition Exclusive Newspaper Cover from the film. One side in German(where the film takes place), and translated in English on the other side.",1353024000,66,1171,4.909090909090909
5133693,4,B0085X315U,"I've recently found myself re-reading Lovecraft's works and found that new productions, bringing his stories to film, were available. This story was one of my favorites. Whatever you may think of his writing, Lovecraft set a standard that was, and still is, employed by authors of gothic and horror fiction.
  Most attempts at translating his works to film have been dismal abominations.
  Although there are major changes and important elements left out, overall this German production worked for me as a small budget homage to the original story.
  The first few minutes are the only real detraction due to some dreadful acting by a character who, fortunately, has no re-occurring appearances. Afterwards, the acting is in keeping with any larger budget flick. The effects are minimal but several are quite creepy and work very well in the black and white format. The horror could have been intensified and extended if certain elements of the original story had been included but thank goodness we have this much.
  I find it laughable whenever I hear about the considerable inability to translate Lovecraft to film when it's been done in so many movies with obvious 'borrowings' from his descriptives yet with rare acknowledgement.
  This is worthy of any Lovecraft fan. Give us more!",1351382400,67,1287,5.085714285714285
5133694,5,B0085X315U,"If you are enjoying the 'Mythoscope' retro-styled films of the HPLHS you will want to see DIE FARBE, a German adaption of THE COLOUR OUT OF SPACE (as of course the gentleman from Providence would have insisted it spelt!).

Shot in sumptious B&W with a very competent cast and clever effects, Huan Vin shows that he is a talented director and writer that clearly understands HPL's vision of otherwordly horror that relies largely on suspense and concept rather than outright violence. In relocating the story to rural Germany the story loses very little from the original, and the inclusion of WW2 takes it into another direction entirely.

The first five minutes are a little poorly realized with some very noticeable green-screen that took me back to the Color Seperation Overlay technique of the 70s, but once the filming shifts to almost entirely location-work in the German countryside the production does not make a wrong step. It looks terrific with atmospheric locations and period design.

In all it has impressive acting, music and visuals and is a superb compliment to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Whisperer-in-Darkness/dp/B006LMRMMA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Whisperer in Darkness</a>&nbsp;if you want to run your own HP Lovecraft Festival at home!

5133696,4,B0085X315U,"Too much padding, but otherwise a fine adaptation of a Lovecraft short story.  In general, his stories only seem to be good for about 45 minutes of material, which is why the 2005 Call of Cthulu, which was 47 minutes long, turned out so well.

Most full length movies based on short stories are not very good because they require too much filler. Because of this, this movie was very slow moving with too many lengthy shots where nothing was happening. Arguably, the long shots of nothing were mood setters but my mood quickly soured.

Edgar Allen Poe defined the short story as being a composition in which all elements aimed at a single target in his essay and anthem of purpose. H.P. Lovecraft, in his The Supernatural Horror in Literature""  sounded a clarion call by writing ""The oldest and strongest emotion of mankind is fear, and the oldest and strongest kind of fear is fear of the unknown."" . THAT is the singular single target of HPL's short tales, and to the consternation of Weird Tale's editor, his long novellas too... all works whose medium were their message... that mood of Horror that a human being feels when the darkness dawns in their imagination and their awful depths quicken to become as some psychic telescope lens focussed on the dark between the stars and the heart is gripped in the fist of Azathoth for they move from suspicion to naked recognition that the Cosmos is infinite, empty of all values, and impersonal to the point that the New Gods are the monsters we imaging when faced with our own insignificance and how easily even worlds are destroyed and instantly forgotten in the icy Cocytus of Time. This is the tiny wriggling larva of alien origin that is the grain of sand that stimulates the Black Pearl of Lovecraft's creations. And This version of the Color Out of Space gets THAT right. The essential salt that contains the soul of horror. Starts a little awkward like The Night of the Living Dead but like The Night of the Living Dead ends in a Horror based of an existential taste of abandon that walks us across a bridge going into an empty city past a car crash, to follow a girl walking in a circle like a man lost in a snow storm. We in a conveyor belt consumer society that are trained to anticipate a conveyor belt hamburger delivery of shocks by sex and violence to the system will have difficulty even seeing what a film of place is trying to do. But those movies of Action are like a wave that roll over you. A horror film steeps into you. .. then it wells up under your feet as you walk - as if the grass was becoming soaked by the outraged blood of the murdered buried there.

5133717,5,B0085X315U,"As a huge fan of Lovecraft I've watched a number of movies that have been based on his works and some of them have been quite good, while others are more abominable than the creatures he created.  But the one story he wrote that always fascinated me the most was ""The Colour Out Of Space"".  It is a very atmospheric piece that not only keeps you on the edge of your seat, but the finish leaves you shuddering, when you realize the danger is not completely over and that each year it is spreading a little more.

Because of the unusual nature of the antagonist, many considered this story to be one that nobody could film and do it justice.  But I learned some time ago that a small German independent film company did try and called their version ""Die Farbe"" (The Color).  So finding it here on Amazon got me very excited and I watched it for the first time today and I'm still blown away.  I don't always like movies with a lot of subtitles, but this film had some English speakers, as well as some subtitles.  But the director did not rely very heavily on dialogue but more ""Showing"" than ""Telling"" the story.  It's a slow piece, yet it utilizes that pace to build tension and an atmosphere of growing isolation and danger.  Some Lovecraft purists have complained that the entire story did not follow the story EXACTLY word for word, but little was left out.  The film is to me a masterpiece, shot in Black and White, which also puts some people off.  But it is done with a purpose and is used very effectively.  There is no gore in this piece, but like Lovecraft's writing, we are given brief glimpses to tell you what's happening and then your own imagination can run wild and scare you even more.

This film is brilliant in every respect.  My only disappointment was that it was not longer.  Still at 1 hour and 20 minutes or so, it tells a great story.  I highly recommend it to all Lovecraft fans and even those who are just curious to see why I find this film so fascinating.",1464480000,5,1983,4.362397820163488

This is a slow, story like movie filmed in black and white. That's not to say it's bad, just that it's low budget and an indie type movie. Black and white was a good choice because it makes the titular color out of space more dramatic when you get to that part.

5133741,4,B0085X315U,"Lovecraft is fiendishly difficult to interpret, which just adds to the allure and mystique of the author and his genius. So much of his work begs to be transferred to film, but few dare their reputation to make the effort.
""The Colour Out Of Space"" is by far my favorite H.P.L. short story, to the point where I have re-read it so many times whole sections are committed to memory.  Its psychedelic ambience lends itself to visual retelling, so it would  be natural that it would be the cinematic vanguard for Lovecraft's translation to the movies.

This faithful and insightful effort hews closely to the original tale, preserving its haunting quality and anachronistic setting. The deep and primeval forests of Germany are perfect candidates for a relocation of the story, and resetting of the timeline to the period of post-WWII German occupation is a masterstroke, given the unsettling and chaotic nature of that time.
Beyond those changes, the narrative -thankfully- essentially unfolds almost identically to the original. The use of black-and-white photography is an appropriate aesthetic decision, and the austere and withdrawn character of the rural inhabitants present an archetype indistinguishable from the residents of Arkham.
The director and actors all seem to have the deepest respect for and familiarity with Lovecraft's work. The incorporation of hallucinogenic CGI to define the Color is, I think, a bold and creatively successful stroke.

And one more, by ""Requin,"":""I'm a die-hard horror fan and nothing fazes me anymore but I have to say, this movie had me glued to the screen and freaked me out more than once. Extremely effective. Stellar acting. Never mind the subtitles. And the b&w just adds to the Lovecraftian feel. Slow moving but it adds to the suspense.""

As for my comments, which are all about the other reviews here:

First of all, I was struck by the incessant return to Lovecraft-as-author in review after review. ""Did a lousy job reproducing Lovecraft,"" ""Did a fine job with translating Lovecraft to film,"" ""Didn't take place in Massachusetts, so I didn't think it was Lovecraftian,"" ""The director doesn't understand/truly understands Lovecraft."" Go through a few reviewed movies on Amazon which are based on a famous writer's work: You simply won't find this much obsession with the originating novelist. I try to be sympathetic to Lovecraft lovers. Among my English major students, there were occasionally a few; I tried to respect him as a serious twentieth-century American author. He is authentic and very loyal to his fictional world, he did some things no one else had done (not many, but a few), and he has definitely drawn the attention of a few intelligent readers who have been fairly widely read (like my students). But Lovecraft's readers, as is evidenced abundantly here, are more in the nature of acolytes than discerning readers of literature or watchers-of-movies. I wonder if any of them could stop thinking ""This is by Lovecraft, this is by Lovecraft, this is by Lovecraft"" over and over throughout the movie.

Another recurring motif had to do with the fact the movie was in black and white and that there were subtitles. I was surprised by the unusual number of times these were mentioned in a movie review. It's perfectly okay to dislike b&w foreign films--most of which possess these traits--but I've always thought people who disliked foreign flicks disliked them because the plots were too slow or too talky or too ""philosophical."" Now I find, to my astonishment, the objection has always been that Truffaut, Goddard, and Antonioni made movies in black and white in a foreign language with subtitles. There just are evidently lots of otherwise intelligent people who have to work too hard to understand a story that isn't in English or in color.

The reviews here are very much the sort of post-viewing short-essay commentary that I'd expect if I dragged a bunch of freshmen into an auditorium to watch a movie for Film 101, say ""Birth of a Nation."" In other words, I'd be making a bunch of people without much knowledge of the breadth of film-making or of literature watch a movie where nobody talks. So how are you supposed to understand it? And you're making them watch a supposed ""action"" film absent technicolor, CGI, and well-known stars. It's just confusing for them.

If only this movie had drawn the attention of its true audience: People who are indifferent to H.P. Lovecraft's authorship of the original story (whether they like Lovecraft as an author or not), people who are used to watching movies that try their damnedest to portray what's going on inside of human beings (nobody of course mentioned our growing understanding of the moral dimensions in the young German protagonist as the film progresses), and people who admire the craftsmanship of a director whose use of German Expressionism is brilliant, thus demonstrating that he's spent a lot of time (a lot of time) looking at other films and knows how creatively to  use what he's learned.

So I'm going to recommend this movie to lots of my friends (who include everybody from ""Fast and Furious"" fans to steady watchers of Italian post-war ""cinema povera"" pictures). And I'm not going to tell them that it's from a story by H.P. Lovecraft, or that it's in black and white, or that it has subtitles. Hopefully, they won't notice as they're being mesmerized by the masterful direction, fine acting, beautiful cinematography, and crisp dialogue of a damned fine movie.",1440720000,,4503,4.832684824902723
5133743,3,B0085X315U,"This is a version of Lovecraft's story.  Not bad, but a little slow-paced for me.  It's a German version so there may be subtitles.  If you like H.P. Lovecraft this should appeal to you.",1440201600,,186,4.411764705882353
5133744,5,B0085X315U,"Unquestionably, of all the renderings of the work of H.P. Lovecraft into cinema, this interpretation heels the closest to the author's own intention and spirit.  Even the choices that deviated from the original written story (location & time)  actually allow it to better elicit the feelings and ambiance for the contemporary audience that the work was intended to elicit.  Lovecraft often said that, rather than ""evil"", he was trying to produce a sense of the absolutely otherwordly and non-human -- that which was so alien from us that it could never be truly comprehended; and he felt this story was his most successful in this regard.

Excellent work by the company that produced this film.  I highly recommend it to all lovers of the work of H. P. Lovecraft, or anyone who appreciates a truly eerie and atmospheric experience.",1438819200,2,831,4.9496402877697845

5133748,4,B0085X315U,"*I received a review copy of this film in exchange for an honest review

H.P. Lovecrafts fiction has been the basis for many films, including both original stories and adaptations of his work.  Several of these films are very good, including THE UNNAMABLE and CASTLE FREAK, while others are outstanding, such as Stuart Gordons RE-ANIMATOR and DAGON.  Im proud to announce Huan Vus THE COLOR OUT OF SPACE will join the upper echelon of these excellent Lovecraft adaptations.  This film is a brilliant recreation of the story, and I highly recommend giving it a look.

I wasn't sure what to expect going into this one.  Several years ago, I watched another adaptation of this particular Lovecraft story, only this one was titled COLOUR FROM THE DARK.  It was a good film, but it deviated from the original story quite a bit.  This film, on the other hand, stays much closer to the source material.

THE COLOR OUT OF SPACE is shot very well and looks great onscreen.  It is presented in black-and-white, except for the strange meteorite globules, which are shown in shimmering color.  This stark contrast makes for an interesting viewing experience and heightens the immersive nature of the film.

The acting is very good, however I have to admit I am not familiar with any of the cast.  Likewise, the special effects look great as well.  I particularly like the CG used for the meteorite globules; this looks impressive, especially when they are shown against the black-and-white backdrop of the rest of the film.

If I were forced to find a flaw with THE COLOR OUT OF SPACE, I might have to mention the odd nature of the first five minutes of the movie.  For some reason, these first few minutes seem out of place with the rest.  Perhaps this is because they have a different feel and a slightly different look than the rest of the film.  Granted, they don't detract from the movie overall, but I do feel this is worth mentioning.

Otherwise, THE COLOR OUT OF SPACE is a major win for me, and I highly recommend it.  Be sure and snag one of the Limited Edition Blu-rays (they only made 1000 copies!); in addition to some slick reversible artwork, it also contains an exclusive newspaper cover insert.  Also included on the Blu-ray are:

* A variety of Lovecraft audiobooks
* Dreamlands Trailer
* Making of THE COLOR OUT OF SPACE
* Lost scene
* Science and Horror Featurette
* Effects and Concepts Featurette

  This Adaptation strongly reminds me of that of the HP Lovecraft Society's Call of Cthulhu in theme & style.  And I find that it is FAR superior to the late 1960's adaptation that was titled under ""Die Monster, Die"".  If you are able to procure this limited release edition, than by all means do so.

That being said, people who are not fans would most likely be best to skip it. It is EXTREMELY slow-paced, much in the style of early movies back when people had pre-internet attention spans. I thought it was pretty creative to make the alien color seem otherworldly by making it the ""other"" color in an otherwise black-and-white movie.

5133755,4,B0085X315U,"Lovecraft is pretty well unfilmable but that's what they said about Lord of the Rings. Of the versions of this I've seen, this is by far the best. It is a very faithful rendition of HPL's classic tale - which I think I'm going to reread tonight. It has been transplanted to Germany and bookended by another tale, the real relevance of which is lost on me since the real story is told by recounting. Nicely done in b/w and quite atmospheric but I do wish the subtitler could spell. Oh well...It's a highly enjoyable film for all that and well worth the time. Three stars is too low, four too high but make up your own minds, Lovecraft fans.
I can't wait until del Toro takes on At the Mountains of Madness.
A note on the Blu-ray itself. It would not play at all on my player. It would get to the selection then shut off then reboot. Maybe it's trying to tell me something. Maybe it's one of those movies that ultimately drives you mad or kills you. Having just watched it on my laptop, only time will tell if I wind up in the mouth of madness.

And yes, it is somewhat low-budget, but if you can hold out until the walk through of the farm house you will be rewarded for your interest.  What is really great are the location shots (I believe done near Tubingen); they give the film a rural, isolated look which adds to the creepiness when bad things happen to innocent people.  It kind of reminds me of a 1930's Nazi era film, I saw on German TV, set in a pastoral Germany prior to the horror to come.  Probably only for die hard Lovecraft Fans but it is right up there with the H. P. Lovecraft Historical Society's productions for keeping to the unfathomable-cosmic spirit of HPL's works.

Before long, I was still waiting for anything even slightly entertaining or interesting. Finally I was just hoping that it would end since I'd given up hope on anything that would hold my attention. I'm no longer a big fan of black & white movies, but I do admire the use of B & W where the plot, subject or some other aspect of the movie justifies its use. While I did feel that they could have easily added in quite a bit more color, I was also satisfied with the use of B & W and found that it helped me to pick up on some of the details perhaps better than I would have. I'm very used to comedic horror films, but this was not one of those even though I found myself laughing out loud at the facial expressions numerous times. Even though I did not like this movie at all, I still suggest that if you find anything in the summary to be of interest - then watch it and make your own decision.

There have been some significant changes made to the original short story, for instance, the setting is now post-WWII Germany and there's the notable omission of one incident from the story which will no doubt upset some Lovecraft fans. But the most important things are in place, and the last 10-15 minutes are downright chilling. The use of mostly B&W is unnervingly effective.

Take note the entire film is in German with English subtitles. There is no dub. I personally hate most dubs and prefer subtitles so this was no issue to me, but I know there are people who feel the opposite and not even having the option will make this something they will not be pleased with.

He also reveals another story, when, as a German soldier, right after World War II, he had another interaction with the meteorite site and some American soldiers and weird violet light that may be an alien life form. The young man's father was one of the American soldiers, and it seems that may be the effects of the violet light.

The movie is filmed in black and white, other than the violet light part, and the dialogue is in German with subtitles, except for the occasional English speaking element. It comes across as low budget, with most of the budget blown on the violet light effect.

The movie is too long, full of posturing actors and takes itself much too seriously.  I ended up being bored rather than terrorized.

The acting is mediocre. Overall I enjoyed it and would recommend it  as long as one's expectations are not too high.

Regardless, this black and white film (with ""color"" where appropriate) has a deep creepiness that keeps you on that proverbial edge of your seat.  It is, at times, odd and enigmatic, and definitely looks like it came from the 30's rather than 2012, but it is very effective.

The filmmakers pad out the short story to make this a feature length film. Where most adaptations of the short form fail on this point this film's added material is smartly written, sensible and fits into the overall narrative beautifully both updating it and remaining true to the period piece it should be. The choice to shoot in black and white is also an excellent one given that the Color is an indescribable hue to the human eye by making the film monochromatic and the title entity a vibrant shade of violet in this setting gives the creature the unearthly quality demanded of it from the story. The film keeps its effects small but effective and are suitable for a feature with so limited a budget without it looking like some garbage from the SyFy channel.

5133824,5,B0085X315U,"This is a German film based on H.P. Lovecraft's story, The Color Out of Space. In German, the movie is titled simply Die Fabre, translated to English: The Color.

What a hidden gem of a movie this is! Most of the major films claiming to be inspired by H.P. Lovecraft commit all the sins typical to the worst of 80s horror movies: too many rubber masks, melting faces, and screaming as victims and villains dissolve into bright white light. In short, an emphasis on gore and flash. Any reader of Lovecraft knows that gore is sometimes there, but that's not what drives his horror.

Lovecraft's stories create a deep dread, a fear as characters find themselves in the presence of a much greater power that is at best apathetic but more often malicious. The common reaction characters have to these powers (assuming the character survives) is a babbling gratitude that these other-worldly beings have not discovered or decided to torment humanity as a whole. The basic human craving for ""Why?"" remains painfully elusive. The only thing that is certain is that these supernatural powers have no respect for, or fear of, humankind. We are but their playthings.

That's what H.P. Lovecraft's stories are all about, and The Color Our of Space captures it perfectly. The black and white filming and the slow pace is a perfect match for the creepiness of Lovecraft's writing. An unrelenting strangeness creeps toward you, drawing you in by using your curiosity, until you realize there is no escape, sometimes physically, but more often from the knowledge you thought you wanted.

The film is true to the story except for a slight and irrelevant discrepancy on the setting (rural Germany in the movie, rural Massachusetts in the prose.) Other than that, it's a near-perfect adaptation.

I love films like this: independent labors of love with none of the trappings of modern movies such as product placement, overbearing and irrelevant soundtracks, and the inescapable cliche of the charters marching slow-mo in Flying-V formation to enjoin the final battle.

Die Fabre is certainly not for everyone (there's some English but mostly it is spoken in German with English subtitles) but I gladly give five stars for someone finally, FINALLY bringing the great horror stories of Lovecraft to the screen with a professional sheen. I hope to see more.

The movie takes place in two time frames, WW II Germany and modern Germany.

The film was shot in Schwabenland, and the backdrop is beautiful.

This was clearly a labor of love by two film school graduates.  It is an adaptation of HP Lovecraft's original, set in the 1920s in rural New England.

The film did a good job of capturing the confusion and despair of people caught in something both beyond their understanding and too horrible to grasp.

I loved their integration of German cultural aspects, the specter of WW II, and the German-US dynamic in the film.  The father of the family being harried by the Lovecraftian horror does not ask for help from the authorities because of fierce Teutonic pride and fatalism.  Both the US and German soldiers depicted fighting in WW II are doing their duty without any crazed, hegemonistic zeal.  The US soldiers are shown to be both compassionate, but also more than a tad nive.  The US boy heading back to Germany to find his dad tries, but clearly struggles to speak broken German, and the German workers he meets think he is a bit silly.

The extras on the DVD are well worth watching.  This is especially true if you do any film work yourself.

5133859,5,B0085X315U,"Lovecraft books are hard to capture on film but they have done it here to perfection. This is the creepy, suspenseful look that corresponds perfectly with his prose. No blood to speak of, or even violence, but this is horror that may keep you up all night anyway.",1377216000,2,263,4.5
5133860,4,B0085X315U,"Let me start off by saying that the product shipped by Amazon was a dud.  I'm not the kind of person to rate the product one star because I received a bad copy in the mail, however, so my rating is on what the content should have been had it not been a dud.  Specifically, on my version, the sound cuts in and out randomly, so I missed parts of conversation and it really detracted from the whole feel of the film when you have the music suddenly stop, then start up again at random intervals.  So for the copy I received, I give it one star, and say: buyer beware.

That aside, this was a very good adaptation, and felt like a decent classic horror film.  The pacing is slow, but rather than have the modern constant ups and downs when it comes to tension, the tension builds masterfully up until the final few minutes of the film.  It is refreshing to see a Lovecraft film done with a careful approach, rather than the using of Lovecraftian ideas to generate a hack and slash generic horror film (Reanimator, Dagon).  I am not saying I did not enjoy Reanimator or Dagon, but those films decidedly did not capture the careful, painstaking strokes Lovecraft took in his writing.  This film comes up short as well, but it comes far closer than any film I have seen yet, other than Call of Cthulhu by the Lovecraft Historical Society.  I have not watched Whisperer in Darkness yet, but I will soon when the weather becomes a bit gloomier.

One last point: this film may not hold up as well for the uninitiated.  It is definitely made by Lovecraft fans for Lovecraft fans.  For me, the experience was one of seeing a favorite story on the screen, told in a slightly different way.  I am not sure how I would have enjoyed this film had I never read the story or heard of Lovecraft.  Chances are, if you are reading this review, you are in familiar territory, and if so, this film is well-worth seeing.  Just make sure you get a working copy.",1377129600,,1937,4.3565459610027855

5133872,3,B0085X315U,"I'm not a huge Lovecraft fan but this is probably among the more faithful and restrained movies based on his stories - most of which have proven notoriously difficult to adapt well. It's nothing like the over-the-top Jeffrey Combs movies (although ""Re-Animator"" is a fun campy cult classic horror flick, and Combs is to Lovecraft as Vincent Price was to Poe). The story is based on Lovecraft's notion that a ""real"" extraterrestrial visitor would be unlike anything we can conceive of and certainly wouldn't be in humanoid form. A very difficult concept to tackle but handled well here. (Stephen King basically swiped Lovecraft's concept for ""The Tommyknockers"", one of the few King novels I really liked.)

The intro seems awkward due to some stilted acting by one character, but about 5-10 minutes into the movie it settles into a disquieting groove. No gore, no screaming, no cussing - just a grinding sense of unease and tension.  The main actors are quite good and you'll quickly forget you're watching a very low budget movie - assuming you're not expecting a slam-bang gorefest.

If you're into indie and oddball stuff and have the patience for the pacing it's quite good for a low budget, b&w digital video movie. Give it a chance, especially if you just enjoy studying how low budget movies are made, and the techniques used to overcome the usual audience expectation of a ""film-like"" look.

The monochrome conversion wasn't entirely satisfactory.  Apparently in order to insert color later Vu desaturated most of the movie, and at least on streaming video the monochrome shifts between slightly magenta and greenish.  It doesn't appear to be a deliberate choice to reflect Lovecraft's description of the ""blasted heath"" and affected area as appearing in other-worldly but faded colors.  The effect mostly looks like unintentional artifacts.  The cinematography is the main reason I'd give it only 3 stars, unless you're a devoted Lovecraft fan who will appreciated Vu's restrained and faithful approach to the story.

Another low budget indie movie I can recommend was the 2010 ""Monsters"" by Gareth Edwards, also shot directly on video but with much more polished cinematography than Vu's movie. Read the background about how Edwards did most of the post production and special effects work himself using off the shelf software. He was so impressive he earned the shot at directing the upcoming remake of ""Godzilla"", and I'm betting he'll do well.",1373760000,18,2456,5.074441687344913

It was when the story traveled to Germany the pace really bogged down for me.  The acting is top notch, the story has the Lovecraftian feel, the bw filming is appropriate and helps set the mood, but 'The Color Out of Space' could have really used some editing to turn some of the drag to dread.

5133884,5,B0085X315U,"When I first became interested in HP Lovecraft back in the '60s, he was pretty much a niche interest of horror/fantasy readers. A very few movies based on his stories had been made in the last century, A not bad (for the time) adaptation of one of HPL's few novels, ""The Case of Charles Dexter Ward"" was incredibly touted as ""Edgar Allen Poe's Haunted Palace."" ""The Colour Out of Space,"" this story, was also produced as ""Die Monster Die.""

In recent times there has been more scholastic interest in Lovecraft, and a few movies have been produced that honor Lovecraft's story structure and dramatic POV. Lovecraft was a self-taught scholarly sort whose ramblings meant he had to travel the cheapest way with his expenses figured to the bone, and this is reflected in his writing. A typical meme is of a scholarly traveler who stumbles upon some marvels, pursues their meaning, and ends facing danger and/or disbelief from others.

In this story, a surveyor doing advance work for a new reservoir comes upon an abandoned farm in backwoods Massachusetts with a large anomalous circular area, a ""blasted heath,"" where not a thing grows. Our traveler makes inquiries, and the story spins out...

This movie is almost entirely in German (with subtitles). The only connections with HPL's Massachusetts are contained in a wrapper story that has an American seeking his father who disappeared in Germany while visiting the place where his patrol ended up at the end of WWII. Putting this ""wrapper"" aside, the story unusually follows the written story very closely. Too subtlely for the audiences of the latter century, the story spins out as Lovecraft's book did, well paced with the plot unfolding as Lovecraft intended, and the result is frightening and satisfying. Finally, a major author is interpreted according to his writings, not what Hollywood thinks people want to see.",1365897600,3,1871,4.990384615384615

By necessity people make a kind of joke out of Cthulu and the whole universe of unnamable creatures he created;  this is because otherwise Lovecraft would be unpalatable.  He doesn't have a second of humor.  And this movie articulates one of his best stories, ""The Colour Out of Space"", in just that vein.

That isn't to say there isn't anything wrong with it; sometimes the dialogues continue for too long to make room for the next fit of insanity or whatever.  Largely, though, this seems to be the answer to the camp of ""Herbert West: Reanimator"".  Must see for all Lovecraft fans.

8525712,4,B0085X315U,"This review is for the Blu-Ray version of 'The Color Out Of Space (Limited Edition) released by Brink in 2015.

First off, for the record I want to say that I am not a big fan of Lovecraft. Therefore I'm qualifying my review by stating that my score will be lower than that of fans of Lovecraft.

Please note that the language used in this movie is mostly German and you will need subtitles if you don't speak the language. There are some Americans in the movie who speak English.

This movie was made by student film makers in Germany and they have done an excellent job with a low budget. On that basis alone, this movie deserves 5 stars. However, I am rating this on the movie itself and the content in the release.

This movie does not follow the story exactly but does follow the original pretty close with most of the plot points. The obvious difference is that Lovecraft's story takes place in New England while this one takes place in Germany. The story of what happens as told by the inn patron follows Lovecraft's story very closely with some small differences.

PLOT: The movie opens with a young man of German descent driving through the woods of Germany in search of his father. He meets a couple of construction workers who tell him the road is blocked and the valley he is in is going to be flooded. They direct him through a back road to the town he is looking for. At an Inn he shows a picture of his father but nobody recognizes him. Once he drops an old picture of his father in an American army uniform during WW II one of the patrons recognizes the picture. He is then told the story of what happened in the valley during WW II.

A meteor had landed in the valley. A group of scientists came and took samples but the samples would just disappear. In addition the meteorite was shrinking. One day it simply disappeared. Strange things began happening in the valley. A family slowly goes crazy that lives nearby. The trees grow enlarged fruit but it is not edible. The land goes bad and the vegetation crumbles. Eventually a group of soldiers comes through the valley where they take the narrator down to the valley. He relays the strange events that followed. The visitor does not believe the narrator and he believes that he is crazy and leaves in a hurry to go find his father.

PERSONAL COMMENTS: I simply am not a fan of H.P. Lovecraft. I have read quite a few of his stories but not most of his stories. I have read enough to form an opinion. I basically read one collection which brought together most of his most famous works along with a few others. Some of the stories I read are 'The Dunwich Horror,' 'Call of Cthulhu, 'Rats in the Walls,' along with 'The Colour Out of Space.'
For the most part, I find the stories dull. I understand that they are not written the way a modern horror story is written. They are designed to build a feeling of horror. But I simply don't like the stories. For whatever the reason, I never really feel that horror. I guess it's just the modern world we live in. It feels like all the stories are written in a time period of hundreds of years ago or they feel like they are not in this country although most of the stories are set in New England. The stories just don't grip me and after having read one collection, I have no desire to read anymore. I pushed my way through the first one just to see what all the fuss was about. I am not disparaging anybody who is fan of Lovecraft. It is obvious the stories are very well written. It's just not to my taste.

The movie being in German does not bother me. I watch all movies with subtitles anyway even when in English.

I don't mind the movie being in black & white either. The only thing I might have done differently is to do the flashback sequences, most of the movie, in black and white and left modern day in color. Depicting the world war two era scenes in black and white is in my opinion a good idea. It also allowed the use of color to be especially effective for the alien being (alien essence?).
The color used for the alien's essence is purple but it could have been any color since the color is described as a color that can't be described. Perhaps the directors could have used a color that changes shades or colors for the color?....or a mixed color, sort of like a modern art painting?

I am never a fan of movies that use a flashback sequence or start with a scene in the modern world and then go back to a previous time. In this case, despite it being a horror movie, I lost all sense of horror for the person telling the story. What I mean is that if the person telling the story is alive and telling you the story then you know there is no possibility that harm can come to him in the past (unless of course he tells you he has been resurrected from the dead!)

RECOMMENDATIONS: I'm giving this release an overall 4 stars. If you were to rate this as a student film then I'd have to give it 5 stars. On that basis it is very well done and if I'm a professor grading this project I'm giving it an A+! If you are a fan of Lovecraft I am giving the plot 4 stars. If you do not like Lovecraft, like myself, then I'm giving the plot 2 to 2 1/2 stars. It gets an average of 3 to 3 1/2 stars.  I am boosting it up to 4 stars because there were some good extra's. You get an extra scene and some featurette's along with an insert.",1515542400,,5352,4.241413150147203
