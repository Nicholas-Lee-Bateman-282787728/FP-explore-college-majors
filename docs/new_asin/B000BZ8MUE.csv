I assumed there would be a sequence to be followed and your done, NO. I recommend first watching the DVD, then choose the exercise you want to work on.",1464739200,,296,4.303571428571429
8281953,5,B000BZ8MUE,"This program is well presented and organized. The Coach is extremely knowledgeable about the game and his training routines effective. Following the routines diligently I have gotten stronger and way more flexible. My range of motion has improved which I attribute to a big increase in my Serve's power and speed. I never understood how to warm-up before a match so the pre-match warm-up exercises were a big help. As a slow starter they get me warmed up quickly and into the rhythm of play much earlier than before.

I am happy with this purchase, the program has answered my many questions about injuries and getting in better overall shape for the game.",1147392000,8,656,4.8053097345132745
