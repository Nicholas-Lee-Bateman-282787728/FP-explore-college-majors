7965863,3,B000069I3Z,"On The Edge is a movie originally shot for Showtime in the US featuring three short films directed by famous women, two of which are Anne Heche, and Hellen Mirren. I cannot recall the third woman director, nor the name of her film, which unfrotunately is the sole reason this movie got an imperfect rating from me.
The 1st film Happy Birthday, directed by Hellen Mirren is brilliant. It features an incredible number of cameos but it is told in a captivating and simple way. Among the people who make cameos you'll see John Goodman, Christopher Loyd, David Hyde Pierce, and more.
The 2nd film is boring, poorly paced, and too long.
The 3rd film directed by Anne Heche, entitled Reaching Normal and starring Andie MacDowall is both interresting and funny. It tells the story of two psychic lovers, but in an off the wall, interresting way. Ellen Degeneres makes a short cameo in this film as a telephone operator.
The three films are tied together by a cute morality tale of a hollywood producer and his secretary. A little contrived, but entertaining, this short is interresting to watch and come back to between the other three films. Interrestingly enough, it features Scott Lowell from the american Queer As Folk.
I would recommend this film to those interrested in short films, or science fiction, but not to anyone found of only one particular star as screentime for any one actor is usually less than one minute.",1058313600,5,1418,4.7682926829268295
