4846133,5,B005ND8812,"Bold, stylish and a pre-code non-musical film by Ernst Lubitsch, ""Design for Living"" receives new life with the Criterion Collection's Blu-ray release of a film which showcases radicalism but a wonderful performance by its talent Fredric March, Gary Cooper and Miriam Hopkins.

It was 1932 when filmmaker Ernst Lubitch's  contract with Paramount had run out.  Having completed the musical film ""One Hour with You"" with Maurice Chevalier and Jeanette MacDonald (featured in Criterion's ""Eclipse Series #8: Lubitsch Musicals""), Lubitsch was a hot filmmaker which United Artists and Columbia were going after.

But for Lubitsch, he wanted to try something different.  He wanted to direct for the stage in New York City but instead re-signed with Paramount for a three-film contract and what is most significant about this contract is the two films that he developed that were non-musical romantic comedies.  One was his masterpiece ""Trouble in Paradise""(as part of the Criterion Collection #170) and his other was ""Design for Living"" (1933).

""Design for Living"" is loosely based on Noel Coward's play and features a screenplay and earlier work by legendary screenwriter Ben Hecht (""Scarface"", ""Notorious"", ""Wuthering Heights"", ""Spellbound"", ""His Girl Friday"").

While the film has been released on DVD as part of Universal's ""The Gary Cooper Collection"", this is the first time the film has received a Blu-ray release and unlike the DVD version which had three movies on each disc and was compressed, this is the best version of the film released on video to date.

""Design for Living"" was known back then as Lubitch's first film dealing with contemporary morals.  A film literally about a menage a trois, three people involved in a relationship.  Needless to say, this was shot prior to Hollywood's Hays Code which would ban indecency in films.  But a year later, after the Production Code Administration initiated the code, the film would be banned by the Catholic Legion of Decency and was denied a PCA for re-release.

VIDEO:

""Design for Living"" is presented in 1:33:1 black and white.  According to the Criterion Collection, this new high-definition digital transfer was created on a Spirit 1K Datacine from a 35 mm fine-grain master positive.  Thousands of instances of dirt, debris, scratches, splices, warps, jitter and flicker were manually removed using MTI's DRS and Pixel Farm's PFClean, while Image System's DVNR was used for small dirt, grain, and noise reduction.  Image Mill's steady was also used to reduce film weave.

For those who owned the original Universal ""The Gary Cooper Collection"" DVD set, one of the things that I disliked about the Universal release and a practice used on a few of their older films was putting these movies (in this case, three of them) on a DVD.  In fact, I knew before watching the Criterion Collection Blu-ray release that the picture quality would definitely be much better than this DVD release by a large margin and I was right.

The original Universal DVD looked blurry, a lot of white specks, blemishes, occasional flickering and while there was grain, this Blu-ray release not only looks beautiful, the film damage seen on the DVD version is literally non-existent when watching it on Blu-ray.  The clarity and detail faces are noticeable, while the DVD is noticeable for its blurriness.  Even objects and structures look blurry and lack detail.  The Blu-ray release showcases the detail.  Grays and whites and overall contrast is beautiful.  Blacks levels are very nice!

Hands down, this is the best looking version of the film-to-date.  Granted, I wouldn't throw away your copy of the ""The Gary Cooper Collection"" as there are five movies worth watching in that set.  But for ""Design for Living"", the Criterion Collection Blu-ray release is the best looking version of the film to date.

AUDIO & SUBTITLES:

""Design for Living"" is presented in monaural.  According to the Criterion Collection, the original monaural soundtrack was remastered at 24-bit from a fine-grain soundtrack print.  Clicks, thumps, hiss and hum were manually removed using Pro Tools HD.  Crackle was attenuated using AudioCube's integrated workstation.

Dialogue is crisp and clear, and I detected no hiss or crackle.  Nothing that distracted me while viewing.

Subtitles are presented in English SDH.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

""Design for Living - The Criterion Collection #592' on Blu-ray comes with the following special features:

  The Clerk - (2:21) A very short segment of the 1932 omnibus ""If I Had a Million"" in which Ernst Lubitsch directed one of the scenes featuring Charles Laughton.
  Selected-Scene Commentary - (36:31) Film professor William Paul, author of ""Ernst Lubtisch's American Comedy"" talks about the production history of the film and his analysis of various scenes.
  Joseph McBride: The Screenplay -(22:08)  An interview with film scholar and screenwriter Joseph McBride who talks about the differences between Noel Coward's play and Ben Hecht's script (and his approach to adaptation) and also what made the film so special.
  Play of the Week: A Choice of Coward - (1:13:31) A 1964 British ITV television production of the original ""Design For Living"" featuring an introduction by original creator Noel Coward.

EXTRAS:

""Design for Living - The Criterion Collection #592' comes with an 24-page booklet featuring image stills from the film and the essay ""It Takes Three"" by Kim Morgan.

JUDGMENT CALL:

When you watch an Ernst Lubitsch film, I pretty much know that I'm going to have a great time.

He has a way of approaching a storyline and directing and utilizing his talent with enormous efficacy, it's no surprise of why he is considered such a legendary filmmaker.  But while he is remembered for films such as ""Ninotchka"", ""Shop Around the Corner"", ""Trouble in Paradise"", ""To Be or Not to Be"" to name a few, ""Design for Living"" is an interesting and unique Lubitsch film because it takes on social morals and in this case, not love by two people but love by three people.

You are not going to find many films within the last 90-years that features a menage a trois as part of a romantic comedy storyline.  Even in today's society where you may see the banal gigolo with his women, in this case, its two men who love the same woman and woman who loves both men.

How do you approach a story with that kind of relationship.  For one, that was the challenge for filmmaker Ernst Lubitsch and earlier in his career, Ben Hecht. In Hecht's adaptation, both men would not follow Noel Coward's film verbally, but still maintain the adventure of the three individuals.  While, the film adaptation would feature Max Plunkett as forgettable man.

But its the performances that manage to take this film and literally make it entertaining.  We know that Tom is the more decent man of the three, Tom is more of the man who can't wait to have sex with Gilda and Gilda is a woman who is very intelligent, carefree and she manages to hold these two men on a string, making them part of her Bohemian lifestyle and acknowledging that they have their own ethics, their own lifestyle.

There really is no true or threatening drama, no risky high point that challenges the three on their morals.  No government, not society telling them what they are doing is indecent.  Only Max Plunkett, Gilda's boss and the film's clown.

So, the film is audacious, its absurd but it's witty and mischievous to the point that that makes you intrigued that a Hollywood film like ""Design for Living"" was ever created.  And yet, it possible was a film that was ahead of its time, or maybe easily to take in today than it was then.  While the film did do well in the box office as many came to see a Noel Coward film, like the critics, reviews were mixed because this film was nothing like Noel Coward's play.  But at the same time, it probably was best that Hecht did stray from the original as the fear was that people watching film would not understand Noel Coward dialogue.

But I felt it was a smart move on Lubitsch's part to have Hecht craft the screenplay and distance themselves from Noel Coward's work.  From various books that I have read, this was a film he agonized about for quite a while before taking it on.  And the only reason why he took it on was because he didn't have to make the film adaptation exact to the original play.  So, all that does remain of Noel Coward's play is just the title and the theme.

As for the Blu-ray release, once again, this is the definitive version of the film-to-date and picture and audio quality far surpasses the original DVD version from Universal's ""The Gary Cooper Collection"".  In fact, because of the quality that Criterion Collection has put into this release, I can only hope that Universal considers the Criterion Collection on taking on some of their classic hits, because this film on Blu-ray looks absolutely fantastic!  And in Criterion Collection fashion, you also get the benefit of special features as well (which Universal was never known for in their older classic DVD releases).

But the winner for me was the inclusion of the Ben Hecht featurette but most importantly, the 1964 play of ""Design for Living"" based on Noel Coward's play.  We not only get an introduction by Coward but with all the talk of the differences between Lubitsch and Hecht's version of ""Design for Living"" compared to the original play, now viewers can watch the play and see how things differed greatly.  So, I felt that Criterion Collection including this as part of the special features was fantastic!  Similar to what the Criterion Collection did with ""12 Angry Men"" release by including the teleplay, I was quite thrilled to find out that the teleplay was included.

Overall, ""Design for a Living"" is one of the bolder Ernst Lubitsch films out there.  In fact, with the release of ""Design for a Living"", one can only hope that ""Trouble in Paradise"" will also be considered for a Blu-ray release in the near future.  But I'm very pleased that the Criterion Collection has released a Lubitsch title on Blu-ray and in keeping with the Criterion Collection's goal of focusing on important classic and contemporary films, ""Design for Living"" is a style of film with subject manner that you're not going to see in an American romantic comedy ever again.

""Design for Living"" is definitely recommended!",1323993600,8,10369,4.932525951557094
4846134,5,B005ND8812,"A disgruntled screenwriter stormed into director Ernst Lubitsch's office, threw 120 blank pieces of paper down onto his desk and said ""Here!  Give this the Lubitsch touch!""

 Obviously, that's a writer's story...but the truth is that when Lubitsch did have a good script...or even a fair one, he was, indeed, able to bring that extra special ""touch"" to the material, thereby creating a series of risque' sophisticated comedies in the 1930s and 40s that have yet to be equaled.  He was never vulgar in his ""touches,"" but employed often hilarious visual suggestions, thus making it quite clear as to what was really going on behind those closed bedroom doors.

DESIGN FOR LIVING (1933) was adapted to the screen by Ben Hecht from Noel Coward's play.  Miriam Hopkins stars as a commercial artist, who becomes smitten with both Gary Cooper, a struggling painter, and starving playwright Fredric March.  The trio decides to live together...platonically...but you can imagine how long that aspect of the relationship lasts...and the problems that it causes.  Edward Everett Horton co-stars in this witty, well-played comedy.

The Criterion Collection has released a marvelous 2-disc edition of DESIGN FOR LIVING that, aside from a new high-definition digital restoration with uncompressed monaural sound, also includes selected scene commentary by film professor William Paul, an interview with Joseph McBride on Lubitsch, plus a 1964 British television version of the play introduced by Coward and, best of all, the short sequence that Lubitsch directed for IF I HAD A MILLION (1932) featuring Charles Laughton.  It was the funniest bit in that picture.

Finally, there is a booklet containing an essay by film critic Kim Morgan.

4846135,5,B005ND8812,"Amazing Pre-Code film that I'm ecstatic to see has been selected by Criterion for this DVD release.  I've been a fan of this particular genre for over a decade and when asked by friends to pick a movie that would help introduce them to the best of the Pre-Code releases in existence and release, I almost always pick ""Design for Living"".

Everything is just spot on - excellent performances, witty banter and a most unusual (yet completely plausible) exploration of the very nature of love and commitment.  While missing some of the more naughty innuendo of the original Coward production, it still contained enough sex, sophistication and above all and at the heart of the film, a loving trio, to become one of the pinnacle films to sound the death knell on the pre-Hays freedom days and put into action the Production Code.

The bare bones of the story goes like this - girl (Gilda) meets boys (Tom & George) on a train.  The three start off as friends and I'll leave it at that.  Any more would completely ruin the plot and though you can probably guess what happens next, this is a movie that should be seen, savored and enjoyed piece by piece and scene by scene.  I must say though, if put in Gilda's situation and forced to choose between Frederic March and Gary Cooper at the height of their talents, handsomeness and charm, why not establish 'a gentleman's agreement', particularly when one of the trio is most notably not a gentleman?

Directed masterfully by Ernst Lubitsch from Ben Hecht's adaptation of Noel Coward's play, this is definitely more than a light, screwball comedy.  It's one of the best, most sophisticated and unconventional romances you'll ever see on screen. Even for a modern audience, the theme is not outdated, which just goes to show how ahead of the curve many Pre-Code films were even when seen through our 21st century eyes.  One has to wonder just how many more gems such as this we might have gotten, had the Code not crashed the party.",1321920000,20,1974,4.662824207492795
4846136,5,B005ND8812,"**EDIT 12-6-11** Overall, I'll say that Criterion did a great job on the restoration and transfer of this 1933 classic. I would describe the picture quality as very good, not perfect, but very good. Signs of aging are still evident throughout the film (mainly vertically running scratches), but not to the extent of distracting or taking away from the viewing experience. Quality-wise, this is the clearest, most crisp version of this film that I have viewed.

Based on the Broadway hit by legendary playwright Nol Coward, Design for Living is an excellent Pre-Code comedy from the always daring Paramount Pictures. Directed by the great Ernst Lubitsch, the film provides us with a refreshing look at the way American films were made before being heavily censored by the enforcement of the Hays Code in 1934. With the help of a risqu script from Hollywood veteran Ben Hecht, the director adds his famous ""Lubitsch touch"" to give us a very witty and fluid movie starring three of the biggest stars of the period. Gary Cooper, Fredric March and Miriam Hopkins have great chemistry together and really help to convey the message of the filmmakers - you only live once so do what makes you happy, regardless of how others view you.

In its day, Design for Living was very controversial for two reasons. The first and most obvious reason being the very risqu plot involving a mnage--trois relationship between three young Americans living in Paris. This film really took a jab at the morals and virtues that certain groups, namely the Legion of Decency, were trying to infuse back into American cinema. The second reason is that many people, including Nol Coward, were upset that screenwriter Ben Hecht retained only one line from the original play. Whether true or false, it's believed he did this in part to remove the homosexual context present in Coward's play, fearing that this even more controversial subject of the day would inevitably lead to the film being heavily censored, if it was ever played at all.

As always, I will provide only a brief description of the plot itself, as I don't want to ruin the movie for someone who hasn't seen it. The film opens as two friends, playwright Tom (March) and artist George (Cooper), are traveling by train to Paris. While sleeping, they are joined in their compartment by a beautiful young stranger, Gilda (Hopkins). Gilda, who is an artist herself, commences to draw a humorously accurate caricature of the sleeping pair, both of whom are snoring with their mouths wide open and feet propped up. The drawing ends up being the icebreaker for the trio, and after some initial criticisms, they quickly become friends. From here two major problems arise. First, Gilda has a wealthy suitor named Max (played by the wonderful Edward Everett Horton) who has been courting her for five years. Secondly, both Tom and George fall in love with Gilda while being totally unaware of each other's feelings for her. One fateful day, immediately after the friends find out they're in love with the same woman, Gilda phones to say she's coming over. After her arrival, Gilda confesses that she loves both men equally, therefore she can't decide between them. Being the crafty woman she is, Gilda proposes an arrangement to the two unsuspecting men - a ""gentleman's"" agreement allowing her to be with both of them. After a discussion, the newly formed group decides on one major clause in the agreement, no sex. Obviously this arrangement has the potential for causing some major problems, and well... it does. Everything I just revealed to you happens very early in the movie so there are many things left unspoiled. I hope you enjoy it as much as I have over the years.

As I stated earlier, Design for Living did not sit very well with many people upon its initial release. On this note, I feel like I should clarify something. Just because something was controversial 80 years ago does not mean it will shock audiences today. This movie is fairly tame by today's standards, but in 1933 Hollywood its subject matter was eye-opening, very much so to film censorship advocates. Design for Living, along with Barbara Stanwyck's Baby Face, were two of the final straws that led to the Hays Code being actively enforced in 1934, severely limiting the content of American films until the late 1960's. After the code was enforced, Design for Living was banned by the Legion of Decency and denied a Production Code Administration certification, leading to the film being shelved and almost forgotten for several decades.

4846137,5,B005ND8812,"One of the most delectable m&eacute;nage-trois in the history of cinema, the pairing of Fredric March, Gary Cooper and the GLORIOUS Miriam Hopkins for this hilarious 1933 romantic comedy was truly inspired and is really hard to top, even today.  Sadly, this cannot be purchased except for within a collection of Gary Cooper hits, so it may not be an easily accessible film (I saw it on TCM and have locked it only my DVR) but if you can get your hands on it (local library maybe) I strongly suggest you take the time to see it.

The film tells of two American men, playwright Tom Chambers and painter George Curtis, who meet and fall for Gilda while on a train.  The three soon move into the same Paris flat and start a strange yet charmingly workable relationship (no touchy-touchy).  The relationship is tested when each man tries to get exclusive rites to Gilda's affections, and when the intrusive (well-meaning) Max Plunkett makes his feelings for Gilda and her situation clear, things begin to get dicey.

For me, this is just delightful from start to finish.  I think I mentioned this when reviewing `Trouble in Paradise'.  Miriam Hopkins did three films basically back-to-back with director Ernst Lubitsch, and this is one of the best.  My favorite is still `The Smiling Lieutenant', but this one sports Hopkins shining moment.  It is the most universally sound, especially in the comedic department.  It has the gags and the intellectual banter down to a science.

Such a blessed pairing across the board.

Of the two leading men, my vote goes to March, who is just stunning here.  It is nice to see Cooper take on a role that was very far removed from what he was used to, but he does at times feel a little out of place.  March is perfection here, truly outstanding.  He matches Miriam and really provides her with a worthy suiter, a believably charming lover.  Edward Everett Horton is also really well used here, funny and annoying, but in a good way.

It works.

The relationship displayed here was sure to stir up some controversy.  It is a bit risqu&eacute; for the time it was released, but Lubitsch was always good for that.  If you want some cheeky fun you really can't do much better than this one.  I really wish it had a separate DVD release.  Maybe soon.

The movie is famously based on the stage play of the same name by famed British actor/screenwriter/playwright/songwriter/bon vivant Noel Coward, (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Blithe-Spirit/dp/B00008YNFZ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Blithe Spirit </a>).

The play was produced and directed by Ernst Lubitsch, perhaps the Hollywood filmmaker with the lightest touch of all time, (TROUBLE IN PARADISE).  Nazi Germany's loss.  Hollywood's gain.  Lubitsch was particularly noted for ""the Lubitsch touch,"" which involved split second timing, and a bubbling, buoyant erotic wit.  In those days before the promulgation of the blue-nose repressive Hays Code, Lubitsch was able to sneak quite a bit of innuendo into his films.  This one and TROUBLE IN PARADISE were probably his greatest achievements in this regard.  And, oddly enough, or perhaps not so oddly, I have recently seen or re-seen four of Lubitsch's pictures, and all four center around romantic triangles, two of each flavor.  Well, of course, this marvelous film is a very light confection, perhaps a bit silly and trivial, but hey, it's the great Lubitsch, and who's counting?",1359676800,2,3529,6.338912133891213

Ahhh the perils of writing negative reviews.  I will be quite suprised if this review doesn't receive more negative votes than positive ones.  I was first turned on to Ernst Lubitsch by chance.  My wife and I rented Trouble in Paradise and thought it was absolutely brilliant.  We loved the story, the characters, the pacing....  Everything.

Naturally, we went searching for more.  When I read another Lubitsch film would be given the Criterion treatment, I was over the moon with excitement.  I couldn't wait to get my hands on this blu ray.  I had read reviews that it was not as strong as Trouble in Paradise, but was still a very good pre-code movie and considered very risque for its' time. So risque in fact, it was  actually cited as one of the last movies made that inspired the Hayes code being put into effect.  Sounds great to me.  Couldn't wait to see it.

Beginning with that last point, I think this movie is still quite risque today.  The idea of a woman openly choosing to live with two men is still not something many folks would feel comfortable with, so I would respectfully disagree with those saying this movie may be tame by today's standards.  Even today, this is defintiely considered a rather taboo concept.

But the risque nature of this film is not the problem for me.  (If anything, I rather like movies that throw stereotypes on their head and challenge the viewer's own level of comfort).  The problem is the characters have absolutely no moral compass whatsoever, making them all thoroughly unlikable.  Each one literally betrays the other time and time again as the love triangle spirals out of control; yet throughout it all they mostly maintain their jovial attitudes towards each other.

""One guy is leaving for Britain?  No worries, I'll just steal off with the other even though I said I wouldn't.  The other comes back while the first one is away?  No worries, I'll just take off with the other guy even though I committed to the first one.  Ha ha ha...  How funny....  Oh what's this?  She betrayed us both while we were busy screwing each other over?  Oh well, let's have a few drinks and laugh it off together.  Whaddya say there sport""?

I'm sorry.  But that's not endearing, cute, spicey, savvy, anything of that nature.  It's trampy, deceitful, disloyal and ugly of ALL of them.  And therein lies my problem with Design For Living.  It's trying to deal with a risque subject in a mostly comedic/light hearted way, but presenting characters that have no backbone and loyalty to each other.  I KNOW some will roll their eyes with that assessment, and that's OK.  ""Dislike"" my review as you please.  But coming from someone who loved Trouble in Paradise and was extremely excited to experience this movie, I would highly recommend you rent Design For Living before committing to a purchase.

Grade for the subject matter and being willing to present it to an audience in a relatively uncompromising way = A+

Grade for the characters and how they interact with each other = F -",1342224000,17,3090,4.692164179104478
4846150,3,B005ND8812,"Noel Coward, at least in the New York theater scene, is having something of another revival which prompted me to take a second, or maybe third look, at his work. No question he had a serious sense of plot and language when it came to writing ""manner"" plays addressing ""high society (or what passed for high society in his day),"" a look at that society from one who came to appreciate its frills and follies  from a personal past of barely rubbing two nickels together. That is the case here with the film adaptation of the somewhat autobiographical sketch play, Design for Living (along some material help from his coming up from obscurity friends, the actors Lunt and Fontaine).

As with many adaptations from books or plays the relationship to the original source can be, well, attenuated as it is here, at least according to Mr. Coward, on the use of dialogue. But the general plot outline is similar- two guys, two artsy guys (one Gary Cooper who passes for the Midwestern All-American boy complete with ah shuck) and a world-weary gal get all balled up in a threesome, a love triangle, comedic or not, and for a while nobody could win. It all gets sorted out by the end but not before what passed for 1930s humor, including deadpan and slapstick humor, got a workout. This one is probably too tame for today's audiences having seen every kind of social possibility on the screen by now but in the 1930s this was, and rightly so I think, regarded as sophisticated comedy, and certainly the subject matter raised eyebrows. Not the best Coward (or Cooper and March) but interesting.",1336608000,5,1584,4.673835125448028
4846151,4,B005ND8812,"This adaptation of a Noel Coward play features three classic stars at the top of their game.  Gary Cooper is George Curtis, a struggling painter.  Fredric March is Tom Chambers, a playwright having an equally difficult time and George's best friend.  While asleep on a train in Paris, they are joined by Gilda (with a hard ""G"") played by a devilishly good Miriam Hopkins.  When the boys wake up, they are immediately smitten by Gilda and her with them.  After a dalliance with each man, the relationship changes going well beyond flirtation.

Eventually they decide that since they are so fond of each other, they should all cohabitate but change their relationship to a non-sexual one.  While this idea of a platonic friendship might sound like a good idea then, everyone knows it won't work out.  When Gilda decides to stick with George, Tom heads to London where he becomes highly successful, as does George back in Paris.  When Tom returns to see his friend, he finds Gilda and one thing leads to another.  After a brief fight, Gilda decides to leave them both as she can't make up her mind.  She marries instead her wealthy boss (Edward Everett Horton).

At a cocktail party hosted by Max (Horton), George and Tom return unexpectedly and renew their forgotten feelings.  Screenwriter Ben Hecht under the direction of Ernst Lubitsch change the story considerably from the original play, removing the subtle homosexual vibe intended by Coward.  The ""mnage a trois"" as it was, was controversial at the time but preceded the more aggressive censorship that followed a few years later.  While the film is not at all graphic of course, it is filled with charmingly humorous bedroom innuendo.

The Blu ray version is in 1080p with a 1.33:1 aspect ratio.  While some clean up is evident, the print has some hits and misses.  It is certainly watchable.  The audio is a LPCM mono.  With the exception of a pop here and there, it is just fine.",1331683200,2,1937,4.75975975975976
4846152,5,B005ND8812,"Design for Living is a witty little number produced and directed by the incomparable Ernst Lubitsch, written by Ben Hecht, based on a play by Noel Coward (okay, very loosely based), and starring Gary Cooper, Fredric March and Miriam Hopkins at the ultimate height of their talent and physical beauty. There isn't much of a plot other than a love triangle where best friends fall in love with the same woman, who unfortunately cannot seem to choose between the two. Gary Cooper was so incredibly beautiful it's easy to loose sight of what a marvelous actor he was, and completely underutilized in the comedy genre. Fredric March, although better known as a dramatic actor, thankfully dabbled more frequently into comedies, such as his terrific satire with Carole Lombard in Nothing Sacred. The surprising revelation, however, was the brilliant Miriam Hopkins. She had the most difficult role to conquer, having to continually portray the conflicted feelings of her character without appearing ditzy, mean, or self-absorbed. The supporting cast, including Edward Everett Horton, Franklin Pangborn, and Jane Darwell, are all a lot of silly fun and add substantially to the overall feeling of joie de vivre. This film is sexy, frothy, romantic, witty, and charming. Thankfully Lubitsch, well-known for his sophisticated film making style, was able to make this delight prior to the enforcement of the production code. Sublime!",1329350400,3,1422,5.2687224669603525
4846153,4,B005ND8812,"I had never heard of DESIGN FOR LIVING but a film starring a young Gary Cooper, Frederic Marsh and Miriam Hopkins directed by Ernst Lubitsch and written by Ben Hecht from a Noel Coward play has to be a class act all the way. Although the film starts to run out of steam near the end, it is a pure joy to watch.

To truly appreciate DESIGN FOR LIVING, you have to put away your modern sensibilities and step back into the early 1930's. Tame but today's standards, DESIGN FOR LIVING must have shocked more than a handful of people in 1933. This was pre-Hays code Hollywood when a few liberties could still be taken in a story about two men in love with the same woman.

Gilda Farrell, played by Miriam Hopkins, is a pretty and progressive young career woman. She's as far from the typical 1930's American girl as she can be. The film is set in Paris, where life was even more open. Gilda has lived and morals and rules are for other people. She meets Tom Chambers, a struggling playwright, played by Frederic March and George Curtis, a starving artist, portrayed by a young and dashing Gary Cooper. Tom and George share a crumbling apartment and both struggle to find fame.

Worlds collide when Tom and George realize they both are in love with Gilda and both have ""made love"" to Gilda. The word ""sex"" and ""making love"" are actually used in a 1930's film. How shocking! Gilda loves them both and the only option is for the men to come to a ""gentlemen's aggreement"" regarding her. Everything will be strictly platonic as the three share the apartment and Gilda works her magic to advance Tom and George's careers. Needless to say, things are never that simple and here is the fun of the story.

Of course, it doesn't seem so shocking by our standards to have two single men living with a woman nor is it unusual to have a young lady be a free spirit in all senses of the word. It seems somewhat innocent in today's Hollywood but the film must have caused a stir in 1933 with Miriam Hopkins showing her legs and with her plunging neckline. Of course, her ""come hither"" look and ""damsel in distress"" personality only add to the charm.

I watched the CRITERION version. Of course, CRITERION never disappoints and is worth the extra cost. The film looks clean and crisp like it must have been at its premiere.
There is such a charm in old films. Hang a sign written in French, get a couple of French speaking actors as extras and show a quick generic establishing shot of the Eiffel Tower and you're in Paris without ever having to leave a Hollywood soundstage.

Also starring is character actor Edward Everett Horton as Max Plunkett. It's clear Max is in love with Miriam but she only allows him to be her friend and protector - well, until much later. I always remember Horton as an older actor in the 1950's. His distinctive voice always stands out. He must have been in his late 40's in DESIGN FOR LIVING. There is a scene where he is sitting in a theater and he looks heavily made-up. He looks like a silent screens star with the thick make-up. It made me wonder why this was done. Both Cooper and March look ""natural"" in the film. Of course, Hopkins is ""dolled up"" in true 1930's fashion.

As for the movie losing steam, it's a fun and light-hearted film until Gilda decides she was to be a responsible and respectable woman. You have to see what happens next.

It's fun to step back in time to another era and imagine how audiences would have reacted to this film. Watching a  trio of three actors who had big careers ahead of them in early roles has a nostalgic film. Gary Cooper will always be ruggedly handsome. Miriam Hopkins will always be frozen in time with her 1930's clothes and hair. Forget the modern day and step back in time and enjoy a forgotten gem.",1327449600,6,3764,4.435600578871201

4846156,5,B005ND8812,"There is something to be said for an era that could produce a film like this. The decade of the 1930s gets a bad press, much deserved. Perhaps, if it had appointed Ernst Lubitsch as its official publicist, we would have better memories. But we'll take these couple of hours and cherish them.

'Design For Living' is a comedy that plays with everything: gender roles; being an artist; social climbing; business; sex... oh, and especially the audience. The commentary/interviews included with this Criterion issue offer a good deal of insight into just how clever Lubitsch was as a filmmaker. My only quibble is with critics who think this particular 'design for living' - one woman, two men - is anything of the sort. It is facile to suggest we are meant to conclude from the story that people should have what they desire, rather than submit to social convention. Anyone can make a play along those lines, and many have. This film, on the contrary, sends up the whole idea of constructing a design for living, self-indulgent, self-controlled, or otherwise. Enjoy the situations, enjoy the acting, enjoy the wit and humour, enjoy the games - all of which will stimulate enough grey matter to have you thinking long after the curtain falls - but don't look for a philosophy lesson.

The restored print used here is superb. It is hard to believe its age. The cast is wonderful. Miriam Hopkins (who appears in two other splendid Lubitsch films, 'The Smiling Lieutenant' and 'Trouble in Paradise') could generate the power supply for a small town. She shimmers in this part. Sexy and smart, she attracts the amour of two men (if you exclude the whole male audience) without ever submitting or pouting or simpering. There is a certain teflon quality to her rapidity of mind and movement that seems to deflect their advances onto each other and back onto themselves, and yet the character is never cold or aloof. Something magical is achieved in the characterisation and Hopkins' performance. Gary Cooper does very well in a role somewhat outside his usual range. Frederic Marsh is truly very funny. Edward Everett Horton plays to his strengths, and they, too, are considerable.",1325980800,5,2171,4.880758807588076
