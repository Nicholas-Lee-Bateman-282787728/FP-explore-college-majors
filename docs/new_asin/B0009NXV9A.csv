8063678,5,B0009NXV9A,"I bought this DVD for my sister and brother-in-law when I found out they had a little one on the way.  As a current Aggie student, nothing would make me happier and prouder than to teach my little niece about Texas A&M and the Aggie Spirit!  The movie is cute, and perhaps a little obnoxious, but it is perfect for ""brain-washing"" your nephews, nieces, children, etc. and making them Aggie fans for life!",1370822400,,404,4.52054794520548
8063679,3,B0009NXV9A,"I thought the Longhorn Baby DVD was better - and I'm an Aggie.  It wasn't bad, but I thought there needed to be more focus on A&M traditions - Bonfire, Muster, Big Event, Replant.  Reveille and 12th Man were included, but more would have been better.",1179273600,,250,4.413043478260869
8063680,5,B0009NXV9A,"It's interesting how all people writing reviews of this book degrade A&M and the principles Aggies stand for. A&M is simply a university built on strong bonds and tradition. A&M has more internationally known tradition than any school in the country. Also, people who demean A&M are obviously shallow and weak individuals attempting to humiliate a seemingly easy prey. I can confidently say that those of us lucky enough to have attended this great university couldn't care less about the derogatory comments by those who are most likely working for more than one Aggie. Therefore, enjoy your pitiful life as a disillusioned inferior.",1138838400,20,634,5.165048543689321
8063681,3,B0009NXV9A,"To be fair, I'm not an Aggie.  But I have to say this DVD gave me a chuckle and you have to give the Texas A&M fans who created it an ""A"" for effort.  For those of you who think Texas A&M is a cult which starts at infancy, you would be correct.  But even if you aren't an Aggie fan, this DVD will leave you smiling (although you may need some Maalox to deal with all the A&M self promotion).",1138406400,,391,3.802469135802469
