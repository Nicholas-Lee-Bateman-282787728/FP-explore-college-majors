3871350,5,B00280QNKG,"Hey Bewitched Fans get ready for the Eighth and Final Season of Bewitched coming out this July.  This may be the last season of Bewitched, but you sure do not want to miss this extra ordinary last season.  This season has 26 more magical episodes including the 7 story arch of Darrin and Sam in Europe, Tabitha entering the second grade and other adventures involving the Stephens family.  The season kicks off when Darrin and Samantha arrive in London, England and Sam is sent back to the 16th century for setting free a warlock who was imprisoned in a painting.  While there, Darrin and Endora must rescue Samantha before she gets beheaded by King Henry VIII.  Also they travel to Italy, France and Scotland.  Sam learns that the legendary Loch Ness Monster is none other than a warlock named Bruce who ages ago transformed the monster into the creature for bothering Serena.  Next stop is Italy, where we learn Esmeralda was the one who made the Tower of Pisa lean and then we must do as the Romans do in ""Bewitched, Bothered, and Baldoni"" where Endora zaps statues into real life.  Paris is quite fun when Maurice sends Darrin atop the Eiffel Tower. The final stop in the European Business trip is the spooky Halloween Episode called ""The Ghost who made a Spectre of himself"".  This episode will have you rolling on the floor laughing as Louise, Larry, Samantha and Darrin all get heckled by a Ghost!

In ""TV or Not TV"", Tabitha gets infuriated when she sees the Punch and Judy show and condemns Punch for hitting the puppet Judy.  She pops in on the show and the producers want to keep her as a guest, but Darrin and Samantha do not want their daughter at such a young age on the show. In another episode, Maurice and Samantha come down with a plague.  Moving on, Darrin chases Hansel and Gretel around in episode 238.  The last few episodes of 1971 will have viewers laughing until they cry especially in ""The Warlock in the Gray Flannel Suit"", because the lines between Larry and Alfonzo are hysterical.  In ""Adam, Warlock or Washout"" we see a test on Adam similar to an earlier episode back in Season 3 where the high witches test Adam's powers.  So if you want to find out if he is a warlock you must purchase this great season.

The episodes get more funny when the 1972 episodes appear.  Esmeralda gets in a bit of trouble when she sits for some children who think she has cracked her mind in ""Samantha's Magic Sitter"". Another episode that viewers really like is the one where Sam develops a condition that makes her weigh over 500 lbs., so we bring in the one and only Dr. Bombay who cures her to no avail only causing her to be the opposite light as air.  But, don't fret because cousin Serena returns in this Season to bring more laughter especially in ""Serena's Richcraft"" where she falls for a rich man and then again in ""Serena's Youth Pill"" where she gives Larry Tate a pill that restores his youth, but without some side-effects.  In ""Samantha on Thin Ice"", Darrin challenges both Tabitha and Samantha to learn to skate the mortal way.  Little does Darrin know that Endora makes Tabitha a prodigy and Canadian Olympic figure skater Robert Paul guest stars in this episode. (This was when the Winter and Summer Olympics were in the same year).  The last historical figure we see in the series is George Washington.  He and Martha make appearances in a two part episode where Esmeralda is helping Tabitha on her homework and accidentally sneezes up our forefather.  The authorities also find out Tabitha is not attending school and Mrs. Peabody, a busybody, gets the pleasure or burden of being Tabitha's second grade teacher in a few episodes.  The last episode is ""The Truth, Nothing but the Truth, So Help Me, Sam"" in which Endora up to her clever tricks puts a hex on Darrin's gift for Sam which makes every mortal tell the truth while around it. This, however, proves to be more good than harm.  He not only wins the clients account, but shows once again that his love for Samantha is for real, forever and they live happily ever after.  What's a meddling mother-in-law to do?

This may be the last season of Bewitched, but the show will go down in history as being the longest and funniest of the supernatural themed comedies of the 1960's and 1970's.  ABC had planned a 9th season for Bewitched, but Elizabeth Montgomery decided after 8 long years to leave the show while it was still popular.  The only thing viewers will miss this season is that Darrin's parents are not present, Mr. and Mrs. Kravitz are no where to be seen, however, they are spoken of, and a few other characters like Uncle Arthur are not present as well.

So Bewitched Fans get ready, get set, and GO get Bewitched: The complete 8th and Final Season coming this July!! You won't want to miss out on the last season to put in your collection!",1241740800,38,4838,4.559537572254335
3871351,3,B00280QNKG,"Although an eight year run is considered successful for any television show by today or yesterday's standards, the eighth and final season of Bewitched missed the mark on several points.

First, it was clearly obvious that missing were cast regulars Gladys and Abner Kravitz.  They were, however, mentioned in two episodes but never seen.  Also absent was beloved Uncle Arther as Paul Lynde was busy with his own variety show.

Esmerelda, Doc Bombay, Daddy and Serena made a few appearances but not nearly enough if you ask me.  Instead, a slurry of guest stars swept the canvas in what appeared to be re-cycled story lines from seasons passed.  A couple of original episodes aired that seeemed fun but still lost steam as Liz Montgomery had expressed a lack of interest in coming back for an eighth season.  That seemed to come through in some of her scences in this final homage to one of the most original sitcoms in American broadcast history.

All in all, for the die hard fan, it is a must for your collection.  Bewitched - The Complete Eighth and Final Season hits stores on DVD July 14th, 2009.  Happy twitching!",1241740800,9,1120,4.72680412371134
3871352,1,B00280QNKG,"The series was good. The end was not.  In the last season, they ran out ideas, or steam, or whatever. The ""magic"" was all gone. It didn't help that Ms Montgomery and her producer husband were splitting up.
Apparently Ms Montgomery had tried to get out of this season as she felt that the quality of the program had already declined. Her sarcastic attitude this season is thinly veiled. Such a drastic change from the early episodes where she was a woman so deeply in love with her husband, they would overcome any obstacle together.
Like many fans, I did not feel the on screen chemistry between Dick Sargent and Ms Montgomery was very good. Unfortunately, Dick York had some health problems and was asked to leave the show as he had become unreliable.",1480291200,4,752,4.611940298507463

3871355,4,B00280QNKG,This is one of my favorite shows ever. I just love Elizabeth Montgomery so much. I gladly bought all 8 seasons because watching these old episodes  always brings me joy. I just wish Dick York hadn't had those back issues and could've stuck around for the entire series.

3871359,4,B00280QNKG,I think the writers of the show made Samantha look weak when in confrontation with another witch or warlock. For instance Samantha's powers are strong enough to release the warlock from the painting but not strong enough to go a few rounds with the witch malvina win or lose.,1466553600,,275,4.63265306122449

3871400,3,B00280QNKG,"It's interesting that, for this season, the manufacturers chose to picture the ""old"" Darrin instead of the new, even though he's not in this season!  This season isn't bad, but... it's very clear that the cast knew that it was ""over.""  Elizabeth Montgomery (Samantha) really acts like a woman who knows she doesn't have to put up with her ""husband"" very much longer, as opposed to the dewy, ""whatever you say darling"" approach of the previous seasons.  Budget must have been low, as hardly any of the usual guest-stars appear in this season - no Kravitzes, almost none of Samantha's relatives.  ""Serena"" is used several times (obviously to save money), and Esmeralda appears fairly often; even Endora is conspicuously absent.  It's also clear that the child actor chosen for Adam (the youngest child) turned out to be a dud - so even though, early in the season, there's an effort to show that Adam in fact has powers, that is never exploited (because presumably he simply could not act).  Finally, the season simply recycles a bunch of scripts from earlier seasons.  The season is fine if you want to just round out your collection, but it's a bit of ""going out with a whimper.""",1397347200,2,1179,4.75

Irrespective of the various criticisms made of this final season (and I won't debate them), I think the final season is still worth having, simply because little can match the chemistry, the humor or the magic that we've come to enjoy with 'Bewitched'.",1359072000,,627,5.087378640776699

The ratings were good enough to go to season eight,ABC had actually signed them on for four years after season five but only three were produced. Even if the cast was showing signs of age they had a good time together. The publicity stills of Montgomery and Sargent look like they are very happy with each other. That,s hard to fake. Also they still kept in touch as good friends after series ended. Her friendship with Dick York was not like her friendship with Sargent. They died six months apart of cancer how sad I love them both and can't believe they are gone. Sam and Darren look great in the eight season I like Samantha's straight hair too.",1348790400,2,867,4.325153374233129
3871431,5,B00280QNKG,The final 8th season has completed my collection of Bewitched. This was my favorite as a kid and still is. I like watching them when crafting or eatting lunch. Picking them up used makes it affordable.,1336521600,,201,4.611111111111111
3871432,4,B00280QNKG,"I grew up loving BEWITCHED, and so have been enchanted to finally watch them again on DVD decades later. So I watched through the first 6 seasons, but because of some negative Amazon reviews, particularly about season 8, I was hesitant to buy seasons 7 and 8. Finally I took the plunge and I'm very glad I did! I like Dick Sargent fine as Darran, and I think season 7 was his high point in the series. Last week I just finished watching season 8 and sure, it's not as good as some earlier seasons, but overall I still enjoyed it a lot. And sure, by season 8 the writers were often reworking episodes from earlier seasons, but usually the result was still good quality. And sure, season 8 had several episodes that were clunkers, yet a few season 8 episodes are actually among my favorites of the entire series, particularly ""Samantha's Magic Sitter"" (a funny Esmerelda story), ""The Eight-Year Witch"" (mainly because I'm a Julie Newmar fan), ""Serena's Youth Pill"" (funny to see Larry Tate as a kid), and ""George Washington Zapped Here, Part 1"" (Will Geer is great as Washington). The picture and sound quality of these DVDs is very good, and is in full screen at 1.33:1. The show was filmed in color after season 2. The only bonus feature on the DVDs is previews of other DVD sets.

And like some BEWITCHED fans, I also much prefer seeing Samantha in the later seasons as more confident, sexy, and independent. In fact, it's hard for me to watch season one because there Samantha is nauseatingly submissive and subservient to Darran, which makes little sense when you consider that Samantha could perform magic and had been alive for centuries, while Darran was an approximately 30-year-old non-magical mortal. By the way, while I've been re-watching BEWITCHED I've greatly enjoyed the companion book&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bewitched-Forever-40th-Anniversary-Edition/dp/1930819404/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bewitched Forever: 40th Anniversary Edition</a>&nbsp;by Herbie J. Pilato, which is both fascinating and helpful.

It's too bad that the final episode was not written as some sort of series finale, but at that point they didn't know that they weren't going to do a season 9. So the great series just ends without fanfare in the 254th episode, and there were never any later reunion shows even though ABC for years begged Elizabeth Montgomery and crew to come back and make a TV movie of BEWITCHED. Producer William Asher explained that they had said all they had to say in the series, so there was no point in a reunion movie. At any rate, don't listen to the negative reviews about season 8. (Some people are totally negative about seasons 6, 7, AND 8 because they can't stand the later Darran, which I think is unfair.) Go ahead - get season 8 and enjoy it as I did.",1332028800,5,2826,4.972515856236787

3871435,1,B00280QNKG,"My wife and I have all eight years of Bewitched, and have enjoyed the first seven years immensely.  But something happened between years 7 and 8...you could see the decline in year 7, but in year 8 the wheels come completely off the bus.  The entire year consists of various shades of awful, but the scenes that purported to be shot in Europe are absolutely dreadful.  Painful to watch.

It is hard to pin down why: the same writers (Jurist, et al.) and Bill Asher directs but something is horribly wrong: Sam spends about 90% of the time screwing her face into the same cartoonish faces, and says ""Well?"" about a million times.  Poor Dick Sargeant looks absolutely lost, and sets new standards for ineptitude.  The writing is horrible, the plots are lame, and the performances match them in just being plain BAD.

It's one thing if Betwitched hadn't been so good for so long, but there is such a chasm between years 7 and 8 that there MUST have been something going on within the crew for the same bunch of people to create something so lousy.  Tabitha of course is not very good, but that can't be the only reason.  Adam is about as intelligent and charismatic as a wooden manikin and his cuteness cannot save him.

But the usual stars just don't have it.  Period.  I challenge ANYONE to watch the ""European segments"" of episodes 1-6 (or however many there were) without wincing.  Just plain awful.

Don't order this year, it's worse than watching your favorite 70s rock group play a Casino in 2011.  Remember Sam and Darrin and Larry the way they were--Year 8 is a train wreck that goes on and on and on....",1311724800,8,1610,4.522491349480969

Bewitched is a refreshing break from those shows when TV sitcoms started dealing with racy issues.  Elizabeth Montgomery shines and Agnes Morehead sparkles! During the 8th season, producers and writers started re-visiting old storylines from previous seasons; but gave them a new twist.  There are  two episodes where Esmerelda conjures up George and Martha Washington.  In these two episodes, George was arrested for inciting a riot.  Aunt Clara in previous years had conjured up Ben Franklin and the George Washington episodes followed the same theme with Ben getting arrested, also.  All in all, it never gets old; Bewitched is a refreshing break from todays sitcoms when you have to send your children out of the room!",1266624000,3,861,5.151079136690647

3871440,5,B00280QNKG,"I own all eight seasons of betwitched on DVD, and I love them all.  I almost didn't purchase season 8 because some fans said they were disappointed, that the cast didn't seem ""into the show"" and that there were some repeated episodes.  However, I completely disagree on a couple of things.  I think the cast was very much into the show and some of the episodes were funnier than previous seasons.  Im' VERY glad I own season 8 because I've gotten some pretty good LOL and ROFL from some of these episodes.  A couple of my favorites are on disc 4, the 2 part adventure of George Washington, and the episode about The Truth, nothing but the Truth....

If you love bewitched, and you have some of the (if not all) other seasons, you may want to consider this season as part of your collection.  I'm glad I did.  ENJOY!  As Samantha always says, ""Well?"".

As an addendum to this review, I finished the Eighth season last night, and I went back to Season 1 as a comparison.  I agree with other reviewers here, in that what a transformation for Samantha to go from a ""do-good"" housewife who wore house ""dresses"" to do housework  -- and to evolve into to a swanky and hip housewife in seasons 7 and 8 with hip huggers, low hip belts, more fit and trim, more confidence, and swagger than in the ""wholesome"" earlier seasons -- and she looked even better than 8 years earlier!!!!

Don't get me wrong, I love all of the seasons, but Samantha in the 7th AND 8th seasons was in my opinion at her best.  She looked happier, more confident, and was really coming into her own with her character evolution.  Talk about a bravo and two thumbs up!  I still can't believe this amazingly talented FUNNY actress never won any ""TV Show awards"".  That doesn't make any sense.  And Endora?  Please!  Who couldn't/wouldn't give her an award every season?  My opinion?  The show was way ahead of it's time, and is still HUGELY popular today.

I'm glad I got all 8 seasons instead of waiting for some reruns on syndication which is spotty at best.  If you love this show, GET THIS COLLECTION!",1264809600,6,2065,4.459893048128342

3871444,3,B00280QNKG,"Probably my favorite classic show of all time, Bewitched has withstood the test of time. It's one of the few shows that has managed to accomplish this.  All the great comedies have their day, and yes, they do have their bad ones right? No Aunt Clara (Marion Lorne), No real Darrin Stephens and of course no Alice Pearce (Gladys Kravitz). No offense to fans of the series, but when York died, the series should have died with it. Sargent is the epitomy of wooden, or should I say, robotic acting. I have no really good things to say about him, he just does not mesh well with Montgomery. Sargent started his new character when York was suffering from a chronic back ailment and had to leave the show at the end of Season 5. I just don't have any sympathy or fuzzy feeling with Sargent. On top of that, I really could care less when Endora whacks him with a spell! Sometimes I wish he would stay cursed and never to return! I know, I'm being bit harsh on Sargent, but he really did not mesh well with Montgomery and their marriage seemed staged when he took over. Anyway.

As with Season 7, William Asher certainly had his work cut out for him, and he obviously ran out of ideas as this collection as there are only 28 episodes compared to the 35+ for the first few seasons. Season 8 kicks off with an unusual zealous eight-part story of Sam and Darrin going on vacation in Europe. There are some interesting segments and Montgomery and Moorehead manage to pull it off and still make the show fun.

Season 8 unfortunately is missing some of the wonderful characters from past seasons. As always, the lack of no Aunt Clara or the real Gladys Kravitz makes Season 7 all that more depressing. In fact, the Kravitz's are only mentioned in passing. Major bummer. And where the heck is Sam's zany Uncle Arthur? Man, I'm getting teary eyed! Well, thankfully it's not all a loss as we still got (David White) Larry Tate, (Barnard Fox) Dr. Bombay and (Endora) Agnes Moorehead still as the helm of the series and a growing up (Erin Murphy) Tabitha is still a welcome piece to the series. She even now has a warlock brother thrown into the mix.  One thing I do appreciate is the improvement in the special effects that continues to get better as technology obviously get better, each season it just looks better to see the action on-screen and Asher is getting that down brilliantly.

All in all, there is really nothing really supremely memorable about this season. I did like some of the episodes, but fans will noticed, much of the stories from the first few seasons are back. Not saying it's a bad thing, but Asher is obviously running out of ideas bringing back stories from past shows.

So what do we got here for Season 8? Is it worth a pickup? I'm going to say if you're a fan of the show, it's probably a no brainer to pick this season up. Without question, Montgomery still pulls off being the star of the show and she still is a genius when she plays her half-witted cousin Sabrina. There are some recycled stories and idea, and yes there is no loveable Darrin, no Aunt Clara, no Uncle Arthur, but there is just enough magic left to warrant a purchase.",1255996800,5,3150,4.450606585788561

3871447,5,B00280QNKG,"""Bewitched - Season 8,"" concluded one of the most popular sitcoms in television history and placed the story of a housewife witch and her magical marriage to a mortal in the hearts of millions of devoted fans.  This eighth and final season includes lots of great vacation episodes that have our beloved Samantha and Darrin visiting Europe and encountering everything from King Henry The Eighth to The Loch Ness Monster!  I personally would have loved for ""Bewitched"" to have continued on for several more seasons, but Elizabeth Montgomery, as well as the show's directors and writers, had all become tired and somewhat bored with the show's premise.  Here is a listing of the 26 Episodes included:

Bewitched - Season 8 - 1971-72

01- How Not To Lose Your Head To King Henry VIII (Part 1)- Samantha and Darrin are vacationing in England when Sam makes the error of freeing a warlock who has been trapped by a jealous witch in a painting at the Tower of London. The witch instantly appears and sends Samantha back to the 16th century, where she meets Henry VIII and his penchant for wives.

02- How Not To Lose Your Head To King Henry VIII (Part 2)- Back in the 16th century, Darrin must try to rescue a Samantha who has no powers or memory of him. Things get worse when he's thrown in the dungeon and is scheduled to be beheaded.

03- Samantha and The Loch Ness Monster- In Inverness, Scotland, Sam and Darrin encounter the Loch Ness Monster, who turns out to be a warlock Serena transformed a couple decades past. Serena decides to set him free, but Bruce (the monster's real name) has his revenge by giving Serena a mermaid tail.

04- Samantha's Not-So-Leaning Tower of Pisa- Next Stop, Italy! The Stephens enjoy their vacation in a hotel overlooking the famous Leaning Tower of Pisa. Of course, Esmeralda pops in due to a lack of confidence. Esmeralda reveals that she made the tower lean by mistake when she was engaged to the builder. So Esmeralda takes it upon herself to right the wrong...by actually straightening the Leaning Tower of Pisa! The town totally freaks out when the famous tower is straightened correctly, and Esmeralda cannot remember what happened to make the Tower lean in the first place! A trip back in time helps her to remember. It seems that she tried to twitch up a tower sandwich for the builder and to make it lean, thus making the Tower lean again.

05- Bewitched, Bothered and Baldoni- The Stephens are sightseeing in Rome, and Endora tries to test Darrin's loyalty by bringing the famous Venus statue to life. When Darrin meets her (now named Vanessa), he misses an important meeting with a client named Mr. Baldoni, who also falls for Vanessa. Samantha, deciding that this is just too much, takes it upon herself to bring the famous Adonis statue to life. Adonis and Vanessa meet and fall in love instantly and are zapped back to the museum in their original forms- but with a small difference: they hold hands!

06- Paris, Witches' Style- Samantha and Darrin are now in lovely Paree and Endora is home with Tabitha and Adam. Maurice comes by the house and finds out that the Stephens are vacationing in Europe. He is mad because they should have stopped by in London to see how he was doing. Endora flies to Paris to warn Samantha and then Maurice appears in a scary cloud of smoke. Out of rare kindness, Endora zaps up a fake Darrin who charms and pleases Maurice. Everything just seems all right until the real Darrin comes in. Maurice notices the trick and sends poor Darrin to the top of the Eiffel Tower. Unbeknownst to him, his very appearance there makes a perfect advertising campaign for one of his clients who runs a travel agency.

07- The Ghost Who Made A Spectre of Himself- The European vacation is over when Darrin and Samantha pack up and are about to head home. Their departure is disrupted when Larry and Louise invite them to spend a weekend at the Duke of Whitset's hotel castle. It turns out that this hotel is haunted by a ghost named Henry, who happens to be the Duke's ancestor. Harry is turned on by Samantha, and to get a little bit close to her, he possesses Darrin's body. When Harry (in Darrin's body) is shut down by Sam, he moves on to Louise! Samantha calls up a lady ghost to ward Harry off. Darrin gets his body back when Harry leaves it to be with the lady ghost. Now we can call it a day in Europe as the cast heads for home.

08- TV or Not TV- Tabitha speaks out about violence on TV. She pops on a TV show to reprimand two aggressive puppets. Of course, Darrin happens to be watching the show and tells Sam to get Tabitha off the TV. The sponsors say otherwise and Tabitha becomes a TV star. The Stephens are dead set against this and Sam makes sure that the sponsor, Mr. Silverton, brings his own daughter to the show for back-up. Tabitha isn't quite ready for the home audience yet (until 1977 with her self-titled spin-off show) and Robin, the Silverton's daughter wins her chance to be in the spotlight.

09- A Plague On Maurice and Samantha- Samantha has lost her powers again and it seems like Maurice's magic is gone as well when he visits her. Dr. Bombay discovers that no one should kiss Samantha or they would lose their powers. So, until his powers come back, Maurice lives like a mortal. Maurice then helps out Darrin by winning a chili account for him. And that's when Samantha and Maurice get their powers back respectively.

10- Hansel and Gretel in Samanthaland- Hansel and Gretel are brought to life by Tabitha and are very sad and hungry. Tabitha decides that they should spend the night and goes into the storybook to ask their father. Samantha finds out and goes in the book after her, leaving a confused Darrin and the Tates at the dinner table. Worst of all, Hansel and Gretel run away again to look for food in the real world. In the storybook world, Sam finds Tabitha locked in the wicked witch's house. She brings Tabitha home and after a whole lot of confusion and police involvement, Hansel and Gretel are sent back into the storybook. Now, to get out of the situation of putting on a play of ""Hansel and Gretel"".....

11- The Warlock in The Gray Flannel Suit- Endora's causing trouble again! This time, instead of breaking up a marriage, she's breaking up Darrin's advertising company. She calls up Alonzo, a warlock who casts a spell on Larry, making him like all of his ideas on a carpet account instead of Darrin's. It gets to a point that Darrin quits McMann and Tate, but finds out that this is all Endora's fault. To get even with her, Samantha magically sets up an advertising campaign to handle the carpet account.

12- The Eight Year Itch Witch- Endora tries to make Samantha jealous again by recruiting a beautiful witch named Ophelia to woo Darrin. Ophelia tries anything to get Darrin to come to a sales convention, even faking stage fright. Darrin's intentions are to spend time with Samantha, but Larry Tate intervenes. Darrin goes but decides to take a late plane back, but the unrelenting Ophelia disguises herself as an airport manager, informing Darrin the airport is closed due to fog. Endora suggests to Samantha that fog is not the reason Darrin is not coming home. Sam realizes that there is something fishy going on pops in to see what is up. With a little magic, Darrin realizes that Sam is his real love and Endora's in the hot seat.

13- Three Men and A Witch On A Horse- Endora transforms Darrin into a gambler. Samantha insists Endora remove the spell. Endora makes more trouble by having Darrin bet on a horse named Fancy Dancer that is bound to lose, and Darrin gets Larry and a client to place all bets on Fancy Dancer. Samantha pops to the stables to talk to Dancer about winning the race for her husband and his friends. In the race, it seems like Dancer is bound to come in last, but he pulls through and wins!

14- Adam, Warlock or Washout?- The Witches Council wants to test out Adam to see if he is a warlock or a mortal. If he is a mortal, he will have to be taken away from the Stephens' household. Maurice helps Adam by giving him powers so that he will not be taken away. Adam is indeed normal, but he does have his own powers tucked away somewhere.

15- Samantha's Magic Sitter- Esmeralda's magic seems to be all wrong and is a failure as a witch. Larry says that a client of his needs a babysitter for the evening and gets Esmeralda to do the job so he can sign the contracts to win the deal. Esmeralda shows the Norton's child, Ralph, some magic and no one believes him when he tells all about it. As a result, Esmeralda is fired and Larry loses the Norton account. So Samantha sets up a dinner party with Esmeralda as a magician. Once everything is cleared up, everyone gets what they want: The Norton's are friends again and Larry wins the account.

16- Samantha is Earthbound- In this crazy episode, Samantha gets a condition which makes her entirely 500 pounds heavier. Dr. Bombay comes and gives her an antidote that makes her lighter...a little too light as she floats to the air! This will be hard to hide when the Prescott's, McMann and Tate's newest clients, have Samantha volunteer for a charity bazaar and fashion show. Sam tries everything to help weigh her down, but to no avail. In a memorable scene, Samantha holds a giant urn on her shoulder as she goes down the runway half floating, half walking in the fashion show. It is there that Darrin comes up with a spectacular slogan for Prescott shoes.

17- Serena's Richcraft- Serena visits Samantha because she is stripped of her powers. She then falls for Darrin's newest client Harrison Wilcott and decides to go out with him. Samantha tries to tell Wilcott that Serena is bad news, but Wilcott has fallen for Serena. So Samantha finds Countess Piranha (who took away Serena's powers) and makes Wilcott fall in love with the Countess.

18- Samantha On Thin Ice- Tabitha wants to learn how to skate, and Samantha agrees to take lessons with her in the mortal way. When Tabitha falls down constantly, Endora cannot take much more and decides to bewitch Tabitha's skates so that Tabitha becomes a terrific skater. Tabitha is bound to be the next Tara Lipinski if Endora doesn't take that spell off of her. So Endora does and Tabitha is back to being a poor skater again.

19- Serena's Youth Pill- Serena returns for the last time and baby-sits with Tabitha and Adam. Larry comes by to return a golf club and Serena does an Abby Cunningham on him. Larry hurries off, but not before Serena gives him a pill to be young and active (pre-Viagra!). It makes him younger, all right, by ten years! Larry gets even younger and younger and everyone is very worried about him. Serena gives him an antidote which turns him back to normal.

20- Tabitha's First Day At School- ""I know that Tabitha is ready for school, but is school ready for Tabitha?"" warns Sam. Tabitha attends school for the first time, and has a pretty hard time because a boy is messing with her. When he refuses to give up, Tabitha turns him into a frog. The teacher Miss Peabody gets on her about the frog and tells her to put it back in the class terrarium. Tabitha grabs the wrong frog and Samantha pops into the school and changes the frogs. When the right frog is brought home, Tabitha changes it back before the boy's mother finds out.

21- George Washington Zapped Here (Part 1)- Tabitha is working on a project on George Washington for school, and needs help. Esmeralda helps out, but accidentally conjures the real George Washington! Samantha tries to keep an eye on George, but he wanders off into the park where he is caught by a policeman. The policeman lets George go on a $2000 bail. As soon as Sam and Darrin bring George home, Esmeralda remembers the spell and sends George back, without his shoes! Esmeralda brings him back, but this time, he is joined by Martha Washington....

22- George Washington Zapped Here (Part 2)- The Washington's adjust to life in the twentieth century as they stay with the Stephens. Larry sees them both and decides that it is a great ad campaign for his new clients, the Whirlaway Washing Machine Company. George cannot tell a lie about the washer and, as a result, loses the account for Larry and Darrin. He does the same thing in the courtroom and his charges are dismissed. Then the Washington's are finally send back to their own time.

23- School Days, School Daze- Tabitha has to take a test to prove her intelligence and is very nervous. Endora helps her out by putting a spell on her, making her a super genius! Miss Peabody, the teacher from episode 246, is amazed about Tabitha's knowledge and tells the principal about it. Samantha finds out about this, and tells Endora to take the spell off Tabitha. Miss Peabody will not back off, and she catches Tabitha and Adam using their powers one day. Samantha catches Miss Peabody trying to be like Gladys Kravitz and gives her a lesson about snooping she will never forget.

24- A Good Turn Never Goes Unpunished- Darrin needs help on an advertising campaign and Samantha offers her help using her own mind. Darrin thinks that she used witchcraft for the ideas she gave him and decides not to use her ideas. Darrin comes up with some ideas of his own and are rejected by the client Mr. Benson. He thinks witchcraft was used in the decision, too. Call it deja vu when Darrin shows Benson Sam's ideas and Benson rejects them as well. Darrin feels like a total jackass and apologizes to Samantha, coming up with a stellar slogan for Benson.

25- Samantha's Witchcraft Blows A Fuse- Sam and Darrin have dinner at a Chinese restaurant and Sam orders a drink called ""The Heavenly Himalayan"" which causes her to lose her powers and to break out with stripes on her face. Dr. Bombay tells her about an antidote and Sam gets it from an Apothecary, only to break out with more stripes on her face. Dr. Bombay then tells her that she needs a feather from a dodo bird, but then that doesn't work either. There is another important ingredient needed: a piece of Himalayan cinnamon stick from the Chinese restaurant. After Darrin gets in trouble for getting the cinnamon, he gets it for Samantha and she is cured again.

26- The Truth, Nothing But The Truth, So Help Me Sam- In the final episode, Endora tries to test out Darrin's honesty by giving him a pin with a spell that makes him tell the truth. Darrin learns that honesty is not exactly the best policy when he jeopardizes an important account. It seems as though he may have lost the account, but the client likes the honesty between Darrin and Larry and gives them a break. As the series ends, Samantha and Darrin tell each other how much they love each other, without the magic of the truth pin.",1251849600,,14712,4.559636501325255

Her natural beauty shown one one the hairstylist ""peanut"" stopped using a gallon of spraynet on Sams hair. The series fashions were true to the times. Early shows had her wearing gloves when she shopped and house dresses while home. In Later shows she donned mini-skirts and kneesocks (at 39 years of age and she had three children), AMAZING.  Her wardrobe started as Donna Reed and ended as Goldie Hawn. Her TV transformation from B/W house mouse to color psychedelic dresses is a rare slice of time. Compare season one to season eight for a view of how American had changed.  Thanks Elizabeth.",1250467200,9,700,4.721311475409836

But, being a classic sitcom, the bloopers just don't matter. There is a few missed episodes, but thats okay. Maybe in time they will come out with the lost episodes. The DVD is worth it.

3871450,5,B00280QNKG,"Bewitched was a wonderful show when it was new and nothing has changed in the 38 years since it left the airwaves. Elizabeth Montgomery was as beautiful and funny in the eighth season as she was in the first. The stories, acting and humor are still wonderful to see. Many younger people these days may not appreciate old TV shows like Bewitched and others of its time since everything is so serious and graphic on TV these days, but it's nice to go back to a time when things were a little more light-hearted on TV (even though America itself was going through its own problems at the time) and get a chuckle and out of some good, clean humor. I highly recommend season eight of Bewitched. I was a big fan then and I'm still a big fan now.",1249689600,2,739,4.285714285714286
3871451,3,B00280QNKG,"First, I wanted to give only one star, and even that begrudgingly, because almost all the episodes of Season 8 are remakes of earlier episodes. This would not be such a big problem if Season 6 did not do exactly the same. Then, I remembered, back in their time, these episodes stretched from autumn till spring, and years separated these remakes from the originals. So, I raised the stars to two. (An example: the Henry VIII episodes were a healthy mixture of the ones when Samantha was sent back to an Old South plantation, without her memories or power, by a jealous wife, and of the episode when she flew back in time to Darrin's womanizer ancestor, and also of some themes of their Salem trip.)

Still later, I thought some people may start with the last season and, for them, most of the ideas will appear fresh. And you have to admit that, though the filmmakers lacked original ideas and the old budget-level for the last season, they did have some good intentions to improve on some of the ideas, or at least, listening to the winds of change, to make them more politically correct, such as the last episode in which the truth charm opens the mouth of the businesswoman's silent ""martyr"" husband: in the old version the role of the sexes was reverse. This is why the 3 stars. This season may have five stars for a starter (or for those who have bad memory or keep the seasons comfortably far apart in time), but for sitcom junkies, like me, it may not bring much novel charm.

Advice: if you haven't bought any of the previous episodes or you can give it as a present to someone unfamiliar with the series, buy this one. It's a good selection of some of the best ideas of previous seasons. However, if you have all the previous boxes, especially the first five, find a new sitcom or watch the first five seasons again, probably taking a break and thinking after each of the episodes pondering how the plot would be changed in a modern remake. If in doubt, read the plot summaries in Wikipedia and see how many of them sound familiar.",1249603200,7,2040,4.481182795698925
3871452,3,B00280QNKG,"In Episode #239, ""The Warlock In The Gray Flannel Suit"",  while witnessing the latest argument between her mortal husband Darrin (Dick Sargent)  and her grande- dame witch mother Endora (Agnes Moorehead), Samantha (Elizabeth Montgomery)  says, ""I think I'm in a rut!"" This is precisely the problem with the final season of ""Bewitched."" The writers, so creative and imaginitive in Seasons 1-7, seem to have gone as far as possible with the series' magical, mixed-marriage premise and began to heavily recycle scripts from previous, far superior seasons.
  Season 8 starts out magnificently , with a seven episode storyline, similar to the successful Season Seven ""Salem Saga"",  of ""Samantha and Darrin's European Vacation.""  The two- part  opening story involving King Henry VIII (Ronald Long) is especially elaborate. When Esmeralda (Alice Ghostly) straightens Italy's Leaning Tower Of Pisa, she screams, ""I'm cured!"" And Samantha replies, ""You're cured and I'm sick!"" Also in Italy, Endora and Samantha bring statues of Venus and Adonis to life. In England, an amorous ghost takes possession of Darrin's body.
 In ""Hansel And Gretel in Samanthaland,""  Billie Hayes (""Witchiepoo"" from ""H.R. Pufnstuff"") guest stars as a storybook witch who captures Tabitha (Erin Murphy). Samantha pops into the story of ""Hansel and Gretel"" to rescue her. Showing which witch is boss, Samantha says, ""You're not messing around with any storybook witch. I happen to be the real thing."" And she promptly turns Hansel & Gretel's Witch into a fairy godmother. In ""Samantha Is Earthbound"", Samantha suffers from a gravitational pull that makes her weigh 500 pounds, causing her to fall and sink, Dr. Bombay's (Bernard Fox) ""cure"", however, leaves her literally in mid-air. In ""Serena's Youth Pill"", crazy Cousin Serena gives Darrin's boss Larry Tate (David White) a pill that transforms the ""silver fox into a red haired devil."" At first, Larry reverts back to 1961, then a teenager, and a child. This episode is hilarious, and the sparkle is  momentarily back in Elizabeth Montgomery's eyes.
  ** BEYOND ""BEWITCHED"":  Several real-life realities, in addition to the  above- mentioned writers' creative block, brought ""Bewitched"" to an end.  The TV landscape was changing rapidly. By 1971, ""Bewitched"" aired on Saturday night, directly opposite the astringent social satire of ""All In The Family."" Compared to Archie Bunker's blustry bigotry, Samantha's special enchantments already belonged  to a gentler, more innocent TV era. The series fell to an all-time low of #72 in the ratings. Still, ABC eagerly  renewed ""Bewitched"" for a ninth season. But Elizabeth Montgomery,  after 254 episodes, and with her marriage to husband/director William Asher on the rocks, sensibly decided not to continue. William Asher and Elizabeth Montgomery separated in 1972 and divorced in 1974. William Asher went on to direct more TV Sitcoms. Immediately after completing  ""Bewitched"" in 1972, Elizabeth Montgomery appeared in  a TV movie for ABC entitled ""The Victim."" This spooky  movie signaled the dramatic turn her career would soon take. Elizabeth shrewdly and deftly avoided being typecast by ""Bewitched"" and Samantha by appearing in a series of critically acclaimed TV movies, earning Emmy Award nominations for ""A Case Of Rape"" (1974), ""The Legend Of Lizzie Borden"" (1975), and the mini-series ""The Awakening Land"" (1978). The fact that Elizabeth never received an Emmy for her work on ""Bewitched"" or any of her subsequent dramatic TV movies is  absolutely appalling and beyond belief.",1249084800,15,3555,5.38878842676311
3871453,5,B00280QNKG,"The added touches mean a lot to nostalgic nuts like me. As mentioned by others, the Elizabeth Montgomery intros, the bumpers and the restoring of the ending Screen Gems logo after each episode (which was also included on the 7th season set) are all very cool and add a lot to the whole package.  These classic television show sets sell partly due to the retro appeal (besides their quality entertainment value), thanks Sony for recognizing that!",1248652800,3,445,4.855263157894737
3871454,5,B00280QNKG,"I have now watched all of the seasons of Bewitched, every episode and some more then one time from my dvd, and many watched over and over again.

It is one of my favorite shows along side I love Lucy.

Being a huge fan I will list some negatives and positives about the episodes, not the actual set. Some things that I do not like about season 8 is the repeat episodes. If you remember the episode where Samantha turned a cat into a women, well it is repeated word for word on one episode and I did not like it. Some of the characters were different but still the story line was repeat. Also the one about the episode where Darrin is tempted by another women/witch is repeated.

A lot of the stories are more boring then in seasons 1-7. I guess they were running out of ideas for the show.

Other then repeat story lines the season is pretty good. I still like Season 7 much better. Abner and Gladdis does not appear in this season but they are mentioned, as well as Uncle Arthur.

Elizabeth Montgomery has several opening segments and I do like that about the season. The remastering quality is another plus. They were originally going to do another season but Liz wanted to move onto other things, also the marriage to her husband and director of Bewitched was ending in divorce.

There are still at least 5-7 episodes or more that are really worth the price of this dvd set and I would recommend buying it for that reason alone.. I am glad to have my set complete.",1248393600,3,1467,4.335766423357664
3871455,3,B00280QNKG,"This was the worst season ever.  Many of the story lines had been done during previous seasons.  There has never been any chemistry between Elizabeth M and Dick S. so after Dick Y.  the show went down hill.  If you are a collector like me I say buy it.  If your looking for a quality show, I say pass.",1247875200,,301,4.033898305084746
3871456,5,B00280QNKG,"What can I say, I grew up with this show, and no television stations in the US currently play it, Nick At Nite has been turned into a modern comedy station (Booo!), and TV Land is turning into that, for shame.

This is part of the golden age of television comedy, todays honestly is not the same, and personally, I think it's terrible, but these shows, amongst others from the era, are classic comedies, that are actually funny!

Season 8 was the last season for Bewitched, but it showed no signs of letting up, it still has it's steam, this season takes place in Europe.

Bottom line, this was the end of a great series, and this season, although it was the last, surely showed no signs of it coming to an end.

If you are a Bewitched fan, you must get this, and even included is the original introductions by none other than Elizabeth Montgomery, and also when the show went to commercial break, they included ""Bewitched will be right back"" said by Elizabeth, thanks Sony, for putting out the whole series on DVD!",1247702400,,1015,4.47027027027027

It's just a nice touch that makes it seem like your back watching the show in 1972.  Thanks Sony!",1247616000,3,412,4.694444444444445
3871458,5,B00280QNKG,"""Bewitched"" is a national Treasure!  Due to syndication through the years, different generations have grown up watching this ageless series.  The original runs were 1964-1972, long before DVDs or videotapes.  In fact, it came on the air as television was slowly converting to color - the first two years of Bewitched were shot in black and white.

But now the entire Bewitched series is available on DVD.  I've heard rumors that the whole series will eventually be released as a boxed set but you can buy each year separately from Amazon.  Years 1 and 2 are available in B&W (preferred by purists) or colorized (a reasonably good job.)

The eighth and final year is notable for the fact that no one knew it was the last season when it was shot.  Therefore, there is no series finale as we see on most series today.  A contract existed for a ninth season but during production of the eighth, Elizabeth Montgomery and director Richard Michaels (54 episodes), friends for the first seven seasons and both already married, had fallen in love.  Their secret affair during production resulted in Elizabeth moving in with him after shooting the final episode.  If you look real carefully in the last episodes, particularly the ones directed by Michaels, you can see more fun in her face and a new sparkle in her eye.

With little syndication remaining, the way to enjoy Bewitched forever is to own the entire series on DVD.  If you have children or grandchildren (or just for yourself), you will enjoy watching this beautiful, talented woman in this ageless series for all time.  Treat yourself to ""Bewitched.""  You'll be glad you did.",1244246400,6,1628,4.805755395683454
3871459,5,B00280QNKG,"""Bewitched"" aired its final season in 1971-1972. The show was suppose to air for one more season but Elizabeth Montgomery wanted off the show for various reasons; she felt it was time to move on to more gratifying projects, but the big reason was her and William Asher, who produced the series, were splitting up. Elizabeth had moved in with Richard Michaels, one of the show's directors. Asher would go on to produce two more series for ABC in the following season, both of which failed, and Liz would go on to TV movies, the most famous being ""A Case of Rape"" for NBC, where she played a victim who is raped twice by her attacker. The film still holds the record as being one of the highest rated TV movies ever.
 The final year of ""Bewitched"" was a sad one: scripts were repetitive, and the writers ran out of ideas, so they rewrote scripts from the first two seasons. The actors, most notably Liz, were running through their scenes. In the last several episodes you can tell that Elizabeth was not enjoying herself anymore, and it makes it very difficult to watch. Supporting characters like Uncle Arthur and Gladys and Abner Kravitz were nowhere to be found in the last year, and the series just didn't jell. ABC didn't help matters with the airing of ""Bewitched"" as they programmed the show opposite the #1 rated series in the country, ""All In The Family"", on Saturday nights, signalling ""Bewitched's"" demise. ""Bewitched"" ended its final year at #72 with a 10.4 rating. If your a true ""Bewitched"" fan like me pick up this season to complete your collection. If your looking for the best of ""Bewitched"" pick up the first five seasons worth of boxsets, as they were the best years of the show. Also, don't buy the terrible movie based on the series starring Nicole Kidman as it is a complete rip-off of the series. There is also a great book written on ""Bewitched"" entitled ""The Bewitched Book"" by Hirbo J. Pilato. It was re-titled ""Bewitched Forever"" a few years later, and is now unfortunately out of print, so try a good used bookstore or Ebay. These books offer some great info on the program, including cast and crew interviews, a complete synopsis of all 242 episodes including air dates, and much more.
 This final boxset of ""Bewitched"" arrives in stores July 14th, 2009, and there is talk that a complete series boxset will be coming out at the end of the year or in early 2010. I am hoping there will be a ton of bonuses, including interviews with those who worked on the series, as well as having the rare/lost episodes of ""Bewitched"". There were approximately three shows of the series that were never put into syndication after they were produced.
 On March 25th, 1972 the best television supernatural comedy ended its ABC run with little fanfaire, but thank God for syndication and cable TV, as well as DVD, as ""Bewitched"" will always live on.",1242518400,70,2860,4.6370808678500985
3871460,5,B00280QNKG,"The fall of 1971 began the 8th and final season for ""Bewitched"". This last season begins with Samantha (Elizabeth Montgomery) and husband Darrin Stephens (Dick Sargent) going to Europe on a business trip for McMann and Tate, Darrin's advertising job. There is lots of wonderful and witchy trouble waiting for Sam and Darrin in England, Scotland, Italy and France. This 8th season also features Esmerelda zapping up George Washington for a school project she is helping Tabitha (Sam and Darrin's daughter) with. Tabitha starts school and gets into trouble with her natural witchcraft abilities with her Hansel and Gretel book and also by zapping herself into a children's television show. With her grandmother Endora's help- Tabitha becomes a champion skating star and a genius on a school intelligence test. Sam also has her moments in this last season, when her face becomes striped after having a Heavenly Himalaya Drink at a Chinese restaurant.

""Bewitched""  was originally based on the 1942 movie ""I Married a Witch"" and the 1958 film ""Bell, Book and Candle.""  There were always plenty of situations  to write about when looking into the comedic romance between a mortal husband and his wife who's a real life witch. ""Bewitched"" stands as the longest running Supernatural sitcom of the sixties and seventies.  Before Season 8, ABC had offered Elizabeth Montgomery and her ""Bewitched"" Director husband William Asher large pay raises plus part ownership to do another 3 seasons  of ""Bewitched"".  By this time however, neighbors Abner and Gladys Kravitz, Uncle Arthur and Darrin's parents  were no longer written in the scripts. The story ideas were running dry and the series was now opposite the mega hit show ""All in the Family""  on Saturday nights in 1972.

""Bewitched"" finished number 72 in the 1972 Television Seasons Ratings.  It was no longer the top hit that it once was in the sixties seasons.  Even with all these reasons to end the show, the show actually ended when Elizabeth Montgomery  fell in love with the new director for ""Bewitched""- Richard Michaels. Elizabeth left her husband William Asher and moved in with Richard Michaels, never to return to ""Bewitched"" for another season. It's really wonderful that we finally have all 8 Seasons of ""Bewitched"" on dvd, so we can watch the talented Elizabeth Montgomery and the many fantastic ""Bewitched"" cast members whenever we want!
